PREFACE
During the past eight years of work on the Ticuna language, beginning without an inkling as to the sounds of the language or the structure of the grammar involved, I came to wish many times that a practical gramnnr of the language were available. As I struggled through the uncertain responses of my informants, I determined to prepare such a grammar so that those who followed in my trail would not have to spend the long hours of searching out the details needed to learn Ticuna. Now that the sound system has been analyzed and published, x a practical alphabet has been chosen, and the structure of the grammar has been largely analyzed for publication, I feel that the time has come to organize the material I have collected, and to publish this practical grammar.
In view of the fact that I expect the student to be primarily interested in learning and in assimilating Ticuna, the gramm:.l.r has been designed to facilitate that assimilation through actual practice in conversation--hearing and speaking Ticuna. The dialogues, to be memorized for immediate use in conversational situations, are coupled with drills to teach basic patterns. The sentences of the dialogues are presented in a conversational context similar to that found in actual conversation in a Ticuna home. The drills were intended to help the student, through much repitition, to react automatically without having to think through extensive grammatical rules and exceptions.
The grammar has been arranged in ten units, with each of the first eight consisting of three basic conversations followed by drills, and then a section of grammatical and cultural helps. Following these helps in Units II through Vill, there are tone drills designed to teach the recognition of specific tones. Units IX and X consist of text materials to aid the student in understanding the syntactical structure of the language. Finally, an appendix is provided, with some of the materials one would expect to find in a conventional grammar; that is, sentence structure, noun classification, verb classification, etc.
I have sincerely appreciated the untiring efforts of those who have contributed toward the production of this book, including my main informant, Pastor Valencia Peiia, my husband, Lambert L. Anderson, and Summer Institute of Linguistics technicians, typists, and publications department.

INTRODUCTION The Alphabet and the Pronunciation of Ticuna

The Ticuna alphabet consists of the following twenty-six letters: a b c ch d e f g i j 1 m n ii ng o p q r s t u U w x y

In learning the Ticuna language, the pronunciation is of utmost importance. One could memorize hundreds of useful phrases but if his pronunciation of the letters is faulty, or, if he uses incorrect tones (pitch levels), he will not be understood. Therefore, it is advisable to work on a small amount of material at a time, seeking to acquire the ability to repeat the phrases exactly as they are spoken on the record before going
on to new material.

Ticuna vowels are pronounced as follows: x

a is pronounced like English a in father. nama 23 3

e is pronounced like English e in bet.

nape
a a3

i is pronounced like English i in police. nipa
a! 2

o is pronounced like English o in obey. otere 33 5

u is pronounced like English u in rule. ucapu 3 35

U is pronounced like English oo in took. tu (with lips spread apart as when smlling). ~

road he sleeps it's dry species of fruit room or enclosure thread (spool of)

x Due to the transition from Ticuna to English sounds, all examples are necessarily approximations.
:&- See drills for pronunciation of u on page :pctii.

xviii

When a vowel is written with a wavy line over it, it is pronounced through the nose (nasalization):

•a

mosquito

When a vowel is written with a straight line under it, it is pronounced

deep in the throat (laryngealization):

to

species of night monkey

1'"

When a laryngealized vowel is pronounced with tone 5, word finally, it is followed by a glottal stop. Since this is predictable, it is omitted in practical writing.

Ticuna consonants are pronounced as follows:

b, d, f, m, n, and w are pronounced like the same letters in English.

g is always pronounced like the g in gum, not like the g in germ. This sound is written gu when it occurs before i:

cuga
35 5

your language

Guima 23 5

girl's name

c, p, and t are pronounced like the same letters in Spanish and Portuguese. This is like these letters in English where they are written after s, rather than when they begin a word:

cape 3a

coffee

tutu

drum

'5

Notice the difference in the pronunciation of "scan" and "can"; "spin"

and "pin"; "stop" and "top". The consonants that begin the word have a

puff of air after them, which the ones after s do not have. This is one

of the main differences between English sounds like these and the same

ones in Spanish, Portuguese, and Ticuna.

Before i and e, c ls written qu:

quidora
33 '

you lie

queture •5 5

species of Uger

xix

ch is prono~ced like the same letter in Spanish:

omacha
33 5

porpoise

This ch is pronounced without the puff of air which occurs with the chin English "clair".

and 1 are pronounced like the same letters in Spanish:

Jaime 23 5

James

lelu

watch or clock

32

This is like the English 1 in "lick", rather than the 1 in "loop". (Spanish and Portuguese 1 is pronounced with the tongue tip forward in the mouth, and with the back of the tongue down. )

ii is pronounced like ii in Spanish or ng in Portuguese. This is close to the English ni in ''onion":

na

this

2

ng is always pronounced like the ng in English "singer", never like the

ng in "finger": x

·

nga paca 3

ngu

species of large fruit

4

(regional Spanish "mocambo")

r, whether word initial or medial, is pronounced like the same letter in Spanish word medially. This is like the usual fast pronunciation of the tt in "Betty":

bere
as a

species of fruit

s is pronounced like the same letter ln Spanish. It ls used solely in loan-words, and usually changes to ch:

camlseta s sas

t-shirt

x See drills for pronunciation of ng on page xxiii.

XX

x is pronounced like the sound an English speaker gets between the o's of
"oh-oh." This occurs frequently in Ticuna and is treated like a r.onsonant (glottal stop): x

bo::m .. ll

large white larva

y is usually pronounced like English j in "Jude". This sound may be
pronounced like either J, or y of English "yes" when it precedes a:

yura species of palm
3&

yapuna
33&

oven

Sometimes when the Ticunas speak, their words sound almost like a song. Each syllable seems to correspond to the pitch of a certain note. Different speakers vary in their range; that is, some speakers' whole range seems to be higher or lower, and the over-all expanse of the range may be narrower or broader. Excitement seems to move the individual's whole range higher in pitch::

LEVELS
:: ~ 2 3

Inangu i to. ''Another one is arriving." would be spoken on the notes G,
l2 34 5
E, D, C, and A, as lllustrated above.

x See Drills for pronunciation of x on page :xxiv.
D When the lowest tone is pronounced deep in the throat (laryngealization), it sounds about one note lower. It is distinguished by the line under the vowel.
xxi

Sometimes a syllable will start on one note and glide down to another one. Such a glide of two notes has the same spoken length as a syllable with a single note marked:
GLIDES

Ichangu.
1s 3

I arrive.

Ichangu.
1 3 35

23
I fall (in a canoe).

See how this is spoken below.

I

••ngu s

Oi'J 35

It is important for any outsider attempting to speak the Ticuna language to study and listen to the records with the thought foremost in mind of
mimicking exactly the notes spoken on each word. These examples show why:

Nanamu. He weaves it. Nanamu. He spears iL Nanamu. He sends it.

2. Leave off the final ng, pronouncing only the ngl.

The follow.l.ng are some Tlcuna words beginning with ng:

n~h\. meat of a paca

avocado

ngora ldll

hour

---------

x-

1. Pronounce oh, oh with a definite break between them like one would say:

"Oh-oh. Look woo's coming now."

(That oh-oh, written in Ticuna orthography, would be om.)

2. Pronounce the following simple variations employing x:

uxu nuxu axa maxa exe maxe nuxma

3. The Ticuna "greeting" is a combination of several of the above:

Nuxmaxe
" 1"

Hello.

Note the final nasalized vowel.

Close-knit Vowel Clusters: ai, and au.

In clusters of vowels, each member receives approximately the same or equal spoken timing, with the exceptions of clusters ai and au which receive shorter timing when the vowels have the same tones, or when the tone on the second vowel is lower (in pitch) than the tone on the first (glides). Short timing is indicated by the writing of the tone on the last
vowel only:

a.i. au.. (when short)

ai au
.. 2 42

(when long)

This is also done with labialization, as in -cWa (-cua) 5

For Anthropological background, the student is urged to read THE TUKUNA, by Curt Nimuendiju: University of California Press, Berkely, California (ptper back, $2. 50, cloth bound, $4. 50).

UNIT I

INTRODUCTION

Unit I is divided into two sections. The main section of Basic Conversations with accompanying Drills, is followed by a short section of Grammatical and Cultural Helps.

Directions for Study and Listening are as follows: The student should -

1. Go through each conversation, reading silently the complete conversation in English.

2. Listen to the conversation on record: (a) simultaneously following the written conversation; (b) with closed eyes.

3. Now read aloud with the record the Ticuna conversation, with special effort toward imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation being heard (three times).

4. Cover the English and read the Ticuna aloud. Think what each phrase

means, noting those not remembered. Check the meanings after com-

pleting the reading of the entire conversation.

--

5. With book closed, listen again to the record: (a) thinking of the conversation as a whole; (b) repeating with the record until material comes naturally.

6. All sections entitled Drills should be covered, following the same procedure outlined for---uiestudy and acquiring of the conversations. Underlining of certain items in the English translation is done to call attention to either special features being drilled, or to new vocabulary. This aid will be discontinued beginning with Unit v.

ll. GRAMMATICAL AND CULTURAL HELPS

A. Greeting

In direct address to a "well-known acquaintance", the person's name is

used: Nuxmaxe Pa Paurux. Hello, Paul.

4

14 4

35

If the "name is unknown", men are addressed as yima, and women as 55

woxrecU:
!"" 5 3

Nuxmaxe Pa Yimax.

4

14 4 5 5

Hello, Fellow.

Nuxmaxe Pa WoxrecU. 414 4 !'"53

Hello, Girl.

The "godmother" of a person's child is addressed as cumax, and the 31

"godfather" as cupa.x: 31

Nuxmaxe Pa Cumax.

4

14 4 3 1

Hello, Godmother.

Nuxmaxe Pa Cupax.

4

14 4 31

Hello, Godfather.

There are also equivalents for aunt, uncle, grandparents, etc. Any

"male outsider" (such as a missionary or patron) is addressed as cori,
31
and a "female outsider" as chiura:

Nuxmaxe Pa Corix.

4

14 4 31

Nuxmaxe Pa Chiurax.

4

l4 4

33 5

Hello, Sir. Hello, Madam.

The two latter titles are not used in reference to local nationals unless
they fit into the patron (land-owning) class. "Strangers" are greeted

22

e formally by omitting the final of Nuxmaxe, "Hello.'': Nuxrnax, "Hello

4

4

14

4

1

(formal greeting)."

This is also done among acquaintances as a sign of friction between the

two persons. The second person has the choice of answering formally

(answering because he has to) or he may choose to answer using the

complete word, thus indicating his willingness to forget whatever was

the point of friction between them. The direct address indicator Pa
4
must precede the name of all persons addressed. (This is a matter of

respect.)

B. Conjunction "and"

"And" is expressed by rU:
5

MoxcUta rU cuwe chartixtl.

35 5 1 5 23 1

3 3 23

Just a minute and I'll accompany you.

C. Preposition "to", "from"

"to" is expressed by the suffix -wa. The same suffix expresses "for"
1
something, "at", and "in":

(1) Paurupatawa
3 5 23 1
(2) narafiawa
325 1
(3) CarUgUwa chapuracu.
22513332
(4) Chapatawa chapuracu. 52313332

to Paul's house for oranges I work at rubber. I work in my house.

D. Bound Nouns Those nouns which must take a prefix to complete their meaning are

23

called bound nouns. In Ticuna thinking, there are some items such as

various body parts, relatives, etc., that must belong to someone. Thus,

one must use a prefix such as na- "his" when referring to a bound noun
23

like -para"leg" in order to indicate whose leg he is talking about(napara

3s

23 3 s

"his leg"). Instead of the prefix mentioned above, another noun may be

compounded with the bound noun: yatllpara "man's leg" (yatll "man").

355 3 5

355

E. Interrogative "Where?"

''Where?" is expressed by {.Ngexta? When asking, ''Where is so and 51

so?", the -ta is replaced by -U, -cU, or -e:

1

2

2

2

(1) {.Ngexta na:xU? 5 1 2 23

Where did he go?

(2) l. Ngexti i Macu?
s 2 4 23 s

Where is Mark?

(3} l. NgecU ya Pauru?

52 2

35

Where is Paul?

(4) {.Ngexe ya cuxm.a.? 5 2 2 3S 5

Where is your wife?

Of the above-mentioned, ngexU seems to be the most frequently used
52

when asking the whereabouts of someone or something.

F. Third Person

Although nUmax is the general third-person form (which may be transla-
•3
ted "he", "she", or "it"), the following should be noted:

(1) ngimax S5 3
(2) tumax 35 4
(3) yixema 354 2
(4) yimax
42

third person feminine third person familiar third person previously referred to third person distant

24

G. Names

Every Ticuna Indian has a name which is associated with his clan.

Those males belonging to the aru (rattle) clan, for instance,· may have

the following names: TaebUcU, DexpUtacU, ChorexecU, YauxrexecU,

423

2 533

2343

~ 343

etc. Those of other clans may not use these names. Frequently the

name being used is a derivative of a Spanish or Portuguese name. Com-

pare Marcos and Macu, Pablo and Pauru, Luis and Dui. In some in-

23 5

35

35

stances, however, the name seems to be neither a name pertaining to

clan, nor a derivative of a Spanish or Portuguese name: Ari from 42

Bernardo. The expression "last name" is napexeega: l Taxa.cU niii i

35 5 31 s

T 2 2 25 2 4

napexeega? What is his last name? 3!1 5 31 5

H. First Person (inclusive and exclusive)

(1) yixemax 54 2

first person plural inclusive (includes person spoken to)

(2) tomax 34

first person plural exclusive (excludes person spoken to)

I. Connectives To date, the author has not discovered any absolute criteria by which to predict the choice of connective to be used in a given sentence. In some cases, the choice seems to be somewhat dependent on the noun which it precedes. Often there may be a choice of any one of two or three different connectives, but in other cases only one particular connective is acceptable. The following connectives are generally used when referring

25

to the present or future, but may also refer to the past (although ga is 2

more generally used when the sentence is in the past):

-a a a

i

i

i

ya

ya

a

a (2) Namu wUra. 2 24 3 1
a (3) Namu woca. 2 2 :'15 3 5

II. GRAMMATICAL AND CULTURAL HELPS

A. Unavailability
It is common practice among the Ticunas to simply say, "There isn't
any." Nataxuma. if a request is made for something which they do not
22 3 3
want to sell or give. They do not consider this to be a falsehood.

B. Canoe making
Since the canoe is the main means of travel, it's making is of great importance to the Ticunas. After the canoe has been formed and hollowed out with a special tool, the top edges are spread to make for stability of the finished product. This work is done early in the morning when there is no wind. The fire underneath consists mostly of coals burning very low. Large clothespin-like devices are fitted over the edges and used to slowly spread the two sides of the hollowed-out log. The seats are made of cedar boards. The canoe is finally ready after the cracks are tarred and any imperfection smoothed out. The following are some "terms used in canoe-making".

(1) purure 5 s3

short handled chopper for hollowing out canoe

(2) chaya caxma 33 4 a

I chop out the inside

(3) chana chexe 3s 4 4

(4) chaya chexe

II. GRAMMATICAL AND CULTURAL HELPS

A. Buying and selling
The term used for buying and selling literally means trading. "To buy" is to barter for, and "to sell" is to barter with. "To cost" literally says "to have a price". "To pay" means, "to him he makes -the price", and "to owe" means, "to him he lacks the price". See examples.

B. Light and dark skin

I buy (barter for) toasted manioc. I sell (barter with) toasted manioc. It costs (has price of) two red-backs. The gentleman pays him. The gentleman owes him.

The term nawaxU is used referring to a person's dark skin, and nacho

2 23 3

25

to a light skin. Nacho is also used referring to light hair, but nawexe,

2 '!;'"

2 T4

the term used for dark things, is used in reference to hair instead of

nawaxU.
2 23 :s

(1) NawaxU i Pauru.

22334

35

Paul is dark.

(2) Nach.Q i Cori.
2 5 .. 3 1

The gentleman is light.

162

(3) Nachoxyae i Cori.
2.., 134 31

The gentleman's hair is light.

(4) Naw_gxyae i Pauru.

24134

35

Paul's hair is dark.

A negro is called a waxwe. When a sick person is very pale they say he
23 1
is yellow, instead of saying he is light-colored. See examples.

(5) Wllxi i waxwe nixi.
23 2 4 23 1 25 2

He's a negro.

( 6) Nanadexic hi.
2522 2

He's pale {yellow-skinned}.

The root of the word for skin -chaxmff may also be used with light and
'!"" 3
dark. (Note tonal alternates. )

(7) Nachoxchaxmu.

21

5

(8) Nawaxchaxmff.

C. Numbers

He's light-skinned. He's dark-skinned.

Counting is done by numbering the fingers and toes. One, two, three, and four are simple numbers. Five literally says, "one hand as a unit". Six says,. "on the other hand one", seven, "on the other hand two", etc. See examples.

(1) WUximexpU.

five

23 2 '!"" T

(2) Naixmexwa rU wUxi.

six

Ten is literally "all the hands as one unit":

(3) Guxm~U.

ten

1 TT

163

The count may be continued by saying, "both the hands and on the foot one", and so on to twenty, using both the hands and feet:

(4) TacutUwa ru wUxi.
42315232
(5) Guxcutu. ~ 23

eleven twenty

This is rarely done however, as after ten, the term for "many" is usually employed. Spanish and Portuguese numbers are frequently used among the Indians in close contact with those cultures.

D. Verb of ability "can''

"Can" is expressed by chomixi nanguxU, which literally means ''I have 5 23 2 3 4
the ability or know-how":

(1) NgU. Chomixi nanguxU.

31'1

5232 34

(2) Tama chomaxa nanguxff.

chamuxti ya pexchi.

5 522 a

This verb cannot be used in cases of inability to go somewhere, to work, etc. due to circumstances prohibiting that activity.
The alternative expression is "not know how to do something", or ''be impossible to do it":

F. Nominalizers

Let's look for flowers. Let's look for bananas. Let's look for "mocambo" fruits. Let's look for grapes.

There are three nominalizer forms: -xU-, -ne, and -cu. These may

2

5

3

occur suffixed to the expression l NanuxraxU ... ? "How is ... ?" as

55 5 3

.

seen in the examples below. These forms usually refer to size unless

color is included in the question. If the inquiry concerns a person, the

form ma,y indicate size, or, if he is sick, the state of his health. The

items mentioned below must take the specific form with which they are

listed.

II. GRAMMATICAL AND CULTURAL HELPS

A. Telling time There are those who still ask what time it is with the expression, "Where is the Sun?", but "What hour is it?" seems to be the more accepted expression at present. In most cases the actual hour is not so important to them as knowing whether it is noon yet, or late afternoon, (about four o'clock on) etc. They usually point to the sky to indicate what time something took place. See examples:

(1) l Ngexti i uaxcU?
s a4:tr5 3e

Where is the sun?

(2) l T!!,xacUrU ngora nixf?
5223 235252

What time is it? (What hour?)

B. Preposition "for" (in behalf of) I (in order to have)

In Unit I the student was shown that one translation of the Suffix -wa is
1
"for", meaning "in order to get bring", when used in a sentence like

narafiawa chaxli "I'm going for oranges". There are various other 3351323

forms of "for". The Suffix -xU or -ixt\ (as in nUx\\) indicates "in behalf

1

51

351

of" as to work in behalf of someone:

(1) NUx\I chapuracu.
3513332

I work for him.

(2) Coriaxii chapuracu~
3 15 1 3 3 3 2

I work for the gentleman.

202

If the work -is "to obtain something/in order to have", the Suffix -xca is
5
used.

(3) Naxcl! chapuracU.

Z35

3332

I work for it.

(4) Naxchiruca chapuracU.

Z3

15 5

33 32

I work for clothes.

The suffix -xca is also used in sending for someone to come, or in ex-
T
pressing lonesomeness or sadness for another person:

(5) Naxcl! nangema i Cori. 2352 23431
(6) Naxcl! changechaxi.i. 235 3 255
C. Verb "to like"

The gentleman sends for him. I'm lonesome for him.

"To like a person or thing" is expressed in a number of different ways.
The most frequently utilized expression seems to be, Choxru me nixi ll6 3 23 252
"I like him/ it." See other examples below:

(1) Chauxca name i fia. 51" 2234 2

I like this. (For me this is good.)

(2) Chox\i namepua. 35 1 2 23 35

I like (doing) this.

D. Demonstrative Pronoun "this" The student has been preViously acquainted with three forms meaning

203

"this", iia, iiaa, and daa. x The new form included in this unit, nama

2 24

35 5

22

"this", has an added meaning of present, and may precede expressions

of day, night and week: xx

(1) nama i ngune:x\1

a 24

5 32

today (this day)

(2) ftama i chtlta:Jdl

a 24

25 2

tonight (this night)

(3) ftama i yt1xtl
2342353

this week

Dama precedes month and year.
4a

(4) dama ya tawemtlcU
4.325358

this month

(5) dama ya taunectl
.. 2 2 5 3 3

this year

In Basic Conversation C. Months and Years, the expr.ession for "this

year" is gl.ven: damagu "in this one" If year were not mentioned prev-
• 24

iously it would be necessary to say dama taunectlgu.

.. 2

5 8 34

x The alternate set of tones is daa (used in reference to most machines). 44
xx Note alternate tones on example (3)
204

E. Adjective "next"
"Next week" and any "next" preceding the name of a day of the week or month of the year itilizes the expression (presented in Drill B-7 of this
Wlit) nai:

(4) dama ya tawemUcUgu 42 25 3534

G. Past Tense
Thus far the student has been. introduced to the Connective ga which
2

205

seems to indicate the "past", and maru, which, preceding the verb ex33
pression may indicate the "present" or "present perfect". In the
past" may also be expressed by adding cbir~ after the Verb Expres-
25
sion. It indicates something done in the past which isn't being done at
the present, or with the verb "to know" it mmns it was known in the
past but is not consciously thought of at the present:

(1) Marn cbapuracn chir~
33 3332 2!1

I worked (not working at present).

(2) Mar\1 ntix(f cbacya_ cbir~

33353

35

25

I knew that (sometime in the past).

Buxcuta may precede the verb expression to indicate the past:
3 35

(3) BuxcUta nawexi. 3 3 5 2 ....

It was black (emphasizing past tense).

H. Demonstrative Pronoun "that"

"That" is expressed with two forms: ngema, and yima.

3 ..

.. 2

(1) Ngema ni:xi'.
s • asa

n. GRAMMI\.TICAL ~CULTURAL HELPS

A. Verb "to sit"

There are two forms of the verb "to sit": inarnto, and narnwa.

1234

23!1

(1) Inarnto i yatn. 1234431111

The man sits.

(2) Mea inarnto i nii. 3&6 1 2 3 4 4 311
(3) Narnwa i weri.
a 3 II 4 II 1
a. (4) Chauchacnxnwa narnwa i II 2 3 II 1 a 3 II 4 4

The tree is standing ("sitting") straight. The bird sits.
The mosquito sits on my arm.

B. Sickness
Invariably any pain within the body is blamed upon a "hex", (usually consisting of a palm splinter being magically introduced. into the sufferer) by a witch doctor. Witch doctors, called yunta can both harm
32 2
and cure people. Medicine men, called ngixiruxii, only cure. Hexes 261 6
are usually caused by someone being angry with the person hexed, after which the angry party calls in a witch doctor to put on the hex.
C. Medicine
The TlcWJa.s rarely come to the point immediately in aaldng for medicine. Usually, after a period of waJ.Ung around, the person will ask,

274

1..Nangexma i nxti"xU? "Is there medicine?" The person addressed may 2 3 45415

respond by asking, l. Tan.cUrU nxti'xti? "What medicine?'' Some an-52~2 3 4 I II
ewers may be:

(1) AxUneca.

For fever.

{2) Mi.Ixextnx1i. II 2 I I

For sore eyes.

(3) Ya.xtic.a.

For diarrhea.

D. Insects

When head lice, naxchira, are put into the mouth it is to kill them be-

tween the teeth, not to eat them.

At a certain stage of growth, leaf-cutter ants, nitvU:xD. fiy out of their
il 2 3
holes. There is great scurrying about to capture them. After being

fried in a dry kettle, (they contain just enough grease not to burn) they

are eaten by all as a great delicacy. The flavor resembles that of

French-fried shrimp.

Another favorite am:mg the Ticunas is the large yellow-white larva

found in dead trees, boxo. These are simply placed on the coals until
4I
a "pop" indicates that they are well done.

275

E. Childbirth Usually an expectant mother is assisted by her own mother, or a sister. In case of long labor, the father or maternal uncle may assist by standing or kneeling behind her with his arms under her arms to support her in an upright position. Her mother or an aunt may massage downward on the abdomen at the time of contraction. There seems to be little embarrassment on the part of the delivering mother, although modesty is observed as far as possible. Scissors or a machete are used to cut the umbilical cord, which is severed following the afterbirth. It is not uncommon to have a dozen or more people lounging about on the porch waiting for the news to be announced.

UNIT IX
INTRODUCTION This Unit consists of three short texts and two longer ones. Each text is accompanied by a brief English translation and a vocabulary for the student's reference. There are no drills included in this Unit as it is expected that each student will select vocabulary, and or phrases particularly useful to him, and then memorize them for future reference. Listening time should include an over-all review of Units I through
IV.

THE FOX'S STORY One time a dog went into the forest with a fox. They went to spend the night there. The fox said, ''My friend, why am I hungry?'' It was close to a house. They wanted to steal. The fox walked back and forth but could not get through anywhere. At last, kicking, he pushed himself through a small crack. Then he looked into a cooking kettle. He saw food there, and he ate very much. The dog stayed outdoors. Then the fox was going to leave, but he couldn't get out because he (his abdomen) was too fat. He said, "How am I going to get out of here my friend?" The dog answered him, "Well, pretend you're dead there." Later on it was day. The owner of the house went to the kitchen, and there she saw the dead fox. She said, "What's the matter with this fox that it died here?" She looked in the cooking kettle, and (saw that) it was with her food that he died. She said to her husband, "come, look at this." - so ,said his wife. And her husband went to see it, and said, "This fox is very fat." Let's eat it." And his companion, the dog, was worried because he heard that they
wanted to eat his companion. (But) they didn't eat him. ''Well, throw it away," he said to his wife. She went to throw him
away, and threw him there. It hurt the fox very much but he escaped.

ABOUT F1SH The Ticunas enjoy spear-fishing for their food because when they don't go fishing, they're probably hungry. Sometimes they go fishing with a hook also. When the "carachama" fish have eggs, the people go and feel around for them because in the holes where they stay, there are lots of "carachama"
fish. *
They sometimes go fishing with a throw net also, and catch fish with it. But where there are "pana'' fish they quickly chew holes in the net.
For the "tucunare" fish, the Ticunas sweep a lure back and forth through the water, but the gentleman (foreigner) uses a casting rod and reel.
The others (Brazilians, Peruvians, Cocamas, etc. ) catch fish wl th a draw net. They catch many.
Sometimes fishing is done with "verbascum·• poison, and then many fish are killed. HX
That's the way the Ticunas look for their food.
x All names of fish mentioned are from regional Spanish. xx Verbascum is a root which is prepared in a liquid form, and sprinkled over the water, paralyzing the fish.

MAKING MANIOC MEAL
When we first want to plant a manioc field, we work. First we slash the underbrush. Later we chop down the trees. Then we wait for the SlUl to dry it all. All the field gets well dried, and when we see that it is all well dried we set fire to it. The field burns well if it is well dried, but when it isn't well dried, it doesn't burn well. It doesn't give us a big job to do when it is well burned.
We just gather together the sticks that are left over. We cut those big logs into sections so that it will be clean so that we can plant the manioc well. We plant the manioc and then it grows. We know that it takes one year to be full-grown, and then we make it (manioc meal).
When it [the manioc] is in a place where the water doesn't flood, we make it (the manioc meal] early because it doesn't flood. But in low areas we make the manioc meal early because, then, suddenly there is a rise in the river and it floods. Then we mAke all the manioc meal.
We pull up all of our manioc, and then peel it. We soak it in water. We grate the other ~portion not being soakedl , and mix it [with the soaked manioc) to make a large amount. Then we toast it. If it is only grated, the manioc sticks together in balls, and doesn't dry out quickly. That is why we make a mixture of it. Then the manioc meal is good.

I'm goir.g to tell you a storg <.jKL't tilP time when I left school. I stayed in Leticia. I went there "n a Bltt.all steamer named WEPI. The steamer's capt:l,.ln took :;;ne there because a lady there had asked the captain for a boy. The l"'.aptain looked for a boy. He came in to Loretoyacu, and there he (the captain of the t-oat) found me. He asked the chief, and he said, "There is ~t very good boy [here]."
"Fine," said the WEPPs captain. "Where is my boy?"
"Here he is", said my grandfather, the chief.
";\ne," said the captain. He took me to Leticia, and he said, "This child is (in answer to] a request. A lady ha.s asked for him [because] she is \'hildless." (That is why he was looking for the child.) We arrived in Leticia in the late afternoon. He took me to his [a sergeant's] house. That gentlernan was a sergeant. He (the sergeant) was childless. There were j .1st the two of them. He took me there and said, "This is the child you requested. "
"Oh, is that so?" Fine. Now I'm happy," said the lady. The captain left me there. I stayed there. Later in the afternoon her husband, the sergeant, arrived. He came from the barracks. He saw me there.
"You've found another child?" he said. The sergeant was happy with me. "Look for a place where he can sleep," he said. She gave me one of their rooms. She gave me a mosquito net. She also gave me a bed so that I could sleep there. I sl.ayed there. She always went with me to the port in the morning. She took me to the port, >md gave me a wheelbarrow so I cnnld place in it m<~at, plantains, and whatever dse she bought. I took them to the house.
The sergeant went to the barracks. [First] ht <Ja.id to me, "Later on, go to the barracks". I arriv3d at the barr-ac~':s, LLP.Jt] at first they didn't
know me. The sentries didn't know what r went there for.
They said, "What do you want?"
"I'm going here to Sergeant Ortiz's place. He sent me here, Early
in the morning he ordr:red me to come here." I said. "What do you want"? they said.

Work in Leticia (Cont. ) ''I came here to get plantain peelings," I said. "Oh, is that so? Well, come in," he said. He sent me in (I went there) to the kitchen. I went to the cooks' place, and the cooks (soldiers) questioned me. "Aren't you hungry?" they said. "Don't you want this oatmeal?" "Oh, (is that so?) fine", I said. He gave me a bowl full of oatmeal. He had me eat it. When I finished it, I went home. I arrived at the lady's place. That is all.

TilE. HUNTER'S STORY
There is a legend that the old people tell. One time many people went hunting near a lake. (They always went hunting.) (One day) a man came upon the house •;t a panther. He saw him, and the panther got up and went to the man. The panther went round and round the man. The man returned from there. He arrived at their sleeping place, and told his companions. The others, his companions, didn't want to believe him. ''You're just lying. You're just afraid. There's nothing here," they said.
It was late afternoon, and they cooked their meal. They cooked a large
bird, and the head that was cooking began to spin around. "Chui, chui, chui," said the head of the bird that was being cooked.
"Look. That means we're going to die afterwbile. That's why this bird says that," said the one that had seen the panther. They threw out the bird head and ate.
Then it was night, and the one who had seen the panther didn't sleep. He listened and listened. At midnight he heard the panther at a distance. It said, "Moo-oo", like a cow. He called his companions, "Wake-up." That animal is right here," said the one who had seen the panther. He called, called, called, and called. (Butlthe other people slept very soundly, and didn't (want to) awaken. He ran and grabbed his spear. A palm tree was growing there. He flew [climbed) up into the tree. The ]panther arrived, and killed all of the man's companions. He killed them, and he finished [ate) them all. He smelled along the path until he came to the foot of the palm tree. He climbed up after him [the man 1, but the palm had a very slender trunk, and the panther just couldn't get up quickly. He slid down. He went up three times. He went up and returned [down] . The fourth time he got to where the man was. Then, right in the panther's neck he drove his spear. The panther kept going up further. He went higher and higher. There he (the man] took a good hold on the spear and drove it in until it reached the panther's heart. Then he lthe panther1 died, and he fell down. Immediately the man slid down. He pulled out his spear, and fled with it to the port. (From there the panther's companion came growling.) The man got to his canoe. He shoved it off and fled. On the bank growled the panther that would have eaten him, had he not fled quickly.

HOUSE CONSTRUCTION

First of all we look for the main posts. The posts are made pf wood from the heart of hard wood trees. Sometimes it is "huacapu" or "palo de sangre" or ''quenilla".x We go for them, and when we've brought them in, we take them to the place where we want to construct the house.

Then we look for poles: the long poles to fit over the posts, the beams, and the , rafters,. When they're gathered together, we set the posts-; and place the beams and rafters.

We place the ridge poles in the center so we can know where the high

est point (the ridge) is going to be.

-

When we have all ready, we tie on the leaves. When that is done, we weave the mat to fit over the ridge and fasten it on. We tie leaves on the gable-end of the house, and then make the palm bark floor. We look for small posts, beams, and palm bark slabs. We place the palm. bark and then the house is finished.

x very hard woods (regional Spanish "huacapu", "palo de sangre'\ and "quenilla")

The wficucha sent them for wood. TN! next day he sent them for water. He tied a string to his foot, and to them, so that they wouldn't escape. The turtle said to the woman, "Don't fool yourself. Don't think that he isn't going to kill us. That's why he sent us for wood and for water. This water is to boil us in. Let's go," said the turtle. They tied their strings to a small tree, and escaped.

WHAT THE FISH TREE DID
There was a man who made canoes. He chopped, and the chips of the tree turned into fish. He always went there and chopped, and arrived in the afternoon with fish. At last his wife spied on him. Then, when she had seen how it was that he always arrived with fish, the chips of the canoe didn't turn into fish anymore. He knew why it wasn't the same as at the beginning.
When he had finished the canoe, he, with his wife, pulled it to the stream. When they arrived at the bank, he made her get into the canoo. Immediately it turned over with her. The canoe closed arowtd her. The man turned into a bird; and sat upon the boat as it went floating in the water. She, the one who had spied, was inside the canoe in the water, and her husband sat on top of the canoe.
She cried from inside the canoe, and said, "My companion, open. it for me, I'm cold," and with that saying she wept.
The canoe drifted with her, and her companion sat upon it as it drifted along with her. She cried as it went drifting downstream. At last he flew away from her, and she continued drifting.

ABOUT RUBBER WORKING
Pro. geing to tell you a story about when I used to work for Raphael. He had a forest of rubber trees. I wanted to work ther :: I wanted to talk with Raphael to know if he would give me work. One day I went to his place. I went with my good friend, Victor. We asked Raphael, and he answered us. "Okay, but I don't have any tapping cups," said Raphael. He was very happy with us. He asked us, "When are you going to work?"
We told him, "We plan to enter into it this week. We're just going to check on the trail, " we said to Raphael.
"Okay," he said.
That day we went home. We went back here to Cacao island again. We stayed there a week. The next week came, and then one day we went there. We went by ourselves. We went to check first in th~ rubber forest to see where it was. I had gone there one time before, and saw the rubber forest there; so I knew where the work was. That's why we went there, but it was a long way. It took us three days to get there. We disembarked, and looked for the trail. We found the trail that same day. We knew where it was. The next day dawned. That day we made a small hut. We made ourselves a little hut so that we could do our work there. The next day our house was finished.
F~·om there we went to cheek on the trail to see where 1t was. The ·-ext day we had the rubber trail ready. We counted the rubber trees. They were sufficient. Later we started working them because it was impossible then, because we had come with just a little bit of food, and it was gone. Our food was gone. That's why we went home right away.

HOW FERDINAND'S WORK ENDED
I'm going to finish that first story I told. He had :mother work in that t:~mse. He had chickens that I took care of. Each morning I took care of them. There was corn. I gave it to them in the morning. There were thirty chickens in one of his pens. In another he had the same amount also. In another pen there were thirty of his chickens also. The sergeant had four fighting roosters for fighting.
There was another man like him. I've forgotten what his name was.
Every Sunday he [the sergeant] went to his the [other man's J place,
He made the roosters fight to see which one would win. He wanted his own rooster to winfand when it won he [the other manl paid him. That's how it happened fwinning ].
The sergeant's roosters had long spurs because he sharpened them to points. They were sharpened like needles. Those rooste1s were the sergeant's "pride and joy". That's why he prohibited anyone touching] them. That's how his roosters were.
There was one rooster that was the youngest of all, just recently developed. His name was Papuyu. That one had fought with an ordinary chicken , and he won.
The sergeant urged me to take extra care of those roosters. He urged me to take very good care of them. There was "their place" where I staked them out. They stayed there. I put them back in their pens at night. I always took care of them in the morning. One day a man, one of my people, arrived. He worked there. He said to me, "What kind of work does your boss have there at his place where you are working?" Thus said the man.
And I said, "Ah I don't know", I said. I asked the sergeant. I said, "What other kind of work do you have Mr. Sergeant?"
He answered me, saying, "Why do you want to know?" and I told him. "Okay", he said. "Where is the man? Let him come here. I want to talk with him because I have work in the pasture. You know where lt is.''
"Yes," I said.

How Ferdinand's Work Ended (Cont.)
''That'~ a job," said the sergeant. In the afternoon I went visiting, and I saw him (the man] again. I told him, and another day, in the morning, he went there [to the sergeant'sl
"Good morning, Mr. Sergeant," he said.
"Good morning, my son," the sergeant said. ''Is it true that you want to work?'' he said.
''Yes, Mr. Sergeant, because I'm not working anywhere," the man said. Then he {the sergeantl told him of his work. I went with him to tell him where he was going to work, and returned from there.
He worked there, and one day I went to check on him. First of all I went to take care of the sergeant's roosters. At noon, after eating, I went there because the order of the sergeant was that I go there. He had said, ''What's the matter that that work hasn't finished quickly? Isn't that man working?" he said.
"Ah, Mr. Sergeant. I didn't go to see."
"Later on, when you don't have any work here, go and check, " he said. I followed after the man then (but I tied up those roosters very well, and afterwards I went there). I arrived, and there he was, just lying on the floor. He wasn't working. I saw there that he wasn't working.
I questioned him. "Are you sleeping?" I said. I asked him.
"No. I'm just resting here, he said.
"The sergeant wants this work finished up quickly because he wants to give you another job," I said. Then I stayed there. I watched him there. I stayed for just a short time where the man was, and we talked just a little. Finally the hour had passed.[ it had gotten late].
In the afternoon I went home. I arrived at the house and. the lady said, ''I've got bad news," she said.

Bow Ferdinand's Work Encied (Cont. )
"What's happened, my lady?" I said. "Now tb~ B'~:rgeant is going to beat us. One of his fighting roosters bas P.. punctured eye," she said. "It got loose. Didn't you tie them up?'· she said. ''I tied them up before, my lady," I said. ''It was [done] very well." "One got loose. That old rooster that the sergeant forbade touching is the one that bas the pierced eye, " she said. I just kept quiet then. Then I went out to see, and truly it had a pierced eye. Be was blind. Then it was late afternoon, and the sergeant arrived. The lady told him. "One of your roosters is damaged," she said. I was out by the pens then, and the sergeant went out there. "Where is the rooster?" be said. "This is the one, Mr. Sergeant. ''Where were you that you didn't take care of this rooster of mine?" be said. The sergeant hit me then. Be gave me three slaps across the face. Be slapped me. He hit me three times With his hand (fist). Then be said, "Well, get going home right now. I don't want you any m01·e because you didn't take good care of this rooster of mine," the se:l:"geant said. ''I con't want to see you any more, " be said. And that was the end. 'fbe sergeant gave me just twelve pesos. That's all he gave me. That was all there was to my work that I liked so well at the beginning. It was just that man's fault that my work turned out badly.

EN D I

X

I. SENTENCE STRUCTURE

There are three main types of Independent Clauses: x

A. Declarative B. Query u C. Imperative

Each of the above three types is further divided into

1. Transitive 2. Intransitive

and again divided as follows:

(Transitive)

a) Simple Transitive Action: (chanacue "I shoot it") 33 5
b) Desiderative: (chanaxwa.e "I want it") 10(1( 3 35 54
(Intransitive)

a) Intransitive Action or Description: (chapuracU 3332
"I work" chame "I am good") 3 23
b) Being: (cori chixf "I am a gentleman") 3 1 211 2
c) Location: (chatiireg~;~. ''I am in the port") 33 5 4
d) Ownership: (chaxapata ''I have a house") 3 3 23
x Independent Clause may also consist of an interjection or response of various types, all of which are termed Fragments. ( dUcax "Laok. ")

n The term Query implies "a question for corroboration of facts (such as 'You did it?', 'He bought it?')", rather than just a "When? Where? Why? type of question (Interrogative)".

liXJl The Disiderative contrasts with Simple Transitive action

when Free Form Object occurs: nilxii chacua.

3113

3T

355

There are six types of Dependent Clauses;

A. Causal: (erii chame "because I am good")

32

3 23

B. Conditional: ft'~·.~ ' <1amexgu "if I am good")

. -~ . .;;

l 35 4

a C. Adverl)ja ; ( nax chamextic.a. "in order that I be good")

35 2

53525

D. 'u.:.tative: (a iiuxacu yea chaxti "how I went there")

315 5 5 5 14

3 23

E. Narrative Referential: ( i chamexgu "about when I was good")

4

5 315 4

F. Quote: (iiachartigii " thus I said") l 3 35

In most Ticuna sentences, the basic form is a Minimum Independent Clause (usually just a single verb):

chapuracU I work 33l 2

chidexa 32 4

I talk

Minimal Independent Clause sentences may be expanded by the addition of optional affixes:

chanapuracUxexe 3333223

I cause him to work

Minimal Independent Clause sentences may also be expanded by the addition of other words expressing conjunction, location, time, etc.

3 2 311 1

Complex ExpansionE are formed when a dependent clause is added to the independent clause:

chaPIJracll ern chame

3 132 32

3 23

I work because I am good

(The independent ch:,uS·:! is chapuracti "I work", and the 3 3 32

dependent ~lause is erti chame ''because I am good".)

32

J ri!.

Compound Expansions are formed when an independent clause is joined to another independent clause by a connective; or when the independent clauses are connected by a conjunction without the speaker pausing to take a new breath:

356

- inangtJ. i Diticbiawa ne naxu

3332

(the conjunction is rii) 5

Compound-Complex Expansions are formed when two independent clauses are joined by a connective and followed by a dependent clause:
- inangu i Ditichiawa ne naxu erii nataiya

He arrived; he came from Leticia because he was hungry.

Ticuna nouns are divided into seven classes:

N1 nouns are free nouns that may take suffixes: x

x Bound nouns are those nouns which must take some affix to complete their meaning. In Ticuna thinking, there are some items such as various body parts, relatives, etc. that must have an owner or belong to someone. Thus, one must use a prefi:XSilch as na- "his" when referring to a bound item such as -para "leg" • 23

ID. VERB CLASSIF1CATION

Ticuna verbs are divided into five main classes~ 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The class to which a particular verb stem belongs depends mainly on the relation of the verb stem to:

-the individual sets of person prefixes

-the< person referential prefix rii-
3

-the affixal objects na-/ ya-/ ya- "third person indefinite"

3

3

5

(the one that), or the special affixal objects used for Class V.

-the separate-word objects, of which the following are examples:

choxtl me; 35 3
etc.

cuxU you (sing.); nii:ldi he/she/it (general);

35 3

36 ,

The three individual sets of person prefixes used in declarative sentences are as follows:

prefix set (1)

prefix set (2)

prefix set (3)

Four of the five main classes previously mentioned may also be divided into two or three subclasses on the basis of the type of object used; i.e. affixal, or separate-word. Verb stems in:
subclass a) do not occur with object; x
subclass b) occur with separate-word objects; u
subclass c) occur with affixal objects to refer to third person indefinite, and separate-word object to refer to other persons.
Verb stems are indicated by underscore. Affixal objects are enclosed in parenthesis. See chart p. 364.

x An exception is made when the causative is added.
