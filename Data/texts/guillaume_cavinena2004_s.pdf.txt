Summary
This dissertation consists of a comprehensive grammatical description of Cavineña, an endangered language spoken by less than 1000 people in the Amazonian rainforests of northern Bolivia. Cavineña belongs to the small Tacana family together with four other languages (Araona, Ese Ejja, Reyesano and Tacana) and is possibly related (according to some claims) to the larger family of Pano languages. Very little is known of Cavineña and any other Tacana languages. This dissertation is the first full-length grammar of a language from this family. The grammar is primarily based on first-hand data collected in traditional communities during a total of 15 months (6 fieldtrips) from 1996 to 2003.
The grammar is cast in a functional-typological framework. It attempts to thoroughly cover most aspects of the language, with primary attention to typologically interesting features, such as its pitch accent system, predicate structure (11 structural slots, 50 affixes and two auxiliaries agreeing in transitivity), two subclasses of verbs (inflecting verbs vs. non-inflecting), three subclasses of nouns (e-nouns vs. kinship nouns vs. independent nouns), two classes of adjectives (predicative vs. attributive adjectives), bound pronouns which cliticise in second position, and switch-reference system.
The grammar consists of 20 chapters. It begins with 4 introductory chapters (the language and its speakers, the phonology, the notion of ‘word’ and a grammatical overview). The next 13 chapters detail the morphology of each word class together with the structure of the clausal constituents (predicate, noun phrase, postpositional phrases, etc.). The remaining 3 chapters deal with subordinate clauses (non-finite adverbial clauses, finite adverbial clauses and relative clauses). In the appendix are given two illustrative texts, fully analysed, with morpheme breaks, glosses and free translations. The relevant linguistic and anthropological literature is listed in the references.

Acknowledgments
My first and foremost debt goes to the Cavineña people, for their friendship, their hospitality and their serious commitment to helping me in every possible way in carrying out my work of documenting their language. Alfredo Tavo (from Puerto Cavinas), Emeranciano Sepa (from Misión Cavinas), Francisco Vaca (from Riberalta), Antonio Yubanera, Elio Tavo and Eli Mayo (from Galilea) were my main language consultants. They are to be thanked for the long and tedious hours spent day after day assisting me in the task of transcribing texts, explaining meanings and searching for additional examples. Others have contributed by recording texts (see full list in §1.8). Others would talk to me in Cavineña whenever we met, which I consider a great favour. The villagers of Galilea and Misión Cavinas, where I did my fieldwork, have always taken great care of my living conditions in their communities. They gave me a house to live and appointed various families to provide me with daily meals.
I started this project in 1996, thanks to Colette Grinevald, who welcomed me into her team of linguists revising the alphabets of the Bolivian lowland languages. She was the mentor I needed during my early years of linguistics and has been extremely helpful and supportive ever since.
I owe a great dept to a number of people and institutions for their financial help at all stages of the project: Région Rhône-Alpes (France), Graduate School of the University of Oregon (USA), Peter Muysken and his Spinoza project at the University of Leiden (Holland) and, above all, Bob Dixon and Sasha Aikhenvald from the Research Centre for Linguistic Typology (RCLT) at La Trobe University (Australia).
The present study has essentially developed at RCLT and owes a great dept to the linguists of this institution. Sasha Aikhenvald comes first. Her commitment and genuine interest in helping me write this grammar was way beyond her duties as a supervisor.

xxv
She has read and commented on every single chapter of this work, sometimes more than once, in an extraordinarily timely fashion. Bob Dixon has been a major source of inspiration throughout this work. I am also greatly thankful to all those who read through the whole draft of this grammar, or parts of it, and provided me with comments and ideas: Willem Adelaar, Andy Butcher, Hilary Chappell, Timothy Curnow, Carola Emkow, Carol Genetti, Andrew Ingram, Nicole Kruspe and Hein Van der Voort. Adam Bowles, publication assistant at RCLT, has also been excellent in proofreading many of the chapters.
At earlier stages, I also benefited from discussions and comments by Denis Creissels, Talmy Givón, Colette Grinevald, Doris Payne and Roberto Zavala.
I would like to thank Alec Coupe, my fellow PhD candidate, who occupied the office next door to me, for his invaluable help in the task of writing in English. My gratitude also goes to Siew Peng Condon, executive officer at RCLT, whose help went beyond her administrative duties, notably caring for our little boy Christophe during the last hectic weeks of writing the dissertation.
Last but not least, my warmest thanks go to Keiko, who went through the whole adventure with me, starting from Eugene (Oregon, USA), to Lyon (France), to Melbourne (Australia) and, unbelievably, to the Amazon jungle (Bolivia), with all possible love and support.

1 The language and its speakers
Cavineña is spoken by less than 1200 people who live in scattered communities in the Amazonian plains of northern Bolivia (South America). Cavineña belongs to the small Tacana language family, together with Araona, Ese Ejja (or Ese Eja), Reyesano (or Maropa) and Tacana. (See Map 1 for the location of Cavineña and its sister Tacana languages.) The language is named after the Franciscan Mission, Misión (Jesús de) Cavinas (which was most likely named after a Spanish name), where the Cavineñas were confined at the end of the 18th century (and where some Cavineñas still live today). (See location of Misión Cavinas in Map 2.) The term “Cavineña” is also the auto-denomination of the ethnic group. Ethnic Cavineñas include Cavineña speakers as well as non-Cavineña speakers. In Spanish, which is the lingua franca of Bolivia, “Cavineña” alternates with “Cavineño”, according to rules of gender agreement (e.g., una Cavineña ‘a Cavineña woman’ vs. un Cavineño ‘a Cavineña man’). In this study, however, the term “Cavineña” is used consistently, since there is no gender agreement in English.
1.1. Geographic location There could be from 1,700 (according to the socio-linguistic studies by PROEIB Andes 2000) to 2,104 (according to García Pérez 1998: 96) Cavineñas. These figures correspond to people that identify themselves as Cavineñas, not necessarily speakers of the Cavineña language.
Most Cavineñas still live in traditional communities. The main Cavineña communities are listed in Table 1.1. These are the most stable communities (new communities are regularly created while others frequently disappear) and those with which I am familiar. (See Map 2 for their location.) The table also mentions the number of the Cavineña population and the total population (i.e., including non-Cavineña people) for each community (the figures are from García Pérez (1998: 96) and

2 correspond to the year 1997).

Table 1.1: Main Cavineña communities (figures from García Pérez 1998)

Community Baqueti Bolivar Buendestino California Galilea Las Mercedes Misión Cavinas Peña Guarayo San Miguel Santa Catalina Total

Cavineña population 121 85 142 87 2561 33 91 80 41 119 1055

Total population 128 92 142 87 256 33 91 80 42 133 1084

All Cavineña communities, except two, Galilea and Mapajo/Santa Ana2 live east of the Beni river which corresponds to the administrative department of Beni. Galilea and Mapajo/Santa Ana are located on the western side of the Beni river, in the Pando administrative department.

Some Cavineña families also live in non-Cavineña communities, i.e., communities which are not traditionally Cavineña and where Cavineñas are often not in majority. This happens in Puerto Cavinas (120 Cavineñas of a total population of 224) and neighbouring Candelaria (97 Cavineñas of a total population of 268) (both located on the Beni river) and Australia, located on the dirt highway (44 Cavineñas of a total population of 231). (See location of these two communities in Map 2.) The total number of Cavineñas living in such communities, according to García Pérez, is 331.

Some Cavineñas have emigrated to the towns Riberalta (110 Cavineñas; Riberalta’s population is over 60,000) and Guayaramerin (38 Cavineñas;

1 This figure is wrong. Galilea (where I did 5 months of fieldwork) has probably at least 20 to 30 non-Cavineña people, consisting of families of teachers which often come from Riberalta. 2 The name Mapajo is given by García Pérez (1998) but I have also heard the name Santa Ana to refer to the same community. See more discussion in §1.4.

3 Guayaramerín’s population is over 30,000).3
The community of Mapajo/Santa Ana is located somewhere on the Bolivian side of the Abuna river (north of the Pando deparment, along the Brazilian border). Cavineñas from this community (49 people) have no contact with the rest of the Cavineñas; many Cavineñas are not even aware of their existence. They are said to have been ‘sold’ by the missionaries of Misión Cavinas as labor workers in 1940 (see §1.4).

1.2. Sociolinguistic situation

Although Cavineña is still spoken (and still learnt by some children), it is an endangered language. According to PROEIB Andes estimates, out of the total number of ethnic Cavineñas (i.e., 1,736, according to their studies), there could be 1178 speakers (i.e., 67.9% of the total population). Their figures are reproduced in Table 1.2.

Table 1.2: Language maintenance estimations (figure from PROEIB Andes 2000)

Cavineña ethnic group Monolingual in Cavineña Bilingual in Cavineña and Spanish Monolingual in Spanish Other languages (e.g., Portuguese) Level of retention

Percentage 100% 1.2% 66.7% 30.8% 1.3% 67.9%

Population 1,736 20 1158 535 23 1178

I basically agree with these figures, although I am suspicious of there still being any true monolingual speakers. All Cavineñas whom I met had a minimum of Spanish knowledge. From my (firsthand) experience with two Cavineña communities (Galilea and Misión Cavinas) and the town of Riberalta, I can complement the preceding table with the following remarks. The degree of maintenance of the Cavineña language varies from community to community. There appears to be a correlation between language loss and proximity to the town of Riberalta. In Misión Cavinas (and the nearby community of San Miguel where I had a short stay), which is amongst the most remote communities, Cavineña is the main means of communication between almost everybody, including between some young children. In Galilea, which is the closest
3 Riberalta’s and Guayaramerín population figures are taken from http://www.world-gazetteer.com/home.htm.

4 community to Riberalta, Cavineña is still the main means of communication among most adults and elders. Cavineña is also still used between adolescents and adults, but not between adolescents themselves. As for most younger children (below the age of approximately 12) Cavineña is neither used nor understood. In Riberalta, finally, Cavineña is no longer a means of conversation at all.
1.3. Physical environment, subsistance and culture
In this section, I provide a brief overview of the life of Cavineñas in their communities. More informations can be found in Camp and Liccardi (1980), García Pérez (1998) and Stahl (2002/2003).
The Cavineña communities are located next to rivers (e.g., Buendestino, Baqueti), small streams (e.g., Misión Cavinas, San Miguel) or lakes (e.g., Galilea) in well chosen upland terrains (which are never flooded). The northern-most communities are surrounded by vast areas of thick jungle (e.g., Galilea). In the south, however, the jungle is mostly restricted to stretches (of various widths) along the banks of rivers or lakes. Between rivers and/or lakes are vast patches of ‘pampas’ (i.e., grassland savannas). The climate is tropical with temperatures revolving around 35o celsius most of the year. The rainy season begins in October/November, and most of the areas around where the Cavineñas live become completely flooded until March/April. The dry season is from April to October and is sometimes punctuated by atmospheric perturbations brought by cold winds from the south. These perturbations are call Sur ‘south’ in Spanish and Beni in Cavineña (the same name as the Beni river, possibly because each blows and flows from the south). The temperature suddenly drops from 35o celsius to a low of (sometimes below) 15o celsius. The wind and the cold can last as long as 2 weeks and can be extremely uncomfortable for the people, who are used to hot weather, and who do not have insulated houses nor warm clothes.
The Cavineñas main means of subsistance in the traditional communities are hunting, fishing, fruit collection and slash-and-burn cultivation of banana, manioc, rice and corn. Some Cavineña communities are also involved in trading, usually exchanging brazil nuts for goods (oil, sugar, salt, soap, bullets, etc.) brought from Riberalta by merchants on the river. Some Cavineña men are hired by logging companies.

5 Cavineñas have an extremely fine sense of humour. They seem to joke about everything, all day long, with extremely sonorous laughter (this is especially true of Galilea). They enjoy having fiestas where they drink incredible amounts of ‘chicha’ (a fermented drink made of corn or manioc that they prepare themselves).
Cavineñas particularly enjoy giving nicknames. Every person in a Cavineña community has an official name and an official surname. The surname is composed of the father’s surname followed by the mother’s surname (this is according to Bolivian practices). In most cases, Cavineña surnames include one of the following ten: Achipa, Ayala, Camaconi, Cartagena, Mayo, Rutani, Sepa, Siripi, Tavo or Yubanera. However, these names/surnames are hardly ever used in daily life (they are only used for administrative purposes or with foreigners). Nicknames are used instead of names. The Cavineñas coin many sorts of nicknames. Nicknames are given according to something special that characterises a person or that has happened to a person. When I arrived for the first time in Galilea, after a long trip on the river, my face and my neck were completely red from the sun. I was given the nickname dudu mapa (beam carry, lit. ‘carry a beam’) because my redness made me appear similar to someone struggling to carry a heavy beam. Nicknames are often given (or changed) when someone loses temper (having a bad temper is seen as a terribly bad quality in Cavineña society). Antonio Yubanera recorded a story about how a man once got upset with his wife who had not cooked a fish the way he wanted. His anger was reported to others who searched for a nickname to “punish” him. They called him uwi ‘stain’ because the fish that caused the anger has many stains on its skin. I was also told that Rosalino Mayo (from Galilea) was once given the nickname bina kani ‘bat hole’ because he once lost his temper in a situation involving a kuyukuyu fish whose mouth resembles the holes bats make in trees (the exact reason of Rosalino’s loss of temper was not given to me). Cavineñas have special nickname-givers, i.e., persons with acknowledged skills in nickname-giving and which are consulted when someone needs to be “punished” for having lost their temper. The Cavineña language has special suffixes used to coin affective nicknames. They consist of one of two endings, chu or ku, which are added to part of an official name. I was often called Antuku from my (Bolivian) official name Antonio. Someone named Feliz is often called Felichu (see §12.7.8 for a full discussion).
Most Cavineñas are religious, although none of their ancestral beliefs appear to

6 have survived. The traditional and remote communities of the south practice Catholicism (which was introduced to them by Spanish Franciscan missionaries at the end of the 18th century). The more modern communities of the north practice Protestantism (which was introduced by SIL missionaries in the 60s and still promoted by Swiss and German Missionaries based in Riberalta).
1.4. History Very little is known of the Cavineña history, especially of the pre-contact period (i.e., before 1764 which is the date of the foundation of the first Cavineña mission).4 Before the first contacts with Spanish missionaries, the Cavineñas appear to have lived between the rivers Madidi and Beni (see Map 2). Traditional stories relating to this period mention the constant state of war between the Cavineñas and enemies identified as the present-day Ese Ejjas (from the same Tacana linguistic family).
The first contact with the Western World was probably made in the middle of the 18th century by Spanish Franciscan Catholic missionaries, who had already established a number of missions at the foot of the Andes (Ixiamas, Tumupasa, Rurrenabaque and Apolo; these missions were located in the actual Tacana territory; see Map 1) and were trying to expend their influence to the northern plains. The first Cavineña mission was established on the banks of a stream called Undumó, a tributary of the Madidi river, in 1764, under the name of Misión Esmeraldas, by the Franciscan Father José de Sosa.
Misión (Jesús de) Cavinas (where some Cavineñas are still living) was created a century later (around 1881-94), when the priests and the Cavineñas fled attacks from the Ese Ejjas. Misión Cavinas remained in the hands of the Franciscan Fathers until 1941. In 1940, a number of Cavineña families were ‘sold’ by the priests to a rubber company which took them away form the mission (they never returned; they correspond to the actual community of Mapajo/Santa Ana located near the Brazilian frontier on the Abuna river).
In 1941, American Catholics from the order of Maryknoll replaced the Franciscan

7 fathers. In 1958, a number of Cavineña men rebelled against the Fathers and their authoritarian practices. These Cavineñas were expelled from Misión Cavinas. They moved with their families to nearby rubber centres. Maryknoll priests ran Misión Cavinas until 1973. When they left, the priests sold the land and the cattle of Misión Cavinas to the local Bolivan Navy, leaving the Cavineñas with nothing but bad memories, an intruding military barrack, and a herd of cattle constantly damaging their houses and fields.
In the 60s, the American missionaries of the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) established their headquarters in Tumichucua (about 25km south of Riberalta; see Map 2). They started working with the Cavineñas in the early 70s (after having first worked with other indigenous groups). They provided education, training in various fields (health, mecanics, carpentry, etc.) and medical assistance. Two SIL missionaries, Elisabeth Camp and Millicent Liccardi, lived for long periods in the Cavineña community of Las Mercedes (see Map 2). They learned and studied the Cavineña language. They collected texts, compiled a dictionnary, wrote a grammatical sketch, elaborated learning books and translated the New Testament into Cavineña. They left in September 1985.
Swiss and German missionaries from the Misión Suiza (Swiss Evangelical Mission) settled in Riberalta soon after the departure of the SIL. Since then, they have been provided some assistance (notably medical; not educational), complementing what is nowadays provided by the Bolivian government.
The departure of the SIL also corresponded with the beginning of the political organisation of the Cavineñas, together with neighbouring indigenous groups (notably the Chácobos). In 1986, they created the Central Indígena de la Región Amazónica de BOlivia (CIRABO) (indigenous organisation of the Amazonian region of Bolivia). Based in Riberalta, this organisation is nowadays very active (even though it has very limited funds) in fighting for the rights of the Cavineñas and other Bolivian indigenous groups of northern Bolivia. Cavineñas main battle these days is (and has been for years) the right for a Tierra Comunitaria de Origen (TCO) (community land of origin) which would make them the owners of their traditional land.

8 1.5. Genetic affiliation
An overview of previous classifications of various languages or dialects into a Tacana family (starting with Brinton 1891, 1892) is in Girard (1971: 11 ff.) and is not repeated here. After the phonological and morphological reconstructions by Key (1963a, 1968, 1992 et al.) and Girard (1971), it is now accepted that the Tacana family consists of (at least) the five following languages (which are still spoken): Araona, Cavineña, Ese Ejja (the spelling ‘Ese Eja’ is used in Peru for same language), Reyesano (also referred to as Maropa) and Tacana, all descendents of a single Proto-Tacana language. Girard also subclassifies the five Tacana languages into three subgroups, according to phonological and morphological similarities, as follows: 1 — Tacana, Reyesano and Araona; 2 — Cavineña; 3 — Ese Ejja.
Girard’s (1971) and Key’s (1968) studies also attempt to link Tacana languages with the Pano languages (under a single Proto-Pano-Tacana language; following an initial suggestion by Schuller 1933). However, establishing the genetic affiliation between the two families will require more work and a better knowledge of the various Tacana languages. As Girard (1971: 145) acknowledges, “the problem … demands much more careful investigation … and much more material is required which at present is not available” and “when one attempts to correlate the two families … one is left with a meager corpus of allegedly cognate material — so meager indeed that the evidence for a Pano-Takanan (sic.) relationship seems only probable”.
There have also been suggestions of higher level groupings by Greenberg (1987) (together with the isolate Chimane-Mostén language of Bolivia, the Ge languages and the Carib languages). However, until more is known about Tacana languages (and Proto-Tacana), these links remain highly speculative and should not be taken as proven.
Cavineña is a uniform language with no dialectal variation. I could only identify a few minor differences between the speech of the modern communities of the north and the more traditional communities of the south. The absence of major differences was also confirmed to me by Cavineña speakers. The only differences appear to be lexical. For example, the people from Galilea normally say jetiama ‘many’ while the people from Misión Cavinas normally say umada ‘many’. Both words are synonymous and are

9 perfectly understood by all Cavineña speakers of both communities.
1.6. Bibliographic review The only general study of Cavineña available is the excellent work of Camp and Liccardi (1989) which consists of a Cavineña/Spanish (and Spanish/Cavineña) dictionary followed by a grammatical sketch. The dictionary consists of more than 3000 lexical entries. Each entry is provided with a word class specification (as defined in the following sketch), one gloss (sometimes two or more glosses when a word in not easily translatable by a single Spanish word), and one (sometimes two) full sentences providing a context for the word (each sentence translated into Spanish). The dictionary ends with a number of appendices listing identified affixes of the language, names of trees, birds, fish, expressions referring to the time of the day, snakes, monkeys, and kinship terms. The grammatical sketch consists of 95 pages. It identifies and exemplifies (with morpheme breaks and interlinear glosses) the main structures of the language, from morphology to complex clauses. This is done in a methodic and transparent way. The only criticism that I would make of this work is the absence of discussion and justifications for the proposed classificiation of the forms. Nevertheless, this work has been of invaluable help to me when I started my study of Cavineña. I could rapidly identify the main articulations of the language. Later on, the dictionary provided me with a fair number of forms and structures that did not occur (or only occurred once) in my own corpus.
In addition to the dictionary and the grammatical sketch, there are a number of short articles on particular aspects of the language. Brief discussions of the phonetics and phonology of Cavineña can be found in Key (1963a, 1968), Girard (1971) and Liccardi (1983). The pronominal system (which is probably one of the most complex areas of the language) is studied in Camp and Liccardi (1977, 19835) and Camp (1985) (there is also a discussion of pronouns in the grammatical sketch referred to above). A number of verbal suffixes coding notions of motion are discussed in Camp (1982). Camp (1983) discusses a number of structures equivalent to complementation in other languages (there are no true complex clauses in the language).
5 Camp and Liccardi (1983) is essentially a translation in English of Camp and Liccardi (1977).

10 Camp and Liccardi collected an extraordinary number of texts. Unfortunately, only a portion have been made available (many of them are in unreadable microfiche formats; see below). Four texts are available with morpheme breaks, glosses and translations in the appendix to Camp (1982) (one text), and the appendix to Liccardi (1983) (three texts). Also available and translated into Spanish, but not analysed morphologically, are Camp and Liccardi (1972) (14 texts), Camp and Liccardi (1973) (10 texts), Tavo (1977) (20 texts), and Tabo (1978) (17 texts).6 The two SIL missionaries also produced many learning books (such as Camp and Liccardi 1971, 1978; note that there are others but I could not access them) and translations of religious texts, notably the whole New Testament. When SIL missionaries left Bolivia in 1985, they transferred most of their field notes and collected texts (whether handwritten or typewritten) into microfiches. This represents a massive amount of data which is not published or accessible in any other format. Unfortunately, the great majority of this material is undecipherable (especially when it is printed). One reason is that microfilming was done in very poor conditions (Donald Pitman, p.c.). The full list is given in Table 1.3 (with the reference number, the title, the name of the linguist, and the number of pages; I do not have the number of microfiches per reference number).
6 Tabo and Tavo both correspond to the same person whose surname is (mistakenly) spelled differently in each reference.

12 The material produced by Camp and/or Liccardi uses an alphabet which is slightly different from the one used here. See discussion in §1.10.
The majority of the material cited above (except from Camp 1985) is published locally and does not have wide distribution (or is not published at all). However, most references (including the microfiches) can be ordered at the SIL library in Dallas (USA).
I started working on Cavineña in 1996 and produced the following studies. Guillaume (1996) is a report of an alphabet revision workshop conducted with a team of Cavineña speakers. Guillaume (1998) is a study of the phonetics and phonology of the the language. It notably includes an instrumental study of the vowels and the lateral flap consonant. Guillaume (2000a) consists of a study of a number of topics in the morphosyntax of Cavineña (notably voice and verbal morphology). Guillaume (2000b) is a short article discussing interesting verbal suffixes coding motion and deixis, from a typologial perspective. Guillaume (2002) is a revision of the instrumental study of the lateral flap given in Guillaume (1998).
Data on Cavineña (most often words) have also been collected since the first contacts with Westerners by missionaries and travellers. This is, for example, the case with Armentia and Quevedo (1906), which includes a number of paradigms (pronouns, numerals, verbs with various affixes), translations in Cavineña of various prayers, and a list of about 3600 forms. I have not investigated old material on Cavineña. I refer the reader to the anotated bibliography in Girard (1971: 177ff.).
Alfredo Tavo (one of my main language consultants; see next section), has been working for years on writing a history of his people. Unfortunately, Alfredo’s manuscript has not been published nor given away (although Alfredo has generously shared part of his findings, notably by recording texts relating to the past history of the Cavineñas).
1.7. Fieldwork Doing fieldwork in Amazonian Bolivia can be quite challenging. The fieldworker has to face an extremely difficult physical environment because of high heat and humidity,

13 mosquitoes and biting flies, and all sorts of diseases. The living and working conditions in the communities are very harsh, with no electricity, no running water (water needs to be boiled or carefully filtered), and often hardly any furniture (one has to sleep on a mat on the floor and chairs and tables are always hard to find). One hardly eats anything other than rice, manioc and bananas, occasionally complemented by fish, chicken or scarce jungle meat. Access to the communities is very difficult and hazardous, often requiring many days on rivers and/or non-asphalted roads. The difficulties of fieldwork in Amazonian Bolivia (and many other parts of Amazonia) most likely explains why so little linguistic work has been done in that part of the world and so little is known about these languages.
The present grammar is based on a total of 15 months of fieldwork. I first started working on Cavineña in 1996 in Tumichucua (a small village near the town of Riberalta; Tumichucua was the headquater of the SIL missionaries until 1985; see Map 2). I (together with other students) assisted Prof. Colette Grinevald in a 2 month (July and August) government sponsored project aiming at standardising practical alphabets for the Bolivian lowland languages. I was given the task of the revision of the Cavineña alphabet together with a team of Cavineña speakers from various communities. I met Alfredo Tavo (a 56 year old Cavineña man at the time) who has been one of my best teachers of Cavineña ever since. I collected lists of words and started working on the phonology of the language.
I returned to Riberalta for two months in 1997 (July and August). I met Alfredo again (Alfredo lives between Puerto Cavinas and Riberalta), and he introduced me to Francisco Vaca (a 40 year old man at the time). Franciso grew up in Misión Cavinas but settled in Riberalta in the late 80s. Francisco, similarly to Alfredo, had been trained by SIL missionaries doing linguistic work. He turned out to be an excellent teacher of Cavineña too. Alfredo also took me on a trip to visit the Cavineña communities. The trip ended quickly. After visiting three communities (Baqueti, San Miguel and Misión Cavinas) I caught severe amoebic dysentery and had to be evacuated immediately by light plane to Riberalta for adequate treatment. I decided to stay in town working with Alfredo and Francisco, asking them to tell me stories, which I would record and transcribe with their help.
I went back to Riberalta for two months in 1998 (July and August) and for one

14 month in 2000 (April). I again stayed in the town and kept collecting texts and conducting elicitation with Francisco and Alfredo, sometimes in my little hotel, sometimes at their houses. I managed to record a few texts from Francisco’s wife, Griselda Cartagena and Samuel Mayo, an old Cavineña who lives in Riberalta.
In 2001, I became more courageous and returned to the ‘real’ Cavineña world. I lived for five months in the community of Galilea (mid-March to mid-July) (see Map 2). To my surprise, nothing bad happened to me this time. I participated in the daily life of the community. I went fishing and hunting, played soccer, went to every single village meeting, church services and fiestas, drank quite a lot of chicha (corn or manioc beer), learnt to speak Cavineña, and started writing down what I was hearing around me. I collected many stories from all sorts of people and recorded conversations. I was assisted by the pastor of the community, Antonio Yubanera (who was about 45 years old) for the transcriptions and translations.
In 2003, I stayed a whole month in the remote Misión Cavinas (May) (see Map 2). The trip to Misión Cavinas (from Reyes; see Map 1), which took 4 days, is worth relating. The first day was spent in a bus on the dirt highway, reaching the village of Australia (see Map 2). The second days was spent on a motorcyle reaching Baqueti (see dotted lines on map 2). The third day was spent in Baqueti, waiting for someone from Misión Cavinas to fetch me (there was so much water on the paths that it was impossible for my motorcycle-taxi driver to take me any further). At 5pm, Victoria Tavo and her daughter (two Cavineña women from Misión Cavinas) arrived with an oxcart. The following day, we left at 1 am and it took 15 hours, at an average speed of 2.5km/h, to reach Misión Cavinas. A few days later, I asked Victoria to relate the trip. She gave me an extraordinary 45 minute-long retelling of the whole epic voyage. Many examples in this study have been taken from this text. Being in Misión Cavinas gave me the opportunity to work with Alfredo Tavo again (who lives in nearby Puerto Cavinas when he is not in Riberalta). He and I were given a house in the village. The time was spent recording new texts and especially revising the draft of this grammar. Unfortunately, Alfredo had to leave after 2 weeks. Emerenciano Sepa (a young man of about 35 years old) was asked to take over Alfredo’s task in helping me revise the grammar and transcribe texts, which he did perfectly.

15 1.8. Corpus
The corpus for this study consists of the following types of data: 1 — 59 recorded texts (about 3800 sentences). Two of these texts are provided with morpheme breaks, glosses and free translations in the appendix to the grammar; 2 — 4 recorded conversations (about 800 sentences); 3 — 20 texts written by my language consultants: 11 texts by Alfredo and 9 texts by Francisco (about 680 sentences); 4 — 65 published texts: 20 texts in Tavo (1977), 17 texts in Tabo (1978), one text in Camp (1982), 3 texts in Liccardi (1983), 14 texts in Camp and Liccardi (1972) and 10 texts in Camp and Liccardi (1973) (about 3500 sentences); 5 — fieldnotes examples (obtained either in controlled settings — elicited and volunteered examples — or during participant observation): about 3650 sentences (613 sentences in 1997, 952 sentences in 1998, 530 sentences in 2000, 560 sentences in 2001 and 1000 sentences in 2003); 6 — sentences from the Camp and Liccardi’s (1989) dictionary (about 3000 sentences).
The corpus does not include the data from the following sources: 1 — SIL translations of religious texts; 2 — SIL learning books; 3 — SIL microfiches; 4 — old sources (i.e., prior to the work of the SIL).
Each example provided in this study is accompanied by a code that refers to its origin. The codes are listed in the appendix to this Chapter.
Cavineña authors are listed in Table 1.4. The symbol ‘†’ means that the person has passed away. A question mark ‘?’ means that I do not have this information (the person corresponds to someone who worked with the SIL and whom I have not met). The second surname (recall that Cavineñas have two surnames, as any Bolivian citizen), i.e., the name of the mother, has not been included because I am not aware of it in most cases.

The program ‘Shoebox’ has been the main tool for analysing the corpus, building the lexicon and organising the data for grammatical analysis. Every single piece of data used in this study was entered into the Shoebox database (including the whole dictionary and all published texts).

The program ‘SoundEdit’ (on Macintosh platforms) was used to digitalise 31 of the recorded texts. Each sentence of every text was labelled and could be easily accessed and heard by a simple mouse click. (This avoided the daunting task of having to locate a particular word or sentence in the middle of a tape by using the forward and backward buttons.)

1.9. Linguistic type Cavineña has a fairly simple phonological system. There are 20 consonants and 4 vowels. The phonetic realisation of each segment varies very little. Syllable structure is (C)V. The accentual system (which is used to define the boundaries of phonological words) is unusual, involving complex combinations of high and mid pitches.
Cavineña morphology is agglutinative with a fairly high degree of synthesis, especially with verbs. The language has a very important set of enclitics (and only one proclitic) which are grammatically independent but phonologically bound. Cavineña is essentially a dependent marking language (following Nichols 1986).
Cavineña has three open lexical classes (verbs, nouns and predicative adjectives), ten closed grammatical classes (attributive adjectives, number markers, quantifiers, postpositions, pronouns, demonstratives, question words, particles, subordinate clause markers and coordinators), and two semi-open classes (interjections and onomatopoeia).
The predicate, which is headed by a verb, has an extremely complex structure, involving 11 structural slots, more than 50 affixes and (phonologically independent) modifiers. Verbs obligatorily require at least an inflectional affix when heading the predicate of a finite clause (in addition to other non-inflectional affixes). Verbs are subdivided between inflecting verbs (the inflection attaches directly to the verb root) and non-inflecting verbs (the inflection attaches to an auxiliary). Cavineña is extremely sensitive to transitivity. Most verbs are either intransitive or transitive (there are only two attested ambitransitive verbs). Intransitive non-inflecting verbs require an intransitive auxiliary while transitive non-inflecting verbs require a transitive auxiliary. Many verbal affixes have an intransitive form and a transitive form. The predicate in Cavineña does not make any reference to participants.
Nouns are subdivided between e-nouns which require a dummy prefix e- (they code parts of entities), kinship nouns which require possessor inflections (they are inalienably possessed), and independent nouns which are used as bare roots (they code fauna, flora, artefacts, etc.).
Predicative adjectives and attributive adjectives are two distinct word classes.

18 Predicative adjectives are used as copula complements while attributive adjectives are used as NP modifiers.
Cavineña has two types of pronouns: independent pronouns and bound pronouns. Independent pronouns fill NP or PP slots and can occur in any type of clause. Bound pronouns are enclitic in second position in main clauses only (they attach to the last phonological word of the first immediate constituent of a main clause). Independent pronouns and bound pronouns can co-occur in a single main clause.
Cavineña has many particles. These are bare roots which cannot take affixes. We recognise four categories of particles which differ in their degree of phonological and grammatical independence. Two categories of particles are enclitics: (1) second position particles cluster in second postion together with bound pronouns, and (2) phrasal particles attach (and modify) any type of phrase (NP, PP, predicate, predicative adjective, subordinate clause, etc.).
Cavineña has free constituent order. Grammatical functions are coded by a system of postpositions (on NPs) or suffixes on pronouns. The coding of core grammatical functions abides by a strict ergative pattern (there is no system of split-ergativity in Cavineña, as was previously thought). The postposition =ra (or suffix -ra) codes transitive subject (A function). The absence of a postposition (or a suffix) codes intransitive subject (S function) or object (O function). Oblique functions are also coded by postpositions (or suffixes on pronouns). The main oblique postpositions are associative, dative, genitive, locative, general locative, perlative and ‘up to’. Most postpositions are enclitics (they attach to the last phonological word of an NP). A few are separate phonological words and follow the NP.
Cavineña has three types of subordinate clauses which are marked by subordinate clause markers: (1) non-finite adverbial clauses (they require a non-inflected verb), (2) finite adverbial clauses (they require an inflected verb), and (3) relative clauses (they also require an inflected verb). Cavineña does not have complement clauses (but only complementation strategies) nor any coordinate clause type. There is a system of switch-reference which involves one type of non-finite adverbial clause (coding same subject) and one type of finite adverbial clause (coding different subject).

19 1.10. Writing systems Cavineña was first written when SIL missionaries began studying in Bolivia, starting with Key (1963b). This system is based on Spanish orthography (e.g., the phoneme /k/ is written qu before front vowels i and e and c before non-front vowels a and u). (See full discussion of Cavineña writing systems in §2.10.)
Key’s (1963b) alphabet was slightly modified in the subsequent work by Camp and/or Liccardi (e.g., they left out a grapheme for a glottal stop and a liguid l; these are not independent phonemes in the language).
In 1996, in the context of the educational reform for multicultural-bilingual education (Ley de Reforma Educativa, July 1994),7 I proposed a revised alphabet (Guillaume 1996), based on a more straightforward association between phonemes and graphemes (e.g., the two graphemes qu and c are replaced by k). The new orthographies were designed to make language reading and writing easier for children and to give the Cavineñas the feeling of having their own alphabet (as opposed to a mere Spanish alphabet).
The graphemes used in this study are basically these from Guillaume (1996) (except for two letters; see §2.10).
7 Information about the alphabet revison workshops conducted in Bolivia in 1995 and 1996 can be found in Grinevald (1995, 1996) and Bolivia Multi Étnica (1997).

20 Appendix to chapter 1 — List of example codes
In this study, each example receives a special code that indicates its origin. The code is located at the end of the free translation line.

Examples taken from the grammatical sketch of Camp and Licardi (1989) or one of their published articles are referenced to by publication and the page number where the example is cited, as in (1.1):

‘(While I was stitting there,) my sister (lit. my woman sibling) went to give me water (for me) to drink.’ (Camp and Liccardi 1989: 279)

Examples taken from Camp and Liccardi’s (1989) dictionary are coded by the two letters ‘di’ followed by a four digit number (the numbers refer to the order of the example in my database), as in (1.2):

‘You (sg) stay (lit. sit)! You (sg) don’t come!’ n1.0167

21

Examples from texts or conversations, whether from my own corpus or published collections, are coded by two letters which refer to the abbreviation of the title of the text followed by a three digit number which refers to the order of the example in my database, as in (1.4):

(1.4)

Ara-kware=ama ni=matuja=raA. eat-REM.PAST=NEG NEG=NOT.EVEN=cayman=ERG
‘(God protected me during that trip because) not even a cayman ate me.’ mj067

The full list of the codes for text examples is given below, together with the name of the text, the author(s) (recorded speaker(s) or writer) and the source (published, text or conversation recorded by me, or text written by one of my language consultants). First, note that the author of the texts collected by Camp and Liccardi are most often unknown; this is coded by a question mark ‘?’. Second, note that it is unknown whether any of the SIL texts were first recorded or directly written.

3 Grammatical vs. phonological word
In Cavineña, as in many languages, a distinction must be made between the grammatical word and the phonological word since these do not always coincide. We can have one phonological word made up of two (or more) grammatical words or one grammatical word made up of two phonological words.
In this chapter, we first give the criteria for both types of words in Cavineña (§3.1) (see Dixon and Aikenvald 2002) for a discussion of criteria for both types of word in a cross-linguistic perspective). We then discuss in turn the situations where the two types of words do not coincide (§3.2).
3.1. Criteria for grammatical vs. phonological word 3.1.1. Grammatical word A grammatical word in Cavineña has the following characteristics: 1 — a grammatical word in Cavineña can have one or more syllables (unlike a phonological word which requires at least two syllables, see §3.1.2 below). Examples are the locative marker =ju (one syllable), the numeral beta ‘two’ (two syllables), the noun matuja ‘cayman’ (three syllables) and the independent particle chamakama ‘finally’ (four syllables);
2 — a grammatical word in Cavineña can be mono-morphemic, as in the previous examples or multi-morphemic. Examples of bi-morphemic grammatical words are the noun e-na (NPF-water), the verb jikwi-tsu (cut-SS) and the predicative da-adjective kasa-da (strong-ASF). Examples of tri-morphemic grammatical words are the noun e-tawi-ki (NMLS-sleep-NMLS) ‘bedding’ and the verb neti-tsura-kware (stand-GO.UPREM.PAST) ‘stood up’. Nouns or adjectives are only mildly synthetic in Cavineña (they rarely consist of more than two or three morphemes). But verbs can have many more morphemes, as in ani-sikwa-sha-diru-wa (sit-GO.AWAY-CAUS-GO.PERM-PERF) ‘went and

52
made O sit elsewhere’ (with 5 morphemes).
What are the criteria for determining whether two morphemes are part of the same grammatical word or separate grammatical words? According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002: 19), the parts of a grammatical word ‘always occur together, occur in a fixed order and have conventionalised coherence and meaning’.
We can illustrate this with a number of forms in Cavineña with different statuses. The form kware (this is the verbal inflectional suffix -kware ‘REM.PAST’) encodes the meaning ‘remote past’, as in tawi-kware (slept). This morpheme can only occur together with a lexeme from the verb class and obligatorily follows it (*kware-tawi is ungrammatical). Nothing can occur between the verb and kware. Kware cannot occur with another other word class (e.g., with the noun chapa ‘dog’, as in ungrammatical *chapa-kware). The morpheme kware can therefore be analysed as part of a grammatical word (as opposed to be analysed as an independent grammatical word).
We can contrast -kware with a form such as beru ‘before, long ago’ (this is an independent particle) which is fully independent grammatically. Beru, similarly to -kware, can co-occur with a verb and directly follow it as in ina-kware beru (grabREM.PAST before) ‘grabbed long ago’ (di2802). However, unlike -kware, beru can also precede the verb, as in beru kueti-kware (before pass-REM.PAST) ‘pass long ago’ (bn007). Beru can even be discontinuous with the verb, as in inimetupu-kware esiri=kwana=ra beru (think-REM.PAST old=PL=ERG before) ‘the elders thought long ago’. The morpheme beru can therefore be analysed as a grammatically independent word (as opposed to being a part of an independent grammatical word).
A number of forms are grammatically less independent than beru but more independent than -kware. It is the case of =ama ‘NEG’ (this is the negative phrasal particle). When =ama occurs with a verb, it must follow the verb, as in jikwi-ya=ama (cut-kware=NEG) ‘did not cut’ (*ama=jikwi-ya is ungrammatical). However =ama is not restricted to occurring with verbs. It can also occur with nouns, as with place name Bolivar in Boliva=ama ‘not Bolivar’ or with a postposition as in e-kwaa=tsewe=ama (1-mother=ASSOC=NEG) ‘not with my mother’. Morphemes such as =ama, that we call clitics, even though having less flexibility than forms such as beru are nevertheless still

53
independent grammatical words. This is because, as we have shown, they are not bound to appear with a particular word class.

3.1.2. Phonological word
The phonological word unit, unlike the grammatical word unit, can only be defined by language internal criteria (Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002: 13). In Cavineña, a phonological word must have: (1) a minimum of two syllables (unlike a grammatical word which can be mono-syllabic; see §3.1.1 above) and (2) an independent Hn(M)M pitch contour (see §2.8).

Examples illustrating the assignment of the Hn(M)M pitch contour on phonological

words of various lengths are given in (3.1) (high pitch is coded by an acute accent on

top of a vowel while mid pitch is left unmarked):

(3.1)

béta

‘two’

2 syll

kímisha

‘three’

3 syll

jútákiju

‘therefore’

4 syll

wésá-tána-tsu ‘being lift and …’ (lift-PASS-SS)

5 syll

nétí-dírú-kware ‘went and stood’ (stand-GO.PERM-REM.PAST) 6 syll

In the chain of speech, the boundary between two independent phonological words is identified by a characteristic mid-pitch-high-pitch sequence. The mid pitch corresponds to the end of the preceding phonological word. The high pitch corresponds to the beginning of the following phonological word.1 In (3.2) below, we illustrate a number of phonological word sequences taken from texts:

(3.2) a. péadya úra

one

hour

‘one hour’ mj104

c. jútákiju ré-keja therefore here-LOC.GNL ‘therefore (I’m going) this way’ ba037

1 Note that this is true as long as this pattern is not overriden by a different pitch contour such the utterance-final contour (§2.9.1), the emphatic contour (§2.9.2) or the intensifier contour (§2.9.3).

b. pére

émake

tied.sticks under

‘under the raft (lit. tied sticks)’ mj055

3.2. Mismatch between grammatical and phonological words All examples of phonological words illustrated above correspond to one grammatical word, in which case both word units (grammatical and phonological) match one another. However, not all phonological words correspond to a single grammatical word, and not all grammatical words correspond to a single phonological word in Cavineña. There can be two types of mismatch: 1 — one phonological word consisting of more than one grammatical word. This happens with clitics and is discussed in §3.2.1; 2 — one grammatical word consisting of more than one phonological word (normally two). This happens with full reduplication and is discussed in §3.2.2.
3.2.1. One phonological word = two (or more) grammatical words Cavineña has an important number of grammatical words which are prosodically deficient. These morphemes, called clitics (and written with an equal sign ‘=’ in the examples), although qualifying as independent grammatical words (according to the criteria set out in §3.1.1 above) do not qualify as independent phonological words. They do not receive the phonological word Hn(M)M pitch contour independently but incorporate a (or simply attach to an already independent) phonological word. In Cavineña, all clitics but one (ni= ‘NOT.EVEN’) link to the preceding word (and can be referred to as enclitics). The clitic ni= is the only proclitic, linking to a following word.
In connected speech, the mid-pitch-high-pitch sequence that characterises the juncture between two independent phonological words does not occur at the juncture between a clitic and the preceding phonological word. This can be illustrated by comparing the juncture between the two phonological words in (3.2a) (repeated) with the juncture between a phonological word and a clitic (postposition) in (3.3) below:

55

(3.2a)

péadya úra

one

hour

‘one hour’ mj104

(3.3)

éspéré=keja

(*éspere=kéja)

NPF.creek=LOC.GNL

‘toward the creek’ ba037

In both examples, we have a sequence between two grammatical words with the same number of (five) syllables. But in (3.2a), the prosody is HMMHM (two different phonological words, each receiving the Hn(M)M contour separately), while in (3.3), the prosody is HHHMM (only one phonological word which receives the Hn(M)M contour).

The next pair of examples contrasts the two independent phonological words of (3.2b) (repeated) and a sequence of one phonological word followed by two clitic morphemes (plural marker and ergative marker) in (3.4):

(3.2b)

pére

émake

tied.sticks under

‘under the raft (lit. tied sticks)’ mj055

(3.4)

chápá=kwána=ra dog=PL=ERG ‘dogs’ ba074

(*chápa=kwána=ra)

Here again, we have two sequences with the same number of syllables but in one case (in (3.2b)) the Hn(M)M pattern applies twice, independently to the two different phonological words while in the other case (in (3.4)), the pattern applies once to the whole sequence.

In (3.5), we provide examples of phonological words consisting of various numbers of grammatical words (from 2 to 4) and with various length (from 3 to 9 syllables):

(3.5) a. 3 syllables yáchi=ju é-na=ra tú-wa=tu é-ra=mi

‘in the pampa’

(pampa=LOC)

‘the water’

(NPF-water=ERG)

‘there, they…’

(there-LOC=3SG)

‘I (will tell) you…’ (1SG-ERG=2SG)

56
ba012 ba023 mj008 sl003

b. 4 syllables chápá=kwana kwábá=tsewe jádyá=tibu

‘dogs’ ‘with the canoe’ ‘because of that’

(dog=PL) (canoe=ASSOC) (thus=REASON)

ba030 mp021 pa088

c. 5 syllables jádyá=tíbu=tu míkwáná-keja íyé-yá=tibu

‘because of that he…’ (thus=REASON=3SG) ba024

‘to you’

(2PL-LOC.GNL)

pa058

‘because it kills’

(kill-IMPFV=REASON) ba023

d. 6 syllables páé=kwáná=keja ésírí=kwána=ra

‘to the priests’ ‘the old ones’

(priest=PL=LOC.GNL) sd001

(old=PL=ERG)

mj046

e. 7 syllables kwínáná-núká-ya=dya ‘emerge again’
(emerge-REITR-IMPFV=FOC) mj070

f. 8 syllables
ájá=búchá=táá=tu-ke monkey=SIMLR=EMPH=3SG-FM ‘(I was hearing something) like a monkey’ aj008

3.2.2. One grammatical word = two phonological words The opposite mismatch between the grammatical word and the phonological word in

57

Cavineña occurs with full (but not partial) reduplication. Here, one grammatical word

(the reduplicated word) consists of two phonological words (the two non-reduplicated parts). Both parts receive the Hn(M)M independently, as illustrated in (3.6):

(3.6) a. reduplication of a 2 syllables word

míri-míri

(strike-REDUP) (*mírí-miri)

ba144

b. reduplication of a 3 syllables word kwínana-kwínana (emerge-REDUP) (*kwínáná-kwínana) sl026

The requirement that both parts of a reduplicated word be separate phonological words (with a minimum of two syllables and with independent Hn(M)M contours) is

also reflected in the fact that when a mono-syllabic root is reduplicated, each part is

incremented by a (proparaleptic) vowel -u ‘PROP’ (see §2.7.6), as in (3.7):

(3.7) reduplication of a 1 syllable root

bá-u-bá-u (see-PROP-REDUP-REDUP) (*bá-ba)

n5.0342

tyá-u-tyá-u (give-PROP-REDUP-REDUP) (*tyá-tya)

n5.0343

3.3. Mono-syllabic grammatical words Since a phonological word requires at least two syllables, mono-syllabic roots never form a phonological word by themselves. They always require an additional syllable. The additional syllable is provided by two processes in Cavineña: affixation or cliticisation (but not vowel lengthening).
Many Cavineña mono-syllabic roots belong to word classes whose members are all (or most of all) clitics (whether mono- or poly-syllabic). For these mono-syllabic roots, the additional syllable is provided by an adjacent phonological word to which they attach. This is the case with the postpositions =ra ‘ERG’, =ju ‘LOC’ and =ja ‘DAT/GEN’ (§4.5.1 and Chapter 14), the subordinate clause markers =ra ‘PURP.MOT’, =ju ‘DS’, and =ke ‘LIG’ (§4.5.6, Chapters 18, 19 and 20), the second position particles =pa ‘REP’ and =ni ‘MAYBE’ (§4.5.5 and Chapter 16), and phrasal particle =dya ‘FOC’ (§4.5.5 and Chapter 17).
There are also mono-syllabic roots which belong to word classes whose members

58
are independent phonological words (not clitics). With some word classes, the root is never found without at least one affix. This is the case with the pronominal root mi- ‘2’ and adverbial demonstrative root re- ‘here’ (§4.5.2 and Chapter 15) and with the five mono-syllabic predicative da-adjectives ba- ‘cold’, de- ‘deep’, ji- ‘good’, mu- ‘scary’ and tsa- ‘scary’ (§4.3 and §11.2).

However, with the word classes of verbs (notably inflecting verbs) and nouns (notably e-nouns), there are contexts where roots can be found without affixes. In the remainder of this section, we discuss the various ways mono-syllabic verbs and monosyllabic nouns form independent phonological words in such contexts.

There are ten mono-syllabic inflecting verbs, as given in (3.8) (sorted according to

their transitivity values). (Note that all non-inflecting verbs are poly-syllabic.)

(3.8) a. je- ‘come’ b. a- ‘affect O’

ju- ‘be’

ba- ‘see O’

kwa- ‘go’

be- ‘bring O’

pa- ‘cry’

ryu- ‘comb O’

tsa- ‘laugh’ c. tya ‘give O to O’

Mono-syllabic verbs make a full phonological word by the following means: 1 — addition of a verbal affix, as in né-kwa (HORT.DL-go) and tsá-ya (laugh-IMPFV). Note that the verb of any main verbal clause requires an inflectional affix;

2 — addition of a (proparaleptic) vowel -u ‘PROP’, as in bá-u ‘see-PROP’ and bé-u ‘bring-PROP’. This happens when no verbal affix can be included with the verb, as in the antipassive full reduplication (§8.3.1), or when a verb is used in a main clause without the (otherwise obligatory) inflection (this has stylistic effects; see §6.1.6);

3 — addition of a clitic. This happens with non-finite adverbial clause markers, as in jú=ishu (be=PURP.GNL), á=ra (affect=PURP.MOT) and jé=wie (come=JUST.BEFORE);

4 — procliticisation of the verb onto a following (verbal) modifier. This happens with auxiliary-taking postposed markers (§10.4), as in jú=péadya (be=ONCE) and jú=kímisha (be=THREE.TIMES). Note that there no attested instance of verb encliticisation;

59

There are five mono-syllabic noun roots which all belong to the e-noun subclass,

as given in (3.9) (nouns from other subclasses, i.e., kinship nouns and independent

nouns, are all poly-syllabic):

(3.9)

-bi ‘arm’

-tse ‘tooth’

-ka ‘egg’

-wi ‘beak’

-na ‘water’

Nouns from the e-noun subclass obligatorily take a dummy e- prefix (whether they are mono- or poly-syllabic) (see §12.3.1). As such the mono-syllabic e-nouns can form independent phonological words (thus e-bi ‘arm’, e-ka ‘egg’, etc.). However, in some contexts, they lose the prefix. This notably happens when they are modified by a preceding juxtaposed noun. When this happens with mono-syllabic e-nouns, these forms are encliticised to the juxtaposed noun (thus dáti=ka ‘tortoise egg’, kwéri=na ‘river water’, etc.) The e- prefix is also lost in various derivational processes. All derivational processes involving nouns are marked by affixes. As such, mono-syllabic e-noun form independent phonological words together with the derivational affix (e.g., with the adjectiviser -ma ‘WITHOUT’ in tsé-ma ‘toothless’).

3.4. When a phonological word only consists of clitics It was observed that in some cases, one phonological word could only consist of clitics. This appears to happen in the examples given in (3.10) (note that (3.10c) is (T1.5)) (separate phonological words are between square brackets):
(3.10) a. … [é-na] [=tséwe=dya]… NPF-water =ASSOC=FOC
‘(This time, I arrived) with water.’ sd101

b. … [píshika] [métro] [=túpú=dyane]…

five

meter =UP.TO=APPROX

‘(I could see the anteater) at about five meters away (from me).’ ba118

60
c. … [kwéjá-wa=ju] [=tú-kéO =ékwanaA]… tell-PERF=DS =3SG-FM =1PL(-ERG)
‘When they told (that to us), we (first thought that) it (was not serious).’ ao005
In (3.10a), we would expect a single HHHMM pitch contour coding a single phonological word since =tsewe ‘ASSOC’ is a clitic. However, what occurs is a sequence of a HM contour followed by an HMM contour which suggests that there are two different phonological words.
In (3.10b), we would expect a sequence of a HMM contour followed by a single HHHHMM contour since =tupu ‘UP.TO’ is a clitic. However, what we have is a sequence of a HMM contour followed by a HM contour followed by a HHMM contour, which suggests that there are three different phonological words.
In (3.10c), we would expect a single HHHHHHHMM contour since =tu-ke ‘3SG-FM’ is a clitic. However, what happens is a sequence of a HHMM contour followed by a HHHMM contour which suggests that there are two different phonological words
In these three examples, it appears that a clitic followed by another clitic begins a new phonological word. As a result one phonological word only consists of clitics. However, this issue has not been fully investigated yet. It could be the result of a specific intonational contour which has not been identified yet (recall that the Hn(M)M pitch contour which defines a phonological word can be modified by specific intonational patterns such as the utterance-final contour, the emphatic contour and the intensifier contour discussed in §2.9).

4 Grammatical overview
This chapter is an overview of Cavineña grammar. The first section lists the grammatical words classes (§4.1). The next four sections present each word class within its superordinate phrasal environment: predicate structure and verbs (§4.2), predicative adjectives (§4.3), NP structure, nouns and NP modifiers (attributive adjectives, number marker and quantifiers) (§4.4), and remaining word classes (postpositions, pronouns, demonstratives, content question words, particles, subordinate clause markers, interjections and onomatopoeia) (§4.5).
Clause structure is the topic of §4.6. We first present the structure of basic main clauses (§4.6.1), followed by a discussion of grammatical functions (§4.6.2). Other types of clauses are discussed next: copula clauses (§4.6.3), imperative and hortative clauses (§4.6.4), interrogative clauses (§4.6.5) and negative clauses (§4.6.6). Dependent clauses are introduced in §4.7. The last section discusses coordination (§4.8).
4.1. Word classes Classes of (grammatical) words are determined by morphological possibilities and syntactic behavior. Cavineña word classes are listed in Table 4.1 (the phonological status of each word class is given in the right column).

We can make the following remarks: — Cavineña has two different word classes of adjectives: predicative adjectives (these function ‘predicatively’ as CC complements but not attributively) and attributive adjectives (these function attributively as NP modifiers, but not predicatively); — Cavineña does not have specific classes of adverbs. Concepts of manner (e.g., well, fast, etc.), location (e.g., upriver, here, etc.) and time (e.g., today, tomorrow, etc.) are either expressed by predicative adjectives (used adverbially), particles or demonstratives.

4.2. Predicate and verbs
The predicate consists of a verb and its modifiers. The predicate can be simple (the verb takes all verbal affixes; in this case verb structure matches predicate structure) or complex (involving an auxiliary; in this case verb structure and predicate structure do not match). Predicate structure is presented in §4.2.1. Verbs, which head the predicate, are discussed in §4.2.2.

63 4.2.1. Predicate structure
The predicate in Cavineña can be described in terms of 11 structural slots (from A to K), as shown in the following slot diagram:
Slot A: Inflectional prefixes Slot B: Preverbal modifiers Slot C: Valency-changing prefix Slot D: Verb root Slot E: Auxiliary Slot F: Postural and directional suffixes Slot G: Valency-changing suffixes Slot H: Aktionsart suffixes Slot I: Mode suffixes Slot J: Postverbal modifiers Slot K: Inflectional suffixes

A brief description of each slot is given below: — Slots A and K are filled by obligatory (thus inflectional) markers. There can only be one morpheme per slot at a time. There are prefixes that go into slot A (as in (4.1a)), suffixes that go into slot K (as in (4.1b)) and circumfixes that go into both slots A and K (as in (4.1c)). (Superscript capital letters refer to structural slots within the predicate structure while subscript capital letters refer to core grammatical functions.)

‘(Get down from the motorcycle and cross the bridge first! Otherwise,) we

— Slot B and I are filled by optional auxiliary-taking modifiers. These modifiers prevent the verb from taking inflectional affixes (slot A/K). Inflectional affixes are obligatorily attached to an auxiliary (in slot E). Slot B is filled by phonologically independent words, as with pana ‘PROPERLY’ in (4.2a). Slot I is filled by suffixes, as with -kara ‘DESID’ in (4.2b) (note that this is (T1.10)). The auxiliary-taking marker jadya/ejebucha …-e ‘MAN’ is discontinuous and fills both slots B and I, as shown in (4.2c):

(4.2)

‘This is the particular way our grandfathers used to live (lit. sit) in that land (constantly at war with Ese Ejja people, not in peace as Cavineñas live nowadays).’ hs041

— Slot C and G are filled by affixes used to modify the valency of a verb. There is a circumfix (reflexive ka-…-ti) that goes into both slots C and D (as in (4.3a)) and suffixes that only go in slot G (as with passive -tana ‘PASS’, in (4.3b));

‘For that reason (i.e. in Cavineña communities, there aren’t any motorised vehicles), this (rudimentary) cart is used in these places.’ ft023

— Slot D is obligatorily filled by a verb root, either an inflecting verb (as in the previous examples), or by a non-inflecting verb, as with mere ju- ‘work’ in (4.4):

(4.4)

Junio=ju e-diji=ju

mereD juE-kwareK.

June=LOC NPF-path=LOC work be-REM.PAST

‘In June I was working on the road.’ n5.0116

— Slot E is filled by an auxiliary. There are two auxiliaries: ju- ‘be’ (intransitive) (as in mere ju- ‘work’ in (4.4)) and a- ‘affect’ (transitive), as in bidubidu a- ‘wag O’ (4.5) (see also (4.2)). An auxiliary is (normally) obligatory if the verb is non-inflecting.

— Slot H is filled by optional Aktionsart suffixes. These suffixes — there are about 30 of them — encode notions of aspect/manner, time of the day, motion and emotion. The Aktionsart -nuka ‘REITR’ is illustrated in (4.7):

(4.7)

[TunaS ju-diru-wa=ju]

‘When they arrived, we (dl) put our bags down in the cart (and we went on foot).’ vb055

Some Aktionsart suffixes are mutually exclusive. Some others are not and can co-occur in the slot (up to three at a time).

— Slot J is filled by auxiliary-taking modifiers which are phonologically independent. These markers are use to specify the number of times an event is performed, as with beta ‘TWICE’ in (4.8):

(4.8)

[KakemitiD betaJ]

juE-kwareK be-REM.PAST

‘She got married twice.’ mu049

Our presentation of the structure of the predicate can be completed by the following two remarks: — only verbs can head the predicate; — the predicate does not make any reference to the arguments of the clause (whether core — S, A, O — or oblique — dative, associative, locative, etc.).

4.2.2. Verbs Verbs in Cavineña only function as head of the predicate. They cannot head an NP unless they are nominalised. They cannot be used as NP modifier unless they are used

67 within a relative clause.
Verbs can be subdivided between: 1 — inflecting verbs which directly take affixes (e.g., tawi- ‘sleep’, peta- ‘look at’); 2 — non-inflecting verbs which cannot carry any affix and require an auxiliary for this purpose (e.g., mere ju- ‘work’, kwatsabiji a- ‘talk to O’).
Both inflecting verbs and non-inflecting verbs can be further subdivided between: 1 — intransitive verbs (i.e., with one core argument S). Non-inflecting intransitive verbs require the intransitive auxiliary ju- ‘be’, as in (4.4), while non-inflecting transitive verbs require the transitive auxiliary a- ‘affect’, as in (4.5); 2 — two extended intransitive non-inflecting verbs (i.e., with two core arguments S and E): bawe ju- ‘know E’ and baekwa ju- ‘not know E’; 3 — transitive verbs (i.e., with two core arguments A and O); 4 — ditransitive verbs (i.e., with three core arguments A, O and O);1 5 — two S=A ambitransitive inflecting verbs (i.e., either with one core argument S or with two core arguments A and O): kike- ‘scream, scream at O’ and kwina- ‘give birth, give birth to O’.
Inflecting verbs and non-inflecting verbs behave differently with regard to derivation and borrowing, as follows: 1 — the subclass of inflecting verbs is open to derivation (from nouns and predicative adjectives) but closed to borrowing; 2 — the subclass of non-inflecting verbs is open to both derivation (essentially from inflecting verbs) and borrowing.
Verbs are discussed at length in §5.2 (inflecting verbs) and §5.3 (non-inflecting verbs).
4.3. Predicative adjectives In Cavineña, we need to distinguish between two different word classes of adjectives: 1— Predicative adjectives primarily function as copula complement (as with ari- ‘big’
1 It will be seen that the two Os are treated identically by Cavineña grammar.

68 in (4.9a)). Predicative adjectives can also function as adverbs and secondary predicates. However, they cannot function as NP modifiers, unless they are used within a copula relative clause — in which case they are marked with the relative clause marker =ke ‘LIG’ — as with ari- ‘big’ in (4.9b):

(4.9)

a. Ari-daCC ju-kwareCP ajaCS. big-ASF be-REM.PAST monkey

‘The monkey was big.’ aj025

b. E-kwe ani-kware

[maletero ari-daCC=keRC]S.

1SG-DAT sit-REM.PAST bag

big-ASF=LIG

‘I had a big bag (lit. a big bag sat to me).’ mj052

2 — Attributive adjectives only function as NP head modifiers. They cannot function as copula complement, adverb or secondary predicate. They have therefore been assigned to a different word class (see §4.4.3).

Predicative adjectives are further subdivided into two subclasses on morphological (but not syntactic) grounds: 1 — da-adjectives consist of a closed subclass of about 110 to 120 bound roots which must take an affix (minimally a dummy suffix -da ‘ASF’; as with ari- in (4.9a)) or be reduplicated; 2 — independent adjectives consist of an open subclass (of at least 40 to 50 basic roots) which do not require to take any affixes or be reduplicated. They never take the -da dummy suffix, as shown in (4.10):

(4.10)

PureamaCC (*pureama-da) =ekwanaCS ju-kwareCP…

happy

=1PL

be-REM.PAST

‘We were happy…’ ga008

Da-adjectives and independent adjectives code the typical adjectival notions of DIMENSION, AGE, VALUE, COLOUR, PHYSICAL PROPERTIES, HUMAN PROPENSITIES, etc. (as per Dixon 1982, 2004). Da-adjectives tend to code positive concepts while independent adjectives tend to code negative concepts, as shown in (4.11):

69

(4.11) da-adjective

independent adjective

ari- ‘big’

achacha ‘small’ (DIMENSION)

nana- ‘young’

esiri

‘old’ (AGE/VALUE)

juji- ‘fat’

ushuri ‘skinny’ (PHYSICAL PROPERTY)

Note that this is only a tendency as some negative concepts can be coded by da-adjectives (e.g., da-adjective baji- ‘scared’) and positive concepts can be coded by independent adjectives (e.g., pureama ‘happy’).

Predicative da-adjectives are closed to both derivation and borrowing. Predicative independent adjectives, on the other hand, are open to both processes.

Predicative adjectives are discussed at length in Chapter 11.

4.4. Noun phrase — nouns and NP modifiers

4.4.1. NP structure

The noun phrase in Cavineña can be described in terms of 8 structural slots (from A to

H), each associated with a particular type of constituent, as shown in the following slot

diagram and illustrated by the cross-referenced examples:

Slot A: Relative clause

(4.36)

Slot B: Quantifier

(4.12c), (4.14), (4.23), (4.37)

Slot C: Genitive modifier

(4.12a), (4.12c), (4.28)

Slot D: Juxtaposed noun

(4.12a), (4.18), (4.39)

Slot E: Head noun

(4.12a), (4.12b), (4.12c), (4.14)

Slot F: Attributive adjective (4.12b), (4.20)

Slot G: Number

(4.12b), (4.12c), (4.21), (4.23), (4.31)

Slot H: Relative clause

(4.12c), (4.14)

Examples illustrating the co-occurrence of various NP constituents are given in (4.12) (note that the situation where all NP slots are filled at the same time is never encountered). (Recall that superscript capital letters refer to structural slots within the NP while subscript capital letters refer to grammatical functions.)

Only a noun can head an NP even though the nominal NP head is often ellipsed (and recovered from the context), as in (4.13):

(Note that some NP modifiers — genitive modifier, juxtaposed noun and attributive adjective — obligatorily require an overt head).

Verbal relative clauses (RC) normally fill slot H, as in (4.14):

enemies kill=PURP.MOT go-REM.PAST=LIG

‘What is the name of the four men (lit. persons) who went to kill the enemies?’ mk098

Slot A is normally filled by very particular types of copula RCs, notably demonstrative copula RCs. Demonstrative copula RCs consist of a pointing demonstrative (§4.5.3) in CC function within a copula clause that is relativised (with obligatory deletion of copula predicate). An example is given in (4.36). This serves as a strategy to remedy the fact that Cavineña does not have specific nominal demonstratives (i.e., demonstratives used within NPs) (but only adverbial demonstratives).

RCs are marked by the enclitic subordinate clause marker =ke ‘LIG’ (§4.5.6). This marker is deleted when it occurs in the same clitic sequence with a postposition and when it precedes the postposition, as shown in (4.15):

(4.15)

‘The woman who had gone to milk saw us.’ n1.0585

4.4.2. Nouns Nouns in Cavineña are the only word class that can be the head of an NP (in slot E).2 Nouns can also function as (juxtaposed) modifiers of a noun in an NP.
There are three subclasses of nouns distinguished by morpho-syntactic criteria: 1 — e-nouns consist of a closed class of about 100 to 150 terms which must take a dummy prefix e- ‘NPF’ (realised as y- before the vowel a). This prefix drops in a number of circumstances. E-nouns code parts of entities, such as -atsanaka ‘mouth’ and -wachi ‘foot’ shown in (4.16):

2 It will be seen that independent pronouns can fill NP slots (§4.5.2). Unlike nouns, however, independent pronouns make a full NP by themselves (i.e., they cannot take any NP modifiers). They are not, strictly speaking, the head of an NP.

e-wachiE=ju. NPF-foot=LOC
‘He (a cayman) opened its mouth, and almost bit my foot (lit. almost bit me on the foot).’ lg013

2 — kinship nouns consist of a closed small class of about 30 terms which are (obligatorily) inflected for the person of their possessor. They code kinship relations such as wane ‘wife’ (as in (4.17), tata ‘father’, wane ‘wife’, anu ‘grandmother’, etc.:

ba-ti-kware

tu-keO.

see-GO.TEMP-REM.PAST 3SG-FM

‘His wife went to see him.’ mu041

3 — independent nouns consist of an open class of a couple of thousand terms which do not take any e- prefix nor any possessor inflections. They refer to fauna, flora, artefact, proper nouns, etc. There is also an interrogative noun, ai ‘INT’ (see the example in (4.12a)).

E-nouns and independent nouns (but not kinship nouns) can be used as (juxtaposed) modifiers (in slot D) to another noun (as NP head in slot E). When the modified noun is an e-noun, its e- prefix is obligatorily deleted. This is illustrated in (4.18) with the e-noun -rami ‘flesh’ modified by independent noun waka ‘cow’:

(4.18)

Ani-ya=dya yu-keja

[wakaD ramiE]S?

sit-IMPFV=FOC over.there-LOC.GNL cow flesh

‘Is there cow meat (lit. flesh) over there (in your country)?’ tb205

(An example with the independent noun arusu ‘rice’ functioning as a juxtaposed modifier to tee ‘field’ can be seen in (4.12a).)

Nouns are discussed at length in §12.3 (e-nouns), §12.4 (kinship nouns) and §12.5 (independent nouns).

73

4.4.3. Attributive adjectives

Attributive adjectives are a closed class of 16 bare roots which cannot take affixes or be

reduplicated. They are listed in (4.19) (sorted by semantic types):

(4.19) a. DIMENSION

b. AGE

baru ‘tall’

nana ‘recently born/created’

ebari ‘big and strong’

siri ‘old’

kaka ‘small and round’

wiri ‘small and skinny’

c. COLOUR pude ‘red/brown’ paja ‘white, clear’ sewe ‘black’ jawa ‘yellow’ sawa ‘green/blue’

d. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES baba ‘big, old, respected, unique’ jika ‘untidy’ midi ‘thick’ uke ‘hot’ turu ‘big male’

Attributive adjectives only function within an NP (in slot F), as with baba ‘unique’ in (4.20). (Recall that Cavineña has a specific class of predicative adjectives which are used in CC function, as with mure- ‘ferocious’ in (4.20); see §4.3.)

‘The big (lit. unique) leaf-cutter ant is very ferocious.’ di2660

Attributive adjectives are discussed in §13.2.

4.4.4. Number markers
Cavineña has three number markers: dual marker =ekatse ‘DL’, plural =kwana ‘PL’ (general plural marker), and =ekana ‘PL’ (plural marker of kinship nouns possessed by first and second persons). Their main morpho-syntactic properties are: 1 — number markers consist of bare roots which cannot take any affixes or be

74 reduplicated; 2 — number markers are enclitics (not phonologically independent words). They obligatorily require a host which has to be an NP constituent; 3 — number markers only function as modifiers to the head of an NP (in slot G). The dual number marker =ekatse ‘DL’ is illustrated in (4.21):

Tu-wa =shana juye=ekatseCS nereka-daCC.

there-LOC =PITY ox=DL

‘There, the oxen (dl) were miserable (having to pull the terribly heavy cart).’ ka239

Number markers are discussed in §13.3.

4.4.5. Quantifiers

There is a closed class of quantifiers which includes ten numerals (listed in (4.22a)),

four logical quantifiers (listed in (4.22b)), the quantifier question marker ejeuma ‘how

much/many’, and the word peya ‘other’.

(4.22) a. peadya ‘one’

shukuta

‘six’

beta ‘two’

pakaruku

tunka

‘ten’

b. dutya

‘all’

umada/jetiama ‘many’3

umae

Quantifiers have the following morpho-syntactic properties: 1 — quantifiers are bare roots. They cannot take affixes or be reduplicated; 2 — quantifiers only function as NP modifiers (in slot B of the NP structure).

The quantifier dutya ‘all’ is illustrated in (4.23):

3 These two logical quantifiers are synonymous.

Quantifiers are discussed in §13.5.

4.5. Remaining word classes 4.5.1. Postpositions Cavineña has a closed class of postpositions. Postpositions relate an NP to a predicate, a clause or a (superordinate) NP head. Postpositions are bare roots which cannot take any affixes or be reduplicated.

Cavineña has major postpositions which cannot occur by themselves (i.e., without

an argument). They are listed in (4.24):

(4.24) =ra ‘ERG’

ji(e)/teke

‘LOOKING.FOR’

=tsewe ‘ASSOC’

pidya/beta/kimisha ‘ONE/TWO/THREE WHOLE’

‘ONLY’ ‘ALONE’

=ju ‘LOC’

=keja ‘LOC.GNL’

=eke ‘PERL’

=tupu ‘UP.TO’

Cavineña also has minor postpositions which can occur with or without an argument (somewhat like English he went outside the house and he went outside). The full list is given in (4.25):

4 Note that the dative postposition and the genitive postposition are homophonous.

Other postpositions are independent phonological words. The are postposed to the NP that they mark, as with jiteke ‘LOOKING.FOR’ in (4.27):

Postpositions are discussed in Chapter 14.

4.5.2. Pronouns There are two types of pronouns in Cavineña: (1) independent pronouns (coding core functions S/CS, A and O, and oblique functions DAT, GEN, ASSOC, LOC.GNL and ‘ALONE’), and (2) bound pronouns (coding core functions S/CS, A and O and oblique function DAT). Independent and bound pronouns (S/CS, A, O and DAT) have almost the same segmental make-up, coding person, number and case with essentially the same

77 roots and suffixes. The forms are given in Table 4.2 (core pronouns) and Table 4.3 (oblique pronouns). (When an independent pronoun is different from a bound pronoun, the independent pronoun is given in the left hand side of a column and the bound pronoun in the right hand side.)

Independent pronouns and bound pronouns have very different morpho-syntactic properties, as follows: 1— independent pronouns are phonologically and grammatically independent words that fill core NP or PP slots. They tend to occur first in a clause (as with e-ra ‘1SG-ERG’ in (4.28)), but can occur anywhere else (see for example tu-ke ‘3SG-FM’ in (4.17)). Example (4.28) also illustrates the genitive pronoun e-kwe ‘1SG-GEN’.

adeba-ya=ama.

1SG-ERG =3SG(-FM) 1SG-GEN father-AFFTN know-IMPFV=NEG

‘I do not know my father.’ nk011

2 — bound pronouns are enclitics (grammatically independent but phonologically bound) with a strict position in second position in main clauses.6 Bound pronouns undergo a number of morphological modifications not attested with independent pronouns. They only occur in certain types of main clauses. They can co-occur with independent pronouns (or an NP) coding the same function. An illustrative example is the sequence =tu-ra ‘3SG-ERG’ =Ø ‘(1SG-FM)’ in (4.29) (see many other examples in
6 Discussion of other languages with bound pronouns in clausal second position can be found in Hale (1973; Walbiri,

79 this chapter, such as =tu ‘3SG(-FM)’ in (4.28), =tuna ‘3PL(-ERG)’ in (4.5), =ekwana ‘1PL’ in (4.10), etc.).

bari=raA.

thus =3SG-ERG (=1SG-FM) affect-REM.PAST giant.anteater=ERG

‘Thus (he poked me with its trunk) the giant anteater did to me.’ ba098

In this study, bound pronouns (together with second position particles; §4.5.5) are written with an equal sign (‘=’) to indicate their clitic phonological status. In addition, in order to distinguish them from other types of clitics, bound pronouns (and second position particles) are separated from their host (and from each other when more than one co-occur) by a space (other types of clitics are written as attached immediately to their host and to each other).

Cavineña has two additional pronominal-like morphemes, ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘PL’, which are used very frequently but are not fully understood yet. They have not been included in the tables of pronouns above. These forms appear to be peripheral elements. They are not independent pronouns because they do not fill NP slots. They are not bound pronouns because they are not enclitics in second position and can occur in any type of clause. They refer to S/CS or O arguments. Examples can be seen in (4.81a) (showing ekatse ‘DL’ referring to the CS argument), (4.1b) (showing ekana ‘3PL’ referring to the S argument), and (4.30) (showing ekana ‘3PL’ referring to the O argument):

Australian) and Bickel and Nichols (2001; Luiseño, Uto-Aztecan).

80 4.5.3. Demonstratives Cavineña has two types of demonstratives: (1) adverbial demonstratives7 and (2) pointing demonstratives (note that Cavineña does not have specific nominal demonstratives). Both types code three degrees of distance ‘near’ vs. ‘mid’ vs. ‘far’. There are three sets of adverbial demonstratives (locative, general locative and perlative) and one set of pointing demonstratives. They are listed in Table 4.4:

Table 4.4: Demonstratives

‘over.there-LOC.GNL’ ‘over.there-PERL’

Pointing demonstratives
riya / jee ‘here’ tume ‘there’ yume ‘over.there’

Adverbial demonstratives and pointing demonstratives differ in the following ways: 1 — an adverbial demonstrative can be used instead of a locative, a general locative or a perlative postpositional phrase and is always anaphoric. In (4.31), for example, the locative postpositional phrase altoIvon=ju ‘AltoIvón=LOC’, in the first sentence, is replaced by the adverbial demonstrative tu-wa ‘there-LOC’, in the second sentence:

(4.31)

Kwa-kwe AltoIvon=ju! go-IMP.SG AltoIvón=LOC

Ba-ti-kwe

tu-wa

Chakubu=kwanaO! Chácobo.person=PL
‘(One day the missionary sent me to the Chácobo village. He said to me:) “Go to Alto Ivón! Go there and meet (lit. see) the Chácobo people!”’ pa002

2 — pointing demonstratives do not substitute any particulal postpositional phrase. They are not used anaphorically and require a pointing gesture (whereas this is optional with adverbial demonstratives). An example is given in (4.32):

7 The term ‘adverbial demonstrative’ is taken from Dixon (2003b).

‘Be quiet! There they come!’ mk065

Demonstratives are discussed in §15.7 (adverbial demonstratives) and §15.8 (pointing demonstratives).

4.5.4. Content question words
Cavineña has a number of special words used in content questions. These words can also be used in non-interrogative clauses with an indefinite sense, or within relative clauses coding the argument that is common between the relative clause and the main clause.

There are words used for questioning particular oblique phrases, listed in (4.33a).

There are also words used for questioning particular subordinate clauses, listed in

(4.33b).

(4.33) a. eju

‘INT:LOC’

(locative phrases; §14.4)

ejekeja

‘INT:LOC.GNL’ (general locative phrases; §14.5)

ejeeke

‘INT:PERL’ (perlative phrases; §14.6)

ejetupu

‘INT:UP.TO’ (‘up to’ phrases; §14.7)

b. ejebuchajuatsu ‘INT:REASON’ (reason clauses; §19.3)

ejebae / ejebucha ‘INT:SIMLR’ (‘similarity’ clause; §19.4)

eje=ke

‘INT=LIG’

(relative clause; §13.6 and Chapter 20)

Interrogative words can be used within head-internal RCs to code the common argument, as in (4.34):

(4.34)

A=ishu

=miS

bawe ju-kara ju-ya

do.what=PURP.GNL =2SG(-FM) know be-DESID be-IMPFV

[i-keS eju

kwa-ya=ke]E.

1SG-FM INT:LOC go-IMPFV=LIG

‘Why do you want to know where I go?’ du014

82 Note that content questions also make use of the interrogative noun ai ‘INT’, the interrogative prefix eje- ‘INT’ (on predicative adjectives) and the interrogative noninflecting verb ai ju- ‘do what’ (this verb can be seen within a general purpose clause in (4.34) — with deletion of the i vowel and the auxiliary). (See discussion on interrogative clauses in §4.6.5.)

4.5.5. Particles

Cavineña has a closed class of particles. Particles are bare roots which cannot take affixes or be reduplicated. There are four distinct subclasses of particles which differ in their degree of phonological and structural independence: 1 — Independent particles have the highest degree of freedom. They form independent phonological words which can occur anywhere in any type of clause. The full list of independent particles is given in Table 4.5.

83 The independent particles iyakwa ‘now’ and yudijidya ‘again’ are illustrated in (4.35) (see also amena ‘FILL’ in (4.17)).

2 — First position particles also form independent phonological words but have distributional restrictions. They can only occur in main clauses (not subordinate clauses) and have to occur in first position. First position particles are listed exhaustively in Table 4.6.

Table 4.6: First position particles

‘QUEST’ ‘ATT.GETTER’ ‘POTENTIALLY’ ‘SEEMINGLY’ ‘SEEMINGLY.NOT’ ‘LUCKILY’

3 — Second position particles do not form independent phonological words. They are enclitics to the last phonological word of the first immediate constituent of a main clause only (NP, PP, predicate, independent or first position particle, adverbial clause, etc.). Second position particles are listed exhaustively in Table 4.7 (sorted by semantic field).

Examples of second position particles can be seen with =shana ‘PITY’ in (4.21) and =pa in both (4.23) and (4.26).

4 — Phrasal particles do not form independent phonological words either. All phrasal particles but one (ni= ‘NOT.EVEN’) are enclitics to the last phonological word of a phrase (NP, PP, predicate, independent or first position particle, adverbial clause, etc.). The particle ni= ‘NOT.EVEN’ is a proclitic which attaches to the first phonological word of a phrase. Phrasal particles can occur in any type of clause. They are listed exhaustively in Table 4.8.

‘STILL’ ‘REITR’ ‘FOC’ ‘RESTR’ ‘ONLY’ ‘ONLY’ ‘JUST’ ‘APPROX’ ‘NEG’ ‘NOT.EVEN’ ‘DIM’ ‘INTENS’ ‘RESTR’ ‘ALMOST’ ‘UNCERT’

Examples of phrasal particles can be seen with =dya ‘FOC’ in both (4.18) and (4.32), =tere ‘ONLY’ in (4.23), and =ama in (4.28).

Second position particles (together with bound pronouns which also occur in second position) are written with an equal sign (‘=’) to indicate their clitic phonological status, and are separated from their host (and from each other when more than one cooccur) by a space. See, for example, the second position particle =pa ‘REP’ and the bound pronoun =tu ‘3SG(-FM)’ in (4.37) below. Phrasal particles are also written with an equal sign (‘=’). However, unlike second position particles and bound pronouns, they are written as attached immediately to their host and to each other. See for example =kwita ‘RESTR’ in (4.37):

(4.37)

Independent, first position and second position particles are discussed in Chapter 16. Phrasal particles are discussed in Chapter 17.

4.5.6. Subordinate clause markers
Subordinate clause markers are very similar to postpositions. They form a closed class of bare roots which mark a constituent and relate it to another (superordinate) constituent. However, subordinate clause markers mark clauses while postpositions mark NPs. Subordinate clause markers are used to mark three different types of clauses: 1 — non-finite adverbial clauses (Chapter 18), which they relate to a controlling clause; 2 — finite adverbial clauses (Chapter 19), which they also relate to a controlling clause; 3 — relative clauses (Chapter 20), which they relate to the head of an NP.

The full list of subordinate clause markers is given in (4.38):

(4.38) non-finite adverbial clauses finite adverbial clauses

relative clause

=ishu ‘PURP.GNL’

=ju

‘DS’

=ke ‘LIG’

=ke juatsu ‘COND’

=ademe ‘THANKS.TO’

majaka

‘EVEN.THOUGH’

=amabucha ‘EVEN.THOUGH’

Most subordinate clause markers are enclitics. They attach to the last phonological word of the clause that they are marking, as with =tibu ‘REASON’ in (4.39) (see also =ju ‘DS’ in (4.37)).

(4.39)

‘As you are the dog owneri, hei will follow you. (whereas he didn’t want to follow me).’ tg030

One subordinate clause marker, majaka ‘EVEN.THOUGH’, consists of a separate

87 phonological word. It is postposed to the clause that it marks, as shown in (4.40):

(4.40)

4.5.7. Interjections
Interjections are bare roots which never take affixes and are never reduplicated. They behave like a whole utterance in one word. Interjections have not been studied in depth. They are only briefly discussed here and not elsewhere.

Interjections encode a number of different meanings listed and glossed in (4.41):

(4.41) a. Speaker attitude/emotion

achí

‘speaker feeling disgusted’

akwe

‘speaker feeling sorry’

juwaaba

‘speaker does not know’

pa

‘speaker feeling impressed’

pajuani

‘speaker disagrees’

pusi

‘speaker amused’

ujepa

‘speaker angry’

b. Phatic a(a)

‘hearer follows/understands speaker’

c. Answers to polar questions

aama

‘not.exist’

aijama

‘not.exist.at.all’

jejee

‘yes’

d. Imperative kwii juwejuwe

‘speaker ordering the hearer to go first’ ‘speaker ordering the hearer to hurry up’

e. Signals juj tsujj

88
‘signal uttered when approaching a house for a visit’ ‘signal uttered when discovering enemies nearby’

The interjection pa ‘speaker impressed’ is illustrated in (4.42):

(4.42)

Pa! Kasa-u-siCC! INTERJ strong-ASF-AUGM
‘Wow! (Those traditional canoes were) very strong! (Uttered by Antonio Yubanera when hearing that the canoes Ventura Mayo used to build could contain up to six people.)’ ab203

A number of interjections are phonologically irregular. The interjection achí ‘speaker feeling disgusted’ has low-pitch-high-pitch-contour (as opposed to the highpitch-low-pitch contour normally applied to two syllable word)s. The interjection pa and the short form of the interjection a(a) ‘hearer follows/understands speaker’ have only one syllable and still form one independent phonological word (as opposed to a requirement of two syllables for an independent phonological word). The two interjections juj ‘signal uttered when approaching a house for a visit’ and tsujj ‘signal uttered when discovering enemies nearby’ have closed syllables (as opposed to the open syllables that are normally the rule).

A number of interjections are borrowed from Spanish and are used with the same

meanings. The interjections in (4.43a) and (4.43b) have been fully integrated into the

Cavineña phonological system. The interjections in (4.43c) have not, and were probably

borrowed more recently:

(4.43) a. Greeting

bandia

‘good morning’ (from buenos dias)

bastare

‘good afternoon’ (from buenas tardes)

banuchi

‘good night’

(from buenas noches)

b. Thanking yusurupai

‘thank you’

(from Dios se lo page ‘God will pay it back to you’)

89

c. Speaker attitude (no phonological changes)

bien/bueno

‘speaker feeling positive’

carajo

‘speaker feeling impressed’

caramba

‘speaker feeling concerned’

There used to be a more traditional way of greeting but it is not used anymore. According to one consultant, greeting was done by uttering a time of day independent particle such as barepatya ‘midday’, barepatyawesuta ‘afternoon’, metapatya ‘midnight’, etc. (see full list in §4.5.5). These particles could either be used as one word utterances, or be followed either by the 1st person dual pronoun yatse ‘1DL’ (if the speaker was greeting only one person) or 1st person plural ekwana ‘1PL’ (if the speaker was greeting more than one person).

4.5.8. Onomatopoeia
Onomatopoeia words are quite similar to interjections in that they are bare roots which do not take any affixes or cannot be reduplicated. They also constitute a full sentence by themselves. But unlike interjections, onomatopoeia words do not express any other meaning than the entity associated with the cry or sound they are used to depict. Onomatopoeia words have not been fully studied. They are briefly illustrated in this section and not elsewhere.

Onomatopoeia can be used to refer to the cries of birds, as in (4.44a), or the cries

of various mammals in (4.44b):

(4.44) a ajj

(cry of pusari bird)

kwajj (cry of pusari bird)

bui

(cry of maurí bird)

pi

(cry of maurí bird)

piskwa (cry of piscua bird)

chi

(cry of piscua bird)

pin

(cry of any small bird)

shun (cry of duck)

90

b. jau

(cry of dog)

kwee (cry of dog)

siu

(cry of dog)

kwi

(cry of pig)

muu (cry of cow)

jeej

(cry of anteater)

jeu

(cry of capuchin monkey)

ri

(cry of peccary)

Onomatopoeia words can also be used to refer to various sounds associated with

vegetation in (4.45a), water in (4.45b), artefacts in (4.45c) and animate entities in

motion in (4.45d):

(4.45) a. rajj

(sound of vegetation moving)

shajj

(sound of leaf falling)

shujj

(sound of liana being pulled up)

taajj

(sound of stick breaking)

tuku

(sound of bone breaking)

b. kwaj puchari tsupu/kubu

(sound of water boiling) (sound of water boiling) (sound of something falling in water)

c. tsajj tujj

(sound of shooting an arrow) (sound of shooting a gun)

d. bujj drajj/tajj jiish/juj
tin

(sound of person falling on the ground) (sound of animal moving inside a hole) (sound of animal suddenly and quickly running towards something) (sound of action of grabbing)

Onomatopoeia words are even more phonologically abnormal than interjections. A large number end with a closed syllable, typically with fricative codas sh or j. These fricatives are also often lengthened (which is written here by doubling the consonant). Most onomatopoeia words, even though they form an independent phonological word,

91 have only one syllable.

Syntactically, an onomatopoeia word, similarly to interjection, makes up a whole utterance. This is illustrated in (4.46). The onomatopoeia tujj occurs between two sentences; an utterance-final contour and a pause clearly separate tujj from both era in the preceding sentence and mare-kware in the following one:

(4.46)

Mare-kware e-raA. Tujj! Mare-kware e-raA shoot-REM.PAST 1SG-ERG ONOM shoot-REM.PAST 1SG-ERG

ajaO. capuchin.monkey
‘I shot it. Tujj! I shot the capuchin monkey.’ aj014

4.6. Main clause structure
Declarative affirmative verbal main clauses are the most frequently used in texts. They will therefore be referred to as basic. Basic clause structure is presented in §4.6.1 and is followed by a discussion of core grammatical functions (§4.6.2). The next sections discuss non-basic clauses which differ to some degree from basic clauses: copula clauses (§4.6.3), imperative and hortative clauses (§4.6.4), interrogative clauses (§4.6.5) and negative clauses (§4.6.6).
4.6.1. Basic clause structure
The structure of a basic clause in Cavineña can be described in terms of a number of slots (A, B, C, etc.) which are each filled by a single immediate constituent of the basic clause (i.e., in formal terms, a constituent that is immediately dominated by the basic clause node). Slots A and B have most relevance for the overal structure. The remaining slots (C, D, E, etc. — the exact number of these slots remains to be investigated) are of minor importance: — slot A is filled by the first immediate constituent of the basic clause; — slot B is filled by second position (2P) clitics. Recall that these are enclitics (they attach to the last phonological word of the first immediate constituent; §4.5.5); — slots C, D, E, etc. are each filled by a single immediate constituent.

92

The proposed slot structure of a basic verbal clause can be illustrated with (4.47). Recall that 2P enclitics are preceded by an equal sign ‘=’ and are separated from each other by a space. Each immediate constituent (corresponding to a single slot) is written between square brackets:

(4.47) A

B

C

D

E

[Tudya] [=tuO]

then

=3SG(-FM)

[chapa=raA] dog=ERG

[karu-ti-wa]

[datse].

bite-GO.TEMP-PERF FRUST

‘(When the porcupine that Lucio had shot fell dead on the ground,) the dog bit it.’ ij023

Constituent order in Cavineña is quite free. Slots A, C, D, E, etc. have very few restrictions as to what type of (immediate) constituent they are filled with. Slot B is an exception, as this slot can only be filled by 2P particles and bound pronouns.

Slot A can be filled by any one of the following elements: 1 — a first position particle, as with deka ‘POTENTIALLY’ in (4.1c), or an independent particle, as in (4.35), (but never a second position particle); 2 — a simple predicate, as in (4.46); 3 — the non-inflecting component (only) of a complex predicate as in (4.48a) (intransitive non-inflecting verb) and (4.49a) (transitive non-inflecting verb). As (4.48b) and (4.49b) show, the auxiliary component of a complex predicate cannot go into slot A together with the non-inflecting component:

(4.48) a. [Kwatsabiji] [=tuS]

[ju-ya]

tell.story.to =3SG(-FM) be-IMPFV

‘He is talking with the man.’ di0619

[arusuO].

MAN damage-MAN affect-IMPFV =3PL-DAT =3SG(-FM) rice

4 — an NP, an independent pronoun, or a predicative adjective (in CC function). Table 4.9 cross-references illustrative examples showing NPs coding core functions (S, E, A and O) occurring in slot A:

Table 4.9: Core argument NPs occurring in slot A of basic clause structure

S NP O NP A NP E NP

A (4.27) (4.5) (4.15) (4.12b)

5 — an NP or an independent pronoun coding an oblique function: • DAT: independent pronoun ‘to me’ in (4.9b); • LOC: NP ‘on the ground’ in (4.1b).
6 — a demonstrative, as with re-wa ‘here-LOC’ in (4.3a) and tu-wa ‘there-LOC’ in (4.21); 7 — an adverbial clause:
• non-finite adverbial clause: ‘opened the mouth, (and)’ in (4.16) and ‘fishing’ in (4.26); • finite adverbial clause: (4.7), (4.37), (4.39) and (4.40).

Slots C, D, E, etc., can be filled by the exact same constituents that can fill slot A, except first position particles (in addition to second position particles). Table 4.10 crossreferences illustrative examples showing the NPs coding core functions (S, A and O) and inflecting verbs in either C or D clausal slots.

We can complete our presentation of the basic clause structure by the following remarks: 1 — a basic clause must contain minimally (1) a predicate and (2) a mark of each core participant (except for 3rd person singular participants; see §15.3 for a full discussion of participant coding in Cavineña). If the predicate is complex, both the non-inflecting verb and (normally — there are a few exceptions) the auxiliary must be present; 2 — interjections and onomatopoeias are not part of clause structure but make a full main clause by themselves; 3 — a basic clause appears to be equal to a sentence in Cavineña. We could not identify any structure that would be used to co-ordinate two main clauses (into a sentence) (clause combination is only realised by subordinating constructions); 4 — a basic clause/sentence normally matches the utterance prosodic unit (§2.9.1). Recall that the end of an utterence is signalled by low (as opposed to mid) pitch on the last two syllables of the last phonological word.

4.6.2. S, A and O grammatical functions
Cavineña codes the core arguments S (subject of an intransitive clause), A and O (subject and object of a transitive clause) by a system of case-marking. Recall that there is no marking of arguments in the predicate and that NP/independent pronouns coding core arguments are free to occur in any position in a clause.

95

The case-marking follows an ergative pattern. An NP in A function (transitive subject) receives the ergative postposition =ra ‘ERG’. See examples (4.12a), (4.13), (4.15), (4.17), (4.29) and (4.47). A pronoun in A function, whether independent or bound, receives a suffix -ra ‘ERG’. Examples with independent pronouns in A function can be seen in (4.2b), (4.6), (4.28) and (4.46). Examples of bound pronouns in A function can be seen in (4.16), (4.29) and (4.39). The suffix -ra ‘ERG’ within bound pronouns undergoes a rule of deletion when the bound pronoun occurs last in the 2P clitic sequence, as in (4.51a), unless the bound pronoun is also last in the sentence, as in (4.51b):

(4.51) a. Tu-ke=kamadyaO=shana =tatseA

aikwana kemi-kware.

3SG-FM=ONLY =PITY =3DL(-ERG) FILL

take.out-REM.PAST

‘(They spent a whole night fishing and only caught a tiny fish.) This is the only thing that they caught, the poor guys.’ ps013

b. Ara-wana-wa=ama=dya

=tatse-raA.

eat-ADVERS-PERF=NEG=FOC =3DL-ERG

‘They (dl) did not eat it (the meat) (because it was not cooked).’ hm102

An NP in S or O function is unmarked for case. Examples showing NPs in S function are in (4.2c), (4.3b) and (4.27), and NPs in O function are in (4.5), (4.12a) and (4.28). A pronoun in S or O function, whether independent or bound, is equally unmarked for case. Singular (but not non-singular) pronouns marking S and O have a formative -ke which undergoes a rule of deletion when the bound pronoun occurs last in the 2P clitic, as in (4.37) (repeated), unless the bound pronoun is also last in the sentence, as in (4.52) (this is the same rule that applies to the ergative suffix -ra ‘ERG’ of bound pronouns in A function):

smell-IMPFV =3SG-ERG =2SG-FM

‘He smells you.’ (Camp 1983: 149)

S and A functions are treated as a single subject grammatical relation, at least by the system of switch-reference (a full study of grammatical relations remains to be undertaken in Cavineña). See discussion and illustration of the switch-reference system in §4.7.

4.6.3. Copula clauses
Copula clauses have two core arguments, a copula subject (CS) and a copula complement (CC), and a copula predicate, which have the following morpho-syntactic properties: 1 — the copula subject (CS) is coded identically to the subject of an intransitive clause (S). The CS can be a full NP or an independent pronoun and/or a bound pronoun. These are all unmarked for case and have the same freedom of order as S. Illustrative examples can be seen in (4.53), (4.9a), (4.20) and (4.21) (CS NPs), (4.39) (within a subordinate reason clause), (4.56) (CS independent pronouns), (4.53) (where the formative -ke ‘FM’ is deleted because the bound pronoun is last in the 2P chain) and (4.10) (CS bound pronouns).

=tuCS =3SG(-FM)

ju-kware

kwejipaCS…

be-REM.PAST wind

‘The wind was scary…’ di0632

A CS are treated similarly to an S with respect to the switch-reference system. See §4.7.
Although S and CS are identical grammatical functions in Cavineña, for clarity we will nevertheless keep coding copula subjects as CS (not S) in the examples.
2 — the copula predicate can only be headed by the verb ju- ‘be’ (there are no other copula verbs in Cavineña). This verb is similar to any (mono-syllabic)8 intransitive verb
8 Mono-syllabic verbs (and words in general) always show some irregularities in Cavineña.

97 and the intransitive auxiliary verb ju- ‘be’ (to which it is homophonous) in its morphological (derivational and inflectional) possibilities.

Examples showing the copula predicate with inflectional affixes are given in (4.54):

‘Be careful! The tree is going to fall down.’ di2135

Examples showing the copula predicate with various non-inflectional affixes are shown in (4.55) and (4.10):

(4.55) a. … [tu-keCS [dyake peyainime]CC ju-neti-ya=ju]…

3PL

be-DISTRIB-REM.PAST

‘They were all sad everywhere.’ fg030

98

3 — the copula complement almost always precedes the copula predicate (when the copula predicate is present). This can be seen in all examples provided in this chapter, except for (4.56) which is an exception.

mure-daCC.

3SG-FM =3SG(-FM) be-REM.PAST bold-ASF

‘It (the maned wolf) looked ferocious (lit. bold).’ bo015b

The copula complement resembles an absolutive (i.e., a S/CS or an O) argument in that it is unmarked for case but there are many differences. Unlike absolutive arguments, the CC cannot be represented by a bound pronoun (in second position), cannot be omitted and (as we said) normally occurs preposed to the copula predicate.

The CC can be a predicative adjective (whether a da-adjective or an independent adjective; but not an attributive adjective), as in the preceding examples. The CC can also be an NP as in (4.57) coding the semantic relation of identity, in (4.58) coding the semantic relation of equation and in (4.59) coding the semantic relation of naming:

(4.57) a. BariCC

1SG-GEN 1-uncle =3SG(-FM) Carlos.Mayo name

‘My uncle was called Carlos Mayo.’ mj016

The CC can be a postpositional phrase, as in (4.60):

(4.60)

Jee-ju =ekwanaCS yachi=juCC ju-chine.

here-LOC =1PL

pampa=LOC be-REC.PAST

‘Here (on this picture), we were in the pampa.’ ft042

Copula clauses are morpho-syntactically very similar to intransitive basic clauses based on (intransitive) non-inflecting verbs. The copula predicate is homophonous with the intransitive auxiliary. Both have the same morphological possibilities. The CC of a copula clause precedes the copula predicate, similarly to the non-inflecting component of a non-inflecting verb which has to precede its auxiliary. There are however (at least) two differences which make the two constructions different: 1 — copula clauses only can have an NP or PP as CC; 2 — the copula predicate can be omitted (while the predicate of an intransitive basic clause cannot). The main function of the copula predicate is to carry verbal affixes. Speakers very often leave out the copula predicate when they do not judge it necessary to express verbal categories coded by these affixes. This happens for example in generic statements (as in (4.57b)), or when the verbal categories are understood from either the textual context (as in (4.61), where the sentence comes within a text that only refers to remote past), or the physical/visual context (as in (4.58) the speaker is pointing to the referent of the CS):

4.6.4. Imperative and hortative clauses Clauses used for commands directed to a 2nd or 1st person (i.e., clauses with verbs inflected with imperative or hortative inflectional affixes) can be analysed as a different clause type on the basis that their core arguments cannot be represented by bound pronouns.

In imperative and hortative clauses, core arguments can be coded by NPs or independent pronouns or not coded at all, but can never be coded by bound pronouns.

Examples showing overt coding of S, A and O arguments by NPs or independent pronouns in imperative clauses can be seen in (4.62a) (in the second sentence; S argument), (4.62b) (A argument) and (4.31) (repeated) (O argument):

(4.62) a. Bute-kwe!

Mi-keS ikwene kueti-kwe!

Chakubu=kwanaO! Chácobo.person=PL
‘(One day the missionary sent me to the Chácobo village. He said to me:) “Go to Alto Ivón. Go there and meet (lit. see) the Chácobo people!”’ pa002

Examples showing no coding at all of core arguments in imperative clauses can be seen in the first sentences of both (4.62a) and (4.31) (S argument), and the second sentence of (4.31) (A argument) and (4.62b) (O argument).

101

The S, A and O core arguments of imperative and hortative clauses cannot be expressed by bound pronouns. In (4.62a), it is not possible to use the 2nd person singular bound pronoun =mi(-ke) ‘2SG(-FM)’ (with deletion of -ke ‘FM’ because it is last in the 2P clitic chain). Similarly, in (4.31) and (4.62b), it is not possible to use the 2nd person singular bound pronoun =mi(-ra) ‘2SG(-ERG)’ (with deletion of -ra ‘ERG’ because it is last in the 2P clitic chain).

Hortative clauses have the same properties as imperative clauses. Core arguments can be overtly coded by NPs or independent pronouns or not coded at all, but never coded by bound pronouns. This is briefly illustrated in (4.63). In the first sentence of (4.63a) the S is coded by an independent pronoun, while in the second sentence the O is coded by a full NP. In (4.63b), there is no coding at all for the S argument:

(4.63) a. YatseS ikwene ne-kwa! Ne-kwere-ti

batsaraO!

1DL first HORT.DL-go HORT.DL-cut.trees-GO.TEMP cedar.tree

‘Let’s (dl) go first. Let’s (dl) go to cut cedar trees.’ cv083

b. Ne-diru-nuka, HORT.DL-go-REITR

Utsekwa! grandchild

‘Let’s go back, Grandchild!’ ps014

In (4.63a) (first sentence) and (4.63b), it is not possible to have the 1st person dual bound pronoun coding S function, i.e., =yatse. In (4.63a) (second sentence), it is not possible to have the 1st person dual bound pronoun coding A function, i.e., yatse(-ra) (with deletion of -ra because it occurs last in the 2P clitic chain).
Clauses used for commands directed to a 3rd person (i.e., clauses with verbs inflected with jussive inflectional affixes) do allow bound pronouns and are therefore not treated as a different clause type from basic main clauses in Cavineña. Examples of jussive clauses with 3rd person bound pronouns are given in (4.64) (see also a bound pronoun coding an A argument in a jussive clause in ‘he has to drink it with water’ in (T1.107)):

‘Let them (the ducks, the chicken and the pigs) eat it (the corn and the rice) until they are full (lit. fill up).’ di1460

At least one particle, ita ‘ATT.GETTER’, can only be used in imperative or hortative clauses (this particle is used to make unexpected but polite commands/requests). An example is given in (4.36).
Note that imperative and hortative clauses (like interrogative clauses; §4.6.5) have the same intonation contour as basic clauses in Cavineña.

4.6.5. Interrogative clauses Interrogative clauses in Cavineña are very similar to basic clauses, whether they are used to question content or polarity. One striking feature of interrogative clauses is that they do not appear to have any specific interrogative intonation nor any obligatory question marker that would mark these clauses as different from basic clauses.
A clause coding a polar question is identical to a clause used for a statement, unless the (optional) first particle are ‘QUEST’ is used (see below). Whether a particular clause is a statement or a polar question is retrieved from the context.
Content questions are more easily identifiable, as they always contain special question morphemes. Question words/constituents can be: (1) the interrogative (independent) noun ai ‘INT’ (substituting the noun within an NP and meaning ‘who’ or ‘what’), (2) special content question words (substituting oblique phrases or subordinate clauses and meaning ‘where’, ‘when’, ‘how’, ‘which’, etc.), (3) da-adjectives with the interrogative prefix eje- ‘INT’ (meaning ‘how (big, long, strong, etc.)’), or (4) the

103 interrogative non-inflecting verb ai ju- ‘do what’. We briefly illustrate each type of question word below.

The question word ai ‘INT’ is a straightforward independent noun. It can fill any position an independent noun can fill. It is used to question the head of an A NP in (4.12a), the head of an O NP head in (4.72), and the head of an associative oblique NP head in (4.65):

‘Who did the (lit. hisi) father leave his childi with? (He left him with his (the child’s) grandfather.)’ eb040

The interrogative noun ai can be juxtaposed to the head of an NP to question the type an NP head belongs to, as in (4.66) (see also (4.14)).

(4.70)

Eje-baruCC INT-tall

ju-wa be-PERF

Interrogative clauses have the following morpho-syntactic properties: 1 — content question words/constituents always fill slot A of the clause structure (i.e., they come first in the clause);
2 — interrogative clauses (unlike imperative and hortative clauses) can have their core arguments (S/CS, A and O) and/or a dative oblique coded by bound pronouns. An example showing a sequence of O and A bound pronouns in a content question is given in (4.72):

(See also =tu(-ke) in (4.12a) and (4.14).)

3 — a number of particles can only occur in interrogative clauses. The first position particle are ‘QUEST’ is only used in polar questions. This particle is used to make explicit that a clause is a question as opposed to a statement. An example is given in (4.73):

The second position particle =jatsu ‘EXACTLY’ appears to be only allowed in interrogative clauses, either in content questions, as in (4.32a), or polar questions, as in (4.32b):

(4.74) a. AiO =jatsu =tu-keO =miA

4.6.6. Negative clauses
Negation can be realised by one (or more) of the following mechanisms: 1 — negative phrasal particle =ama (§17.10). This particle can occur on any clause immediate constituent as in (4.12a), (4.28), (4.51b) (on a predicate), (4.75a) (on a predicative independent adjective), (4.75b) (on a core O NP with an ellipsed head), (4.75c) (on a perlative postpositional phrase), (4.75d) (on a different subject temporal

2 — the auxiliary-taking verbal suffix -karama ‘DESID.NEG’ which is the negative counterpart of the auxiliary-taking verbal suffix -kara ‘DESID’ (§10.1.1);

3 — the suffix -dama ‘NEG’ on a predicative da-adjectives, as in (4.54);

4 — negative predicative independent adjectives: aama ‘not exist’ (illustrated in (4.76)) or aijama ‘not exist at all’;

‘It sounds like we won’t have that radio (transmitter) (a radio will seemingly not sit to us).’ tb088

6 — negative interjections: aama ‘not exist’, aijama ‘not exist at all’, juwaaba ‘speaker does not know’, pajuani ‘speaker disagrees’;
7 —a negative imperative affix, as in (4.78): (4.78) a. Mi-keS ani-kwe! Mi-keS je-ume!
2SG-FM sit-IMP.SG 2SG-FM come-IMP.SG.NEG ‘You (sg) stay (lit. sit)! You (sg) don’t come!’ n1.0167

One verbal suffix, -jeri/-neri ‘ALMOST’ (§7.1.3) is sensitive to the polarity of the predicate it occurs in. The form -jeri is used when the predicate is affirmative. The form -neri occurs when the predicate is negative.

There is also a phrasal particle, ni= ‘NOT.EVEN’, which is used to reinforce the negative polarity of a negative clause (see §17.11). This is illustrated in (4.79) (see also (4.82b) and (4.89c)).

ni=matuja=raA.

eat-REM.PAST=NEG (=1SG-FM) NEG=NOT.EVEN=cayman=ERG

‘(God protected me during that trip because) not even a cayman ate me.’ mj067

Negative clauses are not significantly different from an affirmative clause.

108 Although more work might reveal some differences, negation does not appear to have any effects on word order, on the use of other grammatical categories (such as verbal affixes, particles, etc.), and on the coding of arguments (notably, arguments of negative clauses can be coded by bound pronouns; see for example (4.75b) and (4.75d)).
4.7. Dependent clauses Cavineña has only three types of dependent clauses, all of which are subordinate: (1) non-finite adverbial clauses (Chapter 18), finite adverbial clauses (Chapter 19), and relative clauses (§13.6 and Chapter 20). Cavineña does not have any complement clauses, only complementation strategies. Cavineña does not have coordinate clauses either.
The three types of subordinate clauses are marked by dependency markers. Only one dependency marker, -(a)tsu ‘SS’, is a (verbal) affix (slot K of predicate structure; §4.2.1). The remaining dependency markers are enclitics or separate phonological words that belong to the word class of subordinate clause marker; see full list in §4.5.6).
Non-finite adverbial clauses have a verb without an inflectional affix. There are five types of non-finite adverbial clauses: 1 — same subject temporal clause, marked by -(a)tsu ‘SS’ (§18.2); 2 — general purpose clause, marked by =ishu ‘PURP.GNL’ (§18.3); 3 — purpose of motion clause, marked by =ra ‘PURP.MOT’ (§18.4); 4 — cause clause, marked by =ra ‘CAUSE’ (§18.5.1); 5 — ‘just before’ clause, marked by =wie ‘JUST.BEFORE’ (§18.5.2).
Finite adverbial clauses have a verb obligatorily inflected by a TAM affix. There are 6 types of finite adverbial clauses: 1 — different subject temporal clause, marked by =ju ‘DS’ (§19.2); 2 — reason clause, marked by =tibu ‘REASON’ (§19.3); 3 — similarity clause, marked by =bucha ‘SIMLR’ (§19.4); 4 — conditional clause, marked by =ke juatsu ‘COND’ (§19.5); 5 — ‘thanks to’ clause, marked by =ademe ‘THANKS.TO’ (§19.6.1); 6 — concessive clause, marked either by majaka or =amabucha ‘EVEN.THOUGH’

109 (§19.6.2).

Cavineña has a switch-reference system involving two types of subordinate clauses: 1 — same subject temporal clauses, as their name indicates, obligatorily have their subject (either S/CS or A) co-referential with the subject (either S/CS or A) of their controlling clause (see §18.2). Examples are given in (4.16), (4.80a) and (4.81a);

2 — different subject temporal clauses, as their name also indicates, obligatorily have their subject (either S/CS or A) non-coreferential with the subject (either S/CS or A) of their controlling clause (see §19.2). Examples are given in (4.7), (4.37), (4.80b) and (4.81b).

4.8. Coordination
Coordination structures have not been fully investigated yet and will require additional study. Coordination in Cavineña can be realised by simple apposition of two constituents of the same type and in the same function, as in (4.82a) (conjunction) and (4.82b) (disjunction):

(4.82) a. Ne-duju-kere-kwe IMP.NSG-take-CAUS.INVLT-IMP.NSG

[[tu-ja carga=kwana] [tu-ja tichira=kwana]]O!

3SG-GEN load=PL

3SG.GEN recipient=PL

‘Help (pl) him carry his load and his recipients.’ tr003

b. AijamaCC =pa tuna-ja [[ni=jae]

[ni=e-rami]]CS.

nothing =REP 3PL-DAT NOT.EVEN=fish NOT.EVEN=NPF-meat

‘They say they don’t have any fish nor any meat.’ ka162

However, we have identified two coordinators: jadya ‘and’ used for conjunction (§4.8.1) and jadyaamajuatsu ‘or’ used for disjunction (§4.8.2). (The terminology used while discussing coordination is taken from Haspelmath 2000.) Cavineña coordinators can coordinate words, phrases and subordinate clauses. They cannot be used to coordinate main clauses.

4.8.1. Conjunction
Conjunction (i.e., ‘and’-coordination) is realised by the coordinator jadya ‘and’ (in a few examples, jadya also codes disjunction; i.e., ‘or’-coordination). This morpheme is homophonous with (and probably historically related to) the independent particle jadya ‘thus’ (§4.5.5). Jadya occurs only once per coordination structure and is postposed to the last coordinand (e.g., with three coordinands A, B and C we have A B C jadya).

111 Jadya can be used to coordinate two or more coordinands.

Coordination of verbs requires bare verbal stems (inflected verbs cannot be coordinated) with the same transitivity value and an auxiliary which matches the transitivity of the coordinated verbs (i.e., either intransitive ju- ‘be’ or transitive a‘affect’). This is illustrated in (4.88) with coordination of four transitive verbs:

Disjunction is normally realised by jadyaamajuatsu ‘or’, as discussed in the following section, but is occasionally realised by jadya, as illustrated in (4.89)

4.8.2. Disjunction
Disjunction (i.e., ‘or’-coordination) in Cavineña is normally realised by the word jadyaamajuatsu ‘or’ which comes from the lexicalisation of the same subject temporal clause (§18.2) jadya=ama ju-atsu ‘thus=NEG be-SS’ (lit. being not thus). In fast speech, jadyaamajuatsu is often shortened to jadyamajuatsu, jadyamaatsu or even amaatsu. Jadyaamajuatsu is only found coordinating two coordinands in the data (more work is needed to determine whether more than two coordinands can be involved). Jadyaamajuatsu occurs between the two coordinands.

Jadyaamajuatsu is illustrated combining various types of coordinands in (4.90) ((4.90c) is (T1.102)):

5 Predicate structure — an overview
This chapter is a general introduction to the structure of the predicate, one of the most complex areas of Cavineña grammar. The following five chapters deal in detail with specific topics: inflectional morphology (Chapter 6), Aktionsart suffixes (Chapter 7), valency-changing mechanisms (Chapter 8), postural and directional suffixes (Chapter 9) and auxiliary-taking processes (Chapter 10).
In Cavineña, the predicate must be distinguished from the verb itself. Both structures match when the predicate is simple — both predicate and verb consist of one grammatical and phonological word. But the two structures do not match when the predicate is complex — the predicate consists of more than one grammatical and phonological word and the verb is only one amongst these predicate components.1 The structure of the predicate consists of 11 slots (A to K). It is discussed in §5.1.
The predicate can only be headed by a verb. There are two types of verbs: inflecting verbs which take affixes, and non-inflecting ones that do not (they require an auxiliary for this purpose). Inflecting verbs are discussed in §5.2. Non-inflecting verbs are discussed in §5.3.
The non-inflecting component of a complex predicate can always be separated from the inflecting component (i.e. the auxiliary). In §5.4, we discuss why we choose to treat both components as a single (although complex) predicate as opposed to possible complement-to-a-copula-predicate and adjunct-modifier-to-simple-predicate alternative analyses.
Verbs can undergo various processes of reduplication. These processes are introduced in §5.5.
1 See Dixon (2003a: 141ff.) for a discussion of the notions of verb vs. predicate in different languages.

118
5.1. Structure of the predicate The predicate in Cavineña can be described in terms of 11 slots. There is one slot for a verb root, one for an auxiliary, slots for (phonologically and grammatically) independent modifiers (preverbal and postverbal), prefixes (two slots) and suffixes (four slots) (one of which — slot H — can be filled by up to three co-occurring suffixes). A number of predicate modifiers are discontinuous and occupy more than one slot.
The predicate structure can be diagrammed as follows (obligatory components are in bold face):
Slot A: Inflectional prefixes Slot B: Preverbal modifiers Slot C: Valency-changing prefix Slot D: Verb root Slot E: Auxiliary Slot F: Postural and directional suffixes Slot G: Valency-changing suffixes Slot H: Aktionsart suffixes Slot I: Mode suffixes Slot J: Postverbal modifiers Slot K: Inflectional suffixes
In addition to the 11 slots, a number of clitics (phrasal particles) can attach to the predicate. These include the negative particle =ama ‘NEG’, the aspectual particle =jari ‘STILL’ and the focus particle =dya ‘FOC’ (see Chapter 17). These particles are clitics, i.e. independent grammatically but not phonologically (they form a phonological word together with the last phonological word of the predicate). These particles are not analysed as part of the predicate structure per se because they can normally occur on other types of constituents (NPs, PPs, copula complements, etc.).
Note that there are no pronominal markers in the Cavineña predicate. Cavineña does have bound pronouns but these occur in second position in a clause (they are phonologically bound to the last phonological word of the first immediate constituent of a main clause; §15.2).

119
In addition there are various reduplication processes. These are discussed independently in §5.5 below.

5.1.1. Slots A/K: inflectional affixes
The affixes that go into slots A/K (i.e., into slot A and/or slot K) are obligatory and mutually exclusive. We can distinguish between five different sets of inflectional affixes: 1 — tense-aspect-modality (TAM) (used in declarative and interrogative mood) 2 — imperative (command addressed to a 2nd person) 3 — hortative (command addressed to a 1st person) 4 — jussive (command addressed to a 3rd person) 5 — clause linker suffix -(a)tsu that yields a subordinate SS-temporal clause

The full list of inflectional affixes is provided in Table 5.1:

Table 5.1: Verbal inflectional affixes

TAM -ya -wa -chine -kware -buke e-…-u

‘IMPFV’ ‘PERF’ ‘REC.PAST’ ‘REM.PAST’ ‘REM.FUT’ ‘POT’

SUBORDINATE -(a)tsu ‘Same Subject’

IMPERATIVE (2nd) -kwe / -ume ne-…-kwe / ne-…ume
HORTATIVE (1st) panene-…-ra
JUSSIVE (3rd) pa-

Mi-keS ani-kwe! 2SG-FM sit-IMP.SG

‘The old one (man) leaves! You (sg) stay (lit. sit)!’ mu044

TAM and command inflections are discussed in detail in Chapter 6.

The last inflectional morpheme is the clause linker suffix -(a)tsu ‘SS’. This suffix yields a subordinate clause which obligatorily has the same subject (either S/CS or A) as the subject (either S/CS or A) of the main verb. The meaning encoded by the suffix -(a)tsu is most often temporal as in (5.2a) but can also be adverbial (modifying) as in (5.2b):

(5.2)

a. Ka-bajeje-ti-tsu shana-nuka-kware. REF-prepare-REF-SS leave-REITR-REM.PAST

‘When we bathe, we refresh ourselves (lit. become cold) (very well).’ di2072

A full discussion of same subject temporal clauses is in §18.2.

5.1.2. Slot B: preverbal modifiers
Slot B is associated with auxiliary-taking processes. A verbal affix cannot attach to the verb once an element occurs in slot B (unless the affix is attached before something occurs in slot B). Verbal affixes can still be used but they are then carried by an auxiliary.
Three types of elements can go into slot B: 1 — the three phonologically independent markers nere ‘VIGOROUSLY’, yume ‘IMMEDIATELY’, riya ‘STARTLING’ and pana ‘PROPERLY’ (§10.2). 2 — the discontinuous marker jadya/ejebucha …-e ‘MAN’ (in association with slot I) (§10.3). 3 — an ‘incorporated’ element (often an independent particle or a postpositional phrase) that accompanies a Ø-marked auxiliary-taking process. This process is discussed at length in §10.5.

5.1.3. Slot C/G: valency-changing affixes

Cavineña has four valency-changing mechanisms. Three of these mechanisms are realised by affixes that go into slot C/G (i.e., into slot C and/or slot G) of the predicate. They are given in Table 5.2:

Table 5.2: Valency-changing affixes

passive reflexive

valency reducing -ta(na) k(a)-…-ti

valency increasing causative -sha/-mere/-kere

These affixes can apply equally to inflecting and non-inflecting verbs.

122

The causative is interesting in having three forms. The form -sha can only be applied to intransitive verbs and the form -mere to transitive verbs. The form -kere can apply to both intransitive and transitive verbs but has a slightly different meaning (it codes involvement of the causer in the activity). Auxiliaries have suppletive causativised forms: amere- (be+CAUS) (corresponding to ungrammatical *ju-sha-) and akere- (be+CAUS.INVLT) (corresponding to ungrammatical *ju-kere).

Valency-changing affixes occupy slot C/G of the predicate. Example (5.3) show the verb ani- followed by a directional suffix (slot F) followed by the causative marker sha (slot C/G) followed by the obligatory inflectional suffix -wa:

(5.3)

E-raA =tuO

aniD-tsuraF-shaG-waK

1SG-ERG =3SG(-FM) sit-GO.UP-CAUS-PERF

mishiO [silla dyake]

cat

chair ON

‘I made the cat sit on the chair.’ n3.0095

A full discussion of valency-changing mechanisms is given in Chapter 8. This chapter also includes a discussion of two antipassive derivations. Antipassive derivation is carried out by reduplicating the verb root if the verb is inflecting (see §5.5 on the various reduplication processes that can be applied to a verb), or by exchanging the transitive auxiliary (a- ‘affect’) with the intransitive auxiliary (ju- ‘be’) if the verb is non-inflecting.

5.1.4. Slot D: verb root Slot D is filled by the predicate head which can only be a verb. It can be (1) an inflecting verb which directly takes affixes or (2) a non-inflecting verb which cannot carry any affix and which requires an auxiliary (in slot E) for this purpose. Similarly to slots A/K (for inflectional affixes), slot D is obligatorily filled.
We can contrast the intransitive inflecting verb ani- ‘sit’ in (5.4a) and the intransitive non-inflecting verb wikamutya ju- ‘to fish’ in (5.4b):

123

(5.4) a. Yawa=ju =shana ekanaS ani-ya.

ground=LOC =PITY 3PL

sit-IMPFV

‘They would sit (directly) on the ground, the poor ones (our Cavineña grandmothers).’ ci079

b. … weka-daCC=ju ekanaS wikamutya ju-ya.

bright-ASF=LOC 3PL

be-IMPFV

‘(Nowdays, when the youths go fishing,) they fish during the day (not during the night as we used to).’ ct087

We can also contrast the transitive inflecting verb ina- ‘grab’ in (5.5a) and the transitive non-inflecting verb bidubidu a- ‘wag’ in (5.5b):

(5.5)

a. [Jee ebakwapiji=ra]A ina-ya [make wiri=kwana e-tutsuCC=ke]O…

here boy=ERG

grab-IMPFV piraña small=PL RES-sew=LIG

b. IwaO =tunaA bidubidu a-ya…

tail =3PL wag

affect-IMPFV

‘They (my dogs) were wagging their tails…’ wa095

Verbs are discussed in detail in §5.2 (inflecting verbs) and §5.3 (non-inflecting verbs) further below.

5.1.5. Slot E: auxiliary An auxiliary is obligatory when the head of the predicate (slot D) is a non-inflecting verb. It can be a basic non-inflecting verb or a derived non-inflecting verb (i.e. a verb which has undergone an auxiliary-taking process).
There are two auxiliaries: ju- ‘be’ and a- ‘affect’. They have two main functions: (1) carrying affixes and (2) marking transitivity. As affix-carriers, ju- and a- are

124 required by non-inflecting verbs (basic or derived). As transitivity markers, jumarks an intransitive predicate (an example is at (5.4b)), while a- marks a transitive one (an example is given at (5.5b)). Exchanging the transitive auxiliary with the intransitive auxiliary has an antipassive function (a full discussion is in §8.3.2). Note that it is not grammatical to exchange the intransitive auxiliary with the transitive auxiliary.

5.1.6. Slot F: postural and directional suffixes

Postural and directional suffixes consist of seven members which are all mutually exclusive. They are listed in Table 5.3:

Table 5.3: Postural and directional suffixes

postural directional

-jara -ani -neti/-nitya -bade -tsura -bute/butya -sikwa

‘LIE’ ‘SIT’ ‘STAND’ ‘HANG’ ‘GO.UP’ ‘GO.DOWN’ ‘GO.AWAY’

Postural and directional suffixes have strong distributional restrictions. They only occur with a limited number of verbs. Example (5.6) shows the directional -tsura ‘GO.UP’ following the verb root iya- ‘put’ (slot D) and followed by the obligatory inflectional suffix -kware ‘REM.PAST’ (slot K):

(5.6)

Tudya amena kwaba=ju then FILL canoe=LOC

iyaD-tsuraF-kwareK put-GO.UP-REM.PAST

[[waburu] [beta dati] jadya]O. peccary two tortoise and
‘Then I put the peccary and the two tortoises (I had caught) in my canoe (i.e., moved them up to the edge of the canoe and dropped them in).’ ch015

A full discussion of postural and directional suffixes is in Chapter 9.

125

5.1.7. Slot H: aktionsart suffixes
Aktionsart suffixes provide optional modification of the verb in a similar way that adverbs or adverbial clauses modify a verb or a predicate in other languages.2 These suffixes are very rich semantically and code notions that are not commonly found in the morphology of the verb in other languages, particularly European languages. For example, there is a series of suffixes that code the time of the day an action is performed (e.g., -wekaka ‘the action is performed at dawn’, -apuna ‘the action is performed at dusk’, etc.).

There are about 30 Aktionsart suffixes. According to their semantics and distribution (i.e. co-occurrence possibilities), we can sort them into four broad groups. The following four tables list all suffixes with their glosses and their approximate semantics (suffixes in a paradigmatic opposition are placed in a single box).

Table 5.4: Aktionsart suffixes of aspect/manner

-tere/-tirya -bisha
-jaka -tibune -baka -siri -jeri/-neri -nuka -ni/-neni
-bare
-aje/-etibe/-be -wisha

‘COMP’ the action is performed in a way that totally affects S or O

‘INCOMP’ the action is performed in a way that only partially affects

S or O

‘STOP’

the action is interrupted

‘START’ the action is started for the first time

‘SHORT’ the action is performed for a very short time

‘LONG’ the action is performed for a very long time

‘ALMOST’ the action was almost (but not) performed

‘REITR’ the action is repeated a second time or carried on

‘RANDOM’ the action is performed without any goal or particular

place or time

‘DISTR’ (plural) S or O, when performing the action, are located

in different places in a uniform pattern

‘INCR’

the action is performed little by little

‘FAST’

the action is performed rapidly

2 The term ‘Aktionsart’ is taken from Aikhenvald (2003a: 342 ff.), who describes similar verbal categories in Tariana, an Arawak language from north west Amazonia.

Table 5.7: Aktionsart suffix of emotion

-jara/-wana ‘ADVERS’

the speaker feels discontent vis a vis S or O

Example (5.7) shows a predicate with a directional suffix (slot F), followed by a valency-changing affix (slot C/G), followed by an Aktionsart suffix (slot H), which in turn is followed by an obligatory inflectional suffix:

(5.7)

kC-iyaD-butyaF-tiG-nukaH-chineK REF-put-GO.DOWN-REF-REITR-REC.PAST ‘(we) put (our bags) down (in the cart)’ vb055

Aktionsart suffixes can be organised in a number of paradigms. One Aktionsart suffix from one paradigm can co-occur with another (or two other) Aktionsart suffix from another paradigm. This is illustrated with -wekaka ‘early morning’ and -nuka ‘REITR’ in (5.8a), and -jaka ‘stop’ with -diru ‘GO.PERM’ in (5.8b) below:

(5.8)

a. Metajudya=piisi =ekwanaS kwa-wekaka-nuka-ya.

tomorrow=JUST =1PL

go-AT.DOWN-REITR-IMPFV

‘Tomorrow at sunrise we will keep going and arrive there (lit. in one go).’

‘He let go (lit. stopped grabbing) of the caiman in the lake on his way.’ cd007

A full discussion of Aktionsart suffixes is in Chapter 7.

5.1.8. Slot I: mode markers
Similarly to slot B (and slot J; see below), slot I is associated with auxiliary-taking processes. While slot B (as well as slot I) is filled by phonologically independent elements, slot I is filled by suffixes.

Two types of markers goes into slot I: 1 — the three auxiliary-taking suffixes -kara ‘DESID’, -metse ‘FIRST’, -jakama ‘CEASELESSLY’, -bawe/-baekwa ‘ALWS’ and -ki/-aki ‘TYPICAL’. These fall into slot I of the predicate. They are discussed at length in §10.1; 2 — the suffix part of the discontinuous marker jadya/ejebucha …-e ‘MAN’ (together with slot B) (§10.3).

Example (5.9) shows the verb maju- ‘die’ followed by an Aktionsart suffix (slot H), then preceded-and-followed by the discontinuous marker jadya/ejebucha …-e ‘MAN’, and finally followed by an (obligatory) inflectional marker borne by an auxiliary:

(5.9)

[JadyaB majuD-jeriH=eI] ju-kwareK [manga=eke MAN die-ALMOST=MAN be-REM.PAST mango=PERL

pakaka-tsu]. fall-SS

‘This is the particular I way almost died, falling from a mango tree.’ mg034

5.1.9. Slot J: postverbal modifiers Similarly to slots B and I, slot J is associated with auxiliary-taking processes, and,

128 similarly to slot B markers, slot J markers consist of phonologically independent morphemes.
Two types of elements can go into slot J. 1 — members of a set of quantifier markers based on the numeral series. They are used to specify the number of times an event is performed: pidya ‘ONCE’ (corresponding to peadya ‘one’), beta ‘TWICE’ (corresponding to beta ‘two’) and kimisha ‘THREE.TIMES’ (corresponding to kimisha ‘three’). They are discussed in §10.4;
2 — an ‘incorporated’ element (often an independent particle) that accompanies a Ø-marked auxiliary-taking process. (A symmetrical process happens with slot B; see §5.1.2.) The auxiliary-taking Ø-marking process with incorporation of elements into slot J (as well as into slot B) is discussed at length in §10.5.

5.2. Inflecting verbs
Inflecting verbs are a clearly defined class. Only inflecting verbs can take affixes from slots A/K, C/G, F, G, H and I — this morphological criteria is enough to distinguish them from non-inflecting verbs and any other word classes. The class of inflecting verbs is open to derivations (from other word classes) but closed to borrowings (unlike noninflecting verbs).

5.2.1. Basic inflecting verbs
Inflecting verb lexemes are strictly subdivided between intransitive and transitive verbs in Cavineña. Only two (A=S) ambitransitive verbs were found: kike- ‘scream, scream at O’ and kwina- ‘give birth, give birth to O’. Intransitive verbs can only take one core argument (S) as with tsajaja- ‘run’ in (5.10a), while transitive verbs can only take two core arguments (A and O) as with iye- ‘kill O’ in (5.10b):

(5.10) a. [Tu-ke tupuju] =tuS

ibaS tsajaja-chine.

3SG-FM FOLLOWING =3SG(-FM) jaguar run-REC.PAST

‘The jaguar chased him (lit. ran following him).’ sg010

129

b. Iba=raA =tuO

iye-chine takureO.

jaguar=ERG =3SG(-FM) kill-REC.PAST chicken

‘The jaguar killed the chicken.’ n1.0227

Subject NPs of transitive verbs are always marked with the ergative enclitic =ra ‘ERG’ (or suffix -ra on pronouns) as opposed to subject NPs of intransitive verbs which are always unmarked for case.

The clear-cut distinction between intransitive and transitive verbs is also reflected by the fact that a number of verbal affixes have different forms depending on whether they apply to an intransitive verb or to a transitive verb. This is the case for the causative suffix which has the form -sha when applying to an intransitive verb, and -mere when applying to a transitive verb. Other similar alternations are found with the postural -neti/-nitya ‘STAND’, the directional -bute/-butya ‘GO.DOWN’, and the Aktionsart suffixes -tere/-tirya ‘COMP’ and -jara/-wana ‘ADVERS’ (the first member can only apply to an intransitive verb and the second to a transitive verb). Any inflecting verb lexeme can only select one of these suffixes. Finally, a number of verbal suffixes only apply to transitive verbs, as with -tsa ‘COME(O)’ and -dadi ‘GO(O)’.

A count of basic (non-derived) inflecting verbal lexemes reveals that there are four times more transitive verbs (about 280) than intransitive ones (about 70).

In addition to intransitive and transitive verbs, there are four attested ditransitive (underived) verbs: baka- ‘ask O for O’, kweja- ‘inform O of O’, seka- ‘steal O from O’ and tya- ‘give O to O’. These verbs have a third core argument marked identically to the O.3 An example of each in provided in (5.11) below:

(5.11) a. Ekwita=raA =tuA

kweja-wa [peadya kwatsabiji]O e-punaO.

person=ERG =3SG(-FM) inform-PERF one

story

NPF-woman

‘The man told a story to the woman.’ n3.0226

3 More work is required to determine whether there are any syntactic differences between the two O-like arguments. Note that examples such as the ones provided, where both arguments are expressed, are extremely rare, unless asked explicitly in elicitation.

Francisco=ERG steal.from-PERF mango fruit

[tumeCC=ke ebakwapiji]O. here=LIG small.child
‘Francisco stole a mango from that small child.’ n3.0537

A few more ditransitive verbs are historically derived from these ditransitive verbs by means of noun incorporation. The process is not productive however (see §5.2.5). The forms attested in the data are as follows. Based on tya- ‘give’, we have bawitya- ‘teach O to O’ with incorporation of the noun bawe ‘customs’ (lit. give customs), and tsujetya- ‘pay O to O’ with incorporation of the noun -tsuje ‘price, value’ (lit. give price). Based on baka- ‘ask for’, we have tsujebaka- ‘charge O O’ with incorporation of the same noun -tsuje ‘price, value’ (lit. as for price’).

The verb bawitya- ‘teach’ is illustrated in (5.12) below:

(5.12)

E-raA =miO

e-bawitya-u [i-keS bawe=kwana=ke]O.

1SG-ERG =2SG(-FM) POT-teach-POT 1SG-FM know=PL=LIG

‘I could teach you what I know.’ cp017

Ditransitive verbs can also be derived by causativisation of a transitive verb when it has a direct (as opposed to indirect) meaning, as shown in (5.13) based on the verb ara- ‘eat

131 O’ (see §8.4.2):

(5.13)

E-puna=raA =tuO

ara-mere-wa misiO [tu-ja ebakwa]O.

NPF-woman=ERG =3SG(-FM) eat-CAUS-PERF tamale 3SG-GEN child

‘The woman fed the child with tamale (i.e. she puts tamale herself in the child’s mouth).’ n3.0334

It has not been possible to single out any grammatical property that would differentiate one O from the other with these ditransitive verbs (either basic or derived). The main difficulty comes from the fact that ditransitive verbs are not very numerous in Cavineña. As a result there are very few textual examples of these verbs. However, from the few examples available, it appears that the traditional tests for distinguishing the two Os of ditransitive constructions in languages fail in Cavineña. Both Os can be expressed by bound pronouns (§15.2.4). Both Os have the same flexible ordering possibilities. Both Os can be passivised (§8.1). Both Os can enter within a reflexive or reciprocal relation with the agent when the reflexive/reciprocal derivation is applied (see §8.2.4). Finally, both Os are left unexpressed in all types of valency reducing mechanisms (passive, reflexive/reciprocal and antipassive).
The majority of inflecting verb roots have two syllables. Ten verbs have only one syllable — five intransitive (je- ‘come’, ju- ‘be’, kwa- ‘go’, pa- ‘cry’ and tsa- ‘laugh’), four transitive (a- ‘affect O’, ba- ‘see O’, be- ‘bring O’ and ryu- ‘comb O’) and one ditransitive (tya- ‘give’). A handful have more than two syllables.

5.2.2. Verbalisation of nouns Two non-productive processes of derivation producing inflecting verbs from nouns have been identified. The first one makes use of a circumfix marker k(a)-…-ti and derives intransitive inflecting verbs. The second makes used of a suffix -ne and derives transitive inflecting verbs. They are described in turn below.
A few intransitive inflecting verbs are derived from noun roots, including some

132 lexical loans, with a circumfix k(a)-…-ti.4 (Note that this marker is homophonous

with the reflexive marker (§5.1.3 and §8.2). The full list is given (5.14) (verbs derived

from e-nouns are in a., verbs derived form kinship nouns are in b., verbs derived from

independent nouns are in c.):

A few transitive inflecting verbs are derived from nouns (including some lexical

loans from Spanish) with a suffix -ne. The full list is given in (5.15) (e-nouns in a.,

independent nouns in b. and lexical loans in c.):

(5.15) a. dijine-

The derivation of a number of additional inflecting verbs from nouns involves more irregular morphology. Thus we have the intransitive muru-ta- ‘becomes ashes’ from the noun muru- ‘dust, ash’ and the suffix -ta (this suffix also derives a few inflecting verbs from adjectives — see list in (5.24); this suffix is also homophonous with one allomorph of the passive marker — see §5.1.3 above and §8.1), and the transitive baara-tura- ‘cause O to have fever’ from the noun baara ‘fever’ and the formative -tura (homophonous with the adjective verbaliser -tura; see following section).

5.2.3. Verbalisation of adjectives Inflecting verbs can be derived from adjectives. Intransitive and transitives take different derivational suffixes. We discuss them in turn below.
Intransitive inflecting verbs can be derived with four suffixes, with different degrees of productivity: -kwina (21 verbs), -na (13 verbs), -tsu (4 verbs) and -ta (2 verbs). Each suffix is illustrated in turn:

134

1 — The suffix -kwina derives 21 intransitive inflecting verbs from da-adjectives

(see §11.2). (Note that this suffix is homophonous with the ambitransitive verb kwina-

‘give birth, give birth to O’.) A verb derived with -kwina codes the action of slowly and

gradually acquiring the property denoted by the adjective. The 21 adjectives found with

kwina- in the available data are sorted out according to semantic types and listed

exhaustively in (5.16):

2 — The suffix -na/-ne (-na is homophonous with motion suffix -na ‘COME.TEMP’;

§5.1.7 and §7.2) derives intransitive inflecting verbs from da-adjectives. The derived

verb codes the action of intensively and rapidly (as opposed to slowly and gradually in

the case of -kwina; see above) acquiring the property denoted by the adjective. Two

verbs (jawa-ne- ‘become very yellow’ and ba-ne- ‘become very cold’) take -ne instead

of -na. The full list is given in (5.19):

3 — The suffix -tsu (homophonous with the SS-temporal clause marker; §5.1.1 and

§18.2) derives intransitive inflecting verbs from da-adjectives. We have only a few

examples of this suffix. The derived verb appears to code the action of beginning to

acquire the property denoted by the adjective. The exhaustive list of verbs derived with

-tsu is given in (5.22):

(5.22) a. COLOUR

jawatsu- ‘begin to become yellow’

jawa- ‘yellow’

pajatsu- ‘begin to become white’

pajitemuuketseri-

‘hard’ ‘stiff’ ‘hot’ ‘fat’

Interestingly, when trying to obtain more examples of -tsu during elicitation, the suffix

was refused by Emerenciano Sepa on the following verbs (the exact reasons are

unclear):

(5.23)

*umatsu- (from uma- ‘many’)

*barutsu- (from baru- ‘tall, high’)

*kasatsu- (from kasa- ‘strong’)

*batsu-

(from ba- ‘cold’)

4 — The suffix -ta (homophonous with one allomorph of the passive marker — see §5.1.3 above and §8.1) derives a few intransitive inflecting verbs from da-adjectives. Apparently, the derived verb codes the action of extremely becoming the property denoted by the adjective. The verbs found derived with -ta are given in (5.24):

139

(5.24)

shabita-

‘become extremely tender’

shabi- ‘tender’

pajata-

‘become extremely white’

paja- ‘white’

tsunuta-

‘become extremly long (time)’ tsunu- ‘long

(time)’

(Note that the suffix -ta also derives a few inflecting verbs from nouns; see §5.2.2.)

Transitive inflecting verbs can be derived from da-adjectives (and two independent adjectives; yuama ‘bad’ and pureama ‘happy’) with the suffix -tura (homophonous with the transitive verb tura- ‘make O upset’). The 21 forms found in the data are listed in (5.25) below, sorted by the semantic type of adjective:

b. Pureamatura-wa =mi-raA, Ebakwa! make.happy-PERF =2SG-ERG child ‘You made me happy, Son!’ di2294

One transitive inflecting verb is derived with a suffix -ne: ashasha-ne- ‘make O short’ (from independent adjective ashasha- ‘small’). (Note that that the form -ne is also found as a variant of -na deriving two intransitive inflecting verbs from da-adjectives; see above.)

5.2.4. Verbalisation by reduplication
About 30 intransitive and a few transitive inflecting verbs have the last (CV — never V) syllable reduplicated. A few of these verbs are derived from other word classes (from other verbs, da-adjectives and nouns). However, the majority of these verbs are inherently reduplicated (i.e., the base from which the last syllable is repeated does not exist as an independent form in the language). (See §5.5 for a discussion of productive

141 processes of reduplication in Cavineña.)

Cases where an independent base is recoverable include rara-ra- ‘dry (slowly?)’ (from intransitive rara- ‘dry’), katsa-tsa- ‘drizzle’(from transitive katsa- ‘beat O’) and kwina-na- ‘go out, be born’ (from ambitransitive verb kwina- ‘give birth, give birth to O’).

Two forms are based on da-adjectives: apu-pu- ‘darken’ (from apu- ‘dark’) and jawa-wa- ‘ripen’ (from jawa- ‘yellow’). Note that both forms apu and jawa also exist as verbs but with a meaning (‘cover’ and ‘paint yellow’ respectively) more remote than that of the adjectives, suggesting the adjectives are their source, not the verbs.

One form is based on a noun: weka-ka- ‘be at dawn’ (from weka ‘light’)

For the remaining (about 20) verbs with the last syllable reduplicated, there is no

identifiable source. They are given in (5.27) (intransitive verbs in a., transitive verbs in b.):5

(5.27) a. barere-

‘be seasick’

petutu-

‘boil’

bukuku-

‘move’

piriri-

burara-

rururu-

iserere-

sukururu- ‘drip’

jeruru-

‘start to go down’ tadada-

‘shiver’

manunu-

‘fade’

tarara-

‘snore’

muriri-

‘bubble’

tsajaja-

‘run’

muwewe-

‘sprout’

warere-

‘turn’

pak(/j)aka- ‘fall’

wenana- ‘getting nervous’

patata-

‘drip’

weruru-

‘sweat’

5 A few more verbs have been found with the last syllable reduplicated but with a meaning still unclear: putsutsu‘fall asleep (e.g. limb) (?)’, kanana-‘cry (?)’, pejiji- ‘bend (?)’ and pisisi- ‘drip from a small hole (?)’.

b. bajeje-/bajiji- ‘prepare/arrange O’ mukaka-

iruru-

‘scatter O’

piruru-

itata-

‘shake O’

pukaka-

jibururu-

‘wash face of O’ sirara-

makaka-

‘hug O’

142 ‘cover eyes of O’ ‘roll O up’ ‘make round O’ ‘damage, undo O’

Note how many of the previous forms encode events that have a sonorous component (patata- ‘drip’, tarara- ‘snore’, petutu- ‘boil’, etc.). We are tempted to suggest that last syllable reduplication is primarily a matter of onomatopoeia, in which new verbs are created from sounds that are somehow associated with the entity of the event depicted.

A few more inflecting verbs are inherently fully reduplicated. The full list of

forms attested in the data is given in (5.28) (a-examples are intransitive, b-examples are

transitive):

(5.28) a. jikajika-

‘scratch head’

juju-

‘burn’

kanakana- ‘pulse’

rikwirikwi- ‘palpitate’

riri-

‘rot’

jiji-

‘feel hot/spicy’

rudurudu- ‘limp’

b. jaja-

‘sieve O’

kaka-

‘tie O’

papa-

‘cover O (with soil)’

tata-

‘nail O’

susu-

‘suck O’

Note that there is a form jika- but it is an adjective, and its meaning (‘thick (vegetation)’) is only remotely related to the reduplicated verb. Possibly, some of these verbs have an onomatopoeic origin. Note that all these verbs, except perhaps riri- ‘rot’ and jiji- ‘feel hot/spicy’, denote actions with sonorous or rhythmic components. (It will be seen that, similarly to verbs, new nouns can also be created by partial or full reduplication involving onomatopoeia; §12.7.7.)

5.2.5. Noun incorporation

The morpho-syntactic characteristics of noun incorporation in Cavineña, are as follows:6 1 — The incorporated noun is normally an e-noun (i.e. a noun which requires an eprefix formative and which normally codes the part of an entity; see §12.3.1), except for
6 Note that these characteristics would make Cavineña noun incorporation fall under Mithun’s (1984: 856) type II

144 ijaka ‘ear’, kasa ‘strength’ and bawe ‘custom’ (which are independent nouns).

2 — The valency of the derived verb is not affected by the process of noun incorporation (one possible exception is transitive kasa-seka- ‘weaken O’ based on ditransitive seka- ‘steal O from O’). In (5.30), for example (volunteered by Alfredo Tavo), it is clear from the presence of two core arguments (an ergative subject and an absolutive — unmarked — object) that the derived verb metuku-tubu- ‘slit O’ is transitive (exactly like the non-derived verb tubu- ‘slit O’):

(5.30)

Santiago=raA =tuO

e-ju=keO

metuku-tubu-wa.

Santiago=ERG =3SG(-FM) 3-younger.brother=3 hand-slit-PERF

‘Santiago has slit the finger (lit. hand) of his younger brother.’ n5.0299

Similarly in (5.31) (also volunteered by Alfredo Tavo), the derived verb aa-tubu- ‘slit branch of O’ appears with an overt absolutive — unmarked — object, showing that the incorporation of -aa ‘branch’ has not affected its transitive status:

(5.31)

Aa-tubu-kwe

[tumeCC=ke akwi]O!

branch-slit-IMP.SG there=LIG tree

‘Cut the branch of that tree!’ n5.0304

3 — The incorporated noun occurs immediately before the root. Nothing can intervene between the incorporated noun and the root. In (5.32), for example (which was said to the author by Elio Tavo as we were beginning a working session), -akwa ‘chest’ occurs between the ka- part of the reflexive circumfix k(a)-…-ti (i.e., slot C) and the verb root (slot D):

(5.32)

NeA-kaC-akwa-tsuruD-tiG! HORT.DL-REF-chest-meet-REF
‘Let’s (dl) sit facing each other (lit. let’s meet each other’s chests) (rather than sitting on the same side of the table).’ n4.0522

noun incorporation.

145 4 — The e- prefix of a compounded e-noun is obligatorily omitted (as expected when e-nouns enter derivational processes; see §12.3.1).

We have not treated noun incorporation as part of the productive verbal morphology (and have not assigned a slot to it in the predicate structure) for the following reasons: 1 — inflecting verbs derived by noun incorporation are very scarcely used in texts. The majority of the forms given in (5.29) were only obtained through elicitation; 2 — the forms of a noun used independently and the same noun used incorporated are different in a number of cases. Examples are bawe ‘custom’ incorporated as bawi; kasa ‘strength’ incorporated as kasa in kasa-seka- ‘weaken’, but kas in kas-tirya- ‘tire’; and -metuku ‘hand’ incorporated as metuku in some verbs (e.g., metuku-tubu- ‘slit finger’), but me in others (e.g., me-deke- ‘help O with arm’); 3 — the meaning of the derived verb is not always fully transparent. Examples are ijaka-baka- ‘listen carefully to O’ (from ijaka ‘ear’ and baka- ‘hear O’), akwa-tsuru‘face O’ (from -akwa ‘chest’ and tsuru- ‘meet’), bawi-tya- ‘teach’ (from bawe ‘custom’ and tya- ‘give’) and tsuje-baka- ‘charge’ (from -tsuje ‘price’ and baka- ‘ask’).

It is quite likely that verbs derived by noun incorporation are remnants of a system that used to be more productive in the past. In keeping with Mithun’s (1984) description of type II incorporation in various languages, the function of noun incorporation in Cavineña was probably to promote highly affected ‘possessors’ (from oblique genitive function — slot C of the NP structure; see §12.1 and §13.4 — to core O function) and demote the ‘possessed’ part (from core O function to being part of the predicate).

The way present day Cavineña speakers promote a ‘possessor’ (from a genitive phrase in slot C) to core O function is by placing the ‘possessor’ in an oblique locative phrase (§14.4). (Note that this could be a calque from Spanish.) This is illustrated in (5.33):

(5.33) a. [Y-atsanakaO kisha-tsu] =tu-raA =ØO

karu-jeri-kware

NPF-mouth open-SS =3SG-ERG (=1SG-FM) bite-ALMOST-REM.PAST

e-wachi=ju. NPF-foot=LOC ‘He (a cayman) opened its mouth, and almost bit my foot (lit. almost bit me

146 on the foot).’ lg013

b. Ji-da=kwita =tuO

awadaO [e-tima tsau=ju] tekwa-kware.

good-ASF=RESTR =3SG(-FM) tapir NPF-hip bone=LOC shoot-REM.PAST

‘He shot the tapir right on the spine (lit. hip bone).’ ma021

At least two verbs appear to have undergone noun incorporation within intransitive verbs (these would qualify as Mithun’s (1984) type I incorporation): — the intransitive verb kas-tere- ‘become tired’ is clearly composed of the independent noun kasa ‘strength’ (reduced to kas) and the intransitive verb tere- ‘finish’. (Note that kasa is also found incorporated within the transitive verb tirya- ‘finish O’ in which it is also reduced to kas; see (5.29).) — transitive verb ena-pa- ‘cry for O’ is quite possibly composed of the e-noun -na (which would have kept its e- prefix) and the intransitive verb pa- ‘cry’.

5.2.6. Formatives
There is a formative suffix -a which can be identified as a causative derivational morpheme. This suffix is synchronically non-productive and is only found on a handful of transitive verbs which end with the vowel a (we will refer to these as a-verbs).

The five a-verbs given in (5.34) below are derived from intransitive verbs:

(5.34)

butya- ‘lower’

bute-

‘go down’

nitya- ‘make stand, stop, leave’

neti-

‘stand’

nudya- ‘make enter’

nubi- ‘enter’

tirya- ‘finish’

tere-

‘finish’

peya- ‘make cry’

pa-

‘cry’

Note that the derivation is quite irregular (reflecting the fact that it is not a productive process anymore). In the first four forms, the addition of the suffix -a triggers palatalisation + desyllabification of a preceding front vowel (e or i). But we also have unpredictable vowel modification (e.g. nitya ~ neti) and consonant modification (e.g. nudya/nubi).

147 One a-verb, muya- ‘scare away’, appears derived form another transitive verb, mui- ‘respect, fear’.

Three a-verbs are possibly derived from nouns, as in (5.35) below:

(5.35)

miwa- ‘feed’

emiwe7 ‘manioc flour’ (independent noun)

uda-

‘light up’ ude

‘light’ (independent noun)

wanya- ‘marry’

wane ‘wife’ (kinship noun)

For a few more verbs, the original base is not clearly recoverable but appears as a formative in other words. This is the case for warya- ‘make turn’ where the form ware occurs in the last syllable reduplicated verb warere- ‘turn’, and for karya- ‘hook’ where the form kare occurs with the -ta allomorph of the passive marker; see §5.1.3 above and §8.1).

Many other transitive verbs have an a vowel in their last syllable. However, it is not clear to what extent this a is the causative suffix or not. More work is needed, including comparison with other Tacana languages.

The transitive verbs buiji- ‘swallow O’ and siiji- ‘absorb O’ are most likely related to iji- ‘drink O’ but the formative bu and si do not occur as independent morphemes in Cavineña.

The transitive verb isaani- ‘sit on top of O’ is most likely related to the verb ani‘sit’ (or its corresponding postural suffix -ani ‘SIT’; §9.1.1) but the formative isa does not occur as an independent morpheme in the language.

A formative prefix i- is found in (at least) three transitive verbs (i is unknown) as

shown in (5.36):

(5.36) i-be-

‘keep O’

be- ‘bring O’

i-kwaya- ‘release O’

kwa- ‘go’

tinu- ‘pull O’

7 Note that the word initial e vowel found in the independent noun emiwe is not found in the putative derived verb miwa-. If the proposed derivation is correct, this could indicate that emiwe was in the past an e-noun with a segmentable e- prefix.

148 The intransitive verb amiku- ‘bleed’ is clearly related to the independent noun ami ‘blood’ (the meaning of the formative ku is unknown).
5.3. Non-inflecting verbs Like inflecting verbs, non-inflecting verbs also head the predicate. Unlike inflecting verbs, however, they cannot take any verbal affixes. These are carried by an auxiliary (intransitive non-inflecting verbs take the intransitive auxiliary ju- ‘be’, while transitive non-inflecting verbs take the transitive auxiliary a- ‘affect’).
This class is less well defined than the inflecting one. The boundary between noninflecting verbs and independent adjectives is not clear cut. The intransitive auxiliary and the copula verb are homophonous (ju- ‘be’). An intransitive non-inflecting verb is not significantly different from an adjective as copula complement of the copula verb.
To date, we have around a 100 non-inflecting verbs. Unlike inflecting verbs, noninflecting verbs are an open class. The class of non-inflecting verbs is probably growing very fast as new items from Spanish keep entering the language.
5.3.1. Basic non-inflecting verbs There are forms for which we cannot find an origin and which we can call ‘basic’ noninflecting verbs. They are listed exhaustively in (5.37) (intransitive forms are given in a., transitive forms in b., ambitransitive forms in c.): (5.37) a. bewai ju- ‘be cursed’
jakacha ju- ‘be absent’ katewa ju- ‘hide’ kuji ju- ‘get lost’ tarepe ju- ‘visit’ yuneri ju- ‘be right’ b. endya a- ‘accept O’ eshu a- ‘cut hair of O’ ijawe a- ‘play with O’ pusha a- ‘lie to O’

149 c. bawe ju- ‘know E, know O’
baekwa ju- ‘not know E, not know O’
The great majority of non-inflecting verbs, however, appear to have come from somewhere else (with different degrees of transparency). These can be called non-basic non-inflecting verbs. Attested origins are borrowing, direct conversion from another word class (often nouns, but also inflecting verbs, adjectives, interrogative words), onomatopoeia and the lexicalisation of an auxiliary-taking modifier (slots B, I and J). These different origins for non-inflecting verbs are discussed in the following sections.
5.3.2. Borrowings A very important number of non-inflecting verbs have their origin in recent loans from Spanish (most are not integrated into the Cavineña phonological system). (Note that lexical loans, no matter what their word class is in the source language, cannot take any verbal suffixes.)
In (5.38) and (5.39), we give the full list of non-inflecting verbs which have been identified as having a lexical loan origin. Intransitive non-inflecting are in a., while transitive non-inflecting verbs are in b. We also provide the origin, the meaning and the word class (nouns in a. and verbs in b.) of the borrowed term in the source language:

Typically, for a given concept, if a noun is available in the source language (essentially Spanish), then the noun is borrowed (even if there is also a corresponding verb). For the concept ‘march’, for example, Spanish has both the noun defile and the verb defilar. But as we can see, it is the noun defile that is borrowed (and becomes the non-inflecting verb defile ju- ‘march’). If there is only a verb for a concept, then the verb is borrowed (as a Cavineña non-inflecting verb). This is the case with aterisa ju‘land’ (from aterisar) and ordeña a- ‘milk O’ (from ordeñar). Normally, as with these two verbs the infinitive form of the verb is taken (in addition to dropping the final r, in order to conform to Cavineña (C)V syllable structure), but not any other inflected form.

5.3.3. Direct conversion
A number of non-inflecting verbs have a corresponding noun. These are listed (exhaustively) in (5.41) (intransitive) and (5.42) (transitive). The list also shows the corresponding nouns (e-nouns are in a., independent nouns are in b.). (Note the interrogative verb ai ju- ‘do what’.)

A few non-inflecting verbs have a corresponding inflecting verb. This is the case with tawi ju- ‘dream’ (tawi- ‘sleep’) (see (5.45a), tsuru ju- ‘meet (intransitive with reciprocal meaning)’ (tsuru- ‘meet O’) (see (5.45b)), mere ju- ‘work’ (mere- ‘work for O, serve) and babi ju- ‘hunt’ (babi- ‘hunt O’).

At least four non-inflecting verbs are likely to be related to a da-adjective (see §11.2): ujeje ju- ‘become sick’ (ujeje- ‘sick’) (in (5.46a)), baa a- ‘make O cooler’ (ba‘cold’), urekada a- ‘tease O’ and misida a- ‘accuse O’ (misi- ‘thick’) (in (5.46b)):

The non-inflecting verb ejebucha a- ‘harm O’ is likely to be related to the interrogative word ejebucha ‘INT:SIMLR’ (§4.5.4).

5.3.4. Inherent reduplication

A number of non-inflecting verbs are likely to have an onomatopoeic origin. This is

quite possibly the case with the inherently reduplicated verbs listed in (5.47) (note that

all these forms denote reiterated actions involving rhythm and often sonorous

components):

(5.47) a. winuwinu ju-

‘shake head’

pedepede ju-

b. shukwishukwi a- ‘giggle at O’

bidubidu a-

‘wag tail’

The inherently transitive non-inflecting verb bibubibu a- ‘wag O (e.g., tail)’ is illustrated in (5.5b) (repeated):

(5.5b)

IwaO =tunaA

bidubidu a-ya…

tail =3PL(-ERG) wag

affect-IMPFV

‘They (my dogs) were wagging their tails….’ wa095

The non-inflecting verb jechiu ju- ‘sneeze’ is also likely to have an onomatopoeic origin.

155 5.3.5. Lexicalisation
A number of non-inflecting verbs are quite transparently the result of lexicalisation following one of the auxiliary-taking processes. One good example is wikamutya ju‘fish with line and hook’. This intransitive non-inflecting verb quite transparently comes from wika ‘hook’ and the transitive verb mutya- ‘dip O’. It is likely that mutya- ‘dip (any) O’ was first turned into mutya a- ‘dip (any) O’ (by the Ø-marked auxiliary-taking process; see §10.5) and then detransitivised by auxiliary alternation (see §8.3.2) together with wika ‘hook’ as its underlying O, giving wika mutya- ju- ‘dip hook’. Finally, this complex (non-inflecting) verb has become lexicalised as wikamutya ju‘fish (not ‘dip a/the hook’).

5.3.6. Transitivity
As with inflecting verbs, non-inflecting verbs have strict transitivity values (there appear to be no ambitransitive verbs). Changing transitivity requires specific valencychanging operations (passivisation, causativisation, etc.). The ratio intransitivetransitive verbs is more balanced than with inflecting verbs. There are as many intransitive non-inflecting verbs as transitive non-inflecting verbs. Only one ditransitive verb has been found (presta a- ‘lend O to O’ (from Spanish prestar ‘lend O to O’). An example of this verb is given in (5.48):

(5.48)

Jutakiju =mi-keO =ØA

[peadya eskupeta]O presta a-ya.

therefore =2SG-FM (=1SG-ERG) one rifle

lend affect-IMPFV

‘I will lend you a rifle (the priest said to me when I told him that I was going alone to visit my family).’ mj030

There are two extended intransitive non-inflecting verbs: bawe ju- ‘know E’ and its negative counterpart baekwa ju- ‘not know E’. These have two core arguments: an S and an E. (These two verbs are most likely related; baekwa ju- is likely be composed of bawe plus a negative suffix kwa (with idiosyncratic deletion of w from bawe). However, such a suffix is unkown.)
The extended intransitive verb bawe ju- ‘know’ is illustrated in (5.49a) (within a conditional clause; §19.5) and (5.49b) (further modified by the auxiliary-taking suffix

156 -kara ‘DESID’):

One could analyse the E argument an O since, similarly to O arguments, it is not casemarked and does not have any rigid order. These does not appear to be a good analysis for (at least) the following two reasons: 1 — the clause is intransitive: the subject is unmarked for case, as an S; 2 — the E argument cannot be coded by a bound pronoun (whereas an O argument can).

9 Derived as follows: bawitya-bawitya-puji [teach-REDUP-ONE.THAT] (see §12.7.1).

157 (Note that non-inflecting verbs derived from transitive verbs by the (historically related) auxiliary-taking suffixes -bawe ‘ALWS’ and -baekwa ‘ALWS.NEG’ — see §10.1.4 —, as well as verbs derived by the reflexive circumfix k(a)-…-ti ‘REF’ in its benefactive meaning — see §8.2.2 —, have the same extended intransitive frame.)

5.4. Justifying the complex predicate analysis
Although the auxiliary obligatorily follows a non-inflecting verb (the order can never be reversed), they form separate constituents. This is shown by the fact that when the predicate comes first in a main clause, second position clitics always attach to the last phonological word of the non-inflecting verb (as they do after any main clause immediate constituents such as NP, PP, independent particle, etc. that come first in a main clause), never to the auxiliary.

This can be seen in (5.51) below with the second position pronoun =tu ‘3SG(-FM)’:

(5.51)

Kwatsabiji =tuS

ju-ya ekwita=tsewe.

tell.story.to =3SG(-FM) be-IMPFV person=ASSOC

‘He is talking with the man.’ di0619

(See also tawi =mi ju-ya ‘are you having a dream?’ at (5.45a).)

In addition, the verb and the auxiliary can always be separated by any clausal constituent. In (5.52) with the non-inflecting verb kuju ju- ‘get lost’, kuji is separated from the auxiliary ju- by the independent particle riyabarepa and the postposition phrase chine=ju ‘at night’:

(5.52)

Kuji =miS

riyabarepa chine=ju ju-chine.

get.lost =2SG(-FM) yesterday night=LOC be-REC.PAST

‘Yesterday night you got lost.’ n5.0589

Additional examples with derived non-inflecting verbs are at (5.53) (with intransitive non-inflecting verbs), and (5.54) (with transitive non-inflecting verbs).

Although discontinuous complex predicates are attested cross-linguistically (as in the Australian language Jaminjung for e.g.; see Schultze-Bernt 2000: 118f.), we need to consider possible alternative analyses.
A first possible alternative analysis could be in terms of a structure of the type complement-to-a-copula-predicate. This is suggested by the fact that the intransitive auxiliary and the copula verb are homophonous. In both cases, the sole argument is coded the same way, both the copula verb and the auxiliary have the same morphological possibilities and both can be omitted. In addition, in both cases, the verb in a complex predicate has to precede the auxiliary (although not necessarily immediately), the same way the copula complement has to precede the copula predicate (see §4.6.3). One might thus suggest that complex predicates should be analysed as copula clauses. There are two reasons why this analysis is not retained: 1 — the copula predicate of a copula clause is very frequently omitted while this tend to be quite rare with the auxiliary of a complex predicate; 2 — in a complex predicate, the intransitive auxiliary ju- alternates with a transitive auxiliary a-, a phenomenon that is not found in a copula clause.

159

An alternative analysis could be that the complex predicate consists of an adjunct and a simple predicate. This is suggested by the fact that the forms ju- (intransitive auxiliary) and a- (transitive auxiliary) are both also found as independent verbs with very generic meanings. (Let us remember that ju- is also a copula verb.) The independent verb ju- is intransitive and means ‘be, exist, happen’ as illustrated in (5.55) below:

(5.55) a. Ju-kware =tuS

[peadya ekwita]S.

be-REM.PAST =3SG(-FM) one

person

‘There was a man (lit. a man was).’ cd002

b. Metajudya =tuS

neiS ju-ya.

tomorrow =3SG(-FM) rain be-IMPFV

‘Tomorrow, it is going to rain (lit. the rain will be).’ di1649

The independent verb a- has a very broad range of meanings, as long as they refer to highly transitive events, with a volitional/controlling A and an affected O argument such as ‘kill, strike, bite, sting, catch (e.g. a fish while fishing), build (e.g. a house), cook, etc., (note that most of these actions can otherwise be expressed by a more specific verb such as, for example, iye- ‘kill’, katsa- ‘strike’, karu- ‘bite’, kemi- ‘catch’, etc.). In this work, this central meaning is captured by the uniformly applied gloss ‘affect’. In (5.56) below, we illustrate the independent verb a- ‘affect’ used by itself:

(5.56) a. … i-keO buna=raA

a-chine.

1SG-FM tucandera.ant=ERG affect-REC.PAST

‘(while I was collecting leaves), a tucandera ant stung me.’ di0354

b. Tu-wa =tu-ja =tuO

sawaO

a-chine…

there-LOC =3SG-DAT =3SG(-FM) benton.fish affect-REC.PAST

‘There he caught a benton fish…’ ft026

What this shows is that there is no crucial difference in meaning between auxiliaries and corresponding independent verbs. All these forms have a strict transitivity value and are

160 very generic semantically. In addition, morphological possibilities are basically the same for all the forms. This could thus suggest that in both cases, there would just be a simple predicate, ju- or a-, and an adjunct modifier to it (non-inflecting component). This alternative is not retained for two reasons. First, non-inflecting verbs are restricted to occurring with only ju- or a- (not with other verbs). Adjunct type constituents in Cavineña (such as independent particles, postpositional phrases, adverbial clauses, etc.) can occur with any verb. Second, a non-inflecting verb obligatorily precedes its auxiliary, whereas an adjunct has free word order.
A third possible analysis could be in terms of complementation with the non-inflecting component filling the O slot of the simple predicates ju- or a-. This is clearly not the case however. We saw that there is a copula ju- with a CC slot but none attested with an O argument. The independent verb a- does have a slot for an O argument. However, the non-inflecting component clearly fills a different slot (always preceding a-, whereas the O argument is not restricted to a certain position in the clause) and both slots can be independently filled in many examples (e.g., (5.5b)).
5.5. Reduplication There are five processes of reduplication associated with verbs in Cavineña, as follows: 1 — verbalisation derivational process of full or last syllable reduplication applies to various word classes (verbs, adjective, nouns) and derive a verb (see §5.2.4 above). This process is not productive. Many verbs are inherently reduplicated;
2 — auxiliary-taking process of full reduplication applies equally to both intransitive and transitive verbs and to both inflecting and non-inflecting verbs. It derives a noninflecting verb with the same transitity value which encodes the meaning of multiple reiteration of the verb event (e.g. tsajaja- ‘run’ and tsajaja-tsajaja ju- ‘run many times’, katsa- ‘beat’ and katsa-katsa a- ‘beat many times’). This process is discussed in §10.6;
3 — antipassive reduplication process of full reduplication only applies to inflecting transitive (and ditransitive) verbs. It derives an inflecting verb (i.e. the derived form can still take verbal inflections) which is intransitive. Syntactically, the reassignment of grammatical functions has an antipassive effect. Semantically, the reduplicated verb denotes an activity (e.g., ara- ‘eat O’ and ara-ara- ‘eat, have a meal’). A complete

161 account of full verb reduplication with antipassive effect is at §8.3.1;
4 — complex verbal morpheme which combines last syllable reduplication of a transitive verb root and the intransitive causativizer suffix -sha (i.e. the causativiser which only applies to intransitive verbs, see §5.1.3 and §8.4.1). This process encodes the fact that the verb event is reiterated many times (e.g., katsa- ‘beat, whip’ and katsatsa+sha- ‘beat up, batter’). A full discussion of this complex morpheme is at §7.1.9;
5 — complex verbal morpheme which involves full reduplication + the Aktionsart suffix -(ne)ni ‘RANDOM’ (see this suffix in §5.1.7 above). The meaning of the RANDOM+ni morpheme is the same as the random suffix -ni used individually. A discussion of this process is in §7.1.8 (together with a discussion of the suffix -(ne)ni ‘RANDOM’).

6 Predicate structure — inflectional morphology
In this chapter we discuss the affixes that go into slot A/K of the predicate (see §5.1 for a presentation of the predicate structure). These consist of Tense-Aspect-Modality (TAM) affixes and command affixes: imperative, hortative and jussive. (There is an additional suffix that goes into slot A/K which is the clause linker -tsu; this suffix is discussed in §18.2.) Slot A/K must be filled by one (and only one) of these markers in any single finite clause (but see some exceptions in §6.1.6). Since slot A/K affixes are obligatory, they are referred to as inflections.
TAM inflections are used in both statements and questions. They are discussed in §6.1. They consist of six suffixes: -kware ‘REM.PAST’ and -chine ‘REC.PAST’ (§6.1.1), -buke ‘REM.FUT (§6.1.2), -ya ‘IMPFV’ (§6.1.3), -wa ‘PERF’ (§6.1.4) and e-…-u ‘POT’ (§6.1.5). We show that these suffixes code a temporal system with three degrees of remoteness in the past (remote vs. recent vs. immediate) and two degrees of remoteness in the future (present/recent future vs. remote future). The two suffixes -ya ‘IMPFV’ and -wa ‘PERF’ have additional aspectual meanings (in addition to their temporal meanings). The circumfix e-…-u ‘POT’, in addition to a temporal (future) meaning, brings a contrast of modality to the system. A verb cannot normally be used without an inflectional marker. But for stylistic effect, it is possible to omit the inflectional marker. This is discussed in §6.1.6.
Verbs used for commands require different affixes (§6.2). First, there are affixes for imperative commands (commands addressed to a 2nd person; -kwe/-ume ‘IMP.SG/IMP.SG.NEG’, ne-…-kwe/ne-…-ume ‘IMP.NSG/IMP.NSG.NEG’). They are discussed in §6.2.1. Second, there are affixes for hortative commands (commands addressed to a 1st person; pa- ‘HORT.SG’, ne- ‘HORT.DL’ and ne-…-ra ‘HORT.PL’). They are discussed in §6.2.2. Finally, there is one prefix for jussive commands (commands addressed to a 3rd person; pa- ‘JUSS’). This prefix is discussed in §6.2.3. After discussing these affixes, we address the following topics: negation of verbs with hortative and jussive affixes (which

163 do not have specific negative forms; unlike imperative affixes) (§6.2.4), noncommand uses of imperative and hortative affixes (§6.2.5), and markedness and historical considerations (§6.2.6).

6.1. TAM inflections

There are six TAM affixes (five suffixes and one circumfix) as given in Table 6.1 and discussed in turn in the following sections:

6.1.1. -kware ‘REM.PAST’ and -chine ‘REC.PAST’ The suffix -kware ‘REMote PAST’ is used to code events that have occurred at a time earlier than a year in the past, as illustrated in (6.1):

The suffix -chine ‘RECent PAST’ is used to code events that have taken place at any time from the day before as far back as twelve months before, as illustrated in (6.2):

(6.2) a. previous day

[Malili=ja e-bakujuna=ke=ra]A =ØO

‘(During the second week of July 1997) we (dl) discussed the trip (lit. talked to one another for the trip).’ (The trip took place between the 18th and 26th of July and its recollection was recorded on 7 August 1997.) vb003

165 c. 11 months ago
Julio=ju Reye=ju [kirika mere] ju-chine. July=LOC Reyes=LOC paper work be-REC.PAST ‘In July (2002) I was in Reyes working on (writing) a book.’ (Said by Alfredo Tavo on 3 June 2003.) n5.0109

Note that (6.1a) and (6.2c), which show the temporal boundary between the use of -kware and -chine, were obtained through elicitation. Informants report that there are variations from speaker to speaker. Apparently some speakers are reported to set the boundary between -kware and -chine at one week’s time (as opposed to one year’s time). The division between -chine and -kware needs more testing and confirmation through text examples.

6.1.2. -buke ‘REM.FUT’
The remote future marker -buke ‘REMote FUTure’ is used to code events that could take place in the remote future. It can also be used to code a less remote event when the speaker is very uncertain that this event will take place.

The remote future suffix is typically used for very remote events such as those that may occur during one’s afterlife, as with (6.3), an excerpt from a recorded conversation between Antonio Yubanera (A) and Ventura Mayo (V). After having talked about half an hour about traditional practices, they comment on the outcome of these recordings for future generations. (Note that Ventura’s utterance overlaps with Antonio’s utterance.)

(6.3) A: … e-bakwa=kwanaS bawe ju-buke…

1-child=PL

know be-REM.FUT

‘(If this linguist does a good job recording and transcribing our conversation,) (our) children will know (about our traditions).’ ab001

V: Ju-buke =tunaS! be-REM.FUT =3PL
‘(Yes) they will!’ ab002

166

A: … [ekwanaS maju-wa=ju].

1PL

die-PERF=DS

‘… after we are dead.’ ab003

V: Maju-wa=ju =tuna-ja =tuO die-PERF=DS =3PL-DAT =3SG(-FM)

adadi-buke. reach-REM.FUT

‘(Yes,) after we are dead, they (our children) will understand (lit. reach) it (the conversation we are recording).’ ab004

Bible prophesies are translated using -buke as in (6.4a) (Joel 2:28-32) and (6.4b) (Luke 3:1-17) (both examples from the dictionary):

(6.4)

a. BadiS =tuS

pudena-buke

ami=bucha.

moon =3SG(-FM) become.very.red-REM.FUT blood=SIMLR

‘The moon will turn red as blood.’ di2274

b. [E-diji benu-benu=kwana=ke]S =tuS

tuyune-tana-buke.

NPF-path twisted-REDUP=PL=LIG =3SG(-FM) straighten-PASS-REM.FUT

‘The crooked roads shall become straight.’ di2782

The remote future -buke need not necessarily refer to such extremely remote events. It can as well be used for more recent events, as long as there is uncertainty about their realisation. Example (6.5), which shows an event set in eight months time, was given as a possible use of this suffix:

(6.5)

I-keS [muke mere=ra]

kwa-buke [peya mara]

1SG-FM brazil.nut work=PURP.MOT go-REM.FUT other time

enero=ju. January=LOC ‘I will go collecting brazil next year in January.’ (Said 3rd June 2003.) n5.0123

167 The dictionary example (6.6a) with -buke was double-checked and discussed with consultants. It means that the speaker does not really think he will give the thing to the hearer (because the speaker knows the hearer most probably does not have the money). But in the same situation, if the speaker has more reason to believe that he will give the thing, he can as well use -ya, as shown by (6.6b):

(6.6)

a. Tya-buke=dya =mi-keO =e-raA [mi-raA etsujekiO be-wa=ju]. give-REM.FUT=FOC =2SG-FM =1SG-ERG 2SG-ERG money bring-PERF=DS

‘I will give it to you when you bring me the money.’ n5.0125

6.1.3. -ya ‘IMPFV’
The suffix -ya ‘IMPerFectiVe’ is used to code the following meanings: 1 — present; 2 — recent future; 3 — generic; 4 — habitual; 5 — past overlapping/on-going/progressive.
In fast speech, -ya ‘IMPFV’ is sometimes realised phonetically as -e when it is followed by the phrasal focus particle =dya ‘FOC’. This always happens when the stem has more than 2 syllables (as in (6.7a)), occasionaly happens when the stem has 2 syllables — perhaps depending on the speed of speech (compare the two instances of ani-ya=dya in (6.7b)), and never happens when the stem has one syllable (as in (6.7c)):

(6.7) a. [K-iye-ti-e=dya]

168 (T1.8) tg037 (T1.40) ba002 (T1.41) mj163 sl082

Note that speakers are not aware of this variation. When asked to repeat these forms slowly/carefully, they invariably use -ya. This suggests that the variation -ya ~ -e may be on the way to creating allomorphs but has still not reached this point yet.

The five different meanings of -ya are illustrated in turn below: 1— present meaning. Examples showing the present meaning of -ya ‘IMPFV’ are given in (6.8).

4 — the past habitual meaning of -ya is illustrated in (6.11). Here an old woman relates how Cavineña women used to prepare corn beer in the olden days (they now do it differently). Although the time frame is the remote past, she uses -ya (not -kware ‘REM.PAST’) to encode the habitual nature of the corn beer preparation:

5 — the past overlapping/on-going/progressive meaning of -ya is first illustrated with (6.12). Here, Ventura Mayo relates a dreadful journey through a highly flooded area (during the rainy season) which he undertook when he was young (the time frame is therefore the remote past). At some point, he had to build a raft in order to cross a river.

171 When the raft was ready, Ventura comments:

‘I was lying on top of the raft (lit. tied sticks).’ mj062

d. Kwa-kware i-keS. go-REM.PAST 1SG-FM ‘(Then) I went.’ mj063
Ventura uses the remote past -kware in the main verbs of a. (‘I lay’ down’), b. (‘I swam’), and d. (‘I went’) because each of these events occurs one after the other (i.e., in a sequence). However, Ventura uses -ya in c., presumably because the event ‘I was lying’ overlapps with ‘I swam’ (from b.) and ‘I went’ (from d.).

Following (6.12) we have (6.13). After having left the river banks and having swam some distance, Ventura relates:

(6.13) a. Nereka-da poor-ASF

kwinana-kware ekwi=ju… emerge-REM.PAST middle.of.river=LOC

‘Miserably, I reached (lit. emerged on) the middle of the river.’ mj064

b. Mu-daCC =tuCS scary-ASF =3SG(-FM)

‘There were scary caymans.’ mj065

172

c. Jetiama e-raA

ba-ya.

many 1SG-ERG see-IMPFV

‘I could see many (of them).’ mj065

Ventura uses the remote past -kware in a. because the event of ‘reaching the middle of the river’ occurs in a sequence with the preceding event (‘I went’, in (6.12d)). However, Ventura switches to -ya in c., presumably because the event ‘I could see many caymans’ overlaps with the preceding event (‘reaching the middle of the river’). In other words, Ventura started to see the caymans before he had reached the middle of the river (and kept seeing them until he finally reached the other bank of the river).

The example in (6.14) is taken from a text in which Alfredo Tavo relates a journey in which he nearly died of thirst. At some point, he found a palm grove. Hoping that he could find water under the ground, he relates:

(6.14)

… puru-kware. Tume uyuuyu=kamadyaS ani-ya=dya.

dig-REM.PAST then mud=ONLY

sit-IMPFV=FOC

‘I dug (the length of my arm). But there was only mud (no water).’ sd024

Alfredo uses the remote past -kware when he relates the event of ‘I dug’ because this event occurs in a sequence with what he has related before (i.e., ‘I arrived at a palm grove’). However, Alfredo uses -ya in the next sentence, presumably because the event ‘there was only mud’ overlaps with the event of ‘digging’.

Verbs in citation form are always given with -ya ‘IMPFV’ (e.g., tawi-ya ‘to sleep’ but not *tawi). Note also that -ya can be used as a strategy to code very strong orders (see §6.2.1).

6.1.4. -wa ‘PERF’ The suffix -wa ‘PERFect’ is used to code the following meanings: 1 — immediate past; 2 — perfect/anterior;
Each meaning is illustrated below:

173 1 — immediate past. An event that has taken place the same day and prior to the time of speech, or during the preceding night requires -wa, as illustrated in (6.15) and (6.16):

(6.15) a. A: AiO =tu-keO =miA

mare-wa?.

INT =3SG-FM =2SG(-ERG) shoot-PERF

slip-PERF

1SG-FM bridge=PERL

‘(I’m soaking wet because) I slipped off the bridge (and fell into the ditch).’ ca008

An example showing the used of -wa for coding an event that has taken place very early in the morning is shown at (6.16a). An example showing the used of -wa for coding an event that has taken place during the preceding night’s sleep, is shown in (6.16b):

174

2 — perfect/anterior meaning is first illustrated with (6.17). Here, Griselda Cartagena relates a trip she undertook with her family in the light plane of the missionaries (the story is therefore set in the remote past — SIL missionaries were in Bolivia in the 6070s). Griselda uses the remote past -kware to relate the landing of the trip. Then, switching to -wa, she says:

(6.17)

[E-kwe ebakwa=kwana]S =bakwe tawi-wa.

1SG-GEN child=PL

=CONTR sleep-PERF

‘My children had slept (during the trip).’ av032

In the story time line, the children’s ‘sleeping’ event has occurred before the family gets down from the plane and is thus reported out of sequence. If Griselda had used -kware, it would have meant that the children went to sleep after they got down from the plane.

Sentence (6.18) is taken from a story by Alfredo Tavo about how, in the olden days, a group of Cavineñas were ambushed by enemies. The Cavineñas hear a suspicious noise (-kware), they realise that an attack has been launched against them (-kware), they run to their weapons (-kware), but it is too late because:

(6.18)

DutyaS ekanaS tibarirya-tana-wa.

all

3PL go.around-PASS-PERF

‘They were (already) all encircled (by the enemies).’ fd029

The event of ‘encircling’, even though narrated after the events of ‘hearing a noise’, ‘realising’, and ‘running’, is not in sequence with them in the story time line. It has occurred before the protagonists ‘hear’, ‘realise’ and ‘run’. If Alfredo had used -kware, it would have meant that they were encircled after ‘running’.

Example (6.19) comes at the end of a story by Antonio Yubanera of a hunter who once (generously) saved a cayman (that was lost in the middle of the forest). Ten years later, the same cayman tries to trick him, ungratefully. Fortunately, the hunter is saved from the cayman by a cunning dog. A the end of the story, the narrator concludes, referring to the two events of ‘saving’:

(6.19)

Tu-raA 3SG-ERG

ikwene matujaO chachane-wa.

‘Hei (the hunter) had first saved (lit. cured) a cayman (about 10 years earlier). Then, (this time,) a dog saved himi’ cd049

The stretch of text where the hunter is described saving the cayman occurs about 40 sentences earlier than (6.19). Here, it is refered to again, to contrast with the ‘dog’s saving of the hunter’. Although the two events strictly speaking occur on after another, they are not in sequence.

6.1.5. e-…-u ‘POT’ The circumfix e-…-u ‘POTential’ is used to codes future events which are contingent the occurrence of another event. The potential circumfix is first illustrated in (6.20):

(6.20) a. E-raA =miO

e-bawitya-u

1SG-ERG =2SG(-FM) POT-teach-POT

‘You (pl) could lose (lit. kill) your children in the Biata river (if you try to cross).’ ri060

The potential circumfix can be used to refer to events which could take place at any time in the future. For example, it has a recent future reading (a few days) in (6.20a) and (6.20b). In (6.21a) below, it has an immediate future reading (the protagonists are about to cross the bridge). And it has a remote future reading in (6.21b) (this example immediately follows (6.3), a conversation between Ventura Mayo and Antonio

Note that the first position particle deka ‘POTENTIALLY’ (§16.2.4) is reinforcing the potential reading in (6.21a).

The potential marker is often used in questions to express soft and polite requests, as in (6.22) (see further discussion in §6.2.1):

(6.22)

E-iya-ti-u

e-raA tu-wa

‘Shall I take him there to the shore (lit. solid ground) (the cayman, who was carrying a man on his back, asked the ox)’ cd030

6.1.6. Verb with no inflectional marking There are occasions when the verb of a main clause occurs as a bare stem (i.e., the verb does not take the otherwise obligatory inflectional morphology). When this happens, the speaker often (but not always) raises the pitch of the overall clause and lower his voice. This phenomenon is not fully understood yet and will require further study.
Mono-syllabic verbs which do not take any further (non-inflectional) morphology receive a (dummy) suffix -u ‘PROP’ (§2.7.6). This is exemplified with the auxiliary ju-

177 ‘be’ in (6.23) (see also the auxiliaries a-u in (6.25c) and ju-u in (6.26b), and ba-u in (6.26a)).

ju-u.

FRUST =1PL

sit-GO.DOWN-DESID be-PROP

‘We wanted to land (but didn’t succeed because there was too much water on the airstrip.’ av024

Bare stem verbs appear to be used in (at least) the following two contexts: 1 — highly predictable events; 2 — repeated event.
We discuss and illustrate each of these two contexts in turn below: 1 — highly predictable events. It was noted that (some) speakers often leave out the inflection of a verb which refers to the target of a motion event. For example, one sentence has an inflected verb meaning ‘go’ (or ‘come’) and the next sentence has a non-inflected verb coding the arrival at the targeted destination. This is shown by (6.24):

‘“It (that place where people live) is said not to be far,” I said (to myself) and I went. Then I arrived at a place with gravels.’ sd104

2 — repetition. It was noted that (some) speakers often use bare stem verbs when they

178 repeat the verb of the preceding sentence (for discourse coherence or for providing additional specifications), as in (6.25):

(6.25) a. Yachi=ju =ØS

Yet in some examples such as (6.26), the reasons why the speaker chooses to use uninflected verbs are not understood (i.e., verb even in not predictable nor repeated). It might be just a question of style:

(6.26) a. … ani-tsura-eti-kware.

The existence of uninflected verbs suggests that slots A/K affixes are not obligatory in Cavineña. It is known that some languages do not have TAM categories as obligatory. In Tariana (Arawak), for example, tense-aspect is established at the beginning of a paragraph by an inflected verb — setting the scene — and the verbs of the following main clauses are unmarked (Aikhenvald, p.c.). Note that in the Cavineña examples above, a clause with a marked verb often precedes a clause without an unmarked one.
In this study, we will nevertheless maintain that slot A/K affixes are obligatory (and inflectional) for the following two reasons: 1 — a verb in elicitation form is never given uninflected (but, as we said, always with -ya ‘IMPFV’); 2 — there is a great deal of variation between speakers on how often they drop the verbal TAM inflections. The women recorded (e.g., Griselda Cartagena in (6.23) or Victoria Tavo in (6.26b)) tend to drop more than men. Some men like Ventura Mayo (in (6.24a) and (6.25a)) or his brother Cosme Mayo (in (6.25c) tend to drop inflections quite often too. Alfredo Tavo, on the other hand, drops inflections only occasionally. In some texts like T1 (which is quite long), he does not leave the inflections from a single verb. This also happens with Gregorio Yubanera in T2.

6.2. Imperative, hortative and jussive inflections
6.2.1. Imperative inflections A verb inflected with imperative morphology has a 2nd person subject (S/CS or A). Imperative morphology is sensitive to (1) a singular vs. non-singular number distinction and (2) a positive vs. negative polarity distinction. The paradigm of imperative inflections is reproduced in Table 6.2:

180
Table 6.2: Imperative inflections

POSITIVE

SINGULAR

-kwe

NON-SINGULAR ne-…-kwe

NEGATIVE
-ume ne-…-ume

Starting with positive imperatives, we illustrate the distinction between singular and non-singular in (6.27). In (6.27a), the command is addressed to a singular 2nd person subject and the suffix -kwe is used. In (6.27b) and (6.27c) the commands are addressed to dual and plural 2nd person subjects respectively and both commands use the same circumfix ne-…-kwe:

(6.27) a. Bute-kwe!

Mi-keS ikwene kueti-kwe!

go.down-IMP.SG 2SG-FM first

‘(You (pl)) go out (of the plane). (You (pl)) take your (pl) luggage out.’ av031

Negative imperatives are illustrated in (6.28) below. A negative singular imperative is shown in (6.28a) and a negative non-singular (plural) imperative is shown in (6.28b)

181 (this is (T1.55)):
(6.28) Negative imperative:
a. Mi-keS ani-kwe! Mi-keS je-ume! 2SG-FM sit-IMP.SG 2SG-FM come-IMP.SG.NEG ‘You (sg) stay (lit. sit)! You (sg) don’t come!’ n1.0167

IMP.NSG.NEG-REF-kill-REF-IMP.NSG.NEG

‘You (pl) are on your own (lit. you are just you). (So) don’t kill each other!’ ao055

Imperative clauses are used very frequently. The same marking is used for a wide range of situations, from mild requests to fairly strong orders, regardless of social status. In (6.29a), for example, a grandfather uses an imperative to address his grandson, while in (6.29b) an imperative is used by a sacristan addressing a Bishop:

(6.29) a. Tudya =tuO

e-baba=ke=raA

y-utsekwa=keO a-kware:

then =3SG(-FM) 3-grandfather=3=ERG 3-grandchild=3 tell-REM.PAST

“Ebajarara tu-eke kwabaO pisu-kwe!”.

‘Then the grandfather told his grandson: “There, untie the canoe, hurry up!” ps024

b. Ba-ti-kwe

see-GO.TEMP-IMP.SG =REP 3DL

‘(When me and my brother arrived at the Bishop house, to ask for his protection, the sacristan announced us to him saying, “Father, there are two Cavineñas here who want to talk to you,) go and see them (d)!”’ gu027

The main way to express various overtones of commands can first be achieved by using various types of modifiers, in addition to the imperative morphology (another way is to

182 not use imperative morphology but use TAM inflections, see below).
Varying the degree of a command can be achieved by verbal affixes (other than inflectional affixes) such as the Aktionsart -wisha ‘FAST’ in (6.27c) which implies an order to be carried out immediately.
It can also be achieved by using particles such as second position particles =bakwe ‘CONTR’ (§16.3.8) or =ni ‘MAYBE’ (§16.3.2), as in (6.30). Here, we have a conversation between a group of Cavineña men (C) who are making fun of Francisco Vaca (F), a newcomer to their community, during his first fishing expedition. Francisco has killed a cayman, an animal that he had never seen before. The men tell him that caymans are good to eat (although Cavineñas do not eat cayman) and that he should take it home. When Francisco refuses to do so, they become pressing and use =bakwe to strengthen their request (first clause). Then Francisco refuses again (second clause). He then tell them politely that they themselves can take the dead cayman if they want, using the particle =ni ‘MAYBE’ (third clause):
(6.30) C: Duju-kwe =bakwe! take-IMP.SG =CONTR ‘Come on! Take it (a dead cayman)! (Don’t leave it!)’ lg028

F: Aijama!

E-raA =tuO

duju-ya=ama.

not.exist.at.all 1SG-ERG =3SG(-FM) take-IMPFV=NEG

‘No way! I’m not taking it.’ lg029

Ne-duju-kwe

=ni

mikwana-ra!

IMP.NSG-take-IMP.NSG =MAYBE 2PL-ERG

‘You guys take it if you want!’ lg033

The second position reportative particle =pa ‘REP’ (§16.3.4) can also be used to soften an imperative command, as in (6.31):

(6.31)

Jeti-kwe =pa! come-IMP.SG =REP

Ba-diru-kwe

=pa!

see-GO.PERM-IMP.SG =REP

183 ‘(Daddy,) come over, he says! Go see him, he says!’ me012
An imperative command can also be strengthened by phrasal particles such as =kwita ‘RESTR’ (§17.5) and =dya ‘FOC’ (§17.4). Alternatively, an imperative command can be softened by using the phrasal particle =piji DIM’ (§17.12).

Orders can also be achieved with other means than imperative morphology, using various imperative ‘strategies’.

In a way very similar to English, a statement with the imperfective inflection -ya in its future meaning, can mean a very strong order which cannot be disobeyed, as in (6.32), a sequence of three clauses (with the last two having the imperative sense) uttered by a missionary lady to a Cavineña family on the penultimate day of their visit at the mission centre:

(6.32)

Re-wa =ekwanaS kultu

ju-ya.

here-LOC =1PL

have.service be-IMPFV

Irisha=ju =mikwanaS church=LOC =2PL

je-ya! come-IMPFV

Despedida =mikwanaS ju-na-ya!

say.goodbye =2PL

be-COME.TEMP-IMPFV

‘(Tomorrow) we’ll have a service here. You’ll come to the church! (And) you’ll say goodbye!’ ri050

Using the regular imperative morphology here would have left open the final decision of ‘coming to the church’ and ‘saying goodbye’ up to the addressee (the Cavineña family), an alternative that is not left with the imperfective -ya.
A very soft and polite request can be achieved by using a polar question with the potential inflection and the negation particle, as in (6.33) (see another similar example in (6.22)):

184 (6.33) E-tya-u=ama =mi-raA =ekwanaO?
POT-give-POT=NEG =2SG-ERG =1PL
‘Couldn’t you give one (radio transmitter) to us (pl)?’ tb066
This request was made to the linguist by a group of Cavineña men. They knew that a short-wave radio transmitter is very expensive and that the linguist could probably not afford it, and they expressed their request in a very soft way.

Another very polite way to formulate a command to a 2nd person can be achieved by making the command as if it was addressed to a 3rd person, using jussive marking (see §6.2.3). This is shown at (6.34). This example comes from the same conversation as (6.33). Cavineñas cannot afford gold rings. When Vidal Mayo saw my gold ring he said:

(6.34)

E-kwe pa-ju metaraS! 1SG-DAT JUSS-be ring
‘Let the ring be mine!’ (i.e. ‘I would like to have your ring!’) tb030

Finally, Cavineña has one interjection that has a clear imperative meaning, kwii, illustrated in (6.35):

(6.35)

Kwii, Kana! go.first Kana

Duju-kwe ekwanaO! take-IMP.SG 1PL

‘(You) go first Kana! (You) take us (there).’ hm105

6.2.2. Hortative inflections A verb inflected with hortative morphology has a 1st person subject (S/CS or A). Hortative morphology is sensitive to a singular vs. dual vs. plural distinction. Unlike imperative morphology, there are no special negative hortative morphemes. Negating a hortative verbs is realised by the regular negative particle =ama (see negation of hortative verbs in §6.2.4.)
The paradigm of hortative inflections is reproduced in Table 6.3:

185
Table 6.3: Hortative inflections

SINGULAR DUAL PLURAL

panene-…-ra

The three number distinctions are illustrated in (6.36). The command is addressed to a 1st person singular in (6.36a), to a 1st person dual in (6.36b) and to a 1st person plural in (6.36c) (this is (T1.14)):

(6.36) a. Ikwene e-raA e-kwe

first

1SG-ERG 1SG-DAT

rimuO lemon

pa-keti! HORT.SG-fetch

‘Let me first fetch a lemon for myself.’ bc026

b. Chine=keja

je-ya

salon=tsewe. Ne-iye

chai=kwanaO!

evening=LOC.GNL come-IMPFV rifle=ASSOC HORT.DL-kill bird=PL

‘I will come late afternoon with my rifle. Let us (dl) hunt (lit. kill) birds!’ tb174

c. Jutakiju gobiernoO ne-baka-ra

[ekwanaO tsawa=ishu]!

therefore government HORT.PL-ask-HORT.PL 1PL

help=PURP

‘Therefore, let’s (pl) ask the government to help us.’ ao014

The singular hortative marker is an interesting feature of Cavineña. (Hortative commands in languages are often restricted to non-singular S/A; Aikhenvald 2003b: 6.) It is used when the speaker expresses his will/intentions to himself (very often, as in (6.19a), the speaker is simply alone and ‘talks to himself’. On the contrary, when the speaker communicates his will/intentions to an addressee, we typically have imperfective (declarative) marking (with future reading). This can be see in the first sentence of (6.19b).

186 6.2.3. Jussive inflection A verb inflected with the jussive prefix has a 3rd person subject (S/CS or A). Here, there is only one morpheme, pa-, which is used for any number. There are no special markers for negative jussive. (Similarly to the hortative, negation is marked by the particle =ama.)

Note that the jussive marker is homophonous with the singular hortative marker, suggesting that the two morphemes are historically related (see discussion in §6.2.6 below).

We illustrate the jussive marker with the three number values: singular in (6.37a), dual in (6.37b) and plural in (6.37c) (this is (T1.20)):

(6.37) a. Esiri=keS pa-diru! old=LIG JUSS-go

Mi-keS ani-kwe! 2SG-FM sit-IMP.SG

‘Let the old one (man) leave! You (sg) stay (lit. sit)!’ mu044

b. Pa-kastere=jari

ekatseS!

JUSS-become.tired=STILL 3DL

‘Let these (two monkeys) get tired (quarrelling ) (and then I will kill them easily)!’ to007

c. Tuna-raA pa-isara-ti! 3PL-ERG JUSS-talk.to-GO.TEMP
‘Let them (the people from CIRABO organisation) go and talk to them (the Araona people who are fighting among themselves)!’ ao020

6.2.4. Negating verbs with hortative and jussive inflections
Unlike for imperative, there is no special negative morphology for hortative and jussive commands. Verbs inflected with hortative or jussive affixes have to be negated similarly to verbs inflected with TAM affixes, i.e., with the negation enclitic particle =ama ‘NEG’ (§17.10). This is illustrated in (6.38) for hortative (singular and plural) ((6.38b) is

187 (T1.19)) and (6.39) for jussive (plural):

(6.38) Negative hortative:

a. Re-keja

i-keS pa-maju=ama!

here-LOC.GNL 1SG-FM HORT.SG-die=NEG

‘(I prayed God and I told him:) I don’t want to die here.’ sd057

b. Jadya ne-a-ra=ama! thus HORT.PL-affect-HORT.PL=NEG ‘Let’s (pl) not do it that way.’ ao019

(6.39) Negative jussive:

Tumebae=dya [mikwana-ja bakwa=kwana]S

also=FOC

2PL-GEN

child=PL

jakacha pa-ju=ama escuela=ju! be.absent JUSS-be=NEG school=LOC ‘Also, your children should not miss (lit. be absent at) school.’ di1648

6.2.5. Non-command meanings
The imperative and hortative morphology can have a non-command meaning. This is found in replies to a command/intention/wish addressed to a first person (with a verb inflected with either hortative or imperfective). Unless the addressee has an objection, s/he normally has to reply by repeating the same verb with the appropriate command inflection (either imperative or hortative) in addition to the emphatic particle =taa.

In (6.40), we have a conversational turn between Elio Tavo (E) and his wife, Mirta (M). Elio informs her that he is going hunting:

(6.40) E: I-ke 1SG-FM

babi=ra

kwa-ya.

hunt=PURP.MOT go-IMPFV

‘I’m going hunting.’

188 M: A, kwa-kwe =taa!
INTERJ go-IMP.SG =EMPH
‘Alright, see you later then! (lit. you go!).’ mp006

In (6.41), a grandfather communicates to his grandchild his wish to go back home (after a fruitless fishing night). He uses dual hortative morphology because this wish includes the grandchild too.

(6.41) A: Ne-diru-nuka HORT.DL-go-REITR

Utsekwa! grandchild

‘Let’s go back, Grandchild!’ ps014

B: Ne-diru HORT-go

=taa baba-chi!” =EMPH grandfather-AFFTN

‘Alright, let’s go then, Grandpa!’ ps016

6.2.6. Markedness and historical considerations Cavineña has overt marking commands addressed to the three persons (2nd, 1st and 3rd person). It is interesting to reflect on the Cavineña system of marking commands from a broader typological perspective.

Cross-linguistic studies have shown that systems used to code commands typically

follow an implicational hierarchy of person distinctions, as follows (from Aikhenvald

2003b: 6):1

2nd

> 1st NSG

>

3rd

> 1st SG

The scale reads as follows. If a languages has any marking for commands, it is expected that it will be a command addressed to a 2nd person. If more complex, the language will also have 1st person non-singular command marking, then 3rd person and finally 1st

1 I have slightly simplified the scale, omitting inclusive/exclusive distinctions which are not relevent for the Cavineña situation.

189 person singular.

The Cavineña system fits the scale quite nicely. It encodes all these distinctions, without any gap. Secondly, it is quite interesting to note that 1st person singular command and 3rd person command have the same form (pa-) and that they look quite different from

the rest of the markers. This sets them both separately from the rest, as they are on the

implicational hierarchy scale above. This can be better seen from the three paradigm

reproduced below in a slightly different arrangement:

IMPERATIVE (2nd)

HORTATIVE (1st)

JUSSIVE (3rd)

-kwe

SG

ne-…-kwe NSG

ne-

DL

ne-…-ra PL

pa-

SG

pa- SG/DL/PL

Note the ‘family resemblance’ that goes accross imperative and hortative non-singular with -kwe and ne- being both shared by two or more markers. On the other hand, the pa-shape of singular hortative and jussive looks very different.

According to the scale predictions, singular hortative and jussive markers should have developed later than the rest. Their origin remains unclear however. They are homophonous with the reportative 2nd position enclitic particle =pa (see §16.3.4) but it seems unlikely that a prefix would develop from an enclitic.

7 Predicate structure — Aktionsart suffixes
In this chapter, we investigate the semantics of the Aktionsart suffixes. As was discussed in §5.1, there are about 30 such suffixes. These suffixes occupy slot H of the predicate.
Aktionsart suffixes are semantically very rich and complex. Their function is to modify the predicate, a function often fulfilled by adverbs in other languages. They encode a wide range of notions having to do with aspect, manner, modality, space and time. According to their semantics, we will sort them here into 4 major classes: (i) aspect/manner (§7.1), (ii) motion (§7.2 and §7.3), (iii) time of day (§7.4) and (iv) emotion (§7.5).
Similarly to adverbs in many languages, some suffixes are event-oriented while others are argument-oriented. Event-oriented suffixes modify the verb event only (e.g. -wisha which encodes the fact that the verb event is performed rapidly). Argumentoriented suffixes modify both the verb event and a particular argument of the verb (e.g. -bare which encodes the fact that the verb event is distributed over S/O arguments).
A number of suffixes are sensitive to the transitivity of the verb stem. They have one variant for intransitive verbs and another variant for transitive verbs. This is the case, for example, with the completive suffix -tere/-tirya (which encodes the fact that S/O argument is totally affected by the verb event), where -tere is used with intransitive verbs and -tirya with transitive verbs.
Up to three Aktionsart suffixes can co-occur in a single predicate (in slot H), provided they are semantically compatible. A full discussion of the distribution of Aktionsart suffixes is given in §7.6.
About half of the Aktionsart suffixes have a corresponding independent verb (e.g.

191 suffix -jaka ‘STOP’ and independent transitive verb jaka- ‘abandon O’). This raises the question of whether the suffixes should rather be analysed as serialised or compounded verbs. This issue is addressed in §7.7, where we show that the suffix analysis is a better one because of the lack of productivity of the putative serialisation/compounding analysis.

7.1. Aktionsart suffixes of aspect/manner 7.1.1. -tere / -tirya ‘COMP’ vs. -bisha ‘INCOMP’ The suffixes -tere/-tirya ‘COMPletive’ and -bisha ‘INCOMPletive’ are argumentoriented. They encode the fact the S/O argument is completely vs. incompletely affected by the verb event.

The suffix -tere/-tirya has the peculiarity that a different form is used depending on the transitivity of the verb stem it occurs with: -tere only occurs with intransitive stems, whereas -tirya only occurs with transitive stems. This is illustrated in (7.1a) (elicited) and (7.1b):

192 The suffix -bisha is very scarce in the available corpus. It only appears in a few examples in Camp and Liccardi’s (1989) dictionary and in some of our own elicited examples. As an illustration, consider (7.2) (intransitive) and (7.3) (transitive):

The suffix -tere/-tirya (and presumably -bisha as well, although we have too few examples to confirm it) can have two different interpretations depending on the number of the S/O referent. If the S/O argument has singular reference (as in (7.1) above),1 the suffix means that the event of the verb applies to the referent as a whole. But if the S/O argument has plural reference, as in the examples in (7.4) below, the meaning is that the event of the verb applies exhaustively to every referent:2

1 Note that plural marking is not obligatory in Cavineña (see §13.3.1). In other words budari ‘banana’ in (7.1) could have a plural meaning even though it is not marked by =kwana ‘PL’. However, Francisco Vaca, who proposed this example, made it clear from his translation that he intended a singular referent in this example. 2 We do not have examples with dual referents. It is thus unclear which meaning of the suffixes would be in that situation.

The suffix -tere ‘COMP’ can be used with speech verbs such as kike- ‘shout’ and mari- ‘roar’ and express a distress/painful situation. This is illustrated in (7.5):

(7.5)

Both -tere and -tirya have corresponding independent verbs: tere- ‘finish (itr.)’ and tirya- ‘finish (tr.)’ respectively. These verbs are illustrated in (7.6):3

(7.6)

a. ArusuS =e-kwe amena

=1SG-DAT FILL

tere-ya. finish-IMPFV

‘I am about to run out of rice (lit. the rice is going to finish to me)’ di2667

3 One might have remarked on the similarity between the two verbs. Indeed, historically, tirya- is a causativized form of tere- via an old causative suffix -a. This suffix is found in a few transitive verbs such as butya- ‘lower’ (from bute-

finish-PERF =3SG(-FM) =1SG.DAT rice

duck=PL=ERG

‘The ducks finished all my rice.’ di2687

There is also a phrasal particle =tere ‘ONLY’ which modifies various types of constituents (NP, adjectives in CC function, postposition, etc.) meaning ‘only, just, etc.’ (see §17.7) and is probably historically related to the Aktionsart suffix -tere ‘COMP’.

7.1.2. -jaka ‘STOP’ vs. -tibune ‘START’ The suffix -jaka ‘STOP’ encodes the fact that the verb event has stopped. It is illustrated in (7.7) (intransitive) and (7.8) (transitive) respectively:

(7.7)

a. … amena neiS =dyadi

ju-jaka-chine.

matujaO.

lake=LOC grab-STOP-GO.PERM-REM.PAST cayman

‘He let go (lit. stopped grabbing) of the caiman in the lake.’ cd007

In the corpus, -jaka also occurs with the intransitive verb bukuku- ‘move’ (bukuku-jaka- ‘stop moving’), and the transitive verbs a- ‘affect’ (a-jaka- ‘stop calling O a certain way’),4 ejene- ‘believe’ (ejene-jaka- ‘stop believing O’) and muba- ‘fear’
‘go down’), nudya- ‘make enter’ (from nubi- ‘enter’), etc. 4 Coming from an example where a- has the semantics of a transitive quotative verb. See §5.4 for a discussion of the semantics of a-.

195 (muba-jaka- ‘stop fearing O’).

This suffix corresponds to the independent transitive verb jaka- ‘move away from, abandon’), as illustrated in (7.9):

=tuA

jaka-kware. abandon-REM.PAST ‘It has been a long time since we abandoned our houses.’ mj158

Note that there is a related auxiliary-taking suffix -jakama ‘CEASELESSLY’ (see §10.1.3).

The suffix -tibune encodes the fact that the verb event is performed (often for the first time with the implication that it will be performed more further on). As an illustration, consider (7.10) (elicited intransitive example) and (7.11) (transitive):

‘Then, after the priests had arrived at the mission, they (Cavineña ancestors) started to use (lit. grab) shotguns.’ di2677

The suffix -tibune has a corresponding independent verb, tibune- ‘begin’, which is transitive. This verb takes as its O argument either a noun, as in (7.12a), or a Ø-nominalised verb, as in (7.12b):

(7.12) a. E-raA =tuO

tibune-ya e-tareO.

tibune-chine ara-araO.

at.eight =3SG(-ERG) start-REC.PAST eat-REDUP

‘I started eating at 8 o’clock.’ n2.0952

The semantic difference between suffix -tibune and the verb tibune- is not altogether clear. Possibly the suffix is used when the verb event is started for the first time, whereas the construction with a complement is used when just focusing on the beginning of one particular instance of the action referred to by the verb stem.

7.1.3. -jeri/-neri ‘ALMOST’ The suffix -jeri/-neri ‘ALMOST’ encodes the fact that the verb event is unsuccessfully realised. It can roughly be glossed by the adverb ‘almost’ in English.5
The form -jeri is used when the predicate is affirmative. The form -neri occurs when the predicate is negative. As an illustration, we have -jeri in the affirmative intransitive predicate in (7.13a) and -neri in the negative intransitive predicate in (7.13b):

Finally, we should note that there are no verbs corresponding to the suffixes -jeri/-neri.

7.1.4. -nuka ‘REITR’
The suffix -nuka ‘REITeRative’ encodes the fact that a verb event is reiterated. It can be roughly translated into English by the constructions ‘V again’, ‘keep V-ing’ or ‘V back’. As an illustration, consider (7.15) (intransitive) and (7.16) (transitive):

The suffix -nuka encodes reoccurrence of an action but not its distribution. In this sense, -nuka differs significantly from suffixes and devices such as -bare ‘DISTR’ (in §7.1.7 below), -ni/-neni ‘RANDOM’ (in §7.1.8 below), -aje/-be/-etibe ‘INCR’ (in §7.1.10 below) or (the auxiliary-taking process of) full verb stem reduplication (see §10.6). With the suffix -nuka, the verb event is repeated ‘externally’. That is, it is repeated with reference to some other instance of a similar event that occurred earlier in the discourse. With distributive suffixes, on the other hand, the verb event is repeated ‘internally’. I.e, it is as if one global event is viewed from the inside and is made up of the repetition of small subevents. This is reflected in that with -nuka, the two (or more) events that make the repetition do not need to be exactly similar. For example, they can have different arguments. This is the case in (7.16b), for example, where only the A argument has the same referent. The O argument of bare- ‘pass’ has a different referent from the O argument of the previous instance of the verb (i.e. a different creek), a fact which is made explicit by the presence of the discontinuous quantifier peya ‘other’. Now, with distributive suffixes/devices, the repeated events are exactly similar in nature and argument structure.
There is a verbal equivalent to the suffix -nuka, namely the transitive verb nuka‘double, fold’, as illustrated in (7.17):

nuka-ya kunuO.

1SG-ERG =3SG(-FM) fold-IMPFV liana

There is also a phrasal particle =nuka ‘REITR’ (see §17.3).

7.1.5. -baka ‘SHORT’ vs. -siri ‘LONG’ The suffix -baka encodes the fact that the verb event is performed for a relatively short time. It is illustrated in (7.18) (intransitive) and (7.19) (elicited transitive):
(7.18) a. Ne-tawi-baka-kwe! IMP.NSG-sleep-SHORT-IMP.NSG ‘Sleep a little bit (lit. a short time)!’ n2.0798

201 ‘He will go and pay you a short visit (lit. he will go verify you) later.’ n5.0443

Even though -baka most often best translates into English with the adverbial phrase ‘a little bit’, we should emphasize the fact that the sense is essentially about the duration of the event, not about the lack of completeness. Lack of completeness would rather be encoded by -bisha ‘INCOMP’ (§7.1.1 above). It is not about lack of intensity either. Lack of intensity is encoded by phrasal particles, such as =piji ‘DIM’ (§17.12) or =jipenee ‘ALMOST’ (§17.15).

The suffix -siri ‘LONG’ has only been obtained in elicitation (while searching for a possible antonym of -baka) and only a few examples are available. Its meaning appears to be the opposite of -baka, namely that the time span of the action is particularly long (possibly for ever). It is illustrated in (7.20) (intransitive) and (7.21) (transitive):

There are two independent verbs in Cavineña with the forms baka and siri,

202 namely the transitive baka- ‘listen, hear, ask, understand’ and the transitive siri‘break, tear’. One might wonder, however, due to the rather striking semantics differences, if these are really the source of the two suffixes. Comparative evidence is needed to clarify this issue.

7.1.6. -wisha ‘FAST’
The suffix -wisha encodes the fact that the verb event is performed ‘fast’. We have very few examples of it. It occurs only once in our texts (example (7.22a) below). It is also found in one example in the dictionary (example (7.22b) below). For the rest, most examples come from elicitation.

The following examples illustrate -wisha with intransitive verbs (in (7.22)) and transitive verbs (in (7.23)):

shake-IMPFV=DS =3SG(-FM) NPF-fruit fall-IMPFV

‘When he shook (the tree), the fruit fell.’ di1461

7.1.7. -bare ‘DISTR’
The suffix -bare ‘DISTRibutive’ has an S/O argument orientation. It encodes the fact that the event is distributed over every individual referent subsumed under a plural S/O argument. It cannot be used with singular or dual S/O arguments.

Illustrations with intransitive and transitive verbs are provided in (7.25) and (7.26) respectively:

‘… the hurricane destroyed (lit. made fall down all over little by little) the forest, the trees, over a distance of about 50 meters).’ hu023

Note that in English, -bare is most often best translated by the quantifier ‘all’ because of the fact that the event distributes evenly to all participants. This could appear to be very similar in meaning to -tere/-tirya ‘COMP’ (§7.1.1 above). The suffix -bare and -tere/-tirya are not synonymous however. The suffixes -tere/-tirya, in the case of a plural S/O argument, emphasize the completion of the event over the totality of S/O referents. The suffix -bare, on the other hand, emphasises the individuation of the event over the S/O referents (even though it often implies that the totality of the reference is affected).

We can compare (7.4a) with (7.25b) (both repeated). In (7.4a), the totality of S referents ‘stand up’ at the same time. The situation is viewed as a whole. In constrast, in (7.25b) above, the totality of S referents ‘go down’ one after another.

Often, informants accompany a verb event with -bare with a gesture pointing in various directions, as if visually emphasizing the distribution of the referents.
This difference between -tere/-tirya and -bare is also reflected in their respective morphosyntax. For example, -bare cannot be used if the S/O argument does not have plural reference, as was possible with -tere/-tirya. Thus compare (7.1a) (reproduced) with (7.27a) and the ungrammatical (7.27b):7
(7.1a) a. Tiru-tere-wa [e-kwe budari]S. burn-COMP-PERF 1SG-GEN banana ‘My banana completely burnt.’ n2.0196

(7.27) a. Tiru-bare-wa [e-kwe burn-DISTR-PERF 1SG-GEN

budari=kwana]S. banana=PL

‘My bananas all burnt.’ n2.0199

b. *Tiru-bare-wa [e-kwe budari]S.

Finally, corresponding to the suffix -bare, there is an independent transitive verb bare- meaning ‘pass, overtake’, as illustrated in (7.28) below (see also (7.16b) above):

(7.28)

Tudya amena =tu-keO =ØA

bare-kware

then FILL =3SG-FM (=1SG-ERG) pass-REM.PAST

7 Note that, as we said earlier, plural is not obligatorily marked in an NP. However, it was clear from Francisco Vaca who volunteered these examples (and gave a translation) that there was only one single banana involved in both (7.1a) and (7.27b).

206 [ebakwapiji tsura-ya=ke]O. small.child go.up-IMPFV=LIG ‘Then, I passed the child who was climbing (and I reached the fruit at the top of the tree first).’ mg011
Note that the meaning difference between the suffix and the verb is quite important. Nevertheless the fact that both have to do with spatial notions suggests that a link between them is not impossible.

7.1.8. -(ne)ni ‘RANDOM’
The suffix -(ne)ni ‘RANDOM’ encodes the fact that the verb event is randomly distributed either over many different places or at many different times (often with habitual sense).

The full form of the suffix (i.e. -neni) is used with mono-syllabic roots (e.g., juneni- ‘roam’ in (7.29b), je-neni- ‘always come’ in (7.30b), etc.) whereas -ni occurs with poly-syllabic root/stems (e.g., tsajaja-ni- ‘run everywhere’ in (7.29a), ju-diru-ni‘always return’ in (7.30a), etc.).

In (7.29), we illustrate the spatial sense of -ni/-neni with two intransitive verbs (no examples of spatial meaning have been found with transitive verbs):

(7.29) a. Tsajaja-ni-kware

=shana

run-RANDOM-REM.PAST =PITY

[e-tata=ke [e-bakwa=keO dadi-ya=ke=ama]]S. 3-father=3 3-child=3 find-IMPFV=LIG=NEG
‘The poor father searched for his child everywhere (lit. ran in many different places), unable to find him.’ eb032

207 yachi=ju. pampa=LOC
‘Going hunting, I roamed (lit. was in many different places) the pampa.’ cz002

In the following, we illustrate the temporal sense of -ni/-neni. Here, the suffix applies equally to both intransitive (as in (7.30)), and transitive verbs (as in (7.31)):

(7.30) a. Barepatya =ekwanaS escuela=juCC=keS ju-diru-ni-kware

We can constrast -ni/-neni with -bare ‘DISTR’ (§7.1.7 above) which also has a component of ‘distribution’ in its meaning. The main difference is one of orientation: -bare is argument-oriented (the distributed sense is about the S/O participants), whereas -ni/-neni is event-oriented (the distributed sense is about the event itself). The two suffixes can actually co-occur, each bringing its own specifications to the verb event, as in (7.32) (see §7.6 for a discussion of ordering of Aktionsart suffixes):

(7.32)

TunaS =dyadi =bakwe tsajaja-ni-bare-kware=dya.

‘They (cattle, sheep, pigs, etc) were all running all over (frightened by the hurricane).’ hu022b

There is a very interesting phenomenon that involves full reduplication of a verb (perhaps also non-inflectional suffixes; see (7.35)) plus the Aktionsart suffix -ni ‘RANDOM’. The meaning of this morpheme is the same as the random suffix in its spatial meaning, i.e. it encodes the fact that the verb event is randomly distributed over many different times (often with habitual sense). No significant differences have been found between the two.

209

We illustrate the complex reduplication+random morpheme in (7.33) (with intransitive verbs) and (7.34) (with transitive verbs):

big-ASF=LIG=EMP =3PL-DAT =3SG(-FM) take-REDUP+RANDOM-REM.PAST

‘They would only bring the big (fishes) (home) (the little ones, they would eat them on the spot).’

In one example, shown in (7.35), complex reduplication+random morpheme involves reduplication of a(n Aktionsart) suffix in addition to the verb root:

210

(7.35) Ari-daCC=ke=kamadyaO =tuna-ja =tuO

big-ASF=LIG=ONLY

=3PL-DAT =3SG(-FM)

be-ti-be-ti+ni-kware. bring-GO.TEMP-REDUP+REDUP+RANDOM-REM.PAST
‘(When our Cavineña grandfathers would go fishing,) they would only go and bring the big fish (home) (while they would eat the little ones on the spot).’ ct126

Note that although be- ‘bring’ and -ti ‘GO.TEMP’ exist independently in the language, it is possible that their combination (i.e., beti-) has undergone lexicalisation, in which case the whole root is reduplicated. More work is needed to refine the status of beti- and to see whether other roots and suffixes can enter the reduplication+random process.

One might want to analyse this morpheme as being two different processes, in which the random suffix would apply after reduplication of the verb. The problem with that analysis is that a fully reduplicated verb root normally either yields an intransitive inflecting verb (with antipassive effect) or a non-inflecting verb (taking an auxiliary). None of these effects occur with the REDUP+RANDOM morpheme. Also, full reduplication normally produces two different phonological words. One consequence is that when mono-syllablic elements are reduplicated, they are given an epenthetic vowel u (e.g., je-u-je-u ju- ‘come many times’). This however does not happen with the REDUP+RANDOM morpheme as can be see with kwa-kwa+ni- (*kwa-u-kwau-ni-) in (7.33a) and pa-pa+ni- (*pa-u-pa-u-ni) in (7.33b). The best analysis appears thus to consider reduplication together with ni as part of one unique morpheme.

Finally, there is no verb corresponding to either -ni or -neni.

7.1.9. Last syllable reduplication + causative
There is a complex derivational morpheme which combines last syllable reduplication of a transitive (never intransitive) verb root and (presumably) the intransitive causativiser suffix -sha (i.e. the causativiser which only applies to intransitive verbs, see §8.4.1). The semantics of this derivation process encode the fact that the (transitive) verb event is reiterated many times over the space or over the O argument referent. For

211 example katsa- ‘beat, whip’ becomes katsa-tsa+sha- ‘beat up, batter’, jikwi- ‘cut off’ becomes jikwi-kwi+sha- ‘cut up’, and sabu- ‘grip’ becomes sabu-bu+sha- ‘mix by squeezing’. Textual examples are provided below.

In (7.36), the O argument has singular reference. Here, the reduplication+causative suffix means that the verb event is distributed on many parts of the O referent:

(7.36) a. Tedi-di+sha-kware

=tuna-ra =i-ke.

rub-REDUP+CAUS-REM.PAST =3PL-ERG =1SG-FM

‘They rubbed me all over (trying to revive me who had fallen down from a tree).’ mg026

In example (7.37) below, we have the narration of the Cavineña people’s destruction of the plantations of their enemies. The destructive acts (cut, pierce, etc.) are performed all over the plantations:

(7.37)

… [[[budari=kwana]O kwere-re+sha],

banana=PL

cut-REDUP+CAUS

[[tama=kwana e-uwaCC=kwana=ke]O sakwa-kwa+sha],

calabash=PL RES-plant=PL=LIG

pierce-REDUP+CAUS

[[shita=kwana]O tubu-bu+sha],

cane=PL

cut-REDUP+CAUS

[[kunukaji=kwana]O sweet.potato=PL

jimi-mi+sha]

jadya] =tunaA a-ti-kware…

pull.out-REDUP+CAUS and =3PL(-ERG) affect-GO.TEMP-REM.PAST

‘… they (Cavineña ancestors) cut the (enemies’) bananas, punched the calabashes they had planted, cut the cane plants, and pulled out the sweet potatoes…’ mk011

The internal form of this morpheme could suggest detransitivisation by reduplication followed by retransitivisation by the intransitive causativiser suffix -sha.

212 This analysis might well account for the historical origin of the process,8 but synchronically there is no productive process of derivation via last syllable reduplication (§5.2.4 and §5.5). None of the reduplicated forms exist on their own (i.e. only the verb root and the reduplicated+causativised forms exist independently). It is thus best to think of a synchronically unique but internally complex suffix ‘REDUP+CAUS’.
It is not altogether clear how productive the reduplication+causative morpheme is. In the data, it is found for about 20 verbs. There might be semantic restrictions. It tends to be found with highly transitive verbs such as jikwi- ‘cut off’, katsa- ‘beat’, karu‘bite’, bere- ‘pierce’, mare- ‘shoot’, etc. But it has not been found for transitive ‘motion’ verbs such as iya- ‘put’, duju- ‘take’, wisha- ‘shake’, etc. nor any perception verb ba- ‘see’, baka- ‘hear’. More work is needed to refine the extent of the use of this process.
The reduplication+causative suffix is associated with a number of idiosyncratic facts. The verb apupasha- ‘erase (like with eraser)’ comes from a verb, apu-, with a slightly different meaning, ‘cover’.
Finally, a number of forms do not have any synchronically identifiable origin. These are listed in (7.38):
8 Note that the A and O referents stay in the same functions before and after reduplication+causative derivation. This means that there are two possible historical scenarios. If the -sha formative was indeed the same intransitive causative marker, partial reduplication would have had to have a passive function, putting the underlying O in S function so that retransitivisation via causativisation would put it back to the O function while bringing back the original A to the A of the reduplication+causative derived verb. The second option is to think of partial reduplication having an antipassive like effect (similar to full reduplication; see §8.3.1) and -sha as a different suffix with an applicative function. In this case reduplication would remove the underlying O referent from the core (putting underlying A to S function) and the putative applicative would bring it back to its original O function (and putting back the underlying S to A function).

7.1.10. -aje/-be/-etibe ‘INCR’
The three suffixes -aje/-be/-etibe ‘INCRementative’ are yet another type of suffix that distributes the verb event (such as -bare in §7.1.7, and -ni/-neni in §7.1.8 above). They encode the fact that the verb event is distributed incrementally over a motion event deictically oriented (i.e. oriented vis a vis a reference point (RP)). They are typically translated into English by ‘go/come V-ing little by little’.
The question of what is the RP is a complex one. It appears to be a matter of choice made by the speaker. He can either choose to see the verb event from his own location at the time of speech or choose a different perspective, in which case the RP shifts to some other location. It is not clear whether or not the hearer can also be taken as the RP.
The three incrementative suffixes differ as follows and are summarised in Table 7.1: — The suffix -aje encodes the fact that the verb event is repeated many times while the S/A argument is moving away from the RP; — The suffix -be encodes the fact that the verb event is repeated many times while the S/A argument is moving (straight) towards the RP; — The suffix -etibe encodes the fact that the verb event is repeated many times while the S/A argument is moving back towards the RP.

214 The semantics which define -aje/-etibe/-be Aktionsart suffixes are quite similar (although simpler) to what is found with motion suffixes to be discussed further below and one might wonder why we have not treated them with these. We chose to discuss them under aspect/manner to emphasise their distributional sense, even though they are really in between the two types of suffixes.

All examples provided so far have shown the verb events literally distributed over space (motion paths). Now, at least with the suffix -aje, we have examples where the distribution is extended to time only. In (7.45a) (intransitive; note that this is (T2.7)) and (7.45b) (transitive; note that this is T1.50)) below, for example, there is absolutely no motion involved and the distribution component of the suffixes has to be understood as being over time rather than over space:

The suffix -aje corresponds to the independent intransitive verb aje- ‘walk, go slowly’ whereas the suffix -be corresponds to the independent transitive verb be‘bring’. There is no identifiable independent verb corresponding to -etibe as such. Rather, this suffix appears to be a frozen combination of two suffixes: -eti ‘come (permanently)’ (see §7.2 below) and -be ‘INCR’. In (7.46) below, we illustrate the independent verbs aje- and be- respectively:

7.2. Aktionsart suffixes of motion (S/A-oriented)
In this section we discuss five suffixes whose semantics are to associate a motion event to a verb event and which are S/A-oriented. In other words, the motion event is about the S/A argument. In the next section, we discuss two more suffixes which are

218 O-oriented, in which case the motion event is about the O argument.

7.2.1. System description The five motion suffixes -nati/-ti ‘GO.TEMP(orarily)’,9 -diru ‘GO.PERM(anently)’, -na ‘COME.TEMP(orarily)’, -eti ‘COME.PERM(anently)’, and -kena ‘LEAVE’, similarly to incrementative suffixes, encode the fact that the verb event is associated with a motion event. Unlike incrementative suffixes, however, all motion suffixes have a punctual (as opposed to a distributed) sense: the verb event occurs only once.

Semantically S/A-oriented motion suffixes make an extremely complex and unusual system. The system is organised as in Table 7.2:

Table 7.2: Semantics of S/A-oriented motion Aktionsart suffixes

durativity temporal relation

temporary permanent

concurrent prior concurrent prior subsequent

orientation

away from RP

towards RP

-nati

-na

-ti

-diru

-eti

-kena

First, there is a distinction between four suffixes that encode a motion event specified for orientation and duration (-nati/-ti, -eti, -diru and -na) and one suffix for which the motion event encoded does not have any of these specification (-kena).

Second, the first four suffixes are organised according to two major oppositions: (1) deixis, whether the motion is oriented towards or away from the reference point (RP) and (2) durativity, whether the motion is temporary (implying a subsequent return) or permanent (implying no return).

The notions ‘temporary’ or ‘permanent’ have to be understood as relative ones.
9 The two forms -ti and -nati have only a slight semantic difference (see below) and are treated as variants of a single suffix. Note also that -nati cannot be (at least synchronically) further analysed as -na + -ti (-na could be related to -na ‘COME.TEMP’).

219 They typically involve the notion of ‘home base’ (the house or the community) of the protagonist (the S/A argument). A temporary motion is oriented away from ‘home base’ while a permanent one is oriented towards ‘home base’. Very often permanent motion means that the S/A argument is going or coming back home, but not necessarily. It can also be the case of a motion towards a new home/community for example.
Note that this system mirrors the sytem defined by the four deictic intransitive verbs kwa- ‘go (temporarily)’, je- ‘come (temporarily)’, diru- ‘go (permanently)’ and jeti- ‘come (permanently)’, although only the last two have grammaticalised as suffixes (see further discussions in §7.2.4 and §7.7 below).
In addition to deixis and durativity, there is an additional semantic opposition that helps make further, even finer, distinctions (notably between the suffixes -nati from -ti ): (3) temporal relation (between the verb event and the motion event), whether the motion event is concurrent (the verb event occurs at some point during the motion event), prior (the verb event occurs at the end of the motion event) or subsequent (the verb event occurs before the motion event takes place).
Taking into account these sets of oppositions Table 7.2 reads as follows: — The suffix -diru encodes the fact that the verb event occurs while (either during or at the end) the S/A argument is permanently moving away from (with the implication of no subsequent return towards) the RP; — The suffix -eti encodes the fact that the verb event occurs while (either during or at the end) the S/A argument is permanently moving towards (with the implication of not return away from) the RP; — The suffix -na encodes the fact that the verb event occurs while (either during or at the end) the S/A argument is temporarily moving towards (with the implication of later returning away from) the RP; — The suffix -nati/-ti encodes the fact that the verb event occurs while (-nati during, -ti at the end) the S/A argument is temporarily moving away from (with the implication of later returning towards) the RP; — The suffix -kena encodes the fact that the verb event occurs before the S/A argument moves away to some other place, regardless of direction (i.e. away from or towards RP) and duration (i.e. temporary or permanent).

220 In the following, we first illustrate the use of suffixes specified for deixis and durativity with the transitive verb ba- ‘see’. The deictically and duratively unspecified suffix -kena is illustrated further below. For each pair of example, the a-example shows concurrent motion while the b-example shows prior motion.

The suffix -nati/-ti ‘GO.TEMP’ is illustrated in (7.47):

‘… I went fishing at the lake. (As I arrived) there, I saw an egret…’ sl012013

In (7.47a), the verb event of ‘seeing (a coati in a clearing)’ occurs while the protagonist (1st person singular in A function) travels to visit his family. The RP is the home of the A argument in which case we have a motion away from RP. And since the protagonist will return home after his visit (after couple days), we have a temporary motion. In (7.47b), the verb event of ‘seeing (an egret)’ occurs while the protagonist (1st person singular in A function) arrives at a fishing place, in which case the motion event that preceded is a temporary one (the protagonist returns home afterwards). The RP is the home of the protagonist which makes the motion directed away from the RP.

221 The suffix -diru ‘GO.PERM’ is illustrated in (7.48):

(7.48) a. MercedeO

ba-diru-kware. see-GO.PERM-REM.PAST ‘I arrived home. Then I saw my sister.’ aj050

In (7.48a), the verb event of ‘seeing (the community of Las Mercedes)’ occurs while the protagonists (1st person plural in A function: the narrator and her family) are returning home (community of Bolivar) after a couple of months of workshops with SIL missionaries at the town of Tumichucua. This is a permanent motion because it is directed towards the home of the protagonists (in which case it does not imply any return). The RP either is the location of the narrator at the time of speech (town of Riberalta) or Tumichucua, for both of which a trip to Bolivar is oriented away from. In (7.48b), the verb event of ‘seeing (my sister)’ occurs when the protagonist (3rd person singular A) arrives back home after a hunting excursion. We thus have a permanent motion since, again, this motion event does not imply any return. The RP here is most probably the last place where the hunter was before arriving home, namely a place in the forest, where he killed a monkey. As such the motion preceding the arrival is away from the RP.

The suffix -na ‘COME.TEMP’ is illustrated in (7.49):

(7.49) a. [Tee=ju je-ya=ke]A

e-raA ba-na-wa

chaiO.

other man be-COME.TEMP-SS pig RES-eat see-COME.TEMP-REM.PAST

‘When the man arrived (at his deserted friend’s house), he saw that the pig had been eaten.’ ti003

In (7.49a), the event of ‘seeing (a bird)’ occurs while the protagonist goes to his field. Since he will not stay (but return home thereafter), we have a temporary motion event. The RP is the location of the protagonist at the time he relates the event to someone else, in which case the motion event is directed towards RP.10 In (7.49) the event of ‘seeing (the pig)’ occurs when the protagonist arrives at the house of his friend. This means that the motion that preceded the arrival is temporary (the protagonist later returns to his own home). As for the RP, it is most likely the place in question, in which case the motion event was oriented towards the RP.

Finally, the suffix -eti ‘COME.PERM’ is illustrated in (7.50):

(7.50) a. Tudya =tuA

jeti-nuka-ya=keA

In (7.50), the event of ‘seeing (a cascavel viper)’ occurs while the protagonist is
10 The fact that (i) the verb event occurs during (as opposed to at the end of) the motion event and that (ii) we have a temporary motion towards the RP is further made explicit in this example by the presence of a ligature phrase with the verb je- ‘come (temporarily)’ with the imperfective inflection -ya (with a temporal adverbial function).

223 travelling back home, which thus implies a permanent motion event. The RP, interestingly, has been taken as the home of the protagonist, thus orienting the motion towards the RP. This is an interesting choice, because the narrator at the time of the story was a school teacher and used to live at the school center. We would perhaps have expected him to relate the story from his own perspective and thus take the school center as the RP. As such we would have had -diru ‘GO.PERM’ instead of -eti here. The reason is probably that in this story further important events occur later at the home of the protagonist, whereas nothing ever happens at the school center. In (7.50b), the event of ‘seeing (me)’ occurs after the protagonist (the narrator’s older brother) has returned home after years of living away. This is thus a permanent motion event. The RP is taken as the home, in which case the motion that preceded the arrival is oriented towards the RP.

We turn now to the suffix -kena ‘LEAVE’. This suffix is rather scarce in the available data. And because of the lack of appropriate examples, it is here illustrated with different verbs than ba-. As we discussed earlier, it differs from all other S/A-oriented suffixes in that, first, the motion event it encodes does not have any deictic or duration specifications and, second, the motion event is subsequent to the verb event (as opposed to prior or concurrent).

This is illustrated with the two (elicited) examples in (7.51a) (intransitive) and (7.51b) (transitive):

(7.51) a. Pa-kena-kware

[Rosa [[tu-ja familia]O shana-ya=ke]]S.

‘As I was leaving, I watched the woman.’ n3.0370

In (7.52) below, we provide a pair of (also elicited) examples which show that the motion event encoded by -kena does not make any distinctions made in orientation (towards RP, or away from RP) or durativity (temporary motion or permanent motion).

224 We can see that the same suffix -kena is used whatever direction or type of motion event the S/A argument is involved in after departure. In (7.52a), we can see -kena used in the situation of a motion away from RP and permanent (encoded by the main verb diru-), and in (7.52b), in a situation of a motion towards RP and temporary (encoded by the main verb je-):

7.2.2. Intended vs. incidental motion There is an interesting semantic (although not formal, and only understood from the context) distinction made by motion suffixes (at least suffixes with deixis and durativity specifications). The distinction reveals itself when looking at the function of motion suffixes in Cavineña and especially when looking at the semantic relation which holds between the verb event and the motion event.
The distinction is whether the verb event is the intended purpose/goal of the motion event (e.g. in English I went and saw O, I went to see O, I went in order to see O, etc.) or whether the verb event is only incidental to the motion event (in which case the purpose/goal of the motion event is a different event) (e.g. in English I saw O as I went to help my brother, I saw O on my way to help my brother, I saw O as I arrived to help my brother, etc.). This distinction, even though not always fully transparent, is nevertheless a very intriguing one to observe.
Looking back at all the examples provided so far, one can see that they are all of the second type. Never is the goal/purpose of the motion event the actual verb event itself. In (7.47a), for example, the purpose of the motion encoded by -ti ‘GO.TEMP’ is ‘fishing’ (not the verb event of ‘seeing an egret’), as made clear by the purpose

225 adverbial clause in the preceding sentence of the same example. In (7.48b), the purpose of the motion encoded by -diru ‘GO.PERM’ is ‘returning home’ (not the verb event of ‘seeing my sister’). In (7.49b), from the context of the story, we know that the man is coming ‘to visit his (unfortunately absent) friend’ (not the verb event of ‘watching the pig’). And in (7.50b) the purpose of the motion is again to ‘be back home’ and the event of ‘seeing me’ is only coincidental (i.e. not intended).

But in other examples, the verb event can be the goal/purpose itself. This is the case with -na ‘COME.TEMP’ in (7.53):

(7.53) a. Ju-na-wa

=riS

CIRABO=juCC=keS.

be-COME.TEMP-PERF =3PROX.SG(-FM) CIRABO=LOC=LIG

‘She (a Pacahuara woman) handed (lit. came and gave) the fish over to me with a lot of respect (lit. with a bowing gesture).’ pa096

Here we can see that the verb event is the intended purpose/goal of the motion. In (7.53a), which is in the imperative mood, the purpose/goal of the motion is ‘seeing (the man from CIRABO)’. In (7.53b), the purpose/goal of the motion is ‘giving (fish to me)’. We can compare the use of -na in (7.53) above with its use in (7.49) where, as we showed, the goal/purpose of the motion is a different event than the verb the suffix occurs with.
We illustrate this further with -ti ‘GO.PERM’ in (7.54) (see also (7.57b)):

11 Lit. ‘Central Indígena de la Región Amazónica de BOlivia’.

‘(One day the missionary sent me to the Chácobo village. He said to me:) “Go to Alto Ivón. Go there and meet (lit. see) the Chácobo people!”’ pa002

Here again, the goal/purpose of the motion encoded by -ti is the verb event itself, namely ‘seeing the chicken’ in (7.54a) and ‘seeing the Chácobo people’ in (7.54b).

Note that its corresponding -nati is never used in this sense, which is consistent with the fact that it never encodes prior motion (but only concurrent motion, see above).

We should note that each motion suffix has its own preferences. The suffixes -na and -ti tend to be used with an intended motion sense. The suffixes -diru and -eti, on the other hand, tend to be used with an incidental motion sense.

The suffix -diru ‘GO.PERM’ in intended function is illustrated in (7.55):
(7.55) a. Jadya=eke =tunaS tu-wa ani-diru-wa thus=PERL =3PL there-LOC sit-GO.PERM-PERF
[ekwana-ja iyakwa e-pu=ju]. 1PL-GEN now NPF-village=LOC ‘This is why they (Cavineña ancestors) have settled (lit. gone to sit) there, where our village is now (because in the previous place, they were constantly attacked by Ese Ejja people).’ hs047

tawi-diru-chine. sleep-GO.PERM-REC.PAST

‘After you told me thus, I went to sleep.’ ka159

In both (7.55a) and (7.55b), the verb event (‘sitting, living’) is understood as the ultimate goal of the motion event. In (7.55a), the Cavineña ancestors move in order to settle to a new place. In (7.55b), the addressee is ordered to move in order to sit on the bench. We can compare these examples with (7.48b) above where -diru implies that the verb event occurs at the end of the motion event but where the goal is different (‘returning home’, as opposed to ‘seeing my sister’).

The suffix -eti ‘COME.PERM’ in intended function is illustrated in (7.56) ((7.56c) shows -eti with the verb ani- ‘sit’):

[NuevoMojo bakani]. NuevoMojo name ‘From there, we left Cavinas (Misión Cavinas), we came and settled (lit. sat) in the place called Nuevo Mojo.’ nk141
In (7.56a), the event of ‘seeing’ is the ultimate goal of the ‘coming’ motion event. Compare with (7.50b) above where, as we said, the verb event of ‘seeing me’ was just a coincidence at the end of the motion event whose primary purpose was ‘returning home’. In (7.56b), again, the event of ‘sitting’ is the goal of the ‘coming’ motion event of the vulture (together with the purpose of eating ‘me’).12 And in (7.56c), the event of ‘settling (lit. sitting) at the place called Nuevo Mojo’ is the ultimate and intended goal/purpose of the motion.
7.2.3. Foregrounded vs. backgrounded motion In addition to the intended vs. incidental semantic distinction, there is yet another difference between the two types of use of the motion suffixes (this time also including -kena ‘LEAVE’). This distinction is more of a pragmatic nature and has to do with foregrounding vs. backgrounding.
Motion suffixes with intended function encode foregrounded motion. Motion suffixes with incidental function encode backgrounded motion. Motion suffixes with an intended function encode motion strictly speaking. That is, they specify that in addition to the occurrence of the verb event, there is occurrence of a motion event. The motion event and the verb event are two subparts of one macro-event, and the two sub-events are tightly knit together. The motion event encoded by motion suffixes with an
12 Note that in these two examples, we would rather expect -na than -eti since, strictly speaking, the people who are asked to come (in (7.56a)) and the vulture (in (7.56b)) will not stay forever (but return to their ‘home base’ at some point). The way we understand the choice of -eti in (7.56a) (this example is from the dictionary and we do not have the context) is that it is intended to inform the people that a village meeting will take place, a practice which always happens in Cavineña villages when a new-comer arrives and which always runs for at least half a day. In (7.56b), it is likely that the vulture stayed a very long time, at least from the point of view of the speaker.

229 incidental function, on the other hand, is largely independent from the verb event. It is a motion event that is already going on when the verb event occurs, and it functions as a background to it (strictly speaking not part of it, as is the case with intended function).

One observation with incidental function that corroborates this distinction is that, even though there is often actual motion of the protagonist while performing the verb event, as with the verbs tapa- ‘step on’ in (7.57a), isara- ‘greet’ in (7.57b) and ijewe‘throw’ in (7.57c) below, this is not an obligation. As can be seen with the examples in (7.58) below, it is clear, from the type of verbs (tawi- ‘sleep’ and ani- ‘sit, stay, live’) and the context they occur in that the protagonist is not moving at all while performing these events:

If we turn to the suffix -kena ‘LEAVE’, since the motion it encodes follows the verb event, the element of ‘goal/purpose’ (and thus the distinction intended/incidental) is irrelevant to the discussion. But the pragmatic distinction of foregrounded vs. backgrounded still holds for this suffix.

There is actually no intransitive verb ‘leave, depart’ in Cavineña.13 Instead, intransitive motion verbs such as aje- ‘walk, go slowly’, tsajaja- ‘run, or the deictic verb kwa- ‘go (temporarily)’, je- ‘come (temporarily)’, diru- ‘go (permanently)’ or jeti‘come (permanently)’ can just subsume the meaning of departing from a place, together with the meaning of moving to another place. But apparently, the departing meaning can be specified with these verbs when taking the suffix -kena. This is what happens in (7.59):

In these examples, -kena has a strong foregrounded meaning, since the meaning of ‘departing’ only comes from its presence in the predicates.

Now we can compare the previous examples with (7.60) with (7.61):

‘… they (dl) grabbed their bows and arrows and they went hunting.’ tu006

Example (7.61a) is the way to ‘say goodbye’ in Cavineña, namely to ‘greet when one leaves’. What -kena encodes here is rather the manner of greeting, i.e. the particular words which will be said, etc., rather than actually encoding that departure (which is a backgrounded event, probably already known to the hearer).
In (7.61b), the actual event of departing is encoded separately with the verb kwa- ‘go (temporarily)’. The use of -kena in this examples is rather to encode a particular type of ‘grabbing’, perhaps a faster gesture, etc.
In other words, in these two examples, -kena has a more modifying role than encoding an actual departing motion, and it has a more backgrounded sense.

7.2.4. Corresponding verbs
One question that we have not dealt with so far in the description of motion suffixes is whether there exist any independent verbs corresponding to the forms found as suffixes. Only two suffixes have a possible corresponding independent verb: (1) -diru corresponds to the intransitive verb diru- ‘go (permanently)’ and (2) -eti corresponds to the intransitive verb -jeti ‘come (permanently)’ (with idiosyncratic process of deletion of the glottal fricative j). No corresponding forms have been identified for -nati/-ti, -na and -kena. We illustrate each of these two verbs in (7.62):

7.2.5. ‘Leave’ and ‘arrive’
We already saw that the Cavineña lexicon does not have a verb for ‘leave, depart’, and that this meaning is expressed by the motion suffix -kena used together with a general verb of motion, such as the various verbs of ‘going’ and ‘coming’, or verbs for ‘running’ or ‘walking’, etc. Interestingly, Cavineña does not have any verb for ‘arrive, reach’ either. In a quite similar fashion, this meaning is achieved by using a motion suffix (either associated motion or motion with purpose) together with the verb ju- ‘be’. We therefore have as many predicates of ‘leaving’ as there are semantic distinctions made by motion suffixes, as in the following (we do not make the intended vs. incidental or foregrounded vs. backgrounded distinctions here):

7.2.6. S/A-orientation The motion suffixes described in this section are S/A-oriented. They code a motion event associated with the S argument (if the verb is intransitive) or the A argument (if the verb is transitive) (but never that of the O argument).
The S/A-orientation and the semantics of these suffixes in Cavineña makes them strikingly similar to the category of ‘associated motion’ as described in some Australian languages (see, among others, Koch 1984, Tunbridge 1988 and Wilkins 1991). They are also very similar to the category of ‘motion-with-purpose’ described in some Mayan languages (see, among others, Robertson 1980, Haviland 1991, 1993, Aissen 1994 and Zavala 1994). Similar categories (although often called differently) have also been reported in the North-American language Atsugewi (Hokan, California, Talmy 1985) and the South-American languages Yagua (Peba-Yagua, Peru, Payne 1984)), Asheninca (Arawak, Peru, Payne 1982) and Matses (Panoan, Peru, Fleck 2003: 364).
These motion suffixes contrast with directional suffixes (-tsura ‘GO.UP’, -bute/-butya ‘GO.DOWN’ and -sikwa ‘GO.AWAY’; see §9.2) which are S/O oriented and

235 encode path/trajectory rather than motion. (See Guillaume 2000b for a discussion directional, associated motion and motion-with-purpose categories in Cavineña and other languages.)

7.3. Aktionsart suffixes of motion (O-oriented)
In this section we discuss two remaining suffixes, -tsa ‘COME(O)’ and -dadi ‘GO(O)’, whose semantics is also to associate a motion event to a verb event but with the difference that the motion is about the O (as opposed to S/A) argument. One corrolary to the O-orientation of the suffixes -tsa/-dadi is that they only occur with transitive verb stems.

The suffix -tsa encodes the fact that the O argument is moving towards the A argument while the suffix -dadi encodes the opposite, namely that the O argument is moving away from the A argument. Since the choise of -tsa vs. -dadi always depends on the orientation of the motion vis a vis the A argument, this argument is taken as the obligatory RP. The suffixes -tsa/-dadi are thus radically different from all the previous suffixes, first, because they denote motion of the O argument (as opposed to S/A) and, second, because they have a strict RP which is the A argument and which cannot be shifted (as is the case with the previous suffixes).

The pair of examples in (7.66) below illustrates the semantic opposition between -tsa and -dadi:

(7.66) a. Tume =pa =taa =tu-ja =tuO

ba-tsa-ya

ekwitaO…

then =REP =EMPH =3SG-DAT =3SG(-FM) see-COME(O)-IMPFV person

b. [Peadya ekwita]O =tukeO =ØA

ba-dadi-wa…

one person =3SG-FM (=1SG-ERG) see-GO(O)-PERF

‘I saw a man (running) away (from me) (with the stolen duck).’ ju008

In both (7.66a) and (7.66b), the verb events of ‘seeing’ are associated with a motion event which concerns the O argument exclusively. There is no reference whatsoever to

236 the motion (if any) of the A argument. And, as the two examples in (7.67) below show, it is perfectly possible to have A arguments which are totally at rest:

(7.67) a. Kunu=raA =ØO

ina-tsa-kware.

liana=ERG (=1SG-FM) grab-COME(O)-REM.PAST

‘I got stuck in the middle of the lianas (lit. the lianasi grabbed me as I was moving towards themi).’ ba089

‘Hei (the nephew, lying half-dead on the ground) could hardly talk to his unclej when hej leant over towards himi.’ hm165

In (7.67a), at least from the context (one could possibly conceive a situation where lianas could move), it is the O argument (‘I’) that moves into the lianas (in A function), not the reverse. In (7.67b), as shown by the translation, the A argument (the nephew) is about to die, making it clear that it is the O argument (the uncle) that does the moving.

We can also compare -tsa/-dadi with S/A-oriented suffixes in (repeated) examples (7.48a), (7.57b) and (7.60) below. The motion event associated with the ‘seeing’ or ‘drinking’ events cannot apply to the O argument. In (7.48a) the O referent is a place (the community of Las Mercedes), in (7.57b), it is a human referent which is ‘lying on the ground, unconscious’ and, in (7.60), it is a ‘soft drink’. All these types of O referents definitely cannot be associated with a motion event (at least in the context of the stories they come from), thus making it clear that, unlike -tsa/-dadi, for these motion suffixes the motion event is about the A (or the S in intransitive verbs):

iji-kena-wa. drink-LEAVE-PERF
‘Nothing! Just a soft-drink I had (before leaving my house) (thus I told them when they asked me what I had drunk, because of my swollen belly).’ lv033

We said that in terms of orientation, -tsa/-dadi have the A argument referent as

the obligatory RP. The RP cannot be shifted to the speaker’s location for example

(unless the speaker is the A argument himself, but in which case there is no shift). This

is in stark contrast with the other motion suffixes for which the RP can always be

shifted. This can be diagrammed as in (7.68) and (7.69) below, which represent possible positions in space of Speaker, A referent and O referent (the symbols ‘←’ and ‘→’

represent the motion of the O argument):

(7.68) -tsa

a. (Speaker)

A←

O

b.

A←

O

(Speaker)

(7.69) -dadi

a. (Speaker)

A→

O

b.

A→

O

(Speaker)

This property of -tsa/-dadi is hard to demonstrate directly with examples because it is always difficult to know for sure where the RP is when it can be shifted. But what the data consistently shows is that whenever the O referent moves towards A, the suffix -tsa is used and whenever it moves away from A, the suffix -dadi is used. If the RP could be shifted from the A argument to some other place, such as the location of the speaker for

238 example, one should expect to have -tsa used in situations such as (7.69b), i.e. where O moves towards RP (speaker), but away from A, or -dadi used in situations such as (7.68b), i.e. where O moves away from RP (speaker) but towards A. But these situations never occur, a fact that we take here as a good diagnostic for the RP obligatorily being the A argument.

We further illustrate -tsa and -dadi with various other verbs in (7.70) and (7.71):

7.4. Aktionsart suffixes of time of day Cavineña has four verbal suffixes whose function is to encode the fact that the verb event is performed at, or is somehow associated with, a particular time of the day.

The suffixes differ according to two dimensions: (1) time of day: dawn (-wekaka) vs. dusk (-apuna) vs. day (-chinepe) vs. night (-sisa) and (2) aspect: punctual (-wekaka and -apuna) vs. prolonged (-sisa and -chinepe). This is summarised in Table 7.3:

Table 7.3: Semantics of time of day Aktionsart suffixes

dawn dusk night day

punctual -wekaka -apuna

prolonged
-sisa -chinepe

The suffix -wekaka encodes the fact the verb event occurs at (or is somehow associated with) dawn. It is illustrated in (7.73) (with intransitive verbs) and (7.74) (with transitive verbs) (note that (7.74a) is (T2.13)).

tomorrow =3SG-FM (=1SG-ERG) clothes=PL

wash-AT.DAWN-IMPFV

‘Tomorrow I will wash the clothes early in the morning.’ n5.0439

Note that reference to dawn is made twice in sentence (7.74a). It is made by the suffix -wekaka as well as by the independent verb wekaka- ‘be at dawn’14 in a periphrastic adverbial clause. This is typical of many examples. One might wonder what is the rationale for such redundancy. The reason for this is that in addition to specifying dawntime, the suffix -wekaka appears to have the sense of ‘first thing in the morning’. In (7.74a), it would mean something like ‘the first thing he saw was the skin of this wife’. In other words, he did not see anything else before seeing the skin of his wife. And, probably, this also gives an emotional effect for depicting the horrible vision of seeing one’s spouse reduced to a skin on the ground.
The use of -wekaka with kwa- ‘go’, as in (7.73a), could also have the ‘first thing in the morning’ effect (the author, who took part in the trip related by (7.73a), clearly remembers that the crew resumed the trip right after waking up, without taking any breakfast or anything).
We can compare (7.73a) with (7.75), below, where we have a similar periphrasic mention of dawn-time but where we do not have the -wekaka suffix on the verb kwa-. In (7.75) , unlike (7.73a), some time and some activities (such as taking a bathe, having breakfast, etc.) could have taken place between the waking up of the protagonist and the departure for a hunting excursion:
14 The verb wekaka- ‘be at dawn’, which can also mean ‘wake up’, is most likely the source of the suffix -wekaka, see below.

An interesting semantic effect is found with tawi- ‘sleep’ where tawi-wekaka- means ‘oversleep’. (Note that Cavineña people tend to wake up before dawn so that it makes sense that ‘waking at dawn’ means having slept more than is normally expected.)

The suffix -apuna encodes the fact that the verb event occurs at (or is somehow associated with) dusk. We unfortunately only have very few example of this suffix. It is illustrated in (7.76) (with intransitive verbs) and (7.77) (with a transitive verb):

The suffix -chinepe encodes the fact that the verb event occurs all day long, as illustrated in (7.78):

242

tawi-chinepe-ya.

naru-chinepe-kware. take.care.of-ALL.DAY-REM.PAST ‘There, an elder looked after my older brother all day long.’ qu076

The suffix -sisa, finally, is the miror image of -chinepe, encoding the fact that the verb event occurs all night long, as illustrated in (7.79):

(7.79) a. Meta =tuS

neiS ju-sisa-kware.

Note that there is redundant reference to night-time in (7.79a) with the time adverb meta ‘at night’. But again, in addition to night-time, the morpheme -sisa specifies that the verb event occurs all night long and not just at some point during the night. The adverb meta, on the other hand, only specifies night-time and nothing else, as in (7.80) below where there is no suffix -sisa on the main verb kwa- ‘go (temporarily)’. In this example, nothing implies whether ‘I’ hunted all night or for just a few hours.

As we already mentioned (see footnote 14), the suffix -wekaka corresponds to the intransitive verb wekaka- ‘be at dawn’ (derived from the noun weka ‘light’ by reduplication of the last syllable; see §5.2.4). This verb accepts either an impersonal subject (‘it was dawn, dawn broke’) or a personal one (‘we were at dawn, we woke up at dawn’). As for the suffix -apuna it corresponds to the intransitive verb apuna‘become dark’ (itself a verbalised adjective apu- ‘dark’ + -na ‘VBLS’; §5.2.3). Both independent verbs are illustrated in (7.81):

(7.81) a. Apu-apu =riS

wekaka-wa.

dark-REDUP =3PROX.SG(-FM) be.at.dawn-PERF

apuna-kware. become.dark-REM.PAST ‘When I was almost there, it was getting dark.’ sd068

There are no obvious verb corresponding directly to either -chinepe or -sisa. Possibly, -chinepe comes from the intransitive verb chine-, a synonym of apuna-, meaning ‘be at dusk’ with a formative ending pe ‘different from’ (see §12.7.8).

7.5. Aktionsart suffix of emotion The suffix -jara/-wana ‘ADVERSative’ expresses a wide range of emotions, mostly

244 negative, that the speaker has concerning the verb event or upon the S argument referent (if the verb is intransitive) or the O argument referent (if the verb is transitive). The form -jara occurs on intransitive verbs while the form -wana occurs on transitive verbs.
The most common emotion expressed by -jara/-wana is anger, as illustrated in (7.82) (intransitive verbs):
(7.82) a. Maju-jara-wa die-ADVERS-PERF ‘Someone whom I don’t like died.’ n3.0102a

‘Keep laughing and I will whip you right away, damn it! (my father told my mother who was laughing at him because he came home soaking wet, having fallen in a spring).’ ca012

Note that -wana is external to the situation related. Unless the speaker is an argument of the verb event himself (as in (7.83b,c), for example), the emotional content does not apply to any protagonists but the speaker only. This is shown by (7.83a), where the A argument (someone from the village) still does not know who the O argument is (a dangerous traitor) at the time of the story. As a consequence, it cannot be said that the feeling of anger applies to the A argument referent. The narrator, on the other hand, does know who the O argument is and he uses the suffix -wana on the verb ba- ‘see’ to express his emotion.

In the following, we illustrate -jara/-wana expressing various nuances of discontent (other than anger): disgust in (7.84), regret in (7.85), pity in (7.86), disappointment in (7.87)), confusion in (7.88)) and distrust in (7.89):

The suffix -wana is most likely part of the non-segmentable verb ijiryawana‘make fun of O’ although the ijirya part of the word cannot be identified outside of this verb.
The origin of -jari/-wana is a rather surprising one. It comes from the intransitive/transitive pair of postural verbs jara- ‘lie’ and wana- ‘lay O’ illustrated in (7.90):

7.6. Distribution
Aktionsart suffixes occupy slot H of the predicate. It is quite common for two (or even three) Aktionsart suffixes to co-occur in a single verb. In (7.91), for example, we illustrate various combinations of the suffixes -tere ‘COMP’, -aje ‘INCR’, -bare ‘DISTR’, -eti ‘COME.PERM’ and -nuka ‘REITR’:

(7.91) a. Amena [i-keS riwi-wa=ju] jukuri=kwanaS ea-keja

table=LOC

ani-eti-bare-nuka-chine. sit-COME.PERM-DISTR-REITR-REC.PAST
‘After going there (to the toilets), we sat back around the table (at the market).’ br046

There do not appear to be strict ordering restrictions. For example, we have the order -bare-eti in (7.91b) and the reverse order -eti-bare in (7.91c). A difference in order tends to correlate with a meaning difference. In (7.91b) where -eti ‘COME.PERM’

249 has scope over -bare ‘DISTR’, the ‘coming’ motion is not distributed (the missionary lady and the two Cavineña women are on their way back home). In (7.91c), on the other hand, where -bare has scope over -eti, the coming motion is distributed (each person moves to one side of the table and sits).

Some suffixes code different values of a system. These never co-occur. This is the case with motion suffixes. For example, the verb peta- ‘look at O’ can take the motion suffix -diru ‘GO.PERM’ (peta-diru- ‘go and look at O’). It can also take the motion suffix -tsa ‘GO(O)’ (peta-tsa- ‘look at O while O is going away’). However, peta- cannot take both suffixes at the same time (*peta-diru-tsa- or *peta-tsa-diru-).

There are at least six paradigms of mutually exclusive suffixes, as follows: — (in)completive suffixes (§7.1.1):
-tere/-tirya ‘COMPletive’ -bisha ‘INCOMPletive’

— ‘start’ vs. ‘stop’ suffixes (§7.1.2): -jaka ‘STOP’ -tibune ‘START’

— ‘short (time)’ vs. ‘long (time)’ suffixes (§7.1.5): -baka ‘SHORT’ -siri ‘LONG’

— incrementative suffixes (§7.1.10): -aje ‘INCR’ (motion away from RP) -etibe ‘INCR’ (return motion towards RP) -be ‘INCR’ (direct motion towards RP)

— motion suffixes (S/A-oriented in §7.2) and S/O oriented in §7.3):

-nati/-ti ‘GO.TEMP(orarily)’ -kena ‘LEAVE’

-diru ‘GO.PERM(anently)’

-tsa ‘COME(O)’

-na ‘COME.TEMP(orarily)’

-dadi ‘GO(O)’

-eti ‘COME.PERM(anently)’

250 — time of day suffixes (§7.4):
-wekaka ‘AT.DAWN’ -chinepe ‘ALL.DAY’ -apuna ‘AT.DUSK’ -sisa ‘ALL.NIGHT’
More work is required to find out whether the remaining suffixes belong to one of these paradigms, form additional paradigms or simply form a paradigm by themselves.
Table 7.4 shows all attested combinations of two Aktionsart suffixes (from different paradigms) found in texts and supplemented by some combinations obtained through elicitation (the full list of elicited combinations is given in (7.92) below the table) — note that no systematic attempt was made to investigate all possible orders. Each attested combination is cross-referenced to an illustrative example to be found in this chapter. Combinations which are attested in either order are coded by cells with thick borders. Combinations not found are coded with a question mark ‘?’. Note that an Aktionsart suffix never occurs twice (as coded by a strongly shaded cell). Glosses of the suffixes are reproduced below the table. (Note that the complex suffix REDUP+CAUS (§7.1.9) is never combined with any other suffixes and has not been included in the table.)

The table shows that some suffixes (those to the right of the table such as -aje-etibe/-be ‘INCR’, motion suffixes and -nuka ‘REITR’) can apparently be combined with all other suffixes. They also tend to have scope over (i.e. follow) the other suffixes (they will be called high-scope suffixes). Some other suffixes (those to the left of the table such as -tere/-tirya/-bisha ‘(IN)COMP’, time of day suffixes, or -wisha ‘FAST’), on the other hand, are hardly found combined with any other suffixes. They also tend to fall under the scope of (i.e. precede) the other suffixes (they will be called low-scope suffixes). When low-scope suffixes can follow (i.e. have scope over) high-scope suffixes the reverse order is always attested.

Note that the table does not take into account suffixes occurring on the copula/auxiliary verb ju-, as this verb tends to have idiosyncratic properties and is not representative of regular verbs of the language. For example ju- ‘be’ allows motion suffixes to be followed by -tere ‘COMP’, as in ju-eti-tere- (be-COME.PERM-COMP-), or by -(ne)ni ‘RANDOM’, as in ju-diru-ni- (be-GO.PERM-RANDOM-) (see (7.30a), whereas these sequences are never attested with other verbs.

Aktionsart suffixes can also combine with other verbal suffixes (presumably with semantic restrictions).

254 7.7. Suffixes vs. compounded/serialised verbs? As we have seen, many suffixes have a corresponding independent verb. This brings up the question of whether the Aktionsart morphemes should rather be analysed as compounded/serialised verbs instead of suffixes. According to the typological literature on verb serialisation (see, for example, Aikhenvald 1999, 2002), they could be analysed as assymetrical serial verbs since one verb comes from a large and open class (any verb can be the first verb in Cavineña) and the other from a restricted class (we only have about 30 Aktionsart suffixes). Semantically, the verb from the non-restricted class denotes the event and provides the transitivity value for the whole construction, whereas the verb from the closed class only provides a modification.
This analysis is however not retained here, for the main reason that such a process is not productive in Cavineña.
First, we lack an equivalent verb for many suffixes (roughly half of them). In the following table, we summarise the suffixes and their corresponding verbs (when available):

‘walk, go slowly’ ‘bring O’
‘come (permanently)’ ‘go (permanently)’
‘find’ ‘be at dawn’ ‘become dark’
‘lie/lay O’

Often we miss forms within a single paradigm. If we look at the paradigm of eight motion suffixes (S/A and O-oriented), for example, we only have corresponding verbs for three of them (diru- ‘go (permanently)’, jeti- ‘come (permanently)’ and dadi‘find’). For the rest (-nati, -ti, -na, -kena and -tsa), no independent verbs are attested. If we had true serialisation, we should expect other deictic verbs such as je- ‘come (temporarily)’ or kwa- ‘go (temporarily)’ to form part of the paradigm. And, crucially, these two verbs would be expected instead of -na and -nati/-ti respectively since they have the exact same semantics (temporary motion away form RP and temporary motion towards RP, respectively).

256 Second, at least one suffix (-eti ‘COME.PERM’) shows phonological erosion from its corresponding verb (from jeti- ‘come (permanently)’), a fact that we would not expect if we had productive serialisation. Third, in addition to the fact that very often no corresponding form is attested for a given Aktionsart suffix, when we do have some possible forms, they very often have quite different semantics. Thus note the difference between the verb dadi- ‘find’ and the suffix -dadi ‘action performed while O is going away from A’, the verb baka- ‘listen, hear, ask, understand’ and the suffix -baka ‘a short time’, the verb wisha- ‘shake’ and the corresponding suffix -wisha ‘action performed rapidly’, the verb bare- ‘pass O’ and the corresponding suffix -bare ‘verb event distributed over S/O referent’, etc. For all these reasons, an analysis in terms of suffixes is preferred and adopted here, even though it is highly possible that verb serialisation is a very likely scenario for the diachronic origin of such forms, and what we see is an advanced stage of grammaticalisation.15 Comparative and historical work is however needed to confirm this hypothesis.
15 A similar phenomenon appears to have occurred with Japanese where the verbal suffixes, according to some scholars (e.g. Quinn 1990) orginated as serial verbs.

8 Predicate structure — valency-changing mechanisms

The range of devices that have valency modifying effects in Cavineña are morphological (by verbal affixes or reduplication of a verb root) (these occupy slot C/G of the predicate) as well as syntactic (exchange of auxiliaries).

There are three valency-decreasing mechanisms and one valency-increasing mechanism, as shown in Table 8.1:

-ta(na)

causative -sha/-mere/-kere

reflexive

k(a)-…-ti

antipassive 1) reduplication

2) exchanging auxiliaries

Valency-reducing mechanisms are discussed first: passive in §8.1, reflexive in §8.2 and antipassive in §8.3. The valency increasing mechanism, causative, is discussed in §8.4.

Both inflecting verbs and non-inflecting verbs behave similarly with respect to passive, reflexive and causative. (One minor difference is that the copula/auxiliary ju‘be’ has causative suppletive forms.) With respect to antipassive, however, inflecting verbs and non-inflecting verbs behave differently. The antipassive an inflecting verb is derived by reduplication while the antipassive of a non-inflecting verb is derived by exchanging the transitive auxiliary (a- ‘affect’) with the intransitive auxiliary (ju- ‘be’).
1 Note that an a ending has been identified as a causative formative in a few transitive verbs (e.g., nitya- ‘make stand’ from neti- ‘stand’; see §5.2.6). This suffix, which appears to have been a causativiser of intransitive verbs, is synchronically totally unproductive and is not further discussed in this chapter.

258
It is possible to have a combination of two valency-changing mechanisms (within slot C/G) in addition to combinations with affixes/processes from other slots. This is discussed in §8.5.

8.1. Passive derivation
The suffix -ta(na) only applies to transitive verbs.2 It can be called a passive marker since it turns a transitive verb into an intransitive one with the original O argument becoming the S argument of the derived verb and the original A being obligatorily omitted. The difference between -tana and -ta is not clear. They both occur in the same phonological environments and with the same meaning (see further below). All we can say at this stage is that the form -tana is used much more frequently than -ta. In this work, they are treated as free variants of the same morpheme.

The basic syntax of the passive derivation is illustrated with a pair of elicited examples in (8.1):

(8.1)

a. Roberto=raA kashiO

ara-ya.

Roberto=ERG sweet.banana eat-IMPFV

‘Roberto eats sweet banana.’ n2.0510

b. KashiS

ara-tana-ya.

sweet.banana eat-PASS-IMPFV

‘Sweet bananas are eaten.’ n2.0511

The suffix -ta(na) can have two major functions, which partly depend on the semantic type of the verb it applies to: an agentless function and an anticausative function (in terms of Dixon and Aikhenvald’s 2000b terminology): 1 — ‘agentless’ function: the passive encodes the fact that the identity of the agent in a transitive event (i.e. with an agent acting over a patient) is left unexpressed, even though its action over the patient is still part of the meaning of the event.
2 A handful of idiosyncratic exceptions are discussed at the end of the section.

259 2 — anticausative function: the passive encodes the fact that the event is not carried on by any agent (original A) anymore but by the original patient (original O) itself spontaneously.

The two types of functions are illustrated in turn below: 1 — The agentless function of the Cavineña passive can be seen in example (8.2) below, which comes from a description of a traditional Cavineña cart (in a photo). In this sentence, the cart is used as the underlying O of the transitive verb tsume- ‘use’. An agent is still semantically implied to perform such a event (a cart cannot perform the event of ‘using’ by itself), but here it does not refer to any particular referent (here the agent is any person owning such a cart):

(8.2)

Jadya=tibu =tuS

[tumeCC=ke e-majaka=ju]

thus=REASON =3SG(-FM) there=LIG NPF-space=LOC

[jeeCC=ke karetu]S here=LIG cart

tsume-tana-ya… use-PASS-IMPFV

‘For that reason (i.e. in Cavineña communities, there aren’t any motorised vehicles), this (rudimentary) cart is used in these places.’ ft023

Example (8.3) below comes from a procedural text on how to make a traditional canoe. In the two sentences here, the canoe is the underlying O of the two transitive verbs rure‘carve’ and a- ‘affect’. Here again, an agent is semantically implied to perform such actions (a canoe cannot ‘carve’ or ‘make’ by itself). However, since the narrator is talking about a technique or procedure, the agent can be anybody involved in these activies, in which case the passive is used in order to leave the agent’s identity unexpressed:

(8.3)

a. Ikwene=dya =tuS

e-duku=ju

rure-tana-ya.

amena.

affect-PASS-IMPFV FILL

‘And then finally its (the canoe’s) side is made.’ ab179

The examples in (8.4) below come from a story which relates how one day (in the olden days) a group of Cavineñas were ambushed by wild enemies (presumably Ese Ejja people) and were all killed, and how the remaining Cavineñas decided, as a result, to settle in a different place. In this story, the enemies are never explicitely mentioned, probably because their true identity was never known. In clauses where the Cavineñas are the underlying O of transitive verbs and where the enemies are the agent, a passive form of the verb is used:

(8.4)

a. DutyaS ekanaS tibarirya-tana-wa.3

‘After they (the group of Cavineñas) had been killed (lit. finished), the ones that were still alive started to think: “let’s go to (and live in) some other place!”’ fd039-040

d. Ne-diru-ra=dya! HORT.PL-go-HORT.PL=FOC

Tirya-tana-ya=dya =ekwanaS. finish-PASS-IMPFV=FOC =1PL

3 Tibarirya- ‘go around’ is transitive in Cavineña.

There are rather few examples with passivised non-inflecting verbs. In all the examples available, the passive derivation is combined with other morphological processes.

In (8.5) (this is (T2.2)) we have passivisation of jucha a- ‘have sex with O’ — which becomes jucha a-ta- ‘have sex’ — followed by suffixation of the auxiliary-taking negative desiderative marker -karama ‘DESID.NEG’ (§11.2.1) — resulting in jucha a-takarama ju- ‘refuse to have sex’:

‘When they (the woman and her husband) were sleeping (in the mosquito net), she refused to have sex.’ mm003

In (8.6) the verb katsa- ‘beat O’ is first fully reduplicated, giving katsa-katsa a- ‘beat O repeatedly’ (i.e., a non-inflecting derived verb; see §10.6 on the auxiliary-taking process of full reduplication), then passivised into katsa-katsa a-tana- ‘be beaten repeatedly’.

In addition to tsume- ‘use’, rure- ‘carve’, a- ‘affect’, tibarirya ‘go around’, iye ‘kill’ and tirya ‘finish’ (which have already been discussed), the passive suffix is also found with an agentless meaning in the verbs given in (8.7):

2 — The anticausative function of the Cavineña passive is illustrated in the following examples. In (8.8a), the speaker relates an event when he fell from a tree and hit the branches on his way down. He uses the verb -katsa ‘beat, whip’ with the passive suffix. In (8.8b), quite similarly, the speaker relates the event of bumping and getting caught into lianas which is described using the transitive verb karya- ‘hook’ with the passive suffix. In both examples, the protagonist is the underlying O of the verb and is also the instigator of the ‘hitting’ event, not the branches or the lianas.4 In other words, there is no agent involved, either formally or semantically:

4 Neither ‘the branches’ nor the ‘the lianas’ (both in locative case) can be agents (either formally or semantically) because the verbs katsa- ‘beat’ and karya- ‘hook’ obligatorily require animate agentive subjects. 5 The choice of the verb katsa- ‘beat’ to depict this situation is an interesting one. The speaker could have chosen a more direct way with a different ‘hitting’ verb which does not require an agentive (i.e. acting with intention) subject (such as chika- ‘bump into’) and would not have required passive morphology. The choice of -katsa suggests that the event of ‘hitting the branches’ is like being ‘beaten/whipped’ as a punishment (in this story he was not supposed to climb that tree). 6 Body parts and the the body to which they belong are treated as same by the same subject adverbial clause marker -(a)tsu.

263 ‘(As I was running after the coati) my feet got caught (lit. hooked) into lianas and I fell down.’ te013

Examples (8.9a) (an example volunteered during eliciation) and (8.9b) below further illustrate underlyingly transitive events that happen spontaneously without the intervention of an agent.

In addition to rake- ‘break’, katsa- ‘beat’, karya- ‘hook’, dyuru- ‘shorten’, kware-

‘change’ and tibi- ‘detach’ (which have already been discussed), the passive suffix is

found with an anticausative in the verbs in (8.10):

It is unclear to what extent the distinction between agentless or anticausative meaning is linked to the semantic type of verbs. I have not found any clear examples of verbs taking the passive with one meaning in one case and the other meaning in the other. Now we would also expect all the verbs listed under (8.10) above (anticausative meaning) to allow for an agentless meaning since they are all transitive and allow for an agent when non-derived. But we would not expect the reverse, i.e. for the verbs listed in (8.7) (agentless meaning) to allow an anticausative meaning. Anticausative meaning can

264 normally only obtain with verbs denoting an event that can occur spontaneously. Thus for verbs such as iye- ‘kill’, ara- ‘eat’, iji- ‘drink’, pika- ‘plait’, etc., we would expect only an agentless meaning. But for some other verbs we do not see why they could not also have an anticausative meaning, such as chaja- ‘tear’, siri- ‘break’, teri‘close’, murya- ‘wet’. More work is needed on this topic.

We said that both forms -tana and -ta are found in similar phonological environments and with the same meaning. Compare (8.4c) and (8.4d) above, for example, which both have the passivised verb tirya- ‘finish’. Even though the first uses -ta and the second -tana, there is no obvious semantic differences between the two. Another contrasting pair of text examples is in (8.11) below, from a similar story where two Cavineña brothers are killed by enemies. Both sentences express the same basic idea, namely ‘they/we got killed’, but the first makes use of -tana while the second -ta.

(8.11) a. “A-tana-wa

‘“So you see (Uncle), we (me and my brother) got killed!” (the half dead nephew said to his uncle).’ hm167

In terms of their distribution in the texts, as we already said, -tana is used much more frequently than -ta. As a result, we have rather few good text examples with the suffix -ta, and the question of whether there is a semantic difference still remains open.
What happens with ditransitive verbs (baka- ‘ask O for O’, kweja- ‘inform O of O’, seka- ‘steal O from O’ and tya- ‘give O to O’)? Can both Os become the S of the derived verb? What happens to the second O? We have unfortunately very few examples of passivised (as well as reflexivised, ‘antipassivised’ and ‘causativised; see

265 following sections) ditransitive verbs. Through elicitation, however, Francisco Vaca volunteered the two examples in (8.12) with kweja- ‘inform’ showing that both original Os can become the S of the passivised verbs:

(8.12) a. Kweja-ta-ya

=tuS

iyakwa barepatya=kwita noticia=kwanaS.

inform-PASS-IMPFV =3SG(-FM) now midday=RESTR information=PL

person=PL

=3SG(-FM) now inform-PASS-IMPFV trip=PURP.GNL

‘The men are informed about the trip (they are about to undertake).’ n3.0182

This pair of examples also shows that the other original O (i.e. the one that has not become an S) is not expressed either.

The forms -tana and -ta are found lexicalised in many verbs in which either the syntax and/or meaning is idiosyncratic or the base is synchronically unidentifiable.

An idiosyncratic effect is found with the pair of transitive verbs jipe- ‘approach O, move close to O’ and jaka- ‘abandon O, move away from O’, where the suffix -tana (the verbs are not attested with -ta) has an antipassive effect: the underlying A (not the O) becomes the S and the underlying O is demoted to an optional ablative postpositional phrase.

In (8.13) we illustrate this phenomenon with jipe- ‘approach, move close to’. Example (8.13a) shows the verb without the passive marker. Examples (8.13b) and (8.13c) show the passivised forms:

(8.13) a. [Tura=kamadyaA ijetiO jipe-kware=tibu]

=pa =tuCS

3SG.ERG=ONLY sun approach-REM.PAST=REASON =REP =3SG(-FM)

approach-PASS-IMP.SG =STRG.EMPH 1PL-LOC.GNL FILL

‘Come close to us!’ di1771

When jipe- ‘approach, move close to’ is used in its non-derived form, the subject referent moves of its own will and intention (and can be characterised as an agent). Thus in (8.13a) the sun bird moves toward the sun of its own will. When it is used with the passive suffix, it does not move of its own will and intention anymore but under the control of an external agent (and can thus be characterised as a patient). In (8.13b), the cloud does not choose to move closer to the sun but moves under the control of the wind. In (8.13c), the verb is in imperative mood which means that the subject is ordered to move and as a result does not move of its own will.

In (8.14) below we illustrate the use of the passive suffix on the verb jaka- ‘move away from, abandon’. Similarly, (8.14a) shows the underived use of the verb whereas (8.14b) and (8.14c) show the verb with the passive morphology:

(8.14) a. [E-kariO a-aje-ya=ke]O

jaka-wa.

move.away.from-PASS-IMP.SG a.little.bit middle=LOC.GNL

‘Move away (from the shore) a little bit to the middle (of the river)!’ n3.0464

Quite similarly, when jaka- is used in its underived form, the subject is an agent, as in (8.14a) where the protagonist moves away from the path of its own will (to follow a group monkeys in order to kill them). When jaka- is used with the passive, on the other hand, the subject is a patient, as in (8.14b) and (8.14c). In (8.14b), the log raft, as an inanimate entity cannot move by itself but under some external force. In (8.14c), similar to (8.13c) above, the verb is in the imperative mood, so that the subject has to move under an order by an external agent.

Returning to syntactic considerations, with these two verbs, unlike the others, when the passive is used, the derived S argument does not come from the original O but from the original A. If the S resulted from the original O with the verb jipe- in (8.13b), we would have expected either ‘the sun’ as the S, reading ‘the sun was approached’ or ‘something approached the sun’ with no mention of ‘the clouds’. And similarly with jaka- in (8.14b), we would have expected the beach as the S, reading ‘the beach was left’ or ‘something moved away from the beach’ and with no mention of the raft.

This effect of the passive on jipe- and jaka- resembles what an antipassive derivation does. This is only attested for two verbs and might just be an idiosyncratic phenomenon. The passive form of a similar verb, tibarirya- ‘go around’ (i.e. a transitive motion verb with the subject as the moving figure), does not have this result (see (8.4a) above). But yet the behaviour of similar verbs should be checked (e.g. sita- ‘approach unnoticed’, bare- ‘pass’, dunu- ‘surround, rike- ‘cross’, tsuru- ‘meet’, tupu- ‘follow’, etc.) to reach a conclusive statement.

As for the form -ta, it is found with an idiosyncratic meaning in the following verbs:

(8.15) sipi-ta- ‘stick’

(*be repaired)’ < sipi- ‘repair O’

apu-ta- ‘disappear’ (*be covered)

< apu- ‘cover O’

268 paja-ta- ‘become white’ (*be painted white) < paja- ‘paint O white’

There is also a large number of verbs which end with tana or ta but for which either the base is not a transitive verb but a different word class, or is not synchronically identifiable any more.

Starting with -tana, with the five verbs in (8.16) below, an adjective can be (at least partly) identified as the origin of (at least part of) the base:

(8.16) abaka-tana- ‘be silent’

<

bidu-tana- ‘move (like fish)’ <

jie-tana- ‘be better’

<

saru-tana- ‘break’

<

tipiru-tana- ‘turn upside down’ <

abaka- ‘silent’

bidubidu ‘wagging’

ji-

‘good’

saru-

‘toasted’

tipirutipiru ‘turning upside down’

One form, dyake-tana- ‘be worse’, appears to be derived from an adverb, dyake- ‘very’.

For the two verbs in (8.17) below, a noun can be identified as (at least part of) the base: (8.17) akwase-tana- ‘turn downside up’ < -akwa ‘chest’
sapara-tana- ‘start with arms up’ < sapara ‘small stick, fingers’

For the verbs in (8.18) below, we have no synchronically identifiable base:

(8.18) kwami-tana- ‘be crushed’

rukwi-tana-

‘stretch’

pakara-tana- ‘move away’

shudiri-tana- ‘slip’

peseke-tana- ‘turn on the side’ tijeru-tana-

‘go backward’

pesi-tana-

‘flood’

tipuse-tana-

‘make a loop’

puje-tana-

‘appear’

wapa-tana-

‘be pierced’

ra(/u)ju-tana- ‘come off’

wipuchi-tana- ‘bow’

Similarly, the verbs in (8.19) below do not have any identifiable base, apart from their

patterning with the causative -sha (see §8.4.1):

(8.19) jeku-sha- ‘scare O’

jeku-tana-

‘be scared’

rikwi-sha- ‘make O jump’

rikwi-tana-

‘start, shiver’

puti-sha- ‘make O jump’

puti-tana-

‘start, jump’

ruju-sha- ‘go through O’

ruju-tana-

269 ‘get on a path’

We also have two other verbs which appear to be (idiosyncratically) derived from

nouns. They are given in (8.20):

(8.20) naka-ta- ‘get wet’

< -na

‘water’

muru-ta- ‘become ashes’ < muru ‘ashes, dust’

Three verbs appear to be derived (idiosyncratically) from adjectives, as in (8.21):

(8.21) shabi-ta- ‘get tender’

< shabi- ‘tender’

tsunu-ta- ‘be late’

< tsunu- ‘long (time)’

ushu-ta- ‘go down, deflated’ < ushuri ‘skinny’

For the remaining verbs in (8.22) below, if the ta ending is indeed the passive suffix, we

have no clue as to what the orginal base could be:

(8.22) iyuma-ta- ‘roll up’

tada-ta- ‘get solid’

kuju-ta- ‘get blisters’

weji-ta- ‘dry (rice)’

putu-ta- ‘explode’

As compared with passives in other languages, the range of functions of the Cavineña passive is quite restricted.
Unlike other languages, there is no particular emphasis on the resulting state. Such a function is encoded by (derived) resultative adjectives (see §11.3.4).
Also, the Cavineña passive does not strictly speaking focus on the O argument (since there is no specific agent to contrast it with) and it does not have any particular discourse function (such as topicalisation functions).
The origin of the passive suffixe -ta(na) might be a 3rd person (plural) bound pronoun with ta marking 3rd person and na marking plural number. This is suggested by the fact that the form ta marks 3rd person in the present day dual pronouns (ta-tse ‘3-DL’) and na marks plural number in present day 3rd person plural pronouns (tu-na ‘3-PL’ and re-na ‘3PROX-PL’) (see §§15.1.2-2.2). Although, stricktly speaking, the form that combines with na in the present day language is tu (not ta), the similarity is quite

270 striking. In addition, the grammaticalisation path from 3rd person (at least plural) pronoun to impersonal marker and/or to passive marker is widely attested crosslinguistically (see examples in Heine and Kuteva 2002: 235f.).
8.2. Reflexive derivation The circumfix k(a)-…-ti, similarly to the passive marker, only applies to transitive verbs. It turns a transitive verb into an intransitive one, with the underlying A becoming the S argument of the derived verb. The syntax of the underlying O depends on the function of the circumfix (reflexive, reciprocal, benefactive, or patientless reflexive, see below). It can either be omitted or demoted to an extended core argument (E).
The full form ka-…-ti applies to verbs which begin with a consonant (e.g., ka-bajeje-ti‘prepare onself’ in (8.24a), ka-mare-ti- ‘shoot at each other’ in (8.25a), ka-peta-ti- ‘look at each other’ in (8.25b), etc.). The reduced form k-…-ti applies to verbs which begin with a vowel (e.g., k-utsa-ti- ‘wash oneself’ in (8.24b), k-iya-butya-ti- in (8.27b), etc.). (One exception is ka-adeba-ti- ‘foretell’ from adeba- ‘know’ at (8.32b).)
The Cavineña reflexive circumfix k(a)-…-ti is interesting for its wide range of functions. In addition to encoding prototypical reflexivity (the underlying A referent is, strictly speaking, the same entity as the underlying O referent), it is also used with the following effects: 1 — k(a)-…-ti can encode reciprocity (the underlying A and O referents are simultaneously agent and patient);
2 — k(a)-…-ti can be used in a situation where the underlying A and the O referents are distinct but have a special semantic bond (possession, benefaction, etc.). Here the underlying A and O referents do not ‘merge’ (as they do with reflexivity and reciprocity), which correlates with a slightly different syntactic pattern. Here the O argument is not omitted but is demoted to an extended core argument (E) (and the underlying A becomes S). For this use of the reflexive, we will use the cover term ‘benefactive reflexive’.7
7 Extension of reflexive proper to benefactive reflexive is also attested in the Australian language Yankunytjatjara (Goddard 1985: 128) and some Tibeto-Burman languages such as Dulong (LaPolla 2000).

271

3 — k(a)-…-ti can be used with a patientless antipassive meaning (in terms of Dixon and Aikhenvald’s 2000b terminology). Here the underlying A and O referents are distinct and do not ‘merge’. But unlike all other functions, there is no particular identity or bond whatsoever between the underlying A and O referents. What happens here is that the underlying O is left unspecified semantically. Syntactically, it is altogether omitted. The semantics of this function is to focus on the action itself. We will call this use of the reflexive the patientless reflexive.8

Table 8.2 below summarises the four different functions of the Cavineña reflexive circumfix:

The syntax of the four types of functions are illustrated with the verb peta- ‘look at’ in (8.23a-e):

8 Extension of reflexive marking to antipassive function is attested in some Australian languages, such as Diyari (Austin 1981: 153). 9 Note that the simple coding given here does not capture the fact that there can be more than two participants in a reciprocal relation (i.e., Ag1/Pat2, Ag2/Pat3/, Ag3/Pat1, Ag2/Pat1, etc.)

8.2.2. Benefactive reflexive The benefactive reflexive has a number of different nuances. It is illustrated and discussed with a number of different examples below.

In (8.27), the reflexive circumfix is used on motion verbs (shana- ‘leave’, iya- ‘put’ and shura- ‘hang’) which results in the underlying O referent being separated from its underlying possessor A referent. The reflexive morphology emphasises that the bond still holds and that underlying A referent intends to recover their possession.

In the examples in (8.28) below, the reflexive circumfix used on the verbs kemi- ‘buy’, duju- ‘take’ and tyana- ‘cap’ encodes the fact that these actions performed over the underlying O referent benefit the underlying A referent exclusively (and not anybody else).11 (Note that (8.28c) is (T2.4).)

‘(After having pushed his wife outside the mosquito net) he (the husband) adjusted (lit. capped) the mosquito net; he adjusted it very well for himself.’ mm004

11 This use of the Cavineña benefactive reflexive is very similar to the Ancient Greek middle voice marker (also called ‘indirect reflexive’) (Bakker 1994: 34-36).

276 In (8.29), the reflexive is used with an O referent which is the body part of the underlying A referent:

(8.29)

Jadi=ke =pa =tuS

thus=LIG =REP =3SG(-FM) calf

REF-cut.off-REF-REM.PAST

‘Thus he cut off his (own) calf.’ ho072

With the perception verbs ba- ‘see’ and peta- ‘look at’ the reflexive can have the sense of ‘inspect’ or ‘examine’, i.e. ‘see’ or ‘look at’ with particular concern for the way the underlying O referent might affect the A. This is illustrated in (8.30) and (8.23d) (repeated):

(8.30)

‘The lady examined her skinny dog carefully (concerned that he could be sick).’ n3.0209

The syntactic nature of the E argument is an interesting one for which we do not have any clear answer at the present time. What is clear is that E is not an O argument (although both are unmarked for case). Evidence for this is that unlike an O argument, an E cannot be represented by a bound pronoun.

This can be illustrated with (8.28a) (repeated). It is impossible to include a bound pronoun referring to makina=kwana ‘machines’ (such as =tu-ke ‘3SG-FM’ in (8.28a’)) unless the reflexive marker is removed from the verb (as in (8.28a’’):

In (8.28b) (repeated below) it is again impossible to have a bound pronoun referring to the mochila ‘bags’ (such as =tu-ke ‘3SG-FM’ in (8.28b’)), unless the reflexive morphology is removed from the verb (as in (8.28b’’):

8.2.3. Patientless reflexive In the following examples in (8.31) below with patientless reflexive meaning, the underlying O referent is left unspecified because the focus is on activities (‘crossing’,

278 ‘rowing’, ‘barking’ and ‘sweeping’) as opposed to the event being performed on a particular entity:

‘Why the hell did this (woman) come! She (my wife) has not swept (and the floor is still dirty).’ ci027

The cognition verb adeba- ‘know’, using the reflexive circumfix and not specifying the underlying O referent, can have the meaning of ‘foretelling, suspecting’. It is as if the event of ‘knowing’ is only partially performed over the O argument. Thus compare the

279 pair in (8.32):

(8.32) a. Dutya=raA =tu-keO =ekwanaA adeba-ya all=ERG =3SG-FM =1PL(-ERG) know-IMPFV

Other examples of patientless reflexive derivations are k-isara-ti- ‘talk’ (from isara‘greet O’) and ka-peta-ti- ‘watch’ (from peta- ‘look at O’).

8.2.4. Miscellaneous
What happens with ditransitive verbs? Which of the two Os (theme or recipient for tya‘give’, message or ‘communicatee’ for kweja- ‘inform’, etc.) can be co-referential with/enter in a reciprocal relation with the agent? Although we have very limited data, it appears that neither of the two Os have priviledged relations within a reflexive derivation.

The verb kweja- ‘inform’ is attested with reflexive morphology with reciprocal meanings. Here the reciprocal participants are the agent and ‘communicatee’. An example is at (8.33):

(8.33)

Ka-kweja-ti-chine

=yatseS biaje=ishu

REF-inform-REF-REC.PAST =1DL travel=PURP.GNL

‘We (dl) discussed the trip (lit. we informed each other about the trip).’ vb003

280 The verb tya- ‘give’ marked with k(a)-…-ti has a reflexive meaning with coreference of agent and theme (as in (8.34a)). But is also has a reciprocal meaning with agent and recipient participants (as in (8.34b)):
(8.34) a. [I-keCS iyakwa creyenteCC=tibu] Yusu=keja i-keS 1SG-FM now believer=REASON God=LOC.GNL 1SG-FM

MAN REF-give-REF-MAN=NEG=FOC be-IMPFV

‘We (Cavineñas) don’t give presents to each other that way (bending forward) (as the Pacahuaras do).’ pa093

These (although very limited) examples show that none of the two Os of ditransitive verbs appear to be priviledged within a reflexive derivation. Examples (8.33) and (8.34b) also show that the O that is not in a reflexive or reciprocal relation with the agent is not expressed. However, in (8.34a) the recipient (‘God’; i.e., the O that is not in a reflexive relation with the agent) is expressed (by an oblique general locative phrase). This example could contradict the general statement that both Os of ditransitive verbs are left unexpressed within all types of valency reducing mechanisms (see §8.1 and §8.3). However, it is quite possible that this is an idiosyncratic result of the fact that ‘giving oneself to God’ (in the sense it has nowadays in Cavineña communities) is a recent idea introduced by missionaries. Note that a similar phenomenon occurs with baka-baka- ‘pray’ (an antipassive derivation of ditransitive baka- ‘ask’; see §8.3 and (8.45)).
There are a number of idiosyncratic meanings associated with the reflexive circumfix, as well as a number of synchronically unrecoverable bases.
In (8.35) below, we provide some examples with lexicalised reflexive morphology (a-examples are presumably underlyingly reflexive semantically, b-examples reciprocal and c-examples patientless):

281

(8.35) a. kadakati- ‘vomit’ <

kadujuti- ‘go’

<

kabeti- ‘come’ <

b. kakemiti- ‘marry’ <

c. kajiruti- ‘choke’ <

dakadujubekemijiru-

‘spill O’ ‘take O’ ‘bring O’ ‘take O’ ‘sniff O’

Finally, a number of verbs show reflexive morphology even though the base is

synchronically unidentifiable (or only partially identifiable). As an illustration, we list a few of these verbs in (8.36):12

(8.36) kawaiti- ‘get angry’

kajikati-

‘tangle up’

kueti-

‘pass’

katibuti-

‘start E’

kakaditi- ‘coagulate’

kadeneti-

‘transform into E’

kadyati- ‘have an accident’

The historical origin of the reflexive circumfix k(a)-…-ti is quite unclear. One could speculate that the -ti part of the circumfix is related to the motion Aktionsart suffix -ti ‘GO.TEMP’ (see §7.2). Synchronically, however, these are clearly distinct morphemes as shown by the fact that they can co-occur in a single verb (see for example (8.30)). As for the ka- part, it does not have any equivalent in modern day Cavineña. We can only note that ka is a recurent morpheme in many non-genetically-related South American languages where it often has a valencychanging function (Payne 1990: 79-80), suggesting that it might have evolved under influence from a neighbouring language. Historical work is however required to clarify this issue.

8.3. Antipassive derivations There are two antipassive mechanisms in Cavineña. The first one only applies to inflecting verbs and is achieved by full reduplication (§8.3.1). The second one only applies to non-inflecting verbs and is achieved by exchanging the transitive auxiliary with the intransitive auxiliary (§8.3.2).
12 Note that the circumfix k(a)-…-ti is also found with about 20 noun bases (e.g., ka-kaka-ti- ‘give fruit’ from the enoun -kaka ‘fruit’), all intransitive. In this case, we analyse it as a verbaliser morpheme (see §5.2.2).

282

8.3.1. Full reduplication
Full reduplication of an inflecting transitive (or ditransitive) verb root derives an inflecting verb which is intransitive (recall that rull reduplication of a verb has additional functions; see §5.5). Syntactically, the reassignment of grammatical functions has an antipassive effect. The underlying A argument referent becomes the S of the derived verb and the underlying O argument referent is left unexpressed. Semantically, the reduplicated verb denotes a culturally identified activity (an activity that people or animals regularly repeat the same way) as opposed to denoting a particular event performed over a particular O when underived. Unlike reduplicated deverbal complements, there is no sense of reiteration of the verb event.

The antipassive syntax of verb fully reduplicated verbs is illustrated with the verbs ara‘eat’ and taru- ‘stir’, with elicited pairs of examples in (8.37) and (8.38) below (aexamples are non-reduplicated and transitive while b-examples are reduplicated and intransitive):

Note that iji- ‘drink’ is used twice in (8.39a), once reduplicated (with one single S argument) and once non-reduplicated (with two A and O arguments).

The reduplicated verb peta- ‘look at’ in (8.40) below was uttered to the author one day while he was watching food distribution.

< eri< suck< taka< uwa< baju-

‘grind O’ ‘suck O’ ‘peal O’ ‘plant O’ ‘toast O’

One might want to ask what happens with ditransitive verbs (baka- ‘ask O for O’, kweja- ‘inform O of O’, seka- ‘steal O from O’ and tya- ‘give O to O’). Can one of the two O arguments be expressed by any means? We do not have any conclusive answer at the present stage, mostly because the appropriate examples are missing.

An example of ditransitive kweja- ‘inform’ as a reduplicated inflecting verb was volunteered by Francisco Vaca, as in (8.43):

(8.43)

Kweja-kweja-ya =tu

ekwitaS radio=eke.

inform-REDUP-IMPFV =3SG(-FM) person radio=PERL

‘A man is giving news on the radio.’ n3.0282

From this example, it appears that both O are left unspecified and unexpressed.

The intransitive verb tya-u-tya-u ‘hand palm leaves to someone while making the roof of a house’ (from tya- ‘give’) was given to me by Alfredo Tavo as (8.44):

(8.44)

Tya-u-tya-u-ya. give-PROP-REDUP-REDUP-IMPFV
‘He is handing palm leaves (as they are making the roof of the house).’ n5.0343

(Note that a reduplicated form makes two different phonological words (see §3.2.2). As a result, when a mono-morphemic root is reduplicated — as with tya- (see also ba- ‘see’

285 in (8.46) — a vowel u ‘PROP’ is added to both reduplicated parts.)

Alfredo Tavo could not find any way to express either the thing handed (palm leaves) or the recipient, confirming that with ditransitive verbs, both Os are left unspecified and unexpressed (as it would be with regular transitive verbs).

But with baka-baka- ‘pray’ (from baka- ‘ask O for O’) — found in many examples — one of the underlying O (‘God’) is found expressed by an oblique (general locative) phrase. Example (8.45) shows the non-derived form (in a.) and the derived (i.e. reduplicated) form of baka- ‘ask’:

(8.45) a. … =tu-keO =ØA

‘… so I prayed (lit. asked) god…’ es050
It is possible that baka- exhibits idiosyncratic behavior. (Note that the concept of ‘praying’ as it is nowdays understood in Cavineña communities, as well as the term Señor ‘god, lord’, were introduced by Missionaries and are not traditional. This might have influenced the fact that ‘God’ is mentioned together with baka-baka- ‘pray’.)
(The last ditransitive verb seka- ‘steal O from O’ has not been found taking part in the process of antipassive reduplication.)
The underlying O referent cannot be expressed but it is still understood as part of the semantics of the event. The events of ‘eating’, ‘stirring’, ‘drinking’, ‘waiting’, etc., illustrated in their reduplicated form above, still imply that they are performed over some O referent. But the identity of this referent is unimportant since they encode activities and can apply to any O referent that is semantically plausible. This type of

286 antipassive would correspond to what has sometimes been called patientless antipassive in the literature (see for example Dixon and Aikhenvald’s 2000b terms).

The function of antipassive reduplication, similarly to other valency modifying devices in Cavineña (such as passive; see §8.1), is essentially semantic in nature, that is, it focuses on the activity as opposed to the effect of the activity over the patient. There is also a syntactic rearrangement of the argument structure (i.e. from an A/O frame to an S frame). But the antipassive reduplication does not have the other additional functions often found in languages with an antipassive, such as agent focusing or agent topicalising (associated with pivot feeding). The Cavineña antipassive reduplication does not particularly focus on the A referent since there is no identifiable O referent to contrast it with.

One consequence of the strong semantic nature of the Cavineña antipassive is that it cannot apply to all types of verb. For example, the antipassive derivation cannot apply to kwere- ‘cut O (e.g., tree) down’, be- ‘bring’, rikwa- ‘bark at O’ and chiri- ‘steal’ (*chiri-chiri-).13 (Note that a systematic investigation of which verbs can undergo the antipassive reduplication remains to be done.) Another consequence of the strong semantic nature of the antipassive reduplication is that the derived form can have very specific meanings, not always fully predictable from the original root. This was the case with taru-taru- ‘row’, in (8.38b) (from taru- ‘stir O’), and susu-susu- ‘suck milk’ in (8.42) (from susu- ‘suck O’). Another very unusual meaning obtains with reduplication of ba- ‘see’, where bau-bau- refers to hens in the activity of searching for a place to lay their eggs. Example (8.46) was volunteered by Alfredo Tavo:

(8.46)

TakureS =tuS

ba-u-ba-u-ya.

chicken =3SG(-FM) ba-PROP-REDUP-REDUP-IMPFV

‘The hen is looking for a place to lay her eggs.’ n5.0342

8.3.2. Exchanging auxiliaries Antipassive derivation for transitive non-inflecting verbs is achieved by exchanging the transitive auxiliary (a- ‘affect’) with the intransitive one (ju- ‘be’). Unlike in full
13 Note that these verbs can be reduplicated as long as they become non-inflecting verbs. This is however a quite distinct process (see §10.6).

287 reduplication antipassive, the underlying O can be (although not obligatorily) overtly expressed. Typically, the O becomes incorporated within the non-inflecting verb (e.g. (8.50b) and (8.51a)), In at least one example, (8.48b), the O is not incorporated but expressed as an oblique (associated) phrase. In many cases, however, the O is simply left unexpressed (e.g., (8.47b), (8.49b) and (8.51b)).

It is likely that the antipassive derivation through the exchange of auxiliaries is involved in the phenomenon of object ‘incorporation’ that accompanies the Ø-derivation of noninflecting intransitive verbs from transitive inflecting verbs (see §10.5), as in examples such as (8.52):

(8.52) a. E-raA earakiO 1SG-ERG food

duju-kware take-REM.PAST

b. I-keS [earaki 1SG-FM food

duju] take

ju-kware be(ANTIPASS)-REM.PAST

Both: ‘I took food.’ n2.0417-0418

In §10.5, we provide a full discussion of the intransitive status of clauses such as (8.52b) as well as the ‘incorporated’ status of O. We also suggest that clauses such as (8.52b) are derived from clauses such as (8.52a) through a two-step process. A transitive inflecting verb (such as duju- ‘take O’ in (8.52a), is first turned into a transitive non-inflecting verb (i.e. duju a- ‘take O’) and secondly turned into an intransitive non-inflecting verb by exchanging the auxiliary (i.e. by the antipassive derivation) (giving earaki duju ju- ‘take-O’ in (8.52b)). Note that the postulated intermediate forms (duju a- ‘take O’ in the case of (8.52)) never occur. (See §10.5 for a full discussion and examples form texts.)

In (at least) one case the combination of the (posited) process of Ø-derivation followed by antipassive auxiliary alternation has resulted in a lexicalised non-inflecting verb. This is found with wikamutya ju- ‘fish (with line and hook)’ (as opposed to ‘fish with arrows’). This verb quite transparently comes from wika ‘hook’ and the transitive verb mutya- ‘dip O’. It is likely that mutya- ‘dip (any) O’ was first Ø-derived into mutya a‘dip (any) O’ and then detransitivised by auxiliary alternation together with wika ‘hook’

290 as its underlying O giving wika mutya- ju- ‘dip hook’. Finally, this complex (noninflecting) verb has become lexicalised as wikamutya ju- ‘fish (*‘dip hook’).

8.4. Causative derivations A causative derivation increases the valency of the verb by adding an agentive argument (causer) in A function.
Cavineña is very interesting in having three causative markers.14 These markers are verbal suffixes (there are no analytic causatives in Cavineña).

The differences between the three causative markers can be fruitfully compared to Dixon’s (2000) framework of analysis of causative mechanisms. As Dixon states, causative constructions in the languages of the world are characterised by nine semantic parameters. The nine parameters are reproduced in Table 8.3:

Table 8.3: Semantic parameters of causatives (from Dixon (2000: 62))

Relating to the verb Relating to the causee Relating to the causer

1. Stative vs. active 2. Intransitive vs. transitive vs. ditransitive 3. Having vs. lacking control 4. Acting willingly vs. unwillingly 5. Partially vs. completely affected 6. Acting directly vs. indirectly 7. Acting accidentally vs. intentionally 8. Acting naturally vs. with effort 9. Involved vs. not involved in the activity

The first two Cavineña causative markers differ along parameter (2). The marker -sha only applies to intransitive verbs while the marker -mere only applies to transitive verbs.

The third causative marker, -kere, differs from the previous two according to parameter (9). It encodes the fact that the causer is involved in the activity whereas there is no involvement (of the causer) with the markers -sha and -mere.

14 Recall that a fourth causativiser (of intransitive verbs) is an a ending found in a handfull of transitive verbs. Howerver, as we said — see footnote 1 —, this causativiser is not productive enough to be further discussed here.

291 We discuss each causative marker in turn below.

8.4.1. Causativiser of intransitive verbs -sha
The suffix -sha is used to causativise intransitive verbs, turning them into transitive ones. Its syntax is straightforward (unlike the causativiser of transitive verbs -mere, see §8.4.2 below). It introduces a new agent (causer) in A function and puts the underlying S argument (causee) into O function.

We illustrate the syntax of the causativiser -sha with the elicited pair of examples in (8.53):

(8.53) a. EbakwaS =tuS

pakaka-kware

child =3SG(-FM) fall-REM.PAST

‘The child fell.’

b. Ekwita=raA =tuO

ebakwaO pakaka-sha-kware

homme=ERG =3SG(-FM) child

fall-CAUS-REC.PAST

‘The man made the child fall.’

The range of meanings of -sha is very broad. It can be used to cover most parameters outlined in Dixon’s (2000) typology of causatives parameter, except parameter (9) of involvement (this becomes the domain of the causative marker -kere, see below). We discuss a few parameters below with examples drawn from texts.

The causee can be either non-controlling (as in (8.54)) or controlling (as in (8.55)) (this is parameter (3)):

‘After that, the (Cavineña) chief told them (Cavineña people) to get ready (lit. made them prepare themselves) (in order to take revenge on the enemies).’ vz069

As for the causer, it can act directly as in (8.54) (the causee is inanimate and not controlling so that the causativised verb requires direct action from the causer to be

294 performed), or indirectly as in (8.55) (the change of state events are controlled by the causee and result of the absence of appropriate intervention of the causer). (This is parameter (6).) Interestingly, as we will see in the following section, directness of causation has a number of effects on the causativisation of transitive verbs.

The causer can act naturally as in (8.57b) (the causees are eager to take revenge on the enemies so their chief does not have to force them to get ready), or with a particular effort as in (8.56b) (children don’t like to bathe so early so that their parents have to force them to do so).

Finally, causative -sha can derive both active verbs (as in all examples above) and stative verbs (as in (8.58)) (this is parameter (1)):

(8.58)

E-raA =tuO

‘I will retain him (lit. make him sit) some more time.’ n3.0092

Causativisation of intransitive verbs shows a number of irregularities. Intransitive monosyllabic verbs are all irregular when causativised. Of the five verbs kwa- ‘go’, tsa‘laugh’, pa- ‘cry’, je- ‘come’ and copula/auxiliary verb ju- ‘be’, only the causativised form of kwa- ‘go’, namely kwadisha-, appears to be related to -sha (but, as we can see, it also includes an additional formative di, for which we do not have any idea of the origin).
The verbs tsa- ‘laugh’ and pa- ‘cry’ are causativised differently, as follows: (8.59) tsa-tura- ‘make laugh’ (*tsa-sha-)
peya- ‘make cry’ (*pa-sha-)
The formative tura in tsa-tura- is homophonous with the verbaliser -tura that turns adjectives into transitive verbs (§5.2.3). As for peya-, this verb appears to consist of the verb pa- ‘cry’ and an old causative suffix -a which is no longer productive (see discussion of this formative in §5.2.6).
The verb je- ‘come’ does not have any clear causativised equivalent (be- ‘bring’ would be the closest candidate).

295

The copula/intransitive auxiliary verb ju- ‘be’, in its meaning ‘exist, be located’, does not have any clear causativised equivalent either (closest candidates would be verbs such as iya- ‘put’, isha- ‘put in’, shana- ‘leave’, etc.). In its copula/auxiliary function, however, ju- ‘be’ has a suppletive causativised form amere- ‘be+CAUS’ (*ju-sha-). (It will be seen that there is also a very similar suppletive form, akere- ‘be+CAUS.INVLT’ corresponding to the copula/intransitive auxiliary causativised by -kere ‘CAUS.INVLT’; see §8.4.3).)

A number of examples showing the suppletive form amere- are provided in (8.60):

(8.60) a. Diru-ya=keA kasa-daCC [e-kwe e-niju]O go-IMPFV=LIG strong-ASF 1SG-GEN NPF-heart

avionetaO aterisa amere-ya.

pilot =ERG =3SG(-FM) light.plane land

be+CAUS-IMPFV

‘The pilot is making the light plane land.’ n5.0375

The suppletive causativised form of the copula/intransitive auxiliary is a very interesting morpheme. This morpheme first appears to be made of the combination of the transitive auxiliary a- ‘affect’ and the causativiser of transitive verbs -mere (see §8.4.2), as if the copula/intransitive auxiliary ju- ‘be’ was first exchanged with the transitive auxiliary a-

296 ‘affect’, and secondarily marked by the transitive causativiser -mere ‘CAUS’. Note that this is reminiscent of the auxiliary alternation found in the antipassive derivation of transitive non-inflecting verbs (§8.3.2). Alternatively, the a part of amere- could be related to the old causative suffix -a found as a formative ending in a few (mostly) transitive verbs (§5.2.6). (Note that the suppletive form of the copula/intransitive auxiliary akere- ‘be+CAUS.INVLT’ — see §8.4.3 — is most likely to have had the same origin whatever it be.)

In a few cases, the suffix -sha acts as a causativiser with other word classes, always deriving transitive verbs.

In the five forms in (8.61) below, it applies to adjectives:

(8.61) nijuki-sha- ‘make O drunk’

<

nijuki ‘drunk’

jie-sha- ‘make O better’

<

ji-

‘good’

kuji-sha- ‘confond O’

<

kuji ‘lost’

temu-sha- ‘raise O, breed O’

<

temu- ‘stiff’

weka-sha- ‘make O remember’ <

weka- ‘bright’

We also have verbs derived with -sha from two e-nouns: kwatsa-sha- ‘order O, send O’ (from -kwatsa ‘mouth’) and bakani-sha- ‘name O’ (from -bakani ‘name’).

In the following four words, the bases, although not identified as independent words on

their own, are nevertheless found together with the passive -tana, as in (8.19)

(repeated):

(8.19) jeku-sha- ‘scare O’

jeku-tana- ‘be scared’

rikwi-sha- ‘make O jump’

rikwi-tana- ‘start, shiver’

puti-sha- ‘make O jump’

puti-tana- ‘start, jump’

ruju-sha- ‘go through O’

ruju-tana- ‘get on a path’

For the remaining forms in (8.62) below, it is not possible to state whether the formative sha is indeed the causative marker or not, as the bases are not found in any other contexts.

297 (8.62) bushu(/i)sha- ‘wake O up’ kwasha- ‘chip O’16

dusha-

‘dilute O’ pakasha- ‘open O’

ishusha-

‘help O’

tasha-

‘burst O’

itusha-

‘push O’

urisha- ‘soften O’

kisha-

‘open O’

The origin of the causativiser -sha is possibly the verb isha- ‘put in’ as in (8.63):

(8.63)

Tudya i-keO [e-kwe tata-chi=ra]A

escuela=ju isha-kware…

then 1SG-FM 1SG-GEN father-AFFTN=ERG school=LOC put.in-REM.PAST

‘So my father put me in the school… ‘ mg003

8.4.2. Causativiser of transitive verbs -mere The suffix -mere causativises transitive verbs. It introduces an agent (causer) in A function. The underlying O argument (patient) stays in O function. As for the underlying A (causee), there are two options, depending on semantic factors that have to do with the degree of integration of the event of causation (i.e. event of causer ordering causee) and the verb event (i.e. causee performing verb event).
In direct causation, the causee becomes an additional core O argument (unmarked), in which case this yields a ditransitive verb. In indirect causation, the causee becomes an optional general locative oblique and the verb remains transitive (it does not become ditransitive).
Note that -mere is a fully productive suffix which can occur on potentially any transitive verb. This is unlike many languages where causativisation is only available for intransitive verbs or available for only a few transitive verbs (sometimes only for the two verbs ‘eat’ and ‘drink’) (Dixon 2000: 43 and p.c.).
The syntax of direct versus indirect causation is illustrated with elicited pairs of
16 Possibly this form could be derived from kwa- ‘go’, although the relation between ‘make go’ and ‘chip’ is a bit far fetched.

298 examples in (8.64) and (8.65) (the b-examples are causativised versions of the a-examples; the suffix -mere and the causee argument are in bold face):

(See also (8.71b) below.)
The two options basically correlate with Dixon’s (2000) parameter (6) of directness (see Table 8.3 above). Textual examples of direct and indirect causation are provided in (8.66) and (8.67) respectively:

299 (8.66) Direct causation

In the preceding examples, the causee is overtly expressed. But in many case, there is no overt causee. In this situation, we do not have any overt clue as to decide whether we have direct or indirect causation, but only contextual ones. In the following we illustrate a number of such examples.

Example (8.68) shows semantically direct causation. We have a specific/referential causee and events closely linked together (the causer causes the causee ‘to throw’ by the physical contact of hitting):

(8.68)

[Eskupeta kuchiru jadya]O =tuO

mapisi=raA

shotgun machete and

throw.away-CAUS-REM.PAST NPF-water=LOC

‘(Hitting the man,) the anaconda snake made him drop (lit. throw away) his shotgun and machete in the water.’ si005

In example (8.69) we have semantic indirect causation. In this, the causee is nonspecific (we do not know who did the ‘calling’) and the events are largely independent one from the other:

(8.69)

Amena [e-kwe mama-chi=ra]A i-keO iwara-mere-nuka-kware. FILL 1SG-GEN mother-AFFTN=ERG 1SG-FM call-CAUS-REITR-REM.PAST
‘Then my mum made me call once again.’ nk041

Example (8.70) (this is (T1.116)), however, is ambiguous between the two readings. We have a specific/referential causee which would suggest indirect causation. But the two events appear tightly knit together (the causer performs the verb event under direct fear of the causee), which would suggest direct causation.

From these semantic and contextual intepretations, we would expect the causee in (8.68) to be marked as a core O argument, and in (8.69) as a general locative oblique argument. As for (8.70), both types of marking appear possible.

Causativised transitive non-inflecting verbs are shown in (8.71). Note that in (8.71a) the verb katsa- ‘beat O’ first undergoes the auxiliary-taking process of distributive full reduplication — giving katsa-katsa a- ‘beat O repeatedly’ — and only secondarily takes the causative marker — resulting in katsa-katsa a-mere- ‘make O beat O repeatedly’.

We have very few examples of causativised ditransitive verbs. In none of the examples available is there a third O (i.e. the causee) overtly expressed. It is possible (although not attested) that the causee can be expressed by an oblique argument, as is the case with the indirect causation of transitive verbs (e.g., (8.65b) and (8.67a,b)). In (8.72), for example, only the two Os (=metse ‘you (dl) and cuatro kuchara mateka ‘four spoons of butter’) are overtly expressed:

(8.72)

[E-kwe e-bakujunaO [ara-kara ju-ya]

spoon butter

‘Because my daughter is hungry, I am having you (dl) asked for four spoons of butter (i.e., I asked someone to ask you four spoons of butter).’ di1932

Unlike the preceding valency changing morphemes (passive -ta(na), reflexive k(a)-…-ti and intransitive causative -sha) the transitive causative suffix -mere is highly regular, highly productive, and shows very few idiosyncrasies. It is only found on (transitive) verbs (whereas, as we saw, -tana, k(a)-…-ti and -sha are also found with a variety of non-verbal word classes). The base on which -mere applies to is always recoverable (i.e. it is always a synchronically independent transitive verb).

The only irregularity observed in the data is an unusual semantic effect of the suffix on one verb, kuje- ‘to cheer on (e.g. a dog when hunting)’ which becomes kuje+mere‘make chase’ (as opposed to ‘make cheer on’ if the derivation had a causative meaning), as illustrated with the pair of examples in (8.73):

(8.73) a. Amena tuekedya e-raA

kuje-kware.

303 ‘So, let’s (dl) make the dog chase the jaguar!’ tg029
As we can see, the original A stays as the A argument, the original O (the dog) goes to the periphery (marked with the general locative postposition =keja), and a new O is introduced (jaguar). The reassignment of the semantic roles is reminiscent of applicative derivations, except that the semantic nature of the underlying O remains quite unclear. Now, we should note that the verb kuje- is itself a rather strange verb in Cavineña. First, it is not a native verb but a borrowing from Spanish (from transitive verb coger ‘catch’). Also, it is the only borrowed verb that is attested to take verbal morphology (borrowings are normally treated as nouns in Cavineña, regardless of their word class in the source language). The strange status of kuje-, therefore, might well explain the ‘funny’ effect of the causative.

The historical origin of the causativiser of transitive verbs -mere appears to be the transitive verb mere-, meaning ‘serve O, work for O’, as illustrated in (8.74):

(8.74)

IjetiO =pa =tu-ja =tuO

8.4.3. Causative of involvement -kere
The causative marker -kere ‘CAUSative of INVoLVmenT’ applies to both intransitive and transitive verbs. It is the most interesting of the three causative markers in Cavineña because of its very unusual semantics of involvement of the causer (corresponding to Dixon’s 2000 parameter (9); see Table 8.3 above).

Syntactically, an intransitive verb becomes transitive. As with the causative marker -sha, the original S becomes the new O of the derived verb. This is illustrated with the pair of (elicited) examples in (8.75):

(8.75) a. E-bakwaS tawi-ya.

1-child

sleep-IMPFV

‘My child (will) sleep(s).’ iv

1SG-ERG 1SG-GEN 1-child

sleep-CAUS.INVLT-IMPFV

‘I (will) make my child sleep with me.’ n3.0343

A transitive verb becomes ditransitive. The original A becomes a second O of the derived ditransitive verb. Unlike with the causative marker -mere, this is the only option available (i.e. the original O cannot be marked as an oblique.) This is illustrated with the pair of (elicited) examples in (8.76):

(8.76) a. [Don Francisco=ra]A =tuO

ara-chine tortaO.

Mr. Francisco=ERG =3SG(-FM) eat-REC.PAST cake

‘ Mr. Francisco ate a cake.’

b. E-raA =tuO

ara-kere-chine

1SG-ERG =3SG(-FM) eat-CAUS.INVLT-REC.PAST cake Mr. Francisco

‘I invited Mr. Francisco to eat a cake with me.’ n3.0337

Ditransitive verbs with -kere presumably remain ditransitive (as happens with -mere in (8.72)) but we unfortunately have no examples to confirm it.
The crucial distinction between the causative marker -kere and the other two causatives is the fact that with -kere, in addition to ‘causing’ the ‘causee’ to perform the action, the causer participates himself in the action in some way.
In example (8.75b), the ‘child’ is caused to ‘sleep’ by a causer who also ‘sleeps’. This sentence can be used when there is only one mosquito net (in trip situations for example) and a child who normally sleeps in his own mosquito net is requested to sleep under the same mosquito net as his parents. (Note that nobody sleep without a mosquito net in Cavineña territory due to the incredible number of mosquitoes.)
In example (8.76b), ‘Don Francisco’ is invited to ‘eat’ by a causer who will also eat.
A very similar example is in (8.77a) below. One morning, when my consultant

305 Emerenciano Sepa arrived at my house for a working session, I was still finishing my breakfast. There was still some coffee left so I offered him a cup while he waited for me to get ready. The following day, he told me that he could say (8.77a) to his friends. (Note that because of its very high cost, Cavineña people rarely drink coffee.)

(8.77) a. [Hermano Antonio=ra]A =ØO

iji-kere-chine

brother Antonio=ERG (=1SG-FM) drink-CAUS.INVMT-REC.PAST

kapeO. coffee
‘(Yesterday) Brother Antonio shared coffee with me.’ n5.00003

Then he explained that if I had not drunk coffee myself, he would have to say (8.77b) instead — using the causativiser -mere:

(8.77) b. [Hermano Antonio=ra]A =ØO brother Antonio=ERG (=1SG-FM)

iji-mere-chine

kapeO.

drink-CAUS-REC.PAST coffee

‘(Yesterday) Brother Antonio offered me (a cup of) coffee.’ n5.00003

In (8.78) (volunteered example by Emerenciano Sepa), the A argument referent again does a favor by showing a nice bathing place (i.e. a place with clean and fresh water) to the O argument referent:

(8.78)

Nawi-kere-chine

=tu-raA =i-keO,

bathe-CAUS.INVLT-REC.PAST =3SG-ERG =1SG-FM

[espere ji-da=pijiCC=ju]. NPF.stream good-ASF=DIM(=LIG)=LOC ‘He showed me a beautiful creek and we two bathed there.’ n5.00013

This situation is notably different from the situation depicted by nawi-sha- in (8.56b) (i.e. with the causativiser of intransitive verbs). With nawi-sha-, the ‘children’ are forced to bathe and there is no implication that their parents bathe too.

We further illustrate -kere with text examples in (8.79) (with intransitive verbs) and (8.80) (with transitive verbs):

306

The suffix -kere is fully productive and — except with one verb — fully regular. The exception is the copula/auxiliary ju- ‘be’ which becomes suppletive akere- when causativised (not otherwise expected *ju-kere-). (Note that this is parallel to the causativisation of ju- by the causativiser of intransitive verbs -sha which yields amere(not *ju-sha-); see §8.4.1 above.)

This is illustrated with two volunteered examples (by Emerenciano Sepa) in (8.81) (causativised forms of wikamutya ju- ‘to fish’ and babi ju- ‘to hunt’) and a text example in (8.82) (causativised form of warere-warere ju- ‘to turn over and over again’):

The Cavineña marker -kere appears to be quite unusual typologically. Only a few

308 languages have been described as having a causative marker with similar semantics and, to my knowledge, these languages are all South American. It has been reported in the Peruvian Pre-Andine Arawak languages Nomatsiguenga, Amuesha, Piro (Wise 1986: 593-594) and Asheninca (Payne 2001), as well as in the Bolivian Arawak language Trinitario (Gill, ms., reported by Wise 1989: 294). It has also been reported in the Brazilian Tupí-Guaraní language Kamaiurá (Seki 2000: 290-291) and the Equatorian Barbacoan language Awa Pit (Timothy Curnow, p.c.).

The origin of -kere might be the transitive verb kere- ‘tie’, as illustrated in the elicited example (8.83):

(8.83)

E-puna=raA =tu

kere-ya [tu-ja kwati]O.

NPF-woman=ERG =3SG(-FM) tie-IMPFV 3SG-GEN firewood

8.5. Distribution Valency-modifying affixes occupy slot C/G of the predicate. Combinations between two valency-modifying processes are rare but possible (at least in some cases). This is summarised in Table 8.4.
There are a number of combinations which never occur (these are shown by shaded cells in the table): — the same suffix process (such as reduplication or auxiliary alternation) never occurs twice. — antipassive reduplication never reduplicates suffixes so that ANTIPASS1 never cooccurs with any processes.
A number of combinations which are not attested in the data but could logically be possible are marked with question marks in the table.
Attested combinations are cross-referencd to illustrative examples given earlier in this chapter, and supplemented by additional examples below the table.

In (8.84) we have the combination of the causative suffix -sha (on an intransitive verb, in a.) and -mere (on a transitive verb, in b.) combining with the reflexive circumfix k(a)-…-ti (with benefactive sense in a. and reflexive sense in b.).

‘… the weather cleared up (lit. the weather that had deteriorated got better) and the sun was visible (again) (lit. made itself visible).’ se019a

Note that co-occurring valency-changing affixes are strictly ordered according to their scope. In (8.84a), the -ti part of the reflexive circumfix can only be applied once -sha ‘CAUS’ has first been applied to the verb root because it requires a transitive stem. As a result, -ti follows -sha. In (8.84b), -mere can only be applied before the reflexive circumfix is applied because it requires a transitive stem and because the reflexive

310 circumfix derives an intransitive verb.

In (8.85), the non-inflecting verb kwatsabiji a- ‘tell story to O’ — see an example in (8.48a) — has first undergone an antipassive derivation by exchanging the transitive auxiliary a- ‘affect’ for ju- ‘be’ (see §8.3.2)) giving kwatsabiji ju- ‘talk’ — see an example in (8.48b). Then, kwatsabiji ju- has been retransitivised with the causative of involvement (suppletive form akere-; see §8.4.3).

akere-kwe…! be+CAUS.INVLT-IMP.SG
‘Let’s see, (Sister Teresa,) could you tell us (about the old traditions) and discuss it with us?’ ci029

Note that one could interpret kwatsabiji akere- as a causativisation of kwatsabiji a- (i.e. without first going through an antipassive derivation). If this was the case, however, we would have a ditransitive verb (not the transitive verb that we have here) meaning ‘could you make someone tell us and …’.

Valency-changing affixes do also co-occur with affixes from other slots.

Combinations of valency-changing processes co-occurring with postural/directional suffixes are not very common — no examples have been found of postural/directional suffixes co-occurring with passive -ta(na) or causative of involvement -kere — but this is likely to be the result of the fact that postural/directional suffixes are restricted to occurring with only a limited number of verb roots. Examples of such combinations are at (8.86):

9 Predicate structure — postural and directional suffixes
Postural and directional suffixes form a paradigm of seven members that are mutually exclusive. They occur in slot (F) of the predicate structure (see §5.1).
Four members code postural notions: -ani ‘SIT’ (§9.1.1), -neti/-nitya ‘STAND’ (§9.1.2), -jara ‘LIE’ (§9.1.3) and -bade ‘HANG’ (§9.1.4). Postural suffixes are S/Aoriented, in that they specify the posture of the S or the A (not the O) argument (but see as possible exception at (9.5b)).
The remaining three members of the paradigm code directional notions: -tsura ‘GO.UP’ (§9.2.1), -bute/-butya ‘GO.DOWN’ (§9.2.2) and -sikwa ‘GO.AWAY’ (§9.2.3). These suffixes are mostly found on (independent) posture verbs. Their role is essentially to specify the direction (‘up’ vs. ‘down’ vs. ‘away’) that accompanies a change in posture. Directionals are S/O-oriented, in that the direction specification is about the S or the O (not the A) argument.
Two members of the postural/directional paradigm are sensitive to the transitivity of the verb they attach to: -neti/-nitya ‘STAND’ (-neti on intransitive verbs, -nitya on transitive verbs) and -bute/-butya ‘GO.DOWN’ (-bute on intransitive verbs, -butya on transitive verbs).
Six (out of seven) suffixes of postural/directional paradigm have a corresponding verb, to which they are without much doubt historically related.
9.1. Postural suffixes Postural suffixes consist of four members which encode body posture. They are given in Table 9.1:

314
Table 9.1: Postural suffixes

-jara -ani -neti/-nitya -bade

‘LIE’ ‘SIT’ ‘STAND’ ‘HANG’

Postural suffixes — with one possible exception; see (9.5b) — are S/A-oriented. In other words, they code the posture of the S/A argument of the clause (unlike directionals which are S/O-oriented).

Postural suffixes are most often found with the copula/auxiliary verb ju- ‘be’. Occasionally, however, they are attested with other types of verbs.

9.1.1. -ani ‘SIT’ The suffix -ani ‘SIT’ codes the fact that a core participant of the event is in a sitting posture.

Example (9.1) shows -ani occurring on intransitive verbs:

(9.1)

a. Ai =miS

Examples in (9.2) show -ani on transitive verbs:

taka-ani-ya=ju]. peel-SIT-IMPFV=DS

‘I saw him (Leonardo) skin it (the puma he had killed).’ el023

In the data, -ani ‘SIT’ is also found on ara- ‘eat’ (ara-ani- ‘eat sitting’) and iwa‘wait for’ (iwa-ani- ‘wait for O sitting’).

Note that on all available examples of -ani on transitive verbs, it codes the posture of the A (not the O) argument: ‘he’ (not ‘conversation’) in (9.2a) and ‘he’ (not ‘puma’) in (9.2b).

The suffix -ani ‘SIT’ has a corresponding intransitive verb ani- ‘sit’, shown in (9.3) (this verb can also mean ‘be (in possessive clauses), live (somewhere) as in (9.21) below‘):

The suffix -ani ‘SIT’ (or the equivalent verb) is probably historically related to the the ani formative found in isaani- ‘sit on top of O’ ( the isa part of the verb is not found anywhere else in the language).

316 9.1.2. -neti/-nitya ‘STAND’
The suffix -neti/-nitya ‘STAND’ codes the fact that a core participant of the event is in a standing posture. The form -neti is used with intransitive verbs while the form -nitya is used with transitive verbs.

The suffix -neti is illustrated with intransitive verbs in (9.4).

‘He stopped (lit. stood) to look at the agouti (that was beeing dragged by a snake).’ se002a

1 In this example, the transitive verb root ara- ‘eat O’ undergoes antipassive reduplication (§8.3.1). This process derives an intransitive verb stem.

umada.

=3PL(-ERG) gather-STAND-IMPFV many

‘(They cut a lot of barbasco plants and) put them together vertically (lit. standing).’ bb007

In (9.5a), -nitya codes the (standing) posture of the A argument (‘he’, not ‘agouti’). This is clear from the translation (given by Alfredo Tavo of his own story). This is also clear from the fact that ‘the agouti’ is unlikely to be standing while trying to escape the snake that is trying to eat him. But in (9.5b), on the other hand, -nitya appears to code the posture of the O argument (‘barbasco plants’, not ‘they’ in (9.5b)). This could contradict the statement made earlier that postural suffixes are strictly S/Aoriented — postural suffixes could allow for both S/A- and S/O-orientations. Conversely, rada-nitya- found in (9.5b) is perhaps a lexicalised form in which case its exceptional status would not contradict the statement. More work is required to reach a more conclusive statement.

Both (intransitive and transitive) forms of the suffix -neti/-nitya have corresponding verbs: intransitive neti- ‘stand (also meaning ‘stop (itr.)’) shown in (9.6a) and the transitive nitya- ‘make stand (also meaning ‘stop (tr.)’) shown in (9.6b):

The verbs neti- and nitya- (from which the suffixes -neti and -nitya are without much doubt historically related) are formally related. The transitive verb nitya- is a causativised version of neti- via a(n old causative) suffix -a. This suffix is no longer

318 productive. It is only found in a handfull of verbs (see §5.2.6). (The suffix -a also accounts for the -bute/-butya ‘GO.DOWN’ pair of positional suffixes and historically related verbs bute- ‘go down’ and butya ‘lower’; see §9.2.2 below).

9.1.3. -jara ‘LIE’ The suffix -jara indicates that a core participant of the event is in a lying posture.

Examples in (9.7) show -jara on intransitive verbs.

(9.7)

‘(When I said to my friends that I had killed a cayman, they asked me: but) where is it? (So I replied:) over there, it is lying. lg021

The suffix -jara occurs twice in (9.8), each time within a DS-temporal adverbial clause (§19.2). In the first DS-temporal adverbial clause, it attaches to ju- ‘be’ (similarly to (9.7c)). In the second DS-temporal adverbial clause, it attaches to the transitive verb iwa- ‘wait for’ (note that this clause has undergone an antipassive derivation by auxiliary alternation; §8.3.2).

‘Lying (on the deer; and having cut its throat) it (a puma) was sucking (lit. drinking) its blood.’ lp027

Note that in this example, the lying posture coded by -nitya refers to the A argument (‘puma’) rather than the O argument (‘blood’).

The suffix -jara ‘LIE’ is homophonous with the Aktionsart suffix -jara ‘ADVERS’ (and mostly likely related to it; see §7.5).

Corresponding to the suffix -jara ‘LIE’ is the intransitive verb jara- ‘lie’, shown in (9.10):

9.1.4. -bade ‘HANG’ The suffix -bade ‘HANG’ indicates that a core participant of the event is in a hanging posture.
Example (9.11) shows -bade on intransitive verbs:

320 (9.11) a. JuanS ara-ara-bade-ya.

Corresponding to the suffix -bade is the intransitive verb bade- ‘hang’ as shown in (9.13):

Tudya i-keS taraka=ju bade-tsura-diru-kware. then 1SG-FM corral=LOC hang-GO.UP-GO.PERM-REM.PAST

9.2. Directional suffixes Directional suffixes consist of three members as repeated in Table 9.2:

321
Table 9.2: Directional suffixes

-tsura -bute/butya -sikwa

‘GO.UP’ ‘GO.DOWN’ ‘GO.AWAY’

Directional suffixes are mostly found on independent posture verbs. Unlike posture suffixes, directional suffixes never attach to the copula/auxiliary verb ju- ‘be’.

Directional suffixes are strictly S/O-oriented. In other words, they code the path/trajectory2 of the S or O (but not the A) argument.

9.2.1. -tsura ‘GO UP’ The suffix -tsura ‘GO UP’ indicates that the verb event is associated with an upward direction.
Similarly to -bute/-butya (see §9.2.2), -tsura is essentially found on one of the four posture verbs (ani- ‘sit’, neti- ‘stand’, jara- ‘lie’ and bade- ‘hang’) as shown in (9.14):
(9.14) a. Ani-tsura-kwe! sit-GO.UP-IMP.SG ‘Sit on the cart (lit. go up onto the cart and sit)! (so that you don’t have to walk)’ ka229

kwa-kware=dya i-keS. go-REM.PAST=FOC 1SG-FM

‘I got up (on my feet) and left.’ sd092

2 The term ‘path’ is taken from Talmy (1985). The term ‘trajectory’ is taken from Craig (1994).

322 (An example with -tsura on bade- ‘hang’ is at (9.13) above.)
Only one additional intransitive verb was found in the texts with -tsura, tsajaja‘run’.
Three transitive verbs were found with -tsura in the text corpus: the posture verbs nitya- ‘make stand’ and wana- ‘lay’, and iya- ‘put’ shown in (9.15):
(9.15) a. Nitya-tsura-tsu nawi-sha-ni-kware… make.stand-GO.UP-SS bathe-CAUS-RANDOM-REM.PAST ‘(In the old time, our Cavineña ancestors) would wake them (their children) up (lit. make them stand up) and force them to bathe (very early in the morning)…’ bn011

peccary two tortoise and

‘Then I put the peccary and the two tortoises (I had caught) in my canoe (i.e., moved them up to the edge of the canoe and dropped them in).’ ch015

Note that with these transitive verbs, the upward path/trajectory is associated with the O argument (‘children’ in (9.15a), ‘tied sticks’ in (9.15b) and ‘peccary and two tortoises’ in (9.15c)), not the A argument (‘parents’, ‘ancestors’ and ‘I’ respectively, in these three examples). In the case of intransitive verbs, the upward path/trajectory is about the S argument (‘you’ in (9.14a), ‘we’ in (9.14b) and ‘I’ in (9.14c)).

323 In addition to these three transitive verbs, -tsura was accepted by Francisco Vaca on the the transitive perception verbs peta- ‘look at’ (peta-tsura- ‘look up at something’), ba- ‘see’ (ba-tsura- ‘see something up’) and bajiyu- ‘turn head and see’ (bajiyu-tsura- ‘turn head and see something up’). However, Francisco did not accept tsura on many other verbs, notably *baka-tsura- (hear-GO.UP-), *kweja-tsura- (informGO.UP), iwa-tsura- (wait.for-GO.UP).

Corresponding to the suffix -tsura is the verb tsura- ‘go up’ as shown in (9.16):

liana=PERL =MAYBE 3DL

go.up-IMPFV

‘They (the two legendary brothers) would probably climb (on top of the trees) along lianas.’ hm026

9.2.2. -bute/-butya ‘GO DOWN’
The suffix -bute/-butya indicates that the verb event is associated with a downward direction. The form -bute is used with intransitive verbs while the form -butya is used with transitive verbs.

Similarly to -tsura, -bute is essentially found with posture verbs, either ani- ‘sit’ or jara‘lie’ (it is not attested with neti- ‘stand’ or bute- ‘hang’) as shown in (9.17):

(9.17) a. Bandia

Tata!

Nubi-kwe! enter-IMP.SG

Ani-bute-kwe! sit-GO.DOWN-IMP.SG

‘I lay down (on my raft) and I swam.’ mj061

(Note that ani-bute- (sit-GO.DOWN-) is also used describing a plane landing.)

324 Three transitive verbs were found with -bute: iya- ‘put’, ijewe- ‘throw’ and ba‘see’, as shown in (9.18):

(9.18) a. [E-kwe e-nasi]O

=bakwe iya-butya-kware.

1SG-GEN 1-older.sister =CONTR put-GO.DOWN-REM.PAST

‘I looked down at my hip again (where I thought the viper had bitten me).’ ce038

Note that with -butya, similarly to -tsura (and -sikwa ‘GO.AWAY’; see following section), the downward path/trajectory is associated with the O arguments (‘older sister’ in (9.18a), ‘the one that was going carrying…’ in (9.18b) and ‘my hip’ in (9.18c)) not the A argument. With intransitive verbs (and -bute), the downward path/trajectory is about the S argument (‘you’ in (9.17a) and ‘I’ in (9.17b)).
Similartly to -tsura, Francisco Vaca refused -butya on baka- ‘hear’ (*baka-butya-) and kweja- ‘inform’ (*kweja-butya-) (unfortunately we did not have the chance to ask for peta- ‘look at’ and bajiyu- ‘turn head and see’).
Both suffixes -bute and -butya have corresponding verbs, bute- ‘go down’ and butya- ‘lower’ respectively, as shown in (9.19). (Note that the verbs bute- ‘go down’ and tsura- ‘go up’ are also used meaning ‘going downriver’ and ‘going upriver’ respectively.)

‘Remove (lit. lower) the pot from the fire!’ di0375

Note that both verbs (and both suffixes) are formally related. Similarity to verbs netiand nitya- (see §9.1.2), the transitive form is the causativised version of the intransitive one, via an old causative suffix -a.

9.2.3. -sikwa ‘GO AWAY’ The suffix -sikwa ‘GO AWAY’ codes the fact that the verb event is associated with a motion away from the reference point.

Similarly to -tsura and -bute, the suffix -sikwa is essentially found with posture verbs as shown in (9.20):

(9.20) a. Re-waCC=keS =tuS

JaimeS ani-sikwa-wa.

326

A textual example with ani- (with its meaning ‘live’) is (9.21):

‘When they (the enemies) almost killed them (our Cavineña ancestors), they (our ancestors) moved away to live at the place where our village is nowadays.’ hs045

The suffix -sikwa ‘GO AWAY’ is only found in the corpus with transitive verbs iya- ‘put’ and nitya- ‘make stand’, shown in (9.22):

(9.22) a. E-raA =tuO

iya-sikwa-ya

mukeO [peya shitara=ju].

peya=keja!

there=LIG plank make.stand-GO.AWAY-IMP.SG other=LOC.GNL

‘Put that plank aside vertically!’ di2139

Note that with these transitive verbs, similarly to -tsura and -butya, -sikwa codes the path/trajectory of the O arguments (‘brazil nuts’ in (9.22a) and ‘plank’ in (9.22b)) not the A argument. In the case of intransitive verbs, the ‘away from reference point’ path/trajectory is about the S argument (‘Jaime’ in (9.20a,b), ‘our ancestors’ in (9.20c) and (9.21).)
The suffix -sikwa does not have a corresponding verb. All we can say at the present stage is that it is made of the formative kwa which is possibly historically related to the verb kwa- ‘go’.

327 9.2.4. S/O-orientation We saw that directional suffixes code the path/trajectory associated with the S argument (if the verb is intransitive) or the O argument (if the verb is transitive) but never with the A argument.
The S/O-orientation (as well as the semantics) of these suffixes in Cavineña makes them very similar to the category of directionals found in Mayan languages (see among others Robertson 1980, Haviland 1991, 1993, Craig 1994 and Zavala 1994) and Papua New Guinea languages (Foley 1986: 148-52). Conversely, these suffixes constrast with the S/A-oriented motion suffixes (-nati/-ti ‘GO.TEMP’, -diru ‘GO.PERM’, -na ‘COME.TEMP’, -eti ‘COME.PERM’ and -kena ‘LEAVE’; in slot H of the predicate structure) which correspond to ‘associated motion’ and/or ‘motion with purpose’ category (as found in some Australian and South-American languages; see §7.2.) (See Guillaume 2000b for further discussion of these two categories in Cavineña and other languages.)
9.3. Distribution Postural and directional suffixes occupy slot F of the predicate. They form a single paradigm of mutually exclusive members. For example, the transitive verb iwa- ‘wait for O’ can be marked by both postural suffixes -jara ‘LIE’ (as in (9.8)) and -bade ‘HANG’ (as in (9.12)). However, iwa- cannot be marked by both suffixes at the same time (*iwa-jara-bade- or *iwa-bade-jara-). Similarly, the transitive iya- ‘put’ can be marked by both -tsura ‘GO.UP’ (as in (9.15c)) and -sikwa ‘GO.AWAY’ (as in (9.22a)). But iya- cannot be marked by both suffixes simultaneously (*iya-tsura-sikwa- or *iyasikwa-tsura-). No attempt was made to elicitate co-occurrence of a postural suffix and a directional suffix. However, this is never attested in the data.
Full reduplication of a verb root with antipassive effect (§5.5 and §8.3.1) never reduplicates affixes (unlike full reduplication with distributional effect; §5.5 and §10.6). Postural/directional suffixes will therefore attach to the reduplicated root such as -neti ‘STAND’ in (9.4a) and -bade ‘HANG’ in (9.11a).
Postural/directional suffixes will always co-occur with inflectional affixes (slot

328 A/K) since these are obligatory (an exception is when TAM inflectional affixes are dropped for stylistic purposes; see §6.1.6).

Examples of postural/directional co-occurring with valency-changing affixes (slot C/G) are at (9.23):

(9.23) a. aniD-tsuraF-shaG-waK sit-GO.UP-CAUS-PERF

(*ani-sha-tsura-wa)

b. kC-iyaD-butyaF-tiG-nukaH-chineK REF-put-GO.DOWN-REF-REITR-REC.PAST ‘(we) put (our bags) down (in the cart)’ vb055

Examples showing postural/directional suffixes co-occurring with (optional) Aktionsart suffixes (slot H) are: — (9.5a) and (9.13) showing postural -nitya ‘STAND’ and directional -tsura ‘GO.UP’ followed by the motion suffix -diru ‘GO.PERM’ (in addition to the obligatory TAM -kware ‘REM.PAST’); — (9.14b) showing directional -tsura ‘GO.UP’ followed by motion suffix -eti ‘COME.PERM’; — (9.18c) showing directional -butya ‘GO.DOWN’ followed by -nuka ‘REITR’. Note that following the application of -butya and -nuka on ba- ‘see’, the verb undergoes a Øderivation auxiliary-taking process; — (9.24) showing directional -tsura followed by the completive -tere ‘COMP’:

‘(The man who had heard the noise said: “Get up everybody, someone wants to kill us!”). When he said thus to them, they all stood up.’ cc019

329 9.4. Suffixes vs. compounded/serialised verbs?
One might want to analyse postural and directional morphemes as compounded or serialised roots (rather than suffixes) since most of these also occur as independent verbs in the language. Let us recall that a similar issue is discussed for Aktionsart suffixes (see §7.7). Similarly to Aktionsarts, we will prefer the suffix analysis here. This is because we are missing a corresponding verb for -sikwa ‘GO.AWAY’, a form that otherwise behaves grammatically exactly similarly to the remaing six morphemes. A unified analysis in terms a single paradigm of suffixes appears thus a simpler option than treating six suffixes as compounded/serialised and one differently as a suffix.

10 Predicate structure — auxiliary-taking processes
Auxiliary-taking processes prevent a verb/copula/auxiliary from taking any additional suffixes. Once an auxiliary-taking process has been applied to a verb, additional verbal suffixes can still be applied but they have to be carried by a copula/auxiliary.
Six auxiliary-taking processes have been identified. First, there are five auxiliarytaking suffixes: -kara/-karama ‘DESID’, -metse ‘FIRST’, -jakama ‘CEASELESSLY’, -bawe/baekwa ‘ALWS’ and -ki/-aki ‘TYPICAL’ (they will be called mode suffixes). These fall into slot I of the predicate. They are discussed in §10.1.
Second, there are three phonologically independent markers which are preposed to the verb: nere ‘VIGOROUSLY’, yume ‘IMMEDIATELY’, riya ‘STARTLING’ and pana ‘PROPERLY’. These fall into slot B of the predicate. They are discussed in §10.2.
Third, there is a discontinuous marker, jadya/ejebucha …-e ‘MAN’. This morpheme has two parts. It has a phonologically independent part (jadya or ejebucha), which fills slot B, combined with a suffix -e, which fills slot I. The discontinuous marker is discussed in §10.3.
Fourth, there is a series of phonologically independent markers which are postposed to the verb (slot J). They consist of quantifier markers based on the numeral series. Auxiliary-taking postposed markers are discussed in §10.4.
The fifth auxiliary-taking process consists of a Ø-marker. Here an auxiliary is required without any clear specific marker. Often however, this process is accompanied by ‘incorporation’ of an element (independent particle or postpositional phrase). This is discussed in §10.5.

331
The sixth, and last, auxiliary-taking process is full reduplication. This process has a distributive effect. It is discussed in §10.6.
An auxiliary-taking process can be applied on a verb that already has an auxiliary — this can be a basic non-inflecting verb or a verb to which an auxiliary-taking process has previously been applied. With some auxiliary-taking processes (e.g., the suffixes -kara/-karama ‘DESID’) this has the effect of triggering an additional auxiliary. With some other auxiliary-taking processes, no additional auxiliary is required. A summary of attested combinations of two auxiliary-taking processes is in §10.7.
Auxiliary-taking processes also combine with verbal categories from other slots. This is discussed in §10.8.

10.1. Auxiliary-taking suffixes Mode suffixes occupy slot I of the predicate (in addition to slot E for the auxiliary).

10.1.1. -kara/-karama ‘DESID’
The suffixes -kara ‘DESIDesiderative’ and -karama ‘DESIDerative NEGative’ (-ma is a negative formative most likely related to the ma ending in da-adjective negative suffix -dama; §11.2.4) code ‘want to V’ and ‘not want to V’ respectively.

Examples of intransitive verbs are at (10.1):

(10.1) a. Jutakiju eju =miS

tawi-kara

therefore INT:LOC =2SG(-FM) sleep-DESID

b. I-keS cuartel=ju kwa-kara. 1SG-FM barracks=LOC go-DESID
‘I want to do the military service (lit. I want to go to the barracks).’ sd002

In (10.3) and (10.2), -kara modifies intransitive non-inflecting verbs. This results in

332 triggering another auxiliary.

In (10.2), -kara modifies the non-inflecting verb bawe ju- ‘know E’ (as an extended intransitive verb; note that this verb is ambitransitive, also having an A/O frame; see §5.3.6):

‘Why do you want to know where I go?’ du014

In (10.3), -kara modifies the non-inflecting verb ejebucha ju-neni- e ju- ‘live this way’ (i.e., the verb ju-neni- ‘be in many places (be-RANDOM)’ having taken the auxiliarytaking discontinuous marked jadya …-e ‘MAN’; see §10.3).

Example of transitive verbs are (10.4) (note that (10.4a) is (T2.10)):

‘I wanted to eat it (a cayman) but couldn’t. It was too smelly.’ lg053

333 Example of the negative desiderative suffix -karama ‘DESID.NEG’ are at (10.5):

(10.5) a. Jadya=tibu i-keS kwa-karama thus=REASON 1SG-FM go-DESID.NEG

ijewe-karama a-ya. throw-DESID.NEG affect-IMPFV ‘I don’t want to die (lit. throw my bones) here.’ sd058

(See also nubi-kara ju- ‘she wanted to go back inside’ in (T3.5), kwa-karama ju- ‘I didn’t want to go’ at (T2.23), kueti-karama ju- ‘they don’t want to cross’ at (T2.89), kiye-ti-kara ju- ‘they were about to kill each other’ at (T2.111).)

In (10.6) (this is (T3.2)), -karama ‘DESID.NEG’ occurs on the transitive (but passivised) non-inflecting verb jucha a- ‘have sex with O’:

(10.6)

Tume =pa =tuS

tawi-ya=keS jucha

then =REP =3SG(-FM) sleep-IMPFV=LIG have.sex.with

a-ta-karama

ju-kware.

affect-PASS-DESID.NEG be-REM.PAST

‘When they (a woman and her husband) were sleeping (in the mosquito net), she refused to have sex.’ mm003

How does Cavineña expresses the idea of ‘want O to do V’, i.e., when the subject of V is different from the subject of ‘want’? The answer is again a morphological one. The only way this is achieved is by causativising V (suffixes -sha for intransitive verbs and -mere for transitive verbs; see §8.4.1 and §8.4.2 respectively) in addition to the desiderative suffix. Literally, ‘want O to do V’ is expressed by ‘want to make O V’.

334 As an illustration, consider (10.7a) (with an intransitive verb) and (10.7b) (with a transitive verb) (an elicited example) below:

(10.7) a. Datse e-naO

kwinana-sha-kara a-kware.

‘I want you to paint my house (lit. I want to make you paint my house).’ n1.0409

10.1.2. -metse ‘FIRST’
The suffix -metse ‘FIRST’ is only found in very few examples from texts. It codes the fact that the subject participant performs the verb event before anybody else does: S ‘first’ is shown in (10.8), and A ‘first’ in (10.9a,b)):

(10.8)

Kwa-metse i-keS ju-wa [tumi

335 ‘You are the one who saw the tapir first when it crossed (the stream). (So why didn’t you shoot at it?)’ n5 p90

The suffix -metse can as well code the fact that the verb event is performed upon the O participant before it is performed over other O participants, as illustrated in (10.10) (note that this is the only text example available):

(10.10)

[Peya a-tsa-metse

‘(The enemies had attacked the two legendary brothers.) The one (brother) they had shot first was (already) dead. (The other one was still alive.)’ hm161

10.1.3. -jakama ‘CEASELESSLY’ The suffix -jakama ‘CEASELESSLY’ is used to code the fact that an event/situation/activity unusually keeps occurring or keeps being repeated.

Examples with -jakama on intransitive verbs are at (10.11):

(10.11) a. [Dutya apuna] =tuS

kwa-jakama ju-kware

all

night =3SG(-FM) go-CEASELESSLY be-REM.PAST

[meta babi=ra]… by.night hunt=PURP.MOT
‘Every night he would keep going hunting… (until he met an evil spirit)’ ve003

b. Ejebuchajuatsu =dyadi =tunaS tsaa-tsaa ju-jakama INT:REASON =STRG.EMPH =3PL laugh-REDUP be-CEASELESSLY

[riyaCC=ke ura]?

be-IMPFV here=LIG time

‘Why don’t they stop laughing now? (I don’t find it funny anymore.)’

336 di1014
Note that in (10.11b), -jakama is applied after the auxiliary-taking reduplication process (§10.6) is applied. This triggers an auxiliary on which -jakama is attached.

Under the ‘bedroom’ of the house I was living in in Misión Cavinas, there was a space where a whole family of pigs was sleeping every night. While searching for an example with tawi-jakama ju- ‘sleep ceaselessly’, Emerenciano Sepa proposed (10.12):

(10.12)

Tu-wa=dya =tuS

kuchi=kwanaS tawi-jakama

ju-ya.

there-LOC=FOC =3SG(-FM) pig=PL

sleep-CEASELESSLY be-IMPFV

‘Right there (under the ‘bedroom’), the pigs always sleep.’ n5.0535

Cavineña people hardly ever fence their domestic animals. One bad consequence of this is that the rice fields are systematically damaged by the cattle. When I asked Emerenciano Sepa to give me an example with ara-jakama a- ‘eat ceaselessly’ (a transitive example) he proposed (10.13):

(10.13)

Ara-jakama =tu-ja =tuO

a-ya

arusuO

eat-CEASELESSLY =3SG-DAT =3SG(-FM) affect-IMPFV rice

waka=kwana=raA. cow=PL=ERG ‘The cattle always eat the rice (in the fields).’ n5.0536

Note that there is little doubt -jakama ‘CEASELESSLY’ is historically related to the Aktionsart suffix -jaka ‘STOP’ (see §7.1.2) and the negative formative -ma (presumably the same one found in -karama (§10.1.1) and da-adjectives negative suffix -dama ‘NEG’ (§11.2.4)).

10.1.4. -bawe ‘ALWS’ and -baekwa ‘ALWS.NEG’
The suffixes -bawe ‘ALWayS’ and its negative counterpart -baekwa ‘ALWayS NEGative’ code the meanings ‘like to V, can V, always V, typically V’. These suffixes are quite transparently related to the extended intransitive non-inflecting verbs: bawe ju-

337 ‘know E’ and its negative counterpart baekwa ju- ‘not know E’ (see §5.3.6).

Intransitive non-inflecting verbs derived from intransitive inflecting verbs are illustrated in (10.14) (with -bawe) and (10.15) (with -baekwa):

(10.14) a. E-kwatsa=ju =tuS

‘Always’ suffixes are very peculiar (i.e., very unlike other auxiliary-taking processes) in many ways. First of all, the auxiliary very often drops (whereas this happens very rarely with other auxiliary-taking processes).
Secondly, non-inflecting verbs derived from transitive inflecting verbs are S=O ambitransitive (i.e., either intransitive or transitive, with the O of the transitive that corresponds to the S of the intransitive).
Non-inflecting intransitive ‘always’ verbs have a single core argument S which

338 corresponds to the original O (of the non-derived inflecting verb) and often — but not obligatorily — an oblique dative which corresponds to the original A. This is illustrated with a minimal pair of (elicited) sentences in (10.16) (with -bawe) and (10.17) (with -baekwa) (a-examples are intransitive, b-examples are transitive):

(10.16) a. Bina=ja =tuS

paji-u-siCC=tibu. hard-ASF-AUGM=REASON ‘I never hoe this grass because it is too hard.’ the n5. p65

Additional examples are given in (10.18) (intransitive) and in (10.19) (transitive):

(10.18)

karu-bawe. bite-ALWS

‘These things (ants and other types of insects) bite use when we go hunting.’ di2632

A third peculiarity of non-inflecting verbs derived with ‘always’ suffixes is that they can only take the intransitive auxiliary ju- ‘be’, even if they are transitive. This is very surprising because transitive non-inflecting verbs derived by other auxiliary-taking processes invariably take the transitive auxiliary a- ‘affect’. This is illustrated in (10.20) (and see the almost same example in (10.18) but without the copula verb) and (10.21) (this is (T2.110)):

(10.20) a. [Yawa nana-daCC=ju]

‘They (Araona people) would always call me through the radio when they were sick or something.’ ao110

The suffixes -bawe and -baekwa can only attach to verbs (not to other word classes). Interestingly, they can attach to the copula verb of a copula clause with an adjective in CC function. This allows the adjective to be modified (albeit indirectly) by these suffixes. This is illustrated in (10.22):

(10.22) a. … ujeje-daCC sick-ASF

ju-bawe be-ALWS

ju-kware. be-REM.PAST

‘… we were always sick (because of the wind).’ di2584

de-daCC ju-bawe.

cayman chest =3SG(-FM) deep-ASF be-ALWS

‘The ditches (lit. cayman chest) are always deep.’ di1935

In (10.23), we show a complex example where a copula clause (with adjective ujeje‘sick’ as CC) is first marked by the auxiliary-taking suffix -jakama ‘CEASELESSLY’ (§10.1.3) and secondly marked by -bawe ‘ALWS’:

(10.23)

[E-kwita tsena-kiCC NPF-body worm-WITH

ju-atsu=dya] =ekwanaS

be-SS=FOC

ujeje-daCC ju-jakama

ju-bawe.

sick-ASF be-CEASELESSLY be-ALWS

‘When we have worms in the body (lit. when the body is with worms), we are always sick.’ di1313

10.1.5. -ki /-aki ‘TYPICAL’ The suffixes -ki and -aki ‘TYPICAL’ only occur in a few examples in the available data. These suffixes are possibly related to the adjectiviser of nouns -ki ‘WITH’ (§11.3.1).

341 They code the meanings ‘being in the process of V-ing’, ‘can V’, ‘typically V’, ‘have the particular quality of V-ing’. No clear semantic differences could be found between -ki and -aki. In this study they will be treated as two variants of a single morpheme. They are briefly discussed here and will require more investigation.

Examples showing -ki and -aki ‘TYPICAL’ on intransitive verbs are illustrated in (10.24) (intransitive) and (10.25) (transitive):

(10.24) a. Jitsu-ki

c. [TumeCC=ke kwati]S =tuS there=LIG firewood =3SG(-FM)

Asika-daCC =tu-keCS. dirty-ASF =3SG-FM
‘You need to wash you mosquito net. It is dirty.’ n5 p.69

Non-inflecting transitive verbs with -ki have the original O occurring as a modifier preposed to the adjective, as shown in (10.26). (These have presumably undergone an antipassive derivation by auxiliary alternation with incorporation of the O; §8.3.2):

342

(10.26) a. RapaS =tuS

[kirika=kwana ara-ki].

ju-kware. be(ANTIPASS)-REM.PAST

‘A the river was spreading, the flow was beating on the house with its strength.’ di2221

It is quite possible that, similarly to non-inflecting verbs derived from transitive verbs by ‘always’ suffixes -bawe and -baekwa (§10.1.4), non-inflecting verbs derived from transitive verbs by (at least) -aki are ambitransitive. This is suggested by (10.27) which are intransitive (note that examples a. shows S=O ambitransitivity while example b. shows S=A ambitransitivity):

(10.27) a. S=O

Some kinship relations are encoded by idiomatic expressions involving noninflecting verbs derived by -ki (not -aki) such as father and mother, as in (10.28):

343

10.2. Auxiliary-taking preposed markers

Manner modifiers consist of four members that go to slot B of the predicate. They are repeated in Table 10.1:

10.2.1. nere ‘VIGOROUSLY’
The marker nere ‘VIGOROUSLY’ codes the fact that the verb event occurs in a very hard, fast, sudden, vigorous, brusque and unexpected fashion. Examples with intransitive verbs are at (10.29):1

1 Note that the auxiliary always forms a separate constituent from the non-inflecting verb (see discussion of this in §4.6.1 and §5.4). As result, when a non-inflecting verb consists of more than one phonological word, the brackets only include the words that constitutes the non-inflecting constituent, not the auxiliary.

10.2.2. yume ‘IMMEDIATELY’ The marker yume ‘IMMEDIATELY’ codes the fact that the verb event occurs immediately, as reflex, as an instantaneous reaction to some other event.

‘When I stepped on it, the cayman vigorously jumped out (lit. emerged) (of the water). (It opened its mouth and tried to bite me. I got very scared and) immediately pointed my rifle at it (and shot and killed it).’ lg012

Note that in (10.32b), the marker yume ‘IMMEDIATELY’ contrasts with the marker nere ‘VIGOROUSLY’, used three sentences earlier in the same text. Both markers code very fast events which occur as reactions to some other events (‘stepping on the back of cayman’ with nere, and ‘being scared’ with yume). However, they differ in that nere puts the emphasis on the intensity of the reaction while yume puts the emphasis on the timing.
Note that in all examples above, the focus particle =dya (§17.4) is used together

346 with yume. This is indeed the case for most examples in the data. In some of our written texts, however, =dya is not used, suggesting that might not be obligatory.

10.2.3. riya ‘STARTLING’
The marker riya ‘STARTLING’, codes the fact that an event occurs suddenly and unexpectedly and causes the S/A referent to startle. Only a few examples of this morpheme are available.

It is illustrated in (10.33a) (with an intransitive verb) and (10.33b) (with a transitive verb):

(10.33) a. [I-keS tu-wa ju-neti-ya=ju]

‘(I heard a tumult of barking but I could not figure out what was happening.) It seems like the dogs had come across a group of peccaries (which startled them).’ wa013

10.2.4. pana ‘PROPERLY’
The marker pana ‘PROPERLY’ is semantically quite different from the previous three (which all had to do with coding sudden events). It codes the fact that an event is performed with a lot of care, attention, precision and thoroughness.

347 In all examples (except (10.35) below) pana occurs with transitive verbs, as shown in (10.34):

(10.34) a. Tachi-kware e-raA. [Pana tachi] =ØA

FILL PROPERLY kill affect-REM.PAST FILL

‘(I took the monkey by the tail, hit it with a stick and finally) managed to kill him (lit. I killed him properly).’ aj036

The marker pana is also found with baka- ‘hear’ (pana baka a- ‘hear carefully’), adeba- ‘know’ (pana adeba a- ‘know very well’), tirya- ‘finish’ (pana tirya a- ‘finish completely’).

The only example found where pana modifies an intransitive verb is (10.35) (from the dictionary):

(10.35)

[Pana jekutana] =ØS

ju-chine.

PROPERLY get.scared (=1SG-FM) be-REC.PAST

‘I got very scared (by a partridge; on my way back).’ di1707

10.2.5. Miscellaneous Auxiliary-taking preposed markers do not trigger an additional auxiliary when they are

348 applied to (basic or derived) non-inflecting verbs.

In (10.36), the non-inflecting verb katewa ju- ‘hide’ takes pana ‘PROPERLY’ giving pana katewa ju- ‘hide very well’ (with no additional auxiliary):

(10.36)

[Pana katewa] =tuS

PROPERLY hide =3SG(-FM) be-REC.PAST NEG=INT=DAT find-ABIL

‘He hid very well. Nobody can find him.’ n5 p74

In (10.37) the transitive verb peta- ‘look at O’ first takes the manner modifier pana ‘PROPERLY’, giving pana peta a- ‘look at O properly’ and, second, the desiderative suffix -kara ‘DESID’, resulting in pana peta a-kara a- ‘wanting to look at O properly’ with a second auxiliary:

(10.37)

[Tu-raA [pana peta] 3SG-ERG PROPERLY look.at

a-kara affect-DESID

a-ya=ju] affect-IMPFV=DS

=pa =tuS

aputa-kware.

=REP =3SG(-FM) disappear-REM.PAST

‘When hei wanted to look at himj properly, hej disappeared.’ du024

The markers yume ‘IMMEDIATELY’ and riya ‘STARTLING’ are likely to be historically related to the pointing demonstratives riya ‘here’ and yume ‘over there’ (see §15.8). We have no idea of the origin of nere ‘VIGOROUSLY’ and pana ‘PROPERLY’.

10.3. Auxiliary-taking discontinuous marker The discontinuous marker jadya …-e ‘MANner’ and its interrogative counterpart ejebucha …-e ‘MANner.INTerrogative’ occupy slots B and I of the predicate.
The meaning of the manner marker jadya …-e ‘MANner’ is to refer back (i.e. anaphorically) to an event that was performed in a particular, unusual and nonconventional way. As for the interrogative counterpart, it is used to question the particular way an event occurs.

349

Examples of jadya …-e ‘MANner’ with intransitive verbs are at (10.38):

Examples of jadya …-e ‘MANner’ with transitive verbs are at (10.39) (note that (10.39b) is (T2.109)):

(10.39) a. [Jadya iye-e] =tu-keO =ØA

ju-wa=ju].

3PL REF-kill-REF-DESID be-PERF=DS

‘This is how I went to see them (the Araona peope) when they were about to kill each other.’

There is very strong tendency for verbs marked by jadya …-e to occur in sentence initial position, as can be seen in most examples provided so far. This is not an absolute requirement however, as shown by (10.38b) and (10.41) (this is (T2.57)) below, where

351 the S pronominal NP argument ekwana ‘1PL’ comes first:

(10.41)

EkwanaS =ekwanaS [jadya ani-e=ama]

1PL

=1PL

MAN sit-MAN=NEG

ju-ya. be-IMPFV

‘We (Cavineña people) do not live (lit. sit) like this (i.e. fighting each other).’ ao057

Another observed tendency is for the marker jadya …-e ‘MAN’ to be used towards the end of narratives, as a sort of anaphoric conclusion/recapitulation formula. See for example (T2.111) (also at (10.40c) above). This is because any story is about an event that happened in a particular way (and thus worth a story).
We should note that the jadya and ejebucha parts of manner markers also exist independently as jadya ‘thus’ and ejebucha ‘INT.SIMLR’. As such, they do not form a constituent with the verb, they can occur anywhere in the clause, and they do not require an -e suffix on the verb, as can be seen in examples in (10.42):
(10.42) a. Jadya =yatseS biaje=ju ka-bajeje-ti-ni-chine. thus =1DL trip=LOC REF-prepare-REF-RANDOM-REC.PAST ‘This is how (on the floor) we (dl) slept (lit. prepared ourselves) during the trip.’ ft019
b. Ani-ya jadya wija-sha=ishu. sit-IMPFV thus sprout-CAUS=PURP.GNL ‘(Corn seeds) would stay (lit. sit) this way (i.e. in water from 1 to 3 days) in order to make them sprout (while preparing corn beer).’ ci075

The meaning of these sentences is different from sentences where jadya or ejebucha are parts of manner markers. In (10.42) ‘the way’ the action is performed has nothing particular and unusual. It is just the normal way of ‘sleeping during a trip’ or ‘preparing corn beer.’
The auxiliary-taking marker jadya/ejebucha …-e does not appear to trigger another auxiliary when applied on a (basic or derived) non-inflecting verb. It is found

352 on one occasion on the transitive non-inflecting verb kwatsabiji a- ‘tell story to O’ detransitivised by the antipassive derivation (by auxiliary alternation) as kwatsabiji ju‘chat’. The result is ejebucha kwatsabiji ju-e ju- ‘how to chat’ (pa086). (The original example is not fully reproduced here because of additional complexities.)

10.4. Auxiliary-taking postposed markers
There is a set of quantifier markers based on the numeral series (see §10.4). These are used to specify the number of times an event is performed: pidya ‘ONCE’ (corresponding to peadya ‘one’ with idiosyncratic phonological change ea -> i), beta ‘TWICE’ (corresponding to beta ‘two’) and kimisha ‘THREE.TIMES’ (corresponding to kimisha ‘three’). (It it possible that there are auxiliary-taking quantifier markers corresponding to higher numbers such as pushi ‘four’, pishika ‘five’, etc., but they are not attested in the data.) (Note that quantifier markers have a corresponding series which function as postpositions: pidya ‘ONE.WHOLE’, beta ‘TWO.WHOLE’ and kimisha ‘THREE.WHOLE’; see §14.8.2.)

Quantifier markers occupy slot J of the predicate. They form independent phonological words. If a quantifier marker is used with a mono-syllabic verb stem, the mono-syllabic verb cliticises on the quantifier (as a proclitic), in order to comply with the requirement that an independent phonological word must have a minimum of two syllables (see §3.1.2). This can be seen with =pidya ‘ONCE’ modifying kwa- ‘go’ in (10.43a) and kimisha ‘THREE.TIMES’ modifying ju- ‘be’ in (10.43c).

Quantifier markers are illustrated with intransitive verbs in (10.43):

(10.43) a. [Kwa=pidya] =ØS

ju-kware Tumichucua=ju.

go=ONCE

Auxiliary-taking quantifier markers are not found applied on non-inflecting verbs and it is not known if they require an additional auxiliary.

10.5. Auxiliary-taking Ø-marker
There is a very interesting process where an auxiliary is required without any specific marking (unlike all the processes described above where the auxiliary-taking process was clearly the function of a specific marker — e.g., suffix -kara ‘DESID’, marker nere ‘VIGOROUSLY’, reduplication, etc.). This phenomenon is not fully understood yet and as a result the following discussion remains tentative and provisional.

354

The Ø-marking process can be illustrated with (10.45), showing the intransitive inflecting verb kastere- ‘become tired’ in (a.) and its corresponding Ø-marked intransitive non-inflecting verb kastere ju- ‘get tired’ in (b.):

(10.45) a. Chapa=kwanaS =shana kastere-wa.

dog=PL

=PITY become.tired-PERF

‘My poor dogs were (very) tired (having fought so much with the anteater).’ ba146

b. [Yanakana kastere] =shana ekwitaS ju-kware. in.vain become.tired =PITY person be-REM.PAST
‘The poor man got tired (preparing for his wedding) for nothing (because his wife decided to marry someone else).’ mu048

The pair of examples in (10.46) shows the same Ø-marking process with the transitive inflecting verb tinu- ‘pull O’ in (a.) and its transitive non-inflecting verb equivalent tinu a- ‘pull O’ in (b.):

(10.46) a. … jae=raA tinu-kware amena [wika

fish=ERG pull-REM.PAST FILL

hook

‘… the fish pulled the big hook…’ ps018

[ari-daCC=ke]]O… big-ASF=LIG

b. Tume =tu-keO =ekwanaA [ebarukwe=keja tinu] a-ya then =3SG-FM =1PL(-ERG) top=LOC.GNL pull affect-IMPFV
[ai shasha]O. INT flower ‘We will pull whatever flower (tied to a liana) towards the top (of the forest canopy) (to distract the Cavineñas in order to attack them).’ hm109

In many cases (as in both (10.45a) and (10.46b) above) — but not always —, the Ø-marked non-inflecting verb has ‘incorporated’ (into slot B of the predicate) an element: independent particle yanakana ‘in vain’ in (10.45a) and general locative

355 postpositional phrase ebarukwe=keja ‘towards the top’ in (10.46b). (This is shown by the square brackets.) The main evidence for the element and the Ø-marked verb forming a constituent is second position clitic placement. When the element and the non-inflecting verb come first in the sentence, second position clitics attach to the last word of the sequence. This is clearly seen with the second position particle =shana ‘PITY’ in (10.45b) and with =tu ‘3’ in (10.47) below:

(10.47)

[Yanakana kemi] =tuA

a-kware

in.vain buy =3SG(-ERG) affect-REM.PAST

[una=ishuCC=kwana=ke ara=ishuCC=kwana=ke jadya]O. suit=PURP.GNL=PL=LIG eat=PURP.GNL=PL=LIG and
‘He (the man who was supposed to get married) bought clothes and provisions for nothing (since the wedding did not take place).’ mu047

One could argue that yanakana ‘in vain’ and ebarukwe=keja ‘toward the top’ are markers that trigger the auxiliary-taking process (identically to markers discussed in earlier sections such as -kara ‘DESID’, nere ‘VIGOROUSLY’, reduplication, etc.). (Note that yanakana is found in both (10.45b) and (10.47).) This does not appear to be the case however. First, yanakana ‘in vain’ and ebarukwe=keja have an existence on their own with the same meanings. In (10.48), for example, there are no non-inflecting verbs and yanakana is clearly not ‘incorporated’.

This is also the case for other types of ‘incorporated’ elements such as jadya ‘thus’ in (10.49a) (with an intransitive verb) and (10.49b) (with a transitive verb) (see (10.42a) above for an example of jadya used independently) as well as yudijidya ‘once more’ in (10.50) ((10.50a) shows the non-inflecting verb with incorporated yudijidya while (10.50b) show yudijidya used independently):

An example showing an associative postpositional phrase ‘incorporated’ is shown in (10.51):

(10.51)

Iyakwa =tuS

[avioneta=tsewe tsuru] ju-ya

now =3SG(-FM) light.plane=ASSOC meet be-IMPFV bull

‘(The bull didn’t want to leave the airstrip. Someone said:) “the plane is going to bump into (lit. with) the bull.”’ at012

In (10.52) (this is (T2.107), a ‘similarity’ adverbial clause is ‘incorporated’ within a Ømarked non-inflecting verb:

(10.52)

[E-na=bucha iji] =tuA

pa-a!

NPF-water=SIMLR drink =3SG(-ERG) JUSS-affect

‘He has to drink it with water (lit. as if it was water)!’ ao107

In all preceding examples, the ‘incorporated’ element precedes the verb (it occurs

357 in slot B). But in some other examples, the ‘incorporated’ element follows the verb (in slot J).

In (10.53) the adjective ji- ‘good’ is ‘incorporated’ and a postposed to a Ø-marked noninflecting verb:

(10.53)

[Tu-keS tawi-ya=tibu]

=tu-raA =ØO

3SG-FM sleep-IMPFV=REASON =3SG-ERG (=1SG-ERG)

[baka ji-dama] hear good-NEG

a-wa. affect-PERF

‘He was sleeping so he didn’t hear me properly (he heard me not well).’ ij013

In (10.54), we have postposed incorporated independent particles jadya ‘thus’ (also found preposed; see examples in (10.49) above) and amena ‘FILL’:

(10.54) a. [Wikamutya=ra kwa-u fishing-PURP.MOT go-PROP

ju-atsu] =tuA be-SS =3SG(-ERG)

358

What is more interesting, however, is that apparently there actually need not be any ‘incorporated’ argument. This is at least the case with intransitive verbs. Two examples are at (10.55):

(10.55) a. Ne-diru-ra,

Mamita!

HORT.NSG-go-HORT.NSG mummy

Wana-diru escape-GO.PERM

b Diru=piisi ju-kwe, Baba-chi! go=JUST be-IMP.SG grand.father-AFFTN ‘(Stop saying you are leaving and) just go, Grandpa!’ n3.0504

Transitive verbs always ‘incorporate’ an element when a Ø-marked auxiliarytaking process is applied. Either it is a peripheral element (as in (10.46b), (10.47) or (10.49b)) in which case their transitive status is maintained, or they ‘incorporate’ their object and then they become intransitive. This latter situation is shown with a few examples at (10.56):
(10.56) a. … [Paraiso=ju ka-rike-ti-tsu] [jae ara] ju-kware. Paraiso=LOC REF-cross-REF-SS fish eat be(ANTIPASS)-REM.PAST
‘… we crossed (the river) at Paraiso and stopped to have our lunch (consisting of fish) (lit. and ate the fish).’ co009

‘(We waited a long time for the missionary ladies to come back.) Maybe they were purchasing (lit. paying) tickets for the trip (lit. to go) to Brazil.’ br015

The first argument for the predicate being intransitive is that the A has become an S. In (10.56c) for example, where the subject is expressed, it is the S form of ‘1SG’, ike, that is used (not the A form era). The second argument is that the auxiliary is the intransitive ju- ‘be’ (not the transitive a- ‘affect’).

Arguing for the object to be ‘incorporated’ is not as straightforward. Note that the O is still unmarked for case (similarly to the O of a transitive predicate). Also note that the O can be a full NP with a head and with regular modifiers such as plural =kwana in (10.56b), quantifier beta ‘two’ and (copula) relative clause (with omitted copula) achacha=ke ‘small’ in (10.56c), and relative clause brasil=ju kwa=ishu=ke ‘to go to Brazil’ in (10.56d). The evidence for ‘incorporation’ is that the original O and the verb form a constituent (exactly like the ‘incorporated’ particles or postpositional phrases discussed above). (Note that regular O in transitive clauses have no ordering restrictions and never form a constituent with the predicate.) It is obligatorily placed immediately before the verb. If the O+V sequence is first in the sentence, second position particles attach to the V (not the O), as with =ekwana ‘1PL’ in (10.56b) and =ni ‘MAYBE’ in (10.56d). It is not possible to have the original O at any other position in the clause. This can be seen with (10.57) consisting of elicited examples from Francisco Vaca:

(10.57) a. I-keS [jae sare-aje]

The detransitivisation process that accompanies the Ø-marked auxiliary-taking process with transitive verbs is surprising. The most likely explanation that we can give at the present time involves the antipassive derivation of non-inflecting transitive verbs by exchanging auxiliaries (see §8.3.2). This would be a two-step process. The transitive inflecting verb is first turned into a transitive non-inflecting verb (by Ø-marking), and secondly turned into an intransitive non-inflecting verb by exchanging the transitive auxiliary with the intransitive auxiliary. For some reason, the output of the first step (a Ø-derived transitive non-inflecting verb) never shows up.

The function (as well as the productivity) of the Ø-marked auxiliary-taking process is quite unclear and requires additional work. Speakers do not see semantic differences between a verb with or without the auxiliary-taking Ø-marker. It might have discourse or stylistic functions. Note also that auxiliary-taking Ø-marking is not very commonly used in texts and might not be productive.

Auxiliary-taking Ø-marker is not found applied on non-inflecting verbs and it is not known whether this would or would not require an additional auxiliary.

10.6. Full reduplication
Full reduplication with distributive meaning applies to both intransitive and transitive (including ditransitive) verbs and to both inflecting and non-inflecting verbs (note that there is a distinct process of full reduplication which only applies to inflecting transitive verb roots and has an antipassive effect; see §5.5 and §8.3.1). This process encodes

361 multiple reiterations of the verb event within short and regular intervals, with the exact same participants and in the exact same settings (location and time).

Full reduplication of intransitive verbs is shown in (10.58):

(10.58) a. Tudya keke-keke

then

shout-REDUP

ju-kware. be-REM.PAST

‘So he (the drunk young man) was yelling and yelling.’ ni024

run-REDUP

=1PL

ju-kware… be-REM.PAST

‘We (hurriedly) ran back and forth (to put all our luggage on the bus).’ ga019

Full reduplication of transitive verbs are illustrated in (10.59):

(10.59) a. Misionero=kwana=raA =ekwanaO iwara-iwara

missionary=PL=ERG =1PL

call-REDUP

‘The missionaries kept calling us.’ n2.0155

a-wa.

=3SG(-ERG) affect-PERF

‘Katemaru did not kill any (peccary). He just kept missing (lit. releasing) them.’ tu017

Non-inflectional suffixes can be reduplicated together with the verb root. Examples with intransitive verbs are shown in (10.60a) (with Aktionsart suffix -baka ‘SHORT (while)’) and (10.60b) (with Aktionsart suffix -chinepe ‘ALL.DAY’):

(10.60) a. [[Neti-baka-neti-baka] ju-ya majaka]

ekatseS

stop-SHORT-REDUP-REDUP be-IMPFV EVEN.THOUGH 3DL

362 diru-chine. go-REC.PAST
‘Even though they (dl) (the pair of oxen pulling our cart) kept stopping (lit. standing) for short periods (all along the way), (at least) they (dl) (still) kept going.’ ka295

b. E-sewena-tereCC =tunaCS amena RES-blacken-COMP =3PL FILL

sun=LOC be-ALL.DAY-REDUP-REDUP be-IMPFV=REASON

‘They have become very dark because they work (lit. are) always in the sun.’ di1210

Examples with suffixes reduplicated together with transitive verbs are at (10.61a) (with the causative suffix -sha)2 and (10.61b) (with the Aktionsart -jeri ‘ALMOST’):

(10.61) a. [Jina-sha-jina-sha=kwana

a-atsu] =tunaA butya-ya.

cook-CAUS-REDUP-REDUP=UNCERT affect-SS =3PL(-ERG) lower-IMPFV

‘They (our Cavineña grandmothers, when preparing manioc beer) would cook it (corn) (lit. let it cook) a little and then put it (the cooking pot) down from the fire.’ ci192

‘I saw the agouti coming towards me and it looked exhausted from the furet that was chasing it and trying to catch it (lit. almost grabbing it many

2 Note that jina- ‘cook’ is intransitive.

363 times).’ ms018
Note that it is not altogether clear what the distributive sense is in (10.61a). The translation given by Antonio Yubanera while transcribing the conversation from which this sentence comes is ‘a little bit’. This could mean that full reduplication can also have a de-intensifying meaning (as happens with full reduplication of adjectives; see §11.2.2). Alternatively, full reduplication here might refer to a back and forth motion of the cooking pot over the fire (performed in order to avoid burning the corn or just to cook it ‘a little bit’).

Full reduplication of a non-inflecting (basic or derived) verb does not require an additional auxiliary. One example of full reduplicatin of basic non-inflecting verb, nereda a- ‘scold O’, is shown in (10.62) (the non-reduplicated version is shown in a. while the reduplicated version is shown in b.):

(10.62) a. Nereda =tu-raA =ØO

a-kware

nereda-nereda scold-REDUP

a-kware. affect-REM.PAST

‘I was scolding him over and over again.’ cu020b

In (10.63), we showed full reduplication applying after nere ‘VIGOROUSLY’ (§10.2.1). Here, the verb pakaka ‘fall’ first takes nere ‘VIGOROUSLY’ giving nere pakaka ju- ‘fall vigorously’, and is then reduplicated.

(10.63)

… [nere

ba-chine. see-REC.PAST

364 ‘I saw the cart suddenly falling down many times (as my daughter was trying to get the pair of oxen back in the path).’ ka381
As we can see, neither (10.62) nor (10.63b) require an additional auxiliary.
(See also reduplication of ijine-kara ju- ‘want to stray’ into ijine-kara ijine-kara ju- at (10.68).)

10.7. Combination of two auxiliary-taking processes

Combination of two auxiliary-taking processes is rare, but possible. Table 10.2 below is a summary of all combinations attested in the data (processes from the left column are applied before processes from the top row). Processes which have not been found in combinations have not been included (-metse ‘FIRST’, quantifier markers and Ø-marker). The same process is never attested to occur twice (this is shown by shaded cells). Processes which could logically be combined, but are not attested, are shown by a question mark ‘?’. Combinations of two processes which have been attested are given a number that cross-references an illustrative example to be found earlier in this chapter or below the table.

10.8. Combinations with other verbal categories
Verbal suffixes (postural/directional, valency-changing affixes, Aktionsart suffixes) are applied in a strict order: postural/directional (slot F) before valency-changing affixes (slot C/G) before Aktionsart suffixes (slot H). Auxiliary-taking processes are normally

365 (but not always; see further below) applied next (that is after Aktionsart suffixes) and are therefore assigned to slots as well (slots B, I and J).

Auxiliary-taking process applied after postural/directional suffixes (slot F) are

applied are cross-referenced in (10.64):

(see also (10.31) and (10.33a))

wana-diru ju-

(escape-GO.PERM be-)

(10.55)

In a few cases, however, we find the order of application is reversed. In (10.67),

366 for example, the postural suffix -ani ‘SIT’ is applied after the full reduplication auxiliary-taking process (combined with an auxiliary alternation antipassive derivation; see §8.3.2) is applied. (If -ani had been applied first, we should have e-tse jibu-ani-jibuani ju-.)

(10.67)

IbaS =tuS

[terati=ju ju-ani-tsu] [e-tse jibu-jibu]

jaguar =3SG(-FM) beam=LOC be-SIT-SS NPF-tooth roll.up-REDUP

ju-ani-kware. be-SIT-REM.PAST
‘The jaguar was sitting on the beam and he was snarling (rolling his teeth up and down).’ ht026

In (10.56a), the verb ara- ‘eat O’ first undergoes the Ø-marked auxiliary-taking process, giving ara a- ‘eat O’, and is secondly detransitivised by the auxiliary-alternation antipassive derivation (with incorporation of its O argument jae ‘fish’), giving by jae ara ju- (fish eat be(ANTIPASS)-).
In (10.68), the incrementative Aktionsart suffixes -etibe (in (10.68a)) and -aje (in (10.68b)) are both applied after auxiliary-taking processes:
(10.68) a. Eje=keS =retseS [ijine-kara-ijine-kara] ju-etibe-wa. INT=LIG =3DL stray-DESID-REDUP-REDUP be-INCR-PERF ‘Let’s see if they (the oxen) are going to keep wanting to move out of the path (lit. stray) (as they have done all the way) (now that the oxen know we are about to arrive).’ ka528

b. … [tu-raA tupuju=dya

[mare-kara-mare-kara]

3SG-ERG FOLLOWING=FOC shoot-DESID-REDUP-REDUP

a-aje-ya=ju]… affect-INCR-IMPFV=DS
‘… as he (grandfather Navi) was chasing it (a big anteater) wanting to shoot at it, (the anteater suddenly turned around).’ na008a

367 In (10.68a), the verb ijine- ‘stray’ first takes -kara ‘DESID’, giving ijine-kara ju‘want to stray’. Full reduplication is then applied, giving ijine-kara- ijine-kara ju-. Finally, the aktionart -etibe ‘INCR’ is applied. Similarly, in (10.68b), mare- ‘shoot at O’, first takes -kara ‘DESID’, giving mare-kara a- ‘wanting to shoot at O’ and then is reduplicated giving mere-kara-mare-kara a- ‘wanting to shoot at O repeatedly’.

In both examples, the two aktionart suffixes are clearly applied after the suffix -kara ‘DESID’ is applied (otherwise they would be attached to the verb stem — i.e. we would have ijine-etibe-kara ijine-etibe-kara ju-wa and mare-aje-kara mare-aje-kara a-ya=ju respectively). However, it is not possible to state whether -etibe ‘INCR’ and -aje ‘INCR’ are applied before or after reduplication, since reduplication of a non-inflecting verb does not trigger an additional auxiliary (see §10.6).

In (10.69), the verb iji- ‘drink’ O first takes the auxiliary-taking suffix -kara ‘DESID’, giving iji-kara a- ‘want to drink O’, then takes the Aktionsart suffix -nuka ‘REITR’ as ijikara a-nuka- ‘want to drink again’. (If -nuka had been applied first, we should have had iji-nuka-iji-nuka a-.)

‘(I drunk a bottle of cod oil and found it good for my health so) now I want to drink another one (bottle).’ bc040

In (10.70), the transitive verb sabu- ‘grasp O with fingernails’ is first reduplicated, giving sabu-sabu a- ‘grasp O with fingernails repeatedly’, then takes the Aktionsart -na ‘COME.TEMP’, giving sabu-sabu a-na-. (If -na had been applied first, we would have had sabu-na-sabu-na a-.)

368 ‘(In my dream I see) tiny eagles coming and scratching me over and over again.’ hm064

In (10.71) an Aktionsart suffix is applied before and after an auxiliary-taking process is

applied:

(10.71) a. ai=kwana peta-aje

ju-aje-

INT=PL

look.at-INCR be-INCR-

grab-ALMOST-REDUP-REDUP affect-INCR-

(10.61b)

(Note that in the last example, it is the same suffix -aje ‘INCR’ that is applied twice.)

The combination of auxiliary-taking processes with other verbal categories is a fascinating topic that needs more work.

11 Predicative adjectives
A class of adjectives can be recognised in a language for underived words that (1) are different from verbs or nouns, (2) encode semantic notions such as DIMENSION, AGE, VALUE and COLOUR, (3) can function as predicate of an intransitive clause, or/and as copula complement within a copula clause and/or (4) can function as modifier to a noun in an NP (Dixon 2004).
Cavineña has two different classes of adjectives: predicative adjectives which have properties (1), (2) and (3) (but not property (4)) and attributive adjectives which have properties (1), (2) and (4) (but not property (3)).
Predicative adjectives function as copula complement within a copula clause in Cavineña (not as predicate of an intransitive clause). They are discussed at length in this chapter. Attributive adjectives are NP modifiers. They are not discussed here but in §13.2.
In section 11.1, we discuss the syntactic properties of predicative adjectives. The copula complement function is presented in §11.1.1. The use of dyake ‘very’ as a modifier to predicative adjectives is discussed in §11.1.2. In §11.1.3, we show that in order to be used attributively, predicative adjectives must be used within a relative clause. The next three sections discuss two additional functions that predicative adjectives can have: adverbial function in §11.1.4 and secondary predicate function in §11.1.5.
We need to distinguish between two subclasses of predicative adjectives in Cavineña on morphological (but not syntactic or semantic) criteria: 1 — da-adjectives consist of a closed subclass of about 110 to 120 bound roots which must take an affix (minimally a dummy suffix -da) or be reduplicated. They are listed exhaustively in appendix 1 and are discussed in §11.2;

370
2 — independent adjectives consist of an open subclass of (at least 40 to 50 basic roots) which do not require to (but can) take any affixes and are never reduplicated. Notably, they never take the -da dummy suffix. They are listed exhaustively in appendix 2 and are discussed in §11.3.
11.1. Syntax Adjectives cannot head an NP which is the main criterion to distinguish them from nouns. Adjectives cannot directly modify an NP head which is the main criterion to distinguish them from all the NP modifiers (quantifiers, number markers and attributive adjectives). Finally, adjectives cannot head the predicate which is the main criteria to distinguish them from verbs.
11.1.1. Copula complement The main function of predicative adjectives is as copula complement (CC) of a copula clause. Copula clauses have the following properties (see full discussion in §4.6.3) 1 — the copula subject (CS) is coded identically to the subject of intransitive clauses (S) and has the same syntactic properties (e.g., control of switch-reference) (but note that in the examples, for clarity, we will keep coding copula subjects as CS); 2 — the copula verb is ju- ‘be’ (homophonous with the intransitive auxiliary). The copula verb is not obligatory. Its main function is to carry verbal affixes. Speakers very often leave the copula when they do not judge necessary to express verbal categories coded by these affixes (see for example (11.1c,d)). Copula clauses used within relative clause almost always omit the copula verb (see §11.1.3); 3 — the copula complement almost always precedes the copula predicate when it is present. The copula complement can be a predicative adjective, an NP, or a PP.
Da-adjectives in CC function are illustrated in (11.1):
(11.1) a. Ari-daCC ju-kwareCP ajaCS. big-ASF be-REM.PAST monkey ‘The monkey was big.’ aj025

371

b. Baji-u-si=kwitaCC

jika-damaCC.

Biata.river bank

=3SG(-FM) untidy-NEG

‘The banks of the Biata river are very clean (lit. not untidy).’ ba022

Independent adjectives in CC function are illustrated in (11.2):

(11.2) a. PureamaCC =ekwanaCS ju-kwareCP…

happy

=1PL

be-REM.PAST

‘We were happy…’ ga008

b. PeyainimeCC ekanaCS

=3SG(-FM) be-REM.PAST rifle=PL

‘(When I was young) there weren’t rifles (but only shotguns) (lit. rifles did not exist).’ wa032

Copula clauses with adjectives (but not NPs or PPs) as CC often include a dative oblique (an oblique NP, independent or bound pronoun) which specifies an experiencer argument (i.e. an entity that experiences the property ‘predicated’ over the S argument referent). This is illustrated with various types of adjectives in (11.3) (the dative obliques are in bold face):

372

(11.3) a. Bari=ja

=tuCS

rapaCS biji-daCC.

anteater=DAT =3SG(-FM) termite nice-ASF

‘Anteaters like termites (lit. termites are nice to anteaters).’ di0246

‘I ran out of water (lit. water was not sufficient to me).’ sd013

c. ArusuCS =mi-kwe rice =2SG-DAT

jikwi-maCC? cut-RES.NEG

‘Have you never harvested (lit. cut) rice? (lit. has rice never been harvested to you?)’ tb182

11.1.2. Modifier dyake ‘very’ Adjectives can be the head of an adjective phrase when modified by the particle dyake ‘very’, as illustrated in (11.4):

(11.4) a. [Dyake kasa-da]CC _taa

ekwitaCS.

very strong-ASF =EMPH person

‘The man is very strong.’ di0789

b. [Dyake iwi-da=kwita]CC =tuCS

[chapa maju-chine=ke]CS.

very stinky-ASF=RESTR =3SG(-FM) dog die-REC.PAST=LIG

‘The dog that died (some days ago) is very stinky.’ di1493

Note that dyake does not only modify adjectives. It can also modify a verb with the meaning ‘a lot’ (§16.1).

11.1.3. Attributive function strategies Predicative adjectives (unlike attributive adjectives) cannot directly modify the head of

373 an NP in Cavineña. For this purpose predicative adjectives must be used within a copula relative clause. A full discussion of relative clauses (RC) in Cavineña is in §13.6 and Chapter 20. In a nutshell, RC in Cavineña are marked by =ke ‘LIG’. They are normally postposed to the NP head but can occasionally precede the NP head (an example is (11.6a)). In copula RC, the copula (predicate) is almost always omitted, as shown in (11.5). Omitting the copula prediate in copula RC is nevertheless not obligatory, as shown in (11.6).

11.1.4. Adverbial function An important number of adjectives from both subclasses (i.e., da-adjectives and independent adjectives) can function as manner adverbs (the complete list has not been

374 investigated). Formally, an adjective in adverbial function is one that is used with a verb different from the copula ju- ‘be’ (this would mean that it is a copula complement; see §11.1.1), which does not occur with the ligature =ke ‘LIG’ (this would mean that it is in attributive function; see §11.1.3) and which does not occur with the verb ba- ‘see, feel’ (this would mean that it is in secondary predicate function; see §11.1.5).
Semantically, an adjective in adverbial function modifies a verb. Examples showing da-adjectives in adverbial function are given in (11.7) (with intransitive verbs) and (11.8) (with transitive verbs):

‘I could not sleep in the forest because I didn’t have a mosquito net (lit. I didn’t sleep without a mosquito net).’ di2608

Some adjectives from both subclasses (the full list has not been investigated) cannot be used in adverbial function. In order to be used adverbially, these adjective require a headless copula relative clause within an associative postpositional phrase (marked by =tsewe ‘ASSOC’; §14.2).

This is illustrated with the da-adjective dyai- ‘lazy’ in (11.10). As (11.10a) shows, this adjective cannot be used adverbially. However, this becomes possible by taking =tsewe ‘ASSOC’, as in (11.10b). Since postpositions do not mark adjectives but only NPs, it should be the case that the adjective belong to an NP, i.e., in CC function within a copula RC modifying an NP head. As normally happens, the head (‘manner’) of the RC is omitted, as well as the copula predicate (ju- ‘be’) and the RC marker =ke (since it occurs in the same clitic sequence with =tsewe and precedes =tsewe).

‘(As they couldn’t find their lost child,) they (the child parents) lived (lit. sat) (the rest of their life) very sadly (lit. with a sad (manner)).’ eb033

Quite interestingly, negated da-adjectives (§11.2.4) (possibly negated independent adjectives as well; this needs to be investigated) never require the postposition =tsewe when used adverbially. Illustrative examples are given in (11.13) ((11.13b) is (T1.91)):

It is not clear why all negative adjectives (in addition to certain positive adjectives) can be used adverbially while some positive adjectives cannot. A full study of how adjectives are used adverbially remains to be undertaken.

11.1.5. Secondary predicate function
Adjectives can also occur in a construction with the verb ba- ‘see, feel’ (and possibly other verbs; see futher below) that we analyse as secondary predication. In this construction, the adjective normally precedes ba- ‘see’. The adjective is unmarked and optional, similarly as in adverbial function. Semantically, however, the adjective does not modify the verb but the O argument, as follows: the adjective refers to property of the O argument referent, as seen/felt/experienced by the A argument. In English, this construction typically translates by ‘that’ complements clauses (‘A see/feel/think that O is ADJ’) (But recall that there are no complement clauses in Cavineña.)

Any predicative adjective can potentially (although no systematic survey was conducted) occur as secondary predicate. This is notably the case for adjectives that

379 cannot be used adverbially, as with masa- ‘difficult’ and peyainime ‘sad’, shown as secondary predicates in (11.16):

(11.16) a. Masa-da =tuO

‘I see that Miguel is sad.’ n5.0207

Some adjectives which can occur as seconday predicates never occur adverbially. This is the case with abilitative adjectives (derived from verbs with -taki ‘ABIL’; §11.3.3). Examples are given in (11.17) (see more examples in (11.80):

(11.17) a. Rike-taki=ama =tuA

‘They (dl) (a grandfather and his little grandson, both not very strong) felt that they couldn’t lift it (a fish that they had caught) because it was a very big fish (so they asked for help).’ ps042

It is possible that some adjectives can occur as secondary predicates with other

380 verbs, as suggested by (11.18a) (with sikaka- ‘noisy’ and baka- ‘hear O’) and (11.18b) (with derived resultative adjective e-mutsu ‘plucked’ and be- ‘bring O’):

(11.18) a. Sikaka-da =tu-keO =ØA noisy-ASF =3SG-FM (=1SG-ERG)

baka-ya. hear-IMPFV

INT.REASON =3SG-FM =2SG(-ERG) bring-GO.TEMP-IMPFV turkey

e-mutsu-tirya? RES-pull-COMP ‘Why did you bring the turkey completely plucked (lit. pulled)?’ hm078

It is not clear whether we are dealing with the same type of construction in these examples, especially (11.18b) where the resultative adjective e-mutsu-tirya ‘completely plucked’ occurs after the verb be- ‘bring O’ (we would rather expect the adjective to precede the verb). This issue require additional study.

11.2. Da-adjectives
We can divide the morphology of da-adjectives into two types. The first type consists of morphology that is obligatorily required in order for a root to form an independent (grammatical and phonological) word (this will be called the obligatory morphology). The second type consists of morphology that is optionally added ‘on top’ of the obligatory morphology (this will be called the optional morphology).

Obligatory morphology consist of the dummy suffix -da/-u ‘ASF’ (§11.2.1), reduplication (§11.2.2), interrogative prefix eje- ‘INT’ (§11.2.3), and negative suffix -dama ‘NEG’ (§11.2.4). Optional morphology is discussed next: augmentative suffix -si (§11.2.6) and compounding (§11.2.5). The morphological structure of da-adjectives is summarised in the following diagram:

obligatory eje- ‘INT’ optional compounding

381

-da/-u

reduplication

root

-dama ‘NEG’

-si ‘AUGM’

There are no processes deriving da-adjectives from other word classes. As a result, all da-adjectives can be considered as basic. There is however an interesting phenomenon of direct conversion where many adjectives also correspond to a verb or a noun. This is discussed in §11.2.7.

11.2.1. Dummy suffix -da/-u ‘ASF’ The suffix -da/-u ‘Adjective SuFfix’ is a dummy (i.e. semantically empty) morpheme. The two variants, -da and -u are in complementary distribution.

The suffix -da is used in the following contexts: 1 — in citation form; 2 — when the adjective does not carry any other morphology, as in (11.1a) (repeated), (11.19) and (11.20):

(11.1a)

ju-chine. be-REC.PAST

‘My shirt was wet. di1103

382 The form -u is used in the following contexts: 1 — when the adjective takes the augmentative suffix -si, as in (11.21) (see more examples in §11.2.6):
(11.21) a. Uke-u-si=kwitaCC ijetiCS. hot-ASF-AUGM=RESTR sun ‘The sun is very hot.’ n1.0309

‘They were very scared to see the jaguar.’ di0213

(The forms *uke-da-si or *baji-da-si are ungrammatical.)

2 — when the adjective is modified by the phrasal particle =piji ‘DIM’ (§17.12), as in (11.22a) and (11.22b) (in (11.22b) we can see the same adjective, pude- ‘red’ used alternately with both -u (and =piji) and -da):

(11.22) a. Ju-diru-kware

ekwitaS. Baru-damaCC, juji-u=pijiCC

be-GO.PERM-REM.PAST person tall-NEG

383 ‘That papaya (tree) that we see from the distance is very nice.’ n5.0466

(With -si ‘AUGM’ or =piji, *juji-u, *pude-u and *ji-u are ungrammatical.)

Note that =piji ‘DIM’ can as well mark an adjective with -da, as shown in (11.23):

(11.23)

[YumeCC=ke ebakwapiji]CS over.there=LIC small.child

juji-da=pijiCC. fat-ASF=DIM

‘That small child over there is a bit fat.’ n5.0458

It is not clear whether there is a difference in meaning between juji-u=piji (as in (11.22a)) and juji-da=piji as in (11.23). If there was one, this would mean that -da and -u are different morphemes (and not two variants of a single dummy morpheme). This issue needs to be investigated.

11.2.2. Reduplication
Full reduplication of a da-adjective root is yet another morphological process that yields a complete grammatical word (although two phonological words). Reduplication, unlike the -da/-u suffix (which is semantically empty), adds an aspectual distributive sense to the property encoded by the adjective. Strictly speaking, reduplication encodes the fact that the state is distributed in space or time. In some cases, the distributive sense is somehow blurred and reduplication acquires a mere attenuating sense, meaning ‘more or less’ or ‘approximately’.

In (11.24) (from the dictionary), the firefly’s twinkling light is described by reduplicating the adjective weka- ‘shiny’:

(11.24)

UmajapurariCS =tuCS

meta weka-wekaCC ju-ya.

firefly

=3SG(-FM) by.night shiny-REDUP be-IMPFV

‘The firefly twinkles at night.’ di2908

In (11.25) (from dictionary), the speaker describes a shirt that got wet. The Spanish

384 translation given is ‘half wet, more or less humid’ (Spanish medio húmedo). But what he presumably rather describes is the fact that the shirt is wet in different places:

rara-ya.

difficult-NEG =3SG(-FM) dry-IMPFV

‘It (your shirt) is just a bit wet (lit. has little wet spots). It will dry easily.’ di1104

A sky with clouds in various parts can be described by reduplicating apu- ‘dark’ as in (11.26):

(11.26)

Apu-apuCC dark-REDUP

=tuCS

barepaCS.

=3SG(-FM) sky.weather

‘The sky has clouds in various parts.’ di0112

In (11.27), reduplication of the adjective ari- ‘big’ carries the incremental sense of ‘growing’:

(11.27)

Amena ari-ariCC =ekwanaCS ju-kware.

FILL big-REDUP =1PL

be-REM.PAST

‘We (me and my brothers) grew up (lit. grew up a little bit many times).’ nk027

In some cases, a reduplicated da-adjective only has an attenuating (not distributive) sense. Emerenciano Sepa explained to me that the eggs of the ‘waparikwama’ partridge have a uniform reddish colour. Still, they are described by reduplicating pude- ‘red, brown’, as in (11.28) (from the dictionary):

(11.28)

[Waparikwama=ja e-ka]CS =tuCS

pude-pude=jipeneeCC.

partridge(sp.)=GEN NPF-egg =3SG(-FM) red-REDUP=ALMOST

‘The eggs of the ‘waparikwama’ partridge are almost reddish.’ di1378

385 A few examples are available of full reduplication of a da-adjective root together with its dummy suffix -da (not -u). This occurs with ji- ‘good’, japa- ‘far’, juji‘fat’ and ba- ‘cold’. Full reduplication of ba- ‘cold’ together with -da is illustrated in (11.29b) which is a reply from Julio Mayo to my greeting (in (11.29a)),1 one (fresh) morning in Galilea:

(11.29) a Eje-ji-u

=mi-keCS?

INT-good-PROP =2SG-FM

A: ‘How are you (lit. how good are you)?’

b. Ji-daCC! good-ASF

Ba-da-ba-da=piji=kamadyaCC. cold-ASF-REDUP-REDUP=DIM=ONLY

‘I’m fine (lit. good). (I am/It is) just a little bit cold.’ n5.0523

In this example, the adjective ba- ‘cold’ is given an attenuative meaning. But this meaning could as well be an effect of the particle =piji ‘DIM’. Reduplication of a da-adjective with the suffix -da requires more study.

11.2.3. Interrogative prefix eje- ‘INT’

Da-adjective roots can take an interrogative prefix eje- ‘INTerrogative’ and form an

independent grammatical word. The prefix eje- is used to question the degree of the

quality described by the adjective. We unfortunately have only few examples.

Adjectives found with eje- are exhaustively listed in (11.30):

(11.30) eje-ari

‘how big’

eje-kasa

‘how strong’

eje-baru ‘how tall’

eje-kini

‘how wide’

eje-bikwe ‘how heavy’

eje-tsunu

‘how long, when’

eje-de-u ‘how deep’

eje-uke

‘how hot’

eje-japa ‘how far’

eje-uma

‘how many’

eje-ji-u

‘how good’

eje-uu

‘how tasty’

eje-junu ‘how long’

1 This is the standard way of greeting in Cavineña.

386 Note that an -u suffix is added to the mono-syllabic adjective roots ji- ‘good’ and de- ‘deep’. The fact that this suffix is not used with poly-syllabic roots suggests that it is the same proparaleptic suffix that is added to mono-syllabic verbal roots when they do not take affixes (§2.7.6) (as opposed to the -u variant of the dummy suffix -da/-u discussed in §11.2.1). However, note that with verbs, the proparaleptic vowel u is only added to bare (mono-syllabic) roots (allowing these roots to conform the two syllable requirement for a phonological word), while in the case of ji- and de-, there is the presence of a prefix. This could be an indication that eje is a separate phonological word (rather than a prefix). More work is needed to verify this hypothesis.

The prefix eje- ‘INT’ is first illustrated with a conversational turn in (11.31) (volunteered by Emerenciano Sepa) (see a similar conversational turn showing the interrogative prefix on ji- ‘good’ in (11.29)):

(11.31) A: Eje-uuCC INT-tasty

=riCS

earakiCS?

=3PROX.SG(-FM) food

B: Uu-daCC. tasty-ASF

‘How tasty is the food?’ B: ‘It’s delicious’ n5. p91

Additional examples showing adjectives with the interrogative prefix are given in (11.32):

(11.32) a. Eje-baruCC ju-wa

INT-tall

be-PERF

mesaCS? table

b. Re-eke eje-japaCC ekanaCS?

here-PERL INT-far

3PL

‘How far are they from here.’ di1019

In (11.33), we illustrate an interrogative adjective in adverbial function:

(11.33)

Eje-tsunu INT-long.time

diru-ya mani=ju?

=2SG(-FM) go-IMPFV rubber.center=LOC

‘How long are you going to the (rubber) center for? di1027

387

The interrogative prefix eje- can have an indefinite meaning (as any interrogative morpheme in Cavineña; §4.5.4). This is illustrated in (11.34) (see also (11.36a-b)).

11.2.4. Negative suffix -dama ‘NEG’ Da-adjective roots can take a negative suffix -dama ‘NEG’ and form an independent grammatical word. This is illustrated in (11.35):
(11.35) a. I-keCS =bakwe ji-damaCC ju-wa… 1SG-FM =CONTR good-NEG be-PERF ‘I am not (feeling) well (lit. good) (because my stomach is swelling).’ lv031

b. EtsubajuCS, tume=keCS =tuCS

bikwe-damaCC.

toasted.corn thereCC=LIG =3SG(-FM) heavy-NEG

‘Toasted corn, that is not heavy.’ hs033

c. Jipake =taa [peya kistiano=kwana]CS japa-damaCC ju-chine.

LUCKILY =EMPH other people=PL

far-NEG

be-REC.PAST

‘Luckily, there were other people nearby (lit. other people were not far).’ mo029

(See also jika-dama ‘clean, not untidy’ in (11.1d) and baru-dama ‘short, not tall’ in (11.22a).)

Note that -dama is most likely related to -da ‘ASF’ (§11.2.1) (they indeed occupy the same slot in the adjective structure) and the phrasal particle =ama ‘NEG’ (§17.10) (minus the first vowel a).

One could analyse -ma as a (negative) suffix distinct from -da. Note that -ma is very

388 similar to the negative particle =ama (suggesting that they are historically related). Note also that ma is also part of the negative auxiliary-taking verbal suffixes -karama ‘DESID.NEG’ (with positive counterpart -kara; §10.1.1) and -jakama ‘CEASELESSLY’ (this suffix does not have a positive countrepart; §10.1.3). We nevertheless preferred treating -dama as a unitary suffix because: 1 — ma does not occur independently from -da (at least in the context of adjective); 2 — nothing can occur between da and ma.

Note that it is still possible to negate a predicative adjective with the phrasal particle =ama ‘NEG’ (§17.10). As such, the adjective needs to be ‘complete’ (i.e., it needs to include an obligatory affix or be reduplicated). This is illustrated with interrogative prefix eje- as in (11.36a) and reduplicated in (11.36b):

(11.36) a. Yume

=tukwe

over.there =COUNT.EVID

eje-japa=ama=kwita=dyaCC e-tareCS. INT-far=NEG=RESTR=FOC NPF-house

‘It turned out that the house wasn’t any far.’ sd109

b. Jadya=tibu=dya =ni =tu-keCS =ekwana-ja kasa-kasa=amaCC thus=REASON=FOC =MAYBE =3SG(-FM) =1PL-DAT strong-REDUP=NEG
ju-jara-ya. be-ADVERS-IMPFV ‘Maybe this is why ours (the corn beer that we do nowadays) is not any strong.’ ci172

An adjective that includes -da cannot be negated by =ama, unless =ama has scope over a particle that already marks the adjective, as with =kwita ‘RESTR’ in (11.37) (the adjective is in adverbial function):

(11.37)

Are =pa =miS

ji-da=kwita=ama

tawi-nuka-wa

POLAR =REP =2SG(-FM) good-ASF=RESTR=NEG sleep-REITR-PERF

Hermano? brother ‘I’ve heard that you didn’t sleep all that well again (last night), Brother, is

389 that true?’ ci013
There are no cases where =ama negates and adjective already negated with -dama (i.e., ADJ-dama=ama) but this might be a possible combination.
11.2.5. Compounding A predicative da-adjective can form a compound with a noun or a verb. In these compounds, the adjective is the head (the compound is still an adjective, not a noun or a verb), it comes last, and still requires the obligatory morphology to form a complete grammatical word (normally the dummy suffix -da/-u).
A compounded noun must be an e-noun (i.e. a noun which requires an e- prefix formative and which normally codes the part of an entity; see §12.3.1) (it cannot be an independent noun or a kinship noun). The complex adjective has a more specific scope of reference, delimited by the part encoded by the compounded noun (roughly like equivalent English compounds big-nosed, long-legged, etc.). The full list of compounds involving nouns attested in the data is given in (11.38) (nouns and adjectives which occur more than once are in bold face):

A compounded verb can be of any type (inflecting or non-inflecting, intransitive or transitive). The complex adjective has a more specific scope of reference delimited by the type of activity it is associated with. It is quite likely that verb compounding with predicative adjectives is a reflection of the fact that adjectives can have adverbial (rather than copula complement) functions (§11.1.4). It can be observed that a complex adjective containing a verb is very similar in meaning to the same verb modified by the same adjective in adverbial function. This can be illustrated with the adjective -jebu ‘strong(noise)’ and verb kike- ‘sing, shout’ in (11.39a) (complex adjective) and (11.39b) (adjective in adverbial function):

(11.39) a. Kike-jebu-daCC =tuCS shout-strong-ASF =3SG(-FM)

Morpho-syntactic properties of noun-adjective compounds and verb-adjective compounds are as follows:
2 This refers to the activity of chewing coca leaves.

392 1 — the resulting complex adjective requires obligatory morphology (either -da/-u ‘ASF’, a reduplicated form, or -dama ‘NEG’ — no example could be found with interrogative prefix eje- but this combination is logically possible). Examples are given in (11.44) (with nouns), (11.39b) (repeated), and (11.45) (with a verb);

(11.44) a. AjabanaCS =tuCS

(See also kati-uje-da ‘sting painfully’ in (11.40b).)
2 — the noun/verb root occur immediately before the adjective. Nothing can occur in between;
3 — the e- prefix of a compounded e-noun is obligatorily omitted (as expected when e-nouns enter derivational processes; see §12.3.1);

393 4 — the affixes (either inflectional or non-inflectional) of a compounded verb are obligatorily omitted. However, it appears that a reduplicated verb (with antipassive meaning; §8.3.1) can be compounded (as shown by kuru-kuru-ari- ‘chewing a lot’ from kuru- ‘chew O’). Note that the verb pa- ‘cry’ is compounded with an additional vowel a which is not predictable (there are no identified processes in Cavineña of addition of a vowel a — although there is a process of addition of a vowel u; §2.7.6 — or processes of vowel lengthening);

5 — in one case, two e-nouns (-bi ‘arm’ and -tsaru ‘hair’) are compounded together with an adjective (with one noun as a juxtaposed modifier to the other; this corresponds to the NP juxtaposition structure; see §13.1);

‘The man has a lot of hair on his arms.’ di0849

6 — The O of a transitive verb can be included as a preposed modifier, as in (11.47):

11.2.6. Augmentative -si ‘AUGM’ Intensification of the property encoded by a da-adjective (as well as an independent adjective; see §11.3) can be achieved morphologically with the augmentative suffix -si ‘AUGM’. (Note that there are other ways to intensify the property denoted by an adjective. This can be done periphrastically with the modifier particle dyake ‘very’ (see §11.1.2) or with phrasal particles such as =kwita ‘RESTR’ (see §17.5) or =ebari ‘INTENS’ (see §17.13) (note that none of these intensifier morphemes are restricted to adjectives).
In order for the augmentative suffix -si to be used, the adjective requires either the -u form of the dummy suffix -da/-u ‘ASF’, the negative suffix -dama ‘NEG’, or a reduplicated root. The suffix -si cannot apply on a bare root, a root + -da, or a root with

394 the interrogative prefix eje-.

In (11.48) and (11.49), we illustrate the augmentative suffix -si on adjectives with the dummy suffix -u:

(11.48) a. KaniseCS =tuCS

ji-u-siCC

(*ji-si)

peanut =3SG(-FM) good-ASF-AUGM

‘Peanuts are very good to eat.’ di0463

ara=ishu. eat=PURP.GNL

b. Japa-u-siCC (*japa-si) =dyadi

e-majaka=kwanaCS.

far-ASF-AUGM

=STRG.EMPH NPF-space=PL

‘(I don’t want to go visit my mother becauce) the place (where she lives) is too far.’ pf016

Example (11.49) comes from a conversational turn between Antonio Yubanera (A) and Cosme Mayo (V) discussing Cavineña traditional canoes that could carry up to six persons:

(11.49) A: Jejee! [Shukuta ekwita ani-ya=ke]CS tuwaCC.

Yes! six

person sit-IMPFV=LIG there

‘Six person could sit there (in that canoe) (lit. six person sitting were there).’ ab203

V: Pa! Kasa-u-si! INTERJ strong-ASF-AUGM

(*kasa-si)

‘Wow! That’s very strong!’ ab203

In one case, with the adjective uu- ‘tasty’, the suffix -si appears to occur directly on the root without the use of the dummy suffix -u, giving the form uusi (not the otherwise expected *uuusi). Most probably this exception can be explained by the fact that a sequence of three u vowels is avoided.
In the texts available, the augmentative suffix is not found occurring on a negated

395 adjective (i.e., an adjective with -dama). However, example (11.50), volunteered by Emerenciano Sepa, suggests that this is an acceptable combination:

(11.50)

Tseri-dama-siCC =tuCS

ju-chine

fat-NEG-AUGM =3SG(-FM) be-REC.PAST

awadaCS. tapir

‘They tapir (that I killed) was very skinny (lit. very not fat).’ n5.0569

The suffix -si is also attested on complex (i.e. compounded) adjectives, as in (11.51):

(11.51)

Dutya=raA =tu-keO =ekwanaA adeba-ya

all=ERG =3SG-FM =1PL

know-IMPFV

[aja

ari-da=ke bi-baru-u-si=kwana=ke]O.

capuchin.monkey big-ASF=LIG arm-tall-ASF-AUGM=PL=LIG

‘We all know capuchin monkeys which are big, with very long arms (lit. tall-armed).’ aj046-047

The augmentative suffix -si is also attested on reduplicated da-adjective roots as in (11.44c), from a recorded conversation, (repeated):3
(11.44c) Piti-pude-pude-siCC! neck-red-REDUP-AUGM ‘He has the neck very red (lit. very red-necked ).’ tb042

It was mentioned that dyake ‘very’ and the phrasal particles =ebari ‘INTENS’ and =kwita ‘RESTR’ are also used to intensify the property denoted by an attributive adjective. For some reason (it is not know why), dyake never co-occurs with -si ‘AUGM’. The phrasal particles, on the other hands, are often used ‘on top’ the augmentative suffix -si ‘AUGM’ to further intensify the meaning, as in (11.21) (with =kwita) (repeated) and (11.52) (with =ebari):
(11.21) a. Uke-u-si=kwitaCC ijetiCS. hot-ASF-AUGM=RESTR sun
3 Note that the first adjective of the utterance is further compounded with the noun -piti ‘neck’.

11.2.7. Direct conversion
The subclass of da-adjectives is closed to both borrowing and internal derivation. There is however an very interesting phenomenon of direct conversion between the da-adjectives and the classes of nouns and verbs.

About 45-50 da-adjectives have a corresponding noun. In many cases, it is an e-noun

(as in (11.53)) or an independent noun with an abstract meaning (as in (11.54)) (the lists

are not exhaustive):

(11.53) tiki-

‘shiny’

-tiki

‘fire’

tsau-

‘with many bones/thorns’ -tsau

‘bone’

tseri-

‘fat’

-tseri

‘grease, fat’

patse-

‘bitter’

-patse

‘bile’

nime-

‘shy’

-nime

‘mind’

(11.54) kasaiyuwebaruaribikweukebiji-

‘strong’ ‘lovely’ ‘tall’ ‘big’ ‘heavy’ ‘hot’ ‘pleasant, nice’

kasa iyuwe baru ari bikwe uke biji

‘strength’ ‘love’ ‘height’ ‘size’ ‘weight’ ‘heat’ ‘will’

A few more da-adjectives have a corresponding independent noun referring to entities created/produced by some other entity. Some of these equivalences are shown in (11.55) (the list is not exhaustive):

(11.55) wajawiniwani-

‘sweet’ ‘muddy’ ‘stinking’

397

waja

‘honey (also bee)’

wini

‘wax’

wani

‘smell’

The da-adjective rami- ‘fleshy’ and its corresponding e-noun -rami ‘flesh, meat’ are illustrated in (11.56):
(11.56) a. Rami-daCC =tu-keCS. fleshy-ASF =3SG-FM ‘It (the dove bird) is fleshy.’4 tb179

b. Bajeje-kware =tunaA [tu-ja e-rami]O cebolla=kwana=tsewe. prepare-REM.PAST =3PL 3SG.GEN NPF-flesh onion=PL=ASSOC
‘They prepared its (cayman) meat (lit. flesh) with onions.’ lg037

The da-adjective madi- ‘milky’ and its corresponding e-noun -madi ‘milk’ are illustrated in (11.57):

(11.57) a. WakarareCS =tuCS bellaco.tree =3SG(-FM)

madi-daCC. milky-ASF

‘The ‘bellaco’ tree is milky.’ di1346

tachacá fish=DAT =3SG(-FM) sit-IMPFV NPF-milk

‘The tachacá fish has milk (lit. milk sits to the tachacá fish).’ di0730

Another 25-30 da-adjectives have a corresponding verb. These verbs do not have any transitivity restrictions. They come from either the intransitive (as in (11.58)) or the transitive classes (as in (11.59)) (the lists are not exhaustive):

4 Note that this example (which comes from a conversation) is a joke. The bird referred to is on the contrary very skinny.

(11.58) jijiurawenana-

(11.59) pudejawapupipukakajemi-

398 ‘sting’ ‘dry’ ‘get nervous’

pudejawapupipukakajemi-

‘paint O red’ ‘paint O yellow’ ‘clean O’ ‘make O round’ ‘grate O’

The da-adjective mure- ‘bold’ and its corresponding intransitive verbs mure- ‘become bold’ are illustrated in (11.60):

(11.60) a. Tu-keCS =tuCS

ju-kware

The da-adjectives kweru- ‘sharp’ and its corresponding transitive verb kweru- ‘make O pointed’ are illustrated in (11.61):

(11.61) a. Kweru-ya

=tu-keO =ØO

akwiO.

make.pointed-IMPFV =3SG-FM (=1SG-ERG) tree

b. Kweru-da=kwitaCC =tuCS

kuchiruCS.

sharp-ASF=RESTR =3SG(-FM) machete

‘The machete is quite sharp.’ di0640

399 In the view of the fact that so many da-adjectives have a corresponding noun or verb, one could be tempted to suggest either a zero derivation process that would yield new da-adjectives from the noun or verb classes. Or one could analyse the dummy suffix -da/-u (or other obligatory morphology) as a derivational process and say that there is no class of da-adjectives per se in Cavineña, i.e., all the da-adjectives are derived from the classes of nouns or verbs (by one of the obligatory affixes — i.e., -da/u ‘ASF’, -dama ‘NEG’, eje- ‘INT’, or reduplication).
We prefer to avoid either of these analyses, at least from a synchronic perspective, for the following reasons: 1 — one cannot make a da-adjective out of any noun or any verb, even when the semantics would seem compatible. For example, the e-noun -rami ‘flesh’ has a corresponding da-adjective, rami- ‘fleshy’, but not the semantically close -tsaru ‘hair’ (there is an adjective meaning ‘hairy’ but it is an independent adjective (tsaru-tsaru; this adjective is derived by full reduplication; §11.3.2). And similarly for verbs, the transitive verb jemi- ‘grate (soft material)’ has a corresponding da-adjective jemi‘powder-like’, but the semantically close transitive verb jere- ‘grate (hard material)’ does not; 2 — even though there are some semantic regularities between the pairs (a number of adjectives can be glossed as ‘having a lot of N’ as with rami- ‘fleshy, having a lot of flesh’ or tsau- ‘having a lot of bones’), this is not enough to fully predict the meaning of any adjective from a corresponding noun or verb. For example, the adjective tiki‘shiny’ cannot be glossed as ‘having a lot of fire’ and would rather require a different formula such as ‘being like N’. And with an adjective like atuka- ‘lucky’ and the corresponding noun -atuka ‘eye’, the meaning of the combination is not at all predictable.
The phenomenon of correspondences between da-adjective and nouns and verbs is thus better analysed, at least synchronically, in terms of idiosyncratic direct conversion from class to class rather in terms of a derivation process. Note that this is a very frequent phenomenon in many languages. (See Evans and Osada 2002 for a discussion of this phenomenon in Mundari.)

400 11.3. Independent adjectives
Independent adjectives have the following morpho-syntactic properties: 1 — independent adjective are bare roots that form independent grammatical words without the recourse to obligatory morphology. They never take -da/-u ‘ASF’, -dama ‘NEG’ (but are negated with the phrasal negative particle =ama, as in (11.62)) and eje‘INT’, and are never compounded with a noun or a verb;

(11.62) a. E-naS

=e-kwe tupu=amaCC

NPF-water =1SG-DAT sufficient=NEG

ju-kware. be-REM.PAST

‘I ran out of water (lit. water was not sufficient to me).’ sd013

b. Amena, eje=ja

=ni

ebakwaCS yukeneri=amaCC

FILL INT(=LIG)=DAT =MAYBE child intelligent=NEG

ju-ya. be-IMPFV
‘Their child could be (born) stupid (lit. a child could be not intelligent to any of them).’ bn030

2 — independent adjective can take the augmentative suffix -si ‘AUGM’, as shown in (11.63):

(11.63) a. Peyainime-siCC =mi-keCS,

sad-AUGM

=2SG-FM

Hermano! Ejebuchajuatsu?

brother

INT:REASON

‘You are very sad, Brother! Why?’ n5.0574

b. Isawe-si =shana =tu-keCS. deaf-AUGM =PITY =3SG-FM
‘He is very deaf, the poor guy.’ n5.0585

3 — independent adjectives can be reduplicated. However, we have very few examples, and with contradictory meanings. In (11.74a), full reduplication an attenuative meaning with chacha ‘alive’ which in (11.74b), full reduplication has an intensifying meaning with esiri ‘old’:

401

(11.64) a. Chacha-chacha=piji=jari ju-kware

[tume=ke ura].

alive-REDUP=DIM=STILL be-REM.PAST there=LIG hour

‘It (the deer that I had shot) was still a little bit alive at that time (so I had to shoot at it again).’ sl046

b. [Umae esiri-esiriCC=kwana=ke]S =pa =ekana

=REP =3PL

tawi-neri-ya=ama=dya. sleep-ALMOST-IMPFV=NEG=FOC ‘A few of the very old (people) almost did not sleep.’ cc013

(Note that independent adjectives are also derived by reduplication from nouns or verbs; §11.3.2.)
4 — independent adjectives are an open class. They can be derived from other word classes by the following processes: adjectivisation of nouns by -ki ‘WITH’ and -ma ‘WITHOUT’ (§11.3.1), adjectivisation of nouns by full reduplication (§11.3.2), adjectivisation of verbs by -taki ‘ABIL’ (§11.3.3), adjectivisation of verbs by e- ‘RES’ and -ma ‘RES.NEG’ (§11.3.4). A few additional non-productive derivational processes are discussed in §11.3.5.
11.3.1. Adjectivisation of nouns by -ki ‘WITH’ and -ma ‘WITHOUT’ The suffixes -ki ‘WITH’ and -ma ‘WITHOUT’ are used to derive PHYSICAL PROPERTY adjectives from nouns. These adjectives encode the property of possessing (with -ki) or (explicitly) not possessing (with -ma) the entity denoted by the noun they are derived from, as illustrated in (11.65) and (11.66):
(11.65) a. Kamisa-kiCC ju-ya. shirt-WITH be-IMPFV ‘He has a shirt.’

402 b. Kamisa-maCC ju-ya.
shirt-WITHOUT be-IMPFV
‘He doesn’t have a shirt.’ n4.0212

(11.66) a. Chipiru-kiCC =tuCS

money-WITH =3SG(-FM) white.man

‘The white man is rich (lit. is with money).’ di0697

b. Jipakwana =ekwanaCS SEEMINGLY.NOT =1PL

radio-kiCC radio-WITH

ju-ya. be-IMPFV

‘It looks like we won’t have the radio transmitter!’ tb087

Note that Cavineña does not have any verb ‘to have’. The derivation of these adjectives and their use in copula clauses is one way to encode possession at the clause level. (Another way is through the use of dative postpositional phrases with the locative use of the copula verb ju- ‘be’ or postural verbs such as ani- ‘sit’, neti- ‘stand’, etc.; see §14.3.1.)

Adjectivisation of nouns with -ki ‘WITH’ and -ma ‘WITHOUT’ is probably fully productive. The process can potentially be applied to any type of nouns: e-nouns, kinship nouns (at least attested with wane ‘wife’ and awe ‘husband’) and independent nouns. The process is very frequently applied to borrowed terms (which are independent nouns) such as kamisa ‘shirt’ (from Spanish camisa) in (11.65) and radio ‘(shortwave) radio transmitter’ (from Spanish radio) in (11.66b).

E-nouns taking -ki ‘WITH’ and -ma ‘WITHOUT’ occur without their e-prefix, as shown in (11.67):

(11.67) a. TumeCC=ke=dyaCS =tuCS

there=LIG=FOC

ji-daCC, tsau-maCC.

serepapa.fish =3SG(-FM) good-ASF bone-WITHOUT

‘The serepapa fish is good, boneless.’ di0308

The two kinship nouns wane ‘wife’ and awe ‘husband’ (and possibly other kinhip nouns as well, but this needs to be investigated) can take -ki ‘WITH’ and -ma ‘WITHOUT’. As such, they occur without their possessor inflections, as illustrated in (11.68) (with wane ‘wife’) and (11.69) (with awe ‘husband’):

(11.68) a. Tu-keja=dya

wane-kiCC ju-diru-kware.

‘(I was single but) the others (women) were married (lit. were with a husband).’ nk060

We have shown that -ki ‘WITH’ and -ma ‘WITHOUT’ apply to bare roots (i.e., without any affixes). However, in a few examples, they appear to be applied to full NPs. In other words, the noun comes with a (NP) modifier, such as a demonstrative (copula) relative clause (slot A of NP structure; §13.6) in (11.70a), an attributive adjective (slot F; §13.2) in (11.70b) (in secondary predicate function):

[mutiru ebariF-ki], baru-dama.

hat

big-WITH big-NEG

‘He saw something which was like a man, with a big hat and short.’ du012

More work is needed to know the extent to which -ki ‘WITH’ and -ma ‘WITHOUT’ can apply to a full NP as opposed to a bare root.

The suffixes -ki and -ma are lexicalised in a number of adjectives. The suffix -ki is lexicalised in nijuki ‘drunk’, from -niju ‘heart’ (lit. with heart). The suffix -ma is lexicalised in the adjective nimema ‘without fear’ from -nime ‘mind’ (lit. without mind).

The two adjectives dameki ‘lucky’ and maki ‘pregnant’ which both end with ki, and the adjective mema ‘empty’, which ends with ma, are possibly derived from nouns, although the putative nouns cannot be identified synchronically. Historical and comparative work is needed to determine if such nouns could have existed at earlier stages of the language.

There is finally a very surprising use of (presumably — but not necessarily) the same adjectiviser suffix -ki (but not -ma) which is found attached (and lexicalised) to the associative postposition =tsewe ‘ASSOC’ (§14.2) or associative independent pronoun (such as ea-tsewe ‘with me’, mia-tsewe ‘with you’, etc.’ §15.1). The resulting forms behave like complex independent ‘adjectives’ meaning ‘sibling of X’ (X being the referent of the NP argument of the associative postposition or the referent of the independent pronoun). These adjectives are only found used within RC (similarly to demonstratives and interrogative RCs; see §13.6.2). This is illustrated in (11.71) (with an associative PP) and (11.72) (with associative pronouns):

Note that the relative clause marker =ke ‘LIG’ does not show up when it occurs in the same clitic sequence with the ergative postposition and precedes it as in (11.72c) (as expected; see §13.6.1 and §20.2.1).

11.3.2. Adjectivisation of nouns by full reduplication
A few independent adjectives encoding PHYSICAL PROPERTIES are derived by full reduplication of a noun. Their meaning is ‘having a lot of/many N’. Adjectivisation of nouns by full reduplication might not be a productive process. It is only found with ten nouns, as listed in (11.73a) (derived from e-nouns) and (11.73b) (derived from independent nouns):

(11.73) a. nawa-nawa tiri-tiri tsaru-tsaru kwija-kwija

‘with a lot of down’

<- -nawa

‘with many roots’

<- -tiri

‘with a lot of hair’

<- -tsaru

‘with many thorns/(fish)bones’ <- -kwija

406 ‘down’ ‘root’ ‘hair’ ‘thorn’

b. kani-kani ‘with many holes’ kwesa-kwesa ‘with a lot of beard’ buje-buje ‘with a lot of stains/cloudy’ benu-benu ‘twisted’ chipi-chipi ‘with many marks’ chiwe-chiwe ‘with many chiggers’

<- kani <- kwesa <- buje <- benu <- chipi <- chiwe

‘hole’ ‘beard’ ‘stain’ ‘turn’ ‘mark’ ‘chigger’5

The six fully reduplicated adjectives in (11.74) may have been derived by full

reduplication from a noun but no base (from which they could have been derived) can

be identified (at least synchronically):

(11.74) chacha

‘alive’

kwerekwere ‘striped’

jibijibi

‘wrinkled’

purapura ‘with many points’

jurijuri

‘striped’

putaputa ‘stained’

There is one adjective, achacha/ashasha ‘small’ for which only the last syllable is reduplicated. However, Camp and Liccardi’s (1989) dictionary gives this adjective in a fully reduplicated form — i.e., ashaasha/achaacha. Although we never heard this adjective pronounced this way, this might nevertheless have been the case for Camp and Liccardi 20 years ago. Note that a fully reduplicated form for this adjective creates a sequence of two vowels a which (although not a rule in Cavineña) might well have collapsed in fast speech for ease of pronounciation, and then have become the standard form.

11.3.3. Adjectivisation of verbs by -taki ‘ABIL’ The suffix -taki ‘ABILitative’ is used to derive independent abilitative adjectives from verbs. The derived adjective has essentially two meanings: (1) ‘can/be able to V’ (as in (11.75a)) and (2) ‘must V’ (as in (11.75b)). Which specific meaning is intended in
5 Tiny worms that develop under the skin of people or animals.

407 particular clause is understood from the context:

‘If someone hunts in an unknown (lit. unseen) forest, he must (*can) stay on the beaten track (lit. go with a path) (lest he will get lost).’ di0883

It will be noted that abilitative adjectives are very often negated (as in (11.75a) (but this is not obligatory — as in (11.75b)). As such they take the particle =ama ‘NEG’ (i.e., there are no specific abilitative negative suffix).
Adjectivisation with -taki ‘ABIL’ is probably fully productive. It can be applied to any type of verbs: intransitive or transitive, inflecting or non-inflecting verbs.
Abilitative adjectives derived from intransitive inflecting verbs are illustrated in (11.76) (in addition to those shown in (11.75)):
(11.76) a. Neti-tsura-taki=ama=dyaCC ju-ya [ushuri, ushuri=tibu]. stand-GO.UP-ABIL=NEG=FOC be-IMPFV skinny skinny since ‘She (a female dog) could not stand up because she was (too) weak (lit. skinny).’ tg012

Copula clauses with abilitative adjectives derived from transitive verbs often express the original transitive subject (i.e., original A argument) by a(n oblique) dative constituent: dative bound pronoun, as in (11.77b), dative independent pronoun, as in (11.77c), or dative NP, as in (11.77d). However, this is never obligatory, as in (11.77a).
Abilitative adjective derived from non-inflecting verbs are illustrated in (11.78a) (from

409 intransitive verb) and (11.78b) (from transitive verb):

(11.78) a. [[Nei wiri]S ju-ya=ju] =tuCS

A verb that takes -taki ‘ABIL’ cannot carry any inflectional suffixes. However, it can potentially carry any non-inflectional affixes. This can be seen with the directional -tsura ‘GO.UP’ in (11.76a), the reflexive k(a)-…-ti ‘REF’ in (11.79a), an the Aktionsart -neri ‘ALMOST’ in (11.79b):

Abilitative adjectives (especially those derived from transitive verbs) are very often used in secondary predicate (with ba- ‘see’) function (§11.1.5). This allows the speaker to code the fact that the ability/non-ability of a participant (in O function) to

410 perform a verb event is viewed from the perspective/eyes/feelings of another participant (in A function) (as opposed to beeing viewed from the perspective of the speaker when abilitative adjectives are used as CC). Examples of abilitative adjectives in secondary predicate function are given in (11.80a) (derived from a transitive verbs) and (11.80b) (derived from an intransitive verb):

Two abilitative adjectives have been found with a lexicalised idiosyncratic meaning. The first is batakiama ‘missing’ which comes from ba- ‘see’, the suffix -taki ‘ABIL’ and the negative particle =ama (lit. ‘cannot/musn’t be seen’). It is illustrated in (11.81a) below. The second is kwejataki ‘leave alone’ comes from kweja- ‘inform’ (lit. ‘can tell’). It is illustrated in (11.81b).

Abilitative adjectives are only derived from verbs. The abilitative suffix -taki ‘ABIL’ cannot attach to other word classes. But quite interestingly, in one example, it is found attached to the copula predicate (which is a verb) ju- ‘be’ with the (resultative

411 derived) adjective nawi-ma as copula complement (see resultative adjectives in 11.3.4), as in (11.82):

11.3.4. Adjectivisation of verbs by e- ‘RES’ and -ma ‘RES.NEG’
The prefix e- ‘RESultative’ and the suffix -ma ‘RESultative NEGative’ are used to derive independent resultative adjectives from any types of verbs (inflecting or noninflecting, intransitive or transitive). An adjective derived by the prefix e- ‘RES’ has a positive value. It codes a state that results from the occurrence of the event coded by the verb the adjective is derived from, as illustrated in (11.83a) (based on an intransitive verb) and (11.83b) (based on a transitive verb):
(11.83) a. Tudya amena jaeCS amena e-kastereCC ju-kware. then FILL fish FILL RES-get.tired be-REM.PAST

‘Have you (ever) seen (that type of shoes) (lit. has it been seen to you)?’ tb092

An adjective derived by the prefix -ma ‘RES.NEG’ has a negative value. It codes a state that results from the non-occurrence of the event coded by the verb the adjective is derived from, as in (11.84a) (based on an intransitive verb) and (11.84b) (based on a transitive verb):

‘(As were progressing through the forest, searching for the people from Baqueti,) we saw a path that had been cut.’ vb038

A verb that takes a resultative affix cannot carry any inflectional suffixes. However, it can carry a non-inflectional affix. This can be seen with the Aktionsart suffix -ti ‘GO.TEMP’ in (11.86a) and reflexive k(a)-…-ti ‘REF’ in (11.88) (this is (T1.75):

(11.88)

‘I also talked to the (other) ones who had gathered (lit. approached one another) there.’

A number of independent adjectives have a word initial e vowel or a word final ma syllable but no clearly recoverable based from which a derivation could have taken

414 place. These adjectives could nevertheless have been derived from resultative derivation at earlier stages of the language. This could be the case with esiri ‘old (by aging)’,6 ejitaju ‘visible’ and mema ‘empty’.

11.3.5. Miscellaneous In addition to the (overtly expressed) processes of derivation described in the preceding sections, a number of independent adjectives have been directly derived from nouns.

Such nouns and their meaning as independent stative adjectives are listed exhaustively

in (11.90) (a-examples come from e-nouns while b-examples come from independent nouns):7

(11.90) a. ewikani ju-

‘tipsy’

-wikani

‘nose’

etsurikani ju- ‘having a throat ache’ -tsurikani ‘throat’

b. baara juujeje juujera ju-

‘feverish’ ‘sick’ ‘painful’

baara ujeje ujera

‘fever’ ‘disease’ ‘pain’

It is not clear at the present stage how productive this process is, whether it applies to particular semantic fields rather than others (note that three terms are disease-like concepts: baara ‘fever’, ujeje ‘disease’ and ujera ‘pain’ with the meaning ‘having/catching the disease’), and finally how predictable is the resulting sense.

The adjective peyainime ‘sad’ is presumably a lexicalised noun phrase with the quantifier peya ‘other’ and the head noun -nime ‘mind, thought’8 (lit. other mind/thought) which was then directly derived to an adjective.

A number of independent adjectives end with the formative ama, such as pureama ‘happy’, yuama ‘bad’, aama ‘not exist’ and aijama ‘not exist at all’. They have most likely arisen from the lexicalisation of the negative phrasal particle =ama (see §17.10)

6 Perhaps derived from siri- ‘break’ (lit. broken). 7 Note that independent adjective with a corresponding e-noun includes the e- prefix. 8 This e- noun takes an irregular prefix i (instead of e-).

12 Noun phrase structure — an overview
This chapter has two goals. The first goal is to introduce the reader to the structure of the NP (§12.1). It is shown that a NP in Cavineña consists of 8 structural slots. There is one slot for the head — which must be a noun — and 7 slots for modifiers — they are: relative clause (used in two different slots), quantifier, genitive modifier, juxtaposed noun, attributive adjective and number marker.
The second goal of this chapter is a full discussion of the class of nouns (NP modifiers are fully discussed in Chapter 13). There are three subclasses of nouns distinguised by morpho-syntactic criteria: (1) e-nouns which must take a dummy prefix e- and code parts of entities (§12.3), (2) kinship nouns which are inflected for the person of their possessor (§12.4) and (3) independent nouns which do not take e- nor any possessor inflection (they encode fauna, flora, etc.) (§12.5).
Kinship nouns can be said to be inalienably possessed because for these forms, marking the possessor is obligatory. One could argue that e-nouns are inalienably possessed based on their peculiar prefix e- and the fact that they code notions (body parts, etc.) that are very often coded by inalienably possessed nouns in various languages. This analysis is refuted in §12.6.
Independent nouns do not take either the e- prefix nor possessor inflections. However, they can take a range of derivational affixes which do not occur with nouns of groups. Processes deriving independent nouns from other word classes or from other nouns are discussed in §12.7.
12.1. NP structure — overview The NP structure can be described in terms of 8 slots (from A to H), each associated with a particular type of constituent, as shown in the following slot diagram:

422 Slot A: Relative clause Slot B: Quantifier Slot C: Genitive modifier Slot D: Juxtaposed noun Slot E: Head noun Slot F: Attributive adjective Slot G: Number Slot H: Relative clause

A brief description of each slot and the elements that fill them is as follows: — slots A and H are filled by relative clauses (RCs). RCs are marked by a special enclitic =ke ‘LIG’ that attaches to the last phonological word of the RC. Verbal RCs tend to be postposed to the NP head in slot H as in (12.1a). A number of copula RCs (notably demonstrative1 and interrogative RCs) only occur preposed to the NP head in slot A as in (12.1b). A full discussion of RCs is at §13.6 and Chapter 20;

(12.1) a. Tume =tukwe

b. [YumeCC=ke jipamu]CS ji-u=pijiCC. over.there=LIG papaya good-ASF=DIM
‘That papaya (plant) (that we see from the distance) is very nice.’ n5.0466

— slot B is filled by quantifier modifiers. Quantifier modifiers consist of logical quantifiers (e.g., dutya ‘all’ as in (12.2)), numerals (e.g., beta ‘two), and quantifier question marker (ejeuma ‘how many’) and the word peya ‘other’. A full discussion is at §13.5;

‘All the animals were very skinny (because they had not eaten for days).’

423 ti005b

— slot C is filled by a genitive modifier. This can be a genitive phrase (marked by the enclitic =ja ‘GEN’ that attaches to the last phonological word of the phrase) as in (12.3a) or a genitive pronoun as in (12.3b):

(12.3) a. [[Ebakwa nana=ja] eja=kwana]CS =tuCS naka-da=jariCC.

Rosalino Rosalino be-COME.PERM-PERF =EMPH 1DL-GEN duck

‘(My wife came to me and said:) Rosalino, Rosalino, our (dl) duck (that was lost) has come back.’ ju025

A full discussion of genitive modifiers is in §13.4.

— slots D and E are filled by nouns. A noun in slot D functions as a modifier. A noun in slot E functions as the NP head. An example with both slots D and E filled is at (12.4):

(12.4)

BakwakwiS =tuS

ju-ya [nei mara=ju].

cheperequi.tree =3SG(-FM) blossom be-IMPFV rain time=LOC

‘The cherepequi tree blossoms during the rainy season.’ di0184

There are three subclasses of nouns: e-nouns, kinship nouns and independent nouns. A full discussion of nouns is found in the remainder of this chapter.

Nouns functioning as NP modifiers (in slot D) are discussed at length in §13.1.

— slot F is filled by an attributive adjective as in (12.5):

(12.5) a. [E-na

siri]CC =tu-keCS.

NPF-water old =3SG-FM

Iji-ume! drink-IMP.SG.NEG

1 Note that Cavineña does not have a word class of nominal demonstratives.

424 ‘This is old water. Don’t drink it!’ n5.0475
A full discussion of attributive adjectives is at §13.2.

— slot G is filled by number markers. There are three number markers: =ekatse ‘DL’ (illustrated in (12.6)), =kwana ‘PL’ (general plural) and =ekana (kinship nouns plural). Number markers, unlike other NP modifiers, are not phonologically independent but enclitics.

(12.6)

Tu-wa =shana juye=ekatseCS nereka-daCC.

there-LOC =PITY ox=DL

miserable-ASF

‘The oxen (dl) were miserable (having to pull the terribly heavy cart).’ ka239

A full discussion of number markers is in §13.3.
None of the NP constituents (including the head) is obligatory in a Cavineña NP. However, there are a number of distributional restrictions, as follows: 1 — if slots C (genitive modifier), D (juxtaposed noun) or F (attributive adjective) are filled, then slot E (nominal head) must be filled as well; 2 — if slot G (number modifier), is filled, then there must be at least one other NP constituent (so that it can phonologically attach to it).
Case and phrasal particles as not treated as part of the NP structure. Although both attach to an NP (following slot H), they are not part of the NP strictly speaking. Case markers do not have the modifying function the other NP constituents have. Case markers function at a higher level as relational operators which relate the NP as a whole to other types of constituents such as the predicate or another N (for genitive phrases) (see Chapter 14 for a full discussion). Phrasal particles can have a modifying function but none are specific to the noun phrase (they can as well modify a predicate, an independent particle, etc.). Thus they are considered to operate at a higher level of organisation than the NP per se (see Chapter 17 for a full discussion). Case and phrasal particles are thus not further discussed in this chapter.

425 12.2. Nouns — overview Nouns occur in slot E as NP head or slot D as NP modifiers. Nouns in Cavineña are morphologically rather simple (especially compared to verbs). Cavineña does not have any grammatical category of class or gender. The language marks number and case but these are separate clitics (i.e. separate grammatical words) which operate at the NP level, and not affixes in the noun word.
There are three subclasses of nouns distinguished by morpho-syntactic criteria: 1 — e-nouns consist of a closed class of probably about 100 to 150 terms which must take a dummy prefix e-. This prefix drops in a number of circumstances. E-nouns code parts of entities (e.g. -tsau ‘bone’, -rami ‘flesh’, -jaki ‘leaf’, -tiri ‘root’, etc.).
2 — kinship nouns consist of a small class of about 30 terms which are (obligatorily) inflected for the person of their possessor. They code kinship relations (e.g., tata ‘father’, anu ‘grandmother’, etc.).
3 — independent nouns consist of an open class of a couple of thousand terms which do not take any e- prefix nor any possessor inflections (the do however take derivational morphology). They refer to fauna, flora, artefact, proper nouns, etc.
The three subclasses of nouns are discussed in turn below: e-nouns in §12.3, kinship nouns in §12.4, and independent nouns in §12.5
12.3. E-nouns E-nouns are a closed class of about 100 to (possibly) 150 members. The class does not accept either borrowed or derived terms. E-nouns code mostly (there are a few exceptions) parts of entities. A full list of identified e-nouns given in the appendix to this chapter.
12.3.1. Prefix formative e- ‘NPF’ E-nouns have the particularity of requiring an obligatory prefix formative e- ‘Noun PreFix’ which is semantically empty. This prefix becomes y- before the vowel a- (e.g.,

426 y-atuka ‘eye’, y-akwa ‘NPF-chest’, y-aa ‘branch’). It never occurs before i, e, u and y (e-noun roots only begin with the vowel a or with a consonant other than y).
Examples in (12.7) illustrate -rami ‘flesh’ (in a.) and -jaki ‘leaf’ (in b.):
(12.7) a. … ju-nati-tsu =tu-keO =ekwanaA e-ramiO kwawi-kware. be-GO.TEMP-SS =3SG-FM =1PL(-ERG) NPF-flesh cook-REM.PAST
‘We arrived (at San Carlos) and we cooked the meat.’ n2.0666

b. … e-raraCC e-jaki=kwanaCS ju-kware

RES-dry NPF-leaf=PL

be-REM.PAST

‘… the leaves were dry.’ pe029

The prefix formative is segmentable. It is deleted in the following situations (a number of exceptions are discussed further below): 1 — the e-noun enters one of the following three derivational processes: (1) adjectivisation (with -ki ‘WITH’ or -ma ‘WITHOUT’; see §11.3.1), compounding with a da-adjective (resulting in a complex da-adjective; see §11.2.5) and noun incorporation (within a transitive verb; see §5.2.5). These processes are examplified in turn below.

(Note that ki- and ma-adjectivisation can be applied to kinship and independent nouns as well, compounding with a da-adjective and noun incorporation are restricted to e-nouns.)

Examples in (12.8) show the e-nouns -tse ‘tooth’ and -na ‘water’ with the adjectiviser

suffixes -ki ‘WITH’ and -ma ‘WITHOUT’:

(12.8) a. e-tse ‘tooth’

tse-ki ‘with tooth (e.g., baby)’ (*e-tse-ki)

tse-ma ‘toothless’

(*e-tse-ma)

b. e-na na-ki na-ma

‘water’ ‘with water’ ‘without water’

(*e-na-ki) (*e-na-ma)

427 (See also tsau-ma ‘without bones’ in (12.23a).)

Examples in (12.9) show the e-nouns -bi ‘arm’, -biti ‘skin’ and -wikani ‘nose’

compounded with the da-adjectives baru- ‘tall’, misi- ‘thick’ and ari- ‘big’ respectively

(resulting in complex da-adjectives):

(12.9) a. e-bi

‘arm’

baru-

‘tall-’

bi-baru-

‘with long (lit. tall) arms’ (*e-bi-baru-)

b. e-biti misibiti-misi-

‘skin’ ‘thick-’ ‘with thick skin’

(*e-biti-misi-)

c. e-wikani ariwikani-ari-

‘nose’ ‘big-’ ‘with a big nose’

(*e-wikani-ari-)

Examples in (12.10) show the e-nouns -akwa ‘chest’, -rumu ‘neck’ and -wi ‘beak’

incorporated into verbs (see full discussion of this process in §5.2.5):

(12.10) a. y-akwa

‘chest’

tsuru-

‘meet’

akwa-tsuru- ‘to face (lit. to chest-meet)’ (*y-akwa-tsuru-)

b. e-rumu tuburumu-tubu-

‘neck’ ‘cut’ ‘throat-slit’

(*e-rumu-tubu-)

c. e-wi risiwi-risi-

‘beak’ ‘tie’ ‘tie the neck’

(*e-wi-risi-)

2 — the e-noun is preceded by a juxtaposed noun in slot D of the NP structure (see full discussion in §13.1). Examples in (12.11) illustrate the same e-nouns -rami ‘flesh’ and -jaki ‘leaf’ (as found in (12.7)) but this time preceded by a noun modifier in slot D:

428

(12.11) a. Ani-ya=dya yu-keja

[waka rami]?

sit-IMPFV=FOC there-LOC.GNL cow flesh

‘Is there cow meat (lit. flesh) over there (in your country)?’ tb205

b. Chamakama [tumi

finally

motacú.palm

jaki] tubu-tsu… leaf cut-SS

‘Finally, he cut motacú palm leaves and …’ na022c

It could be argued that direct modification of a noun by another noun is a process of morphological compounding (as opposed to syntactic juxtaposition). Note that nothing can intervene between the two nouns. Modification of a noun by another noun could therefore be seen as a derivational process similar to adjectivisation (as in (12.8)), compounding with an adjective (as in (12.9)) or noun incorporation (within a verb; as in (12.10)). The compounding analysis has not been adopted because (1) both nouns are independent phonological words, (2) modification of a noun by another noun is fully productive, (3) it is possible to question the modifier noun independently from the head noun and (4) the semantic result if in most cases fully predicatable (see full discussion in §13.1.4).

Most e-noun roots have more than two syllables and can form independent phonological words whether they take the e-prefix or not, since they are always polysyllabic (recall that a phonological word must have two syllables in Cavineña; see §3.1.2).

However five e-noun roots are mono-syllabic. They are given in (12.12):

(12.12) -bi ‘arm’

-tse ‘tooth’

-ka ‘egg’

-wi ‘beak’

-na ‘water’

When these roots bear the e- prefix, they make two syllables and can form independent phonological words. However, this is not possible when the e- prefix is lost and when no other affix accompanies the root. This situation arises when there is a modifier in slot D. (Note that in derivational processes, an affix is always attached to the e-noun root and these make perfect independent phonological words.) What happens in that situation is that the e-noun root becomes cliticised to the preceding (slot D) modifier.

429 Examples are at (12.13):2

(12.13) a. Amena =tuS

ani-ya dati=kaS.

FILL

=3SG(-FM) sit-IMPFV tortoise=egg

b. Na-pude-daCC =tuCS

kweri=naCS.

water-red-ASF =3SG(-FM) river=water

‘The water of the (Beni) river is red.’ di1111

Two e-nouns are irregular with respect to the prefix formative. The e-noun meaning ‘thorn’ takes an a- prefix formative as a-kwija (*e-kwija). The e-noun meaning ‘mind, thought’ is takes an i- prefix formative as i-nime (*e-nime).
The e-noun -wa(ch/si) ‘foot’ is pronounced e-wachi or e-wasi (i.e., with the prefix e-) in free variation but is only pronounced wasi when combined with a slot D modifier (e.g. mesa wasi ‘table leg’).
The e-noun -sepere ‘stream’ is pronounced as sepere when taking an D slot modifier (e.g., sawa sepere ‘benton fish spring’). However, in isolation with the prefix e-, it becomes espere (with elision of the vowel e from the first syllable of the root).

12.3.2. Irregularities Occasionally an e-noun preceded by a slot D modifier does not lose the e- prefix. This phenomenon is normally accepted by speakers in elicitation but is very rare in texts. It is not associated with any clear meaning differences.
In (12.14), for example, -kaka loses it e- prefix in (a.) (as normally expected) but not in (b.):

2 Note that in (12.13b), -na is also incorporated into an adjective, pude- ‘red’ (as in (12.9)).

nambú.partridge NPF-egg =3SG(-FM) green/blue -ASF

‘Nambú partridge eggs are blue/green.’ di2455

The prefix e- of some e-nouns is only segmentable in some contexts but never in

others. This happens with the e-noun -aa ‘branch’ as shown in (12.16). Here, e- is never

deleted in noun juxtaposition (as in a.) or adjectivisation (as in b.). However, e- is

deleted in noun incorporation (as in c.):

(12.16) a. akwi y-aa

Another e-noun showing the same phenomenon is -marikaka ‘cooking pot’ as shown in

431

(12.17). The prefix e- is not deleted in juxtaposition (as in a.) but it is deleted in

adjectivisation (as in b.):

(*mechi marikaka)

A number of nouns begin with a vowel e (or glide y) which cannot be (at least

synchronically) segmented. In other words, they never loose e- (or y-). These nouns are

thus treated as independent nouns. This was noted with eja ‘nest’ in (12.18), eyu ‘palm

hear’ in (12.19), epu ‘village’ in (12.20), yawa ‘ground’ in (12.21) and yachi ‘pampa’ in

432 It is quite possible that these words belonged to the e-noun class at some older stage of the language but later on the prefix froze, perhaps under the pressure of Spanish which does not show any such morphology.
This process is plausible when looking at other Tacana languages — they all have a similar class of e-nouns whose semantics are about parts; see Pitman (1980: 75) and Emkow (forthcoming) for Araona, Chavarría (2000) for Ese Eja, Key (1968: 92) for Reyesano, and Ottavino and Ottavino (1989) for Tacana.

12.3.3. Semantics
Up to date, we have been able to identify about 90 e-nouns. For each of the members — they are listed in the appendix to this chapter — we have been able to find examples where the e- prefix could be dropped (showing that it is segmentable).

Semantically, the great majority of e-nouns code body parts (33 terms referring to external parts and 9 terms referring to internal body parts). An important number of e-noun code plant parts (8 terms), landscape parts (12 terms) and spatial relations (9 terms). A remaining 17 terms code miscellaneous concepts such as ‘name’, ‘trace’, etc. See list of e-nouns in the appendix to this chapter.

One very surprising e-noun is -tsena ‘worm’ (all fauna entities are otherwise coded by independent nouns). It is illustrated in (12.23) with two examples volunteered by Alfredo Tavo, showing it with the e- prefix (in a.) and without the e- prefix (in b.):

(12.23) a. E-tsenaCS =tuCS NPF-worm =3SG(-FM)

tsau-maCC. bone-WITHOUT

‘Worms don’t have bones.’ n5.0066

b. [Ekwita tsena]S e-kwe ani-ya. body worm 1SG-DAT sit-IMPFV
‘I have worms in my body (lit. body worms sit to me).’ n5.0033

It is likely that the list is much bigger (possibly up to 150). It is first quite possible

433

that some e-noun are missing from our corpus. Second, even from our corpus, there

remains an important number (more than 30) of nouns which begin with an e (or y)

vowel but for which no example was available to either confirm or discard whether the

e- was segmentable or not. More work is required to decide on their status. A sample of

these is given in (12.24) below, sorted by semantic fields (the sample does not include

unfamiliar terms which are only found once in the dictionary):

434 12.4. Kinship nouns

12.4.1. Semantics

Kinship nouns consist of about 28 forms which encode human relations. They are listed in Table 12.1:3

Table 12.1: Kinship nouns

tata kwaa mama awe wane bakwa bakujuna tatapuji kaapuji bakwapuji bakujunapuji nuu usi jau nasi jana

‘father’ ‘mother’ ‘mother’ ‘husband’ ‘wife’ ‘son’ ‘daughter’ ‘stepfather’ ‘stepmother’ ‘adopted son’ ‘adopted daughter’ ‘sibling’ ‘older brother’ ‘younger brother’ ‘older sister’ ‘younger sister’

jakwi awiine tatiine kuku nene kwaine baba anu bui ukwa utsekwa kupari kumari

‘brother in law (sister’s husband)’ ‘sister in law (husband’s sister)’ ‘uncle (father’s brother, FB)’ ‘uncle (mother’s brother, MB)’ ‘aunt (father’s sister, FZ)’ ‘aunt (mother’s sister, MZ)’ ‘grandfather’ ‘grandmother’ ‘male nephew’ ‘nephew/niece’ ‘male/female grandchild’ ‘godfather’ ‘godmother’

A few kinship nouns are (at least partly) analysable: 1— The term bakujuna ‘daughter’ most likely comes from bakwa ‘son’ + the e-noun -puna ‘woman, female’ (with sound change kw -> ku and p -> j); 2 — The terms awiine ‘sister in law’, tatiine ‘uncle FB’ and kwaine ‘aunt MZ’ are clearly related to awe ‘husband’, tata ‘father’ and kwaa ‘mother’ respectively, to which the formative ine is attached. (The formative ine is not found independently in present day Cavineña. It possibly have meant ‘sibling’.); 3 — The four terms tatapuji ‘stepfather’, kwaapuji ‘stepmother’, bakwapuji ‘adopted son’ and bakujunapuji ‘adopted daughter’ are clearly based on the suffix -puji —

3 I use standard abbreviations as given in Keesing (1975: 102), for example: M ‘mother’, F ‘father’, B ‘brother’, Z ‘sister’, S ‘son’, D ‘daughter’.

435 meaning perhaps ‘not proper’ (perhaps cognate with the suffix -puji involved in agentive nominalisation; see §12.7.1 below — and the terms for ‘father’, ‘mother’, ‘son’ and ‘daughter’ respectively); 4 — At least four terms have been borrowed, tata ‘father’ (Quechua/Aymara taita), kupari ‘godfather’ and kumari ‘godmother’ (from Spanish ‘compadre’ and ‘commadre’ respectively) and kuku ‘uncle MB’ (origin unknown but found in a large number of languages all over Amazonia, Dixon and Aikhenvald 1999b: 8).

12.4.2. Possessor inflections

Kinship nouns take person inflections to indicate who the referent relates to (the possessor). The coding system of possessor inflections is shown in Table 12.2:

Table 12.2: System of person coding for kinship nouns

possessor person 1st 2nd / vocative 3rd

prefix eØ e-

enclitic Ø Ø =ke

examples

e-wane

‘my/our(dl)/our(pl) wi(fe/ves)’

wane

‘your(sg/dl/pl) wi(fe/ves)’

e-wane=ke ‘his/their(dl/pl) wi(fe/ves)’

As shown by the examples, only person (not number) is coded by the system. Number is usually disambiguated by using an additional (optional) genitive phrase (or pronoun) (slot C of the NP structure; see §12.4.3). Kinship terms in vocative function have the same form as those with a 2nd person possessor.

Kinship nouns with a 2nd person possessor do not take any overt morphological marking. Examples are given in (12.25):
(12.25) a. Jutakiju waneS pa-ani=jari! therefore wife JUSS-sit=STILL ‘Let you wife stay (lit. sit) for a while (while you go and after two weeks you can come back and pick her up).’ cv045

b. [Arusu=kwana a-wa=ke]O

=tuA

pa-ara =shana

rice=PL

affect-PERF=LIG =3SG(-ERG) JUSS-eat =PITY

436

[ju-na-wa=keREL

kwaine=ra]A!

be-COME.TEMP-PERF=LIG aunt=ERG

(When I arrived at the house of Mariano Cartagena saying that I was hungry, Mariano asked his wife (who is my niece) to prepare rice. He said to her:) ‘At least let your aunt who has just arrived eat some cooked rice (lit. rice that has been affected)!’ ka191

A kinship noun in vocative function has the same (unmarked) form as when it is possessed by a 2nd person. Some kinship nouns in vocative function are illustrated in (12.26):

(12.26) a. A=ishu

=tu-keO =miA

[tumeCC=ke ekwita]O

do.what=PURP.GNL =3SG-FM =2SG(-ERG) there=LIG person

‘Why did you let this man enter, father? ht024

b. Ne-kwa =taa Kuku! HORT-go =EMPH uncle.MB ‘Let’s go, Uncle!’ hm034

The unmarked form is also used when kinship terms enter a derivational process. This is (at least) attested with the -ki ‘WITH’ and -ma ‘WITHOUT’ adjectivisers (see §11.3.1) and (at least) attested with awe ‘husband’ and wane ‘wife’, as shown in (12.27). (Note that kinship nouns are not compounded with da-adjectives and do not enter noun incorporation.)

(12.27) a. Tu-keja=dya

wane-kiCC

there-LOC.GNL=FOC wife-WITH

437 ‘I was did not have a wife (i.e. I was a bachelor).’ mj017

Kinship nouns with 1st person possessor take e- ‘1’, as illustrated in (12.28):

(12.28) a. E-wane=raA =ØO 1-wife=ERG (=1SG-FM)

peta-ya look.at-IMPFV

‘My brother in law told the truth (lit. was right).’ sl075

Kinship nouns with a 3rd person possessor are marked with circumfix e-…=ke ‘3’, as illustrated in (12.29):

(12.29) a. E-wane=ke=raA amena 3-wife=3=ERG FILL

ba-ti-kware

‘The (lit. his) stepfather is raising his adopted son very badly (i.e. treating him badly).’ di1249

12.4.3. Kinship nouns and genitive modifier (slot C)
Very often (but not obligatorily, as shown by the preceding examples), an NP with a kinship noun (as head) also includes a genitive phrase or genitive pronoun (in slot C of the NP structure). This allows the speaker to add more specifications about the possessor, notably number (recall that possessor inflections only code person). Kinship nouns with pronominal genitive modifiers are illustrated in (12.30):

(12.30) a. [Ekwe e-awe]S =tuS

kwa-kware

1SG.GEN 1-husband =3SG(-FM) go-REM.PAST

Biata=ju… Biata.river=LOC

‘My husband went to the Biata river …’ di0804

b. Yume Eliuduru=raA, [metse-ja bakwa=ra]A iye-wa dukweriibaO. over.there Eliudoro=ERG 2DL-GEN son=ERG kill-PERF puma
‘“Over there, Eliuduru, your (dl) son, has killed a puma,” (the man said to me and my wife).’ el021

c. Nereda =tunaA a-wa

[tuna-ja e-ju=ke]O.

scold =3PL(-ERG) affect-PERF 3PL-GEN 3-younger.brother=3

‘They scolded their younger brother (because he didn’t stay quiet as they were preparing an ambush to kill their enemies)’ mk046

Kinship nouns with full genitive NPs allow the speaker to make full reference to the possessor are shown in (12.31):

(12.31) a. Eju =tuS

[Vitu=ja e-kwa=ke]S

INT:LOC =3SG(-FM) Victor=GEN 3-mother=3

‘Where did Victor’s mother go?’ ib064

kwa-kware? go-REM.PAST

439

b. [E-tata=ja e-anu=ke]S

=pa =tuS

japa-da diru-chine.

1-father=GEN 3-grandmother=3 =REP =3SG(-FM) far-ASF go-REC.PAST

‘My great-grandmother (lit. my father’s grandmother) has gone very far.’ di1250

Note that a genitive NP headed by another kinship noun allows reference to kinship relations for which a specific term does not exist in the language (such as greatgrandmother in (12.31b)).

12.4.4. Kinship nouns and =kwana ‘PL’
There is a very interesting interaction between kinship terms and number marking. There is a plural marker (=ekana ‘PL’) which is only used with kinship terms with a 1st or 2nd (but not 3rd) person possessor as shown in (12.32):

(12.32)

[E-kwe e-bakwa=ekana]CS =tuCS

uma-daCC ju-kware.

1SG-GEN 1-child=PL

=3SG(-FM) many-ASF be-REM.PAST

‘I had many children (lit. my children were many).’ n5.0246

Kinship terms possessed by a 3rd person require the general plural marker =kwana ‘PL’ (note that kinship terms with a 1st or 2nd possessor can also take =kwana ‘PL’). Very interestingly, when this happens, the =ke part of the circumfix e-…=ke ‘3’ follows the plural marker as seen in (12.33):

(12.33)

E-wane=kwana=keS (*e-wane=ke=kwana) kwa-ya epu=eke.

3-wife=PL=3

go-IMPFV village=PERL

‘Their wives would go (to meet their husbands that were hunting in the forest) from the village.’ ct037

(See more discussion at §13.3.1)

12.4.5. Irregular kinship nouns Quite a number of kinship terms have irregular possessor marking. Irregular forms are given in Table 12.3 (sorted by alphabetical order; irregularities are in bold face):

440
Table 12.3: Irregular kinship nouns

2nd p. / voc. 1st p. poss. 3rd p. poss.

gloss

awe awiine bui jau kwaa nasi usi utsekwa

e-ketsekwa

y-awi=ke y-awiine=ke e-bu=ke e-ju=ke e-kwa=ke e-naji=ke e-uji=ke y-utsekwa=ke

‘husband’ ‘sister in law (husband’s sister)’ ‘male nephew’ ‘younger brother’ ‘mother’ ‘older sister’ ‘older brother’ ‘male/female grandchild’

In three words y- occurs instead of e-. This reminds of the change e->y found with the e-noun prefix formative e- ‘NPF’ when it attaches to a root that begins with a (see §12.3). However, these are clearly not identical processes since with kinship nouns, the e->y change only occurs with three words and only when possessed by a 3rd person (for example there is not such change in e-anu ‘my/our grandmother’, e-awe ‘my/our husband’, etc.) (whereas with e-nouns the e->y change is full productive).

12.5. Independent nouns
Independent nouns represent the biggest subclass of nouns (at least a couple of thousand forms). Semantically, these nouns refer to entities of the world that are conceived within the Cavineña culture as having an existence of their own. Independent nouns are an open class to both derivation (from another word class) and borrowings (this is unlike e-nouns and kinship nouns). The class counts hundreds of recent Spanish and (less recent) Quechua/Aymara loans.
Unlike e-nouns, independent nouns never take a segmentable prefix e- (or y-). Note that a number of nouns are classified as independent nouns even though they begin with the vowel e (or y) and could semantically be construed as parts of entities (e.g., eja ‘nest’, yaa ‘branch’, etc.). This is because e (or y) is not segmentable in these words (see discussion in §12.3). Unlike kinship nouns, independent nouns never take possessor inflections.

441 Independent nouns can become adjectives by taking -ki ‘WITH’ or -ma ‘WITHOUT’. They cannot be compounded with da-adjectives (resulting in complex da-adjectives). A few independent are attested as incorporated within transitive verbs.

12.5.1. Semantics

A sample of very frequently used basic (i.e. underived) independent nouns is given in

(12.34) below (sorted by semantic fields):

12.5.2. Semantic overlaps with e-nouns and kinship nouns There is a very interesting semantic overlap between independent nouns and e-nouns in the one hand and independent nouns and and kinship nouns in the other hand.
There are independent nouns which code parts of entities (as e-nouns do). A list of such terms is given in (12.35) (the list does not include unfamiliar terms which are only found once in corpus):

(12.35) a. Body parts atsu ijaka iwa iyuka tyuwi

‘breast’ ‘ear’ ‘tail’ ‘head’ ‘nape’

443

inyukwija takwiri suu kwesa ududu

‘armpit’ ‘calf’ ‘belly button’ ‘moustache’ ‘feather’

b. inner ami

‘blood’

dumi

‘excrement ‘

c. Body infections

baara

‘fever’

buju

‘diarrhea’

chadi

‘small pox’

chere

‘scabbies’

ujeje ujera uwi jitsu

‘disease’ ‘pain’ ‘skin stain’ ‘mold’

d. Plant parts eyu kwati

‘palmito’ ‘firewood’

yaa shasha

‘branch’ ‘flower’

It is likely that some nouns which are independent in present day Cavineña would have belonged to the class of e-nouns at previous stages.

Quite interestingly, there are pairs or e-nouns and independent nouns which are

semantically very similar (but etymologically unrelated), as shown in (12.36) (e-nouns

are in a., independent nouns are in b.):

(12.36) a. -sepere ‘stream’ vs. b. kweri ‘river’

-kata ‘feather’ vs.

ududu ‘feather’

-tsa ‘flower’

vs.

shasha ‘flower’

It is not clear why ‘stream’ is treated as a part while ‘river’ is treated as an independent entity. In the case of ‘feather’, I was told that -kata refers body feathers while ududu refers to wing and tail feathers. In one example, Alfredo Tavo used ududu to refer to ornament feathers which could explain why this term is independent while the other is bound. As for ‘flower’, Alfredo Tavo explained to me that shasha refers to beautiful

444 flowers — possibly also used as ornament — while -tsa can refer to any flowers (beautiful or not).

Independent nouns also code a number of interpersonal relations which overlap to

some extent with kinship nouns. They are given in (12.37):

(12.37) ata

‘relative’

ekwari

‘chief, leader, guide’

ebakwa(piji) ‘(small) child’

bakwa

‘baby animal, cub’

waraji

‘chief, authority’

Note that -puna ‘woman’ is an e-noun while while deka ‘man’ is an independent noun.

12.5.3. Interrogative noun ai ‘INT’ An interesting independent noun is ai ‘INT’. This noun can have a lexical meaning referring to ‘thing’, as in (12.38)

(12.38)

E-kwe =taa yu-wa

cosina=ju [ai siri=kwana]S

1SG-DAT =EMPH over.there-LOC kitchen=LOC INT old=PL

ani-ya. sit-IMPFV
‘(When Lidia heard that a burglar had entered the village she said:) I have old things (pans, pots, cutlery, etc.) over there in my kitchen (that the burglar might want to steal)!’ ml048

Ai also has grammaticalised meanings. It can be used as interrogative word as in (12.39) (note that (12.39b) is (T1.104)):

(12.39) a. AiO =tu-keO =miA

mare-wa?

INT =3SG-FM =2SG(-ERG) shoot-PERF

‘“What did you shoot?” (my wife’s uncle asked me when he heard the report of my rifle).’ lg019

445

b. AiS =jatsu =tu-ja =tuS

ani-ya?”

INT =EXACTLY =3SG-DAT =3SG(-FM) sit-IMPFV

‘What is it exactly that he (the sick person) has (lit. what exactly sits to him)?’ ao104

The noun ai can be used juxtaposed to the NP head (in slot D) to question a type (as in (12.40a)) or to code the fact that the NP head is of any type ( as in (12.40b)):

(12.40) a. [Ai jae]O =miA

kemi-wa?

INT fish =2SG(-ERG) take.out-PERF

‘What type of fish did you catch (lit. take out)? n4.0544

aijama=dyaCC

ju-kware [ai tujuri]CS…

at.that.time =3SG(-FM) not.exist.at.all=FOC be-REM.PAST INT mosquito.net

‘At that (old) time there was not any mosquito net at all … ‘ hm049

12.5.4. Deictic nouns

A few examples are available of three deictic morphemes, listed in (12.41):

(12.41) rekwana

‘this stuff here’

tukwana

‘that stuff there’

yukwana

‘that stuff over there’

These forms are quite transparently analysable as being formed of deictic roots (re‘near speaker’, tu- ‘near addressee’ and yu- ‘not near speaker or addresse’; these roots are also found in pronouns and demonstratives; see Chapter 15) and a suffix -kwana (related to plural marker =kwana; §13.3).

The deictic morphemes are used to refer to non-human/nonindividuated/heterogenous entities with an associative meaning. They have been tentatively classified as independent nouns on the following basis: — deictic morphemes can function as sole element in an NP in core function. Example showing these morphemes in O and A functions are given in (12.42):

446

(12.42) a. Tukwana=dyaO =ekwanaA ara-kware.

that.stuff=FOC =1PL

eat-REM.PAST

‘We ate these things (the plantains, the coati, etc).’ mj172

b. E-raA =bakwe tukwanaO adeba-ya=ama… 1SG-ERG =CONTR that.stuff know-IMPFV=NEG
‘Me, I didn’t know these things (the cayman and other sorts of jungle animals)…’ lg027

b. Tukwana=raA =yatseO [babi=ra

that.stuff=ERG =1DL hunt=PURP.MOT go-PERF=DS

karu-bawe. bite-ALWS

‘These things (ants and other types of insects) bite us when we go hunting.’ di2632

— deictic morphemes can function as sole element in locative NPs (and have locative meanings) by taking a locative postposition. They are illustrated in (12.43) in locative (with postposition =ju ‘LOC’), general locative (with postposition =keja) and perlative (with postposition =eke) functions:
(12.43) a. Tukwana=ju=dya =shana =tunaO butya-ya. that.stuff=LOC=LOC =PITY =3PL lower-IMPFV
‘In these things (clay pots and other sorts of recipients) they (Cavineña women) would put it (manioc beer) (lit. put down from the fire).’ ci195

The possibility for these deictic morphemes to have locative meanings makes them clearly different from independent pronouns (§15.1) which cannot.

— deictic morphemes can (apparently — we only have one example) function as juxtaposed modifiers (slot D) in an NP while independent pronouns cannot. This is suggested by (12.44) (volunteered by Emerenciano Sepa) with the deictic noun yukwana (note however that the e- prefix of the e-noun -majaka is not deleted):

12.6. Grammar of inalienability
Many languages make a morpho-syntactic distinction between alienably possessed nouns and inalienably possessed nouns (see among others Chappell and McGregor 1989, 1996 and Nichols 1988). In Cavineña, this distinction is clearly encoded with kinship nouns which take obligatory possessor inflections while other types of nouns (either independent or e-nouns) do not.
In the case of e-nouns, it is not altogether clear if the morpho-syntactic peculiarities of these nouns should be viewed as also reflecting inalienability. Camp and Liccardi (1989: 327) claim that e-nouns are also inalienably possessed. E-nouns, according to the authors, require an obligatory possessor, either expressed by a juxtaposed noun (coding a specific possessor; as in repeated (12.11a)) or by a prefix e(coding an generic/impersonal possessor; as in repeated (12.7a)):

448

[waka rami]?

sit-IMPFV=FOC there-LOC.GNL cow

‘We arrived (at San Carlos) and we cooked the meat.’ n2.0666

There are a number of problems with analysing the above facts as representing inalienable ‘possession’: 1 — the juxtaposed noun never refers to a specific entity. To say ‘the flesh of a particular cow’, one has to use a genitive phrase in slot C, as in (12.45a). To say ‘its flesh’ (or ‘my flesh’, ‘your flesh’, etc.), one has to use a special genitive pronoun (also in slot C), as in (12.45b). As shown by ungrammatical (12.45c), there is no such construction where a (case-)unmarked pronoun can go into slot D.
(12.45) a. waka=jaC e-rami cow=GEN NPF-flesh
‘the flesh of the cow’ (e.g. of an injured cow whose flesh is visible)

b. tu-jaC e-rami 3SG-GEN NPF-flesh ‘its flesh’

c. *tu-ke rami / *tu-rami 3SG-FM flesh 3SG-flesh

The same genitive constructions would also have to be used to refer to either one’s own or one’s acquired flesh.

2 — juxtaposed nouns (slot D) do not exclusively modify e-nouns (as NP head in slot E) but also independent nouns (see full exemplification in §13.1.1).

These two facts suggest that the morpho-syntactic peculiarities of e-nouns do not really have to do with what is traditionally called inalienable possession. Historically, it is quite possible that e-nouns have coded an inalienable possession distinction. Recall that e-nouns are found in all living Tacana languages where (to my knowledge) they do

449 not behave morpho-syntactically any differently from Cavineña. This suggests that this is a very old feature. If this is indeed the case, the e- prefix could be a remnant of a paradigm of possessor inflections. One could alternatively speculate whether this prefix could have originated from the contraction of the indefinite/interrogative (independent) noun ai ‘INT’ (ai > e) within slot D.

12.7. Derivational morphology

Independent nouns (but not e-nouns or kinship terms) can be derived synchronically from other word classes or from other nouns. Five productive derivational affixes used to derive independent nouns from other word classes or from other nouns are given in Table 12.4. The table indicates the affixes involved, the base (from which the independent noun is derived), the resulting semantics and the section where the affix is discussed:

instrument location location affection

§12.7.2 §12.7.3 §12.7.4 §12.7.5

A number of processes are less productive and regular. These are direct conversion (a noun has a corresponding term within another word classes; §12.7.6), inherent reduplication (a noun has a reduplicated form but no independently identifiable base; §12.7.7) and a number of formatives (§12.7.8).

Finally, an important number of nouns are compounds. Most compounds appear to be lexicalised syntactic constructions, notably noun juxtaposition (slots D — E; e.g., ebakwa tare ‘uterus’ from ebakwa ‘child’ and -tare ‘house’; see §13.1.3) and modification of a noun by an attributive adjective (slots E — F; e.g., eka paja ‘egg white’ from -ka ‘egg’ and paja ‘white’; see §13.2.2). Noun compounding is not further discussed in this chapter.

450

12.7.1. -puji ‘ONE THAT’
The suffix -puji derives an independent noun from verbs (either inflecting or noninflecting and either intransitive or transitive) (in a few example, a suffix -puji derives nouns form other nouns or adjectives; see below). The derived noun refers to a ‘good performer’ (either S or A) of the verb event. (This derivation can be called agentive nominalisation according to Comrie and Thompson 1985.)

Examples with inflecting verbs are at (12.46) (intransitive verbs in a. and transitive verbs in b.): (12.46) a. nawi- ‘bathe’ -> nawi-puji ‘someone who bathes very early
morning’ kati- ‘fight’ -> kati-puji ‘someone good at fighting’

b. chiri- ‘steal O’ -> iye- ‘kill O’ ->

chiri-puji iye-puji

‘thief’ ‘someone good at killing (e.g., peccaries)’

In some cases, the reflexive circumfix k(a)-…-ti (§8.2) is included in the derivation process (in addition to the verbal root) as in (12.47):
(12.47) a. k-iye-ti-puji REF-kill-REF-ONE.THAT ‘criminal’

b. ka-bakanisha-ti-puji REF-give.nicknames-REF-ONE.THAT ‘someone good at giving nicknames’

c. ka-chachane-ti-puji REF-cure-REF-ONE.THAT ‘someone that cures (doctor, medicine man)’

451 The original O of a transitive verb can be included in slot D (as a juxtaposed noun) of the NP structure such as juje ‘duck’ in (12.48):

(12.48)

Jutakiju rewa=ke=dyaCC =riCS

ju-chine

therefore here=LIG=FOC =3PROX.SG(-FM) be-REC.PAST

[juje duck

chiri-puji]CS. steal-ONE.THAT

‘Therefore, the duck-stealer is (someone) from here.’ ju018

Non-inflecting verbs (see §5.3) are also nominalised by -puji. The auxiliary is

always omitted. Examples are at (12.49) (intransitive verbs in a. and transitive verbs in

b.):

(12.49) a. atsa ju-

‘fish with

-> atsa-puji

‘someone good at

poison’

fishing with poison’

babi ju-

‘hunt’

-> babi-puji

‘good hunter’

chine ju- ‘have fiesta’ -> chine-puji

‘partygoer’

mere ju- ‘work’

-> mere-puji

‘good worker’

tarepe ju- ‘visit’

-> tarepe-puji

‘someone that visit

often’

b. ijawe a-

‘play with O’ -> mere-puji

‘(soccer) player’

kwatsabiji ‘tell story to -> kwatsabiji-puji ‘story-teller’

ju-

O’

In two cases, agentive nominalisation is applied to a non-inflecting verb first derived through the auxiliary-taking process of full reduplication (§10.6). One is bawityabawitya-puji ‘teacher’ from bawitya-bawitya a- (teach O repeatedly) (first reduplicated from bawitya- ‘teach O’). The other is sama-sama-puji ‘doctor’ from sama-sama a‘cure O repeatedly’ (first reduplicated from sama- ‘cure O’).

In a few cases, a suffix -puji derives nouns from other word classes. These can be

nouns, as in (12.50a), where the derived noun refers to a good maker/builder of N, and

(12.50b), where the derived noun refers to a ‘good killer/hunter’ of N:

(12.50) a. karetu

‘cart’

-> karetu-puji

‘someone who

makes carts’

dure b. waburasa

452

‘belt’

-> dure-puji

‘someone who

makes belts’

‘peccary’ -> waburasa-puji ‘(dog) good at

hunting peccaries’

Let us recall that four kinship terms (tatapuji ‘stepfather’, kwaapuji ‘stepmother’, bakwapuji ‘adopted son’ and bakujunapuji ‘adopted daughter’) also involve a suffix -puji which is applied on the terms for ‘father’, ‘mother’, ‘son’ and ‘daughter’ respectively.

In one case, agentive nominalisation applies to the independent adjective nijuki ‘drunk’ and derives the noun nijuki-puji ‘drunkard’.

More work is required to know if the suffix -puji that applies to verbs is the same as the one which applies to nouns and adjectives, and also to know how productive this derivational process is.

12.7.2. e-…-ki ‘NMLS’
The circumfix e-…-ki only applies to verbs (there is only one attested exception where it is found with a noun; see below). The verb can be either intransitive or transitive but has to be inflecting. The derived noun encodes an entity that is used by the S (if based on an intransitive verb) or A (if based on a transitive verb) argument in order to perform the verb event (and could be expressed by an instrumental oblique phrase). (This derivation can be called instrumental nominalisation according to Comrie and Thompson 1985.)

We give a few examples in (12.51) below (the a-examples are based on

intransitive verbs, the b-examples are based on transitive verbs):

(12.51) a. ani- ‘sit, live’

-> e-ani-ki

‘house outside of village’5

nawi- ‘bathe’

-> e-nawi-ti-ki6 ‘(personal) place to bathe’

bade- ‘hang’

-> e-bade-ki

‘hammock’

5 A house inside the village is -tare ‘house’. 6 Note that in this form the aktionsart suffix -ti ‘GO.TEMP’ (§7.2) has been included together with the verb root. The resulting derived noun is literaly ‘place to go to bathe’.

tawi- ‘sleep’

->

b. jutu- ‘dress O’

->

kweja- ‘inform O of O’ ->

miwa- ‘feed O’

->

pei- ‘fan O’

->

sama- ‘cure O’

->

taru- ‘stir O’

->

temi- ‘sweeten O (coca)’->

teri- ‘close O’

->

tucha- ‘put fire to O’ ->

e-tawi-ki e-jutu-ki e-kweja-ki e-miwa-ki e-pi-ki e-sama-ki e-taru-ki e-temi-ki e-teri-ki e-tucha-ki

453 ‘bedding’ ‘clothes’ ‘news’ ‘meat bait (for fishing)’ ‘fan’7 ‘medicine’ ‘oar’ ‘(food) sweetener’8 ‘door’ ‘thin stick’

We illustrate the instrumental nominalisation of bade- ‘hang’ in (12.52):

(12.52)

… =pa =tuna-ja =tuO

e-bade-kiO

duju-kware.

=REP =3PL-DAT =3SG(-FM) NMLS-hang-NMLS take-REM.PAST

‘… they brought (lit. took) a hammock (lit. what is used to hang).’ si031

(See also eaniki ‘house (outside of the village)’ at (T1.85).)

With the verbs ara- and iji- the derived nouns e-ara-ki ‘food’ and e-iji-ki ‘drink’ rather encodes the entity affected by the verb event (i.e. the O argument, rather than an instrumental oblique).

With the verb taji- ‘accompany O’ and tsawa- ‘help O’, the derived noun e-taji-ki ‘friend’ and e-tsawa-ki ‘helper, assistant’ rather codes the agent (A argument) (literally ‘the one that accompanies me’ and ‘the one that help me’ respectively).

A settlement can be called e-iyumata-ki. The verb iyumata- is used to refer to a snake rolling itself up.

In only one case the base is (at least synchronically) a noun: e-tsuje-ki ‘money’ from e-noun -tsuje ‘value, price’.
7 Note an idiosyncratic elision of e from the root pei- during the derivation process. 8 The verb temi- is used when chewing coca leaves. It refers the process of adding a sweetener (coca leaves have a quite bitter taste), typically ashes from a particular plant, into ones mouth. The noun derived from this verbs refers to foodstuff that ‘sweeten’ the strong taste of meat (e.g., rice, manioc, etc.).

454

The nouns in (12.53) appear to derived from e-…-ki but the base is unknown:

(12.53) ebubuki

‘broom made of palm leaves’

ebanataki ‘stick for making holes in grounds’

eduki

‘traditional cotton string’

ekiniki

‘container’

espiki

‘wall’

etijaki

‘ember’

ewijatuki ‘cork’

The suffix -ki which is part of the circumfix e-…-ki is likely historically related to the adjectiviser -ki ‘WITH’ (see §11.3.1).

12.7.3. e-…-kware ‘NMLS’

The circumfix e-…-kware derives independent nouns from intransitive inflecting verbs.

The derived noun encodes an entity that refers to a place where the verb event can be

performed occasionally (not typically). (This derivation can be called locative

nominalisation according to Comrie and Thompson 1985.)

This is illustrated in (12.54):

(12.54) ani-

‘sit’

-> e-ani-kware ‘place to stay temporarily’

jara-

‘lie’

-> e-jara-kware ‘(animal’s) resting place’

kanajara- ‘rest’ -> e-kanajara-kware ‘place to rest’

nawi- ‘bathe’ -> e-nawi-kware ‘(village) place to bathe’

neti-

‘stand’ -> e-neti-kware ‘(bus) stop’

tawi-

‘sleep’ -> e-tawi-kware ‘camp’

wira- ‘urinate’ -> e-wira-kware ‘place to urinate’

We illustrate the locative nominalisation of the verb jara- in (12.55):

(12.55)

Ba-kware=dya =pa =tuA

[iba=ja e-jara-kware].

see-REM.PAST=EMP =REP =3SG(-FM) jaguar=GEN NMLS-lie-NMLS

‘He saw the place where the jaguar had rest.’ se028b

Note that the e-…-ki derivation discussed in the previous section can also refer to

455

places. Thus we have the following pairs:

(12.56) e-ani-ki ‘house oustide of village’ e-ani-kware ‘place to stay temporarily’

e-nawi-ti-ki ‘place to bathe’

e-nawi-kware ‘(village) place to bathe’

e-tawi-ki ‘bedding’

e-tawi-kware ‘camp’

The main difference is that e-…-ki has a more utilitarian/functional sense and e-…-kware has a more spatial sense. E-ani-ki, for example is typically a house build outside of a community for some particular purpose such as raising cattle, storing brazil nuts, etc.). By contrast e-ani-kware is a place (typically a little hut) with no particular function other than to rest (or protect onself from the sun or have a meal) when travelling or working away from home.

Note that e-…-kware is only found on intransitive verbs. The only transitive verb found involved in this derivation is ara- ‘eat O’. However it is first detransitivised by antipassive reduplication (§8.3.1), giving ara-ara- ‘eat’, then derived with e-…-kware as e-ara-ara-kware ‘temporary place to eat (away from home).

12.7.4. -kini ‘PLACE’
The suffix -kini ‘PLACE’ combines with a noun (mostly independent nouns but also found with one e-noun) and derives another independent noun which refers to a location where there are many Xs (X being the referent of the noun involved in the derivation).

Typically -kini attaches to nouns referring (or at least related) to trees/palms or

vegetation (as in a.). Two interesting uses of -kini are found with the e-noun -kwija

‘thorn’ (in b.) (recall that this e-noun has an irregular a- prefix; see §12.3.1) and

independent noun makana ‘gravel’ (in c.)

(12.57) a. akwi-kini (NPF-tree-PLACE)

‘place with many trees’

bii-kini

(NPF-real.palm-PLACE) ‘grove of real palms’

buda-kini (NPF-patuju.palm-PLACE) ‘grove or patuju palms’

budari-kini (NPF-banana-PLACE)

‘grove of banana’

epidi-kini (NPF-cusi.palm-PLACE) ‘grove of cusi palms’

kunu-kini (NPF-liana-PLACE)

‘place with many lianas’

nutsa-kini (NPF-grass-PLACE)

‘place with a lot of grass’

b. a-kwija-kini (NPF-thorn-PLACE)

456 ‘place with many thorns’

c. makana-kini (NPF-gravel-PLACE)

‘place with many gravels’

We illustrate a few nouns derived by -kini in (12.58):

(12.58) a. Ani-ya=dya [peadya muke-kini]S.

sit-IMPFV=FOC one

Kunu-kiniCC, a-kwija-kiniCC. liana-PLACE thorne-PLACE

‘It (the forest) was very bad (lit. untidy). It was all lianas and thorns.’ tr036

12.7.5. -chi ‘AFFTN’

The suffix -chi ‘AFFecTioN’ is used to derive independent nouns from kinship terms

(only). The derived term means that the person is dearly beloved by the possessor. In

the data, -chi is found with 6 terms only (more work is required to see if -chi can attach

to other kinship terms):

(12.59) baba ‘grandfather’ baba-chi ‘grandpa’

anu ‘grandmother’ anu-chi ‘grandma’

tata ‘father’

tata-chi ‘daddy’

mama ‘mother’

mama-chi ‘mummy’

nene ‘aunt.FZ’

nene-chi ‘aunty.FZ’

kuku ‘uncle.MB’

kuku-chi ‘(loved) uncle.MB’

The marker -chi is only found used with kinship nouns possessed by a 1st person or (less often) by a 2nd person (but never by a 3rd person).

A noun derived by -chi — being an independent noun — cannot take possessor inflections anymore (this is at least seen when possessed by 1st person — in this case the 1st person possessor prefix e- ‘1’ does not show up). Examples of -chi on kinship terms possessed by a 1st person are at (12.60a):

457

12.7.6. Direct conversion A large number of verb stems in Cavineña allow for a nominal use without any overt derivation. This is attested in the data for more than 30 intransitive verbs and about 13 transitive verbs. As such they are simply used without the inflectional morphology (but sometimes used with non-inflectional morphology) that is otherwise required when they are used as verbs.
Semantically, although there are some exceptions, the forms used nominally refer to the activity denoted by the verb stem (‘action/state nominalisation’ in Comrie and Thompson’s 1985 terms). This is illustrated in (12.62a) (inflecting verb verbs) and

(12.62b) (non-inflecting verbs):

(12.62) a. kike-

In some cases, some verbal suffixes or processes have been applied before the verb

becomes a noun, as in (12.63):

(12.63) ara-ara (eat-REDUP)

‘a/the eating’

k-isara-ti (REF-greet-REF) ‘a/the talk/word’

k-ejene-ti (REF-believe-REF) ‘a/the belief’

ju-neni- (be-RANDOM)

‘a/the (way of) walking’

In (12.64) and (12.65), we illustrate the use of the intransitive verbs ani- ‘sit, live’ and ki(/e)ke- ‘shout’ in their verbal function (in a-examples) and in their nominal function (in b-examples):

Nouns corresponding to non-inflecting verbs never include the auxiliary. The noninflecting verbs mere ju- ‘work’ and babi ju- ‘hunt’ and their nominal equivalents are illustrated in (12.66) and (12.67) (verbs are in a. while nouns are in b.):

In some cases, rather than referring to the verb action strictly speaking, the noun

can rather refer to an/the entity that is ‘created’ by the event encoded by the verb

(‘object nominalization’ in Comrie and Thompson’s 1985 terms). This is shown in

(12.68a) (intransitive verbs) and (12.68b) (transitive verbs):

wira dumi chipi dusha risi kati

460 ‘a/the urine’ ‘a/the excrement’ ‘a/the mark’ ‘a/the powder drink’ ‘a/the knot’ ‘a/the sting’

We illustrate the nominal use of the intransitive verb wira- ‘urinate’ in (12.69a) (heading an O NP)9 and the transitive verb kati- ‘sting’ in (12.69b) (heading an S NP):

(12.69) a. Riyapiji=kwita =ØS

wira-kware.

WiraO =ØA

a.little.bit=RESTR (=1SG-FM) urinate-REM.PAST urine (=1SG-ERG)

pucarara.viper=GEN sting =3SG(-FM) painful-ASF

‘The bite (lit. sting) of the pucarara viper is (very) painful.’ di2955

In yet other cases, however, the semantic link is less predictable, as in (12.70):

(12.70) aputa-

‘to disappear’ -> aputa ‘a/the shade’

dane-

‘to grow’

-> dane

‘a/the height’

jiji-

‘to feel hot, spicy’ -> jiji

‘a/the garbage’

tawi-

‘to sleep’

-> tawi

‘a/the sleepiness’

weni-

‘to go fast’

-> weni

‘a/the agility’

The intransitive verb tawi- ‘sleep’ is illustrated in its nominal use in (12.71) below where it is the head of an O NP:

9 In (12.69a), we can also see the verbal use of wira- in the first sentence of the example.

1SG-ERG sleep

resist-IMPFV

‘I (will) resist the sleepiness (i.e. I will not fall asleep).’ n2.0486

An analysis in terms of zero nominalisation or the possibility for verbs to occur as NP heads is more plausible in the present case than with the correspondances noted between adjectives and nouns (see §11.2.7). First, it is much more productive. Although this still requires testing, any verb might potentially be used as a noun. The semantics of the nominal use of the verb are also much more predictable. In most of the cases, it either refers to the activity denoted by the verb itself or an entity that results from it. Nevertheless, we will remain cautious for the present time and not make any generalisations until more is known about the present phenomenon.

12.7.7. Reduplication A fair number of nouns have a reduplicated shape. In many cases, these nouns are inherently reduplicated. That is, we cannot find any base from which a derivational process could have occurred. There are two types of reduplication patterns: last syllable reduplication and full reduplication. We discuss each in turn.
About 20 nouns have the last syllable reduplicated. An exhaustive list is given in (12.72), sorted by semantic fields:

(12.72) a. Fauna bijiji bururu bututu japipi pisusu sududu tiriri tyakariri wiriri

‘cuquisa bird’ ‘big toad’ ‘madidi ant’ ‘butterfly’ ‘iguana’ ‘capybara (rodent)’ ‘spider’ ‘chupacoto lizard’ ‘small partridge’

b. Flora jarere ‘cotton tree’ manunu ‘ochoó tree’ muwawa ‘grass’

462

c. Natural entities / Land formation

kwejiji

‘wind’

mejiji

‘beach’

sururu

‘waterfall’

tabubu

‘hurricane’

watsutsu

‘whirlpool’

d. Miscellaneous

ejapupu

‘henhouse’

madada

‘rat trap’

pabejerere ‘toaster pan’

weruru

‘sweat’

-jiruru

‘bank, side’

wekaka

‘day’

The noun kwejiji ‘wind’ is probably derived from the noun kweji ‘bad smell’ or the verb kweji- ‘fart’. The nouns weruru ‘sweat’ and ‘wekaka’ ‘day’ are cases of direct conversion from the intransitive verbs weruru- ‘to sweat’ and wekaka- ‘to be at dawn’. The noun ejapupu ‘henhouse’ clearly involves the independent noun eja ‘nest’ (however, the origin of pupu is unknown.) The origin of the remaining nouns is unknown and can only be analysed (at least synchronically) as inherently reduplicated.

Full reduplication is found with about 30 nouns. Some of these nouns clearly come from reduplicated verbs such as kujakuja ‘air balls’ from transitive kuja- ‘blow air into O’, jerujeru ‘song’ from intransitive jeru- ‘sing’ (note that jeru is also a noun but it then means ‘prayer’, not ‘song’), wenewene ‘letter’ from transitive wene- ‘write/draw O’. The noun tsatsa ‘cacaré bird’ possibly comes from intransitive tsa- ‘laugh’.

Others clearly come from other nouns such as kweyakweya ‘picture, foto’ from kweya ‘form, spirit’, jerujeru ‘song’ from jeru- ‘sing, pray O’, nusanusa ‘alphabet’ from nusa ‘small mark from a repetitive pattern’, and yusuyusu ‘idol’ from Yusu ‘god’.

The word uyuuyu ‘mud’ comes from the adjective uyu- ‘muddy’.

463

The origin of the remaining full reduplicated nouns is unknown and are analysed as

inherently reduplicated. These are listed in (12.73):

(12.73) a. Fauna

biribiri

‘small parrot sp.’

busabusa

‘glow-worm’

dukwadukwa ‘monkey sp.’

‘meat’ ‘beam’ ‘drawing, photo’ ‘kite’ ‘drum’ ‘toasted corn flour’ ‘Cavineña traditional dance’ ‘forest coca’

It is quite likely that many (partly or fully) reduplicated are ad hoc onomatopoeic creations where reduplication somehow reflects a sonorous or rythmic motion associated with the denoted referent.10 Note that many fully reduplicated nouns refer to birds (kaekae ‘macaw’, jaajaa ‘pampa turkey’, pupu ‘owl’, bijiji ‘cuquisa bird’, etc.) or

10 In §5.2.4, we show that verbs can also be created by (partial or full) reduplication involving onomatopoeia.

464 noisy entities (kumukumu ‘drum’, kwejiji ‘wind’, sururu ‘waterfall’11, tabubu ‘hurricane’). Many reduplicated nouns denote referents associated with a rythmic component (jabirijabiri ‘kite’, tiritiri ‘traditional dance’, japiji ‘butterfly, tiriri ‘spider’, watsusu ‘whirlpool’, etc.). There also appears to be some correlation between the types of phonemes that are used and the size of the entity or pitch of the sound that are presumably denoted. Front vowels i and e tend to correlate with small entities such as birds or butterfly (e.g. biribiri ‘small parrot sp.’, bijiji ‘cuquisa bird’ and japiji ‘butterfly’) whereas non-front vowels a and u with bigger entities (kaekae ‘macaw’, sududu ‘capybara (big rodent)’, etc.).

12.7.8. Formatives
Every person in a Cavineña community has an official name and an official surname (the surname is composed of the father’s surname followed by the mother’s surname; this is according to Bolivian practices). However, these are hardly ever used in daily life (they are only used for administrative purposes or with foreigners). What are used are nicknames (see §1.3 on the activity of giving nicknames in Cavineña society). Cavineñas coin many sorts of nicknames. One type of coined male nicknames is formed by adding an ending chu or ku (ku might be historically related to kuku ‘uncle.MB’) to the official name. This is accompanied by additional phonological changes which are not altogether understood yet (they notably — but apparently not only — involve adapting the name to the Cavineña phonological system).

The full list of such names collected is given in (12.74a) (with chu ending) and (12.74b)

(with ku ending):

(12.74) a. Apechu

<- Alfredo

Melchu <- Melchior

Felichu

<- Feliz

Panchu <- Francisco

Jaimechu <- Jaime

Emechu <- Emerenciano

Juanchu <- Juan

Nuchu <- Norberto

Kalachu <- Carmelo

Abranchu <- Abraham

Lechu

<- Gregorio

Danchu <- Eldan

Maechu <- Ismael

11 Note that the sequence ruru is also part of the intransitive verbs rururu- ‘flow’ and sukururu- ‘drip’ (see §5.2.4).

b. Manuku Ramiku Batuku Antuku Samuku Teyuku

<- Manuel <- Ramiro <- Bartolome <- António <- Samuel <- Elioterio

465

Peyuku <- Pedro

Dumiku <- Domingo

Nestuku <- Nestor

Reneku <- René

Awiku

<- Aureliano

Machaku <- Marcelino

It is not clear at the present stage whether the process is productive or not, whether chu or ku have particular meanings and how they are exactly used. Also, it is not known if women names can use these endings or not. Two examples, Lidika (from Lidia) and Uruka (from Olga) suggest that ka might be such an ending for women nicknames. More examples are required to confirm this hypothesis (note that in the case of Uruka, the ka ending might be the adaptation of the ga segment of Olga to the Cavineña phonological system).

A formative pe (possibly historically related to quantifier peya ‘another’; see

§13.5) is found as an ending in on five independent nouns. The meaning of pe appears

to be ‘different from X’ (X being the entity denoted by the non-derived noun):

(12.75) atape ‘relative’

<- ata

‘non-Cavineña person’

marape ‘following year’

<- mara ‘year’

wekakape ‘following day’

<- wekaka ‘day’

bakanipe ‘different name’

<- -bakani ‘name’

anape ‘different language’ <- -ana

‘tongue, language’

From these few examples, the pe suffix can apparently attach to both independent nouns and e-nouns. As normal with derivational processes involving e-nouns, the e- prefix is deleted.

Example (12.76) is an illustration of atape ‘non-Cavineña person’:

(12.76)

… ju-na-chine

=pa [peadya atape]S.

be-COME.TEMP-REC.PAST =REP one

non.Cavineña.person

‘(I came here with my oxen and cart because) a foreigner has arrived (and I’m supposed to pick him up).’ ka098

466 The formative pe is possibly also found in the independent adjectives bape ‘looking different’ (from ba- ‘see’), the non-inflecting verb tarepe ju- ‘visit’ (from e-noun -tare ‘house’) and independent noun nerekape ‘deceased person’ (from nereka ‘suffering’).

13 Noun phrase structure — modifiers
The structure of the NP consists of of 8 slots (from A to H), each associated with a particular word class, as follows (repeated from §12.1):
Slot A: Relative clause1 Slot B: Quantifier Slot C: Genitive modifier Slot D: Juxtaposed noun Slot E: Head noun Slot F: Attributive adjective Slot G: Number Slot H: Relative clause
A general discussion of the class of nouns is given in §§12.2-7. In the present chapter, we discuss NP modifiers. These consist of juxtaposed noun (slot D; §13.1), attributive adjective (slot F; §13.2), number marker (slot G; §13.3), genitive modifier (slot C; §13.4), quantifier (slot B; §13.5) and relative clause (slot A or H; §13.6).
13.1. Noun juxtaposition (slot D) A bare noun can modify the head of an NP (also a noun) by being directly preposed to it (in slot D). Noun juxtaposition can involve either independent nouns or e-nouns (but not kinship nouns) as either modifiers (slot D) or NP head (slot E) (§13.1.1).
Noun juxtaposition encodes a range of semantic relations (discussed in §13.1.2) having to do with the general idea of specification that is, “the dependant nominal indicates the type of entity that is being referred to by the head nominal” (Chappell and
1 Recall that Cavineña does not have a word class of nominal demonstratives. It will be seen that their equivalent is realised by a special type of (demonstrative) relative clauses.

470 McGregor 1989:28).2
In a number of cases, noun juxtaposition has unpredictable semantic results (§13.1.3).
Noun juxtaposition resembles noun compounding. Our choice of juxtaposition analysis over compounding is argued for in §13.1.4.
Note that modification of a noun by another noun can also be realised by a genitive phrase (slot C; see §13.4 and especially §13.4.3 where we show that the two types of constructions are different syntactically and semantically).

13.1.1. Syntax
A juxtaposed noun has the following morpho-syntactic properties: 1 — a juxtaposed noun occupies slot D of the predicate. We have not found more than one noun in slot D. In this sense, Cavineña is quite different from English where more than one noun can modify another noun as head of an NP (e.g., the awards selection committee).

2 — either an independent noun or an e-noun can fill slot D. Also, either an independent

noun or an e-noun can be modified by a juxtaposed noun. Kinship nouns, on the other

hand, are never found in slot D and are never modified by a juxtaposed noun. Examples

illustrating the four possible combinations are at (13.1):

(13.1) a. independent — independent

buda misa

(patuju palm + rope) ‘rope made of patuju palm’

abari epiki

(chonta palm + fan) ‘fan made of chonta palm’

ijike misi

(corn + tamale)

‘tamale made of corn’

2 It will be seen that the Cavineña juxtaposition construction has typical properties of classification constructions as defined by Chappell and McGregor. For example, only a noun (not a pronoun) can modify a head noun by juxtaposition and only the head noun can be referential. Also, no material can occur in between the two nouns.

b. independent — e-noun

dati=ka

waka rami

‘foot nail’ ‘arm bone’ ‘leg flesh’

3 — the independent noun ai ‘INT’ is used in slot D to question the type a noun (as head of the NP) belongs to (as in (13.2)) or to code the fact that the head noun belongs to any type (as in (13.3)):

(13.2) a. [Ai jae]O =miA

INT fruit

‘What sort of fruit does this animal like?’ (lit. what type of fruit is nice to that animal?) bu014

3 The symbol ‘=’ codes the fact that the e-noun cliticises to the justaposed noun (because the e-noun is mono-syllabic; see §12.3.1).

4 — a noun (either independent or e-noun) modifying (slot D) an e-noun (slot F), causes the e-noun to lose its e- prefix (see (13.1b,c) and (13.2b,c). Mono-syllabic e-noun roots cliticise to the (slot D) modifier, as with -ka ‘egg’ in (13.1b). (Note that there are few exceptions where the e- prefix is not dropped in that context; see full discussion in §12.3.1.)

5 — a noun in slot D consists of a bare root which cannot take any affixes or modifiers (such as a plural marker, an attributive adjective, a relative clause, etc.).

6 — typically, only a noun can occur in slot D. We have nevertheless come across a few examples where an element other than a noun is apparently used in slot D. Before more is known about such examples, we will treat these as exceptions.

In (13.4), the independent particles iyakwa ‘now, today, nowadays’ and ikwene ‘first’ (§16.1) occur in a position that appears to be slot C. They occur immediately before the head of an NP. In (13.4a) iyakwa is even found between a genitive modifier (slot C) and the head:

Alfredo Tavo mentioned once that when hearing a child crying one could say (13.5), where the a relative clause is presumably used in slot D (as opposed to slot A) because the e- prefix of the NP head (the e-noun -tsuri ‘voice’) is deleted:

7 — a noun in slot D obligatorily requires a head noun (slot E).

13.1.2. Semantics

The following semantic relations are expressed by a noun (in slot D) modifying another

noun (as NP head in slot E):

1 — Classification relations: the modifier is a term denoting a specific member of a

class expressed by the head noun, as in (13.6):

(13.6) tisaiyuka chai (tisaiyuka + small bird) ‘tisaiyuka bird’

mara akwi

(mara.tree + tree)

‘mara tree’

pusese ujeje (abscess + disease)

‘abscess disease’

2 — Location relations: the modifier is a term denoting where the referent of the head

noun is located, as with different types of diseases (ujeje) in (13.7):

(13.7) etsurikani ujeje (throat + disease)

‘cough’

yarapesiki ujeje (shoulder blade + disease) ‘back pain’

3 — Naming relations: the modifier is a proper name of the head noun referent as in

(13.8): (13.8)

Asunta chine (Ascension + fiesta) Sawaru wekaka (Saturday + day) Galilea epu (Galilea + village)

474
‘Ascension fiesta’ ‘Saturday’ (lit. Saturday day) ‘Galilea village’

A full example showing Galilea epu is at (13.9):

(13.9)

[[Galilea Galilea

epu=juCC=ke]RC waraji]CC jeeCC=keCS. village=LOC=LIG leader there=LIG

‘This (person) is the leader of the village of Galilea.’ tb041

4 — Time relations: the head noun mara ‘time’ is modified by a word denoting an

activity or an event associated with this particular time as in (13.10):

(13.10) e-ka mara (NPF-egg + time)

‘(tortoise) egg season’

beni mara (‘Sur’ wind + time)

‘time when the ‘Sur’ wind blows’

tee mara (slash-and-burn field + time) ‘season for preparing fields’

nei mara (rain + time)

‘rainy season’

5 — Whole-part relations where the modifier is the whole and the NP head is the part. This can be illustrated with -rami ‘flesh’ in (13.12a), -ka ‘egg’ in (13.12b), -jaki ‘leaf’ in (13.12c), and -tiri ‘root’ in (13.12d): (13.12) a. takure rami ‘chicken meat’
dukweri rami ‘deer meat’ duu rami ‘howler monkey meat’ waka rami ‘cow meat’

475

b. takure ka ‘chicken egg’

The combination of duu ‘howler monkey’ and -rami ‘flesh’ is illustrated in (13.13):

‘Is there cow meat over there (in your country)?’ tb205

6 — Part-of-part relations where both modifier and head refer to parts of entities, as in

(13.14):

(13.14) a. e-piti tsau

‘neck bone’

e-tsaka tsau

‘leg bone’

e-bi tsau

‘arm bone’

b. e-tamu rami e-tsaka rami

‘cheek flesh’ ‘leg flesh’

In the previous types of whole-part expressions, the specifier is used as generic nonreferential term. But this does not need to be the case. In (13.15) below, for example, the part nouns -witsana ‘spring’ and -kike ‘forest’ are specified by fully referential place

476

names:

(13.15) Najiji witsana ‘springs of the Madidi river’

Diata kike

‘forest of the Biata river’

(Note that the name of the Biata river is pronounced with a d in Cavineña while it is pronounced with a b in Spanish.)

7 — Composition relations where the specifier codes the material/stuff/entities the head noun is composed of. This is illustrated with different types of soups (e-noun -name) in (13.16a), different types of tamale (a sort of bread) (independent noun misi) in (13.16b), different types of bark straps in (13.16c), and different types of ‘(slash-and-burn) fields’ in (13.16d): (13.16) a. arusu name ‘rice soup’
kwawe name ‘manioc beer (lit. manioc soup)’

b. arusu misi ‘rice tamale’ ijike misi ‘corn tamale’

c. buda misa biji misa

‘patuju palm bark strap’ ‘balsa tree bark strap’

d. ijike tee shita tee

‘corn field’ ‘cane field’

‘The rice soup gets thick as is cooks (lit. as it dries).’ di0135

8 — User/creator relations where the specifier is the ‘user/creator’ and the NP head the entity used/created. This is shown with the e-nouns -diji ‘path’ in (13.18a) and -mekware ‘trace’ in (13.18b):

477

(13.18) a. waka diji

‘path made and regularly used by cattle’

karetu diji

‘path made and regularly used by carts’

b. iba mekware

‘jaguar trace’

waburu mekware ‘peccary trace’

kwanubi mekware ‘ground animal trace’

Constructions with -diji ‘path’ are illustrated in (13.19):

‘I reached (lit. went out to) the cart path.’ pe038

9 — ‘Goal’ relations where the specifier is the ‘goal’ (or raison d’être) of the entity encoded by the NP head. This is again found with the e-noun -diji ‘path’ in (13.20): (13.20) a. e-na diji ‘water path (path leading to water)’
mani diji ‘rubber-centre path (path leading to a rubber-centre)’

These two constructions are illustrated in (13.21):

478

10 — Gender relations where the nouns deka ‘man, male’ and -puna ‘woman, female’ (as head in slot E) specify the sex of an animate referent (in slot D). This is illustrated in (13.22):

(13.22) a. [Juje deka]O =pa =tuA

‘(So) the female jaguar told him.’ zo075

13.1.3. Lexicalisation

The meaning of quite a number of constructions with a noun directly modifying another

noun is not fully predictable. These are best treated as lexicalised collocations. A

sample is given in (13.23):

(13.23) a. independent — independent

iyuka muru

(head + dust)

‘dandruff’

dii bina

(mosquito + bat)

‘small bat sp.’

dukweri iba

(deer + jaguar)

‘puma’

b. independent — e-noun

ebakwa tare

ami diji

‘uterus’ ‘vein’

c. e-noun — independent

e-tiki muru

e-tsuri kani

(NPF-voice + hole)

‘ashes’ ‘throat’

d. e-noun — e-noun e-metuku takwa e-wachi takwa e-kwatsa biti espere yaa

(NPF-hand + liver) (NPF-foot + liver) (NPF-mouth + skin) (NPF.stream + branch)

479
‘palm of hand’ ‘palm of foot’ ‘lips’ ‘stream tributary’

13.1.4. Juxtaposition vs. compounding In this study we have treated direct modification of a noun by another noun as a syntactic construction (juxtaposition). However, one might ask whether this is not rather a case of compounding. First, note that the two nouns have to occur next to each other and no other material can occur in between. Second, if the second word is an e-noun, it does not take the e- prefix formative. This suggests that the two nouns form one grammatical unit as opposed to two separate grammatical words.
The syntactic juxtaposition analysis is prefered here, for the following reasons. 1 — prosodically, both members form independent phonological words. They both receive an independent Hn(M)M pitch contourn (§2.8) and a pause is possible between the two nouns (one exception consists of five with mono-syllabic e-noun roots which cliticise on the slot D modifier; see §12.3.1);
2 — Syntactically, the process of noun juxtaposition is nearly fully productive. Taking the whole-part relation, for example, it is possible to take a noun referring to a whole (e.g., waka ‘cow’) and form any logically possible combinations with nouns referring to its parts (e.g., waka biti ‘cow skin’, waka rami ‘cow flesh’, waka wasi ‘cow hoof (lit. cow foot)’, waka takwa ‘cow liver’, etc.). Alternatively, it is possible to take a noun referring to a part (e.g., -biti ‘skin’) and form any logically possible combinations with nouns referring to its ‘wholes’ (e.g., waka biti ‘cow skin’, waburasa biti ‘peccary skin’, matuja biti ‘cayman skin’, iba biti ‘jaguar skin, etc.).
Also, the modifier noun can be questioned independently from the head noun (by using the interrogative independent noun ai ‘INT’ in slot D; see(13.2a,b,c)). (Note that the reverse — i.e., head noun questioned independently from a juxtaposed slot D modifier — is not attested.);

480 3 — Semantically, the result of noun juxtaposition is largely predictable. Some combinations of nouns are not fully predictable (see example in (13.23)) but they can be accounted for by a process of lexicalisation.

13.2. Attributive adjectives (slot F)

Attributive adjectives occur as NP modifiers within slot F (§13.2.1). Attributive

adjectives consist of a closed class of 16 members which have very specific meanings.

The full list is given in (13.24), sorted by semantic types (following Dixon 2004):

(13.24) a. DIMENSION

baru

‘tall’

ebari

‘big and strong’

kaka

‘small and round’

wiri

b. AGE / VALUE

nana

‘baby’

siri

‘old’

c. COLOUR pude paja sewe jawa sawa

‘red/brown’ ‘white, clear’ ‘black’ ‘yellow’ ‘green/blue’

d. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES

jika

‘untidy’

midi

‘thick’

uke

‘hot’

turu

‘big male’

The semantics of adjective are discussed in (§13.2.2).

481 Attributive adjectives have a rather low functional load in Cavineña. They are only used very sparingly and are very often lexicalised (§13.2.3). Note that Cavineña also has an open class of predicative adjectives (more than 170 basic members; see Chapter 11). The main function of predicative adjectives is as copula complement but they are very often used attributively within (copula) relative clauses (see §13.6 and Chapter. 20).

13.2.1. Syntax
There is a very strong morpho-syntactic bond between attributive adjective morphemes and the noun they modify, as follows: 1 — attributive adjectives occupy slot F of the NP structure. Examples showing attributive adjectives co-occurring with various NP modifiers are in (13.25):

(13.25) a. [E-marikakaE ebariF=kwanaG]E4 =ekwanaS ka-kemi-ti-kware

NPF-cooking.pot big=PL

=1PL

REF-buy-REF-REM.PAST

jeeCC=kwana=keE. here=PL=LIG
‘(Nowadays) we buy big cooking pots, these ones (that you can see in the corner of the house).’ ci118

b. [KaretuD dijiE siriF=eke] =tuCS

cart

path old=PERL =3SG(-FM)

paji-daCC hard-ASF

‘(Let’s go) through the old cart path as it is dry (lit. hard) (unlike the new path which is full of water).’ ka283

2 — ebari ‘big’ (only) is the only attributive adjective that was found combined with another attributive adjective: baba ‘unique’, in (13.26a) and turu ‘big male’, as in (13.26b). Note that in these combinations, ebari always comes last.

4 Recall that the symbol subscript ‘E’ refers to the E (extended core argument) function the NP has within the clause (as opposed to superscript ‘E’ which refers to the E slot in the NP structure).

482 (13.26) a. [Ebadeki baba ebari]S ani-ya [Hermano Antonio=ja].
hammock unique big be-IMPFV brother Antonio=DAT
‘Brother Antonio has an exceptionally big hammock.’ n5.0527

coati big.male big =3SG-FM (=1SG-ERG) saltlick=LOC

ba-nati-kware. see-GO.TEMP-REM.PAST ‘I saw a big male coati in a saltlick.’ mj119

3 — attributive adjectives consist of bare roots which cannot take any affixes, be reduplicated, be negated, or take modifiers (such as dyake ‘very’ which can be used with predicative adjectives; §11.1.2); 4 — nothing can intervene between the adjective and the head noun; 5 — attributive adjectives (unlike predicative adjectives) do not have additional functions. For example, they cannot be used predicatively (as copula clause complement or secondary predicates) or adverbially; 6 — attributive adjectives obligatorily require a head noun (in slot E).

13.2.2. Semantics
Some attributive adjectives are used very productively and clearly have a modifying meaning: ebari ‘big and strong’, kaka ‘small and round’, baba ‘unique’, wiri ‘tiny’, nana ‘baby’ and siri ‘old’. The remaining adjectives are rarely found and most often have lexicalised meanings. The first type of (productive) attributive adjectives are discussed first.

The adjective kaka (possibly historically related to e-noun -kaka ‘small and round fruit’) refers to small and round/plump entities. It is exemplified in (13.27):

(13.27) a. … =tuS

bute-ti-kware

[bei kaka=ju]

=3SG(-FM) go.down-GO.TEMP-REM.PAST lake small.and.round=LOC

here-LOC =3PROX.SG(-FM) NPF.stream small.and.round lie-IMPFV

‘Here there is (lit. lies) a good little stream (where we can fetch some water for drinking).’ ka309

Other nouns found modified by kaka are shown in (13.28a). The three nouns in

(13.28b), according to Emerenciano Sepa, are not really compatible with kaka

(presumably because they can only refer to thin elongated entities):

(13.28) a. kawayu kaka ‘small and plump horse’

jae kaka

‘small and plump fish’

kuchi kaka

‘small and plump pig’

kuchiru kaka ‘small knife’

kwaba kaka

akwi kaka

‘small tree’

b. (?) matuja kaka (?) bakwa kaka (?) nanata kaka

(small and plump cayman) (small and plump viper) (small and plump electric eel)

The adjective wiri (related to da-adjective wiri-) refers to very small, skinny, elongated, and frail entities, as shown in (13.29)

(13.29) a. [Wiwipa wiri=ra]A =taa =ØO

dunu-wa.

‘He is riding (lit. passing with) a very skinny horse.’ n5.0507

Other nouns modified by wiri are shown in (13.30a). The noun epu ‘village’, according

to Emerenciano Sepa cannot be modified by wiri as shown in (13.30b):

(13.30) a. kawayu wiri

‘frail horse’

matuja wiri

b. *epu wiri

The adjective nana refers to recently born/created entities or entities at the earliest stage of their development, as in (13.31):

(13.31) a. ChuruO bonnet

[ebakwa nana=ja] pa-a! child baby=GEN HORT.SG-affect

Other nouns found with nana are given in (13.32a). The adjective nana was not

485

accepted by Emerenciano Sepa with the two nouns given in (13.32b) (possibly

because ‘stream’ and ‘lake’ are not conceived (at least from a Cavineña point of view)

as being born/created):

(13.32) a. tsabuna nana ‘baby tucunaré fish’

sawa nana

‘baby benton fish’

ebakwa nana ‘baby’

amatsa nana ‘baby motacucillo palm’

‘new year’

yawa nana

‘earth at creation time’

b. *espere nana *bei nana

The adjective siri ‘old’ is used to refer to old entities, as shown in (13.33):

(13.33) a. … [tujuri

ka-rama-ti. REF-cover-REF

Iji-ume! drink-IMP.SG.NEG

‘This is old water. Don’t drink it!’ n5.0475

Other words found with siri are given in (13.34):

(13.34)

486 ‘old Navi (Navi is a proper name)’ ‘old ox’ ‘old pampa (which has not been burnt for a long time’ ‘old things’ ‘old ax’ ‘old house’ ‘old path (not used any more)’ ‘old story’

(Note that siri can refer to both animate and inanimate entities.)

The adjective baba (most likely historically related to kinship noun baba ‘grandfather’) is used with entities which are old, big, respected, exception, unique of their type. It is often used with old male animals — apparently typically monkeys — that wander alone (away from their group) as in (13.35a). But baba can also be used to refer to things. Emerenciano Sepa volunteered (13.26a) (repeated), referring to the author’s hammock which was way bigger than anything he had every seen before:

(13.35) a. … ari-daCC ju-kware ajaCS.

‘Brother Antonio has an exceptionally big hammock.’ n5.0527

In (13.36a), we show other nouns which were found or elicited with baba. In (13.36b) we show a few nouns that are incompatible with baba (according to Emerenciano Sepa; the reasons why such combinations were not accepted are unknown):

487

The attributive adjective ebari refers to big and/or strong entities. It is illustrated in (13.37):

The noun eweebari ‘adolescent’ is likely based on the (lexicalised) attributive adjective ebari (note that ewe does not occur independently in present day Cavineña).

The remaining adjectives are most often lexicalised. Rare examples showing their use as modifiers are given in (13.39) and (13.26b) (repeated):

Attributive adjectives (other than ebari ‘big and strong’, kaka ‘small and round’,

baba ‘unique’, wiri ‘tiny’, nana ‘baby’ and siri ‘old’) tend to form lexicalised

expressions with the noun they accompany, in which case the noun-adjective

combination refers to a unitary concept (typically animal or plant species) and the

adjective does not, strictly speaking, ‘modify’ the head noun. Examples are given at

490 Morpho-syntactic evidence for lexicalisation can be found in the fact that when a noun-adjective sequence is lexicalised, the adjective (apparently — this needs to be verified with more examples) can go together with the noun in slot D (recall that slot D must consist of bare roots; §13.1.1), as with sewe in (13.41):

The strength of the bond between attributive adjectives and their modified noun and the fact that most attributive adjectives have corresponding morphemes within other word classes could suggest alternative analyses in terms of suffixes or root compounding. In this study, we have preferred to treat attributive adjectives as phonologically and syntactically independent modifiers on the following basis: 1 — attributive adjectives are prosodically independent (they receive an independent Hn(M)M contour; see §2.8) and a pause is possible between the adjective and the noun.

492
2 — syntactically and semantically, (at least) some attributive adjectives (e.g., kaka ‘round and small’, ebari ‘big’, siri ‘old’, etc.) are very productive and their combination with nouns has compositional meanings.

13.3. Number markers (slot G)
Cavineña has three number markers: dual marker =ekatse ‘DL’, plural =kwana ‘PL’ (general plural marker) and =ekana ‘PL’ (plural marker of kinship nouns possessed by first and second persons). (Note that Cavineña also has numeral lexemes. These belong to the quantifier word class; §13.5.)

13.3.1. Syntax
Number markers have the following morpho-syntactic properties: 1 — number markers consist of bare roots which cannot take any affixes or be reduplicated; 2 — number markers are enclitics (they do not receive an independent Hn(M)M pitch contour; §2.8); 3 — number markers occur in slot G or the predicate. Examples of number marker cooccurring with other NP modifiers are given in (13.43):

(13.43) a. [BetaB beiE kakaF=ekatseG]CS =tuCS two lake small.and.round=DL =3SG(-FM)

‘There are two small and round lakes in the two pampa woods.’5 ms015

b. Ba-ti-kware

5 Note that this example is an exception to the rule of e- prefix deletion when a noun is in slot D modifying an e-noun as NP head (see discussion in §12.3.2).

There is a very interesting interaction between possessor inflections of kinship nouns (§12.4) and the =kwana plural marker. When this marker pluralises a kinship noun possessed by a 3rd person (thus with the cicumfix e-…=ke ‘3’), then =kwana obligatorily attaches directly to the kinship root and the =ke part of the circumfix attaches to =kwana. This is shown in (13.44):

4 — Number markers (unlike juxtaposed nouns or attributive adjectives) do not require the NP head to be overtly expressed. They do however require a host (to which they attach to form a full phonological word). In other words, number markers cannot be the sole element in an NP. The host has to be an NP constituent. In (13.46), we illustrate number markers attaching on various types of NP constituent hosts: quantifier peya ‘other’ (slot B) in (13.46a) and relative clause in (13.46b):

(13.46) a. PeyaB=kwanaG=ra=kamadya =tuO

‘Where did the two (men) who had returned first sleep?’ ts059

There is another very interesting interaction between the =kwana plural marker and the ligature marker =ke (marking relative clauses; see §20.2.2). Quite similarly to its behavior with the =ke part of the e-…=ke ‘3’ possessor circumfix inflection, =kwana precedes (not follows as would otherwise be expected) the ligature marker =ke. This is illustrated in (13.47):
(13.47) a. [[Misión.Cavina=ju] ani-ya=kwana=ke]S (*ani-ya=ke=kwana) Misión.Cavinas=LOC sit-IMPFV=PL=LIG

Note that this does not happen with the dual marker, where the order =ke=ekatse is found (as expected). This is shown in (13.48):

The markers =ekatse ‘DL’ and =kwana ‘PL’ are used with any types of nouns (i.e., e-nouns, kinship and independent nouns). When it comes to kinship nouns, they can be used no matter what the possessor is.

The marker =ekana ‘PL’, on the other hand, has a very restricted distribution. First, it is only used with kinship terms. Secondly, it is only used with kinship term possessed by a 1st or (to a lesser extent) 2nd person. The examples in (13.49) show =ekana on kinship nouns possessed by a 1st person:

(13.49) a. [E-kwe e-bakwa=ekana]CS =tuCS

uma-daCC ju-kware.

(When I arrived home after a long journey,) my daughters surrounded me.’ ka541

In the available texts, kinship terms possessed by a second person are only pluralised with =kwana ‘PL’ (as in (13.50a)). However, Alfredo Tavo accepted (13.50b) (with =ekana) as an alternative to (13.50a):
(13.50) a. [Mi-kwe baba=kwana]CS =tunaCS ejebuchaCC ju-kware? 2SG-GEN grand.father=PL =3PL INT:SIMLR be-REM.PAST

Kinship terms possessed by a 3rd person can only be pluralised with =kwana, as shown in (13.51a) and the ungrammatical examples in (13.51a) and (13.51b):

(13.51) a. [Tu-ja e-baba=kwana=ke]CS =tuCS

n5.0248

Non-kinship nouns can be pluralised with =kwana (as in (13.52a)) but not with =ekana, as shown by ungrammatical (13.52b):

497

(13.52) a. Takure=kwanaCS =e-kwe uma-daCC ju-kware.

chicken=PL

=1SG-DAT many-ASF be-REM.PAST

n5.0252

Similarly, *chapa=ekana (dog=PL) was not accepted by Alfredo Tavo. Alfredo also refused =kwana on non-kinship nouns even though they refer to human entities such as *ekwita=ekana (person=PL), *e-puna=ekana (NPF-woman=PL) and *ata=ekana (relative=PL).

The following Table 13.1 summarises how each number marker is used:

Table 13.1: Distributional restrictions on plural markers

=ekatse ‘DL’ =kwana ‘PL’ =ekana ‘PL’

kinship noun yes (e.g., (13.45a,b)) yes (e.g., (13.50a), (13.51a) only 1st and 2nd person possessed (e.g., (13.49a,b,c), (13.50b))

Independent nouns and e-nouns yes (e.g., (13.43a)) yes (e.g., (13.43b), (13.56b) no

Although number tends to be marked in many cases, it is not an obligatory category of the NP. A noun can be left unmarked and still refer to dual or plural referents.

In (13.53), Cosme Mayo relates an encounter with a ferocious anteater during a hunting expedition. His (six) dogs attacked the anteater. Cosme refers to the dogs with overt plural marking in (13.53a) but not in (13.53b):

In (13.55), Victoria Tavo relates how she was conducting a pair of oxen (pulling a cart). She sometimes refers to them as juye=ekatse (ox=DL) (13.55a) but sometimes just as juye ‘ox’ (as in (13.55b):

13.3.2. Semantics
Number markers most often have a strict plural meaning (and can be satisfactorily translated by a plural in English). But this is not always the case. In some cases, number markers (at least =kwana and =ekatse) can have an ‘associative’ meaning. As such the referent of the noun marked with a number marker is associated with one (in the case of =ekatse) or multiple (in the case of =kwana) entities that are typically associated with

499 it. Two illustrative examples of =kwana ‘PL’ with an associative meaning are given in (13.56):

‘Even though I’ve travelled (lit. come) in the cart (i.e. I have not walked), my lower back (*lower backs) area hurts.’ ka546

Examples of the marker =ekatse with an associative meaning are given in (13.57):

(13.57) a. [Ebakwa maju-wa=ju] =tuO

1SG-GEN father-AFFTN=DL =3SG(-FM) become.sick=FOC be-REM.PAST

‘My parents (lit. my daddy and associated person) (lit. *fathers) were sick.’ sl004

6 Note that in this example, the kinship term tata has become an independent noun by taking the derivation suffix -chi

500

No examples were found with =ekana with an associative meaning. Note that no examples were found either of an associative meaning with =kwana or =ekatse for proper names.

In some cases the plural marker =kwana has a distributive effect (possibly only with mass nouns although this needs to be double-checked). The entity referred to by the mass noun is distributed over different places. This is the case with -na ‘water’ in (13.58a) and yachi ‘pampa’ (in (13.58b)):

(13.58) a. Ani-ya=jari e-na=kwana sit-IMPFV=STILL NPF-water=PL

e-diji=ju? NPF-path=LOC

‘Is there still water (*waters) along (lit. in various parts of) the path?’ n3.0063a

pampa=PL

‘I looked around at the area, at the pampa (*pampas) (scattered in various places).’ ka040

Yet in some cases, =kwana means that the referent is composed of a collection of various entities. When translating (13.59) below, I was told by Emerenciano Sepa that by using tapeke=kwana, the author (Victoria Tavo) meant some elements that typically composes trip food (such as rice, manioc, meat, etc.):

(13.59)

Tapeke=kwanaO =mi-raA =ØO

trip.food=PL

=2SG-ERG (=1SG-FM)

baka-wa. ask.for-PERF

‘You asked me about (lit. for) trip food (i.e. whether we had prepared anything to eat during the trip).’ ka160

Note that the plural marker =kwana ‘PL’ is possibly historically related to the phrasal particle =kwana ‘UNCERT’ (§17.16), although the semantic connection is not
‘AFFTN’. This explains why it does not take any possessor inflections.

501 very straightforward. Note also that corresponding to =ekatse ‘DL’ and =ekana ‘PL’ are two pronouns, ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘3PL’ (see §15.6).

13.4. Genitive modifier (slot C) A genitive modifier goes into slot C of the NP structure. It consists of a(n) embedded NP marked by the genitive enclitic =ja or a genitive pronoun (§13.4.1).
Genitive modification encodes a range of semantic relations that hold between (normally) referential entities (§13.4.2).
There is some semantic overlap between genitive modification and noun juxtaposition modification (§13.4.3).
Quite interestingly, the genitive marker =ja is homophonous with the dative marker =ja ‘DAT’. A discussion of the differences is in §14.3.3.

13.4.1. Syntax
A genitive constituent has the following morpho-syntactic properties: 1 — a genitive modifier (either phrasal or pronominal) fills slot C of the NP structure. Examples of a genitive modifier co-occurring with other NP modifiers are shown at (13.60) and (13.43b) (repeated):

2 — a genitive modifier consists of either an embedded noun phrase or a genitive pronoun.

Rosalino, Rosalino, ju-eti-wa

=taa [yatse-jaC juje]S.

Rosalino Rosalino be-COME.PERM-PERF =EMPH 1DL-GEN duck

‘(My wife came to me and said:) Rosalino, Rosalino, our (dl) duck (that was lost) has come back.’ ju025

3 — a genitive modifier (similarly to a juxtaposed noun or an attributive adjective) requires an overt head noun (slot E).
However, there is an alternative strategy which allows to express ‘mine, yours, John’s,

504 the man’s, etc.’. The strategy consists in using a dative oblique phrase (§14.3) within a (copula) relative clause (slot H). This is shown in (13.64):

(13.64) a. Tu-eke =tu-keO =ØA

noticiaO baka-tsa-kware

there-PERL =3SG-FM (=1SG-ERG) news

hear-COME(O)-REM.PAST

[e-kwe mamita=jaCC=ke]O. 1SG-GEN mummy=DAT=LIG
‘Then I heard the news, my mummy’s (news; saying that she had passed away).’ mj010

b. [JeeCC=ke kamisa]CS =riCS

tu-jaCC=keCC.

here=LIG shirt

=3PROX.SG(-FM) 3SG-DAT=LIG

‘This shirt is his.’ di2723

Note that dative phrases are marked by =ja ‘DAT’ which, as we mentioned earlier, is homophonous with =ja ‘GEN’. One could speculate whether the headless ja-phrases in (13.64) above are not simply genitive phrases. In this study, we have preferred the (oblique) dative-and-RC analysis based on the fact that it is quite common for an oblique phrase to be relativised (within copula clauses) whereas with the genitive analysis, the presence of the (obligatory) =ke morpheme is left unaccounted for.

13.4.2. Semantics
Genitive phrases are used for coding the following semantic relations: 1 — interpersonal relations (including — but not restrictive to — kinship relations), as in (13.65a) (NP head is a kinship term) and (13.65b) (NP head is an independent noun):

(13.65) a. [Malili=ja e-bakujuna=ke=ra]A =ØO

See also ‘scorpion sting’ (13.61a) and ‘their language’ in (T1.74).

13.4.3. Genitive modifier vs. juxtaposed noun It was noted that a juxtaposed noun (slot D; §13.1) and a genitive modifier both allow a noun to modify another noun.
Note first these are two clearly different constructions morpho-syntactically: 1 — a genitive modifier goes into slot C while a juxtaposed noun goes into slot D; 2 — a genitive modifier consists of a(n) embedded NP or a pronoun. A juxtaposed noun can only be a bare noun;
Semantically, some (but not all, see below) relations coded by these two constructions are different:

507 1 — only a juxtaposed noun can code classification, location, naming or time relations; 2 — only a genitive modifier can code interpersonal or ownership relations.

However, both construction can code whole-part and user/creator relations. Still the resulting semantics are most often not identical. Noun juxtaposition is used to categorise, in other words to indicate that the type of entity that is being referred to by the head nominal. A juxtaposed noun is never referentially independent from the head noun. A juxtaposed noun cannot be independently modified. Moreover, it is impossible to juxtapose a pronoun. When coding whole-part relations, the whole has a generic meaning. In (13.13), for example the flesh refers to ‘any deer’ or ‘any cow’. Genitive modification is used to code relations between entities that are (normally) referentially distinct. A noun in genitive function can be modified independently from the NP head noun. A genitive modifier can be a pronoun. When coding whole-part relations, the whole normally refers to a particular (i.e., specific and referential) entity that the speaker has in mind, such as ‘the soldier’ in (13.67a) or ‘the van’ in (13.67c).

The semantic contrast between the juxtaposition construction and the genitive construction is further illustrated by the pair in (13.70) (volunteered by Alfredo Tavo):

(13.70) a. Apuna-ya=ju baka-takiCC [dii

tsuri]CS.

darken-IMPFV=DS hear-ABIL mosquito voice

‘When night falls (lit. when it gets dark), mosquito noise can be heard.’ n5.0319

b. Tujuri=duku

=tu-keO =ØA

baka-wa

mosquito.net=INSIDE =3SG-FM (=1SG-ERG) hear-PERF

[dii=ja

e-tsuri]O.

mosquito=GEN NPF-voice

‘Inside my mosquito net I heard the noise of a mosquito (that had managed to enter).’ n5.0320

Note that in some cases, a genitive modifier appears to be generic. This is found in sentences (often from the dictionary) describing/making a generic statement about a

508 particular animal or plant as in (13.67b) (repeated) and (13.71):
(13.67b) [Takure=ja e-ka]CS ji-daCC [ara=ishu katyati=ishu jadya]. chicken=GEN NPF-egg good-ASF eat=PURP.GNL sell=PURP.GNL and ‘Chicken eggs are good to eat or sell.’ di0859

(13.71)

[Jae=ja fish=GEN

e-bebakwa]CC =tuCS

jumuru-daCC.

NPF-back

=3SG(-FM) hunched-ASF

‘Fish have a hunched back (lit. the fish’s back is hunched).’ di1816

In (13.72) (a conversational turn constructed by Alfredo Tavo), an answer to a question about a type of intestines (the question makes use of the juxtaposition construction with interrogative noun ai ‘INT’ in slot D) can equally make use of the juxtaposition construction or the genitive construction:
(13.72) A: [Ai sere] tume? INT intestin there ‘What sort of intestins are those?

B: [Waka sere]

/

cow intestin

[waka=ja e-sere]. cow=GEN NPF-intestin

Both: ‘(Those are) cow intestins.’ n5.0325

Alfredo Tavo did not seem to see any meaning difference between the two possible answers in (13.72). It should be pointed out that whereas a genitive modifier can have a generic sense, a juxtaposed noun cannot have a specific referent. In other words, the two construction still remain quite different in terms of specificity.

13.5. Quantifiers (slot B)
The class of quantifiers includes four logical quantifiers (in (13.73a)), 10 numerals (in (13.73b)), a quantifier question marker (in (13.73c) and the word meaning ‘other, another’ (in (13.73d):

509

(13.73) a. dutya

‘all’

umada/jetiama ‘many’7

umae

‘a few’

b. peadya ‘one’ beta ‘two’ kimisha ‘three’ pushi ‘four’ pishika ‘five’

shukuta

‘six’

pakaruku

‘seven’

kimisakaruku ‘eight’

puskuruku ‘nine’

tunka

‘ten’

c. ejeuma ‘how many/much’

d. peya ‘other’

Note that three quantifiers have corresponding (and are most probably historically related to) predicative adjectives. Umada (and possibly umae) and ejeuma correspond to the da-adjective uma ‘many, a lot’ (with the dummy suffix -da ‘ASF’ with the first and interrogative prefix eje- ‘INT’ with the second). Jetiama correspond to the predicative adjective adjective jetiama ‘many, a lot’.

In (13.74) we illustrate a number of logical quantifiers:

(13.74) a. [Dutya uu=kwana]CS =pa

all

animal=PL =REP

ushuri=tereCC ju-kware. skinny=ONLY be-REM.PAST

‘All the animals were very skinny (because they had not eaten for days).’ ti005b

b. Ani-kware tuna-ja [jetiama jae]S…

sit-REM.PAST 3PL-DAT many

fish

‘(When we arrived there, the villagers had been fishing and) they had many fish (lit. many fish sat to them).’ co008

7 These two logical quantifiers are interchangeable without any meaning differences (compare for example (13.74b) and (13.74c)). Speakers have commented that umada was used in the past more than nowadays. I also observed that jetiama was preferentially used in Galilea (a modern community close to the town of Riberalta) while umada was

over.there=LIG NPF-forest=LOC =3SG(-FM) other NPF.stream

jara-nuka-ya. lie-REITR-IMPFV ‘In that forest is (lit. lies) another stream.’ ft043

The quantifier question marker is illustrated in (13.77):

most often used in Mision Cavinas (a very remote and more traditional community).

511

(13.77) [Ejeuma tedu]O =tatseA

‘How many turkeys did they (dl) see?’ gr011

Quantifiers have the following morpho-syntactic properties: 1 — quantifiers occur in slot B of the NP structure. Example showing the quantifier dutya ‘all’ co-occurring with other NP modifiers are shown in (13.78);

(13.78) a. [DutyaB tu-jaC kasaE=tsewe] kueti-kware e-puna=ekatse=eke.

2 — quantifiers are bare roots (but see counting formula further below). They cannot take affixes or be reduplicated;

3 — quantifiers do not require an overt NP head. They can be the sole element of an NP (although not the head) as illustrated in (13.79):

(13.79) a. Dutya=raA =tu-keO =ekwanaA adeba-ya all=ERG =3SG-FM =1PL(-ERG) know-IMPFV

d. PeyaCS =tuCS another =3SG(-FM)

yachi=juCC=keCC. pampa=LOC=LIG

‘Another (type of hunting) is one in the pampa.’ ct097

Note that this is not to say that quantifiers are heading the NP. This is so because an underlying head noun is always recoverable. Recovering the ellipsed head noun can depend on anaphora. In (13.79b), (13.79c) and (13.79d), the ellipsed nouns ‘jungle meat’, ‘the type of hunting’ and ‘chicken’ respectively, are topics within stretches of discourse preceding these examples. Recovering the ellipsed head noun can also depend on the immediate context. In (13.79a), the head noun refers to an entity that is present in the speech situation (including the speaker himself). Note that in this example, the identity of the head noun is also recovered from the bound pronoun =ekwana.

In afterthought situations, the referent of an ellipsed head can be overtly expressed by a noun within a different NP (in apposition) in the same sentence as the quantifier. This is seen in the two examples in (13.80):

(13.80) a. Ikwene =yatseA

e-tapananaO kemi-ya betaO.

first =1DL(-ERG) NPF-palm.shoot take-IMPFV two

‘(In order to make baskets, we) first fetch (lit. take) palm shoots, two (palm shoots).’ ab035

b. [TumeCC=ke espere=ju=nuka=dya]

513 ari-daCC=ke]]O. big-ASF=LIG

‘In that same stream, we saw another one (benton fish), (a very big benton fish.’ ft027

One might want to analyse the quantifiers in these examples as ‘floating quantifiers’ as found many languages such Japanese, Korean, Tsotzil, Lakhota and Pima (UtoAztecan) (see Munro 1984, Downing 1993). In this study, we have not retained this analysis for the reason that in Cavineña, not only quantifiers, but also relative clauses (although not juxtaposed nouns or attributive adjectives) can occur ‘away’ from their head (i.e. not in their respective slots) whereas ‘floating’ is normally restricted to quantifiers only.

For counting from ten to a ninety-nine, there appear to have been a formula

(which is remembered by some speakers, but is not used nowadays) which makes use of the numeral tunka ‘ten’ and a word earakana ‘unit’8. The formula is ‘X tunka Y

erarakana’ (lit. X ten and Y unit(s)) where X and Y are filled by one of the above

numerals from 1 to 9. The system is illustrated in (13.81):

(13.81) a. peadya tunka peadya earakana ‘eleven (lit. one ten one unit)’

peadya tunka beta earakana

‘twelve (lit. one ten two units)’

peadya tunka kimisha earakana ‘thirteen (lit. one ten three units)’

etc.

b. beta tunka beta tunka peadya earakana beta tunka beta earakana etc.

‘twenty (lit. two ten)’ ‘twenty one (lit. two ten one unit)’ ‘twenty two (lit. two ten two units)’

8 Note that the glossing ‘unit’ given to earakana is tentative as this word is never used outside of the counting formula.

514

c. kimisha tunka

‘thirty (lit. three ten)’

kimisha tunka peadya earakana ‘thirty one (lit. three ten one unit)’

kimisha tunka beta earakana ‘thirty two (lit. two ten two units)’

etc.

An example is at (13.82):

(13.82)

Tua-tsewe =tunaS ju-chine 3SG-ASSOC =3PL be-REC.PAST

[[peadya tunka shukuta earakana] alumno=dyane]S.

one

ten six

unit

student=APPROX

‘With him, there are about sixteen students.’ di2759

Nobody counts using the formula. Many speakers are not even aware of it. Present day Cavineña speakers use Spanish numerals instead: once ‘eleven’, doce ‘twelve’, veinte ‘twenty’, etc. (which all consist of one word). Similarly, counting above ninety-nine is only done with Spanish numerals (cien ‘hundred’, mil ‘thousand’, millión ‘million, etc.).

In (at least) one example, in (13.83) below, we found a quantifying phrase modifying the head of a NP.

(13.83)

[E-kwe e-bakujunaO [ara-kara ju-ya]

ask.for-CAUS-IMPFV four

spoon

butter

‘Because my daughter is hungry, I am having you (dl) asked for four spoons of butter.’ di1932

This could indicate that not only single quantifier words or counting formula can fill slot B of the NP structure but a number of more complex phrases (used for measuring mass nouns for example, as appears to be the case in (13.83)). However, we will remain very cautious before making this statement. First, note that the quantifying phrase (as well as the NP head) in (13.83) only involve borrowed words from Spanish. Second, this is the only example showing a quantifying phrase in slot B in the available data. Third, Cavineña normally uses postpositional phrases for the purpose of quantifying

515 mass nouns (or entities with ‘mass’ semantics) (see §14.8.2).

With the exception of peadya ‘one’ and beta ‘two’, all numerals are clearly

borrowings from Aymara. Note that Quechua also has numerals very similar in shape to

Aymara and could have been a potential source language as well. However, there are

Quechua numbers which are clearly different from Aymara and Cavineña. This

indicates that Cavineña has rather borrowed from Aymara than Quechua. In (13.84), we

provide the list of numerals in the three languages (the Aymara and Quechua numerals which substantially differ from Cavineña are in bold face).9

It should be noted that apart from peadya ‘one’ and beta ‘two’ (and perhaps kimisha ‘three’, pushi ‘four’ and pishika ‘five’ and tunka ‘ten’), the other numbers are hardly ever used or even remembered. Note that Cavineña does not have a proper term for zero. In this case, they would use Spanish cero ‘zero’.

13.6. Relative clause modifier (slots A or H) A relative clause (RC) consists of a finite clause (i.e. a clause whose verb takes an inflectional suffix) that modifies the head of an NP. RCs are marked by the ligature enclitic =ke ‘LIG’ that attaches to the last phonological word of the RC. A RC goes into
9 I thank Willem Adelaar for providing me with the Aymara and Quechua numerals. 10 Note that these two words are pronounced similarly in Aymara and Quechua although they have different spellings (W. Adelaar, pc.).

516 slot A or H of the NP structure. A brief discussion of RC morpho-syntactic properties is in §13.6. (A full discussion of RC is in Chapter 20.)

13.6.1. Syntax
RC have the following morpho-syntactic properties: 1 — the most common position for a RC is postposed to the head in slot H of the NP structure. (RCs can also be found preposed to the head. This is discussed in §13.6.2.) RCs in slot H co-occurring with different types of NP modifiers are shown in (13.85) and (repeated) (13.43b):

3PL-GEN bedding=PL

RES-burn=LIG

‘all their bedding that had burnt’ fg027

2 — a verbal RC such as (13.85) consists of a finite clause. The RC predicate is inflected with a TAM suffix such as -kware in (13.85a) (and can take any noninflectional suffixes). The same range of constituents (e.g., core arguments, oblique phrases, independent particles, subordinate clauses as in (13.85a), etc.) that can be found in a main clause can be used in a RC, with the exception of second position clitics (2nd position particles (§16.3) and bound pronouns (§15.2)). Another example of a

517 verbal RC is (13.86) showing the imperfective verbal inflection -ya ‘IMPFV’ and an independent pronoun in O function:

‘(When I went sleeping, I didn’t know that) there was a (vampire) bat that was going to suck me (during my sleep).’ bi016

3 — a copula (as opposed to verbal) RC typically only consists of a copula complement (i.e. the copula verb is most often — but not obligatorily — omitted) and the marker =ke ‘LIG’. Examples are at (13.87):

Copula RCs allow oblique phrases (locative, associative, dative) to become NP modifiers, as in (13.88):

518 Copula RCs allow (peripheral) demonstratives (jee ‘here’, tume ‘there’, etc.) to be used as modifiers of an NP head (Cavineña does not have specific NP demonstratives). This is discussed in §13.6.2.

4 — the ligature =ke is deleted when it occurs in the same clitic sequence with a postposition and when it precedes the postposition. This happens in (13.89) where a copula RC modifies a noun (bina ‘bat’) within an A NP (marked by the ergative postposition =ra ‘ERG’):

5 — when the plural marker =kwana ‘PL’ (but not dual marker =ekatse) follows a RC (this happens when the head the head of the NP is omitted) the ligature =ke follows =kwana (it does not precede it as otherwise expected), as in (13.47a) (repeated):

6 — a RC does not require an overt NP head as in (13.17), (13.46b), (13.47a), etc.
7 — a RC can be either externally headed (the common argument (CA) is stated within the main clause (MC)) or internally headed (the CA is stated within the RC). In §20.3, we present a number of tests (constituency, nature of CA, case marking) that help to decide whether a RC is externally or internally headed.
The RC in (13.85b) is externally headed because the CA (bina ‘bat’) is absolutively marked (according to its CS function within the MC) whereas it should be ergatively marked if its A function within the RC had been coded.

519

The RC in (13.90) is internally marked because the CA (e-tare ‘NPF-house’) occurs between immediate constituents of the RC:

13.6.2. RC preposed to the head
RCs are also found preceding the NP head (in a tentatively set up slot A), as illustrated in (13.91) (see also Galilea epu=ju=ke waraji ‘the leader of the village of Galilea’ in (13.9):

Verbal RCs preposed to the head, such as those in (13.91), are rare (they normally occur in slot H). However, the position before the NP head is actually the obligatory position for a number of copula RCs, notably demonstrative RCs and interrogative RCs. These two types of RCs are discussed in turn below.
There is a very interesting use of the RC construction as a strategy to code NP demonstratives. Cavineña has specific peripheral demonstratives (i.e. demonstratives used at the clause level such as English ‘here’ or ‘there’; see §§15.7-8) but lacks

520 specific NP demonstratives (i.e. demonstratives used at the NP level such as English ‘this’ or ‘that’). One way the language codes the equivalent of a NP demonstrative is by using a peripheral demonstrative within copula RC in slot A (never in slot H) (somehow like English ‘the man who is here/there’).

In (13.92), we give examples of copula RCs with each of the four peripheral demonstratives:
(13.92) a. [JeeCC=ke ebakwapiji=ra=dya]A =yatseO duju-chine. here=LIG small.child=ERG=FOC] =1DL take-REC.PAST ‘This small child (whom we can see on the photo) took us (in his canoe, to cross the river).’ ft010

11 Note that jee and riya are synonymous (see §15.8.1).

521

A case could be made for treating NP demonstrative constructions as distinct from (copula) relative clauses. Note that never is the copula verb ju- ‘be’ (or any other verb) nor any other clausal constituent attested within NP demonstratives (i.e. NP demonstratives only consist of a bare peripheral demonstratives root and the marker =ke). One can therefore question whether these constructions are clauses at all.

However, striking similarities between NP demonstratives and RCs made us retain the (copula) RC analysis, as follows: 1 — NP demonstratives are preposed to the NP head, similarly to some preposed RC (as in (13.91); in slot A); 2 — NP demonstratives, similarity to RCs, do not require an overt NP head, as in (13.93):

(13.93)

‘That (burgo bird that you have over there in the corner of your house) is (called) “uru” in my language.’ pa074

(See also jee=ke ‘this (person)’ in (13.9).)

3 — NP demonstratives are structurally complex. They consist of a bare root and an obligatory marker =ke.

The bare demonstratives roots (without =ke) are also found used as peripheral demonstratives, as with yume ‘over there’ in (13.94):

(13.94)

Yume =taa waka=kwanaS over.there =EMPH cow=PL

jetiama ani-ya. many sit-IMPFV

‘Over there, there are many cows (lit. the cows sit many).’ zo039

The marker =ke behaves similarly to the morpheme =ke ‘LIG’ that marks RCs, as follows. It is deleted when it occurs in the same clitic sequence with a postposition and precedes the postposition, as in (13.95):

(13.95) a. Ai=raA =miO INT=ERG =2SG(-FM)

If the plural enclitic =kwana is used and the NP head is ellipsed, then =ke has to follow =kwana (not precede, as otherwise expected) if present, as in (13.96) (this is (T1.88)):

A second type of RC obligatory preposed to the NP head are copula interrogative RCs based on the word eje ‘INT’ and the ligature marker =ke. These are used to question the identity of a referent (roughly equivalent to English ‘which’) (as in (13.97)) or to code the fact that a referent has a generic identity (roughly equivalent to English ‘any’ (as in (13.98):

(13.97)

The copula interrogative RC construction has basically the same properties as any RC: 1 — a copula interrogative RC is preposed to the NP head, which is a position attested with other types of RC (slot A); 2 — a copula interrogative RC, similarity to RCs, does not require an overt NP head, as shown in (13.99):

3 — if the NP is headless and the plural marker =kwana ‘PL’ is used, the marker =ke (as happens with RCs) follows =kwana (contrarily to the otherwise expected order =ke=kwana) as in (13.100):

‘(The teacher asked the students:) which one has a book? (lit. To which one does a book sit?). (A student responds:) I have a book (lit. A book sits to me).’ n1.0389

It should be noted that the word eje is only found within the copula interrogative RC construction (there is also an interrogative prefix eje- attaching to da-adjectives; §11.2.3). It is not found anywhere else.

RCs preposed to the NP head (whether verbal or copula) hardly ever co-occur with any other types of modifiers preposed to the NP head — quantifiers (slot B), genitive modifier (slot C) or juxtaposed nouns (slot D). The rare example in (13.102) where a (demonstrative) RC precedes a genitive modifier suggests that a RC preposed to the NP head belongs to a slot further away from the head than C:

(13.102) [TumeCC=keA tu-jaC kasaE=tsewe=dya] =tu-ja

affect-ALWS person

betsa-ya=ju. swim-IMPFV=DS

‘(The electic eel has a lot of strength.) With that strength of his, it can kill people when they are swimming.’ ag003

We could not find any example where a RC preposed to the NP head co-occur with a

525 quantifier (slot B) so that one could speculate whether they could belong to the same slot (B) (and be mutually exclusive). In this work, we have preferred setting up a provisional slot A (further away from slot B) because: 1 — quantifier and RC are very different structurally; 2 — there is a general tendency in Cavineña for different types of words/constituents to have their own structural slot; 3 — semantically, there are no cogent reason why they should be exclusive of each other (e.g. ‘these three men’).

13.6.3. Semantics RCs can have restrictive meanings (helping to identify a unique referent among a choice of possible referents). In (13.103), both (demonstrative copula) RCs preposed to the NP head and RCs postposed to the NP head have a restrictive meaning (see also (13.85a)):
(13.103) [JeeCC=ke ebakwapiji [kwaba=ju ani-ya=ke]]CS [Ermo bakani]CC. here=LIG small.child canoe=LOC sit-IMPFV=LIG Ermo name ‘This small child (on the photo) who is sitting in a canoe is named Ermo.’ ft009

RCs can also have non-restrictive meanings (the CA already has unique reference and the RC simply provides additional information on that referent) (a good example is at (13.87a)).

RC can also have adverbial meanings (they sometimes can only be translated by adverbial clauses in English) as in (13.104) (see also (13.17) with a discontinous RC):

(13.104) [JuyeO kanajara-sha-ya=ke]S =yatseS

14 Postpositions

Cavineña is a dependant marking language which makes heavy use of postpositions for relational purposes. Cavineña postpositions are a mono-morphemic (grammatical) words. Most postpositions are independent grammatically but not phonologically. They are clitic words which attach to the last phonological word of their argument (postpositional object NP). They cannot be used on their own. A few postpositions are phonologically independent.

14.1. Morpho-syntactic introduction
The main function of postpositions in Cavineña is to relate an NP to a predicate, as with =tsewe ‘ASSOC’ and =ju ‘LOC’ in (14.1) relating ekwe e-wane ‘my wife’ and ekwe tujuri ‘my mosquito net’ to the intransitive predicate kanajara-kware ‘rest-REM.PAST’:

(14.1)

I-keS =bakwe [e-kwe e-wane=tsewe] kanajara-kware 1SG-FM =CONTR 1SG-GEN 1-wife=ASSOC rest-REM.PAST

[e-kwe tujuri=ju]. 1SG-GEN mosquito.net=LOC ‘Me, I was resting with my wife in my mosquito net.’ bi012

Most postpositions mark oblique functions and have rich semantics (as with =ju ‘LOC’ and =tsewe ‘ASSOC’ in the previous example). But postpositions are also used while coding core grammatical functions. An NP in transitive subject function — regardless of any semantic or pragmatic considerations — is obligatorily marked by =ra ‘ERG’ (as in (14.2a)). The absence of any postpositional marking on an NP codes an intransitive subject (or copula clause subject) (as in (14.2b) an (14.2c)), an object (as in (14.2a)) or a copula complement (as in (14.2c)).

‘This is Antoni’s mosquito net.’ ft018

Oblique postpositional phrases can be used as copula complements, as with Francia=ju ‘in (the Cavineña community of) Francia’ and Jenewaya=keja ‘somewhere close to the Geneshuaya river’ in (14.3):

(14.3)

Tumepatya i-keCS ju-kware Francia=juCC Jenewaya=kejaCC. at.that.time 1SG-FM be-REM.PAST Francia=LOC Geneshuaya.river=LOC.GNL
‘At that time I was in (the Cavineña community of) Francia, somewhere close to the Geneshuaya river.’ vi002

Postpositional phrases cannot function at the NP level (i.e. cannot directly modify the head noun of an NP) unless through the use of relativisation.

For example, for the locative phrase Reye=ju ‘in (the town of) Reyes’ to modify ekwita ‘man’ (the head of a copula subject NP) in (14.4) below, the locative phrase has to be a copula complement (with optional copula predicate ju-), then relativised with the ligature marker =ke.

528 ‘This is what happened to that man from Reyes. (Lit. Thus was that man who was in Reyes.) (He metamorphosed into a jaguar.)’ ht030
As is most often the case — but not obligatorily — the copula predicate ju- ‘be’ is ellipsed.

Note that the dative marker =ja ‘DAT’ (§14.3) is homophonous with the genitive marker =ja ‘GEN’ (§13.4). One might wish to analyse these two morphemes as polysemous and say that phrases marked by =ja can occur both at the NP and the clause level. Argumentation against this analysis is presented in §14.3.3.

Relativisation within headless oblique NPs is a major strategy for producing equivalents of adverbial subordinate clauses. An example is at (14.5) below involving the postposition =keja ‘LOC.GNL’.

(14.5)

[I-keS ijawe ju-ani-ya=keja]

kwa-kware.

1SG-FM play be-SIT-IMPFV=LOC.GNL go-REM.PAST

‘He (the priest) went towards where I was playing sitting (on the ground).’ es011

There is an interesting observation that many postpositions — summarised in

(14.6) below — involve the sequence ke:

(14.6) =keja ‘LOC.GNL’

=eke

‘PERL’

ji(/e)teke ‘LOOKING.FOR’

dyake ‘ON’

emake ‘UNDER’

peke

‘AT.SIDE.OF’

One might want to further analyse these postpositions. Note that ke is also the form of the ligature marker (marking relative clauses) and as such it can attach to a postposition (see for example the sequence =ju=ke [=LOC=LIG] in (14.4) above). However, the remaining parts either do not occur outside of these postpositions (e.g. jite in jiteke, ema in emake), or they do by with very different meanings. Taking =keja as an example, we have =ja as a the dative marker. But semantically, the meanings of the dative marker —

529 possession, recipient, experiencer; see §14.3) below — are quite distinct from the ones of =keja — location/target, causee (see §14.5 below). Note that there is an attested combination of the ligature and the dative markers but it is =ja=ke not *=ke=ja (see §20.1.2).
Therefore, although the ligature =ke might have been part of these postpositions historically, one is forced synchronically to treat these postpositions as monomorphemic.
There are no syntactic restrictions for the order of the postpositional phrases (core or oblique) in main clauses. Constituents are positioned according to pragmatic considerations. The dimensions of expectation and/or contrast appear to play a major role. The less expected and/or the more contrastive information is, the more fronted it will be coded in the clause. In (14.9) below, for example, ‘with bees’ is coded first in the clause probably because for a bird to feed its baby with (dangerous) bees is quite unusual and surprising. In (14.32) ‘towards the back’ is probably fronted because it contrasts with the rest of the bus where there is no space. In (14.44c), ‘by lianas’ is fronted probably because this is an unexpected way to climb on trees.
On the other hand, in dependent clauses (of any types), any postpositional phrases (as well as any other clausal constituents) have to precede the verb.
In the remaining of the chapter, we illustrate the range of semantics covered by each postpositions in turn. We also discuss a number of pro-forms (i.e. words that can stand for a whole postpositional phrase) when they are available: pronouns (referring to a person, animal or thing; these have been discussed in §15.1), demonstratives (referring to a place; these have been discussed in §15.7), and interrogatives (see have been discussed in §4.5.4).
14.2. =tsewe ‘ASSOC’ 14.2.1. Semantics The postposition =tsewe has two central meanings: comitative (meaning ‘together with, accompanied by’) and instrumental (indicating an instrument used in the process of the

530 event).
The comitative meaning is illustrated in (14.7):
(14.7) a. Tu-wa =tunaS ani-kware pae=tsewe. there-LOC =3PL sit-REM.PAST priest=ASSOC ‘There (in the old mission on the Madidi river) they (Cavineña ancestors) were living with a priest.’ fd003

The postposition =tsewe is also used as a mean for certain adjectives to be used adverbially. Underlyingly, the adjective is part of a RC with an ellipsed head (that can be glossed as ‘manner’) (see discussion in §11.1.4). This is illustrated in (14.11):

(14.11) a. [Yatse-ja pere]S jeti-kware

14.2.2. Pro-forms

There is a set of associative independent pronouns which can stand for an associative phrase. The forms are in Table 14.1:

Table 14.1: Associative pronouns

person 1st 2nd 3rd 3rd PROX

SG ea-tsewe mia-tsewe tua-tsewe riya-tsewe

DL yatse-tsewe metse-tsewe tatse-tsewe retse-tsewe

PL ekwana-tsewe mikwana-tsewe tuna-tsewe rena-tsewe

Associative pronouns with comitative meanings are shown in (14.12) ((14.12b) is (T1.83-84) (an example with 2nd person associative pronoun is in (14.22b) further below):

(14.12) a. Ea-tsewe =tuS

Tua-tsewe=dya kwa-kware. 3SG-ASSOC=FOC go-REM.PAST ‘… I said to Tsimi “Let’s (dl) go!” And I went with him.’ ao084

An associative pronoun with instrumental meaning is shown in (14.13) (another example is in (14.59a) further below):

533

(14.13) Trosadora=kamadyaS =tuS

‘(At the time we were making that canoe) there were only (plain) saws (there were no chain saws). (So) that’s what he (my master) would use to cut it (the tree for the canoe).’ ab173-174

There are no specific pro-forms to question an associative phrase. This has to be done with the interrogative noun ai as (14.14a) (comitative meaning) and (14.14b) (instrumental meaning; from a recorded conversation where a question is addressed to the author about the fishing techniques in his country):

(14.14) a. Ai=tsewe =tuO

‘What do you fish (lit. take fish out) with over there (in your country)? With hooks? With a net? With a casting net? Or with what?’ tb198

14.3. =ja ‘DAT’
Dative postpositional phrases can refer to a possessor, a recipitent, an experiencer, a demoted A argument. Note that the dative case marker =ja is homophonous with the genitive case marker =ja ‘GEN’ (§13.4).

534 14.3.1. Semantics
Dative phrases are used to code the following semantic roles: 1— ‘possessor’ (essentially interpersonal, ownership and whole-part relations). This is normally found with the existential verb ju- ‘be’ or postural verbs ani- ‘sit’, neti‘stand’, etc. Cavineña does not have any verb meaning ‘have’. For this purpose, one strategy the language has is encoding the possessor with a dative phrase as an oblique argument of one of these existential/postural verbs and the possessee as the core S argument. (Another strategy is to derive an adjective from a noun referring to the possessee using the suffixes -ki ‘WITH’ or -ma ‘WITHOUT’, meaning ‘having/not having an N’; see §11.3.1.) This is illustrated in (14.15). (See also (14.19b) with a dative pronoun.)

(14.15) a. Sergio=ja ani-ya [ata Sergio=DAT sit-IMPFV relative

white.man=DAT =3SG(-FM) many cow sit-IMPFV

2 — recipient. This is illustrated in (14.16) (another example is at (14.19c) further below, with a dative pronoun):

(14.16) a. Ebakwapiji=ja =pa e-naO

baka-kwe!

small.child=DAT =REP NPF-water ask.for-IMP.SG

‘Ask water for the small child!’ n4.0464

535 b. ChuruO [ebakwa nana=ja] pa-a!
bonnet child baby=DAT HORT.SG-affect
‘I’m going to make a bonnet for the child!’ di0715

3 — experiencer. This is found with copula clauses with certain adjectives as complement (see §11.1.1). Here the dative phrase (in oblique function) specifies a participant that experiences the property denoted by the adjective (in CC function) on the CS argument referent. This is illustrated in (14.17):

(14.17) a. Bari=ja

rapaCS biji-daCC.

ebakwa=kwana=ja ara-taki=amaCC.

‘““(It is important that you don’t push the oxen too much, otherwise) their nape will swell,” I was told by your father,” (I said to my daugher.)’ ka423

14.3.2. Pro-forms

There is a set of dative independent pronouns (identical to genitive pronouns) which can stand for a dative phrase. (Note that Cavineña also has dative bound pronouns. See for example =ekwe ‘1SG.DAT’ in (14.104). These are homophonous with the dative independent pronouns but are unaccentuated and have distributional restrictions, notably to occur in second position in a main clause; see §15.1.2.) Dative independent pronouns are given in Table 14.2:

Table 14.2: Dative pronouns

person 1st 2nd 3rd 3rd PROX

SG e-kwe mi-kwe tu-ja riya-ja

DL yatse-ja metse-ja tatse-ja retse-ja

PL ekwana-ja mikwana-ja tuna-ja rena-ja

In (14.19), we illustrate dative pronouns in most of the functions illustrated before: possessor in a possessive clause in a., recipient in b. and original A argument of a transitive-verb-turned-into-adjective in c.:
(14.19) a. E-kwe pa-ju metaraS! 1SG-DAT JUSS-be ring ‘Let the ring be mine!’ (i.e. ‘I would like to have your ring!’) tb030

1PL-DAT =3SG(-FM) raise-ABIL

kuchi=kwanaCS. pig=PL

537 ‘We have to raise pigs (so that we won’t lack meat).’ di2948

There are no specific dative interrogative pro-forms. The referent in dative function has to be questioned by using the interrogative noun ai ‘INT’ as head of a dative phrase, as in (14.20) (volunteered by Francisco Vaca). (Note that the dative phrase here occurs within copula relative clauses.):

(14.20)

A: Ai=jaCC=keCS =riCS

anteojoCS?

INT=DAT=LIG =3PROX.SG(-FM) glasses

B: E-kwiCC=keCC tume! 1SG-DAT=LIG there
‘A: Whose glasses are these (lit. to whom are these glasses)? B: Those are mine! (lit. those are to me)’ n1.0170

14.3.3. Dative vs. genitive It was observed that the dative marker =ja ‘DAT’ / dative pronouns are homophonous with the genitive marker =ja ‘GEN’ / genitive pronouns. It was also noted that dative phrases can have semantics of ‘possession’ (see (14.17)). This could suggest that dative and genitive are not distinct constructions. However, there are a number of differences that make them clearly different, as follows: 1 — dative and genitive constructions have a clear different distribution. A genitive construction is embedded within an NP (slot C; §13.4) whereas a dative construction is an immediate constituent of a clause. This is (at least) clear from second position clitic placement. If a genitive construction comes first in a main clause, second position clitics attach to the last phonological word of the NP it belongs to, never to the genitive construction (as with =pa ‘REP’ and =tu ‘3’ in (14.33a)). On the other hand, second position clitics attach directly to a dative construction when first in a main clause (as with =tu ‘3’ in (14.15b,c), (14.17a) and (14.19c), and =pa ‘REP’ in (14.16a);
2 — a dative construction can code semantic roles never coded by a genitive construction, notably recipient and experiencer;
3 — a dative participant only (i.e., not a genitive participant) can be referred to by a

538 bound pronoun.

14.4. =ju ‘LOC’
The locative postposition =ju marks an NP that indicates a precise location (with a nonmotion verb) or precise target (with a motion verb). (It contrasts with the general locative postposition =keja ‘LOC.GNL’ which indicates an approximate location/target; see §14.5) below.) The event can either involve motion or not. The marker =ju can also have temporal and abstract meanings.

14.4.1. Semantics Examples in (14.21) illustrate =ju specifying the exact location of non-motion events. (Another example is at (14.1) with the verb kanajara- ‘rest’.).

(14.21) a. [TumeCC=ke tiempo] there=LIG time

=tuS =3SG(-FM)

b. [TumeCC=ke mejiji=ju] =pa =tunaS tawi-nati-kware. there=LIG beach=LOC =REP =3PL sleep-GO.TEMP-REM.PAST
‘They slept on that beach.’ hm044

An example with a locative phrase used as copula complement is in (14.3) above (‘I was in the Cavineña community of Francia’).

In (14.22) (intransitive verbs) and (14.23) (transitive verbs) ((14.23a) is (T1.32)), =ju encodes the exact target of motion events:

(14.22) a. I-keS kwa-kara ju-ya

then =3SG-DAT =3SG(-FM) lake=LOC grab-STOP-GO.PERM-REM.PAST

matujaO. cayman
‘Then he released the cayman in the lake.’ cd007

The marker =ju is also used with containers, as in (14.24):

(14.24)

Jaja-tsu =tuna-ja =tuO

amena sura=kwana=ju isha-ya.

sieve-SS =3PL-DAT =3SG(-FM) FILL jug=PL=LOC put.in-IMPFV

‘They would sieve it (masticated corn) and then put it in jugs.’ ci095

The marker =ju cannot be used with animate entities. (Or if it does, there are some idiosyncratic abstract meanings; see for example waka=ju ‘cow=LOC’ ‘in cattle farming’ in (14.27b) below). That is, a person or an animal at/to which an event located/targeted cannot be directly marked by =ju (although it can be directly marked

540 by =keja ‘LOC.GNL’, see §14.5 below). (The reason explaining this fact appears to be that =ju implies location/target inside the perimeter of the stated entity. Marking an animate entity with =ju would mean that the event intrudes into the body of this entity. This is not the case with =keja, which, as seen in the following section, only expresses approximate location/targets.)

There are essentially two ways to express such situations. The first way is to mark animate being terms with =keja, as we just saw (and illustrated in the following section). The second way is to use body part terms which do have the possibility to be marked by =ju. We illustrate the second way below.

In (14.25) one cannot say *sudaru=ju ‘(it climbed) on the soldier’. The alternative used is to say e-kwita=ju ‘on the body’ and to express ‘soldier’ by an genitive phrase inside the same NP:

(14.25)

Tsura-kware [sudaru=ja e-kwita=ju]. go.up-REM.PAST soldier=GEN NPF-body=LOC ‘It (a viper) climbed on the soldier’s body.’ so005

In (14.26) =ju has temporal meanings. It indicates the exact moment an event occurs in the time line:

(14.26) a. KanapuiS =tuS

keke-ya [tee mara=ju].

cicada =3SG(-FM) shout-IMPFV field time=LOC

‘Having told us (dl) that (that we had to come back at 7 pm), we (dl) went back there in the evening.’ vb007

Note that in (14.26c) (and (14.27b) below) we also have the use of =ju as a finite clause subordination marker. See discussion of this §19.2.

There are also a number of more abstract uses of the postposition =ju.

For example, =ju can mark -ana ‘tongue, language’ to mean ‘in the language’ as in (14.27a):

(14.27) a. JeeCC=keCS =riCS

[e-kwe y-ana=ju]

“pupu”CC.

here=LIG =3PROX.SG(-FM) 1SG-GEN NPF-tongue=LOC owl

‘In my language (lit. tongue), this (owl bird) is (called) “pupu”.’ pa066

Here, ‘language’ is viewed as a location/repository of words. Note that -ana can also be marked by =eke ‘PERL’ in which case it is viewed as a mean of communication; see (14.49) in §14.6 below.)

The marker =ju is also found marking waka ‘cow’ with the meaning ‘in cattle farming’ in (14.27b):

(14.27) b. E-raA ba-kware

[waka=ju mere ju-ya=ju].

1SG-ERG see-REM.PAST cow=LOC work be-IMPFV=DS

‘I saw him (my brother) working in cattle (farming).’ nk062

14.4.2. Pro-forms There are a number of pro-forms which can be used instead of a locative phrase marked by =ju.
First is set of adverbial demonstratives, given in Table 14.3 and illustrated in (14.28):

542

‘(When we arrived at the village, my companions said to everybody, talking of me:) He has killed a caymani. There (where we were fishing) he threw iti away.’ lg046

Second is an interrogative pro-form eju which is essentially used for entities which exclusively have a locative meaning (such as the entities illustrated in (14.21) and (14.22)). It is illustrated in (14.29a) (intransitive verb) and (14.29b) (transitive verb):

(14.29) a. Jutakiju eju

=miS

tawi-ya?

therefore INT:LOC =2SG(-FM) sleep-IMPFV

543 ‘So where are you going to sleep?’ zo089

‘(I had no idea where the missionaries were taking me. I said to myself:) “Where are they taking me? Maybe they are they taking me to (their country in) the United States (of America).”’ me044

Terms which are only occasionally used in a locative sense, such as body parts (such as ekwita ‘body’ in (14.25) above) or containers (such as sura ‘big jug’ in (14.24) above), are questioned with the interrogative word ai.

This is illustrated with a volunteered conversation turn by Francisco Vaca in (14.30) and an example from a recorded conversation in (14.31) (compare this example with (14.29b) where the same transitive verb duju- ‘take’ is used).

544

14.5. =keja ‘LOC.GNL’
The central meaning of the postposition =keja ‘LOCative GeNeraL’ (and =kejaamaka ‘LOCated APPROXimately’, see §14.5.3 below) is to indicate approximate locations/targets for the event of the predicate. It contrasts nicely with =ju ‘LOC’ which codes precise locations/targets. An example containing and contrasting both is at (14.3) (repeated).

(14.3)

Tumepatya i-keCS ju-kwareCP Francia=juCC Jenewaya=kejaCC. at.that.time 1SG-FM be-REM.PAST Francia=LOC Geneshuaya.river=LOC.GNL
‘At that time I was (living) in (the Cavineña community of) Francia, somewhere close to the Geneshuaya river.’ vi002

Interestingly, =keja can take an increment formative, -amaka, giving =kejaamaka. This formative (which is only found with two postpositions, =keja and =eke ‘PERL’) further reduces the precision of the location/target. It is discussed further below in §14.5.3).
In addition to its central locative meaning, =keja also has temporal and other more abstract meanings.

14.5.1. Semantics In (14.32) =keja indicate a location with non-motion events (see also Jenewaya=keja ‘somewhere close to the Geneshuaya river’ in (14.3) above):

An example of a general location phrase in copula function is in (14.3) above (‘I was in the Cavineña community of Francia, somewhere close to the Geneshuaya river’).

545 In the examples in (14.33) =keja indicates a target for motion events (see also Rure=keja ‘somewhere in the area of Rurrenabaque’ in (14.37b) below).

(14.33) a. [Tu-ja cosina=keja] =pa =tuS 3SG-GEN kitchen=LOC.GNL =REP =3SG(-FM)

‘Let me keep going somewhere along the creek! (I said to myself, hoping I could find some animal to kill there.)’ ba037

In (14.34) =keja is shown with a temporal meaning. It gives a rough estimation of the time of an event. We have no such examples with =kejaamaka.

(Note that in chine=keja, the postposition might have become lexicalised. This expression has a fixed meaning which is ‘afternoon’. In other words, it means ‘toward the evening’. It cannot mean ‘after the evening’, a reading which should otherwise be acceptable if the sense of ‘approximate’ was kept.)

We saw in the preceding section that terms for animate beings cannot be directly marked by =ju. However they can be marked with =keja. Illustration of this is at (14.35) ((14.35b) is (T1.100)) (see also e-baba=ekana=keja ‘to our grandfathers’ in (14.26b)).

The postposition =keja is finally used to mark the causee of a causativised transitive verb in the case of indirect causation. (In the case of direct causation, the causee is marked as a core argument; see §8.4.2.) A illustrative pair is at (14.36):

14.5.2. Pro-forms There are a number of pro-forms that can stand for phrases marked by =keja or =kejaamaka.
First, there is a set of general location demonstratives, given in Table 14.4 and illustrated in (14.37):

547

‘Are the things (lit. mind) good over there (in your country)? There’s a lot of (lit. many) money there, isn’t it?’ tb206

Second, there is a set of general location pronouns which can stand for a general location phrase marking an animate entity (as in examples (14.35) above). The forms are in Table 14.5 and illustrated in (14.38):

Table 14.5: General location pronouns

‘(My chief told me:) “Soldier Francisco Vaca, come over here!”. (When he told me thus,) I went to him.’ cu007-008

Third, there is an interrogative general location pro-form, ejekeja, which is used to question (approximate) locations/targets with inanimate referents. It is illustrated in (14.39):

(14.39)

Ejekeja =yatseS kwa-ya wikamutya=ra, Utsekwa? INT:LOC.GNL =1DL go-IMPFV fish=PURP.MOT grandchild

Wiatsura=keja ne-kwa, Baba-chi, Upriver=LOC.GNL HORT.DL-go grand.father-AFFTN

549 e-nari=keja! NPF-eddy=LOC.GNL
‘(The grandfather asked his grandson:) “Whereabouts are we (dl) going fishing?” “Let’s (dl) go somewhere upriver, somewhere around the eddy!” (the grandson replied.)’ ps004-006

The interrogative pro-form ejekeja cannot be used if the question is about the location/target of an animate entity (for example ‘his godfather’ in (14.35) or ‘the missionary’ in (14.35b)) or the causee of a causativised transitive verb (for example ‘her child’ in (14.36b)). For this use, there are no pro-forms available. The interrogative noun ai has to be used, marked by the general location postposition, as in the volunteered conversational exchange in (14.40) below:

(14.40) A: Ai=keja =tu-ja =tuO

iwara-mere-ya eweebariO?

INT=LOC.GNL =3SG-DAT =3SG(-FM) call-CAUS-IMPFV adolescent

B: Ea-keja

iwara-mere-ya eweebariO.

1SG-LOC.GNL =3SG-DAT =3SG(-FM) call-CAUS-IMPFV adolescent

‘Who did they ask to call the young man? It is me who they asked to call the young man.’ n3.0493

14.5.3. Increment -amaka
The postposition =keja (including its corresponding pro-forms) can take an additional formative increment, -amaka which adds to the imprecision of the location/target expressed by =keja. Besides =keja, -amaka is only attested in a similar combination with the postposition =eke ‘PERL’, see §14.6.3 below). For this reason, we treat =kejaamaka as lexicalised and give it a unique gloss ‘LOC.APPROX’. (It is possibly related to the e-noun -majaka ‘space’.)

The differences between =keja and =kejaamaka can be seen in (14.41).

‘(I couldn’t find any fare so I said:) “Let me go over there!” and I went towards BarrioVilla, on the side of (the place called) Tajibu.’ mo010

Together with =ju ‘LOC’, =keja and =kejaamaka can be place on a scale of location/target precision, with =ju at one end — indicating a very precise location — and =kejaamaka on the other end — indicating a very approximate location.

The form =kejaamaka is rather rare in the data. From the examples available it only has locational meanings, as in (14.42) (with locative meaning with a non-motion verb), (14.43) (with a target meaning with motion verbs; see also (14.41) above).

14.6. =eke ‘PERL’ The perlative postposition =eke has a broad range of meanings. Its most central meaning appears to be ‘through (a place)’ which is the reason why I gloss it as

551 PERLative. But it also means ‘from (a place)’ (ablative meaning), ‘along a place/location’ and ‘on/by way of (vehicle meaning). It can also have temporal and others more abstract meanings.
Similarly to =keja, the perlative postposition is attested (at least in one example) with the increment -amaka which add to the imprecision of the location/target ‘through which’ the verb even takes place. It is discussed further below in §14.6.3.

14.6.1. Semantics The central perlative meaning of =eke — i.e. location/path through which an event takes place — is illustrated in (14.44) below:

(14.44) a. Wetana=kwana=eke e-naS

nubi-ya

ba-atsu…

y-awa=eke

kwa-chine

NPF-ground=PERL go-REC.PAST

‘(While someone carried our heavy luggage in his canoe,) we (dl) went by land.’ vb048

The marker =eke need not be associated with a motion event (as it is in the

552 previous examples). In (14.45) it refers to an elongated location:

(14.45)

Emake=eke =tukwe

e-ririCC ju-kware.

UNDER=PERL =COUNT.EVID RES-rot be-REM.PAST

‘It turned out that it (the bridge I was about to cross) was rotten along the underneath.’ wa072

The postposition =eke codes vehicles/means of transportation such as kwaba ‘canoe’ (as in (14.46a)), kawayu ‘horse’ (as in (14.46b)), karetu ‘cart’, pere ‘raft’, avion ‘plane’, etc.

(14.46) a. Diata=ju

Biata.river=LOC =1DL cross-REC.PAST here=LIG canoe=PERL

b. Kawayu=eke =ekwanaS kwa-chine kimishaS.

horse=PERL =1PL

go-REC.PAST three

‘We went by horse, three of us.’ me124

Going on foot is also expressed with =eke as in (14.47):

(14.47)

TunaS =bakwe kwa-chine e-wachi=eke. 3PL =CONTR go-REC.PAST NPF-foot=PERL ‘Them, they went on foot (whereas us, we went on a motocycle).’ br013

Note that vehicles are sometimes marked with =tsewe ‘ASSOC’ rather than =eke. In some examples, it is because the vehicle is used to carry the protagonist’s luggage only, as in (14.50c), for example. In this example karetu ‘cart’ takes the associative postposition =tsewe (and not the perlative =eke) because — as the author who took part in that particular trip can remember — the cart was used here to carry the luggage only whereas the people went on foot. A similar situation is in (14.59b). However, in other cases, the vehicle does carry the protagonist, as in (14.48) (this is T1.25):

553 (14.48) Kwa-kware=dya avioneta=tsewe.
go-REM.PAST=FOC light.plane=ASSOC
‘I went by light plane.’ ao025

Quite similar to the way =eke codes vehicles/means of transportation, this postposition also codes vehicles/means/instruments of information such as -ana ‘tongue, language’ in (14.49a) (this is (T1.74)), radio ‘(shortwave) radio transmitter’ in (14.49b) (this is (T1.3)), keke ‘a shout’, kwatsabiji ‘a notice, story’, etc.

inform-REM.PAST radio=PERL

‘They (Araona people) told it to us (pl) by radio (that they had serious problems in their village).’ ao003

Note the semantic differences between y-ana=ju ‘language=LOC’ in (14.27a) above — where language is seen as a repository/location/container for words/information — and y-ana ‘language=PERL’ in (14.49a) — where language is seen as an vehicle transporting these words/information.

The marker =eke is also used to code a point from which a motion event takes place as in (14.50):

(14.50) a. E-wane=kwana=keS kwa-ya epu=eke.

3-wife=PL=3

‘From San Miguel, we kept going with a cart (to carry our heavy luggage).’ ft051

In (14.51) =eke is used to code a point from which a distance is evaluated:

(14.51) a. Carretera=eke =tuCS

SantaElenaCS

road=PERL =3SG(-FM) Santa.Elena

[cuatro kilometro=dyane]CC. four kilometre=APPROX

‘I was in the water, up to the knees.’ lg007

The marker =eke can also have a temporal meaning. In (14.52) it expresses that the verb event of ‘calling’ occurs along the time line of the months of November:

(14.52)

Tumepatya =ekwanaO misionero=kwana=raA Tumichucua=ju

at.that.time =1PL

missionary=PL=ERG Tumichucua=LOC

iwara-ni-kware

[noviembre badi=eke=dyane].

call-RANDOM-REM.PAST November month=PERL=APPROX

‘At that time, the missionaries used to call us (to come) to Tumichucua

555 sometimes in (the month of) November.’ lv002

In a few examples (two examples from a mythical text and one in the dictionary) and only with the verb tere- ‘finish’, =eke marks a cause as in (14.53):

(14.53)

Tuekedya =pa ekanaS tere-ya

kwejipa=eke…

then

=REP 3PL finish-IMPFV strong.wind=PERL

‘(In the old time, our Cavineña ancestors would only live for one or two weeks.) Then, they would all die (lit. finish) because of terrible winds (and other calamities).’ ya007

It is possible that this could be an old use of the postposition =eke. More work is needed to clarify this issue.

Similarly to the general locative postposition =keja — but unlike the locative =ju —, animate entities appear to allow perlative marking as shown in (14.54) where it has a special meaning:

(14.54)

[Dutya tu-ja kasa=tsewe] kueti-kware e-puna=ekatse=eke.

all

3SG-GEN strength=ASSOC pass-REM.PAST NPF-woman=DL=PERL

‘It (an agouti) (appeared suddenly and) passed with all its strength between two women.’ md007

This is unfortunately the only example available. Futher work is need to investigate whether the range of meanings illustrated with =eke here can be found with animate entities as well.

14.6.2. Pro-forms There is a set of perlative demonstrative pro-forms, as given in Table 14.6 and exemplified in (14.55):

556
Table 14.6: Perlative demonstratives

‘(The wives of the huntersi would go to meet themi from the village while) themi, theyi would come from over there (from the forest, on their way back from hunting).’ ct039

There is also an interrogative pro-form ejeeke which has a locative meaning only — not instrumental-like meaning. It is illustrated in (14.56a) and with a conversation turn volunteered by Francisco Vaca in (14.56b):

(14.56) a. Ejeeke =tuS

e-naS

nubi-kware?

INT:PERL =3SG(-FM) NPF-water enter-REM.PAST

‘A: Where is the path (that goes) to Cavinas (Misión Cavinas)? Here? B: No. A: There? B: No! (It is) over there!’ n1.0570

When questioning the instrumental-like meaning of =eke (as in (14.46) above), one has to use a phrase with the interrogative noun ai marked with =eke, as in (14.57), a volunteered example by Francisco Vaca:

(14.57)

Ai=eke =tuS

diru-wa? Camion=eke?

INT=PERL =3SG(-FM) go-PERF truck=PERL

‘How (*through where) did he go? By truck? n2.0253

14.6.3. Increment -amaka
The postposition =eke can take (presumably) the same increment formative -amaka as =keja (see §14.5.3 above). Unfortunately, we only have one example, in (14.58) below, where =ekeamaka marks a headless NP.

(14.58)

… [peya=ekeamaka] other=PERL.APPROX

ekwitaS person

kwinana-kware. emerge-REM.PAST

‘(We were looking at the side where the woman had gone fetching the man but) he (the man) came (lit. emerged) from the other side.’ pa048

558 More work is required to discuss further the formative -amaka with =eke.

14.7. =tupu ‘UP.TO’ 14.7.1. Semantics The postposition =tupu ‘UP TO’ codes a point in space/time up to/until where/when an event happens.

The spatial meaning of =tupu with motion verbs is illustrated in (14.59a) (with an intransitive verb) and (14.59b) (with a transitive verb):

(14.59) a. [Señorita Barbarita=ja e-tare=tupu]

‘Mr. Alejandro Arteaga took (lit. came and put) me to Australia (but not farther) with his cart.’ ga012

Another spatial meaning of =tupu is with measurement as in (14.60):

‘… I approached them (a band of capuchin monkeys) at a distance of about twenty meters (so that I could shoot at them).’ aj013

The temporal meaning ‘until’ of =tupu is illustrated in (14.61):

(14.61)

Tudya =yatseA

iwa-chine

barepatya=tupu.

then =1DL(-ERG) wait.for-REC.PAST midday=UP.TO

‘Then we waited for them (the rest of the village) until noon.’ vb012

In (14.62), =tupu marks time:

at.eleven=UP.TO=APPROX =1PL

there-LOC be-COME.PERM-REM.PAST

camion=kwanaO

Australia=LOC =1DL(-ERG) wait.for-REM.PAST truck=PL

[beta wekaka=tupu]. two day=UP.TO
‘In (the village of) Australia, we waited for up to two days for trucks (to take us to town). (And since no truck would come, we left the village on foot).’ vc012

14.7.2. Pro-form
A phrase marked by =tupu has a spatial (as opposed to temporal) sense can be replaced by =tupu on one of the adverbial demonstratives rewa ‘here, tuwa ‘there’ and yuwa ‘over there’ as in (14.64) (from a mythical story):

(14.64)

560

Re-wa=tupu=kamadya i-keS je-wa

amena.

‘(The man who had been taken by a magical turtle inside the river emerged back and said to his relatives:) “I’m only coming up to here. (I won’t go farther. From now on will only live in the water.”)’ pt018

When a phrase marked by =tupu refers to time rather than space, then we find =tupu on the pointing demonstratives riya ‘here’, jee ‘here’, tume ‘there’, yume ‘over.there’ (see §15.8) as in (14.65):

(14.65) a. E-raA =tuO

riya=tupu=kamadya adeba-ya.

1SG-ERG =3SG(-FM) here=UP.TO=RESTR know-IMPFV

‘This is all I know (lit. I know it (our traditions) up to that point; I have nothing else to tell you.).’ fm037

b. Riya=tupu=kamadya =ri-keO

‘I’m telling it (my story) to you up to that point. (I won’t tell you more).’ vb069

Such sentences are typically used by narrators when terminating their stories.

There is a interrogative pro-form ejetupu which is mostly used to question time. (We do not have any clear examples showing ejetupu questioning space.) This is illustrated in (14.66):

(14.66)

Ejetupu =mikwanaS diru-ya?

14.8. Minor postpositions Unlike the preceding postpositions, the following postpositions are:

561 1 — separate grammatical and phonological words; 2 — more specific in meaning; 3 — less used; 4 — there are no specific pro-forms.

14.8.1. ji(/e)teke ‘LOOKING FOR’
The central meaning of the postposition ji(/e)teke is to encode a sense of desire for the entity it marks. According to the situation, it translates variously as ‘looking for, missing, searching, longing for, with interest for, etc.’ Its most common pronounciation is jiteke but it is also occasionally heards as jeteke.

The most common use of jiteke is with a verb of motion in which case the postposition indicates an entity that is looked for. This is illustrated in (14.67), a conversation turn volunteered by Antonio Yubanera:

(14.67)

Eju =miS

kwa-ya? [E-na jiteke]

=ØS

INT:LOC =2SG(-FM) go-IMPFV NPF-water LOOKING.FOR (=1SG-FM)

kwa-ya. go-IMPFV A: ‘Where are you going?’ B: ‘I’m going to fetch water.’ n4.0398

Other texts examples are in (14.68). In examples a. and b., the verb is intransitive. In example c., it is transitive:

(14.68) a. … =tuS

[e-kwe e-jau]S

=3SG(-FM) 1SG-GEN 3-younger.brother

[tu-ja eskupeta jiteke]

kwa-kware.

3SG-GEN shotgun LOOKING.FOR go-REM.PAST

‘… my (younger brother) went to fetch his (own) shotgun (to kill the tapir).’ ma019

tsajaja-aje-kware

[kuchiru jiteke].

‘Felicia ran to get a machete (to kill the agouti).’ md013

c. … e-baba=ke=raA

two person LOOKING.FOR NPF-house=LOC.GNL

‘(After tying the giant fish,) the grandfather sent his grandchild to the house to look for two (strong) men (to help them carry the fish).’ ps045

In (14.69), jiteke has a more abstract meaning of ‘longing for, missing’:
(14.69) a. [E-kwe e-kwaa]S pa-kware [tu-ja ai=kwana jiteke]. 1SG-GEN 1-mother cry-REM.PAST 3SG-GEN INT=PL LOOKING.FOR ‘(When I told heri that our house had completely burnt,) my motheri cried for her things.’ tk037

b. … ikeCS nereka-daCC re-keja [mi-ke jiteke] 1SG-FM miserable-ASF here-PERL 2SG-FM LOOKING.FOR
ju-neni-ya. be-RANDOM-IMPFV ‘(When I arrived to my mother who was sick, she said to me: “As you were coming,) I was miserable around here thinking of you.”’ pf049

c. Peru=raA =tuO

JoseO [confite jiteke]

Pedro=ERG =3SG(-FM) José candy LOOKING.FOR

jiyu-ya. make.friend.of-IMPFV ‘Pedro is becoming friendly with Joséi because of hisi candies.’ di1794

563 There are no specific pro-forms for jiteke. Jiteke can mark an independent pronoun (such as mike ‘2SG’ in (14.69b) above). Questions are made using the interrogative noun ai as in (14.70):

(14.70)

[Ai jiteke=piji]

je-kara

i-keS ju-wa?

INT LOOKING.FOR=DIM come-DESID 1SG-FM be-PERF

‘(Because the trip was so tiring, I asked myself:) “Why (lit. looking for what) did I want to come?”’ ka030

14.8.2. Quantifer postpositions
There is a set of quantifier postpositions which is based on the numeral series (see §13.5). These mark a noun that is taken as a measuring unit to quantify the S or O argument or the predicate event itself.

The postposition pidya ‘(the amount of) ONE WHOLE’ corresponds to the quantifier peadya ‘one’ (with phonological reduction ea -> i). It is the most widespread and — perhaps as a result — the only one to differ in shape from its corresponding lexical numeral. It is shown in (14.71) (a volunteered example):

(14.71)

Elsa=raA =tuO

kwaweO keti-wa [jiti pidya].

Elsa=ERG =3SG(-FM) manioc fetch-PERF basket ONE.WHOLE

‘Elsa fetched a full basket of manioc (lit. Elsa fetched manioc the amount of a full basket).’ n5.0262

Note that unlike in the English translation, jiti pidya is an oblique contituent and not part of the O NP. This is made clear by the fact that the head of the O NPs kwawe ‘manioc’ and jiti pidya ‘the amount of a full basket’ are separated by the predicate of the clause keti-wa ‘fetched’.

The other quantifier postpositions have the exact same form as their lexical numeral counterparts: beta ‘(the amount of) TWO WHOLE’ (cf. beta ‘two’), kimisha ‘(the amount of THREE WHOLE’ (cf. kimisha ‘three’), etc. An illustrative (volunteered) example is at (14.72):

564

(14.72) Elsa=raA =tuO

kwaweO be-ti-wa

Elsa=ERG =3SG(-FM) manioc bring-GO.TEMP-PERF

[jiti basket

beta/kimisha/pushi/etc.]. TWO/THREE/FOUR.WHOLE

‘Elsa brought two/three/four/etc. full baskets of manioc.’ n5.0273

Numeral postpositions typically mark nouns referring to containers such as jiti ‘basket’ (in (14.71) and (14.72) above), emarikaka ‘cooking pot’ (in (14.73a)) or karetu ‘cart’ in (14.73c).

(14.73) a. [Mechi emarikaka pidya=kwana]

=tunaA

a-ya…

soil cooking.pot ONE.WHOLE=UNCERT =3PL(-ERG) affect-IMPFV

‘They would prepare it (manioc beer) the amount of something like a full (soil) cooking pot…’ ci188

b. AntonioS =tuS

ka-be-ti-chine

ai=kwanaE

Antonio =3SG(-FM) REF-bring-REF-REC.PAST INT=PL

[karetu pidya]. cart ONE.WHOLE ‘Antonio brought a full cart of things for himself.’ ri037

In the preceding examples, the quantifier postpositional phrases quantify the O argument of transitive verbs. In (14.74), we show quantification of the S argument. Cavineña houses are most often small and overcrowded. Pointing to one such house, Alredo Tavo said to me that one could say:

(14.74)

Tu-wa =tunaS ani-ya [e-tare pidya]. There-LOC =3PL sit-IMPFV NPF-house ONE.WHOLE
‘There, they live in a house full of people (lit. they sit the amount of a full house).’ n5.0263

Finally, quantifier postpositions can quantify the predicate event itself, in terms of

565 its duration, as in (14.75).

(14.75)

[E-kwe e-awe]S mere ju-kware tu-wa [semana pidya]. 1SG-GEN 1-husband work be-REM.PAST there-LOC week ONE.WHOLE ‘My husband worked there a whole week.’ ri037

One could argue that the morphemes pidya, beta, kimisha, etc. discussed here are NP modifiers. The reasons why this option was not retained are that: 1 — one quantifier postposition, pidya ‘ONE.WHOLE’, has a different form from the (otherwise) NP modifier (peadya ‘one’); 2 — functionally, quantifier postpositions do not only modify arguments but also predicates (e.g., (14.75)); 3 — the quantifier postpositions and their object can be separated from the NP they modify.

14.8.3. =kama ‘ONLY’
The postposition =kama means ‘just, only, purely, noboby/nothing/nowhere else than’. It is only attested in a few examples and its meanings and morpho-syntax are not entirely understood yet.

We illustrate =kama in (14.76). (Note that (14.76a) is (T1.1)).

(14.76) a. … =tuS

NPF-foot=ONLY =1DL come-REC.PAST there=LIG NPF-forest=LOC

‘Then we finished the trip on foot (lit. we went only on foot) in that forest.’ ka469

In (14.77), we illustrate a phrase marked with =kama in copula complement function:

(14.77)

Ami=kamaCC [e-kwe iyuka]CS ju-kware.

blood=ONLY 1SG-GEN head

be-REM.PAST

‘My head was full of blood.’ mg027

The postposition =kama is attested with one verb, tsajaja- ‘run’ in its non-finite form (i.e. without an inflectional affix), as shown in (14.78):

(14.78)

[Jadya ju-atsu] =ØS

diru-chine tsajaja=kama.

thus be-SS (=1SG-FM) go-REC.PAST run=ONLY

‘After I said thus, I went back running all the way.’ ce042

More work is required to see whether verbs can productively be marked by =kama.

Note that =kama is related to the phrasal particle =kamadya ‘RESTR’ (which is a frozen combination of kama plus the focus particle =dya) (see §17.4).

14.8.4. =taka ‘ALONE’ The postposition =taka ‘ALONE’ has a meaning fairly similar to =kama, i.e. ‘just, only,

567 alone, etc.’ Quite similarly to =kama there are very few examples of =taka and the present discussion can only be tentative.

A rare example of =taka is given in (14.79) (from the dictionary):

(14.79)

[E-kwe inime=taka=dya=jutidya]CC =tu-keCS 1SG-GEN thinking=ALONE=FOC=DISEMPH =3SG-FM
‘It is my own will.’ di1571

There are independent pronouns filling the slot for an ‘alone’ postpositional phrase. These are given in Table 14.7:

14.9. Postpositions with optional argument

14.9.1. General overview

A number of morphemes with spatial relational meanings (e.g. ‘on’, ‘under’, ‘behind’,

etc.) have a postpositional function on the basis that they can follow an NP (their

postpositional object / argument) and relate it to a predicate. These postpositions differ

in two major ways from the postpositions discussed thus far: (1) they can occur without

an argument (similarly to English he went outside the house and he went outside) and

(2) they can combine with an additional postposition. The full list is given in (14.81):

(14.81) tsekwe

‘OUTSIDE’

idyake

‘ABOVE’

jiruru

‘AT.EDGE.OF’

yueketibene ‘FARTHER.BEHIND’

tsuku

‘AT.CORNER.OF’

tupuju

‘FOLLOWING’

=duku

‘INSIDE’

peke

‘AT.SIDE.OF’

emake

‘UNDER’

patya(patya) ‘IN.MIDDLE.OF’

tibene dyake

‘BEHIND’ ‘ON’

pijidyane japadama

‘CLOSE.TO’ ‘CLOSE.TO’1

There is evidence that many of these postpositions come from nouns and specifically from the class of e-nouns (which code parts of entities).

Let us first recall that e-nouns require a prefix formative e- which is lost when the noun is modified by a preceding juxtaposed noun (e.g. waka ‘cow’ + e-rami ‘flesh’ = waka rami ‘cow flesh’, Diata ‘Biata river’ + e-kike ‘forest’ = Diata kike ‘forest of the Biata river’) (See §12.3.1 and §13.1.1). E-nouns, either independent or modified, require an oblique postpositional marker when they occur in an oblique function. Thus compare -kike in (14.82a) (independent in core CS function), (14.82b) (independent in locative function) and (14.82c) (modified in locative function) (this last example is repeated from (14.22c) above):
1 There are no clear meaning differences between the postpositions pijidyane and japadama (see §14.9.9).

Biata.river forest=LOC

enter-GO.TEMP-SS

‘Entering the forest of Biata river (he encountered an anteater).’ na005a

Having this in mind, we can give a likely explanation for the development of a number of the postpositions in (14.81).

The three postpositions in (14.83) are attested as heads of core NPs. Exactly

similarly to e-nouns (such as -rami ‘flesh’ or -kike ‘forest’ above), they take an e prefix

when they are independent (as in a. and b.) but not when there take a juxtaposed

modified (as in c.). (Illustrative examples are cross-referenced on the right hand side.)

(14.83) a. e-tsekwe=kwana ‘the outside areas (were in bad conditions)’ (14.94)

b. ekwe e-tsuku ‘(I looked at) my hip’

(14.101)

c. Biata jiruru ‘the banks of the Biata river (are clean)’ (14.107)

The rest of the postpositions have not been found in the data in core functions but this does not preclude that — at least some — can. Nevertheless, even when used in oblique function, the morpho-syntactic behaviour of some is very similar to e-nouns.

The two postpositions tsekwe and jiruru (plus another one, =duku ‘INSIDE’) have the same behavior regarding the e- prefix formative when used as obliques: when they have an argument, they do not take an e prefix formative (as in (14.84a)) but when they do not have an argument, then they take an e prefix formative (as in (14.84b) and (14.84c)). (The two other postpositions discussed in (14.86) further below behave similarly.)

570

(14.84) a. punchu=duku escuela tsekwe bei jiruru

‘(we put our load) inside the poncho’ ‘(I arrived) outside of the school’ ‘(he went to the) bank of the lake’

(14.92a) (14.92b) (14.105a)

b. e-duku=ju e-tsekwe=ju e-jiruru=ju

‘(the canoe is carved) inside’ ‘(they sat) outside’ ‘(the cayman is lying) on bank’

(14.93a) (14.93b) (14.106a)

c. e-jiruru=keja ‘(the boat is getting closer) to the bank’ (14.106c)

These postpositions do not require an additional postposition when they have an argument (as in a.). They do however require an additional postposition when they do not have an argument (as in b. and c.) The postposition =ju ‘LOC’ in this case does not carry any meaning and can be seen as a default postposition. Otherwise, the postpositions =keja ‘LOC.GNL’ or =eke ‘PERL’ can substitute =ju (as in c.) and do bring their normal meanings (general location or perlative meaning respectively).

The fact that these five forms require an additional postposition when they themselves do not take an argument is likely the remains of their original nominal status.

The postposition emake ‘under’ differs in an interesting way from the preceding

postpositions in that it does not obligatorily require =ju ‘LOC’ when not taking an

argument as shown in (14.85b):

(14.85) a. pere emake

‘(I put my bag) under the raft.’

(14.87b)

b. emake

‘(We on the plane went) down…’

(14.89)

c. emake=eke

‘(the bridge was rotten) underneath’

(14.91)

Note also that emake begins with an e vowel. However, in this case, the vowel remains in all contexts, even when the postposition takes an argument, as in column a. The vowel e in emake must therefore be treated as part of the root. It is also not clear whether or not it is same e that shows up in e-nouns (and in the preceding postpositions).

The postpositions tibene ‘behind’ and tsuku ‘at corner of’ in (14.86) below are

571

similar to duku, tsekwe, jiruru in that they have an analysable e prefix formative.

However, when not taking an argument, they are only attested with the postposition

=keja and =eke (as in b.). More data is necessary to know whether they require =ju

‘LOC’ or not in this context.

(14.86) a. cajon tibene

‘(the plank is) behind the box’

(14.95a)

e-tare tsuku

‘(I went to urinate) at corner of the house’ (14.99)

b. e-tibene=keja e-tsuku=eke

‘(they pulled him) behind’

(14.98a)

‘(we make a hole) through both corners’ (14.100)

The rest of the postpositions (1) do not show up with any e prefix formative in any contexts and (2) can be marked by =keja ‘LOC.GNL’ and =eke ‘PERL’ but not by =ju ‘LOC’.

The postposition dyake ‘on’ has a closely related postposition idyake ‘above’ whose i in idyake is possibly originally the e prefix formative. However these are two different postpositions with different meanings.

The postposition patya(patya) is likely to be a borrowed term from Aymana or Quechua (see below).

The postposition japadama ‘close to’ is basically the negative adjective (i.e., a da-adjective with negative suffix -dama ‘NEG’; §11.2.4).

The postposition pijidyane comes from particles. It is the lexicalised combination of the diminutive particle =piji and the approximative particle =dyane.

The postposition peke ‘at the side of’ has clearly originated from a verb, peke- ‘carry on side’ (shown in (14.104)).

The postposition tupuju ‘following’ is a lexicalised collocation of the two major postpositions =tupu ‘up to’ (see §14.7) and =ju ‘LOC’ (see §14.4).

The postposition yueketibene ‘farther behind’ is a lexicalised combination of the perlative far-from-speaker-far-from-addressee pro-form yueke ‘over.there:PERL’ and the

572 postposition tibene ‘behind’ from (14.86).

In the following sections, we further discuss and illustrated each or these postposition, grouped by antonymic pairs when possible.

573 14.9.2. ‘On’ vs. ‘under’
Cavineña has a term corresponding to both concepts of ‘on’ and ‘under’: dyake ‘ON’ (illustrated in (14.87a)) and emake ‘UNDER’ (illustrated in (14.87b)):

(14.87) a. … [bakwa=ja kapana]O [armario dyake] iya-eti-kware…

In a few textual examples, we find a postposition idyake with a meaning essentially similar to the postposition dyake. According to speakers, the difference between dyake and idyake is that with the first, there is a direct physical contact between the figure and the ground whereas there is no such contact with idyake. This could roughly correspond to the difference in English between ‘on’ and ‘above’. The pair in (14.88) was proposed by Antonio Yubanera as an illustration:
(14.88) a. mesa dyake table ON ‘(something) on top (and touching) the table’
b. mesa idyake table ABOVE ‘(something) above (and not touching or not touching directly) the table’ n4.0336

574

The postposition emake (and possibly dyake as well, see below) can be used without an argument as shown in (14.89):

(14.89)

Emake=piji =ekwanaS jeti-chine.

UNDER=DIM =1PL

come-REC.PAST

‘We (on the plane) went down a little bit.’ br092

Note that the phrasal particle =piji here is not a property of emake but can occur on any other postpositions (and other types of constituents).

The postposition dyake (and presumably emake as well, see below) can be combined with an additional postposition, as with =eke ‘PERL’ in (14.90):

(14.90)

[Jadya kariketi-e] =ekwanaS ju-ya

Emake, when not taking an argument is also found combined with =eke, as in (14.91). From this example, one might infer that the combination argument-emakeother.postposition is probably also possible (but this requires checking).

‘It happened that the bridge was rotten underneath. But on top, it was hard. (So I crossed and of course the bridge broke.)’ wa071b

In this example, we also see a dyake-other.postposition combination without any argument. From this, one could infer that dyake can be used on its own as well (i.e. without an argument and without an additional postposition) but this requires to be investigated.

575

14.9.3. ‘Inside’ vs. ‘outside’ The concept ‘inside’ is coded by the postposition =duku as in (14.92a). The concept outside is coded by tsekwe as in (14.92b):

(14.92) a. Carga=kwanaO =ekwanaA iya-tsura-kware

b. … [escuela tsekwe] ju-nati… school OUTSIDE be-GO.TEMP
‘… (when) I arrived outside of the school (I was frightened of the teacher).’ es019

Both postpositions =duku ‘INSIDE’ and tsekwe ‘OUTSIDE’, when not taking an argument show up with an e vowel and obligatorily require the postposition =ju (or =keja or =eke) as in (14.93):

(14.93) a. Ikwene=dya =tuS

eduku=ju rure-tana-ya.

‘Mrs Felicia and Mrs Mati sat outside (of the house), next to the fire (to toast manioc).’ md002

576 The origin of tsekwe ‘OUTSIDE’ is clear. It is an e-noun meaning ‘outside’ or possibly more specifically the outside area of a house that is kept cleaned (from the constantly invading forest). This noun is shown in (14.94) as head of an NP is CS function and marked with the plural enclitic =kwana:

(14.94)

14.9.4. ‘Behind’, ‘further behind’ and ‘following’ There is no postposition attested for the concept of ‘in front of’.

On the other hand, there are three postpositions for the concept of ‘behind’: tibene ‘(statically) behind’ shown in (14.95a), yueketibene ‘(statically) farther behind’ shown in (14.95b) and tupuju ‘(dynamically) behind, following’ shown in (14.95c) (note that in this example, tupuju appears twice, once with an argument and once without an argument). (Another example with tupuju is at (14.2b) above.)

‘I followed (lit. went following) my wife (who had gone to her father’s house). I went behind…’ ju024

The two postpositions tibene and yueketibene are obviously related, yueke-tibene being made of tibene preceded by the perlative far-from-speaker-far-from-addressee pro-form yu-eke ‘over.there-PERL’ (see an example in (14.55c) above).

The postposition tibene is found lexicalised with the time particles metajudya ‘tomorrow’ as metajudya-tibene ‘the day after tomorrow’ and barepatya ‘yesterday’ as barepatya-)tibene ‘the day before yesterday’ (here barepatya is optional, see below) as shown in (14.96):

Both postpositions yueketibene and tupuju are attested without an argument as in (14.97a) (another example is (T1.9)):

578 As for the postposition tibene the closest we have to a usage without an argument is with an e vowel as etibene and combined with an additional postposition, as in (14.98):

Etibene=keja =tunaA

‘They (my dogs) pulled it (a ferocious anteater) behind (in order to save me from its terrible claws).’ ba095

(Note that, as we saw in (14.96), tibene is found as such without an e vowel and without an argument but then it exclusively means ‘the day before yesterday’.)

14.9.5. ‘At the corner of’ The postposition tsuku ‘at corner of’ is illustrated in (14.99):

(14.99)

… wira-ti-kware

[e-tare tsuku].

urinate-GO.TEMP-REM.PAST NPF-house AT.CORNER.OF

‘…I went to urinate at the corner (lit. hip) of the house.’ bc004

Tsuku is shown without an argument and with an additional postposition marking in (14.100):

‘(Then we make the tail of the basket.) After that, we (dl) make a hole through both corners (and we insert the tail inside the holes).’ ab070

This postposition is clearly related to a e-noun -tsuku ‘hip, corner’ as illustrated in O in (14.101):

One example from the dictionary, given in (14.103), shows peke without an argument:

ebakwa=kwanaS.

‘The children are standing at one side.’ di2211

Otherwise, peke is not attested combined with other postpositions.

The origin of this postposition is most likely the verb peke- ‘carry O on one’s side’ shown in (14.104).

‘I put the rifle on my side and I left.’ sl024

14.9.7. ‘At the edge of’ The postposition jiruru means ‘at the edge of’. In most cases jiruru is found marking water entities (rivers or lakes) as in (14.105) below. But it is also used in one example

580 with fire as e-tiki jiruru ‘next to the fire’ (in (14.93) above).

Examples with jiruru without an argument and/or with an addition postposition are shown in (14.106):

The nominal origin of jiruru is proven by its occurrence in core function such as CS function in (14.107):

14.9.8. ‘In the middle of’ The postposition patya means ‘in/to the middle of’ as illustrated in (14.108):

Patya — unlike all other postpositions — is also found (fully) reduplicated (as patyapatya). From the examples available, both postpositions are identical semantically as well as morpho-syntactically but more work might reveal some differences. An example of patyapatya is shown in (14.109):

‘He (the bullock) went somewhere to the middle of the airstrip (rather than the side, where we wanted him to go).’ at012

Patya is likely to be a borrowed term from Aymana pacha ‘place’ (Girard 1971: 139) or Quechua pacha ‘world, universe’ (W. Adelaar, p.c.).

14.9.9. ‘Close to’
There are two postpositions meaning ‘close to’: pijidyane (a lexicalised combination of the diminutive particle =piji and the approximative particle =dyane) and japadama which is the negated version of the adjective japa- ‘far’. These are illustrated in (14.112):

(14.112) a. [Riberalta pijidyane] =ekwanaS warere-chine.

Riberalta CLOSE.TO =1PL

‘… a very strong lightning fell (very) close (lit. not far) to us (dl).’ cu022
There are no clear semantic differences between the two postpositions. Also, only the

583 negated version of japa- is found as a postposition (i.e. with an argument) in the data. More work is needed to see if this is also possible for the non-negated version of the adjective.
Japadama is attested without an argument. Pijidyane on the other hand is never used this way.
Neither japadama nor pijidyane are found combined with other postpositions.

15 Pronouns and demonstratives
In this chapter, we discuss pronouns and demonstratives. Pronouns refer to people, animals, plants, or things while demonstratives refer to places.
There are two types of pronouns in Cavineña: independent pronouns (§15.1) and bound pronouns (§15.2). Independent and bound pronouns have essentially the same segmental make-up. They code person, number and case with the same roots and suffixes. They both include a set of 3rd person proximate pronouns (in addition to a set of distance-neutral 3rd person pronouns). However, independent and bound pronouns have very different morpho-syntactic properties. Independent pronouns are phonologically and grammatically independent words that fill core NP or PP slots. Bound pronouns are enclitics (grammatically independent but phonologically bound) in second position in main clauses. Bound pronouns undergo a number of morphological modifications not attested with independent pronouns. They only occur in certain types of main clauses.
Bound pronouns can co-occur with independent pronouns (or an NP) coding the same function. This is discussed in §15.3.
Singular 3rd person pronouns can refer to non-singular referents. This is discussed in §15.4.
Two morphemes, ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘3PL’ strongly resemble independent pronouns but have a number of idiosyncratic properties. They are treated separately under §15.6.
Cavineña has two types of demonstratives: adverbial demonstratives (§15.7) and pointing demonstratives (§15.8) (note that Cavineña does not have specific demonstratives functioning within NPs). Both types code three degrees of distance

585 ‘near’ vs. ‘mid’ vs. ‘far’. The first type, adverbial demonstratives, can be used instead of locative, general locative and perlative postpositional phrases. They are always anaphoric in nature. The second type, pointing demonstratives, do not substitute for any particulal postpositional phrase. They are not used anaphorically and normally require a pointing gesture (whereas this is optional with adverbial demonstratives).

15.1. Independent pronouns
Independent pronouns fill NP or PP slots. They refer to people, animals, plants, or things (but not locations). They code categories of person, number, case and distance (for 3rd person).

15.1.1. Syntax
Independent pronouns have the following syntactic properties: 1 — independent pronouns fill core NP slot (Chapters 12 and 13) or PP slots (Chapter 14) (note that not all types of PP can be filled by a pronoun; see further below).

Examples showing a 1st person singular pronoun filling NP slots in core function within a main clause are given in (15.1) (independent pronouns are in bold face; bound pronouns — to be discussed in §15.2 — are preceded by an equal sign ‘=‘):

587 An example of a 1st person singular independent pronoun filling a genitive slot (slot C of NP structure) is in (15.3) (see also (15.1a)):

(15.3)

[E-kwe e-bakujuna=ekana=ra]A =ØO

1SG-GEN 1-daughter=PL=ERG

dunu-tsa-chine=dya. surround-COME(O)-REC.PAST=FOC
(When I arrived home after a long journey,) my daughters surrounded me.’ ka541

An example of a 1st person singular independent pronoun filling the A slot within a subordinate clause is in (15.4):

(15.4)

[E-raA butseeju salonO ina-ya=tibu]

=tu-raA =ØO

‘Because it was the first time I was using (lit. grabbing) a rifle, she (my sister-in-law) did not believe me (when I told her that I had killed a deer).’ sl067

2 — Independent pronouns typically come first in main clauses (as can be seen in the previous examples) — this correlates with the fact that independent pronouns are essentially used for contrast — but this is not a requirement. Similar to NPs and PPs, independent pronouns can potentially occur anywhere in a clause.

Examples of a 1st person singular independent pronoun in A function occurring as the second (in a.) and fourth (in b.) (immediate) constituent in main clauses are given in (15.5):

(15.5) a. Iyakwa =miO

then =3SG-FM (=1SG-ERG) 3SG-GEN lid open-REM.PAST 1SG-ERG

‘I opened its (bottle) lid.’ bc020

3 — Independent pronouns make up a whole NP or PP in themselves. They are heads on their own. They cannot take any NP modifiers (such as quantifier, juxtaposed noun, attributive adjective, number marker, relative clause; see discussion of NP structure in §12.1 and Chapter 13). Independent pronouns can be marked for number or case, but these are affixes on the pronoun roots, not NP modifiers.

15.1.2. Morphology
There are seven sets of independent pronouns, according to the function they play in a clause: 1 — absolutive (unmarked) pronouns fill an S/CS1 and O NP slot (they can presumably also fill a CC slot, although no example could be found in the data); 2 — ergative pronouns fill a A NP slot; 3 — dative pronouns fill a dative PP slot (§14.3); 4 — genitive pronouns (which are homophonous with dative pronouns) fill a genitive PP slot (§13.4; see §14.3.3 for an discussion of the differences between dative and genitive constituents); 5 — associative pronouns fill an associative a PP slot (§14.2); 6 — general locative pronouns fill a general locative PP slot (§14.5); 7 — ‘alone’ pronouns fill a ‘alone’ PP slot (§14.8.4).

The seven sets of independent pronouns are given in Table 15.1 (dative and genitive pronouns which are homophonous are given together). (A question mark ‘?’ means that the forms were not attested in the data but could logically exist.)

1 S and CS independent (as well as bound) pronouns are morpho-syntactially identical.

Cavineña pronouns are synthetic and essentially agglutinative. We can recognise pronominal roots (encoding simultaneously person as well as two degrees of distance for 3rd person forms) and 2 layers of suffixes (number and case), that occur in the following order: ROOT-NUM-CASE. Note that Cavineña does not encode any inclusive versus exclusive distinction, although this distinction is found in other Tacana languages. An inclusive/exclusive distinction is attested in Araona (Pitman 1980: 82)

590 and Tacana (Van Wynen y Van Wynen 1962: 200) where they are marked by suffixes on the pronominal roots (-da ‘inclusive’ versus -ma ‘exclusive’ in Araona and da ‘inclusive’ versus -a ‘exclusive’ in Tacana).

Pronoun components show some degree of allomorphy, i.e., some components show up

in various forms. The choice of the forms is conditioned by their morphological

environment (they are not predictable phonologically), as follows:

— the root encodes person and 2 degrees of distance (in 3rd person) as shown in (15.6):

(15.6) e/i/ya/ea

‘1st person’ (speaker)

mi/me/mia ‘2nd person’ (addressee)

tu/ta/tua

‘3rd person distance-neutral’ (neither speaker nor addressee)

ri/re/riya

‘3rd person proximal’ (neither speaker nor addressee)

Non-singular roots are the most regular. There is a set of dual roots (ya, me, ta, re) and a set of plural roots (e, mi, tu, re), as summarised in Table 15.2:

(15.7) -Ø

‘SG’

-tse

‘DL’

-kwana/-na ‘PL’

There are two variants for plural (-kwana/-na). The suffix -kwana is selected by 1st and 2nd persons. The suffix -na is selected by 3rd person. This is summarised in Table 15.4:

Note that -kwana is homophonous with the plural enclitic number marker =kwana ‘PL’ (slot G of NP structure; see §13.3). The suffix -tse (perhaps related to associative suffix -tsewe or associative postposition =tsewe; §14.2) and -na do not occur anywhere else in the language.

-kwe/-ja ‘GEN’

-tsewe -keja -ta(taka)/-taka

‘ASSOC’ ‘LOC.GNL’ ‘ALONE’2

Dative/genitive case suffixes are irregular. They are realised by -kwe with singular 1st and 2nd person (see (15.2b) for an example of a 1st person singular dative pronoun and (15.3) for an example of a 1st person singular genitive pronoun) whereas it is -ja with all other person and number (see (15.5b) for an example of 3rd person singular genitive
pronoun). The distribution of -kwe and -ja is summarised in Table 15.5:

2 Note that we use the term ‘case’ in a broad sense, including ‘alone’ suffixes, which code the manner in which an action is performed.

Singular ‘alone’ pronouns are marked by -ta or -tataka (the form -tataka possibly has a more emphatic meaning than -ta, i.e., ‘really alone’) whereas non-singular ‘alone’ pronouns are marked by -taka. The ‘alone’ suffix variants distribute as in Table 15.6:

The three suffixes are illustrated in (15.9) (see additional examples in §14.8.4):

tawi-ya. sleep-IMPFV

‘(When the children are brave,) they sleep alone during a journey (lit. when it gets dark on the path).’ di1134

Note that most case suffixes have corresponding postpositions as given in (15.10):

593

(15.10) no marking ‘ABS’

=tsewe ‘ASSOC’ (§14.2)

=ja

‘DAT’ (§14.3) =taka ‘ALONE’ (§14.8.4)

=ja

‘GEN’ (§13.4)

This could suggest a unitary analysis where both pronominal case and postpositions represent a single category. In this study, we have preferred to treat them as distinct, on the basis that: (1) different case suffixes often require different stems (at least with singular pronouns), whereas this never happens with postpositions, and (2) some pronominal cases suffixes have variants that are not found with postpositions (as with 1st and 2nd person singular dative/genitive suffix -kwe and singular ‘alone’ suffixes -ta and -tataka).

— a suffix formative -ke ‘FM’ occurs with absolutive (S/O) singular (but not dual and plural) pronouns. This suffix drops when these pronouns take the focus particle =dya (§17.4). This is illustrated in (15.11) ((15.11a) is (T1.22):

15.2. Bound pronouns
In addition to independent pronouns, Cavineña also has bound pronouns. They basically have the same segmental make-up but quite different morpho-syntactic properties. Note that the distinction between independent and bound pronouns was not made in earlier

594 work on Cavineña — Camp and Liccardi (1977, 1983, 1989) and Camp (1989).

15.2.1. Syntax
Bound pronouns have the following syntactic properties: 1 — bound pronouns have a fixed position. Together with second position particles (§16.3), bound pronouns are enclitics to the last phonological word of the first immediate constitutent of a main clause. (For a discussion of other languages with bound pronouns in clausal second position, see Hale 1973, discussing the Australian language Walbiri, and Bickel and Nichols 2001, discussing the Uto-Aztecan language Luiseño.) Bound pronouns obligatorily follow second position particles (when these are present) as shown in (15.12) (second position morphemes are in bold face):

(See also (15.2c), (15.19d), (15.24a), (15.26c), etc.)

595 Up to three bound pronouns (coding A, O and DAT) can co-occur, as shown in (15.13).

Co-occurring pronouns are essentially ordered according to a person hierarchy whereby 3rd person precedes 1st and/or 2nd person, and 2nd precedes 1st person. This is discussed at length in §15.2.3.

— bound pronouns only occur in certain types of clauses: (1) main declarative affirmative (verbal or copula) clauses, as in (15.12a,b.c). (See §4.6.1 and §4.6.3); (2) main declarative negative (verbal or copula) clauses, as in (15.1a), (15.4), (15.52), etc. (See §4.6.6.) (3) main non-declarative interrogative (verbal or copula) clauses, as in (15.1c), (15.19b,c), (15.23b), etc. (See §4.6.5.)

Bound pronouns do not occur in the following types of clauses; (1) main non-declarative imperative, hortative and jussive clauses (see §4.6.4 and §6.2); (2) subordinate clauses (see Chapters 18, 19 and 20).

596

15.2.2. Morphology
There are three sets of bound pronouns: 1 — absolutive (unmarked) bound pronouns refer to an argument in core S/CS or O function; 2 — ergative bound pronouns refer to an argument in core A function; 3 — dative bound pronouns refer to a participant in oblique DAT function.

The three sets of bound pronouns are given in Table 15.7:

PL e-kwana mi-kwana tu-na re-na e-kwana-ra mi-kwana-ra tu-na-ra re-na-ra e-kwana-ja mi-kwana-ja tu-na-ja re-na-ja

The three sets of bound pronouns are almost identical in form to their corresponding set of independent pronouns (see full morphological analysis in §15.1.2)). The only difference concerns 3PROX singular roots. The root of 3PROX singular independent pronouns is riya whereas it is ri for absolutive bound pronouns and re (for dative) bound pronouns. There are no attested 3PROX bound pronouns in A function in the whole corpus of texts. However, the form riya-ra (identical to the A singular independent pronoun) was obtained in elicitation (from Francisco Vaca) with example (15.14):

3 We are not fully sure of this pronoun. See discussion below.

=i-keO.

look.at-IMPFV =3PROX.SG-ERG =1SG-FM

‘He (someone very close to me) is looking at me.’ n3.0514

More examples are required to confirm the existence of this 3PROX A bound pronoun. Note that the forms *ri-ra and *re-ra (3PROX-ERG) as well as *ri-ja and *re-ja (based on the root form of absolutive and dative bound pronouns) were not accepted.

Although bound pronouns have the same form as independent pronouns, they undergo quite different morphological processes, as follows: 1 — the formative suffix -ke (of singular absolutive bound pronouns) and the ergative suffix -ra (in ergative bound pronouns) do not show up when absolutive or ergative pronouns occur last in the 2P (second position) clitic sequence (unless they are also last in the sentence; see further below).

I observed that young Cavineña children often make the mistake of not dropping -ke or -ra when they would normally be dropped. A typical question children ask me when they come to visit is ‘what are you doing?’. The normal way of asking this is (15.28a) (dropping -ke from the 2nd person singular O bound pronoun since it occurs last in 2P). However, some young children sometimes say (15.28b):

603

‘What are you doing?’ n5.0539

b. *Ai

=mi-keS ju-ya?

do.what =2SG-FM be-IMPFV

I have also oberved that some young adult speakers with whom I have been working, such as Francisco Vaca or Emerenciano Sepa (but not others — typically older speakers — such as Alfredo Tavo or Antonio Yubanera), do sometimes get confused about when -ke or -ra have to be dropped or retained. This was noted while transcribing recorded texts where they wrongly reproduce (mistakenly using -ke or -ra) what is heard in the tape. Listening (15.29) on the tape, it is clear that Victoria Tavo (the author of the text) drops the ergative suffix -ra from A bound pronoun =yatse ‘1DL’ (as expected). However, when asked to repeat the sentence (during transcription), Emerenciano Sepa said the abnormal form =yatse-ra.

What possibly happens is that children as well as these younger speakers are mistaking bound pronouns for independent pronouns (where -ke and -ra are not dropped).

15.2.3. Principles of bound pronoun ordering Co-occurring bound pronouns have strict ordering restrictions which involve the following person hierarchy: 1 > 2 > 3 (the symbol ‘>’ means ‘higher than’).
The lower a bound pronoun is on the hierarchy scale, the earlier it occurs in the string. In other words, 3rd person precedes 1st and/or 2nd person, and 2nd precedes 1st person.
Example (15.30) and (15.19a) (repeated) show that a 3rd person bound pronoun (whether in A or O function) precedes a 1st person bound pronoun (whether in A or O

604 function):

ba-chine. see-REC.PAST

‘We (dl) saw it (that bird about which I am telling you a story) in Misión Cavinas.’ hi010

Examples (15.15a) and (15.19b) (both repeated) show that a 3rd person bound pronoun (whether in A or O function) precedes a 2nd person bound pronoun (whether in A or O function):

(15.15a) A3 (sg) / O2 (sg)

[Mi-keCC [chapa metse]CC=tibu] =tu-raA =miO

AiO =tu-keO =miA

mare-wa?

INT =3SG-FM =2SG(-ERG) shoot-PERF

‘What did you (sg) shoot?’ lg019

Examples in (15.31) show that a 2nd person bound pronoun (whether in A or O function) precedes a 1st person bound pronoun (whether in A or O function):

605 (15.31) a. A2 (sg) / O1 (pl)

E-tya-u=ama

duju-nuka-ya yudijidya. take-REITR-IMPFV once.more

‘Now we (pl) will take you (sg) again.’ di0036

The example in (15.32) shows that a 2nd person DAT precedes a 1st person A:

(15.32)

Enajewe ekwe keti-kwe! alcohol 1SG.DAT fetch-IMP.SG

[Salon keti jadya] =mi-raA =e-kwe a-ya. rifle fetch thus =2SG-ERG =1SG-DAT affect-IMPFV
‘Go get my alcohol! And you’ll bring me the rifle as well.’ ce048

Co-occurring bound pronoun coding the same person distribute as follows (note that a 3rd person A cannot co-occur with a 3rd person O; see §15.2.4): — a 1st/2nd person S/A/O bound pronoun precedes a DAT bound pronoun coding the same person as shown in (15.33):

‘I went to look at my (injured) dog.’ ba155

— a 3rd person S/O follows 3rd person DAT as shown in (15.34) (note that a 3rd person A cannot co-occur with a 3rd person DAT; see §15.2.4):

15.2.4. Ordering restrictions

Table 15.8 summarises all attested combinations of bound pronouns. The numbers following the A, O, S and DAT refer to person. A question mark ‘?’ means that the combination is logically possible but not attested. Unattested combinations considered grammatically impossible are coded by dark shaded cells. The symbol ‘REF’ refers to combinations that result in the verb taking reflexive morphology and being detransitivised (§8.2).

There are restrictions while combining A and O pronouns: an A bound pronoun cannot co-occur with an O bound pronoun that is non-singular and lower on the hierarchy scale.

This can be illustrated with the following minimal pair involving a 1st person A bound pronoun. Example (15.35a) is grammatical because the O bound pronoun is 3rd person singular. However, (15.35b) is ungrammatical because the O bound pronoun is 3rd person non-singular:

607

b. *Jadya =tunaO =yatseA ba-ti-kware. thus =3PL =1DL(-ERG) see-go.temp-REM.PAST

n5.0176

They only possible way to code an A argument acting over an O argument that is nonsingular and lower on the hierarchy scale is to combine one of the two bound pronouns with an independent A pronoun (as in (15.36)) or a full NP (for the O argument):

(15.36)

Tume =metseO yatse-raA kweja-ya

INT hour 1PL

emerge -IMPFV=LIG

‘We (dl) will tell you (later) at what time we will leave (lit. emerge) (tomorrow).’ n5.0179

To summarise, possible combinations of A and O bound pronouns are (15.37a) (A co-

occurs with singular O lower in hierarchy) and (15.37b) (A co-occurs with O of any

number higher in hierarchy) but not (15.37c) (A co-occurs with non-singular O lower in

hierarchy):

(15.37) a. A1 (any number) / O2 (sg)

(15.27a,b), (15.31b), (15.51)

A1 (any number) / O3/3PROX (sg) (15.5b), (15.16), (15.19a), (15.23b)

A2 (any number) / O3/3PROX (sg) (15.19b,c), (15.26b)

b. A3/3PROX (any number) / O1 (any number) (15.4), (15.11), (15.20a)

A3/3PROX (any number) / O2 (any number) (15.15a), (15.24b)

A2 (any number) / O1 (any number)

(15.31a)

c. *A1 (any number) / O2 (dl or pl) *A1 (any number) / O3/3PROX (dl or pl) *A2 (any number) / O3/3PROX (dl or pl)

608

There are also a number of restrictions that apply while combining 3rd person
bound pronouns: — a 3rd person A (whether 3 or 3PROX) cannot co-occur with a 3rd person O (whether 3 or 3PROX). Examples of A3/O3 situations are shown in (15.38) (with a 3rd person A bound pronoun) and (15.39) (with a 3rd person O bound pronouns):

‘He told the ones from the village.’ fd035

Note that it is still possible to code both, the A and the O, 3rd person arguments, but this needs to be done by coding at least one of these arguments with an independent pronouns (as in (15.39b)) or a full NP.

— a 3rd person DAT (either 3 or 3PROX; of any number) never co-occurs with a 3rd person A (either 3 or 3PROX; of any number). It can only co-occur with a 3rd person S/O which (1) has to be singular and (2) has to be of the same (distance) type (i.e., D3 / S/O3 (sg) or D3PROX / S/O3PROX (sg) but not *D3PROX / S/O3 (sg) or *D3 / S/O3PROX (sg)).

Examples showing 3rd person DAT co-occurring with 3rd person (singular) O are given in (15.40):

The two Os of ditransitive verbs (§5.2.1) cannot co-occur as bound pronouns. The single O bound pronoun can be either of the two Os (i.e., either message or ‘communicatee’ with kweja- ‘inform’, either recipient or gift with tya- ‘give’, etc.).

In (15.42a), with the verb kweja- ‘inform’, the O bound pronoun refers to the 3rd person message (the 2nd person, the ‘communicatee’, is refered to by an independent pronoun), while in (15.42b), the O bound pronoun refer to the (2nd person) ‘communicatee’ (the 3rd person message is referred to by an NP):

15.3. Bound pronouns vs. independent pronouns/NP
Ergative, absolutive and dative functions can logically be coded either by independent pronouns/NPs or bound pronouns, or both at the same time, or by no marking at all. The purpose of this section is to discuss how each of these three functions are formally coded in Cavineña. The functional motivations for choosing one coding over another require further study.

15.3.1. A function
Ergative function can be coded either: 1 — by an independent pronoun/full NP or; 2 — by a bound pronoun or; 3 — by a bound pronoun co-occurring with an independent pronoun/NP (with some restrictions; see further below).
Ergative function is obligatorily coded for all person and number (unlike S/O functions with 3rd person singular; see 15.3.2). However, note that a 1st person singular A bound pronoun is =Ø if it comes last in the 2P clitic chain (§15.2.2). Note also that a number of examples suggest that in some situations, 1st person singular might not be coded at all

612 (i.e. there would not even be a Ø-marker).

The three different coding possibilities for ergative function are illustrated in turn below. 1 — function A only coded by an independent pronoun can be seen in (15.1a), (15.5a), (15.15b) and (15.21b).

Function A only coded by a full NP can be see at (15.3) and (15.21a) (preposed to the verb) and (15.43a) (postposed to the verb):

2 — Examples showing function A only coded by a bound pronoun can be seen at (15.1c), (15.4), (15.15), (15.11a) (repeated), (15.44a) (this is (T1.75)) and (15.44b) (this is (T1.106)):

‘“This (medicinal plant) is good (for treating rheumatism),” I told him.’ ao106

3 — Examples showing function A coded by a bound pronoun co-occurring with an independent pronoun/NP are rare but nevertheless possible. When this happens, the independent pronoun/NP always occurs postposed to the verb (headless A NPs are possibly an exception; see below).

Examples of A bound pronouns co-occurring with A NPs (postposed to the verb) are given in (15.45) and (15.19d) (repeated):

Headless A NPs appear to be an exception to the (preceding) statement that an A NP co-occurring with a bound pronoun in A function always occur postposed to the verb. In a few examples a headless NP occurs preposed to the verb and co-occurs with an A bound pronoun. This can be seen in (15.47a) (headless verbal relative clause) and (15.47b) (headless quantifier) and (15.47c) (headless copula relative clause):

It was said that A function is obligatorily coded for all person and number. However, the examples in (15.48) possibly contradict this statement. (Note that (15.48b) is (T1.69) and (15.48c) is (T1.95)):

One could argue that in these examples, 1st person singular A is a Ø-marked bound pronoun (as happens when a 1st singular A bound pronoun occurs last in the 2P clitic chain). However, this is not a good analysis because the A1 / O2 (non-singular) (as in (15.48a,b)) and A1 / O3 (non-singular) (as in (15.48c)) combinations of bound pronouns are not allowed (see §15.2.4). These examples could suggest that (at least in this particular context where it is not possible to have co-occurring A and O bound pronouns) a 1st person singular A does not have to receive any coding (similarly to 3rd

616 person singular S/O; see §15.3.2).

15.3.2. S/O function
S/O function can be coded either: 1 — by an independent pronoun/full NP or; 2 — by a bound pronoun or; 3 — by a bound pronoun co-occurring with an independent pronoun/NP (without any of the restrictions that apply when coding the A function in that situation; see previous section) or; 4 — no coding for 3rd person singular S/O.

The four different possibilities for coding O function are illustrated in turn below: 1 — O function only coded by an independent pronoun can be seen in (15.49):

(15.49) a. Mikwana=piisiO e-raA iwa-ya.

(15.50) a. MercedeO =ekwanaA ba-diru-kware. Las.Mercedes =1PL(-ERG) see-GO.PERM-REM.PAST ‘(On our way black, flying toward our community Bolivar,) we saw (the community of) Las Mercedes.’ av022

Note that (15.3) is potentially ambiguous. The O object could as well refer to a 3rd person singular since 3rd person singular is not obligatorily marked. (Example (15.53a), for example, is identical to (15.3) in term of coding, but has a 3rd person singular O.) However, the context makes it clear that the speaker is the person that is ‘surrounded’ (not someone else) in (15.3). The speaker (Victoria Tavo) relates how, as she finally arrives home after an two day trip, she is warmly welcomed back by her family.

‘(The tapir we were chasing had disappeared somewhere in the water.) We (dl) waited for it a long time (to reappear).’ ma024

It might be argued that in these examples, there are no (underlying) O argument (whose identity is to be retrieved from context) and that the verbs refer to activities (‘eating’ and ‘waiting’). This does not appear to be the case for at least two reasons. First, both clauses remain fully transitive. In (15.53a), for example, we have an A NP argument coded with the ergative case =ra ‘ERG’. Secondly, decreasing the valency of a verb in Cavineña can only be achieved by overt derivation (there are basically no ambitransitive verbs). Demoting the O argument would require as an antipassive derivation (involving full reduplication of the verb root; see §8.3.1).

Note that (15.53a) is potentially ambiguous. In this example, the O argument could as well be a 1st person singular (since a 1st person singular O bound pronoun occurring last in a 2P clitic chain is =Ø). (Compare this example with (15.3) which receives the exact same coding but has a 1st person singular O.) Sentence (15.53a) follows a stretch of discourse which refers to the cooking of a wild turkey so it is clear that the turkey (3rd person) is the O (and not the speaker). In addition, a 1st person can hardly be the O of the verb ara- ‘eat’ unless it would occur in a very particular and marked context. (See further below for another ambiguity situation between a 1st and 3rd person singular S arguments.)

Note that when S is coded by a 1st person singular independent pronoun, as in (15.1b) (repeated), there is no possibility of knowing whether is co-occurs or not with a bound pronoun since such a pronoun is =Ø.

621 Note that these (15.55) and (15.22c) are potentially ambiguous. Here, the S argument could as well be 3rd person singular since 3rd person singular is not obligatorily coded. In terms of coding, these two examples are identical to the examples given in (15.58) which have 3rd person singular S. The exact identity of the S argument in these situations is recovered from context. In (15.22c) Francisco Vaca relates one of his hunting expeditions. He is the subject (1st person singular S or A) of most of the sentences that precede (15.22c) so that it is quite clear that he is the S or that sentence as well. In the case of (15.55), we do not have any context because this example was elicited (and 1st person singular reading was given by the Spanish translation).

‘(I can’t kill that anteater here because the forest is too thick.) Let’s see if it will go (lit. emerge) to the pampa!’ ba132

We mentioned earlier that these examples could be interpreted as having a 1st person singular reading (in terms of core argument coding, there are identical with (15.55) and (15.22c) which have a 1st person singular S). The story from which (15.58a) comes from only makes reference to 3rd person arguments (a man and a viper). A 1st person reading for the A argument would not make any sense. In the context of (15.58b), the action of ‘going to the pampa’ only makes sense if it refers to the anteater because we have been told earlier that if the anteater remains in the forest, the hunter (1st person) cannot kill it.

It could be argued that, similarly to 1st person singular S/O or 1st person singular A, the absence of 3rd person marking corresponds to an underlying Ø-marked 3rd person singular bound pronoun. This does not appear to be a good analysis for the reason that there are no positive evidence of any such underlying pronoun. This is quite unlike the Ø-marking that characterises 1st person singular S/O or 1st person singular A bound pronouns. Recall that these bound pronouns do surface when (1) they are followed by another bound pronoun in the 2P clitic chain (see O in (15.16), S in (15.18a,b), and A in (15.20a,b)) or when they occurs last in the sentence (see O in (15.24), S in (15.25), and A in (15.26)).

15.3.3. DAT function
DAT function can be coded either: 1 — by an independent pronoun/NP or; 2 — by a bound pronoun.

623

No example could be found of a DAT bound pronoun co-occurring with a DAT independent pronoun/NP.

The four different possibilities for coding the dative function are illustrated below: 1 — DAT function only coded by an independent pronoun is illustrated in (15.2b).

DAT function only coded by a full NP are illustrated in (15.59) (see additional examples in §14.3):

(15.59) a. Sergio=ja ani-ya [ata Sergio=DAT sit-IMPFV relative

Ramon bakani]S. Ramón name

‘Sergio had a relative called Ramón (lit. a relative call.’ sg019

b. [Ebadeki baba ebari]S ani-ya [Hermano Antonio=ja]. hammock unique big be-IMPFV brother Antonio=DAT
‘Brother Antonio has an exceptionally big hammock.’ n5.0527

2 — DAT function coded by an bound pronoun only are illustrated in (15.12c), (15.13a,b,c), (15.18a,b), (15.20b), etc.

15.4. Number
It was noted that 3rd person singular pronouns (either distance-neutral or proximate, either bound or independent) can refer to plural referents. This never happens with 1st or 2nd person pronouns.

Example (15.60) (note that this is (T2.11)) shows a 3rd person singular independent pronouns in A function referring to ‘mosquitoes’:

(15.60)

Tu-raA =pa =tuO

amena tirya-kware [tuja e-rami]O.

3SG.ERG =REP =3SG(-FM) FILL finish-REM.PAST 3SG.GEN NPF-flesh

‘They (gigantic mosquitoes) finished her flesh.’ mm011

624

Examples with 3rd person singular bound pronoun referring to plural entities are in (15.13a,b), (15.16), (15.25c), (15.35a), (15.41c), (15.65a,b), (15.71a,b) and (15.61):

(15.61)

Jadya =tu-keO =ØA

ba-ti-kware

Arauna=kwanaO.

thus =3SG-FM (=1SG-ERG) see-GO.TEMP-REM.PAST Araona.person=PL

‘Thus I went to see the Araonas.’ pa103

This parallels the fact that number is not an obligatory category of the noun phrase in Cavineña (absence of non-singular markers =ekatse ‘DL’ or =kwana ‘PL’ in an NP does not necessarily imply that the referent is singular; see §13.3.2). Alternatively, it could be the case that in these examples, 3rd person singular pronouns refer to a collective, nonindividuated, referent (i.e., ‘the group of mosquitoes’ in (15.60) and ‘the group of Araonas’ in (15.61)).

15.5. 3PROX pronouns
3PROX (bound and independent) pronouns are a fascinating aspect of the Cavineña pronominal system. Their function is unfortunately not yet fully understood. In this section, we show that (at least part of) their meaning is to make reference to entities which are spatially close to the speaker at the time of speech. They contrast with 3rd person distance-neutral pronouns which do not specify any distance.

Examples (15.62) and (15.63) come from a story where Alfredo Tavo relates a visit he made to a Pakawara family in their own house. At this point of the story, he tells the Pakawara man the names of what he sees in Cavineña. There is first an owl bird sitting very close to him (i.e., Alfredo) so he points to it and says (15.62), using a 3PROX pronoun co-occurring with a headless (near-speaker) demonstrative relative clause in CS function:

(15.62)

JeeCC=keCS =riCS here=LIG =3PROX.SG(-FM)

[e-kwe y-ana=ju]

“pupu”.

1SG-GEN NPF-tongue=LOC owl

‘In my (Cavineña) language (lit. tongue), this (owl bird) is (called) “pupu” (i.e., owl).’ pa066

625 Then, there is a ‘burgo bird’ which is located away from both Alfredo Tavo (and the Pacahuara man). Alfredo points to it and says (15.63), using a 3rd person (non-proximal) pronoun co-occurring with a headless (away from speaker-and-addressee) demonstrative relative clause in CS function:

(15.63)

YumeCC=keCS =tuCS

uruCC

[e-kwe y-ana=ju].

over.there=LIG =3SG(-FM) burgo.bird 1-SG-GEN NPF-tongue=LOC

‘That (burgo bird) over there is (called) “uru” in my language.’ pa074

Example (15.64) comes from a recorded conversation between Cavineña men doing community work. At some point, they ask me the price of the tape-recorder (which is sitting between them). I tell them that it is very expensive. Vidal Mayo hasn’t heard me so Carmelo Camaconi repeats what I said, using a 3PROX bound pronoun co-occurring with a headless (near-speaker) demonstrative relative clause in CS function:

(15.64)

Tsuje-ari-daCC =pa =riCS

jee=keCS.

price-big-ASF =REP =3PROX.SG(-FM) hereCC=LIG

‘It (tape recorder here) is very expensive (lit. high-priced)!’ tb053

The first evening of my stay at Misión Cavinas I was talking with Lucas Tavo. As I was commenting on the extraordinary amount of mosquitoes, he said (15.65a), comfirming my observation. When I asked Lucas why he didn’t say (15.65b) — i.e., using the distance-neutral bound pronoun —, he replied that this would have meant that he was referring to mosquitoes of a different place (i.e., not Misión Cavinas).
(15.65) a. Uma-daCC =ri-keCS! many-ASF =3PROX-FM ‘(You are right), there are many mosquitoes here!’
b. Uma-daCC =tu-keCS! many-ASF =3SG-FM ‘There are many mosquito there.’ n5.0004

626 In (15.66), Victoria Tavo and her daughter had been travelling an entire day with an ox-cart to fetch me who had arrived at Baqueti, a nearby community. When they arrive at Baqueti, they cannot find me. Victoria says to herself:

[ju-na-chine=ke

hermano]CS?

be-COME.TEMP-REC.PAST=LIG brother

‘Where on earth is the brother who has arrived (and who is supposed to be here!)?’ ka136

In (15.67), Alfredo Tavo relates how in the olden days, their enemies had ambushed and killed one of their (Cavineña) women. They had cut off her breasts and the flesh of her legs to give it to the old women back in their village. The one that carries the breasts and the flesh repeats to himself, joyfully (using a 3PROX bound pronoun in O function to refer to the flesh):

(15.67)

Duju-ya =ri-keO

=ØA

take-IMPFV =3PROX.SG-FM (=1SG-ERG)

[[e-kwe e-anu=ja]

1SG-GEN 1-grandmother=DAT very nice-ASF=LIG

‘I’m taking (there, to our village) what my grandmother likes very much (lit. what is very nice to my grandmother).’ vz094

Similarly, in (15.15b), the O bound pronoun =ri ‘3PROX(-FM)’ refers to a wild turkey that the speaker is holding.
One wonders if 3PROX Cavineña pronouns are not part of an inverse system as found, for example, in Algonquian languages. Those languages have two different 3rd person pronouns used to help tracking down 3rd person referents in ambiguous A3/O3 function/person combinations. The ‘proximate’ pronoun makes reference to the most topical referent. The ‘obviative’ pronoun makes reference to the less topical referent (Payne 1997: 212). However, too little is known about 3PROX pronouns at the present

627 time to make such a statement.

15.6. Ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘3PL’
There are two very interesting pronominal-like morphemes: ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘PL’. The two forms can be analysed into a root eka ‘3’ followed by one of two suffixes: -tse ‘DL’ and -na ‘PL’ (these two suffixes are most likely the same dual and plural suffixes -tse ‘DL’ and -na ‘PL’ found in 3rd person pronouns; see §15.1.2). These two forms are very commonly used. They first appear to function as independent pronouns referring to S/O arguments. However, as we will see, there are a number of differences.

Ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘PL’ are illustrated in (15.68) (with ekatse) and (15.69) (with ekana):

(15.68) a. Kunu=eke =ni

‘I took them (my three sisters-in-law, to see the deer that I had killed).’ sl072

628

Ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘PL’ share the following morpho-syntactic properties with independent nouns (but not bound pronouns): 1 — they do not have a rigid position in the clause as shown by (15.69a,b), (15.71b) and (15.74);

2 — they can co-occur with bound pronouns referring to the same referent as in (15.70) (S function) and (15.71) (O function) (note that (15.71a) is (T1.93)):

‘“I will go and pay a visit (lit. see) the Pacahuaras,” I thought (lit. thus were my thoughts), because I did not know them.’ pa016

However, there are at least two main differences between the forms ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘PL’ and independent pronouns, as follows: 1 — they can co-occur with (at least) S/O NPs. Examples showing ekatse and ekana cooccurring with S NPs are shown in (15.74):

2 — they never take phrasal particles (Chapter 17) (such as =dya ‘FOC’ in (15.9a), =piisi ‘ALONE’ in (15.49a), =piji ‘DIM’ and =kamadya ‘ONLY’ in (15.49b);
3 — they normally do not occur first in a clause ((15.69a) is a rare exception) whereas clause-first position is the preferred position for independent pronouns).
These observations suggests that ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘PL’ do not fill an NP slot (as independent pronouns do). Although these two morphemes are semantically associated with core arguments (S/O), they might function as adverbial/peripheral elements (such as independent particles; §16.1). However, the exact nature of these two morphemes will remain open at the present stage.
Note that ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘3PL’ are homophonous with the dual and plural number markers =ekatse ‘DL’ and =ekana ‘PL’ (§13.3). One could analyse as being not different. This is not a good analysis (at least in synchronic terms — it is quite likely

631 that they are historically related) for the following reasons: 1 — number markers only occur within an NP with a rigid position (slot G). Ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘3PL’ function at the clause level (not the NP level) with no rigid position; 2 — number marker cannot occur wihout an overtly expressed NP head. Ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘3PL’ can occur even though the referent they modify is not overtly expressed (as in all examples given above, except (15.74)). 3 — number marker =ekana modifies kinship term ‘possessed’ by a 1st or 2nd person. The morpheme ekana can potentially modify any types of entities. In (15.74c), for example, it modifies ‘dogs’).

15.7. Adverbial demonstratives Adverbial demonstratives refer to locations (unlike pronouns which refer to people, animals, plants or things).

Adverbial demonstratives consist of three sets (locative, general locative and perlative). The full list is given in Table 15.10:

Table 15.10: Adverbial demonstratives

PERL

near speaker re-wa / jee-ju re-keja re-eke

near addressee tu-wa tu-keja tu-eke

not near speaker or addressee yu-wa yu-keja yu-eke

15.7.1. Deictic function

There are four demonstratives roots which code three degrees of distance as shown in

(15.76):

(15.76) re- or jee- ‘here, near speaker’

tu-

‘there, near or familiar to addressee’

yu-

‘over there, not near or not familiar to speaker or addressee’

The ‘near’ demonstrative root re- (and jee in the case of locative demonstratives; see further below) is used to refer to places located near the speaker. Examples illustrating the ‘near’ adverbial demonstrative root re- are given in (15.77):

632

(15.77) a. Re-wa =renaS

ani-ya.

here-LOC =3PROX.PL sit-IMPFV

‘(When my companion and I reached the village of the Pacahuara peoplei, he me:) Here is where theyi live.’ pa029

b. Ina-ya=ama=dya

sasu=kwanaO.

grab-IMPFV=NEG=FOC =1PL

here-LOC.GNL trough.mortar=PL

‘We (Cavineña women) don’t use (lit. grab) trough mortars around here (community of Galilea) anymore.’ ci111

Quite interestingly, in addition to re-wa, there is another ‘near’ locative (but not general locative or perlative) demonstrative. The two form re-wa and jee-ju have (apparently — more work might reveal some differences) the same meaning. However, it was noted that re-wa is used more frequently than jee-ju in the available corpus.

Examples illustrating the two ‘near’ locative demonstratives in (nearly) similar contexts are given in (15.78):

(15.78) a. Je-kwe come-SG

re-wa! here-LOC

jee-ju, moto=ju!

2SG-FM sit-GO.DOWN-IMP.SG here-LOC motocycle=LOC

‘Sit down here, on the motocycle!’ me047

The ‘mid’ demonstrative root tu- ‘there’ is used to refer to places located away from the speaker and close to the addressee, or not close to the addressee but very familiar to both addressee and speaker. In (15.79), tu-wa refers to a location close to the addressee. This example is from the beginning of a recorded conversation at Ventura Mayo’s house. When I arrived (with the tape recorder recording), Ventura greeted me and invited me to sit, indicating a bench (located near me):

633

(15.79) Bandia

Tu-wa=dya =tuS eperereS. there-LOC=FOC =3 bench
‘Good morning Sir! Come in! Have a seat! There is a bench there.’ ci003

In (15.80), tu-wa refers to a place not close to either speaker of addressee (at the time of speech) but familiar to the addressee (i.e., the addressee has already heard about Alto Ivón and knows where it is):

(15.80)

‘(One day the missionary sent me to the Chácobo village. He said to me:) “Go to Alto Ivón. Go there and meet (lit. see) the Chácobo people!”’ pa002

In (15.81), tu-eke refers to a place located away from both speaker and addressee but very close (and visible) to both of them:

(15.81)

Aijama!

Tu-eke=dya =tuS

‘(I wanted the big woman to get down from the motocycle I was driving so that we would cross that tiny bridge on foot but she refused and said:) no! All the motocycles cross (lit. pass) here (on that bridge, so don’t worry)!’ mo019

The ‘far’ demonstrative root yu- ‘over there’ is used to refer to places located away from both addressee and speaker and unfamiliar to either speaker or addressee or both.
In (15.82), yu-wa refers to a place which is far away from speaker and addressee, and

634 unfamiliar to the addressees (but familiar to the speakers):

(15.82)

Iye-wa =tuja

‘(When we arrived at the village, back from a fishing expedition, my companions said to everybody, talking of me:) He has killed a caymani. He threw iti away over there (on our way back here).’ lg046

The examples in (15.83) come from a recorded conversation between Cavineña men (doing community work) and me. The main topic of the conversation is me and my far away and unknown (perhaps unheard of) country (France). The following examples are a sample of the questions that I was asked about France, to which they consistently refer with the ‘far’ demonstrative yu-keja:

635 of (lit. many) money there, isn’t it?’ tb206

15.7.2. Case distinctions Adverbial demonstratives fill the slot of three different types of postpositional phrases: (1) locative (§14.4), (2) general locative (§14.5) and (3) perlative (§14.6).

General locative and perlative case suffixes (-keja ‘LOC.GNL’ and -eke ‘PERL’) are identical to general locative and perlative postpositions (=keja ‘LOC.GNL’ and =eke ‘PERL’ respectively). On the other hand, the locative suffix -wa ‘LOC’ which occurs on three of the roots is different from the locative postposition =ju. But note that the locative postposition =ju is identical to the suffix -ju taken by the ‘near’ demonstrative jee.

In (15.84), we illustrate the ‘mid’ demonstrative tu- in each of the three functions. In each case, there is a nearby (in a preceding or same sentence) full postpositional phrase in the same function:

(15.84) a. … kwa-kware ikeS go-REM.PAST 1SG

636 Riberalta=eke. kilometer=APPROX ‘From here, it (the Cavineña community of Santa Ana) is about 25 km, from (here in) Riberalta.’ pa001
15.7.3. Anaphora Adverbial demonstratives always have an anaphoric (but apparently not cataphoric) function. In other words, adverbial demonstratives are only used when the location is clearly identifiable from the context (and does not require — but can receive — a pointing gesture). Typically, the place referred to has been mentioned in the preceding text. This can be clearly seen in (15.80) and (15.84a,b) where the places referred to by the demonstratives are expressed by full postpositional phrases in a preceding sentence. In (15.81), the addressee (taxi-driver) knows the place referred to by the ‘mid’ demonstrative tu-eke because he has mentioned this place (i.e., the bridge) himself to the addressee (the big woman) when he asked her to get down from the motorcycle. In (15.82), the villagers can identify the place referred to by the ‘far’ demonstrative yu-wa because they already know where the speaker and his companions have been fishing.
The ‘near’ demonstratives, at least, can be used without previous mention of the place it refers to. This can be seen in (15.78a,b) and (15.77a,b) (where the ‘near’ demonstratives refer to the location of the speaker).
15.8. Pointing demonstratives Pointing demonstratives are used to draw the attention to a new location (not people, animals, plants or things). Unlike adverbial demonstratives, pointing demonstratives cannot be used anaphorically. In most cases, they are accompanied a pointing gesture (either finger- or lip-pointing).
15.8.1. Deictic function There are four pointing demonstratives which (similarly to adverbial demonstratives) distinguish three degrees of distance. They are given in (15.85):

(15.85)

riya4 or jee tume yume

637 ‘here, near speaker’ ‘there, near or familiar to addressee’ ‘over there, not near or not familiar to speaker or addressee’

Note that pointing demonstratives are clearly related to adverbial demonstratives. They are based on the same set of roots: ri- and jee ‘near’, tu- ‘mid’ and yu- ‘far’. These roots have exactly the same meaning in adverbial demonstratives and pointing demonstratives. In addition to the roots, pointing demonstratives are incremented by irregular formatives: -ya with ri-, -Ø with jee and -me with tu- and yu-. The origin of these formatives is unknown. They do not correspond to any recognisable postposition. In this study, they are not treated as independent suffixes but as parts of unitary roots.

The three distance distinctions (‘near’ vs. ‘mid’ vs. ‘far’) that distinguish the pointing demonstratives are illustrated below.

The ‘near’ pointing demonstratives riya and jee are synonymous (similarly to the adverbial demonstratives re-wa ‘here-LOC’ and jee-ju ‘here-LOC’; see (15.78)). They are used while pointing to a place located near the speaker, as shown in (15.86) (note that in a., the speaker is also the addressee as he is talking to himself):

(15.86) a. Riya=dya here=FOC

[e-kwe eskupeta]CC. 1SG-GEN rifle

‘(I was very scared of the anteater but I said to myself:) Here (in my hands) is my rifle (so don’t be afraid!).’ ba115

b. Jee=dya here=FOC

[Antoni=ja tujuri]CC. Antoni=GEN mosquito.net

‘Here (on photo that we are looking at) is Antoni’s mosquito net.’ ft018

In a Cavineña village, when arriving at a house, looking for someone, one typically asks are ‘QUEST’ (§16.2.2) and the name of the person looked for, to which the person looked for responds riya ‘here’. This was recorded when Antonio Yubanera (A) and I
4 Note that this form is homophonous with (and likely related to) the root of 3PROX singular independent (but not bound pronouns) (see 15.1.2).

638 arrived at Ventura Mayo (V)’s house once. They said (15.87):

(15.87) A: Are
QUEST

Hermano? brother

‘Hello, Brother? Are you there? Where are you?’ ci001

V: Riya here

Hermano! brother

‘Hello Brother, I’m here!’ ci002

(See also jee=dya mikwana=ja misionero ‘here is your missionary’ in (T1.56) and jee=dya =mike =Ø isara-ya ‘here I am talking to (lit. greeting) you’ in (T1.73).)

The ‘mid’ pointing demonstrative tume is used while pointing to a place which is located away from the speaker, close to the addressee or not close to the addressee but visible/easily identifiable. In (15.88), a group of Cavineños are ambushing their enemies. Someone spots the enemies coming and informs his companions:

(15.88)

Abakata ne-ju-kwe!

Tumi=dya ekanaS jeti-ya.

quiet IMP.NSG-be-IMP.NSG there=FOC 3PL come-IMPFV

‘Be quiet! There they come!’ mk065

The ‘far’ pointing demonstrative yume is used while pointing to a place which is located away from both speaker and addressee and non-visible/difficult to identify. One night in Misión Cavinas, Alfredo and I were woken up by a porcupine that had entered our house. Alfredo went to Lucio Tavo, our closest neighbour, to ask him to come with his rifle and kill the animal. Alfredo said to Lucio (15.89):

(15.89)

IjaO

iye-na-kwe!

Yume

ju-ani-ya.

porcupine kill-COME.TEMP-IMP.SG over.there be-SIT-IMPFV

‘Come to kill a porcupine! Over there, it is sitting (on a beam in our house).’ ij016

In Misión Cavinas, Rosmeri Tavo used to cook for both Alfredo Tavo and me. One day,

639 Alfredo had been away the whole morning. Rosmeri came to ask me if he would be back for lunch (i.e., if she had to cook for him too). I did not know so we waited for Alfredo. Suddenly, Rosmeri saw Alfredo in the distance, pointed to him, and said to me:

(15.90)

Yumi=dya

jeti-ya.

over.there=FOC come-IMPFV

‘Over there, he is coming.’ n5.0152

15.8.2. Morpho-syntactic properties
Pointing demonstratives have the following morpho-syntactic properties: — pointing demonstratives are peripheral (not core) elements but do not fill any specific postpositional slots (unlike adverbial demonstratives which fill locative, general locative and perlative PP slots), even though they can only refer to locations (and are translated by the English adverbial demonstratives ‘here’, ‘there’ and ‘over there’); — pointing demonstratives are only used in main (rarely subordinate) clauses; — pointing demonstratives normally come first in the clause (as in all preceding examples). Example (15.91) is a rare exception, with the ‘mid’ pointing demonstrative tume used in a non-first position:

(15.91)

[Ejebucha iye-e]

=ri-keO

=ØA

tume a-ya?

MAN.INT kill-MAN.INT =3PROX.SG-FM (=1SG-ERG)there affect-IMPFV

‘How am I going to kill it (a giant anteater, hidden inside tremedously thick vegetation)?’ ba058

— pointing demonstratives are very often (but not obligatorily; see (15.89) and (15.91)) marked with the phrasal particle =dya (§17.4) (as in (15.86a,b) and (15.88)). Interestingly, =dya causes a non-predicatable phonological change e -> i on the last e vowel of tume (becoming tumi=dya; as in (15.88)) and yume (becoming yumi=dya; as in (15.90)) (but does not trigger any changes with riya and jee; as in (15.86a,b)).

15.8.3. Additional functions
Pointing demonstratives tume and yume (but not jee and riya) are very often used when there is the 2nd position particle =tukwe ‘COUNT.EVID’ (§16.3.3), as in (15.92):

640

(15.92) a. Tume =tukwe

ani-kware [bina [ikeO susu-ti-ya=ke]]S.

there =COUNT.EVID sit-REM.PAST bat 1SG suck-GO.TEMP-IMPFV=LIG

‘(When I went sleeping, I didn’t know that) there was a (vampire) bat that was going to suck me (during my sleep).’ bi016

b. Yume =tukwe

amena e-riri=dyaCC ju-kware

over.there =COUNT.EVID FILL RES-rot=FOC be-REM.PAST

emake=eke pero dyake=eke paji-da=dyaCC ju-kware. UNDER=PERL but ON=PERL hard-ASF=FOC be-REM.PAST
‘It happened that the bridge was rotten underneath. But on top, it was hard. (So I crossed and of course the bridge broke.)’ wa071b

It is not clear what the exact function is of tume and yume in this context and why tume is used in a., while yume is used in b.

There a very interesting (but not fully understood) use of riya ‘here’ and tume ‘there’ (but not jee ‘hear’ or yume ‘over there’) in copula clauses with an NP as CC, as follows: — the construction only consists of the CC (an NP) followed (never preceded) by riya (as in (15.93)) or tume (as in (15.94)).

In (15.93), Griselda Cartagena and her family are taken back to their community, Bolivar, in the light plane of the missionaries. They have gotten lost in a storm. They spot a village that they think is Bolivar. But when they get closer, the pilot says:

(15.93)

Bolivar=amaCC

riya!

Bolivar.village=NEG here

‘(Hold on,) this is not Bolivar!’ av019

The conversation turn in (15.94) was volunteered by Francisco Vaca:

(15.94) A: Ai=jaCC=keCC =riCS

anteojoCS?

INT=DAT=LIG =3PROX.SG(-FM) glasses

‘Whose glasses are these?’

641 B: E-kwiCC=keCC tumeCS!
1SG-DAT=LIG there
‘Those are mine!’ n1.0170

— the construction appears to never overtly code the CS (i.e., there are no CS bound or independent pronoun or NP); — riya and tume in the construction can refer to a place (as in (15.93)) but also to a thing (as in (15.94)) or even to people as in (15.95).

In (15.95), during the Chaco war against Paraguay (1932-1935), Cipriano and (his younger brother) Victor Tavo, were supposed to fight in the Bolivian army. However, they escaped and went to the town of Trinidad to ask for the Bishop’s protection. The Bishop (B) knew Cipriano (C) but not Victor. When they arrived, he asked Cipriano:

(15.95) B: Riya5 =riCS

eje=keCC? [Mi-kwe jau]CC?

here =3PROX.SG(-FM) INT=LIG 2SG.GEN younger.brother

‘Who is this? Your younger brother?’

C: Jejee, [ekwe e-jau]CC

tume.

yes 1SG.GEN 1-younger-brother there

‘Yes, that’s my younger brother.’

B: Eje=keCC INT=LIG

riya? VituCC here Victor

riya? here

‘Which (of your younger brothers) is this? Is this Victor?’

V: VituCC tume. Victor there
‘(Yes,) that’s Victor.’ gu031-033

5 This riya is a regular pointing demonstrative and not part of the construction discussed here. This is because — although it is found in a copula clause with a NP as CC — (1) riya comes first in the clause and (2) there is a bound pronoun.

642
— riya and tume are always anaphoric;
One wonders if in this construction, riya and tume are not special bound pronouns referring to the CS, that would come in addition to the two series of distance-neutral S/CS pronouns (i.e., tu-ke, ta-tse and tu-na) and proximal S/CS pronoun (i.e., ri-ke, retse and re-na). More work is required to clarify this issue.
Finally, the pointing demonstratives riya and yume (but not tume and jee) are homophonous with (and possibly historically related to) two auxiliary-taking markers used in slot B of the predicate: riya ‘STARTLING’ (§10.2.3) and yume ‘IMMEDIATELY’ (§10.2.2).

15.8.4. Nominal demonstrative strategies
We have said that Cavineña does not have specific demonstratives functioning within NPs. This is remedied by two strategies. The first strategy consists in using a pointing demonstrative (which is a peripheral element) within a copula relative clause in slot A (somehow like English ‘the man who is here/there’) (see jee=ke ‘this’ in (15.12c), tume=ke ‘that’ in (15.3a), riya=ke ‘this’ in (15.96a) and yume=ke in (15.96b):

(15.96) a. [RiyaCC=ke upatiwiri=ja] =tuS

ani-nuka-ya=dya kwatsabijiS.

here=LIG small.bird=DAT =3SG(-FM) sit-REITR-IMPFV=FOC story

‘This little bird (the Sun bird I am talking about) has a story too (it used to be a servant of the sun).’ hi006

b. [YumeCC=ke jipamu]CS ji-u=pijiCC. over.there=LIG papaya good-ASF=DIM ‘That papaya (tree) over there (that we see from the distance) is nice.’ n5.0466
Demonstrative (copula) RCs are discussed at length in §13.6.2.
The second option is to use a pointing demonstrative in apposition to an NP (without any further marking), as in (15.97)

643 (15.97) a. … kakemiti-nuka-ya [[tume] [peya ekwita]=tsewe].
marry-REITR-IMPFV there other person=ASSOC
‘… she is getting re-married, with that other person there.’ mu036

b. Ai=dyaCC =di

=tuCS

[[yume] ekwita]CS?

INT=FOC =STRG.EMPH =3SG(-FM) over.there person

‘Who the heck is that man over there?’ hm189

(See another example with tume in (T1.78).)

Note that when the pointing demonstrative occurs first in the clause, and is followed by an NP, and there are no 2P clitics (to show the end of the first immedicate constituent of the clause) it is not possible to decide wheter the demonstrative is apposed or not, as in (15.98):

(15.98) a. Jee ebakwapiji=raA ina-ya [make wiri=kwana e-tutsu=ke]O…

here boy=ERG

grab-IMPFV piraña tiny=PL RES-sew=LIG

c. Ne-diru-kwe!

Tume avion je-ya.

IMP.NSG-go-IMP.NSG there plane come-IMPFV

‘Go! There the plane is coming.’ ri065

15.8.5. Conjunction
The pointing demonstrative tume is very often used as a sentential conjunction meaning ‘then’, as in (15.99a) (note that this is (T2.3)), ‘so’, as in (15.99b) (note that this is (T1.117)), or ‘but’, as in (15.99c):

16 Particles — independent, first position and second position particles
Particles are mono-morphemic grammatical words uninflected for any grammatical categories. There are four different types of particles. They essentially differ in their degree of phonological and structural independence, as follows: 1 — independent particles (§16.1) have the highest degree of freedom. They form independent phonological words which can occur anywhere in any type of clauses. 2 — first position particles (§16.2) also form independent phonological words but have distributional restriction. They can only occur in main clauses and have to occur in first position. 3 — second position particles (§16.3) do not form independent phonological words. They are enclitics to the last phonological word of the first immediate constituent of a main clause only (NP, PP, predicate, independent or first position particle, adverbial clause, etc.). 4 — phrasal particles (these are discussed in Chapter 17) do not form independent phonological words either. They are enclitics to the last phonological word of an immediate constituent (NP, PP, predicate, independent or first position particle, adverbial clause, etc.) of any type of clauses.
16.1. Independent particles 16.1.1. Introduction Independent particles are independent phonological words, which do not have any order restrictions (they behave like any clausal constituent in this respect). Unlike first and second position particles (but similarly to phrasal particles), independent particles can occur in any types of clauses (main clauses as well as adverbial clauses).
The following tables list all attested independent particles found in the data, sorted

646 by semantics fields: sentence linkage (Table 16.1), aspect/manner (Table 16.2), time (Table 16.3), time of day (Table 16.4) and direction/location (Table 16.5).

Only two independent particles have been investigated in some depth in this study: amena ‘FILL’ (§16.1.3) and datse ‘FRUST’ (§16.1.2). The other particles will require more work.

16.1.2. datse ‘FRUST’
The particle datse ‘FRUSTrative’ (the term ‘inconsequential’ is sometimes used in the literature for a similar category; see for example Haiman 1988: 531) means that an action is performed ‘in vain’, ‘without the expected results/consequences’. Datse is found both as an independent particle and as a second position particle.

We illustrate datse in various positions in the clause in (16.1) (note that (16.1b) is (T1.23)) :

(16.1) a. Datse=dya =ØA

iwa-chine.

Aijama=dya.

FRUST=FOC (=1SG-ERG) wait.for-REC.PAST not.exist.at.all=FOC

1 Haiman describes a very similar catetory in Hua (Papuan) as follows: “the action is actually performed, but the action did not lead to the desired or expected result, whaterver this is supposed to be”.

(See also ‘we (Cavineñas) do get upset (among us) (but we never attempt to kill each other as you Araonas do)’ at (T1.62)

In (16.2), we examplify datse within an adverbial SS-temporal clause:

(16.2)

Tudya i-keS [datse then 1SG-FM FRUST

iwa-tsu] … kwa-kware amena

‘Having waited for her (but she was not coming back), I went to meet my daughter.’ mt004

Datse also functions as a second position particle (with no meaning differences), as illustrated in (16.3):

(16.3) a. Ji-da =datse =tunaA

bajeje-wa

good-ASF =FRUST =3PL(-ERG) prepare-PERF

‘They cooked (lit. prepared) it (the cayman I had killed) very well (but I didn’t eat it; it was still too stinky for me).’ lg050

‘This way it (the community of Misión Cavinas) is not far (but with the flooded path and the oxen that go very slow, it will still take us a lot of time to get there.)’ ka257

16.1.3. amena ‘FILL’ The independent particle amena ‘FILLer’ has a general meaning of completion. This particle is used extremely frequently by some speakers (see discussion fruther below). It has essentially a discourse function of separating information provided between two sentences or two sentence constituents (in this latter case, amena can be used more than once in a sentence). In Spanish, amena is often translated as ahora ‘now’ or ya ‘now, already’.
In (16.4), we show amena as a separator of sentences. It basically codes the fact that an event does not overlap with preceding or following propositions.
(16.4) a. Amena i-keS aje-ya. FILL 1SG-FM walk-IMPFV ‘Now (that the bad stretch of path is finished) I’m going to walk (rather than sit in the cart).’ ka454

‘(The capuchin monkey was lying half dead. But when I grabbed its leg,) then, it suddenly sat up!’ aj022

650 (See also ‘the man (who was very upset) (finally) turned better’ in (T1.78)

Amena can be used in CC function with the meaning ‘be ready’ as in (16.5):

(16.5)

I-keCS amenaCC ju-wa.

1SG-FM FILL

be-PERF

‘I’m ready (we can go).’ n4.0033

Amena is often used between sentences, not counting as 1st clausal constituent for the purpose of 2nd position clitic placement, as with its first instance in (16.6):

(16.6)

Amena tuekedya =tuS

chamakama e-pereS a-tana-ya

FILL then

=3SG(-FM) finally

NPF-side affect-PASS-IMPFV

amena.
FILL
‘And then finally the side (of the canoe) is made.’ ab179

Note that in this example both instances of amena reinforce the independent particle chamakama ‘finally’. (Other examples are at (16.7b), (T1.17), (T1.26) and (T1.104).)

Some speakers sometimes insert amena between nearly all constituents of a sentence as in (16.7):

(16.7) a. Amena [tu-keS ukena-wa=ju]

amena isha-ya amena.

FILL 3SG-FM become.hot-PERF=DS FILL put.in-IMPFV FILL

‘Once it (water) is hot, they (our Cavineña grandmothers) would pour it (grounded corn) (in the hot water, in order to prepare corn beer).’ ci086

‘(The first time we tried to cross the Biata river with our handmade canoe, we almost all drowned. This time however,) we crossed with a canoe and it

651 was alright (lit. good).’ ri021
The function of repeating amena between clausal constituents is not altogether clear. It is possibly used for clarity as a way to overtly marker the clausal constituents boundaries.
Amena can be used extremely frequently, depending on speakers. Some speakers like Alfredo Tavo tend to use amena rather sparingly. (He disapproved once of the tendency of some speakers to overuse that particle.) In T1, for example he only uses amena in 6% of the sentences (9 instances of amena out of 153 sentences). Gregorio Yubanera, on the other hand, uses in 40% of sentences in T2 (6 instances of amena out of 15 sentences). More work is needed to determine whether any correlations can be made between the use of amena and sociolinguistic parameters such as age, sex, etc.

16.2. First position particles
16.2.1. Introduction
First position particles, similarly to the independent particles, form one grammatical and one phonological word. However, they differ in that first position particles must occur as the first constituent of a main clause. First position particles do not occur in adverbial clauses.

Table 16.6 lists all first position particles attested in the data. The right column cross-refrences corresponding sections.

§16.2.2 §16.2.3 §16.2.4 §16.2.5 §16.2.6 §16.2.7

652 16.2.2. are ‘QUEST’ The 1st position particle are ‘QUESTion’ makes explicit that a clause is a (normally polar) question (as opposed to a statement). (Let us recall that there is no specific intonation for questions in Cavineña.)

In (16.8), Elio Tavo has been attacked by an anaconda snake. When he returns to his community, limping and feeling terribly bad, one of the school teachers sees him and asks him:

(16.8)

Ai=raA =miO

INT=ERG =2SG(-FM) bite-PERF

Are =miO

bakwa=raA a-wa=ama?

‘What did bite you? Isn’t that a viper that bit you?’ mp069

At the end of a meal, the way the host asks the guest if he wants more food is by saying (16.9):

(16.9)

Are =bakwe =miA

biji-dama ba-nuka-ya?

QUEST =CONTR =2SG(-ERG) nice-NEG see-REITR-IMPFV

‘Do you you want more (food)? (lit. do you see food not nice again?) n4.0533

Are is also used in clauses which inquire about information but do not make use of a question word, most often because the type of information requested is obvious from the context, as in (16.10) (questioning time) and (16.11) (questioning a location):

(16.10)

Are uraCS mikwana-ja? [Ai ura]?

QUEST hour 2PL-GEN

INT hour

‘Could you (pl) give me the time? What time is it?’ ka203

In a Cavineña village, when arriving at someone’s house, looking for someone, one says are and his name (or some the term by which the person can be identified) to which the

653 person looked for responds riya ‘here’. This was recorded when Antonio Yubanera (A) and I arrived at Ventura Mayo (V)’s house once. They exchanged (16.11):

(16.11) A: Are
QUEST

Hermano? brother

‘Hello, Brother? Are you there? Where are you?’ ci001

V: Riya here

Hermano! brother

‘Hello Brother, I’m here!’ ci002

16.2.3. ita ‘ATT.GETTER’ The 1st position particle ita ‘ATTention.GETTER’ is only used with command clauses, either imperative or hortative. It is used to politely make an unexpected command/request, to make a request that shifts the topic of discussion, to draw the attention of the hearer because he has requested something.

In (16.12), in the middle of the night, Alfredo Tavo and I are woked up by a strange noise inside the house where we are sleeping. Alfredo gets up and searches for it. When he finds out that it is a porcupine. He calls me:

(16.12)

Ita

ATT.GETTER here=LIG beast see-COME.TEMP-IMP.SG

‘Come and see that beast!’ ij012

In (16.13), Antonio Yubanera and I have come to Teresa Rutani’s house to record old traditions and practices. Antonio first discusses with Ventura Mayo (Teresa’s husband) about Ventura’s bad health. Then when Antonio turns to Teresa and says:

(16.13)

‘I’m wondering if you could chat with us (no more than) a little bit, Sister (as requested by the linguist).’ ci029

In (16.14), the jaguar (J) wonders what the fox (F) is eating. The fox explains that he is eating motacu nuts. He then says (16.14F) (imperative) and the jaguar replies (16.14J) (1st person hortative):

(16.14) F: Ita

ATT.GETTER =EMPH try-IMP.SG

‘But try it (yourself)!’ zo010

‘Alright, I will try it then!’ zo011

In (16.15), Alfredo Tavo finds himself in Alto Ivón, the community where the Chácobo people live. Nearby live Pacahuara people. He is very curious about these indigenous people he has never met before so he says to himself (singular hortative):

(16.15)

Pakawara=kwanaO!

ATT.GETTER HORT.SG-see-GO.TEMP Pacahuara.person=PL

‘I will go and pay a visit (lit. see) the Pacahuaras!’ pa016

16.2.4. deka ‘POTENTIALLY’ The 1st position particle deka ‘POTentially’ indicates that the proposition could hold providing a condition is realised. It only occurs in main clauses with a predicate inflected with the semantically similar potential circumfix e-…-u ‘POT’ (see §6.1.5). The function of deka appears to reinforce the potential reading of a clause with a predicate already marked with e-…-u.

One night in Galilea, someone had stolen a number of ducks. Elio Tavo came to the health post, where I was sleeping, to inform me. Later, when Elio recounted (and recorded) the story, he says that he had said to me (16.17):

16.2.5. masa ‘SEEMINGLY’
We have very few examples of the particle masa ‘SEEMINGLY’ and the following discussion is only tentative. Speakers appear to use masa when comparing similar propositions, to say that a proposition is similar to another proposition.

(16.18) a Masa=dya

=di

[e-kwe kuchiru]CC jeeCC=keCS.

SEEMINGLY=FOC =STRG.EMPH 1SG-GEN machete here=LIG

=STRG.EMPH kuyukuyu.fish

‘(We, in the village, were wondering what animal the new professor looked like, in order to give him a nickname. I said:) He looks like a kuyukuyu! (So we named him “kuyukuyu”!)’ ap038

c. Masa=dya

[nei mara=jari]CC.

SEEMINGLY=FOC =STRG.EMPH rain time=STILL

‘(How come there is still so much water on the paths!) It is as if it was still the rainy season.’ ka292

Interestingly, masa is found as a second position clitic in questions:

(16.19)

EjebuchaCC =masa

chapa=kwanaCS [i-keS maju-wa=ju] e-ju-u?

INT:SIMLR =SEEMINGLY dog=PL

1SG-FM die-PERF=DS POT-be-POT

‘What could my dogs do if I had died?’ wa079

Note that masa is only found in copula clauses. Note also that when masa is a 1st position particle (as in (16.18) above), it always occurs with the phrasal particle =dya followed by the 2P particle =di.

16.2.6. jipakwana ‘SEEMINGLY.NOT’ Three examples are available of a 1st position particle jipa ‘SEEMINGLY.NOT’ that is possibly the negated version of the masa ‘SEEMINGLY’, meaning that the proposition is likely not to occur.
Example (16.20) is from a recorded conversation between Cavineña men doing community work. They were trying to have me buy them a new (but very expensive) radio transmitor. As I wasn’t giving any signs I would buy it, Vidal Mayo (the president of the community) said:

657 (16.20) Jipakwana =ekwana-ja radioS ani-ya.
SEEMINGLY.NOT =1PL-DAT radio sit-IMPFV
‘It sounds like we won’t have that radio.’ tb088

16.2.7. jipake ‘LUCKILY’ Two examples are available of a 1st position particle jipake ‘LUCKILY’, shown in (16.21):

(16.21) a. Jipake =taa [peya kistiano=kwana]CS japa-damaCC ju-chine.

LUCKILY =EMPH other people=PL

16.3. Second position particles
16.3.1. Introduction
Second position particles form independent grammatical words but not independent phonological words. Together with bound pronouns (§15.2), second position particles are enclitics to the last phonological word of the first immediate constitutent of a main clause. Second position particles do not occur in adverbial clauses.

Table 16.7 lists all second position particles attested in the data, provisionally sorted by semantic fields. The right column cross-references corresponding sections.

658 §16.3.4 §16.3.5 §16.3.7 §16.3.8 §16.3.6 §16.3.9 §16.1.2

Note that the second position is also the locus of bound pronouns. When a (main) clause has both second position particles and bound pronouns, bound pronouns always come last in the chain (see for example (16.25), (16.31), (16.50), etc.). Several second position particles can also co-occur (3 co-occurring second position particles being the maximum attested). When this happens, there are also ordering restrictions. This is the topic of §16.3.10 below.

Second position particles (followed by bound pronouns) can also form a clitic chain with phrasal particles. This happens when a constituent marked by phrasal particles occurs first in a main clause. In this situation, second position particles follow the phrasal particles (see for example (16.24), (16.25), (16.26), etc.).

In this study, for clarity, second position particles (but not phrasal particles) are separated from their host (and from each other when two or more second position particles co-occur) by a space. This helps the reader immediately distinguish second position particles from phrasal particles. This also helps visualising where the first clausal constituent ends.

16.3.2. =ni ‘MAYBE’ The 2P particle =ni ‘MAYBE’ is used when the speaker is not fully certain of what he says. It translates in English as ‘maybe V, probably V, I think that V, I guess that V’.
In (16.22), the speaker is guessing what his dogs’ thoughts were once he fell into a ditch:

659

In (16.23), a tricky fox wants to have sex with the jaguar’s (three) wives. One wife asks him where he wants to sleep. He refuses to answer (that he wants to sleep on top of her) so she tries to guess:

In (16.24), Teresa Rutani (an elderly woman) relates her childhood. At some point she was sent with her brother to work in a faraway farm. She cannot remember exaclty how old she was so she says:

In (16.25), Roberto Amapo is trying to prepare a soft drink, mixing (what he thinks is) the drink powder with water. In reality the powder he is using is leaven so the drink does not turn red as normally expected. Roberto wonders why and (wrongly) guesses:

In one text Alfredo Tavo relates his only visit to the Pacahuara people in 1990. He had been very surprised to see that at that time the Pacahuaras had still kept many of their traditions (like smoking fish and wearing bird feathers through the nose, etc). But at the end of the story, Alfredo (who had not heard about the Pacahuaras since) wonders how they could be in 2000, when this text was recorded. He says (16.26):

(16.26)

Jadi=dya=jariCC =ni

ekanaCS.

thus=FOC=STILL =MAYBE 3PL

‘They might still be like that (like the way I saw them).’ pa107

Other examples are ‘we might kill each other’ at (T1.8), ‘perhaps he was scared’ at (T1.27), ‘the tractors might still be there’ at (T1.117):
The particle =ni is possibly historically related to the negator ni= ‘NOT.EVEN’ (§17.11) which is itself a likely borrowing form Spanish ni ‘not even’ (see an example in (16.36) below).

16.3.3. =tukwe ‘COUNT.EVID’ The second position particle =tukwe ‘COUNTrary to EVIDence’ is a very interesting morpheme. It codes the fact that a proposition is true against the evidence.

In (16.27), Eli Mayo relates how he killed his first deer with a rifle when he was 13. The deer was very heavy so he went back home to ask for help. But nobody wanted to believe him because it was the first time he had used a rifle. Eventually, they went and saw the deer. His sister-in-law said:

In (16.28), Lucas Tavo relates how once he had his blood sucked by a vampire bat during his sleep without him noticing anything. He only found out when he woke up. When he realises what had happened to him he said:

In (16.29), Francisco Vaca relates how he fell from a mango tree when he was a young boy. He wanted to grab a beautiful mango fruit on top of the tree. After climbing, he managed to grab it but:

In (16.30), the Ese Ejja people have killed a Cavineña woman near her village. They make a lot of noise celebrating their killing. They are heard by the (Cavineña) villagers. The Cavineñas realise that the noise comes from their enemies but they cannot figure out what has happened. The narrator comments:

See also ‘but in reality they were very upset’ in (T1.6), ‘it was rheumatism’ in (T1.105).

The usage of =tukwe with future events is quite interesting. This happens for (either negative or positive) presentiments.

In (16.31) the brother of a woman has disappeared. When she feels her right arm palpitating, she says:

In (16.22) Alfredo Tavo relates a long journey when he did not have water. At some point in the story he says, he is desperate to find any water or anybody to help him and says:

16.3.4. =pa ‘REP’
The 2P particle =pa ‘REPortative’ is used when the speaker has heard the information from someone else. It is the only category in Cavineña that specifies the source of knowledge one has of a particular proposition.
It is not altogether clear how obligatory the use of the reportative particle is and whether we can really talk about an ‘evidential system’. In some reported stories, =pa occurs on every sentence (as in T2 for example). In some others, it is only sparingly used once in a while. Yet in some other stories (which have supposedly been heard), it is not used at all. It is possible that there are some variations between speakers. T2 for example is from a very old (over 80 years old) speaker which suggests that old speakers use the reportative particle more consistently. More work is required to clarify this

663 issue.

The reportative particle is normally used when relating traditional stories as with (16.33) (this is (T2.7)):

(16.33)

Tuekedya =pa =tuS

arina-aje-kware

dii=kwanaS

then

‘Then, the mosquitoes are reported to have been getting bigger and bigger (until they reached the size of a bird).’ mm007

In (16.34), Cosme Mayo relates the traditional belief that the parents of a newborn baby should not eat monkey lest their baby would die.

‘It is said that my child could die, if I did thus (i.e. eating the monkey that I had killed the day my wife was giving birth).’ aj058

In (16.35), Antonio Yubanera relates an old practice of forcing children to bathe before dawn.

(16.35)

katsa-kware. beat-REM.PAST
‘It is said that when they (our ancestor’s children) refused to bathe, they (our ancestors) would beat them.’ bn012

The reportative particle is also used just to report information without mentioning someone specifically.
In (16.36), Victoria Tavo and her daughter have arrived at the community of Baqueti to fetch me with their ox-cart. They are asking around for some food to take with us on the

664 trip. When I ask her if they have found anything Victoria says:

(16.36)

AijamaCC

ni=e-rami]CS.

not.exist.at.all =REP 3PL-DAT NOT.EVEN=fish EVEN.NOT=NPF-flesh

‘They say that they really don’t have any fish or any meat.’ ka162

The reportative particle is also used to repeat information from someone who is clearly identified as in (16.37):

(16.37)

Runeshi =pa =ekwanaO gringa=raA

iya-mere-ya

Monday =REP =1PL

foreign.lady=ERG put-CAUS-IMPFV

avion=eke. plane=PERL
‘The lady said that she will have someone (pilot) taking us (back to our community) by plane on Monday.’ ri059

The ‘source’ person can still be present in the speech situation. Example (16.38) comes from a recorded conversation between Cavineña men doing community work. At some point, they ask me questions about the tape recorder (How much does it cost? Where did I buy it? If I could give it to them? etc.) and then comment on my answers between themselves. Vidal Mayo hasn’t heard the price and asks for it from his workmates. Carmelo Camaconi responds:

(16.38)

Tsuje-ari-daCC =pa =riCS

jeeCC=keCS.

price-big-ASF =REP =3PROX.SG(-FM) here=LIG

‘He said that this (tape recorder) is very expensive (lit. high-priced).’ tb053

The reportative particle can be used with a 1st person subject. In (16.39), Francisco Vaca relates how, as a young boy, he fell from a mango tree (see earlier example (16.29)). After the fall, he was lying unconscious on the ground, but still holding the mango fruit firmly. He tells us that according to what people told him later:

(16.39)

Ina-jaka-ya=ama

=pa e-raA

mangaO.

grab-STOP-IMPFV=NEG =REP 1SG-ERG mango

665 ‘They said that I didn’t want to let go of the mango.’ mg028

In (16.40) a tricky fox wants to have sex with the jaguar’s (three) wifes (see earlier example (16.23)). To convince them, he lies saying that this is what their (jaguar) husband wants:

(16.40)

Mikwana-tsewe =pa i-keS tawi-ya

2PL-ASSOC

=REP 1SG-FM sleep-IMPFV

‘I am going to sleep with you (pl) (your husband said).’ zo073

The reportative particle can be used with command clauses: imperative in (16.41a), hortative in (16.41b) and jussive in (16.41c):

(16.41) a. Jeti-kwe =pa! come-IMP.SG =REP

Ba-diru-kwe

=pa!

see-GO.PERM-IMP.SG =REP

‘(My son came to tell me that the foreigner who had arrived in the plane was looking for me. My son said: Daddy,) come over, he says! Go see him, he says!’ me012

b. Waja-daCC =pa pa-ju! sweet-ASF =REP JUSS-be

Ne-ba-ti

=pa!

HORT.DL-see-GO.TEMP =REP

‘Change your shirt and pants. Let’s (dl) go to see him, he says!’ me182

The reportative particle can also be used with content questions to obtain some information that has been given by a non-speech act participant. (We have no examples with polar question but there is no reason why this should not be allowed.)

666

Following the command in (16.41a) by the son to his father, the father replies by (16.42) which is a question about the motives of the foreigner:

(16.42)

A=ishu

=pa?

do.what=PURP.GNL =REP

‘What for (did the foreigner say he wants to see me?) (I replied to my son).’ me013

Example (16.43) is a question-answer conversation turn volunteered by Francisco Vaca:

(16.43) A: Eju =pa =tuS

diru-ya?

INT:LOC =REP =3SG(-FM) go-IMPFV

‘Where did he say he is going?’ n1.0415

B: Diru-ya =pa =tuS

[tu-ja e-pu=ju].

go-IMPFV =REP =3SG(-FM) 3SG-GEN NPF-village=LOC

‘He said he is going back to his community.’ n1.0415

In Cavineña, the way one asks someone to repeat something not understood is by saying ai=pa [INT=REP] ‘What’s that? What did you say?’.
There is an interesting use of the reportative particle that I witnessed (but unfortunately did not record) while living in Cavineña communities. People (often women or children) who were too shy to talk to me directly (even though they could be sitting or standing next to me) would have someone else more confident to report their questions or comments to me. I could hear the exact same sentence uttered twice except for the use of the reportative particle in the repeated sentence.
The origin of the reportative particle is quite unclear. All we can say is that it is homonymous with the singular hortative marker pa- ‘HORT.SG’ (§6.2.2) and the jussive marker pa- ‘JUSS’ (§6.2.3).

667 16.3.5. =di(dya) ‘STRG.EMPH’
The particle =di(dya) ‘STRonG EMPHasis’ expresses strong emphasis. The form =didya is only occasionaly used and apparently is in free variation with =di.

The particle =di(dya) is used to express strong feelings (as in (16.44) and (16.45)), to make requests more insistant (as in (16.47) or (16.48); see also (16.51) further below), to question about something one really wants to know the answer (as in (16.46)).

When one feels very affected by a very hot sun, one can comment to others (16.44), complaining (raising the pitch of the voice):

(16.44)

Uke-da=dyaCC hot-ASF=FOC

=di! = STRG.EMPH

‘It’s very hot (and I strongly suffer from it).’

In (16.45) (reproduced from (16.25)), a man is trying to prepare a soft drink mixing (what he thinks is) drink powder with water. In reality the powder he is using is leaven so the drink does not turn red as normally expected. When he thinks he knows why, he says:

(16.45)

Uma-dama=dya =di

In (16.46), a group of Cavineña men are spending a night out fishing. Suddenly they hear a noise nearby. They are very scared. Someone stands up and says:

In (16.47), in the middle of a recording session, Julio Mayo, the son of Ventura Mayo, came for a visit. Concerned that this would disrupt the recording, Ventura said to him “Please don’t talk yet! We are doing a recording.” and then (contrasting with what he just said):

(16.47)

Je-kwe=dya.

Nubi-na-kwe=dya

=di.

come-IMP.SG=FOC enter-COME.TEMP-IMP.SG=FOC = STRG.EMPH

‘But come! Do come in (lit. enter)!’ ct078

In (16.48), in the middle of a terrible drought, the horses are about to die from thirst. People are wondering where to find water. The horse owner said:

(16.48)

[Yume nabade=ju] =di

=taa ne-duju-ra

over.there swamps=LOC = STRG.EMPH=EMPH HORT.PL-take-HORT.PL

ekanaO iji-mere-ti=ishu! 3PL drink-CAUS-GO.TEMP-PURP.GNL
‘Let’s (pl) take them (our horses) there (down) to the swamp so that we can make them drink (water).’ en011

In most examples (as above) the form used is =di. In a few examples, we find the form =didya without any difference in distribution or meaning. Until more work can clarify whether there is a difference, =di and =didya will be treated as two different realisations of a single morpheme that occur in free variation.

An example of =didya is at (16.49). Here, Alfredo Tavo relates how, after having almost died from thirst during a journey, he finally found water at the end of the day. He was so thirsty that he spent the whole night drinking water. Alfredo comments that when he felt he had enough water:

(16.49)

Wekaka=wieCC

=didya

=ni.

be.at.dawn=JUST.BEFORE = STRG.EMPH =MAYBE

669 ‘Dawn might have been about to break.’ sd105
It is most likely that the dya formative that occurs in =didya is the phrasal particle =dya ‘FOC’ (§17.4). This particle cannot modify a 2P particle but could have been modifying di at a stage where this particle was independent. This requires more work.

16.3.6. =jatsu ‘EXACTLY’
The particle =jatsu ‘EXACTLY’ is only found with interrogative clauses (either content or polar questions). This particle appears to code the fact that the speaker is requesting a very precise answer at least in the case of a content question. We only have one instance of =jatsu with a polar question (in (16.53) below) and here =jatsu is possibly coding a request for a very honest answer.

In (16.50), Roberto Amapo has drunk his refreshment made of leaven powder (see (16.25) above). As a result his stomach swells and he gets very sick. He still has no idea that he used leaven powder instead of the appropriate drink prowder. When he comes to his friends, they try to find out what has happened so they ask him:

(16.50)

AiO =jatsu =tu-keO =miA

ara-wa?

INT =EXACTLY =3SG-FM =2SG(-ERG) eat-PERF

‘But what exactly did you eat?’ lv032

An example within a very similar context is at (T1.104) where Alfredo Tavo is asked if he knows medicinal plants to treat a sick person. Alfredo says yes but he wants to know the exact type of sickness so that he can think of the appropriate plant. So he asks: “but what is it exactly that he (the sick person) has?”.

In (16.51), from the community work conversation (see (16.38) above), Elio Tavo (E) has been doing all the talking with me. He wants the others (who are much shyer), and particularly Vidal Mayo (V), to ask me questions too:

670

In (16.53), Victoria Tavo, her daughter and me had been looking for food for our following day trip (see (16.36) above). A relative of Victoria, Maria Mayo, had monkey meat. But Maria was really wondering if I could really eat that type of meat so she asked me (16.52):

INT:LOC =EXACTLY =2SG(-ERG) eat-REC.PAST

‘Where exactly did you eat it (monkey)’ ka169

16.3.7. =taa ‘EMPH’ The particle =taa ‘EMPHatic’ expresses a mild (either positive or negative) surprise for something that goes a little bit against what one would have expected.
The particle =taa expresses subjective (as opposed to objective) statements. In (16.54), Roberto Amapo is invited to drink a refreshment he had never tried before. He finds it very tasty. He says to his friends:

(16.54)

In (16.55), Victoria Tavo and her daughter have left home with the ox-cart to fetch me from a nearby community. Their dog has followed them. They don’t want him to come along so the daughter accompanies it a little while towards their home. Victoria waits a very long time but the daughter doesn’t seem to come back. She says:

(16.55)

Diru-wa =ni

go-PERF =MAYBE =EMPH 1SG-GEN 1-daughter

‘(That’s strange.) It looks like my daughter has gone back (home) (and won’t accompany me)! ka011

In (16.56), Cosme Mayo relates how his dogs felt so desperate once he had fallen into a ditch and they thought he had died:

(16.56)

Enapa-wa =taa =tuna-raA =i-keO. cry.for-PERF =EMPH =3PL-ERG =1SG-FM
‘They (my dogs) cried for me!’ wa109

(See also (16.4b) above.)

The particle =taa is used to soften commands. In (16.57), =taa is used when the fox begs the jaguar not to eat him:

(16.57)

Aama =taa Kuku-chi! Ara-ume =taa i-keO! not.exist =EMPH uncle-AFFTN eat-IMP.SG =EMPH 1SG-FM
‘(The angry jaguar says to his nephews, the fox, who tricked him: “this time I am going to eat you!”. But the fox responds:) “No, Uncle. Don’t eat me! (But eat the beautiful cows over there!)”. zo037

672 The particle =taa is used in leave-taking formulas. The person who leaves says “I am going!” The person who stays responds: “go (=taa)!”.
This can be illustrated with the conversation turn in (16.58) below. I was recording a conversation between Antonio Yubanera (A) and Ventura Mayo (V) (in Ventura’s house). At the end, Antonio indicated to me that we had talked enough and that it was time to leave. Then he said to Ventura:
(16.58) A: YatseS =yatseS diru-nuka-ya. 1DL =1DL go-REITR-IMPFV ‘We are leaving (lit. going again).’ ab213

V: Diru-aje-ya? Ne-diru-kwe

go-INCR-IMPFV IMP.NSG-go-IMP.NSG =EMPH

‘You want to go (lit. you are gradually going)? Alright you (nsg) can go (lit. go!).’ ab214

The particle =taa is used with questions which normally should not have to be asked because under normal circumstances, the information (requested by the question) is available. In (16.59), Victoria Tavo and her daughter have travelled an entire day with an ox-cart to fetch me who had arrived at a nearby community. When they arrive, they cannot find me. Victoria says to herself:

673

16.3.8. =bakwe ‘CONTR’ The particle =bakwe ‘CONTRastive’ is used for a contrastive proposition that goes against what holds true for a different participant or location or purpose, etc.

In (16.60) Francisco Vaca, a newcomer to the community, is being teased by his friends about a cayman he had killed. He says:

(16.60)

‘(My friends knew jungle animals but) me, I didn’t know these things…’ lg027

‘I handle (lit. grab) shotguns too.’ sl085

In (16.62) (this is (T1.26)), Alfredo Tavo has arrived (by plane) at the village of the Araonas. He will stay in the village there while:

‘The pilot (unlike me) continued (lit. passed) (with the plane) to Ixiamas.’ ao026

In (16.63), Griselda Cartagena recounts a plane trip. They have been caught by a terrible storm and search desperatedly for a place to land. They cannot land at the community of Las Mercedes because the airstrip is full of water. Then they reach Bolivar where the situation is better:

(16.63)

Tu-wa =bakwe e-naCS aamaCC ju-kware pista=ju. there-LOC =CONTR water not.exist be-REM.PAST airstrip=LOC

674 ‘There (in Bolivar, as opposed to Las Mercedes), there was no water on the airstrip (so finally we managed to land).’ av029

The particle =bakwe is found in questions in greeting turns, which typically go as in (16.64):

(16.64) A: Eje-ji-uCC

=mi-keCS?

INT-good-PROP =2SG-FM

‘How are you?’

B: Ji-daCC! good-ASF

‘I’m fine. What about you?’

A: Ji-da=dyaCC! good-ASF=FOC
‘I’m fine too!’ n1.0041

Sometimes, the two contrasted constituents are both stated in subsequent main clauses both marked with =bakwe as in (16.65):

(16.65)

Amena tu-keS =bakwe ani-chine=dya. FILL 3SG-FM =CONTR sit-REC.PAST=FOC

‘Her, she stayed. Me, I went home.’ mo041-042

The origin of the particle =bakwe is possibly the verb ba- ‘see’ inflected with the singular imperative suffix -kwe ‘IMP.SG’, literally meaning ‘look!’.

675 16.3.9. =shana ‘PITY’
The particle =shana ‘PITY’ is used when the speaker feels pity/empathy for one of the participants.

16.3.10. Distribution
Second position particles appear to follow very strict order restrictions (unlike phrasal particles; see §17.17). When two (or more) second position particles co-occur, they are always found in the same order.
Table 16.8 below summarises all situations of co-occurrence of two second position particles and the order in which they occur, as per the available data (no attempt has been made yet to conduct elicitation on that topic). (Note that =jatsu ‘EXACTLY’ has not been included in the table since it does not co-occur with any other particles in the data.) Particles in the left column correspond to the first member of a sequence while particles in top horizontal row correspond to the second member. The table cross-references examples of attested combinations provided earlier in this chapter (and complemented by some example in (16.70)).

It is not clear whether two (or more) second position particles are in paradigmatic opposition. At first glance, this could be the case for =tukwe ‘COUNT.EVID’ and =ni ‘MAYBE’ which code different epistemic modality values. One observation is that there is a clear template for a sequence =di(dya) ‘STRG.EMPH’, then =ni ‘MAYBE’, then =pa ‘REP’ then =taa ‘EMPH’ (note that only three — not four — of these particles were found in a sequence, as in (16.71), from a recorded conversation.

17 Particles — phrasal particles
Independent particles (which occur freely in any position in any type of clause), first position particles (which only occur in first position in main clauses) and second position particles (which are enclitics to the last phonological word of the first immediate constitutuent of a main clause) have been discussed in the preceding chapter. The present chapter discusses the last type of particles: phrasal particles.
17.1. Introduction Phrasal particles, similarly to second position particles, do not form independent phonological words. All phrasal particles but one (ni= ‘NOT.EVEN’) are enclitics to the last phonological word of a phrase and have scope over the phrase only. (The particle ni= attaches to the first phonological word of a phrase.) Similarly to independent particles — but unlike first and second position particles — phrasal particles can occur in any type of clause.
Table 17.1 lists all the phrasal particles attested, provisionally sorted by semantics fields. The right column cross-references corresponding sections when available.

§17.2 §17.3 §17.4 §17.5 §17.6 §17.7 §17.8 §17.9 §17.10 §17.11 §17.12 §17.13 §17.14 §17.15 §17.16

Most phrasal particles can occur on any type of phrases (NP, PP, predicate, independent particles, adverbial clause, etc.). A few do however show some restrictions such as =jari ‘STILL’ and =jipenee ‘ALMOST’ which only occur on predicates and copula complements. The particle =ademe ‘thanks to’ only occurs on NPs and PPs.

Similarly to second position particles, phrasal particles can co-occur. Unlike second position particles, however, phrasal particles do not have strong ordering restrictions. This is the topic of §17.17.

If a phrase that is marked by phrasal particles is first in a main clause, these phrasal particles will be followed by second position particles, if present. This order (which cannot be reversed) is consistent with fact that phrasal particles have a narrower scope (their scope is only over a clausal constituent) than second position particles (their scope is over a whole main clause). See for example (17.17b) where two phrasal particles are followed by one second position particle. (Recall that second position particles — but not phrasal particles — are separated from their host and from each other by a space.)

681 The chain of clitics including phrasal particles (possibly followed by second position particles then by bound pronouns) can be further lengthened by postposition clitics if the constituent is a postpositional phrase. In this situation, the order is postposition, then phrasal particle, then second position particle, then bound pronouns. See for example (17.25d) where the associative postposition =tsewe is followed by three phrasal particles, and (17.66) where the postposition =tupu ‘UP.TO’ is followed by two phrasal particles and one second position particle.

17.2. =jari ‘STILL’ The particle =jari ‘STILL’ means that a state or an event is not yet completed but is nearing completion.

Unlike other phrasal particles, it is restricted to verbal predicates, copula complements (whatever they be) and (less often) adjunct constituents. It in not attested with other types of constituents. (See Table 17.2 further for a summary.)

In past tense settings, =jari means that the state/event has begun before and was still holding at the story time but does not hold at the present time anymore. This is illustrated in (17.1):

(17.1) a. Tumepatya =tuna-ja =tuS

At the beginning of a village meeting in Galilea, Antonio Mayo was missing. People were wondering where he was. Then someone said (17.2):

‘They say that he is still bathing (but will soon be back here).’ n4.0349

See also ‘when I was still a leader’ at (T1.1).

In present tense settings, =jari means that the state/event has begun in the past and will still hold true for some time in the future. This is illustrated in (17.3) (note that (17.3c) is (T1.117)):
(17.3) a. Eweebari=jariCC =mi-keCS. adolescent=STILL =2SG-FM ‘You are still a young man.’ tb102

d. Jadya=kamadya=jariCC! thus=ONLY=STILL

683 ‘That’s all for now (but we haven’t finished the meeting yet)!’ n1.0024

In future tense settings =jari means that the state/event will soon be finished after it has started, translating by ‘for while’. This is illustrated in (17.4):
(17.4) a. Kwa-ya=jari i-keS. go-IMPFV=STILL 1SG-FM ‘I’m going (and will come back soon).’ n4.0273

Similar meanings obtain in command settings such as imperative mood (in (17.5a)), hortative mood (in (17.5b)) and jussive mood (in (17.5c)):

Table 17.2 summarises the types of consituents and word classes that can be marked by =jari (recall that =jari is unique among the phrasal particles in the types of constituents it can modify). The right column makes cross-references to illustrated examples:

17.3. =nuka ‘REITR’
The phrasal particle =nuka ‘REITeRative’ codes the fact that a referent, property, state, event, location, etc. is similar to some other referent, property, etc. mentioned earlier. It is polysemous with the verbal Aktionsart suffix -nuka ‘REITR’ (see §7.1.4). Both can actually co-occur in a single (verbal) sentence (e.g., (17.8a) and (17.9a)).

In (17.7), =nuka modifies an NP is various syntactic functions:

e-ju=ke=nukaO.

17.4. =dya ‘FOC’
The particle =dya ‘FOCus’ expresses a mild contrastive focus. (A stronger contrast is obtained by fronting a constituent and using the 2P particle =bakwe ‘CONTR’ (see §16.3.8). The function of the particle =dya can be compared to stress-focus in English (see for example Givón 1990: 702). It singles out or gives a bit more prominence to one (or more) constituent in a sentence because this (or these) constituent carries information that constrasts with some other information or expectation.

The particle =dya can be used extremely frequently. In T1 for example, Alfredo Tavo uses =dya in 43% of the sentences (66 instances of =dya out of 153 sentences). Note that Gregorio Yubanera, on the other hand, does not use it a single time in T2.

In (17.10) we illustrate =dya on various types of constituents:

(17.10) a. Verbal predicate:

JuyeO nitya-nuka-wa.

Neti-chine=dya juyeS.

ox make.stand-REITR-PERF stand-REC.PAST=FOC ox

687 ‘I made the oxen stop (lit. stand) once again. (This time) they stopped (while earlier they wouldn’t; see (17.11) below).’ ka019

b. A argument:
[JeeCC=ke ebakwapiji=ra=dya]A =yatseO duju-chine. here=LIG small.child=ERG=FOC =1DL take-REC.PAST ‘This child (in the picture) (although he looks very young) carried us (dl) (in his canoe).’ ft010

c. Independent particle:

‘Finally, I found a hard stick (to finish killing the deer that I had shot).’ sl057

d. ‘Similarity’ finite adverbial clause:
… [mi-raA [ekwana-ja y-ana]O baka-ya=ama=bucha=dya] 2SG-ERG 1PL-GEN NPF-tongue hear-IMPFV=NEG=SIMLR=FOC
i-keS bisu-ya. 1SG-FM be.ashamed-IMPFV ‘I was shy (lit. ashamed) because I thought that (lit. as if) you didn’t understand (lit. hear) our (Cavineña) language. (And I didn’t know how to speak to you.)’ ka120

(See also, among many others, =dya on the negated CS argument dutya bina=ama ‘not all bats’ in (17.37a), on the associative pro-form tua-tsewe ‘with him (rather than alone)’ at (T1.84) and on the locative pro-form tu-wa ‘there’ in (T1.116).)
The particle =dya can occur more than once in a sentence as in (17.11):

(17.11)

688 JuyeCC=tibu=dya kwa-kara=dya=jutidya ju-ya. ox=REASON=FOC go-DESID=FOC=DISEMPH be-IMPFV
‘(I wanted to stop the oxen but they wouldn’t stop.) It is because they are oxen (and not because of other reasons — like being upset or anything), that they just want to go (as opposed to stop.)’ ka015

The particle =dya has a strong tendency to lexicalise. Quite a few forms in Cavineña have a formative (synchronically non-segmentable) ending dya. It is likely that in many cases — although we cannot be fully sure at the present time — that this formative is historically the focus particle. An exhaustive list of these forms is in Table 17.3.

jadya ‘thus’

independent particle; §16.1

second position particle =di ‘STRG.EMPH’; §16.3.5 ?

With three words, in (17.12) below, the particle =dya triggers the idiosyncratic

phonological modification, e->i in a. and dya->di in b.:

(17.12) a. tume ‘that, there’

->

tumi=dya (see (T1.3))

yume ‘that, over there’ ->

yumi=dya

b. jadya ‘thus’

->

jadi=dya

The focus particle =dya triggers the deletion of the formative -ke ‘FM’ found with absolutive singular independent pronouns (§15.1.2) as shown in (17.13) and exemplified in (17.14) (this is (T1.22)):

689

(17.13) i-ke ‘1SG’ -> i=dya

(*i-ke=dya)

mi-ke ‘2SG’ -> mi=dya (*mi-ke=dya)

i=dyaO

kwadisha-kware.

then =3PL-ERG (=1SG-FM) 1SG(-FM)=FOC send-REM.PAST

‘It is me whom they sent.’ ao022

There is another phonological modification that is triggered by =dya whereby the TAM inflectional verbal suffix -ya ‘IMPFV’ turns into -e when the suffix is followed by =dya. Unlike the words in (17.12) however, this is only a fast speech phenomenon. See the full discussion in §6.1.3.

17.5. =kwita ‘RESTR’
The particle =kwita ‘RESTRicted’ is used to restrict the referential scope of a category to its protypical members. It translates as ‘no more/no less’ with quantities, ‘just’ with events or properties, ‘only/alone’ with entities, ‘right/not before nor after’ with time.

In (17.15), we illustrate =kwita modifying predicates:

(17.15) a. Amena jipe-ti-kware=kwita

e-raA.

FILL approach-GO.TEMP-REM.PAST=RESTR 1SG-ERG

691 (17.17) a. Pronoun in A function:

‘(I ran inside the house that was on fire and) could only remove their (dl) beds.’ tk022

The particle =kwita triggers an idiosyncratic phonological change kw->j on the time independent particle iyakwa ‘now, today, nowadays’ becoming iyaja=kwita ‘right now’. This change looks like dissimilation, avoiding a sequence of two syllables with labial velar slops onsets. However, note that no such change occurs in other syllable sequences (e.g., kwa-kwe ‘go-IMP.SG’, kwa-kware ‘go-REM.PAST’, jikwi-kwisha- ‘cutREDUP+CAUS’.)

17.6. =kamadya ‘ONLY’ The particle =kamadya ‘ONLY’ restricts the reference to the members of a category (as opposed to any other members that could be associated with it).

692 In (17.18), =kamadya modifies core NPs:

(Another example of =kamadya marking an NP in O function is e-biti=kamadya ‘only her skin’ in (T2.13).)

In (17.19), =kamadya modifies an oblique NP:

(17.19)

In (17.20) from a recorded conversation between Teresa Rutani (T) and Antonio

693 Yubanera (A), =kamadya modifies the locative pro-form tuwa ‘there’:

(17.20) T: Tu-wa=kamadyaCC =tuCS

ju-kware.

there-LOC=ONLY =3SG(-FM) be-REM.PAST

In (17.21), =kamadya modifies constituents in adverbial functions:

=2SG-FM (=1SG-ERG) inform-IMPFV

‘This is all I will tell you (i.e. I’m finished with my story and I won’t tell you anything else).’ nk154

Often, speakers finish their stories with just jadya=kamadya ‘this is it’ as shown by the parenthesis in (17.21c).

In (17.22), =kamadya modifies a finite DS-temporal adverbial clause:

(17.22)

694 Imeta-ya=ju=kamadya e-raA ba-kware. point-IMPFV=DS=ONLY 1SG-ERG see-REM.PAST
'I saw her (the Pacahuara woman) only pointing her finger (to where her husband was) (but not saying anything).’ pa043

The particle =kamadya is scarcely found modifying a predicate. The only examples found are in (17.23):

(17.23) a. Kastere-kware=kamadya

i-keS

become.tired-REM.PAST=ONLY 1SG-FM

betsa=ra. swim=CAUSE

‘I was so tired (lit. tired and nothing else) from swimming (so much).’ mj178

b. Jekutana-ume=kamadya, Kupari" be.scarded-IMP.SG.NEG=ONLY godfather
‘(I’m going to show you something but) don’t be scared (or anything), Godfather!’ ht013

The particle =kamadya is similarly hardly found on any copula complements. One such rare example is (17.24) (this is (T1.5)). Here we have a (derived) adjective in CC function within a ‘similarity’ adverbial clause (marked by surbordinator =bucha ‘SIMLR’; see §19.4):

(17.24)

… =tu-keO =ekwanaA inimetupu-kware

=3SG-FM =1PL

think-REM.PAST

[tunaCS e-kawaiti=kwana=kamadyaCC=bucha]. 3PL RES-get.angry=UNCERT=ONLY=SIMLR
‘… we thought that it was not serious (lit. thought about them/the situation as if they (the Araonas) had gotten nothing more than a bit angry.)’

In very few examples, we find kamadya as a phonologically independent word (not as a phrasal particle) in fronted position. Its meaning as such is possibly ‘the only

695 thing is that…’ as in (T1.13). More work is required on this topic.

17.7. =tere ‘ONLY’ The phrasal particle =tere ‘ONLY’ is rare in the data (about 10 examples available). It’s meaning is apparently the same as =kamadya ‘ONLY’ (but more work might reveal some differences). It restricts reference to the members of category. It is found marking NPs in core functions (see (17.25a-b), adjectives in CC function (see (17.25c)) and postpositional phrases (see (17.25d)):
(17.25) a. NP in CS function
Ji-da=ke=tereCS =tunaCS e-mepeCC [pelota ijawe=ishu]. good-ASF=LIG=ONLY =3PL RES-pick.up football play=PURP.GNL ‘Only the best ones (players) have been selected (lit. picked up) for playing football.’ di1073

696 (that one would work)’ ab170
The phrasal particle =tere is likely to be historically related to the intransitive verb tere- ‘finish’. Note that there is also a verbal Aktionsart suffix -tere/-tirya which indicates that the S/O argument is completely affected by the verb event (see §7.1.1) and which is also presumably historically related to the same verb.

17.8. =piisi ‘JUST’
The particle =piisi ‘JUST’ is only found in a few examples. This particle is used to contrast information coded by a constituent (the constituent that is marked by =piisi) against some other information.

In (17.26), =piisi is found on an independent pronoun:

(17.26)

Mikwana=piisiO e-raA iwa-ya.

2PL=JUST

1SG-ERG wait.for-IMPFV

‘I will wait only for you (pl).’ di2238

Non-inflecting verb derived from inflecting verb (by Ø-marking; see §10.5) are often found marked with =piisi. An example is in (17.27):

(17.27) a. Diru=piisi go=JUST

‘(Stop repeating that you are leaving and) just go, Grandpa!’ n3.0504

go-AT.DAWN-REITR-IMPFV

‘(It is getting late now so we will stop the trip.) Tomorrow (at sunrise), we will keep going (and finish the trip).’ vb031

In (17.29), =piisi occurs on a SS-temporal subordinate clause:

(17.29)

[AiO tsuru-tsu=piisi=dya] INT meet-SS=JUST=FOC

17.9. =dyane ‘APPROX’ The particle =dyane ‘APPROXimately’ is used to indicate that a quantify, a distance, a location or a time is only approximate.

In (17.30), =dyane modifies a quantified O NP:

(17.30) a. JaeO =tuA

be-kware,

In =dyane modifies time coded by a DS-temporal clause:

‘My father put me in school, at Misión Cavinas, sometime at the end of November.’ mg003

17.10. =ama ‘NEG’
The most common function of =ama ‘NEGation’ is to negate a verbal predicate. We illustrate negated predicates in statements in (17.34) (transitive predicates) and (17.35) (intransitive predicates):

699 (17.34) Negated transitive predicates:

jakacha be.absent

pa-ju=ama JUSS-be=NEG

escuela=ju! school=LOC

‘Also, your children should not miss (lit. be absent at) school.’ di1648

The predicate of an imperative clause cannot be negated by =ama. (But note that the predicate of a hortative clause (see (17.34d) above) or jussive clause (see (17.35d) above) clauses can be negated with =ama.) It can only be negated by special inflectional verbal affixes (-ume ‘IMP.SG.NEG’ and ne-…-ume ‘IMP.NSG.NEG’; see §6.2.1).
One verbal suffix, the Aktionsart -jeri/-neri is sensitive to the polarity of the predicate. The form -jeri occurs when the predicate is positive (e.g. pakaka-jeri-chine ‘I almost fell’) while the form -neri occurs when the predicate is negative (e.g. tawi-neri-ya=ama=dya ‘they almost did not sleep’) (see §7.1.3 for full examples).
The particle =ama is also used to negate participant NPs/independent pronoun, as

701 shown in (17.36) (one word NPs) and (17.37) (multiple word NPs):

(17.36) a. A independent pronoun

Examples in (17.39) show negated non-finite adverbial clauses (Note that (17.39a) is (T1.69) and (17.39b) is (T1.72)):

(17.39) a. Negated SS-temporal clause:

Examples in (17.40) show a negated finite adverbial SS-temporal clause:

(17.40)

Muyajutidya =tuS

703 [tuna-raA iwa-ya=ju=ama]. 3PL-ERG wait.for-IMPFV=DS=NEG
‘Suddently a storm arrived when they were not expecting it.’ di2574

Da-adjectives have a special negative suffix -dama (e.g. ji-da ‘good’ vs. ji-dama ‘bad’; see §11.2.4). Independent adjectives (as well as derived adjectives), on the other hand are negated with =ama (and cannot take -dama) as with yukeneri ‘intelligent’ in (17.41) (see §11.3):

(17.41)

INT(=LIG)=DAT =MAYBE child

intelligent=NEG be-IMPFV

‘Their child could be (born) stupid (lit. a child could be not intelligent to any of them).’ bn030

17.11. ni= ‘NOT.EVEN’ The particle ni= ‘NOT.EVEN’ is the only proclitic in Cavineña. This particle is most likely borrowed from Spanish ni ‘not even’ as Cavineña ni= and Spanish ni have basically the same meaning, which is to reinforce the negative polarity of a negative clause. (The borrowed origin which would also explain its unusual proclitic status of Cavineña ni=.) Note also that Cavineña has a second position particle =ni ‘MAYBE’ to which it could also be related.
Examples of ni= ‘NOT.EVEN’ are given in (17.42):
(17.42) a. Tu-tataka =pa kwa-kware. AijamaCC tu-ja ni=chapaCS 3SG-ALONE =REP go-REM.PAST not.exist.at.all 3SG-DAT NOT.EVEN=dog

‘We do not use these (traditional ways of naming family members) nowadays, not even a little bit or something.’ fm003

In one example, in (17.43), ni= is used as the only negator in a negative clause. In this case, it appears that ni= is negating the clause by itself. More work is required to determine if this is truly possible, it this is the case of a different morpheme, or if this is a speech error.

NOT.EVEN=solid.ground sit-IMPFV

‘(It was water everywhere around me.) There was not a single piece of solid ground (lit. not even solid ground was sitting).’ mj075

17.12. =piji ‘DIM’
The phrasal particle =piji ‘DIMinutive’ is used to downplay the size (as in (17.44b), the strength (as in (17.44a)), the identity (as in (17.47) and (17.48)), the intensity (as in (17.45a,b), etc., of a referent, a state, an event, a location, etc.

In (17.44), =piji modifies various types of NPs:

There is some evidence that the particle =piji has lost its phrasal clitic status (and become lexicalised) in at least 4 words, as listed in Table 17.4.

708
Table 17.4: Words containing a formative piji

words ebakwapiji ‘small child’ jidapiji ‘beautiful’ riyapiji ‘a little’ pijidyane ‘CLOSE TO’

word class independent noun (§12.5) independent adjective (§11.3) independent particle (§16.1) postposition (see §14.9.9)

origin of the base ebakwa ‘child’ (§12.5) da-adjective ji- ‘good’ (§11.2) pointing demonstrative riya ‘here’ (§15.8) =dyane ‘APPROX’ (see §17.9)

In the case of ebakwapiji, the loss of phrasal clitic status can be observed when looking at the plural marker =kwana. This clitic has its scope over an NP head only and, as a result, always comes before =piji ‘DIM’ (as in (17.51a,b). But when =kwana marks ebakwapiji, =kwana follows piji (as in (17.51c)).

(17.51) a. karusune=kwana=piji pant=PL=DIM ‘little pants’ nk035

b. jae wiri=kwana=piji fish small=PL=DIM ‘tiny little fish.’ di2874

c. ebakwapiji=kwana small.child=PL ‘small children’
It is likely that ebakwa=kwana=piji might still be allowed (although not attested in the data). However, the point is that the order piji=kwana should not be allowed if piji had not lost it phrasal clitic status.
(It is possible that the same thing happens with piji within ebakujuna(=)piji ‘small girl’. Unfortunately this word is never marked with the plural clitic.)
In the case of jidapiji the change in meaning from ‘a bit good’ (diminutive reading) to ‘beautiful’ is likely to indicate its lost of phrasal particle status. A similar argument holds for riyapiji ‘a little bit’ (from riya ‘this, here’) and pijidyane ‘close to’ from =dyane ‘approximately’).

17.13. =ebari ‘INTENS’ The phrasal particle =ebari ‘INTENSifier’ is only found in a handful of examples

709 where it is used with non-inflecting verbs, adjectives in CC function and (in one case) a locative pro-form in CC function. In all cases, it has an intensifying meaning.

The use of =ebari with adjectives is shown in (17.52):

(17.52) a. Juji-u-si=ebariCC

señoraCS.

fat-ASF-AUGM=INTENS lady

‘The lady was very very big.’ mo012

gringo =3SG(-FM) big-ASF-AUGM=INTENS=RESTR be-PERF

‘(The canoe capsized, probably because it was very small and) the gringo (foreign white man) was very big.’ gr007

The particle =ebari is found occurring on non-inflecting verbs, as shown in (17.53):

(17.53) a. Kuji=ebari=kwita

riyabarepa ju-jara-chine.

In (17.54), Cosme Mayo talks about an enormous anteater he once killed. With his hands, Cosme mimics (for the audience) the size of the anteater’s arms and says, using

710 =ebari ‘INTENS’ on the locative pro-form re-wa ‘here-LOC’ (in CC function):

(17.54)

Re-wa=ebari=kwanaCC [tu-ja e-bi]CS. here-LOC=INTENS=UNCERT 3SG-GEN NPF-arm ‘It’s arms were this big.’ ba056

Note that corresponding to the phrasal particle =ebari ‘INTENS’, there is also an attributive adjective ebari ‘big’ (§13.2).

17.14. =jutidya/jutii ‘DISEMPH’
The particle =jutidya/=jutii ‘DISEMPHatic’ indicates that a referent, property, state or event coded by a constituent is not as good/impressive as one would have expected from the context. The form =jutii is only found in a few examples and with the exact same meaning (as in (17.57a) and (17.59) below).

Note that =jutidya/jutii resembles =piji ‘DIM’. The main difference is that =piji ‘DIM’ never carries any sense of expection not fulfilled.

In (17.55), =jutidya modifies core participants:

713 17.15. =jipenee ‘ALMOST’ The phrasal particle =jipenee ‘ALMOST’ is typically found on adjectives in CC function. It is also attested marking predicates (but not other types of constituents). Its function is to slightly attenuate the property coded by an adjective or the intensity of an event coded by a predicate. The particle =jipenee is possible historically related to the transitive verb jipe- ‘approach O’ (although the origin of nee is unknown).
In (17.61), =jipenee marks a predicate:
(17.61) a. Amena [e-kwe baji]S kueti-wa=jipenee. FILL 1SG-GEN fear pass-PERF=ALMOST ‘(After while) my fear (of the dangerous anteater) had almost passed (but I was still shivering).’ ba113

714 17.16. =kwana ‘UNCERT’
The particle =kwana ‘UNCERTain’ indicates that the speaker is uncertain of the reference/property/state/event/etc coded by a constituent. The speaker makes a guess of what he thinks is the likely referent/property, etc. indicating that this might be different.

We illustrate the uncertainty marker with different types of constituents.

‘Couldn’t you leave (lit. put) it (your tape recorder) to us or something (i.e. leave it or buy a different one, etc.)? tb063

In (17.67) (this is (T1.59), =kwana marks an oblique direct-speech constituent:

kweja-kware. inform-REM.PAST ‘“I’m like you,” I told him, or something like that.’ ao059

The particle =kwana is very often used in rhetorical questions (as in (17.68a) or in indefinite expressions (as in (17.68b)) when what is questioned or referred to as indefinite is completely unknown to the speaker:

(17.68) a. Eju=kwana =tuS

(See also (T1.5), reproduced and commented at (17.24) above.)

Note that the particle =kwana ‘UNCERT’ is homophonous with the plural marker =kwana ‘PL’ (see §12.3). Although the two forms are possibly historically related, they are synchronically clearly different morphemes. They have quite different semantics. They also have a different distribution (the plural marker only occurs within an NP whereas =kwana ‘UNCERT’ marks all sorts of constituents).

717 17.17. Distribution
Phrasal particles, unlike second position particles, do not appear to have strict positioning restrictions but only tendencies.
Table 17.5 lists all combinations attested in the available data of phrasal particles. Particles in the left column correspond to the first member of a sequence while particles in top horizontal row correspond to the second member. Illustrative examples available in the preceding sections are cross-referenced, as well as a few more examples provided below. Combinations which are attested in either orders are coded by cells with thick borders. (Note that =dyane ‘APPROX’ and =jipenee ‘ALMOST’ are not included. This is so because they never co-occur with any other phrasal particles in the data.)

19 Finite adverbial clauses
Finite adverbial clauses differ from non-finite ones in that their verb has to take a TAM inflectional marker — whereas with non-finite clauses, the verb cannot take any of these markers (see Chapter 18). A general overview of the morpho-syntax of finite adverbial clauses is given in §19.1.
We have identified four major adverbial clauses: (1) different subject temporal clause (marked by =ju ‘DS’) (DS-temporal clauses) in §19.2, (2) reason clause (marked by =tibu ‘REASON’) in §19.3, (3) ‘similarity’ clause (marked by =bucha ‘SIMLR’) in §19.4 and (4) conditional clause (marked by =ke juatsu ‘COND’) in §19.5. These clauses are well attested in the available data and represent synchronically productive structures.
In addition to the major adverbial clauses, we briefly examplify (and very tentatively discuss) a number of additional minor adverbial finite clauses: ‘thanks to’ clauses (marked by =ademe) in §19.6.1, concessive clauses (marked by amaka or pa…=amabucha ‘EVEN.THOUGH’) in §19.6.2 and simultaneity clauses (marked by mekeeke or tsunumee ‘WHILE’) in §19.6.3. These clauses are very rare and are likely to be archaic structures.
19.1. Morpho-syntactic introduction 19.1.1. Finiteness Finite adverbial clauses have a finite verb (i.e. a verb inflected with a TAM marker) and a marker of dependency.
An example of a transitive reason clause is shown in (19.1) below:

(19.1)

747

[E-raA butseeju salonO ina-ya=tibu]

=tu-raA =ØO

1SG-ERG first.time rifle grab-IMPFV=REASON =3SG-ERG (=1SG-FM)

ejene-kware=ama. believe-REM.PAST=NEG
‘Because it was the first time I was using (lit. grabbing) a rifle, she (my sister-in-law) did not believe me (when I told her that I had killed a deer).’ sl067

The dependency marker =tibu codes the semantic relation of reason. The verb in this example takes the TAM inflectional suffix -ya ‘IMPFV’. Imperative inflectional affixes (including imperative, hortative and jussive markers) are never used in adverbial clauses. Reason clauses allow for the full range of TAM markers. Some other clauses can only take a selection of these markers. For example DS-temporal clauses (different subject temporal clauses) can only take the imperfective -ya, the perfect -wa and the potential e-…-u. As with other non-inflectional affixes, they are potentially all possible with any types of adverbial clauses.
The core argument NPs, when overtly expressed, receive the same (ergativeabsolutive) coding as in a main clause. In (19.1) for example where both A and O are overtly expressed, A is marked by =ra and O is unmarked. In addition we have the independent particle butseeju ‘(for) the first time’.
However adverbial clauses are not equivalent to a main clause. First, they are marked for dependency and cannot stand by themselves. Second, the verb of an adverbial clause always comes last whereas main clause verbs can occur anywhere. Third, finite adverbial clauses have fewer possibilities for grammatical categories. Notably, these clauses have no second position. In other words, second position categories cannot be expressed — such as second position particles (reportative =pa, emphatic =taa, etc.) or bound pronouns. Also, they cannot take first position particles either.

748 19.1.2. Subordination
Finite adverbial clauses in Cavineña are subordinate clauses because they function similarly to any main clause constituent (e.g. core NP, postpositional phrase, independent particle, etc.).

The first piece of evidence for finite adverbial clause as main clause constituents is given by positioning of (main clause) second position clitics. These clitics, as we know, invariably attach to the last phonological word of the first constituent of the main clause. Crucially, they attach to the last phonological word of a finite adverbial clause if this clause comes first.

In (19.2), for example, the second position reportative particle =pa attaches to kayuama-wa=tibu because the reason adverbial clause barepa kayuamati-wa=tibu is the first constituent of the main clause. If this was not the case, ijeti ‘sun’ would be the first constituent of the main clause and =pa would have attached to it.

(19.2)

[BarepaS kayuamati-wa=tibu] =pa ijetiS aputa-wa.

sky

deteriorate-PERF=REASON =REP sun disappear-PERF

‘Because the (lit. sky) weather had turned bad, the sun had disappeared.’ se015b

The second piece of evidence comes from the fact that similarly to any main clause constituents, finite adverbial clauses have the possibility to ‘move around’ and occupy any possible position. The sentence in (19.3) for example shows the conditional clause tawi-ya=ke juatsu between the first constituent rewa ‘here’ and the second-andlast constituent tawi-ya=dya.

(19.3)

Re-wa=dya =ni =metseS [tawi-ya=ke

juatsu]

here-LOC=FOC =MAYBE =2DL sleep-IMPFV=CONDIT CONDIT

tawi-ya=dya. sleep-IMPFV=FOC
‘If you are going to sleep, then you might as well sleep here (in my house).’ ka115

749 Note however that first or final positions are generally preferred by most adverbial clauses.

19.2. Different-subject temporal clause 19.2.1. Semantics Different subject temporal clauses (DS-temporal clauses) are marked by =ju ‘DS’. Their main function is to code temporal settings for their controlling clause predicate.

Examples with preposed temporal clauses are in (19.4). (See also ‘when I was still a leader…’ in (T1.1)):

(19.4) a. A-kware=dya

=tunaA

teeO.

affect-REM.PAST=FOC =3PL(-ERG) field

[Rarara-wa=ju] =tunaA

tucha-kware.

dry-PERF=DS =3PL(-ERG) burn-REM.PAST

‘They cleared a field. When it (the slashed vegetation) had dried, they burnt it.’ fd016

b. [Tu-raA mare-wa=ju] =tuS

pakaka-wa.

3SG-ERG shoot-PERF=DS =3SG(-FM) fall-PERF

‘He (Lucio) shot it (the porcupine) and it (porcupine) fell down.’ ij022

Example (19.5) comes from a recorded conversation of a group of Cavineña men doing community work. In the middle of the conversation a foreigner (a merchant who does not speak Cavineña) arrived and everybody switched to Spanish. As the conversation (in Spanish) went on, I decided to turn the tape-recorder off until the conversation was resumed in Cavineña. After this happened a couple of times, my turning-on-and-off of the tape recorder was noticed by Vidal Mayo, who informed his workmates:

(19.5)

[PeyaS kisarati-ya=ju] =tu-ja =tuO

‘When the other (the non-Cavineña speaker) talks, he (the author) turns it

750 (his tape-recorder) off!’ tb046

Examples with postposed temporal clauses are in (19.6):

(19.6) a. Nereda =tu-raA =ØO

a-kware

scold =3SG-ERG (=1SG-FM) affect-REM.PAST

‘We (teachers in Bolivia) have a holiday at the end of November. (Lit. There is a holiday to us when the month of November is finishing.)’ ga002

Examples of temporal clauses based on copula clauses (with omitted predicate) are in (19.7a) (with a NP as CC) (note that this example is T1.1), (19.7b) (with an adjective as CC), and (19.7b) (with a locative / adverbial demonstrative pro-form):

(19.7) a. … [i-keCS CIRABO=ju dirigente=jariCC=ju] =tuS

‘When I was there (just about to arrive), the sun set.’ sd068

DS-temporal clause predicates make the most use of the aspectual inflectional markers -ya ‘IMPFV’ and -wa ‘PERF’ to code a simultaneous vs. sequential contrast between the temporal clause event and the clause event. The marker -ya ‘IMPFV’ codes simultaneity. Both events occur at the same time (as in (19.5) and (19.6b) above).

The marker -wa ‘PERF’ codes sequence. The clause event occurs/begins when the temporal clause event is completed (as in (19.4a), (19.4b) and (19.6a) above).

The tense inflectional markers -chine ‘REC.PAST’ and -kware ‘REM.PAST’ are not attested. The potential circumfix e-…-u ‘POT’, on the other hand does show up in a couple of examples as shown in (19.8) (note that (19.8b) is (T1.52)) (see also (T1.61), (T1.70)):

(19.8) a. Amena [tata Felipe]CS baji-daCC ju-wa FILL Mr. Felipe scared-ASF be-PERF

[tu-ja

e-tareS

e-tiru-u=ju].

“As you (in the Araona village) could end up killing each other, I (a leader of CIRABO indigenous organisation) will talk to them (the Araona family that is making trouble)…’ ao052

752

Phrasal particles that would normally cliticise on the predicate of a main clauses can also be used with temporal clauses as with the negative particle =ama in (19.9) (see also =jari ‘STILL’ (in T1.1)):

(19.9)

[SalonS pututa-ya=ama=ju] =tuS rifle explode-IMPFV=NEG=DS =3SG(-FM)

kwa-nuka-wa go-REITR-PERF

[peya e-tare=ju]. other NPF-house=LOC
‘(The rifle of Lucio, who wanted to kill the porcupine did not work.) As the rifle didn’t want to work (lit. explode), he (Lucio) went to another house (to ask for another rifle).’ ij019

The reader will probably have noted that the DS-temporal clause marker =ju ‘DS’ is homophonous with the locative postposition =ju ‘LOC’ (as in peya e-tare=ju ‘to another house’ in (19.9) above). Adding to this the fact that, in Cavineña, RCs are structurally similar to finite adverbial clauses and can have adverbial meanings (see Chapter 20), one might want to analyse DS-temporal clauses as relative clauses within locative phrases. A discussion of evidence for treating these two types of constructions as different is in §20.6.2.

19.2.2. ‘Tail-head’ linkage
Quite similarly to SS-temporal clauses (same subject temporal clauses; see §18.2), temporal clauses are used to repeat information, typically the main predicate of the immediately preceding sentence. As discussed in §18.2, this is called ‘tail-head’ or ‘lexical overlap’ in the literature (Thompson and Longacre 1985: 209 ff.).

Two examples are provided in (19.10):

(19.10) a. [Jadya ju-ya=ju] =tuS

matujaS jipetana-kware.

‘Then they took me (who was lying unconscious) home. After they had taken me home, I recovered consciousness (lit. I saw myself).’ mg020-030

19.2.3. Switch-reference DS-temporal clauses are the only type of adverbial clauses to require a different subject from their controlling clause.

Examples with no shared participants are in (19.5), (19.6b), (19.7a,b,c), (19.8a,b) and

(19.9). The following table shows all allowed combinations of core argument sharing

and corresponding examples (S and CS arguments — which behave in all respects

similarly in Cavineña — have been lumped together under the label S):

DS-temporal clauses, together with SS-temporal clauses (see §18.2.2), make a system of switch-reference as defined in Haiman and Munro (1983). It is interesting to note that the Cavineña SS-temporal clause is iconically less finite than the DS-temporal clause. This fact that is consistent with Givón’s prediction that “clauses that involve

754 higher referential contituity tend to receive less-finite marking” (1990: 875) corroborated by cross-linguistics findings (such as Haiman 1983).

19.3. Reason clause
The marker =tibu marks a clause that gives a reason for the occurrence of the event coded by their controlling clause. Its semantics is roughly similar to the English subordinators ‘because’ or ‘since’.

19.3.1. Semantics In (19.11) and (19.2) (repeated), we illustrate intransitive reason clauses:

(19.11) a. Ara-chine=ama =tu-keO =ØA

ensaladaO [jeke-wa=tibu].

eat-REC.PAST=NEG =3SG-FM (=1SG-ERG) salad

‘I did not eat the salad because I was full (lit. I had filled up).’ br043

b. [E-kwe suerteS ani-ya=tibu]

‘(After killing the viper, the soldier said to himself:) “I’m (very) lucky it did not bite me!” (lit. Because luck sits to me, it did not bite me.) so011

(19.2)

deteriorate-PERF=REASON =REP sun disappear-PERF

‘Because the weather (lit. sky) had turned bad, the sun had disappeared (and because the hunter could not rely on the sun to find his way, he got lost).’ se015b

Examples of reason clauses based on copula clauses (with omitted copula predicate) are shown in (19.12):

755

(19.12) a. [Mi-keCS [chapa metse]CC=tibu] =tu-raA =miO

tupu-ya.

2SG-FM dog owner=REASON =3SG-ERG =2SG(-FM) follow-IMPFV

‘As you are the dog owneri, hei will follow you. (whereas he didn’t want to follow me).’ tg030

b. [Pae=kwana=tsewe=amaCC=tibu]=tunaCS priest=PL=ASSOC=NEG=REASON =3PL

EseEja=kwanaCS EseEjja.person=PL

[dyake mure-da]CC. very ferocious-ASF
‘Since theyi were not (living with) the priests, the Ese Ejja people were very dangerous.’ hs018

In (19.1) (repeated) and (19.13) we illustrate transitive reason clauses:

(19.1)

[E-raA butseeju salonO ina-ya=tibu]

=tu-raA =ØO

1SG-ERG first.time rifle grab-IMPFV=REASON =3SG-ERG (=1SG-FM)

‘Because it was the first time I was using (lit. grabbing) a rifle, she (my sister-in-law) did not believe me (when I told her that I had killed a deer).’ sl067

take.care.of-REITR-REC.PAST=REASON

‘We thank you because you looked after us this past week (lit. when this week passed).’ (Camp 1985: 45)

Reason clause verbs can take the full range of verbal morphology. In the preceding examples, for example we have -wa ‘PERF’ in (19.11a) and -ya ‘IMPFV’ in (19.11b). Unlike DS-temporal clauses, reason clause verbs also take the past marker -kware ‘REM.PAST’ (as in (19.14)) and -chine ‘REC.PAST’:

(19.14)

[Tu-ra=kamadyaA ijetiO jipe-kware=tibu]

=pa =tuCS

3SG-ERG=RESTR sun approach-REM.PAST=REASON =REP =3SG(-FM)

pude-daCC. red-ASF
‘Because he (the sun bird) is the only one who had approached the sun (in the old time), he is red.’ hi009

There are no co-reference restrictions between a reason clause and its controlling

clause. In (19.2) for example, there are no co-referent arguments. The following table

summarises various situations of co-reference found in earlier examples:

757 19.3.2. Pro-forms
There is a specific question marker ‘why’ which is ejebuchajuatsu, a frozen form from a complex phrase involving the interrogative pro-form eje-bucha (see §19.4 below), the intransitive auxiliary ju- and the same subject marker -(a)tsu (ejebucha ju-atsu [INT:SIMLR AUX.ITR-SS]). An example is at (19.15) (another example is (T1.27)):

(19.15)

19.4. Similarity clause
The adverbial clause marker =bucha ‘SIMiLaR’ marks a clause — that I will refer to as ‘similarity’ clause — indicating a way/situation the controlling clause event is (unexpectedly) similar to. These clauses are roughly equivalent to the English subordinators ‘as (if), like, similar to’. As with reason clauses, there are no co-reference restrictions between the similarity clause and the controlling clause. There are also two (possibly) synonymous ‘similarity’ clause markers =bae and =jiu that will be briefly (they only occur in very few examples) illustrated at this end of this section.

19.4.1. Semantics An example of an intransitive ‘similarity’ clauses is in (19.16):

‘Similarity’ clauses are very frequently used with perception verbs such as ba‘see, feel internally’, baka- ‘hear’, adeba- ‘know, remember, etc. These are illustrated in (19.19) (intransitive clause in (19.19a)), (19.19b) (copula clause) and (19.20) (transitive clause):

In all examples available of ‘similarity’ clauses, there is always an argument in

760

common (more work is needed to determine if this is obligatory). On the other hand,

there does not appear to be any particular pattern of co-reference, as shown by the

various argument sharing situations summarised in the following table:

A few examples are available of two additional similarity clause markers =bae ‘SIMLR’ and =jiu ‘SIMLR’. They are illustrated with an example in (19.21):

‘After doing that (getting ready to sleep), they (our Cavineña ancestors) heard something like a person walking, like someone walking, in the pampa (near their camp)…’ cc014

These two subordinate clause markers need to be investigated. They are likely to show some semantic differences from =bucha (note that in (19.21b) we have both markers =bucha and =jiu occurring in the same sentence) and from each other.

761

19.4.2. Pro-forms ‘Similarity’ clauses can be questioned with the specific pro-form ejebucha ‘INT:SIMLR’ as in (19.22):

‘(The husband asked his wife:) “How did you cook (lit. affect) the fish?” (To which she answered: “I boiled it”.)’ ap016

19.5. Conditional clause Conditional clauses are marked by a combination of an enclitic =ke and the (grammatically and phonologically) independent word juatsu.

This is illustrated in (19.23a) (from a recorded text), (19.23b) (from the dictionary) and (19.23c) (volunteered by Francisco Vaca):

(19.23) a. Ita

A conditional clause based on a copula clause is shown in (19.24):

(19.24)

[[Ijike nana]CC=ke juatsu] =tunaA

‘If it (the corn they use to prepare tamale breads) is fresh corn (lit. young corn), then they grate it in a grater (lit. in what grates corn).’ tm003

Conditional clauses is most cases occur first. However, this is not obligatory. The examples in (19.3) (repeated) and (19.25) show conditional clauses in other positions:

(19.3)

Re-wa=dya =ni

1SG-FM disappear-REC.PAST=CONDIT CONDIT

‘This is what your father was thinking (lit. thus was your father’s mind) if I had died.’ pf068

763 One example is available of a negated conditional clause. It is given in (19.26) below. It shows that the negation marker (the general phrasal particle =ama) cliticises on the =ke part of the conditional marker:

(19.26)

[Weka-da=ju

a-ya=ke=ama

juatsu] =tunaS

bright-ASF(=LIG)=LOC affect-IMPFV=CONDIT=NEG CONDIT =3PL

‘If they (our Cavineña ancestors) didn’t catch (lit. affect) it (fish) during the day (lit. in what is bright), then they could do (i.e. catch) it in the evening.’ ct088

Conditional clauses often share an argument. However, this is not an absolute

requirement, as shown by (19.25). Various attested combinations of co-referent

arguments are listed in the following table.

The origin of the discontinuous marker =ke juatsu ‘CONDIT’ is quite transparent. It has evolved from a copula clause with its CS co-referent with the subject of the controlling clause and with a headless relative clause as its CC. In other words conditional clauses are originally ‘CS being one that V1, S/CS/A V2’. The details are as follows.

First, the =ke part of conditional clauses is most likely the ligature marker =ke whose function is marking a relative clause. In (19.23b), for example kastere-wa=ke would be literally ‘one who has become tired’. Then the juatsu part of conditional clauses is clearly the copula/auxiliary ju- with the same subject marker -(a)tsu. We would thus have a copula clause. Kastere-wa=ke ju- in (19.23b) would be literally ‘be one who has become tired’ (i.e. a headless relative clause). Finally, this copula clause would be a . As we saw in §18.2, one function of this marker is ‘tail-head linkage / lexical overlap’

764 (repeating preceding information for discourse coherence). Therefore, the complete conditional clause kastere-wa=ke ju-atsu in (19.23b) would literally mean ‘X being one who has become tired, X (can rest for a while)’.
Similarly, the conditional clause in (19.23a) would be ‘being one that is (inside the burrow), he (the peccary)…’.
In this work, however, we recognise a separate conditional clause and we treat the combination of the two forms =ke and juatsu as a unique (although discontinuous) conditional morpheme marker. The problems with the copula-clause-with-headlessrelative-clause-complement reading arise from the fact that conditional clauses do not require any core argument sharing with the controlling clause and this makes it impossible to have a same subject reading.
This is the case in (19.25) above for example. In this example, a copula clause reading for the conditional clause could only be ‘I being one who died’ with ‘I’ as the subject. It cannot be co-referent to the main clause subject which is ‘your father’s thinking’.
As a result it is best to recognise a separate conditional construction clause. Historically, however, the structural similarities between the two constructions makes it fairly clear that the conditional clause has evolved form the copula construction. This also nicely corroborates cross-linguistic findings that copula clauses are a well attested source for conditional markers (see for example Traugott 1985: 291).
19.6. Minor finite adverbial clauses The adverbial clauses discussed below are considered minor in the sense that they are very scarce in the data. This is either because they are archaic constructions or they are very marked and only occur on rare occasions. The discussions that follow are only tentative and require more work.
19.6.1. =ademe ‘THANKS TO’ The morpheme =ademe ‘THANKS TO’ is found in about 15 examples. It codes a reason

765 for a happy situation coded by the controlling clause.

It is illustrated in (19.27) marking a verbal clause in (a.) and a copula clause (with omitted copula verb) in (b.):

(19.27) a. [MikwanaS ju-na-wa=ademe]

=ekwanaCS uma-daCC.

2PL

be-COME.TEMP-PERF=THANKS.TO =1PL

many-ASF

‘It is good that you (pl) came because now we are many.’ di1990

b. [Yachi jika-daCC=ademe] =taa =ØS

aje-ya=ama.

pampa untidy-ASF=THANKS.TO =EMPH (=1SG-FM) walk-IMPFV=NEG

‘The pampa is very thick (lit. untidy) (and could hurt my legs) so I won’t walk (and it’s a good reason for me to sit lazily in the cart).’ ka429

In some cases, =ademe attaches directly to a NP/noun, as shown in (19.28).

(19.28)

Chapa=ademe =tu-ja =tuO

ina-kware=ama.

dog=THANKS.TO =3SG-DAT =3SG(-FM) grab-REM.PAST=NEG

‘(The anaconda missed the man but caught his dog.) Thanks to the dog, he (the man) did not get caught.’ si006b

It is not altogether clear how this example should be analysed. One possibility is that in this example, =ademe is a postposition. Another possibility is to have an underlying verb omitted (as seen with general purpose clauses; see §18.3.3).

More intriguing are cases where =ademe attaches directly to an ergative case marked NP as shown in (19.29):

(19.29) a. Yusurupai, Rubuiba! Mi-ra=ademeA

=ØO

chachane-wa.

thank.you maned.wolf 2SG-ERG=THANKS.TO (=1SG-FM) heal-PERF

‘Thank you, Maned Wolf! You save me.’ di0665

b. Akwi=ra=ademeA =ØO

pene-wa [iba=raA e-ara-u=ke]O.

tree=ERG=THANKS.TO (=1SG-FM) protect-PERF jaguar=ERG POT-eat-POT=LIG

766 ‘The tree protected me from being eaten by the jaguar.’ di2208
This suggests that in (19.29) (and (19.28) as well), =ademe should rather be analysed as a particle. It could either be a phrasal particle or a second position particle (note that in all the examples, =ademe attaches to the last phonological word of the first immediate constituent of the main clause). Unfortunately, this would not explain (19.27a,b).

19.6.2. Concessive clauses
A few examples are available of two types of concessive finite clauses. The first type is marked by majaka ‘EVEN.THOUGH’, optionally combined with arepa ‘EVEN.THOUGH’ that comes at the beginning of the clause. The second type, for which we only have two examples, is marked by the enclitic morpheme =amabucha and the optional marker arepa at the beginning of the clause.

We briefly discuss both types below.

Starting with majaka, the examples in (19.30) were volunteered by Alfredo Tavo:

(19.30) a. [Ba-da ba-ya majaka] =ØS

kwa-wa

cold-ASF see-IMPFV EVEN.THOUGH (=1SG-FM) go-PERF

tee=ju. field=LOC

‘Even though I was feeling cold, I went (working) in my field.’ n2.0904

ara-wa.

EVEN.THOUGH RES-fill.up EVEN.THOUGH =3SG-FM (=1SG-ERG) eat-PERF

'Although I was full, I ate it.’ n2.0905

In (19.31) we provide the only two textual example available:

(19.31)

[Uje-da ba-ya majaka] =pa =tuS painful-ASF see-IMPFV EVEN.THOUGH =REP =3SG(-FM)

767 ‘(The man was lying half dead, the giant anteater on top of him, its claws hooked deep into his ribs.) Even though he (the man) was feeling great pain (lit. feeling it painful), he managed to pull himself little by little (lit. be scrubbed) toward his machete (lit. toward where the machete was lying).’ na017b

b. [Neti-baka-neti-baka

ju-ya majaka] ekatseS diru-chine.

stand-SHORT-REDUP-REDUP be-IMPFV EVEN.THOUGH 3DL go-REC.PAST

‘Even though they (dl) (the pair of oxen pulling our cart) kept stopping (lit. standing) for short periods, (at least) they (dl) (still) kept going.’ ka295

In a recorded text, we find two examples of majaka marking the abstract nouns baji ‘fear’ (corresponding to adjective baji- ‘scared’) given in (19.32a) and bisu ‘shame’ (corresponding to verb bisu- ‘be ashamed’) given in (19.32b):

(19.32) a. Muya-aje-ya

=ØS

[baji majaka]…

scare.away-INCR-IMPFV (=1SG-FM) fear EVEN.THOUGH

‘(As we — in a cart pulled by oxen — entered a section of the path that was full of water) I kept guiding (lit. scaring) them (the oxen) although with fear.’ ka084

b. [Bisu majaka]

ne-ju-nati!

shame EVEN.THOUGH HORT.DL-be-GO.TEMP

‘Let’s (dl) get there (and talk to that foreigner) even though we are feeling shy!’ ka091

The syntax of these examples are not altogether clear and more data is required.

The origin of the concessive marker is most likely the e-noun -majaka ‘place’ as shown in (19.33):

(19.33)

Tume =tuna-raA =ekwanaO tya-tsa-kware

e-majakaO.

then =3PL-ERG =1PL

give-come(O)-REM.PAST NPF-space

‘(When we arrived at the village of the Pacahuara people,) they gave us a

768 place (lit. space) (where we could sleep).’ pa015

There are only three examples available of the second type of concessive clause, marked by the discontinuous morpheme (arepa) …=amabucha ‘EVEN.THOUGH’. One example, in (19.34) below is based on verbal clause:

(19.34)

[Arepa

karetu=tsewe jeti-wa=amabucha]

EVEN.THOUGH cart=ASSOC come-PERF=EVEN.THOUGH

[e-kwe e-tima=kwana]CS uje-daCC. 1SG-GEN NPF-lower.back=PL painful-ASF
‘Even though I’ve travelled (lit. come) in the cart (i.e. I have not walked), my lower back area (still) hurts.’ ka546

The remaining two examples are based on copula clauses. Very surprisingly, the copula verb takes a marker pa- (presumably related to the jussive pa- ‘JUSS’ prefix; see discussion of this prefix in §6.2.3). The two examples are given in (19.35) below:

(19.35) a. [Arepa

ba-daCC pa-ju=amabucha]

EVEN.THOUGH cold-ASF EVEN.THOUGH -be=EVEN.THOUGH

b. [Arepa

EVEN.THOUGH-be=EVEN.THOUGH HORT.SG-leave-REITR

‘Even though my mother is old, I will leave her again!’ (Camp 1989: 281 and di0125)

The origin of the concessive marking pa-…=amabucha ‘EVEN.THOUGH’ appears to be

the combination of the jussive marker pa- ‘JUSS’ (with copula clauses), the negation

particle =ama and the ‘similarity clause’ marker =bucha (see discussion of this marker

in §19.4 above). If this reconstruction is correct, the (copula) concessive clause ‘even

though my mother is old’ in (19.35b) would have literally been constructed and would

literally mean as follows:

1) ‘let my mother be old’

(pa- ‘JUSS’)

2) ‘let my mother not be old’

(pa- ‘JUSS’ + =ama ‘NEG’)

3) ‘as if to let my mother not be old’ (pa- ‘JUSS’ + =ama ‘NEG’ + =bucha ‘SIMLR’)

19.6.3. Simultaneity clauses
There are two attested marker of simultaneous clauses: mekeeke and tsunumee. They are both translated by ‘while’ in English. Too few examples are available to know what (if any) is the difference and we provide both with the same glossing ‘WHILE’. We briefly illustrate both below.

There are no recorded examples of simultaneity clauses marked by mekeeke Example (19.36) comes from a written text:

(19.36)

[Kati-ya mekeeke] =pa =tuS

e-na=tsewe

fight-IMPFV WHILE =REP =3SG(-FM) NPF-water=ASSOC

ka-jibururu-ti-kware. REF-wash.the.face-REF-REM.PAST
‘(At the same time they (the man and the imp) were fighting, he (the man) washed his face with water.’ du019

The following two examples were volunteered by Alfredo Tavo:

(19.37) a. [VasoO ina-ya

mekeeke]

glass grab-IMPFV WHILE

770

wene-wene-ya.

earaki ju-wa.

wash-REDUP-IMPFV WHILE (=3SG-FM) cook be-PERF

‘While she was (lit. washing), he was cooking.’ n2.0910

The origin of the mekeeke is unknown. It possibly includes the perlative postposition =eke ‘PERL’. However the formative meke is not found outside mekeeke.

Three examples are available of simultaneity clauses marked by tsunumee. The two textual examples are unfortunately too complicated to be used as illustrations. A simple example come from the dictionary, reproduced below:

(19.38)

[Mi-keS ara-ara-ya

tsunumee] =tu-keO =ØA

kirikaO

2SG-FM eat-REDUP-MPFV WHILE =3SG-FM (=1SG-ERG) paper

wene-ya. write-IMPFV ‘While you will be eating, I will be writing a letter.’ (Camp 1989: 278)

The origin of tsunumee is most likely the adjective tsunu- ‘long (time)’. The origin of mee however is unknown.

20 Relative clauses
Relative clauses (RC) are structurally similar to finite adverbial clauses. They consist of a clause with an inflected verb and a dependency marker, =ke ‘LIG’. This is discussed under §20.1.
The ligature marker =ke that marks a RC shows some idiosyncratic behavior when it enters into certain clitic sequences. Notably it is deleted when it precedes a postpositional enclitic marker. This is discussed under §20.2.
There is a wide range of options for expressing the CA (Common Argument): (1) in the MC (Main Clause) but not the RC, (2) in the RC but not the MC and (3) neither in the MC nor the RC. This is discussed under §20.3.
The CA can have any function within the MC. Within the RC, there are tendencies — but no absolute requirements — for the CA to be in non-A function within the RC. This is discussed under §20.4.
The main function of relative clauses in Cavineña is to modify the head of an NP. But relative clauses in Cavineña are also used with an adverbial meaning, in which case they rather modify the predicate of a controlling clause. This is discussed under §20.5.
Relative clauses show tendencies to grammaticalise into finite adverbial clauses. This is the topic of §20.6.
20.1. Structure of a relative clause (RC) 20.1.1. Finiteness Similarily to finite adverbial clauses (see Chapter 19), a (verbal) relative clause (RC) has a finite verb (i.e. a verb inflected with a TAM marker) and a marker of dependency,

772 =ke ‘LIGature’.

In (20.1a) the RC verb is inflected with the remote past -kware ‘REM.PAST’ while in (20.1b) it is inflected with the potential circumfix marker e-…-u ‘POT’:

(20.1) a. [Ai bakani]CC =tuCS

ju-kware

INT name =3SG(-FM) be-REM.PAST

[pushi ekwita [[makeiO iye=ra]

kwa-kware=ke]RC]CS?

four person enemies kill=PURP.MOT go-REM.PAST=LIG

‘What is the name of the four men (lit. persons) who went to kill the enemies?’ mk098

b. … [beta wekaka] iwa-kware

[kamion=kwana e-kueti-u=keRC]O.

two day

wait.for-REM.PAST truck=PL

POT-pass-POT=LIG

‘… we waited two days for trucks that could possibly pass (and give us a ride to Riberalta).’ ga014

The verb of a RC can take the full range of TAM (but not imperative, hortative and jussive) inflectional markers. Examples showing other inflectional markers are (20.6a) (-wa ‘PERF’), (20.6b) (-chine ‘REC.PAST’), (20.6c) (-ya ‘IMPFV’).
Similarly to finite adverbial clauses, the verb of a RC can also take any non-finite verbal affix. See for example -ti ‘GO.TEMP’ in (20.18), -aje ‘INCR’ in (20.29), both -diru ‘GO.PERM’ and -bare ‘DISTR’ in (20.28d), -sha ‘CAUS.ITR’ in (20.30a), k(a)-…-ti ‘REF’ in (20.38), etc.
Similarity to adverbial clauses, the verb (inflecting verb, auxiliary verb or copula verb) of an RC obligatorily comes last in the clause. If there is no verb, then the copula complement comes last (see §20.1.2).
Similarly to finite adverbial clauses, RC do not take first or second position particles. This means that RC do not have bound pronouns. On the other hand, any other main clause constituents (NP, independent pronoun, PP, independent particle, adverbial clause, etc.) can occur in an RC and receive the exact same coding. See for example

773 NPs in A function juye=ra in (20.22c), in S function makina ‘machine’ in (20.24a), independent pronoun in O function ike ‘1SG’ in (20.18), independent pronoun in A function tura ‘3SG.ERG’ in (20.29), independent particles beru in (20.3) and iyaja=kwita in (20.24a), non-finite purpose of motion clause makei iye=ra ‘to kill enemies’ in (20.1a), etc.

20.1.2. Copula RC In copula relative clauses, the copula verb is typically — but not obligatorily — omitted. (This is parallel to what happens with copula main clauses; see §4.6.3.)

As a result, the ligature marker =ke attaches to the copula complement which — as result of omission of the copula verb — comes last in the RC. This is illustrated in (20.2).

‘Finally, I found a hard stick (to finish killing the deer that I had shot).’ sl057

When not omitted, the copula verb must be inflected with a TAM marker, as shown in (20.3) (a volunteered example by Alfredo). (This is again parallel to what happens with copula main clauses; see §4.6.3.)

Copula RCs are extremely frequent. Example (20.2) illustrated Copula RCs with adjectives in CC. In (20.4), we illustrate copula RCs based on other types of CC: NP (in a.), postpositional phrase (in b.), locative pro-form (in c.) (see also (20.11)), independent particles (in d. and e.):

20.2. Ligature marker =ke The ligature marker =ke (the RC marker) presents a number of idiosyncratic properties when it comes into a sequence with other enclitics.
20.2.1. Ligature deletion rule Similarly to adverbial clause markers, the relative clause marker =ke ‘LIG’ attaches to the last phonological word of the RC, thus to a verb (lexical verb, auxiliary verb or copula verb) or to a copula complement.
When the CA (Common argument) is not in S or O function (which are unmarked for case) within the MC, the NP formed by the CA and the RC will be marked by a postposition (ergative, genitive, locative, associative, etc.). As we know, most postpositions are enclitics to the last phonological word of the NP (see Chapter 14). We would then expect to have =LIG=PP clitic sequences. But interestingly, this never happens. There is a morphological process of deletion of the ligature =ke morpheme when it occurs in the same clitic sequence with a postposition and when it precedes the postposition.
Deletion of the ligature =ke is shown in (20.6a) (CA in A function within MC), (20.6b) (CA in locative function within MC) and (20.6c) (CA in associative function within

In (20.7), where the CA (‘someone’; omitted within both MC and RC) is a possessor within the MC, the ligature is deleted from a =LIG=GEN underlying sequence:

(20.7)

[Maju-yaRC=ja

basi-daCC.

die-IMPFV(=LIG)=GEN sweat

=3SG(-FM) sticky-ASF

‘The sweat of someone who is dying is very sticky.’ di1418

Note that =ke is omitted even if it is not directly adjacent to a postposition (as long as they belong to the same clitic sequence and the ligature precedes the postposition). This is illustrated in (20.8) where the number clitic =ekatse ‘DL’ occurs between the ligature phrase and a case marker:

(20.8)

777 [Tume eweebari weni-daCC/RC=ekatse=ra]A ara-ya. there adolescent fast-ASF(=LIG)=DL=ERG eat-IMPFV
‘These two courageous (lit. fast) young men were eating it (a raw wild turkey).’ hm091

On the other hand, if the ligature does not belong to a clitic sequence together with a postposition, then the ligature does not drop, as in (20.9) (the ligature and the postposition are in bold face):

(20.9) a. [Arusu=kwana a-wa=ke]O

778

If the postposition makes a separate phonological word (i.e. is not an enclitic), then =ke is retained, as with jiteke ‘LOOKING.FOR’ (in (20.10a) and tupuju ‘FOLLOWING’ (in (20.10b), etc:

‘… he (my grandfather’s friend) went behind the ones (howler monkeys) that were escaping (trying to kill them).’ ts018

If the ligature =ke follows (as opposed to precede) an enclitic postposition, it is not deleted. This happens when a postpositional phrase in CC function is made of a copula RC as in (20.11):

(20.11)

20.2.2. Ligature and plural marker Cavineña has three number markers which function within NPs (=kwana ‘PL’, =ekana ‘PL’ and =ekatse ‘DL’). These markers are enclitics to the head noun of the NP or to an NP modifier (see §13.3).
When the plural number marker =kwana ‘PL’ attaches to a RC (as normally happens when the NP head is ellipsed; see §13.3.1), the order is =PL=LIG (not the expected order

779 =LIG=PL), as shown in (20.12):

(See also CIRABO=ju=kwana=ke ‘us from CIRABO’ at (T1.56).)

Note that with the dual marker =ekatse, the order is =LIG=DL as expected (and cannot be =DL=LIG), as shown in (20.13) (elicited) and (20.14) (from a text):

(20.13) a. [beta e-marikaka

The plural marker =ekana is limited to kinship nouns. It never occurs on a RC. More work is required to know if =ekana is allowed to mark an RC, and if so, how =ekana would interact with the ligature =ke.

780

20.2.3. Ligature and 3rd person ‘possessor’ inflections
There is are stricking formal and morpho-syntactic similarities between the ligature marker =ke ‘LIG’ and the =ke part of the 3rd person ‘possessor’ inflection e-…=ke ‘3’ found with kinship terms (§12.4): 1 — both are phonologically identical; 2 — both behaves similarly with respect to plural marker =kwana. When =kwana ‘PL’ attaches to a kinship term marked with e-…=ke ‘3’ (i.e. ‘possessed’ by a 3rd person), =kwana precedes =ke, exactly like =kwana ‘PL’ precedes the ligature marker (§20.2.2). As an illustration, see (20.12a,b), (20.15) and (20.16));

(20.15)

3-wife=PL=3

go-IMPFV village=PERL

‘Their wives would go (to meet their husbands that were hunting in the forest) from the village.’ ct037

3 — Cavineña makes us of RCs to code some kinship relations. An example is given in (20.16):

(20.16)

Pasensha=tsewe ba-kwe [[mi-raA ba-ya=kwana=ke]]O! patience=ASSOC see-IMP.SG 2SG-ERG see-IMPFV=PL=LIG
‘Look at your children (lit. the ones who you see/care) with patience.’ n4.0403

Possibly, the similarity in form and behavior (with respect to the plural marker =kwana ‘PL’) is an indication of a common historical origin. This is suggested by the fact that
However, even though the above similarities possibly indicate a common historical origin between =ke ‘LIG’ and =ke ‘3’, there at least two pieces of evidence showing that they are clearly different morphemes synchronically: 1 — unlike =ke ‘LIG’, =ke ‘3’ is not deleted when it occurs in the same clitic sequence with a postposition (see ligature deletion rule at §20.2.1 above). As an illustration, compare (20.6a,b,c) with (20.17):

781

(20.17) E-wane=ke=raA amena ba-ti-kware

tu-keO.

3-wife=3=ERG FILL

see-GO.TEMP-REM.PAST 3SG-FM

‘His wife went to see him.’ mu041

2 — semantically =ke ‘3’ (in conjunction with a prefix e-) encodes the person of the ‘possessor’ whereas =ke ‘LIG’ is a relative clause marker, regardless of the person of the possessor of the NP head it qualifies (if any).

20.3. Statement of common argument (CA) Cavineña is a language where the CA can be stated either within the MC or the RC (but never within both) or not stated at all. There are no clear semantic differences between the two alternatives.
Three tests have been used to decide where the CA belongs in a particular example: 1 — constituency: when the CA and the RC form separate constituents, then the CA belongs to the MC. When the CA occurs between constituents that clearly belong to the RC (as opposed to the MC), then the CA belongs to the RC.
2 — nature of the CA: if the CA is a (free) pronoun, then it must belong to the RC. This is so because pronouns cannot be modified in Cavineña. As a result it is not possible to have an NP with its head as a pronoun and an RC as a modifier.
3 — case marking of the CA: hen the function of the CA within the MC is different from its function within the RC and if both functions are marked differently, the case assigned to the CA indicates where it belongs.

20.3.1. CA in MC not in RC The CA can be stated within the MC but not within the RC in which case we have an externally headed relative clause.
In the following two examples case marking of the CA proves that the CA belongs to the MC.

782

In (20.18) and (20.19), the CAs bina ‘bat’ and Rosa, respectively, are in S function within the MC and in A function within the RC. As we can see, bina ‘bat’ and Rosa are unmarked for case. This correlates with their S function within the MC but not with their A function within the RC (recall that A function requires overt ergative marking). This shows that both bina and Rosa belong to the MC but not to the RC.

In (20.20), the CA kani ‘hole’ is in O function within the MC and in LOC function within the RC. The CA is unmarked, accordingly to its O (absolutive) function but not accordingly to its LOC function (which would be marked by =ju or some related postposition). The CA thus belongs to the MC, not to the RC.

In (20.21), the CA, banekware ‘upland terrain’ is in O function within the MC and in locative function within the RC. As we can see, banekware is unmarked correlating with its O function within the MC but not its locative function within the RC (locative function would be marked by =ju):

In the following examples, constituency proves that the CA belongs to the MC.

In (20.22), the CA is separated form the RC by a MC constituent. As a result, the CA must belong to the MC:

784

In (20.23), the stated CA is postposed to the RC verb. Since, as we said, the verb in an RC obligatorily comes last, the CA must belong to the MC.

Note that the position of the RC vis a vis a CA stated externally is not rigid. The most common situation is for the RC to directly follow the CA (as in (20.18), (20.20) and (20.21)). But it can as well directly precede it (as in (20.23a-d)) or be discontinuous (as in (20.22a-c)).

785

20.3.2. CA in RC not in MC The CA can be stated within the RC but not within the MC in which case we have an internally headed RC.

In (20.24), evidence for the CA belonging to the RC comes from the fact that the CA occurs between constituents that belong to the RC (not to the MC) (the CA is in bold):

In (20.26), in addition to being expressed by pronouns (which is a sufficient criteria for the CA to belong to the RC), the CA is cased marked according to its function within the RC (locative in a., reason in b.) but not according to its function within the MC (E — i.e, extended argument — in a., O in b.). Moreover, in a., the CA occurs within RC constituents while in b., the CA forms a constituent together with RC constituents with respect to positioning of 2nd position clitics.

20.3.4. Ambiguity In many cases, it is just impossible to decide whether CA belongs to the MC or the RC.

In (20.29), for example, none of the tests provide any clue to which MC or RC the CA belongs to. The CA jae ‘fish’ is an O both within the MC and the RC. The CA is a noun (not a pronoun). Finally, the CA and does not occur between MC or RC constituents:

Similar situations are found with (20.1a) (CA is CS within MC and S within RC, both unmarked for case) and (20.1b) (CA is O within MC and S within RC, both unmarked for case).

20.4. CA functions in MC and in RC
There are no restrictions whatsoever as to which function the CA can play within the MC. Within the RC, there are strong tendencies — but apparently no strict restrictions — for the CA to be in non-A functions and non-genitive functions (no examples have been found with the CA in genitive function within the RC but there are no reasons why this could not be possible.)

790 This observation corroborates Keenan and Comrie (1977)’s ‘NP accessibility hierarchy’ which states that possessors are the least relativisable of all grammatical functions. However, it does not fully corroborate their statement that subjects are more relativisable than other functions (notably objects). In Cavineña, S and O appear to be more relativisable than A. What would better account for the facts of Cavineña relativisation is an ergative-type hierarchy (i.e. S/O > A > etc. rather than Subject > Object > etc.) as proposed by Dixon (1994: 130) for languages (e.g., Dyirbal, Australian) which are similar to Cavineña in this respect.

Table 20.1 summarises all combinations attested in the data and corresponding examples (S and CS arguments — which behave in all respects similarly in Cavineña — have been lumped together under the lable S).

20.5. RC functions 20.5.1. Restrictive RC Cavineña RCs can have a restrictive function. In this case the function of the RC is to help identify a unique referent among a choice of possible referents. Example of restrictive RCs are at (20.1a), (20.22a,b), (20.23a) and (20.24c).

20.5.2. Non-restrictive RC
Cavineña RCs can also have a non-restrictive function. In this case, the CA already has unique reference and the RC simply provides additional information on that referent. Examples of non-restrictive RCs are at ((20.1b), (20.25a) and (20.25b).

Non-restrictive RC often have adverbial meanings (they sometimes can only be translated by adverbial clauses in English) as in (20.30) (note that (20.30b) is (T1.28)):

20.5.3. ‘Tail-head’ linkage
Non-restricted RC can be used to repeat information for discourse coherence. Typically, the RC repeats the main predicate of the immediately preceding sentence. We already saw that this discourse function — called ‘tail-head’ or ‘lexical overlap’ in the literature (Thompson and Longacre, 1985: 209 ff.) — is also performed by SS-temporal clauses (see §18.2) and DS-temporal clauses (see §19.2.2).

A sequence of two sentences with repetition of the information by a RC is shown in (20.31). (The repeated information is in bold.)

793 In (20.32), we show how RC repeat information between three sentences. The first and the second sentences are separated by 2 intervening sentences (which provide side comments). The second and the third sentences follow one another.

In (20.33), the CA of the RC that repeats the preceding sentence predicate is in A function within the MC:

In (20.34), the CA of the RC that repeats the preceding sentence predicate is in O

‘An oxi went to drink, one ox. As hei was going to drink, the cayman talked to himi (lit. the cayman talked to himi whoi saw going to drink).’ cd027-028

As we said ‘tail-head’ linkage is also a function of SS-temporal clauses (see §18.2) and DS-temporal clauses (see §19.2.2). SS-temporal clauses and DS-temporal clauses have a complementary function and are used in complementary distribution (SStemporal clauses are used when their subject co-referential with the subject of the MC while DS-temporal clauses are used when their subject is different from the subject of the MC). It is not clear how RCs with a ‘tail-head’ linkage function fit into this pattern. Basically, for ‘tail-head’ linkage function, an RC whose subject (S or A) is coreferential with the subject of the MC (S or A) could be substituted by an SS-temporal clause. And an RC whose subject (S or A) is non-co-referential with the subject (S or A) of the MC could be substituted with a DS-temporal clause. More work is required on this topic.

20.6. Grammaticalisation of RCs into adverbial clauses 20.6.1. RC relating to core argument There are grounds to believe that RC with adverbial meanings are developing into independent adverbial clauses.
Occasionally speakers do not use ergative marking with RCs whose CA is in A function within the MC. This happens in (20.35) below (from a text by Francisco Vaca). Here there are two RCs with adverbial meanings. In both cases the CA in S function within the RC: ‘as I was going’ and ‘as they were passing by’. The second RC is in O

795 function within the MC and it is appropriately unmarked for case. The first RC, on the other hand, is in A function within the MC. But as we can see it is similarly unmarked whereas it should have received ergative marking (as in (20.30b) or (20.30c) above).

[waburu kueti-ya=ke]O. peccary pass-IMPFV=LIG
‘As I was going (lit. I who was going), I could hear peccaries as they were passing by.’ ch004

In some examples, the CA can be a full pronoun outside of the RC (recall that a CA can only be coded by a pronoun within a RC; see §20.3). This can be see in (20.36) for example.

(20.36)

chaiO.

field=LOC come-IMPFV=LIG 1SG-ERG see-COME.TEMP-PERF bird

‘Coming from the field (lit. I who was coming…), I saw a bird.’ di0993

Note that in this example, similarly to (20.35), the RC does not receive the expected ergative marking corresponding to the A function of the CA within the MC.

With RCs with adverbial meanings, there are cases where there is not, strictly speaking, a CA between the RC and the MC or where the CA is quite unclear.

In (20.37), juye ‘an ox’ is the S referent within MC but is (at best) only part of the S referent within RC (which also includes ‘us’ and the other ox).

796

In (20.38), both the A or O arguments can be the CA since both the A argument (‘you’) and the O argument (‘your children’) are crossing the river:

20.6.2. RC vs. DS-temporal clauses
It is observed in §19.2 that the DS-temporal clause marker =ju ‘DS’ is homophonous with the locative postposition =ju ‘LOC’. It is also noted in §20.1.1 that RCs in Cavineña are structurally similar to finite adverbial clauses and in §20.5.2 that RCs can have adverbial meanings. One might want to analyse DS-temporal clauses as relative clauses within locative phrases .

The differences between the two types of constructions and the rationale for analysing them as distinct are as follows. 1 — DS-temporal clauses have the requirement that their subject (S or A) be different from the subject (S or A) of the controlling clause. RCs do not have this requirement. In the RC contruction in (20.28a) (repeated below), the CA is in LOC function within the MC (corresponding to DS-temporal clause situation) (and LOC function within the MC) and with the subject of the RC (‘I’) co-referential with the subject of the MC:

iye-waRC=ju=kwita]. kill-PERF(=LIG)=LOC=RESTR

‘I arrived (lit. emerged) exaclty where I had killed the coati.’ pe026

2 — semantically, RCs within locative postpositional phrases always have spatial

797 meanings. DS-temporal clauses on the other hand always have temporal meanings.
3 — the full range of TAM verbal inflectional affixes is attested in RCs within locative postpositional phrases (see §20.1.1)). Verbs of DS-temporal clauses, on the other hand, only take aspectual -wa ‘PERF’ and -ya ‘IMPFV’ and modal e-…-u ‘POT’.
4 — In terms of frequency, RCs within locative postpositional phrases are rather rare. A total of 48 examples are available in the total corpus of texts (21 examples in our own corpus of recordings, 4 in our own corpus of written texts, 23 in the corpus of SIL published texts).
DS-temporal clauses, on the other hand are extremely frequent. In a single text like T1 for example, there are 19 such clauses out of 153 sentences (12.5 %).
These four pieces of evidence strongly suggest that RCs within locative postpositional phrases and DS-temporal clauses be treated synchronically as different constructions. On historical grounds, however, it is most likely that the second has evolved from the first, in the face of their structural and semantic similarities.

Text 1 — When the Araonas became angry with each other
This text was recorded from Alfredo Tavo in the town of Riberalta on 24 May 2001. Alfredo relates his visit in 1995 to the village of the Araona people while he was a leader of the local indigenous organisation CIRABO (Central Indígena de la Región Amazónica de BOlivia). The story runs for 13 min 20 sec. It was transcribed and translated with Alfredo himself.
