This dissertation would have not been possible without the guidance and help of several people. My first thanks go to the Paresi people, especially those who worked with me during these seven years of field work (most of them in Formoso and in Rio Verde communities): caciques Nelsinho Zoizomae, Justino Zomozokae, João Titi, Fernando Omoizokie, Nair Zonizokaero, João Arrezomae, and Carlito Okenazokie; Agostinha Zoloizokaero, Zilda Kezokaero, Geovani Kezokenaece, Genivaldo Zezokaece, Jurandir Zezokiware, Wagner Noezonazokemae, Edivaldo Nezokemaece, Elizabeth Akezomaialo, Jocelio Onizokaece, Joãozinho Akanoizokae, Nilce Zonizokemairo, Rony Paresi, Angelo Kezomae, and Tarsila Konizokero.
I also would like to thank my committee members, Nora England, Anthony Woodbury, Lev Michael, and Sidi Facundes. Special thanks goes to my supervisor Patience Epps, who read many versions of this work, giving insights and helpful comments. Her encouragement and support were very important to me during the writing process. Thanks also to Françoise Rose and Scott Myers who gave comments on parts of this grammar. Ryan Sullivant, Leah Geer, Kyle Jerro, and Adam Tallman also helped me with proofreading. I also acknowledge the assistance of the staff of the Department of Linguistics, especially Benjamin Rapstine, and Leslie Crooks.
In Belém, I am grateful to have had the support of the Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi, with special thanks to Denny Moore, Vilacy Galucio, Hein van der Voot, Geiva Picanço, Rose Costa, and Ellison Cleyton.

A reference grammar of Paresi-Haliti (Arawak)
Ana Paula Barros Brandão, Ph.D. The University of Texas at Austin, 2014
Supervisor: Patience Epps
This dissertation is a description of the grammar of Paresi. The Paresi people live in the State of Mato Grosso, near the city of Cuiabá. Paresi belongs to the Arawak family, and it is classified in a branch called Paresi-Xingu (Aikhenvald, 1999; Ramirez, 2001). This language is spoken by approximately 2000 speakers. The data for this thesis were collected mostly in the Formoso area.
In this dissertation, I expand on the work of Rowan (1969, 1978, among other works), Silva (2009), and on my own work conducted in my Master's report (Brandão, 2010) in order to provide a comprehensive analysis of aspects of phonology, morphology, and syntax. The grammar is presented in eight chapters and an appendix with text samples. The first chapter includes general information about the speakers and the language. The second chapter describes the sound system. The segmental phonology is simple, with morphophonemic alternations on some roots and morphemes. The third chapter describes the closed words classes (pronouns, demonstratives, indefinites, numerals, quantifiers, postpositions, adverbs, interjections and ideophones). The fourth chapter examines nouns and the structure of noun phrases. The fifth and sixth chapters are descriptions of verb classes, valency, tense, aspect and modality. Verb roots can be intransitive, transitive, or ditransitive. There are three mechanisms to decrease valency and six mechanisms to increase valency. Paresi expresses time through tense, aspect, and temporal adverbs. It also distinguishes three modalities. The seventh chapter is about simple clauses and negation. In this chapter, evidence is presented for describing Paresi as an OV language.

Finally, the eighth chapter, on clause combining, describes coordination and the three types of subordination: relative clauses, complementation and adverbial clauses. Grounded primarily in “basic linguistic theory”, this dissertation uses a FunctionalTypological linguistic framework, informed by discussions about particular phenomena in the general linguistics literature.

Chapter 1 - Introduction
1.0 Introduction In this section, I present background information about the Paresi speakers, their
society and their language. This socio-cultural description is based on previous literature about the Paresi people and on my own observations during various visits to the Paresi communities.
The Paresi number around 2000 persons (Siasi/Sesai, 20121), approximately 1800 of whom speak Paresi. The Paresi speakers constitute approximately 90% of this population. They live in the State of Mato Grosso (the circled area in Figure 1), approximately 500 km northwest of the city of Cuiabá, in the region of the tributaries of the Juruena, a branch of the Tapajós river. They inhabit the dry and sandy ridges of their landscape, which is a savannah cut through with rivers. There are nine non-contiguous Paresi indigenous territories2 (Portuguese: Terras Indígenas): Rio Formoso, Utiariti, Estação Parecis, Estivadinho, Pareci, Juininha, Figueira, Ponte de Pedra, and Uirapuru. Paresi3 (and its variants Parecís or Pareci) is the term used to refer to the Haliti people (as they call themselves). The terms “Paresi-Haliti” or “Haliti-Paresi” are used by some Paresi speakers to refer to the language they speak. I will use the term “Paresi” to refer to both the language and the people. The information provided in this dissertation was gathered during many field trips to three indigenous territories: Rio Formoso, Pareci, and Utiariti.
1 Information accessed at: http://pib.socioambiental.org/pt/povo/paresi 2 Indigenous territories are areas inhabited and possessed by indigenous people through a formal process
of demarcation by the Brazil government. 3 The origin of the term “Paresi” is unknown. The term was used for the first time by Antonio Pires
Campos in the 18th century.

There are around 146 Paresi people in the Rio Formoso territory, which includes the villages of Formoso (Hohako), JM (Korehete), Cachoeirinha (Wamolotse), Jatobá, and Queimada (Koteroko). I gathered most of my data in Formoso, Cachoeirinha, and JM. The territory is located approximately 82 km, or 2 hours by car, from the nearest city, Tangará da Serra. Approximately 50-70 Paresi people live in Formoso and Queimada; while Jatobá has around 30 people, and Cachoeirinha six.
Based on information from ISA, in the eleven villages of the Paresi territory there are around 838 people. I have visited the Rio Verde (Batsaji), Manene, and Kotitiko villages. In the Utiariti territory there are 6 villages, around 250 people. In this territory, I only visited the Bacaval village.
1.1 Linguistic profile of Paresi In this section I present a set of Paresi grammar highlights that show what is
particularly interesting and significant about the language. I introduce each phenomenon and situate it in its wider grammatical context. Paresi has 14 consonants and four vowels. Stress is generally not contrastive, and stress assignment depends on syllable weight and number. There are morphophonological processes such as palatalization, coronalization and vowel harmony occurring within morphemes and across morpheme boundaries. The syllable structure is (C)V(V).
Paresi morphology is polysynthetic, head-marking and agglutinative, like other Arawak languages. Its morphology consists of several morphemes with clear-cut boundaries (i.e. there no fused formatives) and some allomorphic variation. Open word classes include nouns and verbs. Closed classes are pronouns, demonstratives, indefinites, numerals, quantifiers, postpositions, adjectives, adverbs, interjections, and ideophones. Verbs, nouns, and postpositions inflect for person. Person marking on the verb is generally determined by the semantic feature of control; agentive verbs take one set of personal clitics and non-agentive verbs take another.
Nominal categories in Paresi are number, classifiers, and nominal tense. Gender is a feature that has been lost; however vestiges can be found only in nominalizations.
4

Paresi distinguishes singular and plural number on nouns by marking the plural with the suffix -nae. Most of the verb morphology consists of suffixes, with only a few prefixes. Verb roots can be intransitive, transitive, or ditransitive. There are three mechanisms to decrease valency: middle voice, reflexive, and reciprocal constructions; and three mechanisms to increase valency: two morphological causatives and one periphrastic causative construction. Similar to most Arawak languages, Paresi distinguishes transitional, imperfective, regressive, and iterative aspects in nonnegative constructions. Paresi exhibits realis/irrealis distinction in the future tense, and a rich modal system, including frustrative, dubitative, irrealis, and desiderative moods.
The syntax of simple and complex clauses were the least studied parts of the Paresi grammar in previous works (Rowan & Burgess, 1969; Derbyshire, 1986; Silva, 2013; for more details see §1.3). Though constituent order is relatively flexible in Paresi (provided the verb does not come first), there is strong evidence from text frequency and interpretation of ambiguous sentences that the default order is SOV. Complex clauses include three types of subordination strategies: nominalization, juxtaposition, and the use of subordinators. The nominalization strategy is used for relative clauses, complement relations, and some adverbial clauses.
Among the typologically interesting aspects of Paresi grammar are its nominal classification system, which exhibits multiple classifiers, similar to other Amazonian languages (see §4.5); the incorporation of postpositions (§5.3.3.3), which may be evidence that postpositions are sources of valency affixes such as applicatives in some Arawak languages (Danielsen, 2011); and nominalization with the suffix -re which occurs in lexical (§4.6) and clause nominalizations with different functions (§8.2).
1.2 Genetic affiliation Aikhenvald (2012:32) considers the Arawak family the largest and most
widespread in South America, with some 40 languages (Aikhenvald, 1999; Ramirez, 2001). Modern comparative studies on Arawak are Payne (1991); Aikhenvald (1999), Ramirez (2001); and Facundes & Brandão (2011). The first three have presented a largely
5

similar classification while the last one is a comparison of these works, which points out differences with regard to the internal classification of the groups. Each of these proposals will be considered in turn.
Payne's classification (1991) was based on lexical retention (see classification in Table 1). In this work, 203 items were reconstructed for Proto-Maipuran, an alternative term for Arawak, making use of 24 Arawak languages from all the main branches of the family. Payne then classified these languages into five groups: Western, Central, Southern, Eastern, and Northern, placing Waurá and Paresi in a Central branch because they share the highest number of cognate pairs (out of the whole set).
Aikhenvald (1999) classified all Arawak languages according to their geographic distribution and grouped them into fourteen groups forming two main divisions within Arawak. divided Arawak into two large groups: South and South-western Arawak(with six branches) and North-Arawak (eight branches). She placed Paresi in the South & Southwestern, in a branch called Paresi-Xingu with two subgroups: Xingu and ParesiSaraveca. She also grouped Enawenê-nawê in the South Arawak branch, but she did so without presenting the data justifying such classification.
Ramirez's classification of 47 Arawak languages (2001) was similar to Payne's (1991) in that it was also based on lexical retention, not geographic proximity. He classified the family into Occidental (with eight branches) and Oriental (with two branches), and grouped Paresi in the Paresi-Xingu branch, in agreement with Aikhenvald (1999). All classifications were preliminary works without evidence from innovations.
Michael (2009) in his review about Ramirez's work has argued that classifications based solely on shared lexical retentions are not reliable, and suggests that future classifications of Arawak should rely on the comparative method for more sound results.
More recent work focusing on the Paresi-Xingu branch (Fabre, 2005; Brandão & Facundes, 2007) places Enawenê-nawê4 in the same branch as Paresi. Brandão & Facundes (2007) consider Paresi and Enawenê-nawê to form a subgroup since they
4 Enawenê-nawê is spoken by some 570 people on the margins of the Iquê river in the Juruema Basin, and in Mato Grosso.
6

appear to show many cognate pairs. However, since Enawenê-nawê has received limited scholarly attention (Rezende, 2003) this assertion is tentative and more work based on the comparative method needs to be done to cleave Paresi and Enawenê-nawê together in a subgroup to the exclusion of the other Arawak languages in the Xingu territory.

1.3 Previous linguistic studies of Paresi To date, there has been some documentation of Paresi: a sketch grammar (Rowan
& Burgess, 1969 [2009]), a preliminary dictionary based on the variety spoken in the Utiariti area (Rowan & Rowan, 1978 [2001]), other works on phonology by missionaries of SIL (Rowan, 1961, 1963, 1964a, 1964b, 1967, 1972, 1977), and text collections (Rowan, 1983; Rowan & Rowan, 1993, 1994, 1995; Rowan, 1993). Other works on phonology include those by Drude (1995) and Silva (2009). My work on the language includes research on descriptive words (Brandão, 2009), on verb morphology (2010), on causatives (Brandão, forthcoming), and on negation (Brandão, forthcoming), as well as documentary materials. A more recent description is a dissertation on the morphosyntax by Silva (2013). There are also works by Paresi speakers, including undergraduate theses by students in the Licenciatura Indígena Intercultural (Intercultural Indigenous Program, which is equivalent to a US bachelor's degree) at the State University of Mato Grosso (UNEMAT) and other pedagogical materials (Paresi & Januário, 2011)
I will give a brief overview of the main works. Rowan and Burgess (1969) provide a preliminary grammatical description that includes some aspects of discourse, clause, and word structures, in the tagmemic framework. The grammar is not comprehensive, nor does it provide enough examples. Most of the grammar consists of descriptions of forms without information about their use or frequency. Drude (1995) describes the phonetics and phonology of the Waimaré dialect, and Silva (2009) provides a preliminary phonetic and phonological description of the major variants of Paresi based on the Feature Geometry approach. Brandão (2010) gives a preliminary analysis of verbal morphology, including descriptions of verb classes, valency changing mechanisms, tense, aspect, modality, and negation.
Silva (2013) is divided into twelve chapters (not including introduction and conclusion) with three appendices, including a collection of photos, a text, and a preliminary lexicon. He provides an overview of the phonology, and discusses word classes, functional morphemes related to negation, aspect, and mood (TAM). He also
9

gives some preliminary analyses of the syntax; word order constituency, negation, TAM, types of clauses, and subordinate clauses are addressed. The last chapter provides a formal essay following the minimalism program (Chomsky, 2000).
In this grammar I provide a more thorough treatment of syntax beyond Silva's focus on open and closed classes. Throughout this work, new data will be introduced which do not support some of Silva's analyses. Different analyses were made in this work such as analyses of alienable nouns (§4.3.2), adjectives (which I call classifiers, see §4.5), the suffix -oa (§5.3.1.1), TAM suffixes (chapter 6), and constituent order (§7.2.1). Some topics presented here that were not included in his work are coordination and the use of nominalization in all types of subordinate clauses.
1.4 Language variation Silva (2009) describes two dialectal variants which he calls the minority and
majority variants. These variants may be associated with the different social groups of Paresi people. This dissertation describes the Paresi variety spoken by the people in the Rio Formoso area, who speak the majority variety.
Paresi is divided up into six social groups: Waimaré, Kaxiniti, Kozarene, Enomaniere, Warere, and Kawali. In the literature and among the Paresi, the majority variety is related to the Kozarene group while the minority is related to the Waimaré group. However, nowadays the intermarriage of speakers of different groups confounds an easy separation of the speakers into neat dialect groups. Therefore the phonological and lexical variation in the two dialects is no longer related to social grouping, but may be related to geographic distribution (the minority variety is spoken in the Bacaval village, while the majority variety is spoken in the other villages). For more information about the minority variety see Silva (2009) and (Drude, 1995).
Approximately half a dozen or fewer speak the minority variety (only elders are fluent). The Waimaré people live in the Bacaval village, but there are a few people who speak the minority variety (they have higher proficiency in the majority variety). The first language of Waimaré people is Portuguese, and the minority variety is not used in the
10

everyday life. Some speakers say there is a third variety, the variety spoken by the Kaxiniti people, which is almost extinct, with only one or two speakers remaining (but I have not contacted these people).
It is also interesting to notice a special register, with specialized vocabulary (mostly animal names) used only in formal speech events (Kezomae, 2006). Some examples are the words: menetse and anakitxihore 'anaconda'; the first name is a common name, and the second one is used only in rituals. This variation may also be associated to the age of the speakers as the younger generations are no longer learning this vocabulary.
1.5 Cultural context In this section, I give a brief overview of some aspects of Paresi culture. Part of the information presented is from the ethnographic study by Costa (1985), one of the principal ethnographical contributions on the Paresi, and from my own experiences in the field. Other important ethnographic, anthropological, and historical works dedicated to the Paresi people are Schmidt (1914, 1943), Métraux (1948), Machado (1994), Bortoletto (1999), Gonçalves (2000), Canova (2003), and Barbio (2005). From the end of the 18th century there are references to the Paresi people in documents by Portuguese colonizers. Since this period, the contact with non-indigenous people was intense and led to a great socio-cultural impact on the Paresi society. The language Paresi is most in contact with is Brazilian Portuguese. The first mention of the Paresi people was by Pires Campos, a scout who went to the savanna Chapadão dos Parecis in 1718 in order to capture indigenous people, most likely Kaxiniti Parecis. Campos also met some Indians of the subgroup Waimaré in the northern area of this region. From 1731 until the end of the 19th century, the Paresi people were enslaved to work the mines of Mato Grosso. In 1884, with a rubber boom, many Paresi people were forcibly exploited by rubber tappers as guides. Because of the high concentration of rubber trees along the rivers where they lived, many Paresi were expelled from their territories. By the 20th century, the Paresi population was almost extinguished by to exploitation as labor for
11

mining and rubber tapping. Most of the documents from this period come from the 1907 Relatórios da
Comissão Rondon. Early in the 20th century, a commission led by Cândido Mariano da Silva Rondon contacted the Paresi. Colonel Marechal Rondon, who was later the founder of the Indian Protection Service, was responsible for the laying of a telegraphic line west from Cuiabá. He convinced some Paresi to live near the telegraphic lines and to go to the schools and work for him. Later on, the lines were abandoned. Several other contacts followed by missionaries and government organizations such as Serviço de Proteção ao Índio (SPI), and the Fundação Nacional do Índio (FUNAI).
From 1946 until 1973, the missionaries belonging to the Anchieta congregation had control of the Utiariti area. They constructed boarding schools where children were prohibited to speak their native languages. In 1960, a couple of missionaries from the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) came to live in one of the villages. Rowan and Burgess (1969) said that the Paresi group was made of 450 people at that time.
The Paresi inhabitants were divided in at least three subgroups: Kashíniti (Kaxiniti), Waimaré, and Korázini (Kozarene) (Métraux, 1948). According to information from elders in the villages there were three more subgroups: Enomaniere, Warere and Káwali. These subgroups were in separate territories but after 1930, the disruptions and relocations following contact with Brazilian society collapsed any former territorial distinctions. The first Paresi subgroups to be in contact with non-Indians were the Waimaré and the Kaxiniti. The Utiariti area, where there are some Waimaré people, was controlled by the Anchieta missionaries from 1946 through 1973. Many Kaxiniti and Waimaré people were taken as slaves, and others were forced to live in the Catholic schools by missionaries.
Costa (1985) stated that the Paresi subgroups autoclassify themselves according to how they maintain their culture. The Kozarene people maintain the traditional practices such as making chicha (a traditional beer), beiju (a type of flat bread), and using traditional adornments (cocar 'adornment made of feathers to put on the head', xiriba 'a
12

traditional skirt made of cotton') in specific situations; in addition they also speak Paresi. On the other hand, the Waimare people are not considered to be real Paresi Indians by other Paresi people because they do not follow their traditional cultural practices any more, and they speak Portuguese as their first language.
These contacts with non-Indians have produced many changes in Paresi society. Nowadays, the majority of the population identifies as Kozarene subgroups. There are still some Waimaré people in Bacaval, Formoso, and Sacre villages, and very few people identified as Kaxiniti. I was not able to attest the existence of descendents of the Káwali people during my field trips and there is only one family of Warére people.
The Paresi people are organized in autonomous communities. Each of these communities has its own leader, the ezekoahatseti, who is responsible for the organization of socio-economic activities. The cultivation of cassava and hunter-gathering were important economic activities in the past for the Paresi people. Nowadays, they are secondary activities since the introduction of soybeans and cattle ranching.
Since the 1980s, farmers have grown soybeans in fields close to the Paresi areas. The soybean cultivation has expanded into areas belonging to the Paresi people. The Paresi lost part of their territories, and roads were constructed inside of their lands to facilitate the transportation of soybeans. More recently, some Paresi have leased part of their lands to farmers and have gotten involved in soybean cultivation. Another source of social income are the tolls in the roads passing through their lands. Some Paresi people collect the toll and they share the income among all the members in the communities.
1.6 Language contact Orlando Rowan stated that there were few bilingual Paresi people during his visits to the area. More recent information from my fieldwork indicates that the majority of the population is bilingual in Paresi and Portuguese, with Paresi as their first language, though the level of bilingualism varies across communities. In Formoso and Rio Verde, people are more fluent in Paresi than Portuguese, whereas Bacaval is shifting to Portuguese, and there have been efforts to revitalize and maintain Paresi there. There are
13

few cases of inter-ethnic marriage and the number of marriages in which one of the spouses is a non-Indian is increasing (in the Rio Formoso area I know of at least three cases).
According to information I collected in a questionnaire in 2009, the majority of the people in the Formoso area were fluent in Paresi. On the other hand, only some adults and young people were fluent in Portuguese while the children (up to seven years old) and elders were not. However, the proficiency of Portuguese in the Formoso area has increased during the last few years, and now even the children speak Portuguese with fluency.
In general, dominance relation, population sizes, and the degree and duration of bilingualism are some of the relevant factors in a borrowing situation. In the situation of Paresi, only recently has the bilingualism increased. Strong structural linguistic effects have not yet emerged, but they certainly could in the future. Among the five categories of borrowing situations discussed in Thomason and Kaufman (1988), Paresi exhibits casual contact, where there is borrowing of content words for cultural and functional reasons.
1.7 Statement of endangerment The number of extinct languages has been increasing drastically, and about half of the known languages of the world have vanished in the last 500 years (Nettle and Romaine, 2000). Adelaar (2007:99) stated that all the indigenous languages of South and Central America are considered to be endangered (except Paraguayan Guaraní). In Brazil, there are approximately 155 indigenous languages spoken. Of these, 39 are listed as urgently endangered owing to their lack of transmission and low number of speakers (Moore, 2005). Paresi, compared to other Amazonian languages, is not immediately endangered, but it is still threatened by the lack of transmission to future generations, and by its relatively low number of speakers. Although Paresi is mostly used as the everyday language (in conversation, rituals, to tell stories), language shift toward Portuguese is taking place. There are some situations in which the Paresi need to use the dominant language, such as when they have to go to the city to request health services, to
14

receive payments or in other situations. One example of this is that Portuguese has been used in the schools as the language of oral instruction; before only the written Portuguese materials were used.
The exposure to Brazilian culture that Paresi have experienced within the last generation has led to extreme changes in their culture and in linguistic styles and registers, which may be considered as a stage preceding a more profound language endangerment. For example, certain genres of ritual languages such as the shamanic offerings to their deities are known only by a few elders.
One positive aspect of language contact is the implementation of programs for bilingual education. These programs aim for an intercultural bilingualism in which the native language is the first language and both languages are regarded equally. Until 1990, in the Formoso village, all the teachers working at the school were non-Indian people. Since then, the Paresi people have begun training in order to become Paresi teachers. Although the children learn how to write in their language and have classes about their mythology, the schools in the villages still have teaching Portuguese as their main goal. For the Paresi people it is important to be involved in the Brazilian society, and learning Portuguese is an instrument to having more access to information and technology (Paes, 2002).
1.8 Methods and data collection The methodology for collecting and analyzing the Paresi data is based on the traditional methodology of linguistic fieldwork, including best-practice methods of documentation and analysis (such as Simons and Bird, 2003). The data for this grammar was gathered during field trips to the Formoso and Rio Verde villages between 2006 and 2012, totaling 17 months. The longest trips were three to four months in fall of 2011 and summer of 2012. The area in which I did field work is approximately four hours by car from the city of Tangará da Serra. From there to Formoso, it takes approximately two hours by car, and four to five hours to Rio Verde. Most of the times I have gone to these places, the
15

Paresi people have given me a ride. The first few times I went to Formoso (between 2006 and 2008) there was no electricity, so they had to use power generators. On those visits, I had to bring solar panels and car batteries in order to use my equipment. Since 2009, they have had electricity and the people have started to buy many electronic devices such as televisions, DVD players, refrigerators, washing machines, etc.
In my day-to-day life in the villages, I spent at least two hours working with consultants, around six hours working on preparing the elicitation tasks, writing or reading about some topic of my dissertation, or doing backups of my data. In addition, it was important to have daily interaction with people in the community, so I reserved time in the evening to spend with them. I listened to their conversations in Paresi, and tried to practice my speaking. I lived with a family in order to be more immersed in the language. They usually do not work in the manioc fields or go hunting, but they have traditional festivals where they have to do these activities. I had many opportunities to participate in and document activities such as working in the manioc field, gathering fruits in the savanna, fishing with the women, and attending festivals. During one naming festival, they gave me the name Aezokero.
All the Paresi speakers in the villages where I worked have agreed in a written document to allow me to work in their villages. In addition to their agreement, I had authorization from the National Foundation of Indigenous people (FUNAI). I worked with at least two speakers in both communities. In most locations there were interested younger people, most of them teachers at the school. There were also speakers, ages 25 to 90, who have worked with me mainly as storytellers for shorter periods of time, typically less than two hours a day. My returning to the communities more than eight times, and the 'giving back' attitude of the project since the beginning has been essential for creating a trusting working relationship with the speakers. Because of this, I also had free access to their communities.
Data were collected in two ways: (i) recording of natural conversation and storytelling sessions and (ii) direct elicitation. I collected a range of naturally-occurring
16

speech types to transcribe and translate. Some of the Paresi people and I have recorded a variety of discourse forms such as myths, songs, oratory, advice, ritual speech, offering made to deities, and prayers used in particular circumstances and that are known by only a few people elders who are shamans. We recorded speakers in spontaneous conversations to collect words and structures of the language employed in daily communication. Life stories and descriptions of actual events in the village (such as fishing or preparing medicine) have also been important in building a recorded set of diverse genres to inform the grammar.
I have also used direct elicitation based on data gathered from the texts and from questionnaires in order to collect some aspects of the grammar such as paradigms, as well as to collect judgments on the grammaticality and use of possible constructions. For instance, I have used the Lingua Descriptive Studies Questionnaire by Comrie & Smith (1977) to collect general information on syntax such as subordination, and the questionnaire on complement clauses by Hengeveld (2008). I have also collected data on tense and aspect by using the Tense, Aspect, and Mood questionnaire by Dahl (1985). In addition, I have used the Max Planck Institute elicitation materials such as the topological relations (Bowerman & Pederson, 1992), the reciprocity videos (Evans et al., 2004), and the shape classifier task (Seifart, 2003). The elicitation was an ongoing process even when I was not in the field, as there was need for clarification on some items during the writing process. This was done by means of internet or telephone, which are accessible to some of the speakers.
The data have been recorded in digital audio (using a Zoom H4n, a Marantz portable recorder, and a Shure headset microphone) and in digital video (using a digital Sony video camera DCR-SR100, a Canon XA10 HD, and external Seinnheiser microphone). I had access to some equipment from the Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi (MPEG) institution and equipment bought during a project funded by the Endangered Language Documentation Programme (ELDP). The data were transferred, cataloged, edited, and transcribed in collaboration with Paresi speakers.
17

The texts were transcribed in ELAN or Transcriber in order to align the audio with the transcription. I asked my consultants to make the transcriptions in the linguistic programs; consultants who were not familiar with the use of computers transcribed using notebooks and a digital audio player. Consultants who were not comfortable doing the transcription by themselves, either because they were not used to this type of task or have some difficulty working alone, worked with me in sessions repeating each sentence of the text to clarify parts of the recordings that were not intelligible. The recordings were transcribed in the Paresi orthography.5 The free translations to Portuguese were done by Paresi speakers, then I reviewed the Portuguese translations and translated them to English for the grammar.
The lexical database was compiled by lexical extraction from text corpora by using the linguistic database tool FLEx. The entries have information in fields such as lexeme and citation forms, gloss, grammatical information, notes, source, semantic domain, and variants, as seen in Figure 3.
5 The orthography has not yet been standardized. The orthography used in the transcriptions was proposed by teachers in the Rio Verde community, and it is different from the one I am using in the grammar.
18

Figure 3: Lexical entry in FLEx The texts were also analyzed in FLEx, which aids in organizing texts and lexical databases. The analyses have the following: information on morpheme segmentation, gloss, word class, and translation, as shown below in Figure 4.

The training of Paresi speakers in language documentation started in 2011. I trained four speakers during workshops. I trained them by teaching them how to use the recording equipment, what to document, and what ethical issues to consider when recording. Some of them were also trained to transcribe and translate texts in ELAN and to use the video editing program Pinnacle Studio. After the training, most of the recordings were done by Noezonakemae. I accompanied him during his work in three villages: Nova Esperança, Bacaval and Kotitiko. In 2013, Noezonakemae and Zezokiware went to the Goeldi Museum in Belém for more training. Twenty-seven DVDs and six CDs were made during the whole documentation project. Copies of all the DVDs and CDs were given to the communities. Figure 5 shows the cover of a DVD:
Figure 5: DVD documenting a traditional festival
Nowadays, the Paresi people have a good infrastructure for documentation work. Seven people have received training through documentation projects with me or with Silva, who conducted fieldwork from 2007 to 2012. The schools at the communities where I have been, have computer labs, libraries and teachers who have bachelors' degree
20

in linguistics and literature (two teachers in one community and one in another). The Formoso village has the equipment used during the ELDP project. Most of the speakers are conscious of the need to preserve this part of their culture, which is in danger of extinction. They are willing to list all of the discourse genres that local people feel are important to document.
To date, in my Paresi database, I have a total of more than 90 hours of recordings, 12 hours of transcribed and translated texts in ELAN (eight transcribed during the ELDP project), approximately 2500 lexical entries, and five hours of texts interlinearized in FLEx. Text metadata information have been recorded in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (such as the content of the recording, who is participating, etc). The data were organized and archived in the Goeldi Museum and in the Endangered Language Archives (ELAR), and it will be archived also at the Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America (AILLA).
The description of Paresi is theoretically informed, and grounded in “basic linguistic theory” (Dryer 2001, 2006; Dixon 2009, 2012). My analysis is based on my original data, especially texts, using a Functional-Typological linguistic framework and informed by discussions about particular phenomena in the general linguistic literature (e.g. Comrie, 1989; Dryer, 2006; Dixon, 2009; Givón, 2001; Miestamo, 2007; Palmer, 1986).
The examples used in the grammar are from texts (coded with the names of the texts) and elicitations, coded as (E). The abbreviations used in the glossing are listed in page xxiv, and the orthographic conventions used are discussed in §2.7.

Chapter 2 - Phonology

2.0 Introduction
This chapter presents an overview of Paresi phonology, addressing segmental phonology §2.1, palatalization and neutralization §2.2, previous phonological analyses §2.3, syllable types and structure §2.4, prosody §2.5, morphophonemics §2.6, and orthographic conventions §2.7.
2.1 Phonemes In this section I describe vocalic and consonantal segments.

2.1.1 Vowels Paresi has four vowel phonemes, as seen in Table 2. Lengthening and nasalization are marginally contrastive (the vowels are between parentheses), as will be described in §2.1.2.3 .

2.1.2 Vowel allophones and vowel processes

2.1.2.1

Vowel /a/ and its allophones

The low central vowel /a/ has two allophones: [a] and [ɐ]. The reduced vowel [ɐ]

occurs in word-final unstressed syllables while the unreduced vowel occurs elsewhere.

(1)

unreduced and reduced vowels

/a/ /'awo/ ['awʊ] 'emu' /'abali/ [a'bali] 'sieve' /ha'tseɾo/ [ha'tseɾʊ] 'your grandmother'

[ɐ] /'tema/ ['temɐ] 's/he ran' /ha'nama/ [ha'namɐ] 'three' /ka'faka/ [ka'fakɐ] 'yesterday'

The low central vowel /a/ has also an allophone [ɛ] when in a diphthong preceded by a palatalized consonant or palatal consonant, as seen in examples (2a) through (4). There is only one case known where raising occurs outside a diphthong (2). The evidence

23

for considering [ɛ] to be an allophone of /a/ and not of /e/ comes from the verbs in (3) and

(4). The verbs waiya 'see' and waini 'die' have the vowel /a/ in their roots, which changes

to [ɛ] when the consonant /w/ becomes palatal or is palatalized.

b. /no=waini-hena/ [nowainihena] 'you are going to die'

1sg=die-TRS

2.1.2.2

Vowel /o/ and its allophones

The vowel /o/ has three allophones: [o], [u] and [ʊ]. [ʊ] occurs in unstressed final

syllables, as shown in (5).

(5)

unreduced and reduced vowels

/o/ /kaloɾe/ [kalo'ɾe] 'big' /tota/ ['tota] 'flat' /toloko/ [to'lokʊ] 'whole'

[ʊ] /tseko/ ['tsekʊ] 'far away' /kalo/ ['kalʊ] 'scarlet macaw' /hito/ ['hitʊ] 'bow'

[u] occurs when the following vowel is [i] or [u]6, when adjacent to a palatalized
6 There may be few exceptions, for example /onore/ [unuɾe] 'heron'.
24

consonant, or when in a final stressed syllable, [o] occurs elsewhere. Inside the root,

regressive assimilation occurs when the vowel assimilates the high feature of the

following vowel or palatal consonant, as shown in (6):

(6)

[u]

a. /owi/ ['uwi] 'snake'

b. /tʲotʲa/ ['tʲutʲɐ] 'all'

c. /ohiro/ [uhi'dʲu] 'woman'

d. /tʲoka/ ['tʲukɐ] 'he sat'

(7)

[o]

a. /toka/ ['tokɐ] 'he grabbed'

b. /one/['one] 'water'

c. /notera/ [no'teɾɐ] 'I drank'

d. /kalore/ [ka'loɾe] 'big '

Finally, some speakers of the Formoso community who consider themselves to be descendents of the Waimare or Kaxiniti subgroups use [o] where [u] is used by the majority of the speakers (i.e. descendents of the Kozarene and Enomaniere subgroups). Vowel height assimilation is not found in the speech of Waimare speakers. In (8), the vowel [i] of the proclitic hi= does not influence the following vowel [o], as seen in the above example from the majority dialect (90b). More study is needed with Waimare speakers to analyze dialect variation of [o] and [u]. (8) /hi=kolotʲa/ [hikʲolo'tʲa] 'you are fat' 2sg=be.fat

2.1.2.3

Vowel nasality, rhinoglottophilia, and vowel lengthening

There is phonemic contrast between nasal consonants, but there is only marginal

phonemic contrast between nasal and oral vowels. According to Silva (2009), nasal

vowels occur when they precede a nasal consonant (through nasal spread or assimilation),

25

or when preceded by the glottal fricative [h], and oral vowels occur elsewhere. However,

the analysis of spectrograms of words where nasal vowels are expected to occur adjacent

to nasal consonants show that acoustically there is no nasalization. Figure 6 shows that

the vowel [e] before the nasal [n] is not nasalized because the F2 of the nasal does not go

through the vowel. The same occurs in Figure 7 with the vowel [i] before [n].

Figure 7: non-nasalized vowel [i] before nasal 26

Nasal vowels occur only in two contexts, in one there is complementary

distribution, and in the other marginal contrast. The first context is adjacent to a glottal

fricative in a word-final stressed syllable (Silva, 2009). The glottal fricative at the end of

a word produces an effect on the preceding and following vowel similar to nasalization,

called rhinoglottophilia. This effect is a type of spontaneous nasalization in which the

spectrum of the vowel is changed because of open glottis during the phonation

accompanying an [h] or breathy voice (Blevins & Garret, 1992). The spectrograms

below show the breathy voice, marked by substantial aperiodic or noisy energy in the

signal of the vowels preceding and following [h].

Figure 8: spontaneous nasalization of [a] in [ha] 27

Figure 9: spontaneous nasalization of [a] in [ha]
Nasality and lengthening are used to indicate the physical distance between the speech act participants and the referent in adverbial demonstratives. Some interjections and ideophones also exhibit lengthening and nasalization. Because of these few examples, I consider nasality and lengthening to be marginally contrastive. (11)
a. /ita/ 'there (close to speaker and addressee)' b. /ita/ [ĩ:tɐ] 'there distal (far away from speaker and addressee)' (12) a. /eθe/ 'this (close to speaker and addressee)' b. /eθe/ [ẽ:ðẽ] 'yonder (far away from speaker and addressee)' (13) a. /tseko/ 'far' b. /tseko/ [tsẽ:ko] 'very far away'
In formal speech (as when giving advice), vowels are often nasalized and lengthened at the end of an intonational unit.

Below, I describe the Paresi consonants. Palatalized consonants (with the exception of [tʲ] and [lʲ]) occur only when simultaneously preceded by the high front vowel [i] and followed by a vowel other than [i]. Non-palatalized consonants occur elsewhere. Palatalization will be described in §2.2.

2.1.3.1

Stops

There are four stop consonants: /b, t, tʲ, k/. The details are under the discussion of

each sound. The right-hand column provides minimal pairs or other pairs which show the

sounds are contrastive.

29

A. /b/

There are two allophones: [b] and [bʲ]. [bʲ] occurs only when it is both preceded

by [i] and followed by a vowel other than [i] (17), while [b] occurs elsewhere, including

when [i] both precedes and follows. The voiced bilabial stop [b] in word-initial and

medial positions is illustrated in examples (15) and (16). Most of the words with [b] are

borrowings from Portuguese, such as baka 'pay' and abowala 'squash' (from Portuguese

pagar and abóbora respectively).

C. /tʲ/

The palatalized alveolar stop occurs in initial (20) and medial positions (21). This

consonant does not occur before the anterior vowels [e] and [i], where there is

neutralization of [tʲ] and [t] in this environment as seen in §2.2.2.

D. /k/

There are two allophones: [k] and [kʲ]. The palatalized counterpart occurs only

when it is both preceded by [i] and followed by a vowel other than [i], while the former

occurs elsewhere. The voiceless velar stop [k] occurs in initial and medial positions, as in

(22) and (23).

Nasals

There are two allophones of the bilabial nasal: [m] and [mʲ]. [mʲ] occurs when it is

both preceded by a [i] and followed by a vowel other than [i] and [m] occurs elsewhere.

The bilabial nasal in initial and medial positions is illustrated in examples (25) and (26).

F. /n/

There are also two allophones of the alveolar nasal: [n] and [ɲ]. Similar to the

other phonemes which have a palatalized counterpart, [ɲ] is the allophone which only

occurs when it is both preceded by [i] and followed by a vowel other than [i]. The nasal

alveolar in initial and medial position is illustrated in the examples (28) and (29).

2.1.3.3 G. /l/

Liquids

The lateral approximant occurs only in medial position. The distinction between

/l/ and /lʲ/ is neutralized when they are followed by [i], as described in section §2.2.2. The

contrast between /l/ and /ɾ/ is also neutralized when between [a] or [o] and [i].

H. /lʲ/

The palatalized lateral approximant occurs only in medial position. [lʲ] was

considered an allophone of [l] by other people working on Paresi (see §2.3). However,

while [lʲ] could be considered an allophone of [l] when preceded by [i], as in nokilʲako 'in

my nose', because it is also preceded by [a] where regular palatalization process could not

explain its palatalized form. This is why I consider this consonant to be a marginal

phoneme.

There are three allophones: [ɾ], [d], and [dʲ]. [dʲ] occurs only when it is both

preceded by [i] and followed by a vowel other than [i]; the allophone [d] occurs when [i]

both precedes and follows; and the flap allophone [ɾ] occurs in initial position and when

it is both preceded and followed by a vowel other than [i]. The alveolar flap [ɾ] occurs in

initial and medial position as seen in (33) and (34).

There is a phonotactic restriction which does not allow the sequence [ɾi]. When /ɾ/ is both preceded and followed by [i], it has the allophone [d]. Then what happens when this phoneme is both preceded by a vowel other than [i] and followed by [i]? The distinction between the phonemes /ɾ/ and /l/ is neutralized in this environment. Neutralization is observed at morpheme boundaries, not inside of the root, and it will be described in §2.2.2. The only contrastive context where the distribution of /ɾ/ overlaps with /l/ is between the vowels [a] and [o]. However, there are very few examples where /ɾ/ occurs with non-front vowels, e.g.: tororo 'throat'. It is not clear whether these examples are loans. It may be the case that /ɾ/ and /l/ were allophones of a single historic phoneme, and recently became two different phonemes.

2.1.3.4 J. /f/

Fricatives

There are three allophones of the labiodental fricative: [f], [fʲ] and [ɸ]. [fʲ] occurs

35

in the environment in which other palatalized consonants occur (when it is both preceded

by [i] and followed by a vowel other than [i]) while [f] occurs elsewhere. The

environment where [ɸ] occurs is not clear. [ɸ] is found in the speech of some speakers in

the Formoso area, where [f] is found in the Rio Verde village. It may be the case that

there is dialect variation, but more research is needed to confirm this hypothesis. The

voiceless labio-dental fricative in initial and medial position is illustrated in examples

(36) and (37).

K. /θ/

The alveolar fricative has two allophones: [θ] and [ð]. [ð] occurs between vowels,

while [θ] occurs elsewhere. This consonant in word-initial and medial position is

illustrated in examples (39) and (40). The phoneme /θ/ cannot occur preceded or followed

by [i]. There is neutralization of the phonemes /θ/ and /ʃ/ when /θ/ is followed by [i], and

neutralization of /θ/ and /j/ when /θ/ is both preceded by [i] and a vowel other than [i]

(see §2.2.2).

/teɾa/ 'drink' /ahoma/ 'blow'

L. /ʃ/

The voiceless palato-alveolar fricative occurs in word-initial and medial position,

followed by [a] or [i]. /ʃ/ is not a palatalized allophone of /θ/ when it is followed by [i]

because this phoneme also occurs followed by [a]. Similar to the consonant /lʲ/, this is a

marginal phoneme.

M. /h/ There are two glottal fricative allophones: the default allophone [h] and the
allophone [hʲ] which occurs only when it is both preceded by [i] and followed by a vowel other than [i]. [h] occurs elsewhere. This voiceless fricative glottal in initial and medial position is illustrated in the examples (43) and (44). (43) /hati/ 'houseʼ /heka/ 'he is drunk'

Affricates

The voiceless alveolar affricate in initial and medial position is illustrated in

examples (46) and (47). /ts/ is never followed by /i/, as there is a neutralization of the

phonemes /ts/ and /tʃ/ in this environment (see §2.2.2).

O. /tʃ/ The voiceless palato-alveolar affricate occurs in initial and medial position as seen
in (48) and (49). This consonant is described in Silva (2009) as an allophone of /ts/ when
38

it is followed by [i]. I consider /tʃ/ to be a marginal phoneme because it can also be followed by the vowels [a] and [o]. (48) /tʃabiɾawata/ 'swallow' /tʃikiti/ 'excrement' /tʃolai/ 'type of bird' (49) /notʃabowali/ 'my hat' /notʃiyete/ 'my grandson' /aitʃota/ 'he is sneezing'

2.1.3.6 P. /w/

Approximant

There are two approximant allophones: [w] and [wʲ]. [wʲ] occurs only when it is

both preceded by [i] and followed by a vowel other than [i], while the former occurs

elsewhere. The voiced labial-velar approximant in initial and medial position is illustrated

in (50) and (51).

Q. /j/ The palatal approximant /j/ occurs in word-medial position, as is illustrated in (53). There is a neutralization of the phonemes /θ/ and /j/ when /θ/ occurs both preceded by [i] and followed by a vowel other than [i] at morpheme boundaries (see §2.2.2). (53) /eje/ 'this' /ijete/ 'type of armadillo' /waija/ 'he sees' 2.1.4 Distribution of Consonants I will describe the restrictions on the distribution and combination of sounds in different morphophonological and syllabic contexts. These restrictions are related to the phonological processes to be described in §2.2.2. Table 5 shows that /lʲ/, /ʃ/, and /tʃ/ have a restricted distribution, which may be evidence of their recent phonemicization in Paresi. The restricted distribution of /f/ may be related to a lenition process (p>h) attested in Arawak languages. According to Silva (2009), /ɸ/ (in my analysis /f/) is the intermediate phase in the lenition process: p>ɸ>h. Therefore, the few words with /f/ would be words that have not yet undergone the final phase of the lenition process.

As we can see in Table 5, /b/ has a restricted occurrence with vowels, and in general there are few words with this phoneme: loans from Portuguese, kinship terms or body parts, and onomatopoeic words. There are phonological reasons for the absence of combinations such as tʲi, tʲe, θi, and tsi (see discussion in the next section).

7 The distributions in Table 5 are rare when they occurred only once or twice in my lexicon (~3000 words), and less common when they occurred in fewer than 5 tokens. Y=yes, N=no.

2.2 Palatalization and neutralization

2.2.1 Allophonic palatalization The phonemes /b, k, m, n, ɾ, f, h, w/ have two allophones: a) [b, k, m, n, ɾ, f, h,

w]; and b) the palatalized allophones: [bʲ, kʲ, mʲ, nʲ, dʲ, fʲ, hʲ, wʲ]. The palatalized

allophones occur in the context preceded by a high front vowel [i] and followed by

vowels other than the high front vowel in root-internal environments (progressive

palatalization), as seen in (54). I consider the analysis of these cases of palatalization as

secondary palatalization using the terminology in Bateman (2007), Hall (2000) and

Kochetov (1998, 2002). There are no palatalized allophones of these phonemes in word-

initial position.

(54)

C → Cʲ/i_a,e,o

b. /θoima/ [θuimʲa] 'child'

c. /irai/

[idʲɛi] 'he talked'

d. /tiha/

[tihʲɐ̃] 'it is cold'

e. /aliwa/ [aliwʲa] 'eagle'

Palatalization may result from spreading of the [+high] feature to any of the places of articulation (Lahiri & Evers, 1991). In Paresi, we see spreading of the [+high] feature of the vowel [i]. According to the analysis in Silva (2009: 139), based on feature geometry (Clements & Hume, 1995), palatalization is triggered by the spreading of features in the V-Place of the vowel [coronal, -anterior] to the V-place of the consonant target. The only difference in the analyses is the assignment of a [+high] or [-anterior] feature to the triggers.
The spectrograms below show palatalization, where there is some overlap of the consonant and the high front vowel. The palatal gesture begins in the preceding vowel and affects the F2 of the following vowel. This overlap is not seen in the cases where a

42

vowel follows an underlying palatalized consonant such as /tʲ/, as in Figure 13. Figure 10: Palatalized glottal fricative
Figure 11: Palatalized alveolar nasal 43

Figure 12: Palatalized approximant
Figure 13: phoneme [tʲ] Figure 14 shows the consonant [d] is not palatalizated when it is preceded by [i]:
44

Figure 14: no palatalization of [d]

In (55), the initial consonants of verb roots starting with /b, k, m, n, f, h, and w/

become palatalized by attaching a proclitic with [i], such as the personal pronominal

proclitics hi= '2sg', wi= '1pl', and xi= '2pl'. Figures 11 and 12 show spectrograms of

(55a) both without and with palatalization of /k/.

2pl=disappear

45

Figure 15: [k] in the beginning of word

Figure 16: palatalization of [k] following hi=

The only case where there is no secondary palatalization is when the consonant is

both preceded and followed by the vowel [i], and the general rule is (56). Silva

(2009:160) expands this rule by saying that there is no palatalization when consonants are

both preceded by [i] and followed by the vowels [e] or [i], as in the following examples

from his thesis in (57).

*Cj / i__e

a. /tʃikeɾe/[tʃikeɾe] 'be yellow'

b. /timena/ [timenɐ] 'be heavy'

46

His analysis is partly right because there are instances where there is no

palatalization of consonants in the /i_e/ context.8 For example, when [e] is produced

through sandhi processes the palatalization of the consonant does not occur. In the

example (58b) the vowel raising of [a] to [e], when the suffix -re is attached, forbids the

palatalization of [k]. In (59b), the same process occurs, and /tʲ/ is realized as [t]:

Figure 17: no palatalization of [k]
However, there are instances in my lexicon where consonants are palatalized in this environment. For example, the same word for 'heavy', which was not transcribed with [mʲ] in (57), is found with the palatalized consonant.
8 The palatalized phoneme /tʲ/ does not occur followed by [e], see section 2.2.2.

b. /h=imeθa/ [himʲeðɐ] 'you gathered'

Figure 18: Palatalization in the environment i_e

Finally, we would expect /ts/ to undergo secondary palatalization after the vowel

[i] in words such as aitsa 'he killed', if we consider the trigger of palatalization as the

preceding vowel [i]. However, there is no sequence *itsʲ in the language. The same is true

of the phonemes /ʃ/, /tʃ/, and /θ/ (*[ʃʲ], *[tʃʲ],*[θʲ] ). Therefore, secondary palatalization

does not affect fricatives nor the phoneme /tʲ/, as seen in the example (61). In verb roots,

the phoneme /tʲ/ undergoes dissimilation in the same context where other phonemes

undergo palatalization (see §2.6.7)

(61)

a. /wi=tʲaoli/

[witʲaoli] 'in our forehead'

1pl=forehead

b. /i=tʲako/

[itʲako] 'his stomach'

3sg=stomach

In conclusion, we can make the following generalizations: non-fricative

48

consonants and palatalized consonants (except /t/ and /tʲ/, /l/ and /lʲ/) are in complementary distribution. When consonants are both preceded by [i] and followed by a vowel other than [i], there is secondary palatalization. We see palatalization in both contexts: phonological and morphophonological.

2.2.2 Neutralization As seen below in Table 6, the phonemes /t/ and /tʲ/ have an overlapping
distribution. The two phonemes can be preceded by any vowel and followed by [a] or [o]. The palatalization distinction is neutralized for the phonemes /t/ and /tʲ/ before the vowels [i] and [e] because of the phonotactic restriction *tʲi/e.

Another case of overlapping distribution is the distribution of the phonemes /l/ and /lʲ/. They only overlap in the environment a_a, as seen in Table 7. Their distribution is more restricted than the distribution of /t/ and /tʲ/. The distinction /l/ and /lʲ/ is neutralized in the following environments: a) [l] occurs followed by [i] (*lʲi), and in the environments o_a, a_o, o_o; b) [lʲ ] occurs both when preceded by [i] and followed by [a].

The phoneme /l/ also exhibits overlapping distribution with the phoneme /ɾ/.9

However, their distribution is neutralized when /ɾ/ is both preceded by /a/ or /o/ and

followed by the vowel /i/ (which is the result of vowel harmony /e/ to /i/) at morpheme

boundaries.10 In (62), first vowel harmony raises /e/ to /i/ when the suffixes -ti 'UNPOSS'

or -ki 'CAUS' are attached to the roots, then [ɾi] changes to [li].

liver-UNPOSS

c. /e-haihaɾe-ki-tsa-h-ene/ [ehaihalikitsa] 'they made him to be shy'

CAUS-be.shy-CAUS-TH-PL-3O

Other types of neutralization are the alternations between the following

phonemes: /ts/ ~ /tʃ/ and /θ/ ~ /ʃ/ before [i], and /θ/ ~ /j/ after [i]. Because of the

phonotactic restrictions *tsi and *θi in Paresi, the consonants /ts/ and /θ/ undergo

palatalization resulting in a palato-alveolar (regressive palatalization). This alternation

occurs in morphophonological contexts. Example (63) shows the alternations /ts/ ~ /tʃ/

when the suffix -ita 'IFV' is attached to the root.

(63)

a. /n=aits-ita/

[naitʃita] 'I am killing'

1sg=kill-IFV

b. /n=halaitsoa-ita/ [nahalaitʃuita] 'I am jumping' 1sg=jump-IFV

In (64), the interdental consonant [θ] alternates with [j] when it is after one of the
9 The contrast between /l/ and /ɾ/ occurs within the roots. 10 Other alternations /l/ ~/ɾ/ are seen in the allomorphy of possessed suffixes (-la~-ra) and nominalizers (-
lo~-ro), which are discussed in sections §4.3.2and §4.6.3, respectively.
50

proclitics with the vowel [i]:11 In another context, as in (65), the morpheme -θi 'POSSED' surfaces as -ʃi before [i], in order to avoid the sequence [θi] in the language. (64) a. /hi=θane/ [hijane] 'you went away'
2sg=go.away

b. /hi=θera/ [hijera] 'you song'

2sg=sing

(65)

a. /no=timela-θi/

[notimʲɛlaʃi] 'my blood'

1sg=blood-POSSED

b. /no=tʲakoira-θi/

[notʲakuidʲaʃi] 'my chicken'

1sg=chicken=POSSED

The change of [ts] to [tʃ] is not considered to be neutralization by Silva (2009). He argues that [tʃ] only occurs before [i] and that all exceptions to this generalization are loan words. In my lexicon, there are a few words with [tʃ] before the vowels [a] or [o] which are not loans, such as [tʃabidawata] 'swallow' and [tʃolai] 'type of bird'. Because of that, words with [tʃ] are not considered to have an underlying form with /ts/ in my analysis. Therefore, I consider that there is neutralization of the phonemes before [i].
2.3 Phonological analysis in Rowan & Burgess (1969) and Silva (2009) The consonant inventory proposed here diverges slightly from Rowan & Burgess
(1969) and Silva (2009). Table 8 compares the different phonemic inventories proposed for Paresi12. All works agree with regards to the vowel inventory of four segments.

11 Silva (2009) considers the change /θ/ to /j/ to be a process of palatalization followed by coronalization
(spreading of the V-place of the consonant to its C-place). 12 R= Rowan, 1969, S= Silva, 2009, B= Brandão.
51

Table 8: Phonemic inventories proposed for Paresi b t tʲ k m n ɾ l lʲ f ɸ θ ð ʃ h ts tʃ w i R Y Y Y Y Y Y YY NNNNYNY Y YY Y S Y Y Y Y YYY Y NNYYNNYYNY Y B Y Y Y Y YYY Y YYNYNYYYYY Y
Rowan does not present /f/, /lʲ/ and /ʃ/ as phonemes. My analysis of [f] and [ɸ] differs from Silva's regarding the choice of which allophone is considered basic. According to Silva (2009), the basic allophone is /ɸ/. I consider [f] to be the basic allophone because it is more often used in the communities. Rowan & Burgess (1969) states that [ɸ] is only present in some varieties. In Formoso, some speakers use [ɸ] and others use [f], and thus far I cannot find a conditioning factor. People who use [ɸ] say they belong to the Waimaré group. In Rio Verde, they use [f], and the majority of the people there say they belong to a different Paresi group called Kozarene.
In addition, the lateral /l/ and the palatalized lateral /lʲ/ are considered to be phonemes (similar to /t/ and /tʲ/). I do not have minimal pairs distinguishing /l/ and /lʲ/, but [lʲ] occurs after [a] (e.g.: [alʲako] 'where', [ala] 'FOC'). The analysis of [lʲ] as an allophone of /l/ in contexts after [i] does not account for this other context. Because the distribution of /lʲ/ is very restricted I call this a “marginal” consonant.
/ʃ/ is another phoneme which is analyzed by others to be a allophone of /θ/. It is a marginal phoneme because I have only one minimal pair ([ʃana] 'bee' and [θana] 'genipap'), and because the distribution of [ʃ] is restricted to contexts before [i] and [a], while [θ] appears before [a], [ e], and [o].
2.4 Syllable types and structure In this section, I will describe properties of vowel sequences and syllable types. In
Paresi, there are no codas or complex onsets. The attested syllable types are: CV, CVV, VV, and V. The glides /w/ and /j/ can combine with vowels in the sequences jV and wV.
52

2.4.1 Vowel sequences A vowel sequence consists of two vowels in the same syllable. Table 9 illustrates
the vowel sequences which are considered to be diphthongs: /oa/, /ae/, /oe/, /ai/, /ei/, oi/, and /ao/.

Table 9: vowel sequences

a

e

i

o

*

i

*

*

*

*

o

oa

oe

oi

*

The sequences /oa/, /ae/, and /oe/ can only be analyzed as diphthongs, while the other sequences may be analyzed as either diphthongs or combinations of vowel-glide. The sequence /oa/ is better analyzed as a diphthong and not /wa/. Evidence for this is the deletion of the vowel /a/ in the verb tyoa 'come' (e.g.: tyohena 'he will come'). If /oa/ were /wa/ the deletion would leave only a consonant, and then this would be the only case of consonant clusters. The vowel sequences /ae/ and /oe/ also must be interpreted as diphthongs. If they were sequences with a final glide, the glide would have triggered the process of palatalization of the phoneme /θ/ to [j] (e.g. /ajθokero/-> [ajjokero]).
(66) a. /e'θoa/ [e'ðoa] 'he fell' b. /aeθoke'ro/ [aeðo'kero] 'Aezokero (proper name)' c. /'koeθa/ ['koeða] 'he laughed'

The examples in (67) illustrate the possible combinations of the adjacent vowels /a/ and /e/ pronounced as one syllable at morpheme boundaries. This is more evidence that the vowel sequence /ae/ is a diphthong and not a vowel-glide sequence. The consonant following the diphthong is not palatalized as it would be if the sequence were /aj/.
53

(67)

a. /a-ekoa-ki-tsa/

[aˬekoakitsa] 'he made ran away'

CAUS-run.away-CAUS-TH

b. /n=a-eθet=ene/

[naˬeðetene] 'I smelled it'

1sg=CAUS-be.smelly=3O

The sequences: /ao/, /ai/, /oi/, and /ei/ are also diphthongs. They are not analyzed as a combination vowel-glide for two reasons. First, they are similar to the other diphthongs seen above. For example, all sequences are heavy syllable with two moras, which attract stress in a word. Second, this analysis would complicate the phonology. The glide in coda position would be the only exception to the restriction of having consonant in coda position. Furthermore, the inventory of vowels would have to comprise only three vowel sequences /oa/, /ae/, and /oe/.
(68) a. /ka'mai/ [kamai] 'sun' b. /'kaoka/ ['kaokɐ] 'arrive' c. /ko'koi/ [ko'koi] 'hawk' d. /'oina/ ['uinʲa] 'be thirsty' e. /matʲei/ [matʲei] 'tripod'

The examples below show more combinations of vowels pronounced in the same

syllable at morpheme boundaries.

a. /a-ijo-heta/

[aˬijoheta] 'he made cry'

CAUS-be.dry-PERF

b. /a-otʲa-ki-tsa/

[aˬutʲakitsa] 'he taught (made remember)'

CAUS-remember-CAUS-TH

54

2.4.2 Glides The sequences [jV] and [wV] are better analyzed as glide-vowel combinations,

not diphthongs. The glide in the glide-vowel sequence falls within the same syllable as

the following vowel, an argument in favor of the diphthong analysis. However, these

glides are considered to be consonant segments for two reasons. One piece of evidence is

the neutralization of /j/ and /θ/ preceded by [i] at morpheme boundaries (see more

discussion in §2.2.2) in (69b). Other evidence is morphophonological. The same set of

pronominal proclitics attaches to verb roots beginning with consonants and glides, while

another set attaches to vowel-initial verb roots.

(69)

a. /ijeti/ [i.ji.ti] 'flower'

b. /hi=θera/

[hi.je.ra] 'you sang'

2sg=sing

2.5 Prosody
2.5.1 Stress patterns In Paresi, word stress has delimitative functions in that it indicates word boundaries. In general, stress occurs in the penultimate syllable of a word. Acoustically, vowel duration may be the main correlate of stress. However, duration may not always be important correlate since in a few examples the stressed vowel is only slightly longer than an unstressed vowel. Experimental data is needed in order to show if duration is a reliable correlate of stress. The data used for the analysis of stress was gathered in carrier sentences of the type in (70). Further research on stress is needed to collected more words for future experimental data analysis. (70) Hiyaya ____, natyo atyo nowaiya ___, ___ zoaha
'you saw a ___, I saw a ____ and a _____'
55

I did not use data from lists of words in isolation because in words in isolation phrasal intonation may interact with stress. A phrasal intonation in Paresi is defined by Silva (2013: 108) as a raising in pitch at the end of a phrase and a lowering at the beginning of the next phrase. In polymorphemic words in isolation, pitch is higher in the suffix, at the end of the word (which is also the end of the intonation phrase). This raising at the end of the word may be perceived as stress. That may explain why Silva (2013) described stress as falling on suffixes. His data come from words in isolation, and he says that the higher pitch in words with suffixes coincides with the primary stress in the last syllable. Contrary to my analysis in which suffixes do not get stress.
Stress in monomorphemic words Paresi exhibits a penultimate stress pattern, as shown in (71), contrary to the analysis in Silva (2013) where stress is not predictable in monomorphemic words. There are few trisyllabic and polysyllabic noun stems (without any suffixes) and they also follow this pattern. Figure 19 shows that the vowel in the stressed syllable [fa] of the word [kafaka] 'yesterday' is longer than the other vowels. (71) a. toto ['to. to] 'breast' b. kafaka [ka.'fa.kɐ] 'yesterday' c. tihanare [ˌti.ha.'na.re] 'sorcerer'
56

Figure 19: stressed syllable [fa]
However, there are exceptions to this stress pattern. Some words receive stress on the last or antepenultimate syllable. This case can be explained by syllable weight. Paresi exhibits quantity sensitivity, in which stress falls on a heavy syllable with two moras: CVV, as shown in (72).
(72) a. kotyoi [ko.'tʲuj] 'tapir' b. irai [i.'dʲɛj] 'he told' c. alatai [a.la'.tai] 'cascudinho fruit' c. ferakoa [fe.ra.'koa] 'in the morning' d. kaimare ['kai.ma.re] 'moon' e. wainama ['wai.na.mɐ] 'be. tasty'
Another exception to the penultimate stress pattern is when stress is the only feature marking meaningful contrast in a few pair of nouns. In the first word of each pair, we see a regular pattern of stress, but in the second word of the pair the stress falls on the last syllable. These pairs are presented in (73) (the only examples I have in my corpus).
(73) a. [ˈma.kɐ] 'night'
57

[ma.ˈka] 'hammock' b. [ˈka.he] 'hand '
[ka.ˈhi] 'coatamundi' c. [ˈko.re] 'opossum'
[ko.'re] 'arrow' d. ['ha.re] 'body'
[ha.'re] 'my son (voc)' e. ['ke.tse] 'knife'
[ke.'tse] 'be.sharp' Acoustically, Figures 20 and 21 show that the stressed vowel in one pair is longer
than the same vowel in the unstressed syllable in the other pair.
Figure 20: stress in the first syllable ['maka] 'night'
58

Figure 21: stress in the first syllable [ma'ka] 'hammock'
Stress may also be irregular with a few nouns and verbs. I have no explanation of the assignment of stress in words such as ohiro 'woman' and hinama 'two' (different from hanama 'three' where the stress falls on the penultimate syllable). In example (74), the only examples which may have an explanation are the words ezanityo 'wife' and ezanene 'husband'. The reason why they get stress on the last syllables tyo and ne may be because these forms mark gender contrast.
(74) a. hinama [hi.nʲa.'ma] 'two' b.ezanityo [ˌe.ða.ni.'tʲo] 'wife' c. ezanene [ˌe.ða.ne.'ne] 'husband' d. ohiro ['u.hi.dʲu] 'woman'
There are only two examples of monosyllabic word stems in (75), and these exhibit heavy syllables. Therefore, there is a minimal word requirement that a word should have at least two moras. The root in (75)b only occurs with the thematic suffix -ka.
(75) a. /'tʲoa/ ['tʲoa] 'he came'
59

b. /'ao(-ka)/ ['aoka] 'think, wish'

Stress in polymorphemic words

Proclitics, prefixes, and the suffixes -ti 'UNPOSS', -ta 'IFV', -nae 'PL', -ne

'POSSED' or -re 'NMLZ'13 are not included in the syllable count that determines the

distribution of stress in the preceding syllables, see examples (77) through (79). In

example (76), stress is assigned to the penultimate syllable of the root etse 'testicle', and it

remains on the same syllable when -ti 'UNPOSS' is attached.

(76) a. etse

['e.tse]

'testicle of.'

b. etse-ti

['e.tse.ti] 'testicle'

testicle-UNPOSS

(77) a. nirai

[ni.'dʲai]

'I said'

b. n=irai-ta

[ni.'dʲai.ta] 'I am saying'

1sg=say-IFV

(78) a. Ø-i'tyani

[i.'tʲa.ni] 'his son'

3sg=son

b. Ø-ityani-nae

[i.'tʲa.ni.nʲae] 'his sons'

3sg=son-PL

(79) a. zaolo

['θao.lo] 'headdress'

b. e=zaolo-ne

[e.'ðao.lo.ne] 'his headdress'

3sg=headdress-POSSED

The above words have less than three syllables included in the syllable count that determines the distribution of stress, so they only get a primary stress. Words with more than three syllables get a secondary stress. Primary stress is associated with the highest prominence (longer duration) of a syllable, while secondary stress is the lower prominence (but still higher then unstressed syllables). Secondary stress goes two
13 In this regards, this analysis diverges from the one in Silva (2013). He affirms that suffixes have their own lexical stress, except -ti.
60

syllables before that syllable with primary stress. (80)
a. zekohatse-ti [ˌθe.ko.'ha.tse.ti] 'leader' leader-UNPOSS
b. kahehali-ti [ˌka.he.'ha.li.ti] 'illness' be.ill-UNPOSS

The suffixes -kala 'NMLZ', -hare 'MASC', and -hena 'TRS' have two syllables and they have their own lexical stress on their penultimate syllable, as seen below:

(81)

a. ma-i-tona-ne-hare [ˌmai.tu.ˌna.ne.'ha.re] 'one who is paralyzed'

NEG-CAUS-walk-POSSED-MASC

b. m-ena-ne-hare-ti

[me.ˌna.ne.'ha.li.ti] 'immortality'

NEG-life-POSSED-MASC-UNPOSS

c. e-hana-ne-hare

[ˌe.ha.ˌna.ne.'ha.re] 'his plantation'

3sg=leaf-POSSED-MASC

d. ma-waija-ha-kala-hare [ma.ˌwai.ja.ˌka.la.'ha.re] 'one who is blind'

NEG-see-NMLZ-MASC

Assignment of primary and secondary stress in polymorphemic words may be

affected by syllable weight. In (82a), secondary stress falls on the diphthong ai, because

this is a heavy syllable, and the primary stress shifts from the penultimate syllable he to

the syllable ne (-re is not included in the distribution of stress since it is a suffix).

(82)

iraihenere [i.ˌdʲai.he'ne.re] 'what was told'

talk-TRS-NMLZ

In this work, I will not analyze stress in terms of foot types. Silva (2013) presents an accounting of foot types, saying that Paresi has an iambic stress pattern (where the
61

rightmost syllable in the feet gets the stress). One of the examples he provides as of the iambic pattern is (83). In (83)b, the stress shifts from the penultimate syllable fi to the suffix -tya 'TH' when -ti 'UNPOSS' is attached. This pattern is different from the one seen with nouns when -ti is attached. I cannot confirm that the suffix -tya in verbs is included in the distribution of stress or not, because I do not have examples of -tya with verbs in carrier sentences. Future research is needed to investigate whether stress in Paresi is better analyzed as trochaic or iambic, and whether there are differences in the stress patterns of nouns and verbs, as seen in English and Nanti (Michael, 2008).
(83) a. fitya [('fi.tʲa)] 'he planted'
b. fitya-ti [(fi.'tʲa).ti] '(something) planted'
plant-UNPOSS
2.6 Morphophonemics This section shows phonological processes that only occur only at morpheme
boundaries. These processes are: vowel harmony, vowel assimilation, vowel raising, vowel deletion, [j] insertion, palatalization, and depalatalization.
2.6.1 Vowel harmony /e/ → /i/ There is alternation /e/ → /i/. There are two contexts in which the process is
applied: i) when suffixes with /i/ are attached to roots or suffixes ending with /e/, and ii) when the proclitic e= '3sg' attaches to roots beginning with /i/ or a palatalized consonant.
In the first context, the vowel harmony occurs when the vowel /e/ at the end of noun roots or suffixes changes to [i] after the following suffixes are attached: -ti 'UNPOSS'14, -hi 'CLF:long', -ri 'CLF:round', and -ri 'POSSED'. In (84), there are examples with noun roots. In (85), /e/ in the suffix -hare 'MASC' changes to [i] when
14 Silva (2009) gives the example zotse-ti [θotseti] / eye-UNPOSS 'eye' as the only example in which there is no vowel harmony, contrary to what my data show.

1sg=cassava.flour-POSSED

(85)

/initʲo-hare-ti/

[initʲohaliti] 'elder'

elder-MASC-UNPOSS

The other context where the vowel harmony occurs is when the proclitic e= '3sg'16 is attached to noun roots with a vowel [i] or a palatalized consonant, as seen in the examples below. In (86c), the vowel /e/ changes to [i] before the palatalized consonant [tʲ]. (86) a. /e=hino/ [ihiɲu] 'his neck'
3sg=neck b. /e=kitʃi/ [ikitʃi] 'his foot'
3sg=foot c. /e=tʲako/ [itʲako] 'his stomach'
3sg=stomach

According to Silva (2009: 88), vowel harmony is a phonological process that does
15 Another change is [haɾi] to [hali] because [ɾ] does not occur before [i], as discussed in 2.1.3.3 . 16 This process is relevant only with this proclitic.
63

not occur only at morpheme boundaries. He says there are no stems where a syllable with [e] is followed by a syllable with [i]. However, I found a few examples of stems showing this environment in (87). Therefore, this process is morphophonological. (87) /eteti/ 'flesh' /katsehi/ 'calf'
2.6.2 Vowel assimilation Vowel assimilation occurs regressively and progressively at the morpheme
boundaries, and it is not limited to the syllable immediately before the conditioning vowel. [o] changes to [u] in two contexts: i) in a root when proclitics or suffixes with [i] are attached to them, and ii) in a proclitic, when a root begins with [i]. Examples (88) and (89) are regressive assimilation, while is progressive assimilation. In (88a), the root has a [o] in the syllable lo when the enclitic ene is attached, but it changes to [u] when -ita is attached, as in (88b). In (89a), the root has [o] in the syllable ko when the suffix -re is attached, and it changes to [u] when -ti is attached, as in (89b). In (90b), the proclitic hi= triggers vowel assimilation in the two following syllables with the vowel [o]. (88) a. /ha=nolok=ene/ [hanolokene] 'you pulled it'
2sg=pull=3O b. /ha=nolok-ita/ [hanulukita] 'you are pulling'
2sg=pull-IFV (89) a. /e-tʲakoɾe/ [etʲakoɾe] 'his liver'
3sg=liver b. /tʲakoɾe-ti/ [tʲakuliti] 'liver'
liver-UNPOSS (90) a. /n=kolotʲa/ [nakolo'tʲa] 'I am fat'
64

1sg=be.fat b. /hi=kolotʲa/ [hikʲulu'tʲa] 'you are fat'
2s-be.fat

The vowel [o] in the proclitic no= '1sg' changes to [u] when it precedes a syllable

with [i]:

(91)

/no=tʃijete/

[nutʃijete] 'my grandson'

1sg=grandson

2.6.3 Vowel raising: /a/ → [e]/[i] The vowel /a/ at the end of verb roots and of the classifier -za changes to [e] when

suffixes with the vowel [e] or [i] are attached to the roots.

(92) shows examples of vowel raising when verb suffixes, such as the completive -heta,

the transitional -hena, the nominalizers -re and -ne, are attached immediately to the verb

roots:

(92)

a. /hi=tsema-hena/ [hitsemehenɐ] 'hear!'

2sg=hear-TRS

b. /n=ija-heta/

[ijeheta] 'I caught'

1sg=catch-PERF

c. /tʲaone-hete-hena/ [tʲaonehetehenɐ] 'kill!'

2sg=kill-TRS

d. /watʲa-re/ [wateɾe] 'the one who is hot'

hot-NMLZ

e. /wija-ne/

[wijene] 'something that is sweet'

be.sweet-NMLZ

65

In (93), the last -hena suffix influences the preceding suffix -ita, which changes to

-ite. On the other hand, the first occurrence of -hena closer to the root neither is affected

by the last -hena (showing that the regressive assimilation does not influence more than

one preceding syllable), nor it influences the root hikoa because of the diphthong /oa/.

(93)

/hikoa-hena-ha-ita-hena-ha/

[hikoahenahitehenaha] 'they were arriving'

show.up-TRS-PL-IFV-TRS-PL

The class of transitive verbs which take the thematic suffixes -tya or -ka and the

verb kera seem to be exceptions to the vowel raising process seen above. However,

instead of affirming that these transitive verbs are exceptions, one can hypothesize that

the thematic suffixes undergo vowel raising, and then they are dropped. For example, the

transitive verb mala 'pull off' occurs with the thematic suffix -ka in (94a). In (94b) the

thematic suffix -ka may undergo vowel raising to -ke, and then is dropped (it cannot co-

occur with -hena), explaining why [a] in mala does not change to [e].

(94)

a. /mala-ka-h=ene/

[malakahene] 'they pulled it off'

pull.off-TH-PL=3O

b. /mala-ka-hena-h-it=ene/ [malahenahitene] 'they willl pull it off'

pull.off-TH-TRS-PL-IFV=3O

The verb kera 'burn' can be intransitive or transitive. When in the transitional aspect, the transitive form of this verb does not undergo vowel raising, while the intransitive form does, as seen in (95). This apparent exception can be explained based on analogy to other transitive verbs which take thematic suffixes and do not undergo vowel raising. (95) a. /hi=kera-hena/ [hikʲerahena] 'you are going to burn (something)'

66

2sg=burn-TRS b./kera-hena/ [kerehena] 'it is going to burn'
burn-TRS

The classifier -za (incorporated in the verb) is also influenced by the nominalizer

-re as in (96)a. Suffixes with the vowel /i/, such as -hi 'CLF:long', also influence the

change /a/ to [e], as seen in (96b).

(96)

a. /katʲala-θa-re/

[katʲalaðeɾe] 'mush'

sour-CLF:liq-NMLZ

b. /watʲa-hi-ri/

[watehidi] 'he is sweating'

be.hot-CLF:long-CLF:round

In addition, vowel raising is a process which only occurs with verbs, not with nouns. The suffix -ne 'POSSED' does not influence the preceding /a/ vowels in the following examples: (97) a. /hi=tʃiriba-ne/ [hitʃidibʲane] 'your skirt'
2sg=skirt-POSSED b. /en=a-wena-ne/ [enawenane] 'his life'
3sg=?-life-POSSED

Only suffixes can trigger vowel raising. Classifiers ending in /e/, such as he

'CLF:powder' and tse 'CLF:small', do not trigger assimilation when incorporated into

verbs:

(98)

/n=imeθa-tse-tʲa/ [nimʲeðatsetʲa] 'I gathered seeds (or small things)'

1sg=gather-CLF:small-TH

67

2.6.4 Vowel deletion Vowel deletion can occur in three contexts: i) when suffixes are attached to verb

roots ending in /a/, ii) when proclitics are attached to verb roots beginning with vowels,

and iii) when the first vowel of a second position clitic coincides with the final vowel of

the preceding word.

The verb suffixes -ita 'IFV', -ene '3O', and -i 'CAUS', which end in a vowel, lead

to the deletion of the final vowel of verb roots or suffixes ending in /a/, as illustrated in

(99). In (99c), we see that the final vowel of the suffix -ha 'PL' is dropped when the suffix

is followed by one of the suffixes seen above.

(99)

a. /n=tsema-ita/

[natsemita] 'I am listening'

1sg=hear-IFV

b. /no=tera-ene/

[noterene] 'I drank it'

1sg=drink-3O

c. /ø-aθa-hena-ha-ita-hena-ha/

[aðehenahitehenaha] 'they asked'

3sg=ask-TRS-PL-IFV-TRS-PL

The same process is applied to personal proclitics, which lose their vowels when

attached to vowel initial roots:

(100)

a. /no=irai-ita/

[nidʲaita] 'I talked'

1sg=talk-IFV

b. /na=aiko-tʲa/

[naikʲotʲa] 'I cut'

1sg=cut-TH

The process does not affect diphthongs, except in the verb tyoa 'come'. The last vowel of the diphthong is dropped when followed by the transitional -hena.

68

(101) a. /hi=tʲoa-hena/
2sg=come-TRS

[hitsohena] 'come here!'

Another type of vowel deletion occurs with second position clitics. Clitics such as

ite 'FUT', ala 'FOC', have their initial vowel dropped if the preceding word begins with

the same vowel.

(102)

a. /makani ite/ [makanite] 'tomorrow'

b. /wija ala/

[wijala] 'let's go'

2.6.5 [i] insertion [i] insertion occurs in a few words before /ɾ/ when suffixes are attached to noun or

verb roots. [i] is added to trigger the change /ɾ/ to [d], and avoid the sequence ri.

(103)

a. /θera-ita/

[θeidita] 'he is singing'

sing-IFV

b. /no=ketse-ri/

[noketseidi] 'my knife'

1sg=knife-POSSED

In (103a), the final vowel [a] of the stem /θeɾa/ is dropped when the suffix -ita is

attached (as seen in section 2.6.4 ). Then in order to avoid the sequence ɾi in [θeɾita],

there is an insertion of the vowel [i] before /ɾ/, and the root /θeɾ/ becomes [θeid] (/ɾ/

becomes [d] in the environment i_i).

(104)

a. /no=θera-ita/

[noðeidita] 'I am singing'

1sg=sing-IFV

b. /no=tera-ita/ 1sg=drink-IFV

[noteidita] 'I am drinking'

69

2.6.6 w>j change The example below is the only example where the glide /w/ changes to [j]. In
(108), it is expected that /w/ would become a palatalized consonant [wʲ], as in [hiwʲɛijɐ]. However, the output is [j] instead of [wʲ]. (105)
a. /hi=waija/ [hijɛijɐ] 'you saw' 2s-see

2.6.7 Dissimilation: /tʲ/ and /t/ → /ts/ There is a neutralization of the phonemes /t/, /tʲ/ and /ts/. The neutralization

occurs when a proclitic with the vowel /i/ is attached to verb roots beginning with /t/ or

/tʲ/.17 The phoneme /tʲ/ changes to /ts/ in the environment preceded by a proclitic with /i/

and followed by [a] or [o], while /t/ changes to /ts/ in the environment preceded by a

proclitic with [i] and followed by [e].

According to Kochetov (2011), the existence of a process that would produce the

reverse effect of place-changing palatalization, such as /tʲ/ to /ts/, is very rare. This type of

palatalization is also very rare in Paresi.

(106) [tʲ]--> [ts]/i _o,a

a. /hi=tʲaona/

[hitsaunɐ] 'You became'

2sg=become

b. /hi=tʲoa/

[hitsoa] 'you came'

2sg=come

c. /hi=tʲoma/

[hitsumɐ] 'you made'

2sg=make

d. /hi=tʲoka/ [hitsukɐ] 'you sat'

2sg=sit

17 It is interesting that the consonant /tʲ/ after a proclitic with /i/ was only found in nouns. In general the verbs with initial consonant /tʲ/ take the proclitics na=, wa=, za= instead of hi=, wi=, xi=.
70

The examples below are the only instances of /t/ changing to /ts/ in my corpus. In

(107b) and (107b), -t may be analyzed as a morpheme and not as part of the verb root

because causative constructions do not exhibit this morpheme. -t has also a very restricted

occurrence (i.e. only in these words).

(107) /t/-->[ts]/ i_e

2.7 Orthographic conventions
The working and practical orthographies are shown in Tables 9 and 10. In this dissertation, I will use the working orthography proposed here, based on my phonological analysis. There are two practical orthographies used in the Paresi schools. One orthography was proposed by Rowan & Burgess (1969), and it is used in the Nova Esperança community and in other communities in the same area. However, the communities in the other areas did not accepted this orthography. The other orthography was developed by two Paresi teachers Rony Paresi and Angelo Kezomae (2011) in the Rio Verde community (shown in Tables 9 and 10). As seen in Tables 10 and 11, it is an orthography based on the phonetic analysis, where the allophones are also represented.

The linguistic efforts of the researcher to solve some of the issues related to the orthographic representation are not advanced enough as to have a practical orthography
73

for all the communities. There are some political aspects in the process that allowed the researcher to only train teachers, so that they can have a better idea of how to write their language. Unfortunately, each community wants to have their dialect written in the way they speak it, and there is no agreement between the communities about the subject. Therefore, there are a number of challenges, but more work on this will be done in future research.
In addition, there is another working orthography proposed by Silva (2009) based on his phonological analysis. In this orthography, the sounds [lʲ], [ʃ], and [tʃ] are not represented orthographically because they are not considered to be phonemes in his analysis, and <l>, <z>, <ts> are written instead.

Chapter 3 - Morpheme categories and closed word classes
3.0 Introduction This chapter presents types of morphemes and closed word classes in Paresi. It is
organized into the following sections: §3.1, morpheme categories, §3.2 pronouns, §3.3 demonstratives, §3.4 indefinites, §3.5 quantification, §3.6 postpositions, §3.7 adjectives and adverbs, §3.8 interjections and ideophones.
3.1 Types of morphemes
Paresi is a relatively polysynthetic and agglutinative language, that is, its words consist of several morphemes with clear-cut boundaries (no fused formatives). It is also worth noting that these morphemes have some allomorphic variation. In the next sections, I will describe the morphophonological criteria for distinguishing words, affixes, clitics, and particles.
3.1.1 Definition of word A phonological word in Paresi is defined according to the following features:
pause phenomena, stress, and phonotactic constraints. A) pause phenomena Word boundaries may be marked by a pause. Dixon (2003) notes that the pause phenomena are not sufficient to demarcate all phonological words in a language, and this is the case with Paresi. B) stress Primary stress is a relevant cue to identify a word boundary. Phonological words in Paresi have a primary stress in the penultimate syllable. Polymorphemic words can have additional secondary stresses. In general, phonological words coincide with grammatical words. However, stress assignment shows an incongruity between grammatical and phonological words in compounds (see §4.4). C) phonotactic constraints
75

Some of the phonotactic constraints discussed in §2.1.4 (e.g. [l] cannot occur at the beginning of a word, [ɾ] is rare word-initially, etc) and morphophonemic processes seen in 2.6 , such as vowel reduction (which occurs only in word-final positions) help to define the boundaries of the phonological word.

3.1.2 Affixes Affixes can precede (prefixes) or follow a root (suffixes). There are 4 prefixes and
approximately 14 suffixes. The prefixes are shown in Table 12:

Form akamaz-

Table 12: Prefixes in Paresi Meaning causativizer attributive negative nominalizer

All prefixes occur with verbs, but ka- and ma- can also occur with nouns to derive stative predicates. There are five nominal suffixes, including morphemes for possession and plural, as shown in Table 12. The possession markers occur before the plural marker.

Table 14 shows verbal suffixes including morphemes for aspect, verbal number, and valency-changing morphemes.

In general suffixes are monosyllabic except for some of the aspectual markers,
and the reciprocal. The transitional suffix -hena can occur more than once in a word (but
not contiguously) to indicate the iteration of an action (see more discussion in §6.3).

3.1.3 Clitics
Clitics are grammatical words which are not complete phonological words (Dixon and Aikhenvald, 2002). The following properties of clitics defined in Zwicky and Pullum (1983) are used here to distinguish clitics from affixes in Paresi: i) clitics have low degree of selection with respect to their hosts, and ii) clitics but not affixes, can be attached to material already containing clitics. There are two types of clitics in Paresi: personal and clausal enclitics.

77

Person markers exhibit some properties of clitics: they have phonetic boundedness with their host (meaning they cannot receive stress) and they are in a external position relative to prefixes, which appear between the stem and the person marker. They also show variation in the type of hosts they can attach to: nouns, verbs, postpositions, numerals, quantifiers, and a few adverbs.

In Table 15, I present the personal clitics in Paresi. There are two types of proclitics, set A and set B (see discussion in §3.2.1). Personal proclitics from set A are used with nouns (to indicate the possessor) and with postpositions. Set A proclitics also occurs with a few non-agentive verbs, but with one difference: the third person singular is unmarked on verbs, but is marked by e=/i= on nouns and postpositions. Set B occurs with agentive verbs. The third-person object marker =ene is the only object used by verbs of both sets.

Other clitics in Paresi are clausal enclitics. They are illustrated in Table 16.

Clausal enclitics are unstressed morphemes, which occur in the second position.
As such, they can be attached to different word classes (nouns, verbs, adverbs, particles).
In (13), there is an example of the enclitic ite 'FUT' attached to an adverb.
(2) Makanika ite xiyane ama? makani -ka =ite xi= yane mama tomorrow ? =FUT 2pl go mom 'Will you all go tomorrow, mom?' (Batsaji iraiti)

In addition to the forms in Table 16, which are disyllabic, enclitics have reduced

forms: =ya 'IRR', =te 'FUT', =la 'FOC', =tyo 'TOP'. The initial vowel of enclitics is

dropped when it is similar to the final vowel of the host, as seen in (14). This

morphophonological process of like vowel elision only occurs with clitics.

'I will ask Leli later, if she can stay; I can leave the children with her' (Iraeti Batsaji)

In (14), the enclitics =ya, =tya and =tyo pile up. It is possible to combine up to three enclitics. The irrealis enclitic is always closer to the stem when in combination with discourse enclitics such as ala and atyo while the future enclitic is in the outmost position. The future and irrealis enclitics cannot occur together.
79

3.1.4 Particles Particles differ from clitics with regards to their integration with the word and
their position. These forms are phonologically independent morphemes which have their own stress, whereas clitics are unstressed. They do not take nominal or verbal morphology, and their functions are associated with modality, interrogation, negation, subordination, and discourse. In contrast to the clitics, which appear in second position, particles can occur in clause-initial position (in the case of modal and discourse particles), before the verb (negative and interrogative particles) or in clause-final position (subordinate particles). The particles hoka and hiyeta can be used as connectors or discourse markers. The different types of particles will be discussed in later sections: modals in 6.4, interrogative zoana in 7.4, negatives in 7.6, and subordinate and connector particles in 8.2. In Table 17, I provide a list of particles described in this work.

3.2.1 Personal clitics In this section, I describe the person clitics that are associated with the free forms.

The distribution of the two sets of subject pronominal markers, sets A and B, is
determined by semantics of the verb. Agentive verbs take set A markers, while non-
agentive verbs take set B for subject marking (see chapter 5); nouns and postpositions
take set B for possessor marking (§5.2). The only difference in marking subject and
possessor is in the third person, where verbs have zero realization (4), but nouns (5), and
postpositions (6) have e= (or its allomorphs).
(4) Ø=zaneheta Ø= zane 3sg go 'He went away.' (E)
(5) etsiri e= tsiri 3sg head 'his head.' (E)

18 Third person plural for verbs is marked by -ha, and for nouns is marked by -ha or -nae. The morpheme -nae is a general plural marker that occurs with nouns generally, not just with proclitics.
81

(6) ekakoa e= kakoa 3sg COM 'With him/her.' (E)

The proclitics have allomorphs where the last vowel of the proclitic is dropped (in first and second persons) or a consonant /n/ is inserted (in third person for nouns) when attached to roots starting with vowels. Then, because the allomorphs for both sets are the same, it is not possible to classify verbs starting with vowels into one of the sets A or B according to the type of proclitics they receive. In Table 19, the allomorphs with vowelinitial roots are shown.
In the first and second persons the clitics vowel is deleted (§2.6.4). In the third person for nouns, the form e= alternates with i= due to vowel harmony. e= has the allomorphes en= and ene=.19

The enclitic =ene '3O' is the only pronominal form marking an object.20 Proclitics
19 The allomorph ene= occurs with a few nouns. 20 Silva (2013: 97) has the form e= for third person subject and =<n>e for third person object. In the
object third person an n is inserted. He affirms n-insertion is a regular process seen also with the third person subject e=, which changes to en=/ene= in vowel-initial roots. Another analysis presented in Rowan & Burgess (1969) considers the third person subject and object to be derived from different forms, e and ene, respectively. A third analysis considers the original form for third person to be ene, and that there was deletion in the third person subject of consonant-initial roots. Data from other Arawak languages in Aikhenvald (1999) show that a form ni for third person object is found in most of
82

are obligatory on verbs and they can be used for subject cross-reference (7). The enclitic
for the third person object is not used for cross-reference, therefore a noun phrase cannot
co-occur with it, as seen in (8).

1sg ATTR food 3O fish

'I ate it (the fish).' (E)

Proclitics occur with non-verbal predicates, on nouns and adjectives or with the copula tyaona.

3.2.2 The anaphoric ha= The proclitic ha=21 expresses a correference between the third person possessor

and the subject of the clause. It has an endophoric reference, i.e, an expression in the same sentence or previous sentences (Bhat, 2004). Examples (9) and (10) from the same

text show that the antecedent of ha= in haiyanene 'her husband' is abebe 'grandmother',

which is mentioned in a previous sentence.

'My deceased grandmother ran, (and she asked): what (happened)? “We cut kaolone

honey”, I shouted.' (JT nawenane)

these languages. These last two analyses are plausible, but I follow here Rowan & Burgess' analysis because there is no evidence for a historical third person subject form ene=. 21 Aikhenvald (1999: 89) provides the proclitic ha= in Paresi as evidence for the proto-Arawak origin form *pa- 'impersonal'. The form pa is also found in languages such as Bahwana, Guajiro and Wapixana. Rowan & Burgess (1969) analyzesha= as the third person, and the e/i= prefixes as fourth person (or obviative, that is, a non-salient third person referent).

The examples below from the same text, a narration of the events of Frog, where

are you? (Mayer, 1969), illustrate the use of the anaphoric proclitic ha= and the third

person e=. In (11), ha= is used to make cross-reference between the possessor of the dog

and the subject of the clause Dirizonae.

If there are two possible antecedents in the same clause, the antecedent must be

the subject. The possessor of zotawa 'horn', the form ha=, can only have, as its

antecedent, the subject of the clause azama 'deer', and not the oblique argument expressed

by e=.

3.2.3 Personal pronouns The Paresi full pronouns are shown in Table 20. Free forms correspond to bound
pronouns plus the form atyo (reduced to tyo, with an allomorph tso).22 The third person has the same form as the demonstratives hatyo and eze, which modify nouns (see §3.3). The other personal pronouns cannot modify nouns. Interestingly, hatyo is similar to other pronouns because it also corresponds to a bound form, the proclitic ha= 'anaphoric third person'. Cross-linguistically it is not uncommon for the third person to be either identical to demonstrative pronouns or derivationally related to them (Bhat, 2004:132).

Silva (2013: 183; 194) considers hatyo to be a demonstrative distinct from personal pronouns. He supports his analysis with the following arguments: i) hatyo takes

-nae 'PL' with a plural or associative meaning, not for emphasis like pronouns, ii) it can

co-occur with other demonstratives, and iii) it can take the comitative -kakoa. I have not

found strong evidence for considering it to be different from other pronouns. -nae has the

plural/associative meaning with the third person and not other persons (where it is used

for emphasis) because in the other persons the plural is lexicalized. I have also not found

examples of hatyo or eze co-occurring as demonstratives with other demonstratives in my

corpus. Furthermore, it is not clear whether pronouns may occur with the postposition

kakoa 'comitative' similar to hatyo, as in (14). There are few examples of this

construction in my corpus (they often use the proclitic and the comitative), as seen in

(15).

Free pronouns marking subject are optional with verbs, and they can co-occur

with a coreferential proclitic for emphasis, (16) and (17), for contrastive focus (18), and

with the topicalizer atyo (19). For emphasis, in general they occur with the emphasis

The use of free versus bound pronouns with nominalized verbs depends in part on

the type of nominalization. For example, in a non-verbal predicate with the nominalizer

-tiye, a free pronoun must be used, as in (25). In a nominalized verb form with the

nominalizer -re, it is necessary to use a bound pronoun, and the free pronoun is optional,

as seen in (26).

Derivational processes applied to nouns are not applicable to pronouns. A number

distinction is lexically encoded in pronouns (except third person, see details on number in §4.2). However, the second plural person xitso with -nae 'PL' can indicate more than two addressees. 3.3 Demonstratives
Demonstratives are deictic expressions used to orient and focus hearers' attention on objects or locations in the speech situation, serving specific syntactic functions, and characterized by semantic features relative to a deictic center (Diessel, 1999: 2). In Diessel's typology, Paresi is a language in which the adnominal and the pronominal demonstrative forms are the same (used as independent pronouns in an noun phrase and as modifiers of a noun), and adverbial forms are distinct (as verb modifiers). There are four adnominal demonstratives and five adverbial demonstratives, as shown in Table 21. The deictic feature relative to distance is relevant for all of them, and visibility is relevant only for a few demonstratives. Some of the demonstratives also have a pragmatic function because of their anaphoric use in discourse, such as the discourse deictic demonstratives ezehare 'this thing' and hatyohare 'that thing', which are derived from adnominal demonstratives. I used Wilkins' demonstrative questionnaire (1999) to identify the uses of demonstratives in Paresi.

3.3.1 Adnominal demonstratives Demonstratives always precede nouns in a noun phrase. They are distinguished
for number, as seen in Table 21, and they can also have a classifier attached to them. Semantically, they encode information about the location of the referent relative to a deictic center taking into account the distance and visibility. Below I show the different types of adnominal demonstratives.

3.3.1.1

Proximal demonstrative

The form of the proximal demonstrative is eze with its variant eye. The

demonstrative eye is used when the form functions modifying a noun, and eze when

functioning as a pronoun. The latter is stressed and there is a pause after it, while the

former is not stressed and it is pronounced as one phonological word with the noun (29).

It refers to a referent within the immediate range of the speaker. In conversation, the form

is usually accompanied by a pointing gesture.

'This foot of partridge, this is the one that scares Celio.' (Tolohe)

The demonstrative eze does not exhibit agreement in number with the noun head.

In (29), the plural occurs in both appositional noun phrases, and in (30) the plural occurs

in the demonstrative because it is a noun phrase head. eze can also occur with a classifier

in an appositional noun phrase, as in (31).

In addition to the exophoric use of eze with reference to entities in the speech situation, the demonstrative also has an endophoric use, referring to elements in the discourse. According to Diessel (1999), endophoric uses can be subdivided into anaphoric, discourse deictics, and recognitional uses. The anaphoric use of hatyo and the discourse deictic use of hatyohare will be described in §3.3. The demonstrative eze is used to activate specific shared knowledge not mentioned in the preceding discourse
91

(recognitional use). For example, (32) is part of a conversation in which people discussed getting new clothes for a party in the village. The reference to a store known by the Paresi people in that village as lojinha ('little store' in Portuguese) is introduced by eye:
(32) Eye lojinha eye lojinha waowitereako eye lojinha eye lojinha w= aowi -te -re -ako this little. store this little. store 1pl say IFV NMLZ LOC 'It is in this little store we call lojinha.' (iraiti Batsaji)

When one of the speakers starts talking about my presence in the house (while I

was sleeping on a hammock), she uses the demonstrative eye in (33), even though I was

not previously mentioned in the discourse. Then someone else arrives in the house and

asks her who she is talking about, and again she uses eye, and clarifies that she is talking

about the non-Indian person.

A: eye mahalotihalo eye ma- haloti -halo this NEG Paresi FEM 'This non-Indian woman' (iraiti Batsaji)

Silva (2013) describes the existence of the form eege, saying the g indicates a voiced uvular obstruent. He analyzes eege as a proximate non-visual demonstrative. If that is the case, then the semantic feature of visibility is not only relevant to differentiate between the two distal forms eeze and etake, but also the proximate forms eze and eege. He also mentions the anaphoric demonstrative eetake, also not attested in my corpus. I

92

have not attested the forms eege and eetake in my texts, and more investigation is needed to confirm the existence of this other demonstrative. Silva concludes that the lengthening of the vowels is related to the feature [-visible]. However, the distal eeze, described below, has a long vowel and it indicates a visible referent. The description here then leads to the conclusion that the lengthening of the vowels is not related to visibility, but rather to distance.

3.3.1.2

Medial demonstrative: hatyo

The form hatyo 'that'25 is a demonstrative that refers to a referent that is near the

hearer but away from the speaker. Example shows the hearer was the deictic center.

(35) hatyo hibaberaza? hatyo hi= babera -za that 2sg paper POSSED 'Is that your book? (the book is in front of the addressee but not within speaker's reach).' (E)

(36) hatyo (or ẽeze) hiyerone?

ẽeze hi= zero -ne

that

yonder 2sg flute POSSED

'Is that your flute?' (where the referent is distant from speaker and in front of hearer)

(E)

It is interesting to notice that both forms hatyo and eeze are acceptable in (36).
eeze is used considering the speaker as the deictic center, while hatyo can also be used
considering that the hearer is close to the referent. Therefore, Paresi has a person-oriented
system.
Similar to the demonstrative eze, the demonstrative hatyo may exhibit number
marking (37), and it occurs with classifiers (38) when in an appositional noun phrase .
(37) hatyonae imitinae hatyo -nae ima -nae that PL cloth PL 'These ones, the clothes.' (E)
25 The demonstrative hatyo also occurs in cases in which the referent is equidistant from speaker and hearer, or is few meters away from hearer.

The demonstrative hatyo26 more frequently refers to a referent previously

mentioned in the discourse.27 Diessel (1999: 98) states that when a new discourse

participant is established as a topic, it is usually tracked by third person pronouns,

definite articles, or pronominal affixes on the verb. On the other hand, a discourse

participant previously introduced as a topic is tracked by demonstratives when it is

brought to focus a second time. In the sentences below from a conversation the new

information about imiti 'clothing' is introduced in (39), and after they changed the topic, it

is brought to the focus of attention again in (40) by the use of hatyo.

nakolatya

na= kolatya

1sg bring

'I will bring those clothes even if I do not pay.' (Batsaji tahi)

In the context as the head of an noun phrase, the demonstratives eze and hatyo have the function of third person pronouns. Similar to other personal pronouns, they occur with the emphasis marker -ta, (41) and (42), or topicalized by atyo (43).
26 This form may have originated from the anaphoric proclitic ha= and the topicalizer atyo, similar to the free pronouns natyo and hitso.
27 Silva (2013) does not call hatyo an anaphoric demonstrative, assigning this function to etake instead. However, he affirms hatyo can be used in the same contexts where etake is used, suggesting less of a functional distinction that he has elsewhere asserted.

Demonstratives as independent pronouns (head of a noun phrase) are also used in

the context of copular or nonverbal predicates, as a means of identification.

eze -nae hi= tsorare -ze

(45) hatyonae baba mama hatyo -nae baba mama 3sg PL dad mom 'Those are my father and my mother.' (Batsaji tahi)

The demonstratives occur with the nominalizer -hare (3.6.4) deriving the forms ezehare and hatyohare. They are discourse deictic forms that focus the hearers' attention on information expressed by a clause or sentence in the discourse. The difference between the two forms is not clear because both of them are used to track anaphoric information given in a prior clause, as seen in (46) to (48). However, ezehare can also be cataphoric, i.e, it can refer to the discourse that follows (48).

3.3.1.3

Distal demonstrative ẽeze

The form of the distal demonstrative is eeze. The form is different from the

proximate because of the lengthening and nasalization of the first vowel. Lengthening

and nasalization contrast is limited only to this form and the form ĩita 'distal adverbial

demonstrative'. This demonstrative is used to indicate a referent far away from the

speaker and the hearer, not accessible but still visible. I only found examples of eeze in

elicitation.

3.3.1.4

Non-visual etake

The form of the non-visual distal is etake. It refers to a referent that is far away,

not accessible to the speaker (and possibly not the hearer), and out of sight.

(51) eze etake zaheza

In addition, I have a few examples in which etake has a recognitional use, i.e.,

indicates the hearer is able to identify the referent based on shared knowledge (although

usually additional information about the referent may be provided in a relative clause) as

illustrated in (47).

'I planted that gift, of Zaloiya, the one our father talked about.' (tolohe)

97

I did not find examples in which etake is used anaphorically, as presented in Silva
(2013). It is not clear in the examples in his work whether etake has an anaphoric
function because he does not provide examples in which the referent was previously
mentioned in the discourse. Furthermore, some of the examples he gives have
recognitional uses instead of anaphoric uses. For example, in (54), etake can be used,
even though the referent was not previously mentioned in the discourse, because the
knowledge about the referent is shared by the speech act participants:
(54) etake awo etake awo that emu 'That emu.' (context: the one we saw in the savanna)

3.3.2 Adverbial demonstratives There are five locational deictics, indicating the location of an event or situation.
In general they occupy the first position in a clause.

3.3.2.1

The proximate ali 'here'

In example (55), ali is used with the noun maniya to indicate direction, similar to

a demonstrative. Example (56) shows it in a non-verbal predicate, and (53) in a negative

clause, where it can be negated by maiha and the negative focus particle xini.

3.3.2.2

The medial owene and ita

The adverbial demonstrative owene is used to indicate a medial position between

the speaker and the referent, as in examples (58) to (60).

Ø=ehokotyoita

'Right here there is something, a lot of them are sitting' (iraiti Katomo nali)

The demonstrative ita also indicates a medial position, and it is used in the same

context as owene. Example (61) follows the sentence where owene occurred, and both

have the same referent. The difference may be that in order to use ita the referent must be

equidistant from both speaker and hearer, while in order to use owene, the referent may

be close to hearer.

The distal nali 'there' and the distal ĩita 'there'

Examples (64) and (65) illustrate the use of nali 'there' while (66) and (67) of ĩita

'there'. The difference between the two distals is that ĩita is used when the referent is

visible. ĩita has the same vowel lengthening and nasalization as the form eeze, and both

forms indicate a referent far away from the speaker but visible.

3.4 Indefinites

3.4.1 Indefinite demonstratives There are two indefinite demonstratives hatya and haiya, which function as

independent pronouns and modifiers of a noun. Both indefinite forms are prehead

modifiers. They can be pluralized with -nae in the two syntactic contexts in which they

occur. The indefinite pronoun hatya28 has the meaning 'someone, somebody' when

occurring as an independent pronoun, as shown in (68). It also occurs modifying a noun

(as a determiner) with the meaning of 'another', as in (69) and (70), or with a meaning

similar to a indefinite article, referring to a referent that is not physically present, as in

(71).

3.4.2 Indefinite pronouns Indefinite pronouns are interrogative-based indefinites, that is, they are formed by
using the dubitative zamani or the negative maiha plus the indefinite forms. They will be described in §7.4.1.
3.5 Quantification

3.5.1 Numerals Numerals from one to four are lexical terms29 (Table 22), while numerals above

29 Silva (2013) analyzes hinama and hanama as etymologically composed of hi= 'second person' and ha=

'third person or other' plus the word nama 'quantity'. However, the motivation for the use of hi= and

ha= with these numbers is not clear. Evidence for the word nama is its use with kore 'arrow', as in the

example below:

zane zakore hiyaiya

korenama

zane zakore hi= yaiya kore -nama

go FRUST 2sg= see arrow quantity?

'he went to see the arrows.' (omati-ZK)

four follow a base-five system, using hands, feet, fingers, and toes (see Table 23). Portuguese numerals may be substituted for native numerals, especially above 'four'.

Numeral terms do not take the plural -nae, and the nouns they modify do not bear
this morpheme. Syntactically, numerals always precede the noun head, as in examples
(77) and (78). They are rarely used alone as the head of a noun phrase, as in (79) and
(80). 30 They can also occur with classifiers, as in (79) and (81).

Numeral terms hatita and zalakakoa may also be analyzed etymologically. hatita 'one' is composed of ha 'one' plus the morpheme -tita whose meaning is unknown; zalakakoa 'four' may be analyzed as a form composed by the interrogative zala 'who' and the postposition kakoa 'comitative', with the meaning of 'with someone'. 30 The noun phrase with the numeral is in apposition to the noun phrase with the noun konare, as shown by the use of the second clitic position ala between them.

Numerals above five are illustrated in Table 23. The first variant in table was collected with a speaker in the Formoso area, the second one is described in Eazokemae (2006), and the last one in Paresi & Januario (2011). 'Five' is represented with the same form that means 'hand'. 'Six through 'nine' are formed by using the words for 'hand' and 'fingers'. 'Ten is 'two hands' or 'entire, all hands'. From 'eleven' to 'nineteen' they also use the same strategy used from 'six' to 'nine', but in one of the dialects 'feet' and 'toes' are not used. Also, two of the dialects use the classifier hi 'CLF: long.slender' to refer to finger.

3.5.2 Quantifiers Paresi has the following non-numeral quantifiers: tyotya 'all', kahare 'many', inira
'few', and taita 'only'. Syntactically, quantifiers are very similar to demonstratives because they can occur in two syntactic contexts: as independent pronouns and as modifiers of nouns. However, they are different from demonstratives because they can take personal clitics (which are otherwise found on verbs) when used as a non-verbal predicates .

3.5.2.1

tyotya 'all'

The quantifier tyotya can precede or follow a noun in the noun phrase. Example

(89) illustrates the use of tyotya as a noun modifier preceding the noun, and (90) to (92)

as an independent pronoun which can be either a subject or an object argument. In (92),

tyotya occurs with the personal clitic wi= '1pl'.

3.5.2.2

kahare 'many, a lot'

The quantifier kahare can precede (93) or follow the noun (94). It can also occur

with countable and uncountable nouns. With uncountable nouns, the quantifier can

express an individuation-like meaning, as in (95), where it modifies speech meaning

'many words'. Example (96) is an example where kahare functions as an independent

pronoun.

3.5.2.3

inira 'few'

The quantifier inira, similar to other quantifiers, can modify a noun or function as

an independent pronoun. It precedes the noun in (99), and it occurs as an independent

pronoun in (100) and (101). When inira functions as an independent pronoun, it can take

the plural -nae (100).

quantifier has a different distribution from the other ones because it does not function as a

pronoun. The quantifier taita only was used as a non-verbal predicate in elicitation (104):

3.6 Postpositions
Paresi has a set of clitics which attach to nouns, and some of them also to personal clitics, and demonstratives, and they bear peripheral grammatical relations. There are two reasons why I consider this class to be postpositions instead of oblique markers in Paresi. First, they are clitics that are not integrated into their host, like suffixes. Secondly, in general, postpositions generally can be conjoined with a noun phrase (108), or take personal clitics (111). Other Arawak languages such as Yine (Hanson, 2010) and Apurinã

111

(Facundes, 2000) do not have postpositions, instead they have oblique markers. These oblique markers resemble postpositions, but they have phonological and/or syntactic and semantic properties that make them resemble case-markers.
Postpositional phrases often occur at the beginning of the clause, but they can also occur at the end or between the subject and the object, as shown in (105). I have not found cases where the postposition is between a subject or object and the verb. The 17 postpositions attested in my database are listed in Table 24. (105)

Postpositions show more similarity with nouns than verbs, suggesting that postpositions functioning as topological relators may derive from nouns. Almost all the postpositions, except nali 'in', ako 'inside', and koa 'in, on' can take personal clitics. They take set B proclitics, the same set used with all nouns and only some verbs. In addition, they can take the suffix -i '1sg' which occurs also with inalienable nouns and a few stative verbs (see §4.3.2). Postpositions belong to a different category from nouns, because they cannot take classifiers, nor can they take the unpossessed or possessed suffixes, like nouns can.
However, the use of body part nouns such as tyokoli 'buttocks, in the back', tiho

113

'face, in front of', and tanakoli 'cheek, on the side of' to indicate location without any
locative markers is further evidence that some postpositions may be result of a
grammaticalization process from nouns. A final bit of evidence for the nominal source is
that there are classifiers, such as ako and koa which have the same form as postpositions
(see §3.6)
(106) hati tyokoli hati tyokoli house buttocks 'In the back of the house.' (E)

The postpositions zema 'comitative', katyahe 'under', haliya 'around', koni 'in the

middle of', and ako 'inside' can also be incorporated into verbs (§ 5.3.3.3). In (107), the

postposition zema is incorporated into the verb tema 'run':

(107) natemazematya

na= tema =zema tya takoira

1sg= run =COM2 TH chicken

'I ran after the chicken.' (E)

3.6.1 Instrumental and comitative =kakoa The postposition kakoa has different meanings depending on the animacy of

entities. With inanimate nouns, kakoa expresses the instrument used by some agent or

actor.

'Dirizonae was living with his dog.' (Dirizonae)

The postposition kakoa may occur with the suffix -i '1sg', which also occurs with inalienable nouns and some stative verbs. The suffix -i '1sg' and the final vowel a (in first or second persons) may be dropped by some speakers. The paradigm for the irregular inflection of kakoa is given in Table 25.

According to Arkhipov (2009: 238) expressions in which an inanimate entity is

carried in close physical contact (such as in English: He came with a bag) may receive

the same marking used in comitative constructions. In Paresi, the comitative kakoa is also

used with inanimate referents when they are in close physical contact, the only difference

is the addition of the nominalizer -re31: kakoare.

In clauses with the verbs irai meaning 'speak', and iraitseakatya 'chat', the interlocutor is marked by kakoa.

31 Unlike the other postpositions in Paresi, which appear to derive historically from nouns, it is most likely that kakoa has as its source the reciprocal -kakoa. However, it is still not clear why the nominalizer is used with kakoa in this construction as nominalizers usually occur only with verbs.

A: Bitxinho kakoita Bitxinho kakoa =ta Bitxinho COM SOUR 'With Bitxinho.' (E)

3.6.2 zema 'accompanied by, follow (behind)' The postposition zema can also be interpreted as a comitative, meaning

'accompanied by'. In some examples, in addition to the comitative meaning, it means the

person is following (behind) someone (119). It is only used with animate nouns.

With personal clitics, zema undergoes vowel harmony triggered by the suffix -i in the first person, and also palatalization of the initial consonant /θ/ to /ʃ/. As seen with other nouns and verbs beginning with /θ/ (see §2.2.2), there is palatalization /θ/ > [j] when preceded by clitics with the /i/ vowel: hi=, wi=, and xi=. The paradigm for the irregular inflection of zema is given in Table 26.

3.6.3 ana 'dative' The postposition ana is a dative, marking the recipient or benefactor of an action:

(120) ezahe xityaninae

ana maika zatxiyakiyahetehena

ezahe x= ityani

-nae =ana maika za= txiyakiya -hete -hena

ehare eakere

ehare eakere

this so, then

'This (the tradition) you all should also pass on to your siblings.' (xihatyoawihaliti)

It can also mark a direction towards someone, similar to an allative, as in (121): 118

(121) nanoloka hoka abebe

ana nokaokehitita

na= noloka hoka abebe

=ana no= kaoke -heta -ita

1sg pull CON grandmother DAT 1sg arrive PERF IFV

'I pulled it (the fish) and then I arrived to my grandmother's house.' (JT nawenane)

With personal clitics, ana has an irregular inflection as shown in Table 27. There is a linking morpheme -om- between the clitics and the postposition. According to Silva (2013:295), the diachronic irregularity started in the first person, where the input no=ani had an output no=mani after the epenthesis of /m/ (a /n/ that assimilated the labial feature of the /o/ vowel). Then the -om form in the first person was spread to the other persons by analogy. Epenthesis of /n/ is a process seen also with the proclitics e= and en= for third person. If it was not for this irregularity, the expected form would be n=ani, as the vowels of the clitics are dropped when attached to vowel-initial roots.

3.6.4 hiye 'benefactive' The postposition hiye 'benefactive' can be used with animate referents of utterance

verbs, as illustrated in (124) and (125); with non-verbal predicates related to physical

phenomena, as in (126) and (127), or statives, as in (128); and with inanimate referents

as in (129) and (130).

3.6.5 nali 'general location' The postposition nali marks a general location with toponyms, such as the name of a
village (131) or the name of a place (132).

It can also occur with a proper noun to indicate the place where the person lives

121

(133). It is possible that the source of this form is the adverbial demonstrative nali 'there',

which modifies verbs and generally occurs clause-initially, while the postposition occurs

with nouns. Different from other postpositions, nali cannot take personal clitics.

Postpositions may have a nominal source, as stated above. However, katyahe may originate from the verb katyaha 'flatten'. Another possibility is that the verb was derived
122

from the postposition, but there are no other cases like that in my corpus.

3.6.8 heno 'above, on top' The postposition heno is a contact locative meaning 'above, on top'. Here it is

important that the figure (the theme or trajector) is in contact with the horizontal surface

of the ground (the object with respect to where the theme is located).

3.6.12 ako 'inside of a deep container' The meaning of the postposition ako is 'inside of a deep container'. This

postposition derives from the classifier ako 'CLF: inside.' (see §4.5). As seen in example

(150), ako cannot be used when the figure is on a concave surface. In the corpus, the only

personal proclitic found with it was the third person, as shown in (152).

'CLF: flat.' (see §4.5).

3.6.15 koni 'among' The postposition koni means 'among'. The form used with personal clitics is

irregular because of the linking morpheme -ne (which may be inserted, similar to the

It is possible to argue that the irregularity started in the third person through analogy with nouns such as koko 'uncle' (hikoke 'your uncle, enekoke 'his uncle') where there is a ne in the third person. This irregularity then spread to the other persons. In the persons with the vowel i the ne is realized as ni because of vowel harmony. This diachronic explanation is similar to the one provided by Silva (2013) for the -om syllable used with the postposition ana. The only difference is that with ana the irregularity started in the first person and with koni in the third person.

katyala 'sour', timena 'heavy'), age (waitare 'old') and value (waiye 'good'). These words

share properties with stative verbs in that they take personal proclitics and verb inflection.

In (168), the stative verb kirane 'small' takes the proclitic no= '1sg' from set B. Example

(169) shows the stative verb kalore 'big' taking the suffix -ta 'imperfective' (an allomorph

of -ita which occurs only with statives) with a meaning of temporariness.

Paresi adjectives can function as modifiers of nouns without any additional

morphology, different from verbs which need the nominalizer -re to serve this function.

Adjectives, as defined by Croft (2000), are prototypically a modifier referring to a

property, and will be unmarked in this function.

According to Brandão (2009), Paresi adjectives seem to modify nouns with or

without the nominalizer, as in examples (170) and (171) respectively. However,

adjectives with a nominalizer are better analyzed as being in an appositional noun phrases

than as modifiers of nouns. Evidence for considering this construction as composed of

two appositional noun phrases is that both timenere and the noun kaxali can take the

nominal plural -nae: kaxalinae timenerenae 'the boxes, the ones that are heavy'.

3.7.2 Adverbs Adverbs are defined as “modifiers of constituents other than nouns” (Schachter &
Shopen, 2007: 20). In Paresi, they function as modifiers of predicates and as predicate heads. As modifiers, they do not take inflectional morphology, but as predicates they take some verbal morphology such as personal proclitics and aspect marking. Generally, time adverbs are clause-initial, but some of them can also occur before the verb, and few can occur at the end of a clause.
Temporal adverbs are important to give the time reference in a clause. When there are no present or past tense markers, the use of time adverbs is the only indication of time in a clause. Most of these temporal adverbs are monomorphemic, but kafaka 'yesterday' and makani 'tomorrow' can take the irrealis iya, the transitional -hena, and the classifier -tse 'CLF:small' meaning 'few days' before or after the present time, respectively. Paresi time adverbials are shown in Table 29.

The adverb kalini means 'now, today, nowadays'. It can occur as modifier of a

predicate as in (173) and (174), or as a predicate head in nonverbal predicates, as in (175)

where it is negated by the negative focus xini. There is another form with the same

meaning: kalikini (176). I have not found differences between kalini and kalikini, which

are described in Silva (2013) to be “today” and “now” respectively.

The adverb kafaka refers to the day before the utterance time (177). It can also

refer to few days before yesterday together with the expression haiya zowakiya 'some

For a period further back in the past, the classifier -tse 'small' with the meaning of 'few days' is attached to kafaka 'yesterday'. It can refer to few days ago, as in (179) where kafakatse is used with the meaning 'recently'. It can also refer to years ago, as in (180), where kafakatse 'some days in the past' occurs with the expression kalini witxiyehenere

The adverb kafaka 'yesterday' occurs in the form kafakiya which is rarely found in

my corpus. The iya may be analyzed as the irrealis marker (similar to the use of iya with

makani). kafakiya indicates a period in the past before yesterday:

There is also only one example where kafaka 'yesterday' functions as the head of a predicate, and it takes verb morphology, the transitional -hena.

The adverb makani refers to an event that happened posterior to the day of the

utterance time (185), and similar to kafaka 'yesterday', it can also refer to a time after

tomorrow when used with the irrealis iya (186) and (187), or the word kamaitali 'another

kozaita describes an event that occurred in the same day as the utterance time. It

occurs only as a modifier of a predicate in clause-initial position as in (189), and before

or after the verb. There are few occurrences of this adverb in my corpus.

Other temporal adverbs are awitsa 'later, soon', weta 'early', (k)ozaka 'already', and
mene/minita 'always'. The lists I provided here are as complete as possible with the
current corpus, but other temporal adverbs may be identified with further research.

The words in the table above function chiefly to modify verbs or sentences. Some of them are compounds that have a transparent morphology. They also may occur as predicate heads, taking some verb morphology (for example the transitional -hena).
To illustrate some of these adverbs, I will show examples from the text Hitsehaliti that tells how the Paresi ancestor made their traditional festivals. As seen in (195), (198) and (199), the adverbs ferakoa 'day', wahazati 'midnight', totahikoa 'midday' are used as nonverbal predicates.

I analyze adverbs as a separate class distinct from verbs or nouns. Although some

adverbs look like they have frozen verbal morphology (adverbs ending with -oa, which

resemble the middle voice morpheme), they do not take most of the verbal morphology

which is typical of verbs, such as personal clitics and valency-changing morphology, and

they function differently. Some adverbs look like nouns, as for example wahazati

'midnight', where -ti resembles the unpossessed marker used with nouns, and it can be

used as an argument in the clause, as in (202). However, adverbs cannot be pluralized,

nor can they take postpositions like nouns can.

In the lexicon Silva (2013) provides, the words ferakoa and maka are listed as 140

verbs meaning 'grow light' and 'grow dark' respectively, while makiya and wahazati are

listed as nouns meaning 'night' and 'midnight' respectively. However, in the examples I

have, the noun zatini 'night' occurs instead of makiya, as shown in (203). It is possible

that makiya can also occur in this context but more work is needed to clarify this.

3.7.3 Relation between adverbs, adjectives an stative verbs Stative verbs and adjectives in Paresi can modify nouns as well as other verbs,

functioning as manner adverbs or adverbs of intensity. The most common adjectives

modifying other verbs in my corpus are: kalore 'big', waiye 'good', and waha 'long'; the

most common stative verbs in this function are: kinatya 'be strong', hazerore 'be fast',

howitihare 'be difficult'. As adverbs, they precede the verb they modify as shown in the

examples below from (205) to (208), and follow the verb when they are used as

modifiers, as in (204) (§5.2.1.3). This is also attested by Silva (2013:336) who says

statives at the left of a predicate can only modify the predicate, not the noun.

Similar to other adverbs, statives and adjectives in this function may also occur

clause-initially (209), and can occur with the transitional -hena (210). The example in

(211) is the only example (in my corpus) of a adjective that occurs following the

modified verb.

3.8 Interjections and ideophones
3.8.1 Interjections According to Ameka (2006:743), interjections are “words that conventionally
constitute utterances by themselves and express a speaker's current mental state or
142

reaction towards an element in the linguistic or extralinguistic context”. Formally, in Paresi, interjections do not take affixes and are generally monomorphemic. This class includes words expressing emotions, response words, words directed at animals, and words and expressions used in specific ritual contexts.

3.8.1.1

The form aka or akãi pronounced with a nasalized vowel is used to express pain:

The forms hãa or hũ, both with nasalized vowels, are used for agreement or to

show that the hearer is listening. In the conversation below, the daughter is telling the

mother the date of a party in the village, and the mother responds with hãa showing

agreement with what the daughter said.

3.8.2 Ideophones Ideophones are defined as words that vividly represent sounds/sensory events
(Voeltz & Hatz, 2001). As defined by Dingemanse (2009), ideophones differ from interjections because they are not 'response cries', that is, they do not index stances to events in the immediate context of the speech event (similar to direct reactions). In Paresi, phonologically, they can exhibit vowel lengthening and nasalization (as seen also with interjections), and usually there is reduplication of syllables (except when the action referred to by the ideophone is punctual). Ideophones appear in a post-verbal position, and sometimes before the quotative verb nea 'say'. Only the ideophone tsaboo occurs as a predicate.
Another characteristic is that these words are often used in storytelling. Most of the examples I found in my corpus come from two main traditional stories: Txinikalore (Txinikalore is a monster who killed the parents of three children who later exact their revenge), and Wazare, the Paresi creation myth. All of these forms are sound-related, as will be illustrated below. Except for the widely-used zoi zoi and tsoboo, ideophones do not appear to be conventionalized and may be spontaneously created by speakers. In Table 31, I present a list of the ideophones found in my corpus.

The ideophone ke ke is used to describe the action of shooting with an arrow and

zoi zoi describes the action of shooting in general. In the examples (226) and (227), zoi

zoi is used by different speakers, therefore it is a conventionalized form. In the first two

examples they describe the sound of shooting an arrow, and in (227) zoi zoi was also used

by another speaker to describe the sound of shooting a gun.

action of cutting something with a knife-like instrument, as in (229), while tsok tsok is
used in another narrative told by another speaker, to describen cutting with an axe (230).
The type of instrument used in the action is lexically encoded in the verb, but the
ideophones emphasize it.

Chapter 4 - Nouns and nominal morphology
4.0 Introduction In this chapter the noun class, nominal morphology, and the noun phrase will be
defined and described structurally and functionally. Nouns in Paresi exhibit distinctions in number and types of possession. They can also function as arguments of predicates or postpositions. First I present a definition of noun root and noun stem, then I describe the nominal category of number (§4.2). Then, I describe the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession in §4.3, the process of noun compounding in §4.4, noun classification in §4.5, and nominal derivation in §4.6. The noun phrase is discussed in §4.7. Noun incorporation will be described in another chapter §5.3.3.1.
4.1 Noun roots and stems 4.1.1 Noun roots
Noun roots can occur without modification, or be bound, if they only occur with other morphemes like possessor marker or another nominal root (see inalienable nouns §4.3.1).
Most of the nouns are two syllable roots, and there are few nominal roots with more than three syllables. Some of these longer roots have reduplicated syllables (as the example kololokare 'type of anu bird). Longer roots appear to be fossilized root-suffix combinations. For example, tamitsone 'sister-in-law', hawaretse 'peccary', and tanakoli 'cheek' appear to contain the possessed suffix -ne and the classifiers -tse 'CLF:small' and -li 'CLF:round', respectively, see Table 32 for more examples.
153

hawaretse

young brother

kololokare

There are a few phonological restrictions at the beginning of words, as for example, few noun roots begin with the syllables e, wi or xi. These restrictions may be due to their similarity with personal clitics wi= '1pl', xi= '2pl' and e= '3sg'.

4.1.2 Inherent reduplication
The noun roots listed below involve repetition of phonological segments in which it is not possible to identify the meaning of the reduplicated form. The process generally occurs with onomatopoeic forms that denote animals (specially birds). According to the traditional definition of reduplication these reduplicated form are not “true reduplication”.
This definition excludes forms which do not have non-reduplicated counterparts. Paresi, then, has cases of lexicalized reduplication in which non-reduplicated forms either have been lost or never existed, as is often the case with symbolic (often onomatopoeic) reduplicative forms. Inherent reduplication concerns these reduplicated forms where no independent base can be identified (Van der Voort and Gomez, forthcoming). Therefore I treat the reduplicated forms in Paresi as “inherent reduplication”.
In Table 32, I give some examples of inherent reduplication.

4.1.3 Noun Stems A noun stem is formed by a noun root and possessed suffixes (§4.3.2) and/or
nominalizer suffixes. The structure of the noun word is shown in (1). The noun word includes the possessor, the noun stem, the plural and/or postpositions. This is illustrated in example (2). (1) Possessor+[{ROOT +{UNPOSS/ POSSED}]stem+PL+POSP

4.2 Number
4.2.1 The plural/associative -nae In Paresi, plural forms of nouns and nominal forms may be marked by the form
-nae. However, the plural is only obligatorily marked with humans, as in (3) through (5). The morpheme -nae may also be used as an associative.32
32 Silva (2013) calls it “augmentative collective”. He says that it refers only to a group of four or more elements. Because of this, he does not consider -nae to be a plural.

In contrast to the collective toli (see 4.2.2), -nae when occurring with humans

does not have a collective meaning. For example, in (6), the noun haliti 'Paresi person' is

used with toli meaning 'spatially contiguous group of people ', while with -nae (7) the

meaning is non-collective, i.e., it refers to the Paresi individuals in each village (therefore

a non-contiguous group) who are working in the health service system.

Plural marking is not obligatory with nouns referring to animals or inanimates.

These are more frequent with the collective toli. (8) and (9) illustrate the occurrences of

the plural with nouns for animals: awo 'emu' and kohatse with -nae. Examples (9) and

(10) illustrate occurrences of the plural with nouns for inanimate referents: iye 'flower'

and kahe 'hand'. In (9) kohatsenae 'fish (PL)' refers to animals that perform human

In general uncountable or mass nouns do not occur with -nae. The noun one 'water' is pluralized only when taking the classifier -za meaning 'river': onezanae 'rivers'. Demonstratives (12) (see §3.3) do not take the plural when in a noun phrase modifying a noun, even when the nouns themselves are marked with -nae. They only take plural when functioning as the head of an noun phrase, as in (13) to (15). Numerals are not marked for

157

the plural, and they do not require a pluralized noun (see § 3.5.1).

In addition, the plural marker must occur with the demonstrative hatyo when

functioning as third person for plural reference, as in (16). The plural may also occur with

other persons such as the second person plural xitso (17). However, plural marking is

optional in these cases (and is used to emphasize plurality of the reference (see §3.2.3)

since the plural is lexically specified in personal pronouns.

4.2.2 The collective toli A collective morpheme indicates that a group of items is considered together
rather than individually (Corbett, 2000:118). The collective toli33 is used to indicated the
collective nature of a group or pile of spatially contiguous things. The collective toli
follows the noun. The source of this form probably is the noun (e)toli 'all, pile', as in (25)
and (26).
(25) etoli wawenakala witso Enomaniere etoli wa= wenakala witso Enomaniere all 2pl village 1pl Enomaniere 'All the land was our village, ours, of we the Enomaniere.' (Formoso onetse)
33 Silva (2013: 193) considers toli a noun meaning 'group'. I agree that there is a noun etoli meaning 'pile, group' which is the source of the collective. However, distributional evidence suggests that toli has also been grammaticalized as a quantifier.

Collectives may co-occur with number markers, they are never obligatory, and

they are typically formed from nouns low on the Animacy Hierarchy (Corbett, 2000:118).

The collective toli can be used with kinship terms, both when referring to humans (27)

and animals (28). It can also be used with nouns referring to animals, as shown in (29)

and (30). In the same text from where the expression kohatse toli 'pile of fish' in (30)

comes, the form kohatse 'fish' is also used with the plural -nae. The difference of using

toli or -nae may be related to the numbers of elements in a group (toli is used with a

larger number). The difference may also be related to how the speaker wishes to conceive

the noun phrase, as one thing, i.e. kohatse-nae was a group of individuated fish talking to

each other, while kohatse toli is some undifferentiated mass of fish. In (31), toli occurs

without a noun, and the last vowel of the collective is lengthened to express the surprise

of seeing the large amount of tapirs.

In addition, the collective toli is used with mass nouns that can be grouped
together in a pile, as in (32). Some substances, such as one 'water', can only bear toli if
they appear with the marking of possession, forcing an interpretation of 'water' as 'a
container of water' (33).

4.3 Possession Paresi distinguishes between types of alienable and inalienable possession. Nouns
162

can be classified into three types: inalienable (bound nouns), alienable nouns, and nonpossessable nouns. In Paresi, alienable nouns are more morphologically marked than inalienable ones in possessive constructions. This morphological marking follows a prediction by Haiman (1983:795) that “in no language will the phonological expression of inalienable possession be bulkier than that of alienable possession”.

4.3.1 Inalienable nouns Inalienable nouns are inherently possessed: they must take a possessor (a personal
clitic or another nominal root) when possessed, or the unpossessed suffix -ti when
unpossessed. These nouns are also bound nouns, in the sense that they do not occur as
free constituents. Inalienably possessed nouns only appear without the unpossessed
marker -ti when in compounds with other nouns. (see §4.4). In a compound, the
possessor, a noun, precedes the possessed noun which is the head of the noun phrase, as
seen in (34). The possessors can also be personal clitics, and the same forms used with
nouns to mark possessors mark the subjects of set B verbs (except for the third person,
see §3.2.1). These forms are shown in Table 34.

Silva (2013) treats kinship terms as inherently possessed, i.e., without unpossessed forms. However, speakers gave the unpossessed forms shown in Table 37. Kinships terms do not occur in their unpossessed forms with the unpossessed suffix -ti like other nouns (e.g.: *txiyityo-ti 'granddaughter'). However, in elicitation, speakers provided unpossessed kinship terms with -kati (see Table 37). This form may be segmented into two suffixes, one is the suffix -ka, which does not occur with other inalienable nouns, and the other is the unpossessed suffix -ti. The meaning of -ka is not clear.

In addition to possessors and the unpossessed form, inalienable nouns can also take another suffix when possessed. The agreement suffix -i '1 sg' co-occurs with the first person proclitic no=, and it is attached to some inalienable nouns, postpositions and a

165

few stative verbs. This suffix is attached to inalienable nouns35 ending with the vowel /a/36 or /e/ (with some exceptions). The final the vowels /a/ and /e/ are deleted when the suffix is attached (§2.6.4), as shown in Table 38.

The words ola 'game' and ima 'clothing' are also in this group. However, their unpossessed forms are not *ola-ti and *ima-ti as expected; instead their forms are oli-ti and imi-ti. A possible explanation for this irregularity is that the suffix -i was lexicalized in the unpossessed forms of these words (*olati → oliti (from noli 'my game'), *imati → imiti (from nimi 'my clothing)).
Finally, a few inalienable nouns have a suppletive unpossessed form. Table 39 shows the suppletive possessed forms of the nouns irikati 'fire' and hati 'house' and of some vocative kin terms (which are always unpossessed).37

35 Silva (2013) analyzes this form as person agreement marker for the first person in alienable nouns. In contrast to his analysis, I consider -i to be part of the possessed forms.
36 Instrumental nominalizations are also in this group because the last vowel of the instrumental nominalizer -kala.
37 Not all vocative kin terms have a suppletive possessed form, such as aze 'my oldest brother (voc.)', and en=azenanane 'his oldest brother'.

4.3.2 Alienable nouns Alienable nouns are free noun roots that are optionally possessed, and do not
occur with the unpossessed marker -ti (with few exceptions). When they are possessed, they must occur with the possessor and one of the three subsets of possessed suffixes shown in Table 40. The choice of the subsets of possessed suffixes is in part semantically conditioned. The three suffixes show grammatically conditioned allomorphy in which the first person singular differs from the other persons. The morpheme -za changes to -xi,-la to -li and -ne to -ni. This allomorphy in the first person also appears with the phonologically conditioned allomorph -ra described in the next paragraph, but not with -ye, and it is not clear what motivates the exception.

3p e= /e=maha-za/ /e=kozeto-la/ /e=haira-ne/

The analysis presented here is different from the one in Silva (2013). In his work, he considered the alienable nouns to be less morphologically marked. According to him,

167

they take the possessors and the agreement suffixes -i and -e. In addition, the consonants occurring before the agreement suffixes n, z, r, and l are called latent consonants, which he considers part of the root, surfacing only when the suffixes are attached to the roots.38 Here is an example illustrating his analysis: (37) nohitone
no= hito<n> -i 1sg bow conc.1sg 'my bow.' (Silva, 2013:159)
(38) ehitone e= hito<n> -e 3sg bow conc 'his bow.' (Silva, 2013:159)
The suffix -i, which Silva treated as first person agreement marking, is phonologically conditioned in inalienable nouns, as in §4.3.1. In alienable nouns, there is no phonological condition based on the root ending, as there is a consonant between the root ending and /i/ (the consonants /n/, /θ/, /ɾ/, /l/). One hypothesis is that the /i/ diachronically was an agreement suffix for the first person with all nouns, postpositions and stative verbs, but today /i/ does not indicate first person in all nouns; its occurrence is restricted to roots or suffixes ending in /a/, or in /e/ (with exceptions).39 Furthermore, the analysis of latent consonants neither takes into account the neutralization between /l/ and /r/ after /e/ which only occurs at morpheme boundary, nor does it accounts for the semantic conditions (described below) driving the choice among the alienable suffixes.
Payne (1991: 378-379) reconstructed five genitive suffixes for Proto-Arawak which he named Proto-Maipuran: *-ne, *-te, *-re, *-i> -e, and *-Ø. According to Payne, *-ne is the most common possessive suffix and *-te applies to a more restricted set of nouns, while the other suffixes are quite restricted. The only clear reflex of these in Paresi is -ne. According to Aikhenvald (2012: 167) these allomorphs tend to be
38 He does not present a motivation for considering them part of the root. 39 To differentiate noun roots ending with a from verb roots, which generally end in a.
168

semantically conditioned across Arawak languages, such that some suffixes apply to cultural artifacts, others to animates, others to loanwords, and so on). However, in Paresi, the choice of suffixes is not completely determined by semantic principles. Animacy may determine the suffix choice; most animate nouns take the possessed suffix -za, though inanimate waiholoko 'the tip of an arrow' and tsehali 'stone'). Nouns referring to inanimates take the suffix -ne. Other nouns take -la.
In addition, the two possessed suffixes -za and -la also show phonologically conditioned allomorphy in all persons. The phonologically conditioned allomorphy occurs when nouns ending with the /i/ vowel appear with the -ye suffix instead of -za. Palatalization changes /θ/ to /j/, triggered by the final high vowel, and raising of the vowel /a/ to /e/ results in -ye. Nouns ending in the front vowels /i/ or /e/, in the group taking -la, instead exhibit the allomorph -ra, as illustrated in Table 41.40

I will introduce each morpheme and give more examples in Tables 42 to 44. Table 42 shows some examples of 45 nouns in my corpus that take the suffix -za ~-ye. As illustrated in (39), the alienable noun maha 'honey' requires the suffix -za when possessed, and it occurs unmarked when unpossessed, as in (40):

40 This allomorphy may be due to neutralization between /l/ and /ɾ/ when it is both preceded by [a] or [o] vowels and followed by [i], an environment which occurs in the first person, and may have been spread by analogy to the other persons.

It is important to notice that the forms of the possessed suffixes -za and -ri are homonymous with the classifiers -za 'CLF:liquid' and -ri 'CLF:round'. With a few nouns, the choice of suffix may also be conditioned semantically by the shape or consistency of the possessed referent. For example, the noun maha 'honey' may take the possessive suffix -za because it has a liquid consistency, same as warekoahoza 'stream' and timelaza 'blood'. Nouns whose referents have a round shape (mainly vegetables) such as kozeto 'corn' and komata 'beans' take -la/-li (or -ra/-ri).
On the other hand, homonymy avoidance delimits the possibilities of occurrences of possessed suffixes. Alienable nouns do not take possessed forms that make them similar to inalienable noun roots ending with syllables za, la, or ne. For example, the alienable noun matse 'ground' has the possessed form: matse-za. This noun root cannot take the suffix -ne, otherwise the form derived will be homophonous with the inalienable noun matsene 'field'.41

41 Though 'someone's ground' is a tempting etymology for 'field', matsene cannot be analyzed as matse-ne synchronically since as an inalienable noun, it accepts the unpossessed suffix, i.e. matsene-UNPOSS.

Generally, each noun regularly occurs with a particular possessed suffix. However, in elicitation speakers also accepted the uses of about twenty nouns with other possessed suffixes, without a change in the meaning. In Table 47, examples of these nouns are given (the first possessed form is the most common one). There is no general consistency among speakers about using these nouns with more than one suffix. For example, one speaker accepted the uses of halate-ne and halate-za as the possessed forms of halate 'comb', but another speaker only accepted halate-ne, the most common form. There may be subtle differences in meaning depending on the choice of the suffix, for example, the noun zoima 'child' with -la, as in no=zoima-li 'my child', which has a different meaning with -ne, as in no=zoime-ne 'my childhood'.

There are other irregularities to the pattern seen. The obligatorily possessed nouns in Table 48 take one of the three possessed sufixes -za, -la, -ne when possessed, and they take the unpossessed suffix -ti when unpossessed. Among these nouns, there are nominalized verbs (nominalized by a zero morpheme, see § 4.6.1), as shown in (43).

Table 49 shows another irregularity: nouns that take the unpossessed suffix and the possessed suffixes -ra or -ne at the same time.42 The change in the form indicates the change in the semantic possession of the nouns from a inherent possession to conferred ownership. For example, the noun ete-ti 'meat' is the unpossessed form of the inalienable noun ete 'flesh of', and it takes the suffix -ra to form ete-ti-ra 'meat of someone'. The suffix -ra is used with body parts, and -ne with personal belongings. As a nonprototypical body part, 'blood' may receive either suffix.

42 This is a near exhaustive list in my corpus, but there may be more nouns.
175

Another irregularity is that a few alienable nouns referring to objects take the suffix -tini, which may be analyzed as the unpossessed suffix -ti and the possessed suffix -ne. They are derived from the inalienable body-part nouns referring to where these objects are worn.

4.3.3 Non-possessed nouns Non-possessed nouns include proper names of people (Zezokiware, Aezokero,
Kezokero, Kezokenaece) or of places (Batsaji, Hohako, Owihoko), and natural elements (e.g.: kamae 'sun', kaimare 'moon', zoretse 'star'). Natural elements may be possessed in some contexts; for example, zoretse 'star' can be optionally possessed (no=zoretse-ri) if it refers to a drawing of a star or an artefact in the form of a star. Therefore, the constraint is related to the pragmatics.

43 The word maka is related to the word amaca 'fish net' in Taíno (an Arawak language) which is the origin of the word hamaca 'hammock' in Spanish.
176

4.3.4 The possessive constructions with kaAnother way to express possession in Paresi is the use of constructions with the

attributive prefix ka-. In Paresi, ka- derivation is used to derive predicates, as with

predicative kinship possession (44). According to Aikhenvald (2012), one of the most

stable functions in Arawak languages is that the prefix ka-, which can derive possessive

adjectives and predicates. I will describe possessive predicates with ka- in 7.3.3.

4.4 Nominal compounds Compound nouns are nouns composed of two or more noun roots, which can be
unbound or bound. All pairings of bound and unbound nouns (i.e. bound-bound, boundunbound) are possible. The unbound-bound combination, in which the bound noun has a classifying function (§4.4.1), is the most common type. The three types of compounds are illustrated in (45) through (48). In compounds, the first noun is the modifier and the second one the head. In compounds in which both nouns are bound roots, if the second bound root is vowel-initial, then a consonant /n/ is used as a morpheme linking the nouns (47). The only example I have of a compound with three bound roots is in (48).

Considering a definition of phonological word based on stress domain (Dixon,
2003), compounds with free nouns form two phonological words because they maintain
their lexical stress in both nouns. Compounds with only bound nouns, in which the
second noun has a classifying function, form just one phonological word. The main stress
is the stress of the classifying bound root, while the stressed syllable in the first noun
receives a secondary stress (see §2.5).
Only the second noun in the compound can be marked for plural, as in (49) and
(50). With regards to inalienability, I have a few examples of alienably possessed
compounds, and they take the possessed suffix -za/-ye on the second noun, as in (51) and
(52).
(49) kamae kokoiyanae kamae kokoi -nae sun hawk PL 'harpy eagles'
(50) zohityakatenae zohitya -kate -nae cashew tree.of PL 'cashew trees'

(52) ehana

tyokoliye

e= hana tyokoli -ye

3sg house buttocks POSSED

'the back of his house'

Semantically, compounds may express a possessor-possessed, part-whole or entity-
property relationship. In (53), the possessor-possessed relationship is illustrated where the
first noun is the possessor and the second the possessed.
(53) Fabio ene matsene Fabio =ene matsene Fabio PST field 'The field of the deceased Fabio.' (ximatyati)

Paresi also exhibits the possessive mechanism for meronymy (part-whole

relation), in which the first noun refers to the 'whole' and the second one to the 'part'.44

Body parts are used metaphorically referring to a part of an inanimate referent, and even

to the spaces associated with those body parts. In (54) the word for 'arm' has its meaning

expanded to refer to 'branch'; in (55) and (56) b the body parts tyokoli 'buttocks' and kilihi

'nose' had their meaning expanded to refer to the spatial relations 'back' and 'side'.

However, only the plant parts -tse 'seed.of',' -hi 'fiber.of', and -li 'fruit.of' have a

metaphorical use (see description in §4.5).

Other compounds express entity- property relationship, as in examples (57) to

(59). The first noun is the entity and the second noun is the property/modifier.

4.4.1 Types of compounds There are two types of compounds in Paresi: lexicalized and productive

compounds. The first type includes exocentric compounds (with a meaning distinct from

the meaning of their parts) and compounds formed by a noun and a word from another

class. Productive compounds, on the other hand, are formed by a noun and a classifying

bound noun.

Exocentric compounds have meanings totally or partially different from the

meanings of their parts (Aikhenvald, 2007). In Paresi, these compounds are generally

names for animals, as shown in examples from (60) to (63). The semantic relationship the

in the compound are not entirely transparent (except in (60) where 'emu's gut'

metaphorically refers to the shape of the snake).

beetle hawk POSSED?

(63)

ohiro aotse 'womanizer.' (lit.: 'the place of the woman')

ohiro aotse

woman place

Another type of lexicalized compounds are formed by a noun, joined with a verb,
a postposition, or ideophone. In compounds with verbs, the verb comes first and the noun
is either a body part, (64) and (65), or the noun one 'water' (66). The whole compound is
nominalized by the nominalizers -re or -kala 'instrumental nominalizer'. In (65), a noun
combines with a postposition, and in (66) with an ideophone:
(64) aliyo zolakitakotyoakalati aliyo z- ola ki- tako -tyoa -kala -ti where.is NMLZ tie ? waist INTR NMLZ UNPOSS 'Where is my belt?' (E)
(65) kano katyahe 'armpit' kano katyahe arm under

(66) one talolo

'thunder'

one talolo

water ideo.noise

Finally, productive compounds, in which the second noun is a classifying bound noun, show a high degree of productivity in the lexicon. In Paresi, these nouns refers to plant parts (with the exception of walahi 'vein of' and tane 'feather of'). In Table 52 bound nouns that refer to plant parts and body parts are illustrated.

181

Table 52: plant and body parts

Gloss stalk of, stem
'root of' 'vein of' 'leaf of' 'feather of'
'log' 'bark of' 'flower of' 'skin of' 'fruit of' 'seed of', 'tuber of' 'fiber of'

Compounds involving plant parts are fairly productive. Sets based on the first

noun exhibit whole-part relationship (67), while sets based on the second noun exhibit

property-entity relationship. (68) is a property-entity relationship in the sense that they

are types of leaves which are used for different functions.

One example of a classifying bound noun within the semantic domain of body parts is tane 'feather.of' (69).

182

(69) tane 'feather.of' awo-tane oloho-tane tyakoira-tane kolata-tane kokoi-tane

emu feather vulture feather chicken feather partridge feather hawk feather

The classifying bound noun mili 'skin of' can be used metaphorically to refer to a

thin things. In (70), with the noun zotse 'eye' it means 'eyelid' or a 'contact lens'. However

its metaphorical usage is not productive.

(70) mili 'skin.of' zotyare-mili zotse-ti-mili

skin of a deer contact lens, eyelid

A few classifying bound plant part terms have undergone semantic extension, and

they originated forms that have different semantic and morphosyntactic properties (see

§4.5). For example, in (71), the form -ri does not mean 'fruit of', as the bound noun -ri

mentioned above. It refers instead to round objects.

(71) totoniri

'nipple'

totone ri

breast CLF:round

4.5 Noun classification
In Paresi, there are classifying morphemes used to categorize a nominal referent. They can be part of a compound, be incorporated into a verb, and occur also with numerals and demonstratives. A few classifying morphemes originate from classifying bound nouns (plant part terms) which had their meaning metaphorically extended. I consider these forms to be classifiers following the main literature on the types of nominal classification systems (Dixon, 1986; Payne, 1987; Derbyshire & Payne, 1990; Grinevald, 2000; Aikhenvald, 2000; and Grinevald & Seifart, 2004). Dixon (1986) provides properties distinguishing noun classes from classifier systems, while Grinevald (2000) and Aikhenvald (2003) propose a typology of classifiers. Payne (1987) and
183

Derbyshire & Payne (1990) are the first works which discuss the multiple classifier systems found in Amazonian languages.
In Grinevald (2000), classifiers are placed at an intermediate stage in a lexicogrammatical continuum of systems (2000:55). At the grammatical end are gender and noun class systems, such as the noun class systems of Bantu languages. At the other end of the continuum, the lexical end, are measure terms and class terms, as for example, class terms in the Tai family (DeLancey, 1986). Grinevald (2000) considers classifiers to be “overt systems of nominal classification of clear lexical origin used in specific morphosyntactic constructions” (2000:61), and she proposes the following types: numeral, noun, genitive, verbal, and deictic (demonstrative/article) classifiers. She also mentions the co-occurrence of types (the case of multiple classifier systems).
Nominal classification systems of Amazonian languages generally share areal features such as having classifying morphemes with derivational and agreement functions (Aikhenvald, 2000; Grinevald & Seifart, 2004). In Paresi, the primary functions of classifiers are derivational and anaphoric (with numerals, relative clause, and the anaphoric proclitic ha=). Agreement is a marginal function of Paresi classifiers (see discussion in §4.5.2.1.4).

4.5.1.1

Morphology and semantics of classifiers

Semantically, classifiers in Paresi express general properties of the entities they

classify, such as shape, consistency or dimension. The first three classifiers in Table 51

are derived from plant-parts bound nouns: -tse 'CLF:small' from -tse 'seed of', -hi

'CLF:long,thin' from -hi 'fiber of', and -li 'CLF:round' from -li 'fruit of'. In contrast to the

bound nouns, classifiers cannot be possessed. Classifiers are used metaphorically with

nouns referring to plant parts, body parts, objects, animals and humans (only -katse and

-natse are used with human referents). The salient physical properties of plant parts are

mapped onto other semantic fields: shape (including flexibility, size, mass, linearity),

dimension and consistency. Table 53 shows the sets of classifiers in Paresi.

184

The classifier -li~-ri 'CLF:round.' (-ri after high vowels), can occur with body

parts, as in (72) and (73), or objects that have a 'roundish, fruit-like shape', as in (74) and

(75).

The classifier is lexicalized in some body part nouns and in a few nouns referring to animals (katseri 'calf', tseiri 'head,' wairi 'deer', zonoiri 'coral snake'). The classifier -hi 'long, slender' also occurs with body parts, as in (76) and (77), or objects that have a long, slender, flexible, vine-like shape, as in (78) and (79).

The classifier occurs lexicalized in some nouns for body parts, animals and

objects (halatahiti 'rib', tararahiti 'trachea', zozohi 'earthworm', kamaiyekahi type of fish,

awiyahi 'needle').

The classifier -tse 'CLF:small' can be used as a derivational device, as a

diminutive referring to referents who are small, or it can refer to headwaters. This

classifier refers only to size while -li refers to size and dimension. In examples (80)

through (82), -tse derive words whose referents have a small size.

This classifier is more semantically transparent and productively used as a diminutive. In examples (83) through (86), it indicates that these referents are smaller

186

than the average. It may be used with body parts, animals and objects.

The classifier -tse can occur with other classifiers even though the co-occurrence

of more than one classifier in the same word does not occur with other classifiers. This is

evidence that -tse is acting as a diminutive marker, and not as a classifier in these cases.

In example (87), both the frog and his children are small in size but they have different

shapes. In order to show the difference in shape, the classifiers -hoko (referring to the

shape of the frog) and -hi (referring to the slender/thin shape of a tadpole) are used. -tse

occurs after -hoko because the inverse order gives another meaning (that a small object is

around something); while in haitsanitsehi, it is before -hi.

In addition, -tse is used to refer to headwaters. It is commonly used with the noun

one 'water' or with river names, as in (88) and (89).

The classifier is lexicalized in nouns referring to body parts, animals and of

natural elements (e.g.: zotse 'eye' and kaolitse 'knee', wamotse 'armadillo sp.', hawaretse

'peccary', zoretse 'star').

The classifier -katse is used with nouns referring to humans, body-parts, or things

that have a thin, rigid, long, and vertical “stick-like” dimension. The classifier occurs

lexicalized in the word tsekatseti 'hair'.

The classifier -natse may have its source in the noun natse 'pestle'. It is used with

to derive words whose referents are things that have a cylindrical, long horizontal, three-

dimension 'pestle-like' dimension, as in (95). In (96) and (97), its use with the nouns is

optional, and it has an augmentative meaning, indicating the referents are bigger than the

average (-natse is in opposition to -tse).

The classifier occurs with the nouns ohiro 'woman' or ena 'man' in compounds

with animal nouns referring to the gender of the animal (98). The classifier is lexicalized

in a few animals names (halanatse 'dog', kaimalonatse 'type of rat')

The classifier ako may be derived etymologically from the noun ako 'depth', and it

is used with body parts and plant-parts, that have a internal cavity, three-dimension shape.

This classifier is homophonous with the postposition ako used to indicate a location

inside of a container.

The classifier -ako is not productive in compounds. It is lexicalized only in two

body part nouns: koloako 'throat', tyako 'stomach', and in the name of the Formoso village

Hohako (which is located in a valley).

The other classifiers do not have a clear lexical origin. The classifier -he is used with

things that have a 'powder-like' consistency.45 It is not as productive as the other

classifiers, as seen in the examples below. This classifier is lexicalized in the words:

tyolohe 'cassava flour' and waikohe 'sand'.

45 Silva (2013) mentions a similar form -he used in borrowings from Portuguese for things which have a concave-like shape. The only such example in my corpus is balatoahe 'plate.' (<Port. prato).

190

The classifier -hoko may have as its source the noun hoko 'beam of a circled

object'. It is used with objects that have a circled or hollow shape. It occurs lexicalized

only in the name of a community, Owihoko.

There is no known lexical origin for the classifier -za~-ya, which is used to refer

to liquids and to speech. In (109) and (110), -za refers to (fermented) juice of fruits and

vegetables, and in (112) and (113), it refers to significant named rivers.

The 'liquid' classifier can also be used with inanimate referents (in particular from

the Paresi mythology) to refer to a speech about them, stories or song, as seen in (114)

and (115).

The classifier koa46 is another classifier that does not have a known lexical origin,

and is used to refer to flat things. In contrast to -ako, it is used with body parts, and things

that have a flat surface.

Another use of -koa is with nouns that refer to an open space47, as shown in (119)

to (121).

4.5.2 Function of classifiers and the typology of classification As was mentioned in the introduction of this section, the use of classifiers in
derivational and agreement functions is common among Amazonian languages. In this section, I provide a description of the morphosyntactic contexts in which classifiers occur in Paresi (see Table 50): with nouns, verbs, numerals and demonstratives. I also describe anaphoric and agreement functions. In addition, I present a general discussion on how the Paresi nominal classification system fits into the Amazonian language model, and offer some comparative notes on the nominal classification systems of other Arawak languages.

4.5.2.1.1 Nominal roots Classifiers function as derivational elements, and they may be lexicalized in

nouns for introduced cultural items. They derive nouns from other nouns, as in (122) to

(124), or from stative verbs (125). In examples (122) and (123), the classifier -natse does

not modify the noun kore 'arrow', referring to the shape of the arrow (if so, it would be

optional), but instead it refers to the shape of the gun or the bullet, respectively.

(122) korenatse

(125) wiyeri

'candy'

wiya -li

be.sweet CLF:round

4.5.2.1.2 Verb roots Classifiers can be incorporated into verbs (see noun incorporation §5.3.3.1),

similar to how inalienable nouns referring to body and plant parts can be incorporated.

The incorporation of classifiers is very productive. This type of incorporation does not

change the valency of the verb, and is rare with intransitive verbs. The incorporated

classifier may be accompanied by the external noun phrase, but once it is identified in the

discourse, only the incorporated classifier is sufficient. Example (126) shows the

incorporation of the classifier -natse 'CLF: cylindrical' into the intransitive verb tyoka

'sit', in which the classifier indexes the subject of the verb. Classifiers can also be used as

nominalizers, deriving nouns from stative verbs, as in (127).

wiya -li

be.sweet CLF:round

4.5.2.1.3 Numerals and demonstratives In Paresi, numerals and demonstratives can occur with a classifier. There are
three construction types: (i) the head noun and the head modifier are marked with the classifier (128); (ii) or only the noun head occurs with the classifier (the optionality of the classifier in the modifier is marked by the parentheses in hanamataotse 'three pieces'); or (iii) only the modifier occurs with the classifier, as shown in (129) through the optional
194

use of the noun atyakatse 'stick'.

Generally in texts, classifiers occur with demonstratives and numerals. In (130),

-tse 'CLF:small' occurs with the demonstrative eze 'this', and in (131) the classifier -li

'CLF: round' occurs with the numeral hinama. In (132), the classifier -tse 'CLF:small'

occurs with the numerals hanama 'three' and quatro 'four'.

A classifier can occur as a modifier of an noun phrase. In (133), the classifier -li 'CLF:round' appears with the adjective kalo 'big' in a noun phrase headed by the nominalization, which is in apposition to the noun phrase manakata 'type of fruit' (see adjectives in §3.7). In (134), the classifier -li also functions as the modifier of the noun
195

phrase headed by the nominalization.

4.5.2.1.4 Agreement-like function In Paresi, the agreement-like function (when the classifier occurs in the
modifier, as seen above) is rare in texts. It is possible to find a classifier marked on both the head noun and the modifier, as in (128) and (129) above. However, the classifier on the modifier is not obligatory, as seen in (49). Instead of analyzing it as agreement within in the noun phrase, I prefer to analyze the noun and the modifier to be in different noun phrases headed by the classifier (see apposition of noun phrases in §4.7.1.1). Thus Paresi's behavior is distinct from that of other Amazonian languages such as Miraña (Grinevald & Seifart, 2004) where agreement is obligatory and the classifying morpheme occurs on all modifiers of a noun in an noun phrase. In other languages, such as Hup (Epps, 2008), classifiers also show a marginal agreement-marking function similar to the one found in Paresi.

4.5.2.1.5 Anaphoric reference In Paresi, the major use of classifiers is the anaphoric one. Classifiers occur in
constructions with numerals, as in (135), with headless relative clauses (136), and with the proclitic ha= meaning '3sg' or 'one, 'other', as shown in (137). According to Grinevald & Seifart (2004), Amazonian classifier systems exhibit discursive and anaphoric functions (Grinevald & Seifart 2004: 282).

One discourse function of classifiers is to highlight certain properties of a modified

referent. This function is also present in Paresi. The example in (140) illustrates the use

of classifiers to highlight the shape properties of pieces of wood in an elicitation task

(where the consultant had to describe objects seen in the pictures):

4.5.2.1.6 systems

Properties of Paresi classifiers and the typology of noun classification

Table 54 compares the properties of classifiers in Paresi to the properties of

nominal classification systems in Grinevald (2000: 62). This table shows that Paresi

shows almost all the properties of classifier systems. Classifiers do not occur with all

nouns, like noun classes; they are independent of grammatical categories such as number

and gender. However, classifiers in Paresi, unlike in other Amazonian languages, do not

constitute an open system.48 Paresi exhibits a small number of classifiers (only 11)

compared to the number of classifiers in other languages, such as the Arawak language

48 The bound noun mili 'skin of' is used metaphorically, and its use may become productive similar to classifiers.

198

Baure which has around 40 (Danielsen, 2008). Classifiers are also bound forms occurring with other nouns or numerals in compounds, they are not affixed to a noun. Because of their anaphoric function, classifiers occur as the head of the noun phrase, as seen above. Their function as agreement markers is marginal, though classifiers can occur more than once in a noun phrase, agreement is not obligatory. Arguments also are rarely crossreferenced on the verb when a classifier is incorporated.
While Paresi's classifiers behave differently from the typical classifiers described in Grinevald (2000), the are also distinct from class terms as she describes them. Class terms involve more semantic fields than seen in Paresi's classifiers (beyond fauna, flora and body parts), do not incorporate in the verb, and are not used with agreement-like functions. Paresi classifiers fit more neatly in the typology of Aikhenvald (2003), in which classifying morphemes used in different morphosyntactic environments are treated as a type called “multiple classifiers”.

4.5.2.1.7 Comparative note Most of the Arawak languages mark a distinction between two nominal genders:
feminine and non-feminine (sometimes masculine). In addition, they have also multiple classifier systems, especially the North-west Arawak languages, such as Tariana, Baniwa of Içana and Kurripako, and Resígaro (Aikhnevald, 2012: 295). South Arawak languages (e.g.: Baure, Terena, Waurá, Paresi, Asheninka) also have classifiers which occur with numerals, verbs and nouns.
Apurinã seems to have an incipient classifier system. This language has bound nouns recurrently used in the formation of other nouns and incorporated into verbs (Facundes, 2000). Facundes does not call them classifiers because they are more like class term, and he calls them “classificatory nouns” (CNs). In contrast to classifiers in Paresi, CNs are bound nouns with metaphorical usage, and they only occur with nouns and verbs.
Did Proto-Arawak have classifiers? Payne (1991) reconstructs a few candidates. One of these, *ba 'one', apparently had the function of a noun classifier in Proto-Arawak. Others have lexical noun reflexes in some Arawak languages and noun classifying morphemes as reflexes in other languages, suggesting that the lexical noun is probably the source of the classifying morpheme. Since classifiers are readily grammaticalized from lexical nouns in some languages, a few sets of modern reflexes of classifiers is not evidence for reconstructing a classifier system in the protolanguage. It remains to be demonstrated conclusively that there were a classifier system found in Proto-Arawak.
4.6 Nominal derivation Paresi has at least eight strategies for deriving nouns from verbs. Nouns may be derived by one of the suffixes in Table 46, each of which will be discussed in turn in this section.

4.6.1 Event nominalization: -Ø Agentive intransitive and transitive verb roots may act as nouns without an
explicit nominalizer morpheme. They bear morphology of inalienability, occurring with the unpossessed suffix -ti, and with the personal clitics and the possessed suffix -ne when possessed. The derived nouns refer to events, or to the result of a process,49 as in (141) and (142).

49 Silva (2013:164) considered the unpossessed suffix -ti to be a thematic nominalizer. In the analysis presented here -ti is not considered a nominalizer, and I do not use the label “nominalization of theme”. The zero nominalization described here and Silva's nominalization of theme refer to the same type of nominalization.

4.6.2

Result nominalizer z-

In general the nominalizer prefix z-~x-~zo- occurs with stative verbs, in order to

derive non-process nouns (abstract inalienably possessed nouns), and with a few agentive

verbs to derive a noun that refers to the result of an action. It is not a productive process.

The prefix co-occurs with the unpossessed suffix -ti or the possessed suffix -ne, as shown

in Table 57.50 The use of this nominalizer with some agentive verbs is not clear. Another

intriguing fact is that the verb holikoa 'dance' is an exception that can occur with or

without the prefix without a change of meaning.

50 The examples in Table 57 come from elicitation. Only zaotyakitsati 'teaching' was observed in texts.

Silva (2013:166) says that the occurrence of the nominalizer depends on the thematic role of the predicates and their readings. He gives examples of two verbs that can occur with or without the prefix z- with a change in meaning: otya 'remember' and iwini 'breathe'. According to him, verbs with an agent argument do not take the prefix when the nominalization refers to an event or theme (its default reading), only when it refers to a non-event.51 For example, the verb otya 'remember', a verb with an experiencer and theme argument, when used as a noun can have the form otya-ti meaning 'the act of remembering.' (event reading), or z-otya-ti meaning 'memory' (non-event reading). Verbs with only an experiencer argument have the opposite behavior. For instance, iwini
51 How one could classify a verb when it has an experiencer or theme argument is not clear in Silva (2013).
203

'breathe' has an experiencer argument, then iwiniti refers to a non-event 'breath' and ziwiniti refers to the event 'breathing (metaphorically: 'another stage in life').
The analysis where nouns with z- refers to the result of an action, may account for the derived nouns presented in his work: zazati 'question', zotyati 'memory', and ziwiniti 'breath'.
He also argues that the verb holikoa 'dance' has the form zoholikoati when used by elders because they do not participate in the action; dancing is a non-event for them. According to him, another z-less form, holikoati, is used by young people because dancing for them is an event, a baile 'dance'. However, in my corpus both forms were given by people of all ages. In conclusion, there is no consensus about the pragmatic and the semantic issues involved in the uses of z-.
Other types of derivation have as their stems a verb root and the z- prefix and -ti morphemes (e.g.: zaotyakitsatiye 'teachers'), as described below.

4.6.3 Agent nominalizer -re The suffix -re is used to derive nouns from intransitive and transitive verbs and
adjectives. The derived nouns refer to the agent of the verb event. There are some instances of allomorph alternation of the suffix -re, as shown in Table 58:

Table 58: Allomorphs of the agent nominalizer -re

Masculine

-ye/ i_#

-ze/e_#

-re/elsewhere

Feminine

-ro/i,e_#

-lo (elsewhere)

The morpheme -re 'NMLZ' has the allomorph: -ze after roots ending with high vowels. In (145c), -ze is after the vowel /i/, then /θ/ is palatalized to [j].

The allomorphs -lo and -ro mark feminine forms. The morpheme -lo has an

allomorph -ro after roots ending with front vowels. In (146c), -ro is after the vowel /i/,

then /ɾ/ is palatalized to [dʲ].

The suffix -re and its feminine counterpart -lo, when occurring alone, derive nouns that may be used as an argument in a predicate, as a modifier of another noun, as a head of a predicate, as a complement of a negation, or with the postposition kakoa.

In (146), the nominalized verb is the head of the predicate. Interestingly, the

nominalized verb retains its verb morphology, expressing its subject through the

pronominal clitic na= (which is attached to verbs), in contrast to the form -tiye, which is

used with a free pronoun (§4.6.4).

4.6.4 Human agent nominalizer -tiye Intransitive and transitive verbs and adjectives can be used as nouns with the
unpossessed marker -ti and the agent nominalizer -re~-ye. The nominalization refers to someone who is a specialist (e.g.: zaotyakitsatyatiye 'teacher'), or is very good at doing the action or refer to someone who happens to do something.

A few other nouns in Table 67 exhibit the form hare, but they are not clearly derived nouns.54 It may be possible that the nominalizer is lexicalized in these forms, and that their only function is to mark the gender of their referents: -hare for masculine and -halo for feminine.

54 The root of the morpheme -hare may be same as for the noun haliti 'person' (which can be decomposed as root hare and the unpossessed suffix -ti).

4.6.6 Instrument nominalizer -kala The suffix -kala applies to intransitive and transitive verbs to derive a noun
denoting an instrument, and it has also a secondary meaning of location. This is a very productive way to form neologisms for newly introduced cultural items. These derived nouns are inalienable nouns taking the unpossessed -ti, and the personal clitics when possessed.

4.6.7 Locative nominalizer -(i)yere/-(i)yolo The suffix –iyere/-iyolo derives nouns from other nouns (168) and (169), and

4.6.8 Passive nominalizer: -ka The nominalizer -ka (or -ki for first person) derives nouns from transitive and
ditransitive verbs. The derived nominal of a transitive verb refers to an event where the entity involved is a patient, as in (172) and (173), while the nominalization of a ditransitve verb refers to an event where the entity involved is a recipient (174).

In Brandão (2010), I had a different analysis from the one presented here because

I described -ka as a passive marker. My previous analysis was based only on examples

such as in (176), in which there is an attributive prefix ka- in the nominalized

constructions. The two constructions are contrasted above. I am now following Silva

(2013) who calls -ka/-ki a recipient nominalizer.55 Comparing (175) to (176), one notices

that the first one is a predicate with the nominalized verb as its head. The second one is a

predicate with the attributive ka-. In order to be used in a predicate construction such as

in (176), the nominalized verb has to take the attributive ka-, which derives verbs from

nouns (see §7.3.3).

4.7 The structure of noun phrases

4.7.1 Noun phrase and noun modification This section describes the structure and organization of the noun phrase in Paresi.

A basic structure template for the noun phrase is in (177). Demonstratives (Dem), lexical

possessors (POSS), pronouns (PRO), numerals (Num) and quantifiers (Quant) precede

the head noun.56 Nominalized verbs (Nom), including the ones in nominalized relative

clauses modifying a noun, follow it. Nouns functioning as modifiers in compounds may

precede or follow the noun. Nouns, demonstratives, and quantifiers can be the head of a

noun phrase.

(177)

NP → (Dem)(POSS)(PN)(Num)(Quant)(Nom) N (Nom)

Each type of element mentioned in the template, except modifiers following the

noun, can occur only once in an noun phrase. In texts, the occurrence of more than one

element other than the head noun in an noun phrase is rare. In (178) the demonstrative

and numeral co-occur in the same noun phrase.

(178) hatyo hinama ohiro Ø=zaneheta

hatyo hinama ohiro Ø= zane -heta

that two

woman 3sg go PERF

'Those two women went away.' (E)

4.7.1.1

Appositional noun phrases

Nouns modifying other nouns can form appositional noun phrases.57 Appositional

modifiers are elements which, from a syntactic point of view, are not part of the phrase

containing the head noun, but are co-referential (i.e, they must refer to the same entity as

56 The quantifier kahare may follow nouns.
57 Another strategy for noun-noun modification is compounding (§4.5).

218

the other members in the appositional construction (Rijkhoff, 2002:22)). In (179), the

main noun phrase is Anita and ezanityo 'his wife' is in apposition.

ezanityo

baba João Garimpeiro Anita =la e= ezan ityo

dad PN

PN =FOC 3sg wife

'My father, who is João Garimpeiro, and Anita, his wife.' (Batsaji tahi)

Another piece of evidence that two noun phrases are appositional in Paresi is the

use of the discourse markers atyo 'topic' and ala 'focus' between them (in the example

above there is a focus marker after the noun phrase Anita). These markers are phrase

boundary markers, always occurring in second position in a clause. They cannot occur

after the first element of the noun phrase, only after the noun phrase.

hatyo hinama ohiro =atyo Ø= zane -heta

woman =TOP 3sg go PERF

Numerals and quantifiers can occur clause-initially (in a focused/topicalized

position) in a appositional noun phrase. Example (182) shows the numeral hinama 'two'

with a classifier followed by the focus marker ala. Example (183) shows the topicalizer

atyo following the quantifier kahare 'a lot'.

4.7.1.2

Coordination of noun phrases

The domain of noun phrase coordination is considered to be a sentence describing

a single event predicated simultaneously by two participant referents, which are

conceived of as separate individuals (Stassen, 2001:1105). Paresi uses the coordinate and

the comitative strategies for coordination of noun phrases. In the coordinate strategy, two

linking devices are employed: juxtaposition, and the markers zoaha or hare, and in the

comitative strategy, the comitative kakoa is used.

Juxtaposition is said to occur more often in enumeration or noun phrase-pairs

which habitually go together, forming a whole (Stassen, 2001). This tendency is also seen

in Paresi, as illustrated by the examples (184) and (185).

In (184), the noun phrase-pair haiyanityo 'his wife' and haitsaninae 'his children'

are juxtaposed, and other pairs conceived as a concept unit, such as baba 'my father' and

mama 'my mother', often occur juxtaposed. In (185), juxtaposition is used for

enumeration of the main characters of the story, Wazoliye and Kerakoama are brothers

and Alaoliro is their grandmother. Interestingly, an noun phrase-noun phrase pair when

first introduced in a text may be coordinated by a marker, but after the first mention it is

coordinated by juxtaposition (similar to a pair which habitually go together).

Noun phrase coordination is often marked by coordinators postposed to the

second noun phrase. In general, the coordinator zoaha is used when there is coordination

of two noun phrases (188), when three or more noun phrases are coordinated, in

enumeration, hare is used (189), but there are exceptions, as seen in (190). Example

(191) shows that a plural marker can be attached to the coordinator indicating that the

coordinated noun phrases form a large phrase unit.

Stassen (2001) classifies coordination constructions according to the number of

conjunctions into two types: monosyndetic, constructions with one conjunction marker,

and polysyndetic constructions, with two conjunction markers. He points out that

monosyndetic postposing of conjunction markers, as seen in Paresi, is not common, and

that these constructions may originate from polysyndetic constructions in which one of

the markers was optionally deleted. That may be the case for Paresi, because there are a

few occurrences in which hare occurs after each coordinated noun phrase, as in (192).

'We were used to eating everything: spider monkey, tufted capuchin monkey, and

Both coordinators hare and zoaha also function as sentence adverbials meaning

'also, as well'. Stassen (2001) points out that a common source of coordinator markers are

sentential adverbials, and that may be the case in Paresi. Examples (193), (194) and (195)

illustrate their uses as sentential adverbials. In the last example, both occur at the end of

the clause.

Finally, there are few instances of noun phrase coordination in which the

comitative kakoa is used. The comitative occurs with noun phrase-pairs with kinship

relationship, in cases where juxtaposition was expected, such as: baba 'my father' and

mama 'my mother', ezanityo 'wife' and ityani 'son, daughter', as seen in (196). It can also

occur in cases where hare would otherwise be used, as in (197).

Chapter 5 - Verb classes and adjusting valency
5.0 Introduction
Prototypical members of the Paresi verb class receive affixes or clitics indicating tense, aspect, mood, polarity, valence-changing operations, and person/number of subject(s) and object(s). Syntactically, these verbs can be the heads of predicates without additional coding. In Paresi, verb roots can be intransitive, transitive, or ditransitive. There are three mechanisms to decrease valency: the middle voice form -oa, the reflexive -wi, and the reciprocal -kakoa, as well as four mechanisms to increase valency: three morphological causatives, and one periphrastic causative construction.
5.1 Verb structure and the thematic suffixes A verb can consist of a basic or a derived form. Verbs can be derived from nouns
through the causativizer prefix a- (§5.3.2.2) or the attributive marker ka- (§7.3.3). Most of the verb morphology consists of suffixes. The order of affixes on roots is given below (obligatory elements are in boldface): (1) 1. attributive ka- or negative ma2. personal proclitics 3. causative a4. ROOT 5. classifiers/ incorporated nouns/ postpositions 6. thematic suffixes 7. causative -ki 8. middle voice -oa or reciprocal -kakoa 9. aspect markers 10. plural -ha 11. third person enclitic =ene
226

The suffixes closest to the root are thematic suffixes, followed by valency changing morphemes (reciprocal, middle voice, causative), aspect morphemes and verbal plural. Of the 15 suffixes, only up to 7 can co-occur in a verbal word, as in (2): (2) kehezaharetyoahetehenahene
Ø= keheza -hare -tya -oa -hete -hena -ha =ene 3sg feel.good MASC TH MM PERF TRS PL 3O 'They will be feeling better.' (E)
Some verbs have bound roots that must occur with suffixes called thematic suffixes. 'Thematic suffix' is a term used in the literature on the Arawak family to “gloss affixes which have little, if any, semantic content” (Wise, 1990:90) but are required to complete the verb base. The selection of the appropriate thematic suffix depends on arbitrary classes of roots. The thematic suffixes (-tya~-tsa and -ka) are suffixes that attach to the verb root to form a base before they receive other suffixes such as the tense/aspect/mood suffixes. They may be analyzed as lexicalized with the roots, as seen in example (3). However, this analysis does not account for the fact that they never appear with the suffix -heta 'completive' or -hena 'transitional'.58 For example, the verb zakaihaka 'tell story' occurs with the thematic suffix -tya in (5a) and without it in (5b).

The distribution of the suffixes appears to be related to the transitivity of the verb: -tya occurs with transitive and ditransitive verbs, as seen in Table 71, while -ka can occur with the intransitive verbs haka 'work' and nemaka 'sleep', or transitive verbs. The choice
58 Silva (2013) considers them to be perfective markers, see discussion in §6.3.
227

of which transitive verbs take -tya and which take -ka appears to be arbitrary. There is no root which can appear with either -tya or -ka as alternating possibilities.

5.2 Verb classes Verbs can be identified according to their valence in Paresi and the semantic role
of their subjects. In terms of valence, verbs can be intransitive, transitive or ditransitive. In terms of the semantic role of their subjects, Paresi verbs exhibit an agentive-patientive system. I will also describe the copula tyaona, the existential verb aka, and the quotative verb nea which have some grammatical differences from intransitive and transitive verbs. Intransitive verbs can be further classified as agentive or non-agentive verbs depending on the type of personal proclitics they take. I identify two sets of proclitics, set A and set B, which differ according to the semantic role of subjects. Table 74 illustrates the pronominal markers in set A and B.

Table 74: sets of proclitics in Paresi

Ø=

1pl wa=

wi=

2pl za=

xi=

3pl Ø=…-ha Ø=…-ha

Semantically, there are two basic groups of intransitive Paresi verbs: i) active/control verbs which take set A; and ii) non-control verbs which take set B. In the first group are verbs whose participants are actors (which perform, effect, instigate, or control the situation denoted by the predicate). In the second group are verbs whose

230

participants are undergoers or lack control, because the participants of these verbs refer to property concepts and to some events that are not performed or controlled by the participant (such as ‘die’, ‘wake up’, ‘sleep’).60 The first class of verbs I call active/agentive verbs and these take set A proclitics, and the second class I call nonagentive verbs and these take set B proclitics. It's mostly in intransitive verbs that we see sets A and set B distinction, which is typical of agentive systems cross-linguistically. This analysis supersedes Brandão (2010) where I proposed that verbs taking set B were stative verbs, while verbs taking set A were active verbs. In that earlier analysis I analyzed the form a- in the proclitics of set A as an active morpheme based on the fact that a- is an active morpheme in other Arawak languages. However, this analysis is not accurate because the morpheme a- does not occur in the third person proclitic.

5.2.1 Intransitive Verbs Intransitive verbs require one syntactic argument. They are classified in two
classes: intransitive verbs which take set A markers and intransitive verbs which take set B markers. These classes are morphologically and semantically different, as will be shown below.

5.2.1.1

Intransitive agentive verbs

Most of the intransitive verbs are in this class. They have participants who are agents

or performers of a controlled action. The notion of actor or agent is here understood as “a

participant which performs, effects, instigates, or controls the situation denoted by the

predicate” and undergoer or patient as a participant who does not perform, instigate,

control the situation (Mithun, 1991: 516). Morphologically, they take the set A proclitics.

Table 75 shows some examples of this type of intransitive verbs (some of them are not

clearly control-oriented, as I will discuss below).

60 A similar case of prefix choices based on the semantic feature of agentivity is found in Pilaga, Guaykuruan family (Vidal, 2008). According to Donohue & Wichmann (2008), this type of semantic alignment where there are two different markers (or sets of markers) which can both be used for A or S is typologically unusual.

1plB come.out, show.up PERF

In the case of word forms that start with vowels, it is difficult to identify which group they belong to based on the morphology. That is because the last vowels of proclitics are dropped, and it is not possible to identify whether the vowel was a a (from set A) or i (from set B). I classify them based on their semantics.
Positional verbs such as tityoa 'stand up' and meholokoa 'kneel down', and the
232

motion verb talirikoa 'roll down' are also in this set. Perception verbs may lack volition

and not be subject to control, but the subject of the verb waiyore 'know' which also means

'learn' has volition, as in (11). The involuntary bodily process verb tonokoa 'cough' in (12)

is a spontaneous behavior, but it also falls in this class regardless of whether the action is

done on purpose or accidentally. These examples suggests that the class is not completely

consistent semantically because the subject participant of verbs in this set may be

performers with or without control. However, participants of verbs which take set B

markers must lack control.

5.2.1.2

Intransitive non-agentive verbs

Verbs in this class have a participant who is an undergoer or lacks control.

Semantically, they are verbs denoting states and time-stable concepts, while agentive

verbs in the first group denote events. These verbs take proclitics from set B. Brandão

(2010) classified intransitive verbs into two groups: standard intransitive and descriptive

intransitive verbs. The descriptive verbs included only verbs denoting a property. Verbs

denoting states such as naka 'be hungry' and verbs taking the gender suffixes (-hare for

masculine and -halo for feminine) were not included in this class. However, because they

have the same morphosyntactic behavior, I have considered descriptive verbs and verbs

denoting states here to be in one group of stative intransitive verbs. Other intransitive

verbs taking set B proclitics have an undergoer participant but they are not stative, and

233

form another group of non-stative intransitive verbs taking set B.

5.2.1.3

Stative intransitive verbs

Stative intransitive verbs are verbs semantically different from other intransitive

verbs. They refer to color, states, some values and physical properties. Descriptive words

referring to dimension, age, certain values and physical properties are adjectives and are

described in §3.7.

Stative verbs referring to physical properties may take gender marking -hare

'MASC' or -halo 'FEM', as seen in Table 76.

5.2.1.3.1 Non-stative non-agentive verbs Other verbs taking set B markers are some body process verbs ('cry', 'vomit',
'laugh'), as shown in Table 78, and examples (20) and (21). These are usually uncontrolled events. In addition, events which are not performed, effected, instigated or controlled by the participant, such as 'die', also take set B markers:
Table 78: Non-stative verbs taking set B

The use of both sets of proclitics with a given verb root is not possible. For

example, the verbs naka 'be hungry' and tiya 'cry' are assigned to set B and cannot be

used with set A:

(22) a. nonakita

no= naka

1sgA be.hungry IFV

(23) a. notiya no= tiya 1sgB cry 'I cried.' (E)
b. *natiya na= tiya 1sgA cry

The verbs kaotse 'wake up' and kaitxihini 'dream' are grouped as non-agentive related verbs denoting events. The verbs nemaka 'sleep',62 tyoka 'sit' and tekoa 'run away',63 zakaihaka 'tell a story' (which is formed by the noun zaka 'story'), and the
62 It has an allomorph temaka in persons other than the third person, and it may be derived from the noun maka 'night'
63 Diachronically, tyoka, temaka, and tekoa may be derived verbs from nouns formed by the prefixes tyand t-. One evidence is that their causative forms with the causative -ki do not exhibit ty- or t-:
237

directed motion verbs which have a inherently specified direction: zane 'go', kaoka
'arrive', tyoa 'come'.64
When stative verbs are causativized by a- , as seen in (25) and (26), the vowel of
the proclitic forms of set B is dropped. One hypothesis is that this process may have been
the source of proclitic forms of set A which all have the vowel a. One can analyze the a
in the set A markers as a fossilized form of the causative prefix a-. It cannot be analyzed
as a separated morpheme anymore because it does not occur in the third person of set A
markers. Active verbs with set A markers have a participant with control.

5.2.2 Transitive verbs Transitive verbs may take two syntactic arguments in Paresi. As such, they differ
from intransitive verbs with respect to pronominal marking in that they can take the
enclitic =ene for third person. There are no object pronominal markers in the other
persons; independent pronouns are used instead. Table 79 illustrates some transitive
verbs.
aokakitsa 'he made him sit', aemakitsa 'he made him sleep' and ekoakitsa 'he made him run away'. However, synchronically the prefixes are already lexicalized in non-causative forms. 64 Other motion verbs such as tema 'run' and tona 'walk' are in the group of verbs taking set A proclitics.

Most of the transitive verbs can take either one or two core arguments freely, but these are not cases of ambitransitivity. They take one argument when the object is implicit or dropped. In (31), the object of waiya 'see' (inima 'his cloth') is implicit because it was mentioned in a previous sentence.

All transitive verbs take proclitics from set A, with few exceptions. One exception

is the perception verb waiya 'see', which semantically lacks control, and that is why it

take set B proclitics. Other exceptions are agentive verbs derived from nouns which have

lexicalized the attributive ka-, as kanakaira 'eat', as in (32). The verb kaiwa 'steal' may

also contain a lexicalized ka- in spite of its apparent status as an agentive verb since it

also takes set B proclitics. Other exceptions are the verbs tera 'drink' (34) and tyoma

'make' (32).65

In Table 80, adapted from Mithun (1991:524), I summarize the distribution of pronominal markers (Sets A and B) according to the semantic features of eventhood and control. The Table shows that control may be a relevant feature since stative verbs and the
65 These two last examples have lexicalized prefixes ty- and t- which do not occur in the causative forms, as seen in the previous section with the intransitive verbs tyoka 'sit' and tekoa 'run away'.
240

transitive verb waiya 'see', whose participants have the feature [- control], take set B markers; while verbs whose participants have the semantic feature of control, the majority of transitive verbs and intransitive verbs in line d (which have some control: waiyezehare 'be a nice person' and waiyezehekola 'be prudent'), take set A proclitics. Table 81 summarizes the distribution of pronominal forms according to control.

5.2.3 Ditransitive verbs Ditransitive verbs are verbs that have two core arguments in addition to the
subject (Haspelmath, 2013). Paresi does not exhibit ditransitive verbs in terms of two required objects. The only occurrence of three arguments with the verb aotyakitsa 'teach'
241

in my corpus is given in (35), but there are verbs which may take a theme argument and a

recipient or addressee argument. The occurrence of an overt third argument with these

verbs is rare; usually only one of the arguments is mentioned and the other one is implicit

(because it was already mentioned in the discourse). The theme is coded like a

5.2.4 Copula tyaona The copula tyaona can be used with nouns, location arguments, and stative verbs.

In nominal predicates, it has an aspectual meaning 'become'. In that sense, tyaona is

similar to a semi-copula, as defined by Hengeveld (1992), which can never be left out

without changing the meaning of the clause in nominal predicates.66

The example (39) shows a nominal predicate with two juxtaposed nouns, and the

copula at the end. In (40), the copula occurs with the personal clitic no= '1sg'. The copula

can also take aspectual markers as seen in (39) -ita 'IFV', (40) -hena 'TRS', and (41) -ita

'IFV'. In (41), the adverb is followed by the noun phrase and the copula.

In existential and locative predicates, the copula tyaona is used in texts only with

the third person. These predicates have the same argument structure as other tyaona

clauses: a theme argument (entity), a location argument, and the copula. Freeze (2001)

points out the similarity between locative and existential predicates cross-linguistically.

I did not find negative existential clauses with tyaona in my corpus. Elicitation has shown that Paresi employs the particle maiha 'NEG' and the verb aka 'exist' in this type of construction (see example in the next section). The copula can be used with almost all types of predicates, except for possessive predicates, which take the prefixes ka- or ma-. The origin of the copula is the verb tyaona which has the meanings 'live, be born, stay, become, happen'. Therefore, the most probable source for the copula is tyaona as a dynamic verb meaning 'happen, become', and the evidence for this is that it still means 'become' with nominal predicates. Stassen (1997) mentions dynamic verbs with meanings like these as one of the common sources of copular verbs.
5.2.5 Existential copula verb aka One of the strategies to form existential constructions is the use of the existential
copula verb aka. The copular verb occurs with one argument that may be a noun or a stative verb. It can take aspect markers similar to the copula tyaona, but it cannot take personal proclitics. Another difference is that aka 'exist' is restricted to negative clauses. The only example from text in a declarative clause is in (46). In addition, aka does not occur with the nominalizer -re in negative clauses (see §7.6) while the copula tyaona and
244

other verbs do occur with this nominalizer in negative clauses.

5.2.6 The quotative verb nea The verb nea is used only in the context of quotations, which function as its
complement. There are not many studies that make distinction between general speech verbs and quotative verbs. Quotative verbs are defined by Güldemann (2008:82) as specialized forms for the quotation context which outside reported discourse have no use at all. They have restrictions and irregularities which are not shared with standard verbs, and can have weaker phonological substance.
The quotative verb nea inflects for person, as seen in Table 82. The verb presents suppletive forms in the first persons singular and plural, which is the kind of irregularity that can be expected from a quotative verb.

w=ita

z=ea

Ø-nea-ha

The verb nea 'say' differs from speech verbs (such as irai 'talk') because it takes a

quotation (48), but not a pronominal proclitic or noun phrase as the object argument (49).

Furthermore, nea 'say' does not occur in negative clauses.

Valency-changing morphology or thematic suffixes do not occur on the verb nea. The form with the thematic suffix -tya (*nea-tya) is not grammatical, nor is the form with the middle voice -oa (*nea-tyoa). The only cases with derivational morphology found are: e-nea-re (3sg=say-NMLZ) 'his name'; and a-he-neza-tya (CAUS-?-say-TH) 'shout'. Syntactically, the quotative verb nea directly follows the quoted material.

In (52), the form nea is followed by a postpositional phrase which characterizes

the addressee of the quoted speech.

Another use, which is metapragmatic, is the report of nonspeech sounds or

nonreferential speech such as nonhuman sounds (a use similar to the verb go in English):

5.3 Valency-changing mechanisms
There are three mechanisms to decrease valency: reflexive, middle voice and reciprocal, while to increase valency there are three morphological causatives and one periphrastic causative construction. Many Amazonian languages exhibit more valencyincreasing operations than valency-decreasing ones (Aikhenvald, 2000), as is the case with Paresi.

5.3.1 Valency decreasing mechanisms

5.3.1.1

Middle marker -oa

The suffix -oa was described by Brandão (2010) as an intransitivizer occurring

with anticausative verbs and with a reflexive function.67 Here I expand my analysis by

67 In the analysis presented in Silva (2013: 280) -oa is considered to be an anticausative marker. He gives one example of anticausativization with the pair taika 'break (tr.)'/taikoa 'break (intr.)'. The other example given with the pair toka 'hold'/ tokoa 'stick' is actually not a case of anticausativization

247

presenting other types of verbs taking this suffix, and I argue that it is better to call it a middle voice (Joshua Birchall, p.c., 2013).
The suffix -oa marks the inactive and inchoative form of verbs, that is, verbs whose meaning excludes the causing agent, and present the situation as occurring spontaneously (Haspelmath, 1993). Table 83 shows a list of transitive and inchoative pairs.68 The Table was based on the list with 31 verb pairs of inchoative/causative alternations given in Haspelmath (1993). Most of the verbs in this group exhibit the -k(a) or -ty(a) thematic marker.

The polysemy of a verbal marker being used for different valency-decreasing functions (passive, reflexive, anticausative, reciprocal, middle voice) is widely reported (Shibatani, 1985; Haspelmath, 1987; Kemmer, 1993, 1994; Kazenin, 2001). According to Kemmer (1994), middle voice forms are associated with the classes of verbs mentioned above which take -oa: grooming or body care verbs, verbs of body motion without change of position, verbs of change in posture, translational motion verbs, emotion and cognition middles (such as being angry, and thinking), and spontaneous events. The only group of verbs taking this suffix in Paresi which do not fit into this classification are action verbs such as 'cut', 'bite' and 'hang' which are interpreted with a reflexive meaning when they appear with the middle voice suffix in Paresi.
The main semantic characteristic shared by all verbs marked by the middle voice form is affectedness of the subject. The difference between reflexives and middle voice

253

forms is that the latter indicates two semantic roles of initiator and endpoint referring to a single holistic entity, while in the former the initiator acts on itself just as it would act in another entity (Kemmer, 1994: 207). At this stage I can only elaborate on the hypothesis that -oa was historically a reflexive marker that had its function extended to mark middles. As seen in the next section, there is a coreferential marker also used to mark reflexivization. Further study comparing the middle voice and the reflexive is required.

5.3.1.2

Reflexive/coreferential marker

Reflexive markers indicate that the agent and another argument in a event are

coreferential, i.e, they are the same entity (Kemmer, 1994; Frajzyngier, 1999; Kazenin,

2001). In Paresi, this coreferential function is expressed by the reflexive suffix -wi. The

reflexive -wi is also a marker of coreferentiality.

Examples (67) to (71) show transitive and ditransitive verbs taking the reflexive.69

With ditransitive verbs such as aotyakitsa 'teach' and hotikitsa 'show' -wi indicates the

agent is coreferential with the beneficiary/recipient, as seen in (70) and (71).

(67) nawaiyetyoawi n= awaiye -tya -oa -wi 1sg like TH MM REF 'I like myself.' (E)

(70) naotyakitsoawi n= aotyaki -tya -oa -wi 1sg teach TH MM REF 'I taught myself.' (E)

Because reflexivization involves the affectedness of the subject in addition to coreferentiality, verbs taking the reflexive -wi may also exhibit the middle marker -oa (seen in the previous section). An important difference between -oa and -wi, is the use of the latter only with verbs whose event has a high degree of “distinguishability of participants” (Kemmer, 1993). This is illustrated by the ungrammaticality in (72)b of -wi with a change of position verb such as etolitsa 'lie down'. (72) a. netolitsoa
n= etolitsa -oa 1sg lie.down MM 'I laid myself down.' (E) b. *netolitsowi
n= etolitsa -oa -wi 1sg lie.down MM REF 'I laid myself down.' (E)
However, the difference between using only -(ty)oa or using -(ty)oawi with a given stem is unclear, as seen in (73) and (74) where the addition of -wi appears to not influence the interpretation. One possibility is that -wi here is an emphatic marker of coreferentiality. (73) nairikotyoawi
n= airiko -tya -oa -wi 1sg cut TH MM REF 'I cut myself.' (E) (74) nairikotyoa n= airiko -tya -oa 1sg cut TH MM 'I cut myself.' (E)
Marking coreferentiality is the main function of -wi. This may be its original
255

function which was expanded to mark reflexives. Evidence for this is its use to indicate

coreference between the subject of a complement-taking predicate and the subject of the

complement predicate, as shown in (75) and (76). Payne (1997) mentions similar uses of

reflexives for coreference in Yup'ik Eskimo and Yagua.

5.3.1.3

Reciprocal

The reciprocal occurs in what Evans et al. (2004) call “canonical reciprocal

events”: situations with two participants where the subevents are simultaneous and

symmetrical (binary relation in which a stands to b and b to a). The marker of reciprocity

in Paresi is the suffix -kakoa as in the examples:

(77) zakolohekoaheta

hitso

Ø= zakolo -hekoa -heta hitso

3 hug DISTR REG 2sg

'He starts to hug you.' (kani zaka)

(78) zakolokakoa Ø= zakolo -kakoa 3sg hug REC 'They hugged each other.' (E)

The reciprocal can also be used with more than two participants. In (79), the plural set (referring to a group of people simultaneously hugging each other in pairs) is marked twice by the plural marker -ha on the verb. However, two participants can also be marked only once with the plural marker -ha. In (80) there is no plural marking on the verb, but the subject noun is marked by the plural -nae.

The reciprocal can also be found with ditransitive verbs. With these verbs, the

reciprocal marking on the verb indicates the coreference of the subject and the recipient.

The direct object may not be overtly expressed in the clause.

The suffix -kakoa can also occur with few agentive intransitive verbs such as tema 'run' (83) and halaitsa 'jump' (84), which refer to interactive activities. In this case, the suffix is not decreasing valency. In addition, -kakoa occurs semi-lexicalized together with the lexical verb roots aitsa 'kill' in aitsakakoa 'fight' (85), waiya 'see' in waiyakakoa

Finally, the reciprocal can express one of its participants by a separate comitative argument, in what Nedjalkov (2007) calls “discontinuous reciprocal constructions”, as in (88) and (89).

The reciprocal has the same form as the instrumental/comitative kakoa (§3.6.1). The form kakoa may be further analyzed as formed by reciprocal -kak and the middle voice form -oa. Then, one can hypothesize that the use of the two forms has a reciprocal function which was expanded to a comitative/instrumental function. Silva (2013) describes the reciprocal construction as a cliticization of the postposition kakoa. Considering this analysis, then the comitative kakoa would have developed into a reciprocal which is not common cross-linguistically. Nedjalkov (2007) shows sociative and comitative functions are often developed from reciprocal markers. Wise (1990) reconstructs *khakh for the reciprocal marker of Proto-Arawak. She also suggests that *khakh changed from a reciprocal marker to comitative or causative in some languages. Paresi appears to be a case of just such a language.

259

5.3.2 Valency increasing mechanisms In Paresi, there are the following strategies for increasing valency: lexical
causatives, the causative morphemes a-~e- and -(k)i, periphrastic causative constructions with the verb moka 'put', and incorporation of postpositions.

5.3.2.1

Lexical causatives

Considering the definition of lexical causatives by Dixon (2000), which defines

them as pairs of different lexemes in a causative relation (where one is caused and the

other uncaused), we find in Paresi the following pairs of lexical causative verbs: waini

'die' and aitsa 'kill', meta 'lose (tr.)' and hehana 'get lost (intr.)'.

5.3.2.2

Causatives a-~e- and -(k)i

The causative prefix a-~e- (see Table 85) and the causative suffix -ki co-occur

obligatorily with intransitive agentive verbs (examples 1 to 6 in Table 86), intransitive

non-agentive non-stative verbs (7 to 11), stative verbs, and transitive verbs as shown in

Table 89. The causative suffix -ki has a variant -i given by some speakers.

In these constructions, the new participant is the causer in subject function, and

the original subject of the underived intransitive verb is the causee in object function of

the causativized verb. The verbs derived from this process are transitives.

Some verbs such as fira 'be clean', iyo 'dry', horera 'be wet', and kiya 'be black' rarely take the causativizer -ki. Silva (2013) calls the verbs fira 'be clean', iyo 'dry', horera 'be wet', and waiye 'be good' anti-causative verbs that cannot take -ki. I have only attested these verbs with -ki in elicitation, and there was disagreement among speakers about the grammaticality of these constructions.
Stative verbs can occur with both causatives a- and -ki, or only with a-. Some examples of stative verbs occurring with causatives are shown in Table 87. The derived verbs are transitive verbs.

The two first verbs in the Table, kiya 'be black' and zotya 'be red', can occur with or

without -ki constructions without a change in meaning, as in (93). The two other verbs,

maza 'be soft' and watya 'be hot' also occur with or without -ki but there is a difference in

meaning when the subject is non-volitional. (94) is similar to (93), showing that when the

subject is a volitional entity -ki is optional, but -ki cannot occur when the subject is non-

volitional (95).

The four remaining verbs in the Table cannot occur with the causative -ki. A

plausible explanation why -ki does not occur with these stative verbs is that the causer of

causative constructions with -ki must be an agent-like volitional entity. Statives have

experiencer subjects, which are less likely to have control in the causative situations in

which it is involved. In examples (96) and (97), only a- is used, and the causeer can be a

volitional entity or not. However, in (98), the causer is a non-volitional entity, and

therefore -ki is ungrammatical.

Other stative verbs formed by the gender markers -hare and -halo, such as the verbs in Table 88, may occur with the causative -ki when they are nominalized. There is no marking of nominalization, but the forms are nominal because they exhibit the possessed marker -ne~-ni.

The verbs kera 'burn', maza 'be soft and kaitse 'be full' are exceptions because they do not take the prefix a-. In (101), the verb kera 'burn' occurs as an intransitive verb and as a transitive verb in (102), with a third-person causer. The only difference is the use of the thematic suffix -tya in the transitive form. The thematic suffix does not occur with transitive verbs when the transitional and regressive aspect markers appear on the verb, but a difference is still made between the two constructions. Observe that there is vowel change in the last vowel of kera from [a] to [e] because of vowel harmony in the intransitive form (103). However, in the transitive form (104), there is no vowel change.

The prefix e- is a variant of a- found with some intransitive verbs, most of them statives, as in Table 85. The only verb occurring with e- which does not accept a- is kaiyaza 'be dirty'. Silva (2013) also reports the verbs mazahare 'be lazy', maiyare 'melt', and kaye 'flower' as verbs that can only take e-.

Rowan & Burgess (1969) described the prefix a- in some cases as a transitivizer, and in other cases as a verbalizer. The prefix a- was analyzed by Brandão (2010) as an active morpheme, and by Silva (2013) as a transitivizer. Here I prefer to analyze a- as a general causativizer. The prefix a- is not a transitivizer because it also occurs with transitive verbs, as seen above. Neither it is appropriate to call it an active morpheme because a- does not occur with all or most of the active verbs like active suffixes in Guajiro (Alvarez, 2004) and Trinitario (Rose, 2010). The causative a- may be related to the form a of set A proclitics which occur with active verbs.
Wise (1990) says that the prefix a-/e-/i- occurs in most of the Arawak languages meaning 'causative/ verbalizing/ transitivizing/ thematic'. The causative suffix -cho in Trinitario (Rose, 2010) has similar functions: it causativizes stative verbs, verbalizes nouns (causativizes nouns), and occurs as an active suffix, which she hypothesizes is a lexicalized causative.
Transitive verbs such as the ones seen in Table 90 can also be used with both causativizers. In these constructions, the causer takes the subject function, the causee (original subject) is in the object function, and the original object moves out to a peripheral function marked by the postposition kakoa. I only found transitive verbs taking the causative affixes in elicitation. The derived verbs are potentially ditransitives.

The suffix -ki can also be used to convey the sociative type of causation as pointed out by Brandão (2010). According to the semantic continuum of causatives in Shibatani and Pardeshi (2002), there is an intermediate category in the scale of causatives between direct and indirect types of causation, the sociative causative (which itself can be divided into three types: joint-action, assistive, and supervision). The causative -ki is not a dedicated sociative causative marker as described by Rose and Guillaume (2007). The sociative causative may be included within the -ki constructions. For example, in (108), the sentence may have two possible meanings: one in which the causer does not participate in the action, and the other one in which the causer accompanies the causee in the action (joint-action situation). (108) inityo zoima aetonakitsa

The causative a- is also found with two verbs derived from nouns (in Table 76) and is productive with verbs taking the middle -oa.

Periphrastic causative

Periphrastic causatives are formed via the causative verb moka 'put'. This type of

construction is rare, with only one example from texts (111). Further research is needed

to be done in order to analyze the use of this construction in texts. Periphrastic causatives

are often used with stative verbs. The causee maintains its original function as subject of

the complement clause, and the causative verb moka functions as a manipulative

complement-taking predicate occurring at the end of the clause.

In elicitation, there are examples of periphrastic constructions with transitive verbs. Purposive clauses marked by the subordinator maheta are employed for causation. The causee, as seen above in complement clauses, maintains its function as a subject in the purposive clause, but it is also marked as the object of the causative verb moka.

The only example I have of a ditransitive verb used with moka is aotyakitsa 'teach'

5.3.3 Incorporation A noun, a classifier, and a postposition can be combined with a verb in order to
derive a verb stem.

5.3.3.1

Noun incorporation

In Paresi, only inalienable nouns referring to body parts, the noun aho 'road', and

classifiers may be incorporated into intransitive and transitive verbs. They incorporate

immediately following the verb root, before aspect suffixes and the middle -oa:

(116)

proclitic verb root CLF/

thematic

incorporated noun suffixes

aspect middle voice markers

The object of transitive verbs are incorporated, as seen in (117) to (120). There is external possession, also called “the manipulation of case” by Mithun (1984), in which

269

the possessor of the incorporated noun becomes an object, and the valency remains the

same. (117) is an analytical construction, and the (external) possessor is indicated by the

proclitic no=. The derived verb in (121) is a lexical compound which has the idiomatic

meaning 'punish (lit.: pull the neck)'.

'They were with kakanotirire and they were punished.' (Formoso onetse)

In (123), because the subject and the possessor are coreferential, the possessor is
not expressed. The derived verb is an intransitive marked by the middle -oa. This process
of possessor raising in incorporation is also found in Nanti (Michael, 2006).

In the literature about noun incorporation (Baker, 1988; Mithun, 1984), it has been argued that patients are more likely to be incorporated. Because of that, the direct object of a transitive verb can be incorporated, but the subject may be not. In Paresi, only the direct object of a transitive verb can be incorporated with transitive verbs, and incorporation of nouns with intransitive verbs is rare. There are two nouns which can be incorporated into intransitive verbs but they function are more like semantic locatives, not subjects. These nouns are aho 'path' and kilihi 'nose' in the metaphoric sense of 'on the
271

edge'. Their incorporation of into verbs such as tiya 'cry', kawitsa 'shout', and tona 'walk'

is very productive.

Incorporation of classifiers

Incorporation of classifiers is a productive process. In general, the noun or

pronoun to which the classifier refers is not expressed in the sentence. Contrary to

incorporation of nouns, it is not possible to create a semantically equivalent paraphrase of

a verb with a classifier, as a verb whose classifier is not incorporated, as in (133).

Classifiers provide semantic information about the verb argument related to shape

or consistency. They are rarely found with intransitive verbs, and the classifiers found

with intransitive verbs in the corpus cross-reference the subject. For example, in (134)

-tse refers to Nilva. The verb argument may not be expressed in the clause, as in (135)

where -natse refers to a dog.

(134) Nilva itsoatsehena

'The dog is sitting close to the house.' (S)

In (136), the classifier is attached to a stative verb, and the subject is not expressed in the noun phrase (the classifier has no cross-reference).

With transitive verbs, classifiers are used for indexing a direct object on the verb.

(138) shows -tse 'CLF:small' occurring on the verb and on the object. In general, there is

no cross-reference because the object can be omitted, as in (139).

Similar to what was seen with intransitive verbs, classifiers can index the oblique argument of transitive verbs referring to manner (140), location (141), or instrument (142):

5.3.3.3

Incorporation of postpositions

The incorporation of postpositions may increase the valency of intransitive verbs,

or result in a rearrangement of argument structure of transitive verbs70 (they rarely make

transitive verbs into ditransitives). Incorporation of postpositions in Paresi is not very

productive, and it only occurs with obliques indicating location. I will not consider the

forms incorporated to be applicatives because an applicative promotes a thematically

peripheral argument or adjunct to core-object argument (Peterson, 2007), and

incorporation of postpositions in Paresi does not necessarily promote an argument to core

status. Generally applicative forms are different from postpositions, but in Paresi the

incorporated forms are identical to the postpositions.

Of the 17 postpositions described in §3.6, only five of them appear incorporated

into verbs in my corpus: zema with', katyahe 'under', haliya 'around', koni 'in the middle

of', and ako 'inside'. Similar to noun incorporation, they incorporate following the verb

root or thematic suffix, and before aspect markers. When postpositions are incorporated

into transitive verbs, a copy of the postposition may occur on the oblique argument, and

in a few cases (with the postpositions zema and katahe) the oblique argument may be

promoted to object position (a rearranging valency mechanism).

Incorporation of (a)ko 'inside' The meaning of ako is 'be inside of a container'. (143) illustrates a construction where the noun phrase tinihaliti is accompanied by the locative ako in a transitive sentence. In (144), ako is incorporated into the verb moka 'put', but the noun phrase tinihaliti cannot be analyzed as an object of the transitive clause. As it will be seen with the postpositions zema and katahe, when the oblique is promoted to core status, the object of the non-incorporated construction becomes an oblique argument marked by the postposition kakoa.

70 The only exception is the incorporation of koni.

In the example (145), the postposition ako is incorporated into the verb waiya

'see'; however, the peripheral argument habotanetxoako is not promoted to the object

position, as shown by the postposition marker on the oblique argument. This type of

construction is commonly found in texts.

the postposition is the same vowel ending the verb root, and there is vowel deletion,

leading to the form tiyako, instead of *tiyaako.

Incorporation of zema

The postposition zema has a general spatial meaning of being on the opposite side

of someone as seen from the speaker's point of view, when incorporated into a verb. The

incorporation of zema has only been attested with transitive verbs in texts, but it can be

incorporated into intransitive verbs in elicitation. It increases the valency of intransitive

verbs. In (148), there is an example with a non-incorporated construction, where the

postposition zema occurs with the noun tyakoira 'chicken', and in (149) it occurs

incorporated into the verb tema 'run'. In (150) zema is incorporated into the intransitive

verb wahakotya 'look', and the oblique argument of the verb is then marked by the object

enclitic =ene, promoting the oblique to the object position. Example (151) shows

incorporation into transitive verbs, where the oblique argument was promoted to object

direct, and the object of the non-incorporated construction became an oblique argument

(marked by the postposition kakoa).

Incorporation of koni

The postposition koni 'among' may be incorporated into intransitive or transitive

verbs, with the more restricted meaning 'in the field or forest'. There is no rearrangement

of arguments in transitive clauses, and there is no promotion of obliques to core status. In

(160), the postposition occurs with the noun kozeto, and in (161) it is incorporated into

Incorporation of katyahe The only two examples of katyahe 'under' incorporated into verbs in my corpus are (171) and (172), where it is incorporated into transitive verbs. Elicited example (173) is interesting because it illustrates the promotion of an oblique argument into the direct object position, while the original direct object becomes an oblique argument marked by the postposition kakoa. More work is needed to investigate how productive this type of

Grammaticalization of postpositions into applicatives According to Peterson (2007), a possible source of applicatives is zero anaphora: the omission of an object which is given information. In these cases, the postposition may be cliticized to the verb because of pragmatic reasons, such as to make an oblique a salient argument in the discourse. This may be the explanation for the incorporation of postpositions in Paresi, but further research is needed to describe the pragmatic factors determining the preference for an incorporated construction instead of a non-incorporated one. Other Arawak languages also exhibit incorporation of postpositions, such as Waurá and Guajiro (Aikhenvald, 2001). Danielsen (2011) reports the grammaticalization of adpositions into valency increasing verbal affixes (applicatives) in Arawak languages.72 The Paresi data supports Danielsen's claim that adpositions grammaticalized

71 The same construction, where the object becomes an oblique, is also seen in Silva (2013: 262) with the

incorporation of the postposition zema: nazawazematya

Jurandir haira kakoa

na= zawa =zema -ita Jurandir haira =kakoa

1sg= throw COM2 IFV PN

ball =COM

'I threw the ball behind Jurandir.' (PAGRSS27Mar1204.10)

72 She argues that the marking of semantic roles shows a tendency towards a north-south split. Most of the southern Arawak languages have applicatives such as languages from the Campa subgroup and other

284

into applicatives in the Arawak family through incorporation.
languages such as Bauré, Terena and Trinitário. The northern Arawak languages mark indirect object and oblique semantic roles with postpositions. Southern Arawak languages such as Paresi, Waurá and Guajiro are languages that make use of both strategies, in the case of locative semantic roles: the use of postpositions on nouns and the incorporation of postpositions into the verb.

Chapter 6 - Tense, reality status, aspect and modality

6.0 Introduction
In this chapter, I will describe tense, reality status, aspect, and modality in Paresi. First, I describe Paresi as a tensed language with past and future markers in §6.1. In §6.2, I describe the realis-irrealis distinction. In §6.3, the four aspect markers are presented: imperfective, perfective, transitional, and iterative, and in §6.4, I describe the frustrative, dubitative, and desiderative modalities.

6.1 Tense
The term tense used here refers to “a grammaticalized expression of location in time” (Comrie, 1985: 9). Paresi is a language that has morphosyntactic Tense marking, showing overt marking of past (ene) and future (ite), but not present time. Even though these markers can be present , most of the temporal information is conveyed by adverbs.

6.1.1 Past ene The clitic ene refers to an event which took place before the moment of reference

or utterance. Examples (1) to (4) show the use of ene in prototypical occurrences of past.

(1) and (2) refer to the recent past. In (3), ene refers to some years ago when people

moved out from the Formoso village, and in (4) it refers to the lives of the Paresi's

ancient ancestors. The clitic ene is rarely found indicating the tense of clauses in texts,

and is used only when no other time reference is available in the discourse. In the sparse

context of elicitation, the clitic is more frequently used.

nawenane)

In Brandão (2010), I described ene as an Anterior marker, indicating an aspect referring to events in the past that have relevance for the present. The examples below are cases where ene was described as Anterior. In these cases, the situation is located prior to the reference point, similar to the pluperfect in English. In this grammar, I treat ene as tense, following Rowan & Burgess (1969) and Silva (2013). The clitic ene can be used both for past relative to utterance time or to reference time. In (5), the running is marked with ene because that action in the past was relevant for their arrival.

'I was fishing, I caught kalahi, and then I ran, going up.' (JT nawenane)

According to Dahl (1985), the role of past depends on its interaction with other

categories. In Paresi, most of the text examples of ene are instances where there is no

other indication of time reference, such as a temporal adverb (7). When there are other

ways to mark time reference, there is no need to use ene. In examples (8) and (9), the

adverbs kafaka and toahiya are used, and there is no marking of past.

The particle ene generally occurs in second position, and can attach to nouns,

verbs, and adverbs.73 It is widely used to mark nominal past in most of the cases in

discourse referring to people who are deceased, as in (10) to (12), or to a previous state of

inanimate referents (13).74 The nominal tense functions independent of the tense of the

clause, providing local information to the noun (Nordlinger & Sadler, 2004). While ene is

most commonly found with kinship terms, it can also occur with non-kin terms and

proper nouns.

73 As seen in § 6.1.2, the future ite can also be used with nouns, but it has a different distribution. 74 When used with animates, this morpheme can only indicate that the animate is deceased, and cannot
indicate a previous state of the animate in a function similar to English ex-.

6.1.2 Future ite The future clitic (i)te refers to events taking place after the moment of utterance.

It occurs in second position following adverbs, as in (14), interrogative words in

questions (15), verbs, and nouns (16). The short form te is used after words ending in /i/.

In (16), te follows the proper noun Leli. The future clitic and the transitional -hena are

commonly used in the same sentence.

Similar to ene, ite can also follow a noun, functioning as a floating clitic.

However, its use involves non-local interpretation, that is, it refers to the tense of the

clause as a whole, contrary to what was seen with ene. This nominal tense is only rarely

found in texts, as in (17) through (19):

The clitic ite is not syntactically obligatory in a sentence. Once the future clitic is

introduced in the discourse, the future temporal information can be provided by aspect

markers or temporal adverbs. In example (20), the transitional suffix -hena (§6.3.3) is

indicating that the action has not yet ended. In negative sentences, the use of the Irrealis

marker (§6.2) more often indicates the future as shown in (21). Future tense can also be

indicated only by adverbials such as makani 'tomorrow' as in (22).

The future ite can also be used to refer to immediate or non-immediate future. Example (23) was uttered in a text where the speaker talks about a project planned for the following year. Examples (25) and (26) illustrate ite referring to a non-immediate future. Example (24) refers to a distant future. When the time is the non-immediate future, usually temporal adverbial words are also used in the sentence or discourse such as mitxini or mês (from Portuguese) 'month' and terehokoane 'year'.

Cross-linguistically, the semantics of the future involves actions that are planned, suggesting that intention is part of its prototype (Dahl, 1985: 105), which raises the question of whether future time reference should be subsumed under tense or mood in general. This is specially the case when a marker may look like a prototypical future but is only applied to planned or intended future events. Paresi provides such a problem for the categorization of ite. The clitic ite is described here and in Rowan & Burgess (1969) as a future marker, whereas Silva (2013) analyzes it as an intentional modal marker.
According to Dahl, the future prototype involves 'intention', but non-intentional future events can also be labeled as future. In Paresi, ite does not refer only to intentional future events. In (26), the future marker is used in a 'pure prediction'.

Though Paresi's present tense has no phonological exponent, I do not analyze a null Present morpheme since, as was seen in (8) and (22) above, verbs referring to past or future action can also appear without tense marking.

6.2 Reality status: irrealis iya In Paresi, there is a system for marking reality status in which irrealis is marked

by iya and realis is unmarked. Irrealis is used for counterfactual, concessive conditional,

and negative clauses in the future. My analysis is based on Elliot (2000) and Michael

(forthcoming) who argue for the realis-irrealis distinction to be a grammatical category of

“reality status”. Other works on Paresi (Rowan & Burgess, 1969; Silva, 2013) treat iya as

a conditional marker.

The Irrealis marker occurs in negative clauses in the future (27), or with a deontic

meaning (28):

Example (30) illustrates iya in counterfactual clauses. In a negative counterfactual

condition, iya can occur with the negative particle awa, illustrated in (31). In this

example, the clitic iya occurs both in the protasis and the apodosis (sentence in which the

consequence is expressed). (32) is an example of iya in a concessive clause.

Paresi does not exhibit a 'prototypical' reality system, i.e., a system in which reality status is an obligatorily marked feature realized in all types of constructions, and whose marking patterns according to the notional definition of these categories. Thus, in a prototypical reality system, realis marking is expected in an affirmative imperative, but not in a negative imperative (Bybee et al., 1994). Bybee et al. (1994) and others, such as Palmer (2001), consider reality status a modal category and not a grammatical category because the distribution of irrealis forms across languages do not fit into the notional definitions. Paresi is one more example of a language in which irrealis is not used in as many contexts as might be expected.
On the other hand, Michael (forthcoming), argues for the validy of the reality status as a grammatical category by providing examples from Nanti and diachronic evidence. Michael affirms that the semantics of realis and irrealis marking in Kampa languages are very similar. Other non-Kampa Arawak languages, such as Baure and Ignaciano also exhibit a reality status system where conditional, counterfactual and negative clauses are marked by the same morpheme. Data from Paresi also supports the evidence for the historical stability of the reality status system at least in the Southern Arawak branch, which as Michael points out, runs counter to Bybee's analysis of reality status as "a post-hoc label for fortuitous formal similarities in the marking of certain modal notions" (forthcoming: 21).

6.3 Aspect
Aspect is traditionally described as “reference to the internal structure of a situation” (Comrie, 1976: 6). In broader definitions such as Smith (1997), “aspect” includes viewpoints (imperfective versus perfective) and situation types (beginning, end, state, and duration). In this description of Paresi I consider the viewpoints, with a few considerations about situation types where it is concerned. Paresi marks four aspects: imperfective, perfective, transitional, and iterative.

6.3.1 Imperfective -ita The imperfective aspect presents information about the boundedness of a situation

in the sentence, specifically that there is no information about the initial and final

endpoints (Smith, 1997). In Paresi, the imperfective -ita indicates an unbounded

situation. Examples of prototypical uses of the imperfective in the present, past, and

future are given in (33) through (38).

'Go, when you all go, and when you all arrive, you will see that only his wife is

For identifying the morpheme -ita as imperfective, I considered the use of this morpheme in when-clauses, as suggested by Smith (1997: 65): “Despite the flexibility of when, the sequential reading does not arise for sentences with imperfective in the main sentence.” In (39), the main clause event is in progress at the same time as the whenclause event, showing that the imperfective viewpoint excludes an endpoint.

Therefore, -ita is not a progressive and -hena is not an imperfective, contra

(Brandão, 2010). The imperfective -ita can also occur with stative verbs, and progressives

usually do not occur with statives. With semelfactive verbs, such as tonokoa 'cough', the

interpretation is of a repeated action (tonokita ' he is coughing many times').

The morpheme -ita occurs very frequently with negative sentences in the past

reference time, as in (42) and (43). In the present, nonfinite clauses are used instead. That

may be because of the idea that a negative state is continuing in the past.

A morpheme -tata 'continuative' is mentioned in Rowan (2001). The instances of 299

tata in the corpus show that this form may be better analyzed as two morphemes: the

imperfective -(i)ta and the emphatic marker -ta:

6.3.2 Perfective -heta The suffix -heta75 indicates bounded events, particularly actions which are

repeated or restored, implying a return to a state or location (towards a deictic center).

This aspect is generally used with telic verbs, such as kaoka 'arrive', tyoa 'come', zane

'go', and hikoa 'come out'.76 Brandão (2010) considered -heta a Completive marker, but

the emphasis is on the endpoint of the situation, not on the completion of the action. The

examples below show the use of -heta to indicate endpoints (46), a return to a state

through repetition of the action (47), and (48) indicates restored state without repetition:

75 There is a variant -hete due to a vowel harmony process (see §2.6.3). 76 The morpheme -heta is lexicalized with the verb zane 'go' giving the meaning 'go away'.

In addition to the return to a state, -heta also has a spatial meaning, indicating a

motion to some point and then a return to the original location. In (49), the interpretation

is that they go to the field, and they come back to their original location, and this explains

why the suffix -heta is used.

It is likely that the origin of -heta is the verb aiheta 'come' which is described by Rowan (2001), but this verb form was not recognized by speakers. If this is indeed the origin of this morpheme, then the original meaning of the morpheme -heta is spatial. I called this morpheme 'perfective' in order to account for the cases where it does not impart a spatial meaning.
The transitional -hena may be combined with the perfective suffix -heta,

301

indicating an action which has started again as in (51), or is ongoing in the past (52), or

when in the imperative (53).

6.3.3 Transitional -hena The suffix -hena is used in situations where an action has just started, or has not

started yet.77 The general meaning of the morpheme is to indicate that there will be a

change or transition, hence the term “transitional”. It is used in future, past, and present

reference time, as in (54) through (56) respectively. The most frequent use is with the

future reference indicating an action that has not yet started. The suffix may occur twice

on one of the verbs to indicate iteration of an action, as in (57).

77 In Silva (2013), -hena is analyzed as a continuous progressive in the terminology used by Comrie (1985), and it is glossed as an imminent marker. However, -hena is not used in prototypical contexts where the imperfective (or progressive in Comrie's terminology) -ita is used. Rowan & Burgess (1969) also state that the transitional -hena in Paresi is a progressive marker.

The transitional -hena is also used with achievement verbs, such as kaoka 'arrive'
to indicate that the change is imminent. The transitional can mark a change of a state
(inchoative) as seen in (59), or the beginning of an action as seen in example (55) above.
In (60), it is used in an after-clause with a sequential reading, implying that the event in
the main clause started after the event in the after-clause.

According to Silva (2013: 237) frequent combinations include hitiya following any morpheme (heta-hitiya, henahitiya) and -heta preceding any morpheme (heta-ita, heta-hitiya, heta-hena). The morphemes -ita and -hena cannot precede other morphemes (*ita-hitiya, *ita-heta, *itahena, *hena-ita, *hena-heta) with the exception of hena-hitiya. In Table 93, I show these combinations, and add two other combinations that I found in my corpus. As seen in the

305

table, -hena can precede -ita when a plural suffix occurs between them (in: -hena-h-ita). The imperfective -hena can also follow -ita when it is reduplicated in the verb (in: henaite-hena).

6.4 Modality The term modality is used here to refer to a semantic and grammatical notion that
can be expressed through verb inflection (mood), modal verbs or particles (Nordström, 2010: 16). Paresi distinguishes frustrative, dubitative, and desiderative modalities, which are expressed through particles.

6.4.1 Frustratives zaore and motya Frustrative zaore The frustrative marker zaore indicates the goal of an action was not achieved.78
78 Silva (2013:365) uses another label for this marker: 'counterfactual conditional'; however the definition he provides is the same as mine: “zakore conveys that an intention or judgement of the speaker about the value of an assertion was frustrated”.
306

The form zakore is in free variation with zaore. In example (67), the action is intended,

but is not possible, and is not finished. The particle zaore occurs before the clause

expressing the undesired situation. In examples (68) to (70) the action is finished but did

not have the expected outcome. The frustrative is widespread across Amazonia and

occurs in most Arawak languages (Aikhenvald, 1999). A frustrative marker is commonly

used in counterfactual contexts in South American languages (Mueller, 2013: 159), but

that is not the case of zaore in Paresi.

Frustrative motya

The particle motya is another frustrative marker which indicates that one's internal

assumptions based on visual evidence turned out to be wrong. The particle motya is a

particle occurring before the clause expressing the assumption of the speaker. In (71),

someone thought a person was Kabikule, but when he saw the person closely, it turned

out that he was Kabikule's son, Jura. In (72), a deer's horn was mistaken for a branch.

(73) is used in a context in which the speaker saw that the sky was cloudy, and thought it

was going to rain, but it did not. Example (74) illustrates an example in which the

assumption that a man was the killer turned out to be wrong.

6.4.2 Dubitatives Epistemic modality indicates the extent to which the speaker is committed to the

truth of the proposition (Bybee et al., 1994: 179). In Paresi, the following markers are

used to express doubt: zamani and kala.

zamani

The particle zamani is used to indicate uncertainty. It may occur twice in clauses

expressing alternatives, as in (77) to (79). The particle zamani occurs after the word being

questioned or in doubt. In some of the examples the interrogative zoana (71) and the

question word zoare (73) occur but they are not interrogative sentences.

'[She wants to know] our conversation, how we live our daily routine, what we do.'

(Kabikule Daniel iraiti 1)

Dubitative kala

The dubitative kala79 indicates probability of happening (more certain than

zamani). This dubitative occurs in the first position in a clause, and may occur in

traditional narratives when the speaker does not want to express complete certainty about

how the events are presented in the story.

'Enoharatse was already living alone here (I think).' (Wazare)

In examples (81) through (83), the speakers are making assumptions about the

information. The particle kala is not related to indirect evidentiality because its use does

not entail that the speaker did not directly experience the event.

(81) kala maiha ehareza

'It is likely that I am the only one who remembers parts of this (story).' (Kozeto)

79 Again the terminology here is different from that of Silva (2013). He uses the term “potential” instead of dubitative. The clitic ala is described as an alternative form of kala in interrogative sentences. I am not describing ala as a variant of kala because ala is not restricted to dubitative contexts and occurs outside interrogative contexts.

6.4.3 Desiderative katsani The desiderative katsani is a particle which indicates a wish or desire in the first

person. It occurs at the beginning of the clause expressing the desire.

Chapter 7 - Simple clauses and negation
7.0 Introduction This chapter describes the structure of basic clauses and negative clauses. In §7.1
I describe grammatical relations. In §7.2, I start by describing clause structure and constituent ordering within a clause. §7.3 focuses on the different types of non-verbal predicates. Then, I describe the strategies used to mark interrogatives §7.4, command constructions §7.5, and negatives §7.6.
7.1 Grammatical relations In Paresi, word order and the obligatory use of a subject help identify and define
the subject, object, and oblique arguments. The grammatical alignment is nominativeaccusative and there is no morphological case marking. Some of the common ways that grammatical relations are overtly encoded in the world's languages include word-order, verb-agreement, and nominal case morphology (Andrews, 2007). Pronominal marking in Paresi does not involve overt coding properties. Paresi, in this respect, is different from the majority of the Arawak languages, e.g. Apurinã and Yine, which use overt coding properties such as the pronominal marking system of subjects and objects on the verb.
7.1.1 Core arguments There is cross-referencing between a subject noun phrase and a personal proclitic
on the verb (1), but often the subject noun phrase is not overt (2). There is no crossreferencing between an object noun phrase and the only object personal enclitic ene '3O' (3). The clitic ene is only used when the object noun phrase is not mentioned in the sentence.
312

(1) natyo nozaniya natyo no= zani =ya 1sg 1sg go =IRR 'I am going alone.' (Batsaji iraiti)

(2) (natyo) no=kanakairene natyo no= ka- nakaira =ene 1sg 1sg ATTR food 3O 'I ate it.' (E)

(3) nokanakairene

kohatse

no= -ka nakaira =ene (*kohatse)

1sg ATTR food 3O fish

'I ate it (the fish).' (E)

Subjects precede the predicate, though pragmatic conditions may override this (see §7.2.1.1). Subjects are obligatory in a predicate whereas objects are usually omitted after the first mention if they can be easily recovered from the discourse. Personal pronouns functioning as objects must follow the predicate (as the preferred SOV only order applies to overt non-pronominal objects).
7.1.2 Oblique arguments Oblique arguments are marked by postpositions in Paresi and are always optional.
They can have one of the following semantic roles: instrumental, comitative, dative, and locative. They often occur at the beginning of a clause, but they can occur in any position . An example of oblique argument with the instrumental kakoa is shown in (4) (see §3.6). (4) kore kakoa waitsa wola
kore =kakoa w= aitsa w= ola arrow INSTR 1pl kill 1pl game hunting
'We killed our game with an arrow.' (Katomo nawenane)
7.2 Clause structure A simple clause in Paresi must contain a predicate, which may be verbal or non-
verbal. Verbal predicates have a personal clitic attached to a verb (5), or the clitic may

313

have no phonological form like the 3sg clitic in (6). It is also possible to find co-

occurrence of a personal clitic and a coreferential independent noun phrase (a noun or

independent pronoun) in pre-predicate position (7).

(5) nokaoki no= kaoka 1sg arrive 'I arrived'

(6) eaotsetatyo

harekahare Ø=kaoka

eaotseta =tyo harekahare Ø= kaoka

then =TOP host

3sg arrive

'Then the host arrives.' (hitsehaliti)

(7) natyo nozaniya natyo no= zani =ya 1sg 1sg go =IRR 'I am going alone.' (Batsaji iraiti)

Transitive clauses require one more argument in the clause expressing the object;

however, it is rare to find two noun phrases in the same clause, which is not surprising

given the cross-linguistic findings that suggest that the appearance of two full noun

phrases in a transitive clause is marked (Mithun, 1987; Dryer, 1997). In Paresi, sentences

with two noun phrases occur once the participants are introduced in the discourse, and

their reference is expressed by means of personal clitics or independent pronouns. The

examples in (8) and (9) show that noun phrases can precede or follow the verb, and that

there is no marking in the verb signaling the subject or the object. In (9), there is a

second-position clitic ala 'FOC' after katxolohokotsetxoa 'small dog' which indicates that

the object noun phrase is in focus position. In §7.2.1.1, I will describe the pragmatic

parameters which are relevant for constituent ordering.

Example (10) shows that it is possible to drop both subject and object noun

phrases when the object is third person. However, in other persons, an object personal

proclitic is required. In (11) we see an object noun phrase, which cannot be omitted since

the object is not third person. If the object noun phrase is an independent pronoun, then it

must follow the predicate, as shown in (11) and (12).

Ditransitive clauses may have a third noun phrase expressing the oblique

argument, which is a beneficiary or maleficiary (13). However, in general, only two noun

phrases are expressed in the clause (14):

(13) hixirone enana

7.2.1 Constituent order The constituent order is relatively flexible in Paresi, as long as the verb does not

come first, in clauses in which both subject and object are expressed as lexical noun

phrases.80 The default word order is SOV. Four orders are attested in Paresi texts: SOV,

SVO, OSV and OVS.81 The order VOS, which is not attested here with sentences where

both noun phrases were nouns, has been attested by Derbyshire (1986) analyzing data

published by Rowan (1966, 1979). Since Derbyshire counts free pronouns as constituents

for the purposes of identifying word orders, all possible word orders are said to occur.

The example in (15) shows the subject preceding the object when both are pre-

verbal (SOV).

(15) [paula]NP [iyakaniti]NP

[hotikitsa]V hoka nowaiyita

Ø= hotikitsa hoka no= waiyi

-ta

Paula picture UNPOSS 3sg show CON 1sg see, watch IFV

'Paula showed pictures, and I was looking at them.' (Cotidiano)

In (16), the object is preceding the subject when both are pre-verbal (OSV):

(16) zane

ala hikoaheta

"maiha, [nezanityo]NP

Ø= zane =ala Ø= hikoa

1sg son, daughter PL non-Paresi.Indian 3sg kill

'He went, arrived (and said): “no, non-Paresi Indians killed my wife and sons”.'

(Enore)

80 As seen above, independent pronouns have a tendency to come after the verb. 81 The other verb-initial orders VSO and VOS were attested only in elicitation.
316

(17) shows pre-verbal subject and post-verbal object (SVO):

(17) [sarampo]NP [aitsa]V [zoimahalotinae]NP

sarampo Ø= aitsa zoima -halo -ti

-nae

measles 3sg kill child FEM UNPOSS PL

'Measles killed our children.' (Batsaji tahi)

In (18), the object precedes while the subject follows the verb (OVS):

(18) kala [koloho]NP [miyatya]V [mahalitihare]NP

hoka

kala koloho Ø= miya ma- haliti -hare hoka

DUB forest 3sg finish NEG person MASC then

'Then the non-Indian destroyed the forest.' (Kamoro nawenane)

In this section, I provide two arguments for considering SOV the default word

order: constituent order in ambiguous sentences and frequency distribution. Where

semantic and pragmatic context cannot disambiguate grammatical roles, the default

interpretation is SOV. The interpretation is that the first noun phrase is always the

subject.

(19) zoimahaliti zoimahaloti waiya

zoimahaliti zoimahaloti Ø= waiya

boy

girl

3sg see

'The boy saw the girl' / *'the girl saw the boy.' (E)

zoimahaloti zoimahaliti Ø= waiya

girl

boy

3sg see

'The girl saw the boy' / *'the boy saw the girl.' (E)

(21) kokoi owi tyaloka kokoi owi Ø= tyaloka hawk snake 3sg bite 'The hawk bit the snake'/ *'the snake bit the hawk.' (E)

In contexts where it is possible to disambiguate through semantics or pragmatics, such as in (22) and (23), the meaning is the same regardless of the order.

317

(22) ena balazoko waiya ena balazoko Ø= waiya man bottle 3sg see 'The man saw the bottle.' (E)
(23) balazoko ena waiya balazoko ena Ø= waiya bottle man 3sg see 'The man saw the bottle'/ * 'the bottle saw the man.' (E)
Frequency is an important parameter in determining basic word order in a language (Dryer, 1997), but not the most important one. As discussed by Mithun (1987), the rarity of constructions with both lexical noun phrases cannot provide a strong statistical evidence of basic word order. However, I will present a frequency count as an additional argument to establish SOV as the basic constituent order. Contrary to my analysis, Silva (2013) reports that the most frequent constituent orders in texts are SVO and OSV.82 A possible explanation for why Silva found more SVO sentences is because, like Derbyshire (1986), he did not exclude free pronouns (which always follow the verb) in his counting.
The frequency count was based on 18 texts (2507 sentences): 4 traditional narratives, 4 personal narratives, 1 procedural text, 5 other types of narratives (including narratives in which there are some descriptions), and 4 dialogs. There was no preference for one word order depending on the genre, hence they are considered together.
Table 95 shows the frequency of pre-verbal and post-verbal objects. For this count I had a total of 155 sentences with both an overt subject and object (including 23 sentences with subject and object noun phrases). Pre-verbal objects are more frequent than post-verbal objects (almost twice more).
82 Silva does not describe the size or arrangement of the corpus used for counting and does not report figures indicating how frequent each order is in his corpus.

66%

34%

100%

In the other count, only sentences with subject and object noun phrases were considered. The number of sentences with both lexical subjects and objects was 23, only approximately 1% of the sentences in the corpus used for the counting. Table 96 shows the types of constituent orders in these 23 sentences and their frequencies:

As seen in Table 96, type SVO is less than half as frequent as either the SOV or OSV orders. The subject occurs in pre-verbal position, except for three sentences (two intransitives and one transitive-OVS). When counting clauses for Table 96, I did not consider sentences with a complement clause as the object (complement clauses precede main clause).
In agreement with the evidence from constituent order frequency and ambiguous sentence interpretation, Paresi shows a typological profile similar to the OV or verb-final languages discussed by Greenberg (1963) and Dryer (1992). The subject almost always precedes the object (there is only one exception) in line with Greenberg's first principle (1963:77). The ordering relations in verb-final languages are also found in Paresi: manner adverbs tend to precede the verb, genitives precede nouns, and there are postpositions rather than prepositions.

Pragmatic parameters relevant for constituent ordering

The present work describes word order by considering pragmatic parameters such

as new and old information. Based on the pragmatic parameters for constituent ordering

across languages in Mithun (1987), I identified four which are relevant for Paresi are: old

versus new information; newsworthiness, topic shift, and contrast. The clause-initial

position correlates with new information, newsworthiness, topic shift and contrast, and

the post-verbal is associated with old information.

Old versus new information

In general, the subject is expressed by a personal clitic attached to the verb. When

the subject expresses new information, it occurs in pre-verbal position, a position of focus

(leading to an SOV or SVO order). Consider the following passage from a text. The

speaker was telling a personal narrative, and in (24) he talks about getting honey. In (25),

he then starts talking about what the ancestors used to do when they got honey. The

ancestors here are new information. Topic shift is also indicated with (a)tyo.

Newsworthiness

The subject noun phrase may also be focused even though the information was

already given in order to emphasize the principal information. In (26), the topic of the

narrative is the iyamaka 'sacred flute', and the information given is that it is not good for

women to see the sacred flute. The same information is given again in (27), and ohironae

'women' appears in the preverbal position (leading to an SVO order).

Another case is when both subject and object noun phrases express new information. Then, the main information comes first. The following passage is from a personal narrative, in which the speaker is talking about what happens when he was young. Again the information offered by both noun phrases in (29) are new, but the object noun phrase wihalanatse 'our dog' is the most important information (as they did not expect the anaconda to attack their dog). The object noun phrase is preposed to the subject in the focus position (OSV order).

Topic shift

A new topic occurs in the focus position. In (30), the speaker was telling how he

went to gather mangos, and in (31), he shifted the topic. Both subject and object are new

information, but the new topic (the subject) Paula precedes the object (SOV).

In another passage of a dialog, the speakers were talking about someone, saying she was lazy. Then, they shift the topic to talk about a table, and wimezane 'table' is

In the same dialog, (34) shows that when the topic shifts from meza 'table' to

wityatyalati 'our bark'. The object noun phrase then precedes the subject and the verb

(OSV).

Contrast The constituents representing a focus of contrast come first in the clause regardless of whether or not they are new topics or new information. The following passage illustrates the contrast between initima milyahotse 'hot coal' and initima niyehe 'ash': both are in focus position preceding object and verb (SOV order).

In (36), a passage from a narrative, the subject ohironae 'women.' (also new

The following passage is from a narrative about a boy, his dog and their frog. The speaker tells what happened when the boy and his dog went to look for the frog. The contrastive entities are the boy Dirizonae (37) and katxolo 'dog' (38), and both are old information in the narrative. Because katxolo is a contrastive entity (contrasting with the

324

boy) it is focused, marked by the clitic ala 'FOC' in (38). The order is OSV in (37) and

7.3 Non-verbal predicates Noun phrases or adverbs can function as heads of non-verbal predicates. The
following types of predicates will be discussed here: nominal, locational/existential, and possessive predicates. In these constructions, two noun phrases are juxtaposed, the second being the main predicate. In addition, Paresi has a copula: tyaona 'become'.

7.3.1 Nominal predicates There are two types of nominal predicates: proper inclusion (or identification) and
equative clauses (Payne, 1997). The proper inclusion asserts that an entity belongs to the class of items specified in the predicate. For example, the identity statement (“That's a N”), which in Paresi involves demonstrative eze~eye 'this', or hatyo 'that', or a pronoun, and a nominal predicate (with a pause between the two), as in (39) and (40). The subject of the nominal predicate can be marked by atyo 'TOP', ala 'FOC' or -tya 'EMPH', as illustrated from (41) to (44).

Ø= nea

this FOC bat

knee CLF:long.thin 3sg say

'This is the knee of the bat, he said.' (omati-ZK)

Another type of nominal predicate construction is the equative clause. Equative
clauses are clauses which assert that an entity is identical to the entity in the nominal
predicate. The same strategy used in proper inclusion is found to equate two full nouns.
(45) wazolo neare txowaware wazolo neare txowaware wolf name wolf The (other) name of the wolf is txowaware (Kabikule Daniel iraiti 1)

wi= ketse -ra

atyo koreta -hera

1pl knife POSSED TOP bamboo ?

'Our knife was made of bamboo.' (JT nawenane)

Aspect markers and personal clitics only occur with nouns related to the phases of
life including mokotse infancy, 'zoimahaliti 'childhood' and nityohaliti 'adulthood'. In
(48), inityohaliti 'adulthood' is a nominal predicate which takes the personal clitic no=
'1sg' and transitional -hena.
(48) nonityohalitihena no= inityohaliti -hena 1sg old.person TRS 'I was becoming an adult.' (JT nawenane)

However, aspect markers and personal clitics can combine with nominal

predicates which have a modifier (a numeral or a quantifier) as the head of the noun

phrase. (49) illustrates the predicative use of the numeral hinama 'two', taking the

personal clitic wa= '1pl', and the transitional -hena. Nominal predicates only require a

copula when there is aspectual marking and pronominal clitics, unless the head of the

nominal predicate is a quantifier.

'Now it is only the two of us, me and my older brother.' (Katomo nawenane)

The negation in nominal predicates is formed by using the particle maiha and the negative focus xini, as described in § 7.6.2.
7.3.2 Locational/existential predicates The same juxtaposition strategy used in nominal predicates is used in locative and
existential predicates. I only found five examples of juxtaposition among locative and existential predicates, because the most common strategy is the use of the copula tyaona
327

(see §5.2.4). The theme may precede the location (50) or follow it (53).

I am describing clauses that are translated into Portuguese and English as existential predicates in the same section with locative predicates because they exhibit the same juxtaposed structure in Paresi: a theme followed by a location. Existential clauses without a location argument are formed by the existential verb aka (see §5.2.5), or the copula tyaona. Hengeveld (1992) points out that in many languages existential constructions correspond to some locative construction, and this is certainly the case for Paresi. (56) illustrates an existential clause formed by two juxtaposed nouns. (56) Kalini Owihoko nali kohetseti
kalini Owihoko nali kohetseti now Owihoko LOC savanna 'Then in the Owihoko village there is savanna.' (JT nawenane)
7.3.3 Possessive predicates In Paresi, there are possessive clauses formed by the attributive prefix ka- (see
§4.3.4) or the negative ma- (see §7.6.6). I treat ka- as an attributive prefix following Aikhenvald (1999:99). These constructions occur with all nouns, including alienably and inalienably possessed nouns. The nominalizers -re~-ye (for masculine) and -lo (for feminine) can be used when it is important to mention the gender of the subject. In (59), the information about the gender is lexical (the word ohiro 'woman'), and therefore the gender marking is not needed. In (60), it is known by the discourse context, therefore the nominalizer is not used.

As seen in the above examples, there are two strategies for forming the negative possessive constructions, one with the negative maiha and the attributive ka-, as in (58), and the other one with the negative ma-, as in (62). The difference between them is that the latter refers to a more permanent or less temporary state, while the former refers to a
330

temporary state (see §7.6.6).

7.4 Interrogative clauses Interrogatives are associated with the speech act of requesting information. I will
discuss question-word interrogatives, then polar interrogatives, then I will show how question words are formed from the interrogative particle used to mark polar interrogatives, and then how interrogative alternatives are formed.

7.4.1 Question-word (constituent) interrogatives Question-word or constituent interrogatives are sentences which expect a more
elaborate response than simply an affirmation or disaffirmation (Payne, 1997). The use of interrogative words in sentence-initial position is obligatory. These sentences can also be marked by rising intonation at the beginning of the clause (as is the case with polar interrogative sentences). These interrogative words are provided in Table 97.

In constituent interrogatives involving nominal predicates, the question-word is

clause-initial, but may also be clause-final, as in (74), where the noun is focused in

clause-initial position. The questioned nominal form may be a demonstrative (72) or a

full noun (73).

aliyo, alyako 'where is', 'where' There are two adverbial interrogative forms used for questioning a location: aliyo and alyako. Either of them can be used in verbal predicates, aliyo meaning 'where is' and alyako 'where'. Only aliyo can be used in nominal predicates without the copula, as seen in (77).

Complex question words

Complex question words are formed by the interrogative particle zoana, as shown

in Table 98.

Table 98: Complex question words

Form zoana zowaka
zoana heko zoanere zoanama
zoanere hoka

Gloss 'when?' 'at what moment?' 'how much?' 'how many?' 'why?'

The question word zoanere 'how much' is formed by the interrogative zoana and

the nominalizer -re,. The question words zoana or zoanere together with the connector

hoka means 'why' (87). Zoanama 'how many' has a suffix -ma whose meaning is not

clear, but may mean 'quantity' (85). The form zoana heko 'when' includes the noun heko

'moment' (86).

7.4.1.2

Indefinite pronouns

The same interrogative forms can be used as indefinite pronouns together with the

dubitative zamani or the negative maiha. Table 99 shows the indefinite pronouns derived

from interrogative words.

In (88), the interrogative zoare is used with the negative particle meaning

'nothing'. In (89), zoare takes the suffix -ni having a meaning of 'something':

337

7.4.2 Polar interrogatives In Paresi, polar questions are expressed by using a rising intonation at the left

edge of the clause or less frequently the interrogative particle zoana. Generally the

focused questioned argument is fronted, and the verb is clause-final, as shown in the

examples below. In declarative clauses, the intonation is flat with some rising in stressed

syllables of words carrying important information.In imperatives the intonation is rising

towards the right edge of the clause (see §7.5).

Examples of polar questions are given in (90) to (93). (90) questions time; (91)

questions the agent of the action; (92) questions an action, and (93) a location.

(93) nali kotyoi aitsaha? nali kotyoi Ø= aitsa -ha there tapir 3sg kill PL 'Did they kill a tapir there?' (Katomo nali)

In polar interrogatives involving nonverbal predicates, there may be a

demonstrative and the noun (94), or only an adverb and a focus marker (95).

(95) nalitatala? nali -ta -ta =la there IFV EMPH =FOC 'Is she still there?' (Kabikule Daniel iraiti 2)

zoana

The particle zoana is an interrogative particle used in formulaic questions, in

complex question words (see next section), and in interrogative alternatives (see §7.4.3).

The are only a few examples of zoana in polar questions in my corpus, as in (98) and

(99), so it is not clear when zoana can be used in this function.

Negative polar questions exhibit the negator maiha and the nominalizer -re or the

progressive -ita similar to how declarative clauses exhibit negation, as shown in

examples (101) and (102):

NEG father 3sg come IFV NEG 3sg say IFV

'Didn't she ask whether my father didn't come?' (Kabikule-Daniel irati 2)

Polar questions are answered by the interjection hã 'yeah' and/or the repetition of
the questioned verbal predicate in order to confirm the information. Negative answers
simply use the negative particle maiha (104).

7.4.3 Interrogative alternatives Interrogative alternatives are formed by the interrogative particle zoana and the
epistemic zamani 'DUB' after each noun questioned. In (105) zamani occurs after the

340

nouns zotyare 'deer' and awo 'emu'. Another construction with zoana and the dubitative

kore is (106).

7.5 Commands

7.5.1 Basic commands There is no dedicated imperative morpheme, except for a few verbs that have

suppletive imperative stems. Either a verb marked for transitional aspect and a personal

clitic or a construction using the verb zane 'go' and another verb is used. What makes

commands different from non-command sentences is intonation. The intonation changes

according to the type of command. Invitation and request exhibit rising intonation, while

order exhibit rapidly descending intonation. In (111), someone was offering me some

soda. (112) is a polite request addressed to the young people and children who were in the

house where the storyteller was telling traditional narratives. In general, polite requests

are formed by using the transitional -hena plus ira, which may be an affective marker, or

by using the expression haiya hoka.83

hi= zane one ha= kola -heta hoka no= tera

2sg go water 3sg bring PERF CON 1sg drink

'Go bring some water for me to drink!' (tolohe)

83 The clitic ira occurs with nouns and verbs in polite requests and in other contexts to express speakers' sympathy for the entity they refer to. It is not clear whether this is an affective marker or not.

miyatenete

Ø= miya -tya =ene

3sg finish TH 3O

'Go call them to finish pulling it off!' (tolohe)

Some speakers use the forms haiya hoka or haokariya hoka for a polite request,
where haiya may be the proclitic ha= 'you' and iya is a irrealis marker while hoka is a
connector (115); and haokariya is haoka 'you want' plus the irrealis. However, this
construction is rare and occurred only in elicitation; the form found in texts was the use
of transitional aspect and the morpheme ira. More research is need to know how these
forms are indirect strategies for expressing wishes.
(115) haiya hoka cafe hitsoma womana ha= iya hoka cafe hi= tyoma w= om ana 2sg IRR CON coffee 2sg make 1pl LK BEN 'Please, you should make some coffee for us.' (E)

Orders (impolite requests) are marked prosodically by a rapidly descending pitch

and lengthening of the last vowel; these primarily affect the last syllable of the clause.

Example (116) is a quotation of an order made during an argument. (117) is an order

made by the shaman, who was very upset.

In addition, there are suppletive imperative verb forms. Table 100 shows the suppletive forms I found in my corpus. The suppletive forms, different from verbs in commands seen above, do not have a person clitic indicating second person singular or plural. Another difference is that they do not need to be in the transitional aspect, and can be unmarked for aspect (118) or else have the regressive marker, as in the examples below.

The imperative form nikahena 'move.IMP' is formed by the verb nika 'come' and

the transitional hena. However, I have not glossed the imperative form as 'come.IMP'

because it does not imply venitive motion, only motion, meaning 'move, act'. A frequent

use of nikahena is when people are cheering for their soccer team, and they say to the

players: nikahena, nikahena! 'move, move!'

A description of negative imperatives is shown in §7.6.5.

7.6 Negation There are two primary ways of expressing negation in Paresi; one is syntactic (by
using the particles maiha or maitsa) and the other is morphological (by the prefix ma-). The alternation between these strategies appears to be conditioned by semantic factors. The derivational negator ma- is very productive in Paresi, and it is a form attributed to Proto-Arawak (Payne, 1991; Michael, forthcoming). Interestingly, the tense and/or aspect

346

of the sentences are important in determining the type of negative construction that will occur in Paresi, including whether it will have a non-nominalized or nominalized verb. Finally, there is a structural difference between the simple and complex negative clauses found in conditional constructions.

7.6.1 Standard negation Standard negation, i.e. negation in declarative main clauses, is expressed in Paresi

with the particle maiha or its variants maha (a fast-speech variant) and maitsa. The forms

maiha and maitsa can be analyzed as being formed by the prefix ma- plus an unknown

form iha and itsa historically. Examples (129) through (130) illustrate the positive clauses

and their negative counterparts, with the intransitive verb waini 'die', and the transitive

verbs aitsa 'kill' and tyakeko 'believe'.

The negator maiha is preverbal, occurring immediately before the verb, as seen in

the examples above, or before the object. The negative clauses are not identical to their

positive counterparts. In (130) and (132), they exhibit the progressive aspect. (133) shows

a verb with the nominalizer -re.

Paresi is a language which exhibits two types of asymmetrical negation

constructions Miestamo, 2005): paradigmatic and constructional asymmetries.

Paradigmatic asymmetries are related to the aspectual restrictions, and constructional

asymmetries are related to the loss of finite morphology and the use of the nominalizer.

In nonnegative sentences there are two possible tense markers, ene and ite, and

four aspects: the transitional which is marked by the suffix -hena, example (134), the

imperfective marked by -ita (135), the regressive marked by -heta (§6.3.2), and the

iterative hitiya:

(134) nazehenene n= aza -hena =ene 1sg ask TRS 3O 'I will ask it.' (E)

ite ite FUT

(135) naxitene n= aza -ita =ene 1sg ask IFV 3O 'I am asking it.' (E)

In negative constructions, the future can be indicated either by the future marker

ite or the irrealis mood which is marked by the clitic iya. Apparently there is no semantic

difference between the two constructions.

In addition to the change in the future tense, the difference between aspect

markers is neutralized. Negated finite verbs, when marked for aspect, will be in the

imperfective aspect.84The unmarked form is not permitted, as shown in (139). The form

-ita must be used in negative clauses, as in (138) and (140). This type of asymmetry, in

which a contrast in values for a grammatical category is lost in negative clauses, is treated

as paradigmatic asymmetry by Miestamo (2005).

Paresi also exhibits another type of asymmetry called constructional asymmetry,

in which some grammatical categories (such as tense, aspect, mood, evidentiality) found

in affirmative clauses cannot be expressed in negative clauses (Miestamo, 2005:112). In

Paresi, the negated verb may lose its finiteness by taking the nominalizing suffix -re or

-ze, as in (141). Interestingly, constructions with -re exhibit a habitual or temporally non-

specific meaning, contrary to clauses with -ita, seen above.

With stative verbs, the difference is that negative clauses with -re (or its variants)

have a permanent meaning, while the ones with -ita have a transitory meaning:

The particle maiha is also used with stative verbs derived by the attributive ka-.

The clause exhibits constructional asymmetry, using the nominalizer -re. However,

another strategy is also used: negation through the prefix ma- 'negative' with the gender

markers -hare 'MASC' or -halo 'FEM', as seen in (147) and (148). There is a slightly

difference in meaning between sentences (146) and (147) which will be discussed in the

section about the negative prefix ma- in §7.6.6.

In other Arawak languages which employ negative auxiliares (such as Achagua and Bare), finiteness asymmetries are related to the loss of inflection of the negative auxiliary (Michael, forthcoming). That is not the case with Paresi, and further research will be carried out to explain these asymmetries.85
85 Miestamo (2005) analyzes negative markers as uninflected auxiliaries (a negative verbal finite asymmetry), and argues that the presence of the negator forces the verb to take a nominalized form. In
351

One exception to these asymmetries are the existential predicates expressed by the

existential verb aka. There is no special negative existential, and the verbal negator

maiha negates the existential predicate. Croft (1991) observes that languages commonly

lack a special negative existential. There is no neutralization of aspects and the

nominalizer -re is not used.

7.6.2 Negation in nonverbal clauses The negative particle maiha is used in transitive and intransitive clauses and in

negative non-verbal predicates. In this section, I will describe negation in non-verbal

predicates without a copula verb.

In nominal predicates, the negative particle maiha occurs obligatorily with the

negative focus xini following the nominal head, as in (150) through (152). The same

construction occurs with locational predicates, as in (153).

(150) maitsa atyo alitereze

(152) maiha hinama mitxini xini, hinama kaimare maiha hinama mitxini xini hinama kaimare NEG two month NEG two moon 'It is not two months; it is two moons.' (JT nawenane)

Paresi, I consider maiha to be a particle rather than an auxiliary because its presence does not lead the verb to lose its finiteness in all cases, since the progressive can also used with negated verbs.

side of the road' (Batsaji tahi)

Non-verbal predicates which are formed with the copula tyaona are negated by

maiha, and these negated clauses always occur with the nominalizer -re. (154) illustrates

a negative locational predicate while (155) and (156) illustrate negative existential

predicates.

7.6.3 Negation of constituents In order to negate a part of a proposition, the particle maiha immediately precedes
the constituent to be negated. The particle xini, a negative focus marker, follows this constituent, as shown in (157), where the particle precedes the proper noun Wazare. In (158), there is also the focalizer -tya.

7.6.4 Negation in interrogatives Interrogative sentences exhibit negation in the same way as declarative clauses:

they can occur with the imperfective or with a nonfinite verb marked by -re. Example

(159), which is a negation of (160) shows negation with the nominalizer -re, and example

(161), which is a negation of (162), with the imperfective (-i)ta.

7.6.5 Prohibitive constructions Commands have no dedicated imperative marker in non-negative sentences: they

either take the transitional -hena or occur with the verb motion zane (as seen in §7.5).

The two strategies used to form a prohibitive construction are completely different from

the non-negative commands: i) the use the particle maiha with the irrealis iya, as in

examples (163) to (165); or ii) the use of the particle awa, as in (166) to (169).86

The first strategy is similar to standard negation. The use of the irrealis marker leads to

two possible meanings for the sentence, a deontic meaning 'one should not do' or a future

meaning. The intonation is the same rising intonation used for invitation and requests.

Constructions with the particle awa differ from both standard negation and positive imperatives as they do not require the verb to be in the transitional aspect nor use the motion verb zane. They have also rising intonation similar to standard negation with maiha, and feature a lengthening of the last vowel. Constructions with awa and the clitic ira and the transitional -hena are advice. The use of ira also makes the constructions a more “polite” prohibition. The intonation in (169) is different from that of (166) and (167), it is flatter and similar to declarative clauses.

86 The particle awa is not an exclusive prohibitive particle. It also has another use with the irrealis in counterfactual clauses (see §7.6.7).

7.6.6 The prefix maIn Paresi, nouns and stative verbs can take the prefix ma- to derive privative

stative predicates. This prefix can also be used as a means of negating subordinate clauses

(see §7.6.7) In (170a), ka- 'attributive'87 derives a stative verb from the inalienable noun

ityani 'son, daughter', and (170b) shows its negative counterpart with the negative ma-.

The negative verbs derived by the prefix ma- indicate that the subject of the predicate

does not possess the root from which the predicate is derived.

b. mairazehare

m- airaze

-hare

NEG be.savory, delicious NMLZ

'It is not sweet-smelling.' (E)

The privative derivational negator ma- is common in Arawak languages, but its distribution in Paresi is different from that in other languages. In Tariana, for example, the negative ma- occurs with obligatorily possessed nouns and numerous stative verbs, as a counterpart of the attributive ka-. In Apurinã, a Southwestern Arawak language, the negative marker occurs only with objective descriptive intransitive verbs.
In Table 101 provide lists of nouns and stative verbs that can take ma- deriving private stative predicates. These predicates can also function as nouns when used with the possessed marker -ne.

The difference in meaning between choosing to use the syntactic strategy (the
maiha particle) or the derivational/morphological strategy (the ma- negator) is a temporal
difference. In (173) and (174), the difference is that in the first (a) sentences, the
statement is temporary while in the second (b) sentences, it is a permanent state. Michael
(forthcoming) identifies similar temporal differences between prohibitive and standard
negation in other Arawak languages as well. For example, in languages such as
Wapishana and Wayuu, ma- occurs in active verbs as a negative habitual (similar to the
example in (174)). In §7.6.9, the co-occurrence of the two forms, ma- and maiha will be
described.
(173) a. maiha nokaitsaniye maiha no= ka- ityani -re NEG 1sg ATTR son NMLZ 'I do not have children.' (E.)
b. maitsanihalo ma- ityani -halo NEG son FEM
'One who does not have children'/ 'She does not have children (E)

88 Note that in order for an active verb to take ma-, it needs to be nominalized. In the example mahiyokakahare, also the verb hiyoka is first nominalized with the passive nominalizer -ka before receiving the prefix ma-.

b. matsemanehare

ma- tsema -ne

NEG listen POSSED MASC

'One who does not listen, stubborn person'/ 'He is stubborn.' (E)

Inherently negative lexemes in Paresi may contain the negative morpheme ma-, such as the lexemes maotikone 'dumb' and the verb maotseratya 'lie'. However, these roots are bound, and do not occur without ma in any other contexts.

7.6.7 Negation in complex clauses In most subordinate clauses negation is expressed by using the clausal negator

maiha similar to standard negation. Negation can occur independently in main or

embedded clauses, as seen in (175) and (176):

(175) nowaiya [maiha waiye hakita] no= waiya maiha waiye Ø= haka -ita 1sg see NEG good 3sg work IFV 'I saw that he did not do a good job.' (E)

(176) maiha nowaiyita

[waiye haka]

maiha no= waiya -ita waiye Ø= haka

NEG 1sg see IFV good 3sg work

'I did not see that he did a good job.' (E)

Relative clauses undergo negation by means of the clausal negator maiha (with or without the negative focus xini) or the negative prefix ma-. In (177), the relative clause zanehenerenae is preceded by maiha and followed by xini. In elicitation, the negative prefix ma- was also used in a purpose clause, as in (179), though the required context was difficult to invent.

Cross-linguistically, expressions with the verbs think, believe, and want are more

likely to exhibit negative transport. That is, they present the negation of subordinated

clauses in which the negator of the embedded clause is attached to the verb in the higher

clause. In Paresi, there is negative transport only with the verb aoka 'say'. (180) illustrates

an example with the verb awita 'say', in which the negator precedes the verb tiha 'wash' in

the embedded clause. In(181), the negation occurs in the main complement-taking

predicate aoka 'say', which receives the nominalizer -re, not in the verb zane 'go'.

7.6.8 Negative indefinites Paresi forms negative indefinites by using the standard negation particle
maiha/maitsa to negate indefinite pronouns (see §7.4.1), which cross-linguistically is the most common strategy of forming negative indefinites, according to Kahrel (1996). These indefinite pronouns can also be used in questions as interrogative pronouns: zala 'who', zoare 'what', and zoana 'what'. In (188), maiha appears twice, the first maiha negates the verb haka 'work' and the second one occurs with zoare meaning 'nothing'.

7.6.9 Double negation There are cases of double negation when the particle maiha negates a privative

stative predicate already negated by ma-. The double negation results in a positive

meaning, with the negative focus xini emphasizing it. Example (190) illustrates the use of

maiha and two privative stative predicates mazotyare 'not-red' and mairazehare 'not-

smelling'. The speaker chose the use of double negation, instead of non-negation, because

he wants to emphasize the change of state of the red, sweet-smelling pequi fruit which

loses its color and fragrance.

In the next example, the positive clause with the attributive ka- is used (191), and

then the speaker negates the privative stative predicate in order to emphasize that they

were really sad (192).

Chapter 8 - Clause combining

8.0 Introduction

In this chapter, I will describe coordination and the three types of subordination: relative clauses, complementation and adverbial clauses. Coordination involves juxtaposition and the use of the connector hoka. Subordination strategies are nominalization, juxtaposition, and the use of subordinating particles. The nominalization strategy is used for all types of clauses, while juxtaposition (parataxis) is used for coordination, complement relations, and for adverbial clauses (with the connector hoka), see Table 102. Nominalization is a common subordination strategy used in South American languages, and nominalization and juxtaposition are common among the Arawakan languages according to Van Gijn et al. (2011).
The description of certain constructions as involving coordination or subordination is not always straightforward in Paresi. For example, complement clauses and some adverbial clauses with hoka are syntactically juxtaposed, with no marking of subordination, similar to coordination constructions. However, semantically these clauses are dependent.

8.1 Event coordination Coordination “refers to syntactic constructions in which two or more units are combined

and have the same semantic relations” (Haspelmath, 2007:1), and neither clause is

syntactically dependent on the other. They can be expressed through juxtaposition in

Paresi or by the use of the connector hoka. The semantic relation expressed by event

coordination are conjunction, adversative coordination, and disjunction.

As seen in §4.7.1.1, the coordination of noun phrases is expressed by

juxtaposition, and the same strategy is used for event coordination. These constructions

express ordered events that are in succession and occur always in that order, as seen in

(1), or occur at the same time, as in (2).

The connector hoka is also used to express temporal ordering of events (3) through (5) or unordered events (6). It either follows the first pair of coordinated clauses as in (3) and (5), each coordinated clause as in (4), or else only occurs after the last coordinated clause as in (6).

Adversative and contrast relationships do not have dedicated markers, and may be expressed by juxtaposed clauses, though the frustrative zaore is frequently present and leads to an adversative interpretation. Examples without the frustrative such as in (9) and (10) are rare.

8.2 Subordinate clauses Subordinate clauses are formed either through the combination of two finite
clauses or through nominalization. The three types of subordinate clauses are: relative, complement, and adverbial clauses. All three types can use the nominalization strategy. Complement and adverbial clauses can also be formed through the combination of two

90 For details on modality see §6.4.
369

finite clauses. Relative clauses can be marked for tense, aspect, mood, and negation (see chapter
6), but the marking is slightly different from that seen in main clauses. Nominalized relative clauses can be preceded by determiners, or occur with the nominal number marking -nae. There are two types of nominalizations used in these clauses: one with -re (in which aspect is marked); and the other without overt nominalization (the nominalized form occurs with the possessed marker -ne and no aspect is marked). Complement clauses in paratactic constructions differ from main clauses because they are usually unmarked for aspect and tense. Nominalized complement clauses can be marked for aspect and occur with the postposition kakoa. Nominalized adverbial clauses are unmarked for aspect, contrary to what occurs in other types. More detailed discussion is given in the sections below.
8.2.1 Relative clauses In Paresi, predicates in relative clauses (henceforth RC) are nominalized. These
constructions occur with the verbal suffix -re (for masculine referents) or -lo (for feminine referents) which is a marker of nominalization. There are headed and headless RCs. It seems there is no essential distinction between restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses.
Nominalizations functioning as an argument of a clause are different from other types of nominalizations (seen in chapter 4). The nominalization involved in RC is a intermediate form between lexical nominalization and verb forms, similar to gerunds in English, see (15). By intermediate form I mean the nominalized RCs take morphology of both lexical nominalizations and verbs. The nominalizer -re occurs in both types of nominalizations, but nominalized RCs take aspect markers (the most common are the transitional -hena and the imperfective -ita (15c); the regressive is rarely found in texts with RCs) and personal marking used with verbs.

b. moko-re hit-NMLZ
c. moko-hene-re hit-TRS-NMLZ

'he hit' 'beat' 'the one who was hit'

Headless RCs have the same structure of headed RCs, except that they lack a

nominal head. They occur as the subject of the main clause as in (16), or as the object as

in (17). In (16) the plural marker -nae attached on the nominalization replaces the head

noun. Example (18) shows that a headless RC can function as a recipient, being marked

with the postposition. Headless RCs are more common than headed RCs.

Examples (19) and (20) have two noun phrases in apposition. The apposition is clear in (19) where kamati 'death' and wainihenere 'the one who die' with the adverb kafaka 'yesterday' between them. The evidence for the apposition in (20) and (21) is the pause between the two noun phrases. The headless RC in (22) is a dislocated topic

Headed RCs may be externally or internally headed. In externally headed RCs,
91 All relative clauses, complements and adverbial clauses in the examples are in square brackets. Negation in complex clauses is described in §7.6.7.
372

RCs follow the head noun in the main clause. These clauses most frequently exhibit the

imperfect or progressive aspects (marked by -hena and -ta respectively). In (23), the

relative clause is formed with -ita and -re.

There are also RCs headed by the demonstrative eze 'this'. There are a few

examples of this type, and to date there is no evidence of a formal or semantic difference

that these RCs headed by a demonstrative form a distinct class of RC as in Polish, where

demonstrative pronouns head distinct "light-headed" (Citko, 2004).

8.2.1.1

Position of the RC with respect to the head

In externally headed relative clauses, the relativized noun appears to the right of

the RC, as shown in (26) (where the head kawalo 'horse' is external to the RC). This type

of construction is more common than internally headed RCs.

no= waiya

kawalo ohiro =iya iye -hene -re

1sg= see, watch horse woman =IRR buy TRS NMLZ

'I saw the horse the woman is going to buy' (E)

Internal RCs have the head noun within the RCs, and they precede the main

clauses. This type of RC was only observed in elicitation. In (27), the head is ena 'man'

which also is in the RC functioning as the object. The preferred constituent order in

internal RCs is SOV (but not the only one).

'The man who the woman saw bought the horse.' (E)

When verbs are not marked for the future tense, it may be hard to determine

whether the head noun is inside or outside of the RC. The head noun kawalo can be

analyzed as an object in focus position (before the subject) in the main clause (28), or it

can be inside of the RC (29). However, there is evidence that the head is outside the RC

when the main clause is in the future. In the future, the second position clitic ite 'FUT'

occurs after the second noun phrase in the clause. In (30), the clitic occurs after kawalo

indicating that this noun phrase is in the main clause. If kawalo 'horse' were inside of the

RC, the clitic would occur after ena 'man'.

The role of the relativized noun within the RC

In this section, I describe the role of the relativized noun within the relative

clause. The relativized noun can function as a subject, an object, or an oblique. When the

relativized noun's role is indirect object or oblique, the preferred strategy is the internally

headed RC.

Relativized noun is the subject of the relative clause

Examples in (31) to (32) illustrate when the relativized noun's role is the subject

of the RC. In (31), the relativized noun is the subject of the RC and also of the main

clause. In (32), the relativized noun is the subject of the RC, and the object of the main

clause.

Relativized noun is the object of the relative clause The examples in (33) to (36) illustrate when the relativized noun's role is as the object of the RC. In (33), the relativized noun is both the object of the RC and of the

375

main clause. Either object (direct object or recipient/beneficiary) of a ditransitive clause

may be relativized, but I have not found examples of this in texts. In (34), the head noun

netati 'necklace' is the theme, placed inside of the RC, and it is the subject of the main

clause.

'The necklace that the man gave to the woman is beautiful.' (E)

In (35), the recipient in the RC is the object of the main clause, and therefore, it is

not marked with the benefactive. However, in another construction, the recipient has the

benefactive postposition ana, evidence that it is inside of the RC (36).

Relativized noun is oblique in a relative clause In elicitation, a relativized noun has been seen to function as an oblique argument in the RC. In (37), the head noun atyakatse 'stick' is inside the RC exhibiting the

376

comitative marker kakoa, and it is the object of the main clause. This example shows that

the internally headed RC cannot follow the main clause, only an externally headed RC

can be in that position. In (39), the head noun atyakatse 'tree' is outside the RC.

In examples (41) to (42), the nominalized clauses express the time when an event happens but they are not considered adverbial clauses. Their structure is similar to the one seen above for relative clauses. They are relative clauses which modify the head nouns zowaka or heko 'moment'.

Therefore, there are few restrictions on the role of the relativized noun in the RCs. A relativized noun can have the role of an oblique and all roles to the left of it in the Keenan and Comrie (1977) accessibility hierarchy in (43). (43) Subject>Direct Object>Indirect Object>Oblique>Genitive>Object of Comparison

Example (44) shows that a reading in which the possessor is the relativized noun

with a headed RC is not possible. The relativized noun must be the noun halanatse 'dog'

possessed by ohiro 'woman'.

8.2.2 Complementation I follow Cristofaro (2003:95) in defining complementation as relations which
“link two subordinate clauses such that one of them [the main one] entails that another one [the dependent one] is referred to”, since this definition is more appropriate for Paresi

378

than Noonan's (2007) more restrictive definition of complementation as when a notional sentence or predication functions as an argument of a predicate (Noonan, 2007). Based on the morphology of the complement types, there are two types of complementation in Paresi: paratactic complementation and nominalized complements. All classes of complement-taking predicates occur in paratactic complementation. Most of them may also occur with nominalized complements, but this complementation strategy was found only in elicitation. Complement predicates are generally unmarked for aspect (but there are a few exceptions) because time reference is marked in the complement-taking predicate. However, more work about which TAM markers can occur in these predicates still needs to be done.

8.2.2.1

Paratactic complementation

Paratactic complements exhibit the following characteristics according to Noonan

(2007: 65): (i) they do not have any marking of coordination or subordination; (ii) each

verb phrase contains a fully inflected verb; (iii) no special verb forms are used; and (iv)

the predicate may agree with the subject, but does not form a constituent with it (as with

serial verbs). Structurally, complementation is distinct from coordination by the fact that

a complement clause functions as an argument of the verb in the main clause. As I will

discuss below, constructions with the complement-taking predicates aheko 'think',

waiyore 'know, learn', waiya 'see', tsema 'hear', and maotsera 'lie' (in examples (64) and

(67)) are not clearly complementation because the predicates do not require a

complement, and syntactically they look like coordination constructions. Paratactic

complements occur with all types of complement-taking predicates: utterance verbs,

predicates of propositional attitude, knowledge, desiderative, immediate perception,

pretence and achievement. The word order of constituents in complements tend to be

verb final, the same tendency that is seen in main clauses.

Utterance verbs, propositional attitude and desiderative predicates Paractatic complementation is found with both direct and indirect quotation.
379

Direct quotation precedes complement-taking predicates. The verbs used in quotation are

the quotative verb nea and the verb aoka 'say' (which can also be used as a propositional

attitude or desiderative predicate92). The quotative verb nea always requires a

complement clause, as seen in (45) and (46). In (46), irai 'talkʼ is also used, but this verb

does not require a complement; the complement clause is required by the verb nea at the

end. The complements precede the complement-taking predicates.

The verb aoka 'say' is used as a propositional attitude predicate with the meaning
92 The verb awita 'think, want' can also be used with these predicates. Its origin may be the form aoka. They are interchangeable as propositional or desiderative predicates.

'say to oneself'.93 The complements precede the complement-taking predicate, as seen in

(49) and (50). In (51), the use of the noun ezahekola 'his/ their thought' in the beginning

of the clause is also indication that aoka means 'say to oneself'.

Another use of the verb aoka 'say' is as a desiderative complement-taking predicate. It takes the subject coreference marker -wi, which is not used when aoka is used in a utterance or propositional attitude predicate. The complement-taking predicate and the complement may have a different subject, as shown in (52) and (53), or the same

Another alternative to express the notion of wanting is by means of the desiderative particle katsani, as in (56). In general katsani is used when the reference is the first person (57), but it can also be used with third person (58). The desiderative may also be used in the complements of the predicate aoka.

In negative constructions with aoka, the negation is in the main clause and not in

the embedded one. In general, verbs in negative clauses are marked as nonfinite by the

nominalizer -re. The main predicate of complement clauses is also marked by this

nominalizer in negative clauses. In (59), the negation is in the main complement-taking

predicate aoka 'say' which receives the nominalizer -re; if the negation were in the verb

zane 'go', the form would be naoka.

classification of a construction as a complement clause is not always straightforward.

Syntactically, constructions like the ones in (61) and (62) may be analyzed as

coordination by juxtaposition. On the other hand, waiyore occurs with juxtaposed clauses

that function as its semantic arguments. Therefore, these clauses may be treated as

waiyore's complements.

Immediate perception, achievement and pretence predicates

The following perception predicates may be analyzed as occurring with

complements: waiya 'see' and tsema 'hear'. On one hand, one could argue that the

embedded clause functions semantically as an argument of the main clause. On the other

hand, these constructions do not show any marking of subordination, like coordination,

and the verbs do not require a complement. In the examples below, both translations

provided are possible. The same occurs with the achievement predicate otya 'remember',

as in (66) and (67).

One piece of evidence that a construction of this type may actually be coordination comes from examples such as (68) and (69). It is possible to have a pronominal object marker attached to the verb. The pronominal object marker cannot cooccur with the object noun phrase, and therefore the following clause cannot be interpreted as a complement.

8.2.2.2

Nominalized complements

In Paresi, two types of nominalizations can be used as a complement strategy:

nominalization with no overt morpheme and with the nominalizer -re. Examples of these

constructions were only rarely found in my text corpus, and the examples below come

from elicitation. Almost all types of complement-taking predicates occur with

nominalizations: utterance verbs, propositional attitude predicates, predicates of

knowledge, desiderative, immediate perception, and pretence predicates (one exception

may be achievement predicates94).

Complement predicates nominalized with -re are structurally similar to RCs

because they can also take the aspect markers -hena 'TRS' or -ita 'IFV'. However,

different from RCs, nominalized verbs functioning as complements can take the

postposition kakoa 'comitative'. The other type of nominalization is the zero

nominalization. This nominalized form occurs with the possessed marker -ne. The only

verbs in my corpus which can occur with -ne when functioning as complements are the

following: maira 'fish', kaoka 'arrive', haka 'work', hikoa 'show up', and zane 'go.' (see

examples (74), (77), and (78)). It is not clear why only this small set of verbs can take -ne

(not -re). Silva (2013) mentions that only unergative verbs can function as a complement

of a predicate. Furthermore, unaccusative verbs such as kaoka 'arrive' would occur as

complements if they were nominalized and with the postposition -kakoa. As seen in the

examples below, unaccusative verbs such as hokaka 'be sick' do occur as complements of

94 I have not found examples with this predicate in the texts.
386

predicates (84). And other kinds of verbs beyond unaccusative verbs can be nominalized and take kakoa (73).

Utterance verbs and desiderative predicates

Nominalizations using both zero nominalization and -re strategies were attested

with the utterance predicates aoka 'say', in (70) and (71), and irai 'talk', in (72) and (73).

Both types of nominalization may occur with the comitative kakoa, as in (70) and (73).

The use of the postposition in these contexts is not clear, and further research will clarify

its function.

Propositional attitude predicates Nominalizations created by both zero nominalization and -re can occur in complements of the propositional attitude aheko 'think' and tyaiko/tyakeko 'believe'. It is interesting to note that the verb kaoka 'arrive' may be nominalized and used with the possessed -ne (74), but tyoma 'make' cannot, as shown in (76). The zero nominalization in (74) is different from the nominalization in (75) because it does not take aspect

387

markers, and the predicate exhibits a pronominal clitic used only with nouns e= '3sg'. All

complement predicates nominalized by zero nominalization have the possessed marker

-ne. The postposition kakoa can occur with both nominalizations, as in (75) and (78).

Predicates of knowledge and immediate perception predicates The complement-taking predicate waiyore 'know' can also take nominalizations as complements. Example (79) illustrates a zero nominalization complement and the postposition kakoa. The other two examples are similar to RCs with ambiguous interpretations. Further research will test whether these ambiguous clauses are complement clauses (by kakoa being able to appear after the nominalization), or relative clauses, which cannot have kakoa after the nominalization.

Immediate perception predicates also take nominalized forms which occur with

the possessed marker -ne, as in (82) and (83). The ambiguity seen above with the

nominalizer -re does not occur with immediate perception predicates because

nominalized forms with -ne cannot be interpreted as RCs. (84) shows a headless RC with

the nominalizer -lo (the feminine form of -re). This construction is not a complement, as

shown by the ungrammaticality of its use with the postposition kakoa (85).

8.2.3 Adverbial clauses Adverbial clauses are dependent clauses that correspond to the circumstances
under which the main clauses take place (Cristofaro, 2003: 155). In Paresi, structurally, subordinate clauses use the same two types of structures seen in complement clauses: clause combination of two finite structures and nominalized adverbial clauses. Semantically, adverbial clauses are used to express simultaneity, reason, condition, counterfactual, concessive condition, and purpose. Concessive condition and purposive clauses can be used with both structures.

8.2.3.1

Clause combination of two finite structures

In this section, I will describe four types of adverbial clauses formed by the

combination of two finite structures: reason, condition, concessive condition, and purpose

390

clauses. At first it is not easy to describe whether these constructions involve coordination or subordination. Syntactically, they show symmetry, that is, the two clauses have the same status, with no marking of subordination. However, semantically the clause with the connector is dependent.

Reason clauses

Reason clauses are linked by the connectors hiyeta and hoka. The clause

preceding the connector hiyeta is a reason clause, which can either follow or precede the

matrix clause. The morpheme hiyeta has two functions: as a connector in subordinate

clauses, and as a discourse particle meaning 'then'. Silva (2013:414) says hiyeta occurs to

the left of the subordinate clause. However, in the examples where hiyeta is clause-initial,

hiyeta is better analyzed as a discourse particle, and not as a subordinate connector. The

dependent clause with hiyeta can also occur by itself, but hiyeta has a different meaning

in this context: “Then she was already there'.

Another connector used with reason clauses is hoka. These constructions are syntactically similar to the coordinated clauses described with hoka in §8.1. In the examples below, the clauses with hoka95 express a motivating event. In general they follow the matrix clause.

95 The morpheme hoka also occurs clause-initially as a discourse particle meaning 'then'. Contrary to the analysis here, Silva (2013: 416) analyzes hoka clause-initially as indicator of sequence, and hoka in clause-final position as indicator of conclusion.

Conditional clauses In Paresi, conditionals do not have a dedicated marker. Rowan & Burgess (1969) and Silva (2013) analyzed the clitic iya (or its reduced form ya) as a conditional marker. As discussed in Brandão (2010), I consider the clitic to be an irrealis marker because it also occurs in negation (see §7.6). Another argument against the conditional analysis is that iya only occurs in counterfactual and concessive conditions, not in all conditional. The connector hoka follows the conditional clause (similar to the constructions seen above in reason clauses), as seen in (91) and (92), which refer to habitual or generic

392

situations, and (93) which refers to a past situation:

Unreal conditions in which one guesses what will happen are called predictive,

and are marked with the irrealis iya, as shown in the examples below. Theses clauses are

marked for irrealis aspect differently from independent clauses and the dependent clauses

seen above (which do not occur with iya).

was not found in the Paresi varieties I studied. Instead a similar form era was found only

rarely in texts. The morpheme era precedes a purposive clause, as in (104). It is not clear

whether era is a purposive marker97 because it can also co-occur with maheta, as seen

above in (100). (105) and (106) show that they may be interchangeable without change in

meaning. One hypothesis is that era is a formal subordinator form used in traditional

texts and spells, as was suggested by one of the speakers.

Nominalized adverbial clauses

Subordinate clauses used for simultaneity, counterfactual condition, concessive

condition, and purpose clauses are formed by using the nominalization strategy. Similar

to complement clauses, there are two types of nominalizations which can occur with

these clauses: zero nominalization and nominalization with -re.

97 One hypothesis is that era is a archaic form used in formal discourse and dropped out of everyday speech.

Simultaneity

The morpheme -natse functions as a simultaneity marker in nominalized clauses

with -re, as illustrated in examples (107) through (109).

Counterfactual clauses The clitic iya occurs in the second position in the first clause (regardless of whether the first clause is the protasis or the apodosis) in counterfactual clauses which express unreal conditions that did not or could not really happen. Different from the other clauses with hoka seen above, counterfactual clauses may exhibit a nominalized verb form, with the nominalizer -re marking the subordination. Negative counterfactual conditions occur with finite clauses, and it is unclear if nominalized constructions can also be used in negation.

The morpheme eko was described by Rowan (1969: 26) as a counterfactual

marker. This marker appears in the corpus, as in examples (113) through (115). However

eko does not contribute to the conditional meaning and can be left out of the clause. The

morpheme eko also occurs in contexts other than in counterfactual clauses, as in (115).

The meaning of eko is not clear , but it could be a variant of hekoti which means 'at least'.

Chapter 9 - Final considerations
In this chapter, I highlight the major contributions of this work. Among the major interesting typological features of Paresi are palatalization of consonants, a noun classification system with multiple classifiers, a verb classification based on agentivity, middle voice marking, the incorporation of postpositions, reality status, and interesting strategies used for coordination and subordination. Except for postposition incorporation and palatalization, these features were not described in previous works.
The phonology was the most studied part of the language to date. The palatalization phenomena were described here and in Silva (2013). The palatalization pattern shows a mixture of primary and secondary place effects, with different conditions on the targets, triggers, and directions of the process.
Another salient feature of Paresi is the noun classification system (§4.5). The morphemes treated here as classifiers were previously described as adjectives in Silva's work. Classifiers are classifying morphemes that refer to the consistency or shape of their referents and can be used with demonstratives, numerals, adjectives, nouns, and verbs. Labelling these morphemes as either class terms or classifiers, using common criteria in the literature, is not straightforward because they share semantic properties with class terms of Grinevald's classification (2000) but have additional morphosyntactic properties, such as their “agreement-like” function and the property of being incorporated into verbs.
The language has also a verb classification depending on the choice of proclitics (§5.2). One set of proclitics is used for agentive verbs and another for non-agentive verbs. The classification is largely, though not completely semantically based. The presence of two sets that can mark both A-subjects or S-subjects is a unusual across languages (in Arawak languages usually one set is for A-subjects and the other for S-subjects).
The relations among the middle voice -oa and the coreferential marker -wi, and the reciprocal -kakoa and the comitative kakoa are very interesting from a historical point
401

of view (§5.3). The morpheme -oa may have been a historical reflexive marker which is used today as a middle voice marker with inchoative, body posture and motion verbs. The coreferential -wi acquired properties of a reflexive marker. The reciprocal -kakoa may be the source of the comitative kakoa based on comparative historical evidence, when more commonly postpositions become a reciprocal suffixes.
In the section about incorporation of postpositions (§5.3.3.3), I showed that Paresi postpositions are incorporated into verbs and are not applicative morphemes. The postposition incorporation may or not result in the promotion of oblique argument to a core status. Future work is needed to study the semantic effects of this incorporation.
Another typological contribution of this work was the description of the irrealis marker iya (§6.2). One could have analyzed iya as a counterfactual mood used in the contexts of counterfactual, concessive condition and negatives in the future. However, I decided to treat it as a reality status marker and not as mood based on Michael's (forthcoming) study of the reality status in Southern Arawak.
The last chapter on complex clauses was the first preliminary analysis of Paresi syntax which described nominalization and juxtaposition as strategies for subordination in all three types of subordinate clauses. I presented a discussion about the difficulty of establishing the difference between coordination and subordination constructions in Paresi. Some complement clauses formed by paratactic constructions are syntactically similar to coordinated clauses, but they are analyzed as a semantic complement of the predicate. Adverbial clauses with two finite structures also look like coordinated clauses, and the only indicator of subordination is the semantic relation between these clauses and their main clauses.
