CAMBRIDGE LIBRARY COLLECTION
Books of enduring scholarly value
Linguistics
From the earliest surviving glossaries and translations to nineteenth-century academic philology and the growth of linguistics during the twentieth century, language has been the subject both of scholarly investigation and of practical handbooks produced for the upwardly mobile, as well as for travellers, traders, soldiers, missionaries and explorers. This collection will reissue a wide range of texts pertaining to language, including the work of Latin grammarians, groundbreaking early publications in Indo-European studies, accounts of indigenous languages, many of them now extinct, and texts by pioneering figures such as Jacob Grimm, Wilhelm von Humboldt and Ferdinand de Saussure.
The Arawak Language of Guiana
This description of the Arawak language, once spoken widely across the Caribbean area but now restricted to some of the native peoples of Guyana, French Guiana and Suriname, was first published in 1928. C.H. de Goeje was a Dutch submariner whose work had taken him to the then Dutch colony of Suriname; on his resignation from the Dutch navy he continued to investigate its peoples and their languages, and was the recipient of a special Chair in languages and cultural anthropology at the University of Leiden. The book provides long vocabulary lists and a systematic exploration of grammar and phonetics; it also discusses the origin of the language and its differentiation from the other Carib languages of the region. An appendix gives anthropological data, including transcriptions and translations of Arawak myths.

Cambridge University Press has long been a pioneer in the reissuing of out-of-print titles from its own backlist, producing digital reprints of books that are still sought after by scholars and students but could not be reprinted economically using traditional technology. The Cambridge Library Collection extends this activity to a wider range of books which are still of importance to researchers and professionals, either for the source material they contain, or as landmarks in the history of their academic discipline.
Drawing from the world-renowned collections in the Cambridge University Library, and guided by the advice of experts in each subject area, Cambridge University Press is using state-of-the-art scanning machines in its own Printing House to capture the content of each book selected for inclusion. The files are processed to give a consistently clear, crisp image, and the books finished to the high quality standard for which the Press is recognised around the world. The latest print-on-demand technology ensures that the books will remain available indefinitely, and that orders for single or multiple copies can quickly be supplied.
The Cambridge Library Collection will bring back to life books of enduring scholarly value (including out-of-copyright works originally issued by other publishers) across a wide range of disciplines in the humanities and social sciences and in science and technology.

PREFACE
The Arawak or Arowak1), whose language is dealt with in this work, inhabit the coastal districts of Surinam and British Guiana ; they formerly lived still further East, even as far as the mouth of the Orinoco and Trinidad.
Many vocabularies and a good deal of grammatical information have been published from Arawak, but very few sentences of the language usually spoken and no texts at all of myths etc. ; this paucity, however, is compensated for to a large extent by excellent translations from parts of the bible by the Moravian missionaries, and the English missionary Mr. Brett. The grammatical system, strictly adhered to in these bible-texts cannot possibly have been derived from the existing grammars (List of Litterature 5c, 18, 236), and must therefore be attributed to the cooperation of an Arawak who assisted in the translation or in the correction of it. We may then consider them as being genuine Arawak (especially Brett's texts ; those of Schultz contain a freeer translation, which is not so easy to follow).
In this work Brett's texts (11. 5a, b) have been used in the first place, and an endeavour has been made, to discuss all the particularities of the language as found in those texts.
In the second place Schultz's texts have been examined, and all that deviates from Brett, or is not found in Brett, has been discussed here.
Of the remaining materials only such forms have been brought in, which appeared of sufficient interest.
Finally the Arawak language has been compared with the other languages of the Arawak-Maipure (A. M.) '-') linguistic family.
The material is not sufficient for any deep investigation concerning pronunciation, pitch, stress and accompanying gesture ; the vocabularies are not complete ; it is not known whether the colloquial language and the
a) For the different ways of spelling, see List of Litterature 27 ; the spelling •'Arawak ' is at present most in use. and is therefore adopted in this work.
These people call themselves loko, plur, loko-no (see § 164 a) 1 ) ) . The name "Arawak" is only used by other tribes (Kalina: Aiuwako, Apowaka, Warau: Afuw^kii) and by the Creole population of Guiana. If this word were originally Arawak. then it might be derived from aroa, jaguar, or oroa, to perform the functions of the medicine-man : the translation "flour-eaters" (v. Martius. 11. 15. I, 689 : ham, starch, eA:e, to eat) seems to be rather far-fetched.

PREFACE

language of myths and magic formulas deviate from the language of the bible translations ; etc., etc. Therefore this work cannot claim to be an exhaustive treatise on the language.
But Arawak is so singularly transparent, that notwithstanding this incompleteness, several phenomena may be traced back to their origin. This study may therefore perhaps be of some use to linguists in general, and to those who feel interested in the "pre-logical arid mystic mentality" of primitive peoples (Levy-Bruhl, 11. 67).
Those readers who have very little time at their disposal, might after reading Chapters I and II, at once proceed to Chapters XVIII—XX.
An Alphabetical Index has been added to facilitate the reading of the Arawak texts.
The English bible-texts have been taken from : The Holy Bible (British and Foreign Bible Society). Oxford, 1840. — Mr. J. Y. Steward of the Berlitz School, The Hague, assisted in the translation of the manuscript into English.

The Hague. Oct. 1924—Sept. 1927

After the completion of this work, the author spent two weeks in Surinam, and was enabled to clear up several doubtful points. The results of these investigations are included in this volume ; a few myths in Arawak, and miscellaneous information, have been added to the Appendix.
I have to thank captain C. C. Kayser, in command of Hr. Ms. Hertog Hendrik (who is himself an explorer), for the opportunity of visiting this country, and the Roman Catholic mission in Surinam for its help in bringing me together with two Arawaks, and for its kind hospitality.

Brett : a, as in father, e as in prey, i, as in ravine, o, as in go, a, as oo in too, ai, as i in mile, au, as ow in how, ci, as che in cheer, si, as she.
S., Sm. and Q. very probably have used the German spelling ; ; thus equals the sound of the y of B. Sm. gives in his grammar the meaning of the diacritical signs, but it is not certain whether S. has used them in the same way.

v. C. 7a, b, c and Pen. 17a have used the Dutch spelling; thus j~-> B. y, oe-—- B, u, w>^ German u, ie as ea in ear.

', accent, -, long, (, indistinctly articulated.

Sagot and v. C. 7e have used the French spelling; thus ou^^ B. u, u—<~> German ii.

In this work the following abbreviations and signs are used:

Gen. = Genesis

L. = S. Luke

Mt. = S. Matthew J. = S. John

Mk. = S. Mark Acts = The Acts of the Apostles.;

- separates the parts of compounds (only used for the purpose of elucidation) ; where B. uses this sign, it has been retained, for instance in Voforca-kita, although elsewhere B. spells loforrakitin, I'ofitikita ;

( ) indicates : abusively not written in one word, for instance abaptize da (which ought to be abaptizeda) : a-baptize()da ;

| indicates : written in one word, although according to B.'s usual way of spelling, it ought not to be written in one word.

In the English text, a word or a sentence between () means, that the English text does not contain this word or this sentence, but the Arawak text does contain it ; a word or a sentence between [ ] means that the English text contains this word or this sentence, but the Arawak text (or the part that is quoted) does not.

The ' 's used by B., especially with the pronominal prefixes, have been left out, because their application is not systematic (for instance b'usweardoan, thine oaths, bu'sweardoa fa, thou shall swear), or even faulty (for instance mibilokotu b'akada abu. with thongs; mibilikotu = narrow, baka = oxen. (e)da = hide, abu = with). See for the system of hyphens adopted in this work for separating a prefix, § 17.

* indicates a reconstructed word.

ALPHABETICAL INDEX

This index contains all words in Arawak, that are to be found in the texts of B. and S, even those which have not been specially discussed in this work ; derived forms, such as the o-(n-wa) (§§ 4,5) and -kiti (§ 91) verbs and reduplications (§ 93) have generally not been mentioned.
The English words given after the Arawak words are the words of the English texts that have been translated by means of the Arawak word, and as a rule do not exactly expiess the inner meaning of the Arawak word.
The words have been arranged according to the first consonant; an h that shows an inclination to disappear, is in the index not reckoned as a consonant.
Sp. = of Spanish origin, cr. = of Creole -Dutch (or negro-dialect) ori jir..

CHAPTER I

FINITE VERB

§ 1. Let us consider the following sentence:

H-adeka, d-imigoda hu sikapo wolf o-koboroko jin: ki-o-doma ka-

ye-see

I-send

you sheep wolf among

as this 1-because affirmed-

koborokwa-li hu hod jin, ma-wakaia-li bajia huwimjin. To-moroa
wisdom-freely ye serpent as, withheld-evil-freely also ye dove as its-but
h-aitoa-li loko-no o-mun. Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the
ye-beware-freely man-plural at

midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.

But beware of men.

The action-words h-adeka and d-imigoda are composed of a pronominal

prefix (h-, d-), a quality-word (quality, state or condition) or object-word

(ade, strong appearance, imigo, readiness, being ready), a consonant

which indicates in what way the preceding compound acts (k making its

appearance in a positive manner, d to be firmly established, to stand, to

be stiff) and a vowel indicating the general character of what is happening.

The words we here call action-words, are all composed in this way;

they all indicate an activity, and moreover a person can be indicated

who causes this activity or controls it, which person in the finite forms

is indicated by a pronominal prefix, or by an emphasizing pronoun or

object-word, which fulfills the same function and occupies the same place

as the pronominal prefix.

It is almost certain, that, for instance lo-oda, he died, and h-adunka, sleep

ye, also belong to this category; a-odo, S.a-hudu-, means: permanently firmly

established, or firmly established in space (which may refer to the body or to

the soul); adunku- may have a similar meaning, or it may mean "to snore".

Ka-koborokwa, ma-wakaia (see §§ 10, 18) we call quality-words, as

well as for instance kokke, to live; kokke ka i, he lives, probably denotes:

strength appears him.

§ 2. That the a is the real "Zeitwort", appears plainly from those

forms in which the a with the pronominal prefix is detached from the

remainder of the verb (see § 28); then the a acts as an auxiliary verb,

though not as a colourless copula, but with the meaning of "to happen".

The a occurs in numerous other forms, and in comparing them, we

find as a kind of greatest common divisor, that the Arawak language

uses the a to indicate: the aspect of the world in its continual change.

Not one single exception to this rule has been met with.

It has been found, that the i and the u or o are also used to express

definite principles. The Arawak uses the i to express : small dimensions

(in space and time) or high tension, the u or o to express : great dimensions

(in space and time) or low tension, whilst the a expresses that which stands

between the two principles, or partakes in the nature of both.

§3

ACTION-WORDS

49

The Arawak makes no difference between time and space in the way we

do ; the a may indicate both "happening", as well as a condition, or an

object considered in its transitory character (Heraclitus panta rei). W e

shall use for this the abbreviation "time-bound reality" or "time-reality".

The u or o principle is independent of time ; it comprises as it were the

whole time. W e shall translate it, according to circumstances, by "great",

"space", "the permanent", "motionless", "not changing", and the w, which

is related to u, sometimes by "vast", "far away".

In the i principle, on the other hand, time is as it were, contracted into

a single point, into the infinitesimally small. W e shall translate it, according

to circumstances, by "tiny", "quick", "instantaneous", "free", "principle",

"idea", "intensively", "accentuated", and the y, which is related to i,

sometimes by "here". /, "here", a, "at some distance", in the words ikirikia,

our own nation, akirikia, a foreign nation, and perhaps in ici, father,

aiici, son.

The i, and in contrast to it the u, o, are also used to mark the distinction

between man (homo) and nature, or man (vir) and woman. This use of

the i and the u, o and also that of the /- and t-, r- for the same purpose,

we shall keep strictly apart from the remaining use of those sounds.

It seems that the e is used to indicate a principle, the nature of which

may be illustrated by the following comparisons: a sound, healthy,

somewhat relentless, hard — e sickly, delicate, tender ; i quick, idea,

principle — e lingering, quality ; i light — e heat — a matter.

The deeper meaning of this use of the vowels in order to indicate definite

principles, will be further discussed in §§ 185 ff.

The meaning of the a lies between the meaning of i and o or u • the e

lies between i and a ; it may be that Arawak also makes use of other

intermediate sounds in order to express different shades of meaning. An

indication of this may be seen in those words where e and i alternate, and

in the metamorphosis of vowels before -n, -in (§ 81). Sm., S., Q. use

besides the u, o, a, e, i also ii and iiii, Sm. also ue, ueii, B. ii; G. noted

6, 6 («') or 6 (ii) (a mixture of 6, ii and i), Hi or ue, i and ii, and further in

some words a distinct o, in others a distinct u.

Often, however, the immediate, and perhaps only cause of such variatons

is the influence of the following vowels or consonants. It is especially plain

to see, that the i has a trend to oust other vowels, and that it may exert a

deteriorating influence upon d (§84), t (§90), s (§ 113), n (§83*)), perhaps also upon b (§ 125 c) 1>).

§ 3. If the action-word denotes an action that passes quickly or does

not end in a state of rest, then in some moods and tenses, the final a gives

place to an i (table § 5, i group).

If the action-word denotes an action that passes slowly or ends in a state

of rest, then in some moods and tenses, the final a gives place to an o

(table, o group).

If the action-word denotes a prolonged action, then the final a is retained

ACTION-WORDS

in all forms. In this case S. mostly writes a = long a, B. in the forms 6 and 9 sometimes aa ; therefore it is perhaps more correct to say that the final a gives place to long a (table, a group).
In reality, however, one cannot say of any action-word that it belongs to the i, o or a group, for in each case that presents itself, the vowel used is that which is suitable to that particular case. In this way the Arawak can express fine shades of meaning. Sometimes the difference of meaning also appears in the English verb, for instance a-simaki-, to call, a-simaka, to cry, ikisidi-, to judge, to measure, ikisida, to reckon.
In a few action-words an u is used instead of an o. The Moravians mostly use u when B. writes o, whilst the i group of B. is divided by them into an i group and an ii group ; no distinct difference of meaning between these i and ii groups has been discovered.
§ 4. Compare the action-word h-aiitoa, beware (or : take heed) with h-aita [omuni-ni n], know [that it is near].
H-aiita is composed exactly in the same way as h-adeka and d-imigoda (h-, pronominal prefix; aii, presumably "established security", § 133; t, motion towards an object ; a, time-reality).
H-aiit-a = h~aiit time-reality = (ye-) know. H-ait-o-a = h-aiit stationary time-reality = (ye-) know, which remains in itself = (ye-) beware, (ye-) take heed. Oa, ua or wa occurs in a great number of forms, see § 120 ; that one is justified in considering it as composed of o, stationary, and a, time-reality, appears from the forms 6—10 of the table in § 5, in which the a is lacking or is detached from the o. These stationary forms (which we shall call oa forms) are applied : a) In action-words, if the nature of the action is "not moving from the place of origin", e.g. l-idankidoa Wacinaci o-mun, he thanked God, ika ki t-akodwa, Adaie-li o-mun t-idankidwa, and she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, bu-plate-n aboado fa bu-ma, thy money perish with thee (comp. Daii aboadi fa re ororo abu, I will destroy them with the earth) ; b) For the translation of reflexive forms ; the reflexive character is then expressed by -oaiya, self, e.g. b-isadwa b-uaiya, save thyself (comp. b-isada-te di, save me) ; c) Very frequently, by Brett, for the translation of English passive forms, e.g. b-isadwa, thou art made whole, l-isado fa, he shall be saved, fsado-ci m-aici-n goba i, and he that was healed wist not who it was (comp. lihi-ki isadi fa n, the same shall save it, isadi-ci ki di. he that made me whole). Now the o expresses the principle of low tension and the correlated principle of motionless, stationary, or in the soul : the principle of not active, expectant, passive ( § § 2, 190). In so far the oa forms really contain something of the passive. But they are not passive forms, neither are they intransitive forms (comp. example given under '»), and bo-koborokwa di, remember me). Their function is, to denote the principle of independency (§ 188).

MOODS AND TENSES

§5

The final vowel that appears in the forms 6—10, appears also in the forms with -ni (verbal noun, §25), -bi (Perfect tense, § 5 8 a > ) , -bona (Perfect tense, § 6 4 a ) 2 ) ) f _&a ("also", § 6 0 " ) ) , faroka ("if", §144), sabu ("very", § 149), robu ("only", § 150), kwona-hu (instrument, § 120 a) 2)1)).
The a appears also in the forms with (hit)ti ("desiring", § 110). Forms 4 : ga or ka, means "making its appearance in a positive manner — time-reality". This particle is used generally after a word that of itself is indefinite in regard to time (ikita, to serve, ikitoa, to be served, kokke, to live ; also after -n and -ni verbal nouns, §§ 28e), 29), in order to give it a definite sense. It is not used if the indefiniteness may remain (isa, to be good), or if definiteness is included in the construction and meaning of the word, so as with the i and o groups of the action-words.
Forms 5 : ma means "reluctant or hesitating — time-reality". Forms 5 : koma is a combination of k(a) and ma ; presumably an o is used here, in order that a may only occur at the end ; analogous forms : goba, kona ( § 6 3 ) , bona (§ 64), o-doma ( § 4 0 ) . o-fcora (§ 105). Forms 2 : goba indicates a rather remote past; g making its appearance in a positive manner, o not changing, ba, again (§60) ; see also § 128k ) . Forms 6 : [a means "striving (aspiring) time-reality". Forms 10 : ia expresses : i, tension, (released into) a the calm flow of time (see § 132). Forms 3, 7. 8, 9 : -hu, -n, -ci, -tu, sia, see §§ 21—27.

§ 6. The Arawak language does not distinguish between the active and the passive voice in the same manner as is done in English. The following means have been employed in translating :
a) The English active voice : 1) Ordinary action-word :
x) No object: l-adeka, he looked up (Mk. VIII, 24), d-ausa, I go; 11) Object fully affected : d-imigoda hu, I send you, l-adeka ie, he
saw them ; HI) Object affected in a particular manner ; it is indicated by one
of the words denoting position, direction or time, enumerated in § 8, preceded by a particle or a word indicating the "person", e.g. with ibici, lightly touched : h-imigoda d-ibici, ye have sent for me, l-adeka n-ibici, he beheld them ; IV) (II) _|_ ill)) d-imigodi fa-te i h-ibici. I will send him unto you ; 2) Oa form : !) t-eda botoli oakudwa, the (leather) bottles break: 11) Does not exist :

V) Reflexive, see §4*>) ; 3) Quality-word :

in) _ .
rv) Form n ) + object affected in a particular manner: nokonne goba na-konomun i, he was moved with compassion on them, wakaia ho-muni n, woe unto you, lit. you-at it ;
b) The English passive voice :
!) The corresponding active voice has been translated, e.g. L. XXI, 16, ye shall be betrayed, nasikiti fa hu, L. VIII, 5, it was trodden down, n-atenaa goba t-ajeago ;
2) An oa form is used, e.g. Mt. XV, 24, I am not sent, d-imigodwa-te koro ;
3) In order to emphasize the passive attitude, an oa form from a causative is used. Sm. gives this as the usual method, but in S. 's texts such forms are comparatively seldom met with. Examples : S. na-maqua l-ansi-ssia~nu ebekittoa iissa-tti iijahti abbu, and they (his beloved ones) were all filled with the Holy Ghost (Acts II, 4), ki-hia na-kujaba-ka Pilatus u-ria lu-parriikittu-nn-ua u-kunnamiin, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain (Acts XIII, 28) ;
4) A durative form (a group) is used, e.g. L. I, 19, I am sent, imigodaga te di, L. XX, 18, he shall be broken, Hhi a-kurradaa fa ;
5) S. makes use of a -hu verbal noun to do duty as a passive verbal root, after which the particles ka, sia, etc. are applied ; see § 24 ;
6) A -sia verbal noun is used, see § 22. 2) and 3) : If the English sentence gives the active subject, then it is translated by one of the words denoting position or direction o-mun, abu or o-rea, with a pronominal prefix or prefixed object-word ; examples, see §§ 71 b) 2)111), 65, 97a).

CHARACTER OF THE ARAWAK WORDS

§ 7. The words hu, in the example of § 1, denoting persons, we shall call "end-point pronoun" ; other similar words we shall call "emphasizing pronoun" ; the particles h-. d- and h- we shall call "pronominal prefix".

pronominal prefix I d(a)II b(u)[II m. l(o)-, l(u)III f. t(o)-, t(u)~ I pi. w(a)II pi. h(o)-, h(u)III pi. n(a)~

di bu i n (G. also no) u hu r'e

emphasizing pronoun
daii bui lihi, liraha toho, toraha waii hui naii, naha, naraha

The vowel between () is used if it is not ousted by a stronger influence. I = the speaker, II = the listener, III m. = one rational being or male person, other than the speaker or
the listener, III f. = one or more non-rational beings or things or one female person,
other than the speaker or the listener, I pi. = two or more persons, the speaker included, II pi. = two or more persons, one or more listeners included, the speaker
excluded, III pi. = two or more rational beings, the speaker and the listeners
excluded. Emphasizing pronouns and object-words may be used in the function of an end-point pronoun and in the function of a pronominal prefix, e.g. wolf, loko-no. § 8. Words denoting position, direction or time, such as o-koboroko and o-mun, fulfil the role of the prepositions and case-endings in European languages. Here follows a list of those words, with the English prepositions etc., for the translation of which they are used (most of them as given in Brett's grammar) ; for their real meaning, see the § §'s placed after them.

PRONOUNS, OBJECT-WORDS, WORD-CLASSES

D9

§ 9. In substance the pronouns are deictic expressions or demonstratives. The pronominal prefixes and the end-point pronouns are short characteristic descriptions of the person ; from a comparison with other A. M. languages it appears probable that one kind of pronouns were formerly used for both functions. The emphasizing pronouns are compounds of a pronominal prefix with an emphasizing particle. The pronominal prefixes are also used in a manner that reminds one of an article. The emphasizing pronouns are also used for the translation of English demonstratives. That the pronouns denote place, appears also from the fact, that the emphasizing pronouns are composed in exactly the same manner as some words denoting locality, for instance lihi, he, this (m.), naha these, yaha, here (§§44, 45). § 10. The object-words and the proper names have the same character as the pronouns. It may be, that in addition to the attributes connoted by an object-word, it is necessary to mention the person involved, as is the case with a thing possessed, a part of the body, a family relation. Then the person is indicated by a pronominal prefix, or by an emphasizing pronoun or an object-word, fulfilling the same function {h-ada-n, your staves, d-akosi, my eye, lo-iyu, his mother). Likewise the words denoting position, direction or time, enumerated in § 8 are always more particularly specified by a person (ivolf o-koboroko, in the midst of wolves, loko-no o-mun. of men, na-koboroko, among them). These words, without the prefixed particle or word, have no other value than to indicate a complex of qualities, and this explains how it is possible, that both object-words and the words denoting position, direction or time just mentioned, can be transformed into a word indicating a quality, state or condition, viz. with k(a)- (making its appearance in a positive manner) : the quality is appearing, is present ; with m(a)- (reluctant) : the quality is not appearing, is absent. Examples : (i)sa, child, offspring, ka-sa, to be fruitful, being with child, ma-sa, to be barren ; iwi, fruit, k-iwi, to bring forth fruits, m-iwi. not to bring forth fruits ; akosi, eye, k-akosi, to have eyes, m-akosi, to be blind ; id, name, ka-id, to be called by a name, ma-id, not to be called by a name ; o-banna, leaf, ka-banna, to have leaves ; o-koborokwa, remembrance, consciousness, ka-koborokwa, to be remembering, to be wise, ma-koborokwa, to be foolish ; o-loko, in (or: inside, interior), ka-loko, to have contents, to be filled, ma-loko. to be empty. §11. a) Emphasizing pronouns, object-words, proper names, words denoting position, direction or time, and quality-words can be used as a verb, denoting the state or condition to be, whatever the word expresses. The action-words with unalterable ending, namely the a group, and the verbal nouns, may be included in this category. Notionallv they have in common : indefiniteness in regard to time ; in form : unalterable ending :

60

WORD-ORDER ; EMOTIONAL CHARACTER

§ 12

grammatically : that the different moods and tenses are formed in the same way (see §§5, 12, 21—27).
b) But the particles by which moods and tenses are formed, are even employed when the word is used in a function that may be fulfilled by a pronominal prefix or an end-point pronoun, e.g. [David adaie-li-wabu kasa goba Solomon] Urias ke-tu goba o-mun, [and David the king begat Solomon] of her that had been the wife of Urias ; see also the forms with (S.) kuba, pa, § 176 b) 2, 3), the forms with ka, § 29 a), with bia, § 39, and the -hu etc. forms, § 24.
c) Concerning the action-words with inflected endings, we have seen already, that the different end-vowels describe the different shades of reality. When we take this into consideration, we see that these words have nothing in their construction that distinguishes them from the other classes of words. Moreover the action-words are used in the sentence in quite the same way as the quality-words (see the examples in § 12), and furthermore certain quality-words may perform the function of action-words (§ 18).
d) In the following example we meet the Indicative mood, Present tense of an action-word doing duty as an object-word : aiakatwa o-loko, privily, in secret (parallel to m-aiakato-n-wa oAoko, public, openly), ororo a-iiboa, the end of the world (parallel to : ororo a-iibo-n-wa o-bora-n, unto the end of the world). Comp. also : l-iciga goba, he digged (a-cigi-, to dig), aciga, a ditch.
§ 12. Let us now turn our attention to the structure of sentences. In Arawak the sentence consists of one or more words which indicate something that is new to the hearer (at any rate in this connexion, or under these circumstances), and often there is moreover indicated the thing that the hearer already knows, to which this new piece of information is added. That which is most intended to attract the attention of the hearer, is first said ; generally this is the most mobile or the most particular thing, or that which dominates the situation. The thing which is least mobile, which is already known, or which is in an expectant or passive attitude, is mentioned the last, unless it must be spoken first, in order to attract special attention. Word-order is determined by the emotional, in so far as reality, as the logical connexion between the things to be described, will permit. a) i) lihi-ki Daii, [ajia-ci bu-mun], I [that speak unto thee] am he ; 2) kenbena ada n, and (it) becometh a tree, Roman i, [having understood that] he was a Roman, Roman~o bari-ni waii. being Romans (indeed we), Peter bui, thou art Peter, Gabriel daii, I am Gabriel, Matthat aiici lihi, which was the son of Matthat, John /-in, his name is John ; 3) yaha u, we are present, lo-tokaini o-loko i, [they shall say : behold] he is in the (his) secret chambers, lo-ma kiana u, and (we) abode with him ; 4) isa n ! well done ! wakaia i, he is guilty, he is a debtor ; 5) l-adeka ie, he saw them, d-imigoda hu, I send you, b-ikiduadi-n isada (=i'sa, sound, -d-a) bu, thy faith hath made thee whole ;

§ 13. If several action-words are to be placed in one sentence, then the

Arawak expresses the most important action by a form with the ending

-a (-a, -a goba, -i fa, -o fa, -a fa, etc.). Examples :

By this means the Arawak can single out one among several actions,

as that which is to be represented as the most important or primary (see

for further examples, § 27). And he even can focus the attention on the

fact that an action occurs, by splitting up the action-word into a part

containing the -a with the pronominal prefix, and a less vivid form.

62

containing the description of the action (§§28, 42). See also §§ 55, 145,
147, 148, 151, 153. § 14. In the course of this work it will appear, that the great majority
of Arawak words are built up from small particles, each of which represents a definite part of the total experience ; the same principles that rule the word-order in the sentence, determine the sequence of those particles.
Should one consider the Arawak word as a compound of the type -attribute—attributei-subject, -adverb-adjective-substantive, or (Jespersen, 65 b) -subjunct-adjunct-subject, -tertiary-secondary-primary, then it follows from this, that all Arawak words are object-expressions in which the ending represents the object. Now, however, that ending is always a vowel, or a vowel with a durative -n, and neither of these endings attains that degree of solid concreteness, which we connect with an "object".
The nature of the Arawak word is better described, when we say : the different peculiarities are mentioned one after another ; the sequence is, that the most striking, the most new (also: that which dominates the situation) goes first, and the least striking, the already known (also : that which is expectant or passive) follows.
When the speaker begins to speak a word, the plan of the whole word is already latent in his sub-consciousness, and it is already decided upon, what general or known idea will be expressed at the end of the form. Therefore the consideration which we had to reject just now, contains nevertheless a particle of truth.
Our first supposition would lead to the conclusion that Arawak has only prefixes ; our second supposition would lead us to the conclusion that Arawak has only suffixes. For the sake of convenience, however, we shall in this work make use of both terms.
§ 15. a) The following compounds of two object-words must be considered as junctions, because if a pronominal prefix is applied, it is put before the first word : [ig-ada, fig-tree, ada iwi, the fruit of the tree, figiwi, fig (fruit) c-iwi eda, the husks (its fruit-skin), t-eda botoli, bottles (its hide-bottle), m-ibiloko-tu baka-da, thongs (un-broad-thing cow-hide), hell ikihi, hell fire, ikihi-sikwa, a furnace of fire, ikihi-kudu, sticks (fire-things), yuvua kwama, a crown of thorns.
*>) In the same way words denoting position, direction or time may be compounded. See the list in § 8 and : bo-boreda bawhu-yura b-uaiya b-akosi o~toko area, cast out the beam out of thine own eyes. H-eta homakwa to-loko area, [he took the cup ... saying] Drink ye all of it.
c) In the following examples a form combined with an end-point pronoun or with a word denoting position, direction or time, is used in a function which might also be fulfilled by a single pronoun or object-word :
kena adeki-ci, adeka imigodo-ci di, and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me, a-forri-ci i eke daii ikita goba bajia, and (I) kept the raiment of them that slew him, d-ausa imigodo-ci di ibici-ro, I go my way to him that sent me, oaboddi-ci da-kona, he that abideth in me [bringeth forth fruit],

h-ansi-li k-aiima-ci-no ho-mun, love your enemies, ausi-ci lo-bora, ausi-ci bajia l-iinabo a-simaka goba, ajia-n, Hosanna, and they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna, Roman i o-konomun d-akonnabo-n o-doma, having understood that he was a Roman, lit. Roman he concerning my-hearing because, l-adagata i alomun kondi-n i. L-aici-n bena Cilicia kondi-n i, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia, lit. he-ask him where of-a-place-being he. His-knowing after Cilicia of-a-place-being he, kena, abaren kabuin-o wadili anda ibin yumun-tu di bawhu mun, and, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I •was.
d ) Other examples of compound forms, used as a single word, are the following :
isa koro onnaka-he bia i, [Paul thought] not good to take him [with them], lit. good-not-taking to-be he, tanahu warea k-iwi fa koro ada bu ma-iibo-n-wa-tu bia, let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever, lit. now from with-fruit-future-not-tree thou not-ending-thing to-be.
§ 16. a ) The pronominal prefix is attributive, and forms a compound with the word to which it is prefixed.
An emphasizing pronoun or an object-word can be used in the same function (and must then be put in the same place). Seeing that such a word attracts the attention much more than the pronominal prefix, the way in which it is felt perhaps more nearly approaches that of an English subject.
In the following examples the person indicated by the pronominal prefix, is (for our, European, analysis) in some cases subject, dominating, origin, in others object, subordinate, endpoint. But really the function of the pronominal prefix is always the same, viz. to indicate the person who is considered as being connected with the matter from its origin, the person who is in a strong position (in respect to a state of movement : active, in respect to a stationary condition : potential).
Examples : l-imigoda ie, (he) sent them, lo-bapti:e()da goba ie, (they) were baptized of him, da-dankidwa bu.~m.un, I thank thee, d-imigodwa-te, I am sent (N.B. : these forms are not genuine passives, see § 6), l-isi, his head, John Baptist isi, John Baptist's head, lo-bugici. the (his) brother, John o-bugici, the brother of John, da-sanci, my servant. d-Adaie-n, my Lord, ho-wakaia, your sins, /o/co o-wakaia, the wickedness of man, da-plate-n, my money, a-fogodo-ci-no plate-n, the changers' money, n-anda l-amun. (they) come to him, n-anda Jesus amun. they come to Jesus, Judea warea. [he came] from Judaea. Judea mun i-ro, [he went] into Judaea, Jerusalem mun, [he was] in Jerusalem, fyauhahu bajia w-afuji-ga bu-iri o-doma. even the devils are subject unto us through thy name. lit. devil also we-rule thy-name because, w-afudyi-no. the (our) rulers. b) If a person who can be indicated by a pronominal prefix, is understood or must be understood to be there, the Arawak always mentions the person. Examples :

64

INITIAL VOWEL

§ 17

h-adeka, (ye) behold, b-adeka, (thou) behold (L. I, 31), bui, da-sa, thou, (my) child, l-isanci ifHi sabu-ka koto l-adaie-n aji, the (his) servant is not greater than his lord, l-oonaba goba n ajia-n na-mun, Abona~ci sa-tu t-isi, loko Aiici, he answered (it) and said unto them, He that soweth the good (its) seed is the Son of man, Adaie-li tanahu b-isiki [a Israel o-mun n-isauka ba ? Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the (their) kingdom to Israel ?
c) On the other hand the person is never indicated twice. One says Jesus o-kuti, the feet of Jesus, or lo-kuti, his feet, but never (as is customary in several languages, also in A. M. languages, see § 181) Jesus lo-kuti. A deviation is only made from this rule for the purpose of emphasis. Examples:
bu-iauda-a Paul, Paul, thou art beside thyself, ama w-onyi-ka waii ? what do we ? (J. XI, 47), b-ose bui, go ! (L. X, 37), to-moroa hui h-aiitoa, but take ye heed (Mk. XIII, 23), hui h-onnaka i, take ye him (J. XIX, 6), S. dai a-sseki-n\da\ppa bu-miin kiakewai u-hurruru, (I giving I-shall thee-to this country).
d) G. The words bahii, house, hamaka, hammock, kabuya, planted field, waboroko, path, awa, father, tete, mother, and perhaps others, do not take a pronominal prefix. If, however, a pronominal prefix must be applied, then the synonimes sikwa, kura, akoban, abonaha, ici, yu are used.
§ 17. In the composition of a prefix with a word, the vowel belonging to the prefix may be retained (Zo fa, S. lu-ppa, he shall do).
If the word begins with a vowel which on account of the intrinsic meaning of the word cannot be left out, then this vowel supplants the vowel of the prefix (l-a, he did).
If the word contains many i sounds, then this sound often influences the vowel of the prefixes and suffixes (isi, seed, head, rounded surface, m-isi, to be straight, right, h-imisi-hi, your righteousness, misi-ci-no, the just, m-imisi-ci-no, the unjust; kidua, to be true, w-ikiduada, we believe, n-imikiduadi-n, their unbelief).
Sometimes there is a sort of compromise between the vowel of the prefix and that of the word (da-sikwa, my house, b-isikwa, thy house, ka-sikwa, to dwell; sapatu, a shoe, l-isapatu-n, his shoe ; kaspara, a sword, bukaspare-n thy sword, l-ikaspare-n, his sword ; Spanish vela, sail, na-welanwa, (their) sail, w-eweladoa, we sailed, ma-sogosoko-tu akabo abu, with unwashen hands, w-akabo, our hands, bu-kabo, thy hand, to-kabo, her hand).
Sometimes both vowels are pronounced (da-iiri, my name, bu-iri, l-iri, virgin iri).
If there is no prefix, as with abstracts and agent-nouns or if instead of a pronominal prefix, an emphasizing pronoun or an object-word is used, then there are four possibilities :
a) The vowel is indispensable to the word, and is retained (adeki-ci, one who sees) ;
b) A vowel belonging to the word, is sometimes used and sometimes

§ 18

K ( A ) - AND M ( A ) - QUALITY-WORDS, ETC.

65

left out (Peter isikwa, Peter's house, isikwa-hu, villages, Israel sikwa, the house of Israel) ;
c) No vowel is applied {atenwa-tu kaci, the first month, kena abav mihu o-lokomun l-iiga, Simon\i()mihu ia, and he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's) ;
d) An a- is prefixed to a word denoting an event, an o- to an objectword or a word denoting position, direction or time ; by this means as it were the general character of the word is announced {lo-bapti:e()da goba ie, (they) were baptized of him, John a-baptizeda goba i, (he) was baptized of John, lo-bugici, the (his) brother, John o-bugici, the brother of John, a-burita-sia ... a-burito-n-wa Greek o-buri abu, a superscription was written in letters of Greek, wol[ o-koboroko. in the midst of wolves, /o/co o-wakaia o-ma, with man ('s evil), camel o-barra, camel's hair, a-koto-, to eat, Adaie-li o-koto-n, the Supper of the Lord).

The system of applying hyphens which has been adopted in this work will appear sufficiently from the examples given.
§ 18. The quality-words formed from object-words and words denoting position, direction or time, by prefixing k(a)-. to be with, or m(a)-. to be without (§ 10). may. if necessary, also perform the function of an actionword, see examples below. The English subject is then indicated by an emphasizing pronoun or an object-word that is placed before the word (a, )) l) ID). With the k(a)- forms a pronominal prefix can also be used ; the prefix k(a)~ is then left out, presumably because it then becomes superfluous (;|. b) - ) ) . In case it is desired to use a pronominal prefix with the m(a)- form, the pronominal prefix is connected with the auxiliary verb a (t>) 2)).

Ka-koborokwa, ma-kobotokwa are indefinite in regard to time, and may

remain so, at least in the examples met with ; k-ansi and m-ansi are also

indefinite in regard to time, but in the Indicative mood, the indefiniteness

must be removed. For that purpose, with k-ansi, ka is added to form the

Present tense (Potential mood /coma), conformable to § 5 ; with m-ansi,

ma. containing the element of uncertainty is added. Such forms are

comparable to the action-words of the a group. In the same wav a-bolli, to

In the same way we might consider ka-koborokwa and k-ansi. when they fulfil the function of action-words, as : to produce remembrances, to produce inner peace ; and so with other words as well. § 19. The end-point pronoun is exclusively used : 10. after a quality-word (word denoting a state or condition), and then it indicates the person who is in that state or condition ; 2°. after an action-word, and then it indicates the person who undergoes the action, or the object fully affected. As the Arawak pronounces first the emotionally dominant, a sentence

§ 20

GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE ARAWAK WORD

67

of the type kokke ka. i ! he lives ! , has in reality the value : life (or vital power) !!! appears !! (male third) person !
From this we may assume that some correlation exists between the place behind the word of the end-point pronouns, their expectant, passive function, and their short forms.
On account of this prescribed order of words, the combination of a word with an end-point pronoun has something in common with a junction.
This appears still more strongly with the interrogative words m. alika-i. f. alika-n, pi. alika-ie (§ 139 e)) in which the end-point pronoun remains, even when the person indicated by it is already represented by an objectword or an emphasizing pronoun.
S. always uses this construction : Zu-parra baddia kassiparra abbu i Jacobus Johannes u-hukiti, and he killed James the brother of John with the sword, lit. he-kill also sword with him Jacobus Johannes' brother, lu-morrua Joseph u-ma kuba i Gott, but God was with him, lit. he-but Joseph with past-time he God, na-ssimaki-nbenna\je Apostel-nu n-ibiti ba, and they called them, lit. their-calling-after them Apostles them-to again, bu-mallita-te wa-mallitta-koana-nu-tti bia\u, make us gods, lit. thou-make gods to-be-us, n-assa-ka kiahanna i Barnabas, Jupiter, Paulus na-rita\i Meccurius, and they called (him) Barnabas. Jupiter; and Paul (they named him), Mercurius. Such pleonasms also occur in other A. M. languages, see § 181. G. The end-point pronouns are generally pronounced as if they form part of the preceding word. § 20. Before we plunge into the mass of forms, we shall make a few supplementary remarks concerning the general character of the Arawak word. ^Vhen, in § 1, we analyzed d~imigoda, I send, there remained a root imigo, readiness, being ready. This root can again be split into imi, being willing, and g, a force manifesting itself, o, permanently. And imi can be split into i, quick, m. humble or new. i, quick. In every analysis of a genuine Arawak word we experience the same. It appears that the real psychological roots of Arawak, synchronistically conceived, are : a, e, i, (u), o or u, y, w, h, (g), k, n, I, r, d, t, s, m, b, and f or p, each of which has a definite (and always the same) meaning, or represents an elementary principle. Such a word gives a short description of the thing. The description begins with that which appears first in time or that which is considered as the origin or the basis of the thing. The connexion appears from the sequence, and in the sequence appear fluent transitions and contrasts. The word may be compared to a sentence which has been contracted into a single compound. We may still mention the fact, that not one case has been met with, of a sound having lost its original meaning when used in a compound (as. for instance, hydrogen and oxygen in water have lost their gaseous quality).

GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE ARAWAK WORD

§ 20

W i t h the exception of -n (perhaps also -r in abar, one), consonants are only used before a vowel; they model as it were the formless principle expressed by the vowel. For instance, the particles, 6a, again, bi, just now, bo (to remain) at rest for a time, are composed of a, time-reality, i instantaneous, o permanent, with b, the way in which a surface, a shape, presents itself, or quiet, passionless appearance.
Two vowels express : (1) i—i, quick, tiny, full of energy, (2) a—a, normal, (3) u—u or o—o, slow, great, little energy, (4) i—a, i—u, a—u, slowing down, widening out, relaxing of tension, (5) a—/, u—i, u—a, accelerating, narrowing, tightening.
Examples : (1) hihi, reed, in, a name, isi, seed, iwi, fruit, ibi, ready, ifi, great (striving), (2) ana, the midst (in compounds), ala, Indian seat, aba, a, one, other, ada, a tree, ama, what, (3) ororo, earth, a-odo-, to die, (4) iha, "there was once", ina, a beginning, a continuation, *enu (A. M.), heaven, eda, bark, skin (loosely connected with the tree or the body), (5) ani, a thing, aid, a tooth, adi, something protruding (in compounds), ona, the ground (in compounds).
Now there is a habit of speech, which requires that, for instance in order to express "to send", one should always use the sound-sequence imigod, but it is quite probable that the Arawak feels this root more or less as [(i-m-i)-g-ojd.
When the European thinks, reasons and describes, then for him the most real, that to which everything else seems to be attached, is the "concrete object". Actions and qualities remain for him on another level of consciousness, in the sphere of feeling and will ; and if he wishes to think about an action or a quality, he cannot do so without imagining an object which performs or undergoes the action, or possesses the quality. The use of abstract nouns is really an endeavour to transform an action or a quality into a mental image, namely to make an "object" of it. It remains, however, halting between the two opposites : imagination and thought (the motionless, the dead) and feeling and will (the living, the active).
The Arawak language expresses that which lies in the sphere of the feelings and the will.
The European of our time lives alternately in the sphere of imagination and thought and in the sphere of feeling and will ; the Arawak probably lives chiefly in the sphere of feeling and will, and this explains how it comes that he expresses himself in elementary principles, which to us appear as abstractions. In § 184 we shall see that his feelings are transformed into a sort of gesture-language of the organs of speech, with the result that to each element of feeling, or elementary principle, corresponds a definite sound.
Considered from the outside, these elementary principles describe different shades of activity, and if we consider the ending of a word as its centre of gravity (§ 14). then we see that the words do the same. In accordance with this, endings which determine the character of an action-

§ 20

GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE ARAWAK WORD

69

word (for instance ki, di, ti or ci, li, -n), may determine the character of an object-word as well, and we can now understand, how it comes that the European lines of demarcation between word-classes are non-existent in Arawak (§§9—11).
The following may be noted here, because it deviates from the accepted opinions as to the character of the languages of primitive peoples :
The Arawak can just as easily express what we call the abstract, as what we call the concrete.
He has special names for every sort of fish, every kind of tree, but he also has the words himi = fish, and ada = tree. These 'words describe "fish" and "tree" (see §§ 76b>. 89), and, so far as we can see, they are not the names for a special sort, which have later been applied to the whole group. Likewise the names for special sorts are in general not derived from himi and ada, although such forms occur (§ 199, names of tiger-cats and snakes).
In itself, the meaning of the Arawak word is as general as the value of its component parts permits. The habit of speech restricts that meaning, and also often requires the use of certain affixes, by which the meaning is further restricted. Ultimately the word is confined to a certain group of things, actions, etc., or even to one thing or one action, by the context and by the situation in general.

C H A P T E R III
INFINITE VERB
§ 21. -Ci (-tu) can be suffixed to : 1) object-words and proper names, 2) words denoting position, direction or time, 3) quality-words, 4) actionwords ; it adds to the meaning of these words the principle of "being active", "asserting oneself". Presumably the t (which with B. often turns into c before the i) has here again the meaning of motion towards an object (with a touch of will-power in it).
These forms (eventually with an end-point pronoun or a form fulfilling a similar function, behind them) are sometimes used as substantives, and often as adjectives. In the latter case they may be placed either before or after the word governed, and this forms a transition to such uses as remind one of participles and gerunds. They may moreover take the particles fa, goba, etc. as suffixes.

3) The Arawak language has no adjectives. The forms with -ci (-tu, -ci-no), -li f-ro, -no) and -sia are used to translate English attributive adjectives etc. (ikihi-tu kaspara, a flaming sword, biama-no k-augii-ci, two brethren), but they are very loosely connected, as appears also from the fact that these attributive forms must give way to the pronominal prefix (sa-ci d-adaiana-sia I good (my) Master ! sa-ci bu-sa Jesus, thy holy child Jesus, wakaia-ci oie~ci da-sanci bui, thou wicked and slothful (my) servant, to-makwa sa-tu ada k-iwi-ka sa-tu c-iwi, every good tree bringeth forth good (its) fruit, to-moroa na-uaiya m-arulaka ti n-a-n aba-ro na-kabo abu, but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers, l-imigoda goba biama-no lo-mairikoto-sia-no, he sent two of his disciples) ;
c) Plurality. 1) Persons : -ci: adeki-ci n ahaka-ga kiana na-mun, and they that saw it told them, etc., m-akosi-ci adeka, ikori-ci akona-ga, the blind see, the lame walk ; 2) The same, but with a word that is already plural: ka-sa-ci hiaro-no, them (women) that are with child, Jew-no arulukokita a-kwaiaboa-ci hiaro-no adaie-ro-bi-ci bajia, the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, Arena aba-no bajia, ikita-ci i n-amuni-sia abu, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance, yuho-li botobaci hiaro-no goba, many widows were, kenbena Roman-o anda fa-te onnakici wa-sikwa wa-kirikia bajia, and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation, na-makwa aboa-ci, all that were diseased, n-a()alikibitoa k-amunaiga-ci ialoko, blessed are the poor in spirit; 3) Persons : -ci-no : m-akosi-ci-no adeka, ikori-ci-no akona, the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, thousand-no k-ansi-ci-no di, thousands of them that love me, onnaki-ci-no, angel-no, the reapers, are the angels, mihu o-loko-ci-no, they that were in the ship ; 4) Persons: -no-ci, -na-ci; see § 79 b) ; 5) Mostly things : -be-ci; also, though seldom : -be-tu : see § 59 a ) -) :

e) Different relations between a -ci form and the word connected with it:
1 ) imigodo-ci di, him that sent me, onyi-ci kidua-hu, he that doeth truth, yuho-ro k-amun-ci, a rich man ;
2) k-aiima-ci bu-mun, thine enemy, andi-ci aiomuni o-rea, he that cometh from above ;
3) isogo-ci ikiduadi-n hui, o ye of little faith, l-imigoda-te di akurradaaci o-loa d-isadi-n bia, he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, isa sabu koma bu-mun aba-ro-ci akosi bui akodo-n-wa kokke-hu o-lokomun, biama-ci k-akosi-n a-boredo-n-wa hell ikihi akoloko mun aji, it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell, tata-ci-o-kona, a strong man.
§ 22. -Sia adds to the meaning of the word the principle of "the thing that has been realised", like -ci (-tu) adds the principle of "realising a thing". On account of this, such -sia forms are an easy means for the translation of English passive sentences (N.B. also other than oa forms are used for this purpose). -Sia probably means : s, form, i, free, a, timereality (§ 132). Plural forms : -sia-no and -sia-be (§ 59*) D ) .
Compare : sa-ci, f. sa-tu, plur. sa-ci-no, a good person or thing, with : isa-sia ajia-n o-konomun, [one] of good report, isa-sia-no n-ajia-n o-konomun, [men] of honest report.

Furthermore, both from the -sia and the -sia-no forms, an Infinitive can be formed, by means of the suffix -n.
') Different sequence (parallel to § 21 b>). 1) abar-li n-aici-sia siba-loko-ci, a notable prisoner, lit. one they-knowsia stone-in-person, aiita-sia-ma slotro-n h-onnaki-n n-aurea o-doma, for ye have taken away (from them) the key of knowledge, n-isadi-sia boia-tu, the spices which they had prepared, bu-imaha-sia fig-ada, the fig tree which thou cursedst, bawhu a-murreta-ari-no a-borede-sia siba, the stone which the builders rejected, l-akodo-sia bawhu, the house where he entereth in ; 2) Lihi d-Aiici d-ansi-sia, This is my beloved Son, hiaro b-isiki-sia da-ma-tu bia, the woman whom thou gavest to be with me, bawhu nabolliti-sia o-loko, the house where they were sitting, kena kia l-adura, Adaie-li Wacinaci onnaki-sia loko o-rea, and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man, onabo l-onnako-sia o-rea, the ground, from whence he was taken. See moreover for -sia: a-sia, §30, ma-mari-sia, baxi-sia, § 147, and words denoting a human peculiarity, § 118a). § 23. Hia, also ia, S. hiia, adds to the meaning of the word the principle of "existing condition"; h means perhaps "gentle affirmation" (§ 109), ia, free time-reality, etherical (§ 132). Examples : kena l-isimaka sa-be-ci botoba-ci bajia, a-siki-n kokke-hia na-muni n, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive (to them), ama ajia-hu toho h-ajia-ga ho-muni-kwawa, nokonne-hia h-akonaia ? what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad ? kenbena Jesus a-bolli-ci adeka goba loko m-akosihia ka-raia-ci, and as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth, ika tu goba d-imigodo-ni hu m-amuni-hia plata-eke, saka bajia, sapatu bajia ; amateli h-ansi goba ? when I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing ? daii ausa akero-hia ialoko abu, I go bound in the spirit, ki-hia na-sikita goba di akero-ia, yet was I delivered (by them) prisoner, l-iiba goba Paul a-timittva-hia, (he) left Paul bound, adikito-ia lo-kabo lo-kuti l-akatato-sia kimisa abu, [he came forth], bound hand and foot with graveclothes, Herod ... eketoa-ia l-adaiakitwa-kwona-hu eke abu, Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, ika Id aba-no Jew-no Asia warea-ci auciga di maribe-ni-hia temple o-loko, whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, m-ikidoa-ni-hia, I came without gainsaying,

§ 24. Hu also adds to the meaning of the word the principle of "existing condition", but it lacks the free mobility which is expressed by hia ; we feel the -hu forms as substantives. Compare :
ifili-ci capitan oonaba-ga n, Yuho-ro plata abu daii a-iaunta toho ma-ierohu, main. To-moroa daii ka-raia goba ma-iero-hia, l-a Paul ajia-n lo-mun, and the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born ;

Jesus adeka l-oonaba-n ka-koborokwa-hia, and when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, ibe-ci ka-koborokwa-hu abu, filled with wisdom ;
n-ateda, m-eke-hia, ibika-hia bajia, they fled, ... naked and wounded, wadili da-forri-n o-doma ibika-hu abu di, for I have slain a man to my wounding ;
yuho-li murriga-hia ahaka goba lo-konomun barin, for many bare false witness against him (Mk. XIV, 56), aba-no a-kenakwa kiana, ajia-n murciga-hu lo-konomun (etc.), and there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying (etc., Mk. XIV, 57).
Hu, compared with -sia : toho jia l-a goba ajia-n, a-dokoto-ci a-oda-hu lo-odo-sia bia abu, this he said, signifying what death he should die, dakonnaba ajia-hu ajia-sia da-mun, I heard a voice speaking unto me (Acts XXVI, 14).
An object-word without -hu denotes a definite thing (or things) ; with -hu it denotes the thing in general or in a more solemn meaning.
Besides isada-hu, salvation, one also meets isada-hi ; and with other words -hi, -he or -ha is invariably used. Probably this has something to do with the vowels of the word, but as every vowel of the word has a definite meaning, it may well be that -hi, etc. also express different shades ot meaning from -hu.

It is not quite clear, why in the following example akosi takes the suffix -hi, and akuyuko takes no suffix ; presumably this is to be attributed to the inner meaning of the words: to-moroa t-a()alikibitoa hui akosi-hi, t-adeki-n o-doma ; hui akuyuko bajia, t-akonnabo-n o-doma, but blessed are your eyes, for they see : and your ears, for they hear.
S. and Q. use such -hu forms as passive verbs (Q. see § 91).

§ 27. -N adds to the meaning of the word the principle of "duration, vagueness in respect to time".
See examples in § 5, and the following : l-idehada-ga kiana ajinamu-n, akona~n, temple o-lokomun a-kodo-n-wa na-ma ; akona-n, a-dehada-n, a-praisedi-n Wacinaci bajia, and he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God ; kena na-iinata goba a-kurradi-n marisi, and (they) began to pluck the ears of corn, kena t-akenakwa goba ikita-n ie, and she arose, and ministered unto them. In these sentences all the -n forms have no pronominal prefix ; the same may be the case with the -ni forms (§ 25 d>). On the other hand a pronominal prefix is applied in : d-ansi-ka b-isiki-n da-mun tanahu kibi John Baptist isi ifiro-tu karubo o-loko, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist, —• because here the person connected with the secondary action-word is not the same as the person connected with the primary action-word. In general a -ni form expresses the sharp, the pithy, an -n form more the indefinite, the vague. See also §§ 32, 33. There is some relationship between the -ci (-tu), the -ni, the -n and the -in forms ; if it is not absolutely indicated which of these forms has to be used, sometimes one and sometimes the other is met with, e.g. Jesus aici-ci na-loa o-konomun ajia goba na-mun, and Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, to-moroa ika tu Jesus aici-ni n, yu warea ki l-ausa goba, but when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence, ika tu Jesus aici-n l-oaiya lo-lok-oa lo-mairikoto-sia-no a-ononoda-n to-konomun, when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, [he said] ; yumuni ki l-auciga abar-li, Eneas ci iri, kabuin-timen wiwa-ci goba lo-torodo-kwonahu ajeago, aboa-ci goba bele-n, and there he found a certain man named >Eneas, which had kept his bed (on) eight years, and was sick of the palsy, biam-loko wiwa-n bena i, and when he was full forty years old [it came in his heart to visit his brethren], ika tu goba abar-mairia-kutihi wiwa-in Tiberius Cesar adaia-he-n, now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Adaie-li isa-tu wiwa-in o-konomun d-ahaka-n bia, [he has sent me] to preach the acceptable^year of the Lord. In the vowel preceding the -n, the i, o or a principle finds expression ; if that vowel is an i, then it is often uncertain, whether an -in or an -n form is meant. Oa, preceding -n, expresses a combination of the oa and the a principles. The oa principle alone, is expressed by substituting o-n-wa for i-n (i group) or for o-n (o group), e.g. to-moroa kasakabo anda fa-te, ika tu fa aiika-ci onnako-n-wa n-aurea, but the days will come, when the

a-torodo-n-wa, and the eyes of them both were opened (comp. Sabbath
kasakabo bavin ika ki Jesus a-murreta goba ovoroli a-torodo-n l-akosi, and it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes). These forms may be considered as -n forms : a-torodo-n and onnako-n (•— the latter parallel to onnaki-n, and only used when -wa is suffixed —) with a suffix -wa having the meaning of "in itself", etc. (see § 120&)).
The frequently used -n-ci (-n-tn) forms all indicate something including the principle of duration, vagueness in respect to time, together with the -ci (-tu) principle ; they are also used if there is an element of futurity in the action, the same as with the ia forms of § 5. Examples :
Adaie-li, d-ausia banyia to-bora, da-ci d-akarate-n-ci, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father (comp. akarati-ci b-ire-ci, them which have buried thy husband), n-aiitc bavin ma-maicikolo-n-wa-ci naii m-aici-n-ci bajia, (they) perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, wakaia m-onyi-n-ci-n ka i, if he were not a malefactor.
It is a matter of course that -n-ci (~n-tv) forms especially occur with such like negations.
Connected with these forms are the -na-ci (-na-tu) forms (§ 79b) ; with both there is a disposition to substitute an e for the vowel a or i preceding the -n.
The -ni, -ci, -tu, -sia, -hu etc. forms can also take the suffix -n. G. wa-suko-sa-kona-ci, the priest (our baptizer, lit. we-wash-resultinstrumental, § 120a> 2> -agent).

CHAPTER IV
AUXILIARY VERB a
§ 28. A expresses : the aspect of the world in its continual change (§2). It is the "Zeitwort" of the Arawak language, and is used with pronominal prefixes as a verb "to do", "to be" (not as a copula "to be", this does not exist in Arawak). In a separate word the doing or the being may be paraphrased.
a) Indicative mood, Present tense : d-a, b-a, l~a, t-a, w-a, h-a, n-a ; Past ,, the same, followed by goba ; Future ,, da fa, bo fa, lo fa, tu fa, wa fa, ho fa, na fa ;
Potential ,, Present ,, the same as Ind. m., Pr. t., followed by ma.
Examples : bu-fitikida-te l-aurea, d-a bu-mun, I charge thee, come out of him, isa b-a te andi-n, thou hast well done that thou art come, toho jia l-a Adaie-li da-mun, thus hath the Lord dealt with me, ki-jia n-a kiana, which also they did, murriga-ci jia bo fa koto, [when thou prayest] thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are, alika wa fa naraha ? what shall we do to these men ? alika lo fa-te naha kabuea-ari-no o-mun ? what will he do unto those husbandmen ? to-moroa tanahu akona kwa da fa, nevertheless I must walk to day, kalime-hi fa ! let there be light ! d-a ma koro, Adaie-li ! not so, Lord ! (Acts X, 14, XI. 8), alika l-a ma kiana Satan a-boredwa l-oaiya ? how can Satan cast out Satan ? b) This auxiliary verb a is often used, when, in describing an action, it is meant to place in relief that an action is taking place, more than the character of the action. Examples : Usual form : Acts IX, 40, and she opened her eyes, to-tovoda kiana t-akosi-wa, lit. she-open -a then her-eyes-own. Form in which the doing is placed in relief : J.. IX, 26, how opened he thine eyes ? alika l-a a-torodo-n b-akosi ? lit. how he-a opening thine-eyes ? (comp. English how did he open thine eyes ?). Further examples : to-moroa d-ansi-sia-no d-a a-sa-ni hu, but I have called you friends, kena toho jia bo fa a-murreti-ni n, and this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of, toho jia tu fa h-ikalime a-kalimeto-n-wa loko-no o-makana, n-adeki-n bia sa-tu h-imikebo-sia, let your light so shine before men. that they may see your good works, ki jia t-a aiomun iibido~n-wa, ororo bajia,

thus the heavens and the earth were finished, alika t-a b-akosi a-totodo-nwa ? how were thine eyes opened ? ama-hu h-a k-ikisi-n Christ o-konomun ? what think ye of Christ ? kenbena manswa-ki n-a goba nokonni-n, and they were exceeding sorrowful;
c) The auxiliary verb a is also used in association with an Infinitive with the prefix m(a)-, e.g. Mt. XXIV, 2, m-adeki-n h-a toraha tomakwa ? see ye not all these things ? lit. m- (hesitating, reluctant, becomes in this place a negation) seeing ye-do this its-all.
Further examples :
wa-siki [a ? ma-siki-n wa fa botta ? shall we give, or shall we not give ? m-onyi-n b-a ka-cikibe, thou shalt not steal (commit theft), bawhu-yuho muni-ro m-ausi-n b-a-li, bawhu-yuho kono-no o-mun, m-ahaka-n b-a-li, neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town, da-tu, m-amoto-n-wa b-a, daughter, be of good comfort, to-moroa yara anakabo-tu ada iwi o-konomun, M-iki-ni h-a-li kia, m~ibibidi-n h-a-li bajia kia, ma-odo-ni h-a-n bia, l-a Wacinaci ajia-n, but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die, m-ibibidi-n b-a-te di, touch me not, b-ikisi-ka makwaiabo-n-wa d-a ma Da-ci, thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, ma-bokoto-n h-a goba di, and ye laid no hold on me.
d) If it is not intended to negative the single fact, but to negative privatively, then the prefix m(a)- is incorporated into the root of the word and prefixes may be applied in the usual way.
Examples : a-maribendi-, to cleanse (from iribe, uncleanness), a-maiero, to be free, a-maierodo-, to make free (from aiero, to be in bondage, to be a slave), imikiduadi- to disbelieve (ikiduadi-, to believe), n-imekida goba i, they stripped him (eki, clothes), a-masiidikiti-, to (cause to) behead, (isi, head), Sm. a-mabannadi-, to strip off the leaves (u-banna, leaf), a-maimadi-, to propitiate (aima, wrath), G. da-mateda-te hime, I clean a fish (-te, intestines). e) A with impersonal prefix k~, appearing in a positive manner. !) See table, § 5, forms 4 : a group, a group with oa, quality-words I ; -) ama ibia waii (emphasizing pronoun) ma-koto-n ka yuho-ho-in, Pharisee-no bajia ; to-moroa bui a-mairikoto-sia-no ma-koto-n ka koro ? why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not ? f) A with impersonal prefix m-, hesitancy. !) See table, § 5, forms 5 ; 2) m-ikita-n-ci hu m-ikita-ni ma Daii bajia, he that despiseth you despiseth me (also), ama-koro Wacinaci m-onyi-ni-ma ma, for with God no thing shall be impossible, ... ahaka-n na-mun, hui m-ajia-n ma-li abaren. ... and commandeth them not to speak at all, Adaie-li Ialoko onnaka goba Philip l-aurea, eunuch m-adeki-n ma goba kiana ba i, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more ;

§41. In the following forms an i is added to a, presumably as an intensifying suffix. Sm. says of this : "Wenn es sich auf eine vorhergehende Rede bezieht, so ist in dieser Form gewohnlich dass man es nicht durch n sondern i ausdriickt, z.B. dapai ich will, werde es thun oder sagen ; bupai du sollst es, etc. ; lupai er wird, oder soil es, etc."

§ 42. When in the narration a person is quoted as speaking, then the quotation is always followed by the verb a, to do, with a pronominal prefix indicating the person whose words are quoted, and often ajia-n, speaking, or such like. The same process is followed when two or more quotations are enclosed in each other.

G. I ask A.: "did you go there this morning ?" he answers : "yes" ; then I ask B. : "is it really so" ? B. answers : Z-a-sz (§ 179 c)) or l-a-diaru, surely, or lu-mura-diaro (§ 140 c>), perhaps (if A. were a woman: tumura-diaro or t-a-diaro-ka, perhaps).
§ 43. Often English indirect speech is converted into Arawak direct speech (especially in S.'s texts).
Mt. II, 7, Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared, ika ki Herod asimaka goba ka-ieniko-be~ci aiakatwa o~loko, alika wiwa ka-raia goba ? l-a goba adagato-n manswan ie, lit. occurred !

§ 45. The emphasizing pronouns are composed in a similar way to the expressions indicating position, direction or time of the type to-loko, in it, "it-interior place", na-mun, to them, "they-humble place". Parallel to na-mun, Arawak has yu-mun(i), a place ; here y, here, u space, takes the place of the pronominal prefix.
In a similar way, parallel to the pronouns treated of in § 44 : *>) i) yaha, here, to be here (A. M. § 182, 132 C) ; examples, see § 12.
2) taha, far, to be afar off (A. M. § 182, 132 D) ; taha-wai, afar off, with the intensifying particle -wax, occurring under d ) . Presumably taha means not exactly "far", but rather another place than the place indicated by yaha, comp. S. taha-maria — jaha-mavia, § 9 7 f ) . Sm. tahakun, there, taha-maria, on the other side ; taha-ssabu-tu, a little beyond the other side, taha-waria, from there, daha-ru, thereto, kii-ddaha-ru\ka\i.

2) S. hidda, now, then ; Sm. it is also often used without especial meaning.
S. ni-kebe-n t-a attikida Petrus u-kutti-miin, tu-huda hidda, then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost, lit. immediately she-did fall Petrus feet-at, she-die hidda, bakkiillama hidda-n u-durha, for it was now eventide, ikka hidda\ba, (and also) [he has written], lit. occurred hidda again, ikka l-adia-ka hidda\ba, (and he said also).
§46. Parallel to the forms treated of in §§44, 4 5 b ) , aha with pronominal prefix ; we may also consider this as a durative (§ 3) of the auxiliary verb a. The only examples of these forms, that have been found in the texts are : ibikido-lia b-aha-ni ka, bu-idwa b-uaiya, when thou wast young, thou girdest thyself (comp. yaha-ni ka bu, if thou hadst been here, and § 32), fig ada abomun b-aha-n ka, Daii adeka bu, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee, bo-kobovokwa, kokke kwa b-aha-n ka goba. isa-betu amateli b-auciga bu-mun wa, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things.
§ 47. S. dannuhu, B. tanahu, now, to day, this day, tanahu warea, from henceforth. Presumably da, ta emphasizes, as in §§44. 4 5 ; ana, comp. ana-ka (-ku), the midst, § 79 <i).

CHAPTER VI
K; B
§ 57. The k in Arawak implies activity ; in contrast with this, the b is used to indicate "being at rest". The way in which k is used often reminds one of "creation at work", "the idea or the principle that becomes phenomenon", b of "the manner in which that which has been created manifests itself, the appearance".
G denotes the same as k, but is perhaps a degree milder (§ 5, forms 4 ; § 8810).
It seems possible that the use of %, kh (noted by G.), gk (used by some of the Moravians), k or g, is determined by the strength with which one wishes to express the ^-principle. Moreover some influence probably comes from the other sounds of the word, and finally there may be personal differences in the speakers themselves and in those who wrote that down.
§ 58. Bi; b appearance, i quick, light. a) immediate past.

s) ibi, used in the same way as the auxiliary verb a. m-adeki-n d-ibi yara o-loko lo-ma bu ? did not I see thee in the garden with him ? (J. XVIII, 26), Daii ki, d-ibi ahaka-n ho-mun, I have told you that I am he (J. XVIII, 8) ; b) ibi-n, not long ago, already. Annas imigoda goba ibin i akeraia Caiaphas priest-no afudyi o-mun, now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest (J. XVIII, 24), Pilate m-aiici-n ma alika l-a-n a-odo-n ibin, and Pilate marvelled if he were already dead (Mk.

§ 90. The t, in the meaning of "moving towards an object" (with a touch

of will-power in it), we have already met with when we considered the

construction of the action-words ( § 1). It occurs in a similar meaning in

the particle te ( § 95), and in a great many words, for which we refer the

reader to the Alphabetical Index, especially under T.

In some words and particles ti alternates with ci (phonetically tsyi). It is

possible that ti is especially used if it is necessary to make the t principle

appear plainly, or if the t principle is strongly felt, and tsyi etc. where that

is not the case. Probably also euphony plays an important part in this

phenomenon, e.g. t-isi (ph. t-isyi), its seed, t-isa (ph. t-isa). her child.

c-ikisi ( p h . tsy-ikisyi), ( i t s ) m o m e n t , c-iwi ( p h . tsy-iwi), ( i t s ) fruit.

nouns ending in -ci ( f. -tu). T in the meaning of d, see §§ 44 f ) , 45 f ) , 47, 1 79 ' ). and with a similar

meaning in the following : a ) 1) tata-ni ho-loa o-dotna, for the hardness of your heart, Daii tata-ci,

b) tata o-kona, power, force, strength (o-A:ona. § 63 a) 2A> ; a similar construction in a-iige-sia o-loko, § 22 e ) , etc.).

CHAPTER XII
FORMATION OF VERBS, ETC.
§ 9 1 . W e may now more closely examine the inner structure of the action-words, of which something has already been said in § § 1 and 20.
Eke, to eat (§ 171 a ) ) , j s used wihout any inflexion, as a transitive verb : d-eke kiana n, and I did eat ( i t ) , h-onnaka n, h-eke n, take (it), eat (it) !. In other forms eki and iki prevail, and it is possible that the last e of eAre is a slight indication that here an a ought to be used.
D-eke, I eat, belongs to the type : pronominal prefix — root. T h e type pronominal prefix — ending or particle (without root), is met with i n : /-a, he did, lo [a, he shall do ( § 2 8 ) , d-ibi, I did (a moment before) (§ 5 8 a ) 3))? d-ebe, I have accomplished doing (§ 5 9 a ) 3)).
In a-ii-, to weep ( A . M . § 182, 150), the root consists only of a long i (felt as a sound-imitation ? see, however, A. M . § 182, 151. rain) : Jesus a-iiya goba, Jesus wept.
In a-ti-, to drink (A. M. § 182, 3), the root consists of a t with only traces of a preceding e ; t(i) indicates the motion of the fluid : h-eta. drink, na-ta goba, they drank, da-ti fa. I (will) drink, da-tena a-ta-hi. my blood is drink, a-ta-kwona-hu, a cup.
In a-iibi-, to leave (§ 58C> 2>), the root is ib(i), quick, slight appearance (§58) : na-iiba to-makwa, they forsook all.
S. akunnu-, to depart, to go, to walk (Imperative b-akun-te, h-akun-te, b-aku-te ; -ci verbal noun akun-ti), B. akona, to walk, and Sm. abbunu-. B. abone-, to plant, to sow (A. M. § 182, 145), indicate something like "to be on the earth", the first in an active sense, and the second in a quiet or peaceable way ; comp. kona and bonna, §§ 63, 64.
The great majority of the verbs have d, t or k as endings, respectively indicating the principle of "standing", "movement towards an object" "appearing in an active, positive manner", with different vowels. Combinations also frequently occur.
Examples : praise, praise, a-praisedi-, to praise, ikisi, opinion, ikisidi-. to judge, isa, formed, good, sound, isadi-, to heal, nokonne, sorrow, a-nokonnedi-, to cause sorrow or sadness ;
eA:e, clothes, wrappage, eketi-, to clothe, kari. to suffer, a-kariti-. to torment, iri, name, iriti-, to call one's name, kokke. life, a-kokketo-. to quicken (J. V., 21) ;
a-ti-, to drink, ma-teki-tu bajia iju, and the paps which never gave suck ; onna (in compounds, § 7 9 e > ) . in a fixed place, onnaki-. to take (to
B9-

132

MISCELLANEOUS COMPOUND FORMS

§92

appear in a fixed place), onnakidi-, to lift up, onnakiti-. to compel to bear,

G. lu-manikidoa, he is proud, lit. he-not-lift up-self ;

ime, willingly, imeko, readiness, to be ready, imigodo-, S. imekudu-, to

send ; ie, presumably at one time ieni. § 83 a>, tongue, a-ientwa, to sing, ieniko,

cleverness, wisdom, ka-ieniko, to be clever, subtle, wise, G. to be an

eloquent man, a crafty speaker, a poet (the Arawaks make poems), ienikoto-, to make wise (comp., however, § 80 b>), G. ieni-hi, song, a-yentoa, to sing ;

a~forra, to slay, a-forrakiti-, to put to death ;

akeri-, to bind, akeraki, bond, bands, akerakiti-, to cause binding ;

a-siki-.. to put, to give, a-sikiti- to deliver ;

aid-,' to knt>w, aiciki, a token, a mark, aicikiti-, to warn, to betray ;

itimi, rope, bonds, a-timiti-, to bind, abat~dakabo a-timitiki baka, five

yoke of oxen, Sm. a-ttimetikitti-, fest machen lassen ;

o-buri, letters, a-buriti-, to write, a~buritikiti-, to cause to write ;

aboa, to be ill, foul, aboadi-, to destroy, to waste, aboada-be-tu wolf,

grievous wolves, aboado-(n-wa), to be destroyed, aboadikiti-, to condemn,

aboadikito-(n-wa), to be condemned, toho ki aboadikitoa-hu, and this is

the condemnation.

With regard to these forms, Sm. remarks : "Alle ihre Verba konnen in

eine Form gegossen werden, die der Conjugation Hiphil ratione significatus

correspondirt ; und davon wird das Passivum gemacht auf die Weise:

amalitin, machen, amalitikittin, machen lassen, amalitikittunnua, gemacht werden." It will be evident now (— see also §§ 4 c ) , 6 b > — ) , that this

formula does not exactly get to the heart of the matter.

Q. states with more insight : "Activ. a-ssukussu-(n), waschen, Passiv.

simplex, a-ssukussa-hu-(n)

( § 2 4 ) , Reciproc. a-ssukussu-(nn-ua),

sich

selbst waschen, Activ a-ssukussukuttu-(n), waschen machen, oder lassen,

Pass, a-ssukussukuttu-(nn-ua), machen, dass man gewaschen wird, wird

aber auch oft als ein blosses Passivum gebraucht."

In each of the elements added, the vowel has a meaning of its own. All

sorts of combinations occur, but it is a matter of course, that combinations

of elements containing the same vowel-principle occur most frequently.

Striking examples of this are : a-tikidi-, to fall, to cast, t-itikidi-kiti-n i, it

hath cast him, a-tokodo-, to come down, to descend, lo-dokodokoto-ni n.

and when he had opened it [the book].

It is possible that the wish to obtain harmony between the sounds is of

some influence in those cases where the meaning would not thereby be

placed in jeopardy.

In the application of the different forms, the Arawak is very precise, e.g.

Mt. XXII, 4, Behold, I have prepared my dinner, has been translated by :

H-adeka, da-koto-n d-iibidi()kita, lit. Behold, my-dinner I -prepare-caused.

§ 92. Miscellaneous compound forms : a) With an -n, indicating continuation or plurality (comp. the -n~ci

forms, § 27) between the root and the d or t: a-tna-ribe-n-di-. to cleanse

CHAPTER XIII
L; R
§ 94. L in Arawak generally indicates the principle of "loose", "willing (and able) to move", whilst r on the contrary indicates the principle of "fixed", "unable to move", "motion being impeded".
G. Arawak has an I, an r, and two intermediate consonants ; for the consonant most closely resembling /, the sign A is used ; for the consonant most closely resembling r, the sign g is used. It is possible that on further examination no real difference will be found between A and o.
L and r are used in places where the difference is of importance, for instance -loko, in (free), -roko, in (bound), kalime. shining, karime, black. It is, however, not clear, why they say pero, dog, and kanina. fowl. baga, sea.
In a few cases a word in a vocabulary contains an / where an r might be expected, and vice versa ; presumably these are simple mistakes resulting from indistinct pronunciation.
§ 95. Te added to a verbal form, denotes limited motion : t motion towards an object, e slowing down.
Li added to a verbal form, denotes "freely flowing forth ; / loose, i principle or quick 1).
Examples, with ausa, to go, or really "to form a void" (§ 130 b>). a ) ma-heragi-n bena na-muni kwawa ie, n-ausa kiana, and when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, h-ausa ho-kona mairia-tu isikwa-hu mun i-ro, go into the village over against you. h-ausa. h-ahaka-li John o-mun ba h-akonnabo-sia o-konomun h-adeki-sia o-konomun, go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see ; b) yu warea ki, w-augioci akonnabo-n bena wa-konomun, n-ausa-te asakada-n wa-ma Appii Forum mun, and from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, b-osa-te da-iinabo. follow me (Mt.

') B. says in his grammar: "The termination te mostly denotes motion towards the speaker, the latter (li) from the speaker". Motion towards the speaker is of course a fe motion; motion away Irom the speaker is very often a li motion, but it may be a te motion as well.

In the nature of the case, li only occurs with the Imperative and in the Present Tense of the Indicative ; te on the other hand, occurs with all kinds of forms: -ba-te (§ 60b>), fa-te, [aroka-te (§ 144), goba-te, ga-te, l-a-n ka-te, koma-te, ia-te, bena-te, bia-te, bo-te, -n-te (this form occurs also in sentences with o-doma), a-te, a-ia-te.

he looked round about. § 107. Ra is also used in order to indicate, that something which has
the nature of a liquid, is here considered as "a definite place". a ) -tako, -irako, in (a fluid). kena abaren l-amodi-n oini-xako warea, and straightway (he) coming up

§ 109. The h is used in Arawak in order to indicate "gentle affirmation"; in some cases it means "to exhale" ; in ahe, yes, both these meanings are included. In a few words the h has been found to alternate with g and k (§§ 88 h), 104b) 2)).

food), and a-kdldk(6?)-, to reach (for instance an object), are used when
we use "to give". According to A. P. Penard (verbal communication to the
author), something similar occurs in Kalina, and is rooted in the Indian
belief that only what is required for one's personal necessities may be
regarded as property. W h a t his field, or the chase produces in excess of

1) This explanation looks more plausible than the derivation from Wapisiana tiipic. a certain hard kind of wood, and an, hard, rough, coarse (Nordenskiold 50 b, 86). The Arawak nation has had much intercourse with the Spaniards, and the new metal might have been introduced to the other tribes of Guiana by the intermediary of the Arawaks. This would explain how it is, that the same word is in general use among the Indian tribes of Guiana.
2) Also this word is used by many tribes in Guiana : Island Karib echoubara. coutelas, has perhaps been brought over by way of Kalina (Galibi) : epee, cachipata, ousipara, soubara.

CHAPTER XVII
CLASSES OF UTTERANCES; NUMERALS
§ 136. Command, prohibition, incitement, request, answer to a question, and exclamation, are composed in the same way as a statement. Probably there is some difference in intonation, and moreover, when one expresses a command, a prohibition or an incitement, use is frequently made of the particles -li and -te, which indicate the character of the movement, and at the same time show that the speaker means motion.
Every spoken utterance only completes what the hearer already knows. or what he can conclude by the gestures and actions of the speaker and others. Therefore we can easily comprehend that especially these sorts of utterances are often very short.
See examples in § 12, and also the following : a) b-adeka di, Adaie-li, behold, I am here. Lord, lit. thou -see me, Lord, h-onnaka n, h-eke n, toho d-ifiro-hu, take, eat : this is my body, b-osa ! go thy way ! h-akenakwa-te, yaha-rea w-ausa-i-li, arise, let us go hence, da fa-i, ma-ribe-n bu, I will ; be thou clean, m-amaro-ni bu, not afraid, m-amaro-ni hu, fear not ye, be not affrighted, m-amaro-ni kiana hu na-bora, fear them not therefore, m-amaro-n bu, Paul, fear not, Paul, m-amaro-n bu, Sion o-tu, fear not, daughter of Sion ; b) David Aiici, The son of David (Mt. XXII, 42), m-ansi d-a, I will not, d-ausa, Adaie-li, I go, sir (Mt. XXI, 29, 30), John Baptist isi, the head of John the Baptist (Mk. VI, 24) ; c) Adaie-li, David Aiici bui, O Lord, thou son of David ! yauhahu bui ! thou unclean spirit ! murriga-ci hui I ye hypocrites ! murriga-ci bui I thou hypocrite ! isa n, sa-ci, kidua-ci da-sanci bui, well done, thou good and faithful servant, Claudius Lysias, isa-ci-wabu adaia-hu Felix o-mun, imigoda toho ajia-hu ; Alikibi bu, ma-in, Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting (sends this word ; Joy thee, ma-in, § 35), alikibi bu I hail ! (L. I, 28) ; d) ahe, yes (§ 109) ; aba-koto, no (aba, one, a, koro, negation) ; Ahe. Adaie-li, n-a goba ajia-n lo-mun, they said unto him.

sounds indicative of surprise, alarm, 6 c , many of which it would be difficult to express by letters. Some have a definite meaning, as kimii and asikii, the former expressing surprise with a degree of sorrow or alarm ; the latter denoting excessive disgust. But the majority are such as require the expression of the voice, and vary their meaning according to its intonation." (kimii, see under 3 ) , asikii, G. siki I comp. isi, to stink, § 115) ;
2) Sm. poi I word of astonishment, poi ! d-a (b-a, l-a), I (thou, he) wonder, poi ! d-ibi, I have wondered to-day, poi ! da-pa, I will wonder, etc. ; S. h-addika-te amutta-rubu-mu-tti\de, pahia — h-a-li, behold, ye despisers, and wonder, pahia 1 -— ma na-kunnamiih, they marvelled (themconcerning ; Acts IV, 13), etc., G. fa I is said, when someone uses a bad word (see § 184) ;

4) ah I, ah (Mk. XV, 29) ; 5) Sm. akka, ach ! akka\ka tuhu I akka\ka-e !, G. ako, word of surprise (A. M. § 182, 132B) ; 6) Q. : "In their meetings, their greetings and that which they have to say, is expressed in a singing tone, and is answered by the person to whom it is addressed, in the same singing, or rather plaintive tone, with a repetition of the last words with addition of wa, ehekada and gideada, as substantiation." See moreover the words mentioned in § 179. § 137. Explanation : Abona-ci sa-tu t-isi, loko Aiici; Kabuea, ororo ; sa-tu t-isi, isauka sanoci; to-moroa tare, wakaia-ci sanoci; K-aiima-ci abona-ci n, yauhahu ; to-kore ka, ororo a-iiboa ; onnaki-ci-no, angel-no, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man ; The field is the world : the good seed are the children of the kingdom ; but the tares are the children of the wicked one ; The enemy that sowed them is the devil ; the harvest is the end of the world ; and the reapers are the angels. Other juxtaposition : Daii, Da-ci, abar-li tvaii, I and my Father are one. § 138. Questions do not differ in the sequence of words from other sentences. Probably ambiguity is prevented by different intonation. Daii ! it is I, Daii ? is it I ? Christ but. thou art the Christ, Christ bui ? art thou the Christ ? d-ikiduada bui Christ. Wacinaci Aiici, I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, b-ikiduada Wacinaci Aiici ? dost thou

makwa ? hath not my hand made all these things ?

§ 139. In the preceding sentences, the uncertainty is so well indicated, that the listener has only to answer "yes" or "no". When this is impossible

or impractical, the uncertainty is indicated by a word denoting its class (interrogative word). The same words are used in non-interrogative

sentences (in imitation of the English construction ?). a ) Ama denotes a person who "is", a thing that "is" ; m uncertain,
unpretending, a time-reality. !) r) ama bu-iri ? ... Legion da-mi, what is thy name ? ... my name

§ 142. Koro, negation ; ko affirms, knits up the event, the person or thing in question, ro stops.
M(a)- negatives a form which denotes a state or condition (§§ 10. 18, 28 d>) and may be compared to English "un-", or "without". Koro negatives a clause. The place of koro is chosen in accordance with the necessity of emphasizing the negation.

I, 21), daii koro aiita lihi loko, I know not the man, ma-sweardoa-n h-a-li abaren : Aiomun koro abu bu-sweardoa [a, etc., swear not at all ; neither by heaven, etc., Sabbath a-murretwa goba loko o-mun, loko koro a-murretwa sabbath o-mun, the sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath, h-adaiana-sia koro a-iaunta tribute plata ? doth not your master pay tribute ?

Faroka, indicating the hypothetical, is used in the same way as fa (§ 5) ; fa points to the future, ro stops the flow of thought, ka. if, when (§29*)).

5, abar-dakabo, one-my-hand ; 10, biam-dakabo, two-my-hand ; 6 abartimen, 7 biama-timen, 8 kabuin-timen, 9 bibici-timen : t-imen = itssubmissive or such-like, § 73, consequently 7 = one (at) the submissive (hand), one at the other hand (?) ;
11, abar-kutibanna, 12 biam-kutibanna, 14 bibici-kutibanna ; o-kuti, foot, banna, at the surface of ;
15, abar-mairia-kuti-hi, one-other side- foot-in general ; 20, abar-loko, one man, i.e. all the fingers and toes together ; 40, fciamloko ; 60, kabuin-loko ; 80, bibici-loko ; 100, abar hundred (English) ; 2000, biam thousand ; etc. When rational beings are meant, -no (after an n : -o) is suffixed. The plural suffix is omitted, perhaps because it is mentioned already in wadili-no, in : naii a-koto-ci abardakabo thousand wadili-no jiaro goba, hiaro-no bajia, ire-no bajia, and they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children. The ordinal numbers from 5 onwards, are formed by substituting dakabo-li for dakabo, time-li for timen (li, § 175). Sometimes, however, the form which is used for the cardinal number, is also used for the ordinal, e.g. : kenbena lo-fitikida goba kabuin hour jiaro, and he went out about the third hour, abar-timen kaci o-loko Wacinaci imigoda goba angel Gabriel, and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God. Numbers indicating more than 20, not being a full 20, 100 or 1000 : Mahalaleel kokke kwa ma goba kabuin-loko wiwa (year) ajeago (upon) abar-dakabo, and Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, abar-hundred wiwa ajeago kabuin loko kia (that) ajeago (upon) biama, 162 years, kia mihu o-loko goba waii wa-makwa biam-hundred ajeago kabuin-loko kia ajeago abar-timen kutibana kokki-ci, and we were all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls. Sm. 11, abba-kutti-hi-benna, abba-kutti-hi-benna-nu. The complete form is : biama-n-te-kabbe abba-kutti-hi-benna tu-pakiitti-n or t-adi-wa-ku: the fingers of both hands and one toe of the feet besides (which they all point out). Sm. a-pakiittii-, to pass ; t-adi-wa-ku : its-more than-in itselfpower.
S. kabbuin lugku biama-dakkabbu tu-pakiitta-n (B. kabuin-loko-no ajeago biam-dakabo-no), 70 ; S. kabbuin lukku abba-maria-kutti-hi-bennatti tu-pakiitta-n (B. kabuin-loko ajeago abar-mairia-kuti-hi), 75 ;
v. C. abba loekoe-noe-bena to-ppakita-n to-joho, 100, lit. one man-pluralafter its-surpassing its-quantity.

tu-ppa hu-miinni-n, m-aditti-pa\n, and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive; presumably : your-eyes-own with ye-see-shall verily, but power quality it-shall you-to not-know-shall it ;
11) G. faru-thu-ma-loko-ho, a poison or charm for working evil on someone ; kuna-palu, fish-poison, Euphorbia cotinoides ;
2) Sm. pale-tti, masc, pale-ttu, fern., pale-tti-ju, plur., is the collective name for those Indian tribes1) which are ever on a war-footing with the Kalepi-na or Kalevi-te-nu ; kalipi~na ma-pale, the Caribs are not palettiju : G. faleto, any stranger (white man, negro, Kalina), plur. faletyu(h-na or faletu-be. Pen. faretho, a wise man or a stranger ;
3) Pen. faretho, fareto, faleto is used in combinations •with other words to designate certain mythical Indian tribes as Itori-faretho (Howling Monkey Indians), Papaya-faretho (Papaw Indians), and many others ; B. has used Pareciyu, S. Palettiju, for translating "the barbarous people" (Acts XXVIII, 2).
§ 165. Formerly the Arawak nation was subdivided in families or clans. At present this seems to be falling into disuse. [G. In Surinam it is still in operation. A child is considered to belong to its mother's clan, and a man who marries becomes subject to his father-in-law ; comp. § 164k) kindred, o-fo '--' mother, § 163 e) -) mother's brother, adaen-ci -^ lord, ruler, and also that curious custom, by which an Arawak man is not allowed to look at his mother-in-law or to speak to her, and vice versa : wadlli lu-mukoto u-ma koro lii-dia-kuma, l-ikisida-ya-fa to lu-mukoto-uwa-da, a man may not speak to his mother-in-law, he must be respectful to her (see also § 216 and a similar statement by Q. 18, 251 and v. C. 7').
The kaluafii-na clan (plur. ; a man is called kaluafu-di, a woman kaluafu-du) belongs to a group of eight. It is forbidden to marry any person of the same group, if dwelling in the same country, and any one of the same clan, no matter where he or she lives. It is also prohibited to marry a child of the full brother of one's father. Thy clan = bu-kurukuya, bu~kiirkiya ( § 164 J>), or b-ibithadu (comp. § 164 n>). In order that marriages may be possible, families belonging to different clans are living in the same village.]
A similar clan-system has been reported also from the Palikur, Goajiro and Achagua ; presumably it was already in existence among the old Arawak-Maipure. It is possible, however, that the names of the different clans are not so old as the system is.
The following types of Arawak clan-names occur :

*) T h e Mahanaa ( M a n a o ) , Uttumaku ( O t o m a k e ) , Akuliju ( T r i o ) . Assawanu Saliwanu ( S a l i v a ) , Addacaia ( A t o r a i ) . Saimakuttu ( C h a y n a ) , Kumaiya ( ? ) , (Nepoio), Waijana (Guayana).

PROPER NAMES ; GODS, MYTHICAL PERSONS, ETC. §§ 165A—166

a ) name of a place -|- y° (family, mother, § 164 k)) : Maratakayo (Marataka, a river in Surinam), etc. ;
b ) name of a plant -f- fo (ruler, or offshoot, § 6 9 d > ) : Haiawafo
(hayawa, incense tree), etc. ; c ) name of a plant or of an animal + ka (when, § 29, or little, § 34 ??) •
Mibika (mibi, vine-rope), Barakataka (barakata, small armadillo), etc.; d ) miscellaneous: Ebesowa, Koroboha, Demare, see §§ 224, 1 6 7 b ) .
For lists of the Arawak clan-names, see Hi., I. Th., v. C , R., and § 196. § 165A. Proper names, see § 176 a ) 2 ) . § 166. a ) It seems that the old Arawaks acknowledged a First Cause ;
however, (B. 5e, 6) they never called upon this deity : "to Him for succour
none can fly. He is so high above". The titles for this Supreme Being : Aiomun Kon-di, Dweller in the Height, Ifili-ci Wa-ci-na-ci, Great Our Father, Wa-murreti-kwon-ci, Our Maker, may perhaps be due to the influence of Christian missionaries ;
b) !) Orehu, Pen. huliu, R. oriyu, G. oriyu, uriyu, probably indicates the cosmical mother-principle. "Bright Orehu ... her beauty rare", the unborn virgin (having no navel), ever renewing herself, like a serpent which casts its skin, appears to the medicine-man in his greatest illumination ; see B. 5e, 18, Pen. 17a, III, 102, 162, and especially 69g VII, VIII.
The same word is generally used to indicate spirits of a less exalted state, water-spirits, described to the author as "a dragon, a huge serpent with feet and wings".
The Kalina term Okoyumu is probably composed of okoyo, serpent, yumu, spirit, and so we may translate Oriyu by ori, serpent, yu, mother (-spirit) ; but on may also hint at "darkness" (§ 126 b>) or "rotation" (§ 108A), she being the "mother of time".
Speaking of the common water-spirits, R. (19a, Sect. 186) says : "Like the Spirits of the Forest, the Oriyus have strong sensual predilections. Every night, in their anthropomorphic form, both males and females may come after Indians of the opposite sex". This perhaps accounts for the fact that the biblical term "fornication", has been rendered by orehi, S. wurehu (comp., however, also German Hure, English whore) ;
2) R. oroli, G. horoli, is the name of a big snake which endowed man with the hunting-charms (Una) ; it is the same as the halamali of the Kalina, a drawing of which is given by Roth, 19a Sect. 235. Comp. A. M. § 182, 42;
c) It may be that the heavens are considered to be the abode of the cosmical mother-principle. Indians told v. C. that in the height the wisdom of the vulture (§ 166 s)) is found. The Maipure consider heaven as being of divine nature. Comp. also Arawak iyu. mother, a-io-mun, heaven (§ 71 t» 6)), A. M. *eno, *ina, mother, *eno, heaven. The Arawaks trace descent through the mother ; evidently this is expressed in the word o-io, kindred, people ; it might also be expressed in A. M. *eina-ri, man (homo or vir), *ino, *ina~m, woman or wife (§ 182, 33, 60, 30, 32) ;

d ) G. Harlitvanli, v. C. Haliwalika, Halwanli, R. Hariwalli, B. Arawanili. Arawidi. probably all indicate the powerful deity to whom inanimate things and irrational beings are subject (v. C ) , who metes out justice (§ 212), and became afterwards the sun (adaili, which expresses lord or lordly light). The name reminds one of hali, light, wa, own, li, free or male;
e) By an action of the sun (-deity), a woman became pregnant with twins (§ 213) ; from one of them, the human race, or the Arawak nation is descended.
The adventures of the demi-god, or of him and his brother, or of two animals, form the subject of a great many legends of the Arawaks and other tribes (see Ehrenreich 63, Koch-Griinberg 45d, Roth 19a). In Arawak tales we find the following names :
1) D. Maconauca, v. C. Macanaholo, Macanaura. Probably the same is meant by G. makuranale, "the proper name of the big otter in the fable", and the word might also be contained in G. wagu-makafnre, big species of bat, and waliti-maka (r\to, small ant-eater. It bears moreover a strong resemblance to the Makusi (Karib) name for the same hero, Makuna-ima. The origin of the word has not been ascertained ;
2) Sm. Kurruruman, der hiesige Indianer Grosvater ; Q. Kururuman, the creator of men, Kulimina. the creator of women. Hi. Aluberi (comp. this §, d>) is the supreme being, and Kurunimanny the god or patron of the Arawaak nation. See A. M. § 182, 40. The Maipure name Purrunaminari might mean great lord or great soul ;
3) Mabukulu (without thigh), after he has lost one leg and has become Orion ;
4) The man who roasted his wife (§214) is probably the same hero; but a name has not been given ;
f) Hi., Sc. Kururumanny had two wives, called Wurekado and Emisiwaddo (night-female and morning-female ?). v. C. A girl asked the sun in marriage ; the girl was impatient and opened the sun's box ; instantly the light of the first day appeared.
Harlitvanli had two wives who committed sin with his two brothers. One wife, G. Sibarloyen, v. C. Sibourouyan (rock-soul ?) could not stand the heat of the fire, and was changed into a porpoise, kasekoyah, § 167a) 2 ) , the animal which is alternately below the water, and rises to the surface (comp. the remarks about repeated incarnations in § 168, and the legend told by v. C 7c, 519, of the men who, by way of punishment, were changed into fishes in such a manner that at times their human nature appeared above water). — The other wife, G. Orlico, v. C. Ouriro (fornicationfemale ? or darkness-female, water-spirit) could not remain in earnest, and was changed into a caracara-falcon. beletata (probably a sound-imitation and also 6e/e. lame, tata, strength). — One brother. Ocowama. G. Orlowama. v. C. Ourwanama (fornication-lord ? or darkness-lord ; comp. Akawai Oroan, Taulipang Olozan, the demon of darkness who causes

eclipses, B. 5e, 189, Koch-Griinberg 45d II. 55, III, 171. IV, 34) was banished to a desolate part of the world of spirits. — The other brother, v. C. Hiwanama, G. Hiwanaka (from hiwa, bamboo ??) was banished to a place where spirits lived who extracted his bones ; ultimately he was delivered by Harliwanli;
R. 19a, Sect. 183. Two sisters had a tapir for a sweetheart (— according to Pen. this animal is the symbol for carnal lusts). Their brother killed the tapir, and when the women discovered what had happened, they threw themselves into the water ; one sister turned into a manati, and the other into a porpoise ;
s) The demi-god married a girl, got into trouble with her clan, and finally escaped with the loss of one leg, and became Orion. The girl is Anuanaitu (vulture-daughter), her mother Anuanayo or Ananoyo (vulturemother-spirit) or Taukelolelio (condor-mother-spirit), her father Anuanima (vulture-lord ?) or Kaikoutji (caiman ; however, in a Karib version he is the tiger, Karib *kaikusi). [The name of the vulture or carrion-crow, Q. annoane probably means : heaven-being] ;
h ) x) G. seme, semehe, the good spirits which inspire the medicineman. A similar word with a similar meaning is found in Island Karib, and Pelleprat has mentioned it in his Kalina vocabulary ; it has also been reported from the Great Antilles. The word might be the same as seme, sweet;
2) G. semi~ci, Sm. seme-tti, medicine-man or doctor-priest. In the bible translations : B. semici-ci, S. seme-tti, seme-tti-kill, a sorcerer, B. semeci-hi, witchcraft;
3) Twice the greater part of living men has been destroyed, because of their sins ; the first time by fire, the second time by water (B. 5e, 10, v. C. 7c, 515). Marerewana survived the big flood. This name reminds us of the A. M. name for medicine-man *mariri (§ 182, 49), which probably means "wise man" or "teacher" ;
') !) R. yawahu, G. yawaho, the Arawak generic term for forest spirits or bush spirits, Sm. jawahii, "the Indian's nightmare of something which does them harm, that makes them ill, etc. ; we call it the devil", S. jawahii, B. yauhahu, (biblical) devil, unclean spirit (Acts V. 16) ; y. i. freely, auha, awa, roaming through space, hu forms verbal nouns, § 24, comp. auaduli, wind, a-iaudi- ... a. to be beside oneself, to be mad, § 131 ;
2) yaware, a rainbow (A. M. § 182, 48) ; nature-spirit — no motion ; 3) Sm. da-hudu\paruka jaivale bia da~ebessu\pa baba, when I die I shall perhaps resurrect as an opossum (said a heathen Arawak), lit. I-die if roaming spirit (the same word is used also for opossum and for rainbow) to-be I-transform future again ; J) R. mahui, an evil spirit, the kanaima of the Macusi, etc. (A. M. § 182, 46) ;

k ) R. mansinskiri, a particular nature-spirit : m-, without, ansi, soui, inner peace, love, kin, active being (§ 175'•>) 1
•) R. ekkekuli, a certain kind of nature-spirits, Pen. ekekoli. the maneaters ; eke, to eat ?
§167. ;i) Certain groups of stars are called by the Arawaks (R.)
tu-kuyuha. Each of these has its particular name, consisting of R. -kuyuha.
(j., Pen., v. C. -kuya, -koya, preceded by the name of an animal or plant.
T h e life and activity of that animal or plant species comes from its
eponymous -kuyuha. G. T h e -kuya is a sign, not a spirit ; when, for
instance, the hitsi-kuya, the Southern Cross, appears, the curassow-birds
(hitsi) begin to pair.
W e surmise that the old Arawaks regarded each constellation as the
visible sign of the spiritual connexion between the heaven-world and the
animal or plant and called it : tu-, its, kuyu, navel, u(h)a. own. "Navel'
as a symbol for a spiritual contact is also used by the Kaliria (Pen.
17A III, 137).
The same word is used to indicate : 1) *) the shyness or wildness of an animal or bird, or as a verb ka-
koia, Sm. ka-kuja, G. ka-kuya, to be shy or wild, Sm. a-makujadi-. to tame: 11) Sm. kujata, deer ;
-) aquatic mammals, often mythical : Sm. bara akkujaha, a huge seabeast, aruwa-kujaha, a sea-beast shaped like a tiger, peru-kujuha. seal (Seehund), t-akujaha, whale, R. kassi-kuyuha. a white or black variety of porpoise, embodying a good or an evil water-spirit ; Sm. kassi-kuyuha, porpoise, G. kase-kuya, dolphin, koyumooo, manati ;
3) R. konoko-kuyuha, bush-spirit, adda-kuyuha, tree-spirit ; these spirits generally have a bad name :
4) G. the following mighty spirits : l) yoli-kuyaha, the spirit of tobacco (yuli) ; "true Indians treat
tobacco with awe and smoke but little ; lack of awe may cause illness" : 11) hia\i-kuya, the spirit of the takini-tree (hiali) ; "a true Indian
will not touch this tree, out of awe" ; I I I ) khaleko-kuya. the spirit of the white pebbles in the medicine-
man's rattle (which mostly come from the uplands) ; "'hamaru-ka\ie khaleku buta", they (i.e. persons which still believe in these things) are afraid of those pebbles.
I V ) v. C. hororo-kojaha, the spirit of the earth ; V) v. C. kiringha-koja-no, the spirit which opposes those spirits which bereave a man of his strength (comp. § 166 f ) : muscular. §99lll!>) ; b) Several myths of the Arawaks and neighbouring tribes speak of a time when animals were men, and I. Th.. when discussing the clan-system. tells us that "most Arawaks ... assert that each family is descended — their fathers knew how, but they themselves have forgotten — from its eponymous animal, bird or plant . Whereas animals are supposed to be still connected with the heavenly

REPEATED INCARNATIONS

§ 168

world, the connexion of man with this world has been severed, as is told in the following legends (B. 5e, 178) :
1) The .Koro&o/ja-na-clan "originally came from above the clouds. The weight of a heavy woman broke the rope by which they were descending ; (comp. the navel-string symbol, § 167a>) ; and communication was thus cut off between those who had reached the ground and those remaining above. The Great Spirit, pitying the latter, supplied them with wings and plumage ; and they came down, to colonise the trees above the heads of their brethren — still privileged to live near, and to converse with them, though changed into &oriou/ca-parrots" ;
2) A Koroboha(na) man married a Demare-du, an elphin-maiden, a daughter of the earth, and from this union the Demare-clan has sprung.
Koroboha might indicate the firmament (§ 108Ad>) ; in demare the d may indicate "heavy" or "compressed".
Comp. also D. 8, 102 : In the Arawak country there lived two sisters. One day they saw a creature whom they had seen before only in their dreams and worshipped and loved as a god. He was the first man they had ever seen in bodily form. He told them that his country was above the clouds ; that while hunting he came to a cave, descending which led him to them. This first man taught them to cultivate the cassava, etc. (all trades and implements). From these three persons sprung the Arawaks, [and ever since bigamy has been a custom, or almost a law of the Arawaks] ;
c) In the heaven-world, or some intermediate world, the yu, the motherspirits of the several animal- and plant-species reside, v. C. (7c, 517) the galej-ojo, cassava-goddesses formerly served man. G. After death, before the human soul goes to the world of God, it meets those spirits. If a man in his life has been kind to a dog, then, when he comes to pero-o-yu sikwa bana, dog-mother-spirit house surface, this dog (even if it died long ago) meets him, wagging its tail (pero ctva halikibetoa-q), and gives him many things, and kasiri to drink. But if the man has badly treated a dog, then the dog tells the dog-mother-spirit, and she judges him, and he gets nothing ;
d) There is a tradition that animals are men, who on account of their wickedness have been changed into animals. In the legends birds often play the role of heavenly messengers ; in Sm.'s vocabulary kuddibiu. bird, is the only name for an animal which takes the plural suffix -nu of the rational beings, and the word itself might mean : kadi, driving, racing, bi, tiny, quick, yu, spirit. We suspect that the same ending yu. meaning a spirit, occurs in the word serabokilio, a tempest, § 116d) 9 ) .
§ 168. All Indians believe that after death the soul continues to live (Sc, 21a, II, 319). The following facts might be remnants of an ancient belief in repeated incarnations :
a) v. C, 7c, 512 : The first men ... were happy ; there was no sin, and neither were sickness and death. Every day God descended among them. If someone entered heaven, then he was obliged to die first, because the

§ 169

human eye is not fit to contemplate God. To those Arawaks who had entered heaven and had to return, God gave a new life :
b ) G. Formerly, when an Arawak child died, and a new child was born, the parents sometimes said to suku-to a-koyua kikateba. the little one returns again ;
c ) De la Borde, 62, 15 : The Island Karibs believed that one of their several souls after death went to heaven and took a new young bodv ;
d ) Pelleprat, 68, 77 : Among the Kalina there was a belief that when they died, their soul entered into the body of a child which entered this world ;
e) The Arawaks, and also the Tamanacos (Q., 18, 257, Gillij, 42, III, 5) had a tradition, that man on account of his wickedness has been deprived of everlasting life, which was given to the animals which change their skin (snakes, cockroaches). A Carib legend, told by Brett (5e. 107) tells that before the great flood came : "if age brings evil on you ... Youth renewing, bright and fair : As the serpent glideth clear From the slough he scorns to wear". Pen. 69f, V : The soul of the Kalina changes its body, like a snake changes its skin ;
f) G. The suffix -mi ( = n e w , § 74?) after the name of a person or animal, indicates that that person or animal is no longer in the land of the living, for instance da-yo-mi, my late mother, da-boketsi-mi, my late brother, d-epero-mi, my dead dog. The Maipure equivalent, -mine, is almost the same as meni, mene, field, plantation, and iimeni, a snake (A. M. § 182, 49A, 43).
§ 169. G. u-ya, 1°. that by which plants, animals and men differ from dead matter, 2°. something etherical (shadow, image, aroma, etc.) : possibly ii~ya expresses something intermediate between u-yu, motherspirit, and a, time-reality.

[In olden times the Arawaks believed that in sleep the soul left the body and experienced all sorts of things, and also received forecasts.]
§ 175. A great many object-words show one of the endings -li, -ri, -TO or -ru. Wherever it is possible to analyze such words, it is found that these endings indicate the general character of the thing denoted by the word.
Examples (for the meaning of the roots, see Alphabetical Index) : a) li, freely streaming forth : akorakali, thunder, koreli, smoke, auaduli, wind, oroli, clay ; b) ri, fixed, hooked : kaiiri, island, hori, snake, G. ivayuri, a tick ; c) ro, ru, stopping : bilibiliro, lightning, R. kabadaro, jaguar (withclaws), B. adedisaro, earthquakes ; ll) bali is the ending of several names of trees, for instance G. dakamabali, Andira inermis, ite-bali, Vochysia tetraphylla, sirua-bali, Nectandra ; according to Baptist, sirua-bali means : a tree resembling the sirua-tree, or belonging to the same family. Bali might depict trees standing in a row, comp. § 60 a) ; e) kili, is used in the names of natural phenomena etc. ( § 130a>) ; also : tibo-kili, a bush (A. M. § 182, 111), amudi-kile-hi jiamutu, a shore (Acts XXVII, 39), Sm. amudii-kil, the landing-place (amodi-, to go up), su-mulikile, drunkenness, ma-mulikile, temperance ; f) koro, in ifiro-koro, feast, R. wiwa-k-ihi-koro, (Halley's) comet. It has not been found that the masculine or feminine gender is concomitant with these endings : isa-be-tu (f.) akodoonali, the fair havens,
kia akodoonali isa-tu (f.) koro, the haven was not commodious, auaduli
a-fuda alon jiaro t- (f.) ansi-n, the wind bloweth where it listeth, adaili
abato fa oriroko-n bia n ({.), the sun shall be turned into darkness.
G. hadali futikidah-te-da ? has the sun already risen ? answer : ma-
futikidi(n koa th-a-ya-te-da, the sun has not yet risen. Baptist said that
here the feminine prenominal prefix should be used, notwithstanding the
sun is masculine according to the myth (§ 213).
§ 176. In other forms, however, these endings do indicate the gram-
matical gender:

Certainly, those authors which considered the gender distinction in Arawak and in related languages as evidence of the low mental and social condition of these nations, were on the wrong track. See further § 188.
In B.'s translation of the bible, God ( Wacinaci, lit. our-father) and angel (angel) are put in the human (rational) class ; devil (yauhahu, naturespirits) is put in the nature (non-rational) class.
For The Word (Ajia-hu) the m. pronoun lihi has been used (JI, 3) in accordance with the English text. Otherwise ajia-hu, the speaking, and other words denoting "abstraction" are put in the class of non-rational beings and things. }. XVI, 13, in accordance with the English text, lihi kidua-hu Ialoko, he, the Spirit of truth. Elsewhere Sa-tu Ialoko, the Holy Ghost, the Spirit (Acts II, 4).

Sm. he\du-ke-ssi (also used for "ja, freilich"), f. Sm. he\ki-ssa-i-ra, ki-sse-i-ra ; "ja, allerdings" : f. Sm. he\du-ka-ra, he ki-sse-i-ra ; Pen. wa-the-fa-do dokara, we will go drink as usual, wa-thefa-do dokase, do. (probably the first sung by women, the second by men) ; "gethan" (fertig) : m. Sm. hebbi-sse, f. Sm. hibbi-ra. a—f) Many of these short words contain emphasizing particles which we have already met with. It seems that the sharp si. se (§ 116d> 10)) is used especially by men, the perhaps somewhat softer va (§ 104), especially by women. See further § 191a ) .
s) S m . akkubani-hil o r ukubanni-hii, a garden ( § 128 •>) ; with
pronominal prefixes : I da-kkuban, I pi. wa-, III pi. na-. When addressing men, one says : II ba~, III m. la-, III f. ta-, II pi. ha, when addressing women : bu-, lu-, tu~, hu~. Baptist considers this difference is owing to the fact that women articulate better than men.

CHAPTER XIX
FOREIGN WORDS. ARAWAK AND ARAWAK-MAIPURE
§ 180. The Arawak language has appropriated several foreign words. The Spanish words may be regarded as such, and also the creole-Dutch words which occur in Brett's texts, and partly those in Schultz' texts. Brett uses a great many English words (as: hell, paradise, prophet, temple, angel, incense, praise, apostle, etc. etc.), and Schultz several German words (see list of these words at the end of the Alphabetical Index), but these may not be regarded as having been assimilated.
All these words are — see Alphabetical Index — expressions for postColumbian ideas. Penard (17c) is of opinion "that there is a tendency, though not a strong one, to replace foreign words by others of Arawak origin. Taken all in all, the Arawak language of Surinam does not appear to have been affected so much, as close contact with civilization might lead us to think".
The Arawak does not recognize foreign verbs as such ; he makes an action-word from them, by means of the usual affixes :
From creole-Dutch words : B. a-dankido-(n-wa), to thank, S. a-lesedi-, to read ;
From English words: B. a-baptizedi-, to baptize (baptism, baptism), a-circumcisedo-(n-wa), to be circumcised, a-praisedi-, to praise, aprophesido-(n-wa), to prophesy, a-sacrificedo(-n-wa), to do sacrifice, a-sweardoa, to swear, a-ridi-, to read.
There is no direct proof that Arawak has appropriated words from other Indian languages. However, in Guiana and adjacent territories one often finds that a certain word for a pre-Columbian domestic article, a plant, an animal, or even a supernatural being, is used by tribes belonging to different families of languages. Such regional words also occur in Arawak (see §§ 197—200, where they have been marked r>). and it may be that some of these are not of Arawak origin.
Next come those words, that only occur in Arawak, but the etymology of which could not be traced (see §§ 195—200, where they have been marked u>). We are met here by the difficulty that we mostly do not know which peculiarity is described by a word. For instance, a land-boa is called "the slow one", ma-hole-ru or mawleru ( §§ 112 d>, 175 c)), but we should perhaps never have found this out, if the word had not been explained to us by an Arawak. [This snake is also called Sm. kule-kunna-m, weakwalker.]

Finally comes the great majority of words (among them nearly all particles, pronouns, quality-words and action-words), which are constructed in the manner as shown in our examples in § 20. Although a slight doubt may be entertained here and there, as to whether our interpretation is the correct one, yet on the whole, the evidence that these words are really sound-pictures, complexes of sound-symbols, seems overwhelming.
§ 181. The Arawak words found in the oldest writings (11. 9, 14) do not differ in any perceptible degree from the words as they are used to-day. The differences between the translations of Brett and those of Schultz, are to be attributed to the different views of the translators, and perhaps to a difference in the dialects, in regard to which Schumann says: "Man findet darin verschiedene Dialekte", and Brett : "There is at present some variety existing, principally in the pronunciation of words by people of different districts. But there is no difficulty in the way of their understanding each other, and in all material points there is little difference". This latter is also the author's experience.
W e may, however, still find out something about the early history of Arawak from a comparison with the other languages of the ArawakMaipure group.
As a result of a superficial examination of these languages, we venture to make the following remarks :
All the A. M. languages use pronominal prefixes and pronouns consisting of an emphasizing particle with a pronominal prefix ; in some of them endpoint pronouns, differing but little from the pronominal prefixes, have been met with.
Several A. M. languages apply a pronominal prefix, even when the person is already indicated by an object-word :
Palikur : ri-wasiri Palikurene. Land der Palikur, Toussaint ri-pina, Toussaint's Haus ;
Goajiro : jamusa nu noike Mareigua nu mui Adam ' (su mui Eva, su mui uvi, nu mui yardja), I que hablo Dios a Adan ? (a Eva, a la culebra, al diablo), lit. what he said God him at Adam (her at Eva, it at snake, him at devil), nu-doctrina-ka Jesucristo, la doctrina de Jesucristo, su-rauraka koresia, el Jefe de la Iglesia ;
Kampa : nachi no-tomi, hijo mio, i-utnbari Juan, el amigo de Juan, i-bango Juan, la case de Juan, i-gina, su mujer, o-gime, su marido, i-cachita-te pi-gimme ? esta enfermo tu marido ? o-cachita-te pi-ginna ? esta enfermo ta mujer ?
Baure : r-orani ehiro, or ehiro-coremo. el vestido de varon. r-orani eteno. or eteno-coremo, el vestido de mujer, re-puyi iscini. or iscini-puyi, el pie del tigre ;
Moxo : ma-muiria ehoiro, el vestido del varon. su-muiria esseno. el vestido de la muger, ta-ibope ichini. el pie del tigre, ta-ha-:e to-bea macpiya-co Maimona eto i1 paraque crio Dios essas cosas ? lit. what it-for he-creates God that ?

DIALECTS IN ARAWAK ; OTHER ARAW.-MA1P. LANGUAGES § 181

The pronominal prefixes are : I sing, generally n(u)-, with the exception of : Arawak d(a)-, Goajiro
t(a)-, Paraujano t(a)~ (it is doubtful whether Baure di, which has only been found in d'Orbigny's vocabulary, is of the same origin) ;
II sing, generally p(i)-, b(i)-, Arawak b(u)- ; I plur. ua-, oe~, u-, v-, ab(i}-, a :
II plur : some languages use the same pronominal prefix as in II sing., others use yi~, ye-, i-, e-, Arawak hu- ;
III : A difference is made, more or less distinctly, between one man, one woman, more than one person, and one or more non-rational beings or things ;
III sing. Palikur m. ri~, i. ru-, Wapisiana m. i, f. u, Goajiro m. n(u)~, f. s(u)-, Achagua m. ri-, i. ru-, Maipure m. i-, f. ju-, Kampa m. i-, i. o-, Baure m. r(e)~, f. r(i)-, Moxo m. ma-, f. su-, a woman speaking of a man hi-, non-rational beings and things ta- or to- ;
III plur. mostly n (with different vowels). Plural suffixes are applied to all object-words; however, in the grammars of Baure and Moxo, it is stated that they are but little used, when referring to non-rational beings or things. Other indications of gender are found in the names of family-relations and such like, and in : Goajiro : kasaichir ni-chinka paraja-chi-ka jashia ? como se llama el primer hombre 1 kasaichir ni-chinka paraja-te-ka jier ? como se llama la primera mujer ? Moxo: mo-chijcha-re, (man) sin hijos, mo-chijcha-ru (woman) sin hijos. In Wapisiana, in Maipure, in Ipurina, in Kampa and in Moxo interjections are used which differ according to the sex of the speaker and of the hearer. In Arawak i has, amongst others, the meaning of "small", u or o the meaning of "great". In Moxo we find achipi, small, achope, great. In Maipure the ending-aii is used in order to indicate "for, or of, itself" ; in Baure -bo or -bobo is used for the same purpose, and in Moxo -bo. It seems quite probable that these forms are of the same origin as Arawak -oa. Moxo has numerous words in which the prefix v- means "great", for instance v-a, guevo largo, v-i, fruta larga, v-pai, campo, tierra larga, ti-vequiene, hay mucha distancia de aqui alia. Probably this is of the same origin as Arawak wa-. Comp. also : Arawak wa4-kille, Kusitineri wa-s(y)6-ra, Piro hua~se-ra, Moxo ebo-i-re, far.
Almost all A. M. languages use the prefixes k(a)- and m(a)- to indicate "being present" and "not being present".
Goajiro uses -uma, to indicate "with" (Arawak o-ma), and mui. in order to indicate "at" (Arawak mun). Ipurina uses -muni to indicate "at", "to" and "from", in the same manner as Arawak uses o-mun(i). Piro uses ima to indicate "with".
Otherwise the suffixes indicating mood, tense and case are rather

different in the several A. M. languages, but it appears not at all improbable, that they may have been built up originally from primary elements which have a similar meaning to that which still prevails in Arawak.
§ 182. Several works dealing with a language of the A. M. group, contain a comparative vocabulary. We here give a summary of corresponding words, in order to illustrate the position of Arawak.
Words that are only found in languages belonging to the same subgroup, have been left out. Moreover not all the various transcriptions for a given word have been copied, and complicated phonetic spelling has been simplified. Students who desire to go deeper into the matter, are recommended to consult the original sources.
For the sake of clearness, the languages have been classified into four geographical groups (which do not correspond with the linguistic subgroups of the A. M. family), viz.

CHAPTER XX
ORIGINS OF THE ARAWAK LANGUAGE
§ 183. A few words which are in use in most A. M. languages, are not found in Arawak. These are : I, me, A. M. *n(u)-, Arawak d(a)- ; man, A. M. *e(s)ina-ri, A. loko (human), wadili (male) ; sun, A. M. *kamu, A. (h)adaili; mountain, A. M. *yapa, earth, A. M. *ipai, A. (h)ororo ; mouth, A. M. *numa, A. areroko ; hair, A. M. *(b)itiu, A. o-barra.
The language of the Lesser Antilles, which was closely related to Arawak, and of which important remains have been preserved in Island-Karib, has not undergone these changes. Goajiro and Parauhano have the pronominal prefix t(a)- for the first person singular, which evidently is the same as Arawak d(a)-.
We surmise that Arawak, which is a very living language, has discarded the old words, because their inner meaning was no longer felt. The economical use of pronouns (§§ 16°), 19) may also be an Arawak innovation.
In a few cases in which an Arawak word may be readily explained from the general principles of the language, the same explanation is not applicable to the corresponding A. M. word. Most often, however, the explanation of the Arawak word also holds good for the A. M. word, and this, with what has been mentioned in § 181, makes it very probable, that in primitive Arawak-Maipure, the vowels and consonants were used with a similar meaning to that which they still have in Arawak.
In their vocabularies the A. M. languages show a wide difference, when compared with each other.
Now, an Arawak word is a description of a few salient features of the thing, and the same thing can also be described by mentioning other features belonging to it. And in this way synonymes may come into use, without there being any deviation from the principles of the language.
In other cases the feeling for the inner value of the parts of a word may have been weakened, and as a consequence decaying influences got a chance to creep in. This has perhaps taken place to a considerable extent in Goajiro and Parauhano, and in Wapisiana.
The language of the Lesser Antilles has assimilated great quantities of foreign (Ka'ifia, Karib) words, and it is possible that a few more originally A. M. languages have undergone a similar fate. However, the opinion of Max Schmidt (56b, 105) "Ebenso erklart sich die Verschiedenheit der

§ 184

ORIGIN OF THE ARAWAK SOUNDS

237

Aruak-Dialekte aus einer Verbindung der Aruak-Sprache mit jeweilig verschiedenen anderen Sprachen", goes perhaps a little too far.
Many new words may have come into use, when existing words became tabooed. Concerning the Arawaks, R. (19a Sect. 194, 19b Sect. 881) mentions the following :
"in case of certain animals the Arawak use different names according as they speak of them by day or by night. Thus, during the working hours a jaguar is arda, but when darkness sets in it is kabadaro (claws). Similarly, kamudu, a boa constrictor, becomes akkara (a coil) ; yeshi, an armadillo. is paraphrased into andajika (anda, close, tejika, ear, i.e., ears close together), and so on." And :
"The surest way of offending the W a t e r Spirits, however, and thereby getting caught in a storm, and being capsized, wrecked or drowned by way of punishment, is to utter certain words strictly forbidden under the circumstances. Thus, among the Arawaks of the Pomeroon and Moruca Rivers, there are certain terms which must never be employed when on a boat : they have to be paraphrased. The majority of these tabooed words are evidently of foreign (mostly Spanish) origin : a few are certainly indigenous. Thus, the occupants of a corial will never be heard to use the term arcabuza (gun), but they will speak of a gun as kataroro (foot, referring to the stock) ; they talk of kariro (the one with the teeth) instead of perro (Span., dog) ; of kanakara-shiro (load on the head, the cock's comb) instead of gai-ina (Span., gallina. fowl) ; of akwadoa-kotiro (round foot) instead of kawai-yo (Span., caballo, horse) ; of kakwato (horn) instead of bakka (Span., vaca. cow) : of tataro (something hard) instead of sereri (grindstone, or saw, probably from Span, sierra) : of majeriki (the untrimmed one, referring to the hair) instead of ho-a (monkey) ; of ehedoa (frothing, brimming over, in reference to its snarling or growling) instead of aroa (tiger) ; of katau-chi (the one with wisdom) instead of semi-chichi (medicine-man) etc.".
Pen. (17a, I, 45) mentions crab, tortoise, bird, arrow, as forbidden words when one is at sea.
G. An Arawak who is on the tracks of a tapir, calls this animal kulihi = rat or mouse ; he is convinced that, if he were to pronounce the real name of the tapir, it would then run away.
§ 184. Numerous Arawak words are comparisons and descriptions, several of which may have come into use as paraphrases (§ 183) or nicknames. Examples : G. silotogo wayurY, a padlock, lit. lock (creole word) [resembling a] tick, R. baiyari-shiri, a certain fan-design, lit. sawfish-snout. G. unabuse, a certain blindworm, lit. ground-worm, R. (§183) k-ari-ro. dog, lit. with-tooth-one, ma-jeriki, monkey, lit. un-trimmed.
All these expressions contain a root which is a word in itself. (H)ala, an Indian seat or bench, also designates a characteristic qualitv of the thing, viz. "movable", but in order to express this quality the Arawak

ORIGIN OF THE ARAWAK SOUNDS

§ 184

resorts to making an imitative gesture with the organs of speech. The loose or free movement of the tongue (the loose or free part of the organs of speech) which causes the / sound to be produced, is consistently used to indicate the principle : willing (and able) to move, loose.
In this case there is a direct correspondence between (1°. the thing), 2°. the mental (emotional) image, 3°. the "gesture" of the organs of speech, (4°. the sound).
A still more intimate connection may perhaps be seen in the root le, talking, occurring in the words Sm. a-leledii-, durch einander plaudern, G.
lolo-ka adia-hu, he contradicts, S. a-llepeikattoa, Sm. aAllepekattoa, angeben, verklagen, verklatschen, in gutem und bosem Sinne, es sei wahr oder falsch, S. ue-llerukku, B. areroko, ireroko, mouth (roko, fixed place), a rather new word, § 183 ! B. Hhi k-areroko-ci, this babbler, G. tata lo-leroko, he is impertinent.
In a similar way the act itself is imitated in the roots of the words G. da-thiinda, I cough. da~cida, I sneeze da-eeradoa-ka, I yawn, da-raraida, I belch, d-iwiwida-ka da~leroko abu, I whistle (with my mouth), a-thethedi'n, to whisper, to whisper in the ear (a-tekeda, to advise) ,hatata-rj, to stammer (comp. also § 109, hata, to stick fast), hokokiili-sia de, I hiccup {hadiilikulisia de, I have an eructation), Sm. a-hiikudu-n, to clear one's throat.
Sometimes it seems as if the sound results from pointing out the representative part of the organs of speech ; this may be the case in A. M. *enene, tongue, and in ana (~ka, -ku), the midst.
Further we have a strong suspicion, that the Arawak in saying bu, thou, ebebe, older brother, etc. (Vocative), aba, other, one, a, etc., indicates the person by sending a mild explosion in his direction. The f or p in S. pahia, Sm. pot, interjection of astonishment, and in sipe, bitter (seme, sweet), G. fi(h, a thing no longer fit for use, might be the blowing away of the undesired thing. The m in Sm. erne, interjection of astonishment, and generally the m indicating hesitancy, might be the act of secluding oneself from the unknown or dangerous. The movement of the lips in producing the oa sound, by which the principle "self" is expressed, reminds one of an instinctive withdrawal ("in itself"), and bears a slight resemblance to an animal showing its teeth.
In a similar way the h is used to indicate "breathing out" (ahakobu, to breathe), and as a gentle affirmation (ahe, yes) or deictic movement (n-aha, these, hu, ye), and sometimes these functions merge into each other (ahaka, to tell, to command, -hu forms abstracts, etc., a(h)a-li-kibi, joy). Often the h only serves to put a slight emphasis on an initial vowel, and is written in one vocabulary and omitted in the other (examples in § 111).
The feeling "uneasy, unquiet" is expressed by onno, hunna (§ 127, comp. also Island Karib : he murmurs, horn horn tiem l-aria-ngle, lit. horn horn it-does he-speaks). The feeling "inner peace" is expressed by ansi (§ 8 0 b ) ) . Light is expressed by a-li, dark is expressed by o-ri (§ 126). Though each

§ 185

CORRELATION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT SOUNDS

239

of the component parts of these roots may be accounted for, they are also as a whole rather suggestive.
The use of the d to express a shock, appears to be almost a direct
imitation. Examples : G. do(ido(i ka i, he is limping, hogooo ddrdrosi-(ri. B. adedisaro, earthquake, B. a-dehada, to be leaping, adaridi, to run, Sm. dubuli, sting-ray, issimuddu, electric eel, W y a t t eduolah. a knife (Dudley yeddola, Sm. jadolle, Sagot iadoala, G. yadoala ; oala, a shiver, § 1 20 c ' ) •
Closely related to this is the use of d in words like G. miyu 6-dili, a ship's anchor, and furthermore the Arawak d, expressing : will-power manifesting itself by remaining firmly established, standing, stiff ; " I " ; emphasis.
In Arawak the r is used to express : motion being impeded. R = I -\- d. and on account of this relationship, we can understand that often Arawak d —• Island Karib r.
§ 185. See now the following synopsis of Arawak sounds : i expresses (§§-2, 190) 1°. high tension, time is contracted, 2". the pointlike aspect or central point ; when pronouncing (', 1". the muscles of the tongue are tightened, 2°. the resonance chamber imitates a point in the centre ; o or u expresses 1°. low, or negative tension, time is expanded, 2°. the periphery-aspect; when pronouncing o or u, 1°. the tongue withdraws to the lowest position, 2(). the resonance-chamber imitates a hollow sphere ; a expresses 1". the regular flow of time, 2". the world in its common, everyday aspect ; when pronouncing a, 1". the muscles of the tongue relax, 2°. the cavity of the mouth takes on its natural form ; according to Steiner (71 a, b, c) the a is the natural means for expressing astonishment, "Verwunderung an der Sache " ; the Arawak a, indicating "the world in its aspect of continual change" agrees very well with this ; comp. also § 13 and the interrogative words, ama. alika. alo. § 139. The e, which indicates something like : sickly, delicate, tender, lingering, quality, may really be felt as an a lacking health, or an i lacking energy. The following consonants illustrate by degrees the contrast which we found to exist between the k principle and the b principle, and which we expressed by way of comparison by saying : "the k reminds one of 'creation at work', 'the idea or principle that becomes phenomenon', the b of 'the manner in which that which has been created manifests itself, 'the appearance' ".
H, k, passionless force : h, gentle affirmation or emphasis ; k, a strong force, making its appearance in a positive manner.
N, I, r, personality begins to appear, with a mild, innocent character : metamorphosed vowel -\- -n, the vague, an ending ; n-, the neutral, a beginning, a continuation : /, willing (and able) to move, loose ; r, willing, but not able, to move, motion being impeded.

§ 186

D, t, s, the personal will-power which already interfered in the r,
appears, acts, and is checked, cumulates :
d, firmly established, standing, stiff ; forms causatives ;
t, motion directed towards an object, limited motion (with a touch of
force) ; forms causatives ;
s, form, surface, shale or cuticle. M, b, f, gentle feelings : timorous — placid — aspiring :
m, not daring, hesitancy, new, mild ; b, a separate appearance, quiet, passionless ; f, striving, aspiring, airily, lightly. Furthermore the character of "pointing out" may be seen in : s, the scale or surface formed by the teeth ; perhaps the m in Sm. ue~imihi-ruku, the corners of the mouth, and A. M. *numa, mouth ; also in b, the outer surface. The character of imitating may be seen in : f or p, the pointed form of the protruding lips ; d, the tongue imitates or produces the vertical, the standing ; t, the tongue imitates or produces the horizontal, the moving. N, I, rand h, see § 184. Concerning the place where the sounds are formed, and tension and relaxation of the muscles of the tongue, there is also a relationship between the d, y- and i and between the b, w- and u, having its parallel in relationship in meaning. § 186. Words like R. baiyari-shiri, a certain fan-design, G. unabu-sz, blindworm ( § 184), are of course deliberately invented compounds. But it seems scarcely possible that (h)ala, Indian seat or bench, has been quite consciously constructed from a, time-reality and I, loose, movable. The selecting of the "gestures" of the organs of speech in order to express different feelings and wishes, and the compounding of them into words, must be an intuitional, instinctive action.
The resemblance between Arawak and primitive Arawak-Maipure tends to the conclusion that these instincts are very persistent, and must be inherent in the nature of the people. They might be related to the instinctive, automatic imitating, which may be observed with young children, with monkeys, and with natives of Java suffering from the neurosis called "lata". In a wider sense it might be connected with the imitative tendency which we see in nature.
Now it is interesting, that a sound-symbolism in which the sounds represent something very similar to their meaning in Arawak, seems to be present not only in the Karib languages, but also to a certain extent in Dutch, French, etc. 1) ; sometimes we even find the same sequence of

sounds as in the Arawak word. Also the value of Arawak sounds corresponds more or less with the value of sounds as exposed by R. Steiner (71a, b, c).
W e now begin to see, that there might be some reason for the special importance which the Arawaks, and many other peoples, attach to names.
Be that as it may, the important fact remains, that i n A r a w a k w e h a v e a w e l l - d e v e l o p e d l a n g u a g e , in w h i c h t h e r e is an inner and essential connexion between the idea and the word2).
— In our discussion of Arawak speech, we have paid but scant attention to the sounds which result from the "gestures" of the organs of speech. But of course the auditive faculty plays an important part in the learning of speech, in guiding pronunciation, and perhaps also as an inner function which has something to do with the preparation of the word before it is pronounced. In this connection we may mention the sound-imitative words, of which Arawak possesses several, for instance wakokwa, a pigeon, yohau. a gnat, Sm. hunnu-hiinnuAi, a bumble-bee (comp. Karib *were-were. a fly).
Some other words, which may express a sequence of elementary principles, are so very suggestive, that they constitute as it were a link between built-up words and direct imitations. Examples : Sm. a-ssiirdix-. a-ssurrisurridii-, to spin, to whirl the spindle, B. a-sorofo-, to suck, akorakali, thunder, a-[udi~, to blow, bili~bili-ro, the lightning (comp. Jespersen, 65a Chapter XX Sound symbolism, "No wonder, then, that the Germans feel their word for 'lightning', blitz, singularly appropriate to the effect of light and to the shortness of duration"). See further the duratives, formed by prolonging a sound (action-words, a group), and the reduplications (§ 93).

1) In order that no misunderstanding may arise, the author wishes to state that he did not seek for such a connexion.
The formation of the Karib verbs, suggested the idea, that in Arawak the a might also be the verb, indicating "time" or "happenings". Then the thought occurred, that the i and the o must have a different meaning from the a, and so on. Gradually it became clear that in a great many forms, each vowel and each consonant represents a certain principle, which is, roughly speaking, always the same. — The writings of H. Beckh have been of some assistance in finding the value of Arawak s and n.

It was soon apparent, that affinity between sounds is accompanied by an affinity between the value of those sounds, but only after reading L. Bloomfield s "An introduction to the study of language" (New-York), did the author hit upon the idea, that the Arawak in speaking, reproduces the thing or the event, by making a series of imitating "gestures ' with his organs of speech.

This book was already in the press, when the writer for the first time read R. Steiner's
lecture held at Penmaenmawr, August 26th, 1923 (llVlfo, p. 33 ff.). and the articles of D. Westermann and E. M. v. Hornbostel. mentioned in note 1). p. 240. It says much for the
fundamental soundness of the explanations, that several investigators, working on
different lines, come to similar (though not identical) opinions.

Of course we must not expect that the Arawak system of sound-symbolism represents the very earliest form of speech ; moreover the author's description needs to be perfected.

THE SPIRITUAL ETC.; FREE-WILL; MENTALITY §§ 187—189

Also : k-okkituka-tu. a thistle, in contrast with maba, honey ; tata, hard, in contrast with bele, soft, jelly-like, lame.
§ 187. Concerning the scale of consonants, we still venture the following remarks, by way of hypothesis.
The Arawak calls the lung Sm. tutulla = the deep (§ 122 c)).
His gutturals h, (g), k have the value of the impersonal, of the spiritual, of a creative force ; comp. ahaka, to tell, to command, oini ... iki, Moxo tikui-bo, to rain.
The consonants n, I, r, d and t, which are formed by an action of the tongue, are used to express will-power and related ideas :
n, end-point pronoun III f., "a thing", n(a)- pronominal prefix III pi., ie (from an ancient form *ine), end-point pronoun III p i , -no plural suffix human class, A. M. *n(u), I, me ;
l(o)-, pronominal prefix III m., ZoA:o, man, ~li, -ru form substantives ; d(a)-, pronominal prefix I, di, end-point pronoun I, adaia, to be a ruler, ajia, S. adia, to speak (this might also point to the "gesture'-character of speech, comp. adi, an appearance, § 173a), jia, S. dia, as, like, § 88 a>) ; t(o)~, pronominal prefix III f., -ci, -tu, suffixes forming agent nouns, etc., tata, hard, tata ... o kona, strong, (hi)ti, to desire, etc.. The s expresses as it were the cumulation of the creative forces, or of the will-power ; comp. -sia, the result of an action, etc., siba, rock, isiroko, flesh, isibo, face, isi, seed, (i)sa, child, egg. The word (i)sa is also used in order to indicate "sound", "good", ,,beautiful". It seems that the Arawak considers creation as being good, or even holy (§ 114 a) 4 ) ) . In the series m, b, f we may feel the new life of the created, gradually unfolding ; comp amaro, to be afraid, aburi, to be ashamed, ibara, to be left, a-fitikidi-, to go forth, da fa, I will. § 188. It appears that the Arawak language discriminates between facts which form part of the central government of the cosmos, and facts which show independence or free-will ; the latter are distinguished by the particle oa (ua or wa). To this last category belong, amongst others : atenwa. the beginning, onnawa, to choose, o-loa, heart, mind, kidua, truth, Sm. a-buledu-nn-ua, a source, a well (a~buledi~, to throw away, to lose), and further the "middle voice" of the Arawak verb. [May not this be also the origin of the middle voice in other languages ?] The Arawak expresses "evil" by wakaia, lit. wa. the separate, the freewill, ka, strongly acts, ia. flowing out into time-reality ; the word might then depict pride, non-cooperation with the central government of the cosmos. § 189. a) The use of the particle oa, shows that independence or freewill is to the Arawak something worthy of special mention ; comp. also b-oa, abnormal appearance (§ 120 d>). Related to oa, the separate, is the word aba, which means : that which has the aspect of the created, of a separate thing. The Arawak uses this

§ 189

MENTALITY AND MYSTIC CONVICTIONS

2*15

word (with suffixes) as the numeral 1. He gets at the conception of 2 by dividing the one, of 4 by repeating the same process (§§ 152—155) ;
h) The Arawak says : "they killed him" (na-forra goba i, lit. they-kill past-occurred him), but "fear occurred them" (amaro goba yuho-li loko-no o-bora ie, lit. fear past-occurred many men future-event them), and "youwith me" (ho-ma di, lit. your-humble place me), corresponding to English "they killed him", "they feared [the multitude]", "I am with you".
Evidently, the Arawak is not so strongly possessed by egocentric feeling, as the European.
For the Arawak the "person" is very important : he mentions it in cases where the European would deem this to be superfluous (§§ 10, 16b), 19), and he has several kinds of pronouns (§§7, 44). But his pronouns, and generally also the object-words, are not oa forms (however : o-koborokwa. consciousness, § 120s) 7>). Moreover, he depicts even the person par excellence, the "I", by elementary principles (d-a, d-i), which also occur with the same meaning in the names of all kinds of other objects, actions, etc. It seems as if the consciousness of his own personality, his "I" feeling, does not essentially differ from the feeling evoked by a sensual perception or a remembrance.
In addition to this, we found that there are no sharp lines of demarcation between object-words, quality-words and action-words, and it seems as if in Arawak even object-words express qualities or describe events ;
c) From a ) and b) we might perhaps conclude that the Arawak feels the cosmos, himself included, more or less as a whole ;
d ) One cannot imagine that words as, for instance ala, a bench, ororo, earth, furi, a blade of grass, are the result of logic reasoning. Evidently the Arawak felt the salient qualities of these objects, and when he wanted to name them, his instincts or intuitions prompted him to put his organs of speech into such successive positions as evoked similar feelings.
The old Arawaks — this has already been discussed in § 20 — probably lived far more in the sphere of feeling and will-power than we do. To the sensitive creature, the world is all life and activity, and this may account for the fact that those same Arawaks whose language is so very systematic, logical, sincere and philosophical, before they were christianized, described the world in terms of gods, spirits, souls and magic forces.
Similar beliefs are found all over the world. It may be that they will cease even to seem absurd, when we succeed in interpreting them in the way they were originally meant. Comp. also the following extract from de la Borde's description of the Island Karibs : "Us s'offencent quand on les appelle Sauvages, & qu on leur dit qu'ils n'ont point d'esprit, & qu'ils vivent en bestes : Us repondent que nous le sommes encore plus a leur egard. parce que nous ne vivons pas a leur mode : qu'ils ont leur science, & nous la nostre, comme si il y avoit deux facons de scavoir les choses dans la verite.

U, 0 FEMALE, I MALE ; THE SOUL

§§ 190—191

§ 190. One of the most important elements of the Arawak language, the discrimination between the i and the u principle, expresses the cosmic fact, that energy (or whatever we should like to call it) manifests itself in two forms : u or o, expanded, great, slow, inactive — i, contracted, small, quick, energetic ; also : u o r o , fertile matter, the spirit in an enchanted form — i, the free spirit.
This cosmic fact is described with great clearness in Chinese philosophy (perhaps also in the Indian and in other philosophies).
In Arawak, we find :

Something of a similar nature as the Arawak contrast between the i, (the a,) and the u or o, might be presumed in that which Trombetti (72, § 281 ff.) has described in his chapter II fenomeno della polarita1). Comp. also de Josselin de Jong (66, 213) : "In Indo-Germanic, the higher class is grammatically characterised as active-transitive, the lower, on the other hand, as passive-intransitive".

THE SOUL, FEMALE, FLUID

the soul (or principle of life) boils ( § 169 a> - >). The soul is here considered as having the nature of a fluid. (Comp. also § 80 b>, vexation, trouble, haste, yula or yura ... ansi, presumably : the soul is stirred).
The word hiaro, woman, literally expresses : soul-female thing, or lifefemale thing, and again in our enumeration in § 190, the female, nature and moisture (fertility) appear in the same class.
T, which is used to indicate the female or nature-class, also describes "flowing" (ite, blood, a-ti-, to drink, etc.), and the suffix -ra, used by women (§ 179) also appears in connexion with fluids (§ 107). whereas si, se, the suffix used by men, appears in words denoting matter, flesh (§§H6, 115);
b) The female (u) principle we find in Oriyu, the virgin-mother, aiomun. heaven, o-yu, the animal-mother-spirits, in the water-female of the Taruma legend (Farabee, 41, 143), who became the mother of the human race, in the clan-system in which descent is traced through the mother, in the woman who caused man to descend to the earth (§ 167 b>), and in the woman whose inadvertency caused the big flood, and who became an oriyu, a water-spirit (§ 216).
The male principle we find in Harliwanli, the saviour (sun-deity ?).

§ 192. The author collected: in 1907 vocabularies, communicated by an Arawak woman at Albina ; in 1928 a few words and forms, communicated by an Arawak woman at Zandery I ; in 1928 a great many words, sentences, tales etc., communicated by the Arawak Johannes Baptist, assisted by his cousin Alphoris, both from Mata. The phonetic spelling, mentioned on p. 14 has been used, with the exception of §§ 202, 204, 212, 216—222 and parts of §§ 203 and 214, which have been written down by Baptist in the Dutch spelling ; in these the author has inserted hyphens according to the system adopted in this work. Short sentences from which nothing new can be learned, have not been included in this work, and as a rule the Appendix does not contain such words etc., as have already been mentioned elsewhere in this volume. § 193. A few words of Sm., S. or B. they did not understand, or called them antiquated ; a few of the words collected on this occasion, do not occur with the older writers. The pronunciation approaches very nearly that of Sm.'s vocabulary (in which not all Arawak sounds can tell to full advantage, because Sm. does not use any special phonetic signs ; also the Moravians persistently write p, where nearly all other authors recorded [). The following deviations from the language of the bible-texts have been met with : a) The words are often abbreviated, for instance to ~ B. toho. The following is often heard : -n ~ B. -mun, -nro "••* B. -muniro, -ron ^ B. -robuin ; -m-bia, ~m-bena, -m-bo -— B. -n-bia, -n-bena, -n-bo ; sa '-- B. -sia ; -kona -—- B. -koana, -dona *~ B. donwa ; -(n or -fiy ((means : indistinctly articulated) ~ B. -n ; b) ma-ci, ma-tho —- B. mi-ci. mu-tu ;
mihira - ~ B. mahera, Sm. meheren : ka-yara and ka-raya ~ B. ka-raia ; kapasa (sword) ~ B. kaspara : c) In the stories bia ( § 3 9 ) and fa ( § 5 ) are often used where the English does not use the future ; ya ~ B. ia is also very often used ;

ACCENT ; THE BODY

247

d) Very often the suffix -da is used, probably for the sake of emphasis (comp. § 47A). Also thada is often met with ; perhaps this expresses : th. it, a, is, da, emphasis. The end-point pronoun, however, always comes at the end of the sentence ;
e) The word baikia which is frequently used, possibly means "there happened", or "there was" ;
f) As an end-point pronoun III f. no, as well as n or -q is used. § 194. As much as possible the accent has been marked and indicated by '. Let us, however, not lose sight of the fact that the words, sentences and texts have been pronounced under abnormal conditions, whereby the accentuation may have been influenced. Probably this is the cause that in words that have been separately given, the accent often falls on the first syllable, even if this is a pronominal prefix (the same is the case in Sm.'s vocabulary). Apparently the accent never falls on suffixes such as -ci. -tu-. -li etc.

III. MYSTICISM, ETC.
§ 205. In former times — perhaps even yet in a few places — there were real, able medicine-men (semeci) ; Baptist has known one in his youth. The Kalinas have not exactly the same medicine-knowledge as the Arawaks, and that which they practice (— see the detailed description by Pen., 69f —) is said to have been partly of Arawak origin.
A course in medicine-knowledge is as a rule attended by several persons. First they construct a small house for their study (na-oroa-kona ; I am studying for medicine-man, da-orowa-ka). Each pupil digs a hole in the ground, and is obliged to keep this hole moist for forty days l) by continual vomitting. During this time his whole food and drink consists of tobaccoballs and tobacco-water.
Then a pot is placed outside the hut, filled with the juice of the takinibark, and the pupil inhales the fumes arising from it (see for tobacco and takini, §§ 167a) i), 169^) 2)r a n d D. 8, 285). Now visions appear to the pupil, and the medicine-man explains their signification.
Afterwards the novice is allowed to shoot humming-birds with a bluntheaded arrow ; he may only eat the heart and the head of these birds, one bird per day, divided over three meals. After this, he may eat Trogon viridis. And then crabs, and so on.
§ 206. When anyone is seriously ill, and the aid of the semeci is called in, the semeci examines him in the evening, and concentrates his thoughts on him. After that the semeci goes to sleep, and in a dream the sort of the disease is revealed to him 2). On the second evening the semeci blows tobaccosmoke over the patient, etc. (presumably he now enters into communication with the rattle-stones-spirit, the water-spirit, bush-spirit, etc.)..
Singing by which a spirit is called up : bo-kona-thida-muni yxiki-no, come to me, tobacco-spirit (vocative), ado7]ko-ro\da-fa-do bu-bura-di, thou shalt find me sleeping, anda-thu\ba-te~kana, I request thee earnestly to come, da-mur) guXi-nu d-adia-ka bu-kona-q, I request thee earnestly to come to me.
The semeci now sends a good spirit (li-semehe) to find out what evil spirit, or what human spirit, has caused the illness. If he finds it, he brings it to the semeci, who asks it, why it has done that, and moreover he asks the good spirit to punish the evil one.
§ 207. A child receives its name eight days after birth. The parents or the family consult the semeci. The latter examines the child, and in a dream the sign of the child's future appears to him. According to this sign the name is given (li-semici a-ribirita-ya da\i, or Id simici a-sika-ya l-iri-wa, the medicine-man has given him a name). If the child received a wrong name, it would be ailing all its life.

§ 208. In former times, when a chief had to come to town in order to

visit the Governor, he first rubbed himself with the bulb of the peace-plant {saika-bina, § § 2 9 e ) . 5 8 d > 2 ) ) . Whoever must appear before the judge,

does it also {kirtyadu-bina, white-people-charm, § 164 J> ->). For similar

purposes a Kalifia will rub his body with red paint (from Bixa Orellana),

in which the charm is mixed. Presumably the old Arawaks did this too,

see Q. 18, 239 and R. 19a, Sect. 240A).

§ 209. A swollen place (ahe-kuna : my hand is swollen, da-kabo akoa),

is treated with the plant "touch-me-not" (ayakii(h ) , in powder form. As

the leaves of this plant can shrink, its properties must cause a swelling to

shrink or decrease.

§ 210. A girl having her first menstruation, is isolated by the parents

for three weeks in a hut. All this time there is feasting. Then a piece of

matting is prepared, in the mashes of which ants of the species yoko ate

caught. An old man or an old woman applies this mat {na-rabaioda-n,

§ 104')) to the skin of the girl. By this means the girl will become quick

and industrious like the ants. After this, she is adorned (comp. R. 19a,

Sect. 269).

In the same manner they also have children bitten by ants : "this is good

for them".

§ 211. An Arawak chieftain went to town and there received presents

from the Government. Some Kalinas asked his wife to give them some of

the presents, but the woman refused, whereupon the Kalifas by magic

power sent an evil spirit to that chieftain. He became ill, and died on the

way to his village.

The people of his village became suspicious of the brother-in-law of the

chieftain, a medicine-man living in an adjacent village. That man had

requested to accompany the chieftain to town, and when his body was

brought home, he had said : "look here, brother-in-law, before you went to

town, you were not ill ; how is it, that you have come back as a corpse

(a-udo-ci abudia-ci)T

They prepared a beverage, and invited the inhabitants of other villages

to a feast : two youths were appointed as executioners.

The spirit of that medicine-man had told him everything (le-seme\tha

haka-ka\da\i). The messenger said that no evil would befall him. That night the spirit appeared to him in a dream (le~seme\tha a~yarato-sa-yamun\da\i, or l-etebw] lokoa\tha le~seme a-kaya\de), and said to him : go, but some evil will befall you. Thereupon he went with the messenger.
He was kindly received, but when he drank his third gourd 1), one of the executioners stabbed him with a sword (which had been presented by the Government to the chieftain) in the abdomen, and after that the other beheaded him. The blood bespattered everything, also the vessel containing the beverage.
The feast was stopped, and the beverage poured out. The two executioners immediately began a tobacco-fasting-cure for him, (na-uroafa\tha le-diki) in the same way as the medicine-pupils do (§ 205). Afterwards they buried him.
But the man knew the Arawak medicine-knowledge, and also the medicine-knowledge of other tribes, which he had learned on the Orinoco ; if he wished, he might transform himself into a tiger. His inspiring spirit had left him ; had that not been the case, he could not have been killed. After his death, the spirit returned (lo-6do~n-bena\tha le-seme anda). And then the man caused the death of one of his executioners as soon as the new moon appeared ; and he caused the death of the other a month later. The population were visited by sickness ; the remainder was scattered ; the place was forsaken. Baptist himself has seen the vestiges of that village.
"This is a true story, which happened when my (Baptist's) grandfather was young (14 or 15 years)".("t(k?)idyan-tho a-bali-rj-koba, de-kuthu\da bikidolia-th-a-ri-ka").

1. There was a time when the art of the medicine-man was not yet known; there was a man who as the founder, did it for the first time. 2. The name of that founder was Harliwanli. 3. H. lived in peace with his family; af that time — so people say — the devil was on friendly terms with man ; 4. later, some children of the devil played a dirty trick upon mankind, 5. they behaved very badly, and even mixed excrement with the food of man. 6. Therefore the men were very angry on account of the things they had done to them 7. and the men considered what was the

Then the devil prophesied : 11. all accidents, diseases etc. will come upon mankind ; 12. after the devil had spoken thus, they all disappeared, men have seen them no more. 13. Then the devils began to vex men ; 14. therefore the man I have just mentioned, told the people what they should do with the devils.
15. H., as he is called, said : 16. let us make war on the devils, for if we tolerate this, we all shall perish.

19. Then he took also a calabash to serve as an instrument to work with, and other things which I am not able to repeat. 20. Thus was the beginning of men (Arawaks) knowing the medicine-art.
21. He, the so-called H. began to attain his purpose ; 22. he took his two brothers also to study the medicine-art with him. [After having put everything in order, he took two women as his wives].
23. Some time he lived in peace with his two wives. 24. But the fire

of discontent began among those women ; 25. they began to lead a bad life with the two brothers of that man.
26. The wrong they had committed, could not remain hidden. 27. It reached the ear [of H.], and therefore that man was very angry [with his wives] and he was more angry with his brothers. 28. The name of H. 's first younger brother was Orlowama, the name of his second younger brother I don't know, 29. it is said also that H. had three wives, because he had two wives for himself only J ) . 30. The names of those two women were Orliro and Sibarlojen.
31. H. noticed how wicked his wives were ; therefore he made up his mind, what should happen to them. 32. In order to punish his brothers, he exercised his medicine-art at night.

•) The meaning of this may be, that a man is not fully the master over his first wife, because she is protected by her clan.

That wonderful bird had played with him, because his older brother had wished to trouble him. 45. So he remained there in exile.

H. also severely punished his second brother ; 47. he caused him to disappear to a desolate country, where he had to suffer heavily for some time ; 48. it was a country of spirits which had no bones ; they were like men. 49. When he came there at first, the inhabitants extracted all the bones from his body ; he could not walk any more, because he had

They begin to broil those fishes. 57. One of those women, S. was her name. became oppressed by the heat of the fire ; 58. Thus she said to her husband, I will take a bath ; 59. when she went into the water, she began to swim. 60. After that H. came to look at her and spoke to her : thus you will be transformed. 61. At the same moment he spoke, the woman was changed into a porpoise.
62. When the other woman saw this, she was seized with fear. 63. she

When the woman begged him again, he began to say many talks, so that the woman forgot herself and started laughing again, and could not cease laughing. 68. At every word he said to her, she laughed incessantly ; 69. then he spoke thus : you like laughing and so you shall laugh your whole life long. 70. After he had said that, she changed into the shape of a bird. 71. And to this day that bird is wellknown. 72. Thus H.'s second wife was transformed into a bird. 73.

His two brothers, whom he had banished, had sighed in exile for a long time already, when on a certain day his mother came to him, and begged that they might be released from their place of exile : 78. because she entreated him so strongly, he made up his mind to release them. 79. The names of the two brothers were Orlowa and Hiwanaka. 80. Hiwanaka was exiled into a country of boneless people (spirits ?) ; he could not walk any more, because he had no bones in his flesh. 81. He went there himself, in order to deliver his brother. 82. Before he

He shot it with an arrow, and the place where he shot it may be seen to this day : a circular spot [on a rock, or in the wood ?] 85. He passed by and came to the place where his brother was. He saw his brother, having no bones at all ; other people he did not see ; his bones had been extracted from his body by the inhabitants ; 86. he took the bones and put them again in his brother's body. 87. Then he took him along with him, whilst the inhabitants were still from home. 88. After that he fled with his brother ; when the inhabitants came home, they perceived it.
89. The boneless people pursued them, therefore they ran swiftly. 90.

The boneless people hotly pursued them, and they found an armadillo-hole and entered it. 91. When they were in the armadillo-hole, he put forth his arm and his hand was changed into a snake. 92.

Thereafter they flew away from them, as parrots. 94. H. had brought back his brother, and delivered him out of the hands of the boneless people. 95. Their mother had been anxiously awaiting them, because she did not know what would happen to them. 96. W^hen they had flown out of the armadillo-hole, they went back to their house.
97. After that, H. said to his mother and to his family, that they should prepare themselves. 98. One time parrots flew past their house ; they

Whilst playing, the fruit fell on the ground, just before the house of H.. who at once put his foot upon it and buried it in the soil. 100. Directly the fruit had fallen, one of the parrots flew down, and spoke to him and besought him. 101. It begged him that he should give it back its toy, but he pressed it with his thumb deeper and deeper into the soil. Its begging was of no avail, and so it left him. 102. The takini-fruit grew quickly ; after a few months it had become a big tree with many branches. 103. Then H. said to his family : "let us go away, in order that we may be delivered from this world." 104. Thereupon they all climbed up that tree ; they all went up. 105. The takini-tree had uprooted itself from the earth. 106. So H. with his whole family went heavenward.

The sun was a man, who, every dry season, went to a creek where fish was plentiful. At that place there lived a man who had a beautiful daughter and the sun fell in love with that daughter and took her to wife.
The woman became pregnant with twins. She went to seek for her husband, but she lost her way. She came to a spot where there were man) flowers, and the children in her womb said to her : "Mother, gather those flowers for us, the best of them". The mother carried many flowers with her in her hands. Then they came to a big bees nest, and the bees stung her. And the mother became very angry with her children, and scolded them, and the children grew angry also.
There were two ways ; the woman chose the wrong way l); the children, who knew the right way. would not say anything to her. So the mother came into a desolate country, inhabited by cannibals. These put her into a cage, and there she gave birth to two boys.
These cannibals were vulture-spirits, for the vultures (carrion-crows) are (Creole : opece,) eaters. The common vultures now said : if it is possible, we shall help you, for these people are bad ; if they kill you, they will not give us anything of your flesh.
Then, on a certain day, the mother was killed and eaten. But the children were with an old woman in a hidden place. Then the other vultures said : "what is this we hear ? is it the child of that woman ?" But the old woman answered : "it is only a piece of intestine that I am cleaning, and this is what you hear as the sound of a child".
The old woman brought up the children, and these cared well for her. But when they were grown-up, they would not stay any longer with the old woman. For they said : these are no real people, but eaters ; and they resolved to kill the old woman. They said that they had seen fruits in the wood, and that the old woman should go into the wood to gather those fruits. And there they have murdered her.

THE CHILDREN OF THE SUN

§ 213

Then they walked for many months in the wood, and they came to a place where people had lived ; but the people themselves they didn't see. Then they wanted to see what sort of people lived there, and they climbed up a high tree, and remained there. They saw how an old woman (Taukelelelio, the anuana~yo or anano-yo) came to fish with a big sieve. The woman saw the image of the boys in the water, and thought that they were men in the deep, and she tried to ladle them out with the sieve, but she did not catch anything. The boys reveled in this ; one of them laughed, and the old woman perceived that they were sitting in the branches of the tree. That woman could not climb up the tree ; she was not a real human being, but a devil. Therefore she went to her village to fetch something wherewith she could catch the boys, but she found nothing. Then she went back to the wood and fetched a great many pingo-ants. These climbed up the tree, and bit the boys, and when they could not stand it any longer, they fell to the ground. The woman immediately killed one, and ate him, and took the other in a cage with her.
That woman had a beautiful daughter, who always stayed at home, whilst the woman went out to look for food. The next day, when the woman had gone out, the girl went to the boy and began to talk with him. The boy promised the girl, that he would take care of her mother and her, if she would ask her mother permission to marry him. And so it happened.
But then the boy said : "what will happen, when your mother comes home and brings nothing? then she will eat me. Have you no place to hide me in ?" Then the young woman answered : "I have no hiding-place, but when my mother comes, I will put you on my body, under my kiweyu (apron)".
The mother returned with an empty bag, and was hungry. Then she said to her daughter : "where is that boy ? you have allowed him to escape !" But the daughter said : "it is not a bad boy, he is good to us ; I love him ; he will take care of us ; don 't kill him, for I have known him as my husband". Then the mother gave her consent. And every day the boy went to the sea to catch something.
One day the mother followed the boy, in order to see what he would catch. He caught many fishes, but the mother ate everything and brought nothing to her daughter, and said : he has brought nothing. And this happened many times. And then the boy became angry, and one time he said to his wife : "spin much cotton for me ; I want it for some purpose". But he did not say for which purpose he wanted it.
He came to the sea-coast, and caught many birds, and with their feathers he made something like a wing.
After the mother had eaten everything up the third time more, the man came home, and said : "your mother must come to-morrow to the sea-shore, for I shall catch much, and she should help me to carry it".
He did not catch anything, but he brought the coorial (canoe) in the midst of the water, and told a shark to catch and eat the mother, when she

waded through the water to the coorial. And so it happened. Her milt1) floated on the surface of the water, and began to cry. The daughter in the house heard this, and became afraid, and came running along. But the man tied the wing to his back, so that he would be able to escape, if necessary. When the daughter arrived, the milt spoke again, saying : "your husband has murdered me".
The daughter took some object with which to slay the man. but he began to fly. She could only get hold of his leg. And the man with one leg, flew upwards, and became the constellation of Orion.

1. Long ago, there was a man who killed his wife, and roasted her, because he was angry that she had had him tied up in the rain.
2. Once, when it was raining heavily, he said : I will sleep sweetly. 3. Then she called her brothers to bind him. 4. They bound him really, and during the whole night he stayed in the rain. 5. Only in the morning did they untie him.

10. As his custom was, he went hunting. 11. He hunted and killed many animals and other things. 12. After he had sufficient, and had smoke-dried it, he gathered basket-reed (Ichnosyphon gracile). 13. He split it and plaited a basket of it. 14. When the basket was not yet ready, he said as if in jest to her : try. 15. And he made her sit in the thing he had plaited. 16. After that she went out again. 17. He had not yet finished his work, when he called her again. 18. She went again into

They could not see upwards, because their forehead protrudes over their eyes (do. R. 19a, Sect. 23, 99). 15. Because they saw his image in the water, they knew him to be upon the high tree. 16. Therefore the male bush-spirit began climbing to the top, to get at the person that was on the tree. 1 7. Upsidedown it was climbing ; when he was upside-down, the man hit his testicle (see R. 19a, Sect. 99) with a kufa-huit (Creole abrasa, Clusia sp. 1)), and he died. (Nos 18—27 form part of the history which the narrator had omitted). 18. Before the bush-spirit climbed towards him, he wished to cut down that tree on which he was. 19. When cutting, the axe got loose from the

It is skilfully plastered throughout with the clammy part of] the cu[[a or wild onion, the seeds of which resemble canary seeds, and afford food to some birds. An Indian will avoid treading on an unripe fruit of the cuffa, dreading from its acridity a sore called "stone bruise". At the risk of the stone bruise, the toes rubbed with the cuffa are said to be safe from bat bites." See also R. 19a, Sect. 168.

Because that creeper was very thin, in the water it came together in a heap in coils. 23. [He did not perceive that, and.] Therefore he thought the water was very deep. 24. He let his axe lie in it. 25. "Devil's axe" they call the (a certain species of) tortoise ; it was the bush-spirit's axe which he let fall into the pool which became in ancient times the tortoise. 26. To this very day they call it "devil's axe". 27. He saw the blue sky reflected, and fancied that the water was very deep, and left the axe.

28. After the husband had died, the wife sought for a charm in order to practice magic with the man's foot-prints. 29. Before she went to seek a charm, she took his foot-prints and wrapped them in the leaf of a tree. 30. Then she went to look for a charm, and forgot the packet. 31. After she was gone, that man came down and opened the packet. 32. He took his own foot-prints and put the bush-spirit's foot-prints in their stead.
33. All [the magic things she used] were tree-leaves and wrapped in them a fire-fly [which has the habit, if there is a fire, of flying into it]. 34. From these the charm was made. 35. She thought that it were the foot-prints of the man, but on herself she practiced magic. 36. Then the man climbed again up the high tree. 37. He was still up that tree, when she came. 38. She collected fire-wood and made a big fire. 39. If I

The tortoise, however, had not been working, but had idled, trampling on the grass. 8. The thrush had a child, and the child told its father how its grandmother was reviling him. 9. Therefore the thrush became angry with its m.i.l. 10. The thrush finished cutting the field. 11. It had already burned it too. 12. Its m.i.l. had again prepared kasiri on that new field, 13. in a big jar she put it. [She came to look at the field and collided with a big tree, which had not yet been cleared away ; the vessel containing kasiri touched that tree, and the kasiri] ran out. H. that spilled kasiri became a big lake. 15. The m.i.l. sunk and became a water-spirit.

The m.i.l. had many things with her, among others a cassava-squeezer and grated cassava ; a cylinder of grated cassava which came out of the squeezer, then became the fish kweriman (Mugil Brasiliensis)].

2) In several tales and customs an Indian bench appears as a sign of distinction. D. 8, 264 "The hahtah was the divining stool used by Piai priest-doctors during their incantantions, ornamented with fanciful designs of animals, chiefly the tortoise and the alligator. It is now one of the few ordinary articles of furniture in every Indian household."

1. The tortoise and the opossum once tried which of them could best stand hunger. 2. To this purpose, the opossum tied the tortoise under a plum-tree (Spondeas lutea). 3. At the time the tortoise was tied up by the opossum, the plum-tree was only just coming in bloom ; so the tortoise had to stay a long time under the plum-tree without food, yet it remained alive.
4. So the plum-tree bloomed and bore fruit, and then the tortoise fed upon the unripe fruit which had fallen off. 5. A long time afterwards, the opossum came to look at the tortoise. 6. It found the tortoise still alive. 7. Next time, the plum-tree had ripe plums, and through eating them, the tortoise had regained its strength.

8. Then the opossum untied the tortoise, and they changed places, and the tortoise tied the opossum to the foot of an agave. 9. At the time when it was just coming in bloom, the opossum was tied up to remain there. 10. Many days afterwards, the tortoise went to look at the opossum. 11. In the beginning, when the tortoise called it, it answered with a strong voice. 12. Next time, its voice was weak. 13. Another time when the tortoise went to see it, and called its name, it could no longer answer loudly. 14. Many days later, the tortoise came again to the opossum, it was already dead ; the carrion-flies only answered. 15. And that is why the tortoise can stand hunger so well, [It may do three months without food].

She threw a second time. 6. The third time she went to the beginning of the path after the goatsucker. 7. Suddenly the goatsucker was metamorphosed into a man. 8. And the goatsucker spoke with the girl ; 9. it had become a living man. 10. It is only I, good woman. 11. Because I love you, I appear thus before you. 12. Really he had become a young man. 13.

goatsucker took the girl to be his wife. 14. He was like a real man, and took good care of his wife.
15. A long time afterwards, when the woman had got accustomed to him, 16. He said : I will visit my little mother, go with me ; so the goatsucker enticed the woman to accompany him. 17. So the woman went with him to his mother, and saw his mother. 18. Her mother-in-law loved her very much, and gave many things to her daughter-in-law. 19. Once she gave her d.i.l. an armfull of firewood, but it was not real firewood, they were bones of dead men. 20. Once she gave her d.i.l. kasiri, but it was the fluid from dead bodies. 21. She did not drink ; "I have colic, therefore I cannot drink", said she. 22. Her husband had advised her to act in this manner. 23. [At the place where they were, there were no

And that is why the Indians call the goatsucker "dead man's spirit". [The narrator added : "superstitious people fear these birds".] 1)

§ 220. The man and the goatsuckers
In 1910 I was working in the balata-trade at the Wayombo, and slept in an Indian village. About half past nine, when everybody was asleep, I heard a goatsucker, and when he came near, I heard two. When they were very close, they shook my hammock as if a man was doing it. I felt as though I had been struck by an electric current ; for a quarter of an hour I did not know whether I was alive or not. — I lighted a lamp, and asked the birds whether they were living men or spirits. Then I dreamt that they were two men. — The day after, I told this to the inhabitants, and then someone said : two persons, a man and his wife, have been buried here, at the place where you have slept.

10. She followed him very fast, and the more he ran, the faster she followed him. 11. When he was close by, he went to the wayside and saw distinctly that she was bent. 12. He hit her with an arrow, and she died. 13. She was metamorphosed into a deer (see § 167a) DH)). 14. He ran to his family, and told what had happened. 15. They went

When he saw them coming, he hid behind a big tree which had just fallen in the middle of the path. 6. He saw two big snakes, so-called bushworms (Lachesis rhombeata). 7 Before he had seen them coming to meet him as if they were living men. he had heard them talking. 8. Yesterday I missed him. because I shot at him only with

§ 223. The man and the savanah-dog
There was a man ; his name was Long John. One day, when he returned from a kasiri-feast, about 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, he heard cries as if coming from savanah-dogs (oaliru). First one, then a second. The man was somewhat drunk, and when still another cried, he reviled against them.
A moment later he saw a man coming to meet him, who said : "what did you say just now, don t you know who I am ?" The man was not frightened, because he was drunk, and answered : "I did not speak to you, I only scolded the savanah-dogs. But where do you come from ?" The other said : "I have come, because you have deeply offended me". Thereupon they wrestled. When both were exhausted, the man who had come to meet him, said : "I am stronger than you are ; I go away now, but you must not abuse me any more".
The man did not know whether it was a man, or only had the shape of a man. But it was a spirit (uyahd-wa\thayada\n); [na-yaloko-wa\ijathada would mean : that was the spirit of a human being].

§ 224. The origin of the Besoa-family
(comp. B5e, 176, v. C. 7e Ant III, 484.) There was once a man who lived quite alone ; he had no wife, but only a small delicate dog that remained at home the whole day. Every day the man went hunting, and when he came home, he saw the dog lying there. It is a custom with the Indians, that when the husband comes home, his wife has prepared a beverage for him. Now, one day. the man came home, and saw a vessel with a beverage. He did not know who had prepared that, for only the dog was there.

§ 224

THt: ORKilN OF THE BESOA-FA.MILY

309

He made up his mind to watch who had done that for him. He said to the dog : "I am going away for two days". But he came home earlier, and then he saw a woman baking cassava in order to make a beverage from it. He said : "what woman is that ? I should like to know where she comes from '. He walked softly behind the woman, and there he saw hanging over a beam, the skin of his dog. He took the skin secretly, and threw it into the fire. Thereupon he said to the woman : "you belong to me. and you will remain here".
The woman began to cry and said "why have you done that ? give me my skin back". The man said : "I have burned it ; if you want to be a human being, you should live like one." And so he lived with her ever afterwards, and she became the mother of the Besoa-na.
