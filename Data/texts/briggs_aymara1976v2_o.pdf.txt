INFORMATION TO USERS
This material was produced from a microfilm copy of the original document. While the most advanced technological means to photograph and reproduce this document have been used, the quality is heavily dependent upon the quality of the original submitted.
The following explanation of techniques is provided to help you understand markings or patterns which may appear on this reproduction.
1.The sign or "target" for pages apparently lacking from the document photographed is "Missing Page(s)". If it was possible to obtain the missing page(s) or section, they are spliced into the film along with adjacent pages. This may have necessitated cutting thru an image and duplicating adjacent pages to insure you complete continuity.
2. When an image on the film is obliterated with a large round black mark, it is an indication that the photographer suspected that the copy may have moved during exposure and thus cause a blurred image. You will find a good image of the page in the adjacent frame.
3. When a map, drawing or chart, etc., was part of the material being photographed the photographer followed a definite method in "sectioning" the material. It is customary to begin photoing at the upper left hand corner of a large sheet and to continue photoing from left to right in equal sections with a small overlap. If necessary, sectioning is continued again — beginning below the first row and continuing on until complete.
4. The majority of users indicate that the textual content is of greatest value, however, a somewhat higher quality reproduction could be made from "photographs" if essential to the understanding of the dissertation. Silver prints of "photographs" may be ordered at additional charge by writing the Order Department, giving the catalog number, title, author and specific pages you wish reproduced.
5. PLEASE NOTE: Some pages may have indistinct print. Filmed as received.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This study is based on research conducted from 1970 t h r o u g h 1975 at the U n i v e r s i t y of Florida and in Bolivia and Peru, under the auspices of (1) a graduate t e a c h i n g a s s i s t a n t s h i p ( 1 9 7 0 - 7 1 ) in the A y m a r a L a n g u a g e Materials Project funded by Title VI of the National Defense Education Act, (2) a National Science Foundation graduate fellowship (1971-74), and (3) a University of Florida College of Arts and Sciences graduate fellowship (1974-75). To the sources of that support I wish to express my deep appreciation.
Special thanks are due also to my parents, Ellis Ormsbee Briggs and Lucy Barnard Briggs, who gave me financial and moral support throughout my doctoral studies.
My field work in B o l i v i a was a u t h o r i z e d by the Instituto Nacional de Estudios Lingiifsticos (INEL) and facilitated by the Instituto de Lengua y Cultura Aymara (ILCA). My field work in Peru was a u t h o r i z e d by the Instituto Nacional de Investigacidn y Desarrollo de la Educacidn (INIDE). Copies of this study are being made available to the three named entities, for whose cooperation I am very grateful.

The list of persons who a s s i s t e d me in the research is long. I wish here to single out three persons whose contributions were crucial to my undertaking the task and bringing it to a c o n c l u s i o n . They are Dr. M. J. Hardman, director of my doctoral dissertation, and two native speakers of Aymara who were my teachers at the University of Florida: Ms. Juana Vcisquez, writer and artist, and Mr. Juan de Dios Yapita, founder and director of the Instituto de Lengua y Cultura Aymara of La Paz and p r o f e s s o r at the U n i v e r s i d a d Nacional de San Agustfn in La Paz. Whatever insights I have gained concerning Aymara l a n g u a g e and c u l t u r e are due in large m e a s u r e to their knowledge and patient guidance. Without the training I r e c e i v e d from them and their c o n s i d e r a b l e help in the analysis, this study could not have been completed. Specifically, Ms. Vasquez helped me review the extensive literature on A y m a r a , commenting on the Aymara examples contained therein. Mr. Yapita reviewed a near-final draft of the whole manuscript of this study, sometimes listening to tapes to check the accuracy of the transcriptions of the Aymara examples. Both worked with me in the a n a l y s i s of t r a n s l a t i o n d i a l e c t s c u l m i n a t i n g in Chapter 9.
In the v a r i o u s s t a g e s of the w o r k D r . H a r d m a n was my constant mentor, challenger, and support. The final draft also benefitted from the suggestions of the
v

other members of my doctoral committee, as well as those of P r o f e s s o r Bohdan Saciuk of the P r o g r a m in L i n g u i s t i c s of the University of Florida, who kindly read and commented on Chapters 3 and 4. I also wish to thank Dr. Charles Palmer for preparing the final versions of the maps, and Ms. Patricia Whitehurst for typing the final draft of the manuscript.
In a c k n o w l e d g i n g the help I have r e c e i v e d , I do not wish to imply that this study is free of e r r o r s . For them I take full responsibility, trusting that researchers who follow me will correct my mistakes with ihe same zeal that I have a p p l i e d to c o r r e c t i n g my p r e d e c e s s o r s , in pursuit of the objective we all share--ever more accurate descriptions of the Aymara language.

Abstract of Dissertation Presented to the Graduate Council of the University of Florida in Partial Fulfillment of the
Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy
D I A L E C T A L V A R I A T I O N IN THE A Y M A R A L A N G U A G E OF BOLIVIA AND PERU
By Lucy Therina Briggs
August, 1976
Chairman: M. J. Hardman-de-Bautista Major Department: Linguistics
The Aymara language is spoken on the high Andean plains of Peru and Bolivia from the northern tip of Lake Titicaca to the salt flats south of Lake Poopti. Southwest of Lake Titicaca it is spoken in the upper reaches of some of the river valleys that descend to the Pacific coast and to the east it extends into the subtropical Yungas v a l l e y s , but its domain is primarily the a l t i p l a n o . The total number of speakers approaches two million, of whom a b o u t one and a half m i l l i o n live in B o l i v i a and the r e s t in P e r u . T h e r e are a l s o a few s p e a k e r s in northern Chile. Predominantly farmers or herders, the Aymara have traditionally traded over a wide area, Aymara women p l a y i n g a m a j o r role in regional m a r k e t i n g of agricultural produce.
xi i i

Aymara belongs to the Jaqi family of languages whose other extant members are Jaqaru and Kawki, spoken in the d e p a r t m e n t of L i m a , P e r u . The r e l a t i o n s h i p of Aymara to Q u e c h u a , the other major Andean l a n g u a g e , is undetermined. Dialects of Aymara have not hitherto been systematically studied, although dialectal variation has been known to exist since colonial times. The present study was conceived to begin the task of determining the e x t e n t and c h a r a c t e r of d i a l e c t a l v a r i a t i o n in A y m a r a .
Based on r e s e a r c h in ten A y m a r a c o m m u n i t i e s and incorporating data from a survey of the literature from colonial times to the present, this study examines r e g i o n a l v a r i a t i o n in p h o n o l o g y , m o r p h o p h o n e m i c s , morphology, syntax and morphosyntax, and semantics, and three translation dialects not specific to any one region: Missionary, Patrdn, and Radio Aymara. The appendices i n c l u d e the e l i c i t a t i o n l i s t used in f i e l d w o r k , a l i s t of onomatopoeic particles, regional versions of greetings, a brief d i a l o g u e , a saying, and a riddle, and an index of suffixes.
The study confirms that all dialects share the basic s t r u c t u r e s a t t r i b u t e d to two La Paz dialects in earlier studies by M. J. Hardman and associates at the University of F l o r i d a . Aymara is a polysynthetic language in w h i c h s u f f i x e s play not only m o r p h o l o g i c a l but also
xi v

syntactic roles and retain or lose their own or preceding vowels according to complex morphophonemic rules. All dialects also have certain linguistic postulates: a system of four grammatical persons, a distinction of human and nonhuman reference, and a distinction of direct and indirect knowledge. All dialects are mutually (though not equally) intelligible.
Regional d i f f e r e n c e s occur p r i m a r i l y in p h o n o l o g y and morphophonemics. Two dialects have a phoneme lacking in the o t h e r s , and there is c o n s i d e r a b l e v a r i e t y in phonological s h a p e s in m o r p h e m e s s t e m m i n g from p h o n e m i c instability and morphophonemic variation. Regional patterning involves two overlapping distinctions: (1) a division into northern and southern dialects (with two intermediate dialects sharing some features of both), and (2) a division into central and peripheral dialects reflecting the spread of La Paz influence toward outlying areas that retain c e r t a i n f e a t u r e s La Paz has l o s t . The dialectal p i c t u r e is further complicated by the existence of certain features shared by a few dialects without regard to regional pattern i ng.
While many La Paz innovations are a t t r i b u t a b l e to Spanish influence and all dialects of Aymara appear to be adopting Spanish loans at an accelerating rate, Aymara is a vigorous language that will survive due to natural population increases for at least several generat i o n s . In the long run the f u t u r e of the l a n g u a g e will
xv

depend on many f a c t o r s , not least of which will be the e x t e n t to w h i c h its s p e a k e r s s u c c e e d in f o s t e r i n g its use as a vehicle of literature and education.

Demography Number and location of speakers

Aymara is spoken on the high Andean plains of Peru and Bolivia from the northern tip of Lake Titicaca to the Uyuni salt flats south of Lake Poopd (see Figure 1 - 1 ) . S o u t h w e s t of Lake T i t i c a c a it is spoken in the upper reaches of some of the many river valleys that descend to the Pacific c o a s t , and to the east it extends into the subtropical Yungas valleys, but its domain is primarily the altiplano.
The majority of native speakers of Aymara today are Bolivians and constitute approximately a third of the Bolivian population (Hardman et al. 1975:3.2). As the total e s t i m a t e d p o p u l a t i o n of Bolivia in 1973 was 5.3 million (U. S. Department of State 1974:1), Bolivian Aymara alone may account for well over a million and a half speakers.

made up only 3.5% of the population five years old and older, or 290,125 out of a total of 8,235,220 (Republica del Perti 1 9 6 6 : 4 - 4 5 ) . A c c o r d i n g to t h e 1 9 7 2 P e r u v i a n census, their number had grown to 332,593, although this then constituted only 2.9% of the total population five years old and older (Repdblica del PerQ 1974:2.646). Allowing for the inclusion of Peruvian Aymara children under f i v e , the total of Aymara speakers in Bolivia and Peru today may be estimated as nearing two million.
The 1961 Peruvian census gave breakdowns of Aymara speakers by department and province. Unfortunately, such figures are not yet available for 1972. The 1961 census indicated that of the total 290,125, 83.9% w e r e in the d e p a r t m e n t of P u n o , in the p r o v i n c e s of Puno, Chucuito, and Huancane. Of the rest, 8.4% were in the i n t e r i o r highlands of the d e p a r t m e n t s of Moquegua (province of Mariscal Nieto) and Tacna (province of Tarata), with the remaining 8.5% scattered in the departments of Arequipa (provinces of Arequipa and Islay), Puno (provinces of Sandia and San RomSn), Lima, and Cuzco.
For Bolivia, reliable statistics on numbers and location of Aymara speakers are not available. The m a j o r i t y of speakers are g e n e r a l l y c o n s i d e r e d to be in the departments of La Paz and O r u r o . There are also A y m a r a in the n o r t h e r n and w e s t e r n parts of the d e p a r t m e n t

of Potosf and (Javier Albd and Walter Penaranda, personal communications) along the western border of the department of Cochabamba. The presence of Aymara throughout the department of La Paz is well known although the northeastern provinces beyond the Cordillera Real (Larecajas, Munecas, Bautista Saavedra, and part of Camacho) are shared with Quechua speakers, some villages being pred o m i n a n t l y Q u e c h u a , o t h e r s A y m a r a . The s i t u a t i o n in eastern Oruro is similar, with a preponderance of Quechua as one approaches the Potosf border.
In n o r t h w e s t e r n Potosf b e t w e e n the d e p a r t m e n t s of O r u r o and C o c h a b a m b a the l i n g u i s t i c s i t u a t i o n is complex. The mining centers just east of the OruroPotosf border are Quechua speaking, but surrounding towns, such as Calacala and Morocomarca (see Figure 1-1) are o f t e n A y m a r a . In s o m e of t h e s e , as in C a l a c a l a , the y o u n g e r g e n e r a t i o n is b i l i n g u a l in S p a n i s h and Q u e c h u a rather than Aymara. Although persons over 15 are capable of t e l l i n g s t o r i e s in A y m a r a t h e y o b v i o u s l y p r e f e r to use Quechua; children under 12 do not understand Aymara. The situation is like that noted by 0. Harris (1974) in some other c o m m u n i t i e s in the province of B u s t i l l o s and in the province of C h a r c a s , where Aymara is spoken only at home; its use in public is m e t with e m b a r r a s s m e n t , if not shame, and Quechua is used p r i m a r i l y in public or with strangers. This situation suggests a kind of

5
d i g l o s s i a , perhaps a relic of an earlier time when general l a n g u a g e s c o e x i s t e d with the p a r t i c u l a r l a n g u a g e s used in each locale. Harris has also noted, however, that many areas of Potosf traditionally considered to be Quechua speaking are inhabited by Aymara-speaking groups for whom Quechua does not appear to be becoming the dominant language. For example, the valleys of San Pedro de B u e n a Vista in n o r t h e r n P o t o s f and the area of Llica in western Potosf near the Uyuni salt flats are Aymara speaking.
In some c a s e s , a c c o r d i n g to H a r r i s , the d e s i g n a t i o n of a given ayllu (clan group) as Aymara or Quechua speaking is inappropriate; language cuts across ayllu lines. For example, Harris found that the Machas, who live near the border of Chuquisaca department and are generally c o n s i d e r e d to be Quechua s p e a k i n g , speak Aymara in the most remote part of their valley, near Carasi, province of Charcas. The situation of the Laymis, on the other h a n d , is the r e v e r s e : in the high puna n e a r U n c f a they all know A y m a r a w h i l e in the r e m o t e parts of t h e i r valley they speak Quechua.
These are examples of the complexities that need further study to determine the exact areas where Aymara is spoken today. The mobility of the Aymara must also be taken into account. Predominantly farmers or herders, the Aymara have traditionally traded over a wide area.

6
Aymara women play a m a j o r role in regional m a r k e t i n g of agricultural produce. Aymara families that move to the cities maintain close ties with their villages and frequently own agricultural property at several ecological levels, a system of vertical archipelagos that has existed since prehistoric times (Murra 1968 and 1972).
Aymara is also spoken in the environs of A r i c a , C h i l e , and is t a u g h t at the U n i v e r s i d a d del Norte in that city (Juan de Dios Yapita, personal communication). It may also be spoken along the Chilean border of the Bolivian department of Oruro. Whether the Aymara population of Chile is native or p r e d o m i n a n t l y of recent Bolivian or Peruvian Aymara settlers also needs further clarificati on.
1-1.2 Status
Both Bolivia (in 1970) and Peru (in 1971) have recognized Aymara as a national language, together with Quechua and Spanish, but this action has failed to alter the social fact that monolingual Aymara speakers are e f f e c t i v e l y barred from a c t i v e p a r t i c i p a t i o n in national life (Hardman et al. 1975:3.2). This situation is offset by the efforts of small but active groups of Bolivian Aymara speakers to educate other Aymara and the public at large on Aymara language and culture and to stimulate the p r o d u c t i o n of w r i t t e n l i t e r a t u r e in the l a n g u a g e .

7
These efforts received considerable impetus from the participation of members of the Bolivian Aymara community in the Aymara Language Materials Project at the University of Florida (see 2-4.12) and have continued under the leadership of the Instituto de Lengua y Cultura Aymara (ILCA) and the Instituto Nacional de Estudios L i n g u T s t i c o s (INEL) in La Paz. The Centro P e d a g o g i c o y Cultural de Portales in Cochabamba has promoted the d e v e l o p m e n t of t e a c h i n g m a t e r i a l s in Q u e c h u a and A y m a r a and is involved with ILCA and INEL in sociolinguistic surveys to determine speaker attitudes toward education in the two l a n g u a g e s .
The government of Peru has recently embarked on an educational d e v e l o p m e n t plan which includes primary e d u c a t i o n in v e r n a c u l a r l a n g u a g e s for t h o s e who do n o t speak S p a n i s h . P r o g r a m s in A y m a r a have y e t to be developed but the g o v e r n m e n t is f i n a n c i n g the t r a n s l a t i o n into Spanish of the Aymara teaching and reference grammar produced at the University of Florida (Hardman et al. 1975) for use in t r a i n i n g t e a c h e r s of Aymara c h i l d r e n .
1-1.3 Monolingualism, bi1ingualism, and multi1ingualism
Figures for Aymara monolingualism, Spanish-Aymara bi1ingualism, or multi1ingualism of other types are either lacking or untrustworthy. The 1961 Peruvian census indicated that of the total of 290,125 speakers
-1

8

of Aymara five years or older, 162,175 said they did not speak Spanish when asked if they did and that 96% of t h e s e w e r e in P u n o ( R e p O b l i c a del Perd 1 9 6 6 : 2 - 3 ) . Other official Peruvian sources differentiate coordinate and subordinate bilingualism but the application of these terms to actual cases varies. Redefinitions and refinements of the terms monolingual and bilingual are needed for the Andean situation, which includes such complexities as those of northern Potosf (1-1.1). Some persons e n c o u n t e r e d in t h i s r e s e a r c h w h o w e r e d e s i g n a t e d byother Aymara speakers as monolingual appeared to have a receptive if not productive competence in the Spanish language within a narrowly defined set of topics. Other persons who on first acquaintance appeared to be fairly fluent in Spanish later proved to have many difficulties in c o m p r e h e n s i o n and p r o d u c t i o n . The role of cultural and social factors must also be taken into account. (See the remarks for bilingualism of sources, 1-3.3. Present-day Aymara dialects that show heavy Spanish influence are discussed in Chapter 9.)

History Language family

Aymara is a m e m b e r of the Jaqi language family (Hardman 1975) which Torero (1972b) prefers to call the

9
Aru family. Other extant members of the family are Jaqaru and K a w k i , spoken in Tupe and C a c h u y , r e s p e c t i v e l y , in the highland province of Yauyos about 150 miles south of L i m a , P e r u . Jaqaru is still vigorous but Kawki is dying out.
Citing historical and toponymical evidence, Torero (1972b) has established the probable extension of this language family in the 16th century as from the area of two present provinces of Lima, Huarochiri and Y a u y o s , south to w h a t is now southern B o l i v i a . Aymara occupied the most extensive area, south and southeast of the River Pampas basin in southern Huancavelica and northern Ayacucho departments, while the other Jaqi l a n g u a g e s w e r e spoken in a more r e s t r i c t e d area to the north. Hardman (1966:15) has reported evidence for the existence of a Jaqi language in the valley of Canta n o r t h of Lima in the e a r l y 1 9 0 0 ' s . A c c o r d i n g to T o r e r o the language family entered its expansive phase with the rise of Huari (Ayacucho) and Aymara has since moved south, taking over territories of other languages such as Puquina. Torero has cited his and Hardman's glottochronological calculations as indicating approximately 1,490 years of minimal divergence between Jaqaru and A y m a r a b e g i n n i n g in a p p r o x i m a t e l y A . D. 4 8 0 . By this reckoning Kawki and Aymara are 1,130 years apart, having diverged around A. D. 840.

10
On the basis of these dates and linguistic evidence from Hardman of a closer linguistic relationship between Kawki and Aymara than between Jaqaru and Aymara, T o r e r o has posited the following phases in the expansion of the language family: (1) a first split in the fifth c e n t u r y A . D. or b e f o r e , (2) a s e c o n d s p l i t in the ninth century, and (3) a proto-Aymara period a few centuries before the establishment of the Inca empire. T y i n g t h e s e in with a r c h a e o l o g i c a l e v i d e n c e , T o r e r o has identified the first phase with the beginning of Nazca i n f l u e n c e in the region of A y a c u c h o and the second phase as o c c u r r i n g during the V i n a q u e c u l t u r e c e n t e r e d in the city of H u a r i , w h i c h c o n t r o l l e d the area from Y a u y o s in Lima to southern Cuzco and Arequipa between A. D. 500 and 1000. The third phase coincided with the third stage of the Middle Horizon after the decline of the important Vifiaque centers (Torero 1 9 7 2 b : 9 2 , 9 4 , 9 7 ) .
With respect to the expansion of Aymara on the altiplano, Torero has calculated the date of divergence b e t w e e n the d i a l e c t of Moho in the p r o v i n c e of H u a n c a n £ , d e p a r t m e n t of P u n o , and that spoken near La P a z , Bolivia as about A. D. 1550. While holding that a comparison of these dialects with one from southern Bolivia would show a longer period of separation, he has tentatively suggested that Aymara penetrated the area around Lake T i t i c a c a during the 13th century A . D. in the latter part of his third phase (Torero 1972b:62-63).

Aymara is spoken today in the areas a t t r i b u t e d to the Lupaca, Pacasa or Pacaje, and Caranga or Caranca, and in parts of the a r e a s a t t r i b u t e d to O m a s u y o and Collahuaya, other parts of which, like the other regions cited above, are now largely Quechua speaking. Other areas w h e r e Aymara is spoken today are not included a b o v e , e.g. the present region of Mariscal Nieto province of M o q u e g u a and of T a r a t a p r o v i n c e of T a c n a , P e r u . In a n y case, determining where the early Aymara groups were located is c o m p l i c a t e d by the a n c i e n t Andean system of maintaining vertical archipelagos of colonies at different ecological levels (Murra 1968 and 1972). For example, the report of the administrative inspection (visita general) by Garci Diez de San Miguel of the Lupacac o n t r o l l e d Chucuito p r o v i n c e in 1567 cited the names of towns subject to C h u c u i t o but located in the valleys sloping westward to the Pacific and eastward to the Yungas and the valley of Cochabamba. Among these towns were the following, most of which have modern counterparts: Moquegua and Torata (department of Moquegua), Sama and Tarata (department of Tacna), Larecaja (department of

13
La Paz, east of the Cordillera Real), Chicanoma ( C h i c a l o m a is a m o d e r n town in Sur Y u n g a s p r o v i n c e , La Paz d e p a r t m e n t ) , and Capinota (western Cochabamba department) (Diez de San Miguel 1964:14,17,27,203; modern departments and correspondences supplied).
According to the Relaciones geogrSficas de Indias (colonial geographic reports), the Pacaxe (sic) also had colonies interspersed among those of the Lupaca near the Pacific coast (Jimenez de la Espada 1 8 8 1 : 1 . 3 3 8 ) .
The only detailed information so far available as to the size of any Aymara-speaking population during the colonial period is also for the Lupaca. The earliest figures date from the visita general of 1549 which gave a total of 18,032 heads of h o u s e h o l d in C h u c u i t o p r o v i n c e (Diez de San Miguel 1964:202-203). The 1567 visita found a total of 63,012 persons, children and adults, of whom 15,047 were Urus; the figure of 63,012 was said to include the population of the Chucuito colonies mentioned above. Of the total, 15,404 were identified as taxpayers. The principal cacique of the province, Martfn Cari, claimed an additional 5,000 taxpayers, but Diez de San Miguel disputed this claim, saying that the original figure of 15,404 already included 'many Indians that the said caciques and heads of ayllus d e c l a r e d they had in P o t o s f and La Paz and the p r o v i n c e of Charcas and other parts of these Kingdoms' (Diez de

14
San Miguel 1964:204-206). It may be hoped that as additional visitas from the colonial period become available to scholars (Murra 1970), more details for the populations of the other Aymara nations may come to light.
With respect to the l i n g u i s t i c situation in Chucuito and its colonies, Diez de San Miguel gave little information. He used the term aymaraes to refer to the people but not their language, recommending that priests sent to the area remain long enough to learn 'la l e n g u a c o l l a ' (Diez de San M i g u e l 1 9 6 4 : 2 2 7 ) . Originally the name of one Aymara nation, Colla acquired a wider connotation under the Incas after they designated their southernmost province Collasuyu. According to Tschopik (1946:503), Cieza de Ledn's Crtinica, written about 1 550, used the terms Col 1 a and Col 1ao indiscriminately, and the use of the term Aymara to designate a language first appeared in a relation of Polo de Ondegardo of 1559. The term apparently did not come into general use until the 17th century, however.
It is not clear from the visita of 1567 whether the Urus, who were considered a separate ethnic-cultural group from the Aymara, were nevertheless native Aymaraspeakers. Torero believes the Urus spoke a language related to Chipaya but also spoke one or more of the general languages of the area (Torero 1972b :60). Urus living among the Aymara would speak Aymara but to what

15
e x t e n t or d e g r e e of n a t i v e f l u e n c y is u n k n o w n . T h e r e is some evidence that the Urus constituted a servant class (Hardman, personal communication).
Differences among Aymara dialects have always been considered minor from colonial times to the present. The priests who went to the mines in Potosf to preach and hear confessions had no trouble understanding Aymara speakers from different provinces, according to the Jesuit missionary Ludovico Bertonio (1612, A 2). Bertonio (1603b and 1612) occasionally identified certain forms as preferred by the Lupaca but not until recent times have compilers of Aymara word-lists or grammars sometimes indicated the geographical origins of the forms cited. The published literature gives no indication whatever of social differentiation of dialects as distinguished from regional variation.
1 - 2 . 3 Summary description of La Paz Aymara
The most complete and accurate ethnographic and grammatical description of Aymara to date, based on that spoken in Compi and T i a h u a n a c o , two c o m m u n i t i e s near La P a z , B o l i v i a , is contained in Out!i ne of Aymara phonological and grammatical structure by Hardman et al. (1 9 7 5 : 3 ) . T h e O u t ! i ne d e s c r i b e s A y m a r a as a p o l y s y n t h e t i c l a n g u a g e in w h i c h s u f f i x e s and r e t e n t i o n or loss of vowels perform almost all grammatical functions.

16
Suffixes have complex but usually regular morphophonemics. Some suffixes require a preceding consonant, others require a preceding vowel, and others allow either; some suffixes also determine the retention or loss of their own final vowel. Syntactic units are signalled by final suffixes and by morphophonemic vowel loss or r e t e n t i o n . Suffix order is usually f i x e d , as is word order within the noun p h r a s e ; o t h e r w i s e word o r d e r is fairly free although some orders are p r e f e r r e d .
The phonemic inventory consists of three vowels, vowel length, and 27 c o n s o n a n t s , including p l a i n , aspirated, and glottalized stops and affricates, as well as fricatives, nasals, laterals, glides, and a flap or tri11.
Morpheme form classes are roots and suffixes which together form stems. Root classes are nouns, verbs, particles, and a class of interrogatives cutting across the others. Suffix classes are noun (derivational), verb (derivational and inflectional), independent nonfinal (occurring before inflection on verbs and before final suffixes on nouns and particles), and final suffixes (occurring on any word, after all other suffixes). Verb roots are bound; nouns and particles are free. Class change through verbalization and nominalization (a s p e c i a l kind of d e r i v a t i o n ) is e x t e n s i v e and r e c u r s i v e , creating verb and noun themes. Inflection, defined as

17
closing a root, stem, or theme to further derivation, is limited to verbs and to one noun 'suffix', zero complement vowel drop; noun case suffixes permit further d e r i v a t i o n . Accumulation of suffixes on one stem is c o m m o n .
M o r p h o s y n t a c t i c s u b o r d i n a t i o n is a c c o m p l i s h e d by nominal ization and use of final suffixes to mark dependent clauses. Syntactic processes include use of the demonstrative uka 'that' as linker and summarizer, and sentence embedding with the reportive verb sa.na 'to say'.
Apart from these features, Aymara shares with the other Jaqi languages certain linguistic postulates. Hardman (in press a) has defined linguistic postulates as
. . . recurrent categorizations in [a] language . . . the most tightly tied to the perceptions of the speakers. . . . The most powerful . . . are those involved in the o b l i g a t o r y g r a m m a t i c a l s y s t e m . . . . T y p i c a l l y , a postulate is realized at several levels . . . morphologically, s y n t a c t i c a l l y , and in the s e m a n t i c structure . The principal Jaqi linguistic postulates according to Hardman (1972a) are a four-person system, a distinction of human and nonhuman, and a distinction of direct and indirect knowledge with respect to data source. These three postulates are marked throughout Aymara structure in m o r p h o l o g y , s y n t a x , and s e m a n t i c s .

The Present Study Theoretical bases

Theoretical bases for this study are two: one concerning the nature of language, and the other concerning scientific description of a language.
A language or dialect is a system of interlocking c o n t r a s t s , or r u l e s , used in social and cultural interaction by a given community. Like all natural phenomena language is always c h a n g i n g . At any m o m e n t certain contrasts are being neutralized; certain rules are being suspended temporarily or broken; new rules are being created as people adapt language to their own needs. Some rules are more resistant to change than others; these include the linguistic postulates. But language variation is a m a j o r fact of the nature of language: variation within one idiolect, within one dialect, or in a group of d i a l e c t s . The extreme of language variation is the proliferation of languages that are mutually unintelligible although perhaps still related and sharing a number of rules. The point at which dialects become separate languages is a r b i t r a r y , usually determined by political rather than strictly linguistic considerations.
To investigate variation within a language is to seek a m o r e c o m p l e t e d e s c r i p t i o n of t h a t l a n g u a g e . In a praiseworthy attempt to go beyond one-dimensional,

19
single-dialect descriptions of English, Labov and his followers have developed the concept of variable rules and a methodology to collect and analyze data reflecting t h e m , using statistical m e a s u r e m e n t s . There is an obvious need for such studies of other languages conducted by native speakers trained in l i n g u i s t i c field m e t h o d s . In early stages of r e s e a r c h , h o w e v e r , what is needed are structural descriptions upon which to base later studies in greater d e p t h . Such d e s c r i p t i o n s , w h i l e l i m i t e d in a c c u r a c y and c o m p l e t e n e s s and r e l a t i v e l y i n f o r m a l in p r e s e n t a t i o n , m a y be c o n s i d e r e d s c i e n t i f i c if they meet certain criteria. These are (1) use of sound field methods for gathering and recording not only linguistic, but also relevant social and cultural data; (2) collection of sufficient data to insure the identification of significant features; and (3) adherence to analytical methods that respect the structure of the target language or dialect and that base the description on that structure.
The last criterion implies a willingness to experiment with different models and to select models that best fit the data, while avoiding the temptation to choose for description only those aspects of a language or dialect that lend themselves to description in terms of currently popular m o d e l s , or w o r s e , to force the data into a distorting mold. Ideally, this approach

20
requires the analyst to know how to use a variety of models. Traditional phonemic, generative, or stratificational models might be used for phonology and morphophonemics; structuralism or tagmemics might be appropriate for morphology; generative or interpretive semantics, case grammar, or Chafian models might be used for syntax and semantics.
Unfortunately, questions of time and expediency, as well as personal taste, limit the linguist's access to different models. Moreover, theories and models have a way of evolving into dogmas with schools of more or less fanatic leaders and disciples who demand commitment to one m o d e l , one terminology, one faith. The linguistics scholar wishing to try different models must learn to switch philosophies and metalanguages with the skill of a simultaneous interpreter. Even then, he or she often finds that communication across theoretical boundaries is d i f f i c u l t , if not impossible. Theoretical schools tend to draw circles to shut each other out; few draw c i r c l e s to take each o t h e r in (Edwin M a r k h a m , Outwitted). But different languages and different parts of a given language may call for different theoretical approaches.
For the best results different models should be kept in mind at every stage of a n a l y s i s . For early stages of the investigation the discovery procedures

21
developed by Pike and Nida are still unsurpassed; Hockett's item and arrangement and item and process models are still relevant. Generative grammar has refined the item and process model, enabling it to account more adequately for relationships among rules. The generative phonology model, focusing on distinctive features that underlie or compose phonemes, can illuminate and show in an e a s i l y g r a s p e d n o t a t i o n a s p e c t s of phonology and morphophonemics that structural phonemics is not so well prepared to handle; case grammar or Chafian semantics may offer similar advantages lacking in earlier m o d e l s . H a v i n g a repertory of models or c o n v e n t i o n s to choose from in presenting the rules discovered enhances the likelihood that the linguist will choose the model best reflecting the rules' operati on.
This point of view does not reject the existence or the importance of language universals or the need to search for ultimate t r u t h . It merely holds that at present, linguistic diversity, whether among languages or within one language, is more interesting than linguistic uniformity. By the same token, it favors the encouragement of theoretical diversity as ultimately leading to more accurate and therefore more scientific language description.

1-3.2 Purposes and scope
As noted above, the existence of dialectal variation in Aymara was known in the 17th century, a l t h o u g h differences were dismissed as insignificant. The Aymara examples cited by Hardman et al. (1975) include some cases of dialectal variation between Compi and Tiahuanaco (La Paz) but other contemporary published references to Aymara-dialectal variation are extremely rare. This study was conceived to carry forward the task of describing such variation and thereby to increase knowledge of the language as a whole.
Using the description by Hardman et al. (1975) as a basis for comparison, I decided to sample selectively the Aymara spoken over a wide area (approximately that shown by the shaded area of Figure 1 - 1 ) , investigating phonological, morphological, morphophonemic, syntactic, and semantic variation with a view toward seeking answers to the f o l l o w i n g q u e s t i o n s : W h a t is the e x t e n t of dialectal v a r i a t i o n in A y m a r a ? Is it i n d e e d m i n o r , or does it a f f e c t i n t e l l i g i b i l i t y ? In w h a t parts of the g r a m m a r does variation occur? Does it occur within as well as across dialects? What kinds of variation are most prevalent and/or significant? What are the major features distinguishing dialects and the major dialect groups identifiable on the basis of them? What of interdialectal

23
attitudes: are some dialects more prestigious than others? What of the effects of the dominant language, Spanish: is Aymara an 'oppressed language' showing signs of d e c l i n e , as s u g g e s t e d by Albd ( 1 9 7 3 a ) , or is it vigorous and growing?
Apart from their intrinsic interest for linguistics, answers to such questions would have a number of practical applications. A full description of variation in Aymara is needed for reconstruction of proto-Aymara and of proto-Jaqi, a task already begun by Hardman. D e s c r i p t i o n s of areal f e a t u r e s in c o n j u n c t i o n with i n f o r m a t i o n c o n t a i n e d in c o l o n i a l d o c u m e n t s may e n a b l e historians to reconstruct past population movements and relationships among areas (Murra 1970:20). And now that programs of bilingual education are being undertaken or c o n s i d e r e d in Peru and B o l i v i a , there is a g r o w i n g demand for detailed descriptions of Aymara and other indigenous languages to be used for developing teaching materials.
The field work for this study was conducted from July to September 1972 and from March 1973 to January 1974. After returning to the University of Florida, I reviewed the literature on Aymara from the 17th century to the present, incorporating into the analysis of field materials Aymara texts and grammatical information of relevance to the present study. However, the focus of this study is on Aymara as p r e s e n t l y spoken in Peru and Bolivia.

24
1-3.3 Methodology and data
Methodology for the present study was based on that of Pike (1947), Nida (1965), and Samarin (1967) as interpreted and applied by Hardman. Two complementary kinds of data were sought: (1) free texts recorded on t a p e , and (2) materials obtained through an elicitation list of words, phrases, and sentences presented orally in Spanish to A y m a r a - S p a n i s h b i l i n g u a l s for translation into Aymara.
Free texts included messages of greeting; traditional folk tales, riddles, songs, and sayings; and conversations among native speakers, or m o n o l o g u e s , on such t o p i c s as life in the c o m m u n i t y , f e s t i v a l s , local agriculture, education, illness, and other personal experiences. Recordings were also made of a Baptist sermon in A y m a r a , of B a p t i s t and C a t h o l i c h y m n s , and of several Aymara radio broadcasts in La P a z .
The e l i c i t a t i o n list in S p a n i s h was d e v e l o p e d to obtain a body of data readily comparable from one site to a n o t h e r . Based on the longer Swadesh list, it included words, phrases, and sentences originally elicited in Aymara or one of the other Jaqi languages in e a r l i e r research by H a r d m a n and a s s o c i a t e s and subs e q u e n t l y t r a n s l a t e d back into S p a n i s h as spoken in the A n d e a n a r e a . In the c o u r s e of the f i e l d w o r k for this study, these materials were modified in order to elicit

25
already-identified Aymara grammatical categories and syntactic structures, and individual lexical items showing dialectal variation. Eventually the list was refined to eliminate material not showing variation and to focus on a r e a s of d i f f e r e n c e s . In a r e a s h a v i n g the v e l a r nasal phoneme, Jaqaru words containing it were added to the l i s t in an e f f o r t to e l i c i t A y m a r a c o g n a t e s .
Although the use of Spanish in the elicitation list sometimes resulted in Aymara translations that reflected Spanish syntactic patterns, this drawback was minimized by deliberate inclusion of Andean Spanish examples already paralleling Aymara structure, and balanced by analysis of free texts recorded in A y m a r a . Grammatical structures were also elicited d i r e c t l y in Aymara. For example, verb tense paradigms were elicited by changing subject and complement pronouns once an example of a verb with person/tense suffix had occurred. Because the purpose of the investigation was to elicit variation, it was important to encourage use of local forms which sources might tend to suppress if La Paz dialect forms were used to elicit them; the use of Spanish avoided this problem. For example, using Spanish made it possible to elicit in each site a brief selection of common remarks (see Appendix C). A somewhat a b b r e v i a t e d version of the e l i c i t a t i o n l i s t is given in Appendix A.

26
The free texts provided examples of previously unattested forms or variations which were then sought elsewhere. Although no attempt was made to obtain the same f o l k t a l e s in d i f f e r e n t p l a c e s , a few occurred more frequently than others, providing readily comparable data complementary to that obtained through the elicitation l i s t . All free texts were t a p e - r e c o r d e d ; in most cases translations of the elicitation list were not. A total of approximately five hours of tape-recordings, plus another five hours of data transcribed directly without recording, constitutes the basic corpus of this s t u d y . (Included in the total are a p p r o x i m a t e l y 30 m i n u t e s kindly recorded on my behalf in T o r a t a , Moquegua by Francisco Gangotena and Carlos Saavedra.) Another five hours of tape-recorded texts were used as background only. (Included were some recordings m a d e in Oruro and northern Potosi by Javier Alb6 and generously made available to me.) Several hundred hours were spent in r e v i e w i n g o r i g i n a l t r a n s c r i p t i o n s w i t h o n e or m o r e native speakers, whenever possible the source of the text or another resident of the same community.
(A text r e c o r d e d in a t r i l i n g u a l area of Potost was checked with a Quechua speaker from Llallagua to see whether a certain unusual form might be a Quechua loan, but no formal attempt was made to compare Aymara texts with Quechua.) Some texts were later checked with

27
speakers from other areas, revealing further dialect similarities or differences. Transcriptions were then exhaustively analyzed with regard to phonology, morphology, morphophonemics, syntax, and semantics, including linguistic postulates.
The key factor making possible my entry into and a c c e p t a n c e in the several Aymara c o m m u n i t i e s where I conducted research was my previous training in field methods and study of Aymara language and culture under Hardman and the Bolivian Aymara linguists Juana VSsquez and Juan de Dios Yapita. Carter (1972) has noted that e t h n o g r a p h i c r e s e a r c h in a given c o m m u n i t y can s u c c e e d only if it is desired by a leading member of the c o m m u n i t y , this is true of l i n g u i s t i c r e s e a r c h a l s o . As the first native speaker of Aymara to receive formal linguistics training and to teach Aymara at universities in Bolivia and in the U n i t e d S t a t e s , Y a p i t a is such a l e a d e r . In 1972 he founded the Instituto de Lengua y Cultura Aymara ( I L C A ) in La Paz to e n c o u r a g e the d e v e l o p m e n t of s c h o l a r l y research conducted by and for members of the Aymara c o m m u n i t y . My initial field w o r k in Bolivia was undertaken with his approval and support and with the help of persons who had been his students or were otherwise associated with him; subsequently my work contacts extended to persons who knew him only by reputation.

28
In order to f a c i l i t a t e my r e s e a r c h in P e r u , where his work was not known, Yapita provided me with a t w o - m i n u t e t a p e - r e c o r d e d m e s s a g e in Aymara c o n v e y i n g his greetings on behalf of ILCA and the Bolivian Aymara community. This message, supplemented by my explanation of the purposes of my research and by my assurances that its results would be made available to ILCA to advance the study of Aymara language and culture, served to create a very favorable climate for cooperation among the Peruvian Aymara I met.
Although my command of spoken Aymara was rudim e n t a r y , making it necessary for me to rely heavily on Spanish as a contact language, my familiarity with Aymara grammar and culture and my association with community leadership enabled me to accomplish most of my research goals.

In m o s t cases recordings were made with the participants' knowle d g e ; in the few c a s e s w h e n p a r t i c i p a n t s w e r e not a w a r e that they were being recorded, the recordings were later played for them with the offer to erase anything unacceptable; this was never requested. Typed transcripts of some of the recorded stories were later provided to the tellers, and some have been published through ILCA or the Aymara Newsletter (2-3.12) with due credit given

1-3.4 Sites and sources
C o m m u n i t i e s m e n t i o n e d in this section may be found in F i g u r e 1 - 1 , e x c e p t as n o t e d .
In Peru I c o l l e c t e d data in the f o l l o w i n g communities :
Huancang (province of Huancang, department of Puno)
Juli (province of Chucuito, department of Puno)
Calacoa (province of Mariscal Nieto, department of Moquegua)
Tarata and Sitajara (province of Tarata, department of Tacna)
In a d d i t i o n , I r e c o r d e d in Puno e x a m p l e s of the A y m a r a of Socca (province of Puno).
In B o l i v i a I c o l l e c t e d d a t a in the f o l l o w i n g communi ties:
Corque (province of Carangas, department of Oruro)
Salinas de Garci Mendoza (province of Ladislao Cabrera, department of Oruro)

30
Calacala (province of Bustillos, department of Potosf)
Compi (province of Omasuyos, department of La Paz)
Achocalla (province of Murillos, department of La Paz; just south of the c a p i t a l , and not on Figure 1-1)
In a d d i t i o n , in Bolivia I o b t a i n e d e x a m p l e s of Aymara from the following communities although I did not visit them:
Jopoqueri (Carangas) Morocomarca (Bustillos) Jesds de Machaca, San Andres de Machaca,
and Taraco (province of Ingavi, department of La Paz)
Yapita and VSsquez furnished additional data from their own dialects representative of the communities of Compi and Tiahuanaco (Ingavi), respectively, as modified by m a n y y e a r s of r e s i d e n c e in the city of La P a z . As Aymara translator for the American Universities Field Staff Film Project, VSsquez also provided examples from the d i a l e c t of V i t o c o t a (near Ayata in the p r o v i n c e of M u n e c a s , department of La Paz) from the sound tracks of f o u r f i l m s m a d e t h e r e in 1 9 7 2 .

31
Serendipity was largely responsible for choice of s i t e s ; w e a t h e r c o n d i t i o n s , in p a r t i c u l a r as they related to the state of the roads, determined the timing of v i s i t s . In Peru I i n t e n d e d to visit a r e a s of g r e a t e s t Aymara concentration as indicated in the 1961 c e n s u s . While attending a meeting of the International Linguistic A s s o c i a t i o n in A r e q u i p a in March 1 9 7 3 , I m e t three y o u n g Aymara men who responded to Yapita's recording and my description of research interests. One was originally from Juli and provided me with a letter of introduction to his family t h e r e . Another was a school teacher in L i m a , originally from H u a n c a n ^ ; I interviewed him in Lima and visited his family in H u a n c a n £ . The third was from Socca, near Puno; although I was unable to visit t h e r e , I did obtain several texts from him in Puno.
After the Arequipa meeting I went to Tacna hoping to visit A y m a r a - s p e a k i n g areas in Tarata province. An Aymara taxi driver e n c o u n t e r e d by chance in Tacna took me to the town of Tarata, where he helped me find and interview Aymara speakers. Some months later, after roads became passable, he took me to visit his mother in the nearby town of S i t a j a r a . Shortly t h e r e a f t e r he drove me to M o q u e g u a , where he helped me locate an Aymara bus owner from Calacoa who arranged for me to visit that community and stay with his wife's family.

32
In B o l i v i a I hoped to c o l l e c t data in a r e a s where the Aymara was popularly thought to be different from that of the city of La Paz and its environs. The initial selection of areas to visit was made in consultation with Yapita and with J a v i e r A l b o , an anthrop o l o g i s t with many years of residence and travel in B o l i v i a , but as in the case of P e r u , final choice of sites was fortuitous. A former student of Yapita's was my first source on the Aymara of Carangas. Through him I met a teacher who arranged a visit to his brother's f a m i l y in C o r q u e . L a t e r , the t e a c h e r ' s w i f e i n v i t e d me to a c c o m p a n y her on a v i s i t to her m o t h e r in S a l i n a s de Garci Mendoza (hereafter referred to as Salinas), a trip postponed some months because of impassable roads. With the help of a young woman related to the teacher, I made c o n t a c t with Aymara speakers in the Quechua mining town of L l a l l a g u a , in northern P o t o s f , who invited me to visit the nearby town of C a l a c a l a . In U n c f a , near Llallagua, I met through the local parish priest a young Aymara man from the village of Morocomarca and interv i e w e d him in Uncfa as time did not allow a v i s i t to Morocomarca.
As in the case of choice of s i t e s , the selection of sources (the term source is being used here in preference to the somewhat negatively loaded term informant) was random. An attempt was made to obtain data from both

33

sexes, of different ages and educational levels ranging from illiteracy to completion of several years of university study. Occupations included market seller, certified school teacher, bus driver, farmer, student (elementary, secondary, normal school, or university), taxi driver, housewife, university professor, administrator of community development programs, and Baptist minister. All sources 40 and under were bilingual in the sense of being able to carry on an intelligible conversation in S p a n i s h , although in some cases their p h o n o l o g y was heavily Aymara (see 1-1.3).
Below is a chart showing s e x , a g e , and (for sources over 40) knowledge of Spanish, the latter determination based usually on a speaker's self-evaluation. Ages shown are approximate as age was not obtained for all sources. An average of six sources was consulted for each major site, the numbers ranging from one to 13.

34
As may be seen, a preponderance of sources were under 40 and hence by d e f i n i t i o n bilingual in S p a n i s h . (Sources from Calacala and Morocomarca were trilingual in S p a n i s h , A y m a r a , and Q u e c h u a . ) M o n o l i n g u a l s w e r e relatively less accessible to me than were bilinguals primarily because lack of time and difficulties of travel prevented visits to remote communities where m o n o l i n g u a l i s m is reportedly w i d e s p r e a d and secondarily because most m o n o l i n g u a l s e n c o u n t e r e d in the communities visited were elderly and infirm, often with missing teeth and consequent faulty diction. Determination of the location of communities with a high proportion of monolinguals of different ages must await future research, preferably with the participation of native speakers trained in l i n g u i s t i c field m e t h o d s .
With regard to training of native speaker l i n g u i s t s , an informal a t t e m p t was m a d e t h r o u g h o u t this research to instill in sources the basic concepts of anthropological linguistics and field methods, by example if not in formal c l a s s e s . For e x a m p l e , two young women from urban centers were taken on field trips to act as interpreters and to learn the basics of informant-investigator relations. One source who already had a firm grasp of the Yapita phonemic alphabet (3-2) was asked to transcribe a tape-recorded story from a dialect other than his own, at whose telling he had

35
been p r e s e n t . His m i s t a k e s in t r a n s c r i p t i o n were significant in showing points of difference between the two dialects and, when brought to his attention, made him aware of the ways that one's own language or dialect grid may structure one's perception. Throughout the research I m a i n t a i n e d and e n c o u r a g e d in all persons with whom I worked an attitude of respect or even e n t h u s i a s m toward the diversity that became apparent, noting, however, their occasional 1inguocentric comments (see 10-2.6).
1-3.5 Organization of the study
This study is o r g a n i z e d into chapters on the following topics: a survey of literature on Aymara from the c o l o n i a l p e r i o d to the p r e s e n t ; v a r i a t i o n in phonemics and in phonological shape of m o r p h e m e s within and across dialects; variation in m o r p h o p h o n e m i c s , including rules general to all dialects and rules limited to certain d i a l e c t s ; v a r i a t i o n in the noun s y s t e m , in the verb s y s t e m , and in m o r p h o s y n t a c t i c and s y n t a c t i c structures and p r o c e s s e s ; v a r i a t i o n in s e m a n t i c s , including a section on the nonvarying linguistic postulates; three translation dialects: Missionary, Patrdn, and Radio Aymara; and a conclusion summarizing kinds of variation, identifying regional dialect groups on the basis of significant variation, and offering suggestions for future research. Following the chapters there are Appendices

36
as follows: (A) the elicitation list used in field w o r k ; (B) a list of onomatopoeic particles; (C) regional versions of greetings and certain common expressions; (D) regional versions of a saying and a riddle; and (E) an index of suffi xes.
1-3.6 Conventions and terminology
In this s t u d y the f o l l o w i n g c o n v e n t i o n s are o b s e r v e d , c o n f o r m i n g in m o s t c a s e s to t h o s e used by H a r d m a n e t a l . (1 9 7 5 ) .
A y m a r a e x a m p l e s are u s u a l l y w r i t t e n in the Yapita phonemic alphabet (see 3-2) modified by the use of a colon (:) rather than a dieresis mark (") for vowel length in o r d e r to p e r m i t s e p a r a t i o n of m o r p h e m i c length from the vowel it occurs on. Occasional examples are g i v e n in p h o n e t i c t r a n s c r i p t i o n w i t h i n s q u a r e b r a c k e t s ([]). Place names are spelled as they appear on maps for ease of reference although users of the Yapita alphabet prefer to spell them according to its rules, e.g. Qumpi for Compi. Aymara examples from published sources other than Hardman and associates are usually converted to Yapita orthography. All examples not attested by Hardman et al. (1975) or later reported by Vcisquez, Yapita, or me are preceded by a raised cross ( + ) ; morphemic as well as phonemic analyses of such forms are m i n e . An asterisk (*) before an example means it is u n a t t e s t e d ; context will indicate whether it is

37
rejected by native speakers or presumed to exist on the basis of other evidence.
Periods separate morphemes within a word, e.g. uta.xa 'a/the/my house.' Unsuffixed bound roots (verbs) are f o l l o w e d by a h y p h e n , e . g . j u t a - ' c o m e . ' In c i t a t i o n form, suffixes which may close a construction are preceded by a hyphen, e.g. the final suffix -xa. Other suffixes are preceded and followed by a hyphen, e.g. the verbal derivational suffix -t'a-. Recurrent submorphemic partials are placed within hyphens and within slants, e.g. /-pa-/. A lowered v before a suffix indicates it must be preceded by a vowel; a lowered v after a suffix indicates it must retain its own final vowel when followed by another suffix; a lowered c before a suffix indicates it must be preceded by a consonant; a lowered c after a suffix indicates it must drop its final vowel before a following suffix and/or when it o c c u r s w o r d - f i n a l l y . For e x a m p l e , in m o s t d i a l e c t s the possessive/1ocational suffix - v n a c is preceded by a vowel but drops its own vowel word-finally and before following suffixes, e.g. uta.n, uta.n.xa 'in/of the house.' When a suffix may be preceded by either a vowel or a consonant the more common (or base) occurrence is indicated above a tilde (~) and the less common below the tilde, e.g. ~vja first person possessive suffix.
c A similar notation after a suffix indicates it may in

38

some c i r c u m s t a n c e s keep and in o t h e r s lose its own final v o w e l . If no subscript v or c follows a s u f f i x , either other factors determine the retention or loss of the final vowel or the rule has not yet been determined.
Grammatical persons are indicated by the numbers 1, 2 , 3 , and 4 , usually followed by a p, e.g. - ja Ip possessive suffix, -ma 2p possessive suffix. Verbal inflectional suffixes have the subject person on the left and the complement person on the right of a rightp o i n t i n g a r r o w , e . g . l->2 m e a n s lp s u b j e c t , 2p c o m p l e m e n t .
Verb tenses are sometimes abbreviated as S (Simple), F (Future), I (Imperative), RDK (Remote Direct Knowledge), RIK (Remote Indirect Knowledge), D-l ( D e s i d e r a t i v e ) , D-2 ( R e m o n s t r a t o r ) , IF ( I n f e r e n t i a l ) , and NI (Non-Involver).
Aymara examples are underlined when treated as base forms or words (that is, as morphemes or combinations thereof):

juma.mpi 'with you'

juma 2p pronoun

-mpi 'with'

. . . the suffix -jama and variants . . .

Jupa.x wali suma j a q i . w a . 'He/she is a good

person.1

Aymara examples are placed between slant lines when

treated as allomorphs:

39
. . . / - m p i / o c c u r s in La P a z , / - n t i / in S a l i n a s . . . . . . The suffix -jama has the allomorphs
/-jama/, /-:ma/, /-ja/ . . .
What may sometimes appear to be inconsistency with respect to this notation will be due to the fact that a m o r p h t h a t at the individual d i a l e c t level is a base form (morpheme) may be considered an allomorph of a morpheme at the supradialectal level and/or in another d i a l e c t . In such cases c o n t e x t will d i c t a t e w h e t h e r the m o r p h is to be treated as an a l l o m o r p h or as a m o r p h e m e . If there is only one invariant allomorph for all d i a l e c t s , it will always be underlined unless given in phonetic t r a n s c r i p t i o n . If there is one a l l o m o r p h that occurs almost e v e r y w h e r e (even if some d i a l e c t s have o t h e r s ) , it will be considered the base form of the m o r p h e m e in question and underlined, e.g. the final suffix -xa w h i c h has the a l l o m o r p h /-:/ (vowel l e n g t h ) in some a r e a s . If a morpheme has several a l l o m o r p h s , they may all be referred to at once in alphabetical order and underlined, e.g. the suffix -mpi ~ -nti, the suffix -taki - -tak"i ~ -tay.
E x a m p l e s are g l o s s e d in one of two w a y s : (1) If the example is short or for added c l a r i t y (for example when a morpheme occurs without its final vowel) individual morphemes are glossed to the right:

40

jani.w 'no'

jani 'not'

-wa final suffix

[2) If the example is l o n g , it will be glossed beneath and followed by a free translation of the whole example:

'How stupid you are, you are a shame to the human r a c e , an honor to dogs.' (La P a z / C o m p i ) (Yapita 1975:3)
As shown here, examples from Yapita are identified as being from La Paz/Compi; similarly, material obtained from Vcisquez is identified as being from La P a z / T i a h u a n a c o Thus is noted the fact that both have lived many y e a r s in the city of La Paz a l t h o u g h t h e i r d i a l e c t s are basically those of their communities of origin.
Noun suffixes and verbal derivational suffixes are identified in e i t h e r (or b o t h ) of two w a y s : (1) by a term describing the function of the suffix, e. g. -mpi agentive/instrumental , or (2) by a gloss, e. g. -mpi 'with, by'. Function terms are not placed within s i n g l e q u o t e s , w h i l e g l o s s e s a r e . The f u n c t i o n t e r m

may be a neologism like di stancer (used for the verbal derivational suffix -waya-); such terms are those used by Hardman et al. (1975).
Aymara s e n t e n c e s , defined by the presence or absence or certain final suffixes, have the first word capitalized and usually have a period, question mark, or exclamation point at the end. Often the final suffixes in A y m a r a c o n v e y s e m a n t i c and e m o t i o n a l o v e r t o n e s w h i c h are c o n v e y e d in spoken English by i n t o n a t i o n and in w r i t t e n E n g l i s h by p u n c t u a t i o n . W h e n a q u e s t i o n m a r k or e x c l a m a t i o n p o i n t would be s u p e r f l u o u s in A y m a r a they are usually omitted even though the English gloss may carry them. Aymara examples that are not sentences in A y m a r a m a y in some cases be t r a n s l a t e d by s e n t e n c e s in E n g l i s h but in such cases the Aymara p u n c t u a t i o n will u s u a l l y be a d h e r e d to in the g l o s s as well as in the Aymara example unless meaning would thereby be obscured. Example:

kama.cha.ta.:.rak.pacha.:t"a

'what could have happened to me' (Sitajara)

Spanish words o c c u r r i n g in Aymara sentences are written as Spanish if they were so p r o n o u n c e d , e. g. contento 'happy, content'. If they were phono!ogically adapted to Aymara (Aymarized) they are written as Aymara, e . g . k u n t i n t u . In some c a s e s d e c i s i o n s w h e t h e r to t r e a t a given word as Spanish or Aymara were arbitrary, and a few hybrids occurred, e. g. Pedru.

CHAPTER 2 A SURVEY OF THE LITERATURE

Introduction

This chapter discusses the contents and merits of selected works relating to Aymara dating from the colonial period to the present. The two major bibliographical sources for w o r k s on or in Aymara are (1) Bibl iograffa de las lenguas quechua y aymarci by Jos£ loribio Medina (1930), and (2) the monumental four-volume Bi bl i o g r a p h i e des L a n g u e s Aymarci et Ki'cua by Paul R i v e t and Georges de Crgqui-Montfort (1951-1956; henceforth Rivet). To my knowledge no bibliographical work specifically on Aymara has been published since Rivet's fourth volume (1956).

Colonial Period

As is well k n o w n , the Spanish found no written m a t e r i a l s in the l a n g u a g e s of the Inca E m p i r e . In the 16th and early 17th c e n t u r i e s all works published in or on Aymara were written for the purpose of spreading the Christian faith by missionaries assisted by unnamed Aymara

43

44
converts bilingual in Aymara and S p a n i s h . Such works consisted of catechisms and other religious tracts and of grammars to be used by missionaries wishing to learn to speak and understand the language. The earliest work known to contain Aymara is the anonymous Doctrina C h r i s t i a n a , y c a t e c i s m o para la i n s t r u c c i d n de los I n d i o s , p u b l i s h e d in Lima in 1584 (Rivet 1 9 5 1 : 4 - 9 ) .
According to Rivet (1956:631) a study of the early Catholic evangelization of Peru from 1532 to 1600 and the use of Aymara and Quechua as languages of conv e r s i o n is C r i s t i a n i z a c i d n del Perfl ( 1 5 3 2 - 1 6 0 0 ) by Fernando de Armas Medina (1953). Two other publications useful for i n f o r m a t i o n a b o u t A y m a r a s o c i e t y in the 16th century are Visita hecha a la provincia de Chucuito . . . en el ano 1567 by a colonial a d m i n i s t r a t o r , Garci Diez de San Miguel (1567), reporting on his inspection of Chucuito province (see 1 - 2 . 2 ) , and an ethnological appraisal of the Diez de San Miguel inspection, Una apreciacifln etnologica de la visita by John V. Murra (1964).
The first attempt at a complete grammar of Aymara was written by L u d o v i c o B e r t o n i o in the e a r l y 17th c e n t u r y . Born in 1552 in I t a l y , B e r t o n i o j o i n e d the Company of J e s u s in 1 5 7 5 . S e n t to Peru in 1 5 8 1 , he remained there for 44 y e a r s , dying in Lima in 1625 or 1628 (Rivet 1951:26-27). Bertonio apparently spent most

45
of his t i m e in J u l i , c a p i t a l of the A y m a r a - s p e a k i n g Lupaca k i n g d o m , on the shores of Lake T i t i c a c a . There he wrote three grammars of A y m a r a , a Spanish-Aymara/ Aymara-Spanish dictionary, and several Aymara translat i o n s of r e l i g i o u s t e x t s . In 1 6 0 3 he p u b l i s h e d two g r a m m a r s , an A r t e b r e v e de la l e n g u a a y m a r a ( 1 6 0 3 a ) and an Arte y grammatica m u y copiosa de la lengua aymara (1603b). A facsimile edition of the latter was published in Leipzig in 1879 by Julio P l a t z m a n n (Rivet 1 9 5 3 : 3 5 ) . Juan de Dios Yapita owns a volume containing the first 14 pages of the Arte breve (Bertonio 1603a) bound together with pages 19 through 348 of the Arte y grammatica muy copiosa (Bertonio 1603b); the latter is missing the title p a g e s , a section entitled Al lector, and pages 207 and 208. A photocopy of the Yapita volume is in the library of the U n i v e r s i t y of F l o r i d a .
In his l o n g e r g r a m m a r of A y m a r a (1603b), B e r t o n i o gave a d e t a i l e d d e s c r i p t i o n of the l a n g u a g e in terms of Spanish and Latin. Spanish spelling is adapted (inconsistently and inaccurately) to Aymara sounds, Spanish grammatical categories are translated into the nearest Aymara equivalents, and Spanish sentences are rendered into A y m a r a . The grammar is valuable not only as an example of the Latinate grammars of American languages written during the colonial period but also for the wealth of material it provides on the Aymara

46
language of the Lupaca kingdom in the e a r l y 17th c e n t u r y . These data and Bertonio's analyses must be carefully r e i n t e r p r e t e d , h o w e v e r , in the l i g h t of t e c h n i q u e s of contemporary linguistic scholarship and recent discoveries concerning Aymara language and culture. A review of individual forms attested by Bertonio (for example, verb derivational and inflectional suffixes) shows many forms i d e n t i c a l w i t h s o m e in g e n e r a l u s e t o d a y , o t h e r s in use in only one or a few p r e s e n t - d a y A y m a r a d i a l e c t s , and still o t h e r s not a t t e s t e d in m o d e r n A y m a r a but e x t a n t in o t h e r Jaqi l a n g u a g e s . In some c a s e s the s e m a n t i c s of a form have shifted since Bertonio's time, if his t r a n s 1 at ions m a y be taken as a c c u r a t e . But t h a t is a problem: reviewing Bertonio's Aymara sentences with Juana VSsquez has revealed that most of them are unacceptable. At best they sound translated; at worst they are perceived as simply incorrect even when archaic or unknown terms are replaced by contemporary terms. The book contains no native Aymara texts--no sentences forming a n a r r a t i v e that m i g h t have been spoken in the language by native speakers — but only translations from Spanish or Latin of isolated words, phrases, or sentences.
B e r t o n i o ' s grammatical a n a l y s i s of the l a n g u a g e missed many important features because of its focus on Spanish categories. Nevertheless, Bertonio was a careful observer and tireless organizer of his material.

47
On the morphological level his analysis is often accurate in d e t a i l . For e x a m p l e , his g r a s p of the i n c l u s i v e / e x c l u s i v e d i s t i n c t i o n in the A y m a r a p e r s o n s y s t e m is essentially correct (Hardman 1972b). With respect to syntax and cultural content, however, Bertonio's grammatical analysis must be characterized as distorted and inadequate.
According to Rivet (1951:52-53), there exists a third A y m a r a g r a m m a r by B e r t o n i o , A r t e de la lengua aymara ( 1 6 1 2 ) , c o n t a i n i n g s e n t e n c e s in Aymara and Spanish and a list of Aymara words; the only known copies are report e d l y owned by the P o s n a n s k y f a m i l y in La Paz and by the B i b l i o t e c a Nacional in S u c r e , B o l i v i a .
In 1612 B e r t o n i o p u b l i s h e d his V o c a b u l a r i o de la lengua a y m a r a which has s i n c e a p p e a r e d in several facsimile e d i t i o n s , m o s t r e c e n t l y in La P a z , Bolivia in 1956. This lengthy book is a d i c t i o n a r y , the first part (474 pages) Spanish-Aymara and the second (398 pages) A y m a r a - S p a n i s h , with approximately 50 entries to a page. A thorough study of this book with native speakers is long overdue to determine how many and which forms are in use t o d a y and to c o r r e c t e r r o r s e v i d e n t in a s a m p l i n g of the entries.
LaBarre (1948) (see 2-3) performed the useful service of culling out and repeating, with English transl a t i o n s , some c a t e g o r i e s of w o r d s in the V o c a b u 1 a r i o such

48
as k i n s h i p t e r m s , d i s e a s e s , and sins to be r e p o r t e d in confession. Checking these with Vcisquez revealed that many terms cited by Bertonio are perceived today as awkward translations of Spanish terms into Aymara rather than as native w o r d s or e x p r e s s i o n s . In this c o n n e c t i o n it is i n t e r e s t i n g to note that in the i n t r o d u c t o r y section to the Vocabulario Bertonio indicated that he took the entries (1) from Aymara translations of the lives of Christ and the saints, sermons, comparisons of vices and virtues, and so forth written by certain Aymara brought up as Christians during the 35 years that the Jesuits had been in J u l i , and (2) from s i m i l a r m a t e r i a l s c o l l e c t e d by other p r i e s t s . The entire d i c t i o n a r y , in o t h e r w o r d s , was based on materials translated from Spanish into Aymara, not the other way around.
An example with respect to kinship is illustrative. In m o d e r n A y m a r a the n o m i n a l i z e d verb apa.na 'to c a r r y ' may also be used with the metaphorical meaning of 'cont e m p o r a r y ' , 'of the same age' (i.e., a person carried by his/her mother at the same time as another person was similarly carried). Bertonio translated it (or the derived term apa.na.ni 'having a contemporary') as 'relative' (Spanish pariente), and used it to translate sentences like 'If that woman is your relative you may not marry her.' The present-day meaning of the Aymara sentence (see 6 - 3 . 3 4 . 1 3 ) is 'If that woman is y o u r

49
contemporary you may not marry her.' It seems unlikely that a semantic shift has occurred with this word since the 17th century. Rather, the Bertonio gloss probably r e f l e c t s an initial d i f f i c u l t y in t r a n s l a t i o n when the Aymara i n t e r p r e t e r , having no one term in his language for 'relative', finally approximated it with a p a . n a . The bafflement of the Aymara at hearing an injunction to marry only someone older or younger may only be imagined. Other such translation errors or distortions have contributed to the development of the translation dialects Missionary and Patrdn Aymara (Chapter 9).
Such errors may well have contributed to the d i f f i c u l t i e s the m i s s i o n a r i e s e n c o u n t e r e d in their efforts to convert the Aymara. Bertonio acknowledged such d i f f i c u l t i e s in the V o c a b u 1 a r i o in a s e c t i o n addressed 'to the priests of the Aymara N a t i o n ' . Denying that Aymara was a difficult language (he said the J e s u i t s in Juli l e a r n e d to p r e a c h in the l a n g u a g e in a y e a r ) , he conceded that students of the language tended to become d i s h e a r t e n e d , d i s c e r n i n g in the A y m a r a a low capacity for learning and a strong resistance to conversion.
. . . they are so given to bad customs, their hearts are so full of spines and thistles, that the seed of the divine word planted there will not bear fruit . . . (Bertonio 1612:unnumbered page facing A 3; English translation mine)

50
The stubborn refusal of the Aymara to be conv e r t e d , in spite of the best e f f o r t s of gifted and energetic priests like Bertonio, was attributed then and later to incapacity coupled with sheer cussedness. Recent discoveries with respect to Aymara linguistic postulates (see 8-2) have put the Aymara recalcitrance in a new l i g h t . In any e v e n t , n e g a t i v e s t e r e o t y p e s of the Aymara character had by the end of 35 years become fully accepted among the colonizers and were to persist well into the 20th century (see 2-3).
Very similar to Bertonio's work although shorter is a grammar by another Jesuit assigned to J u l i , Diego de Torres R u b i o , whose A r t e de la lengua aymara appeared in 1616. A p h o t o c o p y , the original of which belongs to the Instituto de Lengua y Cultura Aymara in La P a z , is in the U n i v e r s i t y of F l o r i d a L i b r a r y . T h e p h o t o c o p y and the original lack pages 65 through 68 and pages 72 through 77. The volume contains following the Arte the c o m p l e t e C a t e c i s m o en la lengua e s p a n o l a y aymara del Piru o r i g i n a l l y p u b l i s h e d in Sevilla (1604) on the b a s i s of m a t e r i a l s d a t i n g f r o m a P r o v i n c i a l C o u n c i l in Lima in 1 5 8 3 . A c c o r d i n g to Rivet (1951 :75), several known copies of the Torres Rubio 1616 grammar are bound with the C a t e c i s m o in this m a n n e r .
It is not known whether Torres Rubio and Bertonio collaborated or worked independently. They were almost

51
the same age and had similar careers. Torres was born in 1557 in S p a i n , j o i n e d the J e s u i t s in 1 5 7 2 , and a r r i v e d in Peru in 1 5 7 9 . He died t h e r e in 1637 or 1638 (Rivet 1 9 5 1 : 7 1 ) . In 1967 M a r i o (to be d i s t i n g u i s h e d from Alejandro) Franco Inojosa published a version of the Torres Rubio Arte in m o d e r n S p a n i s h , giving the Aymara in T o r r e s ' o r i g i n a l s p e l l i n g s f o l l o w e d by t r a n s c r i p t i o n s in the o f f i c i a l Peruvian a l p h a b e t for Aymara and Quechua a d o p t e d in 1 9 4 6 .
After the middle of the 17th century the early fervor of missionary activity subsided and for the next hundred y e a r s little was p u b l i s h e d in Aymara e x c e p t occasional sermons, few of which have survived. As described by Tovar (1961:186-194) the alternating linguistic policies of the Spanish conquerors help explain the r e l a t i v e d e a r t h of m a t e r i a l s p u b l i s h e d in A y m a r a between the second half of the 17th century and the late 18th c e n t u r y . In 1550 it was decided to teach the I n d i a n s in S p a n i s h . As this a t t e m p t proved u n s u c c e s s f u l , in 1583 the policy of using native languages was adopted, stimulating the production of grammars and r e l i g i o u s texts in those l a n g u a g e s . By 1596 the e a r l i e r policy was reinstated over the missionaries' objections. The impasse was resolved in practice by the use of general languages which at first included Aymara although during the 17th century it gave way to Quechua. By the

52

late 18th century the Spanish crown had expelled the Jesuits from Peru and shortly thereafter the crown restored the Spanish-only policy. Nevertheless, the wealth of material on New World languages which the Jesuits had g a t h e r e d soon began to be published in E u r o p e , m o s t l y in the form of c o m p a r a t i v e v o c a b u l a r y l i s t s . From t h a t time on the amount of published Aymara material gradually i ncreased.

Prelinguistic Studies--l9th and 20th Centuries

Prelinguistic studies are those written without benefit of the theories or techniques of modern linguistic scholarship or dealing primarily with other than linguistic aspects of Aymara culture.
The great European philologists Hervas, Vater, A d e l u n g , P o t t , and J £ h a n , w r i t i n g in the late 18th and e a r l y 1 9 t h c e n t u r i e s , i n c l u d e d in their e n c y c l o p e d i c w o r k s references to Aymara taken from earlier sources and superficial comparisons of Aymara words with those of other l a n g u a g e s . In the second decade of the 19th century political speeches and documents relating to the indep e n d e n c e m o v e m e n t s in South A m e r i c a w e r e p u b l i s h e d in some native languages including Aymara.
In 1826 appeared the first P r o t e s t a n t m a t e r i a l s in A y m a r a , t r a n s l a t i o n s of the New T e s t a m e n t . From then

53
on a series of such translations emanated first from the British and Foreign Bible Society and subsequently from the United States. Catholic materials (mostly by Bolivian p r i e s t s ) began to a p p e a r in g r e a t e r n u m b e r s a l s o . L a t e r in the 19th century there began to a p p e a r accounts by European scholar-adventurers of their travels on the Bolivian and Pervuian altiplano. These usually included grammatical sketches of Quechua and Aymara or word lists of numbers, animals, plants, medicines and diseases, and kinship terms.
The first detailed ethnographic account of the Aymara was On the Aymara Indians of Bolivia and Peru by David Forbes (1870), based on research done in Bolivia and Peru from 1859 to 1863. A British mining engineer of scholarly bent and the stamina necessary to remain for long periods at altitudes up to 15,400 feet, Forbes was best at concrete measurement and description of the activities he witnessed. His account of the Aymara was somewhat sympathetic, revealing the relentless physical hardships and social injustices they suffered, but some of his explanations for Aymara behavior suggest he may have given too much credence to tales spread by whites and mestizos based more on myth than on fact.
Forbes gave Aymara names for objects, activities, and the like most of w h i c h , though deformed by an inadequate transcription, are recognizable today. His

54
grammatical analysis of Aymara is sketchy but accurate so far as it goes. Appendix C of his book is a vocabulary of Aymara words, including kinship terms, with English translations. Forbes cast light on the status of A y m a r a s t u d i e s at the time in r e m a r k i n g on his f r u i t less e f f o r t s w h i l e in Bolivia to obtain a copy of a 17th century Aymara grammar or dictionary even though he had advertised in the papers that he would pay the 'high sum of 50 dollars' (274, fn.) for it.
In 1891 t h e G e r m a n p h y s i c i a n - t u r n e d - p h i l o l o g i s t Ernst Middendorf published Die Aimar3-Sprache, the fifth volume of his study of aboriginal languages of Peru (Rivet 1952:558). The introduction to Middendorf's Aymara grammar was translated into Spanish by the Bolivian scholar Franz T a m a y o in an a r t i c l e p u b l i s h e d in 1910 in La Paz (Rivet 1952:558). Later, the Peruvian scholar Estuardo NCinez, working from an incomplete copy of the T a m a y o translation, revised and added some notes to it and published it in a volume entitled Las lenguas a b o r i g e n e s del Perfl ( 1 9 5 9 ) p r e p a r e d u n d e r t h e a u s p i c e s of t h e U n i v e r sidad M a y o r de San M a r c o s in Lima to c o m m e m o r a t e the 50th anniversary of Middendorf's death. The following section refers to that volume (1959:96-102).
Middendorf indicated that his grammar was based on B e r t o n i o ' s and on the d i a l e c t then spoken in La P a z , which he visited on several o c c a s i o n s . He stated that at

55
that time both whites and mestizos spoke Aymara but in most cases only as a lingua franca for communication with Aymara servants or sellers in the m a r k e t p l a c e . Middendorf was able to find only a few persons with enough knowledge to teach him the l a n g u a g e . Like F o r b e s , he found no one who possessed a Bertonio grammar, adding that no one had even heard of such a book, not even the President of Bolivia or members of his cabinet. Middendorf was finally able to find some lawyers who had lived among rural Aymara and claimed to know more of the language than the city-dwellers. With them Middendorf reviewed a copy of the B e r t o n i o grammar in his p o s s e s s i o n , c o m p a r i n g forms then in use with earlier o n e s , noting b o t h , and using them to d r a w up r u l e s of s e n t e n c e f o r m a t i o n . In the introduction to his Aymara grammar he devoted several paragraphs to Aymara vowel-dropping, giving examples of inflected v e r b s , and commented on Aymara verbs of going and c a r r y i n g . It is to be hoped that someday Middendorf's grammar of Aymara may be translated into Spani sh.
In 1917 a n o t h e r A y m a r a g r a m m a r based l a r g e l y on Bertonio's appeared, by Juan Antonio Garcia, a Bolivian priest. Subsequently, etymologies and word lists for such topics as kinship, place names, and musical instruments proliferated, and a number of Aymara stories, poems, and legends were written by self-styled Aymara scholars

56
(aymar61oqos). Novels on Indian themes, such as Alcides Arguedas' Raza de bronce (1945), contained some Aymara phrases. There was a continuous spate of dictionaries or handbooks of Aymara, Quechua, and Spanish words and phrases, as well as both Catholic and Protestant publications.
The matter of a standardized alphabet for Aymara and Quechua has engaged the sporadic attention of scholars and g o v e r n m e n t s for y e a r s . In 1939 the T w e n t y - S e v e n t h International Congress of Americanists proposed an a l p h a b e t for A y m a r a and Q u e c h u a w h i c h was a d o p t e d by official Peruvian g o v e r n m e n t d e c r e e in 1946 (Rivet 1 9 5 6 : 2 6 5 ) . In 1 9 5 4 t h e B o l i v i a n g o v e r n m e n t a d o p t e d a v i r t u a l l y identical alphabet approved earlier that same year by the Third Inter-American Indigenist Congress (Rivet 1956: 675).
Catholic missionaries on the altiplano adopted this alphabet. It represents an improvement over earlier ones in that it shows p h o n e m i c vowel length; d i s t i n g u i s h e s plain, aspirated, and glottalized stops and an affricate1 in the proper a r t i c u l a t o r y p o s i t i o n s ; and d i s t i n g u i s h e s
t h e v e l a r and p o s t v e l a r f r i c a t i v e s . B u t it uses t h e
five Spanish vowels to represent the three phonemic Aymara vowels and allophones of two of them which are not always predictable from the environment, unnecessarily confusing the transcription.

57
Meanwhile, Protestant missionaries developed a variation which employs some Spanish letters, such as £ and £u to r e p r e s e n t the Aymara velar s t o p , in the belief that their use makes it easier for the Aymara to learn Spanish. This alphabet, known as the CALA alphabet for the first initials of the Comisidn de Alfabetizacidn y Literatura Aymara (Aymara Literacy and Literature Commission), was adopted as official by Bolivian government d e c r e e in 1 9 6 8 , a p p a r e n t l y w i t h o u t r e s c i n d i n g support of the earlier alphabet. Since then the two official Bolivian a l p h a b e t s have coexisted in uneasy c o m p e t i t i o n .
B e g i n n i n g in the 1930s A m e r i c a n a n t h r o p o l o g i s t s turned their attention to the study of Aymara society. The Aymara (1946) and The Aymara of Chucuito, Peru 1. Magic (1951) by Harry Tschopik and The Aymara Indians of the Lake Titicaca Plateau, Bolivia (1948) by Weston LaBarre are generally considered classics, but research in the l a s t d e c a d e has shown them to be d e f i c i e n t in important r e s p e c t s , based as they were on data obtained through mestizos and whites. A more balanced account is The Aymara of Chinchera, Peru: Persistence and change in a bicultural context (1964) by John Marshall H i c k m a n , reporting on a Peruvian Aymara community near that studied by Tschopik 20 years earlier; Another look at Aymara personality (1966) by John S. Plummer questioned earlier negative assessments of the Aymara character. William E.

Carter has conducted extensive studies among the Bolivian Aymara in the d e p a r t m e n t of La Paz. His B o l i v i a , a profile (1971:89-91) brought together the various expressions of the A y m a r a n e g a t i v e s t e r e o t y p e and p u t t h e m in h i s t o r i c a l p e r s p e c t i v e . The Bolivian Aymara (1971) by Hans C. and J u d i t h - M a r i a B u e c h l e r is a s o m e w h a t s u p e r f i c i a l n e t w o r k analysis of the community of Compi on Lake Titicaca.
The languages of South American Indians (1950) by John Alden Mason contains a short section on the Aymara l a n g u a g e , but it is full of i n a c c u r a c i e s , not only with respect to the supposed relationship of Aymara to other languages, but also to identification of Aymara-speaking areas and dialects. Catcilogo de las lenguas de America del Sur (1961) by Antonio Tovar represents a slight i m p r o v e m e n t in t h e i n f o r m a t i o n p r o v i d e d but the w o r k is still incomplete and inaccurate and the brief grammatical description of Aymara is very weak. Other publications on Aymara well into the 1960s testify to the sorry state of scholarship with respect to the language.
Characteristic are the many virtually identical h a n d b o o k s or c a t a l o g u e s of c o m m o n e x p r e s s i o n s in A y m a r a , Q u e c h u a , and S p a n i s h p u b l i s h e d in B o l i v i a , P e r u , and even Chile from the middle of the 19th century to the p r e s e n t . (The latest to come to my attention is dated 1971, but new editions have probably appeared since then.) These little books contain the kind of Aymara spoken by

59
white and mestizo landowners who learned to speak the language imperfectly as children and whose attitude toward the Aymara people and their language ranges from kindly but patronizing to contemptuous. This kind of Aymara is referred to as Patrfin Aymara (from the Spanish patrdn 'owner') by Bolivian Aymara native speakers. In the c a t a l o g u e s i n d i v i d u a l f o r m s m a y be c o r r e c t l y t r a n s lated but Spanish phrases are translated word for word into Aymara that is usually discourteous if not i n s u l t i n g , and often incorrect. Moreover, chaotic spelling reflects a very inadequate grasp of Aymara phonology. (See Chapter 9 for examples.)
A variation on the catalogue is GramStica del kechua y del aymara (1942) by German G. V i l l a m o r . It contains short grammatical descriptions of Quechua and Aymara, a brief three-way dictionary of words from those two languages and Spanish, and sections on history, myths, and s u p e r s t i t i o n s . Insofar as the Aymara is c o n c e r n e d , the book is d e f i c i e n t in e v e r y r e s p e c t , with i n c o r r e c t material poorly arranged. Another variation on the catalogue is V o c a b l o s a y m a r a s en el habla p o p u l a r pacena (1963) by Antonio Paredes Candfa, containing Aymara words p u r p o r t e d to occur in c o l l o q u i a l La Paz s p e e c h . A c c o r d ing to Vcisquez, who reviewed the book with m e , many of the A y m a r a forms are i n c o r r e c t l y t r a n s l a t e d and in any case are terms used by w h i t e s or m e s t i z o s in the city

60
rather than by rural A y m a r a . The book is useful p r i m a r i l y to show what the white or mestizo understands by certain Aymara w o r d s . Usually the context is not culturally Aymara and the tone is patronizing when not a c t u a l l y insulting.
Two works which avoid the condescending tone of the foregoing are a short Spanish-Aymara dictionary by Mario Franco Inojosa, Breve vocabulario castellano aymara (1965), and a more complete dictionary, Diccionario breve c a s t e ! 1 a n o - a y m a r a a y m a r a - c a s t el 1 a n o (1 970), by P e d r o Miranda. Mario Franco Inojosa, who updated the Torres Rubio grammar (1616), uses the official Aymara alphabet a d o p t e d by the P e r u v i a n g o v e r n m e n t in 1 9 4 6 . M o s t t e r m s he cites are the same as those used in La P a z , making it useful for quick reference for that dialect; however, the book is cheaply printed and has many typographical e r r o r s . The Miranda d i c t i o n a r y (1970) is more c o m p l e t e and better printed, and employs the official Bolivian a l p h a b e t adopted in 1954.
Although it reflects patr6n and missionary usages, by far the best of the pre!inguistic grammars of A y m a r a is Gramcitica y d i c c i o n a r i o a y m a r a (1 9 6 5 ) by Juan Enrique Ebbing. This reference grammar, was modeled on Bertonio's longer grammar (1603b) and like it contains a wealth of detai1, although the geographical origins of the forms attested are not given. The author's method

61
is to explain a Spanish grammatical c a t e g o r y and then to give its t r a n s l a t i o n e q u i v a l e n t in A y m a r a . T h i s m a k e s for a repetitious presentation as the same Aymara form may translate several different Spanish forms, and the m e t h o d skews Aymara s t r u c t u r e into a S p a n i s h m o l d as in the case of Bertonio1s grammars. While some of the Aymara examples are acceptable to native speakers, much of the Aymara sounds translated and the book suffers from a g e n e r a l l y patronizing tone. The phonology is better than m o s t but c o n f u s e s v e l a r s and p o s t v e l a r s . In spite of its f a u l t s , however, this grammar shows an understanding of certain aspects of Aymara usually overlooked such as the fact that certain suffixes are essential to the Aymara sentence, and although given to stating general rules to which exceptions must then be m a d e , Ebbing at least inc l u d e s the e x c e p t i o n s , m a k i n g up in a c c u r a c y of data for loss of e c o n o m y in p r e s e n t a t i o n . As a h a n d b o o k for studying A y m a r a , his g r a m m a r is useful as a source of Aymara glosses of individual Spanish forms. Translations of Spanish sentences should be checked with Aymara native s p e a k e r s , h o w e v e r , as they a r e w r i t t e n in a s t y l e a s s o ciated with Catholic priests (for examples see Chapter 9).
The nadir in p r e l i n g u i s t i c g r a m m a r s of Aymara was r e a c h e d in Suma lajjra aymara parlana ( 1 9 6 9 ) by Erasmo T a r i f a A s c a r r u n z . A n o t h e r e x a m p l e of Patr<5n A y m a r a , this book contains a wealth of m a t e r i a l , but so badly

62

analyzed and presented as to be very difficult to use. As u s u a l in p r e l i n g u i s t i c g r a m m a r s , t h e A y m a r a s o u n d s as if it were translated from Spanish. On the other hand, the Spanish translations of the Aymara (or Spanish s e n t e n c e s from w h i c h the A y m a r a was t r a n s l a t e d ) are in the popular Spanish of the Andean area which reflects Aymara s t r u c t u r e to a c o n s i d e r a b l e e x t e n t even in the usage of m o n o l i n g u a l Spanish s p e a k e r s . In a l l , the book is an interesting c o m p e n d i u m of fact and m i s c o n c e p t i o n which should be checked with native speakers before any of its contents are accepted as valid.

Linguistic Studies Synchronic studies

As far as I am a w a r e , the first linguist to note in print that Aymara has a three- rather than a five-vowel system was Bertil Malmberg (1947-48). Kenneth P i k e , in his P h o n e m i c s (1947:1 5 3 ) , included an Aymara problem with data that clearly implied a three-vowel system, although Pike left this conclusion to the reader. Tschopik (1948) and LaBarre (1950) provided partially phonemic renditions of Aymara folktales with English translations but without grammatical analysis. Although transcribed with five vowels and no indication of vowel length or of syntactic final vowel dropping, the texts

63

appear to be otherwise phonologically accurate native

Aymara. (The informants are identified as monolingual.)

These texts are useful for the dialectal variants they

contain and for comparison with present-day dialects

from the same areas for the purpose of identifying changes

during the past 30 years.

The first morphological analysis of Aymara was

made by Thomas Sebeok (1951a).

H o w e v e r , it was

based on an Aymara version of Little Red Ridinghood

translated from S p a n i s h , rather than on a native Aymara

folktale, and the text is an example of Patrdn Aymara.

Sebeok (1951b) also collected data for an Aymara diction-

ary, using data from Tschopik, LaBarre, Villamor, Pike,

and Floyd Lounsbury as well as his own. Each entry

consists of a set of Aymara words sharing the same root

m o r p h e m e , with E n g l i s h (or in the case of V i l l a m o r ' s

data, Spanish) translations.

2-4.11 Missionary grammars and associated studies

The first attempt at a fairly complete grammatical description of Aymara by a linguist using the methods of modern scholarship was made by Ellen M. Ross, whose Rudimentos de gram^tica aymara (1953; second edition 1 9 6 3 ) was p u b l i s h e d by the C a n a d i a n B a p t i s t M i s s i o n in La Paz with an introduction by Eugene N i d a . The preface indicates that the Aymara of Huatajata (department of

64
La Paz) is the dialect on which the grammar is based and that it is similar to that of the city of La Paz. Three A y m a r a n a t i v e s p e a k e r s c o l l a b o r a t e d w i t h Ross in p r o d u c i n g the grammar, a trilingual textbook for English-speaking missionaries and Spanish speakers. Making use of aural/ oral language-teaching methods, the book presents graded Aymara dialogues and drills with translations into Spanish and g r a m m a t i c a l e x p l a n a t i o n s in S p a n i s h and E n g l i s h . The grammar includes cultural notes such as a comment on the importance of greetings among the Aymara. While it has an index of grammatical forms and topics (in S p a n i s h ) , it lacks a table of contents and thus cannot easily be used as a reference grammar.
In any c a s e , a l t h o u g h it r e p r e s e n t s a t r e m e n d o u s improvement over its predecessors, Rudimentos contains frequently inaccurate grammatical analyses. More import a n t , the t e x t still r e f l e c t s , in the t r a d i t i o n of e a r l i e r Aymara g r a m m a r s , the usage of m i s s i o n a r i e s and their followers. For this reason the Ross grammar should be used with caution by persons not wishing to be identified with or as missionaries. Also, the CALA writing system used presents the learner with certain difficulties, especially w i t h r e s p e c t to t h e p o s t v e l a r f r i c a t i v e s y m b o l i z e d as jj_ and reduplicated as the unwieldy and confusing cluster jjJj •

65
A reference grammar for native speakers of Aymara is Ross's Manual aymara para los aymaristas (n.d. [considerably after Ross 1953]). Its purpose is to enable Aymara s p e a k e r s a l r e a d y bilingual and l i t e r a t e in S p a n i s h to learn to read and write Aymara and to become aware of differences between Aymara and Spanish structure which create difficulties for Aymara monolinguals wishing to learn Spanish. As indicated earlier, the CALA writing system used by Ross is designed to familiarize Aymara speakers with Spanish spelling with a view to facilitating t h e i r learning to read and w r i t e in that l a n g u a g e . Accordingly, Spanish loans, even those which entered Aymara hundreds of years ago and are completely adapted to Aymara phonology, are spelled as Spanish and the five vowels of Spanish are used even though Ross recognized that Aymara has a three-vowel system. Evidence that the CALA a l p h a b e t does in f a c t a c c o m p l i s h the o b j e c t i v e of making it easier for Aymara monolinguals to learn S p a n i s h is l a c k i n g .
The Ross M a n u a l is in e f f e c t a c o n t r a s t i v e s t u d y of Spanish and (Missionary) Aymara, often describing A y m a r a in t e r m s of S p a n i s h , a l t h o u g h t h i s is w a r n e d against (n.d.:65). The manual is also p r e s c r i p t i v e , for e x a m p l e in L e s s o n IX on p u n c t u a t i o n . The g r a m m a t i c a l a n a l y s i s is lacking in some important r e s p e c t s ; for i n s t a n c e , the four-person system is not completely

66
understood. The distinction of personal and nonpersonal k n o w l e d g e is r e c o g n i z e d , h o w e v e r , for the f i r s t t i m e . The importance of morphemic vowel length and morphophonemic vowel dropping is also understood and the reader is urged to write as he s p e a k s , although this injunction is not always followed in the examples given in the text. The role of sentence suffixes (called e n c l i t i c s ) is well covered. But while the Manual has its strengths, nevertheless the message conveyed by the book is that learning to read and write Aymara is merely a means toward learning to be f u l l y l i t e r a t e in S p a n i s h and n o t a w o r t h y end in i t s e l f . This a t t i t u d e is clear in a d i s c u s s i o n of the e m b e d d i n g of d i r e c t q u o t e s in A y m a r a : the r e a d e r who wishes to write a more involved style is urged to consult a good Spanish grammar or to observe the style of writers in that language (Ross n . d . : 1 2 1 ) .
Two subsequent teaching grammars of Aymara owe much to Ross. Paul Wexler and his associates attempted in B e g i n n i n g A y m a r a : A course for English speakers (1967) to write a linguistically sound pedagogical grammar of Aymara specifically for English speakers. Intended for Peace Corps volunteers, this grammar was based on research c a r r i e d o u t in B o l i v i a by t h r e e A m e r i c a n f i e l d w o r k e r s who spent a short time there aided by three Aymara native s p e a k e r s from La Paz w h o were b i l i n g u a l in S p a n i s h . It is of value primarily as an example of what happens when

67
linguistic researchers fail to take cultural as well as linguistic factors into account in spite of their obvious i m p o r t a n c e in a g r a m m a r d e s i g n e d for f o r e i g n e r s p r o p o s i n g to live and work in an u n f a m i l i a r s o c i e t y . While carefully organized into graded dialogues and drills on topics generally r e l e v a n t to altiplano l i f e , the Aymara sentences in the book sound t r a n s l a t e d f r o m S p a n i s h , o f t e n u s i n g missionary and/or patrdn terminology, and are therefore both culturally and linguistically unacceptable to some native speakers. Wexler recognized that the Aymara of the informants probably showed heavy Spanish influence, but he was e v i d e n t l y unaware of the social dimension of their d i a l e c t - - i t s evangelical cast--although he did recommend further research with monolingual speakers. The book also suffers from problems of translating Andean Spanish into English. For example, wank'u (Wexler w a n e ' u) is translated 'rabbit' instead of 'guinea p i g ' , probably because the Andean Spanish for guinea pig is conejo (Peninsular Spanish 'rabbit').
The second Aymara grammar owing much to Ross, and the best of the m i s s i o n a r y grammars to d a t e , is Lecciones de Aymara (1971-72) by Joaquin Herrero, Daniel C o t a r i , and Jaime M e j f a , said to be based on a dialect from roughly the same area as that of the Ross g r a m m a r s . Herrero is a native of S p a i n ; Cotari and Mejfa are Bolivian Aymara speakers bilingual in S p a n i s h .

68

Developed for use at the Maryknoll Language Institute

in C o c h a b a m b a , this g r a m m a r is s u p e r i o r to its predeces-

sors in grammatical a n a l y s i s , but it has the same charac-

teristics perceived by some native speakers as non-Aymara

or substandard. An innovation useful for students of

Spanish dialects is the provision of two translations of

each Aymara d i a l o g u e , one in Andean Spanish and the other

in P e n i n s u l a r S p a n i s h .

The a l p h a b e t used by Herrero et a l . is that

a d o p t e d by the B o l i v i a n g o v e r n m e n t in 1 9 5 4 . It d i f f e r s

f r o m t h e C A L A a l p h a b e t o n l y in its u s e of J< a n d c[ f o r

the velar and postvelar stops, respectively, instead

of the CALA £ and

f o r v e l a r a n d J< f o r p o s t v e l a r . T h e

phonology section includes numerous minimal triplets

illustrating plain, aspirated, and glottalized stops.

The importance of m o r p h o p h o n e m i c vowel dropping is c l e a r l y

grasped and suffixes are designated as weak (retaining

previous vowel) and strong (dropping previous vowel) when

they are first introduced, helping the learner to produce

correct forms from the b e g i n n i n g . The book is good on

the Aymara four-person system (while not calling it that),

avoiding Ross's error, repeated by Wexler, of designating

the inclusive fourth person as dual. Full verbal inflec-

tional paradigms with affirmative and negative examples

are p r e s e n t e d in the body of the t e x t .

69
A much s h o r t e r , less complete grammar is Mgtodo de aymara (1973) by Marcelo Grondin, using the same alphabet as Herrero. Published in O r u r o , the book mentions c e r t a i n forms as d i f f e r e n t f r o m t h o s e o c c u r r i n g in La Paz but fails to include the distinctive allomorph of the first person p o s s e s s i v e suffix (with velar n a s a l ) found in the province of Carangas, Oruro. The Aymara four-person system is c l e a r l y g r a s p e d , v o w e l - d r o p p i n g is u n d e r s t o o d , and the role of sentence suffixes n o t e d , but the Aymara is presented in short d i a l o g u e s that sound n o n n a t i v e . The transl a t i o n s of the d i a l o g u e s a r e irr A n d e a n S p a n i s h .
The question arises why grammars of Aymara continued for so long to reflect only missionary and patrdn u s a g e s . The answer lies in the fact that for many years all l i n g u i s t s w h o u n d e r t o o k to s t u d y A y m a r a in d e p t h w e r e m i s s i o n a r i e s w h o , h o w e v e r well p r e p a r e d in l i n g u i s t i c field methods, were more concerned with translating S c r i p t u r e from Spanish or English into Aymara than in eliciting native texts on which to base a d e s c r i p t i o n of the language. Their informants, being members of the same religious community, were ready to accept the missionaries' a u t h o r i t y in m a t t e r s of style and c o n t e n t . Many m i s s i o n a r y l i n g u i s t s , n o t a b l y N i d a (1 9 5 7 : 5 8 - 6 0 ) , a r e a w a r e of t h e l i n g u i s t i c p i t f a l l s i n h e r e n t in their a p p r o a c h and try to avoid them; but it is unrealistic to expect m i s s i o n a r y grammars to be completely free of the distorting influence of translation.

70
The few nonmissionary linguists who approached Aymara did so either through missionaries or through m e s t i z o s and w h i t e s . In such c i r c u m s t a n c e s it is remarkable that Tschopik and LaBarre were able to elicit native Aymara folktales free of missionary or patrdn influence. Sebeok was not so f o r t u n a t e ; the story on w h i c h he b a s e d his m o r p h o l o g i c a l a n a l y s i s is in P a t r d n Aymara. When the Wexler team sought to study Aymara they proceeded through missionary contacts and thereby unwitt i n g l y a c q u i r e d i n f o r m a n t s t r a i n e d in that t r a d i t i o n .
So long as all linguistic research was conducted with sources speaking varieties of Missionary or Patrdn A y m a r a , only data reflecting such dialects could be obtained. A new point of entry into the Aymara community was needed.
2-4.12 Aymara-centered studies
In 1965 M . J . H a r d m a n a r r i v e d in B o l i v i a as a F u l b r i g h t l e c t u r e r in l i n g u i s t i c s . T o g e t h e r w i t h J u l i a Elena F o r t d n , Director of A n t h r o p o l o g y in the Bolivian Ministry of Education, Hardman founded the Instituto N a c i o n a l de E s t u d i o s L i n g u i s t i c o s ( I N E L ) in La Paz for the p u r p o s e of t r a i n i n g B o l i v i a n s in l i n g u i s t i c s for national development. Hardman had already investigated Aymara's sister languages, Jaqaru and Kawki, and had determined their relationship as members of the Jaqi

71
language family. Hardman's Jaqaru: Outline of phonological and morphological structure (1966) is the first grammar of a Jaqi l a n g u a g e d e s c r i b e d in its own terms rather than from the p o i n t of v i e w of S p a n i s h . A s e c o n d e d i t i o n in S p a n i s h t r a n s l a t i o n is now in press in P e r u . ( P r e - H a r d m a n Peruvian sources for the study of Jaqaru and Kawki are the w r i t i n g s of J . M . B. Farfcin and of Jos£ M a t o s M a r . )
One of H a r d m a n ' s s t u d e n t s at INEL in La Paz was Juan de Dios Yapita, a native speaker of Aymara from the community of Compi on the shores of Lake Titicaca. Yapita had been educated in La Paz but m a i n t a i n e d close ties with m o n o l i n g u a l f r i e n d s and r e l a t i v e s in C o m p i . As the outcome of an a s s i g n m e n t , Yapita wrote the first phonemic alphabet of Aymara ever produced by a native speaker of the language and later, together with Herminia Martfn and others studying under Hardman's direction, did field work in the p r o v i n c e s of I n g a v i , P a c a j e s , A n d e s , O m a s u y o s , and Manco C a p a c , d e p a r t m e n t of La P a z . H a r d m a n also did field work in the province of L a r e c a j a . The first published result of this research was Martin's Bosquejo de e s t r u c t u r a de la lengua aymara ( 1 9 6 9 ) , a brief sketch of the A y m a r a spoken in the town of Irpa C h i c o , p r o v i n c e of Ingavi. It is important as the first published description of Aymara by a linguist for linguists, combining both adequate theory and competent field investigation.

72
On the basis of Aymara research undertaken by H a r d m a n and a s s o c i a t e s in B o l i v i a , the A y m a r a L a n g u a g e M a t e r i a l s Project began at the U n i v e r s i t y of Florida in 1969 with support from the U. S. Office of Education of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The goal of the project was to produce teaching and reference grammars of Aymara reflecting linguistic and cultural realities of the language from the point of view of native speakers. The materials were prepared by a team consisting of Hardman, two Bolivian native speakers of Aymara trained in linguistics and anthropology (Yapita and Juana V S s q u e z , who is from T i a h u a n a c o ) , and three g r a d u a t e s t u d e n t s in a n t h r o p o l o g y and l i n g u i s t i c s who assisted with the analysis and tested the teaching m a t e r i a l s in A y m a r a c l a s s e s . T h e i r w o r k was s u p p l e m e n t e d by extensive help from a number of other native speakers of Aymara as well as from other University of Florida graduate students and staff.
The primary fruit of the project is a three-volume work by Hardman, Vcisquez, and Yapita entitled Aymar ar y a t i q a n a t a k i ('to learn A y m a r a ' ) w h i c h a p p e a r e d f i r s t in 1973 and in a revised edition in 1975. Volume 1 , which bears the title of the w h o l e w o r k , is a course in A y m a r a for English and Spanish speakers, consisting of graded dialogues based on rural Aymara life and drills based on the dialogues, with translations into both Spanish and

73
English and accompanying tape recordings with English translations. Volume 2, Teacher's manual to accompany Aymar ar yatiqariataki, is keyed to the course and provides cultural as well as grammatical explanations. Volume 3, entitled Aymara grammatical sketch in the first edition (1973) and Outline of Aymara phonological and grammatical structure in the second (1975), is a detailed reference grammar which may stand alone. It incorporates University of Florida master's theses by Laura Martin-Barber on phonology and by Nora C. England on verbal derivational suffixes, and my term paper on the structure of the substantive system, as Chapters 3, 6, and 8, respectively. The project has also produced a computerized concordance glossary of words, roots, and suffixes.
Secondary results of the project include numerous student papers for g r a d u a t e courses in a n t h r o p o l o g y and linguistics at the University of Florida, for example Norman Tate's ethnosemantic study of verbs of carrying ( 1970) and a paper by Andrew Miracle and Juana Vcisquez on e t h n o s e m a n t i c c a t e g o r i e s of feces in Aymara (1972). Published articles related to the project include Hardman's on Aymara and Jaqi linguistic postulates (Hardman 1972a and in p r e s s a ) , Y a p i t a ' s d i s c u s s i o n of the role of l i n g u i s t i c s in B o l i v i a n national d e v e l o p m e n t ( 1 9 7 3 b ) , and Pedro Copana's recommendations concerning the education of rural Aymara children (1973).

An i n c r e a s i n g n u m b e r of m a t e r i a l s w r i t t e n in the Aymara language have appeared as a result of the project. The Aymara Newsletter has been published irregularly at the University of Florida since 1970, originally under the alternating editorships of Yapita and VSsquez, who also collaborated on a correspondence course for Aymara speakers (Vcisquez & Yapita 1 969). Vcisquez has written an Aymara primer (1970) and is preparing another. Yapita has edited several mimeographed Aymara literary journals, among them Yatinasawa (1970) and Literatura aymara (1972-73). He has also produced materials for teaching his p h o n e m i c a l p h a b e t in Bolivia (1973a)and a S p a n i s h English-Aymara vocabulary (1974).
Former Yapita students who are members of the Bolivian Aymara community have produced materials of their own. Representative are articles by Vitaliano Wanka Torres, describing results of the Aymara literacy program he d i r e c t s in T i a h u a n a c o (Wanka 1973a and 1 9 7 3 b ) ; an Aymara primer for adults (1974) by Francisco Calle P., of which a first edition of 17,000 was printed (Chaski 2:1974); and a bilingual manual on medicinal plants and herbs (1974) by Gabino Kispi H. (Wanka and Kispi spell their s u r n a m e s , t r a d i t i o n a l l y Huanca and Q u i s p e , in Yapita orthography.)
So far, lack of funds has precluded formal publication of more than a few of the Aymara-centered m a t e r i a l s t h a t have begun to a p p e a r in g r o w i n g n u m b e r s .

2-4.13 Socio!inguistic studies
In Peru the g o v e r n m e n t has in r e c e n t y e a r s s o u g h t the participation of missionary linguists associated with the Summer Institute of Linguistics and of secular linguists from a c a d e m i c i n s t i t u t i o n s in the d e v e l o p m e n t of educational programs for speakers of indigenous languages (loosely referred to as bilingual education programs). W h i l e m o s t p u b l i c a t i o n s on p r o b l e m s of m u l t i 1 i n g u a l i s m in Peru focus on Q u e c h u a and the j u n g l e l a n g u a g e s r a t h e r than on Aymara, several recent studies include references to A y m a r a . As noted in 1 - 1 , the two m o s t r e c e n t P e r u v i a n national censuses (for 1961 and 1972) contain basic demographic data on the numbers and location of Aymara speakers in P e r u . The p r o c e e d i n g s of a round t a b l e on p r o b l e m s of Quechua and Aymara m o n o l i n g u a l i s m held in 1963 have b e e n p u b l i s h e d in M e s a r e d o n d a s o b r e el m o n o ! ingiii s m o q u e c h u a y aymara y la e d u c a c i 6 n en el Perd ( 1 9 6 6 ) . One of the participants in the round table was Alberto Escobar, a Peruvian linguist who later founded the government- and Ford Foundation-supported Plan de Fomento Lingufstico (linguistic development plan) at the National U n i v e r s i t y of San M a r c o s in Lima and w h o has w r i t t e n several thoughtful essays on the language problems of Peru such as an article on literacy programs (Escobar 1972a). Escobar edited a collection of articles entitled El reto del mu 1 ti 1 ingiiismo en el Perd w h i c h a p p e a r e d in

76
1972, the year the Peruvian government inaugurated a new policy of bilingual education. The book includes articles by Hardman on Aymara linguistic postulates (Hardman 1972a), by Alfredo Torero on historical background (Torero 1 9 7 2 b ) , and by Escobar on linguistics and politics (Escobar 1972b).
Domingo Llanque C h a n a , a Peruvian Aymara who is a Maryknoll priest and at present (1976) vicar general of the Prelature of Juli, has presented in Spanish translation an i n t e r v i e w he c o n d u c t e d in Aymara with a 56-yearold Aymara man from a rural community near Lake Titicaca (D. Llanque Chana 1973). The topic is social interaction among the Aymara, including the way they treat outsiders as well as each o t h e r . To my knowledge this is the first time the topic has been d i s c u s s e d in p r i n t by an A y m a r a . The author observes that the basic element of Aymara interaction is mutual respect expressed primarily through c o u r t e o u s speech as e x e m p l i f i e d in g r e e t i n g s .
A g r a d u a t e of a normal school in P u n o , J u s t i n o Llanque Chana, has given an overview of the educational situation of Peruvian Aymara based on the results of his 1973 survey of 85 high school students in the town of Chucuito near Puno (J. Llanque Chana 1974). The survey revealed negative attitudes toward Aymara language and culture which the author interpreted as confirming the alienating effects of an educational system stressing acquisition of Spanish skills while banning (in theory if not in s t r i c t p r a c t i c e ) the use of v e r n a c u l a r l a n g u a g e s .

77
M e a n w h i l e in B o l i v i a , w h e r e the g o v e r n m e n t has y e t to give formal support to bilingual education, only one organization has so far as I know published materials relevant to sociolinguistics: the Centro Pedagdgico y Cultural de Portales in C o c h a b a m b a , which is supported by the P a t i n o F o u n d a t i o n . In c o n n e c t i o n w i t h a s e r i e s of educational conferences and seminars for Aymara and Quechua s p e a k e r s , P o r t a l e s (as it is u s u a l l y c a l l e d ) began in 1973 to publish in m i m e o g r a p h e d form such m a t e r i a l s as articles by Javier Albd on the future of Aymara and Quechua (which he considers to be 'oppressed languages'; Albd 1973a) and on Aymara and Quechua educational radio programs in Bolivia (Albd 1 9 7 3 b ) . Also in 1973 Portales published the Yapita phonemic a l p h a b e t and in 1 9 7 4 , my article on the Aymara four-person system (Briggs 1974a) and a summary of Hardman's article on Aymara linguistic postulates (Hardman 1972a).
Portales has also assi sted sociolinguistic surv e y s . In 1973 and 1 9 7 4 , Yapita and Pedro P l a z a , the director of INEL, conducted with Portales and Ford Foundation support sociolinguistic surveys of groups of Aymara and Quechua speakers in Bolivia using m e t h o d s d e v e l o p e d by Wolfgang Wolck for Quechua in Peru (Wolck 1972 and 1973).
A valid contribution to knowledge of the Aymaraspeaking population of northern Potosf department is an

78

article by the British anthropologist Olivia Harris (1974) on the Laymis and Machas (1-1.1).
2-4.2 Historical studies
Torero set forth well-grounded theories as to the history of Aymara and its sister languages (1-2.1) in an a r t i c l e e n t i t l e d Lingiiistica e h i s t o r i a de los Andes del Perd y de Bolivia ( 1 9 7 2 b ) . The relationsihi p of Aymara and Quechua, the other major language family of the Andean a r e a , is still a m a t t e r of d e b a t e . Mason (1950:196) proposed 'Kechumaran' as a term 'to designate the yet unproved but highly probable subphylum consisting of Quechua and Aymara.' Also supporting a fairly close relationship between Quechua and Aymara are Carolyn Orr and Robert E. Longacre (1968) and Yolanda Lastra de S u a r e z ( 1 9 7 0 ) . H a r d m a n a s c r i b e s s i m i l a r i t i e s in lexicon and phonology, where they exist, to geographic proximity and overlap rather than to a genetic relationship (Hardman, personal communication). Louisa Stark ( 1 9 7 0 ) has p r o v i d e d c o n v i n c i n g d a t a in s u p p o r t of H a r d man's position.

Summary and Projection

The foregoing survey of representative literature on and in Aymara shows how s c h o l a r l y and

79
not-so-scholarly treatment of the language has changed in a c c o r d a n c e with the focus of each period and the development of more adequate method and theory. While the p r o d u c t i o n of w r i t t e n texts in Aymara is still m e a g e r , it is i n c r e a s i n g . Like the spoken l a n g u a g e on which they are based, these texts show dialectal variation, and they will provide material for further dialect studies as well as investigations of literary style.

V A R I A T I O N IN P H O N O L O G Y A N D IN PHONOLOGICAL SHAPE OF MORPHEMES

3-1

Introduction

The basic phonology of Aymara has been described by L. Martin-Barber (Hardma,n et al. 1 9 7 5 : 3 , Chapter 3). To the phonemic inventory therein described must now be added the velar n a s a l , although it is of limited occurr e n c e . V a r i a t i o n s in p h o n o l o g i c a l s h a p e of m o r p h e m e s both within and across dialects are paralleled by morphophonemic rules operating within d i a l e c t s , to be discussed in C h a p t e r 4 , to which this chapter is an i n t r o d u c t i o n .

Voiced consonants are two laterals, four nasals, two g l i d e s , and a f l a p . The stops occur in f o u r p o s i t i o n s of articulation and three manners: plain, aspirated, and glottalized. The three affricates are all palatal and pattern with the stops. The three fricatives are alveolar, velar, and postvelar. The laterals are alveo-

lar and palatal; the glides are bilabial and palatal; the f l a p , w h i c h may be realized as a t r i l l , is a l v e o l a r .
Included in the total of four n a s a l s is the v e l a r n a s a l / n h / ([ rj ] ) , a p h o n e m e in t h e r e l a t e d l a n g u a g e J a q a r u . The velar nasal has p h o n e m i c s t a t u s in only two A y m a r a d i a l e c t s e n c o u n t e r e d to d a t e , in the p r o v i n c e s of Carangas (Oruro, Bolivia) and Tarata (Tacna, Peru), s p e c i f i c a l l y in the c o m m u n i t i e s of J o p o q u e r i and Corque (Carangas) and of Tarata and Sitajara (Tarata). Although the phoneme occurs in few m o r p h e m e s , these have a high f u n c t i o n a l l o a d . In both C a r a n g a s and Tarata the p h o n e m e occurs in h o m o p h o n o u s a l l o m o r p h s of two s u f f i x e s : /-nha/ first person possessive and /-nha/ verbal inflection of f i r s t to t h i r d p e r s o n , F u t u r e t e n s e . In T a r a t a the p h o n e m e o c c u r s in two m o r e s u f f i x e s of the F u t u r e tense (see F i g u r e 6 - 3 ) and in at least two noun r o o t s : anhanu 'cheek' and panhara 'grinder.'
The two areas where the velar nasal phoneme occurs are separated by the province of Pacajes, department of La P a z , whose dialects were not investigated d i r e c t l y for

83
this s t u d y . The p h o n e m e was not found in the P a c a j e s d i a l e c t s i n v e s t i g a t e d in the r e s e a r c h for H a r d m a n et al. ( 1 9 7 5 ) . Late in the r e s e a r c h for the p r e s e n t s t u d y , evidence was obtained for the existence of a relic of the /nh/ p h o n e m e in La Paz/Compi d i a l e c t , in one w o r d : the noun ch'inhi 'nit' (Spanish 1iendre). This contrasts with intervocalic /n/ and /n/ (e. g. ch' ina 'human posterior' and nunu 'breast, teat'). Another apparent relic of /nh/ is a velarized a l l o p h o n e of /n/ occurring in M o r o c o m a r c a ( 4 - 3 . 2 1 . 2 ) . It may p o s s i b l y also occur
3 in other Aymara d i a l e c t s not y e t i n v e s t i g a t e d .
3-2.2 Al1ophones The allophones described by L. Martin-Barber
(Hardman et al. 1975:3) exist for the dialects of Aymara investigated for this study. The following additional comments may be m a d e . 3-2.21 Vowels
In S p a n i s h - i n f l u e n c e d d i a l e c t s the mid vowel /a/ may a p p r o x i m a t e Spanish /a/ but in m o n o l i n g u a l Aymara (and some n o n m o n o l i n g u a 1 d i a l e c t s , for e x a m p l e in n o r t h e r n P o t o s f , a trilingual Q u e c h u a - A y m a r a - S p a n i s h area) /a/ is more closed, being realized frequently as [ A ] or [ A ] . /i/ and / u / , as noted by L. M a r t i n - B a r b e r , are lowered in the e n v i r o n m e n t of postvelar c o n s o n a n t s /q/ and /x/

84
and raised in the environment of /n/ and /y/ and wordinitially. Elsewhere intermediate or high allophones o c c u r . Additional study will be needed to determine the conditioning.
3-2.22 Consonants
M o s t a l l o p h o n i c v a r i a t i o n of c o n s o n a n t s in A y m a r a is m o r p h o p h o n e m i c a l l y c o n d i t i o n e d , and is t h e r e f o r e disc u s s e d in C h a p t e r 4 .
Friction attending the velar and postvelar fricatives /j/ and /x/ and the flap /r/ is variable but whether the v a r i a t i o n is d i a l e c t a l , s t y l i s t i c , or i d i o s y n c r a t i c is y e t to be d e t e r m i n e d . Impressionistically it was noted that some Juli speakers pronounced initial /j/ with heavy f r i c t i o n w h e r e a s in o t h e r d i a l e c t s initial /j/ is more often a glottal [h]. Dialects having /j/ (Salinas, J o p o q u e r i ) w h e r e La Paz and other d i a l e c t s have / k / , for e x a m p l e in the i n c o m p l e t i v e verbal d e r i v a t i o n a l s u f f i x -j a- ~ - k a - , articulate a somewhat prevelar, palatalized /j/ and a clearly postvelar / x / . The difference is quite n o t i c e a b l e even to a n o n n a t i v e in such pairs as
Chur.j.t.wa. 'I'm giving it to him/her/them.'
C h u r . x . t . w a . 'I g a v e it to h i m / h e r / t h e m . ' ( J o p o q u e r i )
(The second example has the verbal derivational suffix

85

-xa- completive.) The amount of friction attending both /j/ and /x/ in those dialects seems i m p r e s s i o n i s t i c a l l y about the same; it is the relative fronting and backing w h i c h is d i s t i n c t i v e , as in the case of Aymara v o w e l s . The f r o n t and back v o w e l s lower in the e n v i r o n m e n t of postvelar consonants by assimilation, thereby assisting the n o n n a t i v e s p e a k e r of A y m a r a in d i s t i n g u i s h i n g the velar and postvelar consonants. Examples:

ik.i [ik~]

'he/she/it/they sleep(s)' (all dialects)

iqigu [eqeqo] "mischievous spirit1 (all dialects)

sar.j.i [sarj~ ~ sarx~] 'it rusted' (La Paz)

86

In the r e l a t e d l a n g u a g e Jaqaru the v e l a r and postvelar fricatives are allophones of the same phoneme ( H a r d m a n 1 9 6 6 ) . T h e i r d i s t i n c t p h o n e m i c s t a t u s in A y m a r a is a t t e s t e d by the m i n i m a l p a i r s c i t e d a b o v e . In c e r t a i n dialects, however, there are cases of one morpheme having variants with both the velar and postvelar fricative, which may indicate that the distinction between the two is n e u t r a l i z e d in those m o r p h e m e s or that the p h o n e m i c split into /j/ and /x/ is still underway in A y m a r a , having y e t to occur in c e r t a i n m o r p h e m e s .

3-2.3 Canonical forms

These do not vary dialectically. As noted by L. Martin-Barber (Hardman et al. 1975:3.69-70) most roots have the canonical form CVCV(CV); another productive form is CVCCV with a reduplicative subclass of the form

C1V1C2C1VT

C V ( C V ) , V C V , N o u n s u f f i x e s a r e o f t h e f o r m

or C ^ C 2 V (C-| n a s a l , C 2 s t o p ) e x c e p t f o r t h e v e r b a l i z e r -pta- w h i c h is u n i q u e among the noun s u f f i x e s in that it

consists of two stops followed by a v o w e l . Verbal deri-

vational suffixes have the shape C-|V((C2)V) except for a f e w C-j C 2 V in w h i c h C-j is a n a s a l a n d o n e C - | C 2 V ( C 3 ) V ,

-rpaya ~ -rpa: (VV = V:). Verbal inflectional s u f f i x e s ,

except for the Simple and to an extent the Future tense,

which have suffixes of the form (C)V and C-jVC(V), are

more complex, containing recurrent submorphemic partials

87

(see 6-3.2). Nonfinal independent suffixes (7-2.21) and final sentence suffixes (7-2.22) are of the form CV(CV). Verb subordinating suffixes (7-4.2) take the form ( V ) C V ( C V ) in which the first V , if a n y , is / i / .

Evidence for the nonexistence of r o o t s w i t h / n h / in C a r a n g a s , w h e r e s u f f i x e s with the phoneme do o c c u r , is the pronunciation given by a speaker from Jopoqueri to the following Jaqaru

That is, the speaker did not pronounce the velar nasal i n t e r v o c a l i c a l l y in the two (to him) n o n s e n s e words given above but rather inserted a voiced velar [g] after the velar n a s a l , as did o t h e r s p e a k e r s b i l i n g u a l in S p a n i s h (as he w a s ) who had no velar nasal p h o n e m e in their dial e c t s . B e l o w are shown J a q a r u - A y m a r a c o g n a t e s in w h i c h the Jaqaru has /nh/ while the Aymara (also of Jopoqueri) has /nq"/, /n/, /y/, or /yn/.

3-2.42 Phoneme sequences Germinate (reduplicated) vowels may occur as
vowel length, but sequences of different vowels

89

(diphthongs) do not occur. Vowel-glide and glide-vowel sequences do occur; the former are phonetically (but not phonemically) diphthongs. As noted above, twoc o n s o n a n t c l u s t e r s o c c u r m e d i a l l y in r o o t s and i n i t i a l l y in some s u f f i x e s . The f i r s t c o n s o n a n t is u s u a l l y not a
4
stop, while the second usually is. Clusters of two or more consonants may occur
w o r d - m e d i a l l y in all d i a l e c t s as the r e s u l t of s u f f i x a tion accompanied by obligatory morphophonemic voweldeletion. Such clusters may also occur word-initially or - f i n a l l y in certain d i a l e c t s under certain conditions (see 4-3.12.1, 4-3.32, and 6-4).

In all d i a l e c t s s t r e s s o c c u r s n o n p h o n e m i c a l l y on the penultimate vowel of a word having more than one v o w e l . (A word in Aymara m a y be d e f i n e d as a free form having at least one vowel, that is, a root, stem, or t h e m e . ) Stress may appear to fall on a final vowel if the

final vowel is long.

Stress may also appear to fall on the final syllable if after stress placement has occurred, the final vowel of the word is devoiced or d r o p p e d .

Intonation

No a t t e m p t was m a d e in this study to a s s e s s variation in intonation p a t t e r n s . Certain m o r p h e m e s and s y n t a c t i c u n i t s in all d i a l e c t s c a r r y i n t o n a t i o n p a t t e r n s t h a t a p p e a r to a d h e r e to them in all or a l m o s t all e n v i r o n ments. Impressionistically the range of intonation levels a p p e a r s f l a t t e r in La Paz than in d i a l e c t s d i s t a n t from the c a p i t a l . O t h e r w i s e , d i f f e r e n c e s in i n t o n a t i o n seem to be primarily stylistic, but further study of the patterning is needed before d e f i n i t e s t a t e m e n t s of conditioning may be made.

3-3.3 Spanish loans

Spanish loans have entered and continue to enter A y m a r a , e s p e c i a l l y in urban a r e a s . L. M a r t i n - B a r b e r has

91

described adaptation of Spanish loans to Aymara phonology (Hardman et al. 1 9 7 5 : 3 . 8 1 - 8 8 ) . Depending on the extent of the speaker's knowledge of Spanish phonology, such loans may be more or less 'Aymarized'. As will be noted in e x a m p l e s in o t h e r c h a p t e r s , c e r t a i n s p e a k e r s incorporate Spanish loans that preserve some Spanish phonemes (for example /b/ or /g/) while other speakers adapt such loans to Aymara phonology. The whole process of entry of Spanish loans into Aymara merits a study of its own taking into account sociocultural factors. (See Chapter 9 for a discussion of heavily Spanish-influenced Aymara dialects. Aymara influence on Bolivian altiplano Spanish is now being investigated by H. Martfn and Laprade.)

Phonological Correspondences Within and Across

Dialects

One morpheme (the base form) may have a slightly d i f f e r e n t p h o n e m i c s h a p e in one d i a l e c t (or i d i o l e c t ) than in another. Usually differences of one or two phonemes are involved. Some phonological correspondences within or across dialects parallel morphophonemic variation within certain dialects: the rules that change one p h o n e m e to a n o t h e r or d e l e t e or retain p h o n e m e s in certain morphemes in certain e n v i r o n m e n t s . These m o r p h o p h o n e m i c rules are d i s c u s s e d in C h a p t e r 4 .

92

The dialectal phonological correspondences to be discussed here will be treated by type of phoneme (vowels, c o n s o n a n t s ) and by morphological class of the m o r p h e m e s in which they o c c u r . The tilde (~) will be used between phonemes that correspond intra- or crossd i a l e c t a l l y , and between forms which are in free variation within a dialect.

3-4.32 Correspondences of nonstop consonants and vowel 1ength

Correspondences of nonstop consonants and vowel length occur in initial position in three s u f f i x e s , all of very frequent occurrence: the lp possessive noun suffix (5-3.24), the 1+3 Future verbal inflectional suffix (Figure 6-3), and the attenuator/topic final suffix (7-2.22.12). The lp possessive and 1+3 F suffixes have correspondences of velar and postvelar fricatives, palatal and velar nasals, palatal glide, and vowel length. The palatal lateral o c c u r s i n i t i a l l y in the lp p o s s e s s i v e a l l o m o r p h of one d i a l e c t ( V i t o c o t a ) . In all d i a l e c t s vowel length occurs as an allomorph of 1+3 F; vowel length as an a l l o m o r p h of lp p o s s e s s i v e o c c u r s in only two dialects (Socca, La P a z / T i a h u a n a c o ) . The allomorphs of the lp p o s s e s s i v e and 1+3 F suffixes in one d i a l e c t are not necessarily identical; the 1+3 F suffix has more allomorphs than does the lp p o s s e s s i v e .
Only the postvelar fricative and vowel length c o r r e s p o n d in the a t t e n u a t o r / t o p i c s u f f i x .

Conclusion

As shown by the e v i d e n c e p r e s e n t e d in this c h a p t e r , the only dialect division that can be made for Aymara on the basis of phoneme inventory alone is the division between the two dialects having the velar nasal phoneme (Carangas and Tarata) and all the rest. Apart"from this distinction all Aymara dialects share canonical form restrictions on shapes of roots and suffixes, a basic word stress pattern, and rules for the adaptation of Spanish loans to Aymara.
Cross-dialectal phonemic correspondences and free v a r i a t i o n w i t h i n d i a l e c t s show that in Aymara as a w h o l e certain phonemes are more stable than others. Vowel ins t a b i l i t y is e v i d e n t in the c o n s i d e r a b l e n u m b e r of crossd i a l e c t a l vowel c o r r e s p o n d e n c e s t h a t o c c u r and in p r o c e s s e s of vowel deletion and devoicing (see Chapter 4). Of the consonants the stops are the most stable although aspiration and glottalization rather easily shift from one stop or a f f r i c a t e to a n o t h e r in a w o r d , or m a y be a b s e n t in one a l l o m o r p h and p r e s e n t in a n o t h e r . The velar stop and to a lesser extent the postvelar stop are less stable than the other s t o p s , c o r r e s p o n d i n g in some a l l o m o r p h s to

141
the velar or postvelar fricatives, respectively. The affricate is also unstable, corresponding often to fricat i v e s , w h i c h is not surprising in view of its f r i c a t i v e offset. The velar and postvelar fricatives and the voiced nonstop consonants are the most unstable Aymara consonants.
Summarizing, the unstable phonemes of Aymara are the sonorants (the vowels and voiced consonants), the a f f r i c a t e s , and the f r i c a t i v e s . They all have in common the articulatory feature nonstop, permitting passage of air throughout or at some stage of the articulation. (The term continuant used by Pike to refer to nonstop c o n s o n a n t s is being a v o i d e d here since in c o n t e m p o r a r y usage it excludes nasals.)
Phonological correspondences alone do not permit grouping of dialects. Still, some dialectal patterning of phoneme c o r r e s p o n d e n c e s o c c u r s . La Paz tends to have /k/ in a number of m o r p h e m e s w h e r e other dialects may have /j/, and this dialect gives an overall impress ion of less aspiration, partly because of the absence of aspiration on c e r t a i n h i g h - f r e q u e n c y m o r p h e m e s t h a t have it in o t h e r d i a l e c t s . D i a l e c t s h a v i n g initial n a s a l s in the Ip possessive suffix (the southern dialects Jopoqueri, S a l i n a s , M o r o c o m a r c a , and C a l a c a l a plus the intermediate dialect Sitajara) may be distinguished from those having initial v e l a r or p o s t v e l a r f r i c a t i v e s in that s u f f i x (the northern dialects La P a z , J u l i , S o c c a , H u a n c a n 6 ,

142
Calacoa). Additional dialect groupings on the basis of patterning of phonological correspondences are given in the c o n c l u s i o n s to C h a p t e r s 5 , 6 , and 7 and in Chapter 10.
Other p h o n o l o g i c a l v a r i a t i o n that o c c u r s in Aymara is attributable to dialect-specific morphophonemic rules affecting the phonetic realizations of phonemes (for example voicing of stops) or causing phoneme shifts or d e l e t i o n s . These are d i s c u s s e d in Chapter 4.

Notes

^Vowel length often corresponds to glide plus vowel. See note 2 below.
2 Vowel length c o r r e s p o n d s to glide plus vowel in
a number of cases (see 3-4.3). A lengthened vowel may act phonetically like vowel plus glide making it impossible to tell whether length or glide is occurring when the homorganic glide follows /i/ or /u/. For example, /-pi:/ and /-pu:/ occur as variants of the final suffix -pi ~ -pi: ~ -pu ~ -pu: reiterator of known information (7-2.22.4). /-pi:/ and /-pu:/ retain vowel height before the postvelar fricative / x / , as would be the case with /piy/ and /puw/ but not with /pi/ and /pu/. Examples of /-pi:/ and /-pu:/ before /x/ (the sentence suffix -xa) are the following (see also note 10):

Inti nti.pi:.xa. 'She understands!?' (Sitajara)

Sa.ta.pu: . xa.

'It's called.' (repeating name of place)
(Corque)

n e a r Z e p i t a and D e s a g u a d e r o (both in the p r o v i n c e of C h u c u i t o , d e p a r t m e n t of Puno) there is another place called Carangas where /nh/ also occurs. Whether it is in f a c t the p h o n e m e or m e r e l y an a l l o p h o n e of a n o t h e r nasal needs to be determined.

The reason for the original borrowing's shift in initial vowel f r o m the back m i d /o/ (whose r e f l e x in A y m a r a w o u l d be / u / ) to the front /i/ is u n k n o w n ; it may be that a vowel h a r m o n y rule w a s then in e f f e c t in A y m a r a (see 4 - 3 . 2 2 . 1 1 ) .

Introduction

Morphophonemics may be defined as the rules which determine the phonological shapes of morphemes under different phonological, morphological , and syntactic condit i o n s . All t h r e e kinds of c o n d i t i o n i n g occur in A y m a r a . All m o r p h o p h o n e m i c rules in the language are m o r p h o l o g i c a l l y c o n d i t i o n e d in that they apply within m o r p h e m e s or a c r o s s morpheme boundaries, and/or to certain morphemes or morpheme classes and not to others. Some are also phonologically conditioned, involving (1) instability of certain phonemes; (2) permitted and unpermitted phoneme sequences and the effects of phonemes on each other when they occur in s e q u e n c e ; and (3) hierarchical ordering of phonemes (i. e. predominance of one over another). Some are syntactically conditioned by the sentence position or f u n c t i o n of the word that is s u b j e c t to the rule in question.
Of o v e r r i d i n g importance in Aymara are the regressive and progressive vowel-deleting and -retaining

145

146

rules, most of which pertain to suffixes. The rules for s u f f i x e s are all m o r p h o l o g i c a l l y d e t e r m i n e d in that they apply to individual morphemes, but some are also phonologically and syntactically conditioned.
V o w e l - d e l e t i o n and - r e t e n t i o n in noun r o o t s , stems, and themes are subject to syntactic considerations (position and function as head or modifier of a noun phrase, or function as subject or object of a verb) and also to p h o n o t a c t i c s (e. g. the n u m b e r of v o w e l s in a m o d i f i e r in a noun p h r a s e ) . The p a r t i c l e root jani 'no, n o t ' loses its final vowel in c e r t a i n s y n t a c t i c a l l y conditioned circumstances. Vowel-deletion and -retention in c e r t a i n v e r b stems are a l s o s u b j e c t to p h o n o t a c t i c consi derati ons.

Morphologically Determined Vowel-Deleting and

-Retaining Rules (Morphophonemics of Suffixes)

In a d d i t i o n to its c l a s s i f i c a t i o n by p h o n e m i c shape and g r a m m a t i c a l f u n c t i o n , each suffix in A y m a r a may be defined in terms of the e f f e c t it has (1) on the immediately preceding environment with respect to presence or absence of vowel or c o n s o n a n t , and (2) on the disposition of its own final vowel. Some of the conditioning is p h o n o l o g i c a l and some syntactic, but it is p r i m a r i l y morphological and must be stated for each s u f f i x , as is

147

d o n e in C h a p t e r s 5 , 6 , and 7. The f o l l o w i n g g e n e r a l i z a tions about suffix classes may be made.

4-2.1 Phonological and morphological conditioning

All suffixes starting with /:/ vowel length, /y/, and /ll/ require a preceding vowel. All suffixes starting with /w/ require a preceding vowel except -wa final suffix which may take either a preceding vowel or consonant. All suffixes beginning with a vowel (always /i/) require a preceding consonant, except that the nominalizing suffix -iri when following vowel length v e r b a l i z a t i o n in H u a n c a n £ (see 4 - 3 . 2 2 . 1 2 ) p e r m i t s a preceding /a/, the /i/ then becoming the homorganic glide

/y/.

All but three noun suffixes beginning with a

voiced consonant and all but two verbal derivational

suffixes beginning with a voiced consonant always re-

quire a preceding vowel. The three noun suffixes that

do not always require a preceding vowel are -layku ~

- r a y k u 'on a c c o u n t o f ' and -ma ~ -mma (a f r o z e n s u f f i x )

which basically require a preceding vowel but are subject

to the three-vowel rule (see 4-3.22.16), and -na 'on, in'

which is usually preceded by a vowel but has more complex

m o r p h o p h o n e m i c s in certain d i a l e c t s .

Verbal derivational suffixes that begin with the

nasal /n/ but may be preceded by either a consonant or a

vowel are -naqa- 'around, aimlessly' and -nuqa- placer.

148
Verbal inflectional suffixes beginning with nasals require a preceding vowel except that one suffix beginning with / m / , 2+3 I m p e r a t i v e , is affected by the preceding morphological environment (see 6-3.33). Verbal inflectional s u f f i x e s e n d i n g in n a s a l s m a y be a s s u m e d to have an underlying final /a/ since it reappears before the final s u f f i x -11a ~ -ya, and in f a c t all n a s a l - f i n a l v e r b a l i n f l e c t i o n a l s u f f i x e s have a l l o m o r p h s t h a t end in v o w e l s in one or m o r e d i a l e c t s . M o s t verbal i n f l e c t i o n a l suffixes ending in a vowel keep it before final suffixes although they may lose it w o r d - f i n a l l y , but verbal inflectional s u f f i x e s e n d i n g in /Vna/ or /:na/ and a l l o m o r p h s of 1+3 e n d i n g in /ta/ or /t"a/ ( e x c e p t in C a l a c o a ) drop the final /a/ before following suffixes except -11a ~ -ya. The behavior of the final vowel of the 2+3 Imperative suffix -ma and of a few other suffixes also involving the 2p varies dialectically.
4-2.2 Morphological conditioning
Noun suffixes and verbal derivational suffixes specify whether a consonant or vowel will precede, but (except for certain of the noun complement/relational suffixes; see 5-3.31) do not control the retention or loss of their own final vowel. Verbal inflectional suffixes both specify the preceding environment and control the retention and loss of their own final vowel (within the phonological limitations indicated above).

149

4-2.3 Phonological and syntactic conditioning
Phonotactic (canonical form) considerations such as (1) the number of preceding vowels on a s t e m , or (2) avoidance of final consonant clusters caused by syntactically-determined final vowel-deletion, condition regressive vowel-deletion or -retention by certain noun and verbal derivational suffixes. (See 4-3.22.16 on the three-vowel rule; 5-3.24 on the personal possessive noun suffixes; and 7-4.21.23 on the suffix combination -ha.taki 'in order t o ' . )
4-2.4 Morphological and syntactic conditioning
Nonfinal independent suffixes specify the preceding environment but allow the previous morpheme, syntactic considerations, and/or the following suffix to override their basic morphophonemics. Final suffixes ( e x c e p t - 1 1 a ~ -.ya p o l i t i v e w h i c h r e q u i r e s a p r e c e d i n g vowel by phonological conditioning) allow previous morphemes and syntactic considerations to decide their preceding environments. The retention or loss of their final vowels is subject to stylistic c o n d i t i o n i n g .

4-3

Phonotactically Conditioned Rules (Canonical

Form Conditions)

The following rules are conditioned by position of the p h o n e m e or p h o n e m e s e q u e n c e in the word and involve

150

loss of phonemes or phoneme sequences, addition or restoration of phonemes or phoneme sequences, cluster reduction, allophonic variation, and phoneme shifts. They sometimes pertain only to certain morphemes or morpheme classes, sometimes or more than one class. They often result from suffix morphophonemics. A few are tied to syntactic considerations. Most are optional,1 but a few are obligatory.

4-3.1 4-3.11

Word-initial position Initial /j/ --> 0

Optional loss of initial /j/ in rapid speech is not to be confused with existence of different allomorphs of one morpheme (either within a dialect or across dialects), one beginning with a vowel and the other with that vowel preceded by /j/ (see 3-4.25).
Initial /j/ often drops from the particle j a11 a 'thus' as in the c o m m o n e x p r e s s i o n

(j)a 11 u k a . t 'so t h e n , t h u s ' ( S o c c a )

Loss of initial /j/ also occurs across juncture ( w o r d - b o u n d a r y ) , as in

gam.ir.aqi < gam.ir jaqi 'rich person' (Huancang) p
jich".ayp'u < j ich"a jayp'u (La Paz)

151

4-3.12 Initial (C)V deletion

Optional deletion of initial fricative-vowel,

palatal 1ateral-vowel, or vowel alone occurs after

d e v o i c i n g of the vowel in rapid s p e e c h . T h a t i s , the

sequence is (C)V --> (C)V --> 0.

1

2°

3

4-3.12.1 /jV/ --> 0

Optional loss of initial /jV/ occurs most often in n o u n s , but it has also o c c u r r e d in p a r t i c l e s and in a verb. Examples:

Nouns:
3 ch".u:ru < jich"a uru 'today' (Salinas)
jich"a 'now uru 'day' 4 ch'a.mma.la < jach'a mama.la 'grandmother'
(Jopoqueri) jach'a 'big' mama.la 'mother'

sk'a:nu < jisk'a anu 'little dog' (La Paz/Compi) jisk'a 'little' anu 'dog'

ma: k'a.ta.x < ma: juk'a.ta.x 'a little' (Sitajara) ma: 'a' juk'a 'little' -ta 'from, of'

pa.x < jupa.x 3p pronoun (Huancane)

152

Verb: c
k.xat.ta.tayna ~ q"at.ta.tayna < jik.xat.ta.tayna 'he met' (Salinas)
Parti cles:
ni.w < jani.w 'no' (Salinas, Calacoa, Huancane) jani 'no' -wa final suffix

sa.lla < jisa.lla 'yes' (Salinas) jisa 'yes' -11a final suffix

sa.ya < jisa.ya 'yes' (La Paz, Calacala) -ya final suffix

In v i e w of the e x i s t e n c e in A y m a r a of m o r p h o p h o nemic rules for deleting initial CV and the absence of p r e f i x i n g as a p r o d u c t i v e g r a m m a t i c a l p r o c e s s in the language, it might be better to analyze sa.na as having the underlying root *~isa- which obligatorily loses its

4-3.21.31 Voicing and frication of intervocalic plain stops?
T h i s o c c u r s o p t i o n a l l y in all A y m a r a d i a l e c t s in the demonstratives aka 'this' and uka 'that' when they occur s u f f i x e d . It o c c u r s o c c a s i o n a l l y in c e r t a i n o t h e r m o r p h e m e s , in some d i a l e c t s . It occurs before but not after a stressed vowel and most often in fast speech. Examples:
aka [Ska] 'this' (never *[5§a]) (all dialects)
uka [Cika] 'that' (never *[d§a]) (all dialects)
Kuna.rak aka.sti? [agSsti] 'What is this?' (Huancane)
uka.t [u§£it] 'then' uka.x [u§5x] 'that' (all dialects)
uj<a.t.raji [ugatrSji] 'and then' (Calacala)
An example from Calacala with uka.n 'in t h e r e , in that p l a c e ' shows d i p h t h o n g a v o i d a n c e as well as

157

voicing and frication of /k/.

padre uka.n [padregcin] 'at the priest's house'

Other examples in other morphemes are the followi ng

ma: gala

at.xa.na.k.s 'on top of a stone' (Calacoa) gala 'stone' pata 'top'

na.naj<a.x [nanagcix] lp pronoun 'we/us' (Calacala) -naka plural

Ma: qamaqi .ki. :n.wa. [qamaqe§6:nwa] 'He was just a fox. (Salinas) -ki 'just'

In C a l a c a l a /k/ of the final suffix -ka t o p i c / a t t e n u a t o r (which may sometimes be a reduced form of uka) may be r e a l i z e d as [§] (see 7 - 2 . 2 2 . 1 1 ) .

158

4-3.21.32 Voicing and frication of prevocalic /p/ in -pa 3p suffix
This o c c u r r e d only in C a l a c a l a . The vowel f o l l o w ing /p/ is s t r e s s e d . In both e x a m p l e s /p/ is preceded by a stop rather than a vowel as in the p r e v i o u s rule.

v

ut.pa.ru [ut ~ 3ru] 'to his house'

—

b

v 1ak.pa.ru [lag ~ 5ru] 'to his mouth'
b

In the second e x a m p l e the voicing and f r i c a t i o n are also r e g r e s s i v e , a f f e c t i n g the /k/ of 1aka 'mouth'. It is interesting to note that -pa is the only personal possessive suffix that begins with a stop; the others all begin with nonstops. Whether this fact has any bearing on the f r i c a t i o n of /p/ in this i n s t a n c e is not y e t d e t e r m i n e d . This may instead be a case of operation of the intervocalic voicing rule (4-3.21.31) on the underlying forms *uta.pa.ru and *1aka.pa.ru, followed by operation of the rule deleting the vowel preceding -pa (5-3.24).

4-3.21.33 Prevocalic voicing after homorganic nasal or palatal lateral
T h i s rule is o b l i g a t o r y in S a l i n a s within m o r p h e m e s regardless of position of word stress. The rule may be tentatively written as follows as if it applied after any

159

nonstop voiced consonant, even though the only examples available have nasals or the palatal lateral.

aart

-vd

+cons

—>

+stop

+vd /

aart +vd +cons -stop

+vd -cons

art = point of articulation cons = consonantal

vd = voiced

It will be noted that in this rule f r i c a t i o n does not occur; the stops remain stops.
In the following examples from Salinas, voicing is required as the stop in q u e s t i o n occurs within a morpheme.

Nouns:

ampara

[ambcira]

'hand, arm'

Verbs:

wanqi.na [waggena] 'to wait for'

Verbal derivational suffix:

-nta- [nda] 'into' ira.nta.na [irandana]

Verbal inflectional suffixes:

-nta

[nda] 2+3 Future

-itanta [itanda] 2+1 Future

An example of an alternation between [k] and [g] within a morpheme is the following:

tink.t.wa [tigktwa] 'I fell' tinku.na [tigguna] 'to fall'

In the f i r s t i n s t a n c e the v o i c i n g rule is blocked by the

presence of the voiceless stop

/t/ after /k/. The

rule is also blocked before juncture if the stop

161

occurs immediately before a final dropped vowel; if the vowel is not dropped (even if it is d e v o i c e d ) the rule will operate:

Ma.nti [mandi] ala.ni.rap.ita.11. 'Buy it again for me.'
ma.nti 'again' ala.ni.na 'to buy'
In the n e x t e x a m p l e , t u n q u 'corn' as zero c o m p l e m e n t (4-3.31.2) loses its final vowel, blocking the voicing rule even though the following word begins with a vowel.

Tunq0 [togq] ap.j.t"a ampara.nti

~

>

—

'I am carrying corn in my hands.'

[ambarandi] tunqu 'corn'

ampara 'hand'

Aspiration or glottalization also blocks voicing, as in the f o l l o w i n g :

wint"u [wint"u] 'corner' wank'u [waqk'u] 'guinea pig'

Nor does v o i c i n g o c c u r in S p a n i s h loans t h a t lack i t .

sirwinta [sirwinta] < Spanish sirvienta

162

Nor does it occur if the nasal or lateral and the following stops are not homorganic.

qillqa.na [qel-jjana] 'to write'

The palatal affricate /ch/, which patterns with the stops, does not voice after the nonhomorganic alveolar /n/. (No examples of palatal /n/ followed by /ch/ have o c c u r r e d in the d a t a . )

jinchu [hincu] 'ear'

Across morpheme boundaries within a word, voicing may optionally occur if the voiced consonant and the following stop are homorganic, unless the word stress occurs before the voiced consonant, a restriction not applying within single morphemes. Examples:

mam.pa [mampa] 'his mother' mama 'mother' -pa 3p possessive

jan sa.:tan.ti [sa:t3nti]

'we will not say to him' -:tan 4+3 Future -ti negative final suffix

The morpheme combination -n.ka-, composed of -na noun suffix 'in, on' plus -ka- verbalizer, acts

163

morphologically like a unit; -ka- verbalizer never occurs except preceded by -na (usually reduced to the velar nasal a l l o p h o n e of / n / , w h i c h is h o m o r g a n i c to / k / ) . In this c o m b i n a t i o n /k/ a l w a y s v o i c e s in S a l i n a s .

aka.n.k.i.wa [akag£iwa] 'it's here' -na 'in, of' -ka- verbalizer

In o t h e r cases w h e r e the s e q u e n c e /nk/ o c c u r s a c r o s s morpheme boundaries and the word stress occurs after the nasal, voicing may or may not occur depending on whether the n a s a l is r e a l i z e d as h o m o r g a n i c to the f o l l o w i n g v e l a r , or n o t . ( N o n h o m o r g a n i c r e a l i z a t i o n s o c c u r in m o r e careful speech.)

Nonhomorgani c:

mun.ka. :na

[munkcirna] 'he wanted' muna.ha 'to wait' -ka- incompletive

yapu alira.n.k.i [aliranki] 'the field is sprouting' -ni- approacher -ka- incompletive
Homorgani c:
tani.n.jc.i :pan [taniggf :pan] 'running' -ni- approacher -ka- incompletive

164
In a d d i t i o n to its o b l i g a t o r y and o p t i o n a l occurrences in S a l i n a s , voicing of p r e v o c a l i c stops occurred s p o r a d i c a l l y after homorganic nasals in several other d i a l e c t s . In C a l a c a l a it o c c u r r e d s p o r a d i c a l l y in t h e fol1owi ng:
Particle: ampi [amjDf ~ ambf] 'right?'
Noun suffix: -mpi ~ -nti [mpi ~ mbi ~ ntn ~ ndi] 'with'
In S i t a j a r a v o i c i n g o c c u r r e d m o r e often in the s p e e c h of o n e s p e a k e r (a w o m a n u n d e r 3 0 , b i l i n g u a l in S p a n i s h ) t h a n in t h a t of a n o t h e r (a m o n o l i n g u a l w o m a n o v e r 60) and a l w a y s in s u f f i x e s , n o t r o o t s .

4-3.22.12 Geminate vowel sequences and vowel length
Geminate vowel sequences may occur at the word b o u n d a r y ( j u n c t u r e ) between a m o d i f i e r and a head in a noun phrase or as a result of suffixation with a morpheme of v o w e l l e n g t h s u c h as l->3 F (see 6 - 3 . 3 2 ) or v o w e l length verbalization (see 5-3.41.2).

Uka aru.wa. 'It's that word.' (La Paz; Hardman et al.

The length may optionally reduce to simple vowel.

kawkiri 'which' (La Paz) N o n g e m i n a t e vowel s e q u e n c e s are not permitted in Aymara surface structure, and trigger other rules; see 4-3.22.13.

167
4-3.22.13 Avoidance of nongeminate vowel sequences
As in the case of the i n t e r r o g a t i v e kawki ' w h e r e ' and the demonstrative k"uri 'way over yonder', the demonstratives aka 'this', uka 'that', and k"aya 'over yonder' (see 5-2.2) may also be suffixed with -:- verb a l i z e r plus -iri ' a c t o r / p u r p o s i v e ' . In t h e s e c a s e s a rule obligatory everywhere except Huancane converts the vowel s e q u e n c e */a i/ to /i : / , e . g . *akai ri is realized as ak.i:ri.
A c r o s s j u n c t u r e in c e r t a i n t e m p o r a l roots a similar process occurs, converting the vowel sequence */au/ to /u:/.
jich"a 'now' + uru 'day' > jich"u:ru 'today' (La Paz, Juli, Sitajara, Jopoqueri, Salinas, Morocomarca)
maya 'one, other' + uru 'day' > mayu:ru (Salinas) mayuru (La Paz, Jopoqueri)
Other similar compound temporals consisting of a modifier root (not a l w a y s f r e e ) plus uru 'day' are shown in Figure 5-1. Another example is kunu:ru 'what day, when' from kuna 'what' plus uru 'day'.

168

In the temporal e x a m p l e s a b o v e , the initial vowel /u/ of the head noun uru dominates the final /a/ of the modifier. A different rule occurs with the time interrogative kuna.wrasa 'when, what time' consisting of kuna 'what' plus urasa 'hour' (from Spanish horas 'hours'). By this r u l e , which o c c u r s in La P a z , J u l i , S o c c a , Calac o a , and S i t a j a r a , the vowel sequence */au/ is realized
g as the vowel-glide sequence /aw/ instead of reducing to /u:/ or /u/.
In H u a n c a n g /a/ f o l l o w e d by /u/ is r e g u l a r l y r e a l i z e d as /aw/ r a t h e r t h a n /u:/ or / u / , as in the following examples:
kuna 'what' + uru 'day' + -sa interrogative suffix >
kuna.wru.sa 'when'

kuna 'what' + urasa 'hours' + -sa interrogative >

kuna.wsa.sa

(urasa > /usa/ > /wsa/) 'what time'

jich"a 'this' + uru 'day' > jich"a.wru 'today' (also in Calacoa) sapa 'every' + uru 'day' > sapa.wru 'every day'

Other examples of /aw/ for H u a n c a n e are given in Figure 5 - 1 . In H u a n c a n 6 the d i p h t h o n g */iu/ s i m i l a r l y c h a n g e s

169
to / i w / , but */ai/ may change to /ay/ or /i:/.
uka 'that' + -:- verbalizer + -iri 'actor' >
uka.yri ~ uk.i:ri 'that one there'
Similar vowel sequence avoidance rules may be frozen in the 3+1 and 3+4 Remote Indirect Knowledge tense s u f f i x e s in c e r t a i n d i a l e c t s (see 6 - 3 . 3 5 . 2 ) .
4-3.22.14 Reduction of vowel-glide-vowel to long or plain vowel
Reduction of vowel-glide-vowel to long or plain vowel affects only a few morphemes, although they have a high functional load: certain nouns (two numbers, two demonstratives, and a personal pronoun) and a verbal deriv a t i o n a l s u f f i x . In all c a s e s but one the v o w e l - g l i d e vowel s e q u e n c e is / a y a / ; /uyu/ o c c u r s in a d e m o n s t r a t i v e in one d i a l e c t .
All dialects having /aya/ (or /uyu/) base forms in n o u n s r e d u c e the v o w e l - g l i d e - v o w e l s e q u e n c e to long vowel when the nouns occur as m o d i f i e r s . All dialects also r e d u c e v o w e l - g l i d e - v o w e l s e q u e n c e s in certain n o u n s before certain suffixes.
The two nouns t h a t o c c u r in all d i a l e c t s in v o w e l glide-vowel form are the numbers /maya/ 'one' and /paya/ 'two'. In J o p o q u e r i the reduced a l l o m o r p h s /ma:/ and /pa:/

170
occur not only as modifiers, as they do elsewhere, but also in compound n u m b e r s , e. g. /tunka m a : . n i / ' e l e v e n 1 , /tunka paj^.ni/ 'twelve' (see 5 - 2 . 4 ) .
The demonstratives that have vowel-glide-vowel sequences are /k"aya/ 'over there' (La P a z , J u l i , S o c c a , Huancang, Jopoqueri, Salinas), /k"ayu/ 'over there' (Calacala), and /k"uyu/ 'way over there' (Morocomarca). All o c c u r r e d in vowel length form as m o d i f i e r s e x c e p t / k " a y u / , for which no example as modifier is available. (For additional details on reduction of these d e m o n s t r a t i v e s to the vowel length form, see 5-2.2.)
The personal pronoun that has a vowel-glide-vowel s e q u e n c e is / n a y a / l p , w h i c h o c c u r s in all d i a l e c t s e x c e p t Huancand and Sitajara. These dialects have only the reduced forms /na:/ or /na/. All dialects with /naya/ reduce it to /na/ before the plural suffix -naka. (See 5-2.3, also.)
In La Paz the verbal d e r i v a t i o n a l s u f f i x - w a y a distancer has an optional allomorph /-wa-/ occurring before suffixes that require a preceding vowel. (See 6-2.23, also.)
4 - 3 . 2 2 . 1 5 R e t e n t i o n of long vowel in c e r t a i n v e r b r o o t s
The verbs ama:.na 'to l i k e , w a n t ' and p"a:.na 'to c o o k ' , w h i c h o c c u r in S i t a j a r a , have in t h e i r r o o t s vowel length w h i c h c o r r e s p o n d s to /ya/ in the r e l a t e d

171
verb root amuya.na 'to think, consider' and the cognate verb root p"a.ya.na 'to c o o k ' o c c u r r i n g in m o s t d i a l e c t s . T h a t this vowel length is m o r p h o p h o n e m i c a l l y like a consonant plus vowel is shown by the fact that the length persists even before consonant-requiring suffixes.
^p"a:- + -c t'a- 'momentaneous' + -si- reflexive
+ -na nominalizer >
p"a:.t'a.si.na 'to cook for oneself at once'
On a verb root ending in plain v o w e l , the suffix -t'awould cause the final root vowel to drop, e. g. chura'give' p l u s -t'a- is c h u r . t ' a - . W h e n a s t e m e n d i n g in long vowel is followed by a suffix r e q u i r i n g a p r e c e d i n g consonant, the vowel length drops leaving a plain vowel, as in w a r m i . t . wa ' I am a w o m a n ' , in w h i c h t h e l->3 S i m p l e tense suffix - ta reduces verbalizing vowel length to simple v o w e l . If length were not t h e r e in the u n d e r l y i n g r e p r e s e n t a t i o n , the form would be * w a r m . t . w a .
T h u s , when -t'a- occurs on the verb p"a:-, *p"a.t'a- would be expected, the vowel length reducing to plain v o w e l . H o w e v e r , in p"a : .t'a.si.na length is clearly present, showing that verb root vowel length can block the operation of a consonant-requiring rule or to put it a n o t h e r w a y , t h a t verb root vowel length is in fact a sequence of glide plus vowel (3-5.3).

Furthermore, for the two verbs here discussed the verbal inflections for 1+3 Simple tense and for 1+3 Remote Direct Knowledge (RDK) tense fall together, since root vowel length is indistinguishable from the vowel length mark of RDK, and geminate vowel length (vowel length longer than two vowels) does not occur. That is, the f o l l o w i n g forms do d o u b l e duty for 1+3 in both the S i m p l e and RDK tenses.

ama:t"a 'I wanted'

p"a:t"a 'I cooked'

Another kind of vowel length in a root is that o c c u r r i n g with the verb sa.na plus Simple tense in Jopoqueri (see Figure 6-11). This length results from a rule lengthening the root vowel to avoid an initial consonant c l u s t e r . In S i t a j a r a one a l l o m o r p h of the 1+3 S i m p l e tense with sa.na (the only irregular verb in A y m a r a ) has a long v o w e l , a l t h o u g h initial c o n s o n a n t c l u s t e r s in sa.na are common in t h a t d i a l e c t .

Three-vowel rule (Vowel deletion) Nouns

By a syntactically conditioned rule, noun roots having two vowels always keep the final vowel when serving as m o d i f i e r s in noun p h r a s e s . (Nouns e n d i n g in a s e q u e n c e of vowel-glide-vowel reduce it to long vowel; see 4 - 3 . 2 2 . 1 4 . )

173

Noun roots or stems having three or more vowels lose the last vowel w h e n o c c u r r i n g as m o d i f i e r s in noun p h r a s e s . That is, the head noun causes the final vowel of the modifier to drop if the modifier has three or more vowels. Examples:

janq'u ch'uqi 12
ch'iyar ch'uqi 1 23

'white potato' (La Paz) 'black potato' (La Paz) ch'iyara 'black'

taq.pach kurpu 1 23

'whole body' (La Paz) taqi 'all' ~cpacha 'same'

tata.la.n yap.pa
TI 3 4

'my father's field' (Morocomarca) (see 4-4.3) -na Ip possessive

When the m o d i f i e r ends in the p o s s e s s i v e suffix -na, the final /a/ may or may not be retained, according to rules specific to that suffix which override the t h r e e - v o w e l r u l e in c e r t a i n d i a l e c t s (see 5 - 3 . 3 1 . 2 ) .
A noun p h r a s e embedded in a n o t h e r m a y behave s y n t a c t i c a l l y like a s i n g l e m o d i f i e r , in w h i c h case the three-vowel rule will apply.

174

aka tug laru.n
T2 3 4

'on this side' (Juli) aka 'this' tuqi 'around'

laru 'side' < Spanish lado

But successive noun phrases having a different immediate constituency from the above do not necessarily manifest the three-vowel rule; see 7-4.2 and additional examples cited by Hardman et al. (1975:3.373-374).

4-3.22.16.2 Noun suffixes

In all d i a l e c t s the noun s u f f i x e s -layku ~ - r a y k u 'on a c c o u n t o f ' , -pura ' b e t w e e n , a m o n g ' , and -kama ' a m o n g , all, each, up to, as far as, until' act like heads of noun p h r a s e s , ^ requiring that modifiers having more than three v o w e l s d r o p the l a s t o n e , e x c e p t that in cases of m o d i f i e r s that are t h e m s e l v e s noun phrases the rule is variable as indicated above.
In H u a n c a n G the personal p o s s e s s i v e s u f f i x e s and the complement/relational suffix -taki 'for' usually follow the three-vowel rule. Examples:

kuntu.ja
T2

'my story' kuntu 'story' /-ja/ lp possessive < Spanish cuento

awich .ja 'my grandmother' 12 3

awicha

'grandmother'

175

juma.taki 'for you' 12

juma 2p

-taki 'for'

jiwas .taki 'for us' jiwasa 4p 1 23

In the following example (still for H u a n c a n g ) , the possessive -ma 2p keeps a previous vowel although four vowels precede it, but loses its own vowel before a following -taki, indicating that when more than one suffix subject to the three-vowel rule occurs on a noun, the rule applies only to the suffix occurring last on the stem.

yapu.naka.m .taki 11 c2 J 34 4 0 5

'for my fields'

yapu 'field -naka plural

The frozen suffixes -ma ~ -mma and -ta ~ -tta that occur on certain kinship terms in J o p o q u e r i (see 5-3.11.14 and 5-3.11.15) may be considered reduced forms of the noun roots mama 'mother' and tata 'father' that lost t h e i r f i r s t vowel b e c a u s e it was the third in sequence in the new stem. Examples:

pichu.m ma 'father's youngest brother's wife' 1 23

lari.t ta 12 3

'uncle'

176

When the two suffixes occur on noun stems that already have three vowels, these stems lose the final vowel by the three-vowel rule.

sullk.ir .ma^ T 23

'father's younger brother's wife' sullk.iri 'younger'

sullk.ir .tta 1 23

'father's younger brother'

The verbalizing suffix -ki pta-, which also usually takes a preceding vowel, causes the third vowel of a three-vowel noun to drop.

usu.r .kipta.na 'to become sickly' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco)
T2 3
usu.ri 'sick person'

Before other suffixes that require a preceding vowel (such as -pta- verbalizer) three-vowel noun roots and stems keep the final vowel.

Ch'iyara.pta.s.k.i.w. 'It is turning black.' (La Paz)
T2 3
usu.ri.pta.ha 'to become sickly' (La Paz)
T2 3

177

4-3.22.16.3 Verb suffixes
Certain verbal derivational suffixes that normally take a preceding vowel follow the three-vowel rule on verb stems ending in the verbal d e r i v a t i o n a l suffix -sifrozen to the root (see 6-2.21). The suffixes are -mucha- ~ -muchu- ~ -nuku- 'away, off', -paya- helper/mocker, and -tata- scatterer.

ali.s .muchu.na ~ ali.s .nuku.ria 'to throw out'

Ti" 3

TI 3

(La Paz/Tiahuanaco) ali. si .ria 'to sprout'

ali.s .paya.na 'to throw someone out' (La Paz, Salinas)
Ti" 3

aru.s .tata.ria
Ti" 3

'to say1 (Salinas; not used in La Paz) -tata- scatterer aru 'word, speak'

The verbal derivational suffix -cha-, which can verbalize nouns, follows the three-vowel rule when it occurs on a noun stem ending in -ni possessor s u f f i x . Normally, -cha- requires a preceding vowel.

qullqi.n .cha.na T 23

'to cause someone to win' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco) qui 1qi.ni 'money-haver'

178

When the verbal derivational -kipa- 'past a point' occurs on a two-vowel noun verbalized with - c h a - , the three-vowel rule also applies although -kipa- usually requires a preceding vowel.

uta.ch .kipa.si,ni.na 'to fix the roof of a house'

12 3

(La Paz/ Tiahuanaco) uta 'house'

The examples suggest that the three-vowel rule may have applied more generally in the past than it does today. That is, the fact that some suffixes trigger the three-vowel rule on roots or stems having three vowels may reflect a stage during which the rule operated for all suffixed three-vowel stems regardless of whether the suffix in q u e s t i o n n o r m a l l y required a p r e c e d i n g vowel or consonant.

4-3.22.2

Consonants

The following rules apply after suffixation accompanied by vowel-dropping has created certain consonant clusters.

4-3.22.21 Geminate consonant clusters

Examples of geminate consonant clusters were given in 4 - 3 . 2 2 . 1 6 . 2 . They u s u a l l y reduce to o n e . Three successive geminate consonants usually reduce to two.

179
Jani.w at.t.ti [atti]. 'I can't.1 (Salinas)
ati.na 'to be able'
~ c t a c 1+3 Simple tense
-ti negative final suffix
4-3.22.22 Reduction of stop-fricative clusters to aspirated stops (Neutralization)
When m o r p h o p h o n e m i c v o w e l - d r o p p i n g r e s u l t s in a /kj/, / k x / , or /qx/ cluster, the result is indistinguishable phonetically from /k"/ or /q"/. /kx/ tends to assimilate to /q"/> the postvelar fricative exerting regressive influence on the point of articulation of the stop.
4-3.22.23 Frication of velar stop before consonant /k/ --> /j/ / _ [ + c o n s ]
By this rule the velar stop /k/ changes to the h o m o r g a n i c v e l a r f r i c a t i v e / j / . T h e rule o c c u r s only in Salinas and Huancani.
In S a l i n a s the r u l e a p p l i e s to two s u f f i x e s containing /k/ after morphophonemic vowel dropping has created a cluster of /k/ plus another consonant (not another /k/). The suffixes are -ka- verbal derivational incompletive and -raki nonfinal independent. The only c o n s o n a n t s that have occurred after /k/ in examples noted

180
to date are /t/ and /s/. Examples:
Ni.w chur.jc.i.ti. 'He/she/they didn't give it (to X).' no give ~~
-i 3+3 Simple tense
Ni.w chur.j.t.ti. 'I didn't give it (to X).' ~ c t a c 1+3 Simple tense
kuna.raki 'and what?'
kuna.:ma.s.ka.raj.ta 12 'and how are you?' ~ c t a v 2+3 Simple tense
In H u a n c a n e the rule o p e r a t e s on -raki b e f o r e consonant-requiring verbal inflectional suffix -chi NI
Wali.ka.raj.chi.ni.t. 'It may not be good.' - NI 3+3 F
(In this example vowel length verbalization on wali is reduced to plain vowel before the c o n s o n a n t requiring -ka- incompletive suffix.)

181

4-3.22.24 Reduction of fricative clusters /sj/, /js/, /sjs/ --> [s]
This rule operates in Salinas on the output of the rule in 4 - 3 . 2 2 . 2 3 when /j/ is preceded and/or followed by /s/, reducing the cluster to the alveolar fricative [s ].
lura.s.j.ta [lurasta] 'you were making/doing'
-si- reflexive/reciprocal
—-c—t—a,v - 2+3 Simple tense
kuynt.t'.ka.raj.sma [kuyntt'karasma] 'I've told the story to you'
-csma 1+2 Simple tense

In.j.ta.s.j.sma.wa. [injtasmawa] 'I know you.1

-si- reflexive/reciprocal

4-3.22.25 Affricate reduction rules 4-3.22.25.1 /ch/ --> [s] / [-cons]

[+stop]

The affricate /ch/ may reduce to the fricative a l l o p h o n e [s] when /ch/ occurs before a stop in noun or v e r b r o o t s or in the verbal d e r i v a t i o n a l c a u s a t i v e and verbalizing suffix -cha-. (As noted under 4-3.22.24,

182

[s] also results from reduction of sequences of /s/ and /j/ in S a l i n a s . The n e u t r a l i z a t i o n of /ch/ and /sj/ is evidence of the instability of the three phonemes as indic a t e d in C h a p t e r 3 . ) In all r o o t s and in the s u f f i x -cha- /ch/ is preceded by a v o w e l . Reduction to [s] is o b l i g a t o r y in s o m e m o r p h e m e s , o p t i o n a l in o t h e r s , and varies dialectally. Examples:
Nouns:
pachpa [paspa] 'same' (most dialects)

4-3.31 Retention or loss of final vowel of morphological word (syntactically conditioned)

4-3.31.1 Verb subjects

In the basic A y m a r a s e n t e n c e (see 7 - 3 ) the s u b j e c t noun (or head of a noun phrase serving as subject) retains

186
its final vowel before final sentence suffix(es) if any. 14
In La Paz and S i t a j a r a (and p o s s i b l y e l s e w h e r e - data are incomplete) a pronoun subject of a verb inflected for the Imperative usually loses its final vowel and takes no independent or final suffixes. The vowel loss is tied to co-occurrence with certain person/tense suffixes of the I m p e r a t i v e , h o w e v e r , and the r u l e s in La Paz d i f f e r f r o m t h o s e in S i t a j a r a . In M o r o c o m a r c a the s u b j e c t of an Imperative verb does not lose its final vowel. (For a fuller discussion of these rules see 6-3.33.)
In s e n t e n c e s c o n t a i n i n g a m a i n and a s u b o r d i n a t e d verb (see 7-4.2), pronoun subjects may lose or retain their final v o w e l s . The following example is from La P a z / C o m p i , with -chi NI (reduced to /s/) plus Simple tense on the subordinated verb and Imperative (or Future) tense on the main verb.

jan sara.n mun.k.s.ta.x
2+3 NI S

no go

want

sara.:
go 1+3 F/I

If you don't want to go, I'll go.

All four of the possible combinations with and without

187

final vowel on the subjects were acceptable, although the first example elicited had no vowel on either. The same e x a m p l e o c c u r r e d in J u l i , and s i m i l a r ones o c c u r r e d in Huancan6, Sitajara, and Calacoa.
Without the negative, forms with final vowel are p r e f e r r e d , as in the following example which has -chi NI (reduced to /s/) plus Simple tense on the subordinated verb, and Imperative on the main verb.

Juma.x 2p ~

apa.n.ma. bring 2+3
I

'If you want some potatoes, bring a bag.' (Juli)

In M o r o c o m a r c a , J o p o q u e r i , and S a l i n a s , on the other hand, pronoun subjects never occur without their final v o w e l s , though in s e n t e n c e s of the types here exemplified they usually occur unsuffixed.

In all d i a l e c t s i n v e s t i g a t e d e x c e p t M o r o c o m a r c a , a pronoun subject of a verb subordinated with -ipana

188
(and other members of the paradigm, if any) occurs without a final vowel (see 7-4.22.2).
4-3.31.2 Verb zero complements
A noun root or stem or a nominalized theme serving as the zero c o m p l e m e n t of a verb is m a r k e d by o b l i g a t o r y loss of the final stem vowel before final (sentence) suffixes, if any (except the final suffix -11a ~ - y a , which requires a preceding vowel; see 4-3.32.2 and 5-3.33 for examples).
4-3.31.3 Negative jani
The final vowel of the negative particle jani drops when it modifies a noun root (except an interrogative), stem, or theme, a subordinated verb, or a verb with the I m p e r a t i v e t e n s e , and when it occurs in n e g a t i v e information questions and answers thereto. When modifying an interrogative, jani loses its initial /ja/. (See 7-4.53.3.)
4-3.32 Tolerance or avoidance of final consonant clusters in the morphological word
4-3.32.1 Verbs
Three dialects permit stem-final consonant clusters in verbs inflected with the Imperative tense: J u l i , S o c c a , and HuancanS. Juli and Socca permit such clusters only

189

when the verb ends with the 2+3 Imperative inflection w h i l e H u a n c a n g p e r m i t s them in stems ending in the
3+2, 2+1, 3+1, and 3+4 Imperative inflections as well (see 6-3.33). Examples, all of 2+3 I, are

Jut.m. 'Come!' (Socca)

Al.t'a.si.w.m uk. 'Buy that one.' (Huancand)

Apa.n.m. 'Bring it.' (Huancand)
4-3.32.2 Nouns
Socca permits final consonant clusters on a noun ending in the suffix -na p o s s e s s i v e , when the noun occurs as m o d i f i e r in a noun p h r a s e .

K"it.n whose

wutilla.p.s bottle

jala.qa.ya.raq.ta?

knock over

2+3

S

'Whose bottle did you knock over on purpose?'

(See 5-3.31.2 for further discussion of the suffix -na.) In M o r o c o m a r c a , w h e n a final c o n s o n a n t c l u s t e r
o c c u r s on a noun stem ending in a personal p o s s e s s i v e suffix as the result of syntactically conditioned vowel dropping, the vowel before the last consonant will be obligatorily restored (see 5-3.24).

In t h i s e x a m p l e , w a w a . m p is a zero c o m p l e m e n t , l o s i n g its final vowel.
4-3.33 Stem-final vowel restoration (stress on antepenultimate vowel of a verb)
As i n d i c a t e d in 3 - 3 . 1 , stress in A y m a r a is nonphonemic, always occurring on the penultimate vowel. Vowel length after a penultimate stressed vowel, or loss of a final vowel, may make the stress appear to fall on the last vowel of a w o r d . Restoration of a final vowel /a/ to an inflected verb after stress placement may make the stress appear to fall on the antepenultimate v o w e l . T h i s e f f e c t has so far been heard o n l y in La Paz and S i t a j a r a on verbs i n f l e c t e d w i t h s u f f i x e s e n d i n g in n a s a l s . T h e s e s u f f i x e s a r e t h e 2 + 3 I m p e r a t i v e _iv!IL> 3+2 Simple ~ c t a m , and 4+3 Simple ~ c t a n . The stress pattern occurs m o s t often on 2+3 I m p e r a t i v e , rarely on the o t h e r s . In La Paz the p a t t e r n o c c u r s m o s t f r e q u e n t l y in r a d i o a d v e r t i s e m e n t s and a n n o u n c e m e n t s but has a l s o been heard in sermons (see 9-3 for e x a m p l e s ) .

191
Apart from the contexts of advertising, announcing, or p r e a c h i n g , the pattern occurs r a r e l y in La Paz. In one instance it occurred with the final /a/ d e v o i c e d , in conversati on.
Ratu.ki apci.ni.ma. 'Bring it right away.'

S t r e s s o c c u r s on the a n t e p e n u l t i m a t e vowel in the f i r s t word above, with a final /a/ restored to the 2+3 Imperat i v e i n f l e c t i o n .

In the f i r s t w o r d , stress placement occurred before final vowel restoration, while in the last, vowel restoration o c c u r r e d , then suffixation with -11a, then stress placement. The two rules may be stated as follows:

In the case of umci.nta.ma, b e g i n n i n g w i t h the base f o r m u m a . n t a . m the r u l e s a p p l y in the o r d e r 1 , 2 . In the case of urn.t'a.mg.11 a, beginning with the base form urn.t'a.m the rules apply in the order 2, 1 with the intervening suffixation of -11a between 2 and 1.
Since um.t'a.ma.11 a is more p o l i t e , having the politive suffix - 1 1 a , one is tempted to infer that the restoration of the final vowel to urnS.nta.ma may be an attempt to soften the command by preparing the verb stem to take the politive, but since stress has already been p l a c e d , the word is closed to further s u f f i x a t i o n .

4-3.41 Final vowel-dropping or -devoicing

In all d i a l e c t s t h e f i n a l s e n t e n c e s u f f i x e s (for

example, -wa, -xa, -11a ~ -ya, -sa, and -ti) commonly

lose their final vowels phrase-finally within a sentence;

-wa and -11a ~ -ya commonly lose them sentence-finally

as w e l l . Such vowel-dropping may well depend on stylistic

c o n s i d e r a t i o n s , as Hardman has suggested.

Instead of d r o p p i n g , final vowels may devoice

s e n t e n c e - f i n a l l y , as in the e x a m p l e given in 4 - 3 . 3 3 a b o v e .

A final vowel which must be retained because of its gram-

matical function, for example the verb inflection 3+3

S i m p l e j^i, m a y d e v o i c e , e s p e c i a l l y if it o c c u r s b e t w e e n

two voiceless consonants sentence-medially. (For an

193

example of sentence-medial final vowel devoicing, see 4-3.21.33.) L. Martin-Barber has provided a phonetic transcription showing vowel devoicing in a story told by a speaker from Compi (Hardman et al. 1975:3.92-93).
For the n o n n a t i v e , it is often difficult to distinguish word-final vowel dropping from word-final vowel devoicing. A devoiced final vowel, though undet e c t a b l e to a f o r e i g n e r , is still p r e s e n t m o r p h o p h o n e m i c a l l y and discernible to a native speaker since syntactic distinctions are made by presence or absence of final vowels.

General and Dialect-Specific Rules

The m a j o r i t y of m o r p h o p h o n e m i c rules in Aymara are found in all d i a l e c t s , but certain rules are dialectspeci fi c.

194
4-4.1 V a r i a t i o n in m o r p h o p h o n e m i c s of s u f f i x e s
Noun s u f f i x e s (5-3) that vary in their m o r p h o phonemics from one dialect to another are the personal possessives and the compiement/relationals. While all dialects have certain noun suffixes that observe the t h r e e - v o w e l r u l e , in H u a n c a n g the r u l e a l s o o p e r a t e s for -taki complement/relational and the personal poss e s s i v e s , which do not f o l l o w the rule in other d i a l e c t s . In J o p o q u e r i the t h r e e - v o w e l rule e x t e n d s to certain f r o z e n s u f f i x e s . In M o r o c o m a r c a , C a l a c a l a , J o p o q u e r i , and Salinas the personal possessive suffixes have variable morphophonemics conditioned by final consonant cluster avoidance rules.
Only two verbal derivational suffixes (6-2) have variable preceding morphophonemics: -naqa- 'aimlessly' and -nuqa- placer. These vary within as well as across dialects. Verbal derivational suffixes subject to the t h r e e - v o w e l rule in La Paz (and p o s s i b l y e l s e w h e r e ) are -cha- verbalizer of nouns, -kipa- 'past a point,' -muchu- (and variants) 'away', -paya- helper, and -tatascatterer.
Of the verbal inflectional suffixes (6-3), 2+3 Imperative is unique in requiring a preceding c o n s o n a n t in J u l i , S o c c a , H u a n c a n d , and M o r o c o m a r c a , e x c e p t when the verbal derivational suffix -ka- incompletive precedes

V a r i a t i o n in o t h e r m o r p h o p h o n e m i c r u l e s Rules o c c u r r i n g in all d i a l e c t s Obligatory rules

Obligatory rules occurring in all dialects are p r e d o m i n a n c e of /u/ over a p r e c e d i n g /i/ in verb s t e m s ; vowel sequence avoidance rules (some differences occur in the rules t h e m s e l v e s ) ; reduction of /aya/ to /a:/ (and of /uyu/ to /u:/)in m o d i f i e r s in noun p h r a s e s ; the three-vowel rule (exerted by heads of noun phrases on modifiers and by certain noun suffixes on preceding stems; some dialects have additional suffixes subject to the rule); interconsonantal affricate reduction to /s/; morphological word-final vowel retention for subjects of m a i n v e r b s ( e x c e p t with the I m p e r a t i v e t e n s e in c e r t a i n contexts and dialects); morphological word-final vowel loss for zero complements; morphological word-final vowel loss on jani n e g a t i v e in c e r t a i n e n v i r o n m e n t s .

4-4.21.2 Optional rules

Optional rules occurring in all d i a l e c t s are dropping of initial (C)V preceded by devoicing of the vowel; intervocalic stop-voicing and frication under

196

certain conditions; geminate consonant reduction; neutralization of stop-fricative clusters and aspirated stops; syntactical word-final vowel devoicing and deletion.

4-4.22 4-4.22.1

Dialect-specific rules Obligatory rules

Obligatory dialect-specific rules are voicing of prevocalic stops after homorganic nasals and the palatal lateral within a morpheme, Salinas; frication of velar stop before c o n s o n a n t in certain m o r p h e m e s , S a l i n a s ; reduction of clusters of alveolar fricative plus velar fricative, Salinas; affricate reduction to /s/ after /x/, Jopoqueri; loss of morphological word-final vowel on verb s u b j e c t s in c e r t a i n e n v i r o n m e n t s in c e r t a i n d i a l e c t s ; avoidance of morphological word-final consonant clusters on nouns with personal possessive suffixes, Morocomarca.

4-4.22.2 Optional rules

Optional dialect-specific rules are preposition (or recovery) of initial /ji/ or /si/ on sa.ha before Simple tense i n f l e c t i o n , La Paz, J u l i , H u a n c a n 6 , Socca; reduction of /q1/ to ['], Salinas, Calacala, and Morocomarca; palatalized velar allophone of /n/, Morocomarca; voicing of stop after homorganic nasal and before vowel, Calacala, Corque, Huancan6, Sitajara; voicing and frication of p r e v o c a l i c /p/ in -pa 3p s u f f i x , C a l a c a l a ;

197

lateralization and denasalization of /n/, Morocomarca; final vowel restoration and antepenultimate stress on 2+3 Imperative and certain other person/tense suffixes, La Paz and S i t a j a r a .

Conclusion

Taken as a whole and in spite of its c o m p l e x i t i e s , m o r p h o p h o n e m i c s is a rather stable area of Aymara g r a m m a r , contributing to mutual dialect intelligibility (although s p e a k e r s from La Paz have some d i f f i c u l t y with d i a l e c t s having extensive stop voicing and frication). Few suffixes d i f f e r in m o r p h o p h o n e m i c s from one d i a l e c t to a n o t h e r , although some are affected by phonologically and syntactically conditioned rules that are dialect specific. Some dialect groups that may be identified by morphophonemic rules are as follows.

4-5.1

Dialects preposing (or restoring) /si/ or /ji/ to sa.na

La Paz (preferred); J u l i , Socca, Huancang (less frequent).

Notes
An optional rule is one whose constraints are not yet fully understood. Many are probably stylistically conditi oned.
o The geminate vowel cluster /aa/ resulting from
loss of /j/ reduces to /a/; see 4-3.22.12. 3 The final vowel of jich"a drops by a vowel
sequence avoidance rule; see 4-3.22.13.
^The first vowel of mama drops by the three-vowel rule; see 4-3.22.16.
5 This example shows that initial consonant clusters
are permitted in La Paz/Compi d i a l e c t in n o u n s . They are u s u a l l y avoided in v e r b s ; see 4 - 3 . 1 3 . G e m i n a t e /a/ here r e s u l t s in / a : / .
c By a regular morphophonemic rule (see 4-3.22.22)
/j/ or /x/ tends to reduce to aspiration following the h o m o r g a n i c s t o p . In the n o n h o m o r g a n i c c o m b i n a t i o n /kx/ the velar /k/ tends to assimilate to the following postvelar / x / , resulting in /q"/-
A c c o r d i n g to Hardman (personal communication) voicing and and frication of stops are common in Andean l a n g u a g e s , especially in Q u e c h u a . Place names often reflect this, e. g. Cochabamba.
o In the d e r i v a t i o n s of k a w k . i : r i and k"ur.i:ri
the following intervening forms may be postulated since vowel length verbalization requires a preceding vowel w h i l e -iri requires a p r e c e d i n g c o n s o n a n t o r , as in t h e s e cases, reduces a preceding long vowel to one vowel.
With morpheme divisions: *kawkiiiri > [kawkiiri] /kawki:ri/ kawk.i:ri
*k"uriiiri > [k"uriiri] /k"uri:ri/ k"ur.i:ri

200
The morphemic divisions are placed as if the vowel length were occurring on the first /i/ or - i r i, although actually the vowel length results from two /i/'s in succession, one on the root and one in - i r i . More a c c u r a t e m o r p h e m i c renderings would be kawki.iri and k"uri.iri, but since geminate vowels are symbolized as vowel plus /:/ in Yapita orthogr a p h y , the above compromise is followed in these forms and other similar ones that occur elsewhere in this study; see 4-3.22.12, 5-2.1, and 5-2.2.
g The existence of the glides /w/ and /y/ as
d i s t i n c t from the vowels /u/ and /i/ is supported by the minimal pair uywa 'animal' / wiwa 'long live' < Spanish viva. (Native Aymara roots beginning with /wi/ include wi1 a 'blood' and a number of others). Examples of /i/ or /u/ preceded or followed by the homorganic glide are
chura.y.itu 'he/she caused to give to me' (all dialects)
iya.na 'to grind' (Jopoqueri)
sawu.na 'to weave' (all dialects)
Yapu.wa. 'It's a field.' (all dialects)
Since in some dialects certain verbal derivational suffixes also follow the three-vowel rule, it m i g h t be m o r e a c c u r a t e to say t h a t in being s u b j e c t to the rule, heads of noun phrases act like certain suffixes.
'^The geminate /mm/ here reduces to /m/.

o c c u r before v o w e l - r e q u i r i n g suffixes and in w o r d - f i n a l p o s i t i o n , so it is possible to consider it an alternate base form of the m o r p h e m e as was done in 3 - 4 . 2 2 . 2 3 .
13 A m o r p h o l o g i c a l word is defined by Hardman as

5-1

Introduction

The noun system of Aymara consists of roots and derived roots (stems), which are all free, derivational suffixes, and zero complement vowel drop.1 Nouns occur alone and in noun phrases as heads and m o d i f i e r s ; some o c c u r m o d i f y i n g v e r b s . T h e open class of nouns takes in loanwords freely. Closed classes of roots do not freely a d m i t l o a n w o r d s , a l t h o u g h they may have d o n e so in the past. They are interrogatives, demonstratives, personal pronouns, numbers, positionals, and temporals. There is also a small class of ambiguous noun/verb roots. O t h e r c l o s e d c l a s s e s are s h a p e s used in w e a v i n g , and kinship and age terms, which were only sporadically inv e s t i g a t e d in this r e s e a r c h although m e r i t i n g detailed study.
Noun suffixes occur only on noun roots, stems, and nominalized themes. The limitations on their occurrence help define noun classes. There are three order classes of noun suffixes and a class of limited occurrence. (Verbal derivational suffixes that can verbalize
202

203

nouns are d i s c u s s e d in 6 - 2 . S u f f i x e s that n o m i n a l i z e verbs are discussed in 7-4.21 and 7 - 4 . 2 2 . )

5-2 5-2.1

Closed Classes of Noun Roots Interrogatives

In all d i a l e c t s , i n t e r r o g a t i v e s u s u a l l y occur followed by the sentence suffix -sa information interrogative with or without intervening suffixes. Interrogatives may also serve as indefinite pronouns when properly suffixed (see 7-4.24). The interrogative roots are

kama - kamisa 1 how1

kawki

'where'

kuna

'what'

k"iti

'who'

qawq"a (and variants) 'how much/how many'

Only the f i r s t and the l a s t show any v a r i a t i o n in the root. The second, third, and last enter into a number of derived formations which display some dialectal variation.

204

5-2.11 5-2.11.1

Variable roots kama ~ kamisa

The only dialect encountered so far having the allomorph /kama/ is Salinas. Elsewhere /kamisa/ occurs. In d i a l e c t s h a v i n g / k a m i s a / , / k a m a - / e x i s t s only as an i n t e r r o g a t i v e verb root in two v e r b s , the f i r s t used to inquire about someone's situation when the answer is expected to be negative and the second used to ask what someone said.

kama.cha.ria -cha verbal derivational/verbalizer

kam.sa.na

sa.na 'to say'

5-2.11.2 qawq"a ~ q"awqa ~ q"awq"a ~ q"ayq"a

/qawq"a/

(La Paz, Huancang, Sitajara)

/q"awqa/

(Morocomarca)

/q"awq"a/

(Huancang, Jopoqueri)

/q"ayq"a/

(Salinas)

*/qayq"a/ +/qayq"a/

(Reported to occur in parts of Ingavi [department of La Paz] and in Chile)
(Bertonio 1603b)

It is possible that the /q"a/ ending certain allomorphs above may consist of /q/ plus -ja 'amount, quantity' (see 5-3.12.3).

205

5-2.12 5-2.12.1

Derived formations Based on kawki 'where'

The following gloss as 'which':

kawk.iri

(La Paz)

kawk.i:ri

(La Paz, Socca, Huancang, Jopoqueri)

kawk.n.iri (La Paz, Juli)

kawk.n.i:ri (La Paz, Juli)

kawk.ch"api (Sitajara)

kawk.p.iri (Socca, Morocomarca)

kawki.p.iri (Morocomarca)

Most of the above are built with the nominalizing suffix -iri, sometimes with vowel length (see 4-3.22.12). The /n/ in t w o of the f o r m s is p r o b a b l y an o c c u r r e n c e of the suffix -na possessive/1ocational (see 5-3.31.2). The suffix -ch"api is of limited d i s t r i b u t i o n . The /p/ which occurs in the last two examples above may be a reduced form of the recurrent partial /-pa-/ related to the 3p possessive suffix -pa which occurs with no discernible 3p meaning in several nouns (see 5 - 3 . 2 4 ) .
The derived forms kawk"a and kayk"a 'what place' are believed composed of the root kawki or *kayki plus

206

the s u f f i x -ja ' q u a n t i t y ' ; * k a y k " a was not found in this r e s e a r c h but is r e p o r t e d to be used in A w a l l a m a y a n e a r Sicasica, department of Oruro.
The common query Kawki.n.k.iri.ta.sa? means 'Where are you f r o m ? ' in La P a z , but e l s e w h e r e it m e a n s 'Where do you usually stay?' or 'Where are you usually?' Hardman (personal communication) found that around Puno and Chucuito it may also mean 'Where have you traveled?' Other similar queries meaning 'Where are you from?' are

Kawki.ta.ta.sa?

(Jopoqueri, Morocomarca. Salinas, Juli)

Kawki.ta.sa?

(Sitajara, HuancanS, Jopoqueri)

Kawki.ta.raki.ta?

(Salinas, Calacala)

Kawki tuqi.ta.sa?

(Socca) tuqi 'around'

5-2.12.2 Based on kuna 'what'

T h e root kuna o c c u r s in several d e r i v e d f o r m s glossing 'why, for what reason', with the complement/ relational suffixes -ru, -ta ~ -t"a, and -taki (and variants) and with the independent suffix -raki (and v a r i a n t s ) , as in

kuna.ru.sa

(La Paz, Sitajara)

207

kuna.ta

(Juli, Salinas)

kuna.t.sa

(Sitajara)

With the suffix -jama 'like' and its variants, kuna g l o s s e s ' h o w ' . In the d i a l e c t s s t u d i e d , t h e s e forms are more common than kamisa or kama 'how'.

(Socca)

kun.ja.sa

(Sitajara)

Another derived form of kuna glossing 'how' is kuna.11a.n.taki.rak (Jopoqueri)

208

kamisa and k u n . j a m a . s a occur in the same c o n t e x t in the following statements:

Kamisa.raki.x uka.x sis.t.pi.y. (Vitocota) 1+3 S
Kun.jama.:.pacha.s uka.x sis.t.wa. (La Paz/Tiahuanaco) 1+3 S
'Whatever will be, will be, I said.'

The following is r e p o r t e d l y said in L l i c a , Potosf (south of Salinas), according to a Salinas source:

*kuna.ri.:na 'how was it?'

Here /ri/ is probably analogous to the /-iri-/ that occurs w i t h R e m o t e t e n s e s in c e r t a i n a r e a s (see 6 - 3 . 3 7 ) . A s i m i l a r form used in Compi in s p e a k i n g to an e l d e r l y l a d y , is

Kun.jam.iritam.s? 3+2 RDK

"How did it affect you?'

Lpa P a z A y m a r a t o d a y has t h e f r o z e n f o r m k u n a y m a n a 'what a lot o f ' , as in

Kunayman ch'ama.mpi.w waw uywa.si.s.k.ta.

difficulty child raise

1+3

S

'What a lot of trouble I had raising my child.'

209

E l s e w h e r e , it translates as 'of all k i n d s , w h a t e v e r . ' A form based on kuna which immediately identifies
the user as belonging to a Protestant sect or as speaking as its members do is kuna.1ayku.ti.xa used to mean 'because' (see 9-5).
kuna is the base for several time interrogatives all glossing 'when'. They include the temporal roots uru 'day', pacha 'time, period', and the Spanish loans u r a s a ( f r o m S p a n i s h h o r a s ' h o u r s ' ) a n d - w s a (a r e d u c e d form of urasa). Examples:

kun.u:ru

(Salinas)

kuna.wru.sa

(Huancang)

kuna pacha.sa

(La Paz, Calacoa, Jopoqueri, Salinas, Morocomarca)

kuna.wrasa.sa

(La Paz, Juli, Socca, Calacoa, Sitajara)

kuna.wsa.raki

(Huancan6)

kuna.ws.pacha.sa

(Huancang)

5-2.12.3 Based on qawq"a (and variants) 'how much/many'

time.

T h i s root c o m b i n e s with pacha in i n q u i r i e s a b o u t

qawq"a pacha 'how many times' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco)

+qayq"a pacha

'how much time' (Bertonio 1603b:183)

+qayq"a pacha.ta 'since when' (Bertonio 1603b)

It may also occur with personal possessive suffixes, as in these examples from H u a n c a n £ .

q"awq"a.pa.sa

'how many of theirs' -pa 3p

q"awq"a.ja.sa

'how many of mine'

/-ja/ Ip

q"awq"a.ma.sa

'how many of your people' (sic) -ma 2p

5-2.2

Demonstratives

Demonstratives are deictic pronouns expressing four degrees of distance. They readily enter into derived f o r m a t i o n s . In noun p h r a s e s t h e y m a y m o d i f y human n o u n s , but their use as pronouns to refer to human beings is usually considered rude.
T h e r o o t d e m o n s t r a t i v e s , p r e s e n t e d in o r d e r of relative proximity to a fixed point (e.g. the s p e a k e r or writer of a s e n t e n c e ) , a r e

aka ~ jaka 'this, here'

uka

'that, there'

k"aya ~ k"a: ~ k"a ~ -k"ayu 'that over there, over there'

211

k"uyu ~ k"u: ~ k"u ~ k"uri

'that way over yonder, way over yonder'

The v a r i a n t / j a k a / o c c u r s in M o r o c o m a r c a , in j a k.s a tuqi.t"a 'around here', but has not been heard elsewhere; /aka/ occurs everywhere. A possible variant of u k a , / u k a y a / , o c c u r s in S i t a j a r a , in u k a y . t i 'is it that?' (See 7-2.21.1 for another analysis of this form.)
In J o p o q u e r i and S o c c a , uwa s o m e t i m e s o c c u r s instead of uka in c o m b i n a t i o n with - t a , s o u n d i n g like [wat]. Hardman has suggested (personal communication) that uwa is probably a r e m n a n t of a p r o t o - J a q i d e m o n s t r a tive *uwa, since the three-way distinction aka - uka - uwa still e x i s t s in m o d e r n Kawki and the r e l a t e d form watqa o c c u r s in J a q a r u .
The base morpheme k"aya reduces to /k"a:/ when acting as m o d i f i e r in a noun phrase (by a regular m o r p h o p h o n e m i c r u l e ; see 4 - 3 . 2 2 . 1 4 ) in the f o l l o w i n g d i a l e c t s : La P a z , J u l i , S o c c a , H u a n c a n e , J o p o q u e r i , and S a l i n a s . In H u a n c a n g , S a l i n a s , and Juli the reduced form with or without vowel length may also occur with complement/ r e l a t i o n a l s u f f i x e s , e . g. in Juli k " a y a . n a ~ k"a.na 'over t h e r e 1 ; in La Paz only the full form o c c u r s with c o m p i e m e n t / r e l a t i o n a l s . In C a l a c o a and S i t a j a r a t h e

212

only form which occurred for this root was /k"a:/. / k " a y u / o c c u r s in Calacala o n l y . / k " u y u / o c c u r s in M o r o c o m a r c a . Two La Paz s p e a k e r s do not r e c o g n i z e / k " u y u / as a d e m o n s t r a t i v e , b u t r a t h e r as t h e 3->-3 S i m p l e tense of the verb k"uyu.na 'to w h i s t l e , to winnow g r a i n ' . HuancanS has both /k"u:/ and /k"uri/; Salinas has both /k"u/ and /k"u:/. Sitajara does not use /k"uri/. Bertonio (1603b) cited +/ku/ (156) and +/kuri/ (225). Ebbing (1965:64) had + / k " u y u / and + / k " u r i / .
It is possible that /k"uri/ is a derived form built of /k"u(yu)/ plus verbalization vowel length plus -iri n o m i n a l i z e r , but if this is the case it has long been a frozen stem, inasmuch as the base /k"uri/ readily takes -:- plus -iri (see below).
The compound form k"a: k"uri 'way way over y o n d e r ' occurs in J u l i , H u a n c a n d , and Calacoa. Huancand has the compound form akawkana, from aka uka.na, meaning 'large community'.

5-2.22 Derived formations

Like the interrogative kawki, all demonstrative

roots may take -:- verbalization plus -iri nominalizer 3
with or without a preceding /-n-/. The only complete

paradigms a v a i l a b l e are for La P a z , as follows:

ak.i:ri

'this one here'

213

uk.i:ri

'that one there'

k"ay.i:ri

'that one over there'

k"ur.i:ri

'that one way over yonder'

ak.n.i:ri

'this one that's closer'

uk.n.i:ri

'that one that's farther away'

k"ay.n.i:ri 'that one over there that's farther away'

k"ur.n.i:ri 'that one way over yonder that's farther away' (Compi)

kuy.n.i:ri 'that one way over yonder' (Tiahuanaco)

Both / u k . i : r i / and / u k a . y r i / o c c u r in H u a n c a n £ (see 4-3.22.13).
aka and uka apparently combine with the suffix -ja ' q u a n t i t y ' in the f o r m s ak"a 'this m u c h ' and uk"a 'that much'. The demonstratives also combine with /-ja/ allomorph of -jama 'like', which is not always distinguishable from -ja 'quantity'. Spelling with " or /j/ is a r b i t r a r y .

ak.ja.naka.ta 'around here' (La Paz) Uta.pa.n uk"a.w. 'His house is there.' (La Paz) uk.ja.ll 'that one' (Sitajara)

214

The following clearly appears to have -ja 'quantity':

uk.ja taqi 'a great deal' (Sitajara)

Expressions of time based on demonstratives include the following:

aka.t q"ipa.ru

(La Paz)

jich"a.t k"a:.ru.x K 'from now on' (Jopoqueri)

jich"a.t k"uy.sa.ru J

(La Paz)

+aka.t.jama.tak

'all of a sudden' (La Paz) (Wexler 1967:455)

Interestingly, k"uy.sa.ru was said by a source who rejected k"uyu as a demonstrative, showing that a dialect may reject a root form but use a derived form.
An expression of space using demonstratives is k"ur.sa.r ak.sa.r 'back and forth' (La Paz). The exp r e s s i o n k"a: a l a x a ' h e a v e n ' is used in C a l a c o a . O t h e r d i a l e c t s have a l a x . p a c h a (or a r a x . p a c h a ) or si 1u (from Spanish cielo) for 'heaven'.
By far the m o s t common d e m o n s t r a t i v e in all dialects is u k a , which occurs alone and in derived formations as a syntactic linker and summarizer.

uka.t 'then, afterwards'

215

uk.jama (uk"ama) 'thus, like that; moreover, also'

uka.mpi.sa

'with that, also'

The last e x a m p l e has quite a d i f f e r e n t m e a n i n g in the lexicon of members of Protestant sects, who use it disjunctively to mean 'but' (see 9-5).
In H u a n c a n g u k a . n a is used as a l i n k e r in s t o r i e s , meaning 'at that', 'then'. It has not been encountered as a linker in other d i a l e c t s .

5-2.3 Personal pronouns

All dialects have four personal pronouns not specific for gender or number. The only one that shows no variation whatever is 2p juma 'you'; the others show minor phonological variations.
Ip 'I/me, we/us but not y o u ' occurs as three allomorphs, /na/, /na:/, and /naya/. The allomorph /na/ occurs in all dialects before -naka plural (see 5 - 3 . 2 5 ) . In o t h e r e n v i r o n m e n t s H u a n c a n g and S i t a j a r a have /na/ and /na:/. Calacoa has /naya/ as well but uses it less than the other a l l o m o r p h s . La Paz has /naya/, /na:/, and /na/, as do the remaining dialects. Juli seems to f a v o r /na/ o v e r the o t h e r t w o . In J o p o queri and Salinas /naya/ occurs before the complement/ relational suffix -ru, and /na/ before the complement/ relational suffix -na. Morocomarca prefers /naya/

216

before those suffixes but has /na:/ as well as /naya/ when unsuffixed.
To s o m e s p e a k e r s of A y m a r a w h o are b i l i n g u a l in Spanish and conscious of the Spanish singular/plural distinction, /naya/, /na:/, and /na/ are always singular, 'I/me1, and na. naka m u s t be used for the plural 'we/us but not y o u 1 . That monolinguals do not make this d i s t i n c t i o n is c l e a r in a n u m b e r of e x a m p l e s , as in the following from a free text recorded in Sitajara from a m o n o l i n g u a l w o m a n o v e r 6 0 . In both c a s e s the o p t i o n a l verb-pluralizing suffix combination -p.xa- occurs on the v e r b ; number c o n c o r d is not r e q u i r e d in A y m a r a .

Alp"a sa.p.x.t na.x. 'We say alfalfa.'

Na.ru.xa rispach.xa.p.x.it ya:sta. 'Dismiss us already.'

3p / j u p " a / o c c u r s in S a l i n a s and M o r o c o m a r c a ; /jupa/ occurs elsewhere.
4p / j i w s a / o c c u r s in C a l a c o a , S i t a j a r a , Surupa (a c o m m u n i t y a c r o s s f r o m S o c c a ) , and is t h e f o r m c i t e d by Bertonio (1603b); /jiwasa/ occurs elsewhere.

Numbers

Variation in number roots is phonological o n l y . Forms derived from numbers show some lexical variation.

217

5-2.41 maya ~ ma: 'one' and paya - pa: 'two'

In all d i a l e c t s maya and paya o c c u r singly or as heads of phrases. Like k"aya and naya, their /ya/ sequences reduce to vowel length form when they occur as m o d i f i e r s , e. g . /ma:/ in ma; uta 'one h o u s e ' ; and as a l r e a d y noted ( 4 - 3 . 2 2 . 1 4 ) , in J o p o q u e r i the vowel length a l l o m o r p h s also occur in compound n u m b e r s .

5-2.41.1 maya ~ ma:

forms.

maya ~ ma: has several derived meanings and In its b a s i c f o r m as m o d i f i e r / m a : / m e a n s ' o n e 1 .

When m o d i f y i n g a pluralized n o u n , it translates as 'some'

(unos in S p a n i s h ) , e. g. maj achachi1 a . n a k a . x 'some old

m e n ' . It may m o d i f y another n u m b e r , as in m a : pa: ch'akura

'some two stakes' (Corque).

maya ~ ma: plus -mpi ~ -nti 'with' has the

meaning 'once more, again'. Allomorphs are regionally

predictable but will be given here to illustrate their

differing phonological shapes, which can cause inter-

d i a l e c t a l c o n f u s i o n . For e x a m p l e , a La Paz speaker

did not recognize the Salinas voiced variant [ma:.ndi]

and resisted accepting it as the equivalent of his

/maya.mpi/.

/maya.mpi/ (La Paz, most other dialects)

/ma:.mpi/

218

/ma:.mpi/ (with optional realization [ma:.mbi]) (Calacala) /ma:.mpi ~ ma:.nti/ (Jopoqueri) /ma:.nti/ [ma:.ndi] (Salinas)
maya also has two derived meanings: 'suddenly, all at once' and 'another, different1, maya 'suddenly' occurs to modify a verb.

Positionals

Positionals are a class of nouns referring to spatial orientation, real and metaphorical. They often occur as heads in phrases with each other and other n o u n s , but all may act as free roots occurring alone. They take -ka- verbalizer (after the suffix -na) but usually do not take vowel length or -pta- verbalizer. Nouns which are semantically positionals but do not readily combine with full members of the class may be considered b o r d e r l i n e m e m b e r s . T h e r e is m o r e d i a l e c t a l v a r i e t y in these b o r d e r l i n e cases than in the six r e g u l a r and one defective positionals which constitute the class proper.

5-2.51 Regular positionals

The six regular positionals are anqa 'outside1

chiqa 'straight(ness), truth'

manq"a ~ manq"i 'inside, below'

pata 'top, altipiano'

q"ipa 'after, behind' (also a temporal; see 5-2.6)

taypi 'middle, midst'

223
These are found throughout the Aymara world. All have a high functional load except anqa. Bertonio cited +manq"a meaning 'inside' and +manq"i meaning 'below' (Bertonio 1603:23). Some present-day dialects have one variant and others the o t h e r . La P a z , J u l i , J o p o q u e r i , Salinas, and Morocomarca have manq"a; Huancand and Sitajara have manq"i; Calacoa has both manq"a and manq"i for 'inside' and manq"a for 'below'.
5-2.52 Defective positional
The defective positional is tuqi-tuqu 'around, in the area o f ' . It is d e f e c t i v e in t h a t it d o e s n o t occur as a m o d i f i e r in p h r a s e s , but only as h e a d , like a clitic on the way to becoming a suffix; but it may also occur alone as a root, /tuqi/ occurs everywhere. The a l t e r n a t e form /tuqu/ occurs in Calacoa (the one instance w a s in a r i d d l e ) and in M o r o c o m a r c a and C a l a c a l a . In Morocomarca only /tuqi/ was acceptable before the suffix -na possessive/locational.

These roots will be listed in alphabetical order with examples of their occurrences and an indication of where they occurred, although their isoglosses are yet to be finally determined.

5-2.6 Temporals''
This important class contains a number of roots and a few root-like recurrent partials referring to segm e n t s of t i m e . In all d i a l e c t s the c l a s s has taken in certain Spanish time words which pattern like the Aymara roots.
5-2.61 Full temporal roots
Full temporal roots may be defined as potentially o c c u r r i n g as heads in p h r a s e s or c o m p o u n d s with jich"a 'now' as m o d i f i e r , or as m o d i f i e r s in p h r a s e s or compounds with uru 'day' as head. These two roots, which occur in all d i a l e c t s , t h e m s e l v e s belong to the class of full t e m p o r a l r o o t s as t h e y o c c u r in t h e c o m b i n a t i o n jich".u:ru as well as in other c o m b i n a t i o n s . Full temporal roots, including those that are Spanish loans, are the f o l l o w i n g (for d i a l e c t a l d i s t r i b u t i o n of n a t i v e A y m a r a temporal roots, see Figures 5-1 and 5-2):
5-2.61.1 Heads with j i c h"a as modifier
alwa < Spanish alba 'dawn', 'early, morning'
arama ~ aruma 'night, morning, period from midnight to dawn, before daylight'

227
arumanti ~ arumant"i 'morning, tomorrow, period from midnight to dawn'
arumarji ~ arumirja 'morning' jaypu ~ ja,yp"u ~ ja.yp'u 'afternoon, evening' mara 'year' p"axsi 'month' g'alta ~ q"alt'i 'morning, tomorrow' (+Bqearlttoani)o 1603b cited ratu < Spanish rato 'while'
o simana < Spanish semana 'week' tarti < Spanish tarde 'afternoon, evening, late' timpu < Spanish tiempo 'time' urasa ~ -wrasa ~ -wsa < Spanish horas 'hours' uru 'day' By a morphophonemic rule affecting nouns with initial /j V/ , j i c h"a may optionally lose its sequence /ji/ (see 4-3.12.1). 5-2.61.2 Modifiers with uru as head chi ka 'halfway, middle' (also borderline positional)
g jich"a ~ juch"a 'now'

228
jurpi ~ jurp"i 'day after tomorrow'
maya 'another' (homophonous with maya 'one')
q'alta ~ q"alt'i 'morning, tomorrow' (Bertonio 1603b cited
+qalta)
q"ara 'tomorrow'
q"ipa 'after' (also a positional)
wasa 'another, other' Forms with uru as head show the operations of the different vowel sequence avoidance rules characteristic of the dialects concerned (see 4-3.22.13). q ' alta ~ q"alt'i 'morning, t o m o r r o w ' is included here since a possibly related /qallt.uru/ 'first day (of m o n t h ) ' o c c u r r e d e m b e d d e d in a noun p h r a s e in La Paz/ Tiahuanaco (see the end of 5-2.64), even though the first two allomorphs were not found to occur before uru. They are also included here because /q"alt'i/ modifies /jurp"i/ 'day a f t e r t o m o r r o w ' and pacha ' t i m e , e p o c h ' in S a l i n a s . 5-2.62 Rootlike recurrent partials
The rootlike recurrent partials that are members of this class occur only as modifiers, in all d i a l e c t s . They are
mar- ~ war- ~ wal- 'two (days) ago' (+ uru)

229

mas- ~ was- 'one (day) ago' (+ jayp'u and uru)

They occur without final vowels, but may be assumed to have final /a/ by analogy with the root wasa, which o c c u r s as a f r e e r o o t in La P a z ; + m a s a w a 'long a g o ' w a s alleged by Bertonio (1603b:50).
The Spanish days of the week have been borrowed into all Aymara dialects* They occur both as heads with j i c h"a as modifier, and as modifiers with uru as head. They also frequently occur as heads modified by alaya 'next' and pas.ir 'last' and as modifiers of alwa, jayp'u, and probably others. The days are

lunisa < lunes

'Monday'

martisa < martes 'Tuesday'

mirkulisa < miCreoles 'Wednesday'

juywisa < jueves

'Thursday'

wirnisa < viernes 'Friday'

sawaru < Scibado 'Saturday'

tuminku < domingo 'Sunday'

The Spanish months of the year have also been borrowed into Aymara everywhere. They usually occur modifying p"axsi 'month', e. g. awril p"axsi 'the month of April'. The months are

Bertonio (1603b:181-182) gave names for the Aymara months

232
which according to V^squez are not months, but rather descriptions of agricultural activities appropriate to different seasons. These do not correspond to fixed m o n t h s , p r o b a b l y b e c a u s e the a g r i c u l t u r a l seasons in the Aymara-speaking world vary widely according to altitude, availability of water, and quality of the soil as well as to annual f l u c t u a t i o n s in rainy and dry cycles within areas. Below are given Bertonio's 'months' and his glosses, followed by V^squez' interpretations.
+chinu p"axsi 'January, month of the ant' chinu p"axsi 'tying month' chinu.na 'to tie' (La Paz)
(Vcisquez suggests this may refer to tying the kipu, the knotted string records kept in ancient times.) +marka p"axsi or+q"ulli.wi p"axsi 'February, month to be in town in order to divide fields into those to lie fallow and those to be plowed'
marka 'town' q"ulli.na 'to plow' q"ulli.wi 'plowing time' (La Paz)
+llupa.llamayu 'March'
llupa.na 'to cover' 11amayu.na 'to hoe'
11amay p"axsi 'hoeing month' (La Paz) +amka.11amayu 'April' (unknown in La Paz)

233
+ i s k ' a wati or +kasi.wi 'May, little hunger' jisk'a awati 'assumption of duties by new team of shepherds sent to herd and cut wool; in some places may occur in January or March' (La Paz) jisk'a 'little1 awati. ria 'to herd' *kasi,wi (unknown)
+jach'a jawti 'June, big hunger' jach'a awtji 'big hunger' (La Paz) jach'a awti 'big drought' (La Paz) jach'a 'big' awtji 'hunger' awti 'drought'
+k"asu lapaqa 'September' lapaqa 'drought caused by the sun' (seguedad del sol) (La Paz) *k"asu (unknown)
+sata.wi lapaqa 'October' sata.w lapaqa 'planting drought' (La Paz) sata.na 'to plant'
+wana chucha 'November' (unknown in La Paz) + u m a chucha 'December' (unknown in La Paz)
uma 'water' (La Paz)

234
+chucha pankata: 'kind of beetle that comes in November and December when there is still drought'
chucha pankataya 'beetle that comes during heavy rains in December' (La Paz)
At least one m i s i n t e r p r e t a t i o n is a p p a r e n t in B e r t o n i o ' s d a t a . In c o n t e m p o r a r y A y m a r a a w a t i is ' h e r d i n g ' , not ' h u n g e r ' , w h i c h B e r t o n i o gives as + j a w t i in + j a c h ' a jawti and w h i c h is awtji in p r e s e n t - d a y La P a z .
Expressing frustration at not being able to elicit names clearly corresponding to the months as Europeans knew them, Bertonio complained
The etymology of these that we have declared is not understood by all the same way; nor do the months begin with the punctuality of ours, because of their lack of sophistication (policia) and knowledge. (Bertonio 1603b:182 ) The Aymaras' detailed knowledge of their agricultural cycle was evidently lost on B e r t o n i o . A small set of native Aymara terms for times of day is the following provided by Vcisquez (La P a z / T i a h u a n a c o ) :
inti tuyta 'eight a.m.' inti 'sun'
jalsu 'six to seven a.m.' (i. e., sunrise)
willjta 'five a.m., when the stars fall'
Bertonio (1603b:185) also gave the term + inti sunaqi.n.kipa.na

235
for 'noon'. Vcisquez indicates this means 'on the top of the head 1 .
The following restricted temporal roots do not enter into noun phrases but instead modify verbs:
anch"ita 'right away' jink"ara (Jopoqueri) - nik"ira (Sitajara) ~ nik"iri
(Socca) ~ nink"ara (Salinas, La Paz) ~ nink"a:ra (La Paz) ~ nink"ra (Morocomarca) 'a while a g o 1 ^ 0 maya ~ may.ti 'all at once' (see 5-2.4) maya.mpi ~ ma.nti 'again' (see 5-2.4) niya ~ na 'already'
wasita (La Paz, Calacoa, Sitajara) ~ wasta (Juli) 'again' (possibly related to wasa)
5-2.64 T e m p o r a l s in combination with nouns of other classes In all d i a l e c t s n o u n s f r o m o t h e r c l a s s e s c o m b i n e
with temporals. Compound forms with the interrogatives kuna and q a w q " a are shown in 5 - 2 . 1 . The d e m o n s t r a t i v e s and the numbers, especially maya ~ ma: 'one' and maya 'another' (which are simultaneously temporals), may also modify temporals.

236

The normal positional q"ipa 'after' and the bord e r l i n e p o s i t i o n a l s chi ka ' h a l f w a y , m i d d l e ' and layra ~ nayra 'before' are simultaneously members of the temporal c l a s s and m o d i f y o t h e r t e m p o r a l s in all d i a l e c t s .
Two verbs nominalized with -iri modify temporals. They are jut.iri 'coming, next' and pas.iri 'last, past' (from S p a n i s h pasa- ' p a s s ' ) , as in t h e f o l l o w i n g . (The examples are from La Paz but probably occur elsewhere as well.)

jut.ir mara

'next year'

jut.ir p"axsi 'next month'

pas.ir lunisa 'last Monday'

pas.ir p"axsi 'last month'

The suffix -kama should also be included in a discussion of temporals (see 5-3.32.1).

5-2.65 Distribution of temporal roots and derived forms

Figures 5-1.1 and 5-1.2 give dialectal distribution and glosses of full root and derived temporals that show v a r i a t i o n , in a l p h a b e t i c a l o r d e r .

certain root and derived temporals. Forms alleged for Juli by Bertonio (1603b) are boxed to set them off from contemporary forms.11 5-2.66 Semantics
Phonologically identical or similar roots with the same meanings across dialects are the Spanish loans and the following:
jaypu ~ jayp"u ~ jayp'u 'evening' jich"a 'now' jink"ara (and variants) 'a little while ago' jurpi ~ jurp"i 'day after tomorrow' pacha 'time, epoch' p"axsi 'month' uru 'day'
Phonologically identical or similar deri ved forms w i t h the same m e a n i n g s a c r o s s d i a l e c t s , in their La Paz versions, are
may.mara ~ miy.mara 'last year' jurp.u:ru ~ 'day after tomorrow' (except in Morocomarca)

241

mas.u:ru ~ was.u:ru 'yesterday'
wal.u:ru 'day before yesterday' (except in Salinas)
As may be seen in Figure 5 - 2 , the s e m a n t i c f i e l d of aruma ~ arama and arumanti still lacks a precise formulation, but certain outlines are clear. The glosses at first seemed b e w i l d e r i n g l y in c o n f l i c t : ' m o r n i n g ' and 'night'. To complicate matters further, aruma means 'orange c o l o r ' in J o p o q u e r i . Two s o u r c e s , one from Morocomarca and the other from Jopoqueri, accepted 'time period from midnight to d a w n ' as a roughly accurate definition of aruma (Morocomarca) and arumanti (Jopoqueri). According to a La Paz s o u r c e , the period begins at bedt i m e : a r u m c h i q a . ru is 'at d u s k ' ( S p a n i s h aj_ a t a r d e c e r ) or 'at n i g h t ' (Spanish por la n o c h e ) . A source in Calacoa said the following:

Aruma.:.w.x.i.w, iki.nta.w.ja.:tan.

3+3 bed

4+3

S

F

'It's already ^ Y J j f t } » l e t ' s g 0 t 0 b e d - '

In La P a z , C a l a c o a , and H u a n c a n £ , a r u m a a l s o m e a n s 'early m o r n i n g , before d a y l i g h t ' as in the f o l l o w i n g :

Aruma.t sara.nani.xa. go 4+3
F

'Let's go early (before it gets light).' (Huancang)

242

The period thus seems to begin after d a r k , approximately

when people retire for the night, and end before dawn,

when they get up. Perhaps it refers to the period when

work is n o r m a l l y s u s p e n d e d ; it is e v i d e n t l y tied to dark-

n e s s . D e p e n d i n g on o n e ' s p o i n t of r e f e r e n c e in t i m e

it may be translated variously.

The root arumanti overlaps the semantic field

of 'tomorrow'. La P a z , Juli and Huancand have both

arumanti and a q"ara form for 'tomorrow'. A g"ara form

was not elicited for Calacoa, which alone of the arumanti

'tomorrow' group also has q'alta for 'morning'. Salinas

and Jopoqueri have q"a 11'i for 'morning' and q"ara forms

for ' t o m o r r o w ' ; in S a l i n a s q"a 11'i also m e a n s ' t o m o r r o w ' .

Salinas and Morocomarca have q"a1t'i for both

'morning' and 'tomorrow' and Huancang has arumanti for

both m e a n i n g s . La Paz has ch"armant"i 'this m o r n i n g '

built on a r u m a n t i , and a r u m a n t i ' t o m o r r o w ' . La Paz and

Huancang also have forms based on q"ara for 'tomorrow'

and La Paz also has arumarji ~ arumirja for 'morning'.

Bertonio (1603b) indicated there were separate terms

+

+

for the two, galta 'morning' and may!1uru 'tomorrow .

In c o n t e m p o r a r y d i a l e c t s f o r m s b u i l t of m a y a plus uru

mean 'another day' rather than 'tomorrow' except in

Sitajara, where the form has both meanings. (It may

also have had both m e a n i n g s in 17th c e n t u r y Juli.)

243
Iri M o r o c o m a r c a q " a r . u : r u m e a n s 'day a f t e r t o m o r r o w ' , the slot filled by the jurpi series elsewhere, and jurp.uru means 'day after day after tomorrow', a semantic slot not elicited for other dialects.
In La Paz q ' a l t a ~ q " a l t ' i w e r e r e j e c t e d , a l t h o u g h a p o s s i b l y related gal 11.uru o c c u r r e d in the p h r a s e mayu p"axs qallt.uru 'the first day of M a y ' (La P a z / T i a h u a n a c o ) . In S a l i n a s a r u m a n t i was r e c o g n i z e d as used e l s e w h e r e but not t h e r e . Not all terms w e r e tested in all a r e a s , so some not shown for a given area may in fact be a c c e p t a b l e there.
5-2.7 Ambiguous noun/verb roots
A few ambiguous noun/verb roots have been identified in this r e s e a r c h . The f o l l o w i n g occur g e n e r a l l y unless otherwise noted:
aru 'word, language; talk, speak'
awati 'herding; herd'
ch"aqa 'lost; lose'
ch'uwa 'transparent, crystalline; be transparent' (said of water, milk)
isi 'clothes; put on clothes'
jacha 'tear; cry'

244
k"ita 'messenger; send a messenger' manq'a ~ mag'a 'food; eat, feed' mink'a 'help; help' (Morocomarca) nink"ara 'a while ago; be a while ago' (La Paz) puq"a 'full; pay a bill (fulfill)' qillqa 'letter; write' ginaya 'cloud; cloud' (La Paz) q"una 'square stone used to grind corn; grind corn' (La Paz) q'ipi 'bundle; carry a bundle on the back'
A special kind of noun/verb root is the syntactic filler inchi, which occurs to fill space while the speaker searches for a word. 1 ? Examples:
Uka.ta.w (inchi) kuna.sa. . . 'Then (uh) what . . .' (Calacoa)
inchi.w.iri.x (Calacoa) -wa- verbal derivational 'distancer' -iri nominalizer
inchi.ru.x (Sitajara) ^rji ' t 0 > a t ' inchi.ta (Calacala) -ta 'of, from'

245

Certain verb roots plus derivational suffixes may act like derived n o u n s . Examples are given in 6 - 2 .

5-3

Noun Suffixes

Noun suffixes o c c u r only on noun r o o t s , noun s t e m s , and nominalized themes. Noun suffix classes are four: a class of limited occurrence and three order classes. Class 1 consists of locationals, diminutives, a possessor/enumerator, personal possessives, and plural. Class 2 consists of complement/relational (case) suffixes and final noun suffixes. Class 3 noun suffixes are the verbal i zers.
Figure 5-3 shows the order classes of noun suffixes. This figure, adapted from my earlier version (Hardman et al. 1975:3.281), shows all noun suffixes and t h e i r a l l o m o r p h s e n c o u n t e r e d in the r e s e a r c h for this study.
For general comments on noun suffix morphophonemics, see 4-2.

5-3.1 5-3.11

Class of limited occurrence Frozen limited suffixes

Frozen suffixes occur most often as recurrent p a r t i a l s f r o z e n in s t e m s t h a t do not o c c u r w i t h o u t t h e m , but some also occur on certain free roots. Their meaning is not usually a p p a r e n t .

5-3.11.1 Kinship markers

Kinship markers are -chi ~ -ch"i ~ -ch'i, -ku, - l a , -ta ~ -tta, and -ya. They occur on kinship terms used in c e r t a i n a r e a s . Both -chi or -ta and -la o c c u r on certain stems, -la always last.

Kinship terms with this partial are

achachi 'grandfather' (Morocomarca, also Bertonio 1603b)

'old man' (Calacoa)

'stupid/dirty old man, old (animal)'

(La Paz)

achachila 'grandfather' (Juli, Calacala, Jopoqueri)

achichi 'stupid old man, old' (Sitajara)

allchi 'grandchild(ren)' (most dialects)

modern Aymara)

248
awkch'i 'father-in-law' (HuancanS, Salinas, Morocomarca; awki occurs there and elsewhere, meaning 'father' or 'old man')
jach'achila 'grandfather' (Morocomarca) jach'a 'big' taykchi 'mother-in-law' (Huancan§) taykch'i 'mother-in-law' (Salinas; tayka occurs there and
elsewhere, meaning 'mother' or 'old woman')

This has occurred only in mamaku 'mother' and tataku ' f a t h e r ' , t e r m s r e p o r t e d l y used t o d a y in the towns of H u a t a j a t a and Janco A m a y a near Compi (La P a z ) ; they were used in Compi d u r i n g the c h i l d h o o d of persons who are now middle-aged. The forms mama ' m o t h e r / m a ' a m ' and tata ' f a t h e r / s i r ' are in general use throughout the Aymara area. 5-3.11.13 -vla.
This occurs as follows: achachi la 'grandfather' (Juli, Calacala, Jopoqueri) ch'animal a 'grandmother' < jach'a mama! a (Jopoqueri)

249
jach'achila 'grandfather' (Morocomarca) jach'attala 'grandfather' < jach'a tatala (Jopoqueri)
jach'a 'large' mama!a 'form of address used by mother speaking to daughter'
(Vitocota) mama!a 'mother' (Calacoa, Morocomarca) jach'a mama!a 'great grandmother' (San Andres de Machaca) jil.ir mamala 'mother's older sister' (Morocomarca) tatala 'form of address used by mother speaking to son'
(Vitocota) tatala 'father' (Calacoa, Jopoqueri, Morocomarca) tatala 'offensive term' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco) Pios tatala 'God the Father' (Torata, Moquegua) tiwula < Spanish tfo 'uncle' (previously used in Compi) tiwula 'fox' (La Paz, Socca, Sitajara, Jopoqueri)

250

tiyala 'sister or female cousin of father' < Spanish tfa (Juli)

tiyula < Spanish tio 'uncle' (Morocomarca)

5-3.11.14

-yma ~ -mma c

This is probably a reduced form of mama 'mother/

m a ' a m ' . It has o c c u r r e d only in J o p o q u e r i , in the f o l l o w -

ing:

jil.ir.may 'father's older brother's wife'

tayp.ir.ma 'father's middle brother's wife'

sullk.ir.ma 'father's younger brother's wife'

pichumma

'father's youngest brother's wife'

This suffix basically requires a previous vowel, but it follows the three-vowel rule (4-3.22.16).

5-3.11.15 - ta ~ -tta c
This is probably a reduced form of tata

'father/

sir'.

ipata 'father's sister' (Jopoqueri) ipa 'aunt'

jach'attala < jach'a tatala 'grandfather' (Jopoqueri)

251 jilata 'brother' (Calacoa, Sitajara, Salinas, Morocomarca)
jila 'brother' (most dialects) jil.ir.ttay 'father's older brother' (Jopoqueri)
jil.iri 'older' (most dialects) larita 'uncle' (Calacoa)
lari 'fox' (Jopoqueri, Salinas, Morocomarca, 'neighbor' (Compi) 'father's brother' (Bertonio 1603b:202)
laritta 'uncle' (Jopoqueri) pichu.r.tta 'father's youngest brother' (Jopoqueri)
pichu.ri 'youngest' (Jopoqueri) sullk.ir.tta 'father's younger brother' (Jopoqueri)
sullka 'younger' (most dialects) tayp.ir.tta 'father's middle brother' (Jopoqueri)
taypi 'middle' (all dialects)

252
The morphophonemics of this suffix are the same as those of -ma ~ -mma. 5-3.11.16 -vya
This suffix occurs on ji1aya 'brother', ji1.ir.may 'father's older brother's wife', and jil.ir.ttay 'father's o l d e r b r o t h e r ' , all used in J o p o q u e r i , and in sullka t a t a . y a 'father's y o u n g e r b r o t h e r ' , used in S o c c a . In the last example it may be an allomorph of lp possessive suffix (see 5-3.24.1).
5-3.12 Nonfrozen limited suffixes The meanings of these suffixes are usually
apparent.
5-3.12.1 ~cchapi ~ -ch"api 'the one which/that'
This suffix does not occur in La P a z . It o c c u r s in H u a n c a n d , S i t a j a r a , and J o p o q u e r i , usually with the aspirated allomorph, on the interrogative kawki, the demonstratives aka and uka, and the derived number may.ni. Examples:
kawk.ch"api.sa 'which, who is that?' (Sitajara) ak.chapi 'this one' (HuancanS) uk.chapi 'that one' (Huancane)

253

may.n.ch"ap.iri

'someone' (Jopoqueri)

The following examples were cited by Bertonio (1603b) and Tschopik (1948):

+kawki.chapi

'which' (Bertonio 1603b:237)

+kawk.ch'ap.iri.sa

'which of us' (Tschopik 1948:110)

*jach'a.chapi

'the large one' (Bertonio 1603b:193)

+jiwa.ta.chapi

'the one that is dead' (Tschopik 1948:110)

+wila.chapi

'the red one' (Bertonio 1603b:192)

(The g l o t t a l i z a t i o n shown on the second e x a m p l e is probably in e r r o r . )
5-3.12.2 -cch'a 'size, extent'
This suffix has occurred on the interrogative qawq"a, the demonstrative uka, and the number maya. It is general in all d i a l e c t s . E x a m p l e s :

qawq"a.ti qawq.ch'a.ti 'however much' (Huancan£) uk.chja.ki,y 'just that size' (La Paz) Uk.ch'a.ki.w. 'That's all.' (story ending, Juli, La Paz)

254
ma: uk.ch'a 'a while' (Jopoqueri)
yat may.ch'a.x 'in some places' (La Paz)
+uk.ch'a.:.n.kama.xa 'meanwhile' (Tschopik 1948:108)
5-3.12.3 -ciiL 'amount, quantity'
This suffix occurs on only a few roots and is difficult to distinguish from a homophonous allomorph of the Class 2 noun suffix -jama 'like', except when it (-ja 'quantity') occurs before a complement/relational suffix (see j a y p ' . j a . r u b e l o w ) . It m u s t also be distinguished from the allomorph /-ja/ of lp possessive and from the verbal derivational suffix -ja- that may v e r b a l i z e noun r o o t s . It m a y be this suffix that occurs in t h e d e r i v e d d e m o n s t r a t i v e s ak"a and uk"a and in the interrogatives kawk"a and qawq"a. It occurs on wali in w a 1 . j a 'a l o t ' , c o n t r a s t i n g w i t h w a l . j a m a ' p r e t t y g o o d ' . Two other e x a m p l e s , on t e m p o r a l s , are jayp'.ja.ru 'in the a f t e r n o o n ' (San A n d r e s de M a c h a c a ) and u r.j a 'by day' (Salinas).
5-3.12.4 ~ckipa 'every other'
In c o n t e m p o r a r y La Paz A y m a r a , this suffix o c c u r s only on n u m b e r s , as in m a y . k i pa 'every other o n e ' , pay.kipa 'every other t w o ' . It may be identical with the homophonous verbal derivational suffix meaning 'action

255

around the e d g e , past a p o i n t , back and f o r t h 1 which is known to verbalize one noun root (see 6-2.15.1), although the verbal suffix has different morphophonemics, requiring a p r e c e d i n g v o w e l . B e r t o n i o (1 6 0 3 b : 1 7 2 - 1 7 3 ) c i t e d -ki pa on numbers and on the following forms which are unacceptable in La Paz today:

+qayq"a.kipa.n.ki,s 'how far back in line'

(qawq"a.n.k.k.i.s means 'how far back in line' in

La Paz today)

+nayra.kipa 'second in line'

+pani.kipa 'third in line'

5-3.12.5 -:ka 'general location' This suffix occurs only on the demonstratives
a k a , u k a , and k"aya in La P a z . It also o c c u r r e d once in S o c c a on a k a . It w a s n o t f o r m a l l y e l i c i t e d nor did it occur spontaneously e l s e w h e r e . Possibly a reduced form of aka, it lessens the preciseness of a location. The following examples are from La P a z / C o m p i .

aka.:ka.n sar.naqa.s.ka.:na 3+3 RDK

'he was going around here'

k"aya.:ka.n 'around there'

256

uka.:ka.n 'around there' *k"uri.:ka.n (rejected) The f o l l o w i n g p a i r , the s e c o n d with - : k a , o c c u r r e d in Socca.

Aka.n.ka.s.ka.ki.ya:.wa. 'I'll be here in this place.' 1+3 F
Aka. :ka.n.ka.s.ka.ki.ya:.wa. 'I'll be around here.'

5-3.12.6 -: k"a 'through'

Only one example of the suffix :k"a 'through' has o c c u r r e d , in u t a . : k " a ' t h r o u g h t h e h o u s e ' in M o r o comarca, where neither the combination /-n.jama/ nor /-na.ma/ 'through' occurs (see 5-3.32.3). It may perhaps consist of -:ka 'general location' plus /-ja/ allomorph of -jama 'like'.

5-3.12.7

~ v l a y k u ~ -rayku 'on a c c o u n t of' c

/ - r a y k u / o c c u r s in M o r o c o m a r c a , / - l a y k u / elsew h e r e . In m o s t d i a l e c t s u s e of this s u f f i x in a q u e s t i o n implies perplexity and annoyance on the part of the questioner, e. g. ,

Kuna.layku.s jut.ta? 'Whatever possessed you to come?'

what

come 2+3

S

257

Statements with this suffix do not usually have the strong emotional overtone of the q u e s t i o n , as in

Manu.layku.w jut.ta. 'I came because of a debt.'

debt

1+3

S

Missionary Aymara uses the term kuna.1 ayku.ti.xa 'because' (see 9-5).
This suffix follows the three-vowel rule (4-3.22.16).

5-3.12.8

-ypura c

'between, among'

(reciprocal)

This suffix occurs primarily on human nouns.

warmi.pura 'among women' (La Paz)

mimill waw.pura.tan 4+3 S

'we're just women' (Sitajara) mimilla 'girl' wawa 'child'

Jupa.nak.pura.ki.w. 'They're just by themselves.' 3p

Bertonio used this suffix with body parts, as in +na.yra. pura 'both e y e s ' , but in p r e s e n t - d a y La Paz this is rejected in f a v o r of using the frozen stem purapa 'both' (see 5-3.24) as a modifier, e. g. purap kayu 1 both feet'.

258
This suffix follows the three-vowel rule (4-3.22.16). 5-3.12.9 -vqata
This suffix is known to occur on only two roots: nayra 'before' and sapa 'only'. The stem nayra.qata 'in front o f ' is used in La P a z , J o p o q u e r i , and p r o b a b l y e l s e w h e r e . T h e stem s a p a . q a t a 'each o n e ' o c c u r s in La Paz. 5 - 3 . 1 2 . 1 0 -vr_a ' t h r o u g h '
Like - : k " a , -ra is a suffix occurring in only one d i a l e c t , in this case J o p o q u e r i , with the meaning 'through'.
uta.ra.n 'through the house' 5-3.12.11 -yrara intensifier
In La Paz this suffix o c c u r s as in the f o l l o w i n g :
laq'a.rara 'covered with earth' lag'a 'earth' lichi.rara 'spotted with milk' 1ichi 'milk' qala.rara 'covered with stones' gala 'stone' In Irpa C h i c o , p r o v i n c e of I n g a v i , La P a z , it o c c u r r e d in t h e s e e x a m p l e s cited by M a r t i n ( 1 9 6 9 : 3 4 ) .

+niq"i.rara 'very muddy' niq"i 'mud' +k"uchi.rara 'very dirty' k"uchi 'pig'

5 - 3 . 1 2 . 1 2 - y w i sa ~ ~ v w i su 'without'
T h i s s u f f i x is no l o n g e r p r o d u c t i v e in a n y d i a l e c t i n v e s t i g a t e d for this s t u d y , a l t h o u g h in B e r t o n i o ' s time it apparently was (Bertonio 1603b:214,215). Its use is now taken o v e r by jani n e g a t i v e plus the p o s s e s s o r / e n u m e r a t o r suffix - n i , as in jan nasa.ni 'without a nose'. Today the only forms attested with -wisa are for Compi and T i a h u a n a c o : j i nchu.wi sa 'hard of h e a r i n g ' and nayra.wi sa 'having bad e y e s i g h t ' (which would not be said within earshot of the person referred to, as they would be c o n s i d e r e d r u d e ) and j a y u . w i sa 'lacking s a l t ' , -wi sa o c c u r s in T i a h u a n a c o , -wi su in C o m p i .

Class 1 suffixes Locationals

I have described locational suffixes elsewhere (Hardman et al. 1975:3.287-290). No special effort was m a d e to e l i c i t them in this s t u d y , and no v a r i a t i o n s in their o c c u r r e n c e s were n o t e d . They are ~csa. ' s i d e ' , ~ckata ~ -kati 'across', -ywja 'place', - jita 'exactly in a p l a c e ' , - xa^ ' o v e r , o n ' , and -: xa ' b e s i d e ' .

260
5-3.22 Diminutives
The f o l l o w i n g d i m i n u t i v e s have occurred in this research: - c h a , -ilia ~ - 1 1 a , - i t a , -i tu , and - s i t u . The last three are clearly Spanish loans; -ilia ~ -11a may be. The first two and -itu are fully productive, -ita is less s o , and -situ occurs only f r o z e n in stems but is included here because of its structural and semantic closeness to the others. The diminutives do not usually co-occur with the locationals.
5-3.22.1 -vcha This s u f f i x , which may be related to the Jaqaru
-cha l i m i t a t i v e (Hardman 1 9 6 6 : 8 7 ) , o c c u r s in Calacoa and Huancand on any noun that is limited or qualified as smal1.
uka.cha.x 'then1 (Huancane) marka.cha 'little town' (Calacoa) nasa.cha 'little nose' (Calacoa) It is used on kinship terms and in f o r m s of a d d r e s s as a mark of affection and/or courtesy. tiyu.cha.ja 'my uncle' (Calacoa) quii suma.cha mama 'dear good lady' (Huancang) jisk'a lluqalla.cha 'little boy' (Calacoa)

261

It may occur with o t h e r d i m i n u t i v e s , as in the f o l l o w i n g , which has -cha followed by -itu reduced to /ch.tu/ by the three-vowel rule (see 4-3.22.16).

papa.ch.tu.ja 'my daddy' (Huancan£)

5-3.22.2

V 11 a ~ -V1 f l l a

/ - 1 1 a / d i m i n u t i v e , w h i c h o c c u r s in H u a n c a n e , Sitaj a r a , C o r q u e , J o p o q u e r i , and S a l i n a s , is to be disting u i s h e d from / - 1 1 a / Ip p o s s e s s i v e w h i c h o c c u r s in V i t o cota and from /-11a/ allomorph of -ya ~ -11a politive final ( s e n t e n c e ) s u f f i x , w h i c h o c c u r s in some of the dialects that have /-11a/ diminutive. Both the diminutive /-11a/ and the final suffix /-11a/ may occur on the same s t e m , and they are c l e a r l y d i s t i n c t in m e a n i n g .

/-ilia/ has occurred in the speech of one source from Salinas who also uses / - 1 1 a / , but the latter is m o r e c o m m o n . It m a y r e d u p l i c a t e for e m p h a s i s . A s p e a k e r from J o p o q u e r i used both pi sag.i ta and pi saga.11a 'little p a r t r i d g e ' in the same s t o r y . Other e x a m p l e s :

Uk.jama.11a.ki.w. 'It's just like so.' (Salinas)

may.ilia 'just one little one' (Salinas)

S i k ' a . H a . H a . w a . 'It's tiny.' (Salinas) sik'a 'little'

Jisk'a.lla.ki.w.

'It's very small.' (Huancane) jisk'a 'little'

262
jamach'i.11a 'little bird' (Salinas)
jila.11a.naka 'brothers' (Corque)
ta.yka.11a 'little old lady' (Salinas)
5-3.22.3 -cita
This suffix is the borrowed Spanish d i m i n u t i v e - i t a . It o c c u r s i n f r e q u e n t l y and u s u a l l y o n l y in f r o z e n f o r m s s u c h as m a m i t a ' m o t h e r ' (a t e r m of e n d e a r m e n t u s e d to one's own m o t h e r ) . It also occurs on a few roots ending in / a / .
kullak.ita 'little sister' (Calacoa) kullaka 'sister' nas.ita 'little nose1 (Salinas) nasa 'nose'
pi sag.ita 'little partridge' (Jopoqueri) pi saga 'partridge'
5-3.22.4 -c itu This suffix is the borrowed Spanish d i m i n u t i v e
- i t o . It is not used in Calacoa but is elsewhere more productive than -i t a , occurring on nouns w i t h o u t regard to the g e n d e r of the r e f e r e n t , as in t a w a q . i t u 'young w o m a n ' ( J u l i ) , a l t h o u g h in this case the choice of -itu rather than -ita may be influenced by the fact that the root tawaqu ends in / u / .

263
5-3.22.5 - v s i tu This is a variant of - i t u , from Spanish - c i t o .
It occurs rarely, like -i ta, and appears frozen to the roots on which it o c c u r s , which are all kinship or age terms.
papa.situ 'father, daddy' < Spanish papacito (La Paz) allchi.situ 'grandchild' (Huancand) awki.situ 'little old man' (Juli)
5-3.23 ~vJli possessor/enumerator This s u f f i x is in general use in all a r e a s .
The f o l l o w i n g is a s u m m a r y and r e v i s i o n of my e a r l i e r treatment (Hardman et al. 1975:3.291-294). The semantics of -ni are f u r t h e r d i s c u s s e d in 8 - 2 . 2 4 . 5-3.23.1 -ni possessor
The suffix -ni turns a noun into a possessor of t h a t n o u n , e x c e p t as noted in 5 - 3 . 2 3 . 2 . A noun stem with -ni may be verbalized with the verbal derivational suffix -cha causative as well as by -:- verbalizer.
qui1qi.ni 'one who has money' qullqi.n.cha.na 'to make someone win' (La Paz)

264
The negative jani modifying a noun with -ni means 'witho u t 1 , as in j an chacha.ni 'without a h u s b a n d ' ( J o p o q u e r i , La Paz).
5-3.23.2 -ni enumerator
-ni is used in f o r m i n g c e r t a i n n u m b e r s , for c o u n t ing, and when the following classes of nouns are used with reference to human beings: numbers, quantity nouns (such as t a g i ' a l l ' , t a g . p a c h a ' a l l ' , w a l . j a 'a l o t , m u c h , m a n y ' , a n d j u k ' a 'a f e w ' ) , or t h e i n t e r r o g a t i v e q a w q " a 'how m u c h , how many'.
5-3.24 Personal possessives
There are four personal possessive suffixes corresponding to the four personal pronouns (5-2.3) and occurring on the item p o s s e s s e d . All refer exclusively to human possessors except the third p e r s o n , which is unmarked for human or nonhuman (i. e., it may refer to human or nonhuman possessors, animate or inanimate).
There is no phonemic variation in the morphemes of 2p, 3p, and 4p, which correspond to the last syllable of the corresponding personal pronoun: 2p - m a , 3p - p a , and 4p - s a . H o w e v e r , as a l r e a d y indicated in 3 - 4 . 3 2 , there is c o n s i d e r a b l e v a r i a t i o n in the allom o r p h s of Ip. The 3p suffix is u n i q u e in that it o c c u r s frozen in certain s t e m s .

The i n t e n d e d m e a n i n g is 'our (4p) h o u s e 1 . How w i d e s p r e a d this c o n v e r g e n c e may be is not known at this t i m e .
5-3.24.3 Frozen 3p suffix -pa
The 3p suffix -pa is frozen in certain s t e m s , most of them containing base forms which may occur independently as noun roots but may not take other personal p o s s e s s i v e s u f f i x e s . In two cases the base forms w i t h o u t -pa occur as noun suffixes rather than as roots. Below, the base forms are given first.

5-3.24.4 Morphophonemics of personal possessive suffixes
In m o s t d i a l e c t s the m o r p h o p h o n e m i c s of p e r s o n a l possessive suffixes are variable (see 4-5.3 and below).
In S i t a j a r a 4p -sa a l w a y s t a k e s a p r e c e d i n g cons o n a n t in a m a n n e r a n a l o g o u s to the shape of the 4p pronoun in t h a t d i a l e c t , j i w s a , and the o t h e r t h r e e p e r s o n a l possessives require a preceding consonant when occurring on certain forms nominalized with -ta (see 7-4.21.3).
In M o r o c o m a r c a the f o u r p e r s o n a l p o s s e s s i v e suffixes require a preceding consonant unless a stem-final c o n s o n a n t cluster would thereby r e s u l t , in which case the suffixes require a preceding vowel. That is, allomorphs requiring a preceding vowel occur in zero c o m p l e m e n t s (see 5 - 3 . 3 3 ) and in the case of lp and 2p s u f f i x e s , in

269

m o d i f i e r s of o t h e r n o u n s . In both c a s e s the vowel restored before the possessive suffix prevents the occurrence of a stem-final consonant cluster. Examples:

Subject:

Yap.na jaya.n.k.i.wa.

lp

3+3

S

'My field is far away.'

Zero complement:

Yapu.n0 sata.ni.:. Tp plant 1+3 F

'I'm going to plant my field.'

M o d i f i e r in noun p h r a s e :

Tatala.fi yap.pa.wa.

Tp

3p

'It's my father's field.'

('my father his field')

Tatala.m yap.pa.wa. 'It's your father's field.'

Zp

3p

('your father his field')

Modifiers with 3p or 4p as the final morpheme do not o c c u r in this c o n t e x t in M o r o c o m a r c a .
*Tatala.p yap.pa.wa. 3p
*Tatala.s yap.pa.wa. ¥

270

If the possessive suffix -na (see 5-3.31.2) follows the lp or 2p suffix in M o r o c o m a r c a , the vowel before the personal possessive drops by the regular morphophonemic rule for personal possessives.

Tatal.na.n yap.pa.wa. 'It's my father's field.' lp

Tata!.ma.n yap.pa.wa. 2p

'It's your father's field.'

Tatal.pa.n yap.pa.wa. 3p

'It's his/her father's field.'

Tatal.sa.n yap.pa.wa. 4p

'It's our father's field.'

The order of the rules and the conditioning may be stated as follows.

Zero complement 1. yapu + ~cposs. --> yap.na
yap.ma yap.pa yap.sa
2. yap.na + zero complement —> *yap.n0
3. *yap.n + vowel restoration --> yapu.fi

In C a l a c a l a , J o p o q u e r i , and S a l i n a s p e r s o n a l possessive suffixes may take a preceding consonant unless a final consonant cluster would thereby result, but they often take a preceding vowel even though no cons o n a n t c l u s t e r w o u l d o t h e r w i s e o c c u r . In o t h e r w o r d s , in those dialects there seems to be some free variation in the m o r p h o p h o n e m i c s of the s u f f i x e s , except when avoidance of final consonant clusters is a factor.
In H u a n c a n 6 p e r s o n a l p o s s e s s i v e s u f f i x e s r e q u i r e a preceding vowel on two-vowel nouns but a consonant on nouns or noun stems having more than two vowels. That is, the three-vowel rule operates before personal possessives. The examples are all of single noun subjects; what happens when the nouns lose their final vowels as zero complements or modifiers is not known. Examples:

kuritu.ja 'my story' < Spanish cuento awich.ja 'my grandmother' awicha 'grandmother'

272

sa.sa

'none of his clothes were good, nor was his appearance

attractive, saying'

isi

'clothes'

un.naga 'appearance'

In s t e m s f r o z e n w i t h 3p -pa (see a b o v e ) the m o r phophonemics of the personal possessive vary, some forms having -pa with a preceding consonant, some with a preceding vowel. A relic of a rule of vowel loss before possessives, with no final consonant-cluster avoidance, is found in a term used in La Paz for the Virgin M a r y .
Tayk.£ Mariya.x 'Our Mother Mary' tayka 'mother'

In M o r o c o m a r c a , the /n/ of lp / - n a / m a y be r e a l i z e d as [rj] (a p a l a t a l i z e d v e l a r n a s a l ) in c e r t a i n e n v i r o n m e n t s , and in C a l a c a l a the /p/ of 3p -pa m a y be realized as the voiced labial fricatives [v] or [b]; these alternations result from phonologically-conditioned morphophonemic rules (see 4-3.21.2 and 4-3.21.32).
5-3.25 -ynaka plural
This suffix occurs in all d i a l e c t s . As indicated in 5 - 2 . 3 , n u m b e r is not o b l i g a t o r i l y m a r k e d in A y m a r a . In the speech of m o n o l i n g u a l s , plural may be m a r k e d on

273

some, all, or none of the following: a verb subject, a verb complement, or the verb itself (with the suffix -p- alone or in the c o m b i n a t i o n s / - p . k a - / , / - p . j a - / , or /-p.xa-/; see 6-2.26). Absence of a plural mark does not mean singular in A y m a r a .
Writers of Aymara grammars frequently maintain t h a t p l u r a l is a c a t e g o r y in t h e l a n g u a g e , i n s i s t i n g that regular and consistent use of -naka and the verb p l u r a l i z e r is the n o r m . It is t r u e that b i l i n g u a l s translating from Spanish into Aymara tend to reflect S p a n i s h p l u r a l s in A y m a r a , but m o s t p l u r a l c o n c o r d in the speech of b i l i n g u a l s is m e r e l y e v i d e n c e of syntactic borrowing from the d o m i n a t i n g l a n g u a g e . As shown in the following examples from the speech of a monolingual from S i t a j a r a , such r e g u l a r i t y is not n a t i v e l y A y m a r a ; r a t h e r , -naka is used as an optional e m p h a t i c or i n t e n s i f i e r .
In the f i r s t e x a m p l e -naka o c c u r s on the s u b j e c t , but there is no plural mark on the verb.

A1p"irawu.naka.w alferado

Uka.t uka piwuna.naka.x ya uka chicha.mpi.x

tunu.r.i.w. 'Then those peones (workers) feel strengthened

strength 3+3

S

274

In the f o l l o w i n g , -naka is a b s e n t but there is plural in t r a n s l a t i o n :
pi.yuna.tay 'for the workers'
Sometimes two parts of a sentence will be marked for plural.

Na.naka.ru.x sirwi.p.x.it. 'Serve us.'

lp

serve 2+1

I

(See also the examples in 5 - 2 . 3 , 6 - 2 . 2 6 , and 8 - 2 . 4 . ) The suffix -naka usually occurs before the per-
sonal p o s s e s s i v e s u f f i x e s if both o c c u r on a s t e m , but in Calacoa the opposite order is more c o m m o n , e. g . ,

wawa.ja.naka.x 'my children' (Calacoa)

wawa.naka.ja.x 'my children' (La Paz)

Both orders are acceptable everywhere, however.

5-3.3 Class 2 suffixes

Class 2 consists of five complement/relational s u f f i x e s , t h r e e final noun s u f f i x e s , and zero complement vowel l o s s . T h e y a r e g e n e r a l in all A y m a r a d i a l e c t s , w i t h minor phonological variations.
The suffixes -mpi ~ -nti (complement/relational) and -pacha (final noun) have two positions of occurrence

275
each and different meanings associated with the positions, but (as in the case of -ni p o s s e s s o r / e n u m e r a t o r , 5 - 3 . 2 3 ) they are considered one suffix each, rather than two homophonous suffixes, because only one -mpi ~ -nti or -pacha may occur on one stem. The positions of occurrence are discussed below under each suffix.
5-3.31 Compiement/relationals
These suffixes are (in alphabetical order)
-mpi — n t i conjoiner/accompanier/agentive/instrumental
-na possessive/locational
-ru directional 'to, at'
-ta ~ -t"a directional 'of, from'
-taki — t a k " i ~ -tay beneficiary/purposive
Except for -mpi ~ -nti, which as conjoiner or accompanier may precede any of the others, the complement/relational suffixes do not co-occur on one stem. (Some co-occurrence is possible on a noun theme that has been verbalized and then renominalized.)
These suffixes have case functions. Each may occur to mark a complement of the verb inflection suffix (see 6-3) or to mark the relations of other nouns to the verb stem or to some other part of the sentence.

276

The special nature of these suffixes is reflected

in t h e i r m o r p h o p h o n e m i c s . U n l i k e m o s t o t h e r noun s u f f i x e s

of general occurrence, whose morphophonemics do not vary 13
from one dialect to another, two of the complement/

r e l a t i o n a l s , -na and -taki ~ - t a k " i ~ - t a y , vary in pre-

ceding morphophonemics, and all of the compiement/relationals

control the loss or retention of their own final vowels

except before consonant-requiring final noun suffixes or

the sentence suffixes -11a - -ya or -:-. The reason for

t h i s is t h a t final v o w e l - r e t e n t i o n and - d r o p p i n g r u l e s

that are syntactically conditioned, identifying subjects

and direct objects (zero complements) of verbs or modi-

f i e r s in noun p h r a s e s , do not a p p l y to stems or t h e m e s

ending in the c o m p i e m e n t / r e l a t i o n a l s , the case r e l a t i o n s

expressed by the latter being in c o m p l e m e n t a r y distribu-

tion with the case or order relations expressed by the

f o r m e r . T h a t is, a stem ending in a c o m p l e m e n t / r e l a t i o n a l

suffix cannot also be simultaneously a s u b j e c t , modifier

of a head of a noun phrase, or a zero complement. The

one exception to this rule is -mpi ~ -nti which as con-

joiner or accompanier may occur on a subject or zero

compiement.

5-3.31.1

~vmpi ~ -nti conjoiner/accompanier/agentive/ i nstrumental

This morpheme has two base allomorphs. /-mpi/ o c c u r s in La P a z , J u l i , S o c c a , H u a n c a n e , C a l a c o a , S i t a j a r a ,

277

J o p o q u e r i , M o r o c o m a r c a , and C a l a c a l a . / - n t i / o c c u r s in Jopoqueri, Salinas, Morocomarca, and Calacala. Voiced a l l o m o r p h s occur by o b l i g a t o r y m o r p h o p h o n e m i c rule in S a l i n a s and o p t i o n a l l y in Sitajara and C a l a c a l a . Dialects that have both /-mpi/ and /-nti/ use them interchangeably; through the influence of La Paz, /-mpi/ may be driving out /-nti/ in d i a l e c t s that have it.
Examples of this suffix on the number maya ~ ma: 'one' were given in 5 - 2 . 4 . Additional examples:

kuna.mpi.sa 'with what'

k"iti.mpi.sa 'with whom'

Use of both /-mpi/ and /-nti/ by the same speaker in one s e n t e n c e o c c u r s in the f o l l o w i n g :

In C a l a c o a / - m p i / loses its final vowel b e f o r e nonfinal independent -raki and final sentence suffix -sa. Elsewhere the suffix keeps its final vowel except before consonant-requiring final noun suffixes. It usually loses its final vowel word-finally. Calacoa examples:

ma:.mp.raki 'again'

Kuna.mp.s manq'.sna ch'unu?

An example with /-mpi/ occurring as conjoiner on two subj e c t s , the second preserving the final stem v o w e l , is the following sentence from La Paz/Compi:

Juma.mp naya.mpi.x sara.hani. 'Let's you and me go.'

2p — lp

4+3

Examples of /-mpi/ conjoiner followed by zero comp l e m e n t are found in 4 - 3 . 3 2 . 2 .

5-3.31.2 -na possessive/1ocational

The morphophonemics of this suffix vary dialectic a 1 1 y .

(Calacoa)

/-ynav/ locational

(Calacoa) (before final suffix -sa)

280

/-vna / possessive and locational (elsewhere)

As may be seen above, the most common form of this suffix is that requiring a preceding vowel and dropping its own vowel in all e n v i r o n m e n t s . In Socca and Calacoa the possessive and locational functions are distinguished by m o r p h o p h o n e m i c s ; in Juli two a l l o m o r p h s s e r v e as possessive, but only one of them serves as locational. -na keeps its final vowel before the final sentence suffix -sa in C a l a c o a and when p r e c e d e d by c o n s o n a n t in Juli; elsewhere it loses its final vowel in all environments. Examples:

papa.situ.j.na kullaka.pa "my father's sister' (Juli)

A limited use of -na locational is that on certain noun stems verbalized with the verbal derivational causative -cha- (6-2.11).
Finally, it may be -na that occurs on kawki and the demonstratives, requiring a preceding consonant (see 5-2.1 and 5-2.2).

5 - 3 . 3 1 . 3 -ylii directional 'to, at'

Like -na and -mpi ~ -nti the suffix -ru has variable morphophonemics. Everywhere it requires a preceding vowel, but the behavior of its own vowel varies. It loses its final vowel before the final sentence suff i x e s -sa and -xa in C a l a c o a and T o r a t a ( M o q u e g u a ) . In Socca and Sitajara it may either keep or lose its final vowel before those two suffixes. Elsewhere it keeps its

282

own vowel except before consonant-requiring final noun s u f f i x e s . It u s u a l l y loses its vowel w o r d - f i n a l l y . Examples:

5-3.31.4 -vta ~ -t"a directional 'from, of' The a l l o m o r p h /-t"a/ occurs in J u l i , H u a n c a n g ,
Calacoa, Sitajara, Jopoqueri, Salinas, and Morocomarca,

283

and is the form reported by Bertonio (1603b) and Tschopik ( 1 9 4 8 ) . Only / - t " a / o c c u r s in S i t a j a r a , S a l i n a s , and M o r o c o m a r c a .

Everywhere this suffix requires a preceding vowel. It keeps its final vowel before the independent nonfinal suffix -raki in H u a n c a n e .

When the verbal derivational suffix -rapi-

occurs on a verb s t e m , the complement is a beneficiary

286

of the action, and if that complement is expressed by a noun in the s e n t e n c e , it is suffixed with -taki ~ -tak"i - t a y . If there is no -rapi in the verb s t e m , the verb c o m p l e m e n t is not a b e n e f i c i a r y , but t h e r e may be a noun marked by -taki ~ -tak"i ~ -tay expressing a goal or purpose of the action.

'He picked up a stick for me (i. e. to hit me with).' (La Paz)

Here naya lp is not the complement of the verb i n f l e c t i o n ,

which is 3+3

but rather is the goal of the action.

The foregoing example was inspired by an example in Bertonio ( 1 6 0 3 b : 2 9 4 ) which was intended to have the above meaning but has -rapi- verbal derivational suffix on the verb. For contemporary speakers, this makes the /-taki/ complement the beneficiary, changing the meaning of the sentence to 'He picked up a stick on my behalf'. That i s , -rapi- always implies a b e n e f i c i a r y in Aymara today. It seems unlikely that the meaning has shifted since the 17th century; rather, Bertonio's translation was probably in e r r o r .

Additional examples of /-taki/ and /-tay/ are the following:

Na.tay.wa. 'It's for me.' (Sitajara)

Jiwas.taki.wa. 'It's for us (4p).' (Huancane)
kuna.taki.rak ~ kun.taki.rak 'what for' (Compi)
Occurrences of -taki ~ -tak"i ~ -tay on stems ending in -na n o m i n a l i z e r (the p u r p o s i v e s u b o r d i n a t o r ) are discussed in 7 - 4 . 2 1 . 2 3 .

5-3.32 Final Class 2 suffixes

The last suffixes to occur on a noun stem or theme before verbalization, if a n y , are -kama aggregate/ a t t a i n e r , -pacha 'all, s a m e ' , -jama ' l i k e ' , and zero complement vowel drop (which may not be followed by verbalization).
-kama may occur before the compiement/relationals but usually does not. -pacha may occur before all compiement/relationals except -mpi ~ -nti, and its meaning is tied to its position of o c c u r r e n c e , -jama may follow -kama on a stem, but not vice versa, -pacha has not co-occurred with either -kama or -jama except on the stems frozen with -jama: ak"ama and uk"ama.

5-3.32.1

-ykama aggregate/attainer c

This suffix means 'among, all, each' on human n o u n s , as in w a r m i . k a m a 'among w o m e n ' . On n o n h u m a n , inanimate nouns -kama refers to spatial and temporal o r i e n t a t i o n . An e x a m p l e of spatial o r i e n t a t i o n is the following from La Paz/Tiahuanaco:

Juli.mpi.r

Ch'uqi.yap.kama.mpi.ru.w

pur.i. 3+3 S

'He arrived as far as Juli and Chuquiago.'

Usually, however, -kama occurs after the complement/relational

289

s u f f i x e s -mpi ~ - n t i , - r u , e t c . , as in t h e f o l l o w i n g e x a m p l e from La P a z / C o m p i :

Ch'uqi.yapu.r.kama.ki.w. 'It's just as far as Chuquiayago.'

This suffix occurs with temporal orientation on time words and nominalized verbs, most often as a form of leave-taking with the prospect of another meeting.

arumant.kama

'until tomorrow' (La Paz, HuancanS) •A

may.ur.kam

jiki.si.n.kama 'until (we) meet again' (La Paz)

*jich"a.kama.sa 'until now' (Tschopik 1948:113) In S a l i n a s the v a r i a n t / - k a : m a / was h e a r d , but this m a y have been paralinguistic: ratu.ka:ma 'so long'.
-kama is subject to the three-vowel r u l e .
5-3.32.2 ~cpacha 'all, same'

This suffix was originally considered two separate homophonous suffixes because it has different meanings in two positions of o c c u r r e n c e . When it occurs before the c o m p i e m e n t / r e l a t i o n a l s it means 'all';

290
when it occurs after t h e m , it means 'the same, the v e r y , itself'. However, it never co-occurs with itself, and when it occurs without a complement/relational, it may have either meaning or may act as an intensifier of the meaning of the root it occurs on.
This suffix must be distinguished from the verbal i n f l e c t i o n - p a c h a 3->3 I n f e r e n t i a l and f r o m t h e r e s t r i c t e d temporal root pacha 'time, epoch' (5-2.6). The frozen stem pachpa 'same' is evidence that -pacha suffix was once a root. The suffix -pacha may occur on certain temporal roots (but not on p a c h a ) .
mar.pacha 'all year, the same year1 (La Paz)
ur.pacha 'by daylight' (La Paz)
An example of a temporal root plus pacha 'time, epoch' is q"a 11'i pacha 'in the m o r n i n g ' ( S a l i n a s ) , in w h i c h the vowel of the modifier is r e t a i n e d .
Other examples of -pacha suffix are
pug".pacha 'full up' (Salinas)
laka.r.pach laka.r.pach 'gasping for breath' (Corque) mouth to
In J u l i , La P a z , and C a l a c o a - p a c h a o c c u r s on naya ~ na: lp p r o n o u n , meaning 'myself'; elsewhere it

291

is rejected in that c o n t e x t , -pacha occurs frozen on the roots taqi 'all' and 1iju 'all' in stems having the same meaning: tag.pacha and 1 ij.pacha, which then act as roots, taking Class 1 noun suffixes.
5-3.32.3 - jama (and variants) 'like'
This suffix has a number of different allomorphs in d i f f e r e n t d i a l e c t s . It occurs on all c l a s s e s of noun r o o t s , s t e m s , and nominalized t h e m e s . It is unique among the noun s u f f i x e s in o c c u r r i n g on the n o m i n a l i z e r s u b o r d i nating suffixes -iri, -sa, and -sina. -jama combines with the complement/relational suffix -na possessive/ locational with unpredictable meanings.
The sequence /jama/ or a reduced variant /ja/ m a y occur in c e r t a i n inflected verb s t e m s , and -jama on nouns may be preceded by the independent suffix -ki. These facts suggest that the suffix -jama should be classified as an independent nonfinal suffix. However, while such an analysis works well for some examples, it does not for others. These complexities are discussed in more detail in 6-2.11 and 6 - 2 . 3 .
Bertonio (1603b:241) cited the following example showing + j a m a as a separate root:

+Kamisa na lura.t"a , jama.ki juma.naka lura.jata.

In p r e s e n t - d a y La P a z / T i a h u a n a c o d i a l e c t this is rendered as

Here -jama occurs in the frozen demonstrative uk"ama ' t h u s ' . In c o n t e m p o r a r y A y m a r a j a m a d o e s o c c u r as a
15 noun root, but only with the meaning 'excrement'. The suffix -j ama is distinguished from the homophonous root by always requiring a preceding c o n s o n a n t , while the root does not. Syntactic homophony is rare but p o s s i b l e .

Bertonio (1603b:174) gave a similar variant with final /u/, + / - j a m u / s occurring only on numbers. +maya.jamu 'in one manner' +paya.jamu 'in two manners' (etc.)

ak.na.m.jam 'by this (same path)' aka 'this'
The above evidence would seem to indicate that /-na.ma/ in T i a h u a n a c o and / - : m a / in San A n d r d s de M a c h a c a should be c o n s i d e r e d s u f f i x e s in t h e i r own r i g h t , the u n i t a r y morphemes -nama and -:ma.
In M o r o c o m a r c a the c o m b i n a t i o n s of -na w i t h - j a m a are r e j e c t e d , and 'through the house' is translated into

Present-day allomorphs of -jama beginning with /j/ or /k"/ require a preceding consonant; those beginning with vowel length of course require a preceding vowel. Bertonio's inconsistent spelling precludes certainty a b o u t the m o r p h o p h o n e m i c s of the a l l o m o r p h s in his d a y . The morphophonemics of -nama are variable, sometimes requiring a preceding vowel, sometimes a preceding consonant. The various allomorphs keep their final vowels except before /-jama/ itself (which may occur after -nama and may reduplicate on itself) and when zero complement final vowel dropping occurs.
5-3.33 Zero complement vowel drop
In A y m a r a each v e r b root or stem has m a n y potential zero complements. These are noun roots, stems, or themes whose occurrence with a given verb root or stem d e p e n d s on s e m a n t i c c o n s t r a i n t s i n h e r e n t in the v e r b root and in the verbal d e r i v a t i o n a l s u f f i x e s w h i c h m a y occur in the v e r b . As these suffixes c h a n g e , the zero complements change also. They are called zero complements because they are marked by obligatory loss of the final stem vowel before final sentence suffixes, if a n y , except -11a ~ -ya. The loss of vowel may occur on an independent s u f f i x , if any occurs on the noun r o o t , s t e m ,

298

or theme. This vowel loss, the mark of zero complement, is not actually a suffix at a l l , but rather the result of a phonological deletion rule, morphologically and synt a c t i c a l l y c o n d i t i o n e d , and b e l o n g s in a d i s c u s s i o n of Aymara m o r p h o p h o n e m i c s and s y n t a x . It is being included among the noun suffixes because it occurs only on noun r o o t s , s t e m s , and themes and is thus a part of the Aymara n o u n s y s t e m . It is inflectional, closing a stem to further class change.
Noun r o o t s , s t e m s , and t h e m e s , s i n g l y or in phrases, may serve as zero complements. They usually occur directly before the verb to which they correspond.

5-3.4 Class 3 suffixes (verbalizers)

There are four noun suffixes that verbalize noun roots, stems, and themes: two defective verbalizers and two full verbalizers. The full verbalizers create a normal verb stem that may be inflected for all verb person/tense suffixes (6.3). The defective verbalizers take the four persons as subjects only, not as complem e n t s , and are also restricted in the verbal derivationals they may take.

5-3.41 Defective verbalizers

These are of very frequent occurrence.

301

5 - 3 . 4 1 . 1 - c-ja- ~ - k a -

In all d i a l e c t s s t u d i e d , the suffix -ja- ~ -ka-

occurs only after -na possessive/locational (which does

not occur before the other verbalizers, although it may

be verbalized with the verbal derivational suffix -cha-

(see 6-2.11). This suffix turns a possessive or a loca-

5-3.41.2
As iri t h e c a s e of z e r o c o m p l e m e n t v o w e l - d r o p , vowel length is more properly a m o r p h o p h o n e m i c process than a suffix, but as it occurs to verbalize noun roots, s t e m s , and t h e m e s , it is here included with the other verbali zers.
When vowel-length verbalization is followed by a suffix that requires a preceding consonant, the length m a y be s o m e w h a t r e d u c e d , or the vowel in q u e s t i o n m a y revert to simple length, or it may remain somewhat lengthened; length appears to vary from one speaker to another. A timed spectrograph!'c analysis of texts containing vowel length v e r b a l i z a t i o n is needed to define the l e n g t h in d i f f e r e n t c o n t e x t s . In this study some examples containing the morpheme of vowel-length verbalization show the notation /:/ before a consonant-requiring suffix, if more than one vowel-length was perceived to o c c u r . If only one vowel-length was p e r c e i v e d , the n o t a t i o n /:/ is usually omitted from the t r a n s c r i p t i o n , the presence of a vowel before a consonant-requiring suffix being sufficient to indicate the underlying prese n c e of the v o w e l - l e n g t h m o r p h e m e in t h a t c o n t e x t .
This suffix is in c o m p l e m e n t a r y d i s t r i b u t i o n with -ka- ~ -ja- verbalizer, never occurring after -na possessive/locational. Examples:

An example of verbalization of a noun phrase is the following from La Paz:

Ma: jisk'a one little

uta.ni.:.t.wa. house ~l+3
S

'I have a little house.' -ni possessor

('A little house owner am I.')

305

According to Herrero et al. (1971-2:1.126), an allomorph of vowel length verbalization, + / - y a - / , occurs in O m a s u y o s p r o v i n c e of La P a z , but only in certain contexts: on the nominalizer suffix -iri before 1+3 and 2+3 Future affirmative, but not negative. Glosses for the f o l l o w i n g were not g i v e n , but the verb is y a t i . c h a . n a 'to teach'.

+yati.ch.iri.,ya.: .wa —1+3 F

+.yati .ch. iri .ya. :ta.wa — 2+3 F
The negative forms are the following, with /-:-/ ver-
bal i zer:

+jani.w +jani.w

yati.ch.iri.:.ka.:.ti ~ 1+3 F
yati.ch.iri.:.ka.:ta.ti 2+3 F

Since /-ka-/ incompletive requires a preceding consonant, the negative forms could contain +/-ya-/ also, reduced to /y/ homophonous with /i: /, that is
*jani.w yati.ch.iri.y.ka.:.ti ~ 1+3 F

306

*jani.w yati.ch.iri.y.ka.:ta.ti 2+3 F
H o w e v e r , the other a f f i r m a t i v e forms in the paradigm are given with /-:-/ before vowel-requiring suffixes, e. g.
+yati.ch.iri.:.ni.wa 3+3 F

This suffix is of less f r e q u e n t o c c u r r e n c e than -ka- and -:- verbalizers.
Hardman has pointed out (Hardman et al. 1975: 3.402) the relationship of -pta- and the verbal derivational suffix -ta- 'up, i n c e p t i v e ' , w h o s e c o g n a t e in o t h e r Jaqi l a n g u a g e s is - p t a - .

Bertonio (1603b:305) said S o m e I n d i a n s s a y t h a t pta and ta^ a r e not distinguished on nouns but rather mean the same thing. T h i s i m p l i e s t h a t the two w e r e in free v a r i a t i o n in 17th century Juli, but Bertonio does not indicate whether they both occurred on verbs. + - p t a - as verbal derivational has been cited in two published sources (see 6 - 2 . 1 6 ) but has not o c c u r r e d in the spoken data i n v e s t i g a t e d for this study. Since -ta- usually does not verbalize and -pta- usually is not a verbal d e r i v a t i o n a l , it has been decided to treat -pta- as the verbalizer and -ta- as the verbal derivational, recognizing that they overlap but seem to be diverging. The combination -pta- verbalizer plus -ha n o m i n a l i z e r i m p l i e s a human s u b j e c t in t h e f o l l o w i n g examples from La Paz/Tiahuanaco:

k'umara.pta.na 'to become healthy' k'umara 'healthy'

gullgi.ni.pta.na 'to progress, to become rich' qullqi.ni 'one who has money'

11 amp'u.pta.ha

'to humble oneself, repent, change character' 11 amp'u 'clear'

If a verb stem does not permit a human subject (because of Aymara semantic constraints), a noun plus the

308

combination -pta.na will be rejected, e. g. *muxsa.pta.na 'for a person to turn s w e e t 1 . However, with a nonhuman (usually inanimate) subject, an inflected form of a verb created with -pta- may be acceptable.
laranja.x muxsa.pt.i 'the orange turned sweet (ripened)' 3+3 S
Until this situation was understood, a number of nouns that actually take -pta- verbalizer were thought not to.
5 - 3 . 4 2 . 2 - v k—i p t a - a c c e l e r a t e d v e r b a l i z e r c
Contrasting examples with this suffix and with -pta- are the f o l l o w i n g , all from La Paz. (The suffix -kipta- was not found in other d i a l e c t s and should be looked for in f u t u r e r e s e a r c h . )

'to become old'

gam.ir.kipta.ha

'to win a lottery' (get rich quickly)

gam.iri.pta.ha

As may be seen, usually -ki pta- seems to accelerate the verbalization. At first the /ki/ of the suffix was thought

309

to be the independent nonfinal suffix -ki but morphophonemics eliminate that possibility, as the morphophonemics of -ki pta- follow the three-vowel rule, while -ki independent suffix takes a preceding vowel. Morphophonemics also distinguish -kipta- verbalizer from the verbal derivationals -kipa- plus -ta- (see 6-2.15.1 and 6-2.16).

Summary and Conclusions T y p e s of v a r i a t i o n in the noun system

In g e n e r a l , v a r i a t i o n in t h e A y m a r a noun s y s t e m is not e x t e n s i v e . There are two main types: internal and external. Internal variation includes differences in the p h o n o l o g i c a l shape of m o r p h e m e s (roots and suffixes) due to instability of certain phonemes and to operation of different phonotactically conditioned rules. O t h e r kinds of internal v a r i a t i o n are found in the m o r p h o p h o n e m i c s of s u f f i x e s and in the i n v e n t o r y and m e a n i n g of certain roots and suffixes.
External v a r i a t i o n in the noun system i n v o l v e s the introduction of Spanish loans. These have entered the open class of noun roots freely and continue to do so. Some dialects may use a Spanish loan where others may use a native Aymara term; some examples of this are given in 8 - 3 . 1 . The only closed classes of Aymara nouns

310

that have taken in Spanish loans are the kinship terms and the temporals. The only Aymara suffixes that are Spanish loans are the noun diminutives.
The following sections summarize internal variation in the noun s y s t e m .

Variation in noun roots Closed classes

V a r i a t i o n in shape o c c u r s in all the closed noun classes, e. g. the interrogatives kamisa ~ kama and gawq"a and variants, the demonstratives of third and fourth degrees of distance, the personal pronouns except the second person, and several numbers, positionals, and temporals. Some temporals have different shapes attributable to different morphophonemic rules, e. g., those affecting jich"a and uru (loss of initial /jV/ in t h e f i r s t c a s e , and d i f f e r e n t vowel s e g u e n c e a v o i d a n c e rules in the second c a s e ) .
V a r i a t i o n s in i n v e n t o r y and s e m a n t i c s are f e w . The d e m o n s t r a t i v e uwa a p p a r e n t l y o c c u r s in a few dial e c t s . The temporals show the w i d e s t variety in invent o r y , some terms o c c u r r i n g only in c e r t a i n d i a l e c t s and not others, or with different meanings (see 5-4.2).

5-4.11.2 Open class The majority of noun roots in the open class are
the same e v e r y w h e r e , with a few d i f f e r e n c e s in shape nated

311
in e x a m p l e s in C h a p t e r 3 . Examples of shifts of m e a n i n g a c r o s s d i a l e c t s are g i v e n in 8 - 3 . 1 2 .
5 - 4 . 1 2 V a r i a t i o n in s u f f i x e s
S u f f i x e s that show v a r i a t i o n s in p h o n e m i c shape are the lp possessive, the compiement/relationals (except -ru and -na), -jama 'like', and the verbalizer -ja- ~ -ka-. T h o s e t h a t s h o w v a r i a t i o n in m o r p h o p h o n e m i c s are t h e personal possessives, the compiement/relationals, and three suffixes that follow the three-vowel rule: -1ayku 'on account o f 1 , -pura 'among', and -kama 'until'. Suffixes that occur only in c e r t a i n d i a l e c t s are -chapi ~ - c h a p " i 'the one which/who' (which also shows phonological variation), -ra 'through', and -cha diminutive.
5-4.2 Dialectal patterning
D i a l e c t a l p a t t e r n i n g in the noun system is m o s t e v i d e n t in the t e m p o r a l s and in the shape of personal possessive suffixes. The following dialect groups may be d i s t i n g u i s h e d on the basis of the morphemes indicated; there is, however, a good deal of isoglossic overlapping.

Introducti on

The verb system of Aymara consists of verb roots and verb suffixes, which together form verb stems. A verbalized noun root or stem is a verb t h e m e . Verb r o o t s , stems, and themes are usually cited with the nominalizing suffix -na, unless the resulting form implies a semantically unacceptable human subject. (See 8-2.25 for m o r e on -ha s e m a n t i c s . ) The verb sa .ha 'to say' (see 6 - 4 ) is set off from all o t h e r s by its p h o n o l o g i c a l s t r u c t u r e (it is the only m o n o s y l l a b i c root in the language) and by its function as a syntactic subordinator. Most Aymara verbs have two-vowel roots; a few (mostly Spanish loans) have three-vowel roots. Spanish verbs enter Aymara f r e e l y , e. g . puyri.na 'to be a b l e ' from Spanish poder. There is also a class of ambiguous n o u n / v e r b r o o t s , as noted in 5 - 2 . 7 .
Verb suffixes are of two types: derivational and inflectional. Both types are closed classes that do not admit loans. Verbal derivational suffixes modify

317

318

the action or the persons involved in the a c t i o n . A special kind of derivation is n o m i n a l i z a t i o n , which changes a verb root or stem to a noun theme. The suffixes that n o m i n a l i z e verbs are discussed in 7-4.2 as they are used in m o r p h o s y n t a c t i c s u b o r d i n a t i o n . Verbal inflectional suffixes indicate person and tense, and these suffixes close verb stems to further derivation. Verbal inflectional suffixes may be separated from derivational suffixes by the class of independent nonfinal suffixes that occur on both nouns and verbs.
Verbs of carrying and placing belong to covert classes according to manner of motion and attributes of the item m o v e d (Tate 1 9 7 0 ) . Some e x a m p l e s from La Paz are included in the e l i c i t a t i o n l i s t , Appendix A .

The basic data and analysis on which this section is based were provided by England (Hardman et al. 1975: 3.148-208) and have been supplemented by my analysis of additional data obtained in my field work and from Bertonio (1603b); see Figure 6-1. Class 1 suffixes affect the action of the verb (e. g., its direction, intensity, duration) and are tied to the selection of its zero complements. Class 2 suffixes affect the inflection (the persons involved in the action and/or the tense or aspect of the verb). Suffixes occurring on the

border of Class 1 and Class 2 (-1'a- momentaneous, -sireciprocal/reflexive, and -ya- ~ -:- causative) share attributes of both classes. Members of both classes may d e t e r m i n e , in ways as y e t little e x p l o r e d , the s e m a n t i c features of verb subjects and complements (see 8-2.25). Class 3 consists of a group of semantically related suffixes all containing the phoneme /ch/ and forms deriving from the suffix -jama ' l i k e O
Certain verb roots never occur without derivational suffixes. Two are *ana- 'herd' and *ma- 'go1. The nonoccurrence of the plain root *ana- was noted by Bertonio (1603b:271). The root *ma- was apparently p r o d u c t i v e in B e r t o n i o ' s t i m e , but in c o n t e m p o r a r y A y m a r a it occurs only in a few frozen s t e m s , such as manta.ha 'to e n t e r ' (with the verbal derivational suffix -nta'into') and mak"ata.ha 'to go across' (with the derivational s u f f i x - k " a t a - ' a c r o s s ' ) , both used in La P a z .
Certain verb roots plus derivational suffixes may occur as derived nouns. Examples are

ana.nta

'concentration of people or animals; herd' (Jopoqueri) -nta- 'into'

arum.t'a 'greeting; greet' (La Paz) -t'a- momentaneous

irpa.qa 'betrothal; take a person down' (general) -qa- 'down'

321

q"uma.nta 'hug; embrace' (Juli) -nta- 'into'

un.naqa

'appearance; appear' (Huancanl) -naqa- 'around'

See 4-2 for general morphophonemic rules that affect verbal derivational suffixes beginning with voiced consonants and specifically with nasals. Verbal derivational suffixes beginning with the fricatives /j/ or /x/ require a preceding consonant. The morphophonemics of the remaining suffixes are unpredictable and must be specified for each suffix. Suffixes subject to the three-vowel rule are listed in 4 - 3 . 2 2 . 1 6 .
6-2.1 Class 1 suffixes
?
The 22 suffixes of this class are discussed below in the order of their o c c u r r e n c e in s t e m s . T h i r t e e n of these suffixes can verbalize noun roots. Four can also verbalize certain noun stems, and one of the four can v e r b a l i z e noun t h e m e s e n d i n g in -na n o m i n a l i z e r . 6-2.11 ~vcha- verbalizer, causative
In all d i a l e c t s - y c h a - o c c u r s m o s t o f t e n as a verbalizer of noun roots. Examples:

isi.cha.na

'to gradually acquire a lot of clothes over a period of time' (La Paz/Compi)

jiwq'i.cha.ha 'to cause smoke' (Calacoa)

322

junt'u.cha.ria 'to heat' (Calacoa)

kama.cha.na

'what to do' (all dialects) kama 'how'

lik'i.ch.iri

'fat-maker' (Salinas)

niya.cha.na

'to be nearly finished' (La Paz)

suma.cha.na

'to make amends, decorate' (La Paz)

In c o n t e m p o r a r y A y m a r a -cha- d o e s n o t v e r b a l i z e

animate nouns. Bertonio (1603b:273) gave the example

+

q a w r a . c h a - 'to c r e a t e l l a m a s ' (said of G o d ) , but

Vcisquez (La P a z / T i a h u a n a c o ) rejected it in favor of

gawr uywa.na 'to l l a m a - r a i s e ' or qawr un.s.ta.ya.ha

'to make llamas a p p e a r ' (metaphorical).

-cha- may also occur as a verbalizer of noun

stems ending in c e r t a i n s u f f i x e s : -na p o s s e s s i v e /

locational and -ni p o s s e s s o r . It is not a l w a y s p o s s i b l e

to tell which of the two is o c c u r r i n g , because on such

stems the three-vowel rule applies (see 4-3.22.16),

causing the vowel of the noun suffix to drop before

-cha-. The following examples cited by Bertonio (1603b:

273) have the same m e a n i n g s in La Paz t o d a y :

uma.n.cha.na 'to mix something dry with water'

qui 1qi.n.cha.ha 'to make someone win (money)'

323

Some o t h e r e x a m p l e s used t o d a y in La P a z / T i a h u a n a c o are

asukara.n.cha.na 'to add sugar'

jayu.n.cha.ria

'to add salt'

jinchu.n.cha.na 'to put ears on'

The last example refers to a practice attributed to Catholic priests, of having sexual intercourse with a pregnant w o m a n ; the woman is allegedly told by the priest beforehand that it is necessary 'in order to make the baby's e a r s ' . A nickname for such a priest is j i n c h u.n.c h.i r i 'ear-maker'.
-cha- as verbalizer may also occur on verbs n o m i n a l ized w i t h -na_. A g a i n , the vowel of -na d r o p s by the three-vowel rule. When it occurs on - h a , -chais usually followed by the sequence /jama/ (or a reduced v a r i a n t /ja/) that is best analyzed as the suffix -jama occurring primarily on nouns (see 5-3.32.3). All the following examples are from Compi:

Juta.n.ch.itu.w. 'It seems that it comes to me.'

come

3+1

S

Juta.n.ch.jama.k.itu.w. 'It makes me want to come/ I would like to come.'
juta.n.ch.ja.k.itu 'I think I'll just come'

324

Lup'i.n.ch.ja.ki.rak.itu.wa. think

'I'm thoughtful/It makes me
want to think/I want to be thoughtful.1

Literal translations would be 'to c o m e , like, is to m e ' o r 'to t h i n k , l i k e , is t o m e ' , g i v e n the 3->-l i n f l e c t i o n s .
Set 3 verbal derivational suffixes all contain the phoneme / c h / , which m a y in some cases be a frozen form of this suffix (see 6-2.3).
-cha- occurs as a verbal derivational causative on only a few verb roots.

yati.cha.ha 'to teach'

yati.ha 'to know'

6-2.12 ~cja- verbalizer, divider
This suffix is to be distinguished from /-ja-/ allomorph of -ka- verbalizer (5-3.41.1), from -ja 'amount' (5-3.12.3), from /-ja-/ allomorph of the Class 2 verbal derivational incompletive (6-2.25), and from /-ja/ allomorph of the suffix -jama (5-3.32.3).
In all d i a l e c t s this s u f f i x o c c u r s f r e q u e n t l y as a verbalizer of noun roots.

-ra- and -t"api-vra- serializer, reverser

-ra- occurs infrequently as a verbalizer. Example:

kaka.ra.si.na 'place to defecate' (Corque) < Spanish caca 'feces'

As noted by Bertonio (1603b:292), and still the case today, on verbs of carrying and placing the suffix usually reverses the action; on other verbs it signifies serial or repeated action.

-t"api- v e r b a l i z e s i n f r e q u e n t l y . In a v a i l a b l e e x a m p l e s , all from La Paz, it may verbalize r o o t s , stems, and t h e m e s . In the f o l l o w i n g e x a m p l e , it v e r b a l i z e s a nominalized verb, 1unt"a.ta 'stolen':

1unt"a.t.t"api.na

'to steal from various places' (La Paz/ Tiahuanaco)
'to steal with other people' (Ebbing 1965:245)

lunt"a.na 'to steal'

This suffix occurs most often as a verbal derivational.

A use of a verb stem wi th -t"api- in a m e t a p h o r i c a l s e n s e is the following from La Paz:
iki.n t"a1.t"ap.i 'youngest child', literally, 'shakes the bed' t"a!a.ha 'to shake'

6-2.15 6-2.15.1

-ki pa-, -nuqa- ~ -nuqu-, -qa-, and -xata- ~ -xita ~vkipa- 'past a point', verbalizer

This suffix m a y v e r b a l i z e , as in

uru.kipa.na 'to delay, be late' uru 'day' (La Paz) 'to delay a day or more' (Bertonio 1603b:291)

But it is more common as a verbal d e r i v a t i o n a l . Originally thought to be in the 6-2.17 order s e t , it has been found occurring before -ta- 'up' (6-2.16) in La Paz.

329

In c o m b i n a t i o n w i t h -ta- 'up' it is to be d i s t i n g u i s h e d from the verbalizer -kipta- (5-3.42.2).

-vnuqa- ~ -ynuqu- placer,cessation of action c

The consonant-requiring form of /-nuqa-/ is the more c o m m o n , but the vowel-requiring form is acceptable, / - n u q u - / o c c u r r e d only in J o p o q u e r i , w h i c h also has /-nuqa-/. /-nuqa-/ verbalizes infrequently but occurs often on verbs. Examples:

ali.nuqa.na 'to sprout' ali.na 'to sprout' (Corque, Salinas)

iki.nuqa.ha 'to sleep' (Jopoqueri) iki.ha 'to sleep'

ik.nuqa.na

6-2.15.3 ~vqa- ~ -xa- 'down', remover

This suffix, which does not verbalize, occurs often with carrying verbs and other verbs of motion.

331

A variant /-xa-/ occurred in S a l i n a s . jaqu.x.ta.na 'to whip' jaqu.na 'to fall'
Elsewhere the allomorph is / - q a - / .

ala.qa.na 'to buy' ala.na 'to buy' (Calacala, Morocomarca)
asa.qa.ha 'to remove plate or hat, down from above' (La Paz) asa.na 'to carry a plate-like object' (La Paz)

332

6-2.16 ~cta~ 'up', inceptive
-ta- rarely verbalizes in any d i a l e c t . Other homophonous suffixes, distinguished by morphophonemics from this one and each o t h e r , are given in 5 - 3 . 3 1 . 4 . Examples of -ta- verbal d e r i v a t i o n a l in c o m b i n a t i o n with -kipa- are given in 6 - 2 . 1 5 . 1 . Other examples with -ta-:

pur.ta.na

'to arrive' (Sitajara) puri.ha 'to arrive'

sar.ta.na

'to get up' (La Paz); 'to leave, set out' (Salinas)

sara.ha 'to go'

jala.q.ta.ha 'to fall down from above' (La Paz) jala.ha 'to run'

jagu.g.ta.na 'to fall down from a height' (La Paz) jaqu.ha 'to fal1'

junt'u.ch.ta.wa.ha 'to heat up (an oven)' (Calacoa) junt'u 'hot'

As indicated in 5 - 3 . 4 2 . 1 , this suffix is related to -pta- verbalizer of noun roots and stems. The allomorph /-pta-/ has not occurred as a verbal derivational in the spoken Aymara analyzed for this s t u d y , but it does occur in two examples from published t e x t s .

333

jala.pta.s.i 'jumped up' (Sebeok 1951 a:69) 3+3 S jala.ha 'to run'

+tuku.pt.x.i.wa 'changed suddenly' (Ebbing 1965:241)

tuku.na 'to finish'

The first is reportedly from the city of La Paz, the

second from La Paz d e p a r t m e n t .

Bertonio (1603b:308) cited in addition to + - t a -

+

+

the variants /-uta-/ 'up' and /-(u)talta-/ inceptive.

Forms with these are unacceptable to present-day speakers.

One s p e a k e r in Juli used /-tu-/ instead of / - t a - / , but

this may have been idiosyncratic. Examples:

uh.tu.t 'seen' una.ha 'to see'

jal.tu.w.j.iri.tayn

-jata- ~ -kata- ~ -k"ata- , -naqa -, -nta-, -mucha- ~ -muchu- ~ -muku- ~ -nuku-, -tata-, -xaru-, -xa:si-, -xaya-

These suffixes precede -t'a- momentaneous and do not co-occur with suffixes 6-2.13, 6-2.14, and 6-2.15.

6-2.17.1 -cjata- ~ -kata- ~ -k"ata- 'across'

This suffix verbalizes infrequently, /-jata-/ was used by one speaker from Salinas and one from

334

J o p o q u e r i ; / - k " a t a - / o c c u r r e d in a song sung by s p e a k e r s from J o p o q u e r i and in v a r i a t i o n with / - k a t a - / in La P a z . Examples:

it.kata.ha 'to put (a rock) up against (a wall)' (La Paz/ Compi)
itu.na 'to carry a heavy object' (general)

m a k"ata.na 'to come/go up in front of someone, to go across' (Compi/Jopoqueri) *ma- 'go'

6-2.17.2

~vnaqa- 'around, aimlessly' c

The s u f f i x -naqa- d o e s not v e r b a l i z e . In c o n t e m porary La Paz Aymara this suffix is preceded by a vowel on some roots and by a consonant on others; on some roots either form is acceptable. Examples from Calacoa and Sitajara have a preceding vowel; examples from Calacoa, Huancang, and Salinas have a preceding consonant. Examples:

sar.naga.na 'to go around, get along, live' (La Paz, Calacoa)

sara.naqa.na

'to go around, get along, live' (Calacoa, Sitajara,
Bertonio 1603b: 284) sara.na 'to go'

335

suma un.naqa.s.iri 'having a good appearance' (Huancan§) una.ha 'to look' suma 'good'
pur.naqa.na 'to turn over and over' (Salinas) puri.na 'to arrive, to come'

In one i n s t a n c e , two stems with - n a q a - , o n e w i t h a preceding vowel and the other with a preceding consonant, are distinguished in m e a n i n g .

ira.naqa.na 'to handle' ira.na 'to handle small objects' (La Paz)

ir.naqa.ha

'to work the fields in the morning' (La Paz) 'to work (in general)' (Missionary Aymara; see 9-6.2)

In the s e c o n d e x a m p l e a b o v e , the r o o t ir- is p r o b a b l y not identical to the ira- of ira.ha, since the meanings are quite distinct.

6-2.17.3 -ynta- 'into', slow inceptive -nta- can v e r b a l i z e , as in

link'u.nta.na 'to zigzag' (La Paz) 1 ink'u link'u 'zigzag line'
k'ari.nta.na 'to spread lies' (La Paz) k'ari 'lie'
In d i a l e c t s having the m o r p h o p h o n e m i c rule v o i c i n g p r e v o c a l i c

336

stops after nasals (Corque, Salinas, and northern Potosf), the suffix is phonetically [nda]. The meaning on verbs of motion is usually 'into', while on other verbs it is usually an inceptive.

iki.nta.ha 'to go to bed' (everywhere) iki.ha 'to sleep' manta.na 'to enter' (everywhere) *ma- 'go' manta.nta.ha 'to enter' (Socca) (manta- as frozen stem) puri.nta.ha 'to arrive' (Tarata, Jopoqueri)
puri.ha 'to arrive' sara.nta.ha 'to enter' (La Paz; also Bertonio 1603b:287)
sara.ha 'to go' [wina.nda.na] 'to put in' (Corque, Salinas)
*wina.na 'to put' (unattested) yati.nta.ha 'to learn by oneself' (Calacoa) yati.ha 'to know'

An interesting use of -nta- with the meaning 'not on purp o s e , by bad luck' is the f o l l o w i n g :

uta nak"a.nta.ya.s.iri

'a person whose house burned down through bad luck' (La Paz/ Tiahuanaco)

nak"a.ha 'to burn'

337
Without -nta- the above would imply the houseowner burned the house down on purpose.
6-2.17.4 ~vmucha- ^ -muchu- ~ -muku- ~ -nuku- 'away, off'
This suffix can v e r b a l i z e , but it is more often found as a d e r i v a t i o n a l . The p r e f e r r e d form in certain La Paz d i a l e c t s , i n c l u d i n g JesCis de M a c h a c a , is / - m u k u - / , w h i c h is t h e o n l y a l l o m o r p h c i t e d by B e r t o n i o (1 603 b : 2 8 3 ) /-nuku-/ is preferred in Compi and T i a h u a n a c o ; a speaker from La Paz/Tiahuanaco also uses / - m u c h u - / . /-mucha-/ occurs in S a l i n a s . A La Paz speaker reports having heard /-nuchu-/ s o m e w h e r e , but it is not included here since its provenance is unknown at present. Examples:
5 ali.s.muchu.na ~ alis.nuku.ha 'to throw out' (La Paz/
Tiahuanaco)
ali.s.mucha.ha 'to throw out' (Salinas) ali.si.ha 'to run after someone' (La Paz/ Compi)
apa.nuku.ha 'to abandon, cast off (a person); to throw away' (San Andres de Machaca) apa.ha 'to carry'

338

jayta.muku.na 'to abandon' jayta.na 'to leave' (Jesds de Machaca)
6-2.17.5 ~vtata~ scatterer
T h i s suffix may v e r b a l i z e . In La P a z , if a stem with -tata- cannot take a human subject, but only a nonh u m a n o n e , it c a n n o t be n o m i n a l i z e d w i t h -ria. In t h i s respect stems with -tata- resemble stems with -pta- verbalizer. Some examples given by Bertonio (1603b) with either human or nonhuman subjects may take only nonhuman s u b j e c t s in La Paz t o d a y , as f o l l o w s :

Chullu.tat.i.w. 'The ice melted.' chullu 'ice' (La Paz) 3+3 S

Uma.tat.i.w. 'It melted.' (La Paz) uma 'water' 3+3 'He sweated/It began to melt.' (Bertonio 1603b:305) S
The following are examples of -tata- as derivational:

6-2.17.6 -cxaru- preparative of motion

This suffix occurs only on v e r b s . It has occurred o n l y on v e r b s of m o t i o n , e s p e c i a l l y c a r r y i n g v e r b s . In Sitajara it occurred on verb stems used to translate plain carrying verbs, without any preparative connotation. Examples:

*ana- 'herd'
way.xaru.ha 'to carry by handle' (Sitajara) wayu.ha 'to carry by handle'
6-2.17.7 ~ c x a : si- static, cessation of motion This suffix does not verbalize, and is of rather
infrequent occurrence. It is not listed as a suffix by

jagu.ha 'to throw'
lar.ch'uki.ha 'to pull someone's leg' (La Paz) laru.na 'to laugh'
6-2.18.2 ~ct'a- momentaneous
This suffix occurs as verbalizer of noun roots and s t e m s , on most v e r b s , and is of very frequent occurrence e v e r y w h e r e . The meaning is sometimes a politive. Examples:

6-2.19 6-2.19.1

-paya-, -rpaya- ~ -rpa:~vpaya- helper, mocker

This suffix is very infrequent and was not identified by England. Certain forms cited with it by Bertonio ( 1 6 0 3 b : 2 8 7 ) are not a c c e p t a b l e in La Paz t o d a y . Other f o r m s w i t h t h e s u f f i x do o c c u r in La P a z , some of them with -paya- frozen to the root. Examples:

ali.s.paya.na 'to throw someone out' (La Paz, Salinas) ali.si.ha 'to run after someone' (La Paz/Compi)
In the last two examples the m e a n i n g s are closer to some examples of -rpaya-.
6-2.19.2 ~vrpaya~ ~ -rpa:- multiplier of action, intensifier
This suffix does not verbalize. /-rpaya-/ occurs in m o s t d i a l e c t s ; / - r p a : - / occurs in S i t a j a r a , C o r q u e , J o p o q u e r i , a n d S a l i n a s , a n d was c i t e d by B e r t o n i o (1 6 0 3 b : 2 9 7 ) . Both variants o c c u r in C o m p i . The suffix occurred m o r e f r e q u e n t l y in S a l i n a s and J o p o q u e r i than e l s e w h e r e . One speaker in Corque voiced the /p/ after / r / , giving the p h o n e t i c r e n d i t i o n [ r b a : ] in rapid s p e e c h . In C o r q u e this is not a regular rule like that voicing prevocalic stops after nasals in S a l i n a s , but rather an optional rule like the one that voices stops intervocalically (see 4-3.21.31). Examples:

6-2.2 Class 2 suffixes
T h e s e s u f f i x e s occur in all d i a l e c t s on a l m o s t any verb root, stem, or theme and are more closely tied to the inflection than to the preceding part of the verb Of the nine s u f f i x e s in the c l a s s , four a f f e c t case rela t i o n s of the s u b j e c t and c o m p l e m e n t p e r s o n c o n t a i n e d in the inflection: -si - reciprocal/ref1exive, -ya- ~ -:causative, -rapi- beneficiary, and -raqa- victimary. -ni- approacher and -wa- distancer (and its variants) indicate spatial relations (physical, temporal, or metap h o r i c a l ) of the p e r s o n ( s ) involved in the a c t i o n . The incompletive and completive suffixes are aspects of the

-si - does not co-occur with -rapi- beneficiary or -raqavictimary. -si- may occur before or after the suffixes -ya- ~ -:- causative, -ni- approacher, and -wa- distancer (or its v a r i a n t s ) . -si- often o c c u r s in c o m b i n a t i o n with - j a - ~ -ka- i n c o m p l e t i v e , r e s u l t i n g in its at f i r s t being considered a continuative. However, it may also occur with -xa- completive.
When it precedes -ya- on a stem, -si- usually glosses as a reciprocal, -si- following -ya- usually glosses as a reflexive. When -si- occurs twice on a s t e m , separated by - y a - , the first -si - is a r e c i p r o c a l , and t h e s e c o n d , a r e f l e x i v e . W h e n two - s i - ' s o c c u r in s u c c e s s i o n , the second is usually followed by the incompletive suffix -ja- ~ -ka-.

Examples of -si- with the other Class 2 suffixes mentioned above are the following:

jay.cha.si.ya.ha

In M o r o c o m a r c a -si- o c c u r r e d w h e r e the n o m i n a l i z e r -ha w o u l d occur in other d i a l e c t s , in the f o l l o w i n g type of sentence:

Kuna.mpi.rak mag'a.s.i ch'uhu.ka?

what with

eat ~3->3 chuno

S

'With what is chuno eaten?'

This use of -si- may be due to the influence of S p a n i s h , from which the sentence was translated: Con qug se come chuno? The possible influence of Spanish s^ reciprocal/ r e f l e x i v e on the incidence of -si- in Aymara needs further investigation.
6-2.22 -ya- ~ -:- causative
This suffix has been found to verbalize few noun r o o t s , and only in La P a z .

jayp'u.ya.na evening

'to get late' (nonhuman subject); 'to spend the day waiting in one place' (human subject) (La Paz)

uru.ya.na day

'to celebrate a wedding or a birthday by giving someone a party' (La Paz)

Bertonio (1603b) gave examples similar to the above, but with phonologically conditioned allomorphs: +/-wa-/ after

352

/u/, +/-ya-/ after /i/, and either vowel length or + / - y a - / after / a / . In c o n t e m p o r a r y d i a l e c t s these alterations have not been found to occur. Most dialects use /-ya-/; Compi uses both /-ya-/ and /-:-/; /-:-/ has also been found in H u a n c a n g and in n o r t h e r n P o t o s i . Examples:

apa.:.na 'to cause someone to carry1 (Calacala) carry —
apa.ya.na 'to cause someone to carry' (elsewhere)
ar.su.ya.na 'to cause someone to say' (Salinas) say
chura.ya.ha 'to cause someone to give' (general) give
The following has /-:-/ reduced to simple vowel before a consonant-requiring suffix:

Amu.s.t'a.q.i.lla. 'He made him be quiet.1 (Calacala)

~ 3+3

S

/-cqa-/ completive (see 6-2.25)

The Compi equivalent of the above has /-ya-/ reduced to /y/.

In the f o r e g o i n g e x a m p l e s the v e r b stem t a k e s a human subject and a human agentive complement (the person who is caused to do s o m e t h i n g ) . 1 1 Some verbs that do not take a human subject may take one if -ya- is added to the stem. If it is desired to have a human a g e n t i v e complement as w e l l , -ya- m u s t be r e d u p l i c a t e d . Examples:

achu.na 'for a field to produce' (nonhuman subject) (La Paz)

6-2.23 -vn i-, -ywa- ~ -waya- ~ -wa:- ~ -wi- ~ -wiya-
These suffixes appear to be semantic opposites, but they may co-occur on one stem with a meaning different

354

from either alone. When both occur, -ni- always precedes -wa- or variants.
6-2.23.1 -vni- approacher
This suffix has only one a l l o m o r p h in all d i a l e c t s . It reduces spatial, t e m p o r a l , or emotional distance between the persons of the inflection (who may be the speaker, hearer, both, or neither) or between person(s) and place (s). Examples:

jir.ta.ni.na

'to go to move something' (Sitajara) 'to go to move something with a stick'

(La Paz/ Compi)

jiru.ha, jir.ta.na 'to stir'

iki.ni.ha 'to go somewhere to sleep' (La Paz; also Bertonio

~~

1603b:285)

iki.na 'to sleep'

manq'a.ni.na

'to approach to eat' (La Paz) 'to go to eat, to have just eaten' (Bertonio 1603b:285)

manq'a.ha 'to eat'

gi 11 ga.ji.ch.itasma 'you could write to me' (La Paz) qillqa.ha 'to write'
In Calacoa -ni- often occurs with sa.ha 'to s a y ' , wi th the Imperative, F u t u r e , and Desiderative tenses.

355

Maka.nunu sa.ni.p.xa.sma.lla!

D-l

'You should say cow's udder!'

6-2.23.2 -ywa- ~ -waya- ~ -wa:- ~ -wi- ~ -wiya- distancer

This suffix increases spatial, temporal, or emo-

tional distance between the persons of the inflection, or

between person(s) and place(s). There may be a change of

location, or several locations, for the person(s). The

suffix may imply action before leaving for somewhere else

or while on the way somewhere e l s e . The suffix may serve

as a softener or emphatic with such meanings as 'quickly',

'at o n c e ' , or 'by the w a y ' .

The most common shape of this suffix is / - w a - / ,

which reduces to /w/ before consonant-requiring suf-

f i x e s . This v a r i a n t occurs in J u l i , H u a n c a n g , S o c c a ,

Calacoa, Sitajara, and Calacala. The allomorph /-waya-/

o c c u r s in La P a z , r e d u c i n g to /way/ b e f o r e c o n s o n a n t -

requiring suffixes. It may reduce to /wa/ before vowel-

requiring s u f f i x e s . Parts of La Paz also have an alter-

nate form /-wa:-/ (also attested in Bertonio 1 6 0 3 b ) ,

which reduces to /wa/ before consonant-requiring suf-

fixes.

In Sitajara / - w a y a - / ( r e d u c e d to / w a y / ) o c c u r s

before

3->3 S i m p l e t e n s e ; / - w a - / ( r e d u c e d to / w / )

occurs before other /i/-initial suffixes; and /-wa:-/

occurs elsewhere, reduced to /wa/ before consonant-

requiring suffixes.

356

/ - w i y a - / o c c u r s in S a l i n a s and C o r q u e . / - w i - / o c c u r s in J o p o q u e r i . In M o r o c o m a r c a / - w i - / or / - w i y - / occurs before /i/ (resulting phonemically in /wi:/ or /wiyi/), and /-wiya-/ occurs elsewhere, reducing to /wiy/ before consonant-requiring suffixes.

The combination of -ni- plus -wa- (or its varia n t s ) is common in all Aymara d i a l e c t s . In m a n y i n s t a n c e s it means action on the way back from another place.

ap.ta.ni.wa.: 'on my way back I'll bring X' (Juli)

1+3

F

sara.ni.waya.ha 'to stop off somewhere on the way back

go

from a farther point' (La Paz)

England found that this combination could also

359

. . . express discrepancies between where the speaker was at the time of an action and where he is when he tells about it. (Hardman et al. 1975:3.177)
An example of this from my research is the following said
by a young man from Socca who had left his town as a boy:

. . . mist.su.ni.wa.sn . . . ak"am jayt.ja.ni.w.t"a . . .

leave

thus leave

1+3

S

'. . . ileaving (my community) . . . thus, I left (everything)

The combination may also be used to express discrepancies between the l o c a t i o n of a person or p e r s o n s involved in an a c t i o n , and the l o c a t i o n of a h e a r e r , as shown in the f o l l o w i n g e x a m p l e s w h i c h o c c u r r e d in a r e c o r d e d m e s s a g e from a man in Juli to his n e p h e w in a n o t h e r c i t y . The message concerned the author's visit to J u l i , during which the nephew was not present.

In Calacoa the c o m b i n a t i o n /-w.ja-/ occurs very frequently, apparently as a softener since none of the other meanings of the distancer seem to apply. The combination seems to occur on any verb stem and with a variety of tenses. Examples:

Chura.w.j.sma.w. 'I gave it to you.'

The / - j a - / in this c o m b i n a t i o n is not i d e n t i c a l with /-ja-/ allomorph of the incompletive suffix (see 6-2.25.1). In C a l a c o a the a l l o m o r p h of the i n c o m p l e t i v e is / - k a - /

361

and /-w.ja-/ may precede it on a stem. */-w.ka-/ has not occurred in C a l a c o a .

Jan puyri.w.j.k.t.ti. 'I have not been able to.'

no able

1+3

S

puyri- < Spanish puede 'is able'

It is possible that /-wja-/ is a unitary suffix identical in shape to the noun l o c a t i o n a l suffix - w j a - (see 5 - 3 . 2 1 ) . When occurring before the completive -xa-, /-wj.xa/ reduces to /w.xa/.

On v e r b s / - w j a - / is r e j e c t e d in S o c c a as ' s o u n d i n g like baby talk.' /-w.xa-/ is, however, of frequent occurrence in Socca and J u l i . A series of v e r b s with / - w . x a - / o c c u r r e d in an a c c o u n t of the death and burial of the archbishop of Juli.

/-w.xa-/ also frequently occurs with /-iritayna/ (-iri plus 3+3 RIK) and other compound forms with -chi N I , in s t o r i e s told in Juli and Socca (see 6 - 3 . 3 6 . 1 and 6 - 3 . 3 7 . 2 ) .

6-2.24.1 -rapi- beneficiary

The p r e s e n c e of -rapi- in a verb stem indicates

that the verb c o m p l e m e n t e x p r e s s e d in the inflection is

12

a beneficiary of the action.

This suffix is of frequent

o c c u r r e n c e and no d i a l e c t a l v a r i a t i o n in its use has

been noted.

complement person is adversely affected indirectly, 13

through his possession.

This use of the suffix -raqa-

is g e n e r a l , although it is of less f r e q u e n t occurrence

than - r a p i - , and no v a r i a t i o n in its use has been n o t e d .

- c j a- ~ -ka- ~ -k"a- incompletive, - c x a - ~ -qacompleti ve

The incompletive and the completive may occur before and/or after -p- plural. They usually do not co-occur on a stem; when they d o , the incompletive precedes the completive.

6-2.25.1 -c ja - ~ -ka- ~ -k"a- incompletive
This suffix must be distinguished from the partially homophonous -ja- ~ -ka- verbalizer (5-3.41.1) and -ja- Class 1 verbal derivational suffix (6-2.12). T h e form / - k a - / o c c u r s in m o s t d i a l e c t s , but not in Corque and Jopoqueri, which instead have /-ja-/. In S a l i n a s , a m o r p h o p h o n e m i c rule ( 4 - 3 . 2 2 . 2 3 ) r e d u c e s -ka- to /j/ before consonant-requiring suffixes. The allomorph /-k"a-/ occurred sporadically instead of /-ka-/ in the speech on one Salinas s o u r c e . Both /-ka-/ and /-ja-/ occur in Calacala and M o r o c o m a r c a , where it appears that the two morphs may have separate morphophonemic status, -ja- 'ahead of' and -ka- incompletive.
This brings us to the semantics of this suffix. In some c o n t e m p o r a r y A y m a r a d i a l e c t s the s u f f i x u s u a l l y translates 'ahead of' when it occurs directly on a root.

6-2.25.2 -xa- ~ -qa- completive
In v i e w of the /k/ ~ /j/ a l t e r n a t i o n for the incompletive, the possibility that a similar alternation of /q/ ~ f x / exists for the compietive--or may have existed in the p a s t - - m u s t be kept in m i n d . T s c h o p i k ( 1 9 4 8 : 1 0 9 ) gives one e x a m p l e of a /q/ which is p r o b a b l y a v a r i a n t of t h i s s u f f i x , but / - x a - / also o c c u r s in his t r a n s c r i p t i o n , w h i c h in any case is not c o m p l e t e l y p h o n e m i c . In C a l a c a l a t h e r e o c c u r r e d a /q/ w h i c h m a y be a r e a l i z a tion of the c o m p l e t i v e . It could not be -qa- 'down', as it occurred after the causative suffix -ya- ~ -:(here reduced to plain vowel).

The Compi equivalent of the above has /-xa-/ (see 6-2.22). Further investigation will be needed to see if /-qa-/ c o m p l e t i v e is a p r o d u c t i v e suffix in C a l a c a l a and elsewhere .

It appears that / - x a - / , like -si-, may occur directly on a root, forming a stem which may take other suffixes that usually precede /-xa-/.

plural

No d i a l e c t has been f o u n d in this r e s e a r c h w i t h the form of this suffix cited by Bertonio (1603b): + -pi ska-. Examples from different regions bear out the contention earlier expressed that the suffix -p- is o p t i o n a l in A y m a r a . It m a y e x p r e s s p l u r a l i t y of the subject, the complement, or both. There are some exa m p l e s of its o c c u r r e n c e w h e n no plural a p p e a r s in t r a n s l a t i o n , or c o n v e r s e l y , t h e r e m a y be plural in t r a n s l a t i o n b u t no -p- in A y m a r a (this l a t t e r is the m o r e common possibility). When the noun plural suffix -naka occurs on a subject or c o m p l e m e n t , -p- may or may not occur on the verb, and vice versa (see 5-2.3, 5-3.25, and 8-2.4).
-p- occurs without a following incompletive or c o m p l e t i v e in C a l a c o a , S i t a j a r a , and M o r o c o m a r c a . ^ /-p.ka-/ and/or the variant /-p.ja-/, where applicable, and /-p.xa-/ occur everywhere, including those areas that may have -p- alone. The following are examples of -p- without a following incompletive or completive:

6-2.3 Class 3 suffixes This class consists of a group of related suffixes
all containing the phoneme /ch/ (or a reduced form /s/) and the sequence /jama/ (or reduced forms thereof) related to the noun/independent suffix -jama 'like'. They have so far been found only in La Paz (Tiahuanaco and Compi) and are attested by Ebbing (1965). The following a l l o m o r p h s o c c u r r e d in spoken t e x t s :
/-cchjama-/ La Paz/Compi (Hardman 1975:1.305)

/-ichja-/

La Paz/Tiahuanaco (also Ebbing 1965:209)

375
/-vsmach-/ La Paz/Tiahuanaco /-vsmachja-/ La Paz/Tiahuanaco
The f o l l o w i n g o c c u r r e d in e x a m p l e s w h i c h V ^ s q u e z (La Paz/ Tiahuanaco) reported having heard; their geographic origin is unknown:
/-cchja-/ /-csja-/
/-vsjamach-/ (also Ebbing 1965:223)
The following was cited by Ebbing (1965:223):
+/-vsamach-/
The meaning of these is expressed by a number of g l o s s e s , i n c l u d i n g 'I t h i n k ' , 'it s e e m s t h a t ' , 'it l o o k s as i f ' , 'it looks like', 'it is likely that'. They are here classified as verbal derivationals because they occur as units after Class 2 verbal derivationals and before independent or verbal inflectional suffixes.
Bertonio (1603b) and Ebbing (1965) have provided evidence which permits speculation about the probable derivation of some of these forms. (In the following analyses, presumed underlying morphemic, or

376

partial boundaries are shown for clarity even though the forms are synchronically unitary.)
As indicated in 5 - 3 . 3 2 . 3 , a free root *jama o c c u r s after an inflected v e r b in a s e n t e n c e cited by B e r t o n i o (1 6 0 3 b : 2 0 4 ) . In t h e f o l l o w i n g e x a m p l e ( B e r t o n i o 1603b:104) + j a m a occurs followed by /cha/, perhaps the verbal derivational suffix -cha- which may verbalize noun roots.

+Chura.sina

jama.cha.sma. 1+2 S

'It seems to me that I gave it to you.'

A m o r e l i t e r a l t r a n s l a t i o n m i g h t be 'I h a v i n g g i v e n to y o u , like' as -s i n a is a suffix which turns a verb root or s t e m i n t o a s u b o r d i n a t e d v e r b (a k i n d of n o m i n a l i z a t i o n ; see 7 - 4 . 2 2 . 1 ) . In the a b o v e e x a m p l e , a l t h o u g h the verbal inflectional suffix -sma 1+2 Simple tense occurs on + j a m a . c h a - , the relation of s u b j e c t and c o m p l e m e n t is actually tied to the verb root chura-. This indicates that the whole phrase functions as a syntactic and morphological unit. With corrected morphophonemics it w o u l d be * c h u r a . s i n . j a m a . c h a . s m a . In this a n a l y s i s the suffix -cha- reverbalizes the nominalized theme * c h u r a . s i n . j a m a , permitting it then to take a verbal i nf1ecti on.

377

In m o d e r n A y m a r a - j a m a d o e s o c c u r on t h e s u b o r d i nators -sa and -sina, e. g. sa.s.j am 'saying, like' (Hardman et al. 1975:3.408). The following is an example given by Ebbing (1965:223) that resembles the Bertonio e x a m p l e cited a b o v e and is a c c e p t a b l e to V S s q u e z :

jallu.s jama.ch.i 'it looks like it's raining' 3+3 S

Written as a u n i t , it would be j a l l u . s . j a m a . c h . i . Ebbing said the form was archaic and that the following was to be preferred:

+Jal1u.s.ka.s.ama.ch.i.wa. 3+3 S

'It looks like it's raining.'

VSsquez renders it as follows:

Jallu.s.ka.s.ma.ch.i.wa.

Ebbing heard a stress on the vowel before + / s a m a / , e. g.

^jal 1 u .js. k3. s. ama. ch. i. wa/

This can be explained by assuming a double /s/ which would tend to lengthen the preceding vowel.

378

*/jallu.s.ka.s.sama.ch.i.wa/

We may assume the following derivations:

*jallu.s.ka.s.jama.ch.i.wa -->

*ja!lu.s.ka.s.sama.ch.i.wa -->

+ j a 11 u. s. k a s - ama. c h. i. wa

The phonological rules, briefly, are /s + j/ --> /ss/ --> /:s/.15
O t h e r e x a m p l e s , from La P a z / T i a h u a n a c o t o d a y , are the following:

T'aq.s.ta.s.ma.ch.ja.k.i.w. 'I think (the donkey) broke loose.'

3+3

S

t'aqa.ha 'to break'

t'aq.su.na 'to break loose'

Ut.ja.s.ka.s^.ma.ch.ja.k.i.w. 'It looks like there is some there.'

The /-ja-/ after /-s.ma.ch-/ appears to be a reduplication of -j ama in its reduced a l l o m o r p h / - j a - / . If we consider /-s.ma.ch-/ as three morphemes, then the final /-ja-/ acts like an independent suffix, coming after the verbalizer -cha- and before the verbal inflection -i.

379
H o w e v e r , o t h e r c o m b i n a t i o n s of hch-/ a n d /-jama-/ (or /-ja-/) c a n n o t be a n a l y z e d as a b o v e . T h e s e o t h e r c o m b i n a t i o n s may be divided into two types: those in w h i c h a v e r b a l i n f l e c t i o n o c c u r s b e f o r e /-ch-/ and t h o s e in w h i c h it o c c u r s a f t e r /-cl>/.
E x a m p l e s of /-ch-/ o c c u r r i n g a f t e r ^ 3 + 3 S i m p l e inflection are the following:
Jut.i.ch.ja.w. 'I think he has come.' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco) 3+3 S
+Jut.i.ch.ja.ki.w. 'I think he has come.' (Ebbing 1965:209)
+Juta.p.x.i.ch.ja.ki.wa. 'I think they have come.' (Ebbing 1965:209)
The three forms above may tentatively be analyzed as c o n t a i n i n g , a f t e r the i n f l e c t i o n ^JL 3 + 3 S i m p l e t e n s e , the alternative question suffix -cha, a sentence suffix a f t e r w h i c h no f u r t h e r s u f f i x a t i o n m a y o c c u r . T h e /-ja-/ which follows must then be interpreted as the root *ja, a reduced form of *jama 'like1, followed optionally by the independent suffix -ki and the sentence suffix - w a . This is o b v i o u s l y not a s a t i s f a c t o r y a n a l y s i s in synchronic t e r m s , as *jama 'like' is not a root t o d a y , and a reduced form *ja would furthermore be the only

380

m o n o s y l l a b i c free root in the l a n g u a g e . ^ We m u s t therefore c o n c l u d e that / - i . c h . j a - / is a frozen form in contemporary Aymara.

D e t e r m i n a t i o n of t h e d e r i v a t i o n o f Ach-/ in t h e above forms is tentative pending further i n v e s t i g a t i o n , but certain p o s s i b i l i t i e s m a y be e l i m i n a t e d . It is not

381

the verbal derivational suffix -cha-, as it occurs before other Class 1 and 2 derivational s u f f i x e s , whereas in the above examples /ch/ occurs after Class 1 suffixes. It is not -chi NI, which t a k e s a preceding c o n s o n a n t . It is not -cha alternative question, which occurs after inflections, as noted above. Eliminating these three possibilities, we are left with the hypothesis that /-ch.jama-/ is a frozen f o r m , p e r h a p s a m e t a t h e s i s of / - j a m a . c h a - / , possibly formed by analogy with the combination of -chaverbal derivational as verbalizer, plus -jama--/-ch.jama/-w h i c h o c c u r s on n o u n r o o t s and s t e m s . In t h e f o l l o w i n g form from Compi (see also 6-2.11) the vowel before -chadrops by the three-vowel rule:

Juta.:.n.ch.jama.k.itu.w.

come

S

'I just feel like coming.'

(A m o r e l i t e r a l t r a n s l a t i o n w o u l d be ' S o m e t h i n g m a k e s me feel like coming', given the causative suffix /-:-/ and the 3+1 S inflection - i t u . )

dialects, not including those which are sources of the

Class 3 s u f f i x e s so far o b t a i n e d . In the sister language

Jaqaru there is a noun suffix -cha 'limitative' seman-

tically equivalent to the Aymara independent suffix -ki

'only, just' (Hardman 1966:87).

Although forms beginning with Ays-/ may be analyzed s y n c h r o n i c a l l y , the other suffixes having Achy and /-jamay (and their reduced v a r i a n t s ) cannot be. It seems best at this time, therefore, to present them all as Class 3 verbal derivationals pending further investigation.

Verbal Inflectional Suffixes1 7 Introduction

The Aymara verb inflection system consists basically of eight paradigms of nine suffixes each. The eight p a r a d i g m s , usually referred to as t e n s e s , are the Simple (S), Future (F), Imperative (I), Desiderative (D-l), Remonstrator (D-2), Remote Direct Knowledge (RDK), and Remote Indirect Knowledge (RIK). There are also compound tenses, consisting of certain of the plain tenses with either the Non-involver -chi (NI) or the Inferential -pacha (IF), and there are various combinations with the nominalizer -iri.
Each of the nine s u f f i x e s in each tense is a synchronically unitary morpheme representing semantically that tense plus one of the four grammatical persons as subject and another person as compiement. The suffixes are t h e r e f o r e c a l l e d p e r s o n / t e n s e s u f f i x e s . ( T e n s e s in Aymara also convey direct or indirect acquisition of information; see 8-2.3.) These suffixes are not synchronically analyzable into morphemes but do contain submorphemic recurrent partials (see below) identifiable as represent!'ng individual persons or tenses. The subject-complement relations expressed by the nine suffixes are 1+3, 2+3, 3+3, 4+3, 1+2, 3+2, 2+1, 3+1, and 3 + 4 . 18 (2+4 exists in the related Jagi language

385
Jaqaru but not in Aymara today.) The order just given will be adhered to t h r o u g h o u t this section as it is believed to be the best for displaying structural similarities and d i f f e r e n c e s , but it is, of c o u r s e , a r b i t r a r y .
For each tense paradigm a figure showing the person/tense suffix allomorphs in each of nine dialect areas will be g i v e n . Included in most paradigms are a few c o n t e m p o r a r y forms alleged in published s o u r c e s , identified by a preceding raised + . Also included are forms alleged for late 16th-century Juli by Bertonio (1603b); these are listed between c o n t e m p o r a r y La Paz and Juli forms and boxed to distinguish them clearly f r o m c o n t e m p o r a r y f o r m s . O t h e r v a r i a n t s c i t e d in the p a r a d i g m s occurred either in free texts or in elicited p a r a d i g m s , or in b o t h . A blank in a paradigm means that no form for it was o b t a i n e d , but does not necessarily imply that it does not exist. Each tense is analyzed for the morphophonemics, structure, and distribution of its person/tense suffixes.
The verb chura.ha 'to give' was used to elicit all paradigms, as it occurs freely with all person/tense suffixes. It should be pointed out, h o w e v e r , that even when given in p a r a d i g m s (an e s s e n t i a l l y a r t i f i c i a l framework), Aymara verbs usually occur with verbal derivational suffixes, and often with independent and final suffixes, as well as inflectional ones. For the sake

386
of clarity and simplicity all but the inflectional suffixes have here been stripped away.
For general rules concerning the morphophonemics of verbal inflectional suffixes, see 4-2.1 and 4-2.2. Additional rules specific to each tense and/or to individual p e r s o n / t e n s e suffixes will be given in the section on the tense in q u e s t i o n . In the figures a c c o m p a n y i n g the tenses the morphophonemics of suffixes will be shown only in the case of e x c e p t i o n s . If a final /a/ is in parentheses, it means it usually drops when there is no s u b s e q u e n t s u f f i x a t i o n . If a final /n/ or /na/ is in parentheses, it means its presence varies with its absence.
6-3.2 Verbal inflectional distinctive features
Hardman (1975) has reconstructed the person system of the Jaqi languages using as bases the personal pronouns, the personal possessive suffixes, and two verb t e n s e s , the S i m p l e ( P r e s e n t in J a q a r u and K a w k i ) a n d F u t u r e . P e r s o n is m a r k e d in t h e s e a n d o t h e r t e n s e s by submorphemic recurrent partials. Other partials are associated with tense.
6-3.21 Person markers
Following are the partials associated with verb subject person and verb complement person, incorporating

387

data from Hardman (1975) and data for other tenses disc o v e r e d in my r e s e a r c h .

Complement +4 All tenses: /-s-/

The 4p forms above are complex, perhaps reflecting two systems that have not completely m e r g e d . Since 4p is s e m a n t i c a l l y lp plus 2 p , the f o l l o w i n g a n a l y s i s is plausible (/-na/ having now fallen out of the lp alternations):

/-ta/ + */-na/ —> /-tana/

2p

lp

4p

Forms with /-na/ or /-na/ alone are marked only for l p , while those forms preceded by /-s-/ (not to be confused with the /-s-/ or /-sa-/ marking D-l and D-2)
20
are marked for 4p and lp.
6-3.22 Tense markers
The following partials are associated with tense:
S - Unmarked

6-3.32.1 Morphophonemics

Except for 3+4 forms starting with /s/ or /ch/, suffixes beginning with a consonant require a preceding vowel. Although collection and analysis of data regarding behavior of suffix-final vowels for this tense is not y e t c o m p l e t e , it a p p e a r s that in m o s t c a s e s v o w e l s are retained before most suffixes. An example of a suffix needing f u r t h e r study is 1+3 /-nha/ which loses the /a/ before -ti (and probably before certain other final suffixes) but keeps it before -wa, -xa, and -11a ~ -ya aforesaid.

6-3.32.2 Structure and distribution (see Figure 6-3)

6-3.32.33 Semantic
Dialects having only /-nani/ for 4+3 F perceive /-tana/ and variants as past, not future. An attempt was made to discover whether dialects having both /-tana/ (or a variant thereof) and /-nani/ distinguish them s e m a n t i c a l l y in some w a y , but the e v i d e n c e so far is i n c o n c l u s i v e . Either form may g l o s s , depending on cont e x t , as vamos a 'we're going to1 or as a plain future 'we w i l l ' .

In H u a n c a n e and S i t a j a r a 3+1 and 3+4 have f a l l e n together and only the 3+1 form survives.
In a n a l y z i n g t h e I m p e r a t i v e it m u s t be k e p t in mind that it overlaps the Future both formally and semantically to a large extent. The Future rather than the Imperative will often be used as a polite c o m m a n d ,

404

especially for 1+2, 2+1, and 2+3 (the suffixes involving the first and second p e r s o n s in the r e l a t i o n s h i p of subject/complement, or the second person as subject). H o w e v e r , as pointed out by H a r d m a n , in La Paz Aymara the o v e r l a p is not to be i n t e r p r e t e d as i n d i c a t i n g an incomplete Imperative paradigm filled with Future forms, as the Imperative is m o r p h o s y n t a c t i c a l l y marked by a morphophonemic rule: When stated, the subject of an Imperative verb drops the final vowel and carries no s e n t e n c e s u f f i x , e x c e p t in the case of 3 + 2 , w h e r e the subject 3p must retain the final vowel and carry a sentence suffix (Hardman et al. 1975:3.226). Example:

Jum_ jupa.r chura.m. 'You give it to him/her/them.'

I

As a person subject often is not expressed by a noun or p r o n o u n in an A y m a r a s e n t e n c e (since it is a l r e a d y e x p r e s s e d in the p e r s o n / t e n s e suffix on the v e r b ) , in this research it was not always possible to elicit an expressed pronoun subject which might be checked for p r e s e n c e or a b s e n c e of its final v o w e l . In S i t a j a r a , the only dialect for which pronoun subject forms were obtained with the Imperative for most person/tense s u f f i x e s , the vowel drops for 1+3, 3+3 and 4+3 but is retained and followed by a sentence suffix for 1+2, 3 + 1 ,

405
and 3 + 4 ; i n f o r m a t i o n is l a c k i n g for 3+2 and 2 + 1 . In the case of 1+2 it may be that the Future, rather than the Imperative, was e l i c i t e d . ^

6-3.34 Contrary-to-fact tenses: Desiderative (D-l) and Remonstrator (D-2)
Each of these tenses consists of two incomplete and (in some dialects) partially overlapping paradigms, one built on the recurrent partial /-sa-/ (the mark of contrary-to-fact tenses) and the other built on the
25 nominalizing suffix -iri plus the partial /-sa-/ (or other phoneme sequences replacing it; see below). Bertonio (1603b) distinguished the two sets, calling the /-sa-/ paradigms the 'Optative' and 'Pluperfect Preterite Optative' tenses, and the -iri paradigms the 'Subjunctive' and 'Pluperfect Preterite Subjunctive' tenses. H o w e v e r , the gaps in the paradigms and the semantic identity of the examples given show that in fact the four 'tenses' had a l r e a d y c o l l a p s e d into two in B e r t o n i o ' s ti m e .

406

In the f o l l o w i n g s e c t i o n s the - i r i and / - s a - / paradigms will be discussed, first with reference to the Desiderative tense and then to the Remonstrator. The forms will be referred to as /iri/ forms and /sa/ f o r m s .

No spoken dialect was found to have a /sa/ form for 1+3. 2+3 and 3+3 end in the partial corresponding to the personal possessive suffix for the subject person.

There is no 1+2 /sa/ form for D - l . 3+2 is represented by two forms attested only by Bertonio, both similar to 3+3. 2+1 and 3+1 are built on the recurrent partial /-ita-/ mark of lp complement, plus 2+3 D-l /-sma/ or 3+3 D-l /-spa/. 3+4 is based on 3+1 plus the 4p mark /-s-/.

6-3.34.13 Semantics of D-l
In the a f f i r m a t i v e , the m e a n i n g of D-l is of possibility or desirability. Examples from Bertonio indicate, however, that 2+3 /-sma/, 2+1 , and sometimes 3+3 were used as a cautionary.

Mira no sea tu parienta la mujer con quien te quieres casar.
'Be careful the woman you want to marry is not your relative.' (Bertonio 1603b:160)

The examples above are perceived by present-day Aymara speakers not as warnings not to do something but

412

as statements of desirability or possibility, e. g. 'Why don't you g i v e ? 1 , 'You should marry your contemp o r a r y ' . For these speakers the Desiderative is not a cautionary unless the independent suffix -raki also occurs in the sentence. Compare the following from a folk tale about a fox and a lake bird (wal1ata) told in Compi in the late 1 9 6 0 s :

In e d i t i n g the story for p u b l i c a t i o n a n o t h e r speaker from Compi replaced the sentence suffix -ya on the first word with another -raki, giving the following:

Sikuya.rak pik.t'.itasma, kayna.raki pik.t'.itasma. (L. Martin-Barber, Hardman et al. 1975:3.101)

As indicated for D-l, /iri/ forms are followed by a phoneme or combination of phonemes that mark the c o n t r a r y - t o - f a c t t e n s e s . The contrary-to-fact mark is not e x a c t l y the same in D-2 as in D - l , even a l l o w i n g for reinsertion of vowels.

On the o t h e r h a n d , in M o r o c o m a r c a 3+4 a p p e a r s to be falling out, as at first the 3+1 form was given for both 3+1 and 3+4. 6-3.34.3 Dialectal patterning of /sa/ and /iri/ forms
A comparison of the incidence of /iri/ and /sa/ forms in the D-l and D-2 t e n s e s shows t h a t , as m i g h t be expected, the most complete paradigms for both sets

421
are those cited by Bertonio (1603b). Of contemporary dialects, Salinas has the most forms of both types. Contemporary dialects may be divided into two main groups, those with a preponderance of /sa/ over /iri/ forms ( J u l i , La P a z , S o c c a , H u a n c a n e , C a l a c o a , and M o r o c o m a r c a ) and those with a preponderance of /iri/ over /sa/ forms (Sitajara, Jopoqueri, and Salinas).
Dialects with a preponderance of /iri/ forms have both /iri/ and /sa/ forms for certain person/tense slots: Sitajara 2+3, Jopoqueri 3+3, and Salinas 3+1 and 3 + 4 . T h i s o v e r l a p is l a c k i n g in d i a l e c t s h a v i n g a predominance of /sa/ forms, the only exceptions being the forms attested by Ebbing (1965) and Ross (1963) for La Paz 1+3, and Morocomarca 3+4 D-l /-irik"a/, a form a n o m a l o u s in shape and possibly in e r r o r . I n t e r e s t i n g l y , dialects with a predominance of /iri/ have forms for 3+1 and 3+4 which are missing from Bertonio (1603b), although he cited 4+3 /iri/ forms which the former lack.
E x c e p t for La Paz d i a l e c t s a l l e g e d by E b b i n g and Ross, no known contemporary dialects have /sa/ forms for l->3, but rather only the /iri/ f o r m . 1+3 and 4+3 /sa/ forms have fallen together as 4+3, and the 4+3 /iri/ form has disappeared. The /iri/ forms apparently took over the 1+3 slot when 1+3 and 4+3 /sa/ forms fell together as 4+3.

422

Dialects with a preponderance of /sa/ forms have /iri/ forms with /k(s)/ or /s(k)/ contrary-to-fact markers. Dialects with a preponderance of /iri/ forms have them with /j (s)/ contrary-to-fact markers.

6-3.35 Remote tenses

Two remote tenses w e r e e n c o u n t e r e d in this research: one direct knowledge tense (RDK) and one indirect knowledge tense (RIK). The distinction of direct, personal knowledge and of indirect (sometimes called nonpersonal) knowledge is a linguistic postulate of Aymara (see 8-2.3). RDK (called personal or near remote) and RIK (called far, or hearsay remote) were discussed by Hardman et al. (1975:3.218-222). Only RDK was attested by Bertonio (1603b) as a paradigm, although RIK 3+3 o c c u r r e d in examples of s e n t e n c e s . In c o n t e m p o r a r y dialects the most commonly occurring Remote inflections are the 3+3 suffixes of each t e n s e , as noted by Hardman et a l . ( 1 9 7 5 : 3 . 2 1 9 ) for La P a z .
All consonant-initial Remote suffixes (except allomorphs of 3+4) require a preceding vowel.

Notes to Figure 6-7

La Paz forms not otherwise identified are from the paradigm for Compi and Tiahuanaco (Hardman 1975) which preface all non-/-ya-/ forms by -chi NI, -pacha IF, or a verbal derivational suffix such as /-ka-/ incompletive.

2 No vowel length was indicated for these forms.

3 Non-/-ya-/ forms occurred preceded by -chi NI
or by /-ja-/ incompletive.

4 Except for /-ita:na/ which occurred preceded by
-chi , these forms occurred preceded by /-ka-/ incompletive.

5 A source from
of I n g a v i , La P a z , had (except for /-ita:na/)

San Andr6s de Machaca, province forms identical to these, also preceded by /-ka-/ incompletive.

falling-together of two paradigms, one with the partial / - y a - / in initial ( o c c a s i o n a l l y m e d i a l ) p o s i t i o n in the s u f f i x , and one w i t h o u t . This is not a case of phonological a l t e r n a t i o n of /ya/ ~ / : / , as in a l m o s t all cases the /-ya-/ is followed by /:/ mark of Remote tenses. There are indications that forms with /-ya-/ gloss as more remote (farther in the past) than forms without it, but at present the contrast is not clear enough to p o s t u l a t e two separate t e n s e s . In any c a s e , complete paradigms of forms with and without initial /-ya-/ were obtained for only one dialect, Jopoqueri, while most dialects had a mixture of the two forms, with one favored over the other: Juli has mostly /-ya-/ forms, Socca and Morocomarca have one /-ya-/ form each, and La Paz has six. One d i a l e c t , S i t a j a r a , apparently has no /-ya-/ forms, as sources interpreted stems with / - y a - / as c o n t a i n i n g / - y a - / c a u s a t i v e . In d i a l e c t s that do have /-ya-/ Remote forms, the causative may precede the Remote.
Chura.ya.ya:t.wa. 'I made X give to Y.' (La Paz)
Socca is the only dialect for which all forms without /-ya-/ were obtained without preceding suffixes in the verb s t e m . In o t h e r d i a l e c t s , e x c e p t for 3+3 /-:na/, RDK person/tense suffixes without /-ya-/ almost

429
always occurred preceded by a verbal derivational suffix or one of the compounding suffixes: -chi Non-Involver, -pacha Inferential, or -iri. Forms with /-ya-/ occurred more readily without preceding suffixes.
When preceded by -ja- ~ -ka- incompletive, this tense translates as a past progressive. This use has occurred in La P a z , M o r o c o m a r c a , S a l i n a s , and J o p o q u e r i . Examples of 1+3 with the verb chura.ha 'to give' are

In the last two e x a m p l e s , the RDK i n f l e c t i o n f o l l o w s -iri nominalizer plus ^Iz. verbalizer, which becomes neutralized in the length of the RDK i n f l e c t i o n . Other dialects use the -iri plus RDK forms in stories (see 6-3.37).
As indicated in 6 - 3 . 3 4 , the R e m o n s t r a t o r tense contains the partials that mark the RDK.
Apart from the sometime presence of /-ya-/, the marks of this tense are vowel length or alveolar nasal or both together plus /a/. One dialect, Jopoqueri, has plain vowel marking 1+3 and 2+3 forms without /-ya-/, although its /-ya-/ forms are followed by vowel length.

6-3.35.12 Dialectal patterning

Although final analysis must await the elicitation of full paradigms for Huancane, Calacoa, Sitajara, and S a l i n a s , the following summary statement may be made at this time. The dialect with the greatest number of /-ya-/ forms is J o p o q u e r i , which also has a full paradigm of n o n - / - y a - / f o r m s . Spoken La Paz dialects inv e s t i g a t e d in t h i s r e s e a r c h have / - y a - / f o r m s f o r all but 3+3, 3+1, and 3+4 and non-/-ya-/ forms for all but 2+1; but a non-/-ya-/ 2+1 form was alleged by Ebbing. One /-ya-/ form occurred for Salinas 1+3, but none for Morocomarca, which has a full paradigm of non/-ya-/ f o r m s . It is interesting to note that Bertonio (1603b) a t t e s t e d only f o r m s w i t h o u t / - y a - / in this tense.

6-3.35.2 Remote indirect knowledge tense (RIK)

Spanish used to elicit: Id le habfas dado.
'You gave it to him!' (surpri sal)

6-3.35.21 Structure and distribution (see Figure 6-8)

Suffixes with 3p or 2p complements are formed on the base of /-ta:-/ or /-tay-/ recurrent partial marker of remote indirect knowledge plus the corresponding Simple tense suffix. Person/tense suffixes with lp and 4p complements have some allomorphs formed by the same rule as the above, but also have allomorphs (those that begin with the vowel /i/) that are reduplicative or formed in m o r e complex w a y s .

The m o s t varied s u f f i x in this t e n s e is 3 + 3 , c o m m o n l y used in stories and as a s u r p r i s a l . A l t h o u g h / - t a y n a / o c c u r s in all d i a l e c t s e x c e p t M o r o c o m a r c a , other allomorphs also occur, /-tana/, probably a metathesis of / - t a y n a / , o c c u r s in La Paz and C a l a c o a . / - t a : n a / o c c u r s in La P a z . The form / - t a w i / a l t e r n a t e s with / - t a n a / in M o r o c o m a r c a and C a l a c a l a . For some speakers the /w/ of -/tawi/ is s o m e w h a t u n r o u n d e d , approximating /y/- /-tay(i)/ occurs in Sitajara, J o p o q u e r i , and S a l i n a s . T s c h o p i k (1948) attested + / - t a w n a / in stories recorded in 1940-42 in C h u c u i t o , near Juli and

437

In certain texts from H u a n c a n e , J o p o q u e r i , and Salinas, there occur instances of /-ta/ where other dialects would use 3+3 RIK. This /-ta/ is probably best analyzed as the resultant nominalizer -ta, used instead of a verb inflection (see 7-4.21.3). Examples:

Jani ut.j.ka.ta.t uka.t sar.xa.ta.

no exist

so

leave

'There being none, he left.' (Huancane)

Manq'.xa.ta.wa. 'They have eaten.' (Huancane) eat

Sawu.p ap.ta.si.s sara.ta.

weaving carry

go

'Carrying her weaving, she left.' (Jopoqueri)

The following was said by another Huancane speaker who also used / - t a y n a / in a n o t h e r i n s t a n c e :

Qamaqi.raki.s sar.k.xa.ta.xa.:.

fox and

go

'And the fox was gone for good!'

If the /-ta/ in all these e x a m p l e s is in fact the resultant nominalizer used in place of verb i n f l e c t i o n ,

438

it suggests the following hypothetical derivations of RIK 3+3, determination of whose correctness must await further study.

/-tayi/ /-tawi/

/-tawi/ + /-na/ remote —> /-tawina/

Neither */-ya-/ nor */-wa-/ has been attested as a v e r b a l i z e r in m o d e r n A y m a r a , but they may be postulated as underlying forms on the basis of the existence of -wa- v e r b a l i z e r in J a q a r u (Hardman 1 9 6 6 : 1 0 9 ) and the + / - w a - / attested by Bertonio as a variant of the causative verbal derivational suffix whose other allomorphs, /-ya-/ and /-:-/, exist today. The alternation of /ya/ and /:/ in n u m e r o u s o t h e r m o r p h e m e s a c r o s s and w i t h i n dialects is also common (see 3 - 4 . 3 1 ) .
In some d i a l e c t s RIK 3+3 forms occur after -iri n o m i n a l i z e r in s t o r i e s (see 6 - 3 . 3 7 ) . For a f u r t h e r discussion of the use of 3+3 RIK, see 9-6.13.

439
6-3.35.22 Dialectal patterning
Leaving aside the 3+3 allomorph /-tayna/, which all dialects except Morocomarca attest, two main dialect groups may be identified for this tense: dialects having forms based on /-tay-/ (Juli, S o c c a , S i t a j a r a , and probably Calacoa, for which a paradigm was not obtained) and dialects with forms based on /-ta:/ (all the rest).
6-3.36 Compound tenses
Paradigms for La Paz for these tenses w e r e given by Hardman et al. (1975:3.222-23). For the p r e s e n t s t u d y they w e r e not e l i c i t e d in p a r a d i g m s but did occur in t e x t s . They c o n s i s t of -chi N o n - I n v o l v e r or -pacha Inferential followed by tense inflection, except in the case of 3+3 S forms which consist of -chi or -pacha alone.
6-3.36.1 -chi Non-Involver
This suffix enters into compounds with the Simple, Future, Desiderative, Remonstrative, and Remote tenses.
6-3.36.11 Morphophonemics
-chi requires a preceding consonant. Its vowel drops if the following suffix requires a preceding

440

consonant. If a cluster of /ch/ plus consonant o c c u r s , /ch/ reduces to /s/ (see 4-3.22.25.2).
6-3.36.12 Structure and distribution
When it occurs with D-2 /iri/ forms, -chi separates the /iri/ plus contrary-to-fact mark from the rest of the i n f l e c t i o n . E x a m p l e s of this have been found in La Paz, Jopoqueri, and Tarata, Peru (near Sitajara).

In J u l i , as i n d i c a t e d earlier, al 1 t e n s e s have 3+4 forms frozen to a preceding /-chi-/ or /-schi-/. Those frozen to /-chi-/ are homophonous with the Noni n v o l v e r 3+4 forms ( e x c e p t in the case of the I m p e r a t i v e , with which the Non-involver does not occur).
6-3.36.13 Semantics Bertonio (1603b:276) called this suffix a con-
ditional or dubitative. He noted that the Aymara tended

441

to use it when repeating back an order which they had been given--an interesting illustration of the semantics of this suffix, conveying non-involvement of the speaker. The non-involvement usually implies lack of control over a situation or outcome rather than unwillingness or doubt as to its desirability, but forms with this suffix have o f t e n been m i s i n t e r p r e t e d in t r a n s l a t i o n .
-chi is very common in all Aymara d i a l e c t s and is used e x t e n s i v e l y in c o n v e r s a t i o n . E x a m p l e s :

3+3 S: Wali kus

jach' marka.chi.y.

'It must be a very beautiful big country.' (Sitajara)

1+3 S: Mijita.x.s.t.xa.y. 'I'm an old lady already.' (Corque) old lady 1+3 S
< Spanish viejita 'little old lady'

2+3 F: Inas

jan sar.k.chi.:ta.ti.

perhaps no go

2+3

'Perhaps you will not go.' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco)

6-3.36.14 Dialectal patterning Certain dialects use -chi not only as indicated
a b o v e , but also as a n a r r a t i v e d e v i c e in s t o r i e s .

442
Contemporary dialects that do this are Juli, Socca, and Huancang; Tschopik (1948) reported it for Chucuito, and Bertonio (1603b:276) used it to translate a passage about the death of St. Stephen by stoning.
6-3.36.2 -pacha Inferential
According to Hardman et al. (1975:3), this suffix occurs with the Simple, Future, and Remote tenses. It is m e n t i o n e d here only to c o m p l e t e the list of t e n s e s , as it o c c u r r e d but r a r e l y in this r e s e a r c h .
-pacha requires a preceding consonant. Its final vowel drops if the following suffix requires a preceding consonant.
As indicated in 6 - 2 . 2 6 , the c o m b i n a t i o n of the derivational -ka- ~ -ja- incompletive with -pacha means 'instead o f 1 in La P a z / T i a h u a n a c o and was cited with this meaning by Ebbing (1965), but it does not necessarily have this meaning elsewhere.
-pacha o c c u r r e d with the 2+3 I m p e r a t i v e in Calacoa and J u l i , in f o r m s w h i c h are r a t h e r r u d e .

Combinations with -iri nominalizer With -:- verbalization--Customary

The combination of -iri nominalizer (see 7-4.21.1) plus -:- verbalization plus verb inflection means to be accustomed to do an action. Such combinations are to be distinguished from the /iri/ forms of D-l and D-2.

Customary: chur.iri.:.sma
1+2"
S

'I usually give to you'

D-l:

chur.irisma 1+2

'I may give to you'

Examples with the Remote tenses are the following:

3+1 RDK: Kap"i.yaspirina.x nayra.x t'aku.y.iri.: ,ita:n. before ease pain
'Cafeaspirina used to ease my pain before.1 (Compi)

2+3 RDK: Pata.tug sar.iri.:.ya:ta.ti?

pampa

go

'Did you use to go around the pampa?' (Hardman et al. 1975:1.422)

6-3.37.2 Without verbalization, with 3+3 RIK--Narrative -iri plus 3+3 RIK without intervening verbaliza-
t i o n is used in J u l i , S o c c a , C h u c u i t o ( T s c h o p i k 1 9 4 8 ) ,

444

and Calacoa in telling stories. These dialects also use the 3+3 RIK w i t h o u t -iri in s t o r i e s but seem to prefer f o r m s with - i r i . In view of the a b s e n c e of v e r b a l i z a t i o n it would probably be better to view the combinations as s y n c h r o n i c a l l y u n i t a r y , as in the case of D-l and D-2 /iri/ forms. Examples:

sar.x.iritayna.x 'he left' (Juli)

jisk.t'.iritayn 'she asked' (Socca)

+sar.x.iritawna

'he went' (Chucuito)

q'ip.kata.w.j.iritan 'he had carried her' (Calacoa)

A case of -iri apparently frozen to a verb root is the following from C a l a c o a . The verb is s a . h a , which is highly irregular in all its inflected forms (see 6 - 4 ) .

Sir.sma.w. 'I said to you.' /-sma/ 1+2 S Jani.w sir.k.sma.ti. 'I didn't say to you.'

Note t h a t in the s e c o n d e x a m p l e the verbal d e r i v a t i o n a l suffix /-ka-/ incompletive intervenes between /iri/ and the i n f l e c t i o n , w h e r e a s in the p r e v i o u s e x a m p l e s of /iri/ plus 3+3 RIK the verbal derivationals preceded /iri/ on the stem.

445

6-4

The Verb sa.ha 'to say'

This verb is of e x t r e m e l y f r e q u e n t o c c u r r e n c e in Aymara as a reportive and subordinator. Embedding with sa.ha is d i s c u s s e d in 7 - 4 . 4 .
V a r i a t i o n in i n f l e c t e d f o r m s of sa.ha is e x t e n s i v e . This is due to its unusual canonical s h a p e , and the d i f f e r e n t m o r p h o p h o n e m i c rules operating upon it in different d i a l e c t s . As indicated earlier, sa.ha is the only verb in c o n t e m p o r a r y A y m a r a with only one u n l e n g t h e n e d
28 r o o t v o w e l . (The v e r b *ma- s u r v i v e s t o d a y o n l y f r o z e n in longer stems like ma.nta.ha 'to go in', and the verb p a : . h a 'to c o o k ' , used in S i t a j a r a , has a long r o o t vowel.)
A c t u a l l y , as indicated in 4 - 3 . 1 3 , it is p r o b a b l y best to postulate the underlying form of sa.ha as si s a - , w h i c h l o s e s its initial CV o b l i g a t o r i l y b e f o r e the n o m i n a l i z e r s u f f i x -ha and o p t i o n a l l y in o t h e r c i r c u m s t a n c e s t h a t vary d i a l e c t i c a l l y . In m a n y dialects, the reduced root occurs before suffixes that require a preceding consonant, creating an initial /sC/ cluster. This occurs, for example, with Simple tense i nf1ecti ons.
In La Paz and H u a n c a n e such initial c l u s t e r s are commonly, though not invariably, avoided by retent i o n of / s i / or /'ji/ on the v e r b r o o t . In S o c c a , i n i t i a l

446
/si/ or /j i/ is u s u a l l y d e l e t e d ; a c c o r d i n g to two s p e a k e r s in their t w e n t i e s , forms with initial /ji/ or /si/ sound overly emphatic and old-fashioned, 'the way old people talk'. The one form that usually has a preposed /si/ or /j i/ in Socca is 3+4 S . H u a n c a n e has /ji/ on 1+3 S and /j/ alone, optionally, on 2+3 S; /ji/ occurs optionally on 3+3 RIK a l s o , as in ( j i ) s . x a . t a y n , but is required before -chi NI. Bertonio attests forms with optional initial /i/ (but no /j/ or reduplicated /s/).
Like La Paz and H u a n c a n e , J o p o q u e r i u s u a l l y avoids initial clusters in s a . h a , but does so not by retaining /si/ or /ji/ but by reduplicating the root vowel and retaining the length before consonant-requiring suffixes b e g i n n i n g w i t h a c o n s o n a n t , e . g . 1+3 S sa: .t"a 'I s a i d ' . In S i t a j a r a , where initial clusters in sa.ha are more usual, the root vowel of the verb may also sometimes be lengthened. (Vowel length retention, rather than vowel r e d u p l i c a t i o n , occurs in Sitajara in certain other verb roots whose vowel length is analogous to the phoneme sequence /ya/; see 4-3.22.15).
Lengthening of the root vowel of sa.ha results in certain forms for the S i m p l e tense which are homop h o n o u s with RDK in certain p e r s o n s , n a m e l y 1 + 3 , 2 + 3 , 4 + 3 , 1 + 2 , and 3+2. When there is a verbal derivational suffix in the s t e m , h o w e v e r , it is clear that the length goes with the root, not the inflection. Examples:

447

1+3 S: sa:.t"a 'I said to him/her/them'

1+3 RDK: sa.j_t"a 'I said to him/her/them' (Sitajara,

—

Jopoqueri)

1+3 S with /-ja-/ incompletive: Jani.w sa^.j.t.ti.
'I didn't say to him/her/ them.' (Jopoqueri)

In the t h i r d e x a m p l e a b o v e , it is c l e a r t h a t the v o w e l length goes with the verb root before the derivational suffix /-ja-/ (which usually takes a preceding consonant). If the vowel length went with the t e n s e , it would go between the /j/ and the /t/. 1+3 F with /-ja-/ also has vowel length on the verb root.
Another dialect that avoids initial consonant clusters with sa.na is C a l a c o a . Like J o p o q u e r i , Calacoa does not prepose /si/ or /ji/, but unlike Jopoqueri, it does not lengthen the root vowel. Instead, Calacoa forms occur with the root sa- followed by verbal derivational s or the initial /s/ followed by -iri, when there would otherwise be an initial cluster.
Only the Simple and Future tenses were formally elicited for this verb, but many examples of other tenses o c c u r r e d in t e x t s .

/s/ ~ /j/ o c c u r s in the r o o t c o n s o n a n t in 2->l, and in S o c c a a n d H u a n c a n £ , in 3->-4. F o r m s e l i c i t e d p a r a d i g m a t ically for Calacoa all had the continuative /-s.ka-/ followed by the independent suffix /-puni/ 'really', o r e l s e w e r e b u i l t on - i r i (see 6 - 3 . 3 7 ) . l->3 w i t h -in* was also attested by Bertonio. The continuative is common with sa. na in other d i a l e c t s , namely S i t a j a r a , Salinas, and Morocomarca. The independent /-pini/ ' r e a l l y ' and the i n d e p e n d e n t -ki ' j u s t ' occur in M o r o c o m a r c a 2->l S .

T h e M o r o c o m a r c a f o r m s h a v i n g v a r i a n t s w i t h /-s.ka-/ are anomalous in that /-ka-/ keeps its final vowel before consonant-requiring suffixes. Such forms are probably instances of RDK rather than Simple tense, although forms d i f f e r e n t from some of those in the regular RDK paradigm occurred.

As with all Aymara verbs, the proper use of sa.na requires facility in m a n i p u l a t i n g verbal derivational and independent s u f f i x e s .

Future forms for sa.ha were elicited for all d i a l e c t s e x c e p t M o r o c o m a r c a and C a l a c a l a . The La Paz forms shown are from San A n d r e s de M a c h a c a . In La P a z , Juli, and Socca, 4+3 Future with sa. ha has vowel length in the i n f l e c t i o n , which it does not u s u a l l y have with other verbs. A variant of 3+4 with a three-consonant initial cluster o c c u r r e d in S o c c a : s . t ' . s i t a n i , with the verbal derivational suffix -t'a-.

Summary and Conclusions T y p e s of v a r i a t i o n in the v e r b s y s t e m

As in the c a s e of the noun s y s t e m , v a r i a t i o n in the verb system may be divided into internal and external. External variation involves the entry of Spanish verbs into A y m a r a , a c o n t i n u i n g p r o c e s s . In c e r t a i n areas Spanish loans have apparently replaced native roots still in use e l s e w h e r e . Examples of these are given in 8 - 3 . 2 1 .
Internal v a r i a t i o n in the v e r b s y s t e m is summ a r i z e d in the following s e c t i o n s .

6-5.11 Variation in verb roots and stems

Internal v a r i a t i o n in verb roots is s l i g h t and may be divided into two types: phonological (variation in the shape of the r o o t ) and s e m a n t i c (where a given r o o t has d i f f e r e n t m e a n i n g s in d i f f e r e n t d i a l e c t s or

456

e x i s t s only in some and n o t in o t h e r s ) . E x a m p l e s of p h o n o l o g i c a l variation in verb roots were given in C h a p t e r 3 . Semantic variation in verb roots is d i s c u s s e d in 8 - 3 . 2 1 .
Vari ati on in verb s t e m s d e p e n d s on the suffi xes o c c u r r i n g in t h e m .

6-5.12 Verb suffixes

Verb suffixes display phonological and semantic d i f f e r e n c e s across d i a l e c t s . Variation in verbal derivational s u f f i x e s is r e l a t i v e l y s l i g h t ; that in verbal inflectional suffixes is more e x t e n s i v e .

6-5.12.1 Derivational suffixes

Six of the Class 1 suffixes have variable phono-

logical shapes involving alternations of /ya/ ~ /:/,

vowels, stops and continuants, and plain and aspirated

stops. The two Class 1 suffixes beginning with /nV/

(-nuqa- ~ -nugu- and -naqa-) have variable morphophonemics

with respect to preceding vowel or consonant. Another

Class 1 suffix beginning with / n / , - n t a - , is affected by

o b l i g a t o r y s t o p - v o i c i n g in S a l i n a s (see 4 - 3 . 2 1 . 3 3 ) .

Variation in Class 2 suffixes involves d i f f e r e n t

shapes for four, with alternations of /ya/ and /:/,

vowels, and stops and nonstops.

A morphophonemic

457
rule in Salinas reduces the /k/ of /-ka-/ incompletive to /j/ in certain environments (see 4-3.22.23). Certain dialects usually have the incompletive (or less often, the c o m p l e t i v e ) suffix in negative e x p r e s s i o n s , while other d i a l e c t s do not (see 7 - 4 . 5 ) . With respect to inventory and meaning, Calacoa alone has the apparently unitary suffix -wja-.
No formal attempt was made in this research to determine whether all verbal derivational suffixes occur in all dialects or w h e t h e r those that occur have the same or different meanings. However, it appears that the meanings of Class 2 suffixes are usually predictable, while the meanings of Class 1 suffixes vary according to the root, stem, or theme they occur on. Sometimes a stem containing the same root and derivational suffix(es) was found to gloss d i f f e r e n t l y in one d i a l e c t than in another. Additional examples of such stems will be found in 8 - 3 . 2 , but a m o r e thorough d e t e r m i n a t i o n of regional variation in this respect will require more research.
6-5.12.2 Inflectional suffixes
M o s t variation in verbal inflectional suffixes is in p h o n o l o g i c a l s h a p e a t t r i b u t a b l e to i n s t a b i l i t y of vowels and nonstop consonants and to a lesser extent, of s t o p s ; the l a t t e r a l s o vary in p r e s e n c e or a b s e n c e of

458
a s p i r a t i o n . O t h e r v a r i a t i o n s in p h o n o l o g i c a l shape are attributable to different processes of morphological change with preservation or loss of different (now submorphemic) r e c u r r e n t p a r t i a l s . In two t e n s e s , D-l and D - 2 , e x t e n sive variation results from the apparent falling-together of two separate paradigms in each t e n s e . Still other varia t i o n s in s h a p e are d u e to p r o c e s s e s of a n a l o g y at w o r k w i t h i n a d i a l e c t , r e s u l t i n g in s y m m e t r i c a l v a r i a t i o n across all its tenses. The most striking instance of t h i s is t h e s h a p e of 3-*-4 s u f f i x e s in all t e n s e s e l i c i t e d for Juli. All have allomorphs frozen to the NI suffix -chi and thus h o m o p h o n o u s , in t h a t p e r s o n / t e n s e , with NI compound verb forms.
Not only is t h e r e v a r i a t i o n in shape across d i a l e c t s ; t h e r e is c o n s i d e r a b l e v a r i a t i o n in a l l o m o r p h s within dialects, and a larger sample of speakers would probably turn up more forms. While most Aymara speakers have a r e c e p t i v e c o m p e t e n c e in i n f l e c t i o n a l v a r i a n t s they do not use themselves, recognizing them as the way some people talk, not all variants are equally accepta b l e . W h a t b e l o n g s in o n e t e n s e in one d i a l e c t m a y belong in a d i f f e r e n t t e n s e in a n o t h e r . For e x a m p l e , s p e a k e r s w h o h a v e o n l y / - n a n i / f o r 4->3 F r e j e c t t h e use of /-tana/ for it, saying it means a past action, not future. There are also some overlaps of person and tense, a given suffix being used for a certain subject,

459
c o m p l e m e n t , and tense in one d i a l e c t and for a d i f f e r e n t s u b j e c t , c o m p l e m e n t , and tense in a n o t h e r d i a l e c t (see 8-3.22 for examples).
Iri s o m e d i a l e c t s , in s o m e t e n s e s , p e r s o n / t e n s e suffixes involving lp and 4p have fallen together or are in p r o c e s s of d o i n g s o , but this does n o t a p p e a r to be a very widespread phenomenon (see 8-2.1).
The most complex and variable person/tense suffixes in all tenses are 1 + 2 , 3 + 2 , and 2 + 1 . The 3+3 suffixes are almost invariable except that D-l, D-2, and RIK have complex allomorphs.
In c o n t r a s t to the v a r i e t y of their s h a p e s , the morphophonemics of verbal inflectional suffixes are remarkably uniform across dialects. The only differences noted so far are in the 1+3 Simple s u f f i x , which keeps its final vowel before succeeding suffixes in C a l a c o a but loses it in o t h e r d i a l e c t s ; and in the m o r p h o p h o n e m i c s of the 2+3 I s u f f i x , which in some dialects vary according to w h e t h e r the verb is used in the affirmative or the negative.
6-5.2 Dialectal patterning
Certain dialect groups emerge on the basis of phonological, morphophonemic, and morphological variation in t h e verb s y s t e m , e s p e c i a l l y in v e r b a l i n f l e c tional s u f f i x e s . As in the case of the noun s y s t e m , there is considerable isoglossic overlapping.

463
6-5.24 Dialects sharing features across regional lines
Two dialects that belong respectively to the northern and southern groups have one feature each of the opposite group. These are Huancane (in the north) and M o r o c o m a r c a (in the s o u t h ) . H u a n c a n e shares the feature 6-5.22.4 with Sitajara and with Jopoqueri and S a l i n a s of the s o u t h e r n g r o u p , e x c e p t t h a t in H u a n c a n e the 1+3 F suffix has no nasal. Morocomarca shares the feature 6-5.21.3 with Calacoa and with the northern group. It may also be noted that Calacoa and Morocomarca have similar unusual forms for 4+3 S not found elsewhere: Calacoa /-vsna/ and Morocomarca /-sna/.
The morphophonemics of the 2+3 Imperative suffix also may be cited as an example of a feature cutting a c r o s s r e g i o n a l l i n e s . S o c c a , H u a n c a n e , and Juli in the n o r t h e r n group and M o r o c o m a r c a in the southern group have a rule whereby the 2+3 I suffix requires a preceding vowel after the suffix -ka- incompletive but otherwise takes a preceding consonant. This rule has not been found elsewhere.

Notes

^These suffixes were not considered verbal derivationals by England.

p T h e suffix - p a y a - has been added to the 21 l i s t e d
by England, who identified 10 verbal derivational suffixes as verbalizing noun roots only. The three additional verbalizers now identified are -su-, -ta-, and -kipa-. Verbal derivational suffixes that can verbalize certain noun stems as well as roots are -cha- , -1"a p i- , and -1'a-. -cha- also v e r b a l i z e s noun t h e m e s e n d i n g in - n a .

cause the three-vowel stem uta.cha- to lose its final vowel before -ki pa-.

5 The three-vowel rule operates on this and the
next two examples built on a 1i. s i - , a stem with -si frozen to the root (see 6-2.19.1 and 6-2.21, below).

and D-2 /sa/ forms and /iri/ forms, see 6-3.34.
?o Hardman (Hardman et al. 1975:3.233) has
pointed out that contemporary 2+1 forms represent a fal1ing-together of earlier 2+1 and 2+4 forms. Semantically 2+4 has now fallen out, but some contemporary 2+1 forms have a formal vestige of the 4p complement in an /s/ t h a t r e c u r s i n t e r m i t t e n t l y in d i f f e r e n t t e n s e s . It also recurs in the 1+2 S suffix -sma (see also Hardman 1975).
21 As i n d i c a t e d in n o t e 2 0 , the /s/ in 1+2 S i m p l e
-sma is a vestige of the 4p m a r k e r .
22 When 1+3 F /-:/ is followed by -xa sentence
suffix, the resulting combination /:xa/ is indistinguishable from one of the other voiceless fricative allomorphs of 1+3 F, /-:xa/. The latter may be followed by the s e n t e n c e suffix - w a , as in the f o l l o w i n g e x a m p l e s from Compi :
S a r a . : x a . w . 'I'm going to go.'
Chura.:xa.w. '(Now that you ask) I will give it to him.1
However, -xa sentence suffix does not occur after /-:xa/ 1+3 F; *chura.:xa.xa is r e j e c t e d . We are left with a p o s s i b l e a m b i g u i t y in such forms as c h u r a : x a , w h i c h m a y be analyzed as either c h u r a . :xa or c h u r a . : . x a . So f a r , no predictable difference in meaning has been discovered that would facilitate determining which is o c c u r r i n g .
23 An example of 1+3 F with palatal g l i d e , for La
Paz and S o c c a , is
A k a . n . k a . s . k a . y a : . w a . 'I w i l l be h e r e . '

24 Yapita (La P a z / C o m p i ) indicates that 3+1 or 3+4 may sometimes occur with final vowel and sentence suffix other than -wa, which implies that the syntactic conditioning here discussed needs further investigation in La Paz as well as e l s e w h e r e . Of c o u r s e , w h e r e the suffix is a form p e c u l i a r to the I m p e r a t i v e (for e x a m p l e 3+1 and 3+4 for La Paz and m o s t other p l a c e s ) , the presence or a b s e n c e of vowel or sentence suffix is irrelevant for identifying the t e n s e . It is only in the case of forms homophonous with the Future that the syntactic mark may be significant.

25 D-l and D-2 based on -iri are to be distin-
guished from sequences of -iri plus -:- verbalizer plus inflection (see 6-3.37).

CHAPTER 7 SYNTACTIC AND MORPHOSYNTACTIC VARIATION

7-1

Introduction

Morphosyntactic structures are morphemes belonging to neither the noun nor verb systems but operating at both the morphological and syntactic levels. They are (1) particles, and (2) syntactic suffixes. Particles are roots that take neither noun nor verb suffixes, although they may take syntactic suffixes. Syntactic suffixes, which occur on n o u n s , v e r b s , and p a r t i c l e s , are subdivided into nonfinal (independent) and final (sentence) suffixes. Nonfinal suffixes occur on n o u n s , v e r b s , and particles before final s u f f i x e s . On nouns nonfinal suffixes occur after noun suffixes; on verbs they separate derivation from inflection. Final suffixes occur after all other suffixes, marking phrase and sentence boundaries. They define sentence types, conveying attenuation, absoluteness, vouching for information, repetition of information known to the hearer, disclaiming of knowledge, and contingency; they mark yes/no questions, alternate questions, and i n f o r m a t i o n q u e s t i o n s ; t h e y list in a s e r i e s , link

sentences, and subordinate one part of a sentence to a n o t h e r . Their meanings are often lost in t r a n s l a t i o n , h o w e v e r , which is why m o s t Aymara grammars have dismissed them as ornamental.
M o r p h o s y n t a c t i c p r o c e s s e s in A y m a r a i n c l u d e reduplication; subordination by noun-phrase embedding, nominalization, or with sentence suffixes; use of the demonstrative uka 'that' as summarizer and sentence linker; sentence embedding with the reportive verb sa.ha 'to s a y ' ; and n e g a t i o n . In A y m a r a w o r d o r d e r is fixed only w i t h i n the noun p h r a s e and in the p l a c e m e n t of the s u m m a r i z e r uka after what is being s u m m a r i z e d .
Syntactically-conditioned vowel retention and dropping rules were discussed in 4 - 3 . 3 1 .

Particles and Syntactic Suffixes

7-2.1

Particles

Particles are roots that take neither noun nor verb suffixes. Some of them take nonfinal or final suffixes; others always occur unsuffixed. Some of the m o s t c o m m o n are listed below in a l p h a b e t i c a l o r d e r . ( O n o m a t o p o e i c p a r t i c l e s are l i s t e d in A p p e n d i x B . )

A special class of particles consists of terms for affirmation and negation. The negative jani and its o c c u r r e n c e s in negative phrases are discussed in 7 - 4 . 5 . The a f f i r m a t i v e jisa 'yes' occurs in all d i a l e c t s a l s o ; sometimes either jani or j i sa may lose its first s y l l a b l e . In s o m e d i a l e c t s j i s a u s u a l l y o c c u r s w i t h the final suffix -11a ~ -ya. Examples:

jisa (La Paz, Juli, Huancang, Jopoqueri, Morocomarca) jisa.ya (Morocomarca, Calacala) sa. ll.a (Salinas) sa.ya (La Paz, Calacala)

472
iyaw 'okay, yes' (most dialects) 'you're welcome' (Calacoa; thought by source to be a Quechua word)
Other affirmative particles are the following, both given by a source in S i t a j a r a ; the second is a t t r i b u t e d to C a n d a r a v e (also in the p r o v i n c e of T a r a t a ) .
kuwat.xa 'yes' (Sitajara) jart.xa 'yes' (attributed to Candarave by Sitajara speaker)
Interjections are a special kind of particle. They usually end in /w/ or /y/ (possibly the final suffixes -ya or -wa). These were not elicited for all dial e c t s , so the following is probably an incomplete list.
achijuway 'it's hot!' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco) ach"ich"iw \
> expressions of pain (La Paz/Compi) ach"ik"iw J alalaw 'it's cold, brrr!' (La Paz/Compi, Corque) alalay 'it's cold, brrr!' (Corque) anay 'how pretty!' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco) atataw expression of pain (La Paz/Compi)

473

atatay expression of pain (La Paz/Tiahuanaco)

titila ~ titilay expression of disgust (La Paz/Tiahuanaco)

wa: ~ way

[bay]^

'wowl' expression of admiration or surprise (La Paz/Compi, La Paz/ Tiahuanaco, and probably elsewhere)

ju: 'wow!' expression of dismay (Hardman et al. 1975:1.170)

There are also several particles which are Spanish loans (see Hardman et al. 1975:3.134).

7-2.2 7-2.21

Syntactic suffixes Nonfinal (independent) suffixes

These suffixes occur on a stem before final suffixes. They may become part of a preceding noun or verb stem and be immediately followed by verbalization or nominalization, or they may occur after such thematic a l t e r n a t i o n . On inflected verbs they occur directly before the i n f l e c t i o n a l s u f f i x . A noun stem ending in -ki or -pini (etc.) may be a zero complement, the independent losing its final vowel. -raki (etc.) occurs after zero complement (Hardman et al. 1975:3.403-409).

7-2.21.1 -vki ~ -ji ~ -y 'just, only' (limitative)
The a l l o m o r p h / - j i / was heard in S a l i n a s and M o r o c o m a r c a in w o r d - f i n a l p o s i t i o n . T h e s e d i a l e c t s also have /-ki/ both medially and finally. The allomorphs

474

/-ki/ and /-y/ o c c u r r e d in S i t a j a r a . / - k i / occurs elsew h e r e . The s u f f i x r e q u i r e s a p r e c e d i n g v o w e l , e x c e p t in Huancane when following -raki. It loses its vowel before c o n s o n a n t - r e q u i r i n g s u f f i x e s , in zero c o m p l e m e n t vowel d r o p , when p r e c e d i n g the final s e n t e n c e suffix -sa in C a l a c o a , and when preceding the final suffix -sti in Si tajara.
/-ki/ may r e d u p l i c a t e on a s t e m . It f r e g u e n t l y occurs as a softener on verbs with the Imperative. Examples:

suma.ta.ji

'slowly' (Salinas)

suma.ta.ki

'gently' (La Paz/Compi)

k'acha.ta.ji 'slowly' (Morocomarca)

/ - p a n i / o c c u r s in J o p o q u e r i ; / - p i / o c c u r s in C a l a c a l a ; /-pini/ occurs in J u l i , S i t a j a r a , La P a z , Salinas, Calacala, and Morocomarca and was alleged by B e r t o n i o ( 1 6 0 3 b ) ; / - p u n i / o c c u r s in H u a n c a n g , S o c c a , C a l a c o a , and La Paz and was alleged by Tschopik (1948). As this i n d i c a t e s , /-pini/ and /-puni/ occur in La P a z , and /-pi/ and / - p i n i / occur in C a l a c a l a , /-pi/ e i t h e r before /-pini/ or before -pi sentence suffix. The m e a n i n g s of t h i s s u f f i x m a y be e x p r e s s e d in t r a n s l a t i o n as 'always', 'still', 'really', or 'definitely', but it is basically an e m p h a t i c . Examples:

Ina.ki.pini,w. 'It's really in vain.' (Calacala) ch ' uqi.pi.pini.k 'just potatoes, really' (Calacala) Uka.pi.ki.pi.y. 'It's just that, really.' (Calacala)

There seems to be some relation between this suffix and the sentence suffix -pi, although it may be due only to t h e i r partial h o m o p h o n y . As shown in the e x a m p l e given above for Calacala, /-pi/ allomorph of the nonfinal suffix may occur before /-pini/ or before -pi sentence s u f f i x , in both c a s e s with r e d u p l i c a t i o n of the s e g m e n t /pi/.

(It is a p r o d u c t i v e final suffix in J a q a r u ; see Hardman 1 9 6 6 . ) It is c l a s s i f i e d as a nonfinal s u f f i x in A y m a r a b e c a u s e its a l l o m o r p h /-rara/ has occurred before -raki nonfinal independent on a s t e m , / - r a y / occurs only in S i t a j a r a . /-:ra/ and /-ra/ occur in H u a n c a n S . /-:ra/ occurs in La P a z / C o m p i . /-rara/ occurs in J u l i ; /-rara/ and /-ra/ occur in Jopoqueri. Elsewhere /-ra/ or /-:ra/ occurs.
Some occurrences of /-ray/ may be analyzed as allomorphs of -raki (7-2.21.4). However, occurrences of /-ray/ on jani occupy the same slot as /-ra/ and /-rara/, with the same meaning, and therefore must belong to this suffix. Examples:

This suffix translates variously, as an aggregate, cautionary (see 6-3.34), complainer, objector, or challenger. It may occur on interrogatives immediately before or in place of the final suffix - s a . It occurs after zero complement vowel drop on a noun stem.
As for morphophonemics, this suffix requires a preceding vowel except after the complement/relational suffixes -na and -ta ~ -t"a and zero complement vowel d r o p . In o n e i n s t a n c e ( C a l a c a l a ) it w a s p r e c e d e d by a consonant on a verb root.
Dialects that have only /-raki/ are Juli, Socca, C a l a c o a , J o p o q u e r i , and La P a z . In H u a n c a n g this suffix often occurs instead of -sa interrogative; /-raki/ is the most usual allomorph, but /-raj-/ occurs before

480

-chi N I . In Salinas /-raj-/ occurs before consonantrequiring verbal inflectional suffixes; /-raji/ or /-rak"i/ occurs before vowel-requiring inflectional suffixes; /-raji/, /-raki/, /-ra:/ and /-ra/ alternate f r e e l y w o r d - f i n a l l y on i n t e r r o g a t i v e s . In C a l a c a l a and M o r o c o m a r c a / - r a j i / and /-raki/ both o c c u r .
In S i t a j a r a / - r a k i / and / - r a j i / a r e in free v a r i a tion medially before verbal inflections; the allomorph /-rk/ occurred once before verbal inflection; and /-ray/ also occurred before the final suffix -sa although a homophonous /-ray/ is the allomorph of the suffix -ra ~ - r a y in S i t a j a r a (see 7 - 2 . 2 1 . 3 ) . It m i g h t be better to a n a l y z e all o c c u r r e n c e s of / - r a y / in S i t a j a r a , both those on jani and o t h e r s , as an independent suffix resulting from the convergence of -ra 'yet' and -raki a g g r e g a t e and o v e r l a p p i n g the d o m a i n s of both in other dialects: on jani it means ' y e t 1 , and elsewhere it has the meanings of -raki. Examples of -raki and its allomorphs on different roots, stems, and themes are given below.

7-2.22 Final (sentence) suffixes

Final, or sentence, suffixes occur after all

other suffixes on nouns, verbs, and particles. They

mark phrase, clause, or sentence boundaries and play a

role in syntactic s u b o r d i n a t i o n . All except -11a ~ -ya

politive and

emphatic, which require a preceding vowel,

allow the preceding morpheme or syntactic considerations

to determine their preceding environments.

Final suffixes e n c o u n t e r e d in this research which

do not vary in p h o n e m i c shape or u s a g e from one d i a l e c t

to another are -cha alternative interrogative, -sa in-

formation interrogative/indefinite/linker, -sti follow-up,

-ti yes/no interrogative and negative,

emphatic,

and -wa a b s o l u t e . An unvarying suffix combination is

-wa.ya, consisting of -wa absolute plus -ya politive,

which almost always is accompanied by rising intonation

and always occurs in this form even in dialects which

have the allomorph /-11a/ instead of /-ya/ for the

politive (see below). All dialects sometimes have final

vowel length

a s a n e x c l a m a t o r y , and this may be in-

distinguishable from instances of /-ya/ reduced to /y/

after /i/.

484

Sentence suffixes which do show variation, either in locale of o c c u r r e n c e , frequency of o c c u r r e n c e , phonemic shape, or combinations thereof, are the topic/summarizer suffix -ka (probably a reduced form of aka or uka demonstratives), -11a ~ -ya politive, nn disclaimer and its variants, and -pi ~ -pi: ~ -pu ~ -pu: reiterator of absolute (stating information already known to the hearer). Sentence suffix combinations showing variation are -pi.11a ~ -pi.ya ~ -pi.:, -sa,ya ~ -sa .: , -xa.11a ~ -xa.ya, and -1i.xa w h i c h o c c u r s as a s u b o r d i n a t o r in c e r t a i n dialects and will be discussed under subordination (7-4.23.3).

7-2.22.1 -ka topic/summarizer and -xa ~ -: topic/ attenuator

Only one contemporary dialect, Calacala, was

found to have both -ka and /-xa/. Bertonio (1603b)

cited *ca (phonemically /ka/ or /qa/?) and + k h a

( p h o n e m i c a l l y /xa/ or / k " a / or / q " a / ? ) o c c u r r i n g in

environments apparently like those of -ka and -xa ~ -:

in contemporary d i a l e c t s . Most dialects today have only

/-xa/. Morocomarca was found to have only -ka and /-:/.

This /-:/ must be distinguished from other morphemes of

vowel length. It is clearly not

emphatic since it

o c c u r s in the same or s i m i l a r e n v i r o n m e n t s as / - x a /

attenuator with apparently the same function and meaning.

485
7-2.22.11 -ka topic/summarizer
T h i s suffix has o c c u r r e d o n l y in M o r o c o m a r c a and Calacala. At first it was thought that it might be *-qa cognate to Jaqaru -qa final suffix (Hardman 1966), or possibly a borrowing from Bolivian Quechua -qa topic marker, as all sources for Morocomarca and Calacala were
2 bilingual in Q u e c h u a . H o w e v e r , the suffix here referred to is clearly phonemically / k a / , beginning with the velar s t o p , and as noted in note 2 to Chapter 5, /k/ is not considered a normal reflex of /q/ in Jaqi 1anguages.
It was then thought that -ka might represent a falling-together of several suffixes, perhaps related to the Jaqaru final suffix -ja surprisal or to the Jaqaru noun suffix -ja accusative, cognate to Aymara zero complement (Hardman 1966). As we have seen, the a l t e r n a t i o n of /j/ ~ /k/ does o c c u r in A y m a r a and presumably might across Jaqi languages. The semantics of Jaqaru -ja surprisal do not correspond to the semantics of Aymara - k a , h o w e v e r , and Jaqaru -ja a c c u s a t i v e is cognate to Aymara zero complement, while Aymara -ka occurs on both subjects and complements.
Y a p i t a (La P a z / C o m p i ) , w h o a s s i s t e d me in a n a l y z ing a recorded Calacala text, indicated that he would replace most instances of -ka with -xa topic/attenuator.

486
The distributions of the two suffixes are not identical, however. Unlike most final suffixes, including -xa, -ka has not occurred before -11a ~ -ya p o l i t i v e in data analyzed so f a r . A n d , in some c a s e s , Yapita would replace -ka by either -xa topic/attenuator or the demonstrative uka as syntactic summarizer (7-4.3).
As will be seen in the e x a m p l e s that f o l l o w , -ka seems to function both as topic marker and as a summarizer of what precedes it in a s e n t e n c e . The latter function is fulfilled in all A y m a r a d i a l e c t s (including those that have -ka topic/summarizer) by the demonstratives uka and (to a l e s s e r e x t e n t ) a k a . In all A y m a r a d i a l e c t s , a l s o , aka and uka act like suffixes in phrases such as naya.n uka 'my house', literally 'mine, that' but conveying the sense of the French chez moi.
In the data analyzed for this s t u d y , -ka occurs only on nouns of the open class or the demonstratives aka and uka and usually only when they occur sentenceinitially or -finally. On the demonstratives, -ka recalls the noun suffix -:ka t h a t o c c u r s on d e m o n s t r a t i v e s in La Paz and Socca and possibly elsewhere (see 5-3.12.6). In one case in C a l a c a l a -ka ([§a]) is o b v i o u s l y a reduced form of uka 'chez', being followed by the noun suffix -na 'in, of': padre.[ga].n 'at the priest's (house)'. The suffix -ka might therefore be considered a noun suffix, but for the fact that when it occurs

487
word-finally (without a following -na) it seems to require something before it to summarize.
On aka and uka, which already have a potential summarizing function, -ka occurs directly on the root, w h e t h e r it is s e n t e n c e - i n i t i a l or - f i n a l . On o t h e r nouns the behavior of -ka is d i f f e r e n t . Sentence-initial nouns may take final -ka only if one or more derivational suffixes (or zero complement vowel drop, which acts like a s u f f i x ) p r e c e d e it on the stem; -ka does not occur directly on a plain noun root occurring sentence initially. On the other hand, sentence-final nouns are not so restricted. Such nouns may take the suffix -ka whether or not there are any derivational suffixes on the noun root.
All of this suggests that when it occurs wordfinally (with no other suffixes after it), -ka must have s o m e t h i n g b e f o r e it longer than a single r o o t . T h u s , in order to take -ka a sentence-initial noun must have suffixes on it. A sentence-final noun need not have such suffixes, because when -ka occurs on a sentencefinal noun, -ka summarizes not only the word it occurs on but all else that w e n t before it in the s e n t e n c e .
Although this hypothesis needs further testing, it appears that -ka is probably best analyzed at present as a reduced (but already frozen) form of uka or aka. More study of its occurrences is needed to determine

488
whether it should be considered a noun suffix, albeit one with a special summarizing function when it occurs wordf i n a l l y , or w h e t h e r it b e l o n g s in the final s u f f i x c l a s s , in w h i c h c a s e o c c u r r e n c e s of -ka f o l l o w e d by -na m u s t be considered morphophonemic reductions of aka or uka rather than occurrences of the final suffix -ka.
7 - 2 . 2 2 . 1 1 . 1 Distribution of -ka in M o r o c o m a r c a
-ka was rejected on certain nouns. It occurred on the f i r s t noun in a s e n t e n c e if the stem ended in -naka plural, a personal possessive suffix, or zero complement vowel d r o p , but it did not occur on plain noun roots that occurred first in a s e n t e n c e , unless they were zero c o m p l e m e n t s . H o w e v e r , Yapita (La P a z / C o m p i ) reported hearing -ka on the plain demonstrative aka occurring f i r s t in a s e n t e n c e , in an u t t e r a n c e by a s p e a k e r in t h e town of Morocomarca.
-ka did occur on plain nouns occurring at the end of a sentence. Where -ka was not permitted (namely, on plain roots o c c u r r i n g f i r s t in a s e n t e n c e ) , plain vowel or vowel length (probably an allomorph of -xa topic/attenuator; see 7-2.22.12) occurred. Vowel length did not occur on the last vowel of a sentence-final n o u n , where either -ka or plain vowel occurred. Examples of o c c u r r e n c e s and n o n - o c c u r r e n c e s of -ka in M o r o c o m a r c a are the following:

On the o t h e r h a n d , the /-:/ w h i c h o c c u r s in M o r o c o m a r c a may be the sole allomorph of this suffix occurring t h e r e . The allomorph of vowel length does not occur in S o c c a , J o p o q u e r i or La Paz d i a l e c t s e n c o u n t e r e d so f a r ; however, it was attested for Irpa Chico, Ingavi province, by H. Martfn (1969). Vowel length occasionally occurred i n s t e a d of /-xa/ in S i t a j a r a and Juli in m a t e r i a l t r a n s lated from S p a n i s h , but only on the first person pronoun. In J o p o q u e r i / - x a / was o c c a s i o n a l l y a b s e n t w h e r e it m i g h t be e x p e c t e d in La P a z .

In C a l a c a l a /-xa/ was found in all types of data, elicited and free; again, when /-:/ or plain vowel o c c u r r e d , it was usually on personal pronouns.
The suffix -xa ~ -: occurs most often on nouns, but also on verbs and particles.

The allomorph /-11a/ occurs e v e r y w h e r e e x c e p t in parts of La Paz (including Compi and T i a h u a n a c o ) and Morocomarca, which have only /-ya/. Both /-11a/ and / - y a / o c c u r in S i t a j a r a and H u a n c a n g . C a l a c o a has / - y a / in s o n g s , but /-11a/ e l s e w h e r e . In J u l i , S o c c a , Jopoq u e r i , S a l i n a s , and Calacala the usual allomorph is /-11a/.
This suffix occurs often as a softener of the imperative, occurring on the verb itself or on some other word in the s e n t e n c e . E x a m p l e s :

/-11a/ and /-ya/ may follow the final suffixes -xa and -pi (7-2.22.4); only /-ya/ follows -wa.
7-2.22.3 -m ~ -ma ~ -mna ~ -mnam disclaimer
In La Paz (as reported in Hardman et al. 1975: 3 . 4 2 0 ) this suffix o c c u r s in the form /-m/ p r e c e d e d by the limited final suffix -chi- (which occurs only before /-m/ or - x a ) , as in

The s e n t e n c e as g i v e n for La Paz was also a c c e p t a b l e in Juli, but not volunteered. Elsewhere expressions of this type were r e j e c t e d , but this may have been due to cultural, rather than grammatical, factors.
-mna is a p r o d u c t i v e final suffix in Jaqaru (Hardman 1966), and Bertonio cited a number of examples

501

(1603b:141-142, 250) of an apparently cognate suffix + -mna. Some contemporary examples offered by Vcisquez (La Paz/Tiahuanaco) are the following:

7-2.22.4 -pi ~ -pi: ~ -pu ~ -pu: reiterator of known i nformati on
The allomorph /-pu/ occurs only in S a l i n a s , Jopoqueri, Corque (which also has /-pu:/) and Sitajara (which also has / - p i : / ) . E l s e w h e r e / - p i / o c c u r r e d , e x c e p t in Calacoa where this suffix did not occur. Jopoqueri and Salinas have both /-pi/ and /-pu/. /-pi/ usually occurs in combination with /-11a/ or / - y a / , but /-pu/ does not. /-pu:/ occurred once before -xa. Examples:

7-2.22.5 Combinations of final suffixes 7-2.22.51 -pi.11a ~ -pi.ya
These occur more often than plain /-pi/. As /-pi.ya/ frequently reduces to /-pi.y/, indistinguishable from / - p i : / , it is not p o s s i b l e to tell which is o c c u r r i n g unless / - p i : / is f o l l o w e d by - x a . The d i s t r i bution of /-pi.11a/ and /-pi.ya/ does not exactly correspond to that of /-11a/ and /-ya/. Socca and Jopoqueri, which have only /-11a/ occurring without a previous final suffix, both have /-pi.ya/. Juli has both /-pi.ya/ and / - p i . 11a/, although it too has only plain /-11a/. Both / - p i . y a / and / - p i . 1 1 a / o c c u r in H u a n c a n g and S i t a j a r a . Neither occurred in C a l a c o a , M o r o c o m a r c a , or C a l a c a l a .

Basic Sentence Types

Basic s e n t e n c e t y p e s in A y m a r a have been a n a l y z e d and described by Hardman et al. (1975:3.425-458). Defined by occurrences of the four basic sentence suffixes, they are as f o l l o w s . (The order of the s u f f i x e s in each pair is not significant; the opposite order occurs also.)

Questions (-xa)/-ti (yes/no) -sa/(-xa) (information)

Answer/Statement (-xa)/-wa

The present research has turned up sentences with the suffix -ka (possibly a reduced form of aka or uka) in p l a c e of -xa in the i n f o r m a t i o n q u e s t i o n and in the answer/statement. A plain -ka statement also occurred. Schematically, the -ka sentence types may be written as

Question -sa/(-ka)

Answer/Statements (-ka)/-wa ^ka/0

(No e x a m p l e of a * ( - k a ) / - t i y e s / n o q u e s t i o n o c c u r r e d in the d a t a , but it may be presumed to exist.) Examples:

Morphosyntactic Processes Reduplication

This is a fairly p r o d u c t i v e process in A y m a r a . Certain noun roots are reduplicative, never occurring e x c e p t in d o u b l e d f o r m . T h e s e r o o t s are to be distinguished from other noun, particle, and verb roots that may occur alone or reduplicated; when reduplicated, they form stems that act as new semantic units with meanings derived from their base roots. Noun and verb roots and certain suffixes may also reduplicate interm i t t e n t l y f o r e m p h a s i s (a p r o c e s s h e r e r e f e r r e d to as 'nonce reduplication'). There are certain roots of the c a n o n i c a l s h a p e C 1 V ] C 2 C 1 V 1 i n w h l c h t h e i n i t i a l CV is r e d u p l i c a t e d (L.

A n o t h e r c o m m o n kind of r e d u p l i c a t i o n is that in w h i c h the r e d u p l i c a t e d noun root is s u f f i x e d with a complement/relational suffix or -ki nonfinal suffix. This kind of reduplication is common in all d i a l e c t s , and phrases formed thereby are a subclass of head-head noun phrases that are not necessarily reduplicative (see my t r e a t m e n t of this in H a r d m a n et a l . 1 9 7 5 : 3 . 3 7 5 376). Examples: Interrogati ve:
qawq"a.t qawq"a.t.s 'how many by how many?' (La Paz) Number:
may.ni,t may.ni.t 'one by one' (La Paz, Calacoa) may.ni.r may.ni.r may.ni,r 'one by one by one' (Sitajara) Other nouns: jaya.t jaya.tak 'after a long time, over a long distance'

Reduplication of suffixes differs from that of r o o t s in not u s u a l l y r e s u l t i n g in e m p h a s i s or p l u r a l i t y . Verbalization or nominalization may recur on a stem, as in the case of the v e r b a l i z e r -ka- b e l o w . The suffix -na p o s s e s s i v e / l o c a t i o n a l a l s o r e d u p l i c a t e s . In o r d e r to reduplicate, these suffixes must be separated by n o m i n a l i z a t i o n , in this case with -i r i .

The Socca example recalls the verb *kanka'to be' alleged by B e r t o n i o and his i m i t a t o r s (see 8 - 2 . 2 3 ) .
Verbal derivational suffixes which may reduplicate are -si- reciprocal/ref1exive, -ya- causative, the incompletive -j a- ~ - k a - , and the completive -xa-. (The incompletive and completive suffixes reduplicate only when s e p a r a t e d by -p- p l u r a l ) . In all d i a l e c t s the nonfinal independent suffix -ki may reduplicate for emphas i s , as may -pi nonfinal i n d e p e n d e n t in C a l a c o a . The noun/independent -jama reduplicates also. The only o t h e r noun s u f f i x t h a t has r e d u p l i c a t e d in this r e s e a r c h is -11a d i m i n u t i v e .

Subordination

Subordination is an important area of Aymara g r a m m a r . One kind of s u b o r d i n a t i o n occurs in the noun p h r a s e (see m y t r e a t m e n t of noun p h r a s e f o r m a t i o n in Hardman et al. 1975:3.363-379). Nouns may be subordinated

518

as m o d i f i e r s in noun p h r a s e s , w h i c h allow r e c u r s i v e embeddings of up to five nouns or nominalized forms, the head of the phrase constituting a sixth. Nouns within a noun phrase must be ordered. Example:

k"a: that

jach'a big

wila red
i

punku.n door
*

tinta store

taypi.n middle

'in the middle of that store with the big red door'

Such extensive noun embedding occurs rather infrequently The l o n g e s t noun phrase to occur in a free text in this research is the following from La Paz/Compi:

uka latinu.t that Latin
t

anu.mp dog
t

pari.ir talk

tata.x man
A

'that man who talked in Latin with a dog'

519

The basic Aymara verb phrase consists of a verb

w i t h one or m o r e c o m p l e m e n t s or r e l a t i o n a l s . In the a b o v e

e x a m p l e , latinu.t anu.mp parl.ir is a nominalized verb

phrase, consisting of the verb pari a-

'speak' with

-ta and -mpi relationals, nominalized with -iri 'actor'

(see 7-4.21.1).

The following examples are of verb phrases nomi-

nalized with the suffix -na (also see 7-4.21.2):

N o m i n a l i z a t i o n is o n e kind of s u b o r d i n a t i o n in A y m a r a . An inflected verb may not be nominalized, but a nominalized verb may be reverbalized and then inflected. Nominalized

520
verbs may take subjects, complements, or relationals. As we have s e e n , they m a y be e m b e d d e d in noun p h r a s e s . Embedding in verb phrases involves n o m i n a l i z e d forms serving as zero c o m p l e m e n t s and is m o r e limited than is e m b e d d i n g in noun p h r a s e s .
Two kinds of nominalization may be distinguished in A y m a r a : r e g u l a r and r e s t r i c t e d . Regular n o m i n a l i z a tion creates nominals which within certain syntactic and semantic limits may take any noun suffixes. Restricted nominalization creates nominals which have been found to take only the final noun suffixes -jama and -kama (the former a borderline independent), but they function syntactically like regular nominalized forms.
7-4.21 Regular nominalization
I previously analyzed this process in detail (Hardman et a l . 3 : 2 7 0 - 2 7 9 ) . Some changes in analysis are c o n t a i n e d in the p r e s e n t t r e a t m e n t .
7-4.21.1 -iri
T h i s suffix has two f u n c t i o n s . In the f i r s t it changes a verb to a (habitual) doer of the action of the v e r b . In the second it is a p u r p o s i v e . ^

phrases, and may be complements of verbs. They may fill the paradigm slot for 3+3 Simple tense without verbalizat i o n , as in

t"ugu.ru

'in order to dance, dancer'

In all Aymara d i a l e c t s a final verb root vowel /u/ overrides a following /i/ by regular morphophonemic rule, but it does not usually affect any subsequent /i/ as in this c a s e ; the word for 'dancer' in La Paz is t " u q u . r i . The rule in S a l i n a s may r e f l e c t an e a r l i e r stage of vowel harmony in the l a n g u a g e .
7-4.21.2 -vna
All verb roots may take -ha to form an infinitive (abstract noun of the action) which may or may not imply obligation. Most verb stems may also take -ha. Examples of verb roots and stems nominalized with -ha w e r e given in 7 - 4 . 2 .
Some verb stems do not take -ha if the stem does not take a human subject. The following examples show some s e m a n t i c c o n s t r a i n t s o p e r a t i n g in La Paz:

apa.ha 'to take' (human subject)

524

*ap.s.ta.ria 'for a human being to cloud over'

Qinaya.x ap.s.t.i.w. 'It clouded over.' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco)

cloud

3->-3

S

Although *ap.s.ta.na is not g r a m m a t i c a l , ap.s.t.i.w 'it clouded over' is, with an inanimate nonhuman subject. This recalls the behavior of verb themes created with the verbalizer -pta- (see 5-3.42.1). Some verb themes with -:- v e r b a l i z e r are similarly restricted in La P a z , e. g. 1upi.:- (from 1upi 'sunlight'), because the nominalized form *1upi.:.na means 'for a person to become sunlight'. Whether these semantic constraints operate s i m i l a r l y in other d i a l e c t s is not known at this t i m e .
Certain verb infinitives with -na may imply a nonhuman subject in one d i a l e c t but may permit a human s u b j e c t in o t h e r d i a l e c t s . An e x a m p l e is w a w a . c h a . n a , w h i c h in La Paz m e a n s 'for a n i m a l s to have o f f s p r i n g ' while elsewhere it is not restricted to animals but may be used also for people. (See 8-2.25 for a fuller discussion of verb subject semantics.)
Certain nominalizations with -na have derived meanings as concrete objects. Examples:

iki.na 'to sleep; bed, blanket, bedding' (general)

iya.na

'stone for grinding flour, etc.' (Juli) 'to grind' (Jopoqueri, Calacoa; possibly also Juli)
iy.ta.na 'to grind' (Compi)

525

jaka.na 'to live; life' (general)

jiwa.na 'to die; death' (general)

jist'a.na 'to close' (La Paz); 'door' (Calacoa) jist'a.ra.ha 'to open a door' (La Paz) jist'a.nta.ha 'to close1 (Calacoa) sit'a.na 'door' (Salinas) (for other variants,
see 3-4.23.1)

panta.na 'to err, make a mistake; error' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco)

picha.ha 'to sweep; broom' (La Paz)

sawu.na ('stoawuweanvoeu;n/wveerabvirnogo,t lo'otom'weave, weaving') (general)

uma.ha

'to drink' (general) 'drinking cup used at festivals' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco)

N o u n s e n d i n g in -ha b u t h a v i n g no c o r r e s p o n d i n g rb are the following, which must therefore be analyzed
unitary roots:

jaxt'ana

'ugly' (Sitajara; other variants, 3-5.24)

kankaha

'essence, nature, being, power' (La Paz) (See 8-2.23; not to be confused with homophonous nominalized verb kanka.na 'to fry')

kirkina

'plant for salad' (La Paz)

526

liwk'ana

'hoe' (Salinas)

simpaiia

7-4.21.21 -na abstraction of action
Verb i n f i n i t i v e s in c i t a t i o n form do not necessarily imply an obligation. Many cases of -na nominalizations are nonobligatory when serving as zero complements of other verbs, especially if the verb nominalized with -na occurs without a personal possessive suffix and the final suffix -wa does not occur in the s e n t e n c e .
Verbs that frequently take -na zero complements are the following:

ama:.na 'to want' (Sitajara)

muna.na 'to want' (elsewhere)

qallta.na 'to begin'

(general)

tuku.na 'to finish'

(general)

yanapa.na 'to help'

(general)

yati.na 'to know' (general)

yati.nta.na 'to learn by oneself' (Calacoa)

yati.qa.na

'to learn from someone else' (Calacoa) 'to learn' (elsewhere)

Most sentences with a main verb nominalized with -ha are translated as obligatory, especially when suffixed with -wa absolute (final suffix). Such sent e n c e s , which contain no i n f l e c t i o n , translate as 'it is necessary t o 1 , 'we/one m u s t 1 , or a passive construction.

528
Examples:
Yanap.xa.ria.w. 'It is necessary to help.' (Huancang)
Jira.na.wa. 'It is necessary to fertilize.' (Corque)
With uma 'water' as zero complement:
Um way.ta.na.wa. 'To bring up water is necessary.' (Sitajara, La Paz/Compi)
With uma 'water' as topic (or goal) of the action:
Uma.x way.ta.na.wa. 'Water has to be brought up.' (La Paz/Compi)(e. g. 'Water is to bring up.')
Uma.w way.ta.na.x. 'What has to be brought up is water.' (La Paz/Compi)
Sentences like the last three above are to be distinguished from sentences consisting of a noun phrase made up of a modifier with its final vowel retained (unless the three-vowel rule applies) and a nominalized verb as head, e. g.
Uma way.ta.na.wa. 'It's a place to bring up water from.' (i. e. a place to get water) (La Paz/ Compi)

529

A human third person topic m a y occur in a sentence with a -na nominalized verb.

Usu.ri,x un.ja.na.wa. 'The sick person

} to be

sick

see

3p

cared for.' (La Paz/Compi)

Apart from the above types of occurrences, which are believed to be general, several paradigms of -na obligatory may be c i t e d . Some are more common in certain d i a l e c t s than in o t h e r s .
A -na nominalized verb may be reverbalized and then inflected for all persons except 3+3. This paradigm has occurred in La Paz and J o p o q u e r i . The following are examples with 1+3 and 2+3 Simple tense inflections, from La P a z / C o m p i :

(Na.ya.x) chura.na.:. t.wa.

lp

give

1+3

S

'I have to give to X.'

(Juma.x) chura.na.:.ta.wa. 'You have to give to X.'

2p

~ ~ 2+3

S

A -na nominalized verb plus the possessor suffix -ni may also be verbalized and inflected, usually to e x p r e s s o b l i g a t i o n , as in the f o l l o w i n g e x a m p l e s from La Paz (Compi and T i a h u a n a c o ) . The paradigm is restricted

530

to 1+3, 2 + 3 , and 4 + 3 , with an uninflected unmarked form occurring instead of 3+3; the 4+3 form is uncommon and the p a r a d i g m as a w h o l e is less common than the preceding one. Examples of 1+3 S and the uninflected 3p form in this paradigm are

Apa.ha.ni.:.t.wa. 'I have to carry.'

carry

1+3

S

Apa.na.ni.wa. 'He/she/they has/have to carry.'

A m o r e common p a r a d i g m o c c u r r i n g in La P a z , J u l i , Jopoqueri, and Calacoa has -ha followed by one of the four personal possessive suffixes without verbalization or inflection. These forms act like inflected verbs but with a paradigm of only four persons. The third person complement is u n m a r k e d . The complete paradigm for La Paz is

1+3 (Naya.x) lp

chura.ha.xa.w. 'I have to give to X.'

give

Tp

2+3 (Juma.x) 2p

chura.ha.ma.w. ~ 2F

'You have to give to X.

3+3 (Jupa.x) 3p

chura.ha.pa.w. 'He/she/they has/have to

531

4+3 (Jiwasa.x) chura.ria.sa.w.

4p

— 4p

'We have to give to X.'

W h e n u s e d in the a b o v e p a r a d i g m , the p r o n o u n s r e d u n d a n t l y express subjects already expressed by the possessive suffixes. However, a verb nominalized with -na plus a personal possessive suffix may also function as the head of a noun phrase modified by a noun plus the complement/ r e l a t i o n a l suffix -na p o s s e s s i v e , as in the f o l l o w i n g examples from La Paz and Salinas:

1+3 (Naya.nj chura.fia.xa.w. 'I have to give to X.' (La Paz)

lp - give

Tp

(My giving is obligatory.')

1+3 (Naya.n) sara.na.na.w.

'I had to go.1 (Salinas) ('My going was obligatory.')

2+3 (Juma.n) sara.na.ma.w.

4+3 (Jiwasa.rQ sara.ria.sa.w. 'We had to go.' (Salinas)

4p

~

~ Tfp

An example of a possessive phrase of this type without a personal possessive suffix on the -na nominalized verb is the f o l l o w i n g , which has an unusual

532

reversed word order:

1+3 Sar.xa.na.w na.n.xa. 'I have/had to go.' (Sitajara)

go

— lp ~

In J o p o q u e r i and M o r o c o m a r c a and to some e x t e n t in La P a z , a -na n o m i n a l i z e d verb plus personal p o s s e s s i v e suffix may be reverbalized (with vowel length) and then inflected. Most often, 3+3 inflections occur, the subject then being the o b l i g a t i o n t h a t is p o s s e s s e d . In M o r o c o marca 1+3 and 2+3 inflections also occurred. Examples, all with the Remote Direct Knowledge tense, are as follows

Sar.xa.n.nha.:.:n.wa.

N o t e that in the second e x a m p l e given a b o v e for

La Paz/Compi the subject 2p pronoun juma does not corre-

spond to the 3p subject of the verbal inflection, 3+3

RDK -: n a . In the second e x a m p l e given for M o r o c o m a r c a ,

on the other hand, the 2p pronoun juma does correspond

to the 2p subject of the verb inflection, 2+3 RDK -yata.

Another paradigm built on a possessive phrase

acting as s u b j e c t o c c u r r e d in J o p o q u e r i , M o r o c o m a r c a ,

and C a l a c a l a . It was objected to by a speaker from

La Paz/Compi as sounding translated from S p a n i s h . It

uses the verb ut.ja.na 'to exist' with 3+3 i n f l e c t i o n ,

here the Simple tense

In J o p o q u e r i the p r o n o u n is

suffixed with -na; in M o r o c o m a r c a and Calacala it is

n o t , as in the case of La Paz/Compi m e n t i o n e d a b o v e .

Examples:

An example that occurred in a s e n t e n c e was

Juma kumpli.n.ma ut.j.i. 'You must comply.' (Calacala) 2p comply ~ 2p"
7-4.21.23 -na.taki subordination
The combination -ha plus -taki complement/ relational 'for' may be used as a purposive subordinate with a less narrow focus than -iri. However, verbs nominalized with -ha often take -taki as any other noun might, without subordination to another verb.

Liwru.x kuna.taki.sa ? 'What is the book for?'

book

what

Liwru.x liyi.na.taki.w. 'The book is for reading.' (La Paz) read

A paradigm on the verb j a q u . r p a : . h a 'to throw a w a y ' was e l i c i t e d in J o p o q u e r i on the basis of a form that o c c u r r e d in c o n v e r s a t i o n in S i t a j a r a : j a q u . r p a : . t . p a . t 'after his throwing a w a y , after he threw it a w a y ' , which has the personal possessive 3p -pa followed by -ta complement/relational, here meaning 'after'. This was the only instance for Sitajara of a personal possessive preceded by a consonant instead of a vowel and probably is a vestige of an earlier m o r p h o p h o n e m i c rule like that now o p e r a t i n g r e g u l a r l y in M o r o c o m a r c a and s p o r a d i c a l l y in J o p o q u e r i (see 5 - 3 . 2 4 ) .

It is d i f f i c u l t for a person w h o is not a n a t i v e speaker of Aymara to distinguish Calacala forms such as ma.n[d]a.ta.w 'entered', with -ta nominalizer, from the almost homophonous 3+3 RIK ma.n[d]a.taw(i) '(he) entered' if the final /i/ of the l a t t e r is d r o p p e d or d e v o i c e d .

7-4.22 Restricted nominalization

The restricted nominalizing suffixes are -sa, -sina ~ -sinarn ~ -sana ~ -sna, and -ipana.

7-4.22.1

~ sa v

and -ysina

(and

variants)

Distribution of these suffixes will be discussed first, and afterwards their functions and semantics.
In Juli and Socca -sa is rarely used except with sa.ha 'to s a y ' in e m b e d d i n g (see 7 - 4 . 4 ) . In all d i a l e c t s -sa is m o r e used t h a n - s i n a (and v a r i a n t s ) in sa.ha embedding. The allomorph /-sinarn/ occurred only once, in a t e x t from A c h o c a l l a , j u s t o u t s i d e the city of La P a z ; it is recognized by Yapita (La Paz/Compi) as a variant used in some a r e a s . The a l l o m o r p h / - s i n a / also o c c u r s

in A c h o c a l l a and in all other d i a l e c t s i n v e s t i g a t e d e x c e p t

Jopoqueri, Morocomarca, and Calacala, which have /-sana/.

Both /-sina/ and /-sna/ are used in J u l i , S o c c a , and parts

of La P a z , a p p a r e n t l y i n t e r c h a n g e a b l y .

Of the older sources, Bertonio (1603b) reported

b o t h sa and + - s i n a . L a B a r r e (1 9 5 0 ) c i t e d b o t h a l s o ,

but the former more often than the latter. Tschopik

(1948) sources evidently used +-sa rarely, with greater

+

+

use of /-sna/ and /-sina/, especially the former.

Two texts o b t a i n e d in m o s t d i a l e c t s i l l u s t r a t e

v a r i a t i o n in o c c u r r e n c e s of -sa and - s i n a (and v a r i a n t s

of the l a t t e r ) . The f i r s t is a saying about reporting

on the basis of personal knowledge (seeing with one's

own e y e s ) , which was o b t a i n e d in all A y m a r a d i a l e c t s

e x c e p t Calacoa and S i t a j a r a . The v e r s i o n o b t a i n e d in

Socca, which has / - s n a / , is given below. (Other ver-

The following is a breakdown of incidence of -sa and

545

- s i n a (arid v a r i a n t s ) in t h i s s a y i n g by t h e d i a l e c t a r e a s where it was obtained:

-sa (La Paz, Salinas) /-sina/ (Juli, Huancan6) /-sna/ (Socca) /-sana/ (Jopoqueri, Morocomarca)

In all v e r s i o n s the m a i n v e r b is s a . h a , u s u a l l y in the o b l i g a t o r y form s a . n a . w a , and the s u b o r d i n a t e verb is un.ja.na ~ in.ja.na 'to see'.
The second text is a riddle about a spindle, w h i c h w a s o b t a i n e d e v e r y w h e r e e x c e p t in S i t a j a r a , S o c c a , and H u a n c a n 6 . M o s t d i a l e c t s have -sa in this r i d d l e , as in the f o l l o w i n g v e r s i o n from S a l i n a s . (Other vers i o n s may be found in A p p e n d i x D . )

'A young woman turning, turning gets pregnant.' What is that? That is a spindle.'

546

Juli and La Paz use the same subordinate verb as that used here, muy.ka.ha; others are t"uqu.ha or t"uq.ta.na 'to dance, leap' (La Paz) and tan.ja.ha 'to run' (Jopoq u e r i ) . The following is the breakdown of i n c i d e n c e of the s u f f i x e s in this r i d d l e , by d i a l e c t :
-sa (La Paz, Juli, Jopoqueri, Salinas, Morocomarca)
/-sina/ (Juli, Calacoa)
Juli and Calacoa have the main verb usu.ri.:.ha 'to be ill' (euphemism for 'to be p r e g n a n t ' ) with d i f f e r e n t subordinate verbs. The versions with -sa have one of the following variants of 'to get pregnant, expand': q'i ta. ha (Salinas and Jopoqueri), q ' i nta.ha (Salinas), q ' i pta.ha ( J u l i ) , and q"i p t a.n a (La P a z ) .
It seems that where La Paz d i a l e c t s would use -sa or / - s i n a / , Juli and Socca would use either /-sina/ or /-sna/, except that those dialects do use -sa with sa.ha, as noted above. Use of both /-sna/ and /-sina/ in one s e n t e n c e in a folk tale is the f o l l o w i n g from Juli.

This heavily subordinated sentence closes the story of a skunk-turned-man who attends and ultimately disrupts a wedding.
As for function and s e m a n t i c s , -si na is sometimes used when the subjects of the main and subordinate verb are d i f f e r e n t , in parts of La Paz (for example A c h o c a l l a ) w h e r e the use of -ipana ( 7 - 4 . 2 2 . 2 ) is r a r e . Dialects having -i pana use -i pana when the subjects are different, and use -sa and -sina (or variants of the latter) when the subjects are the same.
Some writers have claimed that -sa indicates an action simultaneous with the action of the main verb, while -sina indicates an action occurring before the action of the main v e r b . This claim is not supported by e v i d e n c e o b t a i n e d in this s t u d y . N u m e r o u s e x a m p l e s o b t a i n e d in free t e x t s u n d e r m i n e any a r g u m e n t for a simultaneous/nonsimu1taneous distinction (or any other consistent distinction) between -sa and -sina,as will be seen below.

548

A speaker from Morocomarca accepted the first of the following pair, with /-sana/, but rejected the second, with -sa.

Jamach'i ap.ta.si.sana , sar.x.i.wa.

bird

pick up

go 1+3

S

'Picking up the birds, he left.' (Morocomarca)

*Jamach'i ap.ta.si.sa , sar.x.i.wa.

The reason for rejection of /-sa/ in this context is probably s e m a n t i c , but is yet to be d e t e r m i n e d with certainty. The role of the final suffix -wa must be taken into account in d e t e r m i n i n g the factors conditioning acceptability.
In Compi and T i a h u a n a c o it a p p e a r s that -sa implies more personal knowledge of the subordinated topic than does -sina (Hardman et al. 1975:3.234-235). On the basis of present evidence this distinction cannot be confirmed for Aymara as a w h o l e . Both -sa and -sina (and variants) may take -wa absolute sentence suffix, and like -si na, -sa may occur with the Remote Indirect K n o w l e d g e t e n s e in s t o r i e s . E x a m p l e s :

'The fox, very content, feeling happy, dancing, turning, went away carrying the spirits (birds), taking a main road.' (Salinas)

The suffix -sina does occur in personal knowledge a c c o u n t s . An e x a m p l e of / - s i n a / in d i s c u s s i o n of one's c h i l d h o o d (a c o n t e x t w h e r e p e r s o n a l k n o w l e d g e f o r m s w o u l d be e x p e c t e d ) is the f o l l o w i n g , in w h i c h it is used w i t h two subjects:

Uka.n jila.wa:.sin.xa propietario na.ru.x

there grow

owner

lp

intirisi.way.x.itu.x. interest

'There, where I had grown up, the owner began to take an interest in me.' (Achocalla)

An example of /-sina/ with the sentence suffix -wa is the following from Huancan6:

550

Ikiisa.t jich"a.x mistu.w.sina.w <Kawki.s awkchi.x

RIK

'Now coming out of the church, "Where will the father arrive, your father will arrive," they said.' ('Coming out of the church, they asked him when his father would arrive.')

An example of /-sna/ with -wa sentence suffix occurred

in the Socca v e r s i o n of the saying a b o u t seeing with one's

own e y e s . The s a m e Socca s o u r c e used / - s n a / in an a c c o u n t

of his younger days.

On the basis of the inconclusive evidence here

adduced, it appears that the distinction, if any, between

-sa and -sina is now becoming b l u r r e d . E i t h e r suffix may

serve to indicate

simultaneous or previous action,

s u b j e c t to c e r t a i n s e m a n t i c r e s t r i c t i o n s i n h e r e n t in

verb roots and stems. Either may indicate personal or

nonpersonal knowledge. Semanti c restrict ions governing

the use of the suffixes may be shared by several dia-

lects or may be d i a l e c t - s p e c i f i c . Further study is

needed to establish the facts about the two suffixes.

551
7-4.22.2 -ipana and variants
As noted above, this suffix is used when the subjects of the main verb and of the subordinate verb are d i f f e r e n t . Time is not the significant f a c t o r , as the -ipana subordinated action may take place before, during, or after the action of the main verb.
This suffix is used only infrequently in certain d i a l e c t s , e s p e c i a l l y t h o s e of La P a z . In J a q a r u t h e r e e x i s t s a c o g n a t e s u b o r d i n a t i n g p a r a d i g m of 11 p e r s o n s , with two separate suffixes for 3+3, one used when the subjects of the main and subordinate verb are the same and one when t h e y are d i f f e r e n t . In the Jaqaru p a r a d i g m -ipana occupies the 3+3 slot for different subjects (Hardman 1966). Only one Aymara dialect, Morocomarca, has been found to have a productive use of more than -ipana, and that dialect has a paradigm of only four persons: 1+3, 2+3, 3+3, and 4+3. Although no attempt was m a d e to e l i c i t the p a r a d i g m in C a l a c a l a , it probably occurs there also; the -ipana form occurred more often in C a l a c a l a texts than in any o t h e r s .
In J o p o q u e r i , S a l i n a s , and H u a n c a n e o n l y 3+3 - i p a n a o c c u r r e d s p o n t a n e o u s l y in t r a n s l a t i o n s of Spanish e l i c i t a t i o n s e n t e n c e s and in f r e e t e x t s , but f o r m s for 1+3, 2+3, and 4+3 were acceptable there.

552

The paradigm was also reported by Bertoriio, but he noted that only the first person + - i j a n a, second p e r s o n + - i m a n a , and t h i r d p e r s o n i pana w e r e in general use, the form +-isana (which we call fourth person) being very rare in the p r o v i n c e of C h u c u i t o and ipana being used more often for all persons (Bertonio 1603b:37).
A t t e m p t s to e l i c i t the p a r a d i g m in d i a l e c t s lacking it, using sentences translated from or similar to Jaqaru sentences cited by Hardman (1966) or based on e x a m p l e s g i v e n by B e r t o n i o ( 1 6 0 3 b ) , r e s u l t e d in A y m a r a sentences with a variety of tenses or nominalized forms. The following sentence was inspired by an example cited by B e r t o n i o (1 6 0 3 b : 2 3 4 ) w h i c h had + - i j ana on t h e s u b o r dinated verb:

( E x a m p l e s on the v e r b sa.na 'to s a y ' are g i v e n in 7 - 4 . 4 . ) /-ipana/ occurs relatively infrequently on ver-
balized n o u n s . In La P a z , v e r b a l i z a t i o n w i t h -:- followed by /-ipana/ means 'thanks t o ' , unless -1ayku 'on account o f ' is also on the s t e m , in which case v e r b a l i z a tion plus /-ipana/ means 'due to', sometimes with a connotation of blame.

7-4.23 Subordination with final suffixes 7-4.23.1 -sa11
This suffix may be used to link sentences as well as parts of sentences. It also occurs on interrogatives (see 5-2.1) and on jani negative (7-4.52). In the following examples -sa usually t r a n s l a t e s as 'if':

558

7-4.23.2 -xa topic/attenuator
This suffix often acts like a subordinator of verbs in La Paz (Hardman et a l . 1 9 7 5 : 3 . 4 5 3 ) . Other dialects, such as Sitajara, Salinas, Calacala, and Jopoqueri, more frequently use other types of subordination. The following examples all occurred with different subj e c t s for the main and s u b o r d i n a t e v e r b s . In m o s t cases the tense of the main and the subordinate verb is the s a m e . (No examples of /-:/ allomorph of -xa topic/attenuator or of -ka final suffix occurred as subordinators. )

7-4.23.3 -ti.xa and -ti.ya
These combinations occur on interrogatives (see 7 - 4 . 2 4 ) , d e m o n s t r a t i v e s , and v e r b s . -1i.xa is more f r e q u e n t than - t i . y a ; in f a c t , no e x a m p l e s of -ti.ya occurred in the data for this s t u d y , a l t h o u g h it did occur in data from La Paz used by Hardman et al . (1975). -ti.xa has occasionally occurred as subordinator without a following uka summarizer in the sentence (see 7 - 4 . 2 4 and 7 - 4 . 3 ) , but only in the speech of persons associated with missionary groups. Examples:

<Wali gam.iri.mpi.raki.w wawa.x kasara.ya.si.ja.x ,

7-4.24 Interrogative as indefinite (translating as relative)
Interrogatives serving as indefinites usually occur with -ti.xa, but may instead occur with -sa indefinite or -xa a t t e n u a t o r , and it is the final suffixes rather than the interrogatives that perform the subordination. Interrogatives trans 1ating as relatives are often followed by uka resumator. Examples:

562

Persons educated or influenced by missionaries use more interrogatives as relatives than do other Aymara speakers. In m i s s i o n a r y u s a g e uka is often left o u t . Examples are g i v e n in 9 - 5 .

7-4.3 uka linker and summarizer

The demonstratives uka 'that' and (to a lesser

extent) aka 'this' are used as sentence linkers and

summarizers throughout the Aymara-speaking world, uka

is by far t h e m o s t f r e q u e n t l i n k e r and s u m m a r i z e r in 12

all types of discourse.

A folk tale about a lake

bird ( w a l 1 a t a ) and a f o x , told in S o c c a , c o n t a i n s a

total of 36 instances of uka and derived forms built

on it and two instances of ak"ama 'like this'. A folk

t a l e told in H u a n c a n g a b o u t a f o x - t u r n e d - m a n who m a r r i e s

a rich girl contains 56 instances of uka and derived

forms. While a controlled statistical study has yet to

be m a d e , it appears that the most common forms are uka.ta

'then' as linker and uk"ama 'like that, so, thus' as

both linker and summarizer. Examples of uka as sentence

1 inker:

Uka.t ma: qamaqi.xa sara.tayn jisk.t'.iri.

tnen a fox

go 3->-3 ask

RIK

'Then a fox went to ask.' (Socca)

563

Uka.n wawa.pa.r nutifika.sitayn s.i.w.

Uka.r jani.y jiq"a.ta.:.n muna.tayna.t s.i,w.

no

meet

want 3+3

RIK

'At that he didn't want to meet him, they say.' (Huancane)

Examples of uka as linker and summarizer:

Uka.ru.sti kun ma: urnu.ru uka.x p"ich.kata. :t

Then

a oven

YRaTT" stoke fire 2+3

F

F

gallu.nak sa.s. children say

'"Then in an oven, (in) there, you will build up a fire, your children in that you will carefully put, just like that, your little ones," saying.' (Socca)

M a n y of the o t h e r e x a m p l e s in this c h a p t e r contain instances of uka summarizer and its derived forms. Examples as subject, zero complement, and -ru relational are found in 7 - 4 . 2 4 . Hardman et al. ( 1 9 7 5 : 3 . 4 5 4 - 4 5 5 ) gave other examples showing greater depth of embedding.

564

7 - 4 . 4 sa.fla e m b e d d i n g
T h e v e r b sa.fia 'to s a y ' (see 6 - 4 ) is u s e d in all dialects as a reportive, to embed direct quotes.
7-4.41 sa.na with Simple tense
The simplest use of sa.ha as embedder is the verb with 3+3 Simple tense, s.i, often suffixed with -wa a b s o l u t e , as in the f o l l o w i n g :

Jaya timpu.xa inka.xa taqi.ru.wa mant.iri.:n

far time

Inca

all

order 3+3

RDK

s.i.w. S

'Long ago, the Inca ruled over everything, they say.' (Jopoqueri)

W h a t o c c u r s b e f o r e s.i.w in the a b o v e e x a m p l e is a complete sentence, with -wa absolute on taqi.ru and with the Remote Direct Knowledge tense on the verb. Without the addition of s.i.wa the sentence would imply that the speaker had personal experience on which to base his statement. Adding s.i.wa indicates that the speaker is reporting information received at second hand.

565

7-4.42 sa.na with Imperative tense
The 2+3 Imperative on sa.na, sa.m(a) 'tell h i m / h e r / t h e m ' , is considered rude when said alone but it may occur to embed another Imperative verb. Examples:

<Chur.itm> sa.ma. 'Tell him "Give me".'

give 2+1

('Tell him to give you . . .') (HuancanS)

I

A m o r e c o m p l e x e m b e d d i n g of sa.ha w i t h the I m p e r a t i v e is the following:

Tiyu Juwana.x ak"am s.i.w

uncle Juan

thus 3+3

S

<Jut.pan> sa.m s.i.w.

come 3+3

2+3 3+3

IIS

'Uncle Juan thus said, "'Let him/her come', say," he said.' ('Uncle Juan wants you to come.') (La Paz/Compi)

This last example is a reduced form of a longer sentence with four embeddings of sa .na.

Tiyu Juwana.x ak"am s.i.w 3+3 S

566

Such extensive embedding of quotes is quite impossible in E n g l i s h . The s e n t e n c e may be i n t e l l i g i b l y rendered as 'Uncle Juan told me to tell you that he would like you to c o m e ' , or more b r i e f l y , as in the r e d u c e d v e r s i o n given first above, 'Uncle Juan wants you to come'.
7-4.43 sa.ha with subordinators -sa and -si na (or variants)
As we have just s e e n , when an actual quote is embedded in Aymara a t r a n s l a t i o n that does not use a direct quote may best convey the meaning of the sentence. This is also true of the f o l l o w i n g , in which sa.ha occurs once inflected and once with -sa subordinator.

Na.x sa.rak.sma.sa.y <apa.ni.w.ja.m> sa.sa.y.

1+2

bring

2+3

S

I

'I already said to you, "Bring it", saying.' ('I already told you to bring it.') (Calacoa)

In the f o l l o w i n g e x a m p l e the 3p s u b j e c t of the embedded quote is identical with the a d d r e s s e e .

Naya.x ^ Juwana.w naya.r t'ant' chur.itani y

'I "Juana will give me bread" saying said to Ana Maria.' ('I told Ana Maria that you (Juana) would give me bread.') (La Paz/Tiahuanaco)

567

The above type of embedding is very common, but when the addressee is also the subject of the embedded quote a different structure may be used, according to Yapita (La P a z / C o m p i ) . In this s t r u c t u r e the 2p pronoun replaces the 3p subject of the quote, but remains outside the quote.

Naya.x juma.w

sa.sa.w

s.ista Ana Mariya.ru.

'I (speaking of) you "She will give me bread" saying said to Ana Marfa.1 ('I told Ana MarTa that you would give me bread.1)
The example above is evidence of what Hardman calls overmarking of the second person in A y m a r a , a phenomenon tied to the operation of the four-person system (see 8-2.1 ).
Examples of sa.na embedding in longer sentences are the following, with -sa or -sina subordination and with the use of sa.na as obligatory. The first example comes from a comment on why fiestas often degenerate into f i g h t s , from a source in J u l i . The second is from a d e s c r i p t i o n of the end of the fiesta of San Juan in Si t a j a r a .

T h e s e t r a n s l a t i o n s are t e n t a t i v e , in view of my unfamiliarity with the events described and the somewhat telegraphic nature of the description, at least to someone

In c e r t a i n c o n t e x t s , e s p e c i a l l y when the s u b j e c t of the main verb (sa.na) and the embedded verb are the same person, the sentence indicates that the subject is thinking of doing or wanting to do something. The Future or D e s i d e r a t i v e tense is used on the e m b e d d e d verb. Examples:

This occurs i n f r e q u e n t l y . It is sometimes used as a comparative (Hardman et al. 1975:3.235), especially by missionary-instructed persons; such use has occurred only once in this r e s e a r c h , in a r e w o r k i n g by VSsquez of a Bertonio (1603b) example (which had neither sa.ha nor -ipana).

On the other h a n d , sa.ha embedding may be used to convey a visual rather than an auditory image, as in the f o l l o w i n g :

The first example given for sa.ha embedding (7-4.41) was from a story, and the other types of e m b e d d i n g m e n t i o n e d a b o v e occur in tales as well as in c o n v e r s a t i o n . Complex embeddings especially characteristic of storytelling style involve frequent use of -sa subordinator (less often -sina and variants or -ipana), sa.ha with 3+3 Remote tenses or 3+3 NonInvolver, and the plain s.i.w, all together.

Negation

Negation may affect most of the syntactic processes already d e s c r i b e d . It usually requires the presence of the negative p a r t i c l e jani or the reduced form n_K The l a t t e r is m o r e p r e v a l e n t in S a l i n a s and Calacoa but also o c c u r s e l s e w h e r e , e s p e c i a l l y in n i . k u n a 'nothing' and ni.k"iti 'no o n e ' , acting like a prefix (the only one in the l a n g u a g e , if one d i s c o u n t s /si-/ and /ji-/ on sa.na) ni may also occur on the interrogative verb kama.cha.na, as in t h e f o l l o w i n g s e n t e n c e from J o p o q u e r i :

the noun/independent suffix -jama; jani.ra ~ jani.ray

(the second from Sitajara) 'not yet'; jani. kucha 'better 14

not' and jan.kucha

'or if not'; and jani.ch 'isn't

that so?' (with -cha alternate question suffix). One

form t h a t o c c u r r e d only in C a l a c a l a was j a n a : 'isn't

that so?' . 7-4.51 Negation of basic sentences

B a s i c s e n t e n c e s w e r e d i s c u s s e d in 7 - 3 . T h e basic negative statement (Hardman et al. 1975:3.432) consists of jani plus -wa absolute; -ti sentence suffix w h e r e -wa w o u l d be in an a f f i r m a t i v e s e n t e n c e ; and -xa o p t i o n a l l y on other w o r d s in the s e n t e n c e . E x a m p l e :

T'ant'a.x jani.w ut.j.k.i.ti. 'There is no bread.'

bread

exist 3+3

(La Paz/Compi)

S

A basic negative statement may be changed to a negative yes/no question by removing the -wa on jani and replacing it by the -ti from the v e r b , as follows:

578

T'ant'a.x jani.t ut.j.k.i ?

bread

~~

"3+3

S

'Isn't there any bread?' (La Paz/Compi)

A negative answer to a -sa/(-xa) information question without any verbal inflection retains the interrogative as an indefinite, verbalized and suffixed w i t h - s a , and adds jani p l u s - w a , r e s u l t i n g in a - s a / - w a sentence:

Kuna.s uka.xa ? what that

(Uka.x) jani.w

kuna.:.k.i.sa. ~3+3 S

'What is that? (That) isn't anything.' (La Paz/Compi)

A negative answer to a -sa/(-xa) information question containing an inflected verb consists of jani plus -wa; the i n t e r r o g a t i v e with - s a ; and if the verb is r e p e a t e d , it takes -ti .

Kuna.s ut.j.i ? Jani.w kuna.s

All other negative sentences or phrases may be 15
derived from these basic sentences. (Negative forms of the i n f l e c t e d verb sa.na 'to s a y 1 w e r e given in 6-4). 7-4.52 Incompletive and completive verbal derivational
suffixes with the negative
In the e x a m p l e s a b o v e , the verbs contain the i n c o m p l e t i v e verbal d e r i v a t i o n a l - k a - in t h e s t e m . In La P a z , J u l i , H u a n c a n 6 , S o c c a , S i t a j a r a , and Calacoa the v e r b or v e r b a l i z e d noun in a n e g a t i v e s t a t e m e n t usually has the incompletive -ka-. The completive -xas o m e t i m e s o c c u r s i n s t e a d (or in a d d i t i o n ) , but less o f t e n . In S a l i n a s , J o p o q u e r i , C a l a c a l a , and M o r o c o m a r c a the incompletive or completive suffixes are more often absent with the negative.
The f o l l o w i n g all occurred in S a l i n a s .

Ni.w mun.k.irijt.ti. - 1+3 — D-1

'I wouldn't like to.'

Ni.w mun.t.ti. 1+3 S

'I don't want to.'

The dialects where the incompletive occurs less often, have it on nouns verbalized with -ka- or -:- with the Simple t e n s e , but not if verbalization is followed by a Remote tense. Examples:

Jani.w aka.n.k.j.i.ti. here "3+3 S

The meaning differences between forms with and without

581

the i n c o m p l e t i v e are often lost in t r a n s l a t i o n , but the following pair shows one contrast:

'I don't know.' (Jopoqueri)

Jani.w yat.k.t.ti. ~]+3 S

'I don't know yet.'

(Jopoqueri)^

Dialects that usually have -ka- on the negative do not have it with the Future tense used as a polite command.

The final vowel of jani d r o p s in noun p h r a s e s and when m o d i f y i n g n o m i n a l i z e d v e r b s ; in negative information questions and answers thereto; with the Imperative; and with verbs subordinated with a sentence suffix, uka, or sa.ha embedding.
7-4.53.31 Negative noun phrases or nominalized verbs
These are derived from the basic negative statem e n t . When m o d i f y i n g the head noun in a noun p h r a s e , jani loses its final vowel, except that when modifying an i n t e r r o g a t i v e , jani loses its initial /ja/. The following occur generally unless otherwise noted.

Summary and Conclusion

S y n t a c t i c and m o r p h o s y n t a c t i c v a r i a t i o n in A y m a r a is s l i g h t . M o r p h e m e s showing some v a r i a t i o n in p h o n o logical shape are the particles, the independent nonfinal and final suffixes, and some of the nominalizing (subordinating) suffixes: the little-used -wi ~ -:wi ~ -awi and the more common -sina (and variants) and -ipana (and variants).
The final suffix inventory varies a little from one dialect to another. The suffix -ka has been found o n l y in C a l a c a l a and M o r o c o m a r c a . T h e vowel length allomorph of -xa ~ -: topic/attenuator does not occur in La P a z , S o c c a , or J o p o q u e r i . The d i s c l a i m e r ha (and v a r i a n t s ) has o c c u r r e d o n l y in H u a n c a n 6 and parts of La Paz.
Morphosyntactic processes are essentially the same in all d i a l e c t s . The southern group of d i a l e c t s (Jopoqueri, Salinas, and Morocomarca) plus Huancan6 in the north have a f o u r - m e m b e r s u b o r d i n a t i n g paradigm of which the 3+3 -i pana (or v a r i a n t s ) is the sole m e m b e r in other d i a l e c t s ; in some parts of La Paz even -ipana is falling into disuse. The use of -xa topic/attenuator as a s u b o r d i n a t o r of verbs a p p e a r s to be more c o m m o n in La Paz dialects than in dialects that make greater use of -sina or -ipana subordination.

T h e r e is some v a r i a t i o n in the s e m a n t i c s of the subordinators -sa, -sina (and variants) and -ipana (and v a r i a n t s ) , and in u s e of the final s u f f i x c o m b i n a tion -ti.xa as a subordinator, but regional patterning (if any) of this semantic variation is y e t to be determined.

Notes

This may be a Spanish loan. According to Bello (1847:36), there was an archaic interjection guay ~ gug that persisted in certain c o u n t r i e s of Latin A m e r i c a , as in the e x p r e s s i o n s

Guay 1 a mujer! 'Wow! Look at that woman.'

Guay 1o que dice! 'Wow! Did you hear what she said!'

Bertonio (1603b:51) also reported this interjection and a number of others identical or similar to contemporary Aymara ones.

structure. One of them, upu upu, occurs with juncture (phonetically a glottal stop) before the repetition of the root.

c -iri sometimes occurs on nouns after vowel-

'The door slammed.' ('The door went "thud".')

According to Yapita there is no general term for 'sound' in A y m a r a ; a n u m b e r of o n o m a t o p o e i c w o r d s are used (see Appendix B).

Like -ti, -wa (or another sentence suffix rep l a c i n g it) m a y occur on a form other than jani in a negative sentence; see the examples under 7-4.53.

Introduction

A d i s c u s s i o n of v a r i a t i o n in A y m a r a s e m a n t i c s m u s t be based on an examination of what Hardman (in press a) calls the linguistic postulates of the language: categorizations recurring at different levels of grammar and reflected in cultural n o r m s . An u n d e r s t a n d i n g of their nature and pervasiveness is needed in order to describe certain differences in their m a n i f e s t a t i o n s in d i f f e r e n t d i a l e c t s (for e x a m p l e , in s e l e c t i o n a l r e s t r i c t i o n s on v e r b s u b j e c t s and complements) especially to show differences between Missionary, Patrdn, and Radio Aymara on the one hand, and other Aymara dialects on the other (see Chapter 9).
R e g i o n a l s e m a n t i c v a r i a t i o n in the noun and v e r b systems includes instances of one form with different meanings cross-dialectically, and conversely, cases of different A y m a r a f o r m s o c c u r r i n g in d i f f e r e n t d i a l e c t s w i t h a p p a r e n t l y the same meanings. At the present state of research, which relies heavily on translation, decisions as to what constitute

592

593

'same' and 'different' meanings within and across dialects are at best tentative and at worst may be wrong, lacking s u f f i c i e n t input from native s p e a k e r s . The e v i d e n c e in this chapter concerning such m e a n i n g s is therefore to be viewed with some skepticism.
Aymara metaphor has not as yet been investigated cross-dialecta1ly, but certain characteristics based on the evidence of a few dialects may be noted.

8-2

Linguistic Postulates

All regional dialects of Aymara share certain linguistic postulates common to the Jaqi languages. As identified by Hardman (1972a) the most important of these are (1) four grammatical persons (the fourth includes speaker and addressee), (2) distinction of human/nonhuman, and (3) specification of data source (distinction of directly and indirectly acquired knowledge). These three postulates are marked t h r o u g h o u t Aymara l a n g u a g e s t r u c t u r e , in m o r p h o l o g y , s y n t a x , and s e m a n t i c s , and reflected in cultural norms.
During four hundred years of contact with S p a n i s h , an Indo-European language, it might be expected that Spanish p o s t u l a t e s would m a k e inroads into A y m a r a . In C h a p t e r 9 e v i d e n c e of such inroads is given with respect to M i s s i o n a r y , Patron, and Radio A y m a r a , translation dialects spoken by certain native speakers of Aymara who are bilingual in Spanish. The Aymara of other bilingual and monolingual speakers shows

594

relatively little influence of Spanish postulates, however. A few exceptions are noted below. A section on optional marking of plural in Aymara is included after a discussion of the postulates.
8-2.1 Four-person system
The four-person system is manifested in personal pronouns and possessive suffixes (5-2.3 and 5 - 3 . 2 4 ) and in verbal inflectional suffixes (6-3). It is intimately bound up with the distinction of human/nonhuman (8-2.2) and with the expression of courtesy in A y m a r a . The fourth person is o f t e n used in the c o n t e x t of e a t i n g or d r i n k i n g . For e x a m p l e , polite ways to tell someone that dinner is ready would be

Manq'a.si.nani.

eat

4+3

F/I

'Let's eat, you and I.' (La Paz)

Almus.t'a.wa.tana.

1 unch

4+3

F/I

'Let's eat lunch.' (Calacoa)

S i m i l a r l y , if one wishes to ask for a drink of water one must use the fourth person, including the addressee even if he or she is being asked to provide the w a t e r .

595

Uma.ma.y water 2p

wax.t'a.si .rian,

invite

4->3

F/I

mam,

uma.t water

par.j.itu.w. lack 3->l
S

'Please let's you and I invite (someone to have some of) your water, ma'am, I'm thirsty.' (La Paz)
('Please let me have some water.')

An example of the fourth person used in the context of drinking even when the a d d r e s s e e is not or was not involved in the a c t i o n , is the f o l l o w i n g , describing the serving of chi cha:

May.ni.r another

may.ni.r another

may.n.ir another

siwr.tan . . . serve 4->3
S

'One by one by one we (you and I) serve them . . . ' (Sitajara)

Another example involving eating was given by Tschopik (1948: 110). A condor says to a fox who has challenged him to a duel

+Jiwa.ta.chapi .ru.sti manq'a.nta.si.nani.wa.

one who is dead and eat

4->3

F/I

'And the one who is dead you and I will eat.'

What is meant is that the winner of the duel will eat the loser.

596

Bertonio (1603b:194, 195) said, concerning the 4p
possessive suffix,
. . . the particle s a , although . . . it means inclusion . . . for politeness or friendship may be used even when the item belongs only to one of the two persons who are talking . . .
Bertonio gave these examples.

*Ut.sa.ru ma.tana.

house 4p

go 4+3

F/I

'Let's go to my/our/your house.'

+ A k a yapu awki.sa.n.k.i. 'This field is our/my/your

this field father

father's.'

Bertonio's translations of these two examples are rejected by La Paz s p e a k e r s , even when the examples are rendered into c o n t e m p o r a r y A y m a r a . If B e r t o n i o ' s t r a n s l a t i o n s w e r e correct, they imply that the fourth person was used even more in the e x p r e s s i o n of courtesy in late 16th c e n t u r y Juli than in c o n t e m p o r a r y dialects so far e n c o u n t e r e d .
H a r d m a n has pointed to a related p h e n o m e n o n in A y m a r a , the o v e r m a r k i n g of the s e c o n d p e r s o n ( H a r d m a n e t al . 1 9 7 5 : 3 . 3 2 - 3 3 ) . (For an e x a m p l e of this o v e r m a r k i n g in sa.ha embedding see 7-4.4.)
In spite of the i m p o r t a n c e of the f o u r - p e r s o n system in A y m a r a , there is e v i d e n c e of its i n c i p i e n t e r o s i o n in some d i a l e c t s . In S i t a j a r a , lp and 4p p o s s e s s i v e s u f f i x e s fall t o g e t h e r , and the 4p suffix falls o u t , in the speech of certain persons (see 5-3.24). The first and fourth

597

persons also fall t o g e t h e r in certain verbal inflectional suffixes in S i t a j a r a .
lp and 4p falling together as subject: 1+3 and 4+3 F for sa.na: /sa. ni. wa . nh (a) / (1+3)
lp and 4p falling together as complement: 3+1 and 3+4 I: /-itpan/ (3+1) 3+1 and 3+4 D-2: /-irijsta:na/ (3+4) 3+1 and 3+4 S for sa.na: /s.itu/ (3+1)
As may be seen above, in most cases the form with 4p falls out, leaving the form with lp to do duty for both.
In H u a n c a n d , lp and 4p have fallen t o g e t h e r as complement in 3+1 and 3+4 I / - i t p ( a ) / , the 3+1 form now being used for b o t h . The same seems to be happening in M o r o c o m a r c a with 3+1 and 3+4 D-2, as at first the 3+1 f o r m , / - i t a s p " a n a / , was given for both 3+1 and 3+4.

8-2.2

Human/Nonhuman

This d i s t i n c t i o n is m a n i f e s t e d in i n t e r r o g a t i v e s , d e m o n s t r a t i v e s , and personal p r o n o u n s ; in noun r e f e r e n c e , in certain noun s u f f i x e s , and in the subjects and c o m p l e m e n t s of verb r o o t s , s t e m s , and t h e m e s .

8-2.21 Interrogatives, demonstrati ves , personal pronouns

Of the five Aymara interrogative pronouns k"iti 'who' is h u m a n , and the r e s t , n o n h u m a n . qawq"a 'how m u c h / m a n y ' plus the suffix -ni possessor/enumerator refers to human

598

beings (8-2.24).1 Derived forms of kawki 'where' that are unmarked for human/nonhuman and gloss 'which' are kawki.ch"api and kawk.i:ri.
Demonstratives may be used to modify human nouns, e. g. uka chacha.x 'that man'. As a syntactic summarizer, a d e m o n s t r a t i v e may r e f e r to a human n o u n , as in

Ma: sinurit irpa.ni .tayn uka.mpi jaqi .cha.si .way.x.i.

one young lady bring 3->-3 that

marry

3->3

RIK

S

'He married the young lady that he had brought.' (Compi)

Some speakers would prefer to use the third person pronoun jupa instead of uka in the above s e n t e n c e . O t h e r w i s e , d e m o n stratives are generally used as pronouns only to refer to nonhuman nouns.

Uka.x misa.wa. Uka.x waka.pa.wa.

'That is a table.' 'That is his cow.'

When the reference is h u m a n , a personal pronoun is u s e d .

Jupa.x wawa.xa.w. 'He/she is my child.'

3p

child lp

Using a demonstrative instead of a personal pronoun in the above c o n t e x t is perceived as r u d e . When derision or insult is i n t e n d e d , a demonstrative may be u s e d .

599

Uka.xa.y yat.chi aliq . . .

that

know NI other

'That one may know, anyone (might) . . . "

(Sitajara)

Personal pronouns are used only for human beings or anthropomorphized animals, or very occasionally, for domest i c a t e d a n i m a l s , as in t h e c a s e of an o l d l a d y t a l k i n g to her only companion, a cat.

8-2.22 Noun reference

C e r t a i n nouns in La Paz A y m a r a (and p r e s u m a b l y elsewhere) are basically nonhuman; others, basically human. Examples of nouns or noun phrases that are always nonhuman in r e f e r e n c e a r e m u x s a ' s w e e t - t a s t i n g ' ; n a y r a . p q " i p a . p 'back and forth' (e. g. a dog running back and forth); and jach ' a 'big' and j i s k'a ' s m a l l ' e x c e p t when t h e y o c c u r in the noun phrases j a c h'a tansa 'tall' and j i s k'a tansa 'short'.
A noun which sometimes has human, and sometimes nonhuman r e f e r e n c e , is s u m a , which has a range of meanings including 'good, nice, tasty, delicious, very, nicely'. In C a l a c o a and J o p o q u e r i it m e a n s ' b e a u t i f u l , p r e t t y ' ; in Socca it is used in these m e a n i n g s as well as the o t h e r s . The following examples are all from La Paz:

600

Nonhuman reference: Wali suma.w.

It's very good/delicious.'

Suma chayru.wa. 'It's delicious soup.' soup

Aka.x suma ch'iyar laq'a.sa.:.

This

black earth

'This is good black earth.' (Hardman et al. 1975:1.266)

suma aru

'good language, proper speech'

sum kanka.na

'to fry well' (8-2.23)

Human reference: Suma Awki

'God' ('good father', an archaic expression)

suma aru.m

'well-spoken person'

suma jaqi

'good person, of good character, nice'

Suma jag mama.wa. 'She's a nice lady. ,2

suma kankana

'of good character, good-humored' (8-2.

T h e following examples occurred in the Peruvian dialects indicated.

suma un.naqa.s.iri 'good-looking, having a good appearance' (Huancane)

suma k'aj.k.iri

'very bright' (Socca)

601

suma.ki.y is.ch'uk.t'a.p.x.ita:ta

listen

2+1

F

'you will listen to me nicely' (Socca)

In La Paz the verbalized noun s u m a . c h a . n a 'to p a c i f y , to make a m e n d s , to decorate (e. g. a house)' takes a human subject. The noun suma verbalized with -pta- takes an animal subject, and probably also a human subject; see the example given for jaqi, below.
Use of suma alone (that is, not in one of the noun phrases given above) to modify a noun having human reference is usually perceived as obscene and/or d e r i s i v e in B o l i v i a , as in the popular song Suma Tawaqu 'Nice (?) G i r l ' (i. e. 'tasty d i s h ' ) . There is some evidence that such an expression is not necessarily obscene in other d i a l e c t s , suma kullaka 'good sister' being acceptable to a speaker from Socca; however, he may have been influenced by Missionary usages (se 9-6.12).
Certain nouns in Aymara always have human reference. One is jayra 'lazy person.' A n o t h e r , of much greater imp o r t a n c e in the l a n g u a g e , is the noun c h o s e n by H a r d m a n to designate Aymara and its sister languages: jaqi. This means 'human b e i n g , p e r s o n , people' in all the Jaqi l a n g u a g e s . In Aymara the noun jaqi used alone usually refers to the Aymara people s p e c i f i c a l l y . One speaker from La Paz rejected *Quechua jaqi. However, some speakers extend the term jaqi to other races or e t h n i c g r o u p s in such noun phrases as

602

janq'u jaqi 'white p e o p l e 1 , and the phrase suma jaqi 'of good character' may be applied to non-Aymara persons who are judged to merit the designation.
A n o t h e r meaning of jaqi is ' a d u l t , m a r r i e d p e r s o n ' , as is shown in the derived verb jaqi .cha .ha 'to m a r r y ' , 'to make or cause p e r s o n ( s ) ' . P e r s o n h o o d in Aymara s o c i e t y is fully attained only upon m a r r i a g e .
Probably through a process of semantic identification with the Spanish noun hombre, which means both 'man(kind)' and 'human m a l e ' , the noun jaqi is s o m e t i m e s used by bilinguals to mean 'male human b e i n g , m a n ' .

Naya jaqi.xa Qalaqala.t.wa. 'I'm a man from Calacala.' lp
(Yo soy hombre de Calac.ala.) (Calacala)

Ma: jaqi.w a

juta.tayna. come 3+3
RIK

(Habia venido un hombre.)

'A man (not known to me) came.'
(La Paz/Compi)

These examples show how the Spanish gender distinction (one of the Spanish linguistic postulates) may affect the Aymara of bilinguals. Nevertheless, the native Aymara meaning of jaqi also p e r s i s t s in the s p e e c h of b i l i n g u a l s and monolinguals a l i k e . In this m e a n i n g the noun jaqi is the epitome of humanness. Its semantic opposite, the nadir of nonhumann e s s , is anu 'dog'. If one does not behave like j a q i , one

603

is b e h a v i n g l i k e a d o g . T h e d i c h o t o m y is i l l u s t r a t e d in t h e following, a La Paz retort to an insult.

K"i ti.ta.sa who 2+3

S

I
'Who are you - a dog or a person? Talk like a person, not like a dog.' (La Paz/Compi)

The above is r u d e , using the unadorned Imperative. the following:

So is

Anu.r jaqu.ni.m. 'Throw it to a dog.' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco) dog throw 2+3
I

The above sentence is a retort to someone who is throwing stones or otherwise being deliberately annoying; it means 'Go do it to a dog instead of to me.'
The following is commonly said by wedding godparents to the couple for the stability of whose marriage they are respons i ble:

Jag un.ta.sa.w sar.naqa.:ta. 'Live (by) watching real people looking at go around 2+3 people.' (La Paz/Compi)
F (Yapita 1975:1-2)
('Behave the way you see real people behaving.')

604

When one partner in a marriage does not want to be reconciled with the other, someone may comment as follows:

Anu.s nuwa.si.sin suma.pt.i.sa. clog fighting make up 3+3
S

(La Paz/Compi (Yapita 1975:3)

'Even dogs make up after fighting. (Why not people?)'

The above is a strong r e b u k e . If the errant spouse still refuses to attempt a reconciliation, he or she will hear the ultimate condemnation.

'How stupid you are. You are a shame to the human race, an honor to dogs." (La Paz/Compi) (Yapita 1975:3)

Bertonio (1603b:94) cited a sentence using a verbalized form of +anuqara 'dog' meaning 'insult, make fun of'.

+Uma.ta.na drunk

In s p i t e of the j a q i / a n u d i s t i n c t i o n , t h e Aymara generally treat their dogs humanely, as they do all useful domestic animals; one might say they behave like jaqi toward them. One calls one's dog by name to go herd sheep.

'Come, Tumaykarisa! Let's you and me herd the sheep.' (Hardman et al. 1975:1.205)

The addressee is the d o g , T u m a y k a r i s a , and the fourth person inflection includes the dog as well as the human speaker. One may also say to a dog

Aka.x manq'a.ma.w. this food 2p

'Here's your food.'

H o w e v e r , o n e d o e s n o t u s e t h e s a m e f o r m s in s p e a k i n g to a dog as to a human being. The first of the above two sentences would be rude if addressed to a person; the second would be i n s u l t i n g . In the first case the u n a d o r n e d Imperative juta.m 'Come!' would be avoided by using politive independent and final suffixes and/or by substituting the Future for the Imperative.

And as indicated in the d i s c u s s i o n of uses of the fourth person (8-2.1), a polite way to tell someone that dinner is ready is to say

The jaq i/a n u distinction affects the semantics of other n o u n s . One of these is a w k i , an a r c h a i c term for 'father'. As noted a b o v e , it occurs in the noun phrase suma awki as a respectful term of address or reference for God. In other c o n t e x t s , awki has acquired canine connotations. For e x a m p l e , to use it in inquiring about the health of s o m e o n e ' s f a t h e r is r e j e c t e d as i m p l y i n g the f a t h e r is a dog. That is,

Awki.ma.sti? 2p and

'And (how is) your father?'

implies the rude expression

Anu awki.ma.sti? 'And (how is) your (SOB of a) father?' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco)

A n o t h e r c o n t e x t , in which awki refers to a real dog's f a t h e r , is a j i n g l e said w h i l e holding up a puppy's front legs to make it dance on its back legs.

8-2.23 The noun kankaha
The noun kankaha 'essence, nature, being, power' does not occur by itself, but only as the head of a noun phrase and only when modified by another noun referring to
3 the Deity or a human being. It is to be distinguished from the homophonous kanka.ha 'to fry'. Examples of kankaha are
Dips kankaha 'divine essence, Being of God' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco) jaqi kankaha 'human nature' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco; also
Bertonio 1612:2:120) jayra kankaha.pa 'their being lazy' jayra 'human lazi-
ness' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco) qullqi.n kankaha.pa.mpi.x 'their being wealthy'
(Puerto Acosta)^ qullqi.ni 'rich person' uta.n kankaha 'the power of being a landlord'
uta.ni 'house-owner' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco)

When modified by warmi 'woman' the meaning is somewhat disparaging.

3+3

S

'In spite of their being women they did it.' (La Paz/Compi)

Noun phrases in which kankaha is m o d i f i e d by nonhuman nouns are usually rejected.

*janq'u kankaha 'to be white'

This meaning is instead expressed by verbalizing the noun janq ' u 'whi te'.
janq'u.:.ha 'to be white'
If janq'u m o d i f i e s a human n o u n , such as jaqi , the noun phrase is acceptable to some speakers.
janq'u jag kankaha 'to be white people, White Power' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco)

609
As indicated previously, suma 'good' occurs with human reference when modifying kankana.
suma kankana.mpi 'with good humor' (La Paz/Compi)
This is to be distinguished from the phrase
sum kanka.na 'to fry well' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco)
In t h i s , suma is the zero c o m p l e m e n t of the n o m i n a l i z e d verb kanka- 'fry'. 8-2.24 Noun suffixes
The noun suffix -ni p o s s e s s o r / e n u m e r a t o r is unmarked for human/nonhuman when it occurs as possessor.
Uta.x punku.ni.w. 'The house has a door.' Jupa.x uta.ni.w. 'She's a house-owner.'

H o w e v e r , when it occurs as e n u m e r a t o r , -ni is always h u m a n . On the interrogative qawq"a 'how much/many': Qawq"a.ni.sa? 'How many people are there?'

610

On numbers 1 to 10 and multiples of 10:

Pusi.ni.wa.

'There are four people.'

Tunka pusi.ni.wa. 'There are forty people.'

On the nonhuman quantity nouns taqi 'all', wal.ja 'much, many', and j u k ' a 'few':

taqi.ni

'all (the) people'

wal.ja.ni 'many people'

juk'a.ni 'few people'

The personal possessive suffixes for lp, 2p, and 4p all refer to human possessors. The third person is unmarked for human/nonhuman .

uta.n punku.pa 3p
jupa.n uta.pa

'the door of the house' 'his house'

8-2.25 Subjects and complements of verb roots, stems, and themes
As indicated in 6 - 3 , verbs in A y m a r a are i n f l e c t e d for t e n s e , subject p e r s o n , and complement p e r s o n , in nine unitary suffixes for each tense. (Defective verbs created by verbalization with -ka- or -:- take only four inflectional s u f f i x e s , all with 3p c o m p l e m e n t s . ) In these tense/person suffixes (as in the case of personal possessive suffixes) 3p subjects and complements are unmarked for human/nonhuman, while lp, 2p, and 4p subjects and complements are human or a n t h r o p o m o r p h i z e d . A c o m p l e m e n t e x p r e s s e d in a t e n s e / p e r s o n s u f f i x may be f u r t h e r s p e c i f i e d in a s e n t e n c e by a noun marked by one of the Aymara complement/relational (case) suffixes (5-3.31). These nouns are referred to by these suffixes as - r u , -ta, - m p i , - n a , or -taki complements. Some verbs also select other nouns which are marked with case s u f f i x e s but do not r e f l e c t c o m p l e m e n t s e x p r e s s e d in the tense/person suffixes; these case-marked nouns are called r e l a t i o n a l s . In addition to selecting s u b j e c t s , c o m p l e m e n t s , and relationals, most verb roots and stems select zero complements (5-3.33).
Aymara verb roots and stems (roots plus derivational suffixes) belong to covert classes according to the semantic features of the subjects, complements, relationals, and zero complements they may take. The human/nonhuman distinction

612
is r e f l e c t e d in these s e m a n t i c f e a t u r e s , as is to be expected of such an i m p o r t a n t l i n g u i s t i c p o s t u l a t e in the language. Investigation of other semantic features of Aymara has only just begun. Among those tentatively identified so f a r , in addition to h u m a n / n o n h u m a n , are distinctions of animate/inanimate (or moving/nonmoving), animal/nonanimal, piant/nonplant, and humanly processed/unprocessed.
There is apparently no set hierarchy of f e a t u r e s ; rather, they cut across each other. Nonhuman may subsume animate and inanimate, but animate may subsume human, animal, and moving natural phenomena such as fire, sunlight, hail, and clouds. Inanimate may subsume plant, humanly processed agricultural products or manufactures, or nonprocessed nonmoving matter such as r o c k , earth, or places. Human may subsume a distinction of human persons vs. human body parts or secretions (e. g. blood, urine) and conditions affecting them (e. g. cold, sunlight). Illustrations of these distinctions are given below. They remain working categories pending further refinement as Aymara semantic studies proceed .
One instance in which the human/nonhuman distinction is overriding with respect to verb stems and themes concerns the behavior of the nominalizing suffix -ha (7-4.21.2). This suffix is u n m a r k e d for h u m a n / n o n h u m a n on verb r o o t s . All roots may take it, regardless of the semantics of their

613

subjects or complements. However, certain verb stems and verb themes that require a nonhuman subject reject nominalization with -ha because on them -ha implies a human subject. Examples of stems and themes that reject -ha are given below.
The selectional rules for the semantic features of verb subjects and complements are very complex, changing according to the verb root and the verbal derivational suffixes occurring in a verb stem. Although investigation of these rules was not formally undertaken for this study, examples are given to illustrate the interplay of semantic features and to suggest directions for future research.
Verbs which usually require a human subject include verbs of carrying or moving specific shapes and consistencies of objects (zero complements) by various means (Tate 1970) and the general carrying verb apa.ha 'to take, carry' (shape and consistency of object and manner of carrying not specif i e d ) . In its basic form this verb takes a human subject but not a human c o m p l e m e n t . It may take a human complement when a nonhuman noun with the complement/relational suffix -ta occurs as a relational (instrumental) in the s e n t e n c e .

*(Naya.x) (juma.r) apa.:ma. (Not possible)

lp

2p

1+2

(Naya.x) (juma.r) awtu.t apa.:ma.

lp

2p -ru car -ta 1+2

F

614
'I will take you by car.'
The verb apa.na plus the Class 1 verbal derivational suffix -rpaya- implies a human subject and complement: apa.rpaya.ha 'to leave someone'. H o w e v e r , when the Class 1 suffixes -su- and -ta- are added to the root apa-, the new stem takes the moving natural phenomenon qinaya 'cloud' as subject; it will not take a human subject nor the suffix -ha.
Qinaya.x ap.s.t.i.w. 'Clouds gathered.' (La Paz) 3+3 S
Another carrying verb, i rpa.ha 'to take a person', requires both a human subject and a human zero complement in La Paz.
(Naya.x) (jum) irpa.:ma. 'I will take you.' 1+2 F
In Salinas irpa.ha may also take a d o m e s t i c a t e d animal as zero c o m p l e m e n t . In La Paz the derived verb i r p . x a t a . h a , with the Class 1 verbal derivational suffix -xata-, still requires a human subject but may take a human or nonhuman zero complement. Examples:

615

um irp.xata.na 'to direct water through a canal (if it

water

is going the wrong way)' (La Paz/Compi)

jum awtu.ru.w ap car

irp.xata.na

'to put you in a car (if you're sick and can't move) and take you somewhere' (La Paz/Compi)

(An animal may be s u b s t i t u t e d for the person in the last example.)
In classifying noun features it is necessary to recognize metaphoric usages whereby an apparently nonhuman noun is used where a human noun would be e x p e c t e d . The derived verb irpa.ra.na 'to take a w a y , remove p h y s i c a l l y , as punishment', with the Class 1 verbal derivational suffix -ra-, may take a human subject and a human or animal zero complement. For example, a customs agent (human subject) may take away someone's dog (animal zero complement). Metaphorically human, the law may take children (human zero complement) from one parent and give them to the other p a r e n t . (These examples are all from La P a z / T i a h u a n a c o . )
T h e verbs a c h u . na (La P a z ) and p u q u . na (La Paz and elsewhere) take a plant subject and no zero complement.

Ch'uqi.w

ach.u. I 'Potatoes grow/are produced.'
puq.u. \ (La Paz) (Calacala) 3+3 S

616

When the Class 2 verbal derivational suffix -ya- is added to achu- or puqu-, the verb takes a human subject, the original plant subject then turning into a zero complement.

Ch'uq achu.y.t.wa. 1+3 S

'I grow potatoes.' (La Paz)

There is a h o m o p h o n o u s verb a c h u . h a 'to carry in the mouth' that requires an animal subject. The derived stem ach.ja.tata- 'to bite', with the Class 1 derivational suffixes -j a- and - t a t a - , also requires an animal subject and therefore does not take the nominalizer -ha. It can take a human -ru complement.

Anu.w (naya.r) ach.ja.tat.itu. 'The dog bit me.'

dog

lp

3+1 (La Paz)

S

The base verb manq'a.ha 'to e a t ' permits a human or animal subject and an edible zero c o m p l e m e n t , but no human -ru complement. The derived verb stem manq'a.tata- with the Class 1 verbal derivational suffix - t a t a - , permits only an animal subject and does not take -ha, but like ach.ja.tatait also can take a human -ru complement.

617

ch'uq manq'a.ria 'to eat potatoes' (La Paz)

Anu.w (naya.r) manq'a.tat.itu. 'The doa bit me.'

3+1 (La Paz)

S

Two other verbs glossing 'to b i t e ' , both also with -tata- in the s t e m , may be substituted for ach.j a.tata- or manq'a.tata-.

Anu.w naxna.tat.itu. 'The dog bit me.' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco)

Anu.w t"at"a.tat.itu. 3+1 S

'The dog bit me.' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco)

The verb t"at"a.tata.na may take a human subject when used m e t a p h o r i c a l l y , meaning 'to snap at s o m e o n e , to bite someone's head off1.
Certain verb themes built on nouns verbalized with -pta- require a nonhuman subject and do not take the nominalizer -na. Examples are ch'iyara.pta- 'turn black', muxsa.pta- 'turn sweet', and uma.pta- 'melt, turn to liquid'. When the Class 2 verbal derivational suffix -ya- is a d d e d , the new stems permit human and nonhuman subjects and zero complements, and will take the nominalizer -na.

The natural phenomena nouns 1 upi 'sunlight' or inti 'sun' may be s u b s t i t u t e d for ni na in the f o r e g o i n g s e n t e n c e .
The verb jiwa.ha 'to die' may take an animal or human subject without the addition of any Class 1 suffixes to the root, but not a plant subject; and it has no complements. The following examples from La Paz/Compi have the Class 2 suffixes -si- and -ka- with the Non-Involver -chi and the final suffixes -chi- plus -m:

Iwisa.x jiwa.s.k.chi.chi.m. 'Maybe the sheep died.'

sheep cITe

ITT"

Jupa.x jiwa.s.k.chi.chi.m. 'Maybe he/she died.' 3p

*Ch'uqi.x jiwa.s.k.chi.chi.m. 'Maybe the potatoes died.' potato

A n o t h e r noun a c c e p t e d as s u b j e c t in the a b o v e p a t t e r n is nina 'fire'.

619

Nina.x jiwa.s.k.chi.chi.m. 'Maybe the fire died out.'

Nina.chi.m jiwa.s.k.chi.

'Maybe the fire died down.'

Nina.chi.m jiwa.ra.s.k.chi. 'Look out, the fire may die out.'

(The last example has the Class 1 suffix -ra- in the stem.) The addition of the Class 2 suffix -ya- to the root
jiwa- does not change the semantics of its subjects but allows it also to take (formerly) living zero complements.

Juyp"i.x iwis jiwa.ya.tayna.w. 'Hail killed the sheep.'

hail

sheep

3+3

RIK

Qamaqi.x iwis jiwa.ya.tayna.w. 'The fox killed the sheep.'

'He/she killed the sheep.'

In La P a z / C o m p i , if the Class 1 suffix -su- is added to the root jiwa- the new stem may take a plant subject but not a human or animal subject.

Ch'uqi.x jiw.su.s.k.chi.chi.xa. 'Maybe the potatoes

potato

NI

died.'

Ch'uqi.x jiw.s.u.x. 3+3 S

'The potatoes died.'

620

Jawasa.x jiw.s.u.x. beans
Ayru.x jiw.s.u.w. plant

'The beans died.' 'The plants died.'

Addition of the Class 2 suffix -ya- to the stem jiw.su- permits an animate subject, and turns a former plant subject to a zero c o m p l e m e n t . In the f o l l o w i n g e x a m p l e , also from La P a z / C o m p i , the new subject is juyp"i 'hail':

Ju.yp"i .chi .x panqar jiw.su.ya.s.k.chi.

hail

flower

NI

'Perhaps the hail killed the flowers."

When a verb already has a human subject and a nonhuman zero c o m p l e m e n t , the addition of -ya- to the root creates an agent (usually human) expressed in the verb inflection c o m p l e m e n t . If the a g e n t is a l s o e x p r e s s e d by a noun in the sentence, it will be marked by either -ru or -mpi complement/ relational suffix (see 5-3.31).

urn wayu.ha

'to carry water (in container with handles)'

wayu.ya.m. 2+3 I

Mama.ma.mpi.y wayu.ya.m. 'Have your mother carry the water.'

621

(In these contexts, as noted by Hardman, -mpi occurs when it is desired to show respect for the person who is to be the agent.)
The Class 2 suffix combination -si- plus -ka(-s.ka-) implies a human or anthropomorphized subject when it occurs on interrogatives and demonstratives that have been verbalized with -ka-.

Kawki.n.ka.s.k.i.sa? 3+3 S

'Where is he/she?'

Aka.n.ka.s.ka.:n.wa.y. 'He was here.' (referring to the

dog Tumaykarisa; Hardman et al.

RDK

Without -s.ka-, the interrogative or demonstrative plus -n.kaimplies an inanimate, nonmoving s u b j e c t .

Kawki. n.k.i.sa?
Kawk"a.n.k.i.sa?
Aka.n.k.i.wa. 3+3 S

'Where is it?' 'It's here.' (La Paz)

In asking the location of a d o m e s t i c a n i m a l , or even a pers o n , it is common to use an inflected v e r b , instead of kawki plus verbalization, e. g.

622

'Where is the donkey feeding?'

K"a: pampa.n manq'a.s.k.i that
'He's feeding over on that pampa [flat place].' (La Paz/Compi)

The suffix combination -s.ka- on a verb or verb theme nominalized with -:- instead of -ka-, does not imply a human subject.

Aka.:.s.ska.tayna.w. 3+3 RIK

'Here it is.' (La Paz/Compi)

The Class 2 suffix -rapi- b e n e f i c i a r y occurs in stems which take human subjects and human -taki complements, and may also take a human -ru relational. There is also usually a zero complement.

The Class 2 suffix -raqa- victimary occurs in stems which take human subjects and human -na complements;

623

relationals may also o c c u r , and the zero complement is a possession of the -na complement.

Some derived verbs based on nouns verbalized with the Class 1 suffix -j a- have unrealized subjects but take human -ru complements and ingestible -ta relationals. The verbs may take the nominalizer -ha only when they are stated with their -ta relationals; -ru complement nouns are usually not expressed. Examples:

manq'a.t ~ mag'a.t awt.ja.na (*awt.ja.na) awti 'drought'

Manq'a.t (naya.r) awt.j.itu. 'I'm hungry.'

uma.t wan.ja.na (*wan.ja.na) wanu 'dry'
Uma.t wan.j.itu. 11'm thirsty.' (Calacoa, Sitajara, Bertonio 1603b)

Another verb that takes a human -ru complement and may have an unrealized subject is jat.ja.na 'to weigh u p o n , to sadden ' .

Jat.j.itu. 1+3 S

It saddens me/weighs me down/weighs on me. It's heavy.' (La Paz/Compi)

Certain verbs with subjects that are human body parts or conditions affecting them, answer the questi on

Kuna.s kama.ch.tam? "What ails you?'

3-£

S

The examples, all of which are believed to take -na nomin a l i z e r , are from Hardman et al . (1975:1.181 - 1 8 4 , 2.1 19) unless otherwise noted.

'My head aches."

There are also verbs that may take both human persons and human body parts, or conditions affecting them, as subjects. With person subjects they may take inanimate zero or -ru complements but they usually do not take human complements; with body parts or conditions as subjects they may take human c o m p l e m e n t s , in w h i c h case they a n s w e r the 'What ails you?' question.

Most of the above examples are from La Paz. Evidence of dialectal variation in the semantic features of verb subjects and complements is still scanty, but a few e x a m p l e s m a y be g i v e n . In La P a z , J u l i , C a l a c o a , and Morocomarca the verb wawa.cha.ha means 'for animals to bear o f f s p r i n g ' . In J o p o q u e r i , S i t a j a r a , and S a l i n a s the verb is also used for human b e i n g s , with the general meaning 'to bear offspring'. Everywhere, however, derivatives of the verb usu.ha 'to be ill' (such as usu.ri.:.ta.:.ha , usu.r.ta.si.ha, and us . xa.ha) are commonly used for 'to be p r e g n a n t , to bear a child' (human subject).
In Juli i k.nuq.t.xa.s i.na means 'for a human being to be b o r n ' . The c o r r e s p o n d i n g verb in Jopoqueri is jiki.nuqu.si.ha. Metaphorically they may mean 'to be founded' taking as subject an organization, for example. In La Paz the usual verb meaning 'for a human being to be born' is n a s i . h a , from Spanish n a c e r . The corresponding n a t i v e A y m a r a v e r b y u r i . n a ~ y a w r i . n a still p e r s i s t s in Juli

631

and parts of La Paz d e p a r t m e n t but y u r i . n a is c o n s i d e r e d to be Missionary or Radio Aymara by some speakers (see 9-6.2).

8-2.3

Directly/Indirectly acquired knowledge (data source)

This postulate is expressed by verbal inflectional

suffixes (6-3), the reporting verb sa.na (6-4 and 7-4.4) and

certain final suffixes ( 7 - 2 . 2 2 ) . Its cultural i m p o r t a n c e is

conveyed in a saying found in almost all Aymara c o m m u n i t i e s

(see 7-4.22.1 and Appendix D), which may be translated as

'Having s e e n , one m u s t say "I have seen."

Not having s e e n , one m u s t not say "I have s e e n . " '

Closely bound up with this p o s t u l a t e is the cultural impor-

tance of learning by watching the behavior of respected

p e o p l e , as reflected in the e x p r e s s i o n s noted in 8-2.2 with

reference to the human/nonhuman distinction.

Jag un.ta.sa.w sar.naqa.:ta. people watching go around 2+3
F

'Live (by) watching real people.'

Kuna.r un.ta.t anything watching

sar.naq.ta.xa. go around
2+3 S

'You go around looking at anything.' (How stupid you are.) (La Paz/Compi)

In Aymara s o c i e t y , children are expected to learn by observation and in a very short t i m e ; they are expected to discriminate, both qualitatively and in terms of who did and

632
said what and to w h o m . This expectation is reflected in the 1anguage.
The Simple, Remote Direct Knowledge, and Remonstrator tenses are used when (usually visual) direct experience on which to base a s t a t e m e n t (or q u e s t i o n ) is available to the speaker, hearer, or both. The Future, Imperative, and Desiderative tenses are used for projections vouched for or desired on the basis of directly acquired personal knowledge. The Remote Indirect Knowledge tense indicates nonpresence of the speaker at the event(s) discussed and secondhand acquisition of the information, possibly accompanied by surprise or change of a former opinion. Compound tenses with the Inferential express conjecture based on evidence from personal experience, while compound tenses with the Non-Involver imply inability to vouch for information because of factors beyond one's control.
The r e p o r t i v e verb sa.na places the speaker in the role of reproducing what someone else said. Varying degrees of directness or indirectness of acquisition of the information may be expressed by the verb sa.ha as well as within the quoted statements themselves.
The final suffixes -wa absolute and -pi reiterator of known information are the strongest of the direct knowledge markers. They often occur softened with the politive -ya, but this does not detract from their absoluteness.

633

The interrogatives -sa and -ti elicit answers with -wa or -pi even if no information is a v a i l a b l e .

Jani.w .yat.k.t.ti. no — know 1+3
S

'I don't know.' (general)

On the other h a n d , the final suffix -xa or its v a r i a n t is nonabsolute, often tentative. The limited final suffix - c h i - a n d t h e d i s c l a i m e r j^m a r e t h e s t r o n g e s t i n d i r e c t knowledge m a r k e r s , the f o r m e r very s i m i l a r in both phonological shape and s e m a n t i c s to the Non-involver suffix - c h i . In fact, the final suffix combinations -chi.xa and -chi.m have occurred only with -chi Non-involver on the verb, although the l a t t e r o f t e n o c c u r r e d w i t h o u t - c h i . x a or - c h i . m in the sentence.
Combining direct knowledge tenses with direct knowledge final suffixes reinforces the directness. The final suffixes -wa and -pi do not co-occur with the Non-involver, the most indirect of the tense markers.
At this stage of research no regional variation in this p o s t u l a t e has been n o t e d , but there is v a r i a t i o n with respect to Missionary Aymara (see 9-6.13).

8-2.4 A nonpostulate: Singular/Plural
In A y m a r a the d i s t i n c t i o n of s i n g u l a r / p l u r a l is n o t a postulate as it is for the Indo-European languages. Plural may be optionally indicated by the noun suffix -naka and/or the verbal d e r i v a t i o n a l suffix - p - , as noted in 5-2.3, 5-3.25, and 6-2.26. The present section focuses on examples that show the o p t i o n a l i t y of number m a r k i n g in Aymara.

It is common for -p- to occur on the verb when a subject and/or complement is unexpressed by a noun in the s e n t e n c e , b u t a p p e a r s in p l u r a l f o r m in t r a n s l a t i o n . T h e suffix -p- may refer to the p e r s o n s i n v o l v e d in the a c t i o n , the extent or intensity of the action itself, or both.

'I haven't gotten any better I've had a lot of trouble.' (Sitajara)

In the i m m e d i a t e l y preceding example -p- acts more as an emphatic or intensifier than a p l u r a l . This is also true in the following sentences:

Puri.t.ma.taki p"uya.p.t.wa.

Semantic Variation in Roots and Suffixes

A p a r t f r o m v a r i a t i o n in the m a n i f e s t a t i o n s of linguistic p o s t u l a t e s (although not in the p o s t u l a t e s thems e l v e s ) , t h e r e is some v a r i a t i o n in the m e a n i n g s of r o o t s , suffixes, and stems across dialects. The same root, stem, or suffix may have one meaning in t r a n s l a t i o n in one d i a l e c t , another in another; or the same meaning in translation may be expressed by different lexical items or suffixes from one dialect to another. As already noted, relying on translations to e s t a b l i s h 'same' or ' d i f f e r e n t ' m e a n i n g s is u n s a f e ; identity or difference of meanings must ultimately be decided by native speakers working within the language.

Noun system Closed classes of noun roots

The verbalized interrogative Kawki.n.k.i ri.ta.sa? has slightly d i f f e r e n t m e a n i n g s in d i f f e r e n t dialects (see 52.12). The syntactic linkers kuna.1ayku.ti.xa (built on the interrogative kuna) and uka.mpisa (built on the demonstrative uka) are discussed in 9-5.
The p o s i t i o n a l s chi ka and ch'i na have s l i g h t l y varying m e a n i n g s , as do some of the temporals (see 5 - 2 . 5 , 5-2.6, and 5-4).

S o m e kinship terms vary in m e a n i n g a c r o s s d i a l e c t s . Only a few will be mentioned here. The term sul1ka means 'younger d a u g h t e r ' or 'younger' in m o s t d i a l e c t s . H o w e v e r , in Vitocota these meanings are rendered by p ' u r u . The noun achachi means ' g r a n d f a t h e r ' or 'old m a n ' in Calacala and C a l a c o a , but in La Paz it signifies 'dirty (unwashed) old man, stupid old man'. The terms tatala (M) and mamala (F) are used in Vitocota by a m o t h e r addressing a son or d a u g h t e r . In S i t a j a r a they are used to r e f e r to people from the a l t i plano (the department of Puno), otherwise known as the suni p e o p l e . In T i a h u a n a c o tatala is an i n s u l t i n g term for 'father'.

Verb system Verb roots and stems

Some v a r i a t i o n in the s e m a n t i c s of v e r b s u b j e c t s and complements due to different occurrences of verbal derivational suffixes on a root has been discussed under 8-2.25.
The following examples from Morocomarca illustrate the meaning changes that may occur within one dialect when different verbal derivational suffixes (in this case the Class 2 suffixes -wiya- and -xa-) are substituted on a verb root (in this case chura- 'give').

Chura.:.wa. 1+3 F

'I am going to set a quota.' (Voy a_ poner una cuota.)

Chura.wiya.:.wa. 1+3 F

'I will give to/reach out to him/her.' (Le voy a^ alcanzar.)

Chur.xa.:.wa. 1+3 F

'I will give it to him/her.'

Across dialects there exist sets or families of

verbs built on the same or related r o o t s . One such set is

built on the noun/verb root aru 'word, language, speech,

s p e a k ' or the derived frozen verb stem a r u s i - . In many

dialects today aru.ha exists only as a noun, 'cock's crow'

655

(In H u a n c a n g , h o w e v e r , wallpa ar.ta is 'cock's crow'.) The

Spanish loan verb pari a.na 'to speak' has been adopted al-

most everywhere. Verbs built on aru or arusi- have a variety

of derived meanings.

The following roots and stems, which are phono-

logically and s e m a n t i c a l l y similar to each other, may con-

stitute another related set.

muna-

'love, want' (Bertonio 1612:2.227)

As indicated in 6-2 (and in examples in other chap-

ters) a stem consisting of the same root alone or of the

same root plus derivational suffix(es) may gloss differently

657
from one dialect to another, although meanings are usually fairly close (see 8-3.21.1). On the other hand, across dialects the same Spanish example was translated sometimes by a stem with different derivational suffixes, and sometimes by a different root altogether (see 8 - 3 . 2 1 . 2 ) . In the case of verbs for agricultural practices or activities related to the preparation and preservation of agricultural products, similarity or identity of Spanish gloss may obscure real d i f f e r e n c e s in meaning which m a y be uncovered in f u t u r e r e s e a r c h . A p a r t from t h i s , Aymara is rich in verbs for processing agricultural products which are very cumbersome to translate because the processes do not exist outside Aymara culture. The following are examples of two such verbs from La P a z / T i a h u a n a c o : jamu.rpaya.ha ~ mamu.rpaya.ha
'To select from a pile of ground-up freeze-dried potatoes large pieces that have failed to be ground into small enough pieces (to be ground again); to select by rinsing (enjuagar).' q a w i .ria
'To put oca (api11 a) in the sun for three d a y s , taking it in at night (if not, it will f r e e z e ) , then to cook it in the m o r n i n g , then to put it on the roof to freeze; the r e s u l t is "Aymara ice c r e a m . " '

8-3.21.2 One meaning in t r a n s l a t i o n , different forms in Aymara
8-3.21.21 One Aymara root, different suffixes

Only a few examples will be cited, as use of different suffixes may depend more on stylistic than on semantic c r i t e r i a in m a n y c a s e s . In m o s t d i a l e c t s Spanish a p r e n d e r 'to l e a r n ' was translated as y a t i . q a . h a , built on y a t i . n a 'to k n o w ' . In Calacoa y a t i . q a . h a means 'to learn from a n o t h e r ' , while yati.nta.ha means 'to learn by o n e s e l f ' . Whether this distinction is also made elsewhere but was s i m p l y not m e n t i o n e d is not known at this t i m e . In S a l i n a s and M o r o c o m a r c a a p r e n d e r was rendered in Aymara as y a t i . n a . Another example occurred with Aymara translations of the S p a n i s h e s c u c h a r 'to l i s t e n ' . In m o s t p l a c e s t h i s is rendered as is.t'a.ha, the base verb isa.ha occurring infrequently if at a l l . In M o r o c o m a r c a 'to l i s t e n ' is i s a p a . h a , which corresponds to modern Jaqaru and to the Aymara of Bertonio (1603b:77); the /pa/ is apparently a frozen suffix in A y m a r a .

661

Two other examples in context may be given: 1 Go throw i t to a dog.1
Anuqara.r jaqu.ni.m. (Vitocota; non-ironic)

Anu.r jaq.xaru.ya.ni.m. (La Paz/Tiahuanaco; non-ironic)

Anu.r jaqu.ni.m. (La Paz/Tiahuanaco; ironic, e. g.

dog

2->3 'Do it to a dog! (not to me)'

I

The expression which in Vitocota is a simple request to throw a dog a b o n e , to a Tiahuanaco speaker sounds like an ironic retort (see 8-2.22). To convey a straightforward request to throw food to a dog, a Tiahuanaco speaker adds the derivational suffixes shown, among them the causative -ya- which sets the 2p subject at a greater distance from the dog complement.
A n o t h e r e x a m p l e o c c u r r e d in a f o l k s o n g in w h i c h a dove is warned to hide from a hawk. As rendered by a speaker from Jopoqueri, it contained the inflected verb im.t'a.s.xa.m 'hide y o u r s e l f ' . A speaker from La Paz/Compi p r e f e r r e d i m a . n t a . s . x a . m in the same c o n t e x t . To the Jopoqueri speaker the first version was more like an order and more forceful and hence to be preferred.

8-3.22 Verbal inflectional suffixes

Falling together of certain verbal inflectional suffixes involving the fourth person was noted in 8 - 2 . 1 .
Structural homophony in verbal inflections (one form with several m e a n i n g s ) is r a t h e r limited in A y m a r a . The following examples may be noted:

667

/-csna/

1+2 S (Huancani) 4+3 S (Morocomarca) 4+3 D-l (everywhere except Calacoa)

/-cma/

1+2 S (Salinas) 2+3 I (Juli, Socca, Huancane, Calacala)

/-vtan(a)/, /-:tan/, /-:tna/ 4+3 F (Calacoa, Salinas, Morocomarca, Calacala) 4+3 RDK (elsewhere)

On the other h a n d , in c e r t a i n tenses there is considerable variety in phonological shapes that express the same t e n s e / p e r s o n m e a n i n g . N u m e r o u s e x a m p l e s were given in 6-3.

Metaphor

Investigation of metaphor in Aymara was not really attempted for this study. The following comments and examples involve nouns mainly, since metaphorical use of verbs r e g u i r e s m a n i p u l a t i o n of verbal d e r i v a t i o n a l suffixes in w a y s usually beyond the nonnative's grasp (either receptively or productively).

668
Hardman et al. (1975:3.34) pointed out that positionals are often used as metaphors for time. I have chosen to consider q"ipa 'after, behind' as both a positional and a temporal. Other examples of this overlap are layra ~ nayra ' e y e , b e f o r e , in f r o n t o f ' , p a c h a ' s p a c e , t i m e ' , and chi ka 'halfway, middle' (see 5-2.5 and 5-2.6).
M e t a p h o r in Aymara involves moving lexical items from one semantic category into another, e. g. from human to nonhuman. The following humanizes an inanimate object, a chair, here the unspoken subject of the verb jaws.a.ha 'to c a l l ' .
Ak.sa.r mama, wali jaw.s.tam, ut.t'a.si.hani. 'This way, ma'am, (the chair) calls y o u , let's sit down.' i. e. 'Make yourself comfortable, let's sit down.' (Vitocota)
(This same expression may be used in La P a z / T i a h u a n a c o , substituting gun.ta.si.hani for ut.t'a.si.hani.)
Metaphors involving the use of human or animal terms for inanimate objects or plants are common, e. g. the use of ch'ina 'ass, human posterior' to mean 'base, bottom' (of a cup or pot) in C o m p i . The following are names of varieties of potatoes identified by Vasquez (La Paz/Tiahuanaco):

669

aja.w.iri imilla ch'iyar imilla janq'u imilla k"uchi qallu p"inu chara q1i11u k1awna runtu sani imilla waka laxra yuqall ch'uqi

'ajawiri girl' 'black girl' 'white girl' 'piglet' 'p"inu leg' 'yellow egg' 'egg' (Quechua) 'sani girl' 'cow tongue' 'boy potato'

Two more potatoes have names of 1) another vegetable, and 2) an inanimate object:

q'i11u sapallu wislla p'aki

'yellow squash'
'bent serving spoon' (cucharon dob!ado)

In f a c t , the only potato name cited that is not m e t a p h o r i c , apart from the generic term c h ' u q i , is q u y u .
O n e of the c o m m o n e s t m e t a p h o r s in A y m a r a is c h u y m a . It is usually translated 'heart' (coraz6n), but most speakers will explain that the anatomical organ it represents is actually the lung (bofe) or diaphragm. The anatomical term for heart is 11uqu. As a m e t a p h o r , chuyma always occurs with human reference. A common phrase is taqi chuyma.t 'wholeheartedly, sincerely' (de todo coraz6n). The noun chuyma

670
also occurs in the f o l l o w i n g e x p r e s s i o n from La Paz/ Tiahuanaco:

Juma.x 2p

jar.j.izs?tra~.
S

'You untied my heartstrings.' (Me desataste el coraz6n.)

This means 'You made me forget my troubles.' Another exp r e s s i o n , from La P a z / C o m p i , is chuym u t . t ' a . s i . h a , 'to seat the h e a r t ' , which means 'to resign o n e s e l f , to accept circums t a n c e s o n e c a n ' t c h a n g e ' , as in the f o l l o w i n g s e n t e n c e :

Kama.cha.raki.:ta.x - niya uka.:.chi - chuym

what do

2+3 already that NI

F

ut.t'a.ya.s.xa.k.chi.:ta.x.

seat

NI 2+3

F

'What (else) can you do - it's already happened (and it was beyond your control) - resign yourself to it.' (La Paz/Compi)

The derived noun chuyma.ni, with the possessor suffix - n i , m e a n s ' w i s e , m a t u r e p e r s o n ' in La P a z , and as such is usually reserved for older p e o p l e . In Socca chuyma.ni may refer to younger persons as well, conveying the ideas of emotional maturity and good character expressed in La Paz by suma jaqi.

671

The following is from T s c h o p i k (1948:113):

+ a k a i pi chuyma.ni jaqi.naka.xa

this

people

'these ignorant people'

Tschopik's translation is 'these demented p e o p l e ' , but since ipi glosses as 'stupid' (sonso) in Sitajara t o d a y , the above gloss seems preferable.
A few other noun metaphors involving the use of a nonhuman or nonliving noun used to refer to a human or animal are given below in alphabetical order.

ch'uxha

'green'

Metaphorical: 'rebel' (human) (La Paz/Tiahuanaco)

panq"alli 'flower'

Metaphorical: the llama, 'flower of the altiplano'. According to legend the gods threw flowers on the pampa and they turned into llamas. (Jopoqueri)

t"ant"a

'rags'

Metaphorical: 'poor, good-fornothing person' t"ant"a masi.ja 'poor fellow like me' (Huaricane)

A metaphorical use of the noun/verb root t'ullku is 'in a h u r r y ' . The verb t ' u l l k u . n a m e a n s 'to t w i s t ' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco).

672

Summary and Conclusion

Regional semantic variation in Aymara is r e l a t i v e l y slight. As might be expected, nearby dialects tend to share

673
lexical items and meanings, some of which do not occur elsewhere, but there are instances of widely separated dialects having lexical items with similar or identical meanings and usages. No one dialect shows a significant number of lexical items different from those of other dialects.
Some variation in meaning relates to c o n n o t a t i o n . Forms which are innocuous in one dialect may be negatively loaded in a n o t h e r . I m p r e s s i o n i s t i c a l l y it seems that La Paz dialects may have a greater propensity for irony than dialects of some other places, but this impression may be the result of greater familiarity with and easier access to data from the La Paz area than to t h a t from other a r e a s .
The study of Aymara semantics beckons for the future. Among the many possibilities for investigation is research into terms used in a g r i c u l t u r e and related practices in different parts of the Aymara world to determine exactly w h a t is m e a n t by t h e m . It is also to be hoped that with the growing attention being given by Aymara linguists to semantic studies (for example the work of Juan de Dios Yapita), the semantic distinctions governing selectional rules for verb subjects and complements will be clarified and appropriate labels assigned them in Aymara.

CHAPTER 9 MISSIONARY, PATRON, AND RADIO AYMARA

9-1

Introduction

Missionary, Patrdn, and Radio Aymara are translation dialects not specific to any one region. That is, they are the result of translation from Spanish (or English) into Aymara, sharing a tendency to impose Spanish (or English) categories and patterns, both grammatical and cultural, upon Aymara. Missionary and Patrdn Aymara have t h e i r roots in the 16th c e n t u r y ; Radio A y m a r a is a later d e v e l o p m e n t . As i n d i c a t e d in 2 - 4 . 1 2 , until very r e c e n t l y all m a t e r i a l s published in Aymara were of the M i s s i o n a r y or Patron varieties.
Missionary Aymara, identifiable by its idiosyncratic use of certain syntactic linkers and lexical items, by weakening of the human/nonhuman and data source postul a t e s , a n d by a r i g o r o u s m a r k i n g of p l u r a l , o c c u r s in sermons, translations of religious texts, and several published grammars of the l a n g u a g e , as well as in the e v e r y d a y s p e e c h and s t o r y t e l l i n g of p e r s o n s a c t i v e in institutionalized religion.^
Patron and Radio Aymara overlap Missionary to some e x t e n t . Patron A y m a r a , which occurs both in writing and

675

676
in s p e e c h , is h e a v i l y S p a n i s h - i n f l u e n c e d in syntax and has an impoverished lexicon of s u f f i x e s . Radio Aymara is used by radio announcers translating orally directly from Spanish s c r i p t s . It is c h a r a c t e r i z e d by Spanish s y n t a c t i c patterning and by a superabundance of Spanish loans, with the Aymara sometimes reduced to final suffixes. A number of announcers are now consciously trying to make their translations less literal, however, seeking to interpret the sense rather than gloss word for word.
As noted in 3 - 3 . 3 , the entry of Spanish loanwords into A y m a r a , which occurs in all Aymara d i a l e c t s , is nothing new. Some early Spanish loans (certain roots and stems, diminutive suffixes, and expressions of thanks) have been completely adapted to Aymara phonology (Aymarized) and are perceived by monolinguals and bilinguals alike as natively Aymara; others are more or less adapted to Aymara phonology according to the degree of the speaker's control of Spanish and attitude toward Aymara. A rather large n u m b e r of l o a n s m a y o c c u r e v e n in t h e s p e e c h of m o n o linguals if they wish to show familiarity with the p r e s t i g e l a n g u a g e , S p a n i s h ; in that c a s e loans m a y a l t e r n a t e with n a t i v e A y m a r a d o u b l e t s , as o c c u r r e d in t h e speech of an e l d e r l y m o n o l i n g u a l woman in T a r a t a , P e r u . (A d e f i n i t i o n of A y m a r a m o n o l i n g u a l m a y here be a t t e m p t e d : a person who produces grammatical sentences only in Aymara, although possibly using a rather extensive Spanish

677
lexical c o m p o n e n t . ) It was also observed in the course of this research that bilingual Aymara men talking to each o t h e r in Aymara in La Paz used Spanish s y n t a c t i c linkers (like entonces 'then') with great frequency but did so only rarely when t a l k i n g with m o n o l i n g u a l s in rural c o m m u n i t i e s . The w h o l e m a t t e r of S p a n i s h l o a n s in A y m a r a deserves more study, taking into account situational factors like the presence or absence of listeners who have a greater command of Spanish (or English) than of Aymara. The point I wish to make here is that a large number of Spanish loans in a d i a l e c t does not in and of itself necessarily imply a corresponding weakening of Aymara grammatical processes or linguistic postulates or an impoverishment of the native Aymara lexicon.
N e v e r t h e l e s s , it is true that M i s s i o n a r y , P a t r d n , and Radio Aymara are generally characterized by a high proportion of Spanish loanwords in Spanish p h o n o l o g y , tending toward inclusion of whole Spanish phrases or even sentences, or full-fledged code-switching. The tendency to keep or try to approximate the Spanish phonology of loanwords (when these are recognized as such) evidently r e f l e c t s , in some p e r s o n s , the view that S p a n i s h is inherently superior to Aymara--a view fostered consciously or unconsciously by most writers of Missionary and Patrdn grammars (see 2-3 and 2-4.11) and accepted by adherents of c e r t a i n r e l i g i o u s sects (see 1 0 - 2 . 7 ) . In c o n t r a s t ,

678
b i l i n g u a l s l i t e r a t e in Aymara and S p a n i s h , who c o n s c i o u s l y promote the development of Aymara literature, deliberately A y m a r i z e S p a n i s h l o a n s , both in s p e e c h and in w r i t i n g , as for example Istarusunirusa (from Estados Unidos 'United
o States') and winus tiyas (from buenos dfas 'good morning').
In the f o l l o w i n g s e c t i o n s the t h r e e d i a l e c t s will be discussed with respect to phonology, morphophonemics, m o r p h o l o g y , morphosyntax and s y n t a x , and s e m a n t i c s . It should be kept in mind in reading this chapter that it is primarily an analysis of Missionary, Patrdn, and Radio A y m a r a as s p o k e n in the c i t y of La Paz and (for M i s s i o n a r y Aymara o n l y ) in C o m p i , d e p a r t m e n t of La Paz; and of published sources of Missionary and Patron Aymara (see 2-4.11), most of which probably also reflect La Paz usages. For Radio Aymara, only recorded (spoken) texts were used; for Missionary, both recorded and published written texts; and for Patron, published written texts only. The analysis is based on interpretations and revisions of the texts and on additional examples provided by Vasquez (La Paz/ Tiahuanaco) and Yapita (La Paz/Compi). Vasquez furnished most of the initial interpretations and revisions of published texts (for example, Ebbing 1965, Paredes Candfa 1963, Wexler 1967, and the Aymara catalogues). Yapita reviewed some of these as well as the recorded texts. The chapter is thus a contrastive study of the three translation dialects and the two La Paz d i a l e c t s , from the

679

point of view of the latter. A more definitive study would require further analysis of the three translation dialects by Aymara speakers from other dialect a r e a s , with additional data from different areas.

9-2

Phonology

From the point of view of speakers of other Aymara d i a l e c t s ( e s p e c i a l l y , t h o s e who are m o n o l i n g u a l in A y m a r a ) , M i s s i o n a r y , Patrdn, and Radio Aymara tend to be spoken with a Spanish accent (albeit the Spanish is itself A n d e a n , reflecting to an as-yet-undetermined extent a substratum of languages native to the area). The components of this accent include a tendency to produce the five cardinal Spanish vowels and intonation patterns associated with that l a n g u a g e . Pronunciation is often perceived as overly p r e c i s e and s l o w , e x c e p t in the case of radio d e l i v e r y which may be considered overly clipped and staccato. (To what extent these perceptions are due to phonological factors, and how much they are influenced by morphology and syntax, are questions needing further investigation.)
As noted in 2 - 4 . 1 1 , all published M i s s i o n a r y and Patrdn texts use the five Spanish vowels. Most confuse the velar and postvelar occlusives and fricatives and the plain, aspirated, and glottalized occlusives. Even if these phonemes are distinguished, the writing systems

680

often fail to keep them apart or use cumbersome means to

do s o , as in the c a s e of the v e l a r f r i c a t i v e w r i t t e n i and

the postvelar fricative written

When these cluster,

as frequently happens, unwieldy and ambiguous sequences

like jjj or j jj j can result whose disambiguation requires

the use of h y p h e n s , as in the f o l l o w i n g e x a m p l e from

H e r r e r o e t a l . (1 971 : 1 9 6 9 ) : paj - j j e t a 'pay m e ' . In t h e

Yapita phonemic alphabet this word would be unambiguously

rendered as pajxi ta .

9-3

Morphophonemics

Missionary, PatrcJn, and Radio Aymara observe regular vowel-dropping and -retaining rules as do other dialects, except that stylistically-conditioned final vowel d r o p p i n g o c c u r s less often in M i s s i o n a r y and Patrdn Aymara than in o t h e r d i a l e c t s . S t e m - f i n a l vowel r e s t o r a tion with stress thereby occurring on the a n t e p e n u l t i m a t e vowel (see 4 - 3 . 3 3 ) occurs frequently on v e r b s , usually with the Imperative 2+3 s u f f i x , in radio a d v e r t i s e m e n t s or announcements urging listeners to buy something or be p r e s e n t at an e v e n t , as in the following e x a m p l e s :

al.t'a.si.pini.ma 'be sure to buy'

buy

2+3

I

yati.ya.si.p.ka.rak.tama

notify

3+2

S

'they are notifying you'

681

An example of the pattern with 4+3 Simple tense occurred in a B a p t i s t s e r m o n in La P a z .

. . . kun.jam.s sgr.s.tana . . .

how

go 4+3

S

'. . . how we are getting along'

The antepenultimate stress pattern also occurs on examples given in the P a t r d n A y m a r a c a t a l o g u e s , such as the f o l l o w i n g verbs with 2+3 Imperative:

+sara.ma

'go1

+q'Tpi.ma

'carry on (your) back'

+ap£.ni.ma 'ca rry'

+irp5.ni.ma 'take a person'

These Patrdn Aymara forms are interpreted by most native s p e a k e r s as r u d e o r d e r s , according to Vcisquez and Yapita (see 9-4).

9-4

Morphology

As we have a l r e a d y s e e n , in A y m a r a some s u f f i x e s are used as softeners and politives: certain noun and verb derivationals (e.g. diminutives on nouns and the suffix -t'a- on verbs), independents, and the final suffix - y a , alone or in c o m b i n a t i o n . From the point of view of other speakers Missionary and Patrdn Aymara usually fail

682

to use enough politives with the Imperative and Future tenses. That is, they tend to use forms like those at the end of 9-3, which would be appropriate for a parent speaking to a c h i l d , among brothers and sisters, between spouses in certain c i r c u m s t a n c e s , or between a buyer and seller who do not know each other. Between adult friends, compadres, a seller and buyer who know each other, and among family members, forms with politives are the norm, e.g. sara.ma.y 'please go' with -ya final suffix.
According to Yapita and Vasquez, the drills provided by Herrero et al. (1971-2) sound like o r d e r s , some less brusgue than others, but orders nevertheless, because they lack politive suffixes. Yapita and Vasquez indicate that use of such forms by persons in a u t h o r i t y , such as a Catholic priest or a Protestant m i n i s t e r , is perceived by many Aymara speakers as evidence of a more or less arrogant assumption of superiority. Compared to Missionary and Patron Aymara, Radio Aymara uses more of the verbal derivational and independent suffixes, although not of -ya p o l i t i v e , and is therefore perceived as more c o u r t e o u s .
T h e passive in S p a n i s h is often t r a n s l a t e d in Missionary Aymara by the verbal derivational suffix combination -ya.si -, consisting of -ya- causative followed by -si - r e c i p r o c a l / r e f 1 e x i v e , as in the f o l l o w i n g e x a m p l e from a Baptist sermon:

Jesucristo Tat.itu.ru iyaw sa.m uka.t.wa

Lord

yes say 2+3 then

I

683

q"ispi.ya.si.:ta juma.sa familia.ma.sa.

save

2p

family 2p

escape

Missionary meaning: 'Put your faith in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household' (Acts 16-31, New English Bible)
Non-Missionary meaning: 'Agree with the Lord Jesus Christ, and you and your family will cause yourselves to escape.' (La Paz/Compi)

A non-Missionary revision of the latter part of the sentence is the following:

. . . juma.s familia.ma.s uka.t salva.ta.:.ni.

2p

family 2p then save

3+3

F

. . . 'then you and your family will be saved.' (La Paz/Compi)

The verb s a l v a - , from the Spanish salvar 'to s a v e ' , here has the resultant nominalizina suffix -ta followed by verbalization and the Future t e n s e . This appears to be closer to the sense of the English.

9-5

Morphosyntax and Syntax

Some final s u f f i x e s are used d i f f e r e n t l y in Mi ss i o n a r y and Patr<5n A y m a r a than in o t h e r d i a l e c t s . For example, the absolute suffix -wa tends to occur most often on v e r b s . In a Patrdn A y m a r a v e r s i o n of Little Red Ridinghood (Sebeok 1951a) -wa occurs once on the negative

684
particle jani but otherwise always on v e r b s . This is not the c a s e in o t h e r d i a l e c t s . As i n d i c a t e d in C h a p t e r 8 , frequent use of -wa, especially with verb tenses already implying direct personal knowledge, increases the personal knowledge connotation (see 9-6.13).
Some n o m i n a l i z i n g s u b o r d i n a t i o n o c c u r s in all dialects; however, the Sebeok story has very little. Spoken Missionary texts and the stories recorded by Wexler (1967) use normal levels of subordination by nominalization although they tend not to use uka as resumator.
Certain s y n t a c t i c l i n k e r s used in M i s s i o n a r y Aymara are composed of native Aymara roots and suffixes but have d i f f e r e n t m e a n i n g s in M i s s i o n a r y Aymara than e l s e w h e r e . The following are the most common:

kuna.1a,yku,ti.xa uka.mpi.sa

Missionary 'because'
'but'

Non-Missionary not used
'with that1

Perhaps more than any other one feature, use of kuna.1ayku.ti.xa stamps a speaker as having some association with missionaries, usually Protestants, although the term has been a d o p t e d by some C a t h o l i c s . It o c c u r s in the c o n v e r sation of members of religious sects, but it did not occur in the Baptist sermon a n a l y z e d for this s t u d y , the Spanish

685

loan porque being used instead. The expression kuna 1 a y k u . t i . x a is built on the i n t e r r o g a t i v e kuna 'what' p l u s t h e s u f f i x - 1 a y k u 'on a c c o u n t o f ' . T h e q u e r y k u n a .1ayku.sa is an i n c r e d u l o u s , complaining q u e s t i o n , like 'Why?!? ' To persons who do not use the Missionary term, kuna.1ayku.ti.xa retains some of the heavy semantic freight of kuna.1ayku.sa, injecting a jarring note into sentences like the following:

Jupa.naka.x jik.xata.si.waya.p.x.i

3p

meet

3-*3

S

kuna.layku.ti.xa

wali suma t"uq.ta.wi.naka.w . . . very good dance

Missionary meaning: 'They met together because of the very good dancing. '
Non-Missionary meaning: 'They met together—Why?!?' There were very good dances.'

Jupa.naka.t ma: juk'.ita disculpa may.xa.p.x.ta

3p

a little pardon ask

1+3

S

kuna.layku.ti.x na.naka.x uras.pacha.x

lp

pant.xa.s.iri.:.p.x.t.w.

make mistakes

l->3

S

Missionary m e a n i n g : 'We ask them to pardon us because we sometimes make mistakes.'

686

Non-Missionary meaning: 'We ask them to pardon us - Why?!? - We sometimes make mistakes.'
The above examples were both said by a 20-year-old Baptist male speaker. A non-Missionary dialect speaker would omit the kuna.1ayku.ti.xa, subordinating one part of the sent e n c e to the o t h e r by j u x t a p o s i t i o n as in the f o l l o w i n g :

Uniwirsira.r sara.: 1iyi.na.xa.w. (La Paz/Compi) university go 1+3 read lp
F
I'll go to the university because I have some reading to do/to do some reading I have to do.' (La Paz/Compi)

An example of Missionary Aymara use of uka.mpi.sa is the following from W e x l e r ( 1 9 6 7 : 1 4 4 ) :

+Marfa, uta.sa.x wali suma.wa, uka.mpi.s cocina.sa.x

house 4p very nice

kitchen 4p

k'anu.wa. dirty

Missionary meaning: 'Maria, our house is very nice, but the kitchen is dirty.'
Non-Missionary meaning: Maria, our house is very delicious, besides that, the kitchen is dirty.' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco)

As the above shows, the non-Missionary meaning of uka.mpi.sa is c o n j u n c t i v e r a t h e r than d i s j u n c t i v e . In a n y case it is not much u s e d . Vcisquez perceived it as a mistaken r e n d i t i o n of u k a . m p i . n . s a 'in spite of t h a t ' . Other

687

A y m a r a t r a n s l a t i o n s of ' b u t ' in a d d i t i o n to u k a . m p i . s a are uka s.ipan.sti 'so s a y i n g ' , which is cited by Ebbing (1965:198) and consists of uka 'that' followed by the verb sa.na 'to say' with the s u b o r d i n a t o r -ipana and the final suffix -s t i; and the Spanish loan pero 'but', often A y m a r i z e d as p i r u , w h i c h o c c u r s in m a n y A y m a r a d i a l e c t s even among monolinguals.
In a d d i t i o n to o c c u r r i n g on k u n a . 1 a y k u , the final suffix combination -ti.xa also occurs f r e q u e n t l y in Missionary Aymara on other interrogatives serving as indefinites (and glossing as relatives in English or Spanish): kawk.n.iri.ti.xa 'the one where/in w h i c h 1 , kun.jama.ti.xa 'whatever', k"iti.ti.xa 'whoever', and qawg"a.ni.ti.xa 'however many'. Examples (from Compi):

Intrik.xa.:.wa anchit urasa.na sifiura kawk.n.iri.ti.x

turn over 1+3 now

F

S

ak.sa tugi grawasyuna.t. here around recording.

'I will now turn over (the microphone) at this time (to) the lady who permitted me to talk a while on this recording. '

Juma.x kun.jama.ti.x s.ista.xa . . .

688

Iri t h e s e s e n t e n c e s t h e i n t e r r o g a t i v e s w i t h - t i . x a a r e n o t f o l l o w e d by uka r e s u m a t o r . In n o n - M i s s i o n a r y A y m a r a - t i . x a occurs infrequently, as a subordinator of verbs and demonsstratives. It may also occur on i n t e r r o g a t i v e s , but when it does it is u s u a l l y o r d e r e d f i r s t in a s e n t e n c e and followed later by uka r e s u m a t o r , as in the e x a m p l e s given in 7 - 4 . 2 4 .
An e x a m p l e of c o d e - s w i t c h i n g in w h i c h S p a n i s h all but submerges the Aymara is the following s e n t e n c e , again from the Baptist sermon referred to earlier:

Yo creo que jani.w hermana.naka.s.

I think that "fro

sister

'I think not, sisters.'

The only Aymara in the above sentence is the n e g a t i v e particle jani with the absolute final suffix -wa (reduced to w) and the Aymara plural suffix - n a k a , which is followed by the Spanish plural ^ s . The m e a n i n g conveyed is somewhat stronger than the above translation would imply, due to the presence of -wa; a closer approximation would be 'No, sisters, I know it's not so.'
A l t h o u g h s u c c e s s i v e e m b e d d i n g in noun p h r a s e s is possible in Aymara (see 7 - 4 . 2 ) , it is not very c o m m o n . It occurs with more than usual f r e q u e n c y in a story told by a P r o t e s t a n t m i n i s t e r from La Paz (Wexler 1 9 6 7 : 4 5 4 - 4 5 6 ) .

689

Two noun phrases have three nouns each, two have four, a one has five, as follows:

*tiwula.n pi si chuyma.:.ta.p

fox

lack wisdom

3p

'the fox's stupidity'

+tiwula.n wawa.naka.pa.n jiwa.ra.ya.ta.pa

fox

child

3p die

3p

'the murder (one by one) of the fox's children'

+wal.ja suma

paru wawa.naka.ni

many beautiful wheat- child

Raver

colored

'haver of many beautiful wheat-colored children'

+wallata.n suma

paru wawa.naka.p

beautiful wheat- child 3p

colored

'the lake bird's beautiful wheat-colored children'

+ u k a pi si chuyma puyri tiwula.x that lack wisdom poor fox
'that poor stupid fox'

The high incidence of embedded noun phrases may be attributable to the influence of English-speaking

690

missionaries, since English makes greater use of noun p h r a s e e m b e d d i n g than S p a n i s h d o e s . In o t h e r r e s p e c t s , however, the story does not appear to follow Spanish or English word o r d e r . In f a c t , it shows a rather high incidence of all kinds of subordination, with a more intricate manipulation of Aymara grammatical processes than occurs in most folk tales recorded for this s t u d y . For this reason, before high incidence of noun phrase embedding can be ascribed to English influence, further analysis of texts is n e e d e d .
On the other hand, Patrdn and Radio Aymara yield many obvious examples of Spanish word order transferred to A y m a r a . The following is the introductory sentence of the Patrdn Aymara version of Little Red Ridinghood (Sebeok 1951a: 54) :

+Ma: uru ma: warmi sa.tayn imil1a.pa.ru one 3ay a woman say 3+3 girl 3p
RIK

< Apa.m aka manq'a awicha.ma.ru, jich"a usu.ta.:.s.k.i.w.>

take 2+3 this food grand- 2p

now sick

3+3

I

mother

S

'One day a woman said to her daughter, "Take this food to your grandmother, she's sick now.'"

In A y m a r a zero c o m p l e m e n t s (such as aka m a n q ' a 'this f o o d ' ) usually precede the verb. The above sentence and the whole

691

story from which it is taken are also unusual in the a b s e n c e of -xa final suffix (the teller of the story is identified as being from La P a z , w h e r e use of -xa is the n o r m ) , in the occurrence of the final suffix -wa only on verbs (and once on the n e g a t i v e ) , and in the use of very few verbal derivational suffixes.
The following example is from a radio announcement of a dance rehearsal for an impending festival. It contains an Aymara phrase translated word for word (or suffix for word) from Spanish and two untranslated Spanish phrases.

Uka.t.rak jan sara.ha.mpi, ut. ja.ni .wa reuniofi y

careful no go

be 3+3

meeting and

F

practica Sctbado diecinueve de agosto taqi .ni .s

practice Saturday

19

of August all

sara.nta.si.p.ka.:ta.wa.

go

2+3

F

'Be careful of not going (be sure to go), there will be a meeting and rehearsal Saturday August 19, all of you go.'

The Aymara uka.t.rak jan sara.ha.mpi translates the Spanish cuidado con no ir. The suffix -mpi translates con 'with' and uka.t.rak translates cuidado 'careful'. The following is a suggested revision by Y a p i t a , to eliminate direct translation from Spanish:

692

Uka.t.rak jan sara.si.p.ka.sma.ti. (La Paz/Compi)

careful no go

2->3

D-l

'Be careful of not going (be careful not to miss it).'

This uses the Desiderative tense which, with -raki independent suffix, conveys the cautionary 'be careful'.
Radio Aymara has developed distinctive phrases for indicating the time, such as the following, which also shows influence of direct translation from Spanish:

Llatunka minutu.naka.ki,w. p"a!t.xa.rak.i llatunka

nine

minute

lack

3+3

S

arum urasa.taki. night hours for

'And it's only nine minutes before nine p.m.'

This sentence reflects the Spanish Nueve minutos faltan para las nueve horas de 1 a noche, 'Nine minutes are lacking for nine o ' c l o c k in the e v e n i n g , ' e x c e p t t h a t , instead of the more commonly used Spanish loan for nine o'clock, las nuywi (las n u e v e ) , it uses the native Aymara number 11atunka 'nine' plus aruma 'time after dark and before dawn' followed by the Spanish loan urasa (horas). Removing the plural suffix -naka on minutu (superfluous on a noun preceded by a number) and the direct Spanish translation urasa.taki (-taki

693

t r a n s l a t i n g para 'for'), the sentence is reworked by Yapita as follows:

Llatunk minutu.mpi.x las nuywi.:.ni.w. (La Paz/Compi)

nine

minute with

nine 3+3

F

'In (with) nine minutes it will be nine o'clock.'

9-6 9-6.1 9-6.11

Semantics Linguistic postulates Four-person system

Since the 16th century the first and fourth grammatical persons have often been confused by nonnative speakers of Aymara. Anomalies such as Na.naka.n Awki.sa still occur today as the first words of the Lord's Prayer, 'Our Father'. Na.na ka.n is the exclusive lp p o s s e s s i v e , 'our but not your', while Awki.sa has the inclusive 4p possessive on the noun awki ' f a t h e r 1 , meaning 'father of you and m e ' . The whole phrase Na.naka.n Awki.sa is therefore a semantic impossibility, 'our-but-not-your father-of-youand-me'. However, merely correcting the phrase to Na.naka.n Awki.xa, with the lp possessive suffix -xa on awki , does not improve matters, inasmuch as the hearer would then feel excluded: 'our father but not yours.' Using the 4p for both, Jiwasa.n Awki.sa avoids exclusivity but might be objected to on the ground that 'Our F a t h e r ' in the context of the Lord's Prayer is addressed to God and that

694

t h e r e f o r e the exclusive lp plural is a p p r o p r i a t e , rather than the inclusive 4p; God cannot be our father and simultaneously His own (unless, perhaps, He is being addressed as the Trinity). The real problem, however, according to Y a p i t a , is that in Aymara, God cannot be humanly p o s s e s s e d . T h e r e f o r e , a term preferred by some Aymara speakers as a term of address or reference for God is Suma Awki 'Good F a t h e r ' , as in

Suma Awki yanap.ta.ni.p.xa.k.ita.y.

help

2+1

I

'Good Father, help us.' (La Paz/Compi)4

An example of another typical confusion of the first and fourth persons is the following from Tarifa (1969:127):

+Na.naka lura.p.xa.nani.

lp

do

ZRT

F

H e r e , the pronoun subject is lp but the subject conveyed in the verb inflectional suffix is 4 p , r e s u l t i n g in the c o n t r a d i c t o r y message 'We (not including y o u ) and you will do it' .
The following sentence from one of the Patr6n Aymara phrase catalogues fails to use the 4p to include

695

the 2p hearer in what one proposes to d o , as a form of courtesy.

+Uka uma chur.ita par.j.itu.wa.

that water give 2+1 thirst 3+1

I

S

T h e a b o v e s e n t e n c e is s u p p o s e d to m e a n Un^ p o c o d e a g u a dcfme, tengo sed ('Give me a little w a t e r , I'm t h i r s t y ' ) . It is not p a r t i c u l a r l y p o l i t e in any c a s e , but the e f f e c t in non-Patron Aymara is closer to 'Gimme that w a t e r , can't you see I'm t h i r s t y ? ' As we saw in 8 - 2 . 2 , a p o l i t e r e q u e s t for w a t e r w o u l d use the 4 p , i n c l u d i n g the a d d r e s s e e in the invitation even if he or she is being asked to provide the water.
In t h e f o l l o w i n g e x a m p l e f r o m W e x l e r ( 1 9 6 7 : 1 4 4 ) rudeness results from using the 2p instead of the 4p as subject of the verb inflection, thereby implying that the a d d r e s s e e is a d o g (a n o n p e r s o n ) :

+Aka.x manq'a.x Jose, manq'a.n mun.ta.ti?

here food

eat

want 2 3

S

The intended meaning is a m a t t e r - o f - f a c t announcement that dinner is r e a d y , but the impression conveyed is badtempered, something like 'Here's food, Jos£, will you shut up and eat it?'

696
9-6.12 Human/nonhuman
Certain Missionary and Patrdn usages result from failure to take into account the human/nonhuman postulate. The following type of sentence occurs frequently:
+Uka.x wawa.xa.wa. 'That is my child.' (Ross n.d.:9) that child lp
As indicated in 8 - 2 . 2 1 , use of a d e m o n s t r a t i v e as a pronoun referring directly to a human being is avoided unless rudeness is intended. This does not appear to be true of Missionary Aymara, but such sentences as the above are nevertheless perceived as rude by non-Missionary s p e a k e r s .
Certain nouns are used without reference to the h u m a n / n o n h u m a n d i s t i n c t i o n in M i s s i o n a r y and Patrdn A y m a r a . For e x a m p l e , in t h e s e two d i a l e c t s the common n o u n s jach'a 'big' and jisk'a 'small' are used to refer to anything, human or nonhuman; the requirement that the n o u n - e r a s e s jach'a tansa 'tall' and jisk'a tansa 'short' be used for human r e f e r e n c e is not o b s e r v e d . S i m i l a r l y , the usual restrictions on the noun suma 'good, tasty, very' do not a p p l y . Use of suma to modify a human noun directly is not perceived as obscene, suma tawaqu being used to mean 'nice girl' and the verbalized form Suma.:.ta.wa, 'You're nice.' To Yapita, another anomaly results from attempted metaphoric use of suma laxra 'delicious tongue' (i.e. a meat

697

d i s h ) for 'fine l a n g u a g e , ' in the t i t l e of the Tarifa grammar (1969).
Another noun used generally for human and nonhuman in M i s s i o n a r y and Patrdn A y m a r a , but only for n o n h u m a n r e f e r e n c e in o t h e r d i a l e c t s , is m u x s a ' s w e e t ' . In M i s s i o n ary and Patrdn Aymara it may mean either 'sweet-tasting' or 'sweet(ly), pieasant(1y),' with reference to food, activit i e s , or p e o p l e . A typical sentence is that cited by Ebbing (1965:79).

+Musxa Virgen Marfa.taki muxsa q'uchu.hani.

sweet

for sweet sing 4->3

F/I

The intended m e a n i n g is 'Let's sing s w e e t l y for the sweet Virgin M a r y , ' but the n o n - M i s s i o n a r y meaning is 'Let's sing sweet-tastingly for the sweet-tasting Virgin Mary.'
C e r t a i n o t h e r n o u n s used o n l y for h u m a n s in o t h e r dialects are used for n o n h u m a n s in M i s s i o n a r y and Patron A y m a r a . T h e s e i n c l u d e j u t ' u , w h i c h P a r e d e s C a n d i a (1 9 6 3 : 35) indicated could be used to refer to small objects, but a c c o r d i n g to V a s q u e z it is a term used to address a human adversary who is smaller than o n e s e l f . The noun q"uru 'bad, v i c i o u s ' is used by Wexler (1967:21) to refer to a d o g ; in other d i a l e c t s it is used to refer o n l y to p e o p l e . The derived noun j a m a s a . t a 'in hiding f r o m ' is used by Ebbing (1965:91) to refer to sheep used as a metaphor for people, as follows:

698

+Awat.iri.p jamasa.ta oveja.naka.x manq'a.p.x.i.wa.

shepherd 3p hiding

sheep

eat

3+3

S

'Hiding from their shepherd, the sheep ate.'

According to Y a p i t a , in Aymara culture sheep are encouraged to e a t , and w o u l d in no c a s e be c o n s i d e r e d c a p a b l e of g u i l e ; their use as a m e t a p h o r for p e o p l e is t h e r e f o r e not appropri ate.
In M i s s i o n a r y , P a t r d n , and R a d i o Aymara, t r a n s l a t i o n often results in what in other d i a l e c t s would be v i o l a t i o n s of Aymara selectional restrictions on verb subjects and c o m p l e m e n t s (refer to 8 - 2 . 2 5 ) . For e x a m p l e , in the B a p t i s t sermon already referred to, the following sentence occurred:

Ma: ejemplo hermana.naka.s usku.:na, no?

an example sister

put 3+3

RDK

This is intended to mean 'He was an e x a m p l e , w a s n ' t h e , s i s t e r s ? ' The Spanish noun e j e m p l o , a s s o c i a t e d in S p a n i s h w i t h the v e r b p o n e r 'to p u t , p l a c e ' as in poner un e j e m p l o 'to give or be an e x a m p l e , ' may take either concrete or abstract complements. But the verb the speaker chose to t r a n s l a t e poner is usku.ha 'to put a small object in somet h i n g ' ( e . g . , a key in a k e y h o l e ) , w h i c h in n o n - M i s s i o n a r y Aymara takes a nonliving, concrete zero complement. The meaning of the sentence outside of the Missionary context is t h e r e f o r e s o m e t h i n g l i k e 'He p u t an e x a m p l e (a small s o m e t h i n g ) in s o m e t h i n g . '

In n o n - M i s s i o n a r y La Paz Aymara the verb a t i p a . n a takes a human s u b j e c t and human c o m p l e m e n t , and m e a n s 'to d e f e a t or o v e r c o m e an a d v e r s a r y ' . In M i s s i o n a r y A y m a r a it is extended to take nonliving complements such as sin and d e a t h . 5 The derived form a t i p.j a . n a is also similarly used in M i s s i o n a r y A y m a r a , a l t h o u g h in o t h e r d i a l e c t s it means 'to defeat and then to e s c a p e ' . The following example is from the Baptist sermon already referred to:

Pas.ir lecciona.n.xa yati.ya:tan.wa

last lesson

learn 4+3

RDK

Cristo.xa

jucha.ru.s jiwa.na.ru.s atip.ja.ta.pa.ta.

sin

death

defeat

3p

The intended m e a n i n g is 'In the last lesson we learned a b o u t C h r i s t ' s o v e r c o m i n g sin and d e a t h . ' In n o n - M i s s i o n ary Aymara the sentence implies Christ defeated someone and then escaped.
The f o l l o w i n g occurred in a radio a n n o u n c e m e n t . It illustrates failure to abide by selectional restrictions with respect to verb subjects:

. . . niya.ki.xa.y fiesta.w jak'a.cha.si.n.ka.rak.i.

already

close

3+3

S

The intended m e a n i n g of this is '. . . and the fiesta is already a l m o s t h e r e ' , i . e . , is nearing in t i m e . The

700

i m p l i c a t i o n , h o w e v e r , is that the fiesta is moving physically closer, since the verbalized noun jak'a.cha.si.n.katakes a physically moving s u b j e c t . A preferable verb in this instance, according to Y a p i t a , would be puri.na 'to arrive', which can take a human or nonhuman nonliving subject (see 8-2.25).
The following is also from a radio a n n o u n c e m e n t . The Spanish reciban sus saludos 'receive your greetings' is t r a n s l a t e d word for word (although the word o r d e r is changed), giving the following:

. . . arum.t'a.naka.ma katu.q.t'a.sf.p.xa.ma.

greeting

2p receive

2+3

I

Normally the verb k a t u . q . t ' a . s i . h a means 'to receive an object' rather than something nonliving and immaterial like g r e e t i n g s . (The a b o v e e x p r e s s i o n is also odd in that the zero complement, arum.t'a.naka.ma, retains the final vowel even though it occurs before the verb.) Yapita suggested as a preferable substitute for the above:

Arum.t'a.ni.p.x.tam. 'They greet you.' 3+2 S
In the f o l l o w i n g e x a m p l e t h e r e is no p r o b l e m w i t h the reference of subject or complement but the meaning is distorted by too literal t r a n s l a t i o n :

701

Fabrica Nacional de Tejidos Pol ones tuqi.n.xa

factory national of knitwear

around

jich"a.w ya:mas ultimos modelo.nak.wa

ap.s.t'a.ya.si.p.ka.rak.i.

take

.

3+3

bring o u z

S

'The Polonesa National Knitwear Factory is now having even more up-to-date models brought out.'

The verb ap.s.t'a.ya.si.p.ka.rak.i translates the Spanish est£n h a c i e n d o s a c a r 'are h a v i n g b r o u g h t o u t ' . In A y m a r a this implies physically taking or bringing something out, rather than p r o d u c i n g , the derived m e a n i n g in both Spanish and E n g l i s h . A better t r a n s l a t i o n in Aymara would be l u r . t a . y a . s i . p . k a . r a k . i 'they are having m a d e ' (La Paz/ C o m p i ) . As a m a t t e r of f a c t , in the s e n t e n c e just cited the announcer, apparently dissatisfied with ap.s.t'a.ya. s i . p . k a . r a k . i , added immediately after it p'it.t'a.ya.si. p.ka.rak.i 'they are having knitted'.
Yapita has pointed out (personal communication) that radio announcers frequently use j i k i.n a 'to m e e t , to find' with an inanimate subject, to translate the S p a n i s h se e n c u e n t r a 'is f o u n d , is l o c a t e d ' as in

Kuriyu.x kalli Ayakuchu.n jik.xata.s.i. post office street Ayacucho find
S 'The Post Office is found (located) on Ayacucho Street.'

702

To Yapita this is i n c o r r e c t , the verb jik.xata.si.ha requiring a living, moving subject. A correct way to express the m e a n i n g , he s u g g e s t s , would be
Kuriyu.x kal1i Ayakuchu.n.k.i.wa. 'The Post Office is on Ayachucho Street.' (La Paz/Compi)

Examples of correct sentences with j iki.ha or derived forms would be

P"isi.x achak jik.xata.tayna.w. 'The cat found a mouse.'

9-6.13 Di rectiy/1ndi rectiy-acqui red knowledge
A third l i n g u i s t i c p o s t u l a t e which is w e a k e n e d in M i s s i o n a r y Aymara (though not in Patron or Radio A y m a r a ) is the distinction of d i r e c t and indirect k n o w l e d g e s o u r c e . Usually Missionary Aymara uses tenses and final suffixes that imply direct personal knowledge, apparently as a reflection of the Christian emphasis on acceptance by faith. According to Yapita and V a s q u e z , use of such forms is a p p r o p r i a t e for e y e - w i t n e s s a c c o u n t s , but their use in stories or sermons telling of events the speaker could not possibly have experienced p e r s o n a l l y is perceived as inappropriate and ludicrous.

703

The only indirect knowledge marker used to any extent in M i s s i o n a r y Aymara (apart from 3+3 RIK used as a surprisal) is the reportive s a . n a , employed primarily in quoting Biblical t e x t s . The following is an excerpt from the Baptist sermon aforesaid, the subject of which was the story of the doubting apostle Thomas:

C

. . . si.wa <Benaventurados> s.i.wa <Kusi.si.ha.w

said

blessed

said

blessed

Diosa.taki.x> s.i.wa jan un.j.ka.sina cree uka.ru.

Fod for

SHtd

no seeing

believe that

" . . . it says (in the Bible) "Blessed" it says "Blessed for God" it says "(are they who) not seeing, believe that."1

But in m a n y o t h e r i n s t a n c e s p r e a c h e r s and s t o r y t e l l e r s associated with religious sects use the unadorned Remote D i r e c t K n o w l e d g e or S i m p l e t e n s e s , as in the f o l l o w i n g from the same sermon:

Kawki.:.ri discipulo.pa.s hermanas jani cree.ka.:n.ti?

which

disciple 3p sisters no believe 3+3

RDK

The Missionary meaning of the above is 'Which of His disciples, sisters, did not believe?1 To Vasquez and Yapita the sentence implies that the speaker and/or the addressees were present on the occasion of T h o m a s ' expression of d i s b e l i e f ; it is as if the s e n t e n c e c o n t a i n e d the

704

additional reminder, 'You remember, we were there and heard him say s o . ' In n o n - M i s s i o n a r y A y m a r a t h e v e r b w o u l d have the 3+3 RIK tense conveying indirect acquisition of the information and sa.ha embedding would probably also be used to increase the s p e a k e r ' s d i s t a n c e in time and knowledge from the matter referred to. To Missionary Aymara speakers, use of indirect knowledge markers apparently implies d i s b e l i e f , which is at all costs to be a v o i d e d .
The influence of this attitude extends to the telling of f o l k t a l e s . W h e r e a s 3 + 3 R I K s u f f i x e s ( - t a y n a o r -i ri t a y n a or their v a r i a n t s ) are very common in stories told by nonMissionary s p e a k e r s , the tense is almost entirely absent in s t o r i e s told by M i s s i o n a r y - t r a i n e d p e r s o n s . A few -tayna's usually creep into Missionary-told folktales, however, attesting to the strength of the direct/indirect k n o w l e d g e p o s t u l a t e in A y m a r a ; a l t h o u g h it may be s u p p r e s s e d , it cannot be entirely e r a d i c a t e d .
As perceived by Vcisquez, use of the Future tense with implied personal k n o w l e d g e in the following sentence from Ebbing (1965:83) is ludicrous:

+Jucha.cha.s.iri.naka.x jani.w alax.pacha.r

sinner

no

heaven

manta.ka.ni.ti. enter 3+3
F
The intended meaning is 'Sinners will not go to H e a v e n ' ,

705

but the implication is that the speaker will personally see to it that they don't. To avoid giving this impression, the following may be added.

. . . s.i.w Yusa.n aru.pa.n.xa. 'so it says in God's word.' says God's word (La Paz/Tiahuanaco)
To Vcfsquez, another example using the Future also implies
a threat (Wexler 1967:368).

+Jupa.ti.x aymar jan yati.q.ka.ni.xa,

3p

F

jani.w Wuliwya.r sar.ka.ni.ti.

F

'If he doesn't learn Aymara, he won't go to Bolivia. (I'll see to it.)' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco)

9-6.14

Imposition of singular/plural

In c o n t r a s t to f a i l u r e to a b i d e by A y m a r a l i n g u i s t i c

postulates is the imposition of the singular/plural distinc-

t i o n . The most obvious overmarking of plural is that

e x e m p l i f i e d in the B a p t i s t sermon referred t o , in which

the preacher used the Spanish loan hermana 'sister' plus

the Aymara plural suffix -naka plus the Spanish plural

suffix

hermana.naka.s 'sisters'. Elsewhere, Missionary

and Patron Aymara mark the plural both on nouns and verbs

with much more r e g u l a r i t y than occurs in other Aymara dia-

1ects.

706
As i n d i c a t e d in 8 - 2 . 2 2 , the noun awki has a c q u i r e d a s s o c i a t i o n with dogs in such e x p r e s s i o n s as A w k i . m a . s t i 'And (how is) your father?' To Vcisquez, when the plural suffix -naka is added to awki (or even to the noun tata ' f a t h e r ' ) the insult is c o m p o u n d e d , as in the f o l l o w i n g (Wexler 1967:21):
+Awki.naka.ni.:.ta.ti ? 2+3 S
This is intended to translate the Spanish inquiry to a c h i l d , 'Do you have p a r e n t s ? ' , i . e . , 'Are your parents living?' According to V^squez such a question is culturally incorrect, as it is not something one would usually ask a p e r s o n , even a c h i 1 d , d i r e c t l y . S e c o n d l y , awki 'father' is here misused to translate Spanish padre in the sense of 'parent'. Finally, adding -naka to awki gives the meaning 'Do you have fathers?" which is like saying 'Does your mother know who your father is?'
9-6.2 Other semantic peculiarities
T h e r e are other s e m a n t i c p e c u l i a r i t i e s in M i s s i o n a r y and Patrdn Aymara that may not be attributable to failure to recognize linguistic postulates but are nevertheless o f f e n s i v e to speakers of other d i a l e c t s . An e x a m p l e is use of the noun yuqalla, which has derogatory connotations in m o s t d i a l e c t s u n l e s s it o c c u r s followed by wawa 'child'

707

as in yuqall wawa 'boy c h i l d , little boy.' Use of yugal1 a as a term of a d d r e s s is e s p e c i a l l y r e s e n t e d , as in the following (Ebbing, 1965:11):
+Juta.m yuqalla.y! 'Come here, boy!'
If said to an a d u l t , this has much the same impact as the s e n t e n c e w o u l d have in E n g l i s h , even t h o u g h the p o s i t i v e suffix -ya occurs in the s e n t e n c e . Said to a c h i l d , it means something like 'Come here, you little bastard!' And even when it is not used as a term of a d d r e s s , yugal1 a is offensive. The sentence

+K"iti.s uka yugalla.xa? (Wexler 1967:263) who that boy
intended to mean 'Who is that boy?' to non-Missionary speakers means instead something like 'Who's that poor little SOB?'
The catalogues of Aymara phrases are full of e x a m p l e s of this t y p e . In o n e c a s e a s p e l l i n g e r r o r changes what would be an impertinent question into a silly one.

+Junt'a.ta.ma ut.j.k.i.ti? pierce 2p exist 3+3 S

(CatSlogo 1971:36)

The intended m e a n i n g of this is 'Do you have a l o v e r ? ' But because of spelling e r r o r s , what is a c t u a l l y said i s ,

708

according to VcCsquez, 'Do you have your pincushion?' The intended meaning would be conveyed, rudely, by the fol1owi ng:

Uh.t'a.ta.ni.:.ta.ti?

look

2+3

S

literally, 'Do you have someone you look at?' The verb m u n a . h a 'to w a n t , l i k e , e s t e e m ' occurs
in a number of e x a m p l e s , such as the f o l l o w i n g (Wexler 1967:57):

+Kun.s munta.ti?^

As indicated by Wexler (1967), this means 'Do you want something?' but to Vasquez it has overtones of a suggestive c h a l l e n g e . A n o t h e r e x a m p l e is (Wexler 1 9 6 7 : 3 4 5 )

+Mun.ista.ti? 2+1 S

Intended to mean 'Do you need my h e l p ? ' , it actually m e a n s , according to V a s q u e z , 'Do you want/love/appreciate me?' Vasquez indicates that the correct Aymara for asking if someone needs help is

Yanap.t'a.:ma.cha? 1+2 F

'May I help you?' (La Paz/Tiahuanaco)

This has the Future tense and the alternative question suffix -cha.

709

Outside of Missionary or Patrdn Aymara the verb m u n a . h a is not used with c e r t a i n c o m p l e m e n t s in c e r t a i n contexts. The following sentences (Ebbing 1965:28,29) were rejected out of hand by Vcisquez and Yapita:

*Naya.x tata.xa.r mun.t.wa.

lp

father lp

1+3

S

T h e i n t e n d e d m e a n i n g is 'I l o v e m y f a t h e r ' , b u t t h e meaning conveyed is incestuous. The following implies sodomy:

*Na.ya. x an mun.t.wa.

1p

dog 1+3

S

A m o r e a p p r o p r i a t e s e n t e n c e for indicating that one would like to get a dog would be

Naya.x an uywa.si.h mun.t.wa.

lp

dog raise

1+3

S

'I would like to raise a dog.'

Other usages perceived as errors by Vcisquez are probably the result of mistaken translations or fanciful etymologies, like the following from Paredes Candia (1963):

710

anu ch'ap"i jamp'atu tunta

Paredes Candfa 'dog excrement'
'vagina 'potato starch' (almiddn de papa)

VSsquez (La Paz/Tiahuanaco)
'dog thorn', medicinal plant (Spanish amor seco)
'toad'
'potatoes which have been soaked in water, frozen, fermented, and sun dried'; an Andean staple food

In M i s s i o n a r y A y m a r a c e r t a i n l e x i c a l items have m e a n i n g s d i f f e r e n t from those they have in other d i a l e c t s , usually resulting from generalized applications of terms t h a t have more s p e c i a l i z e d , or n e g a t i v e , m e a n i n g s in o t h e r c o n t e x t s .

A final example of an expression used with a d i f f e r e n t m e a n i n g in M i s s i o n a r y A y m a r a than e l s e w h e r e is Y a t i . m , literally 'Know you (this).' The expression occurs at the beginning of a story (Wexler 1967:455)

712

when one c h a r a c t e r is about to tell another how to go about doing something. To Vcisquez, the meaning of the expression is closer to 'It serves you r i g h t ! ' , 'I t o l d y o u s o ! ' , ' T o u g h ! ' , or 'Grin a n d b e a r i t ! ' ; it would be said to someone who has done something against one's advice and is now c o m p l a i n i n g about the o u t c o m e .
Radio Aymara has a few specialized terms not used in e v e r y d a y s p e e c h , such as the verb atama.ha 'to a n n o u n c e a m e s s a g e ' . The following is an example of the way it would be used on the radio:

Jupa.x ma: papil qillq.ta.ta

'He left a written message to be announced.' ('He left a written message, "Announce it for me," saying.') (La Paz/Tiahuanaco)

9-7

Summary and Conclusion

Missionary and Patrdn Aymara differ from other dialects primarily in their d i s r e g a r d of linguistic postulates. Missionary Aymara, additionally, has certain distinctive usages. Radio Aymara closely reflects Spanish syntax and lexicon. As perceived by VSsquez

713
and Yapita, Missionary and Patrdn Aymara are often offensive as well as grammatically incorrect, while Radio Aymara is more often perceived as m e r e l y incorrect. Whether the translation dialects are perceived as substandard by a majority of Aymara speakers (that i s , to w h a t e x t e n t the p e r c e p t i o n s n o t e d in this c h a p t e r represent those of the Aymara community at large) remains to be i n v e s t i g a t e d . In any e v e n t , now t h a t l i t e r a r y production in Aymara and linguistic studies of the language are being undertaken by native speakers, a more lively and open discussion of what constitute standard and nonstandard usages within and across dialects may be anticipated.

714

Notes

T h e r e is some evidence that Aymara speakers who are n o t a c t i v e in i n s t i t u t i o n a l i z e d r e l i g i o n m a y o c c a sionally employ certain Missionary usages when talking to or telling stories in the hearing of non-Aymara persons associated in the s p e a k e r ' s mind with m i s s i o n a r i e s or o t h e r o u t s i d e r s w h o are p e r s o n s in a u t h o r i t y . For example, a source from Irpa Chico (Ingavi, departm e n t of La P a z ) not know to have any formal a f f i l i a t i o n with m i s s i o n a r i e s , in telling a f o l k t a l e to H . Martfn (1969:72-74), used direct knowledge verb forms, although he s w i t c h e d to i n d i r e c t k n o w l e d g e f o r m s in m i d s t r e a m (see 9-6.13). Yapita himself used kuna.1ayku.ti.xa (see 9 - 5 ) in a t a p e - r e c o r d e d g r e e t i n g to H a r d m a n in the late 1960's, but indicates that he would not use it today.

2 This is d o n e , for e x a m p l e , by Hardman et a l .
(1975), who produced the only published grammar of Aymara to date that does not reflect Missionary or Patrdn usages.

3 There are times when the use of -ya on an
I m p e r a t i v e would be i n a p p r o p r i a t e , as in amu . ki.ma..y. If used to a baby it m e a n s 'please be q u i e t ' , but if used to an adult it is very i n s u l t i n g , being what a rapist would say to quiet a victim (Briqgs & England 1973:22).

New T e s t a m e n t in A y m a r a , p u b l i s h e d by the B r i t i s h and Foreign Bible Society in 1941 and the A m e r i c a n Bible Society in 1 9 5 4 , use A l a x . p a c h a . n . k . i r i A w k i . s a 'Our F a t h e r in H e a v e n ' (with 4p - s a ) .

one language. Regional and social variation exists but it

does not significantly affect intelligibility except when

certain utterances are taken out of context, primarily

because the phonemic inventory is uniform (except for the

velar nasal occurring in only two areas and in very few

morphemes) and secondarily because all dialects share a

basic set of morphophonemic rules and a basic inventory

of morphemes with the same or very similar meanings and

similar phonological shapes. Because of the nature of

A y m a r a m o r p h o p h o n e m i c r u l e s , c e r t a i n m o r p h e m e s vary in

phonological shape within as well as across dialects.

As shown in c r o s s - d i a l e c t a l and i n t r a - d i a l e c t a l

p h o n o l o g i c a l c o r r e s p o n d e n c e s and in v o w e l - d r o p p i n g or

-retaining morphophonemic rules, certain Aymara phonemes

are unstable. The most unstable are the sonorants (vowels

716

717
and voiced consonants), then the fricatives, then the affricates and the velar and (to a lesser extent) the postvelar stops. The most stable are the bilabial and alveolar stops, but even the bilabial stop shows some i n s t a b i l i t y in one d i a l e c t , C a l a c a l a .
The morpheme class with the greatest variety of phonological shapes of allomorphs both intra- and interd i a l e c t a l l y is the class of verbal i n f l e c t i o n a l s u f f i x e s (person/tense suffixes). They vary not only because of phonemic instability but also because of (1) preservation or loss of different submorphemic recurrent partials, (2) processes of analogy that may operate within a given dialect, and (3) different patterns of merging what were apparently four paradigms into two, the present Desiderative and R e m o n s t r a t o r t e n s e s . In all tenses and d i a l e c t s the same person/tense suffixes are the most variable: those involving the 2p as complement (1+2, 3+2) and that involving 2p as s u b j e c t , lp as c o m p l e m e n t (2+1).
The closed class of roots having the most crossdialectal variation in inventory (that i s , in number of d i f f e r e n t p h o n o l o g i c a l 1 y d i s s i m i l a r roots and s t e m s ) is the temporal noun c l a s s . There is also c o n s i d e r a b l e variety in the inventory of open class nouns and verbs referring to agricultural practices. As for morphosyntactic p r o c e s s e s , there is evidence of (1) an incipient merging of the subordinating suffixes -sa and -sina (and variants),

718

and (2) variation in the incidence and usage of the subo r d i n a t o r - i p a n a , w h i c h in some d i a l e c t s is a m e m b e r of a functioning four-person paradigm that has fallen or is falling into disuse elsewhere.
W h i l e there is some c r o s s - d i a l e c t a l v a r i a t i o n in meaning or connotation of certain common roots and stems, Aymara l i n g u i s t i c p o s t u l a t e s are strong in all d i a l e c t s except the heavily Spanish-influenced Missionary, Patrdn, and R a d i o A y m a r a . T h e p r i m a r y l i n g u i s t i c p o s t u l a t e s (a four-person system, a distinction of human and nonhuman, and a distinction of direct and indirect knowledge) reinforce the phonological and lexical unity already noted and make for c r o s s - d i a l e c t a l c o m p r e h e n s i o n even in the p r e s e n c e of considerable lexical variation.
It is p r i m a r i l y on the basis of the p h o n o l o g i c a l shapes of a relatively few suffixes that Aymara dialects may be grouped regionally. Incidence of certain morphemes in a given d i a l e c t but not a n o t h e r and of d i f f e r e n c e s in meaning play a much less s i g n i f i c a n t role in defining regional groups, although they contribute to dialect diversity and give the speech of each community its individual stamp.

Regional Dialect Groups and Features

On the basis of regional patterning of certain morphemes by shape of allomorphs, incidence, and meaning,

719
Aymara dialects fall into two major groups: (1) a northern group of dialects located on or near Lake Titicaca and including La Paz (the city and the department), and (2) a southern group at a g r e a t e r distance from the lake in the departments of Oruro and Potosf. The intermediate dialects of Crlacoa and S i t a j a r a in s o u t h e r n Peru s o u t h w e s t of Lake Titicaca share some features with the northern and some with the southern group; Calacoa has more northern features, and Sitajara, more southern ones. (Figure 10-1 is a p r e l i m i n a r y a t t e m p t to distinguish the three d i a l e c t areas.)
Apart from the division into northern, southern, and i n t e r m e d i a t e d i a l e c t s , t h e r e is a d i s t i n c t i o n between a central group of La Paz d i a l e c t s and those on the p e r i p h e r y of La Paz influence, whether to the n o r t h , s o u t h , or w e s t . (It may be t h a t c e r t a i n d i a l e c t s located in La Paz d e p a r t ment north and east of the capital may also have to be designated as peripheral when more is known about them.) Huancane, a northern dialect sharing a number of features with La P a z , is also peripheral in sharing certain nonLa Paz a t t r i b u t e s with the southern and i n t e r m e d i a t e dialects. (Figure 10-2 distinguishes central from peripheral d i a l e c t s . ) In some c a s e s f e a t u r e s c u t a c r o s s r e g i o n a l l i n e s . For e x a m p l e , M o r o c o m a r c a , in spite of its r e m o t e ness from La P a z , shares with it certain features lacking in other n o r t h e r n and s o u t h e r n d i a l e c t s .

In the f o l l o w i n g s e c t i o n s , f e a t u r e s c h a r a c t e r i s t i c of the northern, southern, and intermediate dialects and of the peripheral as distinguished from the central dialects are l i s t e d a c c o r d i n g to w h e t h e r they o c c u r in all d i a l e c t s in the group or only in some of them and w h e t h e r they involve phonological shapes and morphophonemics, incidence of morphemes, or semantics. When a given feature also occurs in a d i a l e c t o u t s i d e the g r o u p , the name of that dialect is i n d i c a t e d . Peripheral features of limited occurrence are then listed, followed by features occurring in both central and peripheral dialects and t h o s e cutting across regional lines. Finally, cross-dialectal perceptions and attitudes toward Aymara language and culture e n c o u n t e r e d in this study are d e s c r i b e d .

P h o n o l o g i c a l s h a p e s of a few m o r p h e m e s found in southern Aymara dialects are identical to the shapes of

727

t h o s e m o r p h e m e s in the Q u e c h u a spoken in the a r e a , for e x a m p l e / k i n s a / ' t h r e e ' , / r u r a . n a / 'to m a k e ' , ( M o r o c o m a r c a ) , and /-nti/ 'with, by', but such shared items are of minor significance, given the fact that similar shapes of those morphemes and several others are pan-Andean (Hardman, personal communication). Only one instance of a possible o c c u r r e n c e in Aymara of a Quechua suffix was n o t e d , in Calacala (see 7-2.22.11 and footnote 2). The present evidence is that the Aymara spoken by A y m a r a - Q u e c h u a b i l i n g u a l s in a r e a s where Quechua has the g r e a t e r p r e s t i g e , remains remarkably free of Quechua admixture, perhaps b e c a u s e of the d i g l o s s i a m e n t i o n e d in 1 - 1 . 1 .

10-2.3 Intermediate dialects: Calacoa, Sitajara

As indicated above, Calacoa shares the following

features with the northern group: 10-2.11.14, 10-2.11.21,

10-2.11.22, 10-2.12.11, and 10-2.12.12. It shares the

following with the southern group: 10-2.21.31 (the verb

p u g u . fia, not t h e o t h e r s ) and 1 0 - 2 . 2 2 . 1 7 .

Sitajara shares the fol1owing with Calacoa and the

northern group: 10-2.11.22. With the southern group it

shares the features 10-2.21.11, 10-2.21.31 (pugu.fia),

10-2.22.12, and 10-2.22.13.

Calacoa and Sitajara share the following feature

concerning the incidence of a morpheme:

10-2.31

Nonoccurrence of temporal root q"ara (in free

728

or frozen f o r m ) that occurs in all other dialects (but see 10-2.41.21) Other features shared by Calacoa and/or Sitajara are the peripheral features 10-2.21.14, 10-2.41.18, 10-2.41.19, and 10-2.41.21, and the cross-regional features 10-2.51.31 and 10-2.52.

10-2.4 Peripheral (as distinguished from c e n t r a l ) dialects The following features, most of which involve
phonological s h a p e s , do not occur in the two La Paz dialects most thoroughly investigated until now: Compi and Tiahuanaco. They do o c c u r in c e r t a i n other d i a l e c t s a l r e a d y i d e n t i f i e d as northern, southern, or intermediate.

possessives) Southern: Morocomarca

10-2.41.4

Morphosyntax

Peripheral dialects tend to use more different kinds of verb subordination (see 7 - 4 . 2 ) than does La P a z , where the most common verb subordinator is the sentence suffix -xa.

10-2.42

Peripheral features of limited occurrence

Apart from the peripheral features that occur fairly g e n e r a l l y , there are certain f e a t u r e s found in only

732
one or two peripheral dialects and having identical or s i m i l a r r e f l e x e s in p r e s e n t - d a y J a q a r u . Such f e a t u r e s are (1) the v e l a r nasal p h o n e m e , which in Aymara occurs in only two limited areas, Tarata (Peru) and Carangas (Bolivia); (2) the Aymara diminutive noun suffix -cha, which corresponds to the J a q a r u l i m i t a t i v e and occurs in only two Aymara dialects so far investigated, Huancane and Calacoa; and (3) the 4+3 Future allomorph /-tana/ (and its reduced forms /-tan/ and / - t n a / ) , which is identical to the form of the suffix in Jaqaru but p e r s i s t s as an A y m a r a a l l o m o r p h of the 4+3 F suffix in only three d i a l e c t s so far e n c o u n t e r e d , Calacoa (where it is the sole a l l o m o r p h ) and Salinas and Morocomarca (where it v a r i e s , apparently freely, with / - n a n i / , the a l l o m o r p h of 4+3 F found in other Aymara dialects).
In this research certain Aymara variants cited by Bertonio (1603b) were found only in S i t a j a r a , for example /mimilla/ 'girl', /marmi/ 'woman', /-itta/ 2+1 Simple tense, and ama:.na 'to w a n t ' . (Elsewhere the equivalents are / i m i l l a / , / w a r m i / , / - i s t a / , a n d m u n a . fia . ) B e r t o n i o l i s t e d full paradigms of /sa/ and /iri/ forms for what are here called the D-l and D-2 tenses. The present-day dialect having the greatest number of /sa/ and /iri/ forms for the two tenses (some of them different from those cited by Bertonio) is Salinas, which also has other features that mark it as one of the most distinctive Aymara dialects.

(Whether it is the m o s t conservative will require a more careful comparison of Jaqaru, Kawki, and Aymara dialects than is possible here.) Some of the distinctive features of Salinas are the following: (1) Use of only the aspirated form of the noun suffix -t"a ~ -ta 'from, of', and of only the allomorph /-nti/ of the noun suffix -mpi ~ -nti; (2) a vowel harmony rule affecting both vowels of the suffix -iri when it occurs on verb stems ending in /u/; (3) rules obligatorily voicing stops after nasals and the palatal lateral within morphemes and optionally otherwise; and (4) a rule for the obligatory frication of the velar stop before consonants, changing /k/ to /j/. The voicing rule occurs sporadically in certain other d i a l e c t s , and correspondences of /j/ and /k/ occur elsewhere, but the rules are obligatory only in S a l i n a s .

10-2.6 Cross-dialectal perceptions
T h e r e is a general belief among Aymara s p e a k e r s that the 'best' Aymara is spoken in La P a z . Apart from that, Aymara speakers share the common human tendency to prefer their own particular dialect over others. A woman from Oruro indicated that the Aymara spoken in Oruro and La Paz was 1 e g i t i m o , while that of Salinas was tosco (coarse or crude). Speakers from Socca thought Tarata and Sitajara Aymara sounded like baby talk, apparently because of its velar nasals, and found Tarata Aymara 'less developed' than that of the province of Chucuito. They also termed 'archaic' a Sitajara usage dropping initial /11a/ and f o u n d t h e o c c u r r e n c e of i n i t i a l / j i / or /si/ on sa.ria in other dialects 'old-fashioned'. Similar attitudes could probably be elicited elsewhere.
In a d d i t i o n to g e n e r a l l y p r e f e r r i n g their own d i a l e c t , speakers tended to hear the features of that dialect in other dialects, overlooking certain differences until they were pointed out. For e x a m p l e , speakers from La Paz who use only the longer forms of the distancer suffix -wayatended to hear a vowel /a/ in its o c c u r r e n c e s in other d i a l e c t s , such as S o c c a , in which the allomorph /-wa-/ reduces to /w/ before consonant-requiring suffixes. Speakers who usually used /-pini/ independent suffix tended to hear /-puni/ as /-pini/ and vice versa. The native speaker's virtual deafness to nonsignificant differences

736
in detail points up the need for c o l l a b o r a t i v e research by native and non-native speakers in studies of regional and social linguistic variation.
10-2.7 Attitudes toward Aymara language and culture From the evidence of this study it appears that
many Aymara speakers are ambivalent about their language and c u l t u r e . As pointed out by J. Llanque Chana (1974) for Peru, negative attitudes are fostered by an educational system unprepared to deal with language and cultural backgrounds of students whose first language is not Spanish and by the undeniable fact that acquisition of Spanish makes the difference between living an economically and socially marginal existence and entering the mainstream of modern Peruvian life. The same factors prevail in B o l i v i a .
The m o s t n e g a t i v e a t t i t u d e s were f o u n d in Tarata and S i t a j a r a , P e r u . In the f o r m e r , few persons would even admit to knowing Aymara, although eventually one was found from a nearby town who seemed to enjoy speaking (and singing in) the l a n g u a g e . In S i t a j a r a a v e r y a r t i c u l a t e e l d e r l y monolingual woman, obviously a gifted talker, expressed considerable bitterness against A y m a r a , as if its presence in her brain were to blame for her failure to know S p a n i s h . A b i l i n g u a l man in H u a n c a n d , a S e v e n t h Day A d v e n t i s t , expressed the belief that Aymara language and culture were inferior to Spanish and that no useful purpose would be served by teaching people to read and write Aymara.

737
S i m i l a r l y , persons trained by m i s s i o n a r i e s in Bolivia revealed a certain s e l f - d e p r e c a t i o n , as expressed in the e x a m p l e in 9-5: 'We ask you to pardon us because we sometimes make mistakes'. Yapita (1967) noted a tend e n c y to r e j e c t Aymara l a n g u a g e and c u l t u r e in R o s a r i o (province of Pacajes, department of La Paz), a community that had been under Seventh Day Adventist influence since 1919.
Whatever their origin, such negative attitudes do h a v e an e f f e c t . In some c o m m u n i t i e s w h e r e b i l i n g u a l i s m in Spanish and Aymara has existed for decades if not longer, there is now a trend toward eventual d i s a p p e a r a n c e of Aymara, since young people under 20 no longer speak the l a n g u a g e a l t h o u g h some still u n d e r s t a n d i t . In Juli c h i l d r e n 12 and under in a family w h o s e older m e m b e r s were all bilingual neither spoke nor understood the language. In farms on the o u t s k i r t s of Salinas children still use the language when helping grandparents with farm work, but in town they use only S p a n i s h .
N e v e r t h e l e s s , there is also ample evidence of deep a t t a c h m e n t to the Aymara language and pride in Aymara c u l t u r e . A wish to b e l i e v e that Aymara is indeed the equal o f , if not superior t o , Spanish probably contributed to the positive reception given my statement of research p u r p o s e s d u r i n g the c o u r s e of field w o r k . In e x p l a i n i n g those purposes, I alluded to certain basic anthropological

738
and linguistic notions, such as that Aymara is a language, not a 'dialect1; that it possesses a complex grammar, like any other language; that it can be w r i t t e n , read, and used as a medium of communication and instruction; that knowledge of Spanish and Aymara structure facilitates teaching either language to speakers of the other; and similar concepts. With only one or two exceptions, these ideas found a ready acceptance, as if they confirmed already-held assumptions. Certain educated bilinguals are now articulating their cultural h e r i t a g e and seeking out its g u a r d i a n s in o r d e r to reformulate it and bring it to public attention. The work of Yapita and his a s s o c i a t e s in B o l i v i a , and of D . and J . L l a n q u e Chana in P e r u , is in this v e i n .
The most positive attitudes toward Aymara are found in and n e a r the city of La P a z . A l t h o u g h La Paz Aymara is taking in Spanish loanwords at an accelerating rate, speakers revert to less Hispanicized usages when talking to monolinguals or when visiting rural communities. This happens even in the case of c h i l d r e n who attend school in La P a z , use S p a n i s h among t h e m s e l v e s and w i t h other children in the c i t y , but speak Aymara on visits to the Lake Titicaca communities where their parents and grandparents still own and cultivate the land and where Aymara is spoken by all a g e s . Aymara communities where e v e r y o n e is v i r t u a l l y m o n o l i n g u a l r e p o r t e d l y still e x i s t in r e m o t e parts of the d e p a r t m e n t of La P a z . A l t h o u g h

739

some communities may be losing Aymara, natural increase due to p o p u l a t i o n g r o w t h (as noted in the P e r u v i a n c e n s u s of 1972) will offset this at least during the next few g e n e r a t i o n s , and its e x t i n c t i o n is not in s i g h t . The P e r u v i a n g o v e r n m e n t ' s a c t i o n in 1975 d e s i g n a t i n g Quechua an official language on a par with Spanish, to be used i n t e r c h a n g e a b l y with S p a n i s h in e d u c a t i o n , the c o u r t s , and the like, has had repercussions among speakers of o t h e r i n d i g e n o u s l a n g u a g e s in Peru and in B o l i v i a , w h e r e Peruvian developments have considerable influence. Among Aymara speakers the Peruvian action vis-5-vis Quechua has had the effect of fostering rising expectations of a similar designation for Aymara, reinforcing the underlying positive attitudes that exist.

Interpretation of Research Results and Their Implicati ons

In the a b s e n c e of a r c h a e o l o g i c a l or h i s t o r i c a l evidence concerning population movements and trade routes or of a more complete knowledge of existing Aymara d i a l e c t s , i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s of the data analyzed in this study are somewhat speculative and raise more questions than they answer.
The basic division between dialects near Lake Titicaca in the Peruvian department of Puno and the Bolivian d e p a r t m e n t of La Paz and those farther to the

740
south in the Bolivian departments of Oruro and Potosi i m p l i e s a s o c i a l / p o l i t i c a l s p l i t at some time in the p a s t . Such a split would account for the apparent lack of any gradual shading of features from northern to southern d i a l e c t s , a l t h o u g h a d e f i n i t e d e t e r m i n a t i o n in this r e s p e c t m u s t a w a i t f u r t h e r r e s e a r c h in b o r d e r l i n e a r e a s of southern La Paz and northern Oruro d e p a r t m e n t s . Within an a r e a , existing similar usages may be reinforced by trade. The intensive marketing and related travel that occur around Lake Titicaca (Appleby 1976) are obvious to any visitor. Similar movements associated with trade a l s o o c c u r in the s o u t h e r n d i a l e c t a r e a .
The evidence of a split between northern and southern dialects does not disprove Torero's theory (1-2.1) of a probable (gradual?) north to south expansion of Aymara on the a l t i p l a n o , since such an expansion might have taken place before the split, but a simple southward expansion does not account for the dialectal complexities revealed by the present study, such as the existence of (1) c e r t a i n s i m i l a r f e a t u r e s in n o n c o n t i g u o u s areas like Tarata, Peru and Carangas, Bolivia, (2) features linking peripheral as distinguished from central dialects or crossing north-south, center-periphery lines, or (3) features shared by certain Aymara dialects with contemporary Jaqaru and Kawki far to the north. These complexities may be the linguistic reflection of equally

741
complex population movements associated with what Murra (1968 and 1972) has identified as the pan-Andean preoccupation with controlling different ecological floors. Populations speaking different dialects might have been linked in one vertical a r c h i p e l a g o , such as that controlled by the Lupaca in the 16th c e n t u r y ( 1 - 2 . 2 ) . P r e s e n t - d a y differences among the dialects of Moquegua, Tarata, and Juli may reflect d i f f e r e n c e s a l r e a d y e x i s t i n g in a n c i e n t times, since Murra has pointed out that Pacaje colonies were interspersed among those of the Lupaca (Murra 1968: 1 2 3 ) , and t h a t in any c a s e c o l o n i e s w e r e of d i f f e r e n t types, some consisting of subordinated local populations and o t h e r s of g r o u p s b r o u g h t in f r o m the p o l i t i c a l c e n t e r or e l s e w h e r e . S i m i l a r i t i e s in n o n c o n t i g u o u s d i a l e c t s such as Tarata and Carangas may reflect descent from one community some of whose members moved to a different ecological level either voluntarily or as the result of subordination or conquest (Murra 1968:121). The fact that c o n t e m p o r a r y Aymara speakers in Tarata and Carangas are apparently unaware of each others' existence as speakers of dialects sharing certain features lacking elsewhere, and the nature of the similarities themselves, suggest that the separation occurred at an early date, before the Spanish c o n q u e s t . But all remains in the realm of speculation at this point. Certain puzzling similarities between the widely separated dialects of La Paz and

742
Morocomarca may result from more recent contacts, but since the examples for Morocomarca came from only one source, that dialect needs further checking.
A different explanation than that of population movements may account for similarities among dialects distant from La Paz, whether to the north, south, east, or w e s t , and t h e i r d i f f e r e n c e s from d i a l e c t s in or close to the Bolivian capital. Most of the features that distinguish peripheral dialects from those of La Paz are c o n s e r v a t i v e in terms of the l a t t e r . T h a t i s , peripheral features represent a survival of forms or of complex morphophonemic processes that La Paz probably once had but has since lost, such as stop voicing after nasals and other voiced nonstop consonants, complex morphophonemics of possessive suffixes and certain verbal inflectional suffixes, the four-member -ipana subordinating paradigm, and the native Aymara diminutive suffix -cha. The h y p o t h e s i s that La Paz dialects once had such forms or processes is supported by the existence today of certain relics like Tayk.s Mariya (5-3.24.4), Na.nak.n awki (5-3.31.2), and s.ipna (7-4.44), but requires a convincing e x p l a n a t i o n for t h e i r l o s s . In m a n y c a s e s it m a y be a t t r i b u t a b l e to S p a n i s h i n f l u e n c e , a l w a y s s t r o n g e r in the capital city and areas a c c e s s i b l e to it than in remote a r e a s . La Paz dialects conform more closely to Spanish p h o n o t a c t i c s in avoiding stop-nasal or s t o p - f r i c a t i v e

743
c l u s t e r s t h a t r e s u l t in other d i a l e c t s from o p e r a t i o n of the morphophonemic vowel-dropping rules La Paz has lost. La Paz has no a l t e r n a t i o n s of voiced and v o i c e l e s s a l l o p h o n e s of s t o p s ; such a l t e r n a t i o n s do not o c c u r in S p a n i s h , where voiced and voiceless stops are separate phonemes. (La Paz A y m a r a , like other Aymara d i a l e c t s , does have rules for voicing and frication of intervocalic velar stops, but not rules for voicing without frication.) In La Paz A y m a r a the d i m i n u t i v e s u f f i x has been r e p l a c e d by Spanish loans.
Not all innovations fostered by La Paz can be attributed to Spanish influence, of course. An example of a usage that is on the way out because of internal pressures within Aymara is the 4+3 Future allomorph /-tana/(and its reduced variants). Only one contemporary dialect, Calacoa, was found to use it to the exclusion of the allomorph /-nani/ found elsewhere, and only two other dialects, Salinas and Morocomarca, were found to use the / - t a n a / a l l o m o r p h at a l l , in a p p a r e n t l y free variation with /-nani/. Elsewhere only /-hani/ was heard. The shift from /-tana/ to /-nani/ may have arisen from an avoidance of homophony of /-tana/ with (1) the 4+3 Simple tense suffix (although it requires a preceding consonant), (2) 4+3 Remote Direct Knowledge tense allomorphs that occur in certain d i a l e c t s including La P a z , or (3) certain allomorphs of the 3+3 Remote Indirect Knowledge

744
tense. The allomorph /-nani/ may have derived from the nominalizing suffix -ha plus -ni possessor/enumerator which are also used in all d i a l e c t s (but w i t h o u t person reference) to connote (future) obligation, e . g . , sara.na.ni 'going is necessary, one must go'. (Why this homophony should be acceptable while the other is not is evidence for the arbitrariness of language change.)
Whether or not they may now be changing under La Paz i n f l u e n c e , Aymara d i a l e c t s have c h a n g e d in the past and are still changing in a c c o r d a n c e with their own internal processes. Analogous patterning within a dialect accounts for certain idiosyncratic allomorphs such as /-ray/, / - t a y / , and /-y/ in Sitajara for m o r p h e m e s which in other dialects end in /ki/ or /ji/ rather than / y / , and the a l l o m o r p h s of 3+1 and 3+4 p e r s o n / t e n s e s u f f i x e s in J u l i . The future of these and other idiosyncratic features that characterize individual dialects will depend on the extent to which they resist, or yield to, innovations from within and without.
That the dialects of La Paz should be influencing others to change, rather than vice versa, is the logical result of the economic and social power c o n c e n t r a t e d in and near the Bolivian c a p i t a l . The prestige of La Paz is reflected in the general belief that the best Aymara is spoken t h e r e , and this belief p r e d i s p o s e s speakers from other areas to adopt La Paz u s a g e s . A l s o , since

745
speakers of La Paz dialects hold the most positive attitudes toward the Aymara l a n g u a g e , La Paz usages are likely to survive longer than those of places like Salinas, where A y m a r a m a y d i s a p p e a r in the n e x t g e n e r a t i o n . It t h e r e f o r e seems likely that the influence of La Paz Aymara will continue and that it may eventually supplant other more conservative d i a l e c t s . On the other h a n d , it is also possible that positive attitudes toward Aymara emanating from La Paz may encourage a revival of Aymara l o c a l i s m s , t h e r e b y e n g e n d e r i n g a c o n s e r v a t i v e c o u n t e r t r e n d . If remote c o m m u n i t i e s where Aymara is the primary language still exist, they may serve educated bilinguals as a source of renewed 1Aymarization' of their Spanish-influenced A y m a r a . F u r t h e r m o r e , if Peruvian government policies for the development of bilingual education reach implementation, a second center of Aymara prestige might develop in P e r u , perhaps in P u n o .
Should the positive forces prevail, certain factors augur well for the future of the Aymara language as a vehicle of literature and education. Its phonemic uniformity means that it can be written everywhere with the Yapita phonemic alphabet. The velar nasal can easily be symbolized by nju the d i g r a p h used for it in the practical Jaqaru alphabet developed by Hardman and Bautista. No other special letters are necessary, since voicing of stops within m o r p h e m e s is p r e d i c t a b l e in Salinas and

746

voicing is otherwise o p t i o n a l . P e r s o n s i n t e r e s t e d in d e v e l o p i n g A y m a r a l i t e r a t u r e
might do well to recall the lessons of ancient Greece. According to Palmer (1949) each Greek city-state used its own dialect in its public i n s c r i p t i o n s . But apart from this, each literary genre required the use of a particular dialect, not necessarily that of the writer. The epic dialect was a fusion of Aeolic and Ionic elements; choric odes were always written in D o r i c ; iambic and t r o c h a i c poetry w e r e w r i t t e n in I o n i c . S t i l l , c e r t a i n localisms p e r s i s t e d ; Melic poetry was written in the d i a l e c t of Lesbos, and the writings of Corinna of Tanagra were in Boeotian (Palmer 1 9 4 9 : 2 7 1 - 2 ) . T h e r e seems to be no reason why Aymara literature should not develop genres based on local dialects, should its speakers desire to do so. Persons l i t e r a t e in Aymara will d e c i d e .

Directions for Future Research

Future research into Aymara dialects should aim toward the compilation of a linguistic atlas of the language, and soon, lest certain dialects be lost before they are r e c o r d e d . For the reasons cited in 1 0 - 2 . 6 , such an admittedly Utopian task will require the cooperative efforts of Aymara native speakers trained in l i n g u i s t i c field methods as well as of linguists who are native speakers of other languages such as Spanish and Quechua. The

747
research should be coordinated with similar areal studies of Quechua dialects and of other local languages, including Spani sh.
Specific areas already suggested for future research in Bolivia include western Cochabamba d e p a r t m e n t , northern and western P o t o s f , all parts of the departments of La Paz and Oruro (including areas thought to be Quechua speaking, since Aymara and Quechua communities are often i n t e r s p e r s e d ) . The f o l l o w i n g c o m m u n i t i e s in Cantdn T i m u s f , Munecas p r o v i n c e , department of La Paz, were identified as A y m a r a s p e a k i n g in 1973 by a rural s c h o o l t e a c h e r from La Paz:
Sococoni Huancoiro Timusi (hacienda of Jesus Machaca) Ocomblaya There is a sectional school (escuela s e c c i o n a l ) in H u a n c o i r o . In Peru linguistic surveys should be undertaken in the a r e a s i d e n t i f i e d as A y m a r a s p e a k i n g in the P e r u v i a n census of 1 9 7 2 , and these should be coordinated with the search for surviving relics of other Jaqi languages along the ancient trails of the southern Peruvian Andes, from Arequipa north through the departments of Ayacucho, Huancavelica , Lima, and Junfn. Investigation should also be extended into Aymaraspeaking areas of Chile.

748
In f u t u r e f i e l d w o r k a special e f f o r t s h o u l d be made to obtain more data from monolingual speakers and to determine whether or not monolingual communities or c o m m u n i t i e s bilingual in Quechua and Aymara but w i t h o u t knowledge of Spanish exist.
In a d d i t i o n to the c o l l e c t i o n of f i e l d d a t a , w r i t t e n s o u r c e s in l i b r a r i e s and p r i v a t e c o l l e c t i o n s should be cons u l t e d , such as m a t e r i a l s on A y m a r a r e p o r t e d l y in the U n i v e r s i d a d N a c i o n a l de San A g u s t i n in La Paz and c o l o n i a l documents cited by Rivet, especially the works of Bertonio and Torres Rubio. These, together with sources of M i s s i o n a r y and Patron A y m a r a m e n t i o n e d in 2 - 4 . 1 1 , should be analyzed with the participation of native Aymara-speaking linguists, annotated, and made available to the Aymara communi ty.
As for Aymara grammar itself, the following are suggestions of areas needing further study.
Phono!ogy: I n c i d e n c e of t h e v e l a r n a s a l in o t h e r d i a l e c t s Incidence of aspiration and glottalization (are they d e c r e a s i n g in some d i a l e c t s ? ) Intonation

Additional investigation may be undertaken into m a t t e r s of style in the n a r r a t i v e , o r a t o r y , p r a y e r , and

750
poetry and the uses of politeness, irony, and metaphor. Studies of the speech of different social groups (e.g. women, men, young people, the elderly), of bilingualism and monolingualism, of language acquisition, and all the other proliferating subfields of contemporary linguistics may also be conducted.
Whether or not such studies as these will be undertaken for Aymara in the foreseeable future depends on many interrelated factors, such as the priorities set by governments and scholarly institutions, the extent to which linguists p a r t i c i p a t e in the setting of such p r i o r i t i e s , and most important, the interest of Aymara speakers themselves in f o s t e r i n g the use of Aymara as a vehicle of written literature and education. Only if such interest continues to grow will Aymara linguistics attract the support it needs to develop its potential.

In S i t a j a r a t a t a ! a and m a m a ! a are said to be used to refer to people from the highlands (department of Puno).
Apart from tata and mama, the most common greetings are probably Aymarized forms of the Spanish Buenos dias ('good morning') and Buenas tardes ('good afternoon'), like the following:

785

Winus ti.yus. (La Paz/Compi) Winas tartis. (La Paz/Compi) Waynus tiyas. (Sitajara) Waynas tartis. (Sitajara)

An unusual greeting and reply apparently borrowed from 16th c e n t u r y Spanish persist in C a l a c o a . The original Spanish was identified for me by a native speaker of Spanish from M o q u e g u a , who said the full reply would be Sin pecado concebida ('conceived without sin').

Maraptis. < Spanish Ave Maria Purfsima
Simpikaw. < Spanish sin pecado 'without sin'
In s e v e r a l p l a c e s A y m a r a g r e e t i n g s said to be a r c h a i c and no longer in use w e r e e l i c i t e d . In one case a verb with 2+3 F appears to be reduced from 3+2 and to represent a kind of frozen contraction or e l l i p s i s , as the m e a n i n g is w h a t it would be if the i n f l e c t i o n were 3+2 F.

Common Expressions

A list of common e x p r e s s i o n s for La Paz (Compi and Tiahuanaco) was given at the beginning of the elicitation list in A p p e n d i x A . The e x p r e s s i o n s will be repeated here with analysis for comparison with similar expressions from other dialects.
A number of the expressions contain vowel length v e r b a l i z a t i o n (see 5 - 3 . 4 1 . 2 ) which does not appear in the transcription because the verbalization is followed by a suffix that requires a preceding consonant, causing the lengthened vowel to reduce to plain vowel. That is,

787

a form that has vowel length verbalization at the morphemic level may not have it at the phonemic level. For example, kawki.n.k.iri.:.ta.sa with vowel length verbalization before the inflectional suffix 2+3 S / - c t a / , is phon e m i c a l l y / k a w k i n k i r i t a s a / and therefore so w r i t t e n . If there were no vowel length verbalization, the form would be */kawkinkirtasa/, which does not occur.
It should also be noted that several homophonous suffixes occur in the expressions: -ta ~ -t"a 'from, of' (5-3.31.4), -ta ~ -t"a 1+3 S (6-3.31), ^ta 2+3 S (6-3.31), and -ta nominalizer ( 7 - 4 . 2 1 . 3 ) . In the following examples the verbal inflections are identified; the others are identifiable by context and gloss.

APPENDIX D REGIONAL VERSIONS OF A SAYING AND A RIDDLE

AD-1

Unjana Saying: 'See before you say.'

This sayi n g , whi ch i11ustrates the di rect/i ndi rect knowledge p o s t u l a t e (8-2.3) and variation in usage of the subordinating suffixes -sa and -sina (and variants) ( 7 - 4 . 2 2 . 1 ) , was elicited in all dialects investigated except Calacoa and S i t a j a r a . (Is is interesting to note that the saying does not o c c u r in Jaqaru e i t h e r , according to Hardman [personal communication].) The different versions obtained are grouped regionally below. There is some variation within as well as across d i a l e c t s , but the meaning is always almost identical. The verb sa. ha that occurs in the saying is an o b l i g a t o r y . It may be translated variously as 'one must say', 'must be s a i d ' , 'it is necessary to s a y ' , or 'is to be s a i d ' . I have arbitrarily opted for 'one must say'.

Spindle Riddle

No attempt was made to elicit this riddle everywhere, but it occurred spontaneously with great frequency. It is probably general to all d i a l e c t s . Like the unj aha saying, it illustrates different usages of -sa and -sina (and variants). The riddle shows more stylistic variation than does the saying.
