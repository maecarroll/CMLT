ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This dissertation could not have been done without the many people who in one way or another gave me their support. First and foremost my husband Christian who has been a source of motivation and encouragement throughout this journey. Also, our daughter Zoe who was embarked in this journey later on and was always cheerful no matter what. A special recognition goes to my parents and specially mother who has offered support in so many different ways that I cannot see myself having accomplished even half of what I have done without her. Gracias! My committee was also a source of advice and support. Jane Hill always had valuable suggestions and advice, especially when there were issues that needed adjustment and change. Mike Hammond provided valuable insights and always pushed me to pursue what I thought was important regardless of the academic value. Heidi Harley granted the much needed linguistic theoretical balance in planning the data acquisition and analyzing the corpus. Ofelia Zepeda always reminded me to not loose sight of the speakers and their own interests and needs. Finally, though not an official part of the committee due to unforeseen circumstances for the defense, Susan Philips offered valuable methodological and theoretical insights that complemented the rest of the committee and that enriched this dissertation. To all of them a big thank you. My graduate studies and this dissertation would not have been possible without the financial support granted by different agencies and sponsors at different times. A Fulbright fellowship funded my first two years of graduate studies (1999-2001). Funding from the University of Arizona’s Joint Anthropology and Linguistics PhD Program helped fund the rest of my graduate studies as well as the fieldtrips taken. The Tinker Foundation partially funded the fieldtrip taken in the summer of 2000. The University of Arizona’s Social and Behavioral Sciences Research Institute (SBSRI) granted a predoctoral and a doctoral grant which partially funded fieldtrips and research expenses in the summer of 2001 and all of 2004 respectively. A Dissertation Improvement grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF BCS-0318762) also contributed to my fieldtrip and research expenses for 2004. In Venezuela I am most grateful to the people of Victorino, Pavoni, La Esperanza and Saron. They were willing to have me there with them forever asking questions. They welcomed me and my family into their lives and homes. I also found a second “institutional home” at the Centro Amazónico para la Investigación y el Control de Enfermedades Tropicales “Simón Bolívar” (CAICET) during 2004. They provided a group of researchers with whom to share my ideas and experiences that proved to be an invaluable support. Thank you Magda, Gregorio, José Antonio, Jeyni, Johanna and the rest of the personnel. I am also indebted to my undergraduate professor and mentor María Eugenia Villalón who encouraged me to work on Indigenous Languages and has been a source of inspiration throughout my graduate studies as well. Finally, to my fellow graduate students: my cohort in the ANLI program, Heidi and Luis with whom I shared many of the trials, tribulations and rewards of this program; Meghan, Dan and Shannon who were part of the dissertation group that kept me on track; Stacey for pep talks; and Kiki for encouragement: thank you!

ABSTRACT
This dissertation deals with language documentation from a theoretical and practical perspective. Alongside a theoretical discussion of language documentation, I present my own language documentation project carried out among the Kurripako of Venezuela. What is language documentation? How should it be carried out? And what does it include? These are some of the questions that I address in this dissertation through the analysis of my own project.
I argue that language documentation is a multipurpose, data-driven gathering of records of a language that should take into account the needs of various interested parties such as researchers and community members. In this way, the needs and desires of many should be taken into account in the planning and execution of such a project.
I provide examples of those different parts by looking at my project among the Kurripako. In this sense, each chapter addresses a different part of a project. Chapter 2 addresses theoretical and pragmatic issues. Chapter 3 addresses information about the language, its speakers, dialect variation and a grammatical sketch. Chapter 4 examines argument marking structure in depth and concludes that Kurripako is an active-stative language. Chapter 5 examines the active-stative split in texts and argues that text collection needs to be complemented by elicitation in order to be able to fully address grammatical aspects. Chapter 6 provides information on the context of the project and explains the interests that speakers had in collecting particular types of texts. I finalize by arguing that there needs to be much more work on the theory of language documentation

10
as well as evaluations of these theoretical proposals in order to serve all needs that language documentation wishes to.
I do not intend to present my language documentation project as an exemplar of how language documentation should be done, but merely use it to reflect upon issues that such a project raises. There more questions that came to light and that remain to be answered than issues that have been provided with an answer. It is my hope that this will also encourage others to tackle some of these questions.

11
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION This dissertation is an ethnographic account at several levels. First, it describes preliminary results of my language documentation project among the Kurripako of Venezuela. In this sense, it is a partial ethnography of a language. Second, it is ethnographic in that the project involved a dialectic relationship between myself and the community of speakers with whom I was working. They led me to adjust the project several different times, not only with their requests for me to record particular activities but also by their actions (or more accurately, lack of action; that is by particular collaborators becoming unavailable). It also reflects the use of ethnographic methods throughout the period of my fieldwork. I not only recorded and analyzed segments of speech, I also took part in many of the activities of their daily lives and tried to understand the use of their language from their particular point of view. The ethnographic thread is one that weaves in and out of all the chapters of the dissertation. This dissertation is also about language documentation at different levels. It is an exploration of the field of language documentation theoretically and practically and this is reflected in the organization of the dissertation. Theoretically, I look at how this field has come about, what it means to document a language, what are the proposals concerning language documentation and give background information about my own language documentation project among the Kurripako of Venezuela. All of this is presented in chapter 2. The rest of the organization reflects the different components that a language documentation may have.

12
Chapter 3 is provides what is generally considered the first step in language documentation (though depending on the state of the study of the language, some of the information may not be available before the documentation is carried out). Here I present some basic information on the Kurripako language and its speaker based on bibliographic information as well as some results from the various fieldtrips that I have carried out. There is background information on who the Kurripako are ethnographically, as well as on their language. The language is classified genetically and the variation in name is described in so far as it affects the historical classification of this language and its dialects. Because the issue of the dialects in this language is not clear, some time is dedicated to exploring the different dialect boundaries that have been proposed and an ethnographic solution is suggested. This solution is then tested in a cognate density analysis and a tentative family tree is suggested. There is also a review of the material available for this group and its language as well as a brief grammatical sketch. Finally, for ease of understanding the data presented, the orthography used and its phonetic correlates are presented.
Chapter 4 presents an example of a grammatical description of one aspect of the Kurripako language. The grammatical aspect selected to be described is the argument marking structure. This particular aspect was selected for two reasons: typological and textual. Typologically, the argument marking structure of Kurripako, identified as Active-Stative, is not a very common one. Therefore any data that can be offered provides a valuable contribution. Second, this is a grammatical system that lends itself

13
well to observation in texts and what can be gained by applying the grammatical analysis to different kinds of texts. This is the goal of the next chapter.
Chapter 5 analyzes three texts in relation to argument marking. The three texts were selected for two reasons. They are of different genres, a song, a story and a speech, and they were recorded at the urging of a community member. Therefore, the interest in these texts rose from the community members while at the same time they can be used to fulfill interests particular to the researcher. In this way, I wish to highlight how the documentation endeavor must intersect both the researcher’s and the community’s interest.
Chapter 6 then goes on to explain why these texts were of interest to the community members. The explanations are sought within an anthropological framework in which the context of the lives of the Kurripako are explored. Among the different factors to be taken into account are the evangelization process, the Venezuelan context after 1999, the Bolivarian schools and issues of indigenous identity and authenticity. This chapter places the Kurripako speakers within the wider context of the nation-state and explains some of their interest as a response to their insertion in the multiethnic, pluricultural state. These are also issues that a documentation project should pay attention to since this wider context affects documentation as well.

CHAPTER 2 LANGUAGE DOCUMENTATION
2.1 Introduction This chapter presents a general overview of language documentation and my
language documentation project. Section 2.2 provides a brief history of how language documentation came to be a preoccupation of linguists in the last twenty years and its link to issues of language endangerment. I look at the major sources of funding for documentation projects to explore the definition of language documentation. Section 2.3 then describes the theoretical foundations of language documentation and the field of Documentary Linguistics. Section 2.4 presents an overview of my language documentation project in light of the theoretical concerns posed by Documentary Linguistics as well as highlighting some of the limitations of my project.
2.2 Language Documentation Language documentation is an activity that has surged in the last 15 years with the
increased awareness of language endangerment. It is undoubtedly the current situation of minority languages around the world that has called attention, and even given birth, to the activity of language documentation. This first came to American linguists’ attention in 1991 at a Symposium organized at the Annual Linguistic Society of America (LSA) meeting. It is from this symposium that a series of articles dedicated to Endangered Languages was published in Language in 1992 (Craig 1992; England 1992; Hale 1992a;

15
Hale 1992b; Jeanne 1992; Krauss 1992; Watahomigie and Yamamoto 1992) whose main purpose was the call to action on many different fronts. In this same year, the LSA formed the Committee for Endangered Languages and their Preservation.
It was Krauss (1992) who first projected that more than half of the world’s 5,0006,000 languages would disappear by the end of the 21st century unless something was done; a text that has become so well known and has circulated so much that it is now not even cited in the popular press. Yet, these articles were not about language documentation per se, but rather about the relevance of linguistics and linguists faced with this situation. This can be best expressed by Krauss’ (1992:10) urging “… we must do some serious rethinking of our priorities, lest linguistics go down in history as the only science that presided obliviously over the disappearance of 90% of the very field to which it is dedicated.”
It is in this very same article that the issue of documentation arises. Krauss sets up an agenda of what must be done and sadly, almost fifteen years later, much of it still remains unaddressed. He suggests that first, there needs to be adequate information on the conditions of the languages of the world; second, documentation must be carried out before these languages disappear; a network of repositories and centers for safeguarding and using this documentation must be created; and finally work must be done in areas of education, culture and politics to increase the chances of survival of those languages that are not deemed to be moribund. It is important to note here that there is no consensus on the labels used for describing the conditions of the languages (such as threatened, endangered, moribund, dormant, extinct and others) each author generally providing a

16
definition for each of the labels that s/he employs1. While this is an important issue, it is beyond the scope of this dissertation.
Krauss (1992:8) defines documentation as a grammar, a lexicon and a collection of texts and adds audio and videotape to it. He claims that this is a tradition that has been well proven in the history of linguistics. This can be traced back to Boas in the tradition of American Anthropology and his ideas of salvage ethnography, also carried out in times in which groups were thought to be disappearing in a short period of time and therefore as much cultural knowledge, including linguistic knowledge, had to be gathered as soon as possible. Yet, there is no consensus on what documentation really is. In order to exemplify this, I look at three major sources of funding for language documentation projects and what each one of them expects from their grantees. The funding sources, in chronological order of their establishment, are: Documenting Endangered Languages from the Volkswagen Stiftung in Germany (henceforth DOBES) since 2000, Endangered Languages Documentation Project from the Hans Rausing Foundation in England (henceforth ELDP) since 2003 and Documenting Endangered Languages from the National Science Foundation and National Endowment for the Humanities in the USA (henceforth DEL) since 2004.
According to the DOBES information for applicants (VolkswagenStiftung 2005) available at http://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/fileadmin/downloads/merkblaetter/MB_67_e.pdf
1 Krauss (1992) defines “moribund languages” as those that are no longer being learned as mother-tongue by children and “endangered” as those that are still being learned by children but will cease to be learned in this century if the present conditions continue.

17
“Every documentation project should collect, process and archive linguistic and cultural data for (at least) one endangered language lacking sufficient documentation.” They define a language as endangered when it is no longer being used in public especially for political and economic reasons. It is required that every documentation project be a corpus of primary data representing as many different texts as possible. The texts are to be presented on digital media containing the audio or video recording and a transcription, a translation and explanatory comments on the speech situation and of the recording and its content. They also recommend that every set of language documentation materials be accompanied by a brief linguistic description of the language at issue with regard to its probable genetic affiliation and an outline of the social and historic situation of the language and its speech community. They also recommend that the documentation encompass an outline of the phonetic system and a description of the transcription convention. As a somewhat secondary function, they state that “the documentation project should, if possible, be used to transfer basic linguistic knowledge to the speech communities and help them to develop schooling material etc.” In short, to the DOBES, documentation should be characterized by three key terms: data orientation, multifunctionality and general accessibility.
The ELDP (2006) in contrast, maintains what can be considered a more traditional approach to language documentation. They define documenting a language as “… a complex process that involves finding speakers (…) and then working together with them to study the language and its use. (…) The result of this kind of documentation is often a dictionary and a grammar of the language. In addition, we aim to collect ‘texts’,

18
that is stories, narratives, personal histories, explanation of how culturally important
activities are carried out, speeches and other literary forms, including poetry and songs.”
This material would need to be transcribed, analyzed and translated into a language of
wider communication so the materials can be used for a range of purposes. It is their goal
that documentation projects should contain a range of linguistic materials such as: spoken
language, written texts, relevant sociological and cultural information, dictionary,
thesaurus, pedagogical materials and grammar.
Finally, the DEL initiative gives priority to projects that involve actually
recording in digital audio and video format endangered languages before they become
extinct but they also accept projects that include one or more of the following activities
(DEL 2004):
“ 1. conduct fieldwork to record in digital audio and video format one or more endangered languages; 2. carry out later stages of documentation including the preparation of lexicons, grammars, text samples and databases; 3. digitize and otherwise preserve and provide wider access to such documentary materials, including previously collected materials and those concerned with languages which have recently died and are related to current languages; 4. further develop standards and databases to make this documentation widely available in consistent, archivable, interoperable and Web-based format; 5. conduct initial analysis of findings in light of current linguistic theory; 6. train native speakers in descriptive linguistics; 7. create infrastructure, including workshops, to make the problem of endangered languages more widely understood and more effectively addressed. “
From these examples, two different ideas of language documentation emerge: one
that is based primarily on a collection of texts and another that prioritizes the production
of a grammar and a dictionary along with other types of materials. Both of these ideas
include an extensive amount of fieldwork and the necessary collaboration of native
speakers . These are ideas that have been developed by Himmelmann (1998; 2006) and

19
Woodbury (2003) who have been the major scholars concerned with a theoretical account of what language documentation is and should entail.
2.3 Documentary Linguistics Himmelmann (1998; 2006) urges linguists to differentiate between the fields of
Documentary Linguistics and Descriptive Linguistics, and while descriptive work in many ways is based on documentary work, documentation in his view must not aim to produce descriptive works in the traditional sense of a grammar, a dictionary and a collection of texts. In this case the collection of texts, as Woodbury (2003) argues, was just what is necessary to permit verification of the analysis. Himmelmann’s arguments are convincing, in that the basic assumption of descriptive work—approaching language as an abstract system of rules and oppositions—is not a useful target for documentation projects since it leaves non-linguist users of these works with very little that is accessible and useful to them. This leads us to ask what the target of documentation is. Unless we have a clear answer to this, we cannot develop the aims and goals of documentation and what a documentation should look like. Austin (2003) points out there is a considerable gap in the intellectualizing and theorizing of this area of research and practice and that it is necessary to do so in order to truly engage in productive endeavors.
Since documentation is intimately linked to the situation of language endangerment in the world today, it is in this context that we must ask what documentation is and what are its uses. It is only by understanding the uses of such endeavor that its content and structure will become clear. This creates a problem,

20
because there may be as many specific uses as there may be potential users, and there may even be uses that we cannot fathom at the moment. So how do we deal with this uncertainty? The only way is to think of language documentation in the broadest possible way with the most possible uses, of which language maintenance and revitalization is but one of them. I concur with Himmelmann (2006:1) when he states that “…a language documentation is a lasting, multipurpose record of a language.” In this sense a language documentation must try to encompass as varied and as much data as possible to serve as many interests as possible, understanding that in the future these records may be all that is left of a language that is still spoken today. How can this be achieved?
Himmelmann proposes that there should be two primary components of language documentation: the Primary Data and the Apparatus. Every documentation project will need to make decisions regarding these two areas yet they will be specific to the context of the language or languages in questions. The apparatus includes metadata (for each record and for the whole documentation project) and annotations and commentary (transcription, translation, further linguistic and ethnographic glossing and commentary); while the primary data includes recordings of observable linguistic behavior (communicative events) and metalinguistic knowledge. Furthermore, every aspect of language documentation should be publicly available, with the exception of certain materials that may have access restrictions imposed by the community of speakers themselves. When this is not possible, then language documentation should not be carried out.

21
There are many choices to be made regarding the apparatus of the documentation, most of them practical ones such as the type of equipment to be used, the tools for transcribing, translating and annotating, and formats and places for archiving. Many of these will depend on the resources available to the researcher, not only financial resources but also infrastructural resources. There is a myriad of factors to be taken into account and many of them are addressed in E-MELD’s (Electronic Metastructure for Endangered Language Data) webpage of school of best practices (http://emeld.org/school/index.html ). These best practices cover all aspects of digitizing and archiving language documentation, including how to record it, annotate it, catalogue it, store it, and display it in such a way as to respect the intellectual property rights of stakeholders. There is no one right way to do it, but there are many wrong ways that would jeopardize the longevity of the documentation.
There are practical constraints as to the selection and kinds of primary data that can be gathered and there is a real need for theoretical developments that may guide that selection. Himmelmann (1998) has suggested that the parameter of spontaneity in the sense of Ochs (1979) is one that might be useful in setting a typology of communicative events. Using this parameter, five major types of language usage can be placed within a continuum: spontaneous, uncontrolled exclamations; directives; conversations; monologues; ritual speech events. This parameter should be complemented with the parameter of modality that identifies three major single types—signing, speaking and writing—and two cross modal types—speaking/signing, speaking/writing. This would provide a typology of speech events that may guide the acquisition of primary data

22
understanding that a given communicative event may contain segments belonging to different types; that spontaneity correlates with aspects of linguistic structure; and that different modalities are a language specific parameter. This is but one proposal, one that must be tested out in the field in order to prove its usefulness. I will address the usefulness of this proposal in chapter 5 when I look at my texts.
As to the best ways of collecting metalinguistic knowledge, Himmelmann argues that this is best observable in interactions between the native speakers and the researchers/documenters. Metalinguistic knowledge should not only include much of the basic information needed to write a descriptive grammar and a dictionary but should also include negative evidence, as for example illicit structures. This of course presupposes grammatical analysis, which is not excluded from language documentation since it is necessary to guide data acquisition and also to make certain choices such as an orthography, transcription, glossing and others. What must be kept in mind is that grammatical analysis is not to be the main outcome of language documentation.
That said, I believe that given the nature of the discipline of Linguistics today, any documentation project entails a grammatical description of some sort; but it is necessary to establish guidelines for the grammatical description to be provided. I believe that what is most useful is to limit the description to a presentation of data in a typological framework and to not tie it to a particular theoretical perspective. This has been proposed by R.M.W. Dixon as framing grammars in Basic Linguistic Theory (BLT) so that they can be useful for many years and to many users. Examples of this type of grammar can be seen in some of his works such as Dixon (1977; 1988).

23
Given this definition of documentation and its components, we see that this in line with the projects funded by DOBES (which is not surprising given that Himmelmann is German and has probably influenced the developments within this foundation) whereas ELDP seems to subscribe more towards the traditional definition of documentation as described by Krauss (1992) which includes description as one of its fundamental outcomes. DEL, in contrast is a much wider program that seeks to fund not only documentation in Himmelmann’s view but also analysis of data from endangered languages and development of the apparatus.
What is my view of language documentation? I believe in Himmelmann’s proposal but I also believe that given the nature of Linguistics now it is practically impossible to carry out exclusively documentary work and be able to support a career in the field of Linguistics. I do believe that Documentary Linguistics needs to be established as a field in its own right but for that to happen there must be a paradigmatic change in the constitution of Linguistics as a discipline. First, linguists as a whole must recognize the role of documentation within the discipline and must accept this as a viable career path. There must be specific training in documentation just as there is in many other (sub)specializations within linguistics. What this training should entail I will address later on. There must also be venues for presenting and publishing work within this field that can be recognized for the advancement of the career of linguists in this area. And last but not least, there must be significant support for teaching and research in this area. There have been fragmented and small initiatives in some of these areas, but a comprehensive, paradigmatic change that will ensure the documentation for all the

24
languages that are deemed to be in danger has not been achieved. Until then, linguists interested in this area of endeavor have no choice but to also dedicate themselves to other linguistic endeavors that will prove more useful in their careers; one of the inevitable consequences is to dedicate an equivalent (and sometimes more) time to descriptive and theoretical analysis using the data gathered while documenting. While this might seem as undesirable in the framework proposed by Himmelmann (1998; 2006), I believe that apart from the time that this takes out from the documentation project as such, many times the most qualified individual to write a description of the language is the documenter that has spent so much time pouring over texts transcribing and translating them as well as recording metalinguistic knowledge with the aid of the native speakers. Undoubtedly, documenters are much more familiarized with the language than any other linguist who would use the documentation materials to work on a description and the documenters would have insights into the data that would more easily answer questions of a descriptive or theoretical nature. That being said, there are also practical limitations as to the work that one researcher can achieve during his/her lifetime.
There has been some advancement in these areas. For example, there are now two publications dedicated exclusively to issues of language documentation under the auspices of two of the major funding agencies. The Language Archives Newsletter (LAN http://www.mpi.nl/LAN/), which began under the auspices of DOBES in 2004, provides news and informative articles about topics in endangered languages, especially archiving, fieldwork, language documentation, data and media management, computer tools, and developments in relevant technologies; while ELDP publishes its working papers under

25
the series titled Language Documentation and Description (Austin 2003b; Austin 2004; Austin 2005) These are sources of invaluable information in an area characterized by the scarcity of sources.
The School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, where ELDP is based, also hosts the only graduate program dedicated exclusively to documentation: an MA in Language Documentation and Description. This program includes core courses in Issues in Language Documentation and Description, Field methods, Technology, and Applied Language Documentation and Description. More recently the program at the University of Texas-Austin offers a concentration on Documentary and Descriptive Linguistics which prepares students to collect and analyze new data on previously under-studied languages, and to prepare grammars, dictionaries, text collections and other descriptive materials that contribute to their full documentation. There are other programs that are related to documentation such as University of Arizona’s MA in Native American Linguistics which is designed to train members of Native American communities to do descriptive research on their languages, and to prepare for academic careers in teaching these languages and related fields; the American Indian Language Development Institute at the University of Arizona (AILDI) in which participants will acquire skills and learn methods for incorporating appropriate linguistic and cultural knowledge into the school curriculum, and will also learn general linguistic investigation skills applicable at the community level; and but none whose main focus is the training of language documenters; the University of New Mexico’s Linguistic Department also offers a concentration on Native American linguistics but none of these

26
programs are exclusively dedicated to documentation. I believe that there is a need for documenters to be trained specifically for this task above and beyond the brief training that some of the funding agencies provide for their grantees (both DOBES and ELDP provide seminars which are obligatory for their award recipients). Programs like the MA at SOAS must include not only linguistic issues but also ethnographic ones that are essential to the successful outcome of language documentation as Hill (2006) points out.
Various archives have been set up, mainly digital ones, that are available to host many different kinds of records. For example, SOAS also hosts the Endangered Languages Archive and while the ELDP documentation projects results are hosted here, (http://www.hrelp.org/archive/), they also accept deposits from other sources. Likewise, DOBES has an archive at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics accessible through http://www.mpi.nl/DOBES. At the University of Texas, there is the Archive for Indigenous Languages of the Americas (AILA) accessible at http://www.ailla.utexas.org/site/welcome.html; and there is also the Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures (PARADISEC) which offers a facility for digital conservation and access for endangered materials from the Pacific region, defined broadly to include Oceania and East and Southeast Asia. Metadata of all of these archives can be searched through the portal at that Open Languages Archive Community (OLAC http://www.language-archives.org/).
Himmelmann argues that the most important features that modern language documentation has compared to earlier approaches such as those of the philologists or the Boasian tradition are the following: a focus on primary data; a concern for accountability;

27
a concern for long-term storage and preservation of primary data; work in interdisciplinary teams; and close cooperation with/direct involvement of the speech community. Whether this approach is successful and the results of the documentation useful to a multiplicity of users is something that still remains to be seen. Theoretically, the situation presented above is the ideal one but there are many reasons why these are not all feasible for a given documentation project. I will address some of these issues in relation to my own documentation project among the Kurripako.
2.4 Kurripako language documentation My project was originally conceived as the documentation of the Ehe dialect of
the Kurripako language (Arawak family) as it is spoken in Venezuela2. The documentation was to be carried out by lexical, phonological and grammatical elicitation, as well as the collection of naturally occurring speech. The texts collected were to be chosen as representative of a variety of social and cultural contexts in which the language is currently being used. This was going to be carried out during 11 months of fieldwork in Venezuela in the area of Puerto Ayacucho, capital of Amazonas State. This project was partially funded by a National Science Foundation Dissertation Improvement Grant (NSF Grant BCS-0318762) as well as funds from the University of Arizona Social and Behavioral Sciences Research Institute. I had previously done fieldwork in a village in the area of the Guainia for two summers (three months total financed partially by the Tinker Foundation, University of Arizona Social and Behavioral Sciences Research
2 More details about the dialects of Kurripako are given in chapter 2.

28
Institute and University of Arizona Joint Anthropology and Linguistics Research Funds). I worked in Victorino, an evangelical village, by serendipity and though I was not thrilled to be working in an evangelical village because my original interests were in the area of shamanism and gender, once I had established a working relationship I decided to continue working with evangelical Kurripakos due to the lack of knowledge about issues of evangelization and language use among the people of the Amazon. For the dissertation work, I decided to move my fieldsite to the Puerto Ayacucho area given that I would be there for a much extended period of time than before and I would be accompanied by my family (husband and daughter, 11 months old at the beginning of the fieldwork). In Puerto Ayacucho, I was given institutional support by the Centro de Investigaciones Amazónico para el Control de Enfermedades Tropicales “Simón Bolívar” (CAICET) as a visiting graduate student. Local contacts and support are essential for a successful project. This not only provides you with a local network but also with support and camaraderie from other researchers that are working in the area.
The villages where I sought out native speaker collaborators had kinship relations with the village where I had worked before, Victorino. This made it easier to obtain permission and collaboration from these people since they had heard about me and the work I had carried out until then. I approached two villages, La Esperanza and Pavoni and obtained permission to work in both. I was later taken to another village, Saron, by one of the native speaker collaborators. Even though I had envisioned working predominantly on the Ehe dialect, I actually recorded as much material in Aha as I did in Ehe for practical reasons. I also had the opportunity to record some material in the other

29
two dialects (Oho and Ñame) as well, though this is material that remains to be transcribed and translated. In the village of La Esperanza, the village leader assigned me two women roughly my age to serve as collaborators. These women were related to him, his daughter and his niece, and they had been assigned to me by the village in a meeting that had been held to approve my work. I am not aware of the exact politics behind the assignment of these two people as my main collaborators as I was not present at this meeting because the village leader preferred it that way. I had explained my project as one mainly involving the Ehe dialect and wanting to record and learn the language to eventually be able to provide a description and help in bilingual education materials. What this was understood to mean, as made clear from the document that was to serve as proof for my permission to work in this village was that I was going to make a dictionary. These two women were selected, I was told, because of their Spanish and Kurripako skills, both of them being literate in both languages, and because of their availability. The main collaborator was to be the village chief’s daughter and her substitute was his niece. They were both speakers of the Aha dialect, also known as Kurri.
Something quite similar happened in Pavoni. The village chief held a meeting to confer with the village, since he did not have the authority to make a decision without everybody’s approval. In that meeting, he also asked for volunteers to be my collaborators and two men were chosen. These were two brothers from a family that was held in very high esteem by the whole village since their father, now in his eighties, had been one of the founders of the village when they had migrated from Victorino in the early 1970’s (Pavoni was founded in 1972). The other important factor in their

30
volunteering is that they claimed to be “… los propios Ehe, de Victorino”3, therefore being the most appropriate collaborators if I was interested in learning Ehe. One of them also claimed to have worked with a linguist for some time in Colombia and therefore knew about “linguistic work”. I worked on and off with these four collaborators though I also had to seek the help of other people for various reasons.
This highlights the importance of the speech community involvement. Without the support of the village leaders and the collaboration of these volunteers, the work would have been impossible to carry out. Even though I believe that they did not have a very clear idea of what I was doing or the goals of my project, they were always very supportive. In their minds, as evidenced by the way they would explain my project to other people when they were asked, I wanted to learn to speak the language and make a dictionary; and in order to do that I was recording many different people talking about different things particularly related to Kurripako culture and way of life. At the very beginning, the native speaker collaborators would take me around to see certain activities that they thought I should record. We went to their gardens to collect manioc tubers and processed it into manioc bread and cereal (this took several days). We talked to certain “specialists” about their knowledge, good hunters, good fishers, weavers, canoe-makers, the pastors and deacons and recorded “conversations” that were orchestrated by my collaborators (they would ask questions and have the people answer them). This was their idea of what I should be doing and it took a lot of explaining to accept variations from this approach and the first times I tried working on transcribing and translating were
3 The real Ehe, from Victorino.

31
very difficult. One note about the collaborators; those that spent considerable amounts of time away from everyday activities while working with me were remunerated for their work as this was included in the budget of the project. Those that collaborated without disrupting their everyday activities were given tokens of appreciation. At this point I will give some information on the apparatus of the project.
I was recording on a Sony DAT walkman (model TCD-D100) at 48 Khz using DAT tapes. This proved to be the best recording device given the uncertainty of power sources and availability of batteries in the area. I used a multi-directional electret condenser stereo microphone with adjustable pick-up angle compatible with the DAT recorder and recommended by Sony (model ECM-MS907). This compact combination satisfied the necessity of working with AA batteries and being light and small. Even though I had problems before with a previous model when in very high humidity conditions (the DAT recorder would not work, it had to be opened and put to the sun to dry for a little while), I had no problems whatsoever during the whole 11 months. I would then digitize to my laptop using Audacity, a free audio editor and recorder available at http://audacity.sourceforge.net/. Digitized copies of the tapes to work in the field with were made at 16Khz due to memory and storage capacity of the laptop. The recordings were then transcribed using Transcriber (available at http://trans.sourceforge.net/en/presentation.php) a free program for segmenting, labeling and transcribing speech whose output is in XML. At the beginning, I would do a first transcription on my own and then rework it with a native speaker, but I soon found out that this was more time consuming than doing it directly with the native speaker due to

32
all of the mistakes that I was making in segmenting words. These transcription sessions were also recorded using the DAT since a lot of useful metalinguistic knowledge was expressed in these sessions. These transcriber files were then transformed to a text file through a program that Mike Hammond, one of my committee members, wrote for me. This was necessary to work with these files in Shoebox, available from SIL at http://www.sil.org/computing/catalog/show_software.asp?id=26. Once imported into Shoebox, the texts were interlinearized and translated while at the same time a dictionary is being built with some extra work by the program. This analysis and translation was usually carried out on a printout of the text with the help of a native speaker while also listening to the digitized, transcribed text. These sessions were also recorded with the DAT. For accuracy, the translations/analysis were checked with another speaker, though this proved to be too time consuming and had to be abandoned. A database of all of the recordings including date, tape number, speakers, location and general theme was kept in a Microsoft Excel data file as well as a database of all of the speakers recorded. The recordings are in the process of being digitized in archival quality file and metadata written to be deposited in AILA later on. I would have liked to have been able to make video recordings but funding limitations precluded me from getting the video equipment. I was able to borrow a video camera for a short amount of time and there are two tapes recorded, one of vocabulary in both Aha and Ehe with different speakers for articulatory analysis purposes and another of a partial shamanic ritual in Ñame. All in all I recorded approximately 100 hours of audio and 90 min. of video of primarily Aha and Ehe data which includes naturally occurring speech, prompted monologues, prompted

33
conversations, elicitation, and sessions of transcription, translation and grammatical analysis.
Apart from the original four assigned collaborators, others took on main roles at different times throughout the project for several reasons. These collaborators at different times became unavailable because of changing life circumstances. One of the women was unemployed at the beginning of the project and four months later had a fulltime job that left her with no time. Another one started school, as well as her own teaching job and had considerably less time. So, given this changing scenario it was necessary to recruit others that were willing and available to help within their capacities. For example, during the summer vacation a 16-year-old offered to help me transcribe and translate some of the stories that I had collected. He proved to be an excellent worker except for the fact that when I differed from his opinion, he would always defer to me. I quickly learned that he was usually right and I wrong and left those questions to other speakers.
All of this led me to quickly realize that this was not a job that could be realistically achieved in such a short amount of time by only one person. Furthermore, there were many areas in which I felt that I clearly lacked expertise to be able to fully document particular areas of knowledge. For example, I felt completely incompetent in areas of ethnobotany and ethnozoology, particularly when there were no examples nearby to clearly identify the animals and plants that they were talking about. There were times when they didn’t know the names for them in Spanish (if there even was one) or knew regional locutions that I had no idea about. I also wish I was more knowledgeable about

34
processes of language acquisition since I was in a particular personal position in which it was very easy to gain access to situations of this kind. Indeed, many caretakers were willing to take care of my daughter and “teach” her Kurripako. On the other hand, there were also particular kinds of discourse that were very difficult for me to gain access to due to my own personal status: a young married non-evangelical non-indigenous woman. If there had been a team of researchers with varying expertise and personal characteristics, some of these difficulties could have been overcome. A team of interdisciplinary researchers if possible is a better approach.
One hundred plus hours of data may seem like a great amount, and on one hand it is especially considering how much more work needs to be done to finish transcribing, translating and interlinearizing all of this material, but at the same time I realized about halfway through the project that it would be impossible to meet all of the goals in the amount of time that I had. I had envisioned a “Grammar of Kurripako” based on naturally occurring speech and documenting a variety of genres. Some members of my committee thought it more likely to be “Aspects in the Grammar of Kurripako”, but there were other issues that I believed needed to be addressed in this dissertation apart from grammatical ones.
Many of these issues are linked to the relatively new status of the field of Documentary Linguistics and the uncertainty in the circumstances that projects such as this one are carried out in. As pointed out before, there is little theory on which to base documentation and few examples to learn from. Also, the circumstances of every project are so different that it is difficult to extrapolate from them. It is because of this that I

35
decided to look at my own project and reflect upon the many issues that need to be addressed for documentation projects to be successful and useful. I have but outlined a few of them and hope that this may prove fertile ground from which to create more ideas.
This is not a project that ends here, though the immediate funding has. In the future, I hope to be able to continue with this project having learnt from what has already been done. It is with this in mind that I will continue working on Kurripako and its speakers, documenting their language and their culture as it develops in the 21st century. I hope to one day be able to provide them with their vision of my work, a dictionary and a grammar, as well as with any materials that speakers may want help in developing to ensure the maintenance of their language.
2.5 Conclusion Language documentation is a relatively new activity within linguistics even
though the foundations for it are as old as the discipline itself. This activity is intimately linked to issues of language endangerment and the belief that many languages will disappear within the next hundred years without leaving a record from which to study them and be studied by their own people. This is the fundamental impetus in the creation of the field of Documentary Linguistics, a field that needs to be recognized as independent though not exclusive of Descriptive Linguistics. Documentary linguistics is a data-driven collection of records of a language serving multiple purposes and a variety of users in a lasting format. As such, there are many interests and concerns to be able to fully develop a documentation of a language. My own documentation project among

36
Kurripako speakers has led to me to gain valuable insights into the workings, limitations and rewards of such an endeavor. It has become clear to me that documentation is a long-term project that necessitates the incorporation of a multiplicity of agents, researchers and community members alike, in order to be able to meet the interests of every party involved.

CHAPTER 3 THE KURRIPAKO LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERS
3.1 Introduction In this chapter I present a general overview of the Kurripako language. In section
3.2 I first present the geographical location of Kurripako speakers and explain who I am referring to when I use the term Kurripako and their sociolinguistic situation in Venezuela. In section 3.3 I provide information on the family classification of this language and some of the problems faced when trying to identify this language in published sources and the relationship of this to dialectal variation. I also present chronologically the different ways Kurripako has been genetically classified and the current state. Section 3.4 presents a lexico-statistical analysis of four dialects and a proposal of internal classification based on this data. Section 3.5 presents an overview of the literature on Kurripako. Section 3.6 is a brief grammatical characterization of Kurripako within the Arawak language family. Section 3.7 is a note on the orthography that I use throughout this dissertation.
3.2 Who are the Kurripako? Kurripako is an Arawak language spoken in the states of Amazonas and Bolivar in
Venezuela. Kurripako is the name of the language and of the ethnic group as it is used by official documents of Venezuela. It is not, however, the name that the people use for themselves in their own language; they refer to themselves as naiki, which means “people”. They do recognize Kurripako as the name that is used to refer to them in

38 Spanish and by other indigenous groups of Venezuela with which they have no contact. Since this project was carried out in Venezuela, I will refer to this group and its language by the official Venezuelan name: Kurripako. There are seven Arawak languages spoken in Venezuela, which have been traditionally divided into two groups: Northern Arawak which comprises Guajiro (Wayuu) and Añu, and Southern Arawak which comprises Kurripako, Piapoco, Baniva, Bare and Warekena.

39
Kurripako speakers span three countries in the northwest Amazon--Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia-- and total about 10,000. The origin of the Kurripako people in the Rio Negro region and vicinity can be traced back to 1000 to 500 BC when, according to Noble (1965) and Lathrap (1970), there was a second migration of Proto-Arawak people to this area. This geopolitical location and the difficulties in accessibility make the work even more arduous. Because of this situation, it is very important to identify, inasmuch as it is possible, the sociolinguistic variables of the speaker(s) in any work done on any of the varieties of this continuum. It is important to note not just age, gender, and location, but also clan affiliation (if possible, this might not be remembered in some of the evangelical villages) of the speaker and of the parents, self-identification of dialect and of parents (or caretakers), place of birth and places where the speaker has lived for a significant amount of time, particularly as it impacts on sociolinguistic varieties. In sum, it is necessary to have a sociolinguistic history of the speaker available to properly classify the data and for it to be useful for future studies of dialect variation and sociocultural identity.
I carried out my research in two different locations: in the Rio Negro area of Venezuela during the summers of 2000 and 2001, which has been the traditional location for Southern Arawak speakers of Venezuela, and in the vicinity of Puerto Ayacucho in 2004, which is a place of recent relocation for Kurripako speakers (within the last 50 years). The villages in which I collected data were: Victorino, Palomo, La Esperanza and Saron. According to the latest available census (Informática 1993: 32), the total population of Kurripako ethnicity in Venezuela is 2816 individuals. The census also

40

included self-reported information about languages spoken for individuals age 5 and older. Out of the 2368 Kurripakos in this category, 349 speak only Spanish, 207 speak only an Indigenous language (I assume Kurripako), 1809 speak both an Indigenous language and Spanish, 1 speaks an Indigenous language and another, and 2 speak an Indigenous language, Spanish and another language (Informática 1993: 46). This is summarized with percentages in Table 1.

Sociolinguistically, the speakers of Kurripako, and in particular the speakers of Ehe, are shifting to Spanish. There are very few monolingual speakers of the language (all in the oldest generation) and the youngest generation is about 50% Kurripako-dominant and 50% Spanish-dominant, with some monolingual Spanish speakers. These percentages vary greatly depending on geographical location, because children in more isolated, smaller villages tend to be more Kurripako-dominant, while those closer to the larger, more urban areas tend to be more Spanish-dominant. The language is still being transmitted to the younger generation, particularly in the more rural areas and among the evangelized population.

41
There is no doubt that Kurripako is a minority language, although it is officially recognized by Venezuela’s new constitution (1999) as the official language in the place(s) in which it is spoken. It is supposed to be used in bilingual education in Kurripako villages, but lack of materials and trained teachers, and linguistic ideology prevent this from happening. Contexts of use of Kurripako in the villages are starting to become restricted and Spanish is starting to dominate in the religious and political arenas. There is some use of Kurripako in government pamphlets, particularly those related to health issues; however Kurripako is not used in any other media.
3.3 Linguistic Classification and Dialectal Variation The Arawak language family is geographically one of the most extensive in Central
and South America, ranging from Central America to Paraguay. The Arawak family was first proposed by Father Filipo Gilij in 1783 (1965) based on a comparison of pronominal prefixes of Maipure, a language that was spoken in Venezuela, and Moxo from Bolivia. The language family was initially called Maipurean and later was renamed Arawak after one of the most studied languages of the family, Arawak (aka Lokono). Among South American scholars, Maipurean (or Maipuran) is used for the Northern Arawak languages that are closely related and the term Arawak defines the language family. Some North American scholars (for example Greenberg 1960, Noble 1965, Key 1979, Payne 1991) use Arawak(an) for a much larger hypothetically related group of languages. Following

42
South American scholars, I use the term Arawak to refer to the group of unquestionably related languages
The classification of Kurripako as Arawak is not contested, though there are differences among scholars as to its place in the internal classification of the family. Before I address the internal language classifications proposed, it is important to address the issue of language name variation because this is a factor in the different classifications.
Lizarralde (1993: 73-74) under the entry for Kurripako lists 99 different terms for this ethnolinguistic group attested in printed sources. Some of these terms are clearly orthographic varieties of the same word such as: Coripaco, Curipaco, Curripaco, Curripako, Koripág, Koripáka, Koripáko, Kuripaka, Kuripáka, Kuripako, Kurripako, Kurupako. Others are names for some of the clans4 of this group in their own language such as Aini-dakenai (Grandchildren of the Wasps), Hohodeni (People of the Forest Chicken), Dzawí-minanei (Masters of the Jaguar), Walipéri-dakenai (Grandchildren of the Pleiades). Others are names for the clans in other languages, many of them from Nheengatú which can be identified by the term tapuya which means “people”. Examples of these are: Tapiíra-tapúya (Tapir-people), Kawa-tapuya (Wasp-people), Sukuriyutapuya (Anaconda-people), Kuati-tapuya (Coati-people). Other names refer to the words for yes and no in various dialects such as: Carom, Curricarro, Eh-hen, Kurrim, Ñame, Oh-hon. In Table 2, I have compiled a list of all the names included in Lizarralde (1993) and grouped together the names that refer to the same group. The information for this
4 Clans are patrilinieal and organized into endogamous sibs.

43

grouping has come from a variety of sources: Robin Wright (2005 pc) and Raynice Silva (2005 pc) translated most of the Nheengatu names into English and Kurripako; Journet (1995) lists some of the clan names and some of the Nheengatu names along with a French translation in a glossary; the web page of Museu Do Indio5 also has much information about name varieties of Brazilian groups; orthographic variations were grouped according to the knowledge I have as to the different ways in which Kurripako names have been written by different authors. I have further tried to classify them according to the semantic nature of the name into 4 groups: clan names, names that refer to the words for yes/no, names that refer to places, and exonyms and autonyms. I present the names in alphabetical order, placing first the Kurripako name in the cases where there is both a Kurripako and a name in another language

46

geographical locations which in turn represent particular dialects. He does not provide exhaustive information as to which clans are considered the main residents of which areas. Journet specifically stresses, though, that dialect is more a consequence of place of residence rather than a badge of clan affiliation. He mentions some examples in which newcomers adopt the dialect of the place to which they have moved. In contrast, Ramirez (2001) identifies three “super-dialect” areas. He identifies these as the Central dialect, the Northern dialect and the Southern dialect. He localizes the dialects geographically and identifies some of the clans that are associated with each of these dialects. He further claims that each of these “super-dialects” have further smaller dialectical variations. He also states that there are zones of linguistic tension where you can hear a speech of transition between the central and southern dialects. Aikhenvald (1999) takes another approach to solving the problem of the plethora of names. She refers to all of them with the name Kurripako-Baniwa. Until further descriptive and comparative studies are carried out, it is very difficult to determine the boundaries and characteristics of all of the varieties included in this continuum.

I have decided to take an ethnographic approach to dialect classification. Speakers of Kurripako identify varieties using the words for yes and no as described in Table 3 below.

Table 3. 3 Dialect identification
Yes Aha Ehe Oho Oho

No Kuri Khenim Karo Ñame

47
It is necessary to note that this is far from being a self-identification of dialects. This table would identify four different dialects, yet speakers identify others as being from a particular variant by using either the word for yes or the word for no, sometimes not being fully aware that they are referring to the same variant. Furthermore, speakers would also identify others as speaking a mixture of two of the dialects identified above, as in Curricarro. It is necessary to keep in mind that this is a group that has undergone continuous migration, relocation and social restructuring in the last 100 years due to first the rubber extraction6 and second the influence of evangelization (Wright 1998). This in part explains the coexistence nowadays of various dialects in the same village and in locations that are not their traditional places of residence (such as near Puerto Ayacucho, Venezuela).
3.4 Lexico-statistical Analysis This lexical comparison is based on Swadesh’s 200-basic-word-list with some
minor adaptations due to geographical and cultural differences. The complete list with the data from all four dialects is Appendix A. Some of the words that were not asked for were the words for “ice”, “snow”, “freeze”; these were replaced by “hammock”, “sebucán”7, “conuco”8, “to grate”, “yucuta”9 and “hot yucuta” which were more culturally appropriate. There were other words that had to be taken out of the final list because they were loans from Spanish in at least three dialects such as to sing, five and
6 At the beginign of the 20h century, a rubber extraction system based on debt-peonage was established in this area. This was very violent and led to the resetllment of many indigenous people, the Kurripako included. 7 Artifact used to squeeze the grated manioc to expel the arsenic. 8 The cultivated field with multiple species used for agriculture in the Amazon. 9 Drink made from manioc flour or bread and water.

year. Other words had to be taken out of the list also because of the use of various classifiers which rendered the words incomparable; this was the case of this, that, behind, here and there. The word tiger was also included since it was known beforehand that it contained the [dz]~[j] (transcribed as dz and y respectively) alternation word initially and these sounds are of low frequency. There remained 197 lexical items in the lists.

There is one dividing sound correspondence that is identifiable throughout the four dialects and that is constant. This is the correspondence between [dz] and [j]. Ehe and Oho have [dz] and Aha and Ñame have [j]. Table 3.4 contains all of the words in the lists collected that exhibit this alternation.

It is interesting to note that in the first word, feather, in Aha the [j] has disappeared completely. Due to the phonological inventory, which is presented as Table 3.12 later in this chapter, I believe that [dz] is the conservative phoneme and [j] the innovation. There is also a [ts] fricative which would make the inventory symmetric.
One very intriguing difference is the alternation exhibited by the back vowels [o] and [u]. Payne (1981) reconstructs six vowels for Proto-Arawakan, both [o] and [u] being included in the inventory. On the other hand, Ortiz (1998) posits /o/ as the

49

phoneme for the Kurri dialect 10 but offers no phonetic data to corroborate it. I present in Table 3.5 the alternations of these phones as presented in the lexical items collected.

In Table 3.5 all the instances of [o] ~ [u] are presented as they are related in cognates. When there is not a cognate in one of the dialects, the cell is left blank. I decided not to fuse blank cells with other correspondences that exhibit similarity because the actual realization of the vowel cannot be predicted. Therefore, even if the (apparently) same correspondence is given in a set that has more cells filled, it is left on its own due to the unpredictability of the words not present.

As can be seen from the contexts, there does not seem to be any contextual factors

involved in predicting the appearance of any of the two vowels. For exactly the same

context there are different realizations in the same dialect. Compare for example set 9

and set 16 for Ehe and Oho. One of the contexts for set 9 is d-a, which is also the context

for set 16. Ehe exhibits [u] in 9 and [o] in 16; and Oho exhibits [o] in 9 and [u] in 16.

This is typical of the data presented in this Table. I decided to include single instances to

demonstrate the degree of variability in the data.

Due to the impossibility of reaching conclusions based on the previous table, I then attempted a probabilistic approach in Table 3.6. This table represents a summary of the total realizations of both [o] and [u] in each dialect. Assuming that there is free variation between the two vowels and that the phonological context is not crucial, I decided to see the probability of appearance in each dialect.

Table 3. 6 Realizations of [o] and [u] in each dialect.
Dialect [o] [u] Total instances Percentage of [o]

Aha 71 18

89

79.8%

Ehe 31 52

37.3%

Oho 64 11

75

85.3%

Ñame 77 15

92

83.7%

From this table it can be concluded that [o] has a much higher probability of appearance in Aha, Oho and Ñame and a much lower in Ehe. In fact, it appears that the phoneme in the first three dialects mentioned should be transcribed as /o/ and in Ehe /u/.

51

This just a very gross analysis and more data and a more sophisticated statistical analysis would be needed to prove this preliminary division. These percentages of appearance could probably be more finely tuned by context and a better prediction be achieved. This data shows a drift between Ehe and the other dialects.

Other small differences are the last to be analyzed. 11 There are many differences that could be included here, and I will only deal with a portion of them, the ones that seemed more salient. In the classifier -dali (usually suffixed to stative verbs in nominal modifier function) Oho constantly presents the corresponding –dale. This is not a sound correspondence of [e] and [i] since it only happens in this context, it is only a correspondence between the classifier. I present some examples in Table 3.7 that attest to this claim.

Table 3. 7 –dale in Oho and non i/e correspondences.

The first three items in the table illustrate the classifier alternation, while the next
three items illustrate that there is no correspondence between [i] and [e] even word finally
among the four dialects. Generally, Oho maintains an [i] where the other dialects have it
except in the context of the classifier.
11 Vowel length will not be included because length and stress are related and since the data does not have the stress information marked in the transcription, it would not have been appropriate to deal with one without the other.

52

Another small variation that is not constant or predictable is the presence of extra segments in some words. This happens in different dialects at different times and may be relevant to other dialects in the continuum. Various examples of this are presented in Table 3.8. The extra segment is highlighted in each row.

For the cognate density analysis, I followed the procedures presented by Dyen (1975). Each lexical item in one dialect was compared to the same item in each of the other three dialects. This comparison yielded four possible outcomes: positive (+) if they were considered cognates, negative (-) if they were not considered cognates, questionable (?) if the cognate relationship could not be determined and not available (N/A) if one of the items was missing. The total for each category was then tallied and presented in Table 3.9.12

12 I am aware that these statistical analysis are very crude and that they need refinement to have better, and more significant, conclusions.

53

This data was then transformed into percentages of cognates. The percentage of cognates was calculated using the amount of questionable answers as a positive and a negative figure and calculating the average of the two. This is presented in Table 3.10.

Table 3. 10 Cognate density.

69.8

76.4

All percentages are within ten points of each other, which is as a rule of thumb considered the cutoff for significant differences (Dyen 1975). This means that all these dialects are very close together and would be considered as members of a single group. This confirms the idea that all of these are dialects of one language. What about subgroupings? This is a much more difficult question since the percentages are so close together and the questionable cognates are a significant figure. If we only take into account the average percentage of cognates, we have contradictory information that makes it difficult to establish an internal grouping. In order of highest to lowest cognate density we have the following pairs:
Aha-Oho>Ehe-Oho>Aha- Ñame> Oho-Ñame>Aha-Ehe>Ehe-Ñame
Why is this contradictory? Oho, according to these figures, is very close to both Aha and Ehe but these two dialects have one of the lowest cognate densities. On the other hand, Ñame is very close to both Aha and Oho but it is the farthest from Ehe. So all

54
this information is very hard to put together following strictly the numbers of cognates. If to that we include other information such as sound correspondence, then Ehe and Oho share the [dz] and Aha and Ñame the [j] but only one sound correspondence doe not provide enough evidence to establish an internal relationship. Taking all this into account, and based on intuitions, the little knowledge I have of geographical distribution and population density I believe that the internal relationship may be represented as in Figure 3.2.
Figure 3. 2 Kurripako internal relationships.

Ñame

Aha Oho

Ehe

This figure also reflects the fact that Hill (1988) has a paper on numeral classifiers in the Curricarro dialect of Kurripako, which I believe to be a mix between Aha and Oho (negatives kurri and karro respectively) but which was not identified in the interviews that I carried out. What this representation cannot explain is the close relationship in term of cognate density between Oho and Ehe but it does attest to the various intuitions that Ehe is more difficult.

55
3.5 Kurripako Classification within the Arawak Family The internal classification of Kurripako within the Arawak family becomes
difficult to discuss because of the inclusion of many of the varieties in some of the classifications. I will now summarize the varieties that each major author has included, as well as the place where each variety has been placed in relation to other varieties and other closely related Arawak languages. I follow Lizarralde (1993) in including all of the varieties that he has identified as being part of Kurripako and write them in italics. I will present the classification proposals chronologically.
Rivet and Loukotka (1924) divide the Arawak languages into 7 groups. I can only assume that Kurripako is included in the North Amazonian group since they do not explicitly name all of the languages in each group. The other groups are Pre-Andine, Bolivian, Arua, Guayanais, Uru-Pukina and Takana. When they describe all the Arawak languages, they mention ¨… les Kuatí, les Tapiíra, les Payoarini, les Ipéka, les Siusí, les Káua, les Huhúteni, les Katapolítani et les Karútana (Karúzana) […] quelquefois désignés sous le nom general de Izanémi;¨ (Rivet and Loukotka 1924: 645). It is not clear from this whether they think that these are different dialects or languages that can generally be referred to with the same name. All of them are varieties of Kurripako.

Kuatí Tapiíra Payoarini Ipéka Siusí Káua Huhúteni Katapolítani Karútana Izanémi (Karúzana)
Later (Rivet and Loukotka 1952), they divide the Arawak languages into 23 groups. In the Baré group they include “Guinaú, Bare, Uarekena, Adzáneni, Karútana, Katapolítani, Siusí, Ipéka, Tariana, Kauyari, Mandawáka, etc. “ The presence of that etc. is unfortunate since they mention many more languages when they describe the geographical locations, but it is uncertain whether they would have grouped them here. In all, they list 5 varieties and include them in one group along with Tariana, Bare, Uarekena and others.

57
Greenberg (1960) does not identify any of these, he only mentions the Arawak family as belonging to the Equatorial branch of the Andean-Equatorial grouping and within Arawak only mentions “…including Chapacura-Uanhaman, Chamicuro, Apolista, Amuesha, Araua, Uru.” (Greenberg 1960: 794).
Noble (1965: 10-11) uses the term Maipuran and divides this group into 8 subgroups. In the Northern Maipuran group there are 32 languages listed in columns and 15 listed in parenthesis below the columns. There is no explanation in the text as to what the parenthesis may mean. In the columns there are languages such as Goajiro, Island Carib, Piapoco, Arekena. All of the varieties that are of interest are in the parenthesis. These are: Izaneni, Ipeca, Kumada-Mnani, Adzeneni, Hohodene, Carutana, Catapolitani, Moriwene, Mauline, Mapanai, Waliperi-Dakenai, Rio Icanna Baniwa, Siusi, Tariana, Kurripako. Noble identifies 14 Kurripako varieties and places them all in the Northern Maipuran group. Key (1979) follows Noble (1965).

Loukotka (1968: 125-149) identifies Arawak as a stock and within Arawak proposes 36 groups. In the Caquetio group he includes 26 languages including Piapoco, Cabere, Maniba, and Amarizana. In the Baré group, he includes Baré, Uarequena, Adzáneni (or Adyána or Izaneni), Carútana (or Corecarú or Yauareté-tapuya), Katapolítani (or Acayaca or Cadaupuritani), Siusí (or Ualíperi-dákeni or

59
Uereperidákeni), Moriwene (or Sucuriyú-tapuya), Mapanai (or Ira-tapuya), Hohodene (or Huhúteni) and Máulieni (or Káua-tapuya). In the Ipéca group, he includes Ipéca (or Kumada-mínenai or Baniva de rio Içana), Payualiene (or Payoariene or Pacu-tapuya), Curipaco, Kárro and Kapité-Mínanei (or Coatí-tapuya). In the Tariana group he includes Tariana, Iyäine (or Kumandene or Yurupary-tapuya) and Cauyari (or Acaroa or Cabuyari. He identifies 15 Kurripako varieties and places them in four groups: one variant in the Caquetio group; eight in the Baré group, in which he includes Baré and Uarequena; five in the Ipéca group, this group consisting solely of Kurripako varieties; and one in the Tariana group.
Mattteson (1972) provides a reconstruction of Proto Arawakan on the basis of six Arawakan subgroups and four isolates, covering 26 languages in all. She cautions that she does “…not purport to outline a final classification of the Arawak languages, but a simple organization of the materials on hand according to percentages of shared vocabulary, and apparent structural similarities.” (Matteson 1972: 160) This is the first time that the classifications are backed up with a presentation of the data and the reconstructions. The subgroups are: Proto Shani, Proto Harakbut, Proto Piro-Apuriná, Proto Ashaninka, and Proto Madi (all of the first order) and proto Newiki of the second order. The isolates are: Parecí, Amuesha, Guajiro and Black Carib of Guatemala. Even though she claims that this is a simple organization of materials on hand, there are very strong claims about relatedness, especially in respect to Kurripako. Proto Newiki is a reconstruction based on the previous reconstruction of Western Newiki and Eastern Newiki. This is why it is considered to be of the second order. The name of this group,

60 Newiki, is derived from the Maniba form of the word for people (Matteson 1972); this is a variation of the word that I have presented before for people, naiki. The languages included in Western Newiki are Piapoco, Cabiyari and Yucuna. The languages included in Eastern Newiki are Tariano, Proto Curipaco-Maniba and Palicur. Proto CuripacoManiba is a reconstruction based on a list of 93 vocabulary items transcribed phonetically by Victor Kondo in 1965 for Curipaco and the Maniba data is from a list by Paul Headland in 196613. These are only two of the variants listed in Lizarralde, and they are grouped together along with Tariana and Palicur; more importantly, they are being considered as two different languages rather than two varieties of one language.
13 According to Matteson (1972) both of the lists are from fieldnotes in Lomalinda, Colombia which was a SIL site.

Miggliazza (1982) presents an evolutionary tree for Proto-Arawak from which he proposes separate branches. His main branch further divides into Southern, PreAndine, Arauan and Newiki. Within the Newiki group, there are three subgroups (not named), the main language being Tariana, with Curipaco and Baniwa branching off from Tariana around 1500 years ago, and Palikur branching off from Tariana at about 2000 years ago with further separations that give rise to Wapishana and Atorari. Miggliazza identifies two varieties of Kurripako as different languages and groups them in the Newiki group most closely to Tariana.

Payne (1991), using shared lexical retentions, proposes five groups for Maipuran languages: Western, Central, Southern, Eastern and Northern. The Northern group is further divided into Wapishana, Caribbean and Inland. The Inland group further divides into North Amazon and Yavitero. North Amazon consists of Resígaro and Rio Negro. Included in the Rio Negro grouping are: Achagua, Cabiyari, Curripaco, Piapoco, Tariana and Yucuna. He only includes in his classification the 24 languages for which he had enough data. He looks at 203 sets of basic vocabulary. When he lists the Maipuran languages, he recognizes Curripaco to be part of a larger Carru group which includes Maniba, Carutana, Curripaco, Ipeka and Catapolitani. It is not clear whether he considers these to be dialects or different languages.

Kaufmann (1994: 57) uses Arawakan to refer to the larger number of languages putatively related and Maipurean for the language family. Within Maipurean, he establishes a Northern and Southern division. The varieties that are of interest are within the Upper Amazon Branch, Eastern Nawiki subbranch. In this group, he includes Tariana and Karu. Within Karu, he identifies three dialect groups: Ipeka-Kurripako, KarútanaBaniwa and Katapolítani-Moriwene-Mapanai. Kaufmann identifies one language and three different dialect groups, establishing their boundaries geographically. He places the Karu language as closely related to Tariana. Campbell (1997) follows Kaufmann (1994).

Table 3.11 is a summary of the varieties presented in the different classifications. The name of the grouping to which a variety has been assigned is aligned with the name of the variety. This makes it easy to see when an author assigns the same variety with different names to different groups or to the same group.

In sum, Kurripako has not been identified in historical-comparative studies as one language until very recently. In many classifications, there are multiple varieties identified and even placed within different groups; even worse, the same variety has been identified by different names and placed within different groups. This is a consequence of the paucity of data available so that comparisons across what these authors called different languages could not be possible; in fact, many of the authors don’t present data or cite the sources of their data. Many of these classifications have relied heavily on geographical location and proximity as a factor of the groupings (with the exception of Payne 1991) and this is reflected in the names of the groupings (eg. Northern vs. Southern, Rio Negro, etc.). I do believe that geographical location has been a strong factor in the diversification of Arawak languages due to their geographical spread, but it is a factor that must be handled with care since geographical proximity can also lead to mutual influences. I believe that Kurripako is one language and that there is a sense in which Kurripako speakers imagine themselves as a community of speakers even though they lack a standard language from which to compare the differences of the varieties. This is reflected in their vocabulary and their self-identification vis-à-vis other speakers and other languages that are in close proximity. I also believe, as Aikhenvald (1999) has stated, that there is not enough data to accurately capture the internal classification of Arawak languages in general and Kurripako and its varieties in particular. There is a need to document in greater detail the Kurripako varieties, not only with word lists but also with texts and be able to compare not only phonology but also morpho-syntax, which is also the area in which Kurripako speakers feel that their dialects vary much

69
more than they do in terms of lexicon and phonology. This lack of data on many of the Arawak languages has been noted by anthropologists working on the early history of South America (Hill and Santos-Granero 2002).
3.6 Previous work on Kurripako There has been little work done that focuses exclusively on the Kurripako. They
have been mentioned in the work of anthropologists and archaeologists whose comparative work on Arawak peoples has been mainly focused on the reconstruction of the Arawak migration in South America (Oliver 1987, Zucchi 1992, Hill and SantosGranero 2002). Kurripako is also mentioned in some of the comparative linguistic studies of the Arawak language family and in studies of linguistic classification as described in the previous section.
Some of the studies that focus on Kurripako come from Anthropologists and their focus and geographical location have been varied. I present first their monographs followed by other publications. I maintain the denomination and the spelling that each author uses.
Hill (1993) worked with the Wakuenai of Venezuela. He presents an analysis of malikai chants and their performance by ritual specialists in various contexts where they are performed. This is both an ethnomusicologist analysis and an ethnographic account of these performances. Hill (1988) is an analysis of nominal classification in ritual and everyday language and its relationship to adjectival and numeral classifiers in the

70
Curricarro dialect. Before his book, Hill has a series of publications that deal with several different themes: social exchange (Hill 1984a; Hill and Moran 1983), social organization (Hill 1984b; Hill 1985a), religion (Hill 1985b), and ceremonial exchange (Hill 1987a; Hill 1987b).
Journet (1996) is a study of the social structures of the Colombian Curripaco. Journet’s emphasis is on the abstract principles of thought underlying traditional social organization rather than on their situation at the time. It shows how even though warfare and dance feasts no longer play much role in Curripaco daily life, they still play a key role in their thoughts and also occupy a prominent role in Journet’s analysis of their society. Journet has an earlier shorter version of the socio-economics of the Curripaco (Journet 1980-1981) as well as a description of the kinship system (Journet 1993).
Wright (1998) worked with the Hohodene Baniwa of Brazil. His work explores the generative role of Baniwa cosmology in shaping personal and community identities as well as Baniwa history. He intertwines historical sources with myth and narratives to build a coherent account of cosmology and historic action. This argument is further developed from collaborative work with Hill (Wright and Hill 1986). In this article, they focus on the millenarian movements of the nineteenth century and one of the Kurripako’s most famous prophets: Venancio Camico. Related to millenarian movements and their use of myth among the Kurripako, Wright (1993) presents some myths related to the Anaconda, whereas Wright (1993) is more of a linguistic analysis in that it explores the ritual language of chant specialists in male initiation rituals complementary to Hill’s (1993) study in that Wright offers some contrasting variations. Wright has several other

71
publications dealing with different topics such as myth and shamanism (Wright 1981; Wright 1992a; Wright 1992b), warfare (Wright 1990), and messianic movements (Wright 1987-1989).
Garnelo (2003) worked with the Baniwa of Brazil. Her main focus is on medical anthropology and the implications of different politics and moralities in the area of health. This work is inserted in the political anthropology of inter-ethnic relations with a specific focus on health and illness.
There are also some other studies from linguists. Gonzalez-Ñáñez, a Venezuelan linguist who has worked since the early 1980s in the Guainia region mostly with Guarekena, has described numeral classifiers for the Kurripako Eje/Kjenim dialect (González-Ñáñez 1985) and adjectives and adverbs (González-Ñáñez 1982/1983/1984). He and Mosonyi were also the linguistic consultants for a primer in Kurripako published by UNICEF (1997) .
Taylor (1991) provides an introduction to the grammar of Baniwa of Içana. He presents a practical orthography and a phonological sketch, three morphological aspects (expression of person, nominal classification and verbal categories) and a series of texts with interlinearization and Portuguese free translation. In the appendices, he provides a list of active and attributive verbal lexemes and a list of nominal classifiers.
Gomez-Imbert, a Colombian linguist that mainly works with Tukano languages, has a paper (Gomez-Imbert 1996) in which she argues that the change in the classification system of Tukano is due to Baniwa influence. She presents data on classifiers of both languages. Her Baniwa data comes from her own fieldwork.

72
Ortiz (1998) gives a brief introduction to the phonology of the Kurri dialect and identifies five others: Karro, Eje, Uju, Ñiame and Ñame. This is an introductory analysis based on her work in Colombia.
Ramirez (2001a) has recently published a dictionary of Baniwa, but it is practically unobtainable outside Brazil. I have managed to secure a copy of the dictionary which is based on the Central super-dialect and has annotations of some of the variants for the other two super-dialects. This dictionary includes approximately 10,000 entries as well as a brief grammatical sketch. He has also included some Baniwa data in a comparative Arawakan study (Ramirez 2001b).
Valadares, a Brazilian linguist, wrote for her MA thesis a grammatical description of Kumandene. Valadares (1994) provides information mainly on phonology and morphosyntax, and emphasizes that there is much to be done in the description of the various dialects at different levels before more comparative work can be carried out.
All in all, the anthropological information for Kurripako comes from three scholars that undertook their main fieldwork during more or less the same time (late 1970s to mid 1980s) in different locations. The linguistic information is more fragmentary and scattered, several authors presenting little pieces of different dialects.
3.7 Grammatical sketch of Kurripako, Ehe-Khenim dialect Following Aikhenvald’s (1999) description and organization for Arawak languages, I
will briefly present some of the areal features that Kurripako has and comment on the

73

ones that it does not seem to exhibit in contrast to other Arawak languages. This is intended to give the reader a general idea of the language and language family and the necessary tools to understand the argument marking system addressed in Chapter 4. A list of the abbreviations used can be found in Appendix B.

3.7.1. Phonology

Kurripako consonants are presented in Table 5 in IPA characters with the

exception of the retroflex trill for which there is no character in IPA.

One notoriously absent segment, which is not common to most Arawak

languages, is the alveolar fricative [s]. The voiced velar stop is only found in recent loan

words from Spanish, which is why it is in parenthesis. Most consonants have an

aspirated counterpart, the aspirated counterpart to the trill is the retroflex fricative, and

the counterpart to the bilabial approximant is the bilabial fricative. Most cases of

aspiration can be traced back to a phonological process of h-alignment at morpheme

74

boundary (for a more detailed account of this process see Granadillo 2002), though in

some words it is not clear. The presence of preaspirated nasals is a feature that is not

common in Arawak languages.

The vowels of Kurripako are presented in Table 6. There are four vowels, all of

them can be short and long.

Table 3. 13 Kurripako vowels
Front Non-front

High

i

u

Non-high e

a

These vowels can also combine into diphthongs. Four combinations of vowels are

not attested. These are /ei/, /eu/, /ea/ and /ae/. Of the rest, some more common than

others. If we take into account length and diphthongization, Kurripako has sixteen vowel

segments (four short vowels, four long vowels and eight diphthongs). Since it is not clear

whether this is the way the vowel segments are presented in Aikhenvald, it is difficult to

compare Kurripako to other languages in the family. Examples(3.1)-(3.8) below

exemplify all eight diphthongs.

“all”

(3.2) ie wirie

“kidney”

(3.3) ia dzawithiapo “arrow”

“morning”

75

(3.7) au tsulimauke “type of manioc plant”

(3.8) ai aini

“wasp”

Kurripako follows the general syllable structure, (C1) V {(V) (C2)}. As is common in

many Arawak languages, C2 is restricted to only nasals and is generally the result of

vowel elision, most commonly /i/. Other than this, there are few phonotactic restrictions,

as is common in Arawak languages. The phoneme /h/ generally occurs word initially,

aspirated segments are at morpheme boundaries. Kurripako has pitch stress (or pitch

accent) that interacts with vowel length. Nasalization is common in the contexts of

nasals and /h/. Examples of syllable structure are given below.

(3.12) CVV

“his tongue”

(3.13) CVC

kenke

“field”

The most common processes in Arawak languages are: vowel harmony, metathesis of stop and h, vowel fusion. All of these are present in Kurripako. The context of vowel harmony seems to be dependent of certain morphemes though more work is needed in this area. Vowel fusion is a complex interaction of stress and vowel length, one example is in (3.14).

nu-matsia-ita

1.sg- be.clean-VCA fish

“I clean the fish” (I prepare the fish to be eaten)

A morphological word usually contains a least one root morpheme and every
grammatical word contains at least two moras, though not necessarily two syllables as
Aikhenvald claims. This is exemplified by the contrast of imperatives in (3.15), the root
of “give” is a and compensatory lengthening occurs to comply with the need of two
moras.
(3.15) A. pia! pi-a 2.S-give “Give (it )”
B. yaa! i-a 2.PL-give “Give (it)”

3.7.2 Typological Profile As the majority of Arawak languages, Kurripako is polysynthetic and predominantly agglutinating. It is head-marking. It has a rich noun class and classifier system and a separate two gender system restricted to pronouns and cross-referencing markers. Arawak languages are mostly suffixing with few prefixes and Kurripako is no exception. Kurripako also follows the generalization that suppletion is rare. In spite of reduplication being a common process in the family, it is not found in Kurripako.

77

There are nouns and verbs as in all Arawak languages. The status of adjectives as a separate class is questionable and needs further investigation. Since they share some properties with nouns and other with verbs, it may result that some of them are nouns and others are verbs.
3.7.3 Nominal Morphology As is common in the family, Kurripako distinguishes alienable and inalienable possession. Nouns fall into three classes (inalienable, alienable, and non-possessable) with further subdivision into four classes within the alienable class depending on the possessive suffix that they take. Example (3.16) presents an unpossessed and possessed form of an inalienable noun; examples (3.17)-(3.20) present the four alienable classes (for a more detailed account see Granadillo 2004).

(3.20) kenke “field”

nu-kenke-re 1.S -field- POSS

“my field”

As other Arawak languages, Kurripako distinguishes two genders in crossreferencing affixes (feminine and non-feminine). Kurripako also has classifiers that

78

coincide with Aikhenvald’s Type I. That is, there is a large set of classifier morphemes

that are used with numbers and stative verbs and that also have a nominal derivational

function. One of these classifiers with a stative verbs is exemplified in (3.21)

(3.21) makapa uuni pema.

maka -pava

uuni pema

be.big -CLF :water river other.side

“on the other side of the big river”

As most Arawak languages, Kurripako distinguishes singular and plural on nouns

though the plural is many times left unmarked, particularly if there is a number that

makes implicit the plural reading. Cross-referencing affixes obligatorily distinguish

number though person and number are fusioned as can be seen in Table 3.14. More

details on this can be found in chapter 4.

3.7.4 Closed Classes: Personal pronouns, demonstratives, interrogatives, numbers, adpositions The independent personal pronouns are used to emphasize transitive and active intransitive subjects in topicalizations and as objects (this will be explained further in Chapter 4.). Kurripako pronouns follow the general principle for formation of Arawak

79

language pronouns, they consist of a person cross-referencing prefix plus an emphatic

one-syllable particle which happens to be the proximative /-ha/. These undergo a process of /h/ alignment14 to produce the forms presented in Table 3.15.

Demonstratives are monosyllabic as in all Arawak languages and are homophonous with the third person pronoun. Kurripako has a three term system, near/mid-distant/far, with the possibility of extending it by combining them.
There seem to be few generalizations that can be made about interrogative markers across the family. In Kurripako they are all ku-words (kuaka who/what, kuana why, kudza yes/no question marker frequently left out, kuadzu how, kuadzu kuuda when, kuayu instrumental and others). They can be used as relative pronouns and as indefinites, as is common in the family. An example of an interrogative marker as a relative pronoun is in (3.34).
3.7.5 Verbal Morphology Kurripako verbs can be divided into two classes depending on the way their arguments are marked. In general this follows an active/stative split (this will be further

14 /h/ alignment is a constraint that forces the /h/ segment to be as near the left edge of a word as possible. Its interaction with other constraints results in the /h/ combining with the nearest left consonant and in many cases producing aspirated or pre-aspirated segments.

80

developed in Chapter 4.) Kurripako predicate structure coincides with Aikhenvald’s (1999: 87) template scheme 2 for North Arawak and reproduced below:

O/So cross-referencing suffix

Kurripako has few cross-referencing suffixes, only those for third person as presented in Table 3.14. This is not uncommon since some Arawak languages have lost all of their cross-referencing suffixes.
Kurripako, as most Arawak languages, has both valency-increasing and valencydecreasing derivations. There are both morphological and periphrastic causatives; their distribution is an area that needs further research. There seems to be no passive in Kurripako, which typologically fits with the active-stative argument marking system.
Other verbal categories such as tense-aspect, mood, modality, directionals, aktionsarts, and evidentials are usually expressed by suffixes on the verb. Kurripako has a complex aspect system which implicitly expresses tense as well. Imperatives are a zero-marked verbal stem, as in most Arawak languages. North Arawak languages, as Kurripako, have fewer modal distinctions than Southern Arawak; the more frequent ones being optative, necessitative, potential, dubitative, conditional and frustrative. All of these are present in Kurripako Example (3.22) shows a frustrative, (3.23) a conditional

81

and (3.24) a potential. Directionals are rare in the family and I have not found evidence for them in Kurripako.

2.S- come -POT 1.S- COM 1.s- have -REST one –CL:building house

“You can come stay with me [even though] I only have one house”

Noun incorporation is found in few languages of the family, Kurripako not being

one of them. Relative and negative markers are the most stable prefixes in the Arawak

language family. In Kurripako ka- attributive and ma- privative derive stative verbs as in

examples (3.25) and (3.26).

(3.25) iniri “wife” ka-iniri “to be married” (literally to be with wife).

(3.26) ako “word” ka-ako “to speak” (literally to be word) ma-ako “to be quiet” (literally to be without word).

The privative is also used for negative imperatives and neutralizes person/number
distinctions as in example (3.27).
(3.27) mapitadza (phia/ faa)! ma- pita -tsa (phia/faa) PRIV- bathe -REST 2.S/2.PL “Don’t bathe!”

82
Negatives differ even among closely related languages. In Kurripako, there is both a suffix and an independent marker for negatives, they do not co-occur but further research is needed in this area.
3.7.6 Syntax Though most Arawak languages rely on cross-referencing affixes to mark core grammatical relations, in Kurripako both cross-referencing and position is used to mark grammatical relations. Position is especially crucial for objects and intransitive stative subjects because of the few cross-referencing suffixes. All Arawak languages have peripheral case suffixes, and Kurripako is no exception. Two peripheral case morphemes often combine in one word. As is generally the case for Arawak languages, in Kurripako attributive NPs demonstratives and numerals precede the head noun and adjectives follow it. Modifiers agree with the head noun in noun class. Example (3.28) has a numeral (with a classifier) and a noun following it. (3.28) nusrukadantha apaya carro
nu-sru-ka-dan-tha apa-ya carro 1.S-have-T/A-COND-FRU one-CLF:canoe car “If I had a car” In possessive NPs, the possessed noun is the head and the order is PossessorPossessed as in example (3.29) (3.29) Maria ikenkere Maria i-kenke-re Maria 3.S.FOC-field-POSS “Maria’s field”

83

Complex predicates and serial verbs do not seem to be auxiliary verbs in

Kurripako. Auxiliaries are present in few Arawak languages. As an areal property of the

languages of the Upper Rio Negro, serial verb constructions are present in Kurripako.

There is productive serialization with motion, posture and modal verbs. Though most

languages allow no more than two verbs in a serial verb construction, I have found

evidence for as many as four. Example (3.30) exemplifies three serial verbs.

(3.30) numa nuito nuira patsiaka nu-uma nu-ito nu-ira patsiaka 1.S-want 1.S-go 1.S-drink manioc drink “I want to go drink manioc drink”

As is common throughout the family, in Kurripako constituent order has

discursive functions with fronting of focused constituents as in example (3.31) which

contrasts with a non-focused constituent as in example (3.32).

(3.31) atsinali iiraka patsiaka

atsinali i-

ira -ka patsiaka

man 3.S.FOC- drink –T/A manioc drink

“The man (emphatic) drinks manioc drink”

(3.32) nairaka patsiaka atsina

na- ira -ka patsiaka

atsina

3.PL- drink-T/A manioc drink men

“The men drink manioc drink”

Even though most languages of the Upper Rio Negro are verb-medial or verb-final, I believe that the contrast presented before is evidence to call Kurripako a Verb-initial language with VOS order.

84

Relative clauses, as is most frequent in the family, are post-head with the

relativizer –li or nominalizer –ka. The relativizer is exemplified in (3.33) and the

nominalizer in (3.34)

(3.33) nuhnepia hlia atsinali idzaamiri

nu-ahne-pia hlia astinali i-

dzami-li

Coordination can be expressed through simple juxtaposition or with a connective.
Connectives are actually rare throughout the family. Example (3.35) shows coordination
with a connective and (3.36) with juxtaposition. Kurripako seems to have no pivot
restrictions, though more data is needed to verify this. Switch reference is rare among
Arawak languages and Kurripako follows this pattern.

3.8 A word on orthography
The Kurripako language has been written since about the 1960’s when a
missionary, Sofia Muller, produced the first translation of the New Testament (Muller
1985). Since then, there have been various orthographies developed and used

85

concurrently, all based on the Roman alphabet with some differences among them. All of these orthographies are internally inconsistent and do not follow the principle of one sound-one grapheme. Some of them also make distinctions that are not necessary in the language (such as the inclusion of both [o] and [u]) and fail to make distinctions that are necessary (such as the phonemic distinction of aspirated versus non-aspirated nasals). In general, the evangelized Kurripako have better literacy skills in Kurripako than nonevangelized Kurripako; further the reading abilities of evangelized Kurripako are much better than the writing skills. Some Kurripako are also literate in Spanish, but have limited literacy skills. This varies greatly depending on gender and occupation; generally, older males with more contact with non-Kurripakos have the best literacy skills. The Kurripako themselves complain about how difficult it is to learn to read and write in Kurripako because of orthographic problems and have expressed the need to revise and unify these different orthographies.
Taking the situation described above into account, I devised a practical orthography that applies to the Ehe-Khenim dialect and use it to present the examples throughout this dissertation. The graphemes used are the following: p, t, k, b, d, g, ph, th, kh, m, n, hm, hn, l, r, hl, v, f, dz, ts, sr, sh, w, y, a, e, i, u. Long vowels are represented as a sequence of two vowels. I provide the IPA symbol and an example word with the symbols in word initial position next to each grapheme.

3.7 Conclusion Kurripako is an Arawak language spoken in the Northwest Amazon in Brazil,
Colombia and Venezuela. There are many different names in the literature that are being used to refer to the same ethnolinguistic group. Some of these names refer to sibs within the group in Kurripako and in Nheengatú, exonyms and ethnonyms, place names and words that include the words for yes and no in the different dialects. The general consensus nowadays is that this is a language continuum that needs to be further studied

87
to clearly delimit the dialect differences. Identifying this continuum as one language has not always been the standard, as exemplified by the different ways in which many of the name variants have been used in internal Arawak classification. I use the name Kurripako to refer to this language group and identify the dialects by the words used for yes and no in the same fashion that my native speaker collaborators did. The data for this dissertation comes mainly from the Ehe-Khenim dialect. Kurripako has few characteristics that set it apart from the rest of the language family, it is an agglutinative language. The orthography used in this dissertation differs somewhat from the others used in published sources because of the problems that all of these present.

CHAPTER 4 ARGUMENT MARKING: STATIVE-ACTIVE TYPE
4.1 Introduction This chapter explores the argument marking of the Ehe-Khenim dialect of
Kurripako in terms of a stative-active marking. Section 4.2 presents a typological perspective on Stative-Active argument marking and follows Mithun (1992) in describing this phenomenon. Section 4.3 addresses argument structure in Kurripako transitive verbs. Section 4.4 presents argument structure in Kurripako intransitive verbs. Section 4.5 analyzes Kurripako argument marking in terms of Mithun’s (1992) typology of Agentive/Active argument marking. Section 4.6 addresses the presence of a few oblique subjects. Section 4.7 provides a general conclusion to the grammatical description.
4.2 Stative-active argument marking in typological perspective This type of argument marking has been referred to by many names: split-
intransitive, active-inactive, active-static, active-neutral, stative-active, agentivepatientive, split-S, fluid S etc. Each one is grounded in a particular theoretical inclination and has theoretical implications that are beyond the mere use of a label for a particular phenomenon. All of these labels are used for a phenomenon that can be generally characterized as follows.
There are two different markings to refer to the core arguments of a verb. I will refer to these core arguments as A for subjects of transitive verbs, S for subjects of intransitive verbs and P for objects of transitive verbs following Dixon (1979). A and P

89

have distinct case markings, whereas S might be marked under some circumstances with

the same case as A and under others with the same case as P. Mithun (1991) argues that

what defines the different case markings for S are conditions that are semantically based.

What complicates the situation is that there are various languages that have this kind of

case marking but their semantic motivations, or the circumstances under which S is

marked like A and like P, are different. This in part explains the plethora of labels and

the motivations behind them. I will now summarize the three prototypical cases

represented by Guarani, Lakhota and Central Pomo and their semantic basis as presented

in Mithun (1991).

According to Mithun, these three languages differ in the clustering of semantic

features that define the assignment of case for the intransitive argument. The features

identified are: event, performed/effected/instigated (these do not appear to function

independently), control, and affect (only with stative verbs). The way they cluster and

affect case marking can be summarized as in Table 1. The symbols I and II represent the

different case markings; I for the active or grammatical agent and II for stative or

grammatical patient.

In Guarani case is distinguished by pronominal prefixes on the verb. There are two sets of prefixes, the a- set and the še- set. The a- set of prefixes is used for transitive agents and some intransitive subjects; the še- set of prefixes is used for transitive patients and other intransitive subjects. All examples are quoted from Mithun (1991:511) Examples below show the a- set with transitive subjects:
(4.1) a-gwerú aína “I am bringing them now”

(4.2) ha upépe a-gařá šupé “and there I caught him”

The next examples show the same prefixes with some intransitive subjects:
(4.3) a-xá “I go”
(4.4) a-puˀá “I got up”
The next examples show the še- set with transitive patients:
(4.5) še-rerahá “It will carry me off”

(4.6) še-yukà varà̃ moˀá “He would have killed me”
This same set of prefixes is used with the subjects of some intransitives as the
examples below illustrate:

91
(4.7) šé-rasí “I am sick”
(4.8) še-ropehɨí “I am sleepy”
The Guarani system is one that is based primarily on a distinction of lexical aspect and is identified as active-stative. Intransitive verbs that take the a- set include walk, descend, come, run, swim, arrive, pass, fly, chat, turn around, dance, fire a gun, smoke, play, work and many more. Other verbs that also take this set are fall, die, sink, stagger, get lost, sleep, get stuck, wake up etc. Intransitive verbs that take the še– set include be hungry, be tired, be stingy, be weak, be tender, be wet, be hot, be fast, be dead, be anxious, be sick, be lame, be poor etc.
The primary feature underlying this categorization is lexical aspect. Verbs in the first class all denote events, they imply certain dynamicity or change over time. Verbs in the second class denote states and imply temporal stability. This is the prototypical case for those languages called active-stative in the narrow sense; that is those that case marking differences based on the lexical aspect of the verb.
In Lakhota case is distinguished by pronominal prefixes on the verb, just like in Guarani. There are two sets of prefixes, the wa- set and the ma- set. They have been traditionally described in terms of the kinds of verbs that they appear with; the first said to appear with active verbs and the second with neutral or stative verbs (Mithun 1991). However, a closer look reveals that there are some finer distinctions since not all active

92
verbs and neutral or stative verbs pattern together. All examples are quoted from Mithun (1991:515-517).
The following examples are sentences with active verbs and wa- case marking. (4.9) mawaní
“I walk” (4.10) wawáte
“I ate”
Then there are also some stative verbs with wa- case marking as in examples (4.11) and (4.12).
(4.11) ináwawizi “I’m jealous”
(4.12) wathí “I live, dwell”
The opposite is also true. There are many stative verbs with ma- case marking as in the following examples:
(4.13) mahás̢ ke “I’m tall”
(4.14) wamátikha “I’m tired”
There are also some verbs with ma- case marking which denote events as in examples (4.15)-(4.16).
(4.15) mahíx̢ paye “I fell”

93
(4.16) mat’é “I fainted, died”
A closer look at the whole system and these apparent incongruities leads Mithun to conclude that eventhood is not the semantic feature that is relevant for this language but rather agentiveness. Following Foley and Van Valin (1984) in their definition of agents and undergoers, Mithun takes the features of performing, effecting, instigating and controlling as the relevant ones to take into account.
In Lakhota, arguments that perform, effect, instigate and control are marked by the pronouns of the wa- set; and those that do not are marked by pronouns of the ma- set. In some cases this produces double patient constructions (for more details see Mithun 1991 and others quoted therein). These features act as bundle in the case of Lakhota, but for Central Pomo it is important to separate control from the other three.
In Central Pomo case is distinguished on pronouns and on some nouns. Examples are presented in the first person and are quoted from Mithun (1991:518-523). There are two different pronouns for first person singular: ˀa‧ and to̪ ‧ In transitive verbs, ˀa‧ is used to represent semantic agents and t̪o‧ is used to represent semantic patients as in the following examples.
(4.17) ˀa. mú.t̪u ˀé.yčadiw “I chased him away”
(4.18) ˀa. mú.t̪u hk’úm siw “I almost killed him”
(4.19) Mu.l to̪ . ʔé.yčadiw “He chased me away”

94
(4.20) Mu.l to̪ . hk’úm siw “He almost killed me”
In this case, there is not only a contrast between those arguments that perform, effect and instigate and those do not, as in Lakhota, but control is also a important feature that can be seen as affecting argument marking. The following examples are all of verbs in which the semantic subject can be seen as performing, effecting and instigating but the pairs are different in the degree of control exhibited by the agent. Those sentences that have a semantic subject that controls the action take the ˀa‧ pronoun and those that have
semantic subjects that do not show control take the t̪o‧ pronoun. This is presented in examples (4.21)-(4.23).
(4.21) A. ˀa. čhném “I ran into it” B. t̪o. čhném “I bumped into it (not watching)”
(4.22) A. ˀa. mat̪’ém “I stepped on it (intentionally)” B. t̪o. mat̪’ém “I stepped on it (involuntarily)”
(4.23) A. Wéno ʔa. sdí.q’ “I swallowed my medicine” B. Qhawé. qadó.n t̪o. sdí.q’ “I swallowed my chewing gum”
The semantic feature that interacts in Central Pomo in the case of states is affectedness. So, among states, sentences with patient case pronouns denote states that

95
significantly affect their participants as in examples (4.24)-(4.25); where as examples (4.26)-(4.27) denote inherent properties and therefore take agent case pronouns.
(4.24) to̪ . kasíla “I am cold”
(4.25) t̪o. kíts’čiw “I am scared”
(4.26) ˀa. ˀe qól “I am tall”
(4.27) ˀa. ˀe q’dí “I am good”
The effect of affectedness can be more evident in contrasting pairs of sentences, one with the inchoative construction. Basic adjectives take the agent-case arguments while their inchoative counterparts take the patient-case one. This is exemplified in (4.28)-(4.29).
(4.28) A. Yém ˀe ˀa. “I am old” B. Yémaq’ t̪o. “I have gotten old”
(4.29) A. ʔa. mačún “I am lame” B. to̪ . mačúnaq’ “I got crippled”
Argument marking in Central Pomo thus takes the intersection of two features into account: control and significant affectedness. This typology of argument marking can help in identifying which of these cases is relevant for Kurripako. Once we have

96
established that there is indeed an alternation in argument marking in intransitive verbs that uses the same argument markers as for semantic agent and patient of transitive verbs, we can use the diagnostic verbs presented in Table 1 to determine what are the relevant semantic features for this particular language.
4.3 Kurripako argument marking I will first present data to support the presence of two different kinds of argument
marking in transitive sentences.
4.3.1 Agents Agent is encoded through verbal pronominal agreement as a person marker prefix. This prefix is obligatory and it agrees in person and number with A. Example (30) presents an A in first person and nominal P.
(4.30) nuiraka patsiaka nu- ira -ka patsiaka 1.S- drink-T/A manioc drink “I drink manioc drink”
The prefixes encode person and number. In the third person singular, gender is also encoded as a feminine-non feminine distinction and there is also a different prefix for nominals as opposed to pronominals. When the agents are nominals there is variation as to the assignment of the prefix. Examples in (4.31) present this encoding in third person singular with no nominals.

97

B. liiraka patsiaka

li-

3.S.NF- drink –T/A manioc drink

“He drinks manioc drink”

Examples in (4.32) are sentences with a third person nominal agent in focused position.

iinaro i-

ira -ka patsiaka

woman 3.S.FOC- drink-T/A manioc drink

“The woman (emphatic) drinks manioc drink”

Examples in (4.33) are sentences with a third person nominal agent in non-focused

position.

(4.33) A. liiraka patsiaka atsinali

li-

ira -ka patsiaka

3.S.NF- drink –T/A manioc drink man

B. ruiraka patsiaka iinaro

ru- ira -ka patsiaka

iinaro

3.S.F- drink-T/A manioc drink woman

“The woman drinks manioc drink”

Interestingly, the gender and nominal vs. pronominal distinction that is marked in the third person singular is not marked in the third person plural. There is only one prefix

98

marker for third person plural as exemplified in examples (4.34)-(4.36). The sentence in
(4.34) has a third person pronominal plural agent.
(4.34) nairaka patsiaka na- ira -ka patsiaka 3.PL- drink –T/A manioc drink “They (masc or fem) drink manioc drink”

Sentences in (4.35) have a third person nominal plural agent in focused position.
(4.35) A. atsina nairaka patsiaka atsina na- ira -ka patsiaka men 3.PL- drink-T/A manioc drink “The men (emphatic) drink manioc drink”
B. inapeda nairaka patsiaka inapeda na- ira -ka patsiaka women 3.PL- drink-T/A manioc drink “The women (emphatic) drink manioc drink”

These sentences can also have the agent in a non-focused position as in (4.36).

(4.36) A. nairaka patsiaka atsina

na- ira -ka patsiaka

atsina

3.PL- drink-T/A manioc drink men

“The men drink manioc drink”

B. nairaka patsiaka iinapeda na- ira -ka patsiaka iinapeda 3.PL- drink-T/A manioc drink women “The women drink manioc drink”

There can also be an impersonal agent that is marked by the prefix –pa as in example
(4.37).
(4.37) liuma pawentaka tirulipi li- uma pa- wenta-ka tirulipi 3.S.NF-want IMP-sell -T/A manioc squeezer “He wants someone to sell [him] a manioc squeezer

99

Table 4.2 summarizes the person marker prefixes. These prefixes also appear on nouns

in possessive constructions.

Agent pronouns are only included when they are emphatic and they appear in the
focused position as in (4.38).
(4.38) hnua nukapaka phia hnua nu-kapa-ka phia 1.S 1.S-see-T/A 2.S “I (emphatic) saw you”

Independent pronouns are presented in Table 3. They are composed of the person markers and the proximate suffix –ha which triggers a phonological process of /h/ alignment. (For a discussion of this process see Granadillo 2002).

4.3.2 Patients
First and second person singular and plural patients are not marked on the verb. The independent pronouns appear after the verb and these pronouns are the same as the ones used for agents; it is only their position (after the verb) that signals their function as patients. See examples (4.39)-(4.40).
(4.39) likabena hnua li- kabena hnua 3.S.NF- pay 1.S “He pays me”
(4.40) likapa phia li- kapa phia 3.S.NF-see 2.S “He saw you”
Third person patients however are more complicated. When they are expressed as nominals and independent pronominals, they directly follow the verb just as first and second person patients do. This is presented in examples in (4.41)-(4.42). Sentences in (4.41) have nominal patients and (4.42) are the corresponding pronominals.
(4.41) A. hnueema kalaka nu-heema kalaka 1.S-barbeque chicken “I barbeque the chicken (fem)” B. hnueema kuphee nu-heema kuphee 1.S-barbeque fish “I barbeque the fish (nfem)”

101
C. hnueema aati nu-heema aati 1.S-barbeque chili “I barbeque the chili (plural not marked but understood)”
(4.42) A. hnueema srua nu-heema srua 1.S-barbeque 3.S.F “I barbeque it (fem)”
B. hnueema hlia nu-heema hlia 1.S-barbeque 3.S.NF “I barbeque it (nfem)”
C. hnueema hnaa nu-heema hnaa 1.S-barbeque 3.PL “I barbeque them”
However, there are also suffixes (-ni for singular non feminine -no for singular feminine
and –na for plural) that sometimes appear on the verb. Examples in (4.43) are the same
as above with the suffixes.
(4.43) A. hnueemano nu-heema -no 1.S-barbeque 3.S.F “I barbeque it (fem)”
B. hnueemani nu-heema -ni 1.S-barbeque -3.S.NF “I barbeque it (nfem)”
C. hnueemana nu-heema -na 1.S-barbeque -3.PL “I barbeque them”

102

The usage of these suffixes seems to be discourse determined but further research is

needed to ascertain this. All three types are exemplified in (4.44).

(4.44) lidzanani, lipheko hliwida, lipheko hlipa, hnete ligidzaka hlia. li- dzaana -ni , li- pheko li- hiwida
3.S.NF- cook -3.S.NF 3.S.NF- throw 3.S.NF - head ,

li- pheko li- hiipa, hnete li-

gidza -ka hlia

3.S.NF- throw 3.S.NF- foot DM 3.S.NF- to stew –T/A 3.S.NF

“He cooks him, he throws out his head, he throws out his feet and then he stews him.”

Reflexive patients can be expressed in two different ways depending on the inherent
reflexivity of the verb. If the verb is inherently reflexive, it is an intransitive verb and
does not require a patient as in example (4.45).
(4.45) nuuma nuitoka nupita nu-uma nu- ito -ka nu- pita 1.S- want 1.S- go –T/A 1.S- bathe “I want to go bathe [myself]”

In order for this verb to have a transitive reading and a patient it needs the valency
changing suffix –ita as in example (4.46).
(4.46) nupiteetaka hmapeni nu- pita -ita -ka hmapeni 1.S-bathe -VCA-T/A child “I am bathing the child”

Transitive verbs, on the other hand, have a reflexive suffix that is on the verb. Contrast example (4.47) with (4.48).

103

(4.47) nukapaka phia nu- kapa –ka phia 1.S- see –T/A 2.S “I see you”

(4.48) nukapaakaka nu- kapa -aka -ka 1.S- see -RF –T/A
“I see myself”

To summarize, patients can be expressed in different ways. As nominals they directly follow the verb or the dative if there is one. As pronominals they use the independent person marking forms and they follow the verb or the dative. For the third person there are also bound forms that are in these same positions. As reflexives, they are not marked if the verb is inherently reflexive and they are marked on the verbal root as a reflexive/reciprocal suffix when the verb is not inherently reflexive.15

4.4 Intransitives
Intransitive verbs can be divided into two classes depending on the presence or
absence of person marking prefixes as seen in examples (4.49)-(4.50).
(4.49) nudiakawa pantiriku nu-dia -ka -wa panti-liku 1.S-return-T/A –INTR house-LOC “I am returning into the house”
(4.50) haamaaka hnua haamaa-ka hnua be.tired-T/A 1.S “I am tired”
Other forms of marking give rise to unacceptable sentences as in (4.51) and (4.52).
15 Note that the position is different from the position of the object suffixes. The reflexive marker precedes tense/aspect marker, whereas the object marker follows tense/aspect.

104

(4.51) *diakawa hnua pantiriku dia -ka -wa hnua panti-liku return-T/A –INTR 1.S house-LOC “I am returning into the house”
(4.52) *hnuamaaka nu-haamaa-ka 1.S-be.tired-T/A “I am tired”

In comparing the way the subject is marked, (4.49) has a subject marking that is the same

as the agent in transitive verbs and that has been summarized in Table 4.2, whereas (4.50)

has a subject marking that is the same as patients and has been summarized in Table 4.3.

This kind of marking would pair some of the intransitive subjects with the agents

and some of the intransitive subjects with the patients, having therefore two different

markers for semantic subjects of intransitive verbs. The use of the person markers is

exactly the same as with the transitive verbs, including the bound forms for third person

singular objects. This is presented in examples (4.53)- (4.61).

So far, I have shown that there is indeed two different markings for arguments in
the transitive sentences of Kurripako, one for the semantic subject and a different one for
the semantic object. Furthermore, these two types of argument marking are also present
in arguments of intransitive verbs. In the following section, I will analyze what is the
semantic basis for the argument marking distribution in Kurripako.

106

4.5 Semantic basis: which one? I will use the diagnostic verbs that Mithun (1991) presented in order to discern the
semantic features that are relevant for the distribution of the argument marking in intransitive verbs in Kurripako. I present again Table 4.1 summarizing the features, example verbs and case marking distribution that differentiate each of the three cases.

It is important to note that features such as control and affectedness can be culturally determined and not interpreted the same way in any two given languages. Therefore it is important to take these sample verbs as exemplifying in these particular languages those characteristics but a complete match may not necessarily occur in any other language. That said, I have had to substitute some of the verbs for others that I consider also have the same properties due to limitations in my database. Usually, the verbs have been substituted by other verbs that have the same semantic features and in many cases are opposites. The argument marker has been highlighted.

107

As examples from verbs of type A with the semantic features of +Event,
+Perform/Effect/Instigate and +Control and with agent marking, there are “go” and
“run”.

“sneeze” and “cough”.

As examples from verbs of type C with the semantic features of +Event, Perform/Effect/Instigate and –Control and with agent marking, there are “fall”, “die” and

“capsize”. Because of the absence of slip, I considered that the specificity of the verb

“capsize”, as when one has an accident, contains the semantic features described above.

As examples from verbs of type E with the semantic features of -Event, -

Perform/Effect/Instigate and -Control, - Affect and with patient marking, there are “to be

tall”, “to be good”, “to be weak”. To be weak was chosen as the opposite of “to be

strong”, and “to be good” was chosen following the inclusion of this as one of the

examples of Central Pomo in this category (Mithun 1992: 521).

As examples from verbs of type F with the semantic features of -Event, Perform/Effect/Instigate and -Control, +Affect and with patient marking, there are “to be happy”, “to be tired”, “to be cold”. “To be happy” substitutes “to be sick” following the inclusion of this as one of the examples of Central Pomo in this category (Mithun 1992: 520). Example (4.75) has a dative subject; this phenomenon will be addressed in section 4.6.1.
(4.73) nini katima hnua nini katima hnua DM be.happy 1.S “So I am happy”
(4.74) hnete haamaa kepinaa hlia hnete haamaa kepinaa hlia DM be.tired be.full 3.S.NF “Then he was tired and full”
(4.75) hapeka nusriu hape -ka nu-sriu be.cold-T/A 1.S-DAT “I am cold”
Examples from verbs of type D, with the semantic features of -Event, +Perform/Effect/Instigate and +Control and with patient marking, are not included because they are absent from my database. There is the verb “to live”, but it is not clear that this is the same as “to reside”. The main difficulty in trying to find other examples that could be substituted for “to be prudent” and “to be patient” is the fact that the semantic feature of control (which is the critical feature in this case) is one that is very tied to cultural values and very difficult to discern if the right question has not been asked or the critical contrast not present in the data. That said, it is possible to still fit Kuripako into one of the three types without this set of data because of the distribution of the

110

argument markings. Examples for sets A, B, and C all pattern together having prefixes,

whereas examples for sets E and F pattern together having patient type marking .

Therefore, the examples presented before, with the exception of (4.75) which will be

addressed later, provide evidence that Kurripako argument marking patterns with the

same verbal distribution as Guarani and can be considered an Active-Stative type

language.

This would predict that intransitive verbs that are active would have their

semantic subjects marked with a prefix and intransitive verbs that are stative would mark

their semantic subjects with a suffix or positionally after the verb. Looking at a sample

inventory of verbs and classifying them as active or stative according to the type of

argument marking that they present, there are some issues that need to be addressed.

At first sight, it generally holds that verbs that take prefixes are active or refer to an action whereas those that do not take the prefixes tend to be stative, but there are a few exceptions. For example, kaako “to speak a language” kainiri/kairo “to marry” are considered statives. These particular examples point to an interesting phenomenon that needs to be addressed.
There are many stative verbs that are derived from nouns by adding the attributive and privative prefixes ka- and ma- . The examples mentioned above, kaako, kainiri and kaino, are but three of them. This is a very productive derivation that is very commonly used. Another example of this derivation are the verbs for “to be fat” and “to be thin”

112
keepe and meepe (from the noun for meat ipe and the prefixes.) See examples (4.76) and (4.77).
(4.76) iniri “wife” ka-iniri “to be married” (literally to be with wife). (4.77) ako “word” ka-ako “to speak” (literally to be with word) ma-ako “to be quiet”
(literally to be without word). It seems likely that there is only one prefix slot that can be filled and therefore when these verbs are derived there is no slot for the person marker to fill, therefore having to have an object marker for the subject. This hypothesis is further supported by data from the imperatives. Imperatives do not have any particular T/A marking on the verb, that is their distinguishing feature. They carry second person prefix markers, either singular or plural as in (4.78)-(4.79). (4.78) pipita!
pi- pita 2S-bathe “Bathe!” (sg)
(4.79) ipita! i- pita 2.PL- bathe “Bathe!” (pl)
Negative imperatives on the other hand, have both a prefix negative marker which is the privative marker ma- and a restrictive suffix –tsa. When both of these affixes are added, the person markers disappear and the subject is optionally expressed with the independent pronouns following the verb, just like patients.

113

(4.80) mapitadza (phia/ faa)! ma- pita -tsa (phia/faa) PRIV- bathe -REST 2.S/2.PL
“Don’t bathe!”

This can be considered evidence for the presence of only one prefix slot, and in
turn this is the cause of the necessary object marking of some of the stative verbs. When
one of these verbs then has the need to include another argument it then assigns to it an
oblique case such as locative as in example (4.81).
(4.81) kaakoka hnua kuripakoliku kaako-ka hnua kuripako-liku speak-T/A 1S kuripako-LOC “I speak Kurripako”

But we then have to account for the presence of subject marking in causatives

such as “to fatten” in example (4.82).

(4.82) nukeepetaka nokutsin

nu-keepe-ta-ka

no-kutsi-ni

1S-be.fat-CAUS-T/A 1S-pig-poss

“I fatten my pig”

This causative affix is very similar to the one used to transitivize intransitive
verbs as presented in (4.46) and repeated here as (4.83).
(4.83) nupiteetaka hmapeni nu- pita -ita -ka hmapeni 1.S-bathe -VCA-T/A child “I am bathing the child”

114

In fact, the majority of the stative verbs take the causative affix –ta but there is a

small number that take the causative affix –ita as evidenced by the phonological changes

that the adjoining vowels undergo as in (4.84).

(4.84) numatsieta kuphee

nu-matsia-ita

kuphee

1.sg- be.clean-VCA fish

“I clean the fish” (I prepare the fish to be eaten)

So this must be a more general valency changing affix that has the capacity to add

an argument to verbs and when confronted with an intransitive verb it will add one

argument: a patient if it is active as in example (4.85) and an agent if it is stative as in

example (4.86) . We must assume that this need for an argument will override presence

of only one prefix slot.

(4.85) nupiteetaka hmapeni nu- pita -ita -ka hmapeni 1.S-bathe -VCA-T/A child
“I am bathing the child”

(4.86) nukeepetaka nokutsin

nu-keepe-ta-ka

no-kutsi-ni

1S-be.fat-CAUS-T/A 1S-pig-poss

“I fatten my pig”

To summarize, intransitive verbs have two different argument markings which can be easily identified by the presence or absence of person marking prefixes. This marking may have a morphosyntactic explanation in those stative verbs that have been derived from nouns by the use of the privative and attributive prefixes.

115

One more issue that needs to be addressed is the apparent nonconformity to argument marking in example (4.75). This could be considered an example of oblique arguments.

4.6 Oblique arguments? There remains a couple of verbs that do not take either agent or patient marking
for their subjects as in example (4.75). These constitute so far only three items: “to be hot”, “to be cold” and “to be hungry”.

4.6.1 Dative subjects?

These three verbs seem to take dative subjects but native speaker collaborators insisted on translating sru, which can function as the dative marker, with the verb “to have”. This may result from influence of Spanish expressions like “tener frío”, “tener calor”, “tener sed” etc with tener “to have”. The Kurripako verb “to have” is in fact sru, homophonous with (maybe derived from?) the dative marker –sru. Compare examples (4.87) and (4.88).

(4.87) pinuena nuinai, nusruetsa padapana panti

pi- nu -ena nu- inai nu- sru -etsa apa -dapana

panti

2.S- come -POT 1.S- COM 1.s- have -REST one –CL:building house

“You can come stay with me [even though] I only have one house”

(4.88) waapia lisru peethe

wa-a-pia

li- sru peethe

1.PL-give-T/A 3.S.NF- DAT manioc bread

“We gave him manioc bread”

116

So sru “to have” follows all of the structural characteristics outlined in 4.2 for

transitive sentences (ie. person marking prefixes for agent, patient following verb etc).

Yet when it is used in the expression of to be cold, hot and hungry it does not seem to comply with them. I present only one of them in example (4.89)16 but we can assume

that all of them are the same. Let us consider the possibility that sru should be analyzed

as the verb “to have” as in (4.89).

(4.89) hapeka nosru

hape-ka

no-sru

? be.cold-NOM 1.S-have

“I am cold” [Yo tengo frío]

What is odd about this expression is the word order. It would be expected that the

patient of a transitive follow the verb as peethe does in (4.88), yet here it precedes it.

Furthermore, we would have to assume that the affix –ka is a nominalizer and that it

converts this stative verb/adjective into a noun. Suspiciously this parallels the Spanish

version. What happens if we assume this is a dative subject? Let us see an alternative

analysis in (4.90).

(4.90) hapeka nosru hape-ka no-sru be.cold-T/A 1.S-DAT “I am cold”

In this case we must assume that the affix –ka is a T/A affix on the stative verb

and that the dative follows the verb just as it does in ditransitive sentences. This seems to

better capture the data and not leave loose ends. What remains to be explained is why the

paucity of verbs that take this form of subject marking. One interesting piece of data to

16 The other two expressions are: hamuka nosru for ‘I am hot’ and mawitakai nosru for ‘I am hungry’.

117
note is that young speakers find acceptable a form like hapeka hnua and produce it when prompted for another way to say the same expression.
(4.91) hapeka hnua hape-ka hnua be.cold-T/A 1.S
This example shows that these dative subjects might be regularizing to the rest of the stative verbs in presenting patient marking on their subjects.
4.7 Conclusions I have provided data that presents the argument marking structure of the Ehe-
Khenim dialect of Kurripako. Transitive verbs have prefix markers that agree with the Agent. Patients are marked mainly by word order except for a small set of third person forms. Intransitive verbs can have two different structures. One set takes the same prefix markers as the transitive verbs do for marking agreement with the Subject while another set uses the same marking strategy as patients of intransitives. This division generally follows a semantic condition of active and stative but morphological derivation must also be taken into account. There seems to be only one prefix slot in verbs and when this is filled by any other element the subject is then marked as patient. There is also a very small set of verbs that take a dative subject.

5.1 Introduction

CHAPTER 5 TEXTUAL ANALYSIS

This chapter presents the three texts to be analyzed. First, I provide a general explanation of how these texts are organized and also contextualize these texts within the total corpus of recordings. Section 5.2 presents a song, section 5.3 presents a speech and section 5.4 presents a child’s performance of a story. An audio of each text as well as a sample translation and transcription session is presented in .wav format, metadata for these audio files can be found in Appendix C.
Each text is presented with an interlinear morphological and word gloss as well as a free English and Spanish translation. Along with the text, there is sociolinguistic information about the speaker(s), transcribers and translators as well as brief contextual information of the production; more information on the context of the documentation, the reasons and the ultimate use of these texts are explored in chapter 6. These texts were chosen because of the interest of community members in their recording and use in this project. Each text will be analyzed in terms of the active-stative split to look at this grammatical form in naturally occurring speech as well as any other characteristics that are relevant to each text. The result of this analysis is to suggest that stative forms are very restricted in their occurrence. This result is, of course, preliminary, based as it is on only three texts, but it raises some interesting questions for future explorations of the role of the active-stative distinction in discourse.
The texts have been minimally edited, only errors in speech which would make the texts incomprehensible and that were pointed out in the transcription/translation

119
sessions have been edited. Repetitions, false starts and interjections have not been edited. As far as possible, I have checked with Ramirez (2001) for the accuracy of the translations; whenever the items were not found, I have formed my own conclusions based on the translations that were given by my native speaker collaborators and my own knowledge of the language. The Spanish translation has been preserved in square brackets in case it may be more useful at some point. The English translation has been made based on the Spanish translation and my own knowledge of the language. I follow the Leipzig glossing rules which can be found at http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/files/morpheme.html. Line breaks were suggested by the transcribers/translators who were literate in both Kurripako and Spanish; in the case of the song, intonation breaks were also a significant factor in determining these. When the units in Kurripako were longer than one line, the full Kurripako unit is given first, followed by the lines of glossing and finally the line for the free translation.
The total corpus of recordings consists of naturally occurring speech, elicitation, and transcription/translation sessions. The distribution of the recordings is as follows: ¼ naturally occurring speech, ¼ elicitation and ½ transcription/translation sessions. Only about ¼ of the recordings of naturally occurring speech have been transcribed and/or translated due to multiple factors.
There are many difficulties in working with naturally occurring speech. The first problem is in the recording context. Sometimes there are recordings whose quality make it impossible to transcribe or translate. These difficulties can be due to equipment limitations such as having only one microphone for multiple speakers and therefore not

120
being able to record well all speakers, or to external circumstances such as having very loud background noise or echo or wind. I have one recording that was done with a group of women while they were processing manioc and the noise that the machetes make while peeling and cutting as well as the noise of the gasoline-run grater make it impossible to follow the conversation. This is a pity since this is a context that lends itself well to conversation as the women work. The next problem may be related to your nativespeaker collaborators. It is not always possible to find someone willing to put in the time and effort involved in transcribing and translating recordings; and even if s/he is willing, not everyone has the abilities required for this work. Assuming that there are no language internal barriers (such as dialect differences, which were crucial in my problems) transcribing and translating require a great amount of patience and effort. I have estimated that on average each minute of naturally occurring speech takes about one hour of work to achieve a transcription and translation. The complexity of the work varies depending on the number of speakers, and the kind of context. The easiest recordings to work with are those of one speaker in a highly predictable and known context. For example, the song presented later was not very complex in terms of transcribing and translating it since it was very repetitive. In my experience, the most complex recordings to work with are those were there are multiple speakers with dialect differences and free flow of conversation, particularly if there is a lot of joking and play involved. My naturally occurring speech recordings that have these characteristics were impossible to work with.

121
On the other hand, elicitation sessions are very easy to translate/transcribe since the material is highly predictable, usually simple and controlled. This is also true of transcription/translation sessions since an agenda is usually know before hand as well. I have included in Appendix D a copy of the notes used in the translation of this same text. The importance of these recordings is that many times this is what gives the researcher access to metalinguistic knowledge. During elicitation and translation/transcription the researcher poses questions that shed light on metalinguistic knowledge; the questions are highly contextualized and emerge from the material that is being discussed. Many times these comments remain as asides and notes on the recordings and manuscripts. These texts are as important in documentation as the naturally occurring speech is.
Given these problems, the criteria that I used in selecting the texts for discussion in this presentation were the following: variety in genre, fully transcribed/translated and analyzed (or easy for me to do so) and importance for the speakers. The three texts that were chosen follow these criteria.
5.2 Nupeyondaka phia, nukitsinda. I like you, my friend This song was documented at the urging of a school teacher. The teacher
accompanied me to record this song from an elderly woman who lives in Pavoni. Melania Evangelista Evaristo (MEE) is 70 years old. She was born in Victorino, and recognizes herself as a speaker of Aha. According to her, the song is originally a greeting song performed by men and women from the host village upon the arrival of visitors for a festival. There is also another speaker in the text, the teacher that brought me to the old

122
woman. Lilia Evaristo (LE) is distantly related to Melania though she calls her grandmother (she couldn’t explain how they were related). She is 40 years old, a speaker of Ehe, and lives in Pavoni during the week and in Puerto Ayacucho, where she also owns a house, on the weekends. The initials of each speaker are identified after the line number. Each speaker is identified with her own name at her own request. The song was transcribed and translated with the help of Jose Valero, a 16-year-old speaker of Aha also residing in Pavoni. He suggested the break points for each sentence, being literate in both Kurripako and Spanish. Stative verbs are bolded throughout the transcription.
There are many words in the song that were not understandable to the native speaker collaborator who helped me transcribe and translate the song, these remain marked as ?? in the glossing and the translation. I presented these lines to several different people and would get very different responses as to the possible meanings. Some of them claimed to identify some of the nouns as names of deities or demons and others would just not offer any information. This might be due to several reasons. It might be that the information is one that is not accessible to evangelicals because of their loss of cultural knowledge related to these fields; that would make sense if we assume that these are references to deities or other relevant cultural information that evangelicals no longer posses. It might also be that they do know what these words mean but they feel that this is knowledge that cannot be shared either because it might still be sacred to them or because they might feel that as evangelicals they shouldn’t be acknowledging this information. This remains an issue to be resolved with non-evangelical collaborators.

In this text, the predominance of active verbs is striking. There is an active verb in just about every line. In contrast, there are only nine occurrences of stative verbs, three of them in the conversation that is being carried out between the two renditions of the song (lines 9-11) and six of them used in the song. There are more stative verbs used as

128

nominal modifiers (lines 7, 26, 29) or verbal modifiers (lines 18, 25)20 than being used as

predicates (lines 8, 9, 10, 11). They can be identified as nominal modifiers due to the

presence of classifiers that agree with the noun as in example (5.1) taken from line 26.

Only nominal modifiers, numerals and stative verbs, take classifiers.

be.big -CLF :water river other.side ??

They can be identified as verbal modifiers due to their lack of inflection and to the
presence of a verb with argument marking directly after it; this is presented in example
(5.2) taken from line 18.

In contrast to the modifier position, stative verbs as predicates usually carry T/A inflection and sometimes argument marking suffixes22. Example (5.3) taken from line 8 presents a verb with T/A marking and an independent pronoun following the verb acting as the semantic subject.

20 I am aware that nominal and verbal modifiers can be labeled as adjectives and adverbs, however it is not
clear that these are actually different word classes in Kurripako and I therefore prefer to refer to them by
their function. The issue of categorization remains for further study. 21 Usually iinonaa. 22 As mentioned in Chapter 4, it is not clear what the conditions are for the use of the person marking
suffixes as opposed to the independent pronouns.

Another issue that was left to be explored in texts as opposed to elicitation in chapter 4 was the use of the third person suffixes as opposed to the independent pronouns to mark objects and subjects of stative verbs. Unfortunately, in this text there are no instances of third person suffixes or independent pronouns. This leaves us with no information in this respect.
Songs can have unusual styles due to their nature. In this song, there is much variation in tempo and speed and some of the lines are being sung while they are breathed in (see audio file song.wav). They also offer cultural information that is directly linked to the context in which they were originally used. In this case, there are references to the activities to be done later on during the festival, drinking and sharing of food, as well as the feelings that are expected to be expressed at the parting of the visitors, sadness. Even though the next text is of a different kind, a monologue, it still presents many cultural references because of its topic, a call to maintain some of the traditional ways of life of the ancestors.
5.3 Nukaite sha, nukistiñape. I talk to you, my friends
This text was recording in the village of Saron at the urging of the speaker, Samuel Lorenzo. He was one of my native speaker collaborators, a man in his sixties

130
(exact age unknown) and speaker of Aha. The text was transcribed first by Ismenia Yavinape and then translated by Humberto Gomez with the occasional clarification and help of Samuel Lorenzo. Humberto Gomez is the son of Samuel Lorenzo and a second language speaker of Kurripako. According to Humberto and Samuel, Samuel sometimes mixes vocabulary of Oho/Karo in his speech. Humberto is a 32-year-old native of the Guainia region. He spent a good part of his childhood in Bogotá, Colombia and later learned Kurripako from the age of 18 on when he returned to the Kurripako villages. He speaks Aha. His wife is a Kurripako dominant speaker of Aha with very little spoken command of Spanish and his children speak mainly Kurripako as well. They all live in the village of Saron. Humberto and Samuel belong to different households. They are very influential people in the village, Humberto being said to be the next village leader and Samuel always looked for advice and suggestions.
During one of my visits to the Lorenzo household, Samuel said that he wanted to record a speech for me to take with me and use in my dissertation. He said he wanted to speak about the crafts that Kurripakos used to make which is knowledge that is being lost. With this little information he launched into his speech in Kurripako. In spite of the help of both Samuel and Humberto, there are parts that remain unclear which are marked ??. For reasons of space, here I present and analyze grammatically the first third of the speech. The speech in its entirety can be found as Appendix E. In my general remarks, I will refer to the speech as a whole and include the drawing that Samuel Lorenzo made during one of the transcription/translation sessions. The drawing exemplifies the different weaving techniques that are learned. This drawing is included as Appendix E.

As in the song text presented before, there is a predominance of active verbs in
this text. This is unexpected since the main topic of the text seems to be descriptive, yet
most of the text is actually exhortative in calling people into action. There is at least one
active verb in each line, but only five stative verbs throughout this excerpt. The stative
verbs are in lines 10, 18 and 20. Both lines 18 and 20 have two stative verbs each. In line
10, repeated below as (5.4) the stative verb has an interesting morphology.
(5.4) kaakupeli aha likhuite. kaaku -pe -li aha li- khuite speak -PL -REL aha 3.S.NF- dialect “The ones who speak Aha dialect”
The stative verb kaako has a plural suffix –pe and the relativizer –li being used in
a headless relative clause that is understood by the plural marker on the verb. This is a
suffix that is generally used on nouns demonstrating that the class of stative verbs has
some characteristics of nouns and some of verbs as pointed out in chapter 3.

136
In line 18, repeated below as (5.5), there are two stative verbs in predicate position.
(5.5) kokaka hliahni hirapitinaka hliahni kainokadanako faa. kokaka hliahni hirapitina -ka hliahni kaino -kadanako faa Q DEM be.difficult -NOM DEM marry -TEMP 1.PL “something that is difficult when we (masc.) marry”
The first stative verb, hirapitina, is in a relative clause headed by the relative pronoun kokaka and marked as a relative by the nominalizer -ka. It has T/A affixes and follows the structure of predicates. The second stative verb is also a predicate in that it has an independent pronoun, faa, as a subject following it. It also has a temporal suffix which is characteristic of verbs.
In line 20 there are also two stative verbs . This is an interesting digression from the rest of the monologue in that it is an aside in which Samuel is talking to his wife who had suddenly entered the room and begun talking without realizing that Samuel was recording a speech. In this sense, it is a different type of text according to the typology proposed by Ochs (1979). This is repeated here as example (5.6).
(5.6) maakotua phia nanako hnaara, maatsikaotsa limotokao. ma- ako -tua phia na- -naku na- hira maatsi -kaotsa li- moto ka -o PRIV- word -yet 2.S 3.PL- -LOC 3.PL- pull be.bad -FUT 3.S.NF- go out NOM -?? “Don’t talk yet about those. It will come out bad”
The first stative verb, maako, is being used as a predicate in the imperative. The subject follows the verb with and the 2 person singular independent pronoun phia. The second verb, maatsi, is also being used as a predicate. It carries T/A marking with the

137
future marker –kaotsa and it is being followed by a nominalized verb as the subject of the stative verb.
Even though we also have a sparse number of stative verbs on this text, they are all being used as predicates which highlights their argument marking characteristics. Their subjects are in the canonical position for objects of transitive sentences 25, that is following the verb, except in the relativized cases. This is more evidence that stative verbs are sparse yet in this case their use as predicates allow us to see the argument marking structure. This leads us to ask what influence text type has and whether frequency of occurrence needs to be taken into account. This will be addressed when we look at the last text and take all three text types into account.
Other characteristics that are important to point out in this text are related to the intended audience, the topic and the use of Spanish. This text, even though recorded with me the anthropologist as its sole audience, is clearly marked towards another public: fellow Kurripako speakers who have forgotten or are in the process of losing the “Kurripako way of life”. Samuel Lorenzo clearly means this speech to reach a public that goes beyond the one present at the moment of the recording; he intends this speech to reach other Kurripako in different countries. This becomes even clearer when later on he mentions Venezuela, Brazil and Colombia as countries in which indigenous identity is beginning to be valued and in which it is therefore important to maintain an indigenous way of life. This will be more fully explored in chapter 6. The use of Spanish words with Kurripako morphology can be noted in line 11. This is representative of a
25 It is important to note that there is no difference between a relativizer for subject or object so this is not crucial in example (5.4).

138
widespread usage that I noticed during my fieldwork; particularly in evangelical contexts for which there seems to not be an accurate Kurripako equivalent. These are issues that are not evident from elicitation and that can only be grasped by acquiring naturally occurring speech. The last text will also highlight other issues in language acquisition.
5.4 Apada nufen. A grandfather This story was performed at a storytelling festival in Puerto Ayacucho (more
details on the storytelling festival are presented in the next chapter). I was involved at several stages of the performance for several reasons. First, the culture teacher asked my help in producing the transcription and translation of the stories that were going to be presented at the festival because the school did not have a typewriter. For every story that was going to be presented, I typed up a version of the story dictated to me by either the child that was going to present it or the person who originally came up with the story, in this case the mother, Mariluz Blanco, dictated the text. This is presented later. Then, I was asked to help with the search for the costumes and the props to be used. The material for the costumes-- bark cloth-- and the props-- baskets and several body ornaments-- were procured from a Hibi26 village 90 km. away. I also served as audience for practices from the children. Finally, I was asked to attend the festival to help the school with anything that might come up at the last minute.
Unexpectedly, this story won the first place. It was presented by Henry Gabriel Joropa, a 9-year-old boy semi-speaker of Kurripako from Pavoni. His mother, Mariluz
26 The Hibi, also known as Guahibo, are an indigenous group located in Venezuela and Colombia. Their language is classified as Guahiboan.

Blanco, is a speaker of Ehe while his father is a second-language learner of Kurripako.

They speak Kurripako and Spanish at home and switch between Kurripako and Spanish

with their children. The story was transcribed and translated by me by comparing it with

the mother’s dictated version and using Ramirez’s (2001a) dictionary. There were still

some parts that remained as questionable, probably due to the child’s status as a semi-

speaker. These are indicated by ??. As in the previous transcriptions, stative verbs are

bolded

As in the texts presented before, there is a predominance of active verbs in this
text. This can be attributed to the narrative characteristic of the text in which actions are
predominant. There is at least one active verb in each line, but only three stative verbs
throughout the story. One of the stative verbs seems to be used as a nominal modifier
because of the position that it is in, before the noun, but lacks the classifiers that would
signal its modifier function. On the other hand, if we consider it a verbal modifier due to
its lack of suffixes, then the position is odd since it should be placed before the verb. This
is in line 3, repeated here as example (5.7).
(5.7) itu yakaa awakadaliku. itu yakaa awakada -liku go be.far jungle -LOC “(He) went far into the jungle”

142
The two other stative verbs are being used in formulaic phrases: an opening and a closing in lines 1 and 15 repeated here as examples (5.8) and (5.9)
(5.8) Hale waikao nutenai. Hale wa-ikao nu- te -nai sun.rises 1.PL- LOC 1.S- ?? -PL “Good morning my friends”

The stative verb in (5.8) is in a predicate position yet it carries no T/A suffixes. The stative verb in (5.9) is being used as a predicate and the subject is following it. Note however, that there are no verbal suffixes on the verb (this particular verb usually has a restrictive suffix –tsa as in lines 10 and 11 of the song) and there is also no nominalizer on the verb that should be the subject, nukaite. This simplified verbal morphology is a characteristic that points towards the semi-speaker status of this child. Before we address this, let us return to the point left unaddressed in the previous section: the issue of text types and frequency of occurrence of stative verbs.
One issue that remains is whether the scarcity of stative verbs is actually something remarkable. It may be that it is usual for stative verbs to have a low frequency of occurrence in these types of texts and that the occurrences here are nothing out of the ordinary. In order to be able to make claims about frequency and text types, there would need to be a bigger corpus to be able to generalize. Another possible explanation is that the number of stative verbs may be much lower than the number of active verbs and therefore their proportions could be very different. In order to prove this, we would need

143

an extensive lexicon collection. At the moment both types of evidence are lacking, so

this remains for further study.

One more usefulness of this text is to see Kurripako being spoken by a semi-

speaker of the language. When we compare the story as told by the child with the

mother’s version presented below, there are noticeable differences. I will briefly

compare the two versions to shed light on some of the semi-speaker characteristics

present in this story.

First, the child’s version has a dialect mix that is difficult to discern without

knowledge of the various dialects. The child is apparently mixing Aha and Ehe. This is

particularly apparent by three pieces of evidence. The greeting used by the child in line

one, hale waikao, is particularly marked as an Aha greeting. The corresponding Ehe

greeting is hekuapika faa. I am particularly aware of this because even though in

Victorino the majority of the speakers use the Ehe dialect, the household where I stayed

was composed of an Aha speaking mother. She taught me the Aha expression for “good

morning” hale waikao and the very next time that I used it with an Ehe-speaking person,

he laughed and commented on how I was speaking Aha and not Ehe. He then taught me

the Ehe variant. Another Aha characteristic is the child’s use of the phoneme /j/ in the

alternation of /dz/ and /j/. This can be seen in line 14 repeated below as example (5.10)

(5.10) kenso yaawi naka.

khendza yaawi i-

NEG tiger 3.S.FOC- eat -T/A

“The tiger didn’t eat.”[no comió el tigre. ]

These characteristics contrast with the use of the negative ken- as seen in the example above. One of the differences in dialects is the use of the negatives, khen being the one for the Aha dialect and kurri for the Aha dialect. Pavoni, the village where the child lives, is composed of approximately the same amount of Aha and Ehe speakers. So,

146

even though the mother is a speaker of Ehe, as both the negative and the use of /dz/ demonstrates in example (5.11), the child is mixing both.

In terms of the lexicon, there are some vocabulary items that the child does not

include and some that he changes. One item that I believe to be important is the use of

the formulaic opening of a story that the mother uses in line 1 repeated here as (5.12).

(5.12) Apawalipia hekuapi apada nufen.

nu- feri

one –CLF:time -PERF day one –CLF: general 1.S- grandfather

“Once upon a time there was a grandfather” [Había una vez un abuelo]

Instead of this, the child uses a more simplified numeral-classifier combination

and leaves out the noun. This does not have the same effect. This is in line 2 of the

child’s presentation repeated here as example (5.13).

(5.13) Panaya nukaite isru apada nufe inaku

inaku ??

More importantly, there are many grammatical aspects that are being left out,

probably simplifying the speech and making it easier to remember. Particularly

important to issues of argument marking is the total absence of the stative verbs except in

formulaic phrases as presented before and the use of a 2.PL marker i- instead of a 3.S.NF

marker li- in some of the sentences (Lines 2,7,8). I hypothesize that this could be due to

147

the preponderance of this marker used in directives, which is the majority of Kurripako

language use towards the children of this family. Line 7 is repeated here as example

(5.14), which contrasts with the mother’s version, presented as example (5.15).

These texts can offer many more insights into this process, but that goes beyond the goals of this dissertation. It is only my interest here to point out the multiple functions that a collection of texts can serve and hope that these will be addressed elsewhere.

5.5 Usefulness of the text typology proposed by Himmelmann Now that we have looked at the three texts, we can analyze how useful the
typology that Himmelmann (1998) recommends is in this case. Recall that this typology, discussed in Chapter 2, has 2 major dimensions. Himmelmann (1998) has suggested that the parameter of spontaneity in the sense of Ochs (1979) is one that might be useful in setting a typology of communicative events. Using this parameter, five major types of language usage can be placed within a continuum: spontaneous, uncontrolled exclamations; directives; conversations; monologues; ritual speech events. This parameter should be complemented with the parameter of modality which identifies three

148
major single types—signing, speaking and writing—and two cross modal types— speaking/signing, speaking/writing. This would provide a typology of speech events that may guide the acquisition of primary data understanding that a given communicative event may contain segments belonging to different types; that spontaneity correlates with aspects of linguistic structure; and that different modalities are a language specific parameter. In Kurripako, the parameter of modality is not relevant in that very few people actually write and signing is not present. Looking at the parameter of spontaneity, according to Ochs (1979) the song can be considered a ritual speech event, the speech monologue and the story also a monologue. Being that they are of two different text types, we would expect some variation in the correlation to argument structure marking. This seems to be the case, stative verbs in predicate functions being more common overall in the speech and the narrative than the song. Furthermore, if we include the subtype of conversation that happens in the song, then the case for differences in argument structure marking becomes even more salient as in this excerpt the majority of the verbs are stative. However, there is very little conversation that goes on, and this correlation must be taken with a grain of salt lest it be more of an accident than anything else. While this typology may be useful at first, I believe that it must be complemented by ethnographic information.
I do believe that as a pre-ethnographic typology the one proposed by Himmelmann (1998) can be useful. However, I think that this must be complemented by an ethnographically informed typology of speech genres that are significant to the speakers themselves. This can only be done if considerable attention is paid to this

149
particular aspect of speech. An example of this ethnographically informed typology can be found in Sherzer (1983).
It is also important to take into account that when investigating a particular grammatical aspect of the language it is absolutely necessary to complement the data found in naturally occurring speech with elicitation data. Why? Because no matter how large your corpus may be, and given that there are pragmatic constraints in the documentation of endangered languages, there will always be gaps in paradigms that can only be filled through elicitation. Also, there are contrasts that can only be brought to light when elicited. I do not believe that I could have found all the relevant examples used to illustrate the contrasts presented in chapter 4 for argument marking without the use of elicited data. In fact, the majority of the examples used in chapter 4 come from such type of data.
One difficulty that documenters must face when eliciting data for grammatical analysis is the possibility of foreseeing what the relevant contrasts are for a particular grammatical issue. This necessitates that the documenter be informed of current theory and typological issues in order to be able to provide the data needed. However, as theory evolves, so do the questions asked and the data that is needed. It is very difficult to foresee what kind of data may be valuable for future theoretical research and it is here that a large corpus of varied data can be useful while it will most certainly still not have all of the relevant contrasts.

150
5.6 Conclusion I have presented here three texts recorded at the urging of various community
members to serve their own interests. I have shown how they are useful in analyzing particular grammatical points, but also how some grammatical aspects may be dependent on the type of text. In these cases, the predominance of active verbs makes it difficult to see stative verbs being used in naturally occurring speech but also point towards the difficulty of acquiring the active-stative type of argument marking if the exposure to the Kurripako language is limited to particular discourse types such as directives. There are also many other uses that these texts can be put to as part of the documentation of the language and they have been pointed out.

CHAPTER 6 THE CONTEXT OF DOCUMENTATION
6.1 Introduction This chapter addresses the question of why the evangelical Kurripako are
interested now in documenting “traditional” stories, songs, dress and adornments, what they are using them for and how this benefits them. In order to answer these questions, we need to look at various processes that have affected the Kurripako. First, I will describe the evangelization process of the Kurripako and the cultural changes that entailed. Then I will address the legal framework and social changes occurring in Venezuela since 1999 including the context of the indigenous schools. This will lead us to issues of indigenous ethnicity and authenticity. This will then be applied to the texts that were presented in chapter three in order to better understand the significance underlying these texts. Finally how this benefits and is used by the Kurripako will be addressed.
6.2 Evangelization among the Kurripakos Why are these people interested in these texts? To answer these questions, first we
must address why this is knowledge that they no longer have. To do this we must take a look at the evangelization process among the Kurripakos of the Guainia and their later migration into the Puerto Ayacucho area. What follows is information based on several

152
different sources: narratives from collaborators collected in the field, ethnographic data presented by Wright (1998) and historical information collected by Stoll (1982).
According to these sources, Sofia Muller, an American independent missionary, evangelized the Kurripakos single-handedly. She spent around 30 years in the Guainia, from the early 1940s to the early 1970s, and was known to the indigenous population as “la Señorita Sofía¨. She was not affiliated to any particular group, though links have been proposed to SIL/Wycliffe Bible translators by Stoll (1982). She started her work with the Kurripako in Sejal and who themselves evangelized the Puinave, Cubeo and Guayabero. The Puinave evangelized the Piapoco and both evangelized the Guahibo, Cuiva and Saliva (Stoll, 1982). Her teachings closely followed those of the Baptist missionaries but with several key differences. These differences were the insistence on economic independence for the indigenous population and the call for them to separate themselves from the criollo29 population. Sofia Muller portrayed not only the traditional shamanic practices but also the criollos as demons that were to be avoided at all times.
“...the fundamental point of [Muller’s] indoctrination is to convince Indians that any contact ... with the “white” leads to the damnation of their souls... [Arguing] that the highly communal Indian life is what God wants... she always struggles to prevent the Indians from acquiring... the most common vices from among the settlers” (Mattallana, 1976: 51-5,73-4 quoted in Stoll, 1982: 171) Some of the characteristics of her evangelization were a demonization of local shamanic practices and everything related to shamans, the translation of the New Testament into the indigenous language, the prohibition of drinking alcohol, smoking and dancing, the replacement of the seasonal inter-village celebrations by Christian revivals
29 Cirollo refers to non-indigenous people in the Venezuelan amazon context.

153
referred to as “Santa Cena” (Holy Supper) and the incorporation of singing and playing music in the services. This was all carried out in an environment of little tolerance. So much so that both Wright and Stoll describe instances in which the ritual shamanic implements, the rattle and the drug paraphernalia, were cast into the river and the shamans were made to leave the villages. These narratives were also provided by my collaborators along with stories about Sofia as being a savior who brought the word of God to the indigenous population.
All the narratives about Sofia Muller emphasize her linguistic abilities. She is credited with having translated the New Testament into many indigenous languages and having learned even more. According to Stoll (1982:171) she translated the New Testament into three languages and parts of it into eight others. The Kurripakos now have several different versions of the New Testament translated by different people and all of the people that I talked to agreed that the clearest one and easiest to understand was Sofia’s (Muller 1985). She insisted on making the indigenous population into their own missionaries and so trained a number of indigenous people as pastors, deacons and missionaries so that they could practice and evangelize in their own languages. Even today these ranks exists among the indigenous population and in this way they are their own missionaries.
The reasons these religious ideas took such a strong hold among these indigenous people is debatable and is beyond the scope of this dissertation; however, Wright sets forth the argument that these ideologies are very much in line with the millenarian ideologies that already existed among the Kurripako and this is one of the reasons for

154
such a rapid and widespread extension of evangelization. Stoll (1982: 170) shares this idea when he expresses that “... native millennialists could be persuaded that deliverance lay in rejecting tradition for a white woman sent by God to warn them of the end of the world.” The idea that only ideologies that are in line with cultural ideals will succeed has also been set forth by Riviere (1981) as an explanation of the success of the Baptist mission among the Trio of Surinam as opposed to the previous attempts of the Catholics. He also cites as examples that support this thesis the Toba’s embracing of Pentecostal beliefs in Argentina (after the failed attempt of Catholicism and two Protestant missions, one Church of England and the other Mennonite) as well as the success of the Asia Pacific Christian Mission among the Kaluli of Papua New Guinea.
The widespread acceptance of evangelization as practiced by Sofia Muller among the Kurripako led to a series of cultural changes that included the loss of much of the traditional knowledge related to Kurripako religion and religious specialists, as well as those practices that contradicted the evangelical ideals. This included the knowledge of dances, songs and narratives related to the Kurripako traditional worldview and explanations of the world. It is important to understand this as a process not of imposition but of self-determination to the extent that there must have been many ideas that resonated with the Kurripako themselves in order for them to have embraced these ideas and constraints. This in part explains why songs, dances, some traditional stories and information on traditional dress, adornments, body painting and musical instruments have ceased to be transmitted and known by many of the Kurripakos who identify themselves as evangelical Kurripakos or even by those that simply live in predominantly

155
evangelical villages but are not themselves devout. It is also important to note that not all evangelical Kurripakos are the same. There is much variation in the practice of evangelism among the Kurripako, from those that nominally call themselves evangelicals but do not really follow many of the interdictions by which evangelicals are usually identified (no dancing, smoking or drinking) to the very pious practitioners that go to service almost every day.
During the 1970’s and later, in Venezuela there was a migration of Kurripakos from their traditional area in the Rio Negro basin to the Orinoco basin. These migrations are explained in their own words as motivated by accessibility to resources from the state such as education and health. It is clear that this coincides with the oil boom for Venezuela and the nationalization of oil as well as the expansion of services provided by the state with its newfound revenues. Pavoni, one of the villages surrounding Puerto Ayacucho in which I carried out my fieldwork, dates from this time.
One interesting correlation that I have found among the evangelical Kurripakos is that of language and geographical location. In general, in Venezuela the evangelical Kurripakos tend to have a better linguistic maintenance rate than non-evangelical Kurripakos but there is variation that correlates with geographical location as well. The evangelical Kurripakos that live closer to large towns such as Puerto Ayacucho and San Fernando de Atabapo tend to have a lower language maintenance rate than the ones who live farther from these areas. This can be explained by the network of evangelical activities that is formed in nearby areas to these towns. Near these towns, there is much more ethnic diversity and there are various indigenous groups that are evangelical that

156
take part in revivals. Around Puerto Ayacucho this most usually includes Guahibos and Piapokos as well as other non-indigenous people that are also evangelicals. During these revivals, because of language barriers, Spanish tends to be the lingua franca and many of the services and activities are carried out in Spanish. In the Guainia river area, in contrast, these revivals are attended mostly by Kurripakos. In this case, the activities are mainly carried out in Kurripako and very rarely is Spanish used. In spite of the role that religion seems to be playing now in Kurripako language maintenance, there is the potential for this to be reversed. On several occasions I heard some of the Kurripako missionaries, deacons and pastors discussing the need to incorporate more Spanish in the exegesis of the Bible since the Bible is in Spanish whereas there is only a New Testament in Kurripako. In this same conversation they expressed the need to have the Old Testament translated into Kurripako so that all of the word of God would be available to them but at the same time they wanted to have a better command of Spanish to better understand the Bible. Many times I was asked to provide explanations about vocabulary and phrases in Spanish in the Bible without them realizing that the Bible actually contains vocabulary that is opaque to Spanish speakers as well. This ideology that the Spanish Bible is somehow more authentic and provides a better rendition of the word of God may eventually lead to the Kurripako abandoning the services in their own language in favor of Spanish.
The Kurripako, Piapoko and Guahibo are not the only indigenous groups that are evangelicals around Puerto Ayacucho; there is a significant number of Piaroas that are also evangelicals but for some reason they do not engage in these multiethnic revivals.

157
Even though I do not have first hand knowledge of the evangelical services of the Piaroas, from what has been related to me from people who are familiar with them it seems that these services vary significantly from those of the Kurripakos, Piapokos and Guahibos. What evangelicals really are and the variety of Christianity that is practiced by them is an issue that calls for further study; furthermore, the way that different indigenous groups have adopted and now practice evangelism in the North-west Amazon region is a topic that has been little studied.
So the next question is why is there such interest now in traditional knowledge among the evangelical Kurripakos? In order to understand this search, we must understand first the more general context of Venezuela and the changes that have been occurring since 1999 with the rise of Hugo Chavez to power, the constitutional reform and the rights granted to indigenous people and second the immediate context of the Bolivarian schools.
6.3 The Venezuelan context after 1999 When Hugo Chavez Frías rose to power in 1999, many changes were expected.
Chavez, a retired Lt. Colonel who had been imprisoned for his participation in the coup of 1992, won the elections of 1998 with the highest margin ever on a discourse of change and reformation. One of the first steps taken was the dissolution of the Congress and the call for elections for a Constitutional Assembly (Asamblea Constituyente) that would have as its primary responsibility to draft the new constitution. Chavez’s government has been based on a discourse of equality, social justice and reform. Throughout his years in

158
office, he has created and supported a variety of social programs that have targeted the lower sections of society in areas of education, health, employment, and land. I will highlight some of these programs as they seem to impact some of the issues that I will discuss. First, I will present some of the changes in the Constitution that are particularly relevant for the indigenous population.
The Venezuelan constitution of 1999, in contrast to the all of the previous ones, has various articles dedicated to the rights of indigenous peoples and their inclusion and recognition as citizens of the Venezuelan state with particular rights due to their ethnicity. These articles address rights to land, education, self-determination, health, political participation and others. For example, Kurripako and other indigenous languages of Venezuela are officially recognized as the official language in the place(s) in which it is spoken according to the 9th article, which reads:
“Artículo 9. El idioma oficial es el castellano. Los idiomas indígenas también son de uso oficial para los pueblos indígenas y deben ser respetados en todo el territorio de la República, por constituir patrimonio cultural de la Nación y de la humanidad.” (http://www.georgetown.edu/pdba/Constitutions/Venezuela/ven1999.html)
This leads to the recognition of Venezuela as a multilingual and pluricultural state in which the indigenous heritage is considered patrimony of the nation-state and of humanity. What is more important about these changes is the acute awareness that the indigenous people have about their rights as set out in the constitution. During my fieldwork in 2004, many of the indigenous people who I met at different events would talk about their rights as set forth in the constitution and the fact that there was now a

159
whole chapter dedicated to the rights of indigenous people. This would be highlighted particularly in the cases in which land ownership was the main topic, which occurred regularly since during this time there was a move to demarcate the indigenous territories. The circulation of these texts, the constitution articles related to indigenous rights, is interesting to note.
Many of the people do not even cite the articles correctly, they are not sure exactly how many there are or the content of each one but what is more important is the acute awareness that they are there and that this provides them with a legal basis from which to exercise their rights. Some indigenous people actually carry a minuscule copy of the constitution named “la Bichita” by Hugo Chavez and take it out when they refer to their rights as set forth within it, acting as a forceful materialization of these abstract rights that they refer to. In a meeting in Pavoni with one of the representatives of the government institution responsible for land distribution, one of the men stood up, took out his mini-constitution and told the representative that it was stated there that they had the right to their own lands.
It is also important to understand the new changes in the school system that have taken place recently. I will specifically describe the project of Bolivarian Schools as these are the ones that are being developed in indigenous areas.

160
6.4 The Bolivarian Schools One of the programs that Hugo Chavez has supported throughout the country is
the Bolivarian Schools. According to the Ministerio de Educación y Deportes (2003a) (henceforth MED) the objectives of these schools are:
“Brindar acceso y permanencia a la población de Preescolar y Básica (I y II Etapa), de las Zonas Urbano Marginales, Rurales e Indígenas, garantizando una Educación Integral de Calidad.” 30
The project of Bolivarian schools is a policy of the Venezuelan state to confront the current limitations of the school system at the levels of pre-k to 9th grade. The project is integrated within the process of political and social changes that are taking place in Venezuela as of 1999. This project highlights the importance given to education within this process. It started as an experimental proposal that has been gradually extended to include more schools, as of 2003 this kind of school served 616,023 students nationwide. (MED, 2003b). According to the MED (2003a) description, these schools are characterized by an extended school day with implementation and development of innovative pedagogical experiences, meals, extracurricular activities with cultural and sport components consonant with the academic activities and attention to the infrastructure of the school.
In practice, this translates as extra staff, repairs in the buildings, special training sessions for the teachers and a network of schools that participate in cultural and sport festivals. In indigenous areas, the cultural activities are encouraged to incorporate the
30 To provide access and permanence to the pre-k to 9th grade population of the Urban-marginal, rural and indigenous zones in order to guarantee a quality integral education.

161
local indigenous knowledge and to showcase the traditions of the indigenous groups. The school in Pavoni had recently been incorporated to this project (as of the beginning of the 2003-2004 school year). By the middle of the school year, when I began my field work in 2004, this could be seen by the addition of a fully equipped industrial kitchen (that was set up in an old infirmary) along with three paid positions for running it, two more teaching positions that had been assigned to the extracurricular activities, and promises to expand and renovate the school buildings. The school, which ran from pre-school to sixth grade, until then had had four teachers, a principal, a vice-principal, a half-time janitor and an official enrollment of approximately 150 students from three different indigenous groups as well as non-indigenous people coming from five different villages. The teachers were distributed by levels: pre-school to kindergarten, first and second grade, third and fourth grade, and fifth and sixth grade. There were two permanent buildings, the pre-school and a two-classroom structure, and a straw-thatched open wall structure. Classes were run from 8 to 12. The actual attendance was about half of that of the enrollment due to various factors such as transportation problems, lack of notebooks and pencils (which are not supplied by the school), lack of shoes and school uniforms, the need to help in subsistence activities and others. With the implementation of the Bolivarian curriculum, attendance sparked since the prospect of receiving two meals (breakfast and lunch) was a major incentive. It was remarked by the teachers that when there were problems with the delivery of the food (which happened quite often) attendance suffered. Most of the problems that impact school attendance are also targeted by the Bolivarian schools by special distribution of supplies at the beginning of

162
the school year. In October 2004 at the beginning of the new school year, I was witness to the distribution of school uniforms, shoes and personal school supplies during the first parent-teacher meeting of the year. Even though there were not quite enough supplies for all of the students to have everything, every student had at least something. Some students had backpacks filled with notebooks and supplies, others had uniforms and/or shoes. At this same time, a general reorganization of the school was suggested by the Principal and several teaching posts were added with the provision that these were pending approval from the school district and that it might take some time of pro-bono work. Enrollment had slowly increased from the previous year, and therefore there were enough students to request extra teachers. There was a call for high school graduates from the village to supply their Curriculum Vitaes to fill these posts. The proposal was to have one teacher per grade, two teachers in pre-school, and two extra-curricular teachers (one for cultural activities and another for sports). There were just enough recent high school graduates in the village of Pavoni to fill these positions. This increased the number of teachers residing in Pavoni from 2 to 6.
Undoubtedly the panorama and social context in which indigenous people in Venezuela are carrying on their lives has changed significantly in the last 10 years. All in all, it can be said that the changes in the legal framework along with some of the social policies that are now being implemented in indigenous zones have now made it advantageous to be of indigenous ethnicity, as opposed to the past, and there has been an increase in groups seeking the recognition of the state as indigenous groups. In fact, during the Segundo Congreso Nacional de Antropología (Second National Anthropology

163
Conference) held in Mérida, Venezuela in November of 2004 during the panel on demarcation of indigenous lands there were representatives of the Timotes and the Cumanagotos who called for their recognition as indigenous groups and their rights to land to be included in the plans for demarcation of indigenous lands. It is important to keep in mind that indigenous people in Venezuela are not independent nations and therefore do not have sovereignty as is the case in the United States and Canada. So how is indigenous identity defined by the state?
6.5 Indigenous Identity and Authenticity There are two main legal instruments that address this issue: the Ley de
Demarcación y Garantía del Hábitat y Tierra de los Pueblos Indígenas (2001) henceforth LDGHTPI and the Ley Orgánica de Pueblos y Comunidades Indígenas (2005) henceforth LOPCI. According to LDGHTPI (2001) an indigenous person is defined as follows:
“Indígenas: Son aquellas personas que se reconocen a sí mismas y son reconocidas como tales, originarias y pertenecientes a un pueblo con características lingüísticas, sociales, culturales y económicas propias, ubicadas en una región determinada o pertenecientes a una comunidad indígena.”31 In contrast, LOPCI defines an indigenous person as follows:
“Indígenas: Es toda persona descendiente de un pueblo indígena, que habita en el espacio geográfico señalado en el numeral 1 del presente articulo, y que mantiene la identidad cultural, social y económica de su pueblo o comunidad, se reconoce a sí
31 Indigenous people: are those who recognize themselves and are recognized as such; are originally from and belong to a group with its own linguistic, social, cultural and economic characteristics; are located in a particular region or belong to an indigenous village. (translated by author)

164
misma como tal y es reconocida por su pueblo y comunidad, aunque adopte elementos de otras culturas..”32
The definitions remain ambiguous since there is no clear indication as to what happens when the self-identification and the identification of others is not harmonious. While personal identification remains a problem, group identification is already set at 33 different groups that have been continuously identified in various censuses; however what the process is for state recognition of an indigenous group is an issue that remains unclear. If there are various opinions that differ who has the authority to determine who may or may not call him/herself an indigenous person? I will not address this here, since legal indigenous identity is not the focus of this dissertation, but I will remark that for me there is not one factor that can define the identity of an indigenous person as such but a myriad of factors that come together to identify a person as such, including self and other ascription. It is important to note, however, that these definitions allow much flexibility in the identification of a person as indigenous and this fluidity also allows indigenous people to adapt their identification according to the situation.
One phenomenon that occurred in 2004 that is indicative of the struggles of the Venezuelan nation-state in identifying indigenous people is the appearance of identity cards that were different for indigenous people than for the rest of the population. Cédulas de Identidad, the Venezuelan name for the identity cards, are obligatory for all citizens older than 10. They are required for school registration as of the fourth grade
32 Indigenous people: is a person that descends from an indigenous group, lives in the geographical space defined in numeral 1 of this article, and who maintains the cultural, social and economic identity of his/her group or village, recognizes him/herself as an indigenous person and is recognized by his/her group and village even if s/he adopts elements from other cultures. (translated by author)

165
this being the main mode of enforcement of obtaining one. They are essential for every aspect of a Venezuelan’s life and function similar to a driver’s license in the USA. They are the legal proof of identification and are used for voting, for cashing checks, for opening bank accounts, for getting a driver’s license and for every occasion in which proof of your name, your signature or your date of birth is required. In 2004, there was a massive process of “cedulación” in rural and indigenous areas in the wake of the presidential recall referendum. The cédulas that were being supplied to indigenous people were different than the ones the general population had. These not only included the information that the others had (ID number, first and middle name, last names, date of birth, date of issuance, date of expiration, signature, fingerprint, marital status and a photograph) but they also included birth village, residing village and ethnicity. As far as I know, this is the first step that the Venezuelan state has taken in legally identifying members of indigenous groups. What was ironic was that the information was selfreported.
While both definitions presented before rely heavily on self identification and the identification of others, the first one also stresses the fact that an indigenous person must have certain characteristics that set him/her apart from the majority of the population and that are considered as his/her own. I believe that it is this second point, the differing characteristics, that the evangelical Kurripako are trying to stress when they want to document discourses that are no longer circulating among them.
The kinds of discourses that are sought out are those that can easily be recontextualized to fit in particular contexts. These are official, governmental contexts in

166
which the indigenous people are encouraged to showcase their difference and at the same time conform to the nation-state’s imaginery of “the Indians”. As one of the definitions of indigenous people stresses, they are imagined to have their own linguistic, social, cultural and economic characteristics and these are imagined to be very different from the ones that the majority of the population have and know about. The prototypical Indian imagery is met by the Yanomami: fierce, isolated, jungle-dwelling, loincloth-wearing people. People who speak a different language; live in different houses; hunt, fish and collect foods; and in some way are closer to nature and their surrounding environment; the savage other. Indigenous people are not supposed to be white, have blue eyes, wear shoes, dress in clothes, speak Spanish as their native language, or farm for a living; and some indigenous people actually do. As an example of this I can mention that when I was living in Puerto Ayacucho, some friends of my father came to visit and they asked me to show them some “real” Indians, those that went around naked, sniffed yopo33 and lived in communal houses. Were the people that I was working with like that? No. So, in light of these representations it is not surprising that when indigenous people are asked to present their own culture, they look to represent as many of these differing characteristics as possible to fit the imagination of the other and in a certain sense to be an “authentic Indian”.
This situation has been presented in Brazil in relation to different markers. Conklin (1997) argues that during the 1980s and 1990s, the technological, ideological and political developments influenced the construction of the public body images of
33 Hallucinogenic powder made from the seeds of a tree, Piptadenia peregrina. The powder is inhaled by shamans and others for ritual and healing purposes.

167
native activists. According to her, the body became a place of indexing authenticity by the use of feathers, body paint, lip plugs and other paraphernalia which signifies in the eyes of the western audience the “exotic, primitive” other. Indigenous activists played into the ideologies of the westerners in order to gain political voice and representative authority while in some causes forcing them to act inauthentically. As Conklin (1997: 729) points out, “...the symbolic value of Indian cultural identity is bestowed in terms primarily defined by non-indians.” Graham (2002) presents this same situation in relation to language use by indigenous activists. She claims that indigenous spokespeople have four types of linguistic interaction from which to choose from and that each one has advantages and disadvantages, but particularly when he speaks in the dominant language or in a creative mix of both, he carries the risk of being perceived as “inauthentic” and “culturally contaminated” and therefore not representative of indigenous views.
The question of authenticity poses a problem for the evangelized Kurripako because some of their characteristics are not valued as “authentic” enough. The image of a western-clothed, church-going, hymn-singing Kurripako is just not indigenous enough even to the Kurripako who have internalized the idea of the “authentic Indian”. At the first school festival that I attended, one held in honor of Mother’s day, the school from Pavoni presented a dance to techno-merengue music performed by girls dressed in tightfitting western clothes. All of the others schools presented either skits or dances that represented traditional cultural knowledge of their own groups and were presented in their own indigenous languages. One of the comments later presented by the teacher of

168
culture at a teachers’ meeting was how embarrassed she felt that they couldn’t present something that was more representative of Kurripako culture. During this same meeting, while they were discussing what to present at the last school festival of the year, several options were presented and they were all turned down because they were not considered to be indigenous. Among the options considered were a joropo dance34 and a song in Spanish. Both of these options were rejected because they were not Kurripako and it was felt that what they were being asked to present was not just some sort of cultural act but a Kurripako act. It was decided that the culture teacher would come up with some sort of dance and song in Kurripako that reflected more traditional Kurripako culture. This included getting costumes in traditional bark fabric, body adornments and body painting as well as props that reflected indigenous musical instruments and implements (baskets, bows and arrows and blowguns among others). The irony here is that all of these implements, with the exceptions of the body adornments and painting, had to be gotten from other neighboring indigenous groups and were therefore not “authentically” Kurripako.
This is not to be seen as an isolated incident. One of my native speaker collaborators was enrolled in the Bilingual Intercultural Education program at the Instituto Pedagógico Rural "El Mácaro", Universidad Pedagógica Experimental Libertador (UPEL), Programa de Extensión Sociocultural, Extensión Amazonas. She was taking a class about indigenous cultures and was required to be continuously presenting to the rest of the class aspects of her own culture. The compilation of all of
34 Joropo is considered the national folk dance and is mainly a dance of the llanos (plains, a region of Venezuela).

169
this information was to be her final project and made up the majority of her grade for that class. In many cases, she had to go to other non-evangelized villages in order to get the information that she needed because what she was being asked to portray was knowledge that she did not have. For example, she was asked to talk about the dances, the musical instruments that they used and the music that they played. As explained before, music and dance was one of the aspects of traditional culture that Sofia Muller heavily attacked and therefore it is not something that evangelical Kurripakos know about. She would make an effort to seek out this knowledge from other people and obtain miniature representations of the different instruments in order to fulfill the requirements for the class. Sometimes she would even ask me if I had information that could help her. So it was in this context that I would go with these people seeking out other Kurripako that lived in the surrounding areas who could give us this information.
In some cases, the people who knew were recent migrants to the area who were coming from places further inland that had not been evangelized. In other cases, we would seek people that were known to have this knowledge before they had converted to evangelicals. In both cases, it took a lot of coaxing and perseverance to obtain the information since this was usually information that was not shared easily. The evangelized Kurripako were in many cases ashamed to admit that they had taken part in of these practices or that they even knew about them. It was usually retold among whispers of “… but I don’t believe in that anymore nor practice it.” Or sometimes we were told that we could know about it because since now they (the people talking to us) were evangelicals this was not something that affected then anymore; this second claim

170
was usually made about topics of witchcraft, ritual healing and rites of passage. In the next section, I will present the texts and analyze them within the context presented so far.
6.6 The texts Within this context we can better understand the texts and the significance that
they have to the Kurripakos. One of the texts presents the search for information that will present them as authentic Kurripakos, another argues for the revival of certain traditional practices and the third one is an example of how these texts are used and the potential rewards.
One morning, the culture teacher asks me to go with her to record an old woman that she thinks knows some traditional songs in Kurripako. She lives in the village and is known to be evangelical but the teacher believes that presenting me as the interested party in hearing and recording the song will convince the old woman to sing one. As soon as the greetings are done, the teacher asks the woman to sing a song for me in Kurripako and without hesitation the woman did. The song is presented as Text 1 in the previous chapter. As soon as the song is finished, and curious about the original context of the song, the teacher asks her many questions. From this conversation, we learn that the song is a greeting song. It was traditionally sung when groups of people were arriving at a village for a feast. The teacher was interested in many details of this context. The song was performed by groups of people of both genders in greeting the visitors as they were getting out of their canoes at the village’s landing. This reminded

171
me of the same setting in which visitors at revivals are greeted by all of the participants that have already arrived while singing hymns and shaking hands.
The teacher was also interested in knowing many of the details of traditional dress that the people would have been wearing during those festivals. Many of the questions centered around the clothes that they wore, the materials that they were made out of, the kind of ornaments that were used and the types of body paint that were appropriate for each gender. The conversation seemed a quest to gather as much information as possible to be able to reproduce all of the details for the children to appear authentic when performing the song. The woman didn’t seemed to be bothered by this barrage of questions, she gave the information freely, in some cases even drawing on the floor some of the designs that were used for body painting so that there would be no confusion as to the types of drawings that were used. Interspersed in the conversation were some comments in Spanish and some translations of the questions and answers that reaffirmed the old woman that indeed the source of this interest was me. Later, I replayed the song for her and she remarked that it sounded very sad, and that the song was a happy one. That perhaps it was her voice and the fact the she was singing alone that made it sound so sad. I thought that maybe it was the woman’s nostalgia for a past life that made her perceive the song as sad.
When I proceeded to transcribe and translate the song, I ran into some problems. There were some references to some people that nobody really knew. When asking

172
people, the answer generally was that was something the “antigüeros”35 believed in and that they really didn’t know who or what they were. One person said that those were gods, another said that they were demons and yet another that they were angels. Until now I have not been able to locate this figures within the myths that have been published for the Kurripako, nor find a person who has been willing to acknowledge that he knows who they are and explain it to me. One person said that he recognized their names but could not remember very well who they were. I believe that many of the answers given in this fashion respond more to the unwillingness to share information that people recognize as sacred even when they are no longer active practitioners of those beliefs. This parallels the responses to other kinds of questions about ritual healing, rites of passage and myths, yet there must be different levels of knowledge that may be deemed apt to be taught in so far as some of these questions did get answers but generally preceded by some sort of justification for their sharing of it. In fact, there was always one story that was spontaneously offered as soon as the Kurripako name given to my daughter was heard. This story is one that I heard many times, in many versions and differing details that involved Pumeniro, the fragrant girl.
The second text is an example of the acute awareness that some Kurripako have in regards to their indigenous identity and some of the ethnic markers identified by the state. This text is one that is clearly being addressed to other Kurripakos and whose goal is to start a revival of particular practices that are considered traditional and that clearly mark
35 Antigueros is the name that is used to refer to the Kurripakos that are both traditional and set in the past. This reflects the belief that Kurripakos who still today practice traditional forms of ritual healing and religious practices are somehow not as knowledgable as the ones that existed before and therefore not as effective as well.

173
the Kurripako as indigenous people. The emphasis is twofold, on the one hand there are issues related to “way of life” and associated mainly to subsistence activities such as manioc production and processing while at the same time he emphasizes the traditional cultural products that are necessary to carry on these activities, his emphasis being on weaving.
It is not fortitutous that he speaks mainly about weaving, because weaving is a very valuable masculine activity and the Kurripako have a distinct basketry style that is recognized throughout the Rio Negro and the Venezuelan Amazon more generally. One of the issues that Samuel laments in his speech is the fact there are les and less expert weavers nowadays and that if they continue in this way, the Kurripako will soon have no one that can teach their children how to weave. While weaving products were essential for their traditional way of life, now there are other substitutes, mostly plastic, that can work just as easily but that need to be purchased. The most important products for manioc processing that used to be woven are the ones that Samuel mentions in line 17: walayapani (Sp. guapa or shallow basket) tirolipi (Sp. Sebucan or manioc squeezer) and dupitsi (Sp. Manare or manioc sifter). As Meggers (1996) points out, bitter manioc (Manihot esculenta) has to be processed to be eaten because of its poison. This can be done in a variety of ways, all related to extracting the liquid from the tuber. One of the most widespread ways of doing this is to grate the manioc and then use a manioc squeezer to take as much of the liquid out as possible. The resulting compacted flour is then sifted able to make either the manioc bread or the manioc cereal. These implements

174
are therefore indispensable for the survival of the people since manioc is the only staple food that can be harvested year-round.
Why is this a theme that was so salient in Samuel’s mind and that he felt that he needed to share this? There are several answers to this. Days before he urged me to record his speech, a visitor from the Guainia area had arrived at the village bringing with him a bundle of manioc squeezers for sale. Samuel’s household was badly in need of one because the three that they had were about to start falling apart. He had been complaining to me before this how nobody in this village knew how to make the manioc squeezers anymore and that nobody could repair the ones that he had. He did not want to use the alternative method of pressing the manioc in a plastic sack such as the ones used for the distribution of wholesale rice because that supposedly gave the manioc a bad flavor.
Another reason this was so salient was because we had been discussing issues of language maintenance and revitalization and I had been telling him about immersion classes in which the language was being used to teach children both a practical activity related to their own culture and their language. He had exclaimed that if something like this would be done among the Kurripako the best activity would be to teach the children weaving. He had then gone on to say that he, though not a master weaver, did know a few things about weaving and that such a project would be perfect to present and obtain funding for. Therefore, he also stresses in his speech what kinds of weaving styles a weaver learns and in what order and what particular utensils are these styles best suited for. In a way, he is establishing himself as a knowledgeable man capable of taking on a

175
project such as a weaving school but stressing that some sort of salary would need to be found if a teacher was to dedicate himself to this activity with the children. Some months later he asked me to serve as his anthropologist advisor and to look for sources of funding that could help establish a weaving school. I searched the web and the local sources for funding for a project of this kind but did not find anything that was available within the time frame that I was going to be there to help write, submit and support such a project. Weeks later he was already onto another source of funding that he had found available from the local government to encourage local sustainable agricultural practices.
The third text is an example of the contexts in which these texts and the information they provide are then used. One of the extracurricular cultural activities mentioned before is the school festivals that are held for every major holiday and that bring together a group of neighboring schools. Occasionally there might also be other special activities that gather a much larger number of Bolivarian schools from a given area. The storytelling festival in which Text 3 was presented is an example of one of these activities.
In June 2004 there was a storytelling festival for children enrolled in the Bolivarian schools of the Puerto Ayacucho area. The stories were told during two days, the first day was in Spanish and the second in indigenous languages. The school from Pavoni sent five children to participate in this festival telling stories in their own indigenous languages. Of these five children, four spoke in Kurripako and one in Piapoko. During the indigenous language day, approximately 45 children from 9 schools participated speaking in 4 indigenous languages: Kurripako (Arawak), Piapoko

176
(Arawak), Guahibo (Guahiboan), Piaroa (Salivan). This festival was the brainchild of a librarian of Puerto Ayacucho and was sponsored by the Red de Bibliotecas Públicas (network of Public Libraries) and Gobernación del Estado Amazonas (Government? Of Amazonas State). In both categories, Spanish and Indigenous languages, there were significant cash prizes offered for first, second and third place. I attended the festival during the indigenous languages day at the urging of the school from Pavoni and also curious to see and hear what kind of stories would be presented and how the children would adapt stories to this unique situation which is not common for Amazonian cultures. There were all kinds of stories and performances there, as would be expected from an event that is being held for the very first time. There were three judges who were Piaroa, Guahibo and Kurripako and were fluent speakers of their own language. Very clear guidelines had been given to the schools regarding the judging system and yet many children did not take this into account in their presentations. The children’s performances were judging based on five criteria: presentation, diction, costume, acting, and overall impression. The wining story was presented by a 9-year-old boy semi-speaker of Kurripako from Pavoni.
It is ironic that contest designed to reward children for their speaking abilities was won by a boy who is not fluent in Kurripako. This actually became a source of encouragement for many of the children of the village in later days, and the envy of those that were fluent speakers. The key to his winning was the attention to detail that was paid in every aspect of the judging criteria, details that highlighted many of the aspects of an “authentic Indian”. The boy was barefoot, dressed in a loincloth along with anklets and

177
bracelets of cotton and feathers, painted with traditional Kurripako designs on his face, wore necklaces of beads and teeth and a headdress of feathers. He spoke very slowly and clearly, included many onomatopoeias in his speech and was careful to accompany every aspect of the story with movements that described what the words were saying. In this way, the audience could follow the story without needing to actually understand the language used. Also, the story was short and simple: a man who goes out hunting with his dog encounters a jaguar and his dog helps distract it while he runs away (for a more detailed account see the text, glossing and translation in the previous chapter). His performance earned him perfect marks, the first place and a prize of Bs. 400,000 (approx. $200, minimum wage is $75 per month). The prize money was awarded at a public ceremony by the Governor of the State and was covered by the local radio and TV. This prize money later caused much trouble in the village since the teacher who took the children to the festival felt that the prize should be shared with the school in order to buy resources that were needed for extracurricular activities such as more cloth for costumes, props and a tape-recorder but the parents of the boy felt that it was theirs since they had spent so much time, energy and resources on the costume and rehearsing the story.
This festival is significant at various levels. It provides children who are speakers or learners of indigenous languages a public venue in which the use of their language not only is well looked upon, but also can be rewarded significantly. It also provides nonindigenous people with the possibility of appreciating these languages in a different context and seeing that these languages can also serve as rich vehicles of communication. The festival also encourages the use of indigenous languages and is developing a genre

178
that is not usual among Amazonian societies: the performance of stories by children. This genre is one that will be shaped by the winning stories and that will emerge and change as different stories win; it is also shaped by the judging criteria. For example, there was one story told by a Kurripako speaker that was received amongst much laughter and that seemed to be very funny. The boy seemed to be performing very well, was acing it out, moved throughout the area for presentation, was speaking very clearly and overall seemed a very good performance. I was very puzzled not to see this story among the winners and when I asked other Kurripako speakers I was told that the story contained many sexual innuendos and connotations and that therefore it was inappropriate for this setting. Much of the audience did not understand Kurripako, being outnumbered by far by Piaroa and Guahibo speakers, and this was a puzzle for many of them as well. Yet, when some people complained and they received the same explanation that I did, they perfectly understood.
In sum, these texts are significant to the speakers of Kurripako and were recorded at the urging of particular speakers. They are the product of particular socio-historical processes that have taken place in Venezuela since 1999 and as such they are not only instances of Kurripako language use but also embody particular circumstances and meanings. What exactly these meanings are is addressed in the next section.
6.7 The value of being an authentic “Indian” before others The identity of the Kurripako as an indigenous group is not one that is being
contested. From this point of view, as a group they have been sufficiently documented

179
and described as to secure their place among the indigenous groups of Venezuela. However, the individual recognition of a particular Kurripako person or village as “Indian” is another story. I have already presented some of the legal rights and resources that indigenous people have access to due to their ethnicity. This is what is at stake when an indigenous person’s identity is questioned.
In order to avoid this questioning, clear-cut boundaries and the showcase of ethnic markers is sought after. The problem is that this has to be achieved at two levels: within the indigenous groups and in contrast to non-indigenous groups. So on the one hand, Kurripakos have to present themselves as different from Piapokos, Guahibos, Piaroas, Yanomamis etc; while at the same time they have to present themselves as similar enough to be all grouped as “Indians”. It is in this dilemma that the Kurripakos make use of the essentialization of indigenous people vis-à-vis non-indigenous people, as Graham (2002) argues while they continuously reinvent themselves as different from the other indigenous groups while incorporating changes such as evangelization. While it is undoubted that language plays a significant role in defining indigenous ethnicity in the eyes of the non-indigenous majority, it is arguable the extent to which language is one of those essential ethnic markers within indigenous groups. Among the groups that still speak their native languages, there are some groups to which it is essential, and language in itself and above everything else defines ethnic membership, where as there are others that do not hold language as essential.
An example of the first kind of group is the Yanomami. According to Kelly (2004) the Yanomami oppose themselves to others, most significantly to pore “spirits”

180
and nape “whites”, by the use of language; language as defined by the use of Yanomami language and its varieties. Once a non-Yanomami learns to speak the language, s/he essentially becomes a Yanomami for all purposes of categorization. Kelly (2004 pc) recounts the time when a Yanomami identified him as Yanomami because of his linguistic abilities. For the Yanomami, the process of becoming human, that is Yanomami, is a linguistic one. In contrast, the Kurripako do not give as much importance to language nowadays36. They identify people as Kurripako not by the fact that they can or cannot speak the Kurripako language, but rather how they can establish a kinship and residence relationship to the Kurripako group. Language in itself does not suffice to categorize a person as Kurripako yet it also does not preclude one from being Kurripako. Language is not one of the ethnic markers that is more problematic for Kurripakos as a group since there are still enough speakers to provide a critical mass yet other characteristics that are indexed as “Indian” in the national majority do pose a problem.
Just as Graham (2002) has argued for language becoming a second-order index for “Indianness” among indigenous activists in Brazil, I will argue that traditional dances, songs and dress have become second-order indices of “Indianness” for Kurripakos in light of the prototypical Indian images of non-indigenous people. These indices are then needed to be recognized as belonging to that ethnic group of indigenous people, while it is not essential to belonging to the ethnic group of Kurripakos. This leads to the
36 I do not intend to say that this has always been so. This might be the product of the language shift in T/Aress in the last 30 years.

181
presentation of these indices in the contexts in which their indigenous identity is at stake, and to the search for these indices to justify their ascription to this ethnicity.
In accumulating these expressions of “Indianness”, the Kurripakos are accumulating symbolic capital as Bourdieu (1977) presents. This symbolic capital then helps them obtain economic capital as is evident from the outcomes of the storytelling festival and the salaries and infrastructure that the village obtains by being in a Bolivarian school. The documentation of “traditional” genres by the part of the school teachers can be seen as reaction to the new legal context and social processes taking place in Venezuela. In so far as it is now necessary to prove indigenous ethnicity and play to the imagination of the non-indigenous population, the evangelical Kurripakos are very efficient.
6.8 Conclusion This chapter addressed the question of why the evangelical Kurripako are
interested now in documenting “traditional” stories, songs, dress and adornments, what they are using them for and how this benefits them. I claim that this is a consequence of having to represent themselves to the non-indigenous majority as “authentic Indians” in order to have access to the newly-appointed resources for indigenous people. The need for documentation stems from the fact that this information has been partially lost due to the evangelization process. On the other hand, due to the constitutional changes and the recognition of specific rights indigenous people, it is now necessary for the indigenous groups to represent themselves as authentically Indian. This particularly happens in the

182
school setting in which indigenous identity is seen as beneficial and having the right to many extra resources. I finally argue that these expressions are then coined as secondorder indices of Indianness in the imagination of the non-indigenous population and the Kurripako benefit from expanding their symbolic capital and gaining economic capital by using this symbolic capital.

CHAPTER 7 CONCLUSIONS Through this dissertation I have shown several different aspects of a language documentation project using my own language documentation project among the Kurripako of Venezuela as an example. I do not mean by this that my project is one that exemplifies what a language documentation project should be like; it is mainly my starting point from which to reflect about language documentation. In fact, the Kurripako language documentation project is far from being finished, even though the funding that permitted this initial stage is. It is now time to evaluate partial results and to learn from the experiences so that new paths can be traced from each chapter. In Chapter 2, I presented how language documentation is a relatively new activity within linguistics even though the foundations for it are as old as the discipline itself. This activity is intimately linked to issues of language endangerment and the belief that many languages will disappear within the next hundred years without leaving a record from which to study them and be studied by their own people. This is the fundamental impetus in the creation of the field of Documentary Linguistics, a field that needs to be recognized as independent though not exclusive from Descriptive Linguistics. Documentary linguistics is a data driven collection of records of a language serving multiple purposes and a variety of users in a lasting format. As such, there are many interests and concerns to be able to fully develop a documentation of a language. My own documentation project among Kurripako speakers has led to me to gain valuable insights into the workings, limitations and rewards of such an endeavor. It has become clear to me that documentation is a long-term project that necessitates the incorporation

184
of a multiplicity of agents, researchers and community members alike, in order to be able to meet the interests of every party involved. It is clear from this chapter that more time is needed to be able to evaluate whether Himmelmann’s proposal is viable and useful. One particular point is the usefulness of this model to speakers and learners of the language. Until this has been put to test, there is no way to ascertain this.
In Chapter 3, I presented details about the Kurripako language and its speakers. Kurripako is an Arawak language spoken in the Northwest Amazon in Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. There are many different names in the literature that are being used to refer to the same ethnolinguistic group. Some of these names refer to sibs within the group in Kurripako and in Nheengatú, exonyms and ethnonyms, place names and words that include the words for yes and no in the different dialects. The general consensus nowadays is that this is a language continuum that needs to be further studied to clearly delimit the dialect differences. Identifying this continuum as one language has not always been the case, as exemplified by the different ways in which many of the name variants have been used in internal Arawak classification. I use the name Kurripako to refer to this language group and identify the dialects by the words used for yes and no in the same fashion that my native speaker collaborators did. The data for this dissertation comes mainly from the Ehe-Khenim dialect. Kurripako has few characteristics that set it apart from the rest of the language family. It is an agglutinative language. The orthography used in this dissertation differs somewhat from the others used in published sources because of the problems that all these present. It is clear from the data presented that more comparative studies among the dialects is a must. These studies must address not

185
only phonology and lexicon, but incorporate morpho-syntax and discourse. Issues of dialect contact are also in need of development and these would benefit from tracing the geographical movement of the populations.
In Chapter 4, I have provided data that presents the argument marking structure of the Ehe-Khenim dialect of Kurripako. Transitive verbs have prefix markers that agree with the Agent. Patients are marked mainly by word order except for a small set of third person forms. Intransitive verbs can have two different structures. One set takes the same prefix markers as the transitive verbs do for marking agreement with the Subject while another set uses the same marking strategy as patients of intransitives. This division generally follows a semantic condition of active and stative but morphological derivation must also be taken into account. There seems to be only one prefix slot in verbs and when this is filled by any other element the subject is then marked as patient. There is also a very small set of verbs that take a dative subject. What remains to be clarified in this grammatical aspect is the conditions for the different third person active object and stative subject markings (suffix or (pro)noun). It is obvious that there are many other grammatical aspects that need to be addressed in detail in this language; for example, and closely linked to issues of active and stative verbs since there is typological correlation between these phenomena, the tense and aspect system need much more study.
In Chapter 5, I presented three texts recorded at the urging of various community members to serve their own interests. I described how they are useful in analyzing particular grammatical points, but also at pointing out how some grammatical aspects

186
may be dependent on the type of texts. In these cases, the predominance of active verbs makes it difficult to see stative verbs being used in naturally occurring speech but also point towards the difficulty of acquiring the active-stative type of argument marking if the exposure to the Kurripako language is limited to particular discourse types such as directives. One question arises from the use of these different types of texts in relation to the textual typology proposed by Himmelmann based on Ochs. In this case, the song, speech and story did not evidence particular differences in the use of stative and active verbs. It may be that they are not different enough to exhibit this particular grammatical difference and that other types of texts are needed to see this. A collection of all of the different types would shed light on whether this typology is actually useful in seeing a phenomena like this one or whether a different typology needs to be thought of. This would help in establishing a theoretical perspective from which to base a collection a texts for language documentation. Other grammatical points would need to be tested as well to see whether different grammatical aspects are bound to different kinds of texts and whether these aspects cluster in some significant way.
In Chapter 6, I addressed the question of why the evangelical Kurripako are interested now in documenting “traditional” stories, songs, dress and adornments, what they are using them for and how this benefits them. I claim that this is a consequence of having to represent themselves to the non-indigenous majority as “authentic Indians” in order to have access to the newly-appointed resources for indigenous people. The need for documentation stems from the fact that this information has been partially lost due to the evangelization process. On the other hand, due to the constitutional changes and the

187
recognition of specific rights indigenous people, it is now necessary for the indigenous groups to represent themselves as authentically Indian. This particularly happens in the school setting in which indigenous identity is seen as beneficial and as having the right to many extra resources. I finally argue that these expressions are then coined as secondorder indices of Indianness in the imagination of the non-indigenous population and the Kurripako benefit from expanding their symbolic capital and gaining economic capital by using this symbolic capital. This chapter clearly leaves many issues for further study. One of these would be to look into the similarities and differences between evangelized and non-evangelized Kurripako. Given that there are significant differences in language maintenance rates as briefly described in chapter 3, it would be interesting to see how this affects these different populations given the same state context. It would also be interesting to compare other evangelized indigenous groups to see how much religion is actually an influence in the representation of identity. Cross-cultural comparisons with other indigenous groups of different linguistic and religious characteristics would complement the views expressed in this chapter and demonstrate the importance of context in language documentation.
Overall, this is but just the beginning of a much larger endeavor. There more questions that came to light and that remain to be answered than issues that have been provided with an answer. It is my hope that this will also encourage others to tackle some of these questions.
