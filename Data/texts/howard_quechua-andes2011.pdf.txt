The Quechua Language in the Andes Today: Between Statistics, the State,
and Daily Life
Rosaleen Howard
This chapter offers a comparative examination of the situation of the
Quechua language1 in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia in the present day, taking into account the historical processes that have led to the similarities and differences to be observed. It is divided into three main sections: (i) a discussion of the statistics on numbers and distribution of speakers; (ii) a review of language policy in the three States, with particular reference to issues of language related identity politics and language rights; and (iii) an illustration of the ways in which processes of language contact have impacted upon the forms of the language as used in daily life, by means of a brief case study from each country. I then close with some critical reflection on the relationship between these three levels of analysis.
Introduction
The many variant forms of the Quechua language are spoken across the Andean region of South America, from southern Colombia, through highland and lowland Ecuador, parts of northern, central and southern Peru, highland Bolivia, and parts of northwest Argentina.2 In relations of mutual influence with both Spanish and the other main Andean language, Aymara, Quechua gives shape to a heterogeneous range of sociolinguistic fields that defies generalized description. Marlene Haboud for Ecuador,3 Andrés Chirinos Rivera for Peru,4 and Xavier Albó for Bolivia,5 have gone far in describing this sociolinguistic variability based on a blend of quantitative and qualitative research findings, including the outcomes of censuses and surveys. Hornberger and Coronel-Molina offer a broad and detailed overview of the status of the languages from the

perspective of the sociology of language,6 while Howard analyzes qualitative (interview) data from the three core Quechua-speaking countries of Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia.7 More recently, Andrade Ciudad provides an overview of the situation of the indigenous languages in Peru, including Quechua, in light of the 2007 census in that country;8 while Plaza Martínez offers a grammatical sketch of the Quechua of Chuquisaca and Northern Potosí (Bolivia), based on hitherto unpublished field data.9 The variety and complexity of the sociolinguistic scenarios in which Quechua is spoken is due to grammatical and lexical variability, the range of language contact features that arise, and the diversity of social contexts in which it is found.
In this chapter, I shall discuss the present-day sociolinguistic situation of Quechua with particular reference to highland Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.10 While Spanish predominates among the upper and middle classes, in urban settings, and in coastal regions, and Quechua is more prevalent among rural agriculturalists, as far as highland zones are concerned there is not always a clear-cut class-based rural-urban dichotomy between Spanish and Quechua-speaking populations. In the highlands, the relative social and geographical distribution of the two languages grew ever more complex from the colonial period onward. Due to the formerly feudal land tenure system and associated labor structure, as well as eventual trade and intermarriage, relations between Spanish and Quechua-speaking sectors became increasingly intertwined over the centuries. While Quechua monolingualism persisted in the countryside, Spanish-Quechua bilingualism among the landowning and provincial urban classes was a growing phenomenon, at least up to the Agrarian Reform period of the mid-twentieth century. Since then, with the acceleration of rural to urban migration, Quechua speakers have increasingly shifted to Spanish, or relatively stable Quechua-Spanish bilingualism has evolved. Thus, broadly speaking, Quechua today spans various social classes and is spoken in both rural and urban settings.
At one end of the scale, Quechua monolingualism prevails in some areas of Peru and Bolivia among indigenous campesino sectors. By contrast, in Ecuador, where Quechua is called “Quichua,” the indigenous class is characterized by Quichua-Spanish bilingualism. Mestizos in Ecuador, despite living in close proximity to Quichua-speaking populations, are primarily Spanish monolingual. In Peru and Bolivia, on the other hand, various permutations in use of the two languages constitute a range of class identities. In the department of Cuzco, for example, while Quechua monolingualism prevails in highland provinces such as Paruro and Chumbivilcas (as the statistics will show), in provincial capitals such as Ocongate bilingualism is a component of mestizo identity,11 in a way similar to the town of San Pedro de Buenavista (central Bolivia) as studied by Howard-Malverde.12

Cuzco city offers another permutation, as this is the home of the High Academy of the Quechua Language of Cuzco (Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua del Qosqo, AMLQQ), founded in the early 1950s. The Academy’s members are bilingual, urban dwelling, and culturally mestizo. In many cases, their families descend from the landowning classes of the hacienda era. Self-styled “cultivators” of the Quechua language (they use the term “cultor”),13 the “Académicos” promote the language by producing literary works, dictionaries, and grammars in Quechua, and teaching classes in the university. Many of them hold strong views on linguistic correctness, cultivating a puristic form of Quechua that tolerates none of the Spanish lexical and syntactic influences to be found in the spontaneous speech of the rural Quechua speaker. This purism informs a historically rooted ideology of “Incanism” bound up with a concern to affirm regional cultural authority as guardians of the language, protecting it both from the “barbarisms” of the rural speaker (the term is theirs)14 and the scientific opinions of university trained linguists from Lima.15
In Cochabamba city, the range of urban identities is marked by the use of Spanish, Quechua, or a combination of the two. On the one hand, the mixed Spanish-Quechua speech (so-called quechuañol) can be heard among the traders of the city’s extensive street market and in peripheral residential areas.16 On the other hand, a more self-conscious academic Quechua is spoken by the Spanish-Quechua bilingual members of Cochabamba’s Quechua Language Academy (affiliated to Cuzco’s AMLQQ), who, again, tend to descend from families who had their base in the Quechua-speaking provinces in previous generations, and some of whom teach the language in secondary and higher education.17

The Quechua Language in Current Statistics
Censuses are only an approximate indication of actual numbers and distribution of speakers for a number of reasons, for example, the fact that stigma attaches to the speaking of an indigenous language in some contexts, and the fact that the ability to speak the language is not put to the test by census takers. As Albó has remarked, census responses may well reflect the attitudes of speakers rather than actual linguistic competencies.18 Table 8.1 gives figures for numbers of Quechua speakers by country based on the latest censuses. With the exception of Bolivia in 1992 and 2001, as we shall see later (Tables 8.5 and 8.6), censuses have not been designed to reveal the proportion of indigenous language monolinguals to speakers bilingual with Spanish, although, using survey data from other sources, it is possible to extrapolate estimated figures on bilingualism, as Haboud has done for Ecuador.19
Table 8.2 shows that for Peru, going by the 2007 census, around 13 percent of the population over five years of age learned Quechua as a

mother tongue, a drop of about 3 percent since 1993. However, in terms of absolute numbers there was a rise of nearly 100,000 speakers over the intercensus period.
Andrés Chirinos Rivera’s analysis of the 1993 Peruvian census gave a breakdown of numbers of speakers of Quechua and Aymara by department for Peru. Percentages of Quechua speakers ranged from 0.2 percent in Piura to 76.6 percent in Apurímac. Working from the 2007 census, Andrade Ciudad notes that Apurímac remains the department with the highest proportion of speakers, although this has dropped to 60 percent. The department of Cuzco leads in terms of absolute numbers (566,585) amounting to 46 percent. While the department of Lima has a low number of Quechua speakers in percentage terms (5.5 percent) it is worth noting that in terms of absolute numbers it is second only to Cuzco (477,014 speakers).20
Table 8.3 gives an example of the high rates of Quechua mothertongue speakers to be found in some highland provinces, here the case of Chumbivilcas (department of Cuzco) according to the 1993 census. The failure of the census to measure bilingualism means that we cannot read rates of Quechua monolingualism from the table alone; my own

observations in the field allow me to suggest that this was extensive, however. 21
To take another example, field research in Tantamayo (Huamalíes province, department of Huánuco) (Table 8.4) going back to the early 1980s enables me to compare language distribution and use in that period with the present, based on firsthand observation. Residents of the town were everywhere Spanish-Quechua bilingual, 25 years ago, while bilingualism in the countryside was rare and Quechua monolingualism common. By the time of the 1993 census, the level of Quechua use had fallen away due to massive out migration provoked by Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) and army presence in the valley in the intervening period. Bilinguals came increasingly to suppress their use of the language, and not to transmit it to the younger generations.22 Despite this trend, Table 8.4 indicates a 50:50 balance between Spanish and Quechua mother-tongue speakers in Tantamayo. Again, as the Peruvian census lacks data on bilingualism, the figures on numbers of Quechua speakers are certainly conservative.
Of the countries under discussion, Bolivia has excelled in its last three censuses in the relative usefulness of questions posed about languages spoken. In particular, in 1992 and 2001 resulting data sets give us breakdowns on monolingualism and bilingualism, and 2001 results give insight into variables of gender, place of residence and identity self-ascription. Tables 8.5 and 8.6 are adapted from Molina and Albó’s analysis of the 2001 census results.23 Table 8.5 gives a differentiated breakdown of the figures for Spanish, Quechua, Aymara, Guaraní, and “other native languages,” and “foreign languages.”
Here, the total percentages per language add up to over 100 percent due to the fact that any individual may speak more than one language. In many parts of the country bilingualism between Spanish and an indigenous language is common; trilingualism is also a feature, for example in

the north of Potosí department and in Oruro department, where many people speak Quechua, Aymara, and Spanish.24 Table 8.6 gives the figures on monolingualism and bilingualism respectively.
This table makes clear that in 2001 the country was divided 50:50 between Spanish monolinguals and those who spoke an indigenous language with or without Spanish in addition. From 1976 to 1992 the trend was toward increased bilingualism with Spanish and a concomitant dip in native language monolingualism; from 1992 to 2001 there was a drop of almost 10 percent in bilingualism with corresponding rise in Spanish monolingualism. Nonetheless, over the latter period native language monolingualism remained steady in percentage terms. This may be partly due to rise in population numbers and increased geographical reach in census taking. However, it is interesting to note that the 1992 to 2001 period in Bolivia coincided with the years (1994–2003) when education policy for indigenous children in rural areas focused on Bilingual Intercultural Education (Educación Intercultural Bilingüe, EIB) under

the terms of the 1994 Education Reform. EIB fostered the use of indigenous languages in the classroom, both as languages of instruction and as a subject to be studied alongside Spanish. It could be that the EIB era helped to stabilize native language use among primary school children in rural areas, while other social and economic factors (especially rural to urban migration) encouraged shift to Spanish among the middle age bands (i.e., the most economically active and mobile sectors of the population). The figures also need to be set in the context of the urban-rural distribution of the indigenous languages in Bolivia, which has evolved in a surprising way over the same period, as shall now be seen.
The usefulness of the 2001 Bolivian census also lies in the fact that it asked questions about ethnic identity. The question, asked only of people over 15 years of age, “Do you consider yourself to belong to one of the following originary peoples?” (“¿Se considera perteneciente a alguno de los siguientes pueblos originarios?”) gave a choice of answer between Quechua, Aymara, Guaraní, Chiquitano, Mojeño, Other, None. The response threw up a total of 62 percent self-identifying as indigenous. If we take this figure in conjunction with the 49.3 percent of the population over the age of five who claim to speak an indigenous language (Table 8.6), it becomes clear how self-ascribed ethnic identity and linguistic repertoire are not in direct correlation. To consider oneself indigenous in Bolivia does not necessarily mean that one speaks an Amerindian language. Conversely, many of the middle class (i.e., “nonoriginary”) Spanish-Quechua bilinguals found in Bolivian towns and cities do not consider themselves indigenous in the sense of “Indian,”25 as is also the case in Peru.26 In Ecuador the case is different again, in so far as those who self-ascribe as indigenous are predominantly QuichuaSpanish bilingual,27 while, as already noted, criollo and mestizo sectors are predominantly Spanish monolingual.

Another important finding of Molina and Albó has to do with the geographical distribution between rural and urban areas of those who consider themselves indigenous in Bolivia. Since the Agrarian Reform in the mid-twentieth century there was an accelerated move by the nonindigenous minority from their reduced land bases to the cities; it is not therefore surprising that in 2001, 79.2 percent of this demographic group are found to live in urban areas. The surprise finding in 2001 was that the majority (55.6 percent) of those who consider themselves indigenous were also found to live in towns and cities.28 The scale of this phenomenon reaches its height in the city of La Paz, where 61.1 percent of the population considers itself to belong to a “pueblo originario.”29
In Bolivia, the Andean languages are widely heard in urban settings. The marketplaces and peripheral residential areas of cities such as La Paz, Cochabamba, and Potosí provide vital spaces where they thrive. As Sichra observes: “The city of Cochabamba is marked by being tenaciously and persistently bilingual, despite the constant shift to Spanish that the indigenous languages suffer here as in the country in general.”30 This is in marked contrast to Lima where migration from the highlands triggers sweeping Quechua language loss.31 Geography is obviously a factor here. Bolivian cities are in the heartland of the Quechua and Aymara-speaking areas; the need and opportunity to keep the languages alive is facilitated by proximity to the rural areas. I believe it also has to do with the fact that migration of Quechua speakers into Bolivian cities has accelerated since the beginning of the nineties, when the indigenous social movements were gathering momentum and the stigma attached to speaking the language was beginning to lessen. It is also the case that many Aymara-speaking people (for example in the city of El Alto) have double residence, straddling both urban and rural areas, a factor not taken into account in the census, possibly causing inflation of the figures.32
The numerical survival of the Andean languages up until and through the greater part of the twentieth century, as revealed by the statistics, may be explained by a series of factors: geographical isolation of the communities of speakers due to topography and poor communication infrastructure; poverty; lack of formal education in rural areas beyond the first few grades; illiteracy; and lack of opportunity for urban migration. Furthermore, the interrelatedness of these factors is confirmed by a number of sources. In the case of Peru, for example, in the ten provinces with the highest poverty index and the lowest child development index, 83 percent of the population are speakers of an indigenous mother tongue.33 Poverty seems to directly correlate with speaking the language; leaving the language behind is seen as a means to step out of poverty. As far as illiteracy is concerned, Godenzzi notes that “the departments with a higher number of Quechua speakers ( . . . ) have very high percentages of illiteracy.” Against a national illiteracy rate of 12.8 percent

Ch08.indd 196

QUECHUA L ANGUAGE IN THE ANDES TODAY

197

among the population over 14 years of age, in Apurimac and Ayacucho this reaches 36.9 percent and 32.7 percent respectively; in provinces such as Chumbivilcas where the percentage of Quechua mother-tongue speakers reaches over 90 percent (Table 8.3), illiteracy is around 44 percent.34 It can also be noted that during Peru’s internal war that ran for 15 years from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s the most badly affected departments were these same poverty-stricken regions with high indices of speakers of indigenous languages (departments of Ayacucho and Huánuco); 75 percent of those who were murdered or disappeared during the conflict were indigenous language speakers.35
At the same time, developments in the social, economic, and political spheres over the mid- to late-twentieth century gave impetus to change: agrarian reform, the universalization of education in rural areas, and increased migration being the principal among them, as Sichra observes:

After agrarian reform, bilingualism in the Andean region is no longer an attribute of the landowners (hacendados) who, while being of mestizo origin, had settled in the countryside. It now becomes the result of the growth of migratory trends towards the city ( . . . ) as well as the outcome of the expansion of the education system and mass communications in the rural areas, which directly affect the indigenous population.36
The factors ensuring survival of the autochthonous language were increasingly viewed as obstacles to be overcome by parents aspiring for opportunities for their children beyond the rural sphere. While in the case of Cochabamba and some other highland towns bilingualism may have resulted from development, in other contexts full-scale shift from the indigenous mother tongue to Spanish became part of the transformative process.37
In sum, going by the censuses of the last two decades, despite the loss of Quechua speakers in overall terms,38 in some areas the absolute numbers of speakers remain constant and have even risen due to population increase. Nonetheless, in percentage terms the community of speakers is clearly on the decline. In addition, the fact that the language’s survival into the present has long been explained in terms of negative social indicators (poverty, illiteracy, poor infrastructure), with the corresponding negative impact on attitudes toward speaking it, has to be taken as a threat to its survival into the future. Since the 1990s, however, the state has stepped in more proactively to improve educational provision for indigenous children. This in turn has entailed language-planning initiatives aimed at raising the status of the indigenous languages in the minds of speakers and nonspeakers alike, with some degree of success.

The Role of the State in Guiding the Fate of the Quechua Language
Legal Instruments
In this section I shall review some developments in state languageplanning policy from the turn of the 1990s. In that decade, the changing geopolitical landscape in Europe, democratization underway in Latin America, the 1989 International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention 169 on the rights of “Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries,” and the 1992 Columbus Quincentenary as a focus for the indigenous social movements, all made up the conjuncture for constitutional reform on the part of the Andean States, whereby, for the first time in post-Conquest history, political constitutions took account of the linguistic and cultural diversity of their subject populations. Thus, for example, the 1993 Peruvian Constitution declares that “all Peruvians have a right to their ethnic and cultural identity. The State recognizes and protects the ethnic and cultural plurality of the Nation. All Peruvians have the right to use their own language before any authority through the medium of an interpreter.”39 Bolivia and Ecuador followed suit with Constitutional Reforms in 1994 and 1998 respectively. It was only in the new millennium, however, that legislation began to appear that might support the idea of linguistic rights for speakers of indigenous languages in practice.
In Bolivia, Supreme Decree 25894 passed on September 11, 2000 recognized the majority of the nation’s originary languages (“lenguas originarias”) as “co-official.”40 However, a Decree does not carry the weight of a full-fledged law. By contrast, in 2003 the Peruvian Congress approved a Language Law (“Ley de Lenguas”) that granted official status to the indigenous languages “in the zones where they predominate,” thus falling short of unconditional officialization.41 Further legislation came before the Congress in 2007, in the form of the draft “Law for the Preservation, Use and Diffusion of the Aboriginal Languages of Peru,” which seeks to expand the territorially circumscribed “official” status of the indigenous languages to Peruvian territory as a whole. However, certain members of the Congress, as further discussed below, stridently objected to this proposal.
The new Constitution of Ecuador approved in September 2008 recognizes cultural and linguistic rights but is similarly timid about “official” status for any language other than Spanish:

The State respects and promotes the development of all the languages of Ecuadoreans. Spanish is the official language. Quichua, Shuar and the other ancestral tongues are for official use by indigenous peoples under the terms of the law.42

Again, the principle of territorial circumscription is brought to bear on official status for indigenous languages. While a proposal for a law for the “applicability of ancestral languages” has been debated in the Congress,43 no such law has yet been passed in Ecuador.
The new Bolivian State Political Constitution approved by popular referendum in January 2009 under the government of Evo Morales strengthens the terms of Supreme Decree 25894. The 2009 Constitution declares all 36 of the currently identified originary languages to be official in addition to Spanish and makes it a requirement for all state functionaries to speak the indigenous language of the regions to which they are posted, as well as Spanish.44 However, the Language Law needed for implementation of these constitutional tenets still awaits ratification.

Education Policy
A key area in which governments are seeking to implement some of the precepts set out in their state constitutions is that of education for children who are mother-tongue speakers of indigenous languages. Prior to the 1990s, indigenous language education had been confined to pilot programs, often in the hands of missionary organizations, with transition to Spanish as a primary goal. A short-lived period of Peruvian state officialization of Quechua under the military government of Velasco Alvarado in 1975 (retracted under the 1979 Constitution)45 gave rise to the path-breaking Experimental Bilingual Education Project (P-EEB), but this was nonetheless confined to the department of Puno.46 A wholehearted vision of bilingual education for indigenous children, as enabling maintenance of the vernacular mother tongue as well as acquisition of Spanish as a second language, had yet to evolve.47
The 1990 “World Congress on Education For All,” held in Jomtien, Thailand, under UNESCO auspices, gave an important impetus to Andean state initiatives for linguistically and culturally appropriate education reforms. ILO Convention 169 further supported the new educational proposals worldwide. The combination of demands from the indigenous movements and increasing pressure of international development agencies and financial donors eventually led to the EIB model being adopted as national policy (in Ecuador in 1986; in Peru in 1991; in Bolivia in 1994). However, its implementation was more effective in those countries where there was more involvement of the indigenous organizations and less so where the initiative was top-down, driven by external financial incentives rather than political will from within. In this respect, some salient differences can be noted between the three countries.48
In the case of Ecuador, simultaneous recognition of the Confederation of the Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE) and the launch

of the Bilingual Intercultural Education Programme in 1986 were interrelated aspects of the state response to the demands of its indigenous movement. This was followed in 1989 by Ecuador setting up the National Directorate for Bilingual Intercultural Education (DINEIB), with autonomous ministerial status. This institutional mechanism gave Ecuador’s indigenous people, with support until 2000 of the German Technical Development Agency (GTZ), a controlling hand in the administration of the designated EIB schools, teacher training through specially created EIB “Pedagogical Institutes,” and a hand in recruitment.
However, the Ecuadorian model has not been without its problems. For example, the autonomy of the indigenous sector in education administration also led to sectarianism between the bilingual indigenous teachers and their Spanish monolingual colleagues.49 The perception of the latter was that the criterion of bilingual competence (which, in the case of Ecuador, goes along with indigenous ethnicity) was taking priority over other credentials in the allocation of teachers to posts. Nonetheless, looked at from the point of view of improvements in social inclusion, Ecuador in the early 1990s was in the vanguard of indigenous professionalization, with indigenous men and women gaining university degrees and working as teacher trainers throughout the sector.50
In the case of Peru, the internal war that paralyzed the country from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s had much to do with why the momentum from the P-EEB in Puno was lost. Despite this, Constitutional Reform in 1993, a national census in the same year that updated official statistics on numbers of speakers, and the country’s ratification of ILO Convention 169 in 1994, all paved the way for Peru eventually to act on its 1991 national policy. This it did in 1996, with the setting up of a National Unit for Intercultural Bilingual Education (UNEBI), upgraded to National Directorate (DINEBI) in 2000.51 Under Alberto Fujimori’s second term, which also witnessed the arrest and detainment of Sendero Luminoso leader Abimael Guzmán, the World Bank injected funds into Peru’s education system, specifically for development of indigenous children’s schooling. By comparison with Ecuador, however, due to the lack of indigenous political organization in the Peruvian highlands, these initiatives were taken by ministry employees in consultation with rural development NGOs in the departments, without the participation of indigenous organizations as such. Under Alan García’s presidency since 2006, the momentum has again been lost. EIB has been subsumed within the National Directorate for Rural, Bilingual and Intercultural Education, its concerns subordinated to the wider educational needs of the rural population.
While Peru came to the fore in state-sponsored indigenous educational development in the 1970s, followed by Ecuador in the 1980s, at

the start of the 1990s it was Bolivia that led the field. Here, EIB was rolled out under the 1994 Education Reform Act (Law 1565) across Aymara, Quechua, and Guaraní-speaking areas of the country, extending into Amazonia from 2000.52 The Reform encountered strong political and attitudinal opposition from the left-wing teachers’ unions and parents respectively. However, as the years went on, the pedagogical advantages of the EIB model seemed indisputable and the indigenous organizations became empowered by the system.
It was therefore ironic, and perhaps no accident, that the early years of the new millennium saw an ideological turnaround by the government. Under increasing pressure from the public to relax the thrust of the neoliberal reforms of the 1990s, government also began to rethink the terms of the 1994 Education Reform. With the election of Evo Morales in 2005, a new education team led by Aymara sociologist Félix Patzi drafted a new Education Reform bill that proposes radical curricular reform in favor of the indigenous population, and that intercultural and bilingual education be spread to all levels and contexts, urban and rural alike. However, the new Bill is unlikely to see passage through Parliament until after the December 2009 presidential elections. Meanwhile, many teachers, who had never been very convinced of its premises in the first place, no longer adhere to the 1994 Reform. Education for the indigenous majority finds itself in a legislative hiatus with pedagogical consequences as a result.53

Language Use and Language Ideologies: Between the State and Daily Life
In this section I shall illustrate how the Quechua language is lived in practice, by drawing on some of the interview data previously published in Howard.54 Language is seen both as a vehicle for and an index of the way speakers socially position themselves and constitute their sense of cultural identity. This qualitative material lends substance to a sociolinguistic reality only glimpsed in skeletal form through the statistics presented in Current Statistics, in response to which latter the language planning initiatives discussed in The Role of the State were advanced.
The experience of Quechua monolingualism of the individuals whose lives go to make up the “93.22 percent” statistic provided for the district of Llusco (Chumbivilcas, Peru; Table 8.3) is here described by a man from that community, aged about 52 years (translated from Quechua):
ARC Since the times of our ancestors we always learn Quechua, for in our village that is our language, that is how we must speak.
RHA nd do you (singular) also know Spanish?

ARC We know (exclusive plural) Spanish because they teach it to us in school, and we go to the cities, and we learn it there, well a little. Not always very well.55

Each time this speaker refers to the learning or knowing of a language he uses the verb yachay (“to know”): Quechua is learned as part of the everyday language acquisition process (yachakuyku “we learn”); Spanish is taught in school (yachachiwanku “they teach us”); or it is learned by going away to the cities (yachamuyku “we go away to learn”). The latter phrase came up regularly in interviews with the Chumbivilcanos; migration to Arequipa and Cuzco is frequent, and Spanish language acquisition is an inherent, if not always very adequately achieved, part of that experience.56
Julio Candia, dean of the University of Cañar (Ecuador), represents the other end of the spectrum. Like other residents of Cañar city he is Spanish monolingual, while living within a 15-minute walk of the surrounding indigenous communities, where Quichua-Spanish bilingualism became widespread by the end of the twentieth century. In sociolinguistic terms, the diglossia (distribution of languages in a multilingual society according to spatial and social criteria, and functions of use) illustrated by this geographical, social and linguistic dichotomy is of a particular type. To apply Fishman’s framework, in Cañar we have a case of “diglossia with bilingualism” from the rural Quichua-Spanish speakers’ perspective, alongside “diglossia without bilingualism” from the perspective of Spanish-speaking town residents like Julio.57 The pattern of language use combines with the criterion of ethnicity to feed into people’s sense of identity in significant ways, while also mapping relations of power.
According to Don Julio’s explanation, the dichotomy was not always so stark.58 Labor relations between the landed classes and the indigenous communities in the days of the hacienda had necessitated regular communication across the social divide, and led both to indigenous people acquiring Spanish, and white landowners learning Quichua.59 But the communicative need ebbed away, Don Julio says, after the Agrarian Reform in the mid-1960s. Today, lack of social contact with the indigenous communities, combined with the fact of the latter’s bilingualism, has made it “unnecessary” for the Spanish speakers in town to learn Quichua, to quote: “For us it is essential to learn Spanish, but learning Quichua is not necessary, because we don’t have the regular contact that we should have to have,” and he refers to indigenous people’s bilingualism as a point in their favor: “They have all the merit for knowing two languages.”60 In the course of this interview, the stark dichotomy between Spanish monolinguals in town and indigenous bilinguals in the countryside is expressed in the speaker’s recurrent distancing use of the pronoun “ellos” (“they”) in referring to the other group.

By contrast with Ecuador, in Peru and Bolivia Quechua-Spanish bilingualism among the urban middle classes is more likely to have survived the effects of Agrarian Reform. Nevertheless such bilingualism was acquired in a context of ingrained racial prejudice, of which linguistic discrimination was an expression. People such as Julián Prado of Cuzco, a Quechua-Spanish bilingual member of the urban middle class, recalls learning Quechua while playing with the campesino children on trips with his parents to the countryside to see to the family cattle, in a decade we can calculate to have been around the 1940s, and in spite of his grandfather’s attitude: “My grandfather used to punish me severely if he heard me speaking Quechua, ‘that one’s an Indian, only the Indians speak Quechua’ [he would say].”
William Vega, also from Cuzco, of similar social background to Julián Prado but a generation younger, described how he learned Quechua as a second language in his teens due to spending long periods of time living in the countryside, his parents being schoolteachers assigned to the rural schools: “[My parents] were often in the countryside and because I wanted to communicate with the campesino children, and play with them, I began to learn Quechua, in the countryside.”61
This scenario is one that commonly explains how people of mestizo origin in the Andes learnt, or reactivated use of, the indigenous tongue in the latter part of the twentieth century. Agrarian reform had removed the middle classes from the land, where, as previously mentioned, the opportunity for Quechua second language acquisition had naturally arisen. However, as rural schooling became generalized, descendents of the earlier displaced landowners were located to Quechua-speaking regions to take up posts as teachers, often taking their children with them.
As a Spanish mother-tongue speaker, William Vega represents his experience of acquiring Quechua through naturally occurring social contact as a positive one. From the other side of the fence, for the Quechua speaker having to acquire Spanish by socially situated means, without there being any formal pedagogical provision for the purpose, the experience is often portrayed as traumatic. Nicolás’s account is typical of people of his generation (age 30 to 40 years), of rural origin (Chumbivilcas, Cuzco) and a Quechua monolingual until he reached his early teens:

As I can only speak “mote,” I feel alone, sad, because I don’t know how to speak Spanish. And other people move away from me. Once they know how to speak, they move away, and I am alone. And that’s how it must be in the University, in Cuzco [ . . . ]. When we people from the countryside enter the University they don’t talk to you, do they? 62

The word “mote” is a popular term for the Spanish spoken by the mother-tongue Quechua speaker who has not fully approximated to Spanish

Ch08.indd 203

204

ROSALEEN HOWARD

pronunciation, vocabulary, and syntax. Quechua influence particularly affects the Spanish vowel sounds, producing a stigmatized way of speaking.63
A Quechua-Spanish urban bilingual teacher from Charcas province, Bolivia, describes the “mote” phenomenon; the following is an extract from a longer interview:

They confuse the i with the e, and the o with u, right? Instead of saying “vida” they say “veda.” Instead of saying “burro” they say “borro,” right? And instead of saying “vista” they say “vesta.” That’s the problem with the vowel sounds. [ . . . ] But when they get here [to town], as there is television, video, and the teachers with them in the classroom, they start to correct themselves and they practically get rid of the blemish.64

The speaker’s use of the word “blemish” (Spanish “tara”) gives a hint of his ideological stance. In the full transcript notions of linguistic “correctness,” phenotypical “whitening,” and bodily “cleanliness” are seen to be associated with each other in the speaker’s mind.65
The examples discussed so far exemplify some subjective experiences of speakers in the Quechua-Spanish bilingual field, drawn from what we might call the private sphere of daily social interaction. They also give insight into the ways that perceptions of linguistic difference may inform discriminatory discourses and practices, bound up with social fears, concerns, and prejudices.66 By contrast, I shall now turn to examples of interactions drawn from the public sphere, that reveal some of the tensions around language policy and language use in formal settings.
Debates about language policy in the public sphere have weighty consequences when aired through the press and mass media. I shall present two recent and notorious cases, one from Bolivia and one from Peru, in which the prejudices that sometimes operate at the highest institutional level were exposed to public view. These emblematic episodes suggest that there is some way to go in order for language rights to be translated from the letter of the law into greater social equality in practice.
The first of these incidents occurred in the early days of the Bolivian Constitutional Assembly session in Sucre, in August 2006. One of the delegates of the MAS (government) benches, an indigenous leader named Isabel Domínguez, raised an objection against the declaration of an adjournment during a difficult moment in the debate. Her intervention was unusual, for she spoke out in her native language, Quechua. It was her use of this language that raised the hackles of a delegate on the opposition (PODEMOS) bench, Beatriz Capobianco, who called out furiously that “she should speak when she learns to speak Spanish.”

Domínguez did not take lightly to this reaction, and the two had to be restrained from coming to blows.
The episode caused controversy in the press; sparked bloggers’ debates on the Internet; and a spokesperson on behalf of the Assembly publicly condemned the discriminatory language. However, the issue of whether or not the indigenous languages were to be co-official with Spanish as languages of the Assembly was never really resolved. The irony of the situation was that the officialization of Bolivia’s 36 indigenous languages was part of the very business of the Assembly, eventually to be written into the new Constitution.
In September 2007, the debate over the draft “Law for the Preservation, Use and Diffusion of the Aboriginal Languages of Peru” (mentioned above), which includes a proposal for the unconditional officialization of all Peruvian indigenous languages, caused a furore in the Peruvian Congress. Congresswoman Martha Hildebrandt, a linguist by training, took issue with it in scathing terms. In full view of journalists with digital video cameras, she made a personalized attack on the two indigenous Congresswomen (María Sumire and Hilaria Supe) who were proposing it, on grounds that they lacked appropriate professional credentials to debate matters linguistic at such a level. The incident created an outcry in the press; a video bearing witness to the belittling tones of Hildebrandt toward her indigenous colleagues went out on the video Internet site YouTube, giving rise to polemical discussion on blogs and TV programs for months following the incident.67

Concluding Remarks: Survival or Demise?
In this chapter I have adopted a hybrid methodology as a means to evaluate the current vitality and status of the Quechua language. Despite the well-known shortcomings of statistical data, the usefulness of a well-designed census such as Bolivia’s of 2001 has been demonstrated. I have also attempted to put flesh on the bare bones of the statistics through verbal testimonies that reveal the lives behind the numerical tables. The language planning actions of the state, educational initiatives in particular, sit between the level of figures and the level of language use. At all these levels, ideologies are in play. Behind the drafting of any law on linguistic rights lies polemical debate in which indigenous leaders may struggle to make their voices heard in the face of Hispanocentrism and conservatism among their peers in government.
Social change in the Andes is now advancing so rapidly that indigenous language speakers get inexorably caught up in the desire to shift to Spanish, especially as the result of urban migration. As Xavier Albó observes, speaking of Bolivia, this happens even where the ideals of the

Ch08.indd 205

8/23/2011 10:21:28 PM

206

ROSALEEN HOWARD

speakers involved may lie elsewhere. Indigenous language maintenance is simply impractical within existing structures:

I have seen many cases of indigenous leaders and even prominent linguists and presenters on Quechua and Aymara radio stations who, for reasons which are more practical than ideological, hardly use the originary language with their younger children who were born in the city or arrived there at a young age, although they still use it with their older children.68

When language planning efforts go against the tide of societal language habits, attitudes and prejudices, as Marleen Haboud also argues: “The symbolic values of a language or even the strong emotional connection of speakers to it, cannot guarantee language maintenance.”69
By the beginning of the new millennium, despite statistical evidence of a decline in numbers of speakers, social and educational conditions were evolving in some parts of the Andes that appeared to provide for language revitalization, not just as part of governmental education policy, but as a social dynamic from the ground up. Evo Morales’s landslide victory in Bolivia in 2005 raised expectations regarding the future of the indigenous languages; there was a surge of interest and Quechua appeared more widely than before in secondary school and university curricula;70 and the new Language Law was drafted. But a political deadlock has divided the country along geographical and racial lines and sparked violent confrontations; there are now signs of disillusionment in the indigenous agenda that in turn threatens to compromise the teaching and learning of the language in institutional settings. The situation is evolving and merits the continued attention of researchers.71
In considering what the prospects are for the survival of Quechua and other indigenous languages in the future, I believe the relationship between language and identity is a crucial indicator. That a large majority of the people in Bolivia who self-ascribe as being of indigenous ethnicity now live in urban areas, yet do not necessarily speak the indigenous languages, as revealed in the 2001 Bolivian census, is in my view a significant trend. My hypothesis here would be that the strength of indigenous identity, even where the vernacular language has fallen into disuse, may constitute the necessary condition for eventual language revitalization in subsequent generations. Recent Quechua revitalization among some sectors in the city of Cochabamba is evidence that this can potentially occur. Second generation migrants who reside in this city, descendants of provincial landowning families where bilingualism was prevalent among their parents’ generation, having had their use of Quechua suppressed in childhood due to social prejudices of the day, allow it to flourish anew in adulthood as they carve out careers in

207

language planning and education for which Quechua language skills are now requisite.72
Linguistic features of contact between Quechua and Spanish may be indicators of another sort as to the chances for survival of the Amerindian language. Kathryn Woolard argues convincingly that a flexible rather than a puristic attitude to language mixture on the part of speakers and language planners may increase the chances of language maintenance as opposed to language death.73 While the phenomenon of QuechuaSpanish contact in the Andes has been well researched for Ecuador74 and Peru,75 and Sichra provides insights into the Cochabamba case,76 Quechua-Spanish contact in Bolivia remains a relatively understudied topic. Further research would be needed to test the following hypotheses, which I derive from firsthand experience of the city over many years: Cochabamba Quechua is flexible in allowing Spanish lexical and syntactic influence without its integrity seemingly being threatened; Cochabamba popular Spanish is known and even valued for its Quechua inflections; the dogma of linguistic purism so prevalent in certain cuzqueño circles is not common here; the hybrid “quechuañol” way of speaking is intrinsic to the distinctive “cochala” identity, and the stigma of “mote” is to some extent allayed.
To go by cases of other languages around the world that have successfully gone through processes of revitalization, such as that of Welsh, an expansion of the functions of Quechua to spheres of activity associated with the modern and globalizing world would also seem highly desirable. The much-publicized launch of GoogleTM in Quechua (http:// www.economist.com; August 17, 2006), Microsoft’s development of a Quechua version of Word (http://www.newsvote.bbc.co.uk; August 25, 2006), and the introduction by the Peruvian mobile phone company Movistar of phone operators who offer their services in Quechua and Aymara (http://www.celularis.com; accessed November 8, 2009), are gestures in this direction. While they may be purely symbolic to start with, such gestures are vital in order to make a point, shift attitudes, and potentially to trigger changes in language practices.
As long as discriminatory social systems persist, along with the association between the indigenous language, technological simplicity, and poverty, people will aspire to Spanish. Where education programs can be put in place that effectively use both languages for the purpose of education, embed the teaching of Quechua in a culturally appropriate curriculum, are seen to assure the effective teaching of Spanish as a second language, are driven by the people themselves through their organizations, and involve society at large in the intercultural agenda, then there is a realistic chance that the indigenous language will grow in status and public attitudes may alter. Another important factor, which there is not the space to develop in the present study, will be the further development

ROSALEEN HOWARD

of Quechua as a written language, for spheres not limited to that of education.77 If these conditions are not met then the evidence is that education can have the very opposite effect—parents react negatively for social reasons, and when the ideological climate changes, this can undermine an indigenous language’s fortunes; education can be seen not necessarily to assure the survival of the indigenous language.

Notes
1. The Quechua language is better described as a “language family” due to the vast range of its variant forms, and the question of whether we should rather speak of the Quechua “languages” in this connection is a subject of debate among linguists. The variant forms of Quechua can also be referred to as “dialects,” but I avoid the term here as it has acquired a pejorative connotation in the Andean countries, as a means to downgrade Quechua in relation to Spanish.

expresses cultural, social and political rivalries between the Cuzco regionalists and the wider Peruvian State which go back at least to the period of the Tupac Amaru II uprising of the late eighteenth century (Mannheim, The Language of the Inka). The puristic Quechua promulgated by the Academy is a means for this group to distinguish itself from the rural Quechua speakers (“runa” or “Indians”), in terms of an elitist sense of their own historical identity; theirs is an exclusionary discourse in this respect.

In Huánuco department, where I conducted fieldwork just before and just after the war, people made a clear association between the shift to Spanish and the experience of the “Sendero” years; this shift had been facilitated by migration to the cities away from the emergency zones; those who returned to the sierra after the danger had passed did not return to using Quechua on such a regular basis (Howard, Por los linderos de la lengua, p. 33). 36.
