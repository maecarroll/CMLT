1.3 The Sabanê People
The Sabanê people inhabit two discontinuous areas in the state of Rondônia, southern Amazon. In Posto Pyrineus de Souza, locally known as Aroeira, there are about 300 people, one hundred of whom are identified as being Sabanê. Several ethnic groups (Manduca, Tawaindê, Mamaindê, and Sabanê) share Aroeira. In the Sowaintê village, officially known as Área Indígena Roosevelt, there are approximately forty Sabanê and three Tawaindê.
From one hundred and forty Sabanê individuals, only three are native speakers, while two learnt the language (as a second language) when children. Fewer than ten are able to communicate in Sabanê, having learnt isolated words and sentences. This group of ten people is formed by the first generation born in the Aroeira village (people who were born after 1960). Even so, they cannot be considered and they do not consider themselves as speakers2. The majority of Sabanês are monolingual in the local variety of Brazilian Portuguese.
2 Linguists do not agree on an appropriate way of defining the proficiency of a speaker. In general, each case must be individually analyzed. In a broader sense, the term Sabanê native speaker will be applied to those who learnt Sabanê as their first language and are able to use it in a variety of contexts. Consider the situation of Jose Benedito Nambikwara (1912 - ). He was born and raised in a Sabanê village, and spoke only Sabanê until 1935. In that year, he was contacted by Brazilian pioneers and decided to move out of his village. After that, he managed to get a job at SPI, and afterwards in FUNAI. His long personal history of contact (he

1.1 Introduction
The Nambikwara linguistic family includes more than fifteen languages and dialects, divided into three main branches (Southern Nambikwara, Northern Nambikwara, and Sabanê). The aim of this dissertation is to provide a linguistic description of Sabanê, an endangered language, based on original fieldwork. The Sabanê group inhabits two discontinuous villages near the town of Vilhena, in Rondônia State, Southern Amazon. Although the Sabanê Community has about one hundred and forty speakers, only three are native speakers and less than ten people (including Indians of other ethnic groups) master the language (in various degrees of proficiency).
The objective of this study is to offer a general description of the Sabanê language, based on word lists, paradigms, and sentences obtained through direct interaction with our informants. We were also able to collect a limited number of texts and furthermore used the usual elicitation procedures as described in studies such as Rowe-Swadesh, Typological Forms of the National Museum UFRJ, Comrie & Smith 1977, among others. We have also profited from the study of Payne (1997). The situation of obsolescence and the fact that this language is not effectively used anymore by the native speakers limited the possibility to collect texts and engage in real situations of language use.
The results of this research are supposed to meet a number of purposes. First, a grammar is offered of an undocumented language of an isolated family, as a contribution to our knowledge of the linguistic typology of the indigenous languages of Brazil. This Grammar intends to contribute to the understanding of South American linguistic history as well. The history of the peoples of South American, in general, and of its languages, in particular, is not well known. Thus, a broader understanding of South American (linguistic) history depends on the availability of descriptions of these languages. Finally, this research aims to help the maintenance/revitalization of the Sabanê language.
The thesis is organized in the following way: in Chapter 1, the Sabanê People and their ethno-history are introduced and previous work on the language is discussed. Chapter 2 presents the Phonology (vowels, consonants, syllabic structure, accent and morphophonological processes). Chapter 3 covers the Nominal and Verbal Morphology. The Syntax is presented in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 deals with Adverbs, while Chapter 6 describes Interrogative Words. Chapter 7 contains a conclusion of the foregoing chapters.

1.2 Notation

In this work, four different notations are used: orthographic, phonological, phonetic, and morphemic.
All data in orthographic notation is transcribed in boldface (Times New Roman). The orthographic notation is almost identical with the phonological notation. The correspondence between the symbols used in the phonology and the orthography is as follows / / p; /¡ / b; /¢ / t; /£ / d; /¤ / k; /¥ / m; /¦ / n; /§ / s; /¨ / h; /© / l; / /  ; / / a; / / i; / / u; / / e; / / o; and the glides / / w; / / y. The orthographic notation employs the following symbols:

nshl w y1

Consonants Glides

i u e o a Vowels

–

Morpheme or affix boundary

Compound boundary

The explanatory notation for morphemes and free translations are provided in English. Hence, the sentences in (01) and (02) have four morphemes each.

The symbol . indicates that a word is a compound:

1 In the orthographic notation, the glide [$ ] is kept as w. The coronal glide [% ] is replaced by y. This substitution is due to the fact that Portuguese orthography uses j to refer to a voiced coronal fricative /& /. Since the Sabanê orthographic notation is intended to be adopted as the official orthography and because Portuguese is the first language of literacy in the Sabanean Community, I have opted to avoid a possible conflict. Moreover, in order to simplify the orthographic notation the implosive consonants /' / and /( / are represented as d and b, respectively.

Preliminaries

Crystal (2000: 20) classifies the degree of endangerment of a language through the interaction of a number of factors, among which are the size of the population and the community of speakers, the community’s internal organization, and the way it perceives its own language, the position of the language as an identity marker and the number of children who learn it as their first language.
Wurm (1998: 192) proposes a typology of threat which includes five levels: 1. potentially endangered languages are socially and economically disadvantaged, under heavy pressure from a larger language, and beginning to lose child speakers; 2. endangered languages have few or no children learning the language, and the youngest good speakers are young adults; 3. seriously endangered languages have youngest good speakers of age 50 or older; 4. moribund languages have only a handful of good speakers left, most of whom are very old; 5. extinct languages have no speakers left. Accordingly, endangered languages tend to be used by their communities only rarely, being substituted by the dominant external language in the majority of its social functions.
Based on these criteria, one can affirm that the Sabanê language is seriously threatened or moribund, because there are only three native speakers (all of whom older than fifty) who still command all the aspects of the language. Children do not have any contact with the language anymore and Brazilian Portuguese has become the prestige language inside the community. Actually, Sabanê and other indigenous languages in the region, particularly those of nearby towns, have became widely disfavoured and socially rejected.
In the Aroeira village, the Tawaindê group represents the majority in terms of population and native speakers, whereas, at least linguistically, the Sabanê represent a minority; the Manduca group, despite having the smallest population, controls the political arena, since their elders have great prestige in communal decisions. Compared to the others, the Sabanê group counts very few native speakers, which also contributes to their lack of prestige within the community. Additionally, Manduca and Tawaindê are intelligible among each

stopped speaking Sabanê since he left his village) and health concerns (he had a stroke in the 1980’s) led him to abandon his first language completely. Currently, J. B. N. speaks only Portuguese and does not seem able to speak Sabanê anymore. Apart from him, in 2004, there were three native speakers: Manoel Sabanê (1942- ), Filipe Sabanê (1940- ), and Avelina Sabanê (1938- ).
The Nambikwara area is well known for its multilingualism. In addition, some Nambikwaran people learnt Sabanê as a second language. Amongst them, one must mention Manoel Sabanê’s wife, Ivone Sowaintê, and Jose Benedito’s wife, Teresa Lakondê. Even though Ivone and Teresa are not native speakers, they form, aside from Manoel, the only group who speak Sabanê in a frequent way. Therefore, they are the last source for the Sabanê language.

other, while Mamaindê is the major second language. Sabanê is spoken only by Sabanê natives or by those who have learnt it as a second language. External factors, however, place all languages of Aroeira village at a disadvantage. The prestige of Brazilian Portuguese is increasing, which tends to suppress all the minority languages in the region.

Preliminaries

The creation of the Sowaintê village in 2002 provided a new stimulus for the Sabanê language. In this new village, the population is mainly Sabanê and and its inhabitants are willing to revive their language. The community of the Sowaintê village has welcomed the project Grammar of Sabanê; it also has stimulated the beginning of an educational program in the area.

1.3.1 Ethno-history3
It was only at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century that Brazilian pioneers effectively explored the region that encloses the current southern parts of Rondônia State and centre-north of Mato Grosso State. After the Promulgation of the Republic (1889), the Military Government intended to ‘integrate’ the domestic territory, and started building a Telegraphic Line, connecting the towns of Mato Grosso Province to the town of Porto Velho (which is presently the capital of Rondônia State). Eventually, during the construction, the workers and the military personnel responsible for the work on the Line made contact with a large number of indigenous groups in the region. During the construction works, some of these groups kept a rudimentary contact with the Brazilians. With the advance of the construction, this contact became ampler and provoked deep changes in these societies.
The command of the works of the Telegraphic Line was in the hands of Colonel Cândido Mariano da Silva Rondon. In the first years of the 20th century, the works on the Line, already with some outposts installed in the heart of the Nambikwara territory, started to attract the aboriginal groups currently known as Northern Nambikwara. In addition, the first reports appeared where the Sabanê people are mentioned as a particular cluster. The term ‘Sabanê’ appears for the first time in the literature in 1914, in a report of Rondon’s visit to the area known as Posto Três Buritis (see photo).
When Rondon visited the area of Três Buritis, tools and gifts were distributed to the Indians who approached the outpost. Rondon (1916: 149-150) reports:
From this date on, the visits of the Indians to our camps never ceased and there were occasions at which they arrived in groups of 200 or more individuals. The word about such an extraordinary success spread to the backcountry, and soon other tribes, sometimes situated to the North at a distance of over twenty leagues [140 kms], started to join in. In this way, we

met the Sabanês, the Iaiás, the Xaodês, and the Teiobês, who are the most beautiful men of the whole region.4

Posto Três Buritis, 1913. In Roosevelt 1914.
In the absence of any verifiable evidence, whether linguistic (word lists, etc.), archaeological (utensils, etc.), or derived from documents (photos, for example), it is not possible to establish beyond doubt if the band called Sabanê by Rondon is related to the current Sabanê group. Moreover, the proper names of these bands were confusing to the Brazilians themselves, especially in a time when Indians and white men did not understand each other and communication between them must have been rudimentary. In the published texts from Rondon (1916) or Roquette-Pinto (1919), there is also a great deal of uncertainty as far as the groups’ names are concerned. In the first place, Nambikwaran clusters did not possess a specific name. Some of the names that the white men thought to be self-designation were actually kinship names. It is easy to imagine a soldier asking an Indian for the name of the group to which s/he belongs, and the Indian, struggling to understand the newcomer, giving an answer to a question he had misunderstood.
4 The translation is from the Portuguese text, which is as follows: ‘Dessa data em diante, nunca mais cessaram as visitas dos índios aos nossos acampamentos, e houve occasiões em que elles chegavam aos grupos de 200 e mais indivíduos. A notícia de tão extraordinário successo, propagando-se rapidamente pelo sertão, deu lugar a que, ás primeiras tribus, se reunissem logo outras, situadas para o Norte, a mais de 20 léguas de distância. Assim, ficámos conhecendo os Sabanês, os Iaiás, os Xaodês e os Teoibês, que são os homens mais bonitos de toda esta região.’

The name Sabanê, for example, is the result of this kind of

misunderstanding. Although widely recognized and accepted for the current

Sabanê, the group’s name is by no means a self-designation; to name

themselves, the Sabanê use the term Kulimansi. According to the anthropologist

Edwin Reesink (forthcoming), Kulimansi is, in fact, the name of a main village

that, by extension, became the group’s name. On the other hand, the term

‘Sabanê’ can be linked to the Sabanean word sapane [§  @

meaning

‘youngest sister’. This suggests that the Portuguese word Sabanê is a

misunderstood loanword from the Sabanê language. The shift of the stress

position can be explained by analogy to the other names typically attributed to the Nambikwara bands, as for example, Latundê and Tawaindê. In a similar vein, the name of the group referred to by Rondon as ‘Iaiás’ (1916: 150, cited above) could be derived from the Sabanê word yaya [     ] ‘sister’. Therefore, it is very well possible that a group called ‘Iaiás’ never existed. On the other hand, if this group has ever existed, it is probably now extinct. In the 1930s, the French anthropologist Lévi-Strauss visited the Nambikwara region, following the former Telegraphic Line and reports (1961:350-1):
Je rencontrais là deux nouvelles bandes, dont l’une comprenait dix-huit personnes parlant un dialecte proche de ceux que je commençais à connaître, tandis que l’autre, forte de trente-quatre membres, faisait usage d’une langue inconnue; par la suite, il ne m’a pas été possible de l’identifier. Chacune était conduite par un chef, aux attributions purement profanes, semblait-il, dans le premier cas; mais le chef de la bande la plus importante allait bientôt se révéler comme une sorte de sorcier. Son groupe se désignait du nom de Sabané; les autres s’appelaient Tarundé.
A part la langue rien ne les distinguait: les indigènes avaient même apparence et même culture. C’était déjà le cas à Campos Novos; mais au lieu de se témoigner une hostilité réciproque les deux bandes de Vilhena vivaient en bonne intelligence.
Lévi-Strauss kept a prolonged contact with these groups and concluded that the language of the Sabanê people was unintelligible to the Northern Nambikwara clusters, although these Indians were supposed to be allies and lived close to each other. Inspired by this fact and based on his own comparative work, Lévi-Strauss (1948:10) prefers not to classify the Sabanê as a member of the Nambikwara family:
Par ses caractères sémantiques et morphologiques, le dialecte c [Sabanê, GAA] s’éloigne nettement dés précédents [Northern Nambikwara: Mamaindê, Tarundê, Halõtesu, etc. GAA]. Nous n’avons pas poussé suffisamment loin son étude linguistique pour décider s’il convient ou non de le rattacher à la familie Nambikwara.
Additionally, Lévi-Strauss (1948) published a Sabanê word list that allows us to confirm, with precision, that he was indeed dealing with the language known today as Sabanê (cf. section 1.4). Therefore, it is possible to presume that the current Sabanê descend from the group contacted by Lévi-Strauss. At the same time, Lévi-Strauss presented a clear-cut demographic picture of the Sabanê. There are no other trustworthy statistics to determine the size of the

10

Preliminaries

Sabanê population (or even the Nambikwara population) before or during the first years of contact. Rondon (quoted by Lévi-Strauss) estimated the Nambikwara population (including the Sabanê) at around twenty thousand people. Lévi-Strauss mentioned that, during his journeys along the former Telegraphic Line in the 1930s, the indigenous populations were facing high death rates, induced, generally, by illnesses. In his stay (around 1933) in the outpost of Vilhena, Lévi-Strauss (1961: 337) wrote:
Au moins indirectement, je souhaitais me rendre compte du chiffre approximatif de la population nambikwara. En 1915, Rondon l’avait estimé à vingt mille, ce qui était probablement exagéré; mais à cette époque, les bandes atteignaient plusieurs centaines de membres et toutes les indications recueillies sur la ligne suggéraient un déclin rapide: il y a trente ans, la fraction connue du groupe Sabané comprenait plus de mille individus; quand le groupe visita la station téléphonique de Campos Novos en 1928, on recensa cent vingt-sept hommes, plus les femmes et les enfants. En novembre 1929 cependant, une épidémie de grippe se déclara alors que le groupe campait au lieu-dit Espirro6. La maladie évolua vers une forme d’œdème pulmonaire, et trois cents indigènes moururent en quarante-huit heures. Tout le groupe se débanda, laissant en arrière les malades et les mourants. Des mille Sabané jadis connus, dix-neuf hommes subsistaient seuls en 1938 avec leurs femmes et leurs enfants. A l’épidémie, il faut peutêtre ajouter, pour expliquer ces chiffres, que les Sabané se mirent en guerre il y a quelques années contre certains voisins orientaux. Mais un large groupe installé non loin de Tres Buritis, fut liquidé par la grippe en 1927, sauf six ou sept personnes dont trois seulement étaient encore vivantes en 1938.
After the abandonment of the Telegraphic Line, the Federal Government promoted efforts to colonize the region again in the end of the 1950s. Meanwhile, the remaining Sabanê engaged in the exploration of poaia7 (Cephaelis ipecacuanha) and rubber, acting like rubber-tappers, many times reduced to being mere slaves owned by former employees of the Telegraphic Line. The proliferation of illnesses caused a drastic demographic reduction in all the indigenous populations of the current state of Rondônia. In this context, in the 1960s, in order to regroup the remaining Indians of nearly extinct or threatened groups, the SPI (Serviço de Proteção aos Índios, Brazilian Agency for

outpost. 7 Poaia is a herb used as a traditional medicine.

Protection of the Indigenous Populations, nowadays FUNAI) invited unsettled Indians to form a new village.
The Aroeira reserve was installed in the State of Mato Grosso, approximately twenty kilometres from the town of Vilhena, which belongs to the state of Rondônia. Although the village of Aroeira is geographically located in Mato Grosso State, its population develops many of its activities, as for example trading, in Vilhena. As was already observed above, in this village, Indians of different backgrounds were grouped together, such as the Sabanê, the Tawaindê, the Manduca, and the Mamaindê.
The fact that these ethnic groups were traditionally enemies, or at least nonallies, as far as the relationship between Sabanê-Manduca and TawandêManduca is concerned, was ignored by the SPI. Furthermore, most of the languages spoken in the village are not mutually intelligible, although Tawandê and Mamaindê are. These new conditions triggered deep modifications in the social structure of these bands. In the first place, many of their cultural traditions were abandoned. The lack of wedding partners (due to depopulation) forced inter-ethnic marriages. This promoted changes in their traditional rules of ethnic affiliation. Moreover, the concept of a homogeneous and definable ethnic group by kinship or through social rules was lost. It means that, due to a series of causes, the rules of ethnic nomination (for descent or adoption) are no longer used in the traditional sense between the Sabanê and among the members of other indigenous groups that share the Aroeira village. Additionally, the scarcity of arable lands, hunting, and fishing grounds resulted in total dependence from official agencies.
Finally, in the 1960s, Rondônia started to be in fact colonized by another wave of pioneers, and the towns grew. Later, the increasing prestige of Brazilian Portuguese and the linguistic barriers that existed between some groups in Aroeira stimulated the adoption of Portuguese as a lingua franca. This, in turn, promoted the abandonment of the native languages. In a dramatic way, as far as the Sabanê are concerned, the birth of the first generation in Aroeira village represents the abdication of the transmission of the Sabanê language to newborns, even though (very) few of them still possess some passive knowledge. Therefore, every Sabanê that was born in Aroeira is a monolingual speaker of Portuguese.
Aroeira is characterized by a transition between savannah and tropical forest, sandwiched between the Chapada dos Parecis area and the beginning of the Amazonian Forest. In this region, the vegetation varies between dense bushes in the valleys, and fields with shrubs and scarce vegetation. The Indigenous Reserve area has already suffered from human presence. The traditional agricultural technique consists of deforestation and posterior clearance of ground by fire. As an aside, the first descriptions of Northern

Nambikwara gardens at the beginning of contact reported extensive land use and a quite diverse number of cultivated crops. This situation is the opposite of today’s gardening policy. Nowadays, gardens mainly produce corn, manioc, sweet potato, and banana. After the harvest, the surplus of production is traded in Vilhena, in order to allow the Indians to get ‘new’ products, such as rice, salt, soybean oil, and meat (currently the area is poor in hunting).
The centre of the Aroeira village has an infrastructure that enables ranching, and cattle are gradually abated during the year in order to provide meat to the community. However, this supply is insufficient to regularly feed more than 300 people. Moreover, it seems that the cattle are never used for milking. Recently some apicultural activity was initiated, but this is incipient, and so far, very few people seem to have profited from honey.
As a rule, in Aroeira, each family explores economic activities individually and the results are used for their own benefit. In addition, at the moment, pensions are the major source of income, paid monthly by the Government to every Indian older than 65 years old. This income is a Brazilian minimum wage (around R$260,00, or US$80.00 per month). Almost every family in the Community has pensioners. In addition, a small number of Indians work for FUNAI as nurse assistants or teachers (wages around R$600,00, or US$185.00 per month), which gives them a middle-class standard of living.
In brief, the economic picture presents serious difficulties for the local production and necessitates an influx of goods. Likewise, the fact that four different groups must share a village adds tensions to daily life. In addition, there are few ways of subsistence and the production of goods cannot guarantee enough income to supply the village’s needs.
Due to the social tensions in Aroeira, a group of Sabanê Indians left the area and, in May 2002, established a new village. This village is called Sowaintê and it is located between the rivers Roosevelt and Tenente Marques (about seventy kilometres to the northeast of Vilhena). This village is supposedly located in the region inhabited by the Sabanê before contact with the white men was established. The population is expanding and already counts about forty Indians. This area is rich in hunting and fishing grounds, and has good land for farming. In this environment, the Sabanê people have hopes of rehabilitating their language. A school and an educational project in their own language have been set up and teachers are already being trained.

1.4 Genetic Affiliation and Previous Works
Traditionally, the Nambikwara family has been described either as isolated or as unaffiliated to any group or linguistic family. Many internal classifications have

Preliminaries

13

been proposed and extended to incorporate newly contacted groups during the 20th century (Roquette-Pinto 1919, Lévi-Strauss 1948, Rondon & Faria 1948, Loukotka 1968, Price 1978, and Rodrigues 1986). Within the Nambikwara family three groups of languages are widely recognized: Southern Nambikwara (including Sararé, Kithãulhu, among others); b) Northern Nambikwara (including Mamaindê, Negarotê, Tawandê, Latundê, Lakondê, Sowaintê); and c) Sabanê.

1.4.1 Lévi-Strauss 1948
Roquette-Pinto (1919), Rondon & Faria (1948), and Loukotka’s (1968) classifications (the last one of which is based on the former ones) do not present any linguistic details, or discuss the bands’ names of the groups involved. LéviStrauss’ classification (1948) is the first to employ explicit rules. In doing so, Lévi-Strauss (1948:10) recognizes three dialectal groups (Sabanê, Northern, and Southern Nambikwara). However, he observes that:
Par ses caractères sémantiques et morphologiques, le dialecte Sabanê s’éloigne nettement dés précédents [Mamaindê, Tarundê, Halõtesu, etc. GAA]. Nous n’avons pas poussé suffisamment loin son étude linguistique pour décider s’il convient ou non de le rattacher à la familie Nambikwara.
I tried to collect every Sabanê word published in Lévi-Strauss’ work and compared them with my actual data. The Sabanê linguistics data is dispersed throughout Lévi-Strauss’ text. Lévi-Strauss’ Sabanean word list contains fiftysix words, mainly kinship terms, and names for colours, numerals, fruits, trees, and stars. Occasionally, it was not possible to recover the term originally transcribed by Lévi-Strauss, due to my lack of ability to collect anthropological oriented kinship or colours terms. In the following list, these missing words are followed by ‘?’. I present Lévi-Strauss’ transcriptions (kept as in the original) with an extra column where I give my transcriptions.

1.4.2 Price 1978
Price 1978, based on the comparative method and phonological correspondences, offers a comparison of three languages: Kithãulhu (Southern Nambikwara), Mamaindê (Northern Nambikwara), and Sabanê, each representing a major Nambikwara group. Price proposes a Proto-Nambikwara Phonology, based on a list of about one hundred and eighty words. In order to do so, Price based himself on his own knowledge of the Kithãulhu language as well as on data collected by Kingston (on the Mamaindê language) during the 1970s. As far as Sabanê is concerned, Price (1978: 16) collected a RoweSwadesh-like list:
(…) from Iracema, a woman married into the village of Camararé, on February 23 and 24, 1974. The transcription was double-checked, but no formal phonological analysis has been done.
Price (1978: 18) employs a phonemic notation based on an orthography developed by Kindell et al. (1975) for the Nambikwara Educational Program.
10 Cf. nutupi ‘urucu’ (Bixa orellana). 11 Cf. nutupi-selainte ‘green urucu’.

The Sabanê data, as transcribed by Price, are presented in italics in the tables below. Elements that are not regular (named by Price as ‘Irregular reflexes’) in the three languages (Sabanê, Mamaindê, and Kithãulhu), are in parentheses. [u ] represents a glottal stop12; superscript numbers such as 3 indicates low tone and 4 stands for high tone. The first column follows Price’s original numbering, although in the original, glosses are bilingual Portuguese/English (I discarded the Portuguese translation). Beside Price’s list, I present my own phonological transcriptions13. The symbol ‘?’ stands for a term that was not found with the same meaning as that listed by Price. The symbol ‘?’, followed by a substantially different transcription, indicates that the cognate term was not found by myself.

Price was familiar with the Kithãulhu language (Southern Nambikwara), because of a fourteen months’ stay in the Camararé village (Price 1972: 48-49). The influence of his Kithãulhu knowledge of Kithãulhu and his familiarity with the writing system proposed by the missionaries in the Nambikwara Area are reflected in his transcriptions and in the way he transcribes Sabanê as well. As far Mamaindê data is concerned, Price was based on Kingston (1970, 1972).
Southern and Northern Nambikwara languages have, for example, a strong tendency to shorten diphthongs (cf. Kroeker 2001: 2, Telles 2002: 100), although this tendency does not apply to Sabanê. Therefore, the shift of [ó ô ] to [Ù ] in data 19 /Ù Å Ä Å /, and from [ï ó ] to [Ù ] in 69 /Ä ï Ù Ø Ã /, transcribed by Price as /Í Ò ì Á Â Ó / À È Ô Ï and /é Ü Á Î /, respectively, reflects the Kithãulhu influence on the Sabanê notation. Kithãulhu has countless monosyllabic roots, while Sabanê has hardly any, as shown in Price’s transcriptions (01). Based on this fact, one can assume that Price segmented Sabanê morphemes bearing in mind the hypothesis that many words would be monosyllabic, as shown in (01).

In addition, the lack of a broader morphological analysis is evident in

example 112 Í Æ Ï À È Á Æ ‘to bite’. In this case, Price integrates the morpheme m–

‘2OBJ’ into the word. Therefore, Price writes Í Æ ö Ï À È Á Æ Ã Å õ supposes this form

means ‘to bite’, while it actually means ‘s/he bites me’. Examples 102 Â Ç Í Ü Ï ÷ Á ø

were not subjected

to a

detailed analysis,

since the morpheme –ko ‘CLASS TERM’ is represented in both words, as in

naw–ko ‘mother’ and wajn–ko ‘father’.

Given that Price collected the data with a female informant, the presence of

an initial glottal fricative [ù ] in his transcriptions (cf. Price’s example 28.Ð À È Ô )

can be attributed to a female vs. male variation: in word-initial onsetless

syllables, exclusively in female speech, [ù ] is inserted as the default onset. (Cf.

page 55 below).

The variation shown in (02) is sociolinguistically motivated. For this reason,

in my list there are no glottal fricatives in the word-initial position in the

examples 5, 6, 17, 28, 29, 33, 38, 39, 43, 52, 61, 73, 76a, 80, 81, 83, 93, 100,

114, 115, 116, 117, 130, 149, 183, and 186. Probably Price did not notice this

sociolinguistic fact because he worked with one female speaker only.

There is an alternation between the phonemes /É / and [ó ] in the beginning

of Sabanê forms which occur in very few words, such as in [ó Ä þÃ ÿ î Ã úØ Ä ] ~

[É

Ä þÃ ÿ î Ã úØ Ä

¡

¡
Ä úÃ Ø Ã þä Ã ÿÚ

Ã ] ‘jatoba fruit’.

However, this alternation is common in some other Nambikwara languages (cf.

Borella 2002, Telles 2002).

The alternation /É / ~ [ó ] ~ /Ú / is less robust in Nambikwara languages,

although it also occurs. This may have been common to all Nambikwara

languages but is not regular in Sabanê anymore. Nevertheless, such variations

can be observed as in 187a Ò Ó Ç Ô Í Î Ï ‘you’, cf. ma–, and in 94

Ò ì Á Û Ç Á Ò ì Á Û Ç È Á Â ‘light’, cf. pasa–n.

Price reviews the literature on Nambikwara languages and concludes that all Nambikwara dialects (at least those for which word lists are available) can be connected to any of those three major groups. Price (1978: 28) finalizes his work presenting the following ratios between the cognate items in the three languages (K-Kithãulhu, M-Mamaindê, and S-Sabanê):
Table 2: Percentage of cognates K–M K–S M–S
Cognates: 116 95 81 Cases: 164 190 165 Percentage: 71% 50% 49%
These ratios indicate the relationship among the Northern and Southern Nambikwara languages (even though these languages are unintelligible to each other), and the Sabanê. It also supports the hypothesis that all these languages belong to the same family.
Being based mainly on Price (1978), the classification proposed by Rodrigues (1986: 74-76) suggests the same division into three groups.

1.5 Methodology
This study is based on first-hand data collected in various field trips between 2000 and 2004. When this work started, the total number of Sabanê speakers was estimated at about fifteen (Wetzels 1999); however, the Sabanê Census (Araujo 2000) showed that in the year 2000 only eight native speakers were still alive. During the course of this study, the number of native speakers decreased to three.
When this work was initiated, the Aroeira village community appointed Manoel Sabanê as my ‘teacher’, because of his knowledge of Sabanê, his availability and, above all, his willingness to work as an informant. Consequently, Manoel Sabanê was the main informant for this study. In addition, Filipe Sabanê also contributed substantially as an informant. Only one female native speaker, Avelina Sabanê, contributed initially to the project. However, she abandoned her task as an informant for finding the work too hard. As a result of the difficulties of the informant work, Avelina abandoned the sessions completely.
Two non-native speakers have also been crucial for this work: Ivone Sowaintê, Manoel Sabanê’s wife (the last remaining Sowaintê), learnt Sabanê when she was a child and does speak Sabanê regularly with her husband. Teresa Lakondê (the last Lakondê speaker), Manoel and Ivone’s sister-in-law, who also

24

Preliminaries

learnt Sabanê when she was young and frequently speaks Sabanê to Manoel and Ivone. Moreover, Teresa Lakondê’s availability and proficiency together with her unique metalinguistic knowledge played a fundamental role in my own learning process of the language, as well as in the collection and confirmation of the data. To conclude, the collection work was carried out with three native informants (Manoel, Filipe, and Avelina) and two non-natives (Teresa and Ivone).
The proficiency levels in Brazilian Portuguese vary considerably among my informants. In this respect, Teresa, Manoel, Ivone, Filipe, and Avelina are on a decreasing scale, with Teresa possessing native-like abilities in Portuguese. Due to local constraints, I could never work with all of them together. When I started this project, Manoel and Ivone were about to leave Aroeira. Once they had left, they never returned to the village. Avelina does not leave Aroeira anymore, because she is too old and ill. Filipe was in a fragile relationship with Manoel and refused to meet him outside Aroeira. Manoel and Ivone are nowadays settled in the Sowaintê village, which is a no-go area for Aroeirans. Teresa lives in the town of Vilhena. Teresa, Manoel, and Ivone often meet each other.
The Project The Grammar of Sabanê is part of the research program ‘The Nambikwara Indians: a Description of their Languages and their Cultural Identity’, co-ordinated by Professor Dr. W. Leo Wetzels of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The program involves the study of three languages, each representing one of the major Nambikwara groups. Besides this Grammar of Sabanê, the research project involves four other researchers. Telles (2002) presented her work in a monograph entitled Fonologia e Gramática Latundê/Lakondê (Northern Nambikwara); Cristina Borella prepares a grammar on the Sararé/Katithãulhu language (Southern Nambikwara); Januacele Costa and Leo Wetzels are preparing a reconstruction of Proto-Nambikwara (Costa & Wetzels, in preparation), and Edwin Reesink has just finished his anthropological study Nambikwara Ethno-histories (Reesink, forthcoming).
Reesink and I visited the Aroeira village in the year 2000, when we were received by the Community. Although we were received politely, the community had decided in a meeting that we should not develop our work in the village. In the same meeting, it was decided that Filipe and Avelina could not help us outside the village. Anthropologist Edwin Reesink believes that the elders’ council, controlled mainly by Manduca and Tawaindê, had felt threatened by the possibility of an increase of prestige of Sabanê, caused by the fact that the language was about to be documented and would, later, be part of a project of bilingual education.
The Sabanê language has no social usage in the Sabanê Community anymore. It is used in a spontaneous manner only in conversations between Manoel Sabanê and Ivone Sowaintê, and when Manoel and Ivone meet Teresa

Lakondê. As was observed before, for a number of political issues, Manoel, Ivone, and Teresa do not go to Aroeira village anymore and they are thus not able to meet other Sabanê speakers. In the face of the eminent extinction of the language, this Grammar of Sabanê had to be completed within the limits of the restricted availability of informants with native mastery of the language. Eventually, some real life material such as histories and myths were collected; however, it was not completely put to use.
The collected material was double-checked with at least two speakers, i.e., if collected with Filipe, it was checked with Manoel and Teresa; if collected with Manoel, it was checked with Teresa and Ivone, and so on. The non-native speakers did not work as primary sources for this study.
Since the year 2000, I have spent several seasons with the Sabanê; in total more than a year in the Sowaintê village or in the town of Vilhena. The recorded data was stored on mini-disc (MD) with a digital microphone.
The grammatical description that follows in the chapters below has benefited from many theoretical works, such as Clements & Keyser (1983), Hayes (1989), Goldsmith (1990), as well as Comrie (1976), Dixon (1979, 1994), Bybee (1985), Shopen (1985), Mithun (1991), Frawley (1992), Payne (1997), Aikhenvald (2001), Aikhenvald & Dixon (2003), etc.

2 Phonology

2.1 Introduction

This chapter is organised in the following way: first, I describe the vocalic and consonantal phoneme charts, discussing them in depth. Second, I address syllable structure and syllable related processes, among which the stress rule is, that is partially sensitive to syllable weight. Finally, I present a number of morphophonological processes.
There are five phonemic vowels in Sabanê: / ¡ ¢ £ ¤ /. Phonetically, there are also long and nasalized vowels, and glides. Vowels and glides may combine to form diphthongs. The consonantal phonemes are /¥ ¦ § ¨ ©       /, which are common to all Nambikwara languages, except for the implosives /¨ © /.
In the section on Syllable Structure, I present the co-occurrence restrictions on segments within the syllable, and the processes of syllabification in general. It will be shown that Sabanê prevents, through deletion or resyllabification, a specific set of underlying segments to appear in the coda of the syllable.
In the section on Stress, I defend the view that stress is predictable in Sabanê, both in the verbal and in the nominal domains. All heavy syllables bear stress, and if there is no heavy syllable in a word, the penultimate syllable will be stressed. In Sabanê, heavy syllables are those that have a coda. The coda position can only be filled by glides, a coronal nasal consonant, or a glottal stop. A syllable with main stress will be indicated by [] preceding the syllable, and rhythmic stress by [] preceding the syllable with secondary or iterative stress; unstressed syllables are unmarked.

2.2 Vowels

2.2.1 Introduction

In Sabanê there are five phonemic vowels / ¢ ¤ ¡ £ /, phonetically realized as

[ ¢¤ 



£ ] in stressed position, and as [

!"

# $ ] in non-stressed position,

respectively.

The underlying high oral vowels /¢ / and /¤ / are realized as [¢ % ¤ & in stressed

and

as

% '!

"

( $ ] in unstressed syllables, respectively. The mid vowels /e/ and /o/

are normally realized in stressed syllables as [ ( ¡ ] and [£ ], respectively, but

they become [# ] and [$ ] in unstressed syllables. However, the phoneme /e/ is

relatively rare. The low central vowel /a/ in stressed syllables is realized as [ ]

and in unstressed syllables as [ ] or [) ].

In words with three or more syllables, in which there is a gap between a stressed and any other syllable, the syllable that receives iterative secondary prominence will be stressed. The vowel in this position (marked by [0 ]) will have a longer duration than an unstressed vowel, although it will be shorter than a primary stressed vowel (usually realized as a long vowel). In secondary stress position, four vowels have been found: / ¢ ¤ £ /, realized as [) 1 $ $ ]. The vowels /¤ £ / are neutralized and have the same phonetic output [$ ]. The vowel /¡ / was not found in this position.
Minimal pairs opposing short and long vowels have not been found. Therefore, the opposition between short and long vowels is a phonetic one for which we assume a complementary relationship. Short variants occur in unstressed syllables while the long ones occur in primary or rhythmically stressed syllables. As stated by the rule (01), every vowel will be long when stressed:

A nasalization process is active in vowels (phonemically oral). Phonetic nasalization happens before a nasal consonant, when the vowel is in primary or secondary stress position. For this reason, it is a phonetic phenomenon: nasality spreads to preceding vowels from a following nasal consonant if the preceding syllable is stressed.

Both glides are nasalized in stressed syllables when followed by nasals.

Although, at the surface, only one tautosyllabic segment may follow the nucleus,

I will assume that sequences of glide-nasal (GNw and glide-nasal-syllable (GNb σ)

represent

the

underlying

source

for

2.2.4 Diphthongs

High vowels can be combined in diphthongs as offglides (VOWEL-GLIDE) or as onglides (GLIDE -VOWEL), as shown in Table 4. At the edge of a syllable, high vowels are realized as semivowels or glides. In both onset and coda positions they may combine with vowels to form rising (GLIDE -VOWEL) or falling (VOWEL-GLIDE) diphthongs, as shown in Table 4.

42

Phonology

The offglide diphthongs formed by tautosyllabic sequences of VOWEL+GLIDE are very common, mainly because, phonetically, glides are the only elements allowed in coda position, together with the glottal consonant [ ] and the coronal nasal [V ]. Since glides may occupy the onset and coda position at the same time tautosyllabic sequences of the type Glide-Vowel-Glide also occur.

2.3 Consonants

2.3.1 Introduction

The Sabanê consonant phonemes are the voiceless stops /  ~ } /, the nasals
/  /, the implosives /  /, the fricatives /  /, and the lateral / /. Each of these consonants has a number of different allophones1.

1 This consonant chart is similar to the one establish for the Northern Nambikwara languages, although Latundê lacks an implosive series (Telles 2002: 34). However, the Southern Nambikwara languages have different consonant phonemes. For Kithãulhu, Kroeker (2001: 79) reports glottalized and aspirated consonants as well as one implosive / / and one affricate
/  /.

There is no opposition between the allophones [¡ ] and [¡ Ô ], in Sabanê. Januacele Costa (personal communication) points out that vowel deletion and further labialization in sequences like [¡ ³ Ö × Ø Ù Ø Ú Û ] is widespread in the Nambikwara languages, synchronically and diachronically. However, this generalization does not apply to Sabanê. Therefore, the structure [Ü Ù ] is considered to derive from an underlying bi-segmental sequence /Ü Ý /.

These consonants occur mainly in initial position, even though they have also been found medially. Implosive consonants ‘are produced with a greater than average amount of lowering of the larynx during the time that the oral closure for the stop is maintained’ (Ladefoged & Maddieson 1996:82). Sabanê has an implosive series and lacks a corresponding voiced stop series, as does Kithãulhu (Kroeker 2001). Consequently voiced stop consonants are not phonemes in

48

Phonology

either of the two languages. In the absence of voiced stops, implosives are in opposition to voiceless stops. Implosives do not share allophones with voiceless stops either. Moreover, in medial position, implosives vary freely with normal voiced stops.
The voiced coronal implosive /í / occurs only in onset position (initial and medial). The sound occurs in very few morphemes, although the ones in which it is found are of very high frequency: the first person possessive pronoun, the evidential present tense and past tense suffixes.

Besides the glides and the velar stop, the coronal nasal consonant /T / can also occupy the coda position. When this consonant is in coda position, leftward nasality spreading is triggered obligatory. In the same process, /n/ itself is deleted. Since the absence of non-coronal nasal consonants in the coda is a structural fact about Sabanê syllable structure, the coronal point of articulation may be considered irrelevant to the spreading process. In Non-linear Phonology terms, the vowel nasalization described here may be seen as the effect of stability of the nasal feature under deletion of the consonant that bears this feature underlyingly. In (150), the symbol = marks the deletion of the coda nasal and the dotted association line indicates spreading of the nasal feature to the vowel.

The glottal stop / / is realized as [ ] and occurs as a phoneme only in coda position. It is also relatively rare2.

2 The fact that the glottal consonant / / occurs in coda position is unexpected because other consonants (all sonorants) which occur in the coda can also appear in onset position. Therefore, / / differs from the group formed by [  ]   / because it is [-sonorant] and does not occur as an onset.

Although the glottal stop has a limited distribution, evidence for its underlying existence comes from stress assignment in the final syllable and from its behaviour in compound words. Stress assignment is sensitive to syllabic weight. If a word has no heavy syllables, the penultimate syllable of a word receives primary stress. However, words like ninu ‘water’ have a final stressed syllable. There is no explanation for this fact unless we regard the last syllable as heavy. It must be closed by a consonant, in this case the glottal stop, since otherwise the stress would be on the penultimate syllable. Even though phonetically this glottal stop is often not audible, decisive evidence for its underlying presence comes from a compound like ninu .apilia ‘(fresh) water’.

When two vowels are adjacent across a morpheme boundary in a compound, the vowel of the morpheme in the non-head position is deleted. However, neither of the two vowels in (161) is deleted (i.e., u from ninu and a from apilia). This means that there is no case of vowel adjacency in (161), which can be explained if we assume that the last syllable in ninu is closed by a glottal stop.
As stated by the optional rule in (163), the glottal stop in coda position can also be deleted, which results in vowel lengthening.

In addition, the glottal stop occurs superficially at word boundaries to avoid vocalic clusters between different prosodic words (164). It fulfils what Trubetzkoy (1969) named a ‘demarcative function’. It is a predictable process, as shown below.

In this section, I present contrastive pairs for all consonants (which may have different allophones), mainly in identical but also in analogous (i.e. nearly identical) environments. Phonetically similar segments will be paired. In identical environments, the number of syllables and stress position are strictly identical. In analogous pairs, I tried to select the largest possible number of similar elements.

2.4 Syllable Structure

In Sabanê all consonantal phonemes, except the glottal stop, can occupy the onset position, while the nuclear position is exclusive to vowels. Underlyingly, the coda position can be occupied by the consonants /w v   g  u q /. The possible syllables are /CV/ onset-nucleus, /VC/ nucleus-coda or /CVC/ onsetnucleus-coda.

As will be argued in the section 2.5, the first cycle where syllabification takes place is at the morpheme level.
As was observed before, at the surface level only a small class of sounds may appear in the coda position, as shown in Table 8:

Vowel lengthening is triggered by stress or is compensatory, due to the loss of a nasal consonant in coda position:

2.5 Stress

Nambikwara languages have been regarded as tonal languages (Kingston 1971, Price 1978, Kroeker 2001, inter alia). According to Welmers (1959:2), ‘a tone language is a language in which both pitch phonemes and segmental phonemes

Phonology

71

enter into the composition of at least some morphemes.’ Yip (2003:4, based on Hyman (forthcoming)) claims that ‘A language with tone is one in which an indication of pitch enters into the lexical realization of at least some morphemes.’ Thus, tone is a suprasegmental phenomenon in which pitch differences may correlate with lexical differences. In this vein, Price (1978) describes three tones in the Southern Nambikwara language Kithãulhu: falling, raising, and low (written as superscript 1, 2 and 3, respectively). Kroeker (2001: 81) corroborates this analysis and gives the following examples:

(207)

[ ]  3 1 2 rq z n g n u n

‘I came’ (recent past)

[r q z

]  3 2 2
n g g n un

‘He came’ (recent past)

[r q z

]  2 3 2
n g g n un

‘He is coming’ (present)

Price (1978) and Lévi-Strauss (1948) are the only works that contain transcriptions of Sabanê words, although Lévi-Strauss (1948) does not mention any tone opposition. Price (1978:18-9) observes ‘Sabanê tone has not been studied, but I have the impression that only high and low tones are distinctive.’ Price does not define any criteria for identifying Sabanê tones. I claim that there is no evidence to classify Sabanê as a genuine tone language. Instead, I argue that Sabanê has a predictable stress system in the noun domain as well as in the verbal domain that manifests itself phonetically mainly by pitch. In addition, I will show that the prosodic concept of weight, on the one hand, and the morphological entity root, on the other hand, is crucial for stress assignment.
In the literature that deals with the definition of prosodic domains (cf. Nespor & Vogel 1986, Hayes 1989, Inkelas 1990, etc.), it is observed that some prosodic domains are not present in all languages. Moreover, the absence of phonological rules that refer to a specific domain does not necessarily mean that this prosodic domain should not be set up as part of the prosodic structure of the language (Nespor & Vogel 1986: 12). The prosodic hierarchy is assumed to be universal and includes the following constituents (Nespor & Vogel 1986): syllable (σ), foot (Σ), prosodic word (ω), phonological phrase (φ), intonational phrase (Ι), and utterance (U). Selkirk’s (1984) Strict Layer Hypothesis (Nespor & Vogel 1986) requires that an upper category be formed uniquely by a (sequence of) lower and adjacent category(s) in the hierarchy. This implies that a Prosodic Word contains at least one foot. In Sabanê, the binary foot, in turn, forms a minimal word. In Sabanê, the prosodic word is a crucial prosodic domain. A prosodic word in Sabanê is a word that bears at least a primary stress.
The nominal prosodic word consists of the sequence (possessive pronoun) + root (+ classifier) (+ nominal suffixes) + referential suffix4. Verbal prosodic

4 Parentheses indicate optional elements.

72

Phonology

words include (pronoun) + root + the verbal suffix (+ other verbal suffixes, like imminentive, progressive, etc.) + tense and mood suffixes. The adverbial prosodic word is formed mostly by free forms with no suffixes at all.
Since the descriptions of accent, tone, and pitch in the Nambikwara languages are subject of debate, we will define what stress is in Sabanê, and to what extent it is related to pitch.
As it turns out, tonal differences are not used in Sabanê to differentiate lexical meaning. On the other hand, one does encounter predictable pitch movements on specific syllables, which fact is not used phonologically. We will therefore defend the position that Sabanê has a stress system. As Kager (1993: 367), among many others, states, such a system shows the following characteristics: culminativity: every word has at least one stressed syllable; hierarchy: there is a prominence scale in stressed words; the stress is restricted to certain limits; the system avoids clashes and alternates stressed with unstressed syllables and it does not allows stress assimilation5; stressed syllables maintain more vocalic distinctions, whereas unstressed syllables tend to be weakened by vocalic reduction. In the following sections, stress in nominal domains will be dealt with. After that, based on the principles proposed for nouns, the behaviour of stress in verbal domains will be discussed.
Stress is assigned to any heavy syllables in the nominal root. However, if there are no heavy syllables in the root, stress falls on the penultimate (light) syllable. The open stressed syllable will be lengthened (phonetically, vowels in stressed syllables are, on average, two times longer than in unstressed ones). If, by any chance, there is more than one heavy syllable in a root, the rightmost heavy syllable is stressed.
Vowels in stressed positions generally allow more phonetic distinctions than vowels in unstressed positions. For example, Brazilian Portuguese (Southern and South-eastern dialects) has seven vowels /h j   ¨ t n / in stressed position and five /h j  t n / in unstressed position. Russian has five stressed vowels /h j  t n / and three unstressed ones /h j n /. Sabanê has five underlying vowels /h j  t n / phonetically realized as [h j  ¨  ] in stressed position, and five unstressed ones [§ © ª « ¬ ], respectively.
Vowels that occur in rhythmic stress positions (i.e. in words with three or more syllables) do not have the same duration as vowels that carry main stress. Vowels in iterative stress positions have a longer duration than unstressed vowels, but are shorter than stressed vowels. Moreover, in rhythmic stress position, there are five underlying vowels /h j  t n /, realized as [ ­ e « « ]. The vowels /j t / are neutralized in this position.

5 Mamaindê, as described by Eberhard 2003, allows tone assimilation and sandhi.

Disregarding the referential suffixes –mi or –mali (which are irrelevant to the point below), nouns in Sabanê contain at least two and maximally four syllables6. Simple nouns possess the syllabic patterns described in Table 9, where L stands for a light syllable and H for a heavy one. The characters in bold indicate primary stress position and the asterisk (*) indicates non-existent patterns. Table 9 shows that nominal words with two adjacent heavy syllables do not occur.

In words with more than three syllables, a rule for primary and rhythmic (iterative) stress is active.
Halle & Vergnaud (1987) suggest an autosegmental representation of stress involving a stress plane. In their proposal, ‘the placement of stress reflects an organization of the sequence of stressable elements that is not concerned with the phonological or phonetic substance of these elements’ (1987:46). In Halle & Vergnaud’s proposal, stress is represented in a grid delimited by curly brackets

6 At least at the lexical level, there are few monosyllabic words in Sabanê. While in other

Nambikwara languages, monosyllables are common, in Sabanê they hardly exist. The word

iwta ‘sun’ seems to be a compound from iw– (cf. iwnua ‘star’) and the augmentative suffix

–ta. The class term –ko bares a similar relationship with kinship terms.

that identify the relevant constituents. Therefore, a tier hierarchy is also assumed. The stressability of an element is either assigned by default, that is, all vowels can be stressed, or by rule: in the case of Sabanê, 1) heavy syllables are more prominent than light ones; 2) the penultimate syllable is stressed in case of a word with only light syllables; and 3) secondary stress is iterative and alternating. Furthermore, in compounds the primary stressed syllable of the root in head position is the most prominent of all. Halle & Vergnaud formalize these conditions through the attribution of asterisks (*) on the grid lines and using the symbol ^ to mark the lexical stress of a morpheme, when such morphemes are present in the language7.
On line 0 all vowels receive an asterisk, on lines 1 and 2, each syllable stressed by rule receives an extra asterisk; if necessary, a third line is added to distinguish between primary and secondary stress and to mark the stress in compounds. In this theory, operations such as deletion or insertion of marks in the grid can be achieved by rule. Additionally, three parameters are recognized: boundedness (bounded, unbounded), headedness (left-headed, right-headed) and directionality (left-to-right, right-to-left). The rule that assigns an extra asterisk to heavy syllables is crucial to the analysis of Sabanê stress. Applying these parameters to the Sabanê data results in the following representations:

ali / / n i u h [ ] r  o } § ‘sloth’

In the following examples (211-214), stress is assigned to heavy syllables, even when these are word-final:

When a heavy syllable occupies the final position in a trisyllabic word, a secondary stress is assigned to the antepenultimate vowel. This vowel is shorter than a fully stressed vowel and longer than an unstressed one. Therefore, in the grid’s representation an extra line is added to show that such a word has a primary stress and a secondary stress. The rhythmic stress rule (shown in italics) applies after the assignment of primary stress. Hence, in order to obtain the correct rhythmic output, (at least) two cycles are necessary.

In nominal compounds that consist of a noun followed by another noun, stress is assigned following the general rule. This rule states that a heavy syllable in each root or, in the absence of a heavy syllable, the penultimate light syllable in each root is stressed. Compounds that consist of a noun followed by a classifier have the noun as their head. This implies a prosodic distinction between these structures and noun-noun compounds. The concept of root is crucial to stress assignment in any case.
Example (226) shows a nominal root kolowa ‘string’ followed by a classifier –api ‘CL: LONG FLX’. Stress is assigned to the penultimate syllable in the root, which in this case surfaces as heavy as a consequence of gemination. The classifier is invisible to primary stress assignment although it is visible to secondary stress.

Nominal compounds formed by juxtaposition of two nouns have two stresses (one in each root); however, at the compound level, primary stress is assigned to the head of the compound. In the following representation (simplified), the steps to obtain this result include the assignment of asterisks to all vowels, followed by the attribution of stress on the basis of weight, assignment of secondary stress to each word and, finally, assignment of the primary stress based on compound headedness.

Words formed by derivational processes (noun+derivational suffix) such as for example diminutive suffixation, show that these suffixes are unstressed and do not have lexical stress. Hence, in the examples (232-233), primary stress is assigned to the root, while the secondary stress on the bound morpheme –mata ‘diminutive’, is assigned as a result of rhythm.

However, a small group of lexical items are exceptional to the rules of stress placement proposed above. All these words have a glide that occurs after the third vowel in the word, counting from right to left. In these words, exceptionally, the third vowel is accented, even if there is a heavy syllable to its right:

‘dog; jaguar’

Maybe these words are old compounds that are no longer recognized as such, but which maintain synchronically the original compound stress. One interesting example is wayulu, which means ‘dog’ or ‘jaguar’ in Sabanê. In the Northern Nambikwara language Latundê (Telles 2002: 168, 170), these words are expressed by different roots: °wa± jn- for ‘dog’ and loh- for ‘jaguar’. It is our guess that the Sabanê word combines both roots. This hypothesis gains even more plausability when considering the fact that in most of the Nambikwara languages roots are usually monosyllabic, whereas such roots are very rare in Sabanê. Also, four of the words listed above (daliwulu, kowayiti, nanayiku,

80

Phonology

and tapawulu) share an identical sound sequence with another word, suggesting the presence of some opaque internal morphological structure. The word oyunta may contain the augmentative suffix –ta, in which case its stress is regular. Finally, words like aymoti or nanayiku may contain a common morpheme ay for specific types of insects. However, in the absence of sufficient evidence, we will provisionally assume that stress in these words is marked in the lexicon.
Stress is also predictable in free morphemes like adverbs. In this category of words, the heavy syllable of the root is stressed or, in case there is none, the penultimate syllable is. In the following examples, curly brackets {} indicate independent stress domains.

As far as the verbal domain is concerned, the sequence of a verbal root with its suffixes is regarded as one prosodic word. In section 3.3, all verbal suffixes, such as ‘progressive’, ‘desiderative’, ‘quotative’, etc., will be presented in detail.
In verbal domains, primary stress is assigned to the rightmost heavy syllable of the root or, in the absence of a heavy syllable, to the penultimate syllable, although roots that contain only light syllables are rare. In (235), the verbal root ilul ‘to eat’ is syllabified as i.lul; therefore, primary stress is assigned to the heavy syllable lul. Sabanê does not allow onsetless syllables, so the coda must

Phonology

81

be syllabified immediately after stress assignment. The procedure shows that the first round of syllabification must happen at the level of the morpheme, because at the word level /l/ is no longer in coda position and, consequently, no longer adds weight to the preceding syllable.

In the form amaylitelon ‘It is going to rain’ (236), there are two heavy syllables: may and lon. The first syllable may belongs to the root, and lon is part of the evidential future suffix. In this case, primary stress is assigned to the root and a secondary stress is assigned to the heavy syllable of the suffix.

In example (237), primary stress is assigned to the root. Then, in the absence of unstressed syllables, at the word level, rhythmic stress is assigned in such a way that an alternating pattern emerges.

A prosodic word corresponding to a verb with only one heavy syllable is rare. When more than one heavy syllable occurs, rhythmic stresses are assigned to any heavy syllable outside the root.

In some words, two heavy syllables are adjacent. This situation would result in a stress clash, if primary stress were assigned to both syllables. Such a clash is avoided if primary stress is assigned to the heavy syllable in the root only. In the sentence in (240a), primary stress is assigned to the root al ‘to walk’. The secondary stress is assigned as in (237).

(240a)

al –i to walk –VS / / n u x h x n u x h [ ] r n o i u h i { n | i u h ‘S/he walks.’

–al –PRES NEUT

–i –ASSR

In addition, the syllable in the root will be more prominent in terms of duration and vowel quality when two heavy syllables are adjacent, one in the root and another one outside the root, as shown in (240b).

(240b)

al –i to walk –VS / / n u x h x g v n u x h [ ] µ
rn o i {³ ´ £ i v n i {u h |
‘S/he walked.’

–ntal –PRET NEUT

–i –ASSR

In the example sentence (240b), primary stress is also assigned to the verbal root. However, at least at the level of the prosodic word, the following syllable is also a heavy syllable, due to the fact that the nasal consonant in –ntal ‘PRET

EV’ is at that level syllabified as a coda: [ m  ]. Although adjacent to a stressed
syllable, this newly formed heavy syllable creates the impression of being stressed, as a consequence of being phonetically marked with a higher pitch. The primary stressed vowel keeps its usual characteristics, such as longer duration,

Phonology

83

vowel quality and the like. In the same way, a higher pitch is attributed to the final heavy syllable of –telon ‘FUT EV’, in a sequence like (241). Both facts lead to the assumption that the rise in pitch is associated with the presence of a heavy syllable outside the root and not to a specific morpheme. Eventually, every heavy syllable outside of the root is realized with prominence. In our view, Price (1978) misunderstood this type of occurrence (predictable high pitch) as phonological tone.

Stress is assigned independently to each prosodic word in a sentence. In (242), for example, primary stress is assigned to the heavy syllable way in the nominal domain and rhythmically to lu. In the verbal domain, in turn, the heavy syllable –nan in the root receives primary stress and, as already discussed, the following heavy syllable receives pitch-accent and then stress is iteratively assigned.

When an adverb occurs in a verbal function, it is regarded as a verb for the sake of stress assignment. Verb domains are formed by verbal roots, verbal adjectives, or verbal adverbs followed by verbal suffixes. In (243), amulu ‘only’ is inflected as a verb. Stress is assigned in this form as it is in verbs.

In (243), stress is assigned to the penultimate syllable because there are no heavy syllables in the verbal root.
From the foregoing discussion, we conclude that stress and rhythm in Sabanê is regulated by three mechanisms. One attributes stress to the root, taking syllable weight into account. Two other processes are active at the level of the prosodic word. Of these, one applies to heavy syllables, which are made phonetically prominent through the realization of a rise in pitch. The other one assigns rhythmic stresses to the remaining syllables in such a way that over the prosodic word domain an alternating pattern emerges of stressed and stressless syllables.

2.6 Phonological Processes

In this section, it will be shown that the prosodic domain functions as a conditioning category in the operation of a number of phonological rules.
Nominal compounds, must be regarded as two prosodic words, as can be concluded from the distribution of full and reduced vowels, which is readily explained under the assumption of compounds consisting of two independent prosodic words. Inside compounds, across word boundaries, vowel deletion may occur if the first component ends in a vowel and the second component begins with a vowel (as shown in 244), whether the latter are different from (cf. examples (245) or identical with the former (cf. examples in (246-247). (The symbol – stands for a morpheme boundary.)

When two vowels or a glide and a vowel that belong to different prosodic words are adjacent, a glottal stop [Û ] is inserted between them. This process does not occur between the parts of a compound, where, as we have illustrated above, vowel deletion occurs.

As expected, glottal insertion does not occur if there is a vowel-consonant sequence at a prosodic domain boundary, as shown in (253). In summary, onsetless syllables, in general, and hiatuses, in particular, are avoided across different prosodic words in Sabanê.

3 Morphology
3.1 Introduction
The aim of this chapter is to describe Sabanê Noun and Verb Morphology. I will start with exposing the morphology of the Noun. In the second part of this chapter, the verbal morphology will be discussed.

3.2 Noun Morphology

3.2.1 Introduction

Nouns are used to name entities, substances, individuals, and places. Formally, the nominal domain consists of optional and obligatory elements. Possessive pronouns, derivational suffixes, and classifiers are all optional components. The root is obligatory. Referential suffixes are obligatory when a word is pronounced out of context, but it is optional in sentences.

3.2.2 Root and Morphological Word

Sabanê noun roots are bound morphemes and the noun root corresponds exactly to the lexical form. In isolation, the root is obligatory followed by a referential suffix. In context, roots can be followed by inflectional or derivational morphology (Table 10).

Table 10: The Noun

(CLASS) –anon
–isi –amoka –akata
–api –inun –iawa

–INFL
–REF –mi/ –mali
–OBJ –k

According to Payne (1997: 26), ‘Inflectional operations are those which are required by the syntactic environment in which a root appears. Inflectional operations do not normally alter the basic meaning of the concept expressed;

90

Noun Morphology

rather, they ground the concept expressed by a root according to place, time, participant referent, etc.’ In Sabanê, possessive pronouns (prefixes), and referential suffixes are part of the inflectional operations. On the other hand, classification is part of derivation because it generates new lexical items through affixation of bound morphemes to the root. Apart from that, compounding combines two or more roots to create a new lexical item.
In the following examples, kiliwa, tapawulu, ulununu, alowa and kiatatapuntawi are nominal items followed by –mi ‘REF’.

(01) kiliwa –mi house –REF ‘house’

(02) tapawulu clay pot ‘clay pot’

–mi –REF

(03) ulununu capuchin monkey ‘capuchin monkey’

–mi –REF

(04) alowa –mi jucum –REF ‘jucum’ (Bactris setosa)

(05) kiata tapun –t –awi –mi corn black –LINK –seed –REF ‘black corn seed’

As expected, some compounds have become lexicalized roots, as for

example, apiawa ‘wooden board/spoon’, which is a diachronically formed

complex word. The word can be decomposed into two parts: api ‘wood’ plus

iawa ‘bark’, resulting in ‘wooden bark’. However, the two formatives api and

iawa are nowadays classifiers. Synchronically, apiawa behaves like a root: it

has only one primary stress [ ¡ ¢ £

¤ ¥¡

¦§

¨

¡ ] and its internal structure is opaque to

any morphophonemic rules.

Noun Morphology

(07) kiliwa.apiawa house.wooden bark ‘wooden house’

–tanon –CL:HEMI

–mi –REF

Nouns in Sabanê can be morphologically marked with –k ‘OBJ’, as shown in (10). Moreover, when one of the components of a compound is not individually recognized as a morpheme, even though one or more of its components is recognized as such, the compound is treated as a root. For example, in oto.poka ‘bow’, the first component oto ‘arrow’ was identified as a morpheme (08). However, poka does not occur as an independent morpheme. Supposedly, poka was an ancient root; however, currently, it occurs only in the word ‘bow’ (09).

In the same way, the component pi, as in wayulupi ‘guara wolf/cat’, was not documented elsewhere; for this reason, I will consider it as part of the root.

sa –n to catch –VS

3.2.3 Referential Suffixes

When pronounced in isolation, a noun must be followed by a referential suffix –mali or –mi (a truncated form of –mali) The suffix –mali is used when the noun is pronounced in isolation, whereas –mi is found in isolated nouns as well as in sentences.

(13) kiata –mali *kiata kiata –mi *kiata corn –REF ‘corn/a piece of corn/the corn’

kiata –mi uni

corn –REF to be good

–REF to not have

‘S/he does not have a small paca.’

–n –dana –VS –PRES EV

(15) anolota –mi meat –REF ‘meat’

–i –ASSR

(16) hala –n –mina –dana to stink –VS –NEG –PRES EV ‘The meat does not stink.’

anolota –mi meat –REF

The hypothesis according to which the particles –mali and –mi could be definite and indefinite articles is refuted below by an example with a possessive pronoun, because possessives and determiners exclude each other in Sabanê. Likewise, the construction in (17) with an indefinite interpretation of –mi, and a possessive pronoun is cross-linguistically not common.

(17) d– anase –mi 1POSS– head –REF ‘my head’ *‘one my head’

Referential suffixes are also joined to classifiers, when the latter are used as anaphors.

3.2.4 Lack of Gender

Corbett (1991 and references cited) states that the best way to show the existence of grammatical gender is to look for an agreement system outside the noun. That is, in a system where gender categories are in opposition, nouns must be in the same class of agreement (as expressed through morphological marking) under diverse conditions. In Sabanê, these agreement markers do not exist: there is no morphological opposition between feminine or masculine (or neuter), or between animate and inanimate.
Biological gender must be inferred from the context in which a sentence is used, if possible. Thus, a sentence such as wolawayulu tipintali means ‘I saw many male jaguars’, or ‘I saw many female jaguars’, or ‘I saw many jaguars’, the latter being the unmarked interpretation1.

(22) wola wayulu t– ip –i –ntal many jaguar 1OBJ– to see –VS –PRET NEUT ‘I saw many jaguars (males and females).’

–i –ASSR

If it is necessary to distinguish between male and female, the speaker has a lexical option, which is to name them as ati ‘male’ or atitapa ‘female’2.

(23) t– ip –i –ntal

–i

1OBJ– to see –VS –PRET NEUT –ASSR

totali

ati –isi

–n

three-banded armadillo male –CL:RDN

–VS

–ntal

–i

–PRET NEUT –ASSR

‘I saw a male three-banded armadillo.’

(Lit. I saw a three-banded armadillo, it was a male.’)

1 Because gender is usually distinguished for animals in Brazilian Portuguese, Sabanê native
speakers very often confuse female and male when they are speaking Portuguese. 2 Since the suffix –tapa was not found elsewhere, I consider atitapa as a single lexical item.

(Lit. I saw a three-banded armadillo, it was a female.’)

Sabanê also has the lexical means to express an opposition between maysili ‘younglings’ maysunon ‘male youngling’, and maytelon ‘female youngling’. This use of the morpheme maysili is interesting, because it is also used to refer to lexical items in the diminutive plural form.
(25) wayulu maysunon3 ‘male puppy’

wayulu maytelon ‘female puppy’

wayulu maysili ‘puppies’ (male or female)

cf. wayulu–mata maysili

dog–DIM

younglings

‘tiny puppies’

Again, a clear-cut morpheme may seems to emerge from the words maysili, maysunon, and maytelon; however, sili, sunon, and telon are exclusive to these forms. Therefore, they are treated as independent roots, although they are not entirely opaque.

3.2.5 Number and Numerals
Like for Gender, there are no morphological markers for number in Sabanê. In Sabanê neither nouns nor verbs show evidence of number marking, like in the neighbouring Tupian language Kanoê (Bacelar 2004).

3 wayulu means ‘dog’.

96

Noun Morphology

The morphemes ano and wola/wolata are used to express plurality, meaning ‘much/many/a lot’, whereas the litotic construction ano–n–mina expresses ‘few/some’. In the sentences (26-31), ano is a quantifier, while wola(ta) is an adverb. Both words are commonly employed in sentence-initial position.

(31) wola kali

‘It is really warm.’/‘What a hot day!’

–i –ASSR

There is also a lack of ordinal and cardinal numerals. Native speakers make use of verbal adverbs, such as amulu ‘one/only/just’. Sometimes, kata is also used for the numeral ‘one’ (it can occur simultaneously with amulu). Moreover, there is a ‘DUAL’ form, bala (cf. 3.2.6). The numeral ‘three’ is the result of concatenation of amulu and bala. All numerals are predicative forms. Since there are no verbs referring to possession, Sabanê expresses possesion by means of existential constructions.

Noun Morphology

The numeral ‘three’ is obtained by concatenating kata and bala; however, there is no strict order between these components, as shown in (39). In the former case, kata precedes bala, whereas in the latter the opposite order obtains.

Another option to express ‘three’ is shown in (40):

(40) bala.amulu –n –al

–i

two.one

–VS –PRES NEUT –ASSR

‘It is three.’

The variation shown in (39-40) indicates just how artificial numeral constructions are. Preferably, Sabanê speakers make use of structures ano–n–mina ‘few’, or ano/wola ‘much/many’ when there is a need to specify quantities. Moreover, the elders are unfamiliar in general with numbers, even after almost fifty years of contact with non-Indians. The relationship with numbers, in general, and with arithmetic in particular is poor and it is limited to currency transactions.
Telles (2002) classifies numeral constructions as verbal numeral constructions in Latundê. The author claims that verbal numeral constructions and verbal adjective constructions are alike. The same generalization can be extended to Sabanê, as far as numerals are concerned.

3.2.6 Possessives

Possessive pronouns are not compulsory and their use depends on speakers’ intentions instead of structural restrictions. Possessive pronouns, except bala–, and object pronouns share the same form.

Apart from bala–, possessive pronouns have two allomorphs: preceding vowels, these pronouns are realized as d– [ ], p– [p], m– [ ], and zero, whereas preceding consonants they are realized as da– [  ], pi– [pi], ma– [  ], and a– [ ]. Below, the first person singular is exemplified in (41-42), and the first person plural is shown in (43-44).

(41) d– apipa –mi 1POSS– hand –REF ‘my hand’

(42) da– kiliwa –mi 1POSS– house –REF ‘my house’

apikata table

–mali –REF

(44) pi– 1POSS PL– ‘our home’

kiliwa house

–mali –REF

The DUAL form bala– [¥  ¡ ¦  ¡ ] is used to refer to a dual possessive pronoun that simultaneously includes the first and the third person pronouns.

(45) bala– kiliwa –mali DUAL– house –REF ‘our (me + you) house’

3.2.7 Further Issues on Possessiveness

There is no morphological marking in nominal compounds, as shown in (55-56). Instead, the relation between determiner and head is marked syntactically, such that the rightmost noun is interpreted as the head of the compound. Compounded nouns may express possession, as in the following examples:

(55) maysunon.wayulu boy.dog ‘boy’s dog’

–mi –REF

(56) Gabliel.maliwunon Gabriel.bucket ‘Gabriel’s bucket’

–mi –REF

Predicative sentences are also used to describe possession:

(57) kapila.mata

Alienability is not morphologically distinct in Sabanê, i.e., nouns can be alienable as well as inalienable. Therefore, a noun like ‘head’ does not necessarily have a possessive pronoun resulting in ‘my head’. This issue is important because compulsory inalienability is widespread in Nambikwaran languages. Inalienability is frequently marked in these languages by a–. Although the presence of an inalienability element is not explicit in Sabanê, the fact that all nouns referring to human body parts or animal parts begin with vowels (i or a, except in owayna ‘foot’) must be more than a mere coincidence (table 12).
In addition, the different initial vowels cannot be explained as the result of a phonological process of assimilation. Januacele Costa (personal communication) claims that the initial vowels in these words are vestiges of an inalienability morpheme in Proto-Nambikwara. Hein van der Voort (personal communication)

5 Morpheme boundaries are marked by . .

links these vowels to an areal feature, because the same vowels are found as morphemes in the Tupian languages of Rondônia and Mato Grosso.

3.2.8 Derivation
According to Payne (1997:25), ‘Derivational operations are defined as operations which derive an inflectable stem from a root or an intermediate stem.’ Thus, in Sabanê, derivational processes include the formation of the diminutive and augmentative, presented in detail in the following sections.

3.2.8.1 Diminutive

There are three ways to express the notion of diminutive in Sabanê: a) by a derivational suffix –mata; b) by predicative construction ilaw–n–mina–al–i ‘S/he/It is not big.’; and c) by a lexical compound involving the free forms maysili, maysunon, maytelon and sukwin.
The nominal suffix –mata expresses the general notion ‘diminutive’ and is very productive:

(59) wayulu –mi dog –REF ‘dog’

wayulu.mata –mi

dog.DIM

–REF

(60) yowla –mi knife –REF ‘knife’

Noun Morphology

bottle gourd.DIM–REF to not have

cat.DIM

–REF to cry –VS

–al

–i

–PRES NEUT –ASSR

‘The small cat is meowing.’

–say –PROG

Another way to express the diminutive is by a noun followed by ilaw–n–mina–al–i (lit.: ‘it is not big’). The classifier is optional in this construction:

(63) kolu kolu





–k ilaw

(a pair of) scissors

–OBJ to be big

–al

–i

–PRES NEUT –ASSR

‘The wooden scissors are small.’

(Lit. ‘The wooden scissors are not big’.)

–n –mina –VS –NEG

(64) kolu kolu

–mina –al

–i

–NEG –PRES NEUT –ASSR

‘The wooden scissors are small.’

(Lit. ‘The wooden scissors are not big’.)

The concept ‘small size’ can also be expressed through the lexical items maysili, maysunon and maytelon ‘younglings’, ‘male youngling’ and ‘female youngling’, in that order. Nonetheless, these three items often occur as free forms:

(65) maysunon –mi ilaw

–n

male youngling –REF to be big

–VS

–al

–i

–PRES NEUT –ASSR

‘The boy is fat.’

Noun Morphology

105

(66) maytelon

–k yotop

–an

female youngling

–OBJ to know

–al

–i

(67) maysili

–k amun –n

younglings –OBJ to sleep –VS

‘The children slept.’

–ntal –PRET NEUT

–i –ASSR

However, these lexical items are frequently used in diminutive compounds:

(68) maysili ‘younglings’ (generic) cf. olumata maysili ‘bull calves’

(69) maysunon ‘male youngling’ cf. olumata maysunon ‘male bull calf’

(70) maytelon ‘female youngling’ cf. olumata maytelon ‘female bull calf’

When it is used as a determiner, maysili ‘younglings’ refers to animate beings. However, its general use is not restricted to animate beings. It can be used for any element to which the diminutive plural notion can be applied. Therefore, maysili must be understood as a form of diminutive plural:

(71) kapila

–mi

bottle gourd –REF

‘small bottle gourd’

(72) kapila.maysili

–mi

bottle gourd.younglings –REF

‘small bottle gourds’

(73) maliwu.anon –mi bucket.CL: HEMI –REF ‘bucket’

106

Noun Morphology

(74) maliwu.anon.maysili bucket.CL: HEMI.younglings ‘small buckets’

–mi –REF

On the other hand, the words maysunon or maytelon cannot be combined with terms related to inanimate beings or to individuals whose gender/sex distinction is not (clearly) defined, such as for example an earthworm. In this case, the suffix –mata is the appropriate diminutive form.

(75) yuya.mata –mi earthworm.DIM –REF ‘small earthworm’

yuya.maysili

–mi

earthworm.younglings –REF

‘small earthworms’

*yuya.maytelon–mi

*yuya.maysunon–mi

(76) tapawulu.mata –mi clay pot.DIM –REF ‘small clay pot’

tapawulu.maysili

–mi

clay pot.younglings –REF

‘small clay pots’

*tapawulu.maysunon

*tapawulu.maytelon

Structures that involve the use of a lexical diminutive have some pragmatic complexities. For example, a compound like dodamaysili ‘white-lipped peccary piglets’, is accepted by all informants. However, when the lexical diminutive maysili is used for an animal that generally has only one youngling per pregnancy, as for example, a tapir, the form olumamaysili ‘tapir younglings’, although formally correct, is rejected by all informants. This plural meaning goes against their ‘cultural knowledge’ because Sabanê speakers know that an animal like a tapir can only give birth to a single young at the time.
The productivity of this way of expressing diminutive meaning can also be observed when the Sabanê use a Portuguese loanword representing a (relatively) small object, in which case they will always use maysili, as in pilhamaysili ‘baby batteries’, from Portuguese pilha ‘battery’.

Noun Morphology

107

The morpheme sukwin ‘small/few’ is less productive than –mata. Differently than the diminutive suffix, sukwin is usually followed by the classifier.

sukwin small/few

Moreover, the root sukwin also occurs as a free morpheme meaning ‘small/little’ or ‘few’.

(79) towali sukwin 1SUBJ little ‘I ate just a little.’

ilul –i to eat –VS

–datinan –PRET EV

(80) sukwin –mi little –REF ‘little’

3.2.8.2 Augmentative

The augmentative meaning can be expressed by way of two strategies. The first of these involves a noun followed by a predicative construction (default), for example ilawnali ‘It is big.’.

(81) yowla –mi ilaw knife –REF to be big ‘The knife is big.’

–n –al

(83) asasi –mi ilaw leaf –REF to be big ‘The leaf is big.’

–n –al

The second strategy is the affixation of the augmentative suffix –ta to a noun. However, these structures may have two results: 1) simple augmentation, as shown in (84-85); and 2) species discrimination, as shown in (86-88).

–mi –REF

(85) aypo –mi axe –REF ‘axe’

aypo.ta axe.AUGM ‘big axe’

–mi –REF

Sometimes, –ta can be incorporated into a lexical item and cause it to
behave like a simple noun, i.e., being internally opaque to any morphophonemic
rule. Discrimination among fauna and flora species usually is linguistically marked by –ta6.

(86) wani –mi turkey –REF ‘turkey’

wanita –mi rhea –REF ‘rhea’ (Rhea Americana)

6 In Sararé (Borella, personal communication) a similar process occurs, as exemplified by hika–su ‘tree (gen.)’ and hika–eta–su ‘Aroeira tree (Schinus molle)’, kwikwik–su ‘green lime’, and kwikwik–eta–su ‘orange’.

When the suffix –ta is used to discriminate between species, the augmentation of the resulting noun can only be obtained using a predicative construction, as shown in (88)-(90).

As was already pointed out, Sabanê has very few monosyllabic words. However, the word for ‘sun’ seems to be a compound form that consists of the morphemes iw– + –ta, where –ta is the augmentative suffix, because the same sequence iw– occurs in the semantically related word iwnua ‘star’. Like all forms in which an augmentative is embedded, the speakers do not form augmentatives from words which already have this suffix, such as *iwtata ‘big sun’. To express the notion of ‘big sun’, the predicative construction is used.

3.2.9 Compounds

Payne (1997: 92-3) states two basic criteria for defining a compound: first, semantic criteria imply that the ‘dominant semantic property of compounds is that the meaning of a compound is either more specific or entirely different than the combined meanings of the words that make up the compound.’ In the following example7, the compound that refers to the ‘spotted jaguar’ is composed of the words wayulu ‘jaguar’ and tapayli ‘pacoba tree’. In fact, in the eyes of the Sabanê the fur of the ‘spotted jaguar’ resembles the design typical of the pacoba tree and its fruits. Thus, the meaning of the compound wayulutapaylimi cannot be derived from the meaning of its formatives, wayulu and tapayli. Compound processes mainly serve to name animals and people. Compounding is very productive in Sabanê, in which language the default compound has the structure [NOUN+NOUN]. There are few compounds with the structure [NOUN+VERB] or [NOUN+IDEOPHONE].

(91) wayulu –mi jaguar –REF ‘jaguar’

tapayli –mi pacoba –REF ‘pacoba’

wayulu.tapayli –mi jaguar.pacoba –REF ‘spotted jaguar’

(92) wayulu.wayulupi
dog.cat ‘cat dog’8

–mi –REF

(93) ate.mitawkosi –mi man.spider –REF ‘spiderman’

7 One must bear in mind that there are many different kinds of jaguar in South America, such
as the red jaguar, the spotted jaguar, etc. 8 The first compound in (92) was created to name a cartoon character called ‘cat-dog’. The
example in (93) refers to the action-hero ‘Spiderman’.

Noun Morphology

111

In Sabanê, compound structures can also be identified on the basis of the

obligatory application of a number of phonological rules, which were discussed

in the chapter on phonology. For example when the nouns /

/ + / / are ¤ ¡ ! ¡

¤" #

combined, as in (94), the initial vowel of the second component [¤ ] is deleted:

[ ]. ¤ ¥ ¡

¦! 

"#

¢

(94) kiata.isu corn.bone ‘corncob’

–mi –REF

cf. kiata –mi corn –REF ‘corn’

isu –mi bone –REF ‘bone’

The internal structure of a compound is opaque to morphology. Consequently, a referential suffix cannot be attached to the first component of a compound, because it would violate its integrity.

(95) kiata.isu

–mi

corn.bone

–REF

‘corn cob’

*kiata–mi.isu–mi

*kiata–mi.isu

*kiata.isu

As far as derivational morphology is concerned, compounds behave like units; therefore, a derivational process like diminutive formation must be applied to the compound as a whole, as is illustrated in (96).

In Nambikwara languages in general, verbal adjectives demand verbal morphology. In Sabanê, verbal adjectives may be used to form new nouns in [NOUN+VERBAL ADJECTIVE] compounds:

–t– awi –isi –LINK– tooth –CD: RND

–mi –REF

Contrary to what we have seen in attributive compounds, the head is located in the rightmost position in genitive compounds. The resulting compound denotes a part or a subclass of the head noun (cf. 95).

(101) kokwayli horse ‘horse tail’

isey –mi tail –REF

(102) wayulu.pi cat ‘cat tail’

isey –mi tail –REF

In semantically less transparent structures, the genitive relation is not always evident. However, the class/subclass correlation remains.

(104) waysili

Sequences consisting of NOUN + NOUN + CLASSIFIER are considered to be structured as [NOUN+NOUN][CLASSIFIER], where the classifier, despite having prosodic-word status, is a derivational suffix with phonological-word status. The scope of the classifier is not necessarily the head of the compound. This choice is based on pragmatics rather than on any formal criteria. In the examples (106) kiliwa-apiawa-t-anon-mi ‘wooden house’ and (107) kiliwa-tapuli-t-anon-mi ‘stone house’, the scope of the classifier is ‘house’ rather than ‘wooden bark’ or ‘stone’:

(106) kiliwa apiawa house wooden bark ‘wooden house’

–tanon –CL: HEMI

–mi –REF

(107) kiliwa tapuli –tanon house stone –CL:HEMI ‘stone house’

–mi –REF

In (108), however, the scope of the classifier is takayli ‘lid’ rather than the head tapawulu.

(108) tapawulu

takayli –iawa

clay pot

lid

–CL: BARK

‘clay pot’s lid’

–mi –REF

One may conclude that Sabanê uses compounding to express attributive relations, in which structures the head is located at the right edge of the compound, and genitive relations, where the head is located at the left edge of the compound.

3.2.10 Classifiers
3.2.10.1 Classifier Suffixes
There are seven classifier suffixes (henceforth classifiers) in Sabanê. A classifier denotes a physical property, like shape or consistency, of a noun. However, classifiers are not attributives and do not serve to discriminate among objects or

114

Noun Morphology

things. Classifiers are optional, although quite frequent. Despite the fact that in Sabanê classifiers are not so productive as in Latundê/Lakondê (Telles 2002) or Nambikwara do Sul (Lowe 1999), Sabanê speakers are able to identify them and even explain their semantic relevance.
In some circumstances, mainly to avoid hiatus, but also when the noun to which the classifier is added ends in / /, epenthetic consonants t or l (the latter is
$
rare) are (optionally) placed between nouns and classifiers.

In Sabanê, nouns are classified in seven different classes, according to the shape or consistency of the concept to which a given noun refers. For example, the most frequent classifier is –akata, which refers to ‘long wooden-like objects’. The classifier –isi refers to objects whose shapes are round, oblong, or oval. The classifier –iawa is assigned to ‘bark-like’ shapes, while –amoka connects ‘larvae and snake-like’ elements. The classifier –api is assigned to ‘string-like’ objects, but, differently from all other classifiers, it is compulsory. The classifiers –anon referring to ‘hemispheric’ shapes and –akata referring to elongated three-dimensional objects were not found as independent single nouns. Below I list and illustrate these classifiers.

(a) –anon CL: HEMI: shallow or hemispheric objects, with a recipient hole, including clay pots, pans, calabashes, glass, rainbows, houses, cars, etc.;

3.2.10.2 Anaphoric Use of Classifiers

Any classifier can be used anaphorically, replacing a noun already mentioned in the discourse. In the following example, the classifier –anon ‘CL: HEMI’ replaces the noun a–motoka ‘her/his calabash’.

(141)

anon

–mi san –n t– osa –n

CL: HEMI

–REF to catch –VS 1OBJ– to give –VS

‘Catch it (her/his calabash) and give it to me!’

(Context: the informant wants to show a calabash with an unusual

form.)

In (142), the classifier iawa replaces the compound d–api.kata.l.iawa, ‘my boat’.

Noun Morphology

119

iawa katatali

CL:BARK white man –REF to stay –VS

–i

–PRES NEUT –ASSR

‘The white man stays on my boat.’

(Context: An Indian is asking somebody what is the best place (on

several boats) for a white man.)

In these types of constructions, classifiers occupy the same syntactic position as their referents.

(143)

isi –mi ii

–i –al

–i

CD: RND–REF to be hot

–VS –PRES NEUT –ASSR

‘It (pepper) is hot.’

(Context: in a conversation about peppers, the informant shows which

one is the hottest.)

The classifier also occurs without any referential suffix:

(144)

akata

bala –n –al

–i

CL:LONG

DUAL –VS –PRES NEUT –ASSR

‘There are two (arrowroots).’ (Maranta arundinacea)

(Context: someone asks about how many types of arrowroot fruits there

are in a basket.)

CL:RDN DUAL –VS –QUOT –PRET NEUT –ASSR

‘It is said that she had twins.’

(Context: the informant talks about a relative who had twins although

the informant has never seen them.)

Sometimes, a head of a compound can be replaced by its classifier alone:

(148)

katatali

tapuli –anon

–mi

white man

stone –CL:HEMI

–REF

yey –i –al

–i

to stay –VS –PRES NEUT –ASSR

‘The white man lives in the stone (house).’

When a classifier occurs after a free morpheme like sukwin, it has an anaphoric function and serves the purpose of specifying the part of the compound to which the diminutive word refers to, i.e., the head or the determiner. In (149) and (150) for example, the same compound has two different classifiers in anaphoric function: in (149) the classifier –tanon is linked to tapawulu ‘clay pot’, whereas the classifier –tiawa in (150) refers to takayli ‘lid’. Therefore, the choice of the anaphoric classifier resides with the speaker and his/her will to distinguish any component pragmatically.

(149) tapawulu

takayli.iawa

clay pot

lid.CL: BARK

‘lid of a small clay pot’

sukwin –tanon small –CL: HEMI

(150) tapawulu

takayli.iawa

clay pot

lid.CL: BARK

‘small lid of a clay pot.’

sukwin –tiawa small –CL: BARK

–mi –REF

Although optional as a rule, some classifiers are compulsory in a few specific words when they function as simple nouns. In compounds, however, classifiers referring to a simple noun are optional. In (151), for example, tapulisi ‘stone’ contains a classifier for round-like shapes, –isi. When used as a simple noun, tapuli is ungrammatical. Nonetheless, in compounds, tapuli is acceptable. This is due to the fact that a classifier always refers to the head of a compound. Consequently, if tapulisi is used as the second member of the compound, tapuli is immediately interpreted as the head, in which case the attributive relation expressed by the compound in (152) is changed to a genitive interpretation in

Noun Morphology

121

(153), meaning ‘stone of a house’. In (152) the relation is attributive while in (153) it is genitive.

*kiliwa–tapuli–isi–mi (meaning ‘stone house’)

The same can be stated for the examples in (154-155). In (154), apilapi has an embedded classifier, while in (155) the classifier refers to the head of the compound.

(154) apili –api

–mi t– osa –n

embira –CL: LONG FLX –REF 1OBJ– to give –VS

‘Give the embira-string to me!’

(155) anose apili –tanon bowl embira –CL:HEMI ‘embira-string bowl’

–mi –REF

As is to be expected, words containing a classifier that is no longer interpreted as such synchronically, as in kolowapi , diachronically derived from kolowa+api, ‘string’, may receive a synchronically transparent classifier, as is shown below:

(156) kolowapi

–mi

cotton string –REF

‘(cotton) string’

(diachronically: kolowa.api)

It is sometimes difficult to separate optional from compulsory classifiers in simple nouns. In this respect, derivational processes can be helpful. In (158), kanaysi ‘pepper’ seems to contain an opaque classifier –isi, as can be inferred by a derived word such as kanaysi.ta ‘sweet red pepper’.

(158) ?kanay.isi –mi pepper.CL: RDN –REF ‘pepper’

or ?kanaysi pepper ‘pepper’

(159) kanaysi.ta –mi pepper.AUGM –REF ‘sweet red pepper’

3.2.10.3 Classifier as a Derivational Suffix
Classifiers also occur in nouns formed by noun + verbal adjectives. The basic configuration is:
(160) NOUN-(VERBAL ADJECTIVE)-(LIG)-CLASSIFIER-REF

Noun Morphology

123

Formally, the classifier behaves like a derivational suffix, changing any verb or verbal adjective into a noun. The new noun can be subject or object in a sentence. Like any noun in isolation, it must be followed by a referential suffix.

The nominal status of the noun + verbal adjective structures is derived from the obligatory presence of the referential suffix when this sequence occurs in isolation:

(166) kiata.ayn.takata corn.red.CL: LONG ‘red corn’

–mi –REF

(167) kiata.pan.takata

–mi

corn.white.CL: LONG –REF

‘white corn’ (a species)

Nonetheless, classifiers are optional in noun + verbal adjectives constructions as well. In (168), for example, a noun plus a simple noun results in a compound.

3.2.10.4 Class Terms

A class term (CT) is a suffix that is attached only to a very specific class of words, viz. kinship terms. Although obsolescent, such a suffix is obligatory in every kinship term. The suffix often occurs reduplicated (as in 171-173).

(171) nawko –ko mother –CT ‘mother’

3.2.11 Action, Participant and Agent Nominalization

In Sabanê, action or participant nominalization is expressed through suffixation of –ta or –bi, respectively, to a verbal theme (root plus verbal suffix). Both nominalizations must be followed by the referential suffix, when used in isolation. The examples (174-175) illustrate action nominalization (ACNNR), whereas (176-(177) exemplify participant nominalization (PATNR).

(174) kan –i –ta to die –VS –ACNNR ‘the dead/the death’

–mi –REF

(175) kal –i to cut –VS ‘the cut’

–ta –ACNNR

–mi –REF

The suffix –bi forms a nominalization that refers to the participant of the nominalized verb (participant nominalization). Thus, the nominalized participant is the one who executes the action.

(176) kan –i to die –VS ‘the killer’

–bi – PATNR

–ta –ACNNR

–mi –REF

(177) kal –i to cut –VS ‘the cutter’

–bi – PATNR

–ta –ACNNR

–mi –REF

Nominalizations play a central role in subordinate clauses, as we will see in Chapter 4.

3.2.12 Comitative
The morpheme koka occurs between two subjects to express the notion of comitativity.

3.2.13 Locative

The locative notion is expressed by the morpheme –(i)na attached to the noun; this morpheme expresses meanings such as ‘to’ and ‘from’ or ‘this’.

Verb Morphology

3.3 Verb Morphology
3.3.1 Introduction
This section focuses on verb morphology. The verbal word is formed by possessive pronouns, the root, and verbal suffixes (for aspect, tense, and mood), as well as other suffixes, expressing semantic categories such as negative, suppositive, desiderative, reported speech, etc.

3.3.2 Verbal Root

The verbal word is formed by the verbal root, prefixed by object and reflexive pronouns and followed by a verbal suffix (VS), formative suffixes, a negative particle, and aspect-tense and mood suffixes. The root plus the verbal suffix form the verbal theme in Sabanê. The verbal suffix permits to identify the verbal root, because every root needs its verbal suffix.
The number of syllables in a root varies from one to three. The syllable structure of a root defines the form of the verbal suffix: if the syllable is open, the VS is represented by a consonant, if it is closed, it shows up as a vowel, as will be discussed in section 3.3.3 below.

(01) yalakanin may –i –dana

slowly

to walk –VS –PRES EV

‘S/he walks slowly.’

(02) uli wola kiki 2SUBJ a lot to scratch ‘You scratch it a lot.’

–n –datinan –VS –PRET EV

(03) towali –mi m– yotop –a 1SUBJ –REF 2OBJ– to know –VS ‘I know you.’

–dana –PRES EV

3.3.3 Verbal Theme
This verbal suffix is attached to roots, verbal adjectives, numerals and (some) adverbs. The verbal theme is composed by the root and the verbal suffix, which has three allomorphs –i/–a/–n. In a root that ends in a consonant the VS is –i,

Verb Morphology

129

phonetically [¤ ], before the suffix –al9 categorically. In a root that ends in vowel or glide, the VS is –n (or –ni/–na). Elsewhere, it appears as –i or –a, [ ]. This, however, is just a strong tendency, because, in some cases, the choice of –i or –n for the VS seems to escape the general rule:

(04)

[& ¤ ¥" #

¦

$

¤¡

]  ¡ ¢

isun

–i

‘Is s/he angry?’

–al –PRES NEUT

–a –INT

(05) wal –a –ap –al to win –VS –ITER –PRES NEUT ‘The wind blows (incessantly).’

–i –ASSR

¢

isun

–n

to be angry –VS

‘Is s/he angry?’

–al –PRES NEUT

–a –INT

In general, however, the variation is based on the generalizations stated above:

(07) towali d– wayulu palan

–i

1SUBJ 1POSS– dog to not have –VS

–al

–i

–PRES NEUT –ASSR

‘I have no dog.’

(08) ip –a –ntal

(09) yowla –mi ta– taw –i knife –REF 1OBJ– to cut –VS ‘I was cut by the knife.’

–dana –PRES EV

9 This happens to avoid the sequence [( ) 0 1 ], in which the verbal suffix would become invisible at the surface as a consequence of vowel merger.

130

(10) nawa a– kal –i –al beiju 3OBJ– to cut –VS –PRES NEUT ‘S/he cuts her/his own beiju.’

–i –ASSR

(11) ninu2 –k wola silu –n –dana liquid –OBJ much to taste –VS –PRES EV ‘The drink is salty.’ (context: by mistake, someone added salt instead of sugar to a drink.)

(12) ninu2 –k yalakanin liquid –OBJ slowly ‘He drank the juice slowly.’

inay –i to drink –VS

–datinan –PRET EV

(13) anolota –mi hala meat –REF to be rotten ‘The meat is rotten.’

–n –dana –VS –PRES NEUT

Unexpectedly, a verb ending in a glide receives a suffix –n:

(14) maysunon –k ilaw

male youngling –OBJ to be big

–al

–i

–PRES NEUT –ASSR

‘The boy is not big.’

–n –mina –VS –NEG

Each verb in a sequence of two is marked by the VS.

(15) ninu2 –k uni

–n silu –n –dana

liquid –OBJ to be delicious –VS to taste –VS –PRES EV

‘The juice is sweet.’

The verbal suffix can also act as a verb-forming suffix. It may be attached to adjectives, converting these into verbs. An adjective (or numeral) can act as a predicate. In fact, verbal adjectives can occur in both nominal and verbal structures. When they occur in verbal structures, they must be followed by a verbal suffix. When they occur in nominal structures, they undergo the usual nominal inflection. Thus, in (16), the root ayn ‘red’ is followed by a verbal suffix. In (17), the root ayn is part of a noun compound (notice that the meaning ‘(the) corn is red’ is not allowed for the structure given in (17)). Finally, in (18), there are two occurrences of ayn: one in the nominal domain and the other in the verbal domain.

The verbal suffix can be attached to adverbs or to numerals:

(19) ano

–i

much/many –VS

‘It is too much.’

–al –PRES NEUT

–i –ASSR

(20) ano

‘It is too little.’/ ‘Some’

yam –LINK– –CD: RND

–al

–i

–PRES NEUT –ASSR

‘There are two yams.’

bala –n DUAL –VS

When a verbal adjective is reduplicated to express intensity or emphasis,
only the root is copied. This also offers evidence for the productivity of the
verbal suffix, since, had it been opaque, we would expect it to be reduplicated together with the root10.

(22) da– towlanon

motu

–n –al

–i

1POSS– belly button to be round –VS –PRES NEUT –ASSR

‘My belly button is round.’

10 Partial reduplication is widespread in the world’s languages. However, in Sabanê, verbal reduplication always involves full reduplication.

3.3.4 Auxiliary Verbal Roots

Copular verbs do not exist in Sabanê as an independent category. The nominal predicative is built through concatenation of verb morphology with the noun. Therefore, in a sense, the verbal suffix acts as an auxiliary, in the absence of a verbal root.

3.3.5 Negation

Negation is marked by the particle –mi(si)na. This particle is suffixed to the verbal theme. Generally –mi(si)na is realized as –mina, even though its long form –misina occurs unpredictably. When added to a morpheme starting with a vowel, –mi(si)na loses its final vowel.

(27) t– am

–i –ASSR

(31) t– inan –a 1OBJ– to grow –VS ‘I do not grow.’

–misina –NEG

–dana –PRES EV

Evidence for the hypothesis that the form –mi(si)na ends in a vowel comes

from verbal forms followed by future tense or negative imperative suffixes, in

which the final vowel /a/ of –mi(si)na could not be independently motivated.

Moreover, the form misin– would be subject to elision of the coda consonant /3 /

(before a consonant) and further vowel nasalization, resulting in

*[… ] or *[… ], which never happens. 7

Although the canonical position of the negative particle is immediately after the VS, it can optionally occur after the progressive suffix –say, as shown in (4243). When the suffixes –mi(si)na and –say occur together, native speakers often switch their positions without further implications.

(42) amayl –i –mina –say –al to rain –VS –NEG –PROG –PRES NEUT ‘It is not raining.’

Imperative mood is expressed by the verbal theme only.

(45) taw –i to cut –VS ‘Cut!’

In the imperative mood, negation is obtained through suffixation of the negative particle to the verbal theme.

(46) taw –i –mina to cut –VS –NEG ‘Do not cut!’

(47) osa –n to give –VS ‘Give it!’

(48) osa –n –mina to give –VS –NEG ‘Do not give it!’

Verb Morphology

As far as negative imperative sentences are concerned, the difference between a polite request and a command is pragmatic, which is obtained through intonation adjustment (falling and rising, respectively).

(50) t–

osa –n –mina G

‘Do not give it to me!’(request)

(51) t–

osa –n –mina H

1OBJ– to give –VS –NEG

‘Do not give it to me!’ (command)

In Sabanê, besides the negative particle, there is a lexical negative verb palan ‘to not have’.

(52) towali kapila.mata –mi palan 1SUBJ bottle gourd.DIM–REF to not have ‘I do not have a small bottle gourd.’

–i –dana –VS –PRES EV

The verbal root palan ‘to not have’ contrasts with the verbal numeral root –kata ‘one’ in the following examples:

(53) Gabliel maysili palan Gabriel childrento not have ‘Gabriel has no children.’

–i –al

–VS –PRES NEUT –ASSR

(54) Edson maysunon

Edson male youngling

–al

–i

–PRES NEUT –ASSR

‘Edson has only one boy.’

amulu kata –n only one –VS

The negative particle –misina cannot be attached to the root palan ‘to not have’.
Finally, the way to answer a question negatively consists of constructing a complete sentence, with all the required elements. This means that an acceptable negative answer to a question like ‘Did you see it?’ is ‘I did not see it.’ Sentences formed by the negative particle alone are ungrammatical.

By definition –mi(si)na is a bound morpheme and cannot be realized as a free morpheme.

3.3.6 Aspect

There is no marked opposition between imperfective and perfective aspect. As far as aspect is concerned, only progressive and iterative morphemes were found in Sabanê.
The suffix –say expresses continuous activity or a continuous state. Use of this suffix implies continued activity in the present or at some point in the past.

3.3.7 Tense and Evidentiality

In Sabanê, tense and evidentiality must be morphologically marked for every statement. Tense includes information about when an event took place (past, present, or future) and evidentiality states the existence of a source of evidence for some given information. It also refers to whether there is evidence for a statement and specifies what type of evidence there is (Aikhenvald 2003). In Sabanê, evidentiality must be regarded as a grammatical category because it cannot be omitted from the sentence. Moreover, lexical means to specify the source of knowledge, cf. English I guess, they say, etc., are avoided in Sabanê. The grammatical meanings of tense and evidentiality are combined in single (cumulative) morphemes in Sabanê, as will be illustrated below.
Within the evidentiality system, Sabanê distinguishes between evidential and non-evidential events. This distinction is made in the tense system. One of the evidential categories is used when the speaker has reliable information to believe that an event happened, is happening, or will happen. The source of information can be sensory, i.e., visual, auditory, etc., although, in Sabanê, the specific type of sensory evidence is not expressed grammatically. Evidence for some statement can sometimes be inferred, a fact which is expressed in Sabanê with a specific suffix. The inferred evidentiality can be related only to preterit events and must have some result in the present.

Evidential events are opposed to non-evidential or neutral events. The latter have their own group of morphemes and are divided between neutral (nonevidentials) and inferred neutral. Different from inferred evidence which always presents the assertion as being true, when an inferred neutral morpheme is used, the speaker cannot resolutely confirm the event, but does not exclude the possibility that it has happened on the basis of some inferred evidence. Elicited data, because of their inherent unnatural status, are always marked as neutral, due to the fact that it is not possible to verify their trustworthiness. Neutral markers are associated with imagined, predictable, or non-factual event interpretations. Even in real speech situations, sentences may be marked as neutral. Tensed neutral-marked sentences must also express a mood morpheme, expression assertion, or interrogation. In evidential tenses, these categories may be lacking.

PRES –al

PRET –ntal

Both sentences (64-65) are in the future tense. However, in (64) the speaker is certain about the event (because there is sensory evidence, for example) expressed by the use of the morpheme –telon ‘FUT EV’. In (65), on the other hand, the speaker lacks any evidence for the assertion (perhaps because it is just a conceptual possibility) and specifies the form with a tense-neutral morpheme followed by an assertive suffix –tapanal–i ‘FUT NEUT–ASSR’.

(64) t– ilup –a –telon 1OBJ– to vomit–VS –FUT EV ‘I am going to vomit.’

(65) t– ilup –a 1OBJ– to vomit–VS ‘I will vomit.’

–tapanal –FUT NEUT

–i –ASSR

Tense/Evidentiality morphemes are, by definition, assertive and cannot be morphologically questioned, as far as their truth-value is concerned. Consequently, assertions containing such morphemes are considered facts as a consequence of the availability of sensory or inferential evidence. However, Tense/Neutral markers do not have the same implications. Thus, the assertive –i

140

and interrogative –a particles can only be attached to verbs that carry markers of the Tense/Neutral system of morphemes.

(66) {context: someone reports that a child cried throughout the night.

Another person, just arriving, asks if the child did indeed cry the whole

night. The former replies upset: ‘Are you deaf? I already mentioned it.’

(Meaning ‘I expressed this fact grammatically’).}

question:

–a

to cry –VS –PRET NEUT –INT

‘Did s/he cry?’

answer: nan –i –datinan to cry –VS –PRET EV ‘S/he cried (I saw/heard it).’

Likewise, the answer to the interrogative question ‘Did s/he cry?’ nan–i–ntal–a can be marked as evidential or neutral, depending on the source of evidence or the lack of it:

(67) answer 1: evidential tense nan –i –datinan to cry –VS –PRET EV ‘S/he cried.’

(68) answer 2: neutral tense nan –i –ntal to cry –VS –PRET NEUT ‘S/he cried.’

–i –ASSR

Apart from the systems layed out above and summarized in the tables (1314), Sabanê also has a hearsay morpheme –tiaka. Although, from a semantic point of view, it is part of the evidentiality system, this morpheme is attached directly to the verbal theme and may be combined with other evidentiality suffixes. This morpheme is used in case of reported evidence and usually it is regarded as neutral (non-evidential from a speaker’s point of view).

Verb Morphology

3.3.7.1 Tense
Every sentence, except those in the Imperative mood, must have a tense morpheme. There are three tenses: preterit, present and future. Tense morphemes occur after the verbal theme and other verbal suffixes.

3.3.7.1.1 Preterit

There are four morphologically marked preterit forms. This division is based on evidentiality (evidence and inferred evidence) and non-evidentiality (neutral and inferred neutral)11.
The preterit neutral tense is marked by the suffix –ntal ‘PRET NEUT’, followed by assertive –i or interrogative –a. This suffix involves neutrality
towards the veracity of the assessment.

(69) Manoel a– kan –n Manoel 3OBJ– to kill –VS ‘Manoel killed him.’

–ntal –PRET NEUT

–i –ASSR

(70) ilup –i –ntal to vomit–VS –PRET NEUT ‘S/he vomited.’

–i –ASSR

(71) ilup –i –say –ntal to vomit–VS –PROG –PRET NEUT ‘S/he was vomiting.’

–i –ASSR

(72) hay ay –i –ntal

–a

already to go –VS –PRET NEUT –INT

‘Did s/he already go?’

In (73), both sentences have preterit morphemes because there are two different subjects.

11 The neutral inferential is deduced by judgment, although without sensory evidence.

–i

to fell –VS –PRET NEUT –ASSR

‘I saw her/him pretending.’

(Lit. ‘I saw her/him, s/he pretended.’)

However, in a coordinate sentence with a single subject, the verbs in the past form will be concatenated and both will have the verbal suffix –n. Tense and mood suffixes, however, are attached to the end of the sentence to the last verb in the sentence. In (74), there are two pronoun types as a result of the structure of the verb. The first verb alisin ‘to jump’ requires a subject pronoun, while the second, iney ‘to fall’, requires an object pronoun.

(74) towali alisin –n t– iney –i

1SUBJ to jump –VS 1OBJ– to fall –VS

–ntal

–i

–PRET NEUT –ASSR

‘I jumped and fell.’

In case there are two sentences, one in the past tense and the other in the present tense, both have their own tense and mood morphemes.

(75) ip –i –ntal to see –VS –PRET NEUT tia –ni –al to speak–VS –PRES NEUT ‘S/he tells what s/he saw.’ (Lit. ‘S/he saw, s/he tells.’)

–i –ASSR –i –ASSR

The suffix –datinan expresses the evidential past ‘PRET EV’. When this suffix is used, the hearer assumes the factuality of the sentence because of the availability of sensory evidence on the part of the speaker. Assertive or interrogative particles cannot be attached to this suffix. In (76), for example, the speaker must have seen or heard the dog running, while in (77) the speaker states that he is sure about having given manioc to someone.

(76) wayulu –mi ip –i –datinan dog –REF to run –VS –PRET EV ‘The dog ran.’

143

(77) towali miakali a– osa –n 1SUBJ manioc 3OBJ– to give –VS ‘I gave her/him manioc.’

–datinan –PRET EV

A third past tense morpheme is –np, which expresses the preterit neutral inferential ‘PRET NEUT INF’. In this case, the speaker is not able to resolutely confirm the event, but s/he believes that it could have happened based on inference. This suffix stands in a paradigmatic relationship with –ntal. It must be followed by a mood suffix.

(78) m– yotop –i –np

–i

2OBJ– to know –VS –PRET NEUT INF –ASSR

‘(One infers that) you knew it.’

(79) m– yotop –i –np

–a

2OBJ– to know –VS –PRET NEUT INF –INT

‘Did you know it (it seems you did)?’

In example (80), Maria must be marked as an object; otherwise, it could be interpreted as a subject.

(80) ilitika

ip –I –np

yesterday

to see –VS –PRET NEUT INF

malia –ki

Maria –OBJ

‘(One infers that) s/he saw Maria yesterday.’

–i –ASSR

The fourth preterit morpheme is –tika, which expresses evidential and inferential past ‘PASS INF’, and which occurs when the speaker assumes the event as a fact, based on hearsay evidence. This evidential and inferential past is found only in sentences preceding evidential sentences.

(81) kieylali –k kan –n –tika peccary –OBJ to die –VS –PASS INF hala –n –dana to stink –VS –PRES EV ‘The peccary died; (because) it stinks.’

The opposition between recent past (today) and less recent past (yesterday and beyond) is expressed lexically, by using the adverbs ileypelu ‘today’ and ileytika ‘yesterday’.

–ntal –PRET NEUT

–i –ASSR

3.3.7.1.2 Present

There are two morphemes to refer to the present tense: –al present neutral ‘PRES NEUT’ and –dana present evidential ‘PRES EV’. The mood suffixes –i and –a can be attached to tense-neutral forms only.
The present tense neutral suffix involves neutrality towards the veracity of the assessment.

(86) ilul –i –say –al to eat –VS –PROG –PRES NEUT ‘S/he is eating.’

–i –ASSR

(87) towali yey –i 1SUBJ to stay –VS ‘I wait (here).’

–al –PRES NEUT

In contrast, the present tense evidential suffix –dana assumes factuality of the sentence and implies the availability of sensory evidence.

(91) towali ilul –i 1SUBJ to eat –VS ‘I eat.’

–dana –PRES EV

3.3.7.1.3 Future

Future tenses are expressed in two ways: by –tapanal, a neutral future and by –telon, an evidential future.
The suffix –tapanal ‘FUT NEUT’ is neutral towards the veracity of the assessment. It can be used in an elicited sentence or in any sentence not concerned with factuality.

(92) ilul –i –tapanal to eat –VS –FUT NEUT ‘S/he will eat.’

–i –ASSR

(93) towali apao –i 1SUBJ to wait –VS ‘I will wait.’

Verb Morphology

(94) amayl –i –tapanal to rain –VS –FUT NEUT ‘It will rain.’

The evidential future tense suffix –telon (FUT EV) can only be added to a sentence in which the speaker is certain about its factuality, based on first-hand evidence.

(95) amayl –i –telon to rain –VS –FUT EV ‘It is going to rain.’

(96) uli ay –i –mina –telon 2SUBJ to go –VS –NEG –FUT EV ‘You are not going anywhere.’

3.3.8 Mood and Modality
According to Frawley (1992: 388) ‘Modality is an epistemic version of deixis, with the values for the deictic points rewritten in terms of speakers’ state of belief and the relation between those points interpreted as degrees and likelihood of the actualization of a state of affairs’. In Sabanê, sentences can be assertive, interrogative, or imperative. Assertive and interrogative suffixes are attached to neutral tenses. Imperative is unmarked.

3.3.8.1 Assertive and Interrogative
The assertive –i and interrogative –a suffix can only be attached to neutral tense forms such as –np, –ntal, –al and –tapanal. The majority of the world’s languages do not morphologically express this opposition and in the few that do, the assertive is the category that remains unmarked. One could therefore ask the question why the assertive is phonologically marked in Sabanê. One reasonable guess is that this suffix is originally an epenthetic element introduced at the end of a sentence, because all neutral tense forms have a syllable closed by a consonant that is not allowed to occur in a coda in Sabanê. Therefore, the assertive suffix could be a morphologized epenthetic element in parallel to the interrogative suffix. Despite not being real modal marks, both assertive and interrogative suffixes will be treated under the heading Mood.

Verb Morphology

147

According to Payne 12 (1997:294), Tibetan is another language that expresses an opposition between assertion and interrogation by the use of two different suffixes, as is illustrated by the following examples:

(97) Tibetan:

yoqöö m m

II

II

s

P

P

–p Q

‘Did the servant eat dumplings?’

Both mood suffixes occupy the same syntactic slot and the use of one suffix excludes the use of the other, just like in Sabanê.
In Sabanê, the interrogative suffix –a occurs simultaneously with question words (who, whom, etc.) and cannot be replaced by intonation only.

(99) iney –i to fall –VS ‘S/he fell.’

–ntal –PRET NEUT

3.3.8.2 Imperatives and other Commands
In Sabanê, the imperative mood expresses orders and commands, whereas nonimperative mood is represented by assertive and interrogative sentences. The imperative has a second person singular and a second person plural form, other than, for example, the Northern Nambikwara languages Latundê and Lakondê, where the imperative only involves the second person singular13. In Sabanê, the canonical form of the imperative mood is the bare verbal theme (root plus verbal suffix). Sometimes, intonation plays a role to enhance the imperative character of a sentence. Thus, a falling intonation indicates a polite order, whereas a rising
12 Although Tibetan is not related to Sabanê, it shows that the system of Sabanê is not unique among the languages of the world. 13 See Telles (2002) for Latundê/Lakondê. See also Palmer (1986).

intonation indicates a coercive order. Stative verbs cannot occur in the imperative mood.

t– osa –n 1OBJ– to give –VS ‘Give it to me, please.’

(102)

tosan H t– osa –n 1OBJ– to give –VS ‘Give it to me, now!’

The second person imperative is phonologically unmarked, just like the third person of non-imperative moods.

Tense, evidentiality, and aspect categories are not expressed in the imperative mood. Nonetheless, six types of imperatives can be distinguished in Sabanê:

1. Weak imperative: bare verbal theme

The default imperative form is the weak imperative. Morphologically it is represented by the verbal theme. As mentioned above, intonational differences reflect different degrees of politeness.

(107) ilul –i to eat –VS ‘Eat!’

Although formed by the verbal theme, the weak imperative can receive prefixes, like the object pronoun t–:

(108)

tosan Y t– osa –n 1OBJ– to give –VS ‘Give it to me, please.’

150

Verb Morphology

2. Strong imperative: verbal theme + –n

The strong imperative (admonitory) usually implies some type of reproof or reproach. Its goal is to make the addressee fulfil an action that s/he is not willing to fulfil.

(109) ilul –i –n to eat –VS –ST IMP ‘Eat (it is an order)!’

The admonitory particle –n occurs only with the second person singular and plural (it excludes inclusive person).

(110) yey –i to stay –VS ‘Stay!’

–n –ST IMP

(111) pi– yey –i PL– to stay –VS ‘Stay!’ (plural)

–n –ST IMP

The admonitory suffix –n follows the negative suffix.

(112) ay –i to go –VS ‘Do not go!’

–mina –n –NEG –ST IMP

(113) pi– wawul –i –mina –n PL– to shout –VS –NEG –ST IMP ‘Do not shout, people!’

The hortative imperative is expressed through suffixation of –to to the (otherwise) verb-final element, which can be the verbal suffix or the negative suffix. There are two types of hortative imperatives: exclusive (plural and singular) and inclusive:

Verb Morphology

151

3. Hortative exclusive (the speaker is excluded): verbal theme + –to

(114) ilul –i –to to eat –VS –HORT ‘Eat!’ or ‘You (SG) can eat!’

4. Hortative exclusive plural (the speaker is excluded): pi–+ verbal theme + –to

(115) pi– ilul –i PL– to eat –VS ‘You (plural) eat!’

–to –HORT

5. Hortative inclusive: pi–+ verbal theme + –tinopi

The discontinuous particles pi–…–tinopi are used for the imperative inclusive plural, i.e., the first person is included along with the second person. The imperative inclusive plural suffix is –tinopi.

(116)

pi– taw PL– to cut ‘Let’s cut!’ *taw –i

–i –tinopi –VS –HORT INCL
–tinopi

The suffix –tinopi must occur with the plural prefix pi–.

(117)

pi– ilul PL– to eat ‘Let’s eat!’ *ilul –i

–i –tinopi –VS –HORT INCL
–tinopi

6. Prohibitive: the negative imperative prohibitive is formed by the postposition of –mi(si)na after the verbal suffix.

(118) taw –i to cut –VS ‘Do not cut!’

–misina –NEG

In the hortative and strong imperatives, the negative morpheme is also immediately after the verbal suffix:

152

Verb Morphology

(119) pi– amun –i –mina –tinopi PL– to sleep –VS –NEG –HORT EXCL ‘Do not fall asleep, people!’

PL– to eat –VS –NEG –HORT INCL

‘Let’s not eat, people!’

(121) ilul –i –mina –n to eat –VS –NEG –ST IMP ‘Do not eat (it is an order)!’

When two verbs in the imperative mood are concatenated, both keep their own inflexional categories.

3.3.9 Other Verbal Components
The following verbal components are affixed to the verbal theme or the negative particle (if it occurs): suppositive, quotative, desiderative, and reflexive. Tense and evidentiality suffixes are attached to those verbal components.

3.3.9.1 Imminentive

In Sabanê, the morpheme –tasa, located before the present tense suffix, expresses the fact that an action is about to happen, as shown in (127-128). On the other hand, as shown in (129-130), the same morpheme indicates that an action almost happened, but not quite. This morpheme is labelled as imminentive (IMIN).

Verb Morphology

3.3.9.2 Suppositive

The suffix –tun expresses the notion of supposition; that is, the speaker believes in the feasibility of the action, although there is no concrete evidence for it. For this reason, –tun occurs exclusively with neutral tenses.

(131) amayl –i –tun –tapanal to rain –VS –SUPP –FUT NEUT ‘It seems it will rain.’

‘It seems that the meat is cooking.’

–mina –tun –NEG –SUPP

3.3.9.3 Quotative/Hearsay

The suffix –tiaka (hearsay) indicates that the source of information comes from a quotation or other second-hand source. Usually, the source of this information is supplied and the use of evidential tenses reflects it.

(135) wayulupi.maysili

‘They said that the white-lipped peccary bit Lino.’

In a few cases, the suffix –tiaka is employed with neutral tenses as well. In these cases, the sentence cannot be confirmed as a fact, the source is not trustworthy, or the information is not feasible.

3.3.9.4 Desiderative Morphology: –tan and palisin

There are two morphemes frequently associated with the notion of desire. The morpheme –tan functions as a suffix and is attached to the verb:

(139) nawko uli ilul –i –tan –al

–a

mother 2SUBJ to eat –VS –DES –PRES NEUT –INT

‘Mother, do you want to eat?’

(140) towali ilul –i 1SUBJ to eat –VS ‘I want to eat’.

Weather or natural phenomena verbs like to rain, to thunder, to lighten, etc. do not have pronominal arguments. They are, just like regular roots, followed by verbal suffixes and tense-aspect-mood particles.

3.3.11 Verbal Adjectives
This section explores the status of verbal adjectives in Sabanê. I argue that verbal adjectives are verbs rather than nouns, and cannot be classified as an independent lexical class.
In the literature, the term adjective has been a source of controversy. Dixon (especially 1977 and 2003) claims that adjectives form a word class per se because they have a conceptual basis and prototypical grammatical functions. Schachter (1985), on the other hand, states that there are three different ways in which adjectives are classified in the world’s languages: (1) adjectives form an independent class (in parallel to nouns and verbs); (2) some concepts usually are expressed by adjectives and there is also a small group of nounlike or verblike adjectives; and (3) adjectives do not form a class per se and are a subclass of nouns or verbs. Wetzer (1992:231) reviews Schachter’s work and claims that, despite the fact that adjectives indeed share some properties with nouns and verbs, they have their own characteristics and they have properties not found in either nouns or verbs. Notwithstanding these theoretical viewpoints, the existence of an independent class of adjectives for a given language must be established on the basis of language-internal linguistic criteria.
Overall, the term adjective is prototypically associated with terms of dimension (small, big, short, etc.), age (young, old, etc.), human values (good, bad, etc.), and colour (white, black, etc.). Physical properties (hard, soft, etc.) and speed (fast, slow, etc.) are also often expressed by way of adjectives.

Verb Morphology

159

Nouns in Sabanê form the core of nominal phrases while verbs are the core of verbal phrases. Agentive and patientive suffixes cannot be attached to adjectives, unless they occur in a derived word as a nominal phrase (162) or nominalized word, as shown in (163).

(162) pan –n –ta white –VS –ACNNR ‘(colour) white’

–mi –REF

(163)

{panta –mi} uni white –REF to be good ‘S/he likes (the colour) white.’ *pan –k uni –n

–n –dana –VS –PRES EV
–dana

We have seen that nouns can receive possessive prefixes, as illustrated in (164a). The example in (164b) shows that adjectives may not be combined with such morphemes. On the other hand, when adjectives appear with nominal morphology, they take possessive prefixes, just like any other noun, as shown in (164c).

(164) (a)

d– apipa –mi 1POSS– hand –REF ‘my hand’

(b) *d– isun 1POSS– angry ‘my anger’

–mi –REF

(c) d– isun

–n –ta

1POSS– to be angry –VS –ACNNR

‘my anger’

–mi –REF

Therefore, adjectives do not behave like nouns in Sabanê. In the following sentences one sees that adjectives have the structure of intransitive verbs.

(165) Manoel

ilup

Manoel

to vomit

‘Manoel vomits.’

–i –al

–i

–VS –PRES NEUT –ASSR

160

Verb Morphology

(166) nawa

is

manioc dough to be hard

‘The dough is hard.’

–i

–al

–i

–VS –PRES NEUT –ASSR

In (165), the intransitive verb ilup ‘to vomit’ receives the verbal suffix, followed by the present tense neutral and the assertive particle. The subject is its only argument. The fact that both the verb and the adjective require a patientive argument makes the object mark –k optional (both sentences describe nonvolitional acts). However, adjectives in intransitive sentences can also demand agentive subjects, as in:

(167) towali ilaw 1SUBJ to be big ‘I am fat.’

–n –al

–i

–VS –PRES NEUT –ASSR

In (167), ilaw ‘to be big’ and by extension ‘to be fat’, requires an agentivelike argument because according to the Sabanê a person becomes fat by her/his own will.
Occasionally, adjectives only differ from verbs to the extent that one is agentive, the other patientive. In these cases, we assume the existence of two lexical entries, one for the verb and another for the (verbal)adjective, because the agentive status or patient status cannot be predicted.

(168) uli ip –i 2SUBJ to run –VS ‘S/he runs.’

–al –PRES NEUT

–i –ASSR

(169) m– ip 2OBJ– to be long ‘You are long.’

–i –al

–i

–VS –PRES NEUT –ASSR

The notion of control is crucial for distinguishing between the verb and the adjective in (168-169). The use of pronouns indicates that the verb ip ‘to run’ requires an agentive-like subject, while the adjective ip ‘to be long’ requires a patient-like subject (an object form). In (170), the same criteria affect the distinction between the verb and the adjective.

(170)

t– isayl

Adjectives rarely show lexical opposite pairs like big vs. small, good vs. bad. This is usually expressed by litotic constructions.

(171) t– ilaw 1OBJ– to be big ‘I am big.’

(176)

katal –i –mina –dana cook –VS –NEG –PRES EV ‘It is raw.’ (Lit.: ‘It does not cook.’)

Like verbs, verbal adjectives can be modifiers within the noun phrase, but, in order to fulfil this function, they must be nominalized with the attributive suffix –ta:

162

Verb Morphology

(177) NP[N[wayulu] N[N[V[kan]ita]] dead dog

hala –n to stink –VS

angry white man

–OBJ a lot to be angry –VS

–al

–i

–PRES NEUT –ASSR

‘The {angry white man} is furious.’

In (177-179), nouns are modified by the nominalized verbal adjective. The morphological operation [[NOUN] + [ADJ]] has the same structure as [[NOUN] + [VERB]] (cf. 177). Examples (180-181) exemplify the same construction:

(180) kiata ayn (–n) –ta corn red (–VS) –ACNNR ‘red corn’ (a species)

–akata –CL: LONG

–mi –REF

(181) kiata pan (–n) –ta corn white (–VS) –ACNNR ‘white corn’ (a species)

–akata –CL: LONG

–mi –REF

The examples in (180-181) show adjective-like terms in noun constructions. The occurences in (182-184) give simple nouns followed by a predicative sentence as well as predicative sentences with nominalized verbal adjectives. Thus, the noun phrase kiatapantakatami ‘corn white’ is formally different from kiatapantakata paniali ‘the white corn is white’ as far as verbal adjective use is concerned.

Verb Morphology

163

(182) {kiata} {–takata} corn –CL: LONG ‘The corn is white.’

–i –ASSR

A verbal adjective has the potential to be the nucleus of a verbal domain as well as a modifier (within the nominal domain), just like an ordinary verb. This means that verbs and verbal adjectives share the same properties.
The only difference between verbs and verbal adjectives is related to the reduplication processes. Verb reduplication makes the action repetitive while verbal adjective reduplication intensifies the qualities expressed by the verbal adjective.

Sabanê has other means to express intensification in verbs, such as the use of the adverb wola (187), or the use of the aspectual morpheme –ap (188).

(187) Manoel

wola

Manoel

‘Manoel slept for hours and hours.’

Nominal predicative constructions have the same structure as verbal predicative constructions. Verbal adjectives are nominalized separately in each construction and both items are marked with the patientive suffix.

(189)

oto pan –n –ta

‘The arrow is black and white.’

–akata –CL: LONG –k –i –OBJ –VS

–ka –OBJ

The similarity between nominal predicative constructions and verbal predicative constructions is due to the lack of an overt copular verb. Therefore, both readings are possible in (190).

(190) a)

kanin

Verb Morphology

165

Notice that in (191a) the subject ulikapali ‘boss’ carries the object marker –k, and in (191b), a predicative sentence, the subject katatalii ‘white man’ has the same marker.

(191) a)

‘The white man is tall.’

Therefore, based on structural resemblance, I claim that adjectives are verblike in Sabanê and that they do not form an independent class. The studies published about the Nambikwara languages generally regard adjectives as part of the verbal class as well, being described as statives, descriptives, or verbal adjectives.

4 Syntax

4.1 Introduction

This chapter explores some aspects of the syntax of Sabanê.

4.2 Personal Pronouns

Subject personal pronouns are obligatory in the absence of a nominal subject. There are, in Sabanê, two classes of personal pronouns. On the one hand, there is the class of subject pronouns, which are free morphemes except for pi– ‘1pl’. On the other hand, there is a class of object pronouns, which are bound morphemes.
Usually, subject pronouns occur in the first position of a sentence (SOV). The subject pronouns are given in table (17). As shown, the singular vs. plural distinction is only available in the first person category.

Table 17: Personal Pronouns Subject

1SUBJ

towali

1SUBJ PL

pi–

2SUBJ

uli

3SUBJ

–

The first person singular pronoun has the free form towali. Typically, this pronoun precedes the object, although its position may change because of topicalization or focus.

(01) towali ilul –i

–mina –tapanal

1SUBJ to eat –VS –NEG –FUT NEUT

‘I will not eat.’

–i –ASSR

(02) towali wayulu –k ip –a –datinan 1SUBJ dog –OBJ to see –VS –PRET EV ‘I saw the dog.’

(03) uni

‘I am not beautiful.’

–i

towali

–ASSR 1SUBJ

Syntax

168

The use of the first person pronoun is not the only way to express first person subjecthood in Sabanê. Sometimes, a possessive pronoun construction replaces the first person pronoun. For example, the respective subjects of the sentences in (04-05) are ‘my bowl’ and ‘my arrow’.

(04) d– anose –tanon

1POSS– bowl –CL:HEMI

–al

–i

–PRES NEUT

–ASSR

‘I have only one bowl.’

amulu –n only –VS

(05) d– oto –takata

1POSS– arrow –CL: LONG

–al

–i

–PRES NEUT

–ASSR

‘I have two arrows.’

bala –n DUAL –VS

Both pronouns, subject and possessive, can occur together:

(06) towali d– wayulu palan

–i

1SUBJ 1POSS– dog not to have

–VS

–al

–i

–PRES NEUT

–ASSR

‘I don’t have any dog.’

The second person subject pronoun is the free form uli, which behaves the same way as its first person counterpart.

(07) uli wolata

wawal –i

–dana

2SUBJ a lot more

to shout –VS –PRES EV

‘You shout excessively.’

(08) uli ay –i 2SUBJ to go –VS ‘Do you go?’

–al –PRES NEUT

(10) uli ulikapali 2SUBJ boss ‘Are you the boss?’

–k –i –OBJ –VS

The pronoun uli also expresses the second person plural. The context will resolve any ambiguity.

The pronoun pi– expresses the first person plural (inclusive or exclusive) in the non-imperative mood. In the imperative mood, pi– expresses the same notion, but then it needs two discontinuous complements (cf. section 3.3.8.2).

Nonetheless, pi– is the only bound morpheme that acts as a subject pronoun. However, it can also function as the object pronoun, which fact makes it unique among the Sabanê pronouns.

4.3 Agentive/Patientive Typology
Before considering argument and verb relations in Sabanê, let us briefly discuss the notions of ‘government’ and ‘transitivity’. One of the aspects of syntactic organization concerns the lexical properties of words that determine the kind of relations they establish as well as certain aspects of the syntactic structure in which they may appear. Thus, verbs can require certain arguments to be

Syntax

172

expressed in a sentence. Traditionally, it is assumed that a verb is transitive, when it requires the presence of a direct object, such as the verb yow to make.

(32) uli matowla

–k yow –a –datinan

2SUBJ pestle

–OBJ to make –VS –PRET EV

‘You made the pestle.’

In turn, an intransitive verb like kan ‘to die’ does not require any object complement. Intransitive verbs are said to be monovalent, which means they have the subject as their only argument.

(33) kan –n –al to die –VS –PRES NEUT ‘S/he dies.’

–i –ASSR

However, these definitions are not fully adequate as far as verbs like to eat are concerned, which can be used with either one or two arguments. As a result, to eat can be transitive or intransitive. Such verbs have two valencies and can lose one of their arguments (the internal one). Sabanê has verbs which can be transitive verbs (34), descriptive/stative verbs (35), and both transitive or intransitive (36).

In Sabanê, patient-like elements of transitive sentences (37) and subjects of predicative sentences (38) receive the same suffix –k.

The literature (Mithun 1991:511, and references there) refers to sentence structures like those mentioned above as active, stative-active, agentive or agent-patientive1. Dixon (1979) refers to such constructions as split S. Another well-known label is split intransitivity (Merlan 1985, Van Valin 1990, apud Mithun 1991).
Agentivity can be expressed in three different ways: a) with an intrinsically agentive (subject) pronoun; b) by the referential suffix –mi; and c) without any mark.

‘The dog saw me.’

–datinan –datinan –PRET EV

In (41), the patient is marked by the particle –k, while the subject (agent) is marked by a personal (agent) pronoun uli.
The verb kal ‘to cut’ is transitive. Therefore, it requires two arguments: one agent, and one patient. The sentence in (41) is constructed with reversed arguments in (42): the agent of (41) is the patient of (42) and vice versa.

(42) Gabliel ma– kal –i

‘Gabriel is cutting you.’

As was already shown, the third person pronoun is expressed as a– preceding a verb root that starts with a consonant, and as zero elsewhere.

Likewise, intransitive clauses receive agentive markers, which can be expressed by agentive pronouns or be left unmarked.

‘I left.’

‘Gabriel left.’

When the object argument is overtly marked, e.g., with an object pronoun or with the patient marker –k, agent-like arguments can be optionally unmarked. However, in transitive sentences, it is usual to find double marking. In intransitive clauses, however, marking is essential to distinguish between analogous verb forms and is therefore obligatory.

Some verbs, like ilul ‘to eat’, can be either transitive or intransitive:

175

Syntax

(50) hay deypa ilul –a already snake to eat –VS ‘The snake already ate.’

–ntal –PRET NEUT

–i –ASSR

In (50), ilul ‘to eat’ is intransitive, and therefore deypa ‘snake’ is agent. Moreover, the semantics of the verb requires an agent-like subject because ilul is a volitional verb and therefore an agent must control the action. In (51), on the other hand, the marking of the arguments is essential to categorize the subject and the object. While kali ‘horned frog’ is overtly marked, it is not necessary to mark the subject deypa ‘snake’. Although the basic word order is SOV, in (51) the object is dislocated to the first position.

In (52), deypa ‘snake’ is marked as an object and therefore undergoes the action undertaken by the agent koketa ‘harpy eagle’. In (53), the agent is deypa ‘snake’.

In sentences (54) and (55), the verb osa ‘to give’ requires three arguments, a subject (the giver), an object (the given thing), and an indirect object (to whom the thing is given). The location of indirect object position varies in the sentence, without affecting its meaning: in (54) it occupies the final position, while in (55) it is placed immediately before the verb.

In case a subject is expressed by a full noun (56-57), the object is marked by –k. The agent role in these sentences must be animate, which makes clear which element is the subject.

Predicative sentences are those which modify or extend the predicate of a sentence. The verbal adjective sentences describe a non-volitional property or a built-in attribute of the subject. Subjects are patient-like in verbal adjective

177

sentences. Therefore, such verbal structures demand a patient marker, i.e., a patient personal pronoun or a –k marked lexical item.

To conclude, Sabanê has a system in which a patientive (P) argument of a sentence with multiple arguments and the argument of a predicative sentence are marked by an object-patientive particle –k, while a nominal argument of a oneargument sentence (subject - S) or sentences with intrinsically agentive pronouns are not overtly marked. This happens when a lexical pronoun or a patient-like argument is overtly marked with –k.

Split Intransitivity (Payne 1997)

Therefore, in the terminology of Payne (1997), Sabanê has a system of Split Intransitivity. Payne (1997: 144) states ‘The most common split intransitive systems express some S arguments in the same way as transitive A arguments and others in the same way as transitive P arguments’. In the Sabanê system, S arguments of certain intransitive verbs (in which S is patient) are expressed

Syntax

178

(marked by –k) in the same way as P arguments of transitive sentences (in which S is an agent), while A arguments as well as S arguments of a transitive sentence are unmarked.
Mithun (1991: 512) claims that ‘Such case systems can be the products of successive developments over time, each individually motivated in one way or another. To explain why they show the patterns they do, we must understand not only their static forms but also the dynamic processes that shape them.’ However, the following description is limited to the Sabanê data as it is nowadays. Further research could shed light on the historical development of this system.
In the pronominal system of Sabanê there is an opposition between subject/agent and object/patient pronouns; that is, some pronouns are inherently ‘subject’ while others are intrinsically ‘object’. The only exception is the plural pronoun pi–, which can be either subject or object.
The subject/agent pronouns are used with volitional verbs, whereas object/patient pronouns occur with non-volitional verbs. The notion ‘volitional’ is not universal, because it varies from language to language. The pair ‘to eat’/‘to vomit’, for example, exemplifies this opposition. The ‘eating’ act as expressed by ilul, is a controlled action in Sabanê, and therefore it requires an agentive pronoun (63). The verb ilul ‘to eat’ is used transitively in (63) and intransitively in (64).

(64) towali kiata –k ilul –i

–datinan

1SUBJ corn –OBJ to eat –VS –PRET EV

‘I ate corn.’

The act of ‘vomiting’, expressed by the verbal root ilup, in turn, expresses a non-volitional action. Therefore, it requires a patientive pronoun.

(65) t–

ilup –i

–dana

juice –OBJ 1OBJ– to vomit –VS –PRES EV

‘I vomited the juice.’

*ninu’ka towali ilupidana

In (63) and (65), a volitional action sentence with a patientive pronoun and a non-volitional action with an agentive pronoun are judged to be ungrammatical by the Sabanê speakers. Even in a situation in which the use of the verb ilup can be interpreted as volitional, for example when someone puts a finger down his throat in order to provoke vomiting, the Sabanê still refuse to use an agentive pronoun. The only accepted meaning for the sentence towali ilupidana in (65) is ‘I pretend that I am vomiting’.
Table 18 presents the system of agentive and patientive pronouns.

The first person agentive pronoun is towali. The first person patientive pronoun is realized as t– before vowels and glides, and as ta– before consonants. This variation suggests that the basic form is /¡ ¢ –/ and that the vowel is elided before vowels and glides.

In some cases the choice of an agentive or a patientive marker is responsible for the difference between a permanent state/characteristic and a temporary state, as for example, the state of being beautiful (non-volitional) and the controlled action of becoming beautiful (by dressing up).

Therefore, the Sabanê verbal system is divided into two groups: one which requires agentive arguments and another which requires patientive arguments.
Colloquial Guarani (Gregores & Suárez 1967) and Lakohta (Mithun 1991) have similar systems. In Guarani, there are two first person singular pronouns: a) the pronoun a represents an agentive argument in transitive verbs and in some intransitive sentences; and b) the pronoun še represents a patientive argument in transitive and some intransitive sentences.

(80) a–xá

‘I go.’

a–gwerú a£ na ‘I am bringing them now.’

šé–ras£

‘I am sick.’

šé–rerahá ‘It will carry me off.’

The choice of the pronoun in intransitive sentences is based on a semantic distinction regarding stativeness or activeness. Lakohta has a similar system, although verbal prefix pronouns make distinctions between the two types of case. The prefix wa–, for example, denotes agentiveness in transitive sentences while the prefix ma– occurs as patient. Many verbs denoting actions require wa–, whereas many verbs denoting states demand ma–. However, some stative verbs also occur with wa–:

(81) wathi ináwaxme

‘I came.’ ‘I am hiding.’

In addition, verbs denoting events occur with ma–:

(82) mat’é mah¤íxpaye

‘I fainted, died.’ ‘I fell.’

Overall, the Lakohta system can be described as an agentive-patientive system because agentive actions (to dwell, to hide, etc.) require agentive pronouns and undergoer actions (to faint, to fall, etc.) require patient pronouns. Both systems help us to understand the Sabanê system.

4.4 Word Order
In Sabanê, the basic word order of transitive sentences is SOV (SUBJECT-OBJECTVERB) while in intransitive sentences the default order is SV (SUBJECT-VERB). SP (SUBJECT-PATIENTIVE) and OP (OBJECT-PATIENTIVE) are expressed by nouns

183

Syntax

overtly marked by –k and lexically patientive pronouns, whilst SA (SUBJECTAGENTIVE) and SP are either unmarked or expressed by agentive pronouns.
There are three syntactically distinct sentences types: intransitive, transitive, and stative.

4.4.1 Intransitive Sentences

Intransitive sentences have only one argument: SUBJECT-AGENT (SA). In these sentences, the basic word order is SV. Adverbs are optional. In (83), the verb kan ‘to die’ is intransitive and therefore requires only one argument.

(83) João kan –n João to die –VS ‘João died.’

–ntal –PRET NEUT

–i –ASSR

In (84), there is an adverb in the sentence, although its position is not fixed. The most common position is after the subject.

(84) Gabliel ikameyna

ay –i

–telon

Gabriel tomorrow

to go –VS FUT EV

‘Gabriel is going out tomorrow.’

or: ikameyna Gabliel ayitelon

or: Gabliel ayitelon ikameyna

4.4.2 Transitive Sentences
Transitive sentences have two obligatory arguments, one of which behaves like SA and the other like SP. In (85), the transitive verb ip ‘to see’ requires two arguments: an agentive pronoun and an object that is marked by –k.
(85) towali wayulu –k ip –a –datinan 1SUBJ dog –OBJ to see –VS –PRET EV ‘I saw a dog.’
Objects in transitive sentences, if expressed by a noun, must be marked with the particle –k (86). If the object is expressed by a pronoun, this pronoun must be patientive (87):

Syntax

(87) yowla –mi ta– taw –i

–dana

knife –REF 1OBJ– to cut –VS –PRES EV

‘A knife cut me.’

The subject and the object in a transitive sentence may be unmarked in two circumstances: a) a subject is unmarked when it is a proper noun and the object is marked by –k (80); b) the object is optionally unmarked when the sentence contains an inherently patientive pronoun); or (89) the agent is expressed by a proper noun in a non-ambiguous pragmatic context.

(88) Josi manala –k hop Josi sieve –OBJ to weave ‘Josi made a sieve.’

–a datinan –VS –PRET EV

(89) uli matowla 2SUBJ pestle ‘You made a pestle.’

–k yow –a –OBJ to make –VS

–datinan –PRET EV

Nominal agents are not marked with a suffix. Optionally, the referential suffix occurs to set the limits of the noun domain.

(90) Manoel

–mi ilakan –i

–dana

Manoel

‘Manoel works.’

Manoel

ilakan –i

Manoel

to work –VS

‘Manoel works.’

–dana –PRES EV

In the default order, objects precede the verbal phrase. Movement of the object to the end of the sentence is possible but rare.

(91) uli kal –i

–say –dana

2SUBJ to cut –VS –PROG –PRES EV

‘You are cutting Gabriel.’

gabliel –ka Gabriel –OBJ

185

In elicited data, objects sometimes occur in the first position, although this happens only rarely.

(92) kali

–ka deypa ilul –a

horned frog –OBJ snake to eat –VS

–ntal

–i

–PRET NEUT –ASSR

‘A snake ate a frog.’

In complex transitive sentences, one of the arguments can be omitted. In (93), the subject argument towali occurs in the first sentence and is omitted in the second one.

(93) towali d– yaya isi kal –i

1SUBJ 1POSS– brother hair to cut –VS

a– san –n –ntal

–i

3OBJ– to catch –VS –PRET NEUT –ASSR

‘I (caught and) cut my brother’s hair.’

Furthermore, the third person singular object pronoun argument is morphologically expressed if it precedes a consonant, as shown in the example (94), a–sa, or it is not morphologically expressed if it precedes a vowel as in –ip.

(94) (a–) ip –a –ntal (3OBJ–) to see –VS –PRET NEUT a– sa –n –ntal –i 3OBJ– to catch –VS –PRET NEUT ‘S/he saw it and caught it.’ (Lit. ‘S/hei saw it, s/hei caught it.’)

–i –ASSR
–ASSR

The third person singular patientive pronoun can also be omitted, in which case it is also identified on the basis of the pragmatic context.

4.4.3 Transitive and Intransitive Sentences

(98) Manoel Ivone –ka Gabliel.kiliwa –ka tia –na Manoel Ivone –OBJ Gabriel.house –OBJ to speak –VS –datinan –PRET EV ‘Manoel spoke to Ivone about Gabriel’s house.’

4.4.4 Stative Sentences

Sentences with verbal adjectives, weather verbs, adverbs and numerals in a verbal function and auxiliary verbal roots form the group of stative sentences. In this group, the predicative or the patient-like argument is marked by the particle –k.

(99) Lino maysunon

–k –i

–mina –dana

Lino male youngling

–OBJ –VS –NEG –PRES EV

‘Lino is not a child (anymore).’

(100) ulikapali

–k –i

boss

–OBJ –VS

‘S/he is (acts like) the boss.’

–al –PRES NEUT

–i –ASSR

(101) ulikapali

–k –i

boss

–OBJ –VS

‘S/he wasn’t the boss.’

–mina –ntal –NEG –PRET NEUT

–i –ASSR

187

Syntax

Aspect, tense, and mood particles are attached to the verbal suffix when there is no verbal root. In these cases, the verbal suffix acts as an auxiliary verbal root.

4.4.5 Verbal Adjectives

Verbal adjectives describe some characteristic or property of an argument. Aspect, tense, and mood particles are attached to the verbal suffix, which itself is connected to the verbal adjective. The argument commonly presents a patientive marker.

(102) ela –ko motu moon –OBJ to be round ‘The moon is round.’

–n –al –VS –PRES NEUT

–i –ASSR

(103) tapawulu.isi –ki siki

clay star

–OBJ to be sharp pointed

‘A clay star has sharp points.’

–n –dana –VS –PRES EV

(104) da– takipa

1POSS– marmoset

–OBJ to be good

–VS

–al

–i

–PRES NEUT

–ASSR

‘My marmoset is lovely.’

Adverbs in verbal functions also receive verb-like affixation. They can have two arguments.

(105) ano

–n –mina –al

much/many –VS –NEG –PRES NEUT

‘There is little.’/ ‘There is some.’

(106)

iwnua –k ano

Syntax

(107)

bala –n –al DUAL –VS –PRES NEUT ‘There are two.’

Weather verbs do not have overt arguments.

(108) amayl –i to rain –VS ‘It rains.’

–al –PRES NEUT

–i –ASSR

(109) tolun

‘It is thundering (constantly).’

–i –ASSR

(110) milut

–i

to lighten

–VS

‘There is lightening.’

–al –PRES NEUT

–i –ASSR

4.4.6 Existential Constructions

Existential constructions express ownership on the part of the subject. In Sabanê, nominal constructions are used to express ownership in the present tense. These constructions are formed by concatenating the referential suffix to a (possessed) noun. Although the sequences (111-114) lack aspect, tense, and mood suffixes, they are interpreted as regular present tense sentences.

(111) da– kiliwa –mali 1POSS– house –REF ‘This is my house.’

(112) a– yata –mali 3POSS– wife –REF ‘This is his wife.’

(113) Manoel

kiliwa –mali

Manoel

house –REF

‘Manoel has a house.’

189

Syntax

(114) d– yata wayulu –mali 1POSS– wife dog –REF ‘My wife has a dog.’

The same construction can have aspect, tense, and mood suffixes when it expresses a past tense existential phrase. However, in these cases it resembles an auxiliary verbal root sentence.

(115) d– yata wayulu –mi 1POSS– wife dog –REF ‘My wife had a dog.’

–ntal –PRET NEUT

–i –ASSR

4.4.7 Serial Verbs

When an identical agent/subject is involved in two actions in coordinated sentences, the verbs can be concatenated in which case only the last one receives all verbal suffixes. This is shown in (116).

(116) Manoel

alisin –n

Manoel

to jump –VS

‘Manoel ran and jumped.’

ip –i to run –VS

–datinan –PRET EV

In (117), each verb has its own argument and therefore they are not strictly serial.

(117) towali alisin –n t– iney –i

1SUBJ to jump –VS 1OBJ– to fall –VS

–ntal

–i

–PRET NEUT –ASSR

‘I jumped and fell.’

4.5 Coordinate Clauses
Coordinated clauses can be divided into additive and adversative clauses. 4.5.1 Additive Clauses
Additive clauses have only one tense/aspect/mood component attached to the last verb, if both verbs express the same tense and if they have the same

Syntax

190

arguments. For example, in (118), the verbs, ilul, and iney are both related to the argument towali.

(118) towali wola ilul –i 1SUBJ a lot to eat –VS ‘I eat and drink a lot.’

iney –i to drink –VS

–dana –PRES EV

However, if tense or arguments are distinct, each sentence has its own TAM structure. In this case, sentences are just concatenated. There is no coordinating morpheme like ‘and’.

(119)

hay Manoel

ay –i

–datinan

already Manoel

to go –VS –PRET EV

ileypelu

towali ay –i

–telon

now

1SUBJ to go –VS –FUT EV

‘Manoel is already gone and I am leaving now.’

4.5.2 Adversative Clauses

Two concatenated adversative sentences have a tense/aspect/mood component each, even though, as in (120), their tense (dana) and subject (towali) are the same.

(120)

towali ilul –i

–dana

1SUBJ to eat –VS –PRES EV

–mina –dana

–NEG –PRES EV

‘I ate but I didn’t drink.’

towali iney –i 1SUBJ to drink –VS

Adversativeness is expressed by concatenation of positive and negative sentences.

(121)

t– hamo –n –mina –tan –ntal

1OBJ– to push –VS –NEG –DES –PRET NEUT

2SUBJ ghost –OBJ to see –VS –PASS INF

a– tia –n –mina –datinan

3OBJ– to speak –VS –NEG –PRET EV

‘You saw a ghost but you didn’t tell her/him.’

4.6 Comparative Clauses

In order to compare properties or states of affair, Sabanê does not use any lexical comparative items or derivational suffixes. Comparative clauses are usually formed through the juxtaposition of simple sentences, one of which is affirmative and the other negative.

(123)

Gabriel

–k isayl

Gabriel

–OBJ to be heavy

Manoel –k isayl

–i

Manoel –OBJ to be heavy –VS

‘Gabriel is heavier than Manoel.’

(Lit. Gabriel is heavy, Manoel isn’t.’)

–i

–dana

–VS –PRES EV

–mina –dana

–NEG –PRES EV

(124)

towali ip –a –ntal 1SUBJ to run –VS –PRET NEUT uli ip –a –mina –ntal 2SUBJ to run –VS –NEG –PRET NEUT ‘I run harder than you.’ (Lit. ‘I run, you didn’t.’)

–i –ASSR –i –ASSR

(125)

wayulu kanin

–n –dana

dog to be big

–VS –PRES EV

wayulupi

kanin

–n –mina –dana

cat

to be big

–VS –NEG –PRES EV

‘Dogs are bigger than cats.’

(Lit. ‘Dogs are big, cats aren’t.’)

Absolute comparison is obtained by the juxtaposition of two similar affirmative (positive) sentences. One of the sentences must have an adverb in order to sanction it as the ‘winning’ sentence in the comparison.

Syntax

192

(126)

Josi wola ilul –i

–dana

Josi a lot to eat –VS –PRES EV

Lino ilul –i

–dana

Lino to eat –VS –PRES EV

‘Josi eats more than Lino.’

(Lit. ‘Josi eats a lot, Lino eats.’)

4.7 Subordinate Clauses

4.7.1 Relative Clauses

Subordinate clauses have the same constituent order as simple or coordinated clauses, since verbal suffixes appear in the same position. Subordinate clauses may be subordinated to a noun or to a nominalized verb. The sentence in (127) is relativized to the nominalized form kan–i–ta–mi to die–VS–ACNNR–REF ‘dead body’.

(127)

kan.i.ta.mi {m– ip

–i

–datinan}

dead (body) 2OBJ– to see –VS –PRET EV

m– yaya –mi –datinan

2POSS– brother –REF –PRET EV

‘The corpse {that you have seen} is your brother’s.’

Objects can also be relativized, as shown in (128):

(128)

miakali

–ka {hala.n.ta.mi} t–

manioc

–OBJ putrid

1OBJ–

–datinan

–PRET EV

‘I vomited the manioc {which was putrid}.’

ilup –a to vomit –VS

Headless sentences can be formed by nominalization.

(129) hilikan –n –bi –ta –mi to play –VS –PATNR –ACNNR –REF ‘Player/The one who plays.’

193

Syntax

4.7.2 Temporal Clauses

Sabanê forms a temporal subordinate clause through prefixation of the morpheme nat– ‘when/while’ to the subordinate clause:

(130)

nat– –i– t– inan –n –tapanal

TEMP– –LINK– 1OBJ– to grow –VS –FUT NEUT

towali ulikapali

–n telon

1SUBJ boss

–VS –FUT EV

‘I am going to be the leader, when I grow older.’

–i –ASSR

Commonly, subordinate clauses precede main clauses, although this is not obligatory. In the following example, a temporal subordinate clause follows the main clause.

(131)

towali kwina yey –i

–misina –datinan

1SUBJ quiet to stay –VS –NEG –PRET EV

nat– ul

yey –i

–tika

TEMP– LOC to stay –VS –PASS INF

‘I would not calm down while she was there.’

towali amun –i

–misina –datinan

1SUBJ to sleep –VS –NEG –PRET EV

nat– ul

yey –i

–tika

TEMP– LOC to stay –VS –PASS INF

‘While she was there, I would not sleep.’

4.7.3 Temporal Consecutive Clauses

The conjunction kayl(a)– ‘after’ converts a sentence into a temporal consecutive subordinate clause ‘CONS’ in which it is prefixed to the verb that carries the tense/aspect/mood suffix. In (132) there is only one TAM group of particles because the argument and tense categories are the same.

(132) towali –mi ilul –i

kayl– amu –n

1SUBJ –REF to eat –VS CONS– to sleep –VS

‘I am going to eat, and after that sleep.’

telon –FUT EV

Syntax

194

In case of different tenses or agents, the prefix kayl(a)– occurs between the clauses. In (133-134) there are two TAM groups of particles because the argument and tense category are different.

(133)

Ivone kila –k hipiw

–i

–say

Ivone macaw –OBJ to pluck the feathers of –VS –PROG

–dana

kayla– kalit –i

–telon

–PRES EV

CONS– to cook –VS –FUT EV

‘Ivone is plucking the macaw’s feathers and then she is going to cook

it.’

(134)

Manoel

doda

–ka kan –n

Manoel

white-lipped peccary –OBJ to kill –VS

–tika

kayla– kiliwa –ka sa –n –datinan

–PASS INF

CONS– house –OBJ to catch –VS –PRET EV

‘Manoel killed a white-lipped peccary and afterwards took it home.’

4.7.4 Concessive Clauses

The conjunction to– ‘CONC–’ is used to express the meaning ‘although/in spite of/nevertheless’. The concessive subordinate clause usually opposes two sentences.

(135)

amayl –i –say –dana

to rain –VS –PROG –PRES EV

to– towali ay –i

dana

CONC– 1SUBJ to go –VS –PRES NEUT

‘Despite the fact that it is raining, I go.’

The prefix to– also occurs in sentences with different tense suffixes:

(136)

t– hamo –n –mina –tan –tika 1OBJ– to push –VS –NEG –DES –PASS INF to– t– hamo –n –datinan CONC– 1OBJ– to push –VS –PRET EV ‘Although s/he didn’t want to push me, s/he did.’

5 Adverbs
5.1 Introduction
Adverbs are divided into two classes in Sabanê. The first class has real adverbs that behave like independent prosodic words, while the second is formed by adverbs that are used only in verbal function.

5.2 Free Adverbs

The first class of adverbs includes free morphemes, which express adverbial notions like mood and time (01). Adverb types like wola and sukwin, which will be described separately below, have positional restrictions, and are therefore not free morphemes in a broader sense.

(01) hinama hay holiapa hiaka iley ileyhilon ileypelu ileytika ikameyna tamay tuni yalakanin

‘suddenly’ already’ ‘far’ ‘near’ ‘early’ ‘tomorrow morning’ ‘now’, ‘today’ yesterday’ tomorrow’ ‘over’ ‘inside’ slowly’

sukwin wola

‘little’ ‘a lot’

Adverbs of this type can occupy any position in the sentence, i.e., possible orders vary from ADV-S-O-V (basic), S-ADV-O-V, S-O-ADV-V to S-O-V-ADV. These adverbs differ either morphologically or syntactically from nouns and verbs. Compared to nouns, adverbs do not require a referential suffix nor do they allow attachment of any nominal affix, like pronouns or classifiers. Adverbs of this type cannot be used as arguments. They do not allow attachment of any verbal suffix.

196

Adverbs

Adverbs in this class are independent prosodic words, that is, they have their own primary stress, and their boundaries are preserved at word edges. Below I will present adverbs from this class individually.
The morpheme hinama ‘suddenly’ expresses an unforeseen action:

(04) towali hinama

hamo –n –datinan

1SUBJ suddenly

to push –VS –PRET EV

‘I pushed her/him/it suddenly.’

Adverbs

The word ileypelu ‘today/now’ expresses an action at the present time or at a time that is very near:

(16) ileypelu

The free adverb tamay ‘over’ expresses the fact that something or someone is at a position above or higher than the referent.

(26) daliwulu

tamay m– anasi yey –i

Adverbs

The adverb tuni ‘inside’ expresses the notion of an inner or interior part of something.

(30) tuni uli amun –a –ntal

(31) towali tuni amun –a –mina –datinan 1SUBJ inside to sleep –VS –NEG –PRET EV ‘No, I did not sleep inside (the house).’

The free morpheme yalakanin expresses the notion of slowness:

(32) yalakanin

¡
ninu –k

inay –i

–datinan

slowly

juice –OBJ to drink –VS –PRET EV

The morpheme sukwin ‘little’ is also a free adverb.

(35) sukwin amayl –i

–datinan

little to rain –VS –PRET EV

‘It rained a little.’

Adverbs

201

Nonetheless, sukwin is a suffix component in nominal compounds as well. In these cases, sukwin shares certain properties with the diminutive suffix –mata. However, differently than –mata, classifiers are usually attached to sukwin.

¡

¡

(38) kolu kolu

(a pair of) scissors

‘small scissors’

sukwin –takata little –CL: LONG

–mi –REF

(39) apiawa

sukwin –tiawa

wooden bark little –CL: BARK

‘small wooden bark’

–mi –REF

Therefore, sukwin is an adverb as well as a noun suffix, depending on its position and function.
The free morpheme wola ‘a lot’ shares most of its characteristics with the other adverbs of this class: it is an independent prosodic word and its boundaries are preserved in contact with other boundaries. However, it receives the nominal augmentative suffix –ta. The resulting form wolata is an emphatic version of wola. The particles wola and wolata reject any other nominal suffix, such as the referential suffix.

(40) wola amayl –i a lot to rain –VS ‘It rains a lot.’

–al –PRES NEUT

–i –ASSR

(41) wolata

amayl –i

–al

to rain –VS –PRES NEUT

‘It is raining very hard.’

Furthermore, wola and wolata normally occur in pre-verbal position and dislocation from that position results in ungrammaticality.

(42) towali wola ayp –i

‘I dug a lot.’

Adverbs

In a sentence, adverbs of this type can be freely dislocated, except wola and

wolata. This indicates that wola is structurally bound to the verbal domain.

¢£

¤ ¥¦ §

However, primary stress is assigned to the morpheme wola [ ]

independently, which indicates that it forms a word domain. Furthermore, the

final vowel in wola is stable, i.e., it is not elided in any circumstance. Additionally, all verbal affixes1 (in a verbal domain) are stressless. Therefore,

wola cannot be regarded as part of the verbal domain.

5.3 Bound Adverbs

The second class of adverbs generally includes bound morphemes. Most of these are adverbs in verbal function, i.e., they are root-like forms, e.g., ano, amulu, bala, and kata. One morpheme, the negative particle –misina, is a suffix attached to the verbal theme. The common properties of this class of adverbs are that each of them has special characteristics that make it impossible to classify them as either a free adverb or a verb.

(43) ano amulu bala kata

much’/’many’ only’
DUAL
‘one’ (singulative)

–misina, –mina NEG

Bound adverbs do not share the same morphological and syntactic characteristics with verbal roots. For example, bound pronouns cannot be attached to adverbs like ano ‘much/many’.

(44) ano

–i

–al

much/many –VS –PRES NEUT

naysunun

–ka

land

–OBJ

‘There is plenty of land.’

–i –ASSR

1 Except preterit neutral tense –ntal (cf. section 2.5).

Adverbs

–i

naysunun

–ka

–ASSR land

–OBJ

*‘I have a huge (piece of) land.’

The adverb ano–n–mina ‘few’ is formed through negation of ano ‘much/many’. Litotic constructions like this are common in Sabanê.

(46) ano

–n –mina –al

much/many –VS –NEG –PRES NEUT

‘There are few.’/ ‘There are some.’

–i –ASSR

(47) iwnua –k ano

star –OBJ much/many

–al

–i

–PRES NEUT

–ASSR

‘There are few stars.’

–n –mina –VS –NEG

The morpheme amulu can be either a verbal adverb (44) or an adverb (4546). In its verbal function, amulu behaves like ano, whereas in its adverb function, amulu behaves like wola. This means that amulu is neither a full verbal root, nor a free adverb.

(48) amulu –n –al only –VS –PRES NEUT ‘There is only one!’

–i –ASSR

(49) amulu t– ilup –a –ntal

–i

only 1OBJ– to vomit–VS –PRET NEUT –ASSR

‘I was the only one who vomited.’

(Context: some people ate spoiled food, many got sick, but I was the

only one who vomited.)

(50) da– maysunon amulu kata –n

1POSS– youngling male only one –VS

–al

–i

–PRES NEUT

–ASSR

‘I have only one (child) boy.’

204

Adverbs

Finally, the morpheme bala ‘DUAL’ is related to or indicates two people or things. It has the same structural features as ano (cf. section 3.1.5).

(51) bala –n –al DUAL –VS –PRES NEUT ‘It is two.’

–i –ASSR

Apart from free and bound adverbs, root reduplication also has an adverbial effect. In this case, root reduplication implies intensity.

(52) d– oto –k siki

–n

1POSS– arrow –OBJ to be sharp pointed –VS

–al

–i

–PRES NEUT

‘My arrow has a very sharp point.’

(54) tapulisi –ko motu stone –OBJ to be round ‘The stone is round.’

6 Interrogatives
6.1 Introduction
The Sabanê language has two major morphosyntactic strategies to form an interrogative utterance. The first strategy is by using an interrogative suffix –a, as already described in the section 3.3.8.1 and briefly summarized below. The second way is by employing question word particles. The interrogative suffix occurs simultaneously with a question word particle. Therefore, in this study, an interrogative word is any question word element or an interrogative suffix.
Besides, there are other minor strategies to express interrogativeness, such as by tense and evidentiality suffixes and intonation. As far as the tense and evidentiality system is concerned, the interrogative suffix can be attached only to neutral sentences; hence, evidential tenses are inherently affirmative and prohibit (morphosyntatically) any attempt to inquire into the factuality of the state of affairs.

6.2 Interrogative Suffix

The interrogative suffix –a ‘INT’ is added to sentences with neutral tense morphemes as –np, –ntal, –al and –tapanal. This suffix is the counterpart of the assertive suffix –i ‘ASSR’: both occupy the same position and they rule each other out. Example (01) expresses this opposition:

(01) iney –i to fall –VS ‘S/he fell.’

–ntal –PRET NEUT

–i –ASSR

iney –i –ntal

–a

to fall –VS –PRET NEUT –INT

‘Did s/he fall?’

*ineyntali + intonation

Semantically and morphologically, only neutral tense sentences allow the interrogative suffix. In (02-05), this is exemplified with each one of these morphemes:

206

Interrogatives

(02) nan –i

–ntal

–a

to cry –VS –PRET NEUT –INT

‘Did s/he cry?’

(03) nan –i

–np

–a

to cry –VS –PRET NEUT INF –INT

‘Did s/he cry?’

(04) nan –i –al

–a

to cry –VS –PRES NEUT –INT

‘Does s/he cry?’

(05) nan –i –tapanal

–a

to cry –VS –FUT NEUT

–INT

‘Will s/he cry?’

Evidential tenses involving –datinan, –tika, –dana and –telon do not allow assertive or interrogative affixation. Evidential sentences rule out the possibility of questioning their inherent truthfulness value. As shown in (06), the interrogative suffix cannot be attached to an evidential sentence.

(06) *nanidatinana

*nan –i –datinan

–a

to cry –VS –PRET EV

–INT

‘Did s/he cry?’

Intonation is an integral part of the interrogative suffix, because phrasal stress must be assigned to the interrogative suffix in these sentences. This results in a rising sentence-final pitch. However, the duration of this element cannot be measured because final syllables can be naturally lengthened and this environment is difficult to control in experiments.
Interrogative sentences have two types of answers. These sentences necessarily are neutral tense-marked; however, depending on which evidentiality source is available to the speaker, the answer can involve neutral or evidential tense. Therefore, the question in (07) uli ayisayala ‘Are you leaving?’ has two possible answers: a neutral one (08) or an evidential one (09).

(07) uli ay –i

–say –al

–a

2SUBJ to go –VS –PROG –PRES NEUT –INT

‘Are you leaving?’

Interrogatives

207

Possible answers:

(08) towali ay –i 1SUBJ to go –VS ‘Yes, I am leaving.’

–al –PRES NEUT

–i –ASSR

(09) towali ay –i

–dana

1SUBJ to go –VS –PRES EV

‘Yes, I am leaving.’

In many languages, interrogative sentences may require or accept a yes/no answer. In Sabanê, however, every answer must involve all sentence-obligatory elements. The negative morpheme is a bound morpheme and there is no free negative morpheme. On the other hand, the speakers make use of a ‘positive’ morpheme in two situations: the morpheme hay1 ‘already’ or the acquiescence ideophone hum-hum is employed as ‘yes’. A positive answer is possible although highly marked.

(10) uli ay –i

–say –al

–a

2SUBJ to go –VS –PROG –PRES NEUT –INT

‘Are you leaving?’

(11) *Mina ‘No.’

(12) ?Hay or ‘Yes.’

?Hum-hum. ‘Yes.’

¡¢
An abrupt gasp, such as eh, phonetically transcribed as [ ], followed by a rising intonation is the way to signal that the speaker is waiting for an acquiescence answer.

(13) uli ay –i

–say –al

2SUBJ to go –VS –PROG –PRES NEUT

‘Are you leaving?’

Expected answer: ‘yes’.

–i

–eh?

–ASSR –TAG

1 Lowe (1999: 284) reports that, in Kithãulhu, the interjection hai3yo2-1 means ‘Right!, OK!’. This is similar to the Sabane interjection hay.

208

Interrogatives

Another type of validation sentence (in which the hearer must confirm or deny a statement) is expressed by the tag question particle –eh following the interrogative suffix –a. In this case, the tag question is more negative-like.

(14) uli ay –i

–say –al

2SUBJ to go –VS –PROG –PRES NEUT

‘You are leaving, aren’t you?’

–a –eh? –INT –TAG

In general, tag questions require complete sentences, although positive answers are common as well.

6.3 Question Words
Question word particles indicate which piece of information is being requested from the hearer or mark a sentence as interrogative. Table 20 presents the question word particles of Sabanê.
Table 20: Question words animate atel– ‘who’/’whose’ neutre ate– ‘what’/‘who’/‘whose’ neutre ates– ‘what’ reason kate– ‘why’ mood/time nat– ‘how’/ ‘when’ place pays– ‘where’ place pay– ‘where to/from’ generic tia– ‘which’ time tiay– ‘when’
In Sabanê, the first function is expressed by actual question words while the second function is expressed by the interrogative suffix. Even though in many languages these particles are classified as adverbs or pronouns, I will not assume this position here. Nevertheless, these particles do not share characteristics either with adverbs or with pronouns.
The animate vs. neutre opposition holds for the particle atel– ‘who’, which usually refers to beings, things or objects, and to ate– ‘who’, ates– ‘what’, which refer to human beings or animals (animate).

Prosodically, question word particles belong to their host’s domain, i.e., they are not regarded as prosodic domains themselves. Adverbs in sentences with question word particles are usually dislocated to the end of the sentence.

When a question word particle ends in a consonant and the following word starts with a consonant, a linking vowel [i] appears (28). When the next morpheme starts with a vowel or a glide, and the question word particle ends in a vowel, its final vowel is elided (29).

‘Why is the machete dirty?’

For Latundê, Telles (2002: 340) points out that the interrogative marker ã– is part of every question word particle. In Sabanê, a similar suffix –a occurs at the end of every interrogative sentence, either in the presence of a question word or alone. Therefore, one might suggest that every question word in Sabanê has the same marker as in Latundê; in the latter, this occurs sentence-finally, and in the former, it occurs sentence-initially.

7 Conclusion
The Nambikwara linguistic family is classified as isolated. This means that with our current state of knowledge, it is not possible to provide convincing evidence for establishing some linguistic affiliation with other linguistic families or groups. From this perspective, by enlarging our knowledge of the Nambikwara languages, we broaden our chances of discovering a relationship between this language group and other languages of South America, between the Nambikwara people and other peoples that populate the American continent, and we increase our understanding about the history of the population of the Americas. This Grammar of Sabanê pretends to contribute to these fields of knowledge. It also hopes to make a useful contribution to the study of linguistic typology in general and to the internal classification of the languages that belong to the Nambikwara family in particular.
The Grammar of Sabanê is the first linguistic study that deals exclusively with Sabanê. Beyond our purely linguistic theory oriented purposes, we have tried to help the Sabanê community in two different ways. Most important was the preparations of a document by which we have been able to defend before the Fundação Nacional do Índio, FUNAI (a Federal Agency for Protection of the Indigenous Populations). This document enables us to defend the right of the Sabanê people to return to their traditional lands. Moreover, the foundation of a settlement whose ethnic majority is Sabanê has encouraged the Sabanê’s interest for revitalizing their traditional language and culture. In line with this fact, an educational project was started, which aims to develop materials to enable the Sabanê to teach the language to their children, who had become monolingual in Portuguese. Therefore, this Grammar of Sabanê has not only developed our understanding of the structure of the language, but it has also permitted that the language, the use of which had become victim of dispraise and prejudice both on the part of the non-Indians and of the surrounding Indian groups, regain its prestige within and outside of the community.
The phonological system of Sabanê possesses a series of five oral vowels, which occur phonetically nasalized before an underlying nasal consonant. Within the Nambikwara family, this system is atypical, because other languages of the group have complex vowel series that include oral, nasal, glottalized, and long vowels at the phonological level. Sabanê has eleven consonants / ¡ ¢ £ ¤ ¥ ¦ § ¨ ©  /, in which respect it finds itself completely in line with the other languages of the family. A phonological tone contrast is normally considered a common characteristic of the Nambikwara languages. We have here defended the position that pitch rises in Sabanê are predictable and

214

Conclusion

consequently not part of the underlying linguistic structure. A diachronic study could reveal the origin of some of the phonological discrepancies of the Sabanê language as compared to the other Nambikwara languages. Among these are the rise (or loss) of the tonal opposition.
Whereas the Nambikwara languages that are already described show a polysynthetic morphology, Sabanê is an agglutinating language. Furthermore, Sabanê nominal roots have normally two or more syllables, whereas the same units are overwhelmingly monosyllabic in the other languages of the family.
On the level of morpho-syntax, Sabanê possesses almost the same set of verbal affixes as the other languages, at least from the point of view of their meaning, although the phonological form and their position in the verbal domain are different. Lexically, the number of cognate words equals about 50% of the vocabulary. Additionally, the resemblance between Sabanê and the other Nambikwara languages is most evident when considered from the perspective of Proto-Language reconstruction (see Costa & Wetzels, in preparation).
Questions relating to the possible influence of Portuguese in all areas of the grammar are awaiting further research. The question of the mobility of the adverbs in the sentence deserves a detailed investigation, which fact, in turn necessitates an in-depth study of pragmatics. The interaction between interrogative particles and adverbs also needs a more elaborate study. As far as the syntax in concerned, future studies should penetrate into the relation between volitional and non-volitional verbs, as well as into the roles of patient and agent in general. Complex sentences were not fully explored in this study. As for the discourse, more attention should be given to recording and analyzing spontaneous speech. On the basis of what was achieved already in this study, we hope to be able to contribute to the discussion of all of these features in future work.

Samenvatting (Summary in Dutch)
Dit proefschrift biedt een taalkundige beschrijving van het Sabanê, een taal die behoort tot de Nambikwara-familie. De Sabanê wonen verdeeld over twee dorpen in de zuidelijke regio van het Braziliaanse Amazonebekken, in de staten Rondônia en Mato Grosso. Terwijl ongeveer 140 personen zich beschouwen als etnische Sabanê, spreken er slechts drie het Sabanê als moedertaal, alle drie ouder dan zestig jaar. De taal wordt niet meer in het sociale verkeer gebruikt en is daarom ernstig met uitsterven bedreigd.
Het eerste hoofdstuk schetst in het kort de geschiedenis van het volk in de 20ste eeuw, waarbij gebruik is gemaakt van officiële documenten en van overgeleverde getuigenissen van de Sabanê zelf. De taal van de Sabanê is nooit eerder beschreven. Het beschikbare taalkundige materiaal bestond uit een lijst van 56 woorden, over het algemeen verwantschapstermen, verzameld door LéviStrauss (1948), en een woordenlijst van ongeveer 180 termen samengesteld door Price (1978). Lévi-Strauss stelt zich de vraag betreffende de genetische verwantschap van het Sabanê, omdat hij observeert dat de Sabanê niet kunnen communiceren met de andere (Noord-Nambikwara) groepen in de regio, die zich onderling wel verstaanbaar maken. Price gebruikt zijn woordenlijst eveneens met een comparatief doel. Hij stelt vast dat ongeveer 50% van de woorden in zijn verzameling, wat hun klank betreft, verwant zijn met woorden met dezelfde betekenis in twee Nambikwara-talen, één Zuid-Nambikwara taal en één Noord-Nambikwara taal, en ziet daarin voldoende bewijs voor de genetische verwantschap van het Sabanê met de Nambikwara-familie. De in ons onderzoek vastgestelde overeenkomsten op het gebied van de morfologie en de syntaxis tussen het Sabanê en een aantal andere Nambikwaratalen bevestigen de hypothese van Price.
Het tweede hoofdstuk geeft een overzicht van de fonetiek en de fonologie. Het fonologische systeem van het Sabanê onderscheidt 5 klinkers / ¡ ¢ £ ¤ / en 11 medeklinkers /¥ ¦ § ¨ ©       /. In vergelijking met de andere Nambikwaratalen valt het klinkersysteem van het Sabanê op door zijn eenvoud. Terwijl de meeste Nambikwaratalen een fonologisch onderscheid maken tussen orale, nasale en geglottaliseerde klinkers neemt het Sabanê genoegen met het ongemarkeerde vijfklinker systeem. Wat het medeklinkersysteem betreft lijkt het Sabanê sterk op de andere Nambikwaratalen, afgezien van de twee implosieve medeklinkers /¨ © /, die elders niet (meer) systematisch voorkomen. Het Sabanê heeft een voorkeur voor open lettergrepen. Gesloten lettergrepen die zijn toegestaan eindigen op de sonorante klanken [j w] and /n/ of op de glottale occlusief / /. Ongeaccentueerde lettergrepen zijn over het algemeen licht (CV), terwijl geaccentueerde lettergrepen meestal zwaar zijn, hetzij onderliggend (CVC), hetzij afgeleid (CVV). Anders dan de overige talen van de Nambikwara-familie

Samenvatting

heeft het Sabanê geen distinctieve toon. Het woordaccent is voorspelbaar: in zelfstandige naamwoorden valt het accent op de zware lettergreep van de nominale wortel en bij afwezigheid van een zware lettergreep wordt de laatste (meest rechtse) lettergreep van de wortel geaccentueerd. In werkwoorden valt het accent op de zware lettergreep in de verbale wortel. Waar een zware lettergreep niet voorhanden is, draagt de voorlaatste lettergreep (tellend vanaf rechts) het woordaccent. In alle gevallen is het secondaire accent voorspelbaar vanaf het hoofdaccent, waarbij van rechts naar links linkshoofdige binaire voeten worden gevormd.
Hoofdstuk 3 geeft een overzicht van de nominale en verbale morfologie. Wanneer het zelfstandig naamwoord in isolatie wordt uitgesproken is het referentiële suffix –mi (of –mali) verplicht. Hetzelfde fenomeen treffen wij aan in de zustertalen. In het Sararé, Zuid-Nambikwara, is er een referentieel suffix –su/–sa (Borella, in voorbereiding), terwijl in het Latundê, Noord-Nambikwara, het referentiële suffix –te wordt gebruikt (Telles, 2002). Als het zelfstandige naamwoord voorkomt in zinsverband is –m(al)i optioneel aanwezig, behalve wanneer het suffix van de patiëntieve casus –k wordt gebruikt, waarmee –m(al)i nooit mag combineren.
Geslacht en getal worden niet morfologisch gemarkeerd. De bezittelijke voornaamwoorden worden geprefigeerd. Alle andere aan het zelfstandig naamwoord gebonden morfemen treden op in de vorm van suffixen. De taal beschikt over een diminutief en een augmentatief suffix. Samenstellingen worden productief afgeleid, waarbij de constructie nomen+nomen de meest gangbare is. Het Sabanê heeft bovendien suffixen die de zelfstandige naamwoorden indelen in klassen naargelang de vorm of de consistentie van het concept waarnaar zij verwijzen. Hoewel deze classificeerders optioneel zijn, worden zij veelvuldig gebruikt. Niet zelden vervangt de classificeerder het zelfstandige naamwoord in uitingen waarin het substantief met zijn classificeerder al eerder is vermeld.
Ook het werkwoord staat slechts één klasse van prefixen toe. In dit geval zijn het de persoonlijke voornaamwoorden met een patiëntieve functie. Evenals de andere Nambikwaratalen, heeft het Sabanê een groot aantal verbale suffixen. Elke verbale wortel moet voorzien zijn van tenminste één suffix. Het tempussysteem en het evidentialiteitssysteem zijn zeer belangrijk in het Sabanê. Alle zinnen moeten zijn voorzien van hetzij een evidentialiteitssuffix hetzij een neutraal suffix. Neutrale zinnen mogen een assertief of interrogatief partikel bevatten. Wanneer een zin met een van de evidentialiteitssuffixen is gemarkeerd bezit deze een intrinsieke feitelijkheid en kan niet in de vragende vorm worden gesteld.
Verder komen in hoofdstuk drie de verschillende werkwoordstypen aan bod, worden de partikels besproken die typisch bij werkwoorden voorkomen, en wordt bijzondere aandacht geschonken aan de imperatiefconstructie.

De syntaxis wordt beschreven in hoofdstuk 4. Een fundamenteel kenmerk van de syntaxis van het Sabanê betreft het onderscheid tussen agentieve en patiëntieve werkwoorden. Inderdaad hangt de keuze van het agentieve of patiëntieve pronomen af van de aard van het werkwoord. Zo krijgen werkwoorden die een controleerbare actie uitdrukken, zoals het werkwoord voor ‘eten’, een agentief pronomen, of blijven ongemarkeerd, wanneer het onderwerp wordt uitgedrukt door middel van een zelfstandig naamwoord. Wanneer de actie uitgedrukt in het werkwoord niet controleerbaar is, zoals in het woord voor ‘braken’, bevat de zin een patiëntief objectspronomen, of, indien het object wordt uitgedrukt door middel van een zelfstandig naamwoord, dan wordt dit laatste altijd gemarkeerd met het suffix –k. De basisvolgorde van de constituenten is subject-object-werkwoord (SOW).
In hoofdstuk 5 worden de bijwoorden behandeld. Sabanê kent twee klassen van adverbia. Vrije adverbia zijn morfemen die in willekeurig welke positie in de zin kunnen voorkomen. Gedonden adverbia zijn morfemen die deel uitmaken van het werkwoordsdomein.
In hoofdstuk 6 worden de vraagwoorden besproken, waarvan het Sabanê twee soorten kent. Er is een modaal vraagpartikel en een groep van vraagwoorden. Het eerste kan voorkomen zonder de laatste, maar de laatste komen niet voor zonder het eerste: wanneer een zin een vraagwoord bevat eindigt deze verplicht op het interrogatieve partikel –a.
Het laatste hoofdstuk bevat een aantal conclusies en geeft onderwerpen aan die nader onderzoek verdienen.

Summary
This dissertation offers a linguistic description of the Sabanê language, which belongs to the Nambikwara linguistic family. The Sabanê live divided over two villages in the southern region of the Brazilian Amazon, in the states of Rondônia and Mato Grosso. While around 140 people regard themselves as ethnic Sabanê, only three speak the language as their mother tongue, all of whom are over sixty years old. The language is no longer used in the society, and is therefore severely threatened by extinction.
The first chapter briefly describes the history of the people in the 20th century, on the basis of official documentation and oral reports of the Sabanê themselves. The Sabanê language has never been described before. The linguistic material that is available consists of a list of 56 words, mostly kinship terms, gathered by Lévi-Strauss (1948), and a word list of around 180 words collected by Price (1978). Lévi-Strauss was concerned with the question of the genetic affiliation of the Sabanê language, because he observed that the Sabanê could not communicate with the other (northern Nambikwara) groups of people in the same region, whose languages were mutually intelligible to each other. Price also used his data for a comparative purpose. He determined that around 50 per cent of the words in his list were, as far as their sounds were concerned, related to words with the same meaning in one southern and one northern Nambikwara language, and regarded this as sufficient evidence to establish a genetic relation of Sabanê with the Nambikwara family. The morphological and syntactic similarities between Sabanê and a number of other Nambikwara languages that were uncovered in our research project confirm Price’s hypothesis.
The second chapter gives an overview of the phonetics and phonology of Sabanê. The phonological system distinguishes 5 vowels / ¡ ¢ £ ¤ / and 11 consonants /¥ ¦ § ¨ ©       /. Compared with other Nambikwara languages the vowel system of Sabanê is relatively simple. While most Nambikwara languages make a phonological distinction between oral, nasal and glottalized vowels, Sabanê just uses an unmarked five-vowel system. As far as the consonantal system is concerned, Sabanê resembles the other Nambikwara languages more strongly, apart from the two implosives / ¨ © /, which do not (or no longer) occur in the other languages. Sabanê prefers open syllables. Closed syllables are only permitted if they end in the sonorants [j w] and /n/, or the glottal stop / /. Unstressed syllables are usually light (CV), while stressed syllables are mostly heavy, sometimes underlyingly (CVC) and sometimes as a result of a rule (CVV). Different from the other languages of the family, Sabanê

Summary

does not make use of distinctive tone contrasts. Word stress is predictable: in nouns the stress appears on the heavy syllable in the root; if there is no heavy syllable, the final (i.e. rightmost) syllable of the root is stressed. In verbs, the stress is attracted by a heavy syllable in the verbal root. If there is no heavy syllable, the penultimate (i.e. the one but last) syllable will receive primary accent. In all cases rhythmic stress is assigned on the basis of the position of primary stress, building binary left-headed feet from right to left.
Chapter 3 presents an overview of nominal and verbal morphology. When a noun is produced in isolation, the referential suffix –mi (or –mali) is obligatory. The same phenomenon is found in the related languages. In Sararé, which is a southern Nambikwara language, there is a referential suffix –su/–sa (Borella, in preparation), while in Latundê, northern Nambikwara, the referential suffix –te is used (Telles, 2002). If the noun is used within a sentence, –m(al)i is optional, except when the patientive suffix –k occurs, with which –m(al)i can never be combined.
Gender and number are not morphologically marked. The possessive pronouns take the form of prefixes. All other morphemes that can be attached to the noun are suffixes: there is a diminutive as well as an augmentative suffix. Compounding is a productive process, in which NOUN+NOUN compounding is most usual. Sabanê also has suffixes that classify nouns according to the shape or the consistency of the concept to which they refer. Although these classifiers are optional, they are frequently used. The classifier often replaces the noun in discourse in which the noun with the classifier has already been used.
For the verb, too, there is only one class of prefix; in this case, these are the personal pronouns with a patientive function. Just like the other Nambikwara languages, Sabanê has a large number of verbal suffixes. Every verbal root must take at least one such suffix. The temporal system and the evidential system are of paramount importance in Sabanê. Every sentence must take either an evidentiality suffix or a neutral suffix. If a sentence is marked with one of the evidentiality suffixes, it has an intrinsic factuality and cannot be used to form a question. Finally in chapter 3, different verb forms are discussed, as well as the particles that tend to co-occur with verbs, and special attention is devoted to the imperative construction.
The syntax of Sabanê is described in chapter 4. A fundamental characteristic is the distinction between agentive and patientive verbs, which determines the choice of the (agentive or patientive) pronoun. Verbs that express an action that can be controlled, such as the verb for to eat, take an agentive pronoun, or remain unmarked when the subject is expressed by a nominal group. When the action that is expressed by the verb cannot be controlled, as in the verb for to vomit, the sentence contains a patientive object pronoun; if the object is

Summary

227

expressed by a noun, this is always marked by the suffix –k. The basic constituent order is subject-object-verb (SOV).
Chapter 5 deals with the adverbs. Sabanê has two classes of adverbs, the first of which contains free morphemes which can occupy any position in the sentence. The second class contains bound morphemes which are part of the verbal domain.
Chapter 6 is concerned with question words, which are also divided into two categories: there is a modal question particle and a group of question words. The former can occur without the latter, but the latter cannot occur without the former: if a sentence contains a question word, it obligatorily ends with the interrogative particle –a.
The final chapter draws a number of conclusions and gives a number of issues that deserve further research.
