Preface
is book presents ‘grammatical sketes’ created by young Japanese descriptive linguists. Ea contributor describes the phonological and grammatical outline of the language whi they have been working on, mainly by using the primary data researed by them.
is book aims to not only provide a general outline, but also present the typological or cross-linguistic aracteristics of the studied languages. For this purpose, we considered two principles with regard to the manner of description, namely, (1) to use general linguistic terms instead of traditional, speciﬁc terms of ea language and area, and (2) to share a table of contents for reference. However, these principles led to some problems. If we use general terms instead of speciﬁc terms, the description of the grammar may be incomplete. is is because many linguists have wrien the grammar that is adapted to the grammatical/functional structures of ea language by using speciﬁc terms. If we share the table of contents, we might include an ‘unnecessary’ point, e.g. suﬃxation of isolative languages.
On the other hand, if ea of us uses speciﬁc terms based on the traditional descriptions, it would be very diﬃcult to emphasize the contrast among the structures of diﬀerent languages. Furthermore, the use of ‘unnecessary’ description points enables us to visually capture the relative aracteristics of ea language. erefore, we decided to follow these principles and discussed how to dra the table of contents.
We, along with young descriptive linguists based in Japan have attempted to describe the grammars of various languages worldwide on the basis of these principles since 2005. We published two volumes of grammatical sketes in Japanese on 2006 (including the sketes of Bende, Sakha (Yakut), Upper Sorbian, Irabu Ryukyuan, nDrapa, Kolyma Yukaghir, Alutor, Jino, and Shinekhen Buryat) and 2007 (including the sketes of Tutuba, Kadorih (Dohoi), Cusco eua, Amdo Tibetan, Sibe (colloquial Manu), Siberian Yupik, Nootka, Khamnigan Mongol, and Parauk Wa). Most of the contributors in those volumes were graduate sool students. is was a very helpful opportunity for su young researers to acquire training in writing ‘holistic’ grammar, because we aimed to focus on hitherto narrowly deﬁned topics for our dissertations in graduate

sool. However, by overviewing the languages studied in this project, we could ﬁnd extremely signiﬁcant aracteristics or problems of ea language in our analyses. is project also motivated us to conduct indepth resear on the languages aer the two related volumes. By conducting further ﬁeldwork in the three years that passed since 2007, we sensed that we should re-write our sketes to make them more comprehensive. Fortunately, we were supported by the Linguistics Dynamics Science Resear Project (ILCAA, TUFS), and we ﬁnally decided to re-write in English.
Lastly, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to all of our language consultants for their expertise on the studied languages. As the editor of this book, I am also indebted to the contributors, all of whom are prominent descriptive linguists on languages. My thanks are also due to the co-editors Fuyuki Ebata, Daisuke Ebina and Iku Nagasaki, who supported the editing tasks.

Introduction
euan languages are agglutinative, and their morphology is aracterized by suﬃxation. e word order is relatively free, and there is no overt voice alternation in terms of syntax.
1 Overview
Cusco eua belongs to the euan language family. euan languages are spoken mostly in the Andes region of Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Chile, and Argentina; this region roughly corresponds to the largest extent of the Inca Empire. It is estimated that more than half of the speakers of euan languages live in Peru. Cusco eua is spoken mainly in the department of Cusco, Peru. According to recent statistics

2

CUSCO QUECHUA

(Chirinos 2001), the number of speakers is estimated to be around 1 million. Hosokawa (1988a: 1455) points out that a variety of euan languages spoken in northern Bolivia should be grouped with Cusco eua. If so, the number of speakers would be higher. To the west, Cusco eua borders Ayacuo eua in Andahuaylas, department of Apurimac. Approximately, 6 million people are estimated to be speaking the euan languages.
e genetic relationship of the euan language family with other languages has hitherto not been aested. ere have been arguments in this ﬁeld over a possible genetic relationship between eua and Aymara, i.e. the eumaran hypothesis. Many solars now ascribe the similarities between the two languages to extensive linguistic contact. Nevertheless, there are a few works, for example, Campbell (1997), whi argue in favor of this genetic relationship¹.
Traditional analyses divide euan languages into two groups on a genetic basis. According to Torero’s (1972) classiﬁcation, Cusco eua belongs to the group called eua II (eua A in Parker’s classiﬁcation (1969–1971)). eua I (eua B in Parker’s classiﬁcation) is spoken in Central Peru, whereas eua II is spoken in other areas. Recently, however, some solars argued that the internal genetic classiﬁcation of the euan language family is far more complex (see, for example, Heggarty (2005)).
Some group II languages, including Cusco eua, have voiceless aspirated stops and ejectives with voiceless non-aspirated stops. It is believed that this feature is an eﬀect of the linguistic contact with Aymara².
¹ See Campbell (1997: 273–283) for the history of the linguistic argument of their genetic relationship.
² ose who deny their genetic relationship argue that the voiceless aspirated stops and ejectives were borrowed by some eua varieties from Aymara owing to linguistic contact.

1. OVERVIEW

3

e variety of Cusco eua, whi is studied in this paper, is spoken in communities around the city of Cusco. While I do not have indepth knowledge on the internal dialectal situation of Cusco eua, I have noticed some diﬀerences in the varieties spoken in (a) the eastern part of the department of Apurimac and (b) the southern part of the department of Cusco with respect to the variety spoken in Cusco City. In (a), a high frequency of fricativization of stops is observed³, whereas in (b), some verbal derivational suﬃxes are diﬀerent, whi might have been borrowed recently from Aymara.
Cusco eua has the largest number of speakers among the euan languages. In rural areas, ildren inherit it from their parents, and presool ildren are usually eua monolinguals. However, Spanish is widely taught in sools nowadays, and most speakers—except presool ildren and those aged over 60 years—are eua-Spanish bilinguals. eua is not inherited among people residing in urban areas. Recent years have witnessed a mass migration, whi continues even at present, from rural areas to cities. us, the number of euan languages speakers seems to be steadily decreasing.
While there is no oﬃcial orthography available for eua, a transcription similar to a phonemic has gained popularity among solars. However, Spanish-like transcriptions still exist (see 2.1).
Studies of euan languages, whi were conducted by European priests, began in the sixteenth century. Grammatical descriptions of many varieties appeared in the 1960s. In recent years, the number of studies focusing on language contact or language education has surpassed that of descriptive studies. Historical studies have always received considerable aention among solars. For general information on euan languages, see Cerrón-Palomino (1987), Adelaar (1992), Hosokawa (1988b), etc. See also Adelaar (2004) for information on euan languages and other languages of the Andes. See, for example, Cusihuamán (2001) [1976] and Calvo-Pérez (1993), for grammatical descriptions of contemporary Cusco eua. Furthermore, dictionaries su as Cusihuamán (1976) and Academia Mayor de la Lengua eua (1995) are useful ref-
On the other hand, Campbell (1997) argues that linguistic contact led to the retention of the above stops and ejectives while they were lost in other eua varieties.
³ is seems to be the result of contact with Ayacuo eua.

ere are three series of stops: voiceless non-aspirated, aspirated, and ejective. Aspirated stops and ejectives appear only in roots and not in suﬃxes and enclitics. Phonetically, non-aspirated stops are accompanied by weak aspiration, while aspirated stops are accompanied by strong aspiration. e velar stop /k/ and uvular stop /q/ are likely to fricativize syllable-ﬁnally, and the uvular aspirated stop /qʰ/ is likely to fricativize inter-vocalically (e.g. rikra [ɾikɾa ∼ ɾixɾa] ‘shoulder’, huq [hoq∼hoχ] ‘one’, aqha [ɑqʰɑ∼ɑχɑ] ‘ia’⁴).
Traditionally, solars interpret the syllable ﬁnal nasal as /n/, whi is represented by /ŋ/ here. I consider these two as diﬀerent phonemes⁵. Phonemes /b/, /d/, and /g/ only appear in loanwords from Spanish.

⁴ An alcoholic beverage made from corn grain. ⁵ e reason behind this is as follows. is nasal realizes as [ŋ] word-ﬁnally, or otherwise assimilates its point of articulation to the consonant that follows directly. However, there is a contrast between /n/ and /ñ/ [ɲ] syllable initially. Treating the syllable ﬁnal [ŋ] as /n/ is arbitrary, because whether /n/ or /ñ/ is more appropriate for occurring syllable-ﬁnally and realizing as [ŋ] cannot be determined. Another reason is that at least some speakers pronounce this nasal as [ŋ] before /r/, as in [niŋri] ‘ear’, whi would be rather strange if it were /n/.

2. PHONOLOGY

Table 2 Vowels
front Close i[i∼e] Open

central ba u[u̜∼o]
a[a∼α]

ere are three vowel phonemes: /i/, /a/, and /u/. Further, there is no opposition of the vowel length. e phoneme /i/ realizes as [e], /a/ as [α], and /u/ as [o] before /(C)q/ (except when C is /s/) and aer /q/. Otherwise, /i/ usually appears as [i], /a/ as [a], and /u/ as [u̜].
e transcription used in this paper nearly corresponds to that used in Peru, whi has recently gained popularity. However, there are some diﬀerences between the two⁶, as stated below:

(a) e phonemes /i/ and /u/ are sometimes transcribed as e and o, respectively, before /(C)q/ and aer /q/ in Peru. Usually, this is because of the la of understanding of phonology.

(b) e phoneme /ŋ/ is transcribed as n in Peru because of the diﬀerence in the phonological interpretation described above.

(c) In order to avoid confusion between the aspiration and the gloal /h/, this paper transcribes aspirated stops with a superscript /ʰ/. Aspiration is usually expressed by h or ’’ in Peru.

2.2 Syllable Structure
e syllable structure of Cusco eua is C1V(C2). ere is no hiatus; one or two consonants always intervene between vowels. However, C1 may be absent word-initially. us, a word comprising more than two syllables has the phonological form of (C)V(C)CV(C)…. As for monosyllabic words, there is actually no word whose phonological form is V(C); only words with CV and CVC forms exist. Most of the roots are disyllabic, while most of the suﬃxes are monosyllabic.
All the consonants except /ŋ/ may appear syllable-initially. Further, the phonemes /k/, /q/, /ph/, /ŋ/, /s/, /sh/, /l/, /r/, /w/, and /y/ appear syllable-ﬁnally. In some dialects, /p/ and // also appear syllable-ﬁnally.
⁶ Both in this paper and in Peru, the fricative [ʃ] is transcribed as sh. Since the phonemes /s/ and /h/ never appear adjacent to ea other in this order, there is no ambiguity.

2.3 Accent Cusco eua is a stress-accent language. Stress falls on the penultimate syllable and is non-distinctive.
2.4 Morphophonology Solars point out that morphophonological ange is less frequent in eua than it is in Aymara. Nevertheless, there are cases where this ange occurs, as shown in some examples below. Some suﬃxes of the phonological form C(C)u have an allomorph; that is, when two or more suﬃxes of the phonological form C(C)u are adjacent to ea other, the vowel /u/ of the antecedent suﬃx anges to /a/ as in -C(C)aC(C)u (dissimilation), or drops.
(1) -yku + -mu → -ykamu
(2) -mu + -pu → -mpu
Some suﬃxes have two allomorphs depending on whether the preceding phoneme is a vowel or consonant. For example, the genitive suﬃx -q(pa)/-pa appears as -q(pa) aer a vowel and as -pa aer a consonant.
(3) a. nuqa-q(pa) ‘my’ (1) b. qaŋ-pa ‘your’ () (2)
When a suﬃx that does not have su allomorphs is aaed to the stem, there is sometimes a possibility of a consonant sequence in the same syllable. is violates the syllable structure discussed in 2.2. However, this is not the case in reality. e linker -ni- is inserted between the two morphemes, and a consonant sequence is avoided.
(4) atuq ‘fox’ + -yki ‘2nd person’ → atuq-ni-yki ‘your fox’
Roots do not undergo morphophonological ange. e only exception is when the suﬃx -pu is aaed to hamu- ‘come’; the outcome of whi is haŋpu-. Apparently, the reason behind this has a historical basis: it is thought that the root hamu- was originally composed of two morphemes, as in ha-mu-. Observe the morphophonological ange in (2).

3. WORD CLASSES

Synronically, however, this analysis is not valid, and hamu- should be treated only as one morpheme.

3 Word classes
ere are two categories of words: words with aaed suﬃxes and those without. I will call these two categories inﬂected words and non-inﬂected words, respectively.

Inﬂected Words

aaed aaed

Non-inﬂected Words not aaed aaed

Inﬂected words are categorized into nominals and verbs. Suﬃxes are diﬀerent in nominals and verbs⁷. See Chapter 4 for details. us, the categorization of words is mainly done on morphological grounds. Noninﬂected words are particles and interjections.
e distinction between nominals and verbs is not always clear. Some roots are only used as nominals. For example, papa ‘potato’ can take only nominal suﬃxes and can function only as a nominal. On the other hand, suwa can be interpreted as ‘steal’ when it takes verbal suﬃxes and can function as a verb. However, it can also take nominal suﬃxes and function as a nominal and is interpreted as ‘robber’. Several roots may function as both verbs and nominals. is might be regarded as conversion or ‘zero’ derivation from verbs to nominals. However, I doubt if su a simple solution is valid for this problem.
Nominals can be subclassiﬁed into nouns, numerals, demonstratives, personal pronouns, and interrogative words on syntactic and semantic grounds.
A noun can be a modiﬁer or a modiﬁcand. I do not ﬁnd any noun– adjective distinction. ere is no morphological evidence to distinguish nouns and adjectives. A numeral can be a modiﬁer or can appear independently but cannot be a modiﬁcand. Demonstratives behave in the

same manner as numerals. As is discussed later, there is a tendency to prevent two or more modiﬁers from appearing in the same noun phrase. However, if this occurs, the word order is rigid, as shown below:

demonstrative

numeral

other modiﬁer(s)

A personal pronoun cannot be a modiﬁer or a modiﬁcand, and it appears independently. An interrogative word can be a modiﬁer or can appear independently but cannot be a modiﬁcand. Further, it is employed to form a wh-question (content question) sentence.

4 Morphology
Word formation is done by suﬃxation⁸; there is no preﬁx or inﬁx.
(5) tanqa-yu-ru-ra-ni. push-into1 ‘I pushed (it) into strongly.’
In (5), suﬃxes -yu, -ru, -ra, and -ni are aaed to the verb root tanqa‘push’. Derivational suﬃxes and inﬂectional suﬃxes are distinguishable. In the case of (5), -yu and -ru are derivational, whi are aaed to the root tanqa- and together make up a verb stem tanqayuru- ‘push into strongly’; then, inﬂectional suﬃxes -ra and -ni are aaed to it. e order of suﬃxes is ﬁxed regardless of whether a noun or a verb is involved⁹. In (5), it is not possible to ange the order of suﬃxes. Furthermore, the same suﬃx never appears twice in the same word.
A nominal root may appear alone as a complete word without any suﬃx. Verb stems may not appear alone: person suﬃx and/or nominalizing or adverbializing suﬃx are/is always aaed to it.
(6) a. runa hamu-ŋ. person come3 ‘A person/persons come(s)/came.’
b. *runa hamu
⁸It is arguable to admit compounding. See below. ⁹ However, I have not conﬁrmed all the dialects of Cusco eua.

4. MORPHOLOGY

In (6), nothing is aaed to the nominal root runa ‘person’, whi is a complete noun. In contrast, the 3rd person suﬃx -ŋ is aaed to the verb stem (and the root) hamu- ‘come’. (6b) is ungrammatical because nothing is aaed to hamu-: a person suﬃx, nominalizing suﬃx, or adverbializing suﬃx is necessary.
4.1 Nominal morphology 4.1.1 Nominal derivation ere are nominal derivational suﬃxes su as the augmentative -sapa ‘having many, mu’, diminutive -a, proprietive -yuq, and -ŋtiŋ ‘along with’. Some examples are as follows:
alqu-a ‘doggy’, qulqi-sapa ‘ri’ (having a lot of money), uma-sapa ‘one(s) that has/have a big head’, qulqi-yuq ‘ri’ (having money), wayqiŋtiŋ ‘with a brother/brothers’.
Some nominal derivational suﬃxes have very low productivity, making it diﬃcult to judge whether the form should be treated as an independent morpheme or whether the whole word should be treated as a single morpheme.

1st person plural inclusive: -ŋis
ese suﬃxes indicate the person of the possessor in the following manner:
(7) wawa-y (ild1) ‘my ild’
Agreement by a person-marking suﬃx is obligatory. erefore, I consider it valid to estimate that person-marking suﬃxes are inﬂectional. Compare (8a), (8b), and (8c):
(8) a. nuqa-q(pa) wawa-y 1 ild1 ‘my ild’
b. *nuqa-q(pa) wawa 1 ild
c. wawa-y ild1 ‘my ild’
While (8a) and (8c) are grammatical, (8b) is ungrammatical. As is clear in (8c), the independent possessor noun phrase does not have to necessarily appear.
e suﬃxes that follow, i.e. the additional person-/number-marking suﬃxes and case-marking suﬃxes, are also considered to be inﬂectional.
4.1.2.2 Additional Person and Number ere are two suﬃxes that occupy the slot directly aer a person-marking suﬃx, whi is used to indicate the plurality of the possessor. I call these suﬃxes additional person-marking suﬃxes.
(9) wawa-y-ku ild1[+3] ‘our ild’

4. MORPHOLOGY

11

(10) wawa-yki-is ild2[+2] ‘your () ild’
e two suﬃxes are -ku (additional 3rd person) and -is (additional 2nd person). ese two may also appear on verbs. See 4.2.3 for details.
e suﬃx -kuna indicates the plurality of the reference of the noun.
(11) wawa-kuna ild ‘ildren’
-kuna and -ku do not co-occur¹⁰. us, it is not possible to express ‘our () ildren’ by a single word.
(12) *wawa-y-ku-kuna ild1[+3]
e suﬃxes -ŋis or -is and -kuna may co-occur, as in (13).
(13) a. wawa-ŋis-kuna ild1() ‘our () ildren’
b. wawa-yki-is-kuna ild2[+2] ‘your () ildren’
Nominal plural marking is not obligatory. For example, if you say wawa-kuna ‘ildren’, the plurality of the referent is clearly shown. On the other hand, if you say wawa ‘ild’, it is unclear whether there is one ild or more as the referent.
e following table shows the person, additional person, and plural marking of nominals.

¹⁰Apparently, the reason is that ku of -kuna and -ku are cognate. Synronically, however, it is not possible to analyze -kuna as -ku-na.

¹¹By comparing Tables 6 and 7, we can note that the intransitive and transitive verb inﬂections of the 3rd person object are the same; that is, there is no 3rd person object morpheme.

e following person-marking suﬃxes are identiﬁed:

-y/-ni 1st person subject

-ŋki 2nd person subject

-ŋ

3rd person subject

-ŋis 1st person plural (inclusive) subject

4.2.3 Number Marking
e marking of plurality is done by adding -ku or -is aer the subjectmarking suﬃx. I analyze these suﬃxes as the additional 3rd person marker and additional 2nd person marker, respectively. For example, the form -y-ku comprises -y ‘1st person subject’ and -ku ‘additional 3rd person’, i.e. ‘1+3’; it expresses ‘1st person plural (exclusive) subject’ as a whole. e form -ŋki-is comprises -ŋki ‘2nd person subject’ and -is ‘additional 2nd person’, i.e. ‘2+2’; it expresses ‘2nd person plural subject’ as a whole. e form -ŋ-ku comprises -ŋ ‘3rd person subject’ and -ku ‘additional 3rd person’, i.e. ‘3+3’; it expresses ‘3rd person plural subject’ as a whole. Agreement is obligatory, except when the subject is 3rd person plural: it can be -ŋ ‘3’ or -ŋ-ku ‘3+3’, as in (16).
(16) paykuna hamu-ŋ(-ku). they come3([+3]) ‘ey come/came.’
Number marking with -ku or -is is applied for not only the subject but also the object. For example, the form -wa-ŋ-ku ‘1.3[+3]’ can be interpreted as ‘3rd person singular subject/1st person plural (exclusive) object’, ‘3rd person plural subject/1st person singular object’, or ‘3rd person plural subject/1st person plural (exclusive) object’. us, it is unclear whether the referent of -ku or -is is agent, patient, or both.
However, the form -ŋ-ku can only be interpreted as ‘3rd person plural subject’, as in (17).

(17) maqa-ŋ-ku. beat3[+3]
‘ey beat.’

18

CUSCO QUECHUA

In (17), -ku cannot be interpreted as expressing the plurality of the patient. is is because of the absence of any form expressing the 3rd person object. e suﬃxes -ku and -is can only function in the presence of the subject marker or object marker. For details on the system of plural marking in Cusco eua, see Ebina (1998).
4.2.4 Nominalization and Adverbialization Nominalizing and adverbializing suﬃxes appear in the same position as past tense suﬃxes do. ere are four nominalizers: -sqa (realis), -na (irrealis), -y (inﬁnitive), and -q (agentive). A word composed of a stem and a nominalizer (nominalized verb) takes nominal suﬃxes. Examples of nominalized verbs composed from the verb stem qilqa- ‘write’ are mentioned below:
(18) qilqa-sqa ‘wrien thing’ (i.e. document), ‘wrien’ (state)
(19) qilqa-na ‘something to write’ (i.e. pen, note, etc.)
(20) qilqa-q ‘one who writes’
Examples (18), (19), and (20) ea have a referent. Nominalized verbs may also express actions or states, as in (21), (22), and (23).
(21) qilqa-sqa-ŋ ‘that s/he wrote’
(22) qilqa-na-ŋ ‘that s/he is going to write’
(23) qilqa-q ‘state of eating/in order to eat’
(24) qilqa-y ‘to eat’
at is to say, a nominalized verb may be interpreted semantically as a nominal or verb. Syntactically, when a verb is nominalized, it shows some nominal aracteristics, but it also retains verbal aracteristics. See 5.12 for details.
ere are two adverbializing suﬃxes: -spa and -qti. A word composed of a verb stem and an adverbializer (adverbialized verb) has a morphological similarity to nominalized verbs. In other words, person suﬃxes are those that are aaed to nominals and not to verbs.

(25) hamu-qti-yki=qa come.2= ‘When/If you come/came’
At the same time, it has some syntactic similarities to ﬁnite verbs. See 5.12 for details.
4.3 Particles Particles are words other than nominals, verbs, and interjections. Some examples are negative mana and ama, hina ‘as’, riki (used for the conﬁrmation or reminder to the hearer), and ña ‘already’. ña has a clitic form (same form).
4.4 Interjections Interjections have a phonological form of aC1aC2a(C3a)(C4a)w. Some examples are aakaw ‘Ou!’ and atakaw ‘Horrible!’.
In interjections, stress is on the ﬁnal syllable, whi is diﬀerent from other parts of spee. In this paper, I treat this ﬁnal stress as an accent, but it is unclear whether it should be treated as an accent or intonation. Further resear is required in this regard.
4.5 Distinction between suﬀixes and enclitics e following criteria are applied:
(a) A suﬃx may not be aaed to both verbs and nominals (however, there are a few exceptions). Suﬃxes may not be aaed to particles. An enclitic may either be aaed to verbs, nominals, or particles.
(b) e enclitic =ña has its independent counterpart ña. Suﬃxes do not have su counterparts.
(c) Enclitics =a and =ma have their own stress (accent). ere are no suﬃxes that have their own stress¹³.
(d) e 1st person subject non-future suﬃx has two allomorphs, namely, -y and -ni. When a suﬃx follows, the morph -y occurs; when no suﬃx
¹³is might be an intonation, not an accent. See also 4.4.

20

CUSCO QUECHUA

follows, the morph -ni occurs. When a morpheme that qualiﬁes the above criteria (a), (b), and (c) directly follows, the morph -ni occurs. us, the morpheme concerned has to be analyzed as an enclitic rather than as a suﬃx.
However, enclitic =ŋ/=mi (aﬃrmative) appears as =ŋ aer a vowel, and as =mi aer a consonant. is enclitic is thus suﬃx-like in that it shows a morphophonological alternation.

4.6 Compounds or Idiomatic Phrases
ere are constructions composed of two nominals; however, I am unsure whether they should be classiﬁed as compounds or idiomatic phrases.

(26) yaa-y

wasi

know. house

‘sool’

e second nominal has a clear stress on the penultimate syllable. e stress of the ﬁrst nominal is not very clear. It is unclear whether this is the same as the noun phrase. Determining whether they are compounds or phrases has been le as an open issue for further resear.

4.7 Reduplication Some stems reduplicate.

(27) wañu-wañu (die-die) ‘weak, dying’

Moreover, some words reduplicate. Even here, it is uncertain whether these are compounds or idiomatic phrases.

(28) puñu-y

puñu-y

sleep. sleep.

A nominal predicative sentence has the structure of ‘NP1 NP2’, whi is interpreted as ‘NP1 is NP2’.
(30) ay alqu=qa hatuŋ=mi. that dog= big= ‘at dog (is) big.’
In a verbal predicative sentence, the only obligatory element is a ﬁnite verb.
(31) (nuqa=qa) (ay-ta) yaa-ni. (1=) (that) know1 ‘I know (that).’
See 5.12 for complex sentences. Instead of a nominal predicative sentence, a copula verb sentence that does not signiﬁcantly ange its meaning may be employed.

b. nuqa=qa alliŋ ka-sha-ni. 1= good be1 ‘I am well.’
5.2 Word Order Word order is generally free in verb predicative sentences. An exception is negation. A negative particle has to antecede a negative focus.

22

CUSCO QUECHUA

(33) nuqa=qa ay runa-ta mana riqsi-ni=u. 1= that person  recognize1=.
‘I don’t know that person.’
In (33), the main verb reqsi-ni ‘I know’ with the negative focus enclitic =u is the negative focus. e negative particle mana has to antecede the verb. However, mana does not have to directly precede the negative focus. In (33), it can appear before nuqa=qa ‘I’ (), or ay runa-ta ‘that person’ ().
As mentioned above, the word order is generally free. However, in nominalized clauses, the most usual word order is ‘subject object verb’. erefore, the basic word order is usually regarded as SOV. See 5.12.1 for details.
Nominal modiﬁers always precede the head. e noun phrasal word order is shown below:

[possessor] [] [modifying noun] [head] [-person] [-additional person/number]
e person marker and additional person marker coincide with the person and number of the possessor.
(34) nuqa-qpa hatuŋ alqu-y 1 big dog1 ‘my big dog’
In (34), the possessor noun is 1st person singular. e person-marking suﬃx aaed to the head noun is -y (1st person), whi corresponds to the person and number of the possessor noun. Person (and number) marking is obligatory.
e above-mentioned word order of the nominal phrase is rigid. If a (modifying) noun precedes the possessor noun, the modiﬁer is interpreted as modifying the possessor noun and not the head noun of the entire noun phrase, as in (35).

5. SYNTAX

23

(35) hu’uy runa-qpa yana alqu-ŋ small person bla dog3
‘a small person’s bla dog’

In (35), hu’uy ‘small’ can only be interpreted as modifying runa ‘person’, not alqu ‘dog’.
As mentioned earlier, when more than one modiﬁer exists, the word order is as follows:

demonstrative

numeral

other modiﬁer(s)

(36) ay iskay hatuŋ alqu that two big dog ‘those two big dogs’
However, there is a tendency to avoid modiﬁcation by more than one modiﬁer. It is not surprising that modiﬁcation of the same head by two or more demonstratives or numerals does not occur; however, it is worth mentioning that simultaneous modiﬁcation by other modiﬁers is likely to be avoided.
(37) hatuŋ yana alqu big bla dog ‘big bla dog’
us, noun phrases with two modiﬁers, as is the case in (37), are grammatical but rarely used in reality.
5.3 Grammatical relations In verb predicative sentences, noun phrases that agree with person-marking on main verbs can be seen as subjects and/or objects.
(38) ay runa nuqa-ta maqa-wa-ŋ. that person 1 beat1.3 ‘at person beat(s) me.’

24

In (38), ay runa ‘that person’ is seen as the subject noun phrase, whereas nuqa-ta ‘me ()’ is seen as the object noun phrase. e person of the subject is always marked on the verb in verb predicative sentences. erefore, there are no problems in identifying the subject. However, for the object, its person is not marked when it is in the 3rd person. is issue is complex and will not be discussed further here; however, I consider it valid to only admit objects in the 1st or 2nd person.
In clauses whose main verb is ﬁnite (hereaer ‘ﬁnite clause’), subjects always appear in the zero case. Depending on the verb, objects appear in accusative, dative, ablative, or benefactive case.

5.4.2 Reflexive

(48) a. maki-ŋ-ta t’aqsa-ku-ŋ. hand3i wash3i ‘S/hei washes/washed his/heri hand(s).’
b. maki-ŋ-ta t’aqsa-ŋ. hand3i wash3j ‘S/hei washes/washed his/herj hand(s).’ (i ≠ j)
In (48a), the owner of the ‘hand(s)’ and the agent of ‘washing’ are the same, whereas they are diﬀerent in (48b).
In some cases, however, the diﬀerence in the meanings according to the presence/absence of -ku is hardly recognizable. For example, both asiand asi-ku- mean ‘laugh’. e verb stem asi-ku- does not mean ‘laugh oneself’. Moreover, emotive verbs usually appear with -ku (e.g. llaki-ku‘lament’).
Some transitive-meaning verbs ange their meaning to intransitive when -ku is aaed.

(50a) signiﬁes that ea of ‘them’ washed their own hands, and so it has a reﬂexive meaning. On the other hand, (50b) signiﬁes that ea of them does/did not wash their own hands but wash(ed) ea other’s hands and therefore has a reciprocal meaning.

5.4.4 Pseudo-passive
e combination of causative -i and reﬂexive -ku has pseudo-passive meaning.

(51) a. suwa-i-ku- (steal) ‘be stolen’
b. maqa-i-ku- (beat) ‘be beaten’
However, this is not the real passive, because this form can only be used when the causer (subject) is the cause of the action. In (51a) or (51b), the causer (subject) is considered to be responsible for ‘leing something be stolen’ or ‘being beaten’, for example, s/he le the thing behind or s/he made someone angry; that is, a causative meaning still exists.

5.5 Tense and aspect
We can distinguish future tense and non-future tense according to the person suﬃx paradigms, as already seen in 4.3.2. e non-future tense form of stative verbs signiﬁes the state of the time of speaking. When the verb is non-stative (and without any aspectual suﬃx), it signiﬁes an action already performed or a habitual action. Future tense form signiﬁes a state or an action in the future.
A past tense suﬃx can be aaed to a non-future tense form. Past tense form signiﬁes a state or an action in the past. ere are two past tense suﬃxes: -r(q)a and -sqa. e former signiﬁes simple past tense, while the laer, past hearsay.
ere is an aspectual suﬃx, -sha, whi signiﬁes the progressive aspect. I consider this suﬃx as inﬂectional according to its position. On the other hand, two derivational suﬃxes, -mu and -pu, also have aspectual meaning. e suﬃx -mu signiﬁes an action or a state of being perceived by the speaker and can be translated as ‘come doing something’. e suﬃx -pu signiﬁes a perfective meaning or a benefactive meaning.

5.6 Functions of enclitics Examples of enclitics are provided below:
=pas ‘too’, =ña ‘already’, =raq ‘not yet’, =taq (contrastive), =qa (topic), =mi/ŋ (aﬃrmative/direct information), =s(is) (hearsay), =a (speculation), =ma¹⁹, =u (focus of question/negation), =ri (eo question)
Like the suﬃxes, more than one enclitic can be aaed to the same word; however, the same enclitic cannot be aaed more than once.
Moreover, the order of the enclitics seems to be fairly rigid. In (52), =a has to appear outside other enclitics²⁰.

In an independent clause, =u has to be aaed to the focus of negation. e negative particle has to precede the word to whi =u is attaed. See (33) in 5.2. On the other hand, =u cannot appear in an adverbialized clause, nominalized clause, or noun phrase.
5.8 estion Yes–no questions (or polar questions) are formed by adding =u to the focus of the question. Negative questions are formed by adding =u to the negative particle mana.

5.9 Command ere are two imperatives: one for 2nd person and the other for 3rd person.
For 2nd person, the suﬃx -y, whi has the same form as the nominalizer -y, is used.
(57) a. hamu-y. come ‘Come!’ (for 2nd person singular)
b. hamu-y-is. come[+2] ‘Come!’ (for 2nd person plural)
In (57b), if -y were the nominalizer, it would not be possible to add -is without a person suﬃx. In this respect, the imperative -y and the nominalizer -y should be regarded as two diﬀerent morphemes synronically, although they are likely to be cognates.
For 3rd person, the suﬃx -uŋ is added to the verb stem.
(58) a. hamu-uŋ. come.3 ‘S/he shall come!’
b. hamu-uŋ-ku. come.3[+3] ‘ey shall come!’
5.10 Possession e existential verb ka- or a derivational noun is used to express possession. If one wishes to express ‘I have a dog’, for example, the following two expressions are possible:
(59) a. (nuqa=qa) alqu-y ka-sha-ŋ. 1= dog1 be3 ‘I have a dog/dogs.’ (lit. My dog(s) is/are)

Alienable/inalieanable possessions are not diﬀerentiated.

5.11 Conjunction
ere are no conjunctions in eua. e comitative suﬃx -waŋ is used to coordinate nouns.

5.12 Complex sentences A complex sentence comprises an independent clause (ﬁnite clause) and more than one subordinate clause (non-ﬁnite clause). As mentioned earlier, there are two types of non-ﬁnite clauses: nominalized and adverbialized. ese two types are diﬀerent from ﬁnite clauses in the following respect:
a) In nominalized and adverbialized clauses, the main verb has to appear clause-ﬁnally. ere is no su constraint in ﬁnite clauses.
b) In nominalized and adverbialized clauses, many enclitics (e.g. evidentials, topic markers, etc.) cannot appear.

5.12.1 Nominalized Clauses
Verb forms with the nominalizers -sqa/-na/-q/-y are called nominalized verbs, and the clause whose main verb is a nominalized verb is called a nominalized clause. ere are other constraints apart from those in 5.12:
c) In a ﬁnite clause, the subject always appears in the zero case form, while in a nominalized clause, it is likely to appear in the genitive case. A noun phrase that appears in the accusative case in a ﬁnite clause is likely to appear in the zero case form. is zero case form noun phrase has to appear directly before the verb. However, if it appears in the accusative case, there is no su constraint.

When it appears in the zero case, it has to appear directly before the verb. erefore, (65) is ungrammatical.

We will ﬁnd some similarities and diﬀerences on comparing nominal phrases and nominalized clauses. As is already described, the structure of nominal phrases is ‘possessor noun modiﬁer noun head nounperson-additional person/number’, whi is similar to (64b) in form. However, in a nominalized clause, a noun phrase/phrases of every case form is/are possible as a complement/complements of the main verb. In a noun phrase, on the other hand, only a genitive possessor noun phrase and a modiﬁer noun/nouns of the zero case form are possible.

5.12.2 Adverbialized Clauses
Here, a structure whose main verb is the verb form that has an adverbializing suﬃx -spa/-qti is called an ‘adverbialized clause’. Some examples are mentioned below:

(67) a. Carlos mikʰu-spa

llank’a-ra-ŋ.

 eat . work3

 eat.3  work3

‘When Carlos ate, Jesus worked.’

Some solars regard the diﬀerence between -spa and -qti as that between a same subject (-spa) and a diﬀerent subject (-qti), as in (67a) and (67b). However, -qti may be used for both same and diﬀerent subjects. e use of -spa or -qti seems to depend on whether the two actions are considered to comprise one (in case of -spa) or two diﬀerent events (in case of -qti). ese diﬀerent events can be conducted by the same (same subject) or diﬀerent entities (diﬀerent subject).
In an adverbialized clause, the case form(s) of a noun phrase(s) is/are the same as that/those of a ﬁnite clause. In this respect, adverbialized clauses are diﬀerent from nominalized clauses.

(68) a. Carlos papa-ta=qa

 potato eat.3

is seems to be because the -spa form is solely used for same subjects. at is to say, in an uerance, it seems necessary to formally show the agent of the action in question.
