Preface
SIL-Brazil is very happy to present LaVera Betts’ Kagwahiva Dictionary, albeit posthumously. After serving the Parintintin and Tenharim communities of the state of Amazonas, Brazil for several decades, LaVera had an aneurysm in Porto Velho and died in a hospital in São Paulo, in September 2006.
As linguistics coordinator of SIL-Brazil, I knew some years before LaVera’s death that she was working on a multi-dialect database of Kagwahiva words, and aware of how important this work was, I encouraged her to keep on with it. She did keep on with it, but was unable to publish her work before she died. Her fellow worker of many years, Helen Pease, preserved LaVera’s work, and began the task of preparing it for publication. After she did what she could, we worked together to bring it to completion.
Since LaVera was not with us to answer questions, this is not a complete work. There are a few things concerning which neither Helen nor I could figure out LaVera’s intentions. But on the other hand, there aren’t any great lacunas in it, either. We believe that the information is fairly complete, especially for the Parintintin and Tenharim dialects. It is noteworthy that LaVera’s Dicionário Parintintin-Português Português Parintintin went through several editions starting in 1968. The 1981 edition is available for download at the SIL-Brazil website: http://www.sil.org/americas/brasil/publcns/dictgram/PNDict.pdf.
LaVera left a detailed record of the times and places of the fieldwork on which this dictionary is based. Following are the times of her contact with speakers of each of the dialects:
Parintintin: February 17, 1961 to September 18, 1975 at the Ipixuna River in the state of Amazonas, Brazil.
Tenharim: April 29, 1975 to 2006 at the Marmelos River, in the state of Amazonas. Karipuna: April 15 to May 2, 1980 at FUNAI Posto Panorama, Jaci Paraná River, in the
state of Rondônia. Uru-eu-wau-wau: January 3-22, 1991 at FUNAI Posto Comandante Ari, during which a
very brief contact was made with Uru-eu-wau-wau speakers who appeared at the post; there was no one in the village near Comandante Ari during that time; and August 20-30, 1991, at the FUNAI Casa do Índio in Porto Velho, Rondônia. Amundava: February 4-18, 1991, at FUNAI Posto Trincheira, Rondônia.

Introduction
This short introduction to the Kagwahiva Dictionary has four sections. The first section gives a general overview of the kinds of information contained in the entries of the dictionary. The second section contains an explanation of the phonetic symbols used in the entry words and the example sentences. The third section is a short overview of the grammar of Parintintin focusing on the word classes. The final section provides a key to the abbreviations used in the text of the dictionary.
1. The Entries.
There are several kinds of information contained in the entries of the dictionary. Usually the first bit of information that follows the entry word is the word class. The major word classes are nouns, listed as s (substantive class i) and sh (substantive class h), and verbs, which are divided into vt (transitive verb class i), vth (transitive verb class h), vi (intransitive verb class i), vih (intransitive verb class h), d (descriptive verb class i), and dh (descriptive verb class h). These verb subclasses, along with the minor word classes, are described in section 3.
For many entries, there is some information in brackets (//) immediately following the entry word, and before the word class. Various kinds of ancillary information can be located here, including information on phonological conditioning, variants caused by allophones, accompanying factors, and irregularities. For example, for the -peka entry we have this: //-peka ~ -mbeka//. This means that there is a pronunciation variant for this word.
Following the word class is the definition, and for some entries, there are two or more numbered definitions. Many definitions are accompanied by one or more example phrases or sentences, each with its translation. The translations are mostly pretty literal, as LaVera wanted the reader to be able to see the correspondence between the words of the translation and the words of the vernacular.
For many entries there are one or more usage subentries; this is where LaVera located information on causatives, reciprocals, reflexives, and concomitives. There are often additional example phrases or sentences here.
Finally, LaVera specified two kinds of cross-reference entries. The crossreference entries indicated by See: are other words with similar meanings, or words whose meanings are related in some way and can yield other information of interest. Those indicated by Alt:, on the other hand, are usually alternate forms of the main entry word.
Unless marked otherwise, the entry words are Parintintin words, and the information associated with them (including definitions, examples, usage information, and cross-references) is information concerning Partintintin. But of course, the purpose of the dictionary is to compare Parintintin and Tenharim with the other dialects, so the entries are full of these comparisons as well. Whenever there is information concerning
1

one of the other dialects, this is indicated by one of the following labels: Tenh (Tenharim), K (Karipuna), Uru (Uru-eu-wau-wau), or Am (Amundava). Each time one of these labels is used, a new line is begun, to make it easy to tell what information is associated with each dialect. So as to save space, the equal sign (=) is used whenever the meaning in the particular dialect is the same as the meaning in Parintintin.
Helen Pease, LaVera’s fellow researcher, made a number of low-level editorial changes in LaVera’s database. Mostly this consisted in formatting changes, clarifications, and harmonization, and hardly any of these changes affected the substance of the entries. Whenever Helen had a more serious suggestion or question about LaVera’s information, she put these in notes. These notes are within square brackets [], and are labelled HP (for Helen Pease) at the beginning of each note.

Nasalization Rules
Nasalization occurs regressively within the word. Nasalization is normally not written on a vowel when contiguous to a nasal consonant or following a nasalized vowel.
All the nasal consonants (m, n, nh, g, gw) occur between nasalized vowels, and word initial.
Prenasalized stops (mb, nd, nj, ng, ngw) occur after nasalized vowels and before oral vowels. mb and nd also occur word initial.
The oral stops (j, g, gw) occur between oral vowels, and word initial. The following are sets of allophones: (m, mb), (n, nd), (j, nh, nj), (g, ng), (gw, gw, ngw).
Voiceless Vowel
A word final capital A indicates voicelessness, e.g. aerajykA.
Note on Alphabetical Order
g follows g in the alphabet. Dashes (-) are ignored, and nasalized vowels are not differentiated from oral vowels for the purpose of ordering.
Note on Dashes (-) in the Entries
Many of the entry words in the dictionary have a dash at the beginning or the end of the word. A dash at the end of the entry means that it is a prefix, e.g. the first person singular subject prefix a-. A dash at the beginning of an entry can mean that it is a suffix, e.g. the substantive marker -a, but usually it means that the word may only occur with a prefix, e.g. the verb -ahav ‘cross over an object’. There are a few entries that have a dash in parentheses, e.g. the relater (-)pype ‘inside’, and this means that in certain contexts this word requires a prefix, but in other contexts it may occur by itself.
Word Final Consonants
On the surface there are no consonant-final words in Kagwahiva. Verb stems may underlyingly end in a consonant, and these are shown in the entry words, but they only appear in surface forms when the stem is followed by a suffix. If there is no suffix, the final consonant is deleted.
3. Parintintin grammar.
3.0. Introduction
There are two major classes of lexical items in Parintintin: Substantives and Verbs. In addition there are a number of minor classes of limited membership. Cutting
4

across these classes of items there is a basic division into two groups; those which occur with Class Marker h- or one of its manifesting forms and those which occur with Class Marker i- in certain constructions. This division affects the Substantives, Verbs, and Relaters. In the second group, with i-, the Substantives, Transitive Verbs, Intransitive Verbs, Descriptive Verbs, and Relaters, are indicated in the dictionary, by s, vt, vi, d, and rr, respectively; in the first group, with h-, they are indicated by sh, vth, vih, dh, and rrh, respectively. The Class Marker h- has varying forms: t-, h-, r- , j-, and gw-. The occurrence of the forms of the two class markers is indicated in the dictionary entries under h- and i- respectively, (and hereafter referred to as clmh and clmi).

3.1. Open Classes

A. Substantives.

1) Formation. Substantives are either simple, compound or complex.

a. Simple. Simple Substantives consist of one root.

ex: s s sh sh

akanitara -akaga -apyja okara

'hat' 'head' 'house' 'clearing'

b. Compound. Compound Substantives are formed from a substantive root plus one or more roots or stems of any type.

ex: s + s

akuti-nambia agouti-ear

'fungus'

sh + s

-ata-'yva fire-wood

'fire sticks'

sh + d

-ata-tiga fire-white

'smoke'

s + vi

yvy-apyna ground-bend

'embankment'

s + vt

avati-mbopoga corn-explode

'popcorn'

5

c. Complex. Complex Substantives are formed from one or more roots plus one or more of the following affixes: Substantive Markers, Tense Markers, Relational Suffixes, Aspects.

i. The Substantive Markers (hereafter referred to as sm) include the following: -ve'ea 'thing', used also to indicate a dead person or thing; -por 'source or habitual'; -hava 'instrumental'; -embi- 'agent'; -ve and -gwe 'occupation', -hara 'profession'.

ex: d + sm

-katu-ve'ea pretty-thing

vt + sm

-kyti-hava cut-instrument

'scissors'

sm + vt

-embi-'ua sm-eat

'food'

ii. The Tense Markers (hereafter referred to as tm) include the following: -ruama and -agwama 'future'; -ruera and -gwera ~ -agwera ~ -ngwera and -kwera 'past'; -pyra ~ -mbyra 'already accomplished'.

ex: vi + tm

-ka'e-angwera

'scar'

heal-tm

vih + tm

-uv-agwera live-tm

'past residence'

iii. The Relational Suffixes (hereafter referred to as rsuf) include: -amo ~ -no ~ -ro ~ -ramo; -mo ~ -amo; -vo ~ -mo ~ -imo; -i; -ime.

ex: s + rsuf

kagwahiv-amo Indian-rsuf

'Indians'

s + rsuf

-evir-i buttocks-rsuf

'behind'

6

iv. The Aspects (hereafter referred to as asp) include numerous members (see under Aspect).

ex: s + asp

kujavu'r-ia loose-little

'insect'

s + s + vt + asp

anhaga-pi'r-og-uhua spirit -skin-off-big

'scalp'

2) Possession. Substantives are either optionally or obligatorily possessed. Possession is indicated by a pronominal form of set 3 or 5 (see section on Pronominals) or a Substantive directly preceding the stem. In the dictionary obligatory possession is indicated by a preceding hyphen.

ex: Pirahã akanitara Idahẽa oapoapo.

Pirahã hat

Ida made

'Ida made a hat (like that) of the Pirahã Indians.'

Embuhu e-apoa ore ve. give p3-thing us to

'Give us your thing.'

Ojipe'ga opyhy ga-nda'yra'ga. others grab p5-sons 'Others grabbed their sons (not their own sons).'

B. Verbs.

There are three major types of Verbs: Descriptive, Transitive and Intransitive.

1) Stem Formation.

a. Transitive Stems are either simple, compound, or complex.

i. Simple. Simple Transitives consist of one root.

ex: -apo

'make'

ii. Compound. Compound Transitives consist of either Substantive and Verb root or reduplication of Verb root. There may be one syllable or two syllable reduplication. In one syllable reduplication the final stressed syllable is reduplicated. In two syllable reduplication, the final stressed syllable plus the preceding (unstressed) syllable is reduplicated. (At times the aspect is reduplicated.) Reduplication indicates repeated or intensified action.

7

ex: -y-'u water-eat

'drink'

potuka-tuka

'wash (clothes, etc)'

iii. Complex. Complex Transitives consist of causative plus Intransitive, Descriptive, or Substantive stems or Aspects.

ex: with vi:

-mo-ka'ẽ caus-heal

'roast'

with d:

-mbo-katu caus-pretty

'make pretty'

with s:

-mbo-jukyr caus-salt

'salt (meat, etc)'

with asp:

-mbo-'i caus-little

'pound (make little)'

b. Intransitive. Intransitive stems are either simple, compound or complex.

i. Simple. Simple Intransitives consist of one root.

ex: -ho

'go'

ii. Compound. Compound Intransitives consist of either Substantive and Verb root or reduplication of Verb Root.

ex: -ova-vur face-rise

'lift the face'

-ma'ẽ-ma'ẽ awake-awake

'awake (one after another)'

iii. Complex. Complex Intransitives consist of a reciprocal plus transitive stem.

ex: -jo-gwepiag recipr-see

'see each other'

-nho-moakym recipr-wet

'wet each other'

8

Complex Intransitives also consist of a reflexive plus transitive stem.

ex: -ji-kutug refl-pierce

'pierced self'

nhi-moakym refl-wet

'made self wet'

All Verb stems may be followed by a second Verb which functions as an auxiliary.

ex: -ho-potar go-want

'wants to go'

epia-katu see-pretty

'see well'

c. Descriptive. Descriptive stems are either simple or compound.

i. Simple. Simple Descriptives consist of one root and that root can be either Descriptive or Substantive.

ex: d

-katu

'pretty'

s

-hy

'has a mother'

ii. Compound. Compound Descriptives consist of the reduplication of a root or one or more Substantives and Verb root .

ex: -katu-katu

'very pretty'

-py-ka-ne'õ -leg-bone-weak

'tired legs'

2) Verb Constructions. Each of the three verb types may occur in three different constructions. Construction 1 generally occurs in isolation or in a simple independent clause. Constructions 2 and 3 occur within narration.

a. Construction 1. Transitives occur with pronominal set 2 (hereafter referred to as p2).

ex: a-'apo p2-make

'I make'

Intransitives occur with pronominal set 1 (hereafter referred to as p1).

9

ex: a-ho

'I go'

p1-go

Descriptives occur with pronominal set 4 (hereafter referred to as p4).

ex: ji-katu p4-pretty

'I am pretty'

b. Construction 2. Transitives and Intransitives occur with Construction Marker One (hereafter referred to cm1) which is a suffix – the form being -i.

ex: Kiro ore ho-i ko pe. now we go-cm1 field to

'Now we're going to the field.'

Aerẽ po ga i-'u-i. after indef p5 clmi-eat-cm1

'Afterwards he ate.'

In Construction 2 Descriptives occur with Construction Marker Three (hereafter referred to as cm3) which is a suffix – the form being -ro ~ -no ~ -amo (see dictionary entry -amo).

ex: Avo-ite i-katu-ro. here-only c1mi-pretty-cm3

'Only here it is pretty.'

c. Construction 3. Transitives and Intransitives occur with Construction Marker Two (hereafter referred to as cm2) which is a suffix and varies in form according to the preceding vowels or consonants (see dictionary entry -a).

ex: Oro ve po Tandavuhua ihoi tokaja j-apo-vo. and yet indef Tandavuhu go house c1mi-make-cm2 'And Tandavuhu went making a house.'

Intransitives also occur with pronominal set 3.

ex: Oro po hẽa jyvi

o-gwo-vo no.

and indef she descended p3-go-cm2 also

.

'And she descended going.'

3.2. Closed Classes

A. Pronominals. There are six sets of pronominal forms:

10

Set 1 occurs as bound subject of Intransitive Verbs, Construction 1.
Set 2 occurs as bound subject of Transitive Verbs, Construction 1.
Set 3 occurs as (1) bound possessor of Substantives where the possessor is the same person as the subject of the clause, and (2) as bound subject of Intransitive and Descriptive Verbs in Construction type 3.
Set 4 occurs as bound subject of Descriptive Verbs in Construction type 1.
Set 5 occurs as (1) bound possessor of Substantives (a) in subject position and (b) in other positions where the possessor is not the same person as the subject; (2) free subject of Intransitive and Descriptive Verbs in Construction types 1 and 2, as free subject or object of Transitive Verbs in Construction types 1 & 2, and as free object on Transitive Verbs in Construction type 3.
Set 6 occurs whenever the free subject or object is being emphasized.

When ji-, nde-, and nhande- precede nasal roots they have the nasal counterpart nhi-, ne-, and nhane- respectively.

B. Relaters. Relaters (hereafter referred to as rr, or rrh if of the h class) are postpostionals and indicate position, direction, purpose, accompaniment, or instrument. (The term postpositional is used rather than preposition because the Relater follows rather than precedes the axis of the phrase.)

ex: tapyja r-ehe house clmh-on

'on top of the house'

yrua pype basket into

'into the basket'

C. Relationals.

a. A relational is a word (r, or rh if the word is of the h class) with a relational suffix (rsuf). (See examples on p. 9 above.)

b. A clausal relational (cr) is a verbal form or its substitute and a clausal relational suffix (crsuf).

ex: Japo-rẽ ga hoi. make-after he went

'After making it he went.'

ae-rẽ this-after

'after this'

ga ndu-ame they came-when

'when they arrived'

D. Interrogatives. Interrogatives indicate questions: mome 'where?'; marã 'how?'; garamo 'why?'; gara 'what?'; maname 'when?'; maramomi 'how many?' (They are hereafter referred to as q.)

ex: Gara re ko ga-rera? what ? def his-name

'What is his name?'

E. Demonstratives. Demonstratives (hereafter referred to as dem) serve to point out a specific person or thing according to distance.

ex: Kia pe-hepia nhati'gwa imbotea. this you-see mosquito creation 'You see this, the creation of mosquitoes.'

12

F. Adverbs. Adverbs serve to modify the Verb in time, manner, location, comparison, generalizations (hereafter referred to as adv).

ex: Kotihĩ hẽa imondoi a'ero ga pe. quickly her gave then him to

'Quickly she gave it to him then.'

Oro ji ruvi avo. and I live here

'And I live here.'

G. Conjunctions. Conjunctions (hereafter referred to as conj) serve as connectives to link different units in the grammatical structure.

ex: Oro ahe hoi okiavo ipype. and person go enter into

'The person went entering into (it).'

A'i ga gwayvaretete ga.

because they argue

them

'Because they argued with them.'

H. Interjections. Interjections noted in the data include such expressions as denial, affirmation, exclamations, puzzlement. (They are hereafter referred to as interj.)

ex: Iiii! He'yi ga kagwahivamo. Interj many they Indians

'Wow! There are many Indians.'

I. Ideophones. Ideophones are onomatopoeic expressions which indicate the sound of fire (gwou), birds landing (takh), etc. (They are hereafter referred to as ono.)

J. Modals. Modals serve to indicate negation, positive desired action, negative desired action. They occur affixed to Verbs. Negation occurs with Modal 1 (hereafter referred to as m1) having the prefix form of n- ~ na- ~ nd- ~ nda- ~ ne- ~ nde- and Modal 2 (hereafter referred to as m2) having the suffix form of -i (see dictionary entry nd-…-i).

ex: N-a-mano-i. m1-I-die-m2

'I am not dying.'

Positive desired action occurs with Modal 1 having the prefix form of t- ~ ta-, and

te- (see dictionary entry ta-).

ex: T-a-ho.

'I want to go.'

m1-I-go

Negative desired action occurs with Modal 1 having the prefix form of t- ~ ta-, te-, and the Modal 2 having the suffix form of -i for the second person, and the

13

suffix form of -yme for the remaining persons (see dictionary entry ta-).

ex: T-ere-ho-i. m1-you-go-m2

'Don't go.'

T-o-ho-yme

ga.

m1-3rdper-go-m2 he

'It's for him not to go.'

K. Aspect. One or more Aspect markers (hereafter referred to as asp) occur with Substantives, Verbs, Relaters, Demonstratives, Pronominals, and Adverbs which they serve to qualify.

ex: s

hapo-'ia

root-asp

'little root'

v

japo-pa-g+werĩ

-erahiva sh. name of moiety; the name of one's
moiety is determied by the father's moiety; one can also tell to which moiety people belong by looking at the markings on the palms of their hands. These markings were originally caused by the grabbing of pineapple plants by the ones on earth when Pindova'yma'ga took the good earth (including plants) to heaven with him. The two moieties of the Parintintin are mytũa (curassow) and kwandua (hawk). These and the divisions within the kwandua moiety are named after birds. The divisions within the kwandua moiety are as follows: (1) apy'agKwetagKa: taravea (macaw), tukana (toucan), kanindea (macaw), japua (black bird) and japi'ia (black bird); (2) gwyray'gwara (or yvyray'gwara). The Parintintin hold that mytũa could only marry kwandua. If they marry within their own moiety the children are gwyray'gwara because they do not have proper lineage. Those of the opposite moiety are ambotehea. Apy'agKwetagKa (kwandua) and mytũa (curassow) are not to marry gwyray'gwara (but in fact the gwyray'gwara do marry either kwandua or mytũa). Members of the mytũa moiety are also called: nhakupemuhũa, mytunagwera (or mytunigwera); and the divisions of the mytũa moiety are as follows:

jakua (reddish bird with long tail), kwanuranuhũa (hawk), and inamuhu'ndia (tinamou). See: -e'yja. Alt: -hiva. Tenh: = but they claim the markings on people's hands were caused by the grabbing of the palm fronds when Pyreapi'ga took the good earth (including plants) to heaven with him. The two moieties of the Tenharim are mytũa and taravea. The Karipuna, Uru-eu-wau-wau, and Amundava made statements that taravea men married to mytũa women were gwyray'gwara. The Tenharim remarked that the gwyray'gwara were taravea and they were only to marry other gwyray'gwara or mytũa but never a kwandua. They said that the kwandua call the gwyray'gwara lizards (teju). The Tenharim also say that one should not marry within their own moiety but should marry the opposite moiety. The Tenharim remarked that baby kanindea birds take a long time to become strong while the baby mytũa birds become strong right away after hatching out and find their own food and grow quickly. The Tenharim said it was the same with the children of the two moieties. K: = The two moieties of the Karipuna are mytũa and tukana. They listed the divisions of the kwandua moiety as follows: taravea, yvytyryvana, tukana, gwyray'gwara. Am: = The two moieties of the Amundava are mytũa and kanindea. If a man marries a woman of the mytũa moiety his moiety name is gwyray'gwara, his being of the kanindea section of the kwandua moiety. The same is true of the Uru-eu-wau-wau and the Juma. Said gwyray'gwara = garerahiva kaninderamo. Also said kwanduhiva = kanindea and said that the Parintintin don't know when they say the kwanduhiva is the opposite of mytũa. He also said the Parintintin marry wrongly. Uru: = The two moieties of the Uru-eu-wauwau are the same as the Amundava: mytũa and kanindea; and if a man of the kanindea moiety marries a woman of the mytũa moiety his moiety name is gwyray'gwara.
