Wari'
The first major study of any Chapakuran language makes an important contribution to the database of linguistic theory, and is one of the most detailed descriptions ever published of any Amazonian language. This study is especially timely as the Chapakuran languages of Western Brazil and Eastern Bolivia are endangered, and less than 2,000 known speakers of Wari' and its related dialects are left in existence.
The authors offer a unique, comprehensive grammatical description of Wari', covering areas such as syntax, negation, morphology, phonology, ideophone/interjection and lexicon.
This descriptive grammar will appeal to linguistic scholars and students alike. Daniel L.Everett is a specialist on a variety of Amazonian languages and is currently Professor and Chair of the Department of Linguistics, University of Pittsburgh. Barbara Kern, a native of California and missionary linguist belonging to New Tribes Mission, has lived among the Wari' people for nearly 34 years and speaks their language fluently.

Editorial statement
Until quite recently, work on theoretical linguistics and work on language description proceeded almost entirely in isolation from one another. Work on theoretical linguistics, especially in syntax, concentrated primarily on English, and its results were felt to be inapplicable to those interested in describing other languages. Work on describing individual languages was almost deliberately isolationist, with the development of a different framework and terminology for each language or language group, and no feeding of the achievements of language description into linguistic theory. Within the last few years, however, a major rapprochement has taken place between theoretical and descriptive linguistics. In particular, the rise of language typology and the study of language universals have produced a large number of theoreticians who require accurate, well-formulated descriptive data from a wide range of languages, and have shown descriptive linguists that they can both derive benefit from and contribute to the development of linguistic theory. Even within generative syntax, long the bastion of linguistic anglocentrism, there is an increased interest in the relation between syntactic theory and a wide range of language types.
For a really fruitful interaction between theoretical and descriptive linguistics, it is essential that descriptions of different languages should be comparable. The Questionnaire of the present series (originally published as Lingua, vol. 42 (1977), no. 1) provides a framework for the description of a language that is (a) sufficiently comprehensive to cover the major structures of any language that are likely to be of theoretical interest; (b) sufficiently explicit to make cross-language comparisons a feasible undertaking (in particular, through the detailed numbering key); and (c) sufficiently flexible to encompass the range of variety that is found in human language. The volumes that were published in the predecessor to the present series, the Lingua Descriptive Studies (now available from Routledge), succeeded in bridging the gap between theory and description: authors include both theoreticians who are also interested in description and field-workers with an interest in theory.
The aim of the Descriptive Grammars is thus to provide descriptions of a wide range of languages according to the format set out in the Questionnaire. Each language will be covered in a single volume. The first priority of the series is grammars of languages for which detailed descriptions are not at present available. However, the series will also encompass descriptions of better-known languages with the series framework providing more detailed descriptions of such languages than are currently available (as with the monographs on West Greenlandic and Kannada).

Preface
Wari' ‘We!’ (1pincl emphatic pronoun) is the autodenomination of a tribe composed of several subgroups, totalling approximately 1,800 people, who live along various tributaries of the Pacaas Novos river and other affluents of the Mamore river in Western Rondonia, Brazil, along the Bolivian border.1 The people is known most simply by the name of the river, Pacaas Novos, although we shall not use that term here. The dialect described in this grammar is of the 'Oro Nao' clan. We will use Wari' when referring to the entire language or all the subgroups and will use 'Oro Nao' ('ON, lit. ‘the Bats’) when referring to the specific dialect described in this grammar. Other subgroups of the Wari' include 'Oro 'Eo ‘the Burpers’, 'Oro ‘At ‘the Bones’ 'Oro Jowin ‘the Jowin monkeys’, 'Oro Waram ‘the Waram Monkeys’, 'Oro Waram Xijein ‘the other waram monkeys’, 'Oro Mon ‘the Faeces’, and 'Oro Cao' Orowaji ‘the Eaters of Green Things’. Wari' is a member of the Chapakuran (Txapacura) family, which also includes the 'Oro Win (approximately forty speakers; not a dialect of Wari', in spite of its name), located at the headwaters of the Pacaas Novos river, and the More, who live in eastern Bolivia. It is not known how many More speakers there are. There do not appear to be any other languages of this family still living. This grammar is the first detailed analysis of any Chapakuran language.
We realize that our study is incomplete in many respects and we expect to conduct further research to be reported on in future studies. Nevertheless, our goal here is to provide a solid introduction to the major features of 'ON grammar, pointing out where relevant points of particular typological or theoretical interest, although for the most part we have followed the series outline closely and have avoided theoretical discussions.
A word about our joint authorship is in order. We would like to emphasize that this grammar is um trabalho de quatro mãos, i.e. truly a jointly authored study. Our names are listed alphabetically. Each of us has spent time considering every statement and example on every page of this study. In so far as is possible, we agree on the entire content. However, if there are errors remaining, each of us blames the other for not catching them.
On the other hand, DE would like to stress the fact that this grammar was only possible due to BK’s 32 years of fieldwork and data-collection (copious field notes and over 700 pages of text), as well as her fluency in the language. DE himself has only had a few days of actual informant work on the language. In this sense BK is the primary author.
We would like to thank numerous people and organizations for their help in preparing this grammar. We thank the editorial board of the Routledge Grammar Series for inviting us to contribute this study. Without that impetus, we might have given up at points due to the miles separating us. We would also like to thank the New Tribes Mission and the Summer Institute of Linguistics for logistic and financial support at various phases of this study. DE would like to thank the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Latin American Studies, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and Department of Linguistics for

their financial and moral support of his Amazonian research over the last several years (as well as the National Science Foundation for a grant to study Arawan languages, from which he borrowed a few weeks to complete this grammar before heading out to the Banawa' village). We would also like to acknowledge here the pioneering work of all the New Tribes missionaries who as a group have worked with the Wari' since the initial contact in 1957, in particular Royal Taylor, whose collaboration in the study of Wari' contributed much to the analysis of the language, and BK’s husband, Manfred, without whose patience and steadfast support this work would never have become a reality. DE would like to thank also Keren Everett for her support to him during the many weeks of preparing the final version of the manuscript, when he was very poor company and interested in talking about little but Wari'. We would also like to salute the work of various chefes de posto of Brazil’s National Indian Foundation (the FUNAI) for their dedication to the Wari' and other indigenous groups of Brazil. These people are often the unsung heroes of efforts to help the Indians.
Finally, but especially, we want to thank the Wari' themselves for their patient teaching of their language, their warm acceptance and their hospitality. It is our hope that at least part of the richness of this people’s language will emerge in the following pages. We express our deepest hopes and prayers for their continued health and vitality as a people.
1 This autodenomination differs interestingly from subgroup names, such as 'Oro Nao', the name of the subgroup whose dialect we are describing here, in that it lacks the collective word 'oro. However, the Pacaas Novos people rejected our attempts to use the phrase 'Oro Wari' ‘all the people’ as the autodenomination of the entire group, insisting that the correct term was simply Wari'.

An overview of 'Oro Nao' Grammar
0.0. INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this introduction is to highlight certain features of 'Oro Nao' grammar that we believe other linguists should find particularly interesting, just in case they are trying to decide whether or not to read this grammar. It is not meant to serve as a stand-alone introduction to Wari' or 'Oro Nao' but merely to draw attention to features of the grammar covered in detail below.
0.1. PHONOLOGY
0.1.1. Segmental inventory
'Oro Nao' ('ON) has fifteen consonant phonemes and six vowels. This is a relatively large inventory by Lowland Amazonian standards. This inventory is noteworthy for, among other things, its two front rounded vowels /Ø/ and /Y/, and its peculiar voiceless apicodental, bilabial vibrant [ ]. This latter sound is a lexically restricted allophone of /t/ in 'ON, and is only used by speakers over 30. However, in other dialects it seems to be a phoneme, albeit restricted to only a small list of words.
0.1.2. Syllable structure and prosody
'ON has cv and cvc syllables, the coda position of the latter being restricted in the number of consonants which may appear in it. Only /n/ may appear in the coda of cvc in wordmedial position and only four other consonants, i.e. in addition to /n/, may appear in this position word-finally. This produces (15×6×6 =) 540 total possible syllables for all positions of the word, much greater than many Amazonian languages (e.g. Madi (Arawan) with 47–50 possible syllables across dialects and Pirahã (Mura) with 108 possible syllables).
Primary sentence stress appears on the final syllable of the verb (or penultimate syllable if the final syllable is a stress-avoiding verb). There are some interesting vowel harmony processes and stress interactions in the language but, by and large, the phonology is relatively simple formally. In spite of all our work on segmental phonological analysis, however, there are still numerous aspects that we do not yet fully understand. We as yet have no account, for example, as to why /kw/ and /hw/ cannot be followed by rounded vowels. In the light of the fact that k/h+o/u/ov sequences can sometimes be realized as kwv/hwv, we are tempted to analyse [kw] and [hw] as allophones of /k/ and /h/, respectively. Still, though, there are minimal pairs which we would then be unable to explain. Moreover, there are many cases of [kw] and [hw] which would violate

Wari' 2

canonical syllable structures of 'ON if analysed as k/h+rounded vowel. Therefore, we have treated them here as separate consonant phonemes.

0.2. MORPHOLOGY

0.2.1. Word classes
The major word classes and the only open word classes in 'ON are Verb and Noun. Loan words, for example, must enter the language as nouns or verbs (most frequently as verbs), regardless of their word class in the source language. However, there are several minor word classes, including inflectional clitics, subdivisions of nouns and verbs, demonstrative and emphatic pronouns, and a single preposition, all of which we will briefly discuss in this overview.

0.2.2. Nouns
Nouns occur in argument and adjunct positions in the clause and trigger agreement on a preceding preposition or verbal inflectional clitic (VIC). They may also trigger agreement on a nominal inflectional clitic (NIC), following the possessor noun. Nouns trigger agreement for person, number and gender. Since only nouns referring to humans may trigger number agreement, number can be understood as a dependant of the feature [+human]. Genders are feminine (for human females only), masculine (for human males or certain animals, fish and bird species) and neuter (for most plants and inanimate objects). This gives us the values and groups in Table 0.1, according to the grammatical features [human] and [female]:
Table 0.1 Grammatical feature combinations

FEMININE [+HUMAN, +FEMALE]

NONFEMININE
[−FEMALE]=MASCULINE [−HUMAN]=NEUTER

This is an interesting gender distribution, since it does not involve simple conjunctions of values for the feature pair [human] and [female]. Only human females are marked by both features, producing the first division. In the second major division, nonfemale, the features are opposed equipollently rather than privatively. Some nouns in the lexicon will be marked [+ human, + female], others [−human], and still others merely [−female].1 In mixed groups, masculine gender is always overridden:

(a)

masculine+feminine=feminine

(b)

masculine+neuter=neuter

As is seen in the main body of the grammar, neuter and feminine are never mixed, nor are all three genders ever conjoined in a single NP.

An overview of 'oro nao' grammar 3
Thus, Chapacuran is one of the rare language families in the Amazon which manifests grammatical gender distinctions, the other families being Arawan and Arawakan. However, contra Greenberg (1987), these families are not related, at least they share no obvious cognates and the presence of gender is hardly a sufficiently reliable criterion alone to posit any genetic affiliation (see Everett 1996).
Like many languages with rich agreement, in 'ON nouns usually only appear in sentences to signal particular discourse functions and in isolated sentences to avoid ambiguity. Otherwise, it is more common merely to reference participants in a predication via VICS, NICS, or the inflected preposition wherever possible.
(Nonpronominal) nouns are not themselves marked for case, number, person or gender. These features are discernible via agreement and certain verbal modificational forms. There are two broad classes of nouns, -xi' nouns (so-called because their citation form ends in -xi' 1pincl) and non-xi' nouns. Kinship terms form a third (closed), minor class. Both -xi' nouns and kinship terms are inalienably possessed. The non-xi' nouns for the most part all have -xi' forms as well. The non-xi' forms are themselves subdivided into nonpossessable and possessable nouns. Non-xi' forms which may not be possessed (although if they have a -xi' form they may be possessed in that form) are body parts, exclusively. Optionally possessable non-xi' forms can be marked as possessed via NICS. The distinction between -xi' vs non-xi' nouns is also important for the derivational morphology since non-xi' nouns when zero-derived to form verbs usually form attributive, nonactive verbs, whereas verbs zero-derived from -xi' nouns are almost always active.
Although case is not overtly marked on nouns, the verbal inflectional clitic is sensitive to the semantic role that the noun phrase bears in the clause, rigidly observing the following hierarchy for object agreement (subject agreement is always obligatory, regardless of the semantic role of the subject):
(c) GOAL>CIRCUMSTANCE>THEME>BENEFACTIVE>COMITATIVE> LOCATION>TIME
That is, if there is a GOAL in the clause, the object portion of the VIC must agree with it (if there is also a theme, it is usually expressed as the object of the preposition, much as Relational Grammar’s ‘3→2 Advancement’ would predict); if there is a circumstance (but no goal) then it will be referenced on the VIC, and so on down the hierarchy, with remaining roles usually expressed as prepositional objects.
0.2.3. Verbs
The class of verbs is the most productive word class in the language. Most adjectival notions, as well as traditionally verbal meanings, are expressed as verbs. The majority of loan words, regardless of the word class in the source language, enter Wari' as verbs. Verbs may be either transitive, intransitive or ambitransitive, although the last class is quite small. The last class, as one might expect, subdivides those where the intransitive subject corresponds to the transitive object from those where the transitive subject corresponds to the intransitive subject, with the verb for ‘turn over’ representing the first class and the verb for ‘break’ the second class (e.g. ‘I turned over the baby’ vs ‘The baby turned over’; ‘The man broke his arm’ vs ‘The man broke’). Perhaps the most remarkable

Wari' 4
fact about verbs in 'ON is the almost complete absence of verbal inflectional processes alongside a rich set of derivational processes. Nouns, emphatic pronouns and sentences may all form verbs via zero-derivation. Any verb, whether nonderived or derived (including ‘desententialized’ verbs, i.e. verbs derived from sentences), may be compounded to form new verbs or to increase transitivity. Verb compounding never reduces the transitivity of the verb as a whole, which is set by the leftmost member of the compound, which we analyse as the head of the compound.
There are two minor classes of verbs which we have labelled preverbal and postverbal modifiers. These differ from main verbs in two ways, according to our analysis: (i) they may never occur in the predicate outside of a compound; and (ii) some of the preverbal modifiers may also modify nouns, in prehead position within the NP. Verbal compounds are always constructed according to the following template (superscripts indicate number of times a category can reoccur in a single sequence. No superscript means that there is no reoccurrence allowed):
(d) preverbal modifier effect2 postverbal modifier2 initial action/cause result
Each effect/result is produced by the action of the verb (in its compound) to its immediate left, suggesting an iconic principle of compound formation.
Verbs are uninflected by affixation, except for reduplication, which marks aspect. There are various types of reduplication processes. One interesting aspect of reduplication is that an inflectional (INFL) morpheme otherwise expected in a particular clause will sometimes not co-occur with reduplication.
Aside from compounding, zero-derivation and reduplication, verb morphology in 'ON is quite simple. Certainly it is one of the simplest morphological systems in Lowland Amazonia. Nevertheless, this simplicity is deceptive since this language provides perhaps the strongest evidence yet documented on the ability of the syntax to feed wordformation, in violation of certain theoretical proposals and frameworks, such as Lexical Phonology.
Valency-reducing morphology is represented on the VIC, with special forms for active, passive, and reflexive. But since VICS are not part of the verb word, these inflectional processes are actually independent of the verb per se.
0.2.4. Preposition
'ON has a single preposition, obligatorily inflected for person, number and gender of its object. It is required for definite NPS not referenced on the VIC, as per the hierarchy given in (c) above, although it is optional for indefinite NPS, without regard to the semantic role of the NP, subject only to the condition that it only appear with NPS not referenced on the VIC.
0.2.5. Emphatic pronouns
There are emphatic pronouns for all grammatical person, number, and gender combinations. These can only be used as zero-derived verbs, in left-dislocation position, and as arguments of the verb, in which case they must be followed immediately by an appositional noun further specifying their referent (usually a proper noun). First and

An overview of 'oro nao' grammar 5

second person emphatic pronouns may only be used as replies to questions or as exclamations, in left-dislocated position, and in certain kinds of list structures. The first person plural inclusive emphatic pronoun is wari', the autodenomination of the people.
Interestingly, there are no simple personal pronouns in the language. Personal pronoun functions are expressed via demonstratives.

0.2.6. Demonstratives and personal pronouns
First and second persons can only be expressed on VICS, NICS and emphatic pronouns. There are no simple or derived pronominal forms for first or second person. Personal pronouns for third person are derived from demonstratives. The semantic categories encoded in demonstratives are proximity to speaker vs proximity to hearer vs distal, singular+gender, and plural (in which no gender is expressed), as well as a small range of temporal categories as well. These may occur as arguments in NP positions within the clause and they may be used for noncontrastive emphasis or even in apposition to emphatic pronouns.

0.2.7. Verbal and nominal inflectional clitics

0.2.7.1. Nominal inflectional clitics (NICS)
NICS follow possessed non-xi' nouns to indicate person, number and (third person) gender of the possessor, and they may replace VICS in some types of nominalized clauses. We have analysed them as clitics, rather than suffixes, primarily on phonological grounds: (i) they never bear primary stress (which otherwise goes on the last syllable of the noun preceding them); and (ii) they fail to undergo vowel harmony (or trigger it) with the noun to which they attach.

0.2.7.2. Verbal inflectional clitics (VICS)

VICS always express person, number and gender (for third person) of the subject and ‘primary’ object (according to the semantic role hierarchy in (c) above). They also express tense when the verb is clause-initial, except when tense is prohibited by a particular postverbal modifier. The VIC is a (simple) clitic. As with NICS, VICS fail to undergo vowel harmony with the word immediately preceding them, in this case the verb, and they never bear primary stress. Unlike NICS, however, they can appear alone in certain types of question responses and discourse circumstances (which certainly argues against affixal status for them). We analyse each of the two parts of the VIC (subject and object agreements) as affixes, at least prosodically:

(e)

[VIC subject agreement-object agreement]

The two parts of the VIC are stressed as a single word (stress on the last syllable) and vowel harmony may take the entire VIC in its scope, but is otherwise allowed only within words, VICS almost always form a single pause or breath group with the verb. By labelling the VIC as a simple clitic (as per Zwicky 1977; see also Everett 1996), we claim

Wari' 6
that the VIC is in fact a grammatical word, but phonologically dependent, in this case part of the preceding pause or breath group. Although rhythmically it seems to be part of the preceding verb, intonation always falls sharply immediately before the VIC.
VICS may also manifest tense, but only when the VIC is in second position in its clause. This is a result of the fact that tense in 'ON must occur in sentence second position; see below.
0.3. DERIVATIONAL MORPHOLOGY
Typologists and theoreticians should find 'ON derivational morphology quite interesting since sentences and phrases productively serve as input to zero-derivation and compounding. These processes in fact provide interesting evidence for sentence constituent structure. Zero-derivation takes a word, phrase or clause as input and returns a single word as output, with no affixation. When the input is larger than a single grammatical word it may be distinguished from the output prosodically since the output will receive a single primary stress on its rightmost syllable. The stresses on the rightmost syllable of each individual word of the input will surface as secondary stresses in the output. Vowel harmony does not apply across words, even when they have been compounded.
There is a simple argument which shows that the output Cc zero-derivation of a verb from a clause is a single word, viz., tense placement. As we remark later on in this overview and in the main body of the grammar, tense must be the second constituent in the clause when it occurs. But a tense VIC may follow an entire ‘verbalized’ clause, strongly supporting our analysis of these structures as single words, i.e. verbs. Another argument in favour of verbalization of entire clauses is that if they are not verbs they would be the only examples of nonCOMP or nonverb-initial clauses in the language. This result is therefore potentially significant for theories of the lexicon and its interface with the syntax, as well as general typologies of morphological systems.
Nouns can also be zero-derived from various combinations of morphemes, including verbs, INFL+verb pieces, verb+VIC, entire clauses and nominalized clauses, providing additional information on constituent structure.
Compounding is another very interesting and highly productive derivational process in 'ON. In fact, nearly all multimorphemic verbs are derived via compounding (except for zero-derived phrases), with reduplication accounting for the rest. That is, verbs are not formed by simple affixation, nor by incorporation. Nouns occur in verbs only by zeroderivation, often followed by compounding. This is interesting since regardless of the morphemic complexity of 'ON verbs, they never undergo affixation (aside from reduplication). In this sense, 'ON verbal morphology might be considered almost exclusively derivational, since reduplication itself appears largely, if not completely, derivational in its meaning, although this cannot be asserted categorically due to the fact that the output of reduplication semantically is often aspectual. On the other hand, aspectual morphology is not easily classifiable in terms of the derivational-inflectional split. If we consider it inflectional, then it is the only case of inflectional verb morphology. If we consider aspectual change derivational, then 'ON verbs have no inflectional morphology at all, except for suppletive plural/aspectual forms. The only

An overview of 'oro nao' grammar 7

clear cases of inflectional morphology throughout 'ON grammar are then -xi' nouns, the preposition, NICS, and VICS, and possibly the emphatic pronouns (if we consider each of the different emphatic pronominal forms to be derived via suppletive inflection from a single base—a questionable tactic).

0.4. COMP AND INFL

In Everett (1994), considerable space is spent railing against the notion of basic word order. We thus avoid this term here as inaccurate both in its use of ‘basic’, as opposed to pragmatically unmarked or syntactically underlying, and its use of ‘word’, as opposed to constituent. The pragmatically unmarked constituent order in 'ON is vos. We do not here consider underlying constituent order at all, aside from some brief and highly speculative remarks in section 2.2 in the main body of the grammar. There are two basic configurations in which vos can appear, however. The first configuration is what we call ‘simple sentences’, those in which v is the first constituent. These have the shape in (f) (where SFP= sentence-final particle):

(f)

V VIC (NPOBJ1) (PP/NPOBJ2) (NPSUBJ) (SFP)

The VIC in this configuration is almost always tensed. If it is not tensed, then tense may appear nowhere else in the clause.
The other configuration in which vos appears is the COMP (=complementizer) clause, as in (g) (INFL=inflectional morpheme):
(g) COMP INFL V VIC (NPOBJ1) (PP/NPOBJ2) (NPSUBJ) (SFP)

Sentence-final particles express temporal notions and this label should thus be straightforward and uncontroversial for all readers (assuming that they do not mind the term ‘particle’). COMP and INFL, on the other hand, may not be so appealing to a general readership, coming as they do from Government and Binding Theory (GB) (Chomsky 1981,1986). Moreover, INFL itself is an outdated term in GB since at least since Everett (1987), Pollock (1989), and Chomsky (1992) it has been assumed that what was considered to be INFL, the head of an inflectional phrase (IP), should be instead broken into the separate components of AGR (agreement) and T (tense). Nevertheless, we believe that these two labels are useful mnemonic devices and that they serve better than any others, barring detailed theoretical discussion, to express the function and syntax of these morphemes/nodes in 'ON grammar.
INFL expresses tense and realis/irrealis mood and agrees in gender with any material in COMP, whether overt or covert (i.e. merely understood). Thus INFL is not exclusively a tense/mood morpheme nor does it express the expected type of agreement with a major grammatical relation, since it agrees with COMP, not with subject or object. Therefore, we did not feel that it could be adequately labelled by either ‘tense’ or ‘(COMP) agreement’. We thus stick with our label INFL here. Since such a preverbal morpheme/clitic is extremely rare at best, no standard term will work as well as, certainly no better than, INFL in our opinion. Thus readers may interpret our use of these terms as

Wari' 8
either merely a label for a specific 'ON construction or as a GB-related claim about the relationship between 'ON phrase structure to Universal Grammar (UG), as they wish.
Two kinds of information appear in COMP: words which indicate moods other than (ir)realis and question words. These thus correspond neatly to the core function predicted of COMP in GB theory, aside from the fact that only one COMP word, the ‘third person singular neuter’ form of the preposition, pain, serves exclusively to introduce subordinate clauses. (For GB-oriented readers, we analyse the COMP word as occurring in the SPEC of COMP position and INFL as, at the surface only, the head of COMP.)
When a COMP appears, INFL is obligatory and the VICS may not be marked for tense/mood. This is simply accounted for if we assume that tense/mood ((ir)realis mood) must always appear in the second position of the sentence. Agreement between INFL and COMP is also obligatory, an additional reason for INFL to immediately follow COMP in some theoretical frameworks.
The movement or appearance of subject or object in COMP occurs in leftdislocation/clefted sentences, in relative clauses and in wh- (or information) questions. An item may only appear in COMP if it is potentially referenceable on the VIC in the sentence in question (i.e. according to the hierarchy of semantic roles above). Thus a theme cannot be questioned, relativized, or left-dislocated if a goal NP is expressed. A location cannot be moved to COMP if a benefactive is expressed, and so on. Interestingly, however, there is an Anti-agreement Effect observed with fronted objects. The VIC may not agree with an object moved to COMP. Subjects moved to COMP, however, require agreement on the VIC, just as in the nonmoved case.
1 Note that we are using these as grammatical features only. If we were using these as ‘real world’ semantic values, the results would come out wrong, since many nonhuman items in the real world may be masculine. The three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter, are simply our labels for these feature combinations.

1.1. GENERAL QUESTIONS

1.1.1. Sentence types
A complete discussion of the three major 'ON sentence types can be found in 1.1.1.4. The three general classifications are simple, COMP and verbalized (direct speech type) sentences. A general discussion of direct and indirect speech sentence types, interrogatives and imperatives, however, follows in sections 1.1.1.1, 1.1.1.2 and 1.1.1.3. In this section we distinguish sentences based on a combination of functional and formal criteria. It is not our claim that the types we identify could not be reduced (or expanded), merely that distinguishing them here gives the reader the clearest view of how different communicative functions are accomplished via different forms.

1.1.1.1. Direct and indirect speech sentence types

Direct speech forms are common in 'ON narrative, although they are not always glossed as literal direct speech. See 1.1.1.4.3 for a discussion of verbalized sentences, and 1.1.1.4.3.2.1 for the description of the structure of verbalized direct speech sentences.
There is no indirect speech type in the language, though the concept can be expressed in a direct speech present or past tense construction, in which the verbal inflectional clitic of the matrix clause must be either plural realis past/present or plural passive, as in (1a) and (2a) respectively. In the case of the latter, the subject of the embedded speech is coreferential with the object of the matrix clause, and the subject of the matrix clause must be third person plural, marked only by the VIC, not by a free-form nominal. When such is not the case, the construction is considered a literal direct speech. The examples in (1b) and (2b) are only acceptable if they are interpreted as direct speech. An indirect speech interpretation would not be allowed. The embedded speech in the examples below is italicized.

(1) a. Mi'

pin

na

nonon

nana-on

Jimon.

give

3s:rp/p

‘They say (that) Jimon died.’ (lit. ‘“He died”, they (say) of Jimon.’)

(1) b. *Mi'

‘“He died”, you (say) of Jimon?’ (not ‘Did you say (that) Jimon died?’)

(2) a. Mama'

nana

tata.

go:p

3p:rp/p

pass:3p

‘It is said of them (that) they went.’ (lit. ‘“They went”, it is (said) of them.’)

(2) b. *Mama'

nana

nunuhu'. nana-hu'

go:p

3p:rp/p

3p:rp/p-2p

‘“They went”, they (say) of you.’ (not ‘They say (that) you went’.)

This use of the direct speech sentence type to report indirect speech is not available with future tense. In the past/present direct speech type constructions illustrated in (1) and (2), the subject of the embedded speech must be coreferential with the object of an active matrix clause or the subject of a passive clause. In future tense constructions, however, the subject of the embedded speech must be coreferential with the subject of the matrix clause. The ungrammatical example in (3b) is wrong for two reasons: (i) as a future tense construction (see 1.1.1.4.3.2.2), the subject marked in the embedded clause should be coreferential with the subject of the matrix clause (in the example, it is coreferential with the object); and (ii) as a so-called indirect speech type, the subject marked in the matrix clause should be third person (in the example, it is first person). (We gloss carawa as ‘animal’ throughout, because animal is more central to its meaning; but it can also mean ‘thing’.)

‘Minain will go hunting.’ (lit. ‘“I will kill an animal”, Minain (says)’.)

(3) b. *Pa'

‘I said Minain will go hunting.’ (lit. ‘“I will kill an animal”, I (say) of Minain.’)

1.1.1.2. Interrogative sentences
Interrogative sentences in 'ON belong to two separate classes: simple and COMP sentences. See 1.1.1.4.2 for a complete discussion of interrogative sentences and their relation to declarative sentences. The basic structure of simple yes-no and leading questions is described in 1.1.1.2.1–2, and the basic structure of COMP question-word questions is described in 1.1.1.4.2.
There is only one basic intonation pattern in the language: rising pitch through the verb, reaching high on the last syllable of the verb, and falling sharply on the next syllable (VIC or postverbal modifier that does not carry stress); it then holds through any optional arguments until the end of the sentence, or until a demonstrative or sentencefinal particle, in which case it rises on the last syllable of the argument preceding the

Syntax 11

demonstrative or particle and falls sharply on the demonstrative or particle (see 3.3.4). In normal speech, the succeeding high pitch is lower than the first high pitch. When there is emphasis, however, on an argument following the first high pitch, the pitch on the emphasized argument is higher than the first high pitch—see 3.3.4.1–2 and 1.11.2.1.1. Interrogative and declarative intonation patterns are basically the same, differing only in the fact that the pitches of intonation are higher in interrogatives than in declaratives.
(4) a.

scatter:p

go:p

3s:rp/p

pig

‘Did the pigs scatter?’

(4) b.

(4) c. (4) d.

scatter:p

go:p

‘Did those pigs scatter?’

kill

2p:rp/p

‘Did you kill fish?

3s:rp/p

that

fish

kill 2p:rp/p

fish

‘Did you kill fish, children?’

that:prox:hearer

ref children

The sentence boundary falls between quem and hwijima', and we consider hwijima' to be an appositional vocative, thus outside the scope of sentence intonation. It receives a default level intonation.
(5)

kill 2p:rp/p

fish

‘Did you kill fish, children?’

that:prox:hearer

ref children

(4d) and (5) differ intonationally, because in (5), it is hwam rather than pa' that is emphasized, so hwam gets higher intonation.

1.1.1.2.1. Yes-no questions
Simple yes-no interrogative sentences are similar to simple declarative sentences (see 1.1.1.4.1.) in their basic structure: both use any of the three subtypes of Tense or reflexive verbal inflectional clitics. Interrogative intonation, however, distinguishes yes-no interrogatives from declarative sentences.

Wari' 12

The sentence-final particle quem is frequently used in yes-no questions. It refers to something already mentioned or implied.

(6) Pa'

ma

hwam

ma'

quem?

kill 2s:rp/p

fish

that:prox:hearer

ref

‘Did you kill fish?’

1.1.1.2.1.1. Neutral questions Yes-no questions are understood to be neutral questions, expecting either an affirmative or negative answer, unless marked by the special ‘rhetorical’ uses of VICS. See next section.
1.1.1.2.1.2. Leading questions Yes-no questions are often expressed in the form of leading questions using ra ‘2s:rf’, ron ‘2s:rf-3sm’, ram ‘2s:rf-3sf’, roron ‘2s:rf-3pm’, raram ‘2s:rf-3pf’, or rain ‘2s:rf-3n’. In addition, yes-no questions may also be expressed in the form of leading questions using xin (1pincl:rf-3n) in conjunction with the sentencefinal particles ne ‘rec. past’ and/or pane ‘rem:past’, with either declarative or interrogative intonation. A final type of leading question uses na' nam ‘3s:rp/p 3s:rp/p3sf’ (addressing a mixed or feminine audience) and na' non ‘3s:rp/p 3s:rp/p-3sm’ (addressing a masculine audience).
Ra (ron ‘2s:rf-3sm’, ram ‘2s:rf-3sf’, roron ‘2s:rf-3pm’, raram ‘2s:rf-3pf’, rain ‘2s:rf3n’) can be used in two different ways: (i) when used in an affirmative sentence with interrogative intonation, it demands a negative answer; when used in a negative sentence with interrogative intonation, it demands an affirmative answer; and (ii) when used with declarative intonation, it demands agreement. We have italicized the leading question particles and their glosses in the following examples.

When the action of the verb is in the first or second person, ra is always used. When the action is in the third person, either ra or its variations are used. The gender of the noun to which the object suffix on the VIC refers (either stated or implied) determines which will be used. The ra form only occurs in the sentence-final position. When one of the variations is used, it either occurs sentence-final, or, if there is an expressed subject of the sentence, it precedes it. In the latter case, it always reflects the gender of the subject.

See 1.11.1.1, where ra is used to express noncontradictory sentence emphasis. Xin is the first person plural inclusive realis future VIC suffixed by the third person
neuter object VIC. It may also be used idiomatically as a leading question particle, which reveals a measure of curiosity or amazement on the part of the speaker and expects an affirmative answer. It is often accompanied by the temporal particles ne ‘recent past’ or pane ‘remote past’, and more rarely the referent particle quem, or the emphatic particle ta. Ne is the most common particle to occur with xin. It occurs sentence-finally and seems to have the following functions in many environments: it modifies the verb in some subordinate sentences (see time clauses—1.1.2.4.2.1; and contraexpective clauses— 1.1.2.4.2.8); it is a type of ‘attention-getter’, drawing attention to a spoken or unspoken situation (i.e. ‘I’m expecting a response from you’); it expresses uncertainty; and as one of a set of temporal particles, it means ‘recent/ immediate past’. When occurring with xin, it seems to function as an ‘attention-getter’. No doubt its meaning of uncertainty or recent/ immediate past also plays a role here, and since another temporal particle, pane ‘rem:past’ also appears with xin, we will gloss ne as a temporal particle in leading questions.

Na' nam/na' non demands agreement from the hearer. When the response is voiced, it is usually 'e'e' ‘yes’. Na' nam/na' non usually occurs after a declarative statement, but it can also precede it. It can also stand quite free of any other statement, though usually in mid discourse, so that it is loosely connected to either the preceding or following statement. In narrative discourse, it often introduces a parenthetical explanation or diversion. Na' nam is used when addressing a female or mixed audience; na' non is used when addressing a strictly male audience. (The example in (12a) is a minor sentence type—see 1.15.)

1.1.1.2.2. Question-word questions
Question-word questions take the form of COMP sentences. The question word always occurs sentence-initially as the operator word in COMP. See 1.1.1.4.2, where we discuss the functions that operator words signal, the basic structure of COMP sentences, and the ways various concepts of question words are expressed.
1.1.1.2.2.1. Elements of the sentence that can be questioned
1.1.1.2.2.1.1. Constituents of the main clause that can be questioned: Although most ‘ON sentences consist of only the VP (verb, with possible pre- and/or postverbal modifiers, and the VIC), the occurrence of one argument (expressed subject, object, indirect object,

Syntax 17

locative, instrumental, or temporal phrase) is common. Two or more arguments may also occur, though rarely. It is, however, possible to construct a (rather unnatural) sentence with up to four phrases in addition to the verb, as seen in the examples in (14) below:

(14) a. Pa' to

Any constituent of the main clause can be questioned, as in the examples in (15) below:

‘What did the men (do)?’

caca mon tarama'?

3pm coll

man

In the example in (15b), the direct object is missing from its normal position, and instead we have in sentence-initial position the string ma' carawa, which signals that the direct object is being questioned. The INFL is neuter because the questioner is assuming a neuter direct object.

‘What thing/animal did the men kill?’

In (15c), the subject is missing from its normal position, and in its place is ma' and a masculine/feminine INFL, indicating that a masculine/ feminine subject is assumed. Also, nana, a Tense VIC, is used, because it is questioning the subject. As (15b) shows, if we were questioning the object, a Tenseless VIC would be used following the verb.

In (15d), the indirect object is missing; instead we find the question word ma', followed by the masculine/feminine INFL, in sentence-initial position. Following the verb, the Tenseless VIC is used, indicating that an object is being questioned, not the subject.

1.1.1.2.2.1.2. Constituents of subordinate clauses that can be questioned: Subordinate clause constituents cannot be questioned. In what follows, we illustrate the way information from the various types of subordinate clauses can be questioned. But none of these involves actual question-word formation. We have already seen that question words may not remain in situ but that they must appear sentence-initial, i.e. in the COMP position. If we assume that question words must appear in the matrix COMP but that movement out of subordinate clauses is prohibited, we derive the fact that subordinate clause constituents cannot be questioned. Let us now turn to consider how information from subordinate clauses can be questioned.
We begin first with verbalized or direct speech sentences.

(i) Verbalized (direct speech type) sentences Direct objects, indirect objects and subjects of verbalized (direct speech type) sentences (supposition, direct speech and future tense), such as those found in (16), (17) and (18) may be inquired about, as shown in (16) to (18). If the matrix clause is expressed, then only the entire purpose clause may be questioned, as in (19).

This strategy can also be used to question subordinate clause constituents in examples such as (19) to (21). For example, consider (19a), repeated below as (24a):

‘They went to Guajará to buy food.’ (lit. ‘They went to Guajará. “So that we (say), ‘We will buy food’”, they (said).’)

1.1.1.2.2.1.3. Constituents of a noun phrase that can be questioned: The possessor or the entire NP may be questioned. When the possessor is questioned, the head of the NP must appear in the question-word position and the possessor cannot be expressed. If the NP contains a modifier, it cannot appear in the question-word position. Although it need not be expressed, if a demonstrative is expressed, it must appear in its original position and may not be moved. Note the ungrammatical examples in (25) and (26).

that express coordination cannot be questioned; only the individual clauses or words of these juxtaposed structures can be questioned. The questions may be juxtaposed, thus preserving the notion of coordination expressed in this manner.

1.1.1.2.2.2. Position of the questioned element The questioned element is always placed in sentence-initial position. This is illustrated in all the examples that have been given, from (14) to (33). The only instance of clefting occurs when constituents of a NP are questioned. The head must be moved to sentence-initial position when the possessor is questioned, but the demonstrative must remain in place if expressed. See 1.1.1.2.2.1.3, (25) and (26) for grammatical and ungrammatical examples.

1.1.1.2.3. Echo questions

1.1.1.2.3.1. Yes-no echo questions Polite conversation makes use of frequent yes-no echo questions. The verb is obligatory in the response to these questions, but repetition of other elements is optional.

1.1.1.2.3.2. Question-word echo questions Question-word echo questions do not occur in the language (again, this is because question words can only appear in sentence-initial position). The closest equivalent to a question-word echo question is illustrated in (36) and (37), where the question word occurs, together with a complement, as the only element in the ‘echo’. It is not a valid question-word echo question, however, because the question word must precede the complement. Note the ungrammatical examples, which show that the ‘echo question’ word cannot occur in the echo position. The ‘echo responses’ in (36b) and (37b) can be completed to form normal question-word questions, as illustrated in (36c) and (37c)

1.1.1.2.3.8. Echo responses Echo responses are common, whether the speaker is involved in a monologue or a dialogue. The response usually consists of a more-or-less complete echo of the speaker’s previous sentence, or just the verbal element, with appropriate changes in the verbal inflectional clitics. However the response is worded, it often ends with some kind of emphatic element, such as the sentence-final particles in (40b), or the dubitative particle with Tenseless VIC and demonstrative in (41b). This indicates the hearer’s empathy with what the speaker is saying.

1.1.1.2.4. Answers

1.1.1.2.4.1. Answers marked as a distinct speech act The only special marking of answers not found with other speech acts is the optional use of response particles before them.
1.1.1.2.4.2. Answers in the form of incomplete sentences The affirmative answer to yes-no questions is frequently given by the response particle 'e'e' ‘yes’. It may occur alone, or it may be followed by a declarative sentence.

An uncertain answer to yes-no questions is given by the third person singular realis future clitic, tara. Loosely translated, it means ‘I don’t know’ or ‘Who knows?’ More literally, it means ‘(Somebody) probably (knows)’ or ‘(It) probably (depends).’ It frequently occurs followed by an inflected form of the preposition, for example, tara con (3s:rf prep:3sm) which could be translated as ‘I don’t know about him’, or ‘that depends on him’. Tara alone or with an inflected form of the preposition may also be followed by the particle ta'a, which intensifies the meaning of doubt on the part of the speaker.

There is another uncertainty response, na ne, which is the third person singular realis past/present VIC plus the recent past-uncertainty particle. This response is often given in answer to question-word questions consisting of je in COMP and xi ‘irrealis’ in INFL. Je xi questions, because of their irrealis tense/mood character, can be interpreted as mild imperatives (see 1.1.1.3.3, where we describe this and other irrealis constructions appearing as mild imperatives). Na ne, as a response to such questions/ imperatives, expresses the notion of ‘I wish you hadn’t asked’ or ‘I wish you hadn’t said that’, an idiomatic but frequent reading of na ne.

See 1.15, where other VIC responses function as a kind of minor sentence type.

1.1.1.3. Imperative sentences
Normal imperative sentences are marked by the use of the realis future tense/mood. There are also emphatic final particles which typically occur in imperative sentences, though their use is not limited to imperatives.

1.1.1.3.1. (Positive) imperative
There is no difference in the basic structure of (positive) imperative and simple declarative sentences. They constitute a single sentence type formally: neither have an operator word in COMP, both have simple verb structures, and both employ Tense

Wari' 34

VICS—see 1.1.1.4. Their one distinguishing characteristic is the use of the second person realis future VIC in imperatives.
The emphatic morphemes 'e' ‘motion away from the speaker’ and me ‘motion toward the speaker’ are used frequently with imperatives. 'E' intensifies the imperative; me is used when the action is for the benefit of the speaker. Their distribution is complementary. They occur optionally at the end of the sentence.
Two other emphatic particles optionally occur with imperative sentences: wira (spoken by men) and cama (spoken by women). These morphemes simply intensify the action of the verb. They do not usually occur with 'e' and me, but when they do, they follow them at the end of the sentence.
The emphatic particle ta also occurs optionally at the end of imperative sentences. It immediately follows 'e'. (We have not registered me ta in imperatives, though it is very common in prohibitives.) It is also optionally followed by wira or cama.

Syntax 35

In contrast to (positive) imperative sentences, which are of the 'ON simple sentence type, prohibitive sentences are similar in basic structure to COMP sentence types, which, among others, include question-word questions, conditional, negative and purpose sentences. They differ from most COMP sentences in that no operator word occurs in COMP (see 2.1.8.2.5). The realis future INFL morpheme occurs sentence-initially and the emphatic morpheme me usually occurs at the end of the sentence. The occurrence of me and other sentence-final particles are, however, optional.

1.1.1.3.3. Other means of expressing imperative

The only true imperative forms in the language are those that have just been described in the preceding sections. There are, however, three ways to express a kind of mild imperative via indirect speech acts, where assertions are used as indirect directives:
(i) The irrealis tense/mood often appears as a mild imperative This may be either in simple sentences (51a, 51b), or COMP interrogative sentences using the operator word je in COMP and the irrealis INFL morpheme xi in INFL (51c).

‘So that’s why you should have killed it.’

(ii) The use of the postverbal modifier mao ‘negative’ This also expresses mild imperative in an indirect directive. It is used with Tenseless
VICS and, when carrying an imperative meaning, can only be used with the second person clitics.

‘Turn up the light a little.’ (lit. ‘You are not doing forcing the light.’)

(iii) The realis past/present VICS These also express mild imperative when used in a sentence that follows a realis future
type imperative. The ‘mildness’ of this imperative is reflected in the literal translation of the form. The preverbal modifier wara ‘already’ usually occurs in this mild imperative.

A hortatory construction can also be used to reduce illocutionary force. This is formed by a contraction of mama' ‘go:p’ and the first person plural inclusive realis future VIC, xi', maji. This hortatory construction is the only contraction of verb and VIC in the language.

1.1.1.3.4. Responses to imperatives

There are two verbal responses to positive imperatives: ma is spoken only by men; ma'e is spoken only by women. They mean roughly ‘all right’ or ‘okay’. Negative responses are expressed via semantically appropriate negative constructions, as shown in (55c) and (56c).

1.1.1.4. 'Oro Nao' sentence types
All major 'ON sentence types can be classified into three general types: simple, COMP, and verbalized (direct speech type) sentences. Declarative and interrogative intonation can be used with any of the three sentence types—see 3.3.4.1–2.

1.1.1.4.1. Simple sentences

Simple sentences include declarative, imperative, and yes-no interrogative sentences. They are distinguished from COMP and verbalized sentences by the following criteria:

1 No operator word occurs in COMP. 2 They have a simple verb structure, i.e. the verb is optionally preceded and/or followed
by a verbal modifier, and the verb/modifier compound is then followed by one verbal inflectional clitic. 3 Tense VICS usually follow the verb. This is due to the fact that tense itself (with one exception) only appears once in the clause, in second position; see 2.1.8.2.5 and the discussion preceding the examples in (64) below.

As we have said, Tense VICS usually accompany the verb in simple sentences. However, the use of a small class of verbal modifiers ('a/'ara ‘negative’, mao' ‘negative’, para ‘therefore’), one nonderived verb (win ‘to be the same’), another verb zero-derived from a demonstrative (cain' ‘to be that (n.distal)’), and one type of sentence-final emphatic particle (Ca'/ ma'/ne/pane 'ira and ca'/ma'/ne/pane quira) ‘emphatic particles’) requires instead the use of Tenseless VICS (with no INFL morpheme), as shown in the sets of examples in (58) to (63) below:
(1) 'A/'ara and mao ‘negative’ Note that the use of the double negative in example (58d) expresses a strong positive.

1.1.1.4.2. COMP sentences
COMP sentences are distinguished from simple and verbalized sentences by the following criteria:
1 They have an overt expression in their sentence-initial position, or COMP, what we will refer to as ‘operator words’ or ‘COMP words’.
2 An INFL morpheme usually follows the operator word. This is because Tense must appear in second position of the sentence (with few exceptions, to be noted in the course of our discussion)—see 2.1.8.2.5.
3 Tenseless VICS usually follow the verb in the VP (there are exceptions to this, noted in the paragraph preceding (64) and the paragraph following (73)).
By ‘operator word’, we mean a word which sets the value of a particular logical connective for the entire sentence, or which is interpreted logically as binding a variable in the sentence. By ‘INFL’, we mean a preverbal word which gives information about tense, mood and in some cases gender. That operator words are separate syntactic words, and not prefixes, can be shown in information questions, where questioned NPS can be placed between the operator word and INFL. Also, some operator words form compounds with different nouns or demonstratives in preverbal positions, as shown in some of the examples which follow ((68a), (73e–f), (74c), (82c–e)). This is also not expected if these are prefixes. We analyse INFL as a separate morpheme, because the language otherwise lacks prefixes, although nothing crucial for our descriptive task here hinges on this.
There are ten COMP words in 'ON that appear in matrix or embedded clauses, and one, pain, that serves exclusively to introduce subordinate clauses. Some of these COMP words also interact with certain pre-/post-verbal modifiers and verbs in order to express different types of interrogation. These COMP words select for specific INFL morphemes to accompany them, as discussed below. COMP words occur elsewhere in the language in different word classes, as shown in Table 1.1, where we list each COMP word with its basic meaning as well as the function it signals as a COMP word—see also 2.2.2.3. ‘Interrogation’ means question-word interrogation.
Three operator words (mo, 'ac, and 'ane) can occur only with declarative intonation; four (mon, mam, main and cain') can occur only with interrogative intonation (see, however, 1.2.1.1, where mon, mam and main also appear with declarative intonation in copular-type sentences); and four ma', 'om, je and pain) can occur with either declarative or interrogative intonation. Table 1.2 illustrates this. When ma' occurs with interrogative intonation, it asks a question-word question; when 'om and pain occur with interrogative intonation, they ask a yes-no question; when je occurs

with interrogative intonation, the implication is a ‘why?’ or ‘why not?’ question, but the speaker does not normally expect other than a yes or no answer.
There are five INFL morphemes in 'ON. They appear in INFL following COMP in COMP sentences: ca ‘neuter realis past/present’, co ‘masculine/ feminine realis past/present’, ‘iri’ ‘realis past/present’, ta ‘realis future’, and xi ‘irrealis’. Since INFL morphemes express tense/mood in COMP sentences (and elsewhere, in noun and relative clauses), they may not co-occur with a Tense VIC, except as mentioned in the following paragraph. See also 1.1.2.2 and 1.1.2.3 below. INFL morphemes indicate the gender of the (overt or covert) word or phrase in COMP.
While Tenseless VICS are usually the only VICS which appear in COMP sentences, the Tense third person realis past/present VICS must occur when a masculine/feminine subject is referenced in COMP (whether overt or covert; this does not necessarily hold for relative clauses—see the discussion on relative clauses in 1.1.2.3, where it is shown that in some cases, no VIC follows the verb. See also (64d) below). So, for example, a Tense VIC is required when questioning a masculine/feminine subject, which always involves

Syntax 43

an overt COMP word (64a–b), or when relativizing the masculine/feminine subject, which always involves a covert COMP (64c–d).

In all other circumstances, only Tenseless VICS appear in COMP sentences. The examples in (65–71) show nonsubjects, or in the case of (68), a neuter subject, being questioned or referenced in COMP, illustrating the fact that Tenseless VICS must be used. Note the ungrammatical examples in the pairs of examples below, where a Tense, rather than Tenseless, VIC appears.

As can be seen in the examples above, object VICS are not permitted when the object is questioned in COMP sentences. In fact, whenever an object NP is moved to the front of the sentence, it may not be referenced on the VIC. However, subject VICS are always required in COMP sentences. (The only exception we have noticed is Ma' xi mo cwa' ne? ‘Who will run?’ There is no Tense VIC in this example, and we have no other account except to note that we believe it is an idiomatic construction.)

We now describe the use of each operator word, the INFL morpheme(s) which it selects, and its meanings. The first example following the introduction of each operator word illustrates the operator word in what we consider to be its basic function. The subsequent examples illustrate its functions in COMP.
(1) Ma' ‘that proximate to hearer’ When ma' is followed by the INFL morpheme ca ‘neuter realis past/ present’, it signals interrogation and expresses the notion of ‘what?’, ‘why?’ or ‘how?’ Since the questioned element is nonsubject, Tenseless VICS follow the verb. When ma' expresses the notion of ‘why?’, it frequently employs the use of the preverbal modifier para ‘therefore’ and/or the verb mi' ‘give’ occurring in postverbal modifier position. Both of these verbal modifiers are optional, but one or the other is usually used in ‘why?’ questions. The three sentences in (73b–d) are synonymous and have the same distribution, so far as we can tell. Note the examples in (73e–f), where a noun follows ma' to form a COMP phrase and asks specifically ‘What thing do you want?’ and ‘What day will the chief come?’ (73a) shows ma' appearing in its nonderived form as a demonstrative.

When ma' is followed by the INFL morpheme co ‘masculine/feminine realis past/present’, it expresses the notion of ‘who?’ or ‘whom?’ When the questioned element is masculine or feminine subject, only Tense third person realis past/present VICS can follow the verb (74a); when the questioned element is nonsubject, only Tenseless VICS can be used (first, second, or third person) (74b). Note the COMP phrase in (74c), asking specifically ‘What person went?’

When ma' is followed by the INFL morpheme ta ‘realis future’, it signals declaration, declarative intonation is used, and it expresses the notion of purpose. Since the element referenced in COMP is nonsubject, Tenseless VICS follow the verb. See 1.1.2.4.2.3 where we discuss purpose clauses in detail.

(5) cain' ‘that neuter distal’ Cain' signals interrogation. It expresses the notion of ‘what?’ (as applied to a
proposition, e.g. the content of an utterance or thought), ‘when?’, ‘how?’, ‘how many?’ and ‘how long?’ Either of the INFL morphemes ca ‘neuter realis past present’ or xi ‘irrealis’ may be used, and since the questioned element is nonsubject, Tenseless VICS are used. When cain' expresses the notion of ‘how?’, it frequently employs the use of the verb 'ac ‘to travel’, occurring in postverbal modifier position (78d). When it expresses the notion of ‘how many?’ or ‘how long?’, it employs the use of the verb ma' ‘to exist’ (78f–i). See 2.2.5, where we discuss the derivational process by which cain' is derived from the demonstrative cain. See also the examples in (62), where cain' occurs as the verb in a simple sentence.

(6) 'om ‘to not exist’ When ‘om is followed by an INFL morpheme, it signals negation. It may be used with
declarative or interrogative intonation, in which case it asks a yes-no question. Either of the INFL morphemes ca ‘neuter realis past present’, ta ‘realis future’, or xi ‘irrealis’ may be used, and since the element referenced in COMP is nonsubject, Tenseless VICS are used. See 1.4, where negation is described in detail. (79a) shows 'om appearing as a verb.

(7) 'ac ‘like’ When 'ac is in COMP, it must be followed by the INFL morpheme ca ‘neuter realis
past/present’, it signals resemblance between two objects, and must always have declarative intonation. Since 'ac references a nonsubject element, only Tenseless VICS

Syntax 51

may be used following the verb. An 'ac sentence is always embedded in a verbalized sentence—see 1.1.1.4.3.3.6, where we describe verbalized comparative sentences in detail. (80a) shows 'ac appearing as the leftmost member of a compound verb in what we consider to be its basic use. Note that in (80a), unlike the examples which follow, a Tense VIC follows the verb, there is no INFL, and the sentence is not embedded. Therefore we analyse this 'ac as a verb rather than a COMP word.

(8) mo ‘conditional’ The morpheme mo ‘conditional’ may be derived from mo ‘list presentation’. An
example of the latter is found in (81a). When mo appears in COMP, followed by an INFL morpheme, it signals condition and must always have declarative intonation. It expresses the notion of ‘if’. Either of the INFL morphemes ta ‘realis future’ or xi ‘irrealis’ may be used, and since mo does not reference the subject, Tenseless VICS are used. See 1.1.2.4.2.5, where we discuss condition sentences in detail, and 1.1.1.4.3.3.1, where we discuss condition sentences appearing in a verbalized sentence.

(9) je ‘third person neuter emphatic pronoun’ When je appears in COMP position, it may be used to express affirmation or
interrogation. When je is followed by the INFL morpheme ca ‘neuter realis past present’ or ta ‘realis future’, it has declarative intonation and signals affirmation. When followed by the INFL morpheme xi ‘irrealis’, it has interrogative intonation and is used to elicit an agreement from the hearer. Since je does not reference the subject, it may only co-occur with Tenseless VICS (as in (82b–e) below). When it is followed by ta or xi, it often employs the use of the postverbal modifier qui' ‘coming this way’. Note the examples in (82c–e), where a demonstrative pronoun follows je in COMP to form a COMP phrase; note also the examples in (82g–h), where the gloss of the irrealis constructions is affirmation (i.e. ‘So you should have talked to me’ and ‘He should not have gone’), but the implication is that the speaker is asking the hearer for agreement. (82a) shows je appearing in its nonderived form as an emphatic pronoun. As with all other cases above, this illustrates what we consider to be its basic use. See also 1.11.2.1.3, on pseudoclefts and other emphatic pronouns in COMP.

We have one example in our corpus of the INFL morpheme deleting when je 'i ma' occurs in COMP. BK also thinks she has heard other examples like this. This phenomenon may have nothing to do with je 'i ma'; there are other instances of INFL deleting when the verb is reduplicated—see discussion and examples in 2.2.4.1.2. (83a) seems to be an idiomatic way of saying (83b). They are synonymous.

(10) 'ane ‘to be different’ 'Ane signals contraexpectation and must always have declarative intonation. It is not
followed by an INFL morpheme when the VP is headed by a nonderived verb. It is followed by the INFL morpheme ca ‘neuter realis past/present’ when the VP is headed by a verbalized noun. The sentence-final particle ne ‘recent past’ must always occur. (85a) shows 'ane appearing as a verb, which we consider to be its basic use. (85b–c) illustrate the use of 'ane as a COMP word, where it means ‘but’ or ‘because’. See 1.1.2.4.2.8, where we discuss contraexpectives in detail.

There is one use of pain that could be said to be used on a superordinate clause level, in which it means ‘long ago’. Although the surface structure looks like a regular COMP sentence, we question, however, whether it could really be described as such. In order to express the notion of ‘long ago’, exaggerated emphasis must be applied to pain.

1.1.1.4.3. Verbalized sentences
1.1.1.4.3.1. Introduction By ‘verbalized sentences’, we mean to refer to those sentences in which the predicate is manifested by one of the derived predicate types described in this section. Strictly speaking, of course, the verbalized sentence is only the derived predicate itself. However, due to the range of functions peculiar to this construction type, we will refer to the construction as a whole as a ‘verbalized sentence’, and hope that this does not cause undue confusion for the reader. The derived predicate of verbalized sentences can often be interpreted as an embedded speech, but not always. Verbalized sentences fall into two groups. The first group includes direct speech, future tense constructions, supposition, and purpose sentences. The distinguishing characteristic of this group is that their derived predicates have the form of a quotation. The second group includes conditional, desiderative, refusal, sequential and comparative sentences. These differ from the first group in that either the embedded portion would not be a well-formed sentence on its own, or the form of the construction as a whole is not that of a quotative sentence.
Verbalized sentences have one common denominator: the derived predicate is a sentence that has been verbalized, that is, the entire embedded clause is treated phonologically and morphosyntactically as a single verb. This verbalization of the embedded clause is manifested by the following syntactic and phonological changes:
(a) The embedded clause occurs in the verb position of the matrix clause. (b) The embedded verbalized sentence may undergo modification, inflection and
compounding just like any other verb.

Wari' 56

(c) Only the last syllable of the embedded sentence carries primary stress, just as the last syllable of a verb compound carries primary stress. (This would violate the normal stress rule that places primary stress on the final syllable of each word, were it not for the fact that the embedded sentence is now a single verb.)
The matrix clause of verbalized sentences is not marked in any special way. In general, any of the Tense or Tenseless verbal inflectional clitics may be used. Restrictions on their use, as well as the basic structure of each verbalized sentence type, are described below.
1.1.1.4.3.2. Group I verbalized sentences The derived predicate of Group I verbalized sentences is interpretable as a quotation. The derived predicates are italicized in the examples in this section.
1.1.1.4.3.2.1. Verbalized direct speech sentences: The verbal element of direct speech sentences consists of the embedded sentence. The constituent order of the matrix clause is:
0 speech verb+Tense VIC

which marks the addressee and speaker as the object and subject of the sentence. The order of the arguments and adjuncts of the matrix clause is the same as that of simple and COMP sentences.

See 1.1.1.1 for a discussion of the direct speech type and its use to express the concept of indirect speech.
1.1.1.4.3.2.2. Verbalized future tense constructions: The constituent order of the derived predicate of verbalized future tense constructions is:
v+1s/1pincl rf VIC+opt o/adjunct
The constituent order of the matrix clause of these sentences is:

Syntax 57

rp/p or rf VIC+arguments

The last syllable of the derived predicate, that is, the word preceding the realis past/present or future verbal inflectional clitic, carries primary stress. The verbalized future tense construction is preferred over the use of realis future verbal inflectional clitics alone to express future tense.
Only first person singular or plural inclusive realis future verbal inflectional clitics can occur in the derived predicate (i.e. the embedded sentence) of verbalized future tense constructions. Either realis past/ present or realis future verbal inflectional clitics can occur in the matrix clause. The VIC in the matrix clause marks the subject of the future tense construction as a whole, since the subject marked in the derived predicate and that marked in the matrix clause are always coreferential (this contrasts with an indirect speech interpretation (see 1.1.1.1), in which the subject of the derived predicate is always coreferential with the object of the matrix clause). The subject NP must occur externally, as illustrated below in (89).

1.1.1.4.3.2.3. Verbalized supposition sentences: Verbalized supposition sentences are used to express mistaken speculation or expectation of the speaker. The constituent order of the derived predicate of verbalized supposition sentences when third person is marked on the embedded VIC is:
v+3s/p rf VIC (+o or S NP)+postvm ma' ‘that:prox:hearer’

Note that only a third person singular or plural VIC may occur in the embedded clause, whether referring to third person or second person. The constituent order of the matrix clause is:
rp/p VIC+opt arguments

Only realis past/present verbal inflectional clitics can be used in the matrix clause, and only third person realis future VICS can be used in the derived predicate. The subject marked in the derived predicate is always coreferential with the object marked in the matrix clause.
The embedded clause may contain an NP subject or an NP direct object but not both. If an NP direct object appears in the embedded clause, then an NP subject may not appear there—see (100g–h). A VIC within the embedded clause, referencing the subject, is always obligatory however. This embedded VIC coreferences the object of the matrix clause, whether it is overt or merely understood. Since the postverbal modifier ma' belongs to the class of postverbal modifiers that do not carry stress when occurring in a verb compound, the last syllable of the word preceding it carries primary stress—see 1.2.1.3.1.1.

1.1.1.4.3.3. Group II verbalized sentences The derived predicate of Group II verbalized sentences differs from Group I verbalized sentences in that either it would not serve as a well-formed sentence on its own, or the sentence in which it is embedded could not be interpreted as a quotation. The derived predicates in the examples of this section are italicized.
1.1.1.4.3.3.1. Verbalized conditional sentences: The derived predicate of verbalized conditional sentences consists of a COMP irrealis condition sentence illustrated in the example in (81c) and discussed in 1.1.2.4.2.5. Only COMP condition sentences containing the irrealis INFL morpheme xi appear in verbalized conditional sentences. The constituent order of the embedded clause is:

The matrix clause consists merely of the third person realis past/present VIC na. Since xi' ‘dubitative’ belongs to the class of postverbal modifiers that do not carry stress in a verb compound, the word preceding xi' carries primary stress.

V+irr VIC+na ‘consent’
and the constituent order of the matrix clause is: rp/p VIC+opt arguments/adjuncts
Only irrealis verbal inflectional clitics may be used in desiderative sentences. Primary stress falls on the last syllable of the verbal element, that is, na ‘to consent’, not to be confused with the third person singular realis past/present verbal inflectional clitic na. The verb na forms a compound verb with the embedded verbalized clause (see 2.2.3). The VIC in the formula above must be either first person singular or plural, or third person singular or plural.

1.1.1.4.3.3.3. Verbalized refusal sentences: The constituent order of the derived predicate of verbalized refusal sentences is:

and the constituent order of the matrix clause is:

Verbalized refusal sentences are similar to verbalized desiderative sentences, in that the verb na ‘to consent’ forms a verb compound with their derived predicates. They differ, however, in the verbal inflectional clitics that can be used in their derived predicates. Desideratives use only irrealis VICS; refusals use only the second person singular realis future VIC. The use of verbalized refusal sentences is very limited. We have only recorded them embedded in a COMP negation sentence. We have not recorded any examples with an NP object in the derived predicate. Moreover, since only second person can be used as the subject of the derived predicate, they never have an NP subject. The subject of the matrix clause is coreferential with the subject of the embedded clause. Primary stress falls on the last syllable of the derived predicate, i.e. the verb na ‘to consent’.

1.1.1.4.3.3.4. Verbalized emphatic sentences: The constituent order of the derived predicate of verbalized emphatic sentences is:

and the constituent order of the matrix clause is:

Verbalized emphatic sentences are similar to verbalized desiderative and refusal sentences, in that they all employ the verb na ‘to consent’ in their derived predicates. Verbalized emphatic sentences are distinguished from the other two by the obligatory use of the demonstrative ma' in embedded clause, and the second person realis VIC, together with the ‘dubitative’ particle in the matrix clause. The choice of the singular or plural VIC in the matrix clause is determined by the number of persons addressed. This construction could be loosely translated, in addition to the derived predicate, as ‘…and you better believe it’, or ‘…you can say that again’. Primary stress falls on the verb na. (See 1.1.2.4.2.1(2) for a complete discussion of the ‘dubitative’ particle xi'.)

The person of sequential sentence types is found in the Tenseless or reflexive verbal inflectional clitics in the derived predicate (which has no tense/ mood marked in it); the tense/mood of sequential sentences is found in the verbal inflectional clitic of the matrix clause. Only third person singular Tense verbal inflectional clitics (na ‘realis past/present’, tara ‘realis future’, or xira ‘irrealis’) may occur in the matrix clause. The choice of 'ac ‘to travel’ or mao ‘to go (s)’ in the derived predicate seems to be based on idiolectical preference.
When there is an overt object or subject of the sentence, it usually follows the derived predicate, just as the object or subject follows the verb of a simple sentence; however, about 50 per cent of the time, the overt object may occur inside the derived predicate of verbalized sequential sentences, in which case its last syllable carries primary stress. The overt subject never occurs inside the derived predicate of verbalized sequential sentences. Whether the overt object occurs inside or outside the derived predicate seems to be a choice of stylistic preference. The use of the verbalized sequential sentence is a common way to begin a narrative discourse. The derived predicate is italicized in the following examples:

1.1.1.4.3.3.6. Verbalized comparative sentences: The derived predicate of verbalized comparative sentences is the COMP comparison sentence described in 1.1.1.4.2 and illustrated in the examples in (80). Unlike other COMP sentences, which can occur alone as utterances, the COMP comparison sentence cannot occur alone as an utterance; it can only be used when in its verbalized sentence form.
The constituent order of the derived predicate of verbalized comparative sentences is: COMP comparison sentence+pvm ma' ‘that:prox:hearer’ + opt arguments. The constituent order of the matrix clause is:

The only verbal inflectional clitic that can occur in the matrix clause of verbalized comparative sentences is the third person singular realis past/ present morpheme na. If both an object and subject are expressed, the object NP may occur inside or outside of the derived predicate, but the subject NP must occur outside. If no object NP is expressed, the subject NP may occur inside the derived predicate. No NP can occur simultaneously within the derived predicate and matrix clause. The derived predicate is italicized in the following examples:

1.1.1.4.4. Interactions among verbalized predicates and other constructions

The derived predicate of verbalized sentences may be embedded in various constructions,

including other verbalized sentences. Each embedded derived predicate is marked by

primary stress on its last syllable. However, when this is embedded into another derived

predicate, the primary stress then becomes secondary stress. Thus, primary stress on the

verb goes only on the final syllable of the least embedded predicate. In the following examples, primary stress is shown by [1] and secondary stress is shown by [2]. The most

deeply embedded derived predicates are italicized, and the dominating derived predicate

or clause is in brackets. In (113b) and (113h), where there are three cases of embedding,

the surface predicate is in parentheses. Degree of embedding is signalled by, among other

things, the number of VICS. There is only one VIC per clause, therefore, two VICS

indicate one level of embedding, three indicate two levels of embedding, etc.

1.1.2. Subordination
Subordinate clauses in 'ON consist of noun clauses, relative clauses, and verbal modification (adverb) clauses. Some types of relative constructions are actually derived nouns rather than subordinate clauses. See 2.2.1, where we discuss the similarity between derived nouns and noun and relative clauses. There are no general markers that apply to all types of subordination. See the following subsections for the markers of each type of subordination.

1.1.2.2. Noun clauses

1.1.2.2.1. Marking of noun clauses

In general, noun clauses are marked by the use of the INFL morpheme ca ‘neuter realis past/present’ or 'iri' ‘realis past/present’ preceding the verb, and one of the Tenseless verbal inflectional clitics, a nominal inflectional clitic, or the infinitival/participial marker wa following the verb. Noun clauses appear as the object or subject of the superordinate clause, and, in this function, they follow the VP of the superordinate clause. The noun clauses are italicized in the following examples:

(2) Those marked by possessive marking nominal inflectional clitics Clauses in which possessive marking NICS appear are ‘less’ finite (due to the absence
of a VIC), but not completely nonfinite (due to the presence of INFL). We will, however, call these constructions ‘nonfinite’ throughout, asking the reader to bear in mind what we mean. They are derived nouns—see 2.2.1.

1.1.2.2.6. Nonfinite noun clauses

As explained above, noun clauses in which a nominal inflectional clitic or the infinitival/participial marker wa appear are nonfinite.
1.1.2.2.6.1. Verbal categories in nonfinite clauses No verbal categories are lost in nonfinite noun clauses in which the possessive marking nominal inflectional clitics occur. The categories of person, number and gender are retained in the inflectional clitic marker following the verb, and tense/ mood is retained in the INFL morpheme preceding it. The verbal categories of person, number and gender are lost in nonfinite clauses in which the infinitival/participial marker wa occurs, but tense/mood is retained in the INFL morpheme preceding the verb.
1.1.2.2.6.2. Nonfinite form of the verb The only difference between finite and nonfinite verbs is the choice of the inflectional clitic following the verb. Thus, finite verbs are made nonfinite by removing a Tenseless VIC following the verb, inserting in its place a nominal inflectional clitic expressing possession, or the infinitival/participial marker wa.

1.1.2.2.6.3. Arguments in nonfinite clauses Arguments in a clause in which the infinitival/participial marker wa appear are limited to objects; no subjects may occur. Moreover, the object cannot appear in the wa clause itself, but must follow it. When a subject follows such a nonfinite clause, it is the subject of the superordinate clause, not of the noun clause. Thus, the infinitival/participial marker wa is also a way to express a passive meaning. Note the alternate passive glosses of the examples in (120). The object NPS in the following examples are italicized.

1.1.2.2.6.4–7 Form of arguments, verbal modification and constituent order in nonfinite clauses The form of arguments in nonfinite clauses is the same as that in finite clauses. Verbal modification (i.e. pre- and postverbal modifiers) occurs in nonfinite clauses, although less frequently than in finite clauses. The constituent order is the same for nonfinite clauses as that for finite clauses, that is, the subject and/or object follows the verb, in the order os.

1.1.2.3. Relative clauses

Syntax 79

1.1.2.3.1. Marking of relative clauses

While finite nominal argument clauses are formed only by the neuter or nongender realis past/present INFL morphemes ca or 'iri' before the verb and a Tenseless VIC after it, finite relative clauses may be marked by any of the three realis past/present INFL morphemes (ca ‘neuter realis past/ present’, co ‘masculine/feminine realis past/present’, 'iri' (nonspecific gender)) or the irrealis INFL morpheme xi preceding the verb and/or a VIC following it. In contrast to finite nominal argument clauses, where the INFL morpheme and VIC must be present, the VIC may be deleted in relative clauses when the subject of the relative clause is third person. Moreover, when the verb is reduplicated, the INFL morpheme is often deleted, as in (122j) below. Note the ungrammatical example in (122b), where the nonreduplicated verb prohibits the deletion of the INFL morpheme. As shown in (122k), the relative clause need not always follow its head. Also, note that these relative clauses lack relative pronouns, this function being largely subsumed by the INFL morphemes. The relative clauses are italicized in the following examples:

Since VICS are required of all independent clauses, their optionality in relative clauses indicates that these clauses are indeed subordinate and not merely juxtaposed.

1.1.2.3.2. Restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses There are no distinctions between restrictive and nonrestrictive relative clauses.

1.1.2.3.3. Position of the head noun

The head noun need not always occur. When it does, it will precede the relative clause, but it need not immediately precede the relative clause, as stated in 1.1.2.3.1. Additional examples are:

1.1.2.3.4–5. Treatment of the relativized element

The relativized element is only expressed in the subordinate clause (optionally) via an INFL morpheme. It seems restricted to a nominal which could be the subject or object of the relative verb. The choice of VIC and INFL morpheme (whether ca ‘neuter realis past/present’, co ‘masculine/ feminine realis past/present’, or 'iri' ‘realis past/present’) depends on the gender and grammatical relation of the head noun: when the head noun is masculine or feminine subject, co ‘masculine/feminine realis past/ present’ or 'iri' ‘realis past/present’ and third person realis past/present VICS (na ‘singular’ or nana ‘plural’) are used; otherwise, ca ‘neuter realis past/present’ or 'iri' and any one of the Tenseless VICS may be used. See 1.1.1.4.2, preceding examples (64) and (65), where we discuss the choice of INFL morpheme and VIC in relation to interrogatives; and 2.1.3.6.2.2. for the paradigms of VICS. The relative clauses are italicized in the following examples:

1.1.2.3.6. Headless relative clauses
Headless relative clauses are very common. They are marked like any other relative clause—see examples in 1.1.2.3.3.

1.1.2.3.7. Elements of the sentence that can be relativized

Only constituents that could be referenced on the VIC (see 1.2.1.2.3) can be relativized. We have no record of more than one relativized constituent in a sentence. We illustrate here relativization of different semantic roles (see 1.2.1.2.7). The relative clauses are italicized in the following examples:

1.1.2.3.8. Movement of elements in relative clauses
Only the relativized element moves to the beginning of the clause immediately following the (optional) head noun (and perhaps the preposition, see (125b)).

1.1.2.3.9. Nonfinite relative clauses

Quasi-nonfinite relative clauses occur. They are marked by the use of the infinitival/participial marker wa instead of the VICS used in finite relative clauses. Unlike finite relative clauses, in which the INFL morpheme introducing them is optional, we have no record of quasi-nonfinite clauses occurring without an INFL morpheme (hence the qualifier ‘quasi’); and unlike finite relative clauses, whose head nouns can serve as either subject or object of the relative clause, head nouns of nonfinite relative clauses can appear only as the object of the verb of the subordinate clause. This is partially responsible for the fact that the infinitival/participial marker wa often receives a gloss of ‘passive’—see 2.1.3.1.1. Like nonfinite noun clauses, nonfinite relative clauses are treated morphosyntactically as derived nouns. Examples (126) illustrate nonfinite relative clauses. The relative clauses are italicized in these examples:

1.1.2.4. Verbal modification clauses

1.1.2.4.1. Marking and position of verbal modification clauses
In general, verbal modification clauses take the form of COMP sentence types. There are, however, many different ways to express verbal modification clauses. The position of most verbal modification clauses is rigidly fixed by the type of clause: some types always precede the superordinate clause, while others always follow it. However, two types can either precede or follow the superordinate clause. Each clause type is treated separately below.
Although verbal modification clauses are subordinate to their main clauses, there is usually a pause and falling intonation between some of them, indicating that they may be separate sentences. In addition, some main clauses are often left unexpressed, understood by the context. While this does not make them any less subordinate semantically, it could again indicate that they are not syntactically subordinate, although more study of their independent occurrence is needed. This phenomenon is described where relevant in the subsections below.

1.1.2.4.2. Marking of particular verbal modification clauses

1.1.2.4.2.1. Time There are five different ways to express time clauses: (1) v 'i…ne clauses The most common time clause is marked by the use of the postverbal modifier
'i:s/'iri:p ‘already’ immediately following the verb, and the occurrence of the recent past/uncertainty particle ne at the end of the sentence. It should be noted that the ‘number’ of the verbal modifier does not necessarily refer to the number of the actors of the verb; singular/ plural in verbal elements also refers to the intensity of the action. In this case, 'iri ‘already:p’ describes an action that took place more recently than one modified simply by 'i ‘already:s’. Tense/mood (realis past/ present (127a), realis future (127b) and irrealis (127c)) is indicated by the choice of VIC accompanying the verb. There is always agreement of tense/ mood between the subordinate and superordinate clauses, v 'i…ne time clauses always precede the superordinate clause. They must be followed by a superordinate clause, although the superordinate clause need not necessarily immediately follow the subordinate clause. While pause and falling intonation between the two clauses indicate that they are two separate sentences phonologically, we take the restriction that both clauses agree in tense/mood to mean that they are still syntactically related. Strings of v 'i…ne clauses can occur. The example in (127d) shows two v 'i…ne time clauses separated from their superordinate clause by a parenthetical clause to which they are not subordinate. The superordinate clause of a v 'i…ne time clause often takes the form of a sequential verbalized sentence (see 1.1.1.4.3.3.5).

(2) xi' time clauses xi' time clauses are marked by the use of the particle xi' immediately preceding the
VIC, compounded as a postverbal modifier with the verb. We are not sure what xi' means. We are going to gloss it here as ‘dubitative’, although we are still not certain that it is in fact the same morpheme. It occurs elsewhere as a sentence-final particle, expressing doubt or supposition; it may also appear as a postverbal modifier to express negation; it interacts with negative postverbal modifiers to express a strong positive causal meaning; it appears with certain nonsubordinate condition clauses; it can mean ‘certainly’ to express emphasis; and it seems to be able to express indefinite or hypothetical time in xi' time clauses. It is not to be confused with the irrealis INFL morpheme xi (note the absence of the glottal plosive), nor the first person inclusive realis future VIC xi'. In xi' time clauses, only third person realis past/present VICS (na/nana) may appear. Xi' time clauses precede their superordinate clauses and, like v 'i…ne time clauses, pause and falling intonation indicate that they are independent phonologically. There does not seem to be as much connection between xi' time clauses and their superordinate clauses as is the case with v 'i…ne clauses, in that they are less likely to occur with a superordinate clause. However, there does seem to be an apparent morphosyntactic constraint holding between the VICS of the two clauses, namely, they must both be in realis past/present. Note in example (128c) that a string of xi' clauses precedes a series of main clauses that seem to be functioning as the clauses to which the xi' clauses are subordinate. Note also that the second xi' clause is a sequential sentence which generally functions as the superordinate clause of time clauses, as in the v ‘i…ne discussed previously.
It should be noted that, while we have found many examples of xi' time clauses in text, native speakers declare that its use is bad grammar. We do not yet understand this discrepancy between frequent use versus intuitions of unacceptability of xi' clauses by native speakers. They say v 'i… ne constructions are the most correct way to express time clauses. Xi' time clauses are italicized in the following examples:

(3) Pain subordinate clauses used as time clauses Pain subordinate clauses express time, manner, and cause. The temporal reading (as
opposed to other readings of these sentences; see 1.1.2.4.2.2 and 1.1.2.4.2.4(5)) is contextually determined. The preverbal modifier 'aram ‘finally:p’ is optionally used and has the effect of clarifying that a particular pain clause expresses a temporal notion. A pain subordinate clause usually follows its superordinate clause, and it cannot be separated from it, except when topicalized. In this case only, it may precede its superordinate clause. There is a slight pause between the clauses, but high intonation held to the end of the time clause indicates that it cannot be completely separated from its main clause. Thus pain initial clauses are much more like grammatically subordinate clauses than those mentioned previously. Pain subordinate clauses, used as time clauses, are italicized in the following examples:

(4) Condition clauses used as time clauses Realis future condition clauses (introduced by mo ta… ‘conditional INFL:rf’) may be
used to express time—see 1.1.2.4.2.5. The preverbal modifier 'aram ‘finally:p’ is often used with the verb. The condition clause precedes its main clause, and pause and falling

Syntax 91

intonation between the clauses suggest, like other clauses we have seen, that these may be two separate, juxtaposed sentences.

(5) Sequential type construction used as time clauses A sequential type of construction, using the sequential verbalized sentence type
described in 1.1.1.4.3.3.5 (see the discussion preceding examples (111)), expresses an action simultaneous to the action of the superordinate clause. The time clause is introduced by the neuter realis past/present INFL morpheme ca, which is immediately followed by the sequential verbalized sentence type. This time clause follows its superordinate clause. There is no pause between the clauses, and they cannot be separated.

1.1.2.4.2.2. Manner The closest thing to a manner clause takes the form of a nominalized pain subordinate clause like that expressing time and cause—see the discussion in 1.1.2.4.2.1.(3). It follows its superordinate clause and cannot be separated from it. The preverbal modifier mam ‘instrument’ must accompany the verb of the superordinate clause. The nominalized pain subordinate clause expressing manner is italicized in the following example:

(132) Mam

Otherwise, manner is normally expressed by pre- and postverbal modifiers (133a–b) and verbs occurring in postverbal modifier position (133c).

1.1.2.4.2.3. Purpose Purpose clauses are COMP sentences, marked by the use of ma' ‘that proximate to hearer’ as the operator word in COMP, immediately followed by the INFL morpheme ta ‘realis future’. A purpose clause follows its superordinate clause. There is usually a pause and falling intonation between the clauses, indicating that they may be separate sentences. Moreover, there are no morphosyntactic constraints, such as interclausal tense/mood agreement, indicating that they may simply be juxtaposed. The (semantically) superordinate clause must be expressed, however, or at least well understood by the context.

1.1.2.4.2.4. Cause Most cause clauses employ a kind of negation. This happens in a number of ways:

1 The dubitative particle xi' (see time clauses—1.1.2.4.2.1(2)) interacts with negative postverbal modifiers to produce a strong positive. This is then interpreted as ‘because’.
2 Irrealis verbal modification clauses are used in such a way that their basic reading of affirmative is interpreted as negative, and vice versa.
3 The verb 'om ‘not exist’ is negated or otherwise modified in three different ways. 4 Contraexpective verbal modification clauses which, by their nature carry a negative
connotation, are sometimes used to express cause.

There are also two other unrelated ways to express cause:

5 Pain subordinate clauses 6 Equative clauses.

(1) The dubitative particle xi' functioning in cause clauses Where xi' seems to express indefinite or hypothetical time in time clauses, it interacts
with the postverbal modifier 'ara to produce a reading of either 'because' or noncontradictory sentence emphasis (see 1.11.1.1). Either a causal or emphatic reading may be derived when 'ara xi' occurs in a fully independent clause. But only the causal interpretation is possible when the clause containing 'ara xi' occurs with another clause, to which it exhibits a semantically subordinate relationship. A subordinate 'ara xi' clause must follow its matrix clause. However, pause and intonation indicate that they are separate clauses, at least phonologically. Therefore, here as in other cases above, the terms superordinate, matrix, and subordinate indicate semantic relations and possibly syntactic relations as well.

This is not the only way xi' can combine with 'ara (or its singular form 'a), however. In the previous examples, xi' immediately followed 'ara. In the following examples, a VIC may intervene between 'ara and xi', to produce a causal reading as well. The principal difference in distribution between these clauses and the type illustrated in (137) above is that these latter clauses occur independently of an expressed superordinate clause. This type of cause clause may also involve the co-occurrence of xi' and the postverbal modifier 'awin ‘negative’. This type of construction is often ended with the particle 'ira ‘past progressive’.

(2) Irrealis verbal modification clauses functioning as cause clauses Irrealis verbal modification clauses must be introduced by the INFL morpheme xi
‘irrealis’. There is no distinction between cause, condition, and grounds/conclusion clauses when they take the form of simple irrealis verbal modification clauses—see 1.1.2.4.2.5(2) and 1.1.2.4.2.9. They may be interpreted as either ‘because’, ‘if, or ‘or’, depending upon the context. When they mean ‘because’, the affirmative surface meaning is interpreted as negative, and vice versa. Irrealis verbal modification clauses often end with the emphatic particle ta. The irrealis verbal modification clause follows the clause it modifies and may be separated from it. In fact, it is very often used with its modified clause left unexpressed. Though unexpressed, the modified clause is clear from context.

(3) Negated 'om clauses functioning as cause clauses There are three ways in which the verb 'om ‘not exist’ can be negated or otherwise
modified to render a causal reading. Two of these ways render a positive reading and one way renders a negative reading.
(i) The most common way of deriving the relevant causal reading from an 'om clause is via the irrealis INFL xi, as described in the preceding section (illustrated in examples (139)). 'Om ‘not exist’ is the main verb and, since the ‘subject’ of this clause is a noun clause and its gender is neuter, only the Tenseless third person neuter VIC ne may accompany the verb. These clauses must follow the clause they modify semantically. We see little evidence of a syntactic or phonological link between these 'om clauses and the clauses they modify however. The relationship seems mainly semantic. It is interesting to compare examples (140a–b) and (140c–d): (140a) and (140c) are taken from the text gathered fifteen to twenty years ago; these same sentences are now expressed by young native speakers as (140b) and (140d), with the postverbal modifier 'ara ‘negative plural’ accompanying the verb. The presence of 'ara makes no difference in the meaning of the cause construction.

(ii) The other type of 'om ‘because’ clause that renders a positive meaning is a simple sentence which follows the sentence it modifies. Like the xi 'om ne clause, this second, positive 'om clause seems to combine paratactically with its preceding clause in that it is interpreted as a single semantic unit with the preceding clause, but is phonologically and syntactically separate. This type of 'om clause is a simple sentence whose subject is a noun clause, in which the postverbal modifier 'a ‘negative’ following the verb 'om ‘not exist’ requires the use of a Tenseless VIC—see the discussion in 1.1.1.4.1. The only possible syntactic link we can see between the two clauses is that 'om 'a ne clauses can follow only superordinate clauses that manifest the realis past/present tense/mood. The only examples of 'om 'a ne that we have in our corpus are in text gathered many years ago. It is used rarely nowadays.

Some 'om clauses produce a negative meaning even when 'om forms a double negative, unlike the cases of double negatives mentioned in 1.1.1.4.1(1) and 1.4.3. These are marked by the use of the particle xi' ‘dubitative’ used elsewhere in cause clauses—see 1.1.2.4.2.4(1). This type of cause clause, shown in (142a), is rare. Cause with a negative meaning is usually expressed by a simple negative statement, as in (142b).

(4) Contraexpective clauses functioning as cause clauses Contraexpective clauses are interpreted as ‘because’ or ‘but’, depending on the
context. When they occur independently, without overtly modify-ing another clause, they usually have a reading of ‘because’. See 1.1.2.4.2.8 for the structure and uses of contraexpective clauses.
(5) Pain subordinate clauses functioning as cause clauses This type of cause clause is identical to its corresponding time and manner clause. The clause follows the superordinate clause and cannot be separated from it—see examples (129) and (132). The pain subordinate clause expressing cause is often accompanied by the verb mi' ‘give’ in postverbal modifier position in its superordinate clause. Mi' also occurs in postverbal modifier position in certain interrogatives to render a meaning of ‘why?’

1.1.2.4.2.5. Condition There are two different ways to express condition clauses: by means of mo COMP clauses, and by means of irrealis modification clauses.
(1) COMP clauses with the operator word mo ‘conditional’ functioning as condition clauses
The most common way to express condition is by a COMP sentence marked by the use of the word mo ‘conditional’ appearing in COMP. Two different INFL morphemes can appear in condition clauses: ta ‘realis future’ or xi ‘irrealis’. The mo condition clause precedes the clause it modifies, although each receives separate intonation and they are separated by a pause. They do seem syntactically related however, in that there must be agreement in tense/mood between the modifying and modified clauses, i.e. modified clauses manifesting either realis past/ present or realis future tense/mood may follow modifying clauses manifesting realis future, but if the modifying clause manifests irrealis tense/ mood, the modifying clause must also manifest irrealis; see (145d) where this is violated. BK has heard one 'Oro Nao' speaker use the operator word ma' instead of mo in mo condition clauses. She believes this is due to the influence of that speaker’s wife, who belongs to another subgroup.

Mo condition clauses can also occur without an overt modified clause. Example (147) below was taken from a legend, in which a man and his sister are talking about papaya. Note the absence of a modified clause following the second mo ta clause.

When mo xi clauses do not modify another clause, they are embedded as the derived predicate of the verbalized sentence described in 1.1.1.4.3.3.1. The dubitative particle xi' (with perhaps a gloss of ‘negative’ here; see 1.1.2.4.2.1(2)) attaches to the embedded clause as a postverbal modifier, and the realis past/present VIC na appears in the matrix clause. The whole sentence is understood as modifying an unexpressed clause which is understood in the context.

Mo ta condition clauses may be used to express time—see 1.1.2.4.2.1(4). (2) Irrealis verbal modification clauses functioning as condition clauses See 1.1.2.4.2.4(2) for the description of irrealis verbal modification clauses used as
cause clauses. When used as condition clauses, irrealis verbal modification clauses maintain their basic reading, in contrast to their use in cause clauses, where their affirmative form is interpreted as negative, and vice versa. Irrealis verbal modification clauses follow their superordinate clauses. There is usually no pause or falling intonation between the clauses.

Just as when they are used in cause clauses, irrealis verbal modification condition clauses may also occur with their modified clauses unexpressed, in which case the meaning that would have been expected from the modified clause is clear from the context. The irrealis verbal modification clause often ends with the emphatic particle ta.

1.1.2.4.2.6. Result The notion of reason/result is often manifested by a COMP sentence in which je ‘third person neuter emphatic pronoun’ appears in COMP, and ca ‘neuter realis past/present’, 'iri' ‘realis past/ present’, ta ‘realis future’, or xi ‘irrealis’ appears in INFL. The postverbal modifier qui' ‘coming this way’ often follows the verb when ta or xi occur in INFL. Je clauses are fully independent clauses. They often mark the beginning of paragraphs, in which capacity they function as a kind of link or transition from one theme to another, as though what follows is a result of what precedes. Note the meaning of (152c), where either reason/result could be understood or interrogative ‘why?’—see 1.1.1.4.2(9), where we discuss the use of irrealis reason/result clauses to express the interrogative ‘why?’ and ‘why not?’

Je clauses may, however, also follow statements and seem to function in direct (semantic) subordination to them (153a). This is especially true of je clauses manifesting irrealis (153b). They often work closely with mo xi condition clauses, with reason expressed in the mo xi clause and result in a clause begun by je xi.

The notion of result can also be expressed by use of the preverbal modifier para ‘therefore’. Para explicitly expresses results in (154a), where it occurs in a statement like (153a). It may also occur in a simple sentence as described in the paragraph following

Syntax 105

examples (57), where para requires the use of Tenseless VICS following the verb. When expressing the notion of result, such a para sentence must follow a contraexpective verbal modification clause (154b).

1.1.2.4.2.7. Comparative and equative The notions of comparative and equative are expressed two ways:
(1) By the verb win ‘like’ or ‘same’ It may appear as an equative verb in a simple sentence (155a), where it must be accompanied by Tenseless VICS (see 1.1.1.4.1(4) and the discussion in 1.1.1.4.1, following the examples in (57) and (61)). It may also appear in COMP in a construction similar to the 'om cause clause described in 1.1.2.4.2.4(3), preceding the examples in (141), in which win appears as a verb and the third person neuter Tenseless VIC ne follows it, referencing a noun clause subject introduced by ca ‘neuter realis past/present’ INFL morpheme (155b). Win may also appear as the leftmost member of a compound verb to express the notion of equative (155c).

(2) By the verb 'ac ‘like’ 'Ac, compounded with a denominalized verb appearing in a simple sentence, expresses
equative:

(156)

'Ac

pana

na.

like

wood

3s:rp/p

‘It is like a tree.’

Any other use of 'ac as a comparative/equative, i.e. when followed by a verb, requires its use in a COMP comparison sentence, in which case 'ac appears as the operator word in COMP, and the entire COMP sentence must be embedded as the derived predicate in a verbalized comparative sentence—see 1.1.1.4.3.3.6. Note the absence of the INFL morpheme ca and reduplication of the verb in the example in (157b). This is typical of what can happen to nominal modification clauses—see again the discussion in 1.1.2.3.1 (see also 2.2.4.1.2, where we discuss the deletion of INFL when the verb is reduplicated).

‘Hatem looks to me like my older sister.’

1.1.2.4.2.8. Contraexpective The notion of contraexpective is expressed by the COMP clause in which 'ane ‘different’ appears in COMP. The use of the recent past sentencefinal particle, ne, is obligatory. When a noun occurs in the verb position of the sentence,

Syntax 107

the INFL morpheme ca ‘neuter realis past/present’ precedes it; when a verb occurs in the verb position of the sentence, no INFL morpheme follows COMP. When a contraexpective clause is not immediately preceded by a clause setting up the expectation, as in (158a), it is usually interpreted as ‘because’; when it is preceded by a clause setting up the expectation, as in (158c–d), it is interpreted as ‘but’. The clause preceding contraexpective clauses often manifests the verb paxi' ‘to not find’ in the postverbal modifier position. Note (158d), where the contraexpective clause is both preceded and followed by clauses to which it is related.

Contraexpective may also be expressed by the verb paxi' ‘to not find’ or ‘frustrative’ in the postverbal position in a simple sentence, which precedes the clause setting up the expectation. A pause and falling intonation separate the two clauses.

1.1.2.4.2.9. Grounds/conclusion The irrealis verbal modification clause that expresses cause and condition can also express grounds/conclusion. It follows the modified clause, and pause and falling intonation indicate that they are separate units. Grounds is expressed in the modifying clause, while conclusion is expressed in the modified clause.

1.1.2.4.3. Nonfinite verbal modification clauses

Verbal modification clauses can also be made nonfinite by replacing the VIC with the infinitival/participial marker, wa. When wa is used, only the object of a transitive verb can be overtly expressed; no subject can be expressed. Compare the sets of examples below:

1.1.2.5. Sequence of tenses
There are sequence of time requirements between v i…ne time clauses and irrealis verbal modification clauses used as condition clauses and their respective superordinate clauses. The use of irrealis in a subordinate clause usually requires agreement in the superordinate clause, but see (139), where the irrealis tense/mood of the irrealis verbal modification clause used as a cause clause does not agree with the realis future tense/ mood in the superordinate clause.

1.2. STRUCTURAL QUESTIONS

1.2.1. Internal structure of the sentence

1.2.1.1. Copular sentences

Copular sentences do not exist. This notion is expressed by what would be the nominal, adjectival, or adverbial complement of a copular appearing as the verb of the sentence. The element in the verbal position is accompanied by a VIC like any verb, so that to say, for example, ‘the baby is a man (male)’, ‘the house is small’, or ‘the boy is fast’, one says, ‘the baby mans (males)’, ‘the house smalls’, and ‘the boy fasts’. Nouns may be zero-derived, i.e. occur in the verb position without any morphological changes (167a), or a noun may occur as a derived verb as described in 2.2.2.1.2.2 by using one of its inflections (167b–c). The notion of adverbial is expressed by a regular verb (167d).

One might attempt to dispute our analysis of the above clauses, arguing instead that the VIC is acting as a copular verb and that the material on both sides of it is nominal, functioning as a predicate adjective/nominal. However, there are at least five reasons to reject this analysis in favour of the analysis in the text, namely, that the material to the left of the VIC is in fact a zero-derived verb. The reasons are as follows:

(a) Nouns appearing to the left of the VIC are interpreted descriptively (but predicatively) in the second and third person forms, but actively or even agentively in their first person form.
(b) These apparent nominals may be compounded with verbs or verbal modifiers. (c) When compounded, they may undergo semantic drift. (d) When nonfinal in a compound, a nominal may not bear primary stress (unless
followed by a stress-rejecting modifier). (e) These noun-verb compounds may be preceded by COMP+INFL sequences.

Moreover, if material to the left of VICS in these ‘copular’ constructions was nonverbal, this would be the only case in the language where a VIC attaches to nonverbal material. Segments (a)–(e) are discussed in detail in section 2.2.
The closest thing to a copular construction is a nonverbal sentence in which the demonstrative ma' ‘that proximate to hearer’, or one of its variants (mon ‘singular masculine’, momon ‘plural masculine’, mam ‘singular feminine’, mamam ‘plural feminine’, and main ‘neuter'), or an emphatic pronoun, occurs in the sentence-initial position, optionally followed by a demonstrative and an NP (which may take the form of a noun derived from a sentence (168h)). There is no overt be-copula. The demonstrative in the NP is not obligatory, though it usually occurs.

1.2.1.2. Verbal sentences
Most 'ON sentences are manifested (overtly at least) by the verb only. The occurrence of one argument with the VP (either the expressed object, subject, or some other constituent) is common, but the occurrence of two arguments is fairly uncommon. More than two arguments can occur, but this is even rarer.

1.2.1.2.1. Subject

Third person subject may be overtly expressed (171a), or marked only by the VIC (171b– c).

(171) a.

Mao

na

'Orowao'.

go:s

3s:rp/p

m:name

‘'Orowao' went.’

(171) b.

Mao

na.

go:s

3s:rp/p

‘He went.’

(171) c.

ca

mao

ca.

not:exist

INFL:nrp/p

go:s

3sm

‘He didn’t go.’

Even when overtly expressed, the subject is almost always also marked in the VIC (but see the following examples, where the subject is third person and the object is first person, in which case the subject VIC can be omitted, although this is rare).

(172) a.

First and second person pronominal subjects are often heard in exchanges between outsiders and the Wari', however we consider this to be merely a form of ‘mission language’. The use of first and second person pronominal subjects is never observed in exchanges strictly among the Wari' themselves. Third person subject may, however, be expressed by a demonstrative pronoun, as well as a VIC, as in (176).

The subject VIC may be omitted entirely in long discourses describing series of actions— see 1.12, where the occurrence of verbs without VICS is a device used to signal events on the main thematic line of a discourse. Example (177) is taken from a text about the origin of corn. Note the direct speeches in this example, in which the VICS marking the subject of the nonexistent ‘said’ verb are also omitted.

1.2.1.2.2. Direct object

Wari' 118

A transitive verb may occur without expressing the direct object (181a), either as an NP or a VIC. An intransitive verb may occur with an oblique argument that is marked by the object VIC, making it appear transitive (181b)—see 1.2.1.2.3-4. See also 1.2.1.2.4, where we discuss demotion of a direct object to oblique object.

1.2.1.2.3. Indirect object and ethical dative
1.2.1.2.3.1. Indirect object When more than one object-like argument occurs in the sentence, the object referenced in the VIC will be the highest on the hierarchy: indirect object (goal/circumstance)>direct object (theme/patient)>oblique object (although an indirect and oblique object rarely occur in the same sentence). We will use the labels indirect object, direct object and oblique object to refer to grammatical relations borne by goal, theme/patient and oblique arguments in English (or ‘underlying grammatical relations’). The object VIC is always required with definite objects, but optional with indefinite objects, as discussed in 1.2.5.2.4. Thus a definite indirect object will always be marked on the VIC. If there is no indirect object, the direct object can be marked on the

Wari' 120

VIC. If neither of these two occur, the oblique object may be referenced by the VIC. In the extremely rare cases where more than one oblique object occurs, we have noticed the following preference for marking on the VIC: location>time (see 2.1.1.4.3 and 2.1.1.4.4 for a discussion of instrumental and comitative roles; we will simply say here that instrumental and comitative cannot cooccur). Objects not referenced by the VIC will be marked by an appropriate form of the preposition (except in the cases discussed in 1.2.5.2.4). All NP arguments are optional when referenced by an agreement morpheme.

The verb mi' and the demonstrative ca' ‘this neuter’ (here meaning ‘from’) may also appear as the rightmost member of a compound verb in postverbal modification position, adding an indirect object to the number of arguments normally taken by the leftmost member (when that member otherwise lacks such an object), as in (194). When mi' and ca' occur in postverbal modification position, they do not carry stress.

1.2.1.2.3.2. Ethical dative In addition to the arguments of the (simple or compound) verb which may be referenced in the object portion of the VIC (according to the hierarchy given in the introduction to 1.2.1.2.3.1), there is one other use of the object VIC. We label this use here ‘ethical dative’ agreement, since it functions like so-called ethical dative clitics in Romance. The ethical dative references a person affected by the action of the verb, even when that person is not actually an argument of the verb itself (i.e. is not directly implicated by the core semantics of the verb). An example from Brazilian Portuguese will help illustrate what we mean:

(195)

Você

me

estragou

a

festa.

you

to

me

ruined

the party

‘You ruined the party for me.’

In such examples, the ethical dative clitic (italicized) may have either a malefactive or benefactive reading, i.e. the action may be interpreted as positive or negative for the person referenced by the dative clitic, depending on the context. Consider the following 'ON examples, where the ethical dative clitics and their glosses are italicized:

jima'.

cry:p

3p:rp/p-3sm

dead:one

‘They are crying (over) the dead one.’

In these examples, the verb does not normally take an indirect object (i.e. goal). Further, there is no compounding required to ‘add’ an extra argument position for the NP referenced on the VIC. This, and the fact that the interpretation of the nominal so referenced corresponds to the interpretations available for the Romance ethical dative clitics, suggests that the object VIC may play a similar role in 'ON. The difference is that in 'ON, the ethical dative is marked by an affix rather than a clitic (although the affix is part of a clitic). Therefore, since this affix position is normally ‘reserved’ for verbal argument portions, the ethical dative reading is only possible if the verb otherwise lacks a logical indirect object (i.e. goal). This is shown in the following:

(197) a.

*Mao

mapa'

pain

Guajará.

ma-pa'

go:s

2s:rp/p-1s

prep:3n

paper

prep:3sm

‘He gave the book to him on your behalf/for your benefit.’

Syntax 125

Otherwise, ethical datives are treated like indirect objects (in spite of the fact that they are not what generative grammar would call ‘subcategorized arguments’ of the verb). One could not merely analyse the ethical dative as a goal or indirect object argument of the verb, since (i) they are always optional, whereas definite indirect objects (goals) are obligatorily marked; and (ii) they are not part of the core meaning of the verb.

1.2.1.2.4. Oblique object

When an oblique argument is the only object-like argument of a verb, it is usually referenced by the object VIC as discussed above.

1.2.1.2.6. Order of constituents

The occurrence of multiple overtly expressed constituents is uncommon, but the basic order seems to be vos (201 a), and an indirect object occurs between the direct object and the subject (201b).

In contrast to an oblique object in the form of an NP, which may either precede or follow the subject, an oblique object derived from a pain subordinate clause may only follow the subject. It should be noted, however, that oblique objects derived from pain subordinate clauses rarely occur with another argument.

We stated above that the most frequent constituent word order of 'ON is vos. This constituent order does not refer to the agreement affixes which form the VIC (where subject VIC always precedes object VIC). Although the preferred constituent order is object followed by subject, the subject occasionally precedes the object in sentences where both constituents are overtly expressed, especially when there is no ambiguity as to which element is the subject and which is the object. See 1.10, where the verbs ma' ‘to exist’ and om ‘to not exist’ usually cause a subject-object order in sentences expressing possession. In the examples below, (204a) shows the normal object-subject order, and (204b) shows the subject-object order.

When both the subject and object (direct or oblique) are overtly expressed, and one of them is an NP containing two nouns (possessed NP or two nouns in apposition to each other), the other constituent can (though rarely does) occur between the constituents of the NP. The examples in (205)–(209) were all taken from text.
In (205) the subject tocwe ‘Brazil nut’ occurs between the two elements of the oblique object, winacon ‘head(3sm)’ and Jimain ‘masculine name’:

In (208), the subject wiri' ‘wasp’ occurs between the two elements of the direct object, winacon ‘head(3sm)’ and 'Orowao' Xoc Waji ‘masculine name’:

Note, however, in (209), that the subject pacun ‘rock’ precedes the possessed NP object xiricon wijam ‘house(3sm) non-Indian’, without separating its two elements, illustrating that this interposition is not obligatory.

1.2.1.2.7. Anti-agreement effects
There is an anti-agreement effect for moved objects but not subjects. Any object which would normally be marked on the VIC is prohibited from being referenced on the VIC when fronted to sentence-initial position, e.g. relative clauses, information questions and clefted sentences. This happens whether the sentence is negative or positive.

1.2.1.3. Verbal modification

1.2.1.3.1. Types of adverbials

The following types of verbal modification occur. 1.2.1.3.1.1. Verbal modifiers The notion of simple adverbial modification is
expressed by verb compounding. What we call pre- and postverbal modifiers immediately precede or follow a verb root, producing a compound verb. The distinguishing characteristic of verbal modifiers is their inability to occur in a noncompounded, simple verb. Some of them display a property of regular verbs: they have singular (less intense) and plural (intense) forms—see 2.1.3.6.2.3. Pairs of singular/plural modifiers are indicated by ‘/’. Listed below are the preverbal modifiers that we have encountered:

'aji

attachedly

'am/'aram

finally; perhaps; for example; when

'amon / 'aramon

diminutive

'iri'

truly; gradually

jun

suddenly

main

eventually

mam'

immediately

mon/momon

slowly

tama'

always

'u' um

at dawn

wara

already

xec

tomorrow

xim

tonight

xo'

recently

xut xut

suddenly (lit. ‘walk walk’)

Examples (220) show the way some of these verbal modifiers function:

(220) a.

Main

mi'

teterem

pain.

tatara-em

attachedly

mother:1s

3s:rp/p

‘He is a mama’s boy.’ (lit. ‘He (says), “My attachedly mother”.’)

Some of the verbal modifiers listed above also have other functions. Three are actually nouns (see 2.2.2 on zero-derivation of verbs): 'u' um ‘dawn’ or ‘dusk’, xec ‘day’, and xim ‘night’.

(221) a.

'Iri' ‘truly’ and wara ‘already’ can modify verbs ((222a), (223a)) or nouns ((222b), (223b)). They must precede the element they modify.

Postverbal modifiers occur in the compound-final position. Verbs may also occur in this position. We distinguish these by labelling as postverbal modifiers those morphemes which may only occur in this position. It is common for monosyllabic postverbal modifiers in this position to avoid stress. Verbs in this position can undergo some semantic drift (see 2.2.3.1.2.1–2 on compounding for more details). Example (224) illustrates a few verbs occurring in postverbal modification position.

(224) a.

There follows a list of postverbal modifiers. They must appear in a compound verb.

'a/' ara

negative

'awin

ca'

a while; from (lit. ‘this neuter’)

Wari' 138

in place of first near; very always, forever each other wrong only very now already; just now again again before leaving negative subject focus accidentally coming this way a little first at night together distractedly together with for no reason correctly

The examples in (225) show how some of these postverbal modifiers function.

(225) a.

Xain

Two of the postverbal modifiers listed above are used only in negative constructions: cam ‘very’ and homa ‘very’.

3s:rp/p

Some monosyllabic postverbal modifiers never take stress. In the following examples, (1)

marks stress:

(228) a.

1'An

ca'

napa'

pain.

*'Awi 1mao ne.

Some monosyllabic verbs that occur in postverbal modification position take stress

optionally. We have noticed that whether they take the primary stress seems to be a

matter of speaker preference in free variation. We have treated pin ‘completely’ here as a

verb. There is a homophonous verb which means ‘to let go’ or ‘to leave behind’ when

used alone. If we are correct in equating both pins, then it follows our generalization here.

If these are not the same element, then pin ‘completely’ is the only monosyllabic

postverbal modifier which can optionally take stress.

(232) a.

1Pi'

pin

na.

finish

completely

3s:rp/p

‘It is finished.’

prep:3n

‘He wants me to do it.’ (lit. ‘He wants it for me.’)

(234) b.

Pa1ram mi' napa' pain.

Both pre- and postverbal modifiers can accompany the same verb. It is rare, however, to find more than one of each in a single sentence. Two postverbal modifiers can occur in a single VP if they are merely modifiers in an adverbial sense; however, no more than one postverbal modifier that is contributing to the expression of an oblique object may occur in one VP -see 1.2.1.2.4.

Another type of verbal modification is accomplished by sentence-final temporal particles: pa'ao' ‘afterwards, after the others go’, ne ‘recent past’, pane ‘remote past’, pacara pane ‘historic past’ and ira ‘progressive past’. All but pa' 'ao' refer to time in the past; pa’ 'ao' can also refer to time in the past, but it refers to a future point in time relative to its context. The use of ne, pane and pacara pane is relative to the thoughts of the speaker, whether the action is considered to be recent, slightly remote or very remote.

1.2.1.3.1.2. Prepositional phrases Prepositional phrases may be used as verbal modifiers—see examples (184)–(194) in 1.2.1.2.3.1.
1.2.1.3.1.3. Cases of noun phrases There is no case marking in the language. 1.2.1.3.1.4. Verbal modification clauses Verbal modification clauses are described in 1.1.2.4. 1.2.1.3.2. Position of adverbials See 1.2.1.3.1.1 for the position of verbal modifiers in relation to the verb.

1.2.2. Nominal modification phrases
Nominal modification phrases do not occur. This notion is expressed by verbal modifiers—see 1.2.1.3.

1.2.3. Verbal modification phrases
Verbal modification phrases do not occur. This notion is expressed by verbal modifiers— see 1.2.1.3.

1.2.4. Prepositional phrases

1.2.4.1. Operational definition for the prepositional phrase
The prepositional phrase is defined mainly in terms of its internal composition: the head, consisting of an inflected form of the single 'ON preposition (see 2.1.5), followed by an optional nominal element, composed of an NP (238a–c), noun clause (238d), or derived noun (238e). The first or second person inflection of the preposition appears alone, i.e. no

Syntax 143

nominal element may follow it (238f). The prepositional phrase is further defined by its syntactic function as an object-like argument to the verb—see 1.2.1.2.3–4.

1.2.4.2. Prepositional phrases and their arguments

The third person form of the prepositions may occur with or without an overt NP or pronoun arguments. However, the first and second person forms of the preposition cannot take overt arguments. Note the ungrammatical occurrence of an emphatic pronoun as the argument of the second person form of the preposition in (239d).

No form of the preposition can be stranded, it cannot be modified, and, since there is no case marking, it does not govern case.

1.2.5. Noun phrase

1.2.5.1. Operational definition for a noun phrase

The noun phrase is defined as the structural unit that can occur as the subject (241a), direct object (241a), or indirect object (241b) of the clause, as well as the argument of any prepositional phrase in the clause (241c).

1.2.5.2.5. Demonstratives as modifiers
There are two classes of demonstratives: spatial and temporal. They rarely follow other than the last noun of the clause. Spatial demonstratives can be divided into three classes. Cwa' ‘this (m/f)’ and ca' ‘this (n)’ refer to someone or something proximate to the speaker; ma' ‘that (any gender)’ refers to someone or something proximate to the hearer; and cwain ‘that (m/f)’ and cain ‘that (n)’ refer to someone or something far away (distal) from the interlocutors. There must be gender agreement where relevant between the noun and its demonstrative.

There are three temporal demonstratives that distinguish how long the person or thing referred to has been absent: paca' ‘that just occurred (always heard but never seen)’, cara ne ‘that recently absent’, and cara pane ‘that long absent’. It is hard to say whether ne and pane are actually part of the demonstrative. We have included them because they always accompany cara when used as a demonstrative (cara also occurs as a postverbal modifier, meaning ‘always’ or ‘forever’). Ne and pane are sentence-final temporal particles (‘recent past’ and ‘remote past’ respectively). There are no gender distinctions in temporal demonstratives.

1.2.5.2.6. Quantifiers

There is a set of collective particles that can precede any nominal construction: 'oro, mana, waram, 'oromon, and mon. They express the notion of plurality in a group. Their use is determined by the class of noun with which they can be used. Note the glosses of (254a), (256), (257) and (258) with the collective particles, where the notion of plurality in a group means a specific group, not just ‘old people’ or ‘men’ in general.
Mana can only precede some tree names and kinship terms using the Tenseless VICS:

(254) a.

mana

caxima

coll

palm:species

‘the grove of caxima palm trees’

(254) c.

mana

panxica

panxi-ca

coll

son-3sm

‘his sons’

Waram can precede all kinship terms in their first person singular form, as well as all inflections of -xi' noun kinship terms:

(255) a.

waram

'aji'

coll

older:brother:1s

(255) b.

waram

jim

xi-m

coll

mother-2s

‘your mothers/maternal aunts’

'Oromon can precede horon ‘old person’ and xojam' ‘young girl’:

(256) a.

'oromon

horon

coll

old:person

Wari' 152

Mon can precede tarama' ‘man’:

(257)

mon

coll

‘the men’

tarama’ man

'Oro can precede all other nouns and nominal constructions. Although collective particles express the notion of plurality in a group, 'oro often ranges over the individual members of a group to express a kind of ‘generic plural’, and in this function can mean ‘any’. Compare the use of mana in (254a) with the use of 'oro in (258b), where plurality of a specific group is contrasted with ‘generic plural’. Note also the use of 'oro with other nominal constructions in (258c–e).

Two words appear with nouns to express an adjectival meaning, which may also be used as preverbal modifiers: 'iri' ‘truly’ and wara ‘already’ render the meanings of ‘real or good’ and ‘old’ respectively; the verb jimao ‘different’ appears with only two nouns: it renders a generic meaning to wari' ‘person’ and carawa ‘animal or thing’; and the verb 'om ‘to not exist’ occurs with a few nouns, but this is rare.

1.2.5.3. Number of modifiers of a particular type which may co-occur

Two or more possessor modifiers (xi' nouns) may occur in an NP, though it is unlikely that more than two would occur. The second possessor can possess either the head or the first possessor.

(261) a. wijimain

The adjective-like preverbal modifiers, 'iri' ‘truly’ and wara ‘already’, may co-occur in a single noun phrase.

(262)

'iri'

wara

womu

1.2.5.4-5. Constraints on combinations of modifiers and order of the heads and various modifiers

There are no constraints on combinations of modifiers. The tendency, however, is to not overload a sentence, so it is rare that one would find more than three types of modifiers in a single sentence. Thus, (263b) would be preferred to (263a).

‘I found our long-absent older brother’s old writings, our long-absent older brother 'Orowao' who knew a lot, I found his writings.’

According to (263a), the order of elements in the NP is quantifier, adjective, head, possessor, relative clause, demonstrative. Either of the two nouns in apposition, cwajiri' or 'Orowao', could be considered the possessor.

1.3. COORDINATION

1.3.1. Means of expressing coordination
There are no simple equivalents of ‘and’-, ‘but’- and ‘or’-coordination, but there are ways to express this notion in the language. The constructions described here do not exclusively express a coordination relationship however. They have other functions and their form is simply 'exploited' to express coordination as well. Most of the examples in this section are taken from text.

1.3.1.1. ‘and’-coordination

There are two ways to accomplish the effect of ‘and’-coordination between clauses: (1) Juxtaposition: When two or more clauses are juxtaposed within a single sentence
or across sentence boundaries, ‘and’-coordination can be construed. The second and following clauses are often of the verbalized sequential sentence type described in 1.1.1.4.3.3.5.

1.3.1.2. 'but'-coordination There are two ways to express the effect of 'but'-coordination between clauses:

Wari' 158

(1) Juxtaposition of clauses

(266) Tomi' 'iricon.

(2) The use of contraexpective verbal modification clauses The only explicitly expressed ‘but’-coordination construction is the juxtaposition of a
clause manifesting the verb paxi' ‘to not find’ (meaning ‘frustrative’ in postverbal modification position), followed by the contraexpective clause, described in 1.1.2.4.2.8.

‘He wanted it, but they gave it (passed it on) (to someone else).’

1.3.1.3. ‘or’-coordination

The effect of ‘or’-coordination is accomplished in three ways. (1) The use of the irrealis verbal modification clause See 1.1.2.4.2.9, where this is described.

3sm INFL:irr

taraju taraji-u ear-1s

(2) The juxtaposition of mo conditional clauses, described in 1.1.2.4.2.5. This type of construction renders a general gloss like ‘either he will fish, or he will
hunt’.

‘Either he will fish, or he will hunt.’ (lit. ‘If he (says), “I will kill fish.” If he (says), “I will kill

Syntax 159

animals”.)

(3) The juxtaposition of clauses repeating the preverbal modifier 'am ‘finally’ or ‘perhaps’ in each clause
This renders a gloss of ‘either he will live or he will die’.

(270) 'Am

'e'

‘Either he will live, or he will die.’ (lit. ‘Perhaps he will live. Perhaps he will die.’)

1.3.1.4. ‘like’-coordination

Win ‘like’ or ‘same’ coordinates in the same way that 'ane ‘different’ (267) and 'am ‘perhaps’ (270) coordinate: win occurs as the leftmost member of a compound with the verb of the second clause, and Tenseless VICS must be used. See (271) and 1.1.2.4.2.7, where equative verbal modification clauses are discussed and illustrated.

non:Indian

this:m/f

‘Let’s make (do) a house right, like these non-Indians make (do) it right.’

1.3.2. Number of coordinators
The only coordinating element which can be repeated for (nearly) all of the conjuncts is an emphatic pronoun or third person form of the preposition when used to express ‘and’coordination of the nominal elements of the clause. In this case, all but the first element is accompanied by a ‘coordinator’. It is possible for an emphatic pronoun to accompany the first element, but this is rare. See (273) and (274) below.

1.3.3. Coordination of major categories of the sentence

Juxtaposition and/or the VP ca' na ‘thus it is/was’, which express ‘and’-coordination between clauses, can also be used to express ‘and’-coordination between nominal elements of the clause.
(1) Juxtaposition of the elements is illustrated in (272).

(2) Ca' na ‘thus it is/was’ is also used in conjunction with other means of expressing ‘and’-coordination of major elements of the sentence (e.g. with je in (273a)). It occurs at the end of the series. Note the example in (273a), where another noun was added after the series was ‘closed’ with ca' na; the last item was also ‘closed’ with ca' na. We have italicized the VPS ca' na in the examples below.

(3) Emphatic pronouns are used with a third person inflection of the preposition or the VP ca' na ‘thus it is/was’ to express ‘and’-coordination. The first and second person pronouns can occur alone in these constructions—see (272) and (273c), and a third person pronoun can occur with an appositional NP following it—see (273a), je 'itac 'itac, etc. See 2.1.2.1 for the list of emphatic pronouns.
(4) Third person inflections of the preposition (con ‘singular masculine’, cocon ‘plural masculine’, cam ‘singular feminine’, cacam ‘plural feminine’, and pain ‘neuter’) can also be used to express ‘and’-coordination between nominal elements of the clause. The literal meaning expressed by the third person inflections of the preposition is in fact comitative rather than ‘and'-coordination, but they are included here to exemplify another (pragmatic) means of expressing coordination. This is supported by the fact that singular VICS are used in the VPS with compound subjects or objects (see the examples in (274) below). The second and successive nouns must each be preceded by a preposition. Note the alternate form of cam in (274b): pacam. Both masculine and feminine third person inflections of the preposition sometimes occur in this form (paeon ‘singular masculine’, pacocon ‘plural masculine’, pacam ‘singular feminine’, pacacam ‘plural feminine’) when appearing as coordinators, but this is rare. Note also (274a), where the postverbal modifier wet ‘still’ appears in preverbal modification position. This is the only example we have of wet occurring in anything but postverbal modification position.

1.3.4. Coordination and accompaniment

See also 1.3.3(4), where we discuss the fact that ‘and’-coordination expressed by third person forms of the preposition could also be taken to mean comitative.

1.3.5. Structural parallelism in coordination

1.3.5.1. Coordination of nominal modifiers and participial constructions

Coordination of nominal modifiers and participial constructions is not found in text and is rejected as ungrammatical by most speakers. However, a few speakers do use such constructions in their speech, as illustrated in (279).

But we believe that these examples are in fact the result of an attempt to conform to Portuguese structures. This view is supported by the fact that Wan Hon (Joel), a relatively well-educated 'ON speaker who teaches in one of the Wari' schools, has told BK that these are, in fact, ungrammatical sentences in the language, and that he himself also believes that speakers only use such structures due to the influence of Portuguese. These notions expressed by coordination in Portuguese, and the examples in (279) above, can be expressed in 'ON by the use of relative clauses, as in the following examples:

1.3.5.2. Coordination of nouns and nominalized constructions

Coordination can be expressed between a noun and nominal construction by means of a third person form of the preposition (see the discussion 1.3.3.(4) above): noun and relative clause (281a), noun and derived noun (281b), and noun and noun clause (281c).

Adverbials cannot be coordinated.

1.3.5.4. Coordination of active and passive verbs Active and passive verbs cannot be coordinated.

1.3.5.5. Coordination of verb categories

There is no coordination of verbs. The only construction remotely like verb coordination is compounding. Compounding of various degrees of complexity are found—up to five. Here we illustrate the compounding of: two transitive verb roots (282a); two intransitive verb roots (282b); and an intransitive verb root plus a transitive verb root (282c). Compounding of a transitive plus an intransitive verb root results in a causative construction (282d). See 2.2.3 for the discussion of verb compounding.

1.3.6. Elements of the sentence that can be omitted under identity in coordination

Verbs may be omitted under identity in coordination, when using the VP ca' na ‘thus it is/was’ as the coordinator. Subjects and objects can also be omitted freely under identity in coordination. In fact, this is just part of a larger phenomenon where subjects or objects can be omitted freely when referenced on the VIC.

1.3.7. Elements of the noun phrase that can be omitted under identity in coordination

When using the VP ca' na ‘thus it is/was’ as a coordinator, nouns used as the possessor of a -xi' noun may be omitted under identity. This is, however, rare. (284b) is preferred to (284a).

Nouns in apposition to a kinship term cannot be omitted under identity in coordination. In fact, this type of coordination would not even occur in 'ON for cultural reasons, because the kinship term of the youngest people in the audience would be used, which would then necessarily have to apply to all present. Note the ungrammatical example in (285a).

1.4. NEGATION

1.4.1. Sentence negation

Sentence negation is expressed in three ways. (1) The COMP sentence, in which the verb 'om ‘to not exist’ appears as the operator
word in COMP, is the most common means of expressing sentence negation. Either ca ‘neuter realis past/present’, ta ‘realis future’ or xi ‘irrealis’ may be chosen as the INFL morpheme, and, like almost all COMP sentences, Tenseless VICS must be used. See the discussion of COMP sentences in 1.1.1.4.2 and the sets of contrasting positive/negative examples below.

Negative imperatives (prohibitives) are similar in form to the negative sentence that uses the realis future INFL morpheme ta illustrated in (289b), except that the operator word 'om is omitted. See 1.1.1.3.2 for the complete discussion of prohibitives. The example in (291) shows (289b) expressed as a prohibitive.

(3) The postverbal modifiers xi', 'a/'ara, and mao also express sentence negation. (i) Xi' ‘dubitative’ expresses negation with mild ridicule or criticism and is
accompanied by high intonation over the entire sentence, although peaks of intonation are lower than normal intonation patterns. Note (296b), where xi' could also be interpreted as the first person plural inclusive realis future VIC. Whether it is dubitative or the realis future VIC is clear only by intonation.

sentences. When it appears in simple sentences, using the realis past/present tense/mood, Tenseless VICS are obligatory—see 1.1.1.4.1.

When an irrealis marked sentence is spoken with interrogative intonation, it expresses the notion of ‘why?’, and the positive surface structure renders a negative gloss ((300a) and (301 a)), while the negative surface structure renders a positive gloss ((300b) and (301b)).

While 'om ‘to not exist’, as the leftmost member of a verb compound, is the most common way to express negation in COMP sentences and subordinate clauses, 'ara

Syntax 173

‘neg:p’ is frequently used in irrealis verbal modification clauses and in negative COMP sentences, to express double negation, as well as in certain cause clauses that employ double negation—see 1.1.2.4.2.4(3ii). See also 1.4.3, where its use is described in more detail in relation to double negation.

1.4.2. Constituent negation

Constituent negation is expressed by the same devices that express sentence negation. Compare, for example, the use of 'om ‘not exist’ as the leftmost member of the verb compound in a derived noun in (294a). It is possible for nouns to be negated by 'om outside of the VP, in which case 'om occurs without VICS before the noun. This is, however, rare. (303b) is preferred to (303a).

1.4.3. More than one negative element in a sentence

Any of the negation expressions described in 1.4.1 may itself be negated by the postverbal modifier 'a/'ara ‘negative’. The result of this double negation is an emphatic positive reading. While either 'a (singular, simple form) or 'ara (plural, intense form) may be used, 'ara is the form most likely to be chosen for use in double negatives because of its added meaning of intensity. Note (305d), where the combination of 'ara xi' (‘negative dubitative’) can be glossed as an emphatic positive or ‘because’ (see (137), cause clauses, 1.1.2.4.2.4(1)). Note also that when 'am occurs as the second negative with xi', it does not prohibit the use of the Tense VICS (see 1.1.1.4.1, where it is noted that 'a/'ara normally requires the use of Tenseless VICS).

We discuss the underlying negative meaning of the irrealis tense/mood in 1.4.1(3iii), following (299). The same principle of double negation works in all irrealis constructions: the already built-in negative (‘he should have done it, but he didn’t’) can be negated, so that the double negation renders an emphatic positive meaning, as in the simple sentence in (307a), the desiderative sentence in (307b) and the irrealis verbal modification clause in (307c).

Wari' 176

The negation of a verb in a subordinate clause cannot be expressed by the negation of the verb in a higher clause. Negation must be manifested within the clause containing the verb that is being negated.

1.5. ANAPHORA

1.5.1. Means of expressing anaphora

1.5.1.1. Deletion

Anaphora is expressed by deletion in the following circumstances: (1) deletion of the matrix clause in direct speech sentences; (2) deletion of any or all of the constituents except the verb in long discourses; (3) deletion of any or all of the main constituents other than the VICS in response to statements or questions; (4) deletion of any or all of the constituents other than the questioned element in answer to questions; and (5) deletion of the head of relative clauses.
(1) Deletion of the matrix clause in direct speech sentences Direct speech occurs as the derived predicate of a verbalized direct speech sentence (see 1.1.1.1). Subject VICS mark the speaker, and object VICS (suffixes) mark to whom or of whom the speech is made. The matrix clause (all elements other than the embedded speech) is often deleted in narrative discourse. This is especially common when recounting a dialogue. The example in (308) is taken from text.

(2) Deletion of any or all of constituents except the verb in long discourses As in the deletion of the matrix clause in direct speech sentences, all of the
constituents other than the verb (including the VICS) can be deleted in long discourses. The deletion of constituents other than the verb seems to be a device used in thematic marking in the language—see 1.12.2. See (177) for examples of this type of deletion.
(3) Deletion of all of the main constituents of a sentence other than the VICS All of the main constituents of a sentence other than the VICS can be deleted when a question is used to respond to a statement (see 1.1.1.2.4.2).

1.5.1.3. Demonstrative pronoun anaphora

Wari' 180

Anaphora can also be expressed by the use of demonstrative pronouns. Demonstrative pronouns only occur in the third person; thus this type of anaphora only occurs with third person referents. See 2.1.2.2 for the complete list of demonstrative pronouns. Demonstrative pronouns appear as anaphora in two ways.
(1) In narrative discourse, the identity of the main characters is introduced by their name or an NP, being referred to thereafter by the VICS, forms of the preposition, and suffixes on possessed nouns. When the identity of the main characters is well known to the interlocutors, they are often referred to via demonstrative pronouns, rather than nonpronominal NPS. Demonstrative pronouns can also be used to indicate change of focus. The object in (317c) is a dead person; dead people are referred to by plural markers, therefore ‘…caught them’):

Syntax 181

(2) The more common anaphoric use of demonstrative pronouns is as ‘vocal pause’ when ‘stumbling’ in speech, similar to ‘uh’ in English. The example in (318) was taken from text. The demonstrative pronouns are italicized.

1.5.1.4. Reflexive pronoun anaphora

There are no formal reflexive pronouns, but there are reflexive VICS (see 1.6), the third person (NP) antecedents of which can be deleted, just like antecedents of other VICS.

‘He cut himself.’

1.5.1.5. Special anaphoric pronouns
Neuter demonstratives can be used anaphorically. There is some question as to whether the demonstrative in (320) is simply a demonstrative or actually a demonstrative pronoun. It is very possible that it is the latter, the specific gender marker 'i, which would make it such, being dropped in rapid speech.

1.5.1.6. Anaphoric function of referent particle quem

The main function of the particle quem, which is frequently used, seems to be anaphoric to something already mentioned or implied in the discourse. It can, however, also be given the gloss of ‘also’. Native speakers frequently translate it as ‘also’ when they speak Portuguese, using the Portuguese word também ‘also’ when they would use quem in 'ON. The result is an overuse of the word também in Portuguese. (321d) illustrates how some native speakers would translate (321a).

The clauses in (325a) occur as juxtaposed sentences; the antecedent of pain ‘third person neuter preposition’ (in the third sentence) is mijac ‘pig’ (in the first). In (325b), the first sentence precedes the second by eight sentences; the antecedent of the third person neuter suffix of cwerein ‘its body’ (in the second clause) is mijac ‘pig’ in the first.

1.6.1. Means of expressing reflexivity

1.6.1.1. Invariable reflexive person marking morphemes Invariable reflexive person marking morphemes do not occur.

1.6.1.2. Variable reflexive person marking morphemes

There is a set of reflexive verbal inflectional clitics that mark for person, number and third person gender. They do not mark for tense/mood. Like all other VICS, they immediately follow the verb. See the chart of VICS in 2.1.3.6.2.2, where we classify reflexives as belonging to the object nonactive set of VICS. Like other VICS, reflexives are not pronouns; they cannot replace nominals in the sentence. They can appear wherever Tense and Tenseless VICS can appear, in all sentence types; for example, in simple declarative sentences (326a), in COMP negative sentences (326b), and in verbalized comparative sentences (326c). Note that the inflection of the set of reflexive VICS is identical to that of -xi' nouns whose roots end with e—see 3.4.1.3. The complete paradigm of reflexive VICS is as follows:

1.6.2. Scope of reflexivity

As with all VICS, the antecedent of the reflexive element does not have to be in the same clause. It can occur in the same clause with the reflexive element, or in another clause.

1.6.6. Reflexive relations in nominalized clauses Reflexive relations may not occur in nominalized clauses without any deviations.

1.6.7. Reflexive relations in noun phrases Reflexives do not occur in noun phrases.

1.6.8. Reflexives without overt antecedents
Reflexive VICS may occur without overt antecedents, but the antecedent must be recoverable in the context. See 1.6.2.

1.6.9. Other uses of reflexive forms The plural forms of reflexive indicators also express the reciprocal relation. See 1.7.

1.7. RECIPROCALS

1.7.1. Means of expressing reciprocality

The reciprocal relation, as noted in the preceding section, is expressed by the plural forms of the reflexive VICS. The use of the reflexive VICS is described in 1.6.

Reciprocals, reflexives, and passive constructions all share a common discourse function—they reduce the topicality difference between the agentas-subject and the object-as-patient (goal, theme, etc.). The passive (see 2.1.3.1.1) does this by promoting the agreement expressed as an object in the active construction to the subject of the passive. The agent is removed, i.e. is not expressed overtly, in a passive clause. Reciprocals and reflexives reduce the topicality of the agent-as-subject by equating agent with the object upon which it acts in the VIC. That is, a reflexive/reciprocal VIC eliminates the subject-object distinction by failing (like the passive, but unlike the active) to distinguish between subject and object in agreement. Since 'ON lacks case marking and only distinguishes between subject and (primary) object via the VIC (other objects are marked by the preposition), obliteration of any subject-object VIC distinction effectively means that subject=object topically and semantically. This in effect increases the relative prominence of nonsubject arguments. So for example, in (333), the duck referenced by con ‘prep:3sm’ is the topic of the paragraph from which (333) was taken. In the (embedded) clause in which it occurs, there is no distinctive reference to the subject, only the reflexive VIC.

‘“Give it to me, I will raise (it)”, (said) Maxun. He took it from him.’ (lit. ‘…they took it from each other.’)

In (334), dead people cannot be agents and so dead people cannot be expressed in the most highly topical agent-as-subject form. But the reciprocal translation (‘they did not eat each other’) obliterates the syntactic distinction between subject (the ones doing the eating) and the object (the dead people). The use of reflexive/reciprocal here promotes ‘dead people’ to the role of grammatical actor, indicating that it is in focus. (334) is from a report of several deaths during the initial contact with non-Indian society. Note the use

Syntax 189

of the third person neuter reflexive in the third clause; the gender of homacacam ‘their fat’ is neuter (the Wari' people used to eat their dead):

1.8. COMPARISON

1.8.1. Means of expressing comparison

There are three ways in which comparison can be expressed (see also 2.1.4.4–5): (1) By juxtaposed positive/negative sentences

(336) a. Cut

tamana main.

'Om

(2) By juxtaposed positive/positive sentences, the second showing a greater degree or emphasis in the VP

(337) 'Awi

pije' na

cona.

'Awi tamana pan na

arrow-3sm elder:brother:1s

‘My older brother’s arrow is better than mine.’ (lit. ‘My arrow is a little good. My older brother’s arrow is very good.’)

(3) By certain verb compounds Such verbs as tiquin' mao ‘to continue on’, tiquin' ca' ‘to pass up’, juc 'in pin ‘to push
away’, and the preverbal modifier 'amon ‘diminutive’, all help express the notion of comparative. Sentences using these verbs and preverbal modifier are still often accompanied by the juxtaposition of similar or contrasting sentences. See (336b) for an example of the preverbal modifier 'amon expressing comparison.

1.8.2-4. Omission of elements under identity
Where comparison is expressed by juxtaposing similar or contrasting sentences, the elements of the first sentence are always repeated (with appropriate inflectional changes) in the second sentence.

1.8.5. Types of comparative structures 'ON only has the types of comparative structures described in 1.8.1 and 1.8.6.

1.8.6. Correlative comparison

Correlative comparison is expressed by repetition and the juxtaposition of contrasting sentences. The following example is a passage taken from a legend about the birth of the sun. The top of the child’s head was the sun. As he grew, the sun produced more and more light, until there was plenty of sunlight (‘the more he grew, the brighter it got’). Note the use of repetition in the first three clauses, and particularly the repetitive use of comparative sentences in the fourth to the seventh clauses (first the child’s growth, then the sun’s growth), to express the progressive action of the steadily increasing growth and light.

As (the top of his head) grew. It became completely and sufficiently day. That’s it.’)

1.9. EQUATIVE

1.9.1. Means of expressing equative

There are two ways in which equative can be expressed (see also 2.1.4.4). (1) By the use of constructions employing the verb 'ac ‘like’ This can happen in four
ways. (i) 'Ac can occur as the leftmost member of a verb compound with a denominalized
verb.

(340) a.

'Ac

(2) By juxtaposed positive/positive sentences Such sentences are often followed by the VP ca' na ‘thus it is/was’, which is a way of
expressing ‘and’-coordination—see 1.3.1.1.

‘Xijam is as big as 'Orowao'.’ (lit. ‘Xijam is big. 'Orowao' is also big, thus it is.’)

1.10. POSSESSION
1.10.1. Sentences expressing possession Possession is expressed by the use of two verbs: ma' ‘to exist’, and 'om ‘to not exist’. Although these verbs are similar to English have and have not, they differ in the

Wari' 194

grammatical relations assigned to possessor and possessed NPS. In 'ON, the possessor is expressed as an (oblique) object.

(345) a.

Ma'

napa' na-pa'

xirim.

exist

3s:rp/p-1s

house

‘I have a house.’ (lit. ‘A house exists to me.’)

(345) b. 'Om

wom.

not:exist

3s:rp/p-2s

cotton

‘You do not have a dress.’ (lit. ‘A dress does not exist to you.’)

When third person NP objects are overtly expressed in sentences in which ma' ‘to exist’ or 'om ‘to not exist’ appear as the verb, a deviation of the normal vos pattern of the language usually occurs: the overtly expressed subject usually precedes the object. In the following pairs of examples (a), with a vso order, is preferred to (b), which has a vos order.

See 1.2.5.2.3, where the structure of possessed NPS is discussed and illustrated, and 2.1.1.4.6, where the means of expressing possession in NPS is discussed and illustrated.

See 2.1.1.4.6.1.

1.10.2. Alienable and inalienable possession

Syntax 195

1.10.3. Temporary and permanent possession There is no difference between temporary and permanent possession.

1.10.4. Possession relative to persons, animals and things
There is no difference in the expression of possession relative to persons, animals and things. The gender of the possessor for all of these must be indicated in the NIC or the third person possessive suffix for -xi' nouns.

1.10.5. Present and past possession

There is no formal difference between present and past possession. Past possession can be distinguished by the use of the temporal demonstratives described in 1.2.5.2.5.

1.11. EMPHASIS

1.11.1. Sentence emphasis

1.11.1.1. Noncontradictory sentence emphasis
Many of the ways of expressing noncontradictory sentence emphasis employ a kind of direct address, in which the hearer is either invited to comment on the situation which evoked the emphatic statement, or is acknowledged to have an opinion about it. Not all forms of noncontradictory sentence emphasis involve direct address however.

1.11.1.1.1. Noncontradictory sentence emphasis involving direct address

(1) By the use of emphatic particles spoken in isolation There are two emphatic particles spoken in isolation, which can be translated roughly
as ‘hey, you’. They are used to get someone’s attention. Wira is used by men when addressing men; cama is used by women when addressing women.

(2) By the use of second person realis future VICS See 1.1.1.2.1.2 for a full description of the function of leading questions and a
discussion of their forms in relation to realis future VICS. While ra ‘2s:rf’ is nonspecific, ron ‘2s:rf-3sm’, ram ‘2s:rf-3sf’, rain ‘2s:rf-3n’, roron ‘2s:rf-3pm’ and raram ‘2s:rf-3pf’ specify the gender of the element to which they refer.

The second person realis future VICS described in the previous paragraph, ron and ram, may be followed by two emphatic morphemes: ma, when spoken by men, or 'e', when spoken by women. Ron is used when addressing a male audience (singular or plural); and ram is used when addressing a female audience (singular or plural). Ma is not to be confused with ma' ‘that proximate to hearer’.

(3) By the use of the emphatic verbalized sentence described in 1.1.1.4.3.3.4 The effect of the emphatic sentence, after having made the statement, is understood as
‘…and you better believe it’, or ‘You can say that again’, where the hearers seem to be invited to agree with the statement evoking emphasis.

1.11.1.1.2. Noncontradictory sentence emphasis not involving direct address

(1) By the use of emphatic phrases The use of some sentence-final emphatic phrases causes certain morphological
changes in the sentence: ca'/ma' quira and ca'/ma' 'ira, consisting of a demonstrative followed by an emphatic morpheme, require the use of Tenseless VICS in the VP. Ca'/ma' quira and ca'/ma' 'ira can be spoken by both men and women.

(2) By the use of sentence-final emphatic morphemes There are some restrictions in the use of sentence final emphatic morphemes: wira and
nowa are used only by men speakers (354a–b); cama/ camara and je are used only by women speakers (354c–d); (cama is used when addressing one woman; tacamara is used when addressing more than one woman); and wa (354e) may be used by both men and women speakers, although usually only men use it.

Wa (spoken by men and women) and je (spoken by women) seem to be derived from the interjections howa (spoken by men) and hije (spoken by women). It is interesting to note that howa also functions as a verb, meaning ‘to believe’.
(3) By the use of double negation See 1.4.3 for a complete description and examples of the use of double negatives to express a strong, emphasized positive. (4) By the use of the desiderative verbalized sentence described in 1.1.1.4.3.3.2

(5) By the combined use of xi' ‘dubitative’, Tenseless VICS and certain sentence-final spatial/temporal morphemes (ca' ‘this neuter proximate to speaker’, ma' ‘that proximate to hearer’, ne ‘recent past’ or pane ‘remote past’)
Although xi' expresses doubt or supposition in the emphatic verbalized sentence given in (352) above, it seems to express certainty in its use here. This means of expressing emphasis is used mainly as a supportive commentary on what has already been said, either by the same speaker or another speaker. It also seems to be a device used when there has been a diversion, to bring the hearers back to the subject at hand.

(6) By repetition of the sentence

Wari' 200

In this case the first word of each sentence is often spoken with high intonation and exaggeratedly lengthened vowel (359a). Sometimes the ‘repetition’ is expressed in contrasting sentences, as in (359b). We mention this here, because this phenomenon shares with repetition the function of building redundancy into the text.

1.11.2. Constituent emphasis 1.11.2.1. Means of expressing constituent emphasis

Syntax 201

1.11.2.1.1. Emphasis by stress

Constituent emphasis may only occur on verb stems and nouns of the sentence. It is

commonly expressed by increased intensity and higher pitch on the stressed syllable of the constituent marked by [1] in the examples below. Emphasis by stress is not permitted

on VICS. Note the ungrammatical example in (361c). Such emphasis must be expressed

by either the emphatic postverbal modifier pan, described in 1.11.2.1.2, or by the

movement of the emphasized element to the beginning of the sentence as an emphatic

pronoun, as described in 1.11.2.1.3.

1.11.2.1.2. Emphatic verbal modifier

The postverbal modifier pan indicates emphasis on the subject. There is not normally any undue change of stress or pitch on the subject when pan is used. The function of pan is to clarify the identity of the subject in a particular context. In the following example, it was not clear from the preceding context for all the interlocutors, who had danced.

3p:rp/p

children

‘The children danced.’

Pan also has a potentially related meaning, which includes the notion of ‘now’, ‘at the moment’, or ‘for the time being’. It seems to ask for clarification about location (363a) or give clarifying information about location (363b).

1.11.2.1.3. Emphasis by movement

Subjects and objects occur postverbally in all regular clauses, and movement within the clause is rare. There is, however, a means of expressing emphasis on the subject or object by the use of emphatic pronouns followed by relative clauses. The emphasized element occurs in (or ‘is moved to’) initial position in the sentence, i.e. COMP, as in (364).
When the emphasized element is the subject, it is also expressed anaphorically in the VIC of the relative clause (364b). The effect of this sentence type is equivalent to clefting in English. Note that the example in (364a) is, in fact, a kind of copular sentence—see 1.2.1.1.

Alternatively, an emphatic pronoun with or without an appositional NP (noun or demonstrative pronoun) can be verbalized and followed by a headless relative clause, as in (365a–d). A COMP phrase headed by je can never be followed by a VIC however (365e). We have no other account for this fact, except to speculate that, although je may occur as the rightmost member of a verb compound (365f), it may not be verbalized in a COMP phrase.

1.11.2.1.7. Emphasis by repetition

Just as sentence emphasis can be expressed by repetition, so emphasis of the verb can be expressed by repetition. This may be in the form of reduplication of a syllable of the verb (366a), reduplication of a verb root (366b), reduplication of part or all of a compound verb stem (366c–d), or reduplication of the entire verb+VIC (366e). Reduplication of a syllable of a verb derives plural and intensive meaning from singular, simple verbs (see 2.2.4 and 3.4.7).

1.11.2.1.8. Combination of ways of expressing constituent emphasis

Increased loudness and higher pitch on the emphasized constituent, the emphatic postverbal modifier pan, emphatic pronouns followed by relative clauses, and verbal reduplication may all be combined to express constituent emphasis.

1.11.2.2. Elements which may be emphasized
1.11.2.2.1. Noun phrases Any NP may be emphasized by increased loudness and higher pitch on the head of the phrase. NPS in the subject or object position of the sentence may be emphasized by the postverbal modifier pan. If emphasis is desired on both subject and object simultaneously, the subject will be marked by pan and the object by increased loudness and pitch. NPS may also be emphasized by co-occurrence with emphatic pronouns preceding a relative clause. See 1.11.2.1.1–3.
1.11.2.2.2. Nominal modifiers

Syntax 205

Nominal modifiers do not occur. This notion is expressed by verbal modifiers (see 1.2.1.3).

1.11.2.2.3. Verbs Verbs may be emphasized by reduplication, as described in 1.11.2.1.7.

1.11.2.2.4. Verbal modifiers

We have only one example of a verbal modifier that is emphasized by means of reduplication (as part of a compound verb) (368a). Other preverbal modifiers and all postverbal modifiers can only be emphasized by repeating the entire compounded verb (368b–c).

1.11.2.3. Movement of emphasized elements

Where movement is involved (see 1.11.2.1.3), nothing is left behind when the emphasized element is the object of the verb (not even a VIC reference); the subject is anaphorically marked in the VIC. Passivization of the construction prior to left dislocation can only be done by wa ‘infinitive’, as in (370), not the normal passive VIC. The only elements which can be left dislocated are those which could be referenced on the VIC, as per our discussion in 1.2.1.2.3. However, only subjects can be referenced in the VIC after left dislocation; objects may never be.

1.11.3. The focus of yes-no questions

The focus of neutral yes-no questions is marked by increased loudness and higher pitch on the stressed syllable of the element in focus (see 1.11.2.1.1). The focus of leading yesno questions is marked by the use of second person realis future VICS (see 1.1.1.2.1.2), where a positive question expects a negative answer, and vice versa. Only the subject can be focused in this manner. So in (373a), for example, ron indicates that the focus is on Xijam, and in (373b), ram indicates that the focus is on third person singular feminine.

1.12. TOPIC AND THEMATIC MARKING
In this section we discuss means for indicating discourse topics or signalling events on the main thematic line of a discourse.
The majority of sentences express only the grammatical relations of subject, object, indirect object or oblique object, but these individual grammatical relations may be topicalized by a small range of strategies. These devices are used to indicate topic and the main event line of the text.

(2) Important series of events on the main event line are often organized chronologically, where a statement is made about what will happen, then a statement is made that it was accomplished, for example,’ “I will get fever”, she said, then she got fever.’ The clauses displaying this chronological organization are italicized in the following examples.

(3) Sentence-final or sentence-initial repetition of the verb (or relevant portion of the verb stem) without VICS. The repeated verb element is italicized in the following examples. Like the other strategies of this section, this repetition is used to indicate material central to the main event line.

1.13. HEAVY SHIFT
There is no evidence of heavy shift in the language. The tendency is for short sentences, so there are usually no cumbersome constructions to deal with.

1.14. OTHER MOVEMENT PROCESSES
We are not aware of any movement processes other than what has already been described in 1.11 and 1.12.

1.15. MINOR SENTENCE TYPES

There are three categories of minor sentence types which diverge from the regular vos sentence structure. These are: (1) exclamatory; (2) VIC sentences; and (3) ideophonic.
(1) Exclamatory sentences include short, nonverbal responses of one or two words, vocatives, and utterances consisting of noun phrases. Vocatives may also be part of normal sentence structure.

(381) a.

'Iri'o'?

‘Really?’

(2) VIC sentences are characterized by the presence of a VIC without a verb. The VIC may occur alone or with a sentence-final particle (382a–b) or an inflected form of the preposition (382c) (these three examples are responses to questions or statements); see, however, (382d), in which there is a subject in the form of a noun clause, and (382e), where a coordinated construction serves as the subject of the clause. The VIC sentence appears as a direct speech in (382e). (382d–e) are ‘closures’ to discourses. Structurally, it could be said that these sentences are the matrix clauses of complex direct speeches, i.e. the entire discourses.

(382) a.

Na?

‘Is it (so)?’ (expression of sympathy)

Syntax 215

(3) Ideophonic sentences consist of sequences of (though, occasionally, individual) onomatopoeic morphemes. They sometimes occur as constituents of compound verbs, accompanied by VICS, in which case they can be interpreted as direct speeches. Many recognized verbs also have an onomatopoeic ring to them, and in this connection, it can be said that their occurrence in sequences of two or three to as many as fifteen or twenty verbs, without VICS, are further examples of ideophonic sentences. (383) was taken from a story of the origin of fire. The boys, in the form of birds, were carrying the fire; when someone called them, they were startled and flew away. The ideophonic elements are in the last sequence of paratactic clauses.

1.16. OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS FOR WORD CLASSES
1.16.1. Noun
Nouns may be distinguished by the following morphological criteria: (i) they may bear possessive suffixes or NICS—see 2.1.1.4.6; and (ii) they may be followed by any one of the spatial/temporal demonstratives—see 1.2.5.2.5 (note that only two of the demonstratives, ca' ‘this (neuter) proximate to speaker’ and ma' ‘that proximate to hearer’, and one of the temporal demonstratives, cara ‘absent’, though without its accompanying temporal particle, may follow a verb). Besides these morphological characteristics, the following syntactic criteria apply to nouns: (iii) they may appear alone as subject or object of the verb, (iv) they may appear as the complement of a form of the preposition—see 1.2.4; and (v) they may occur in sequence with another noun in a possessed NP, in which the second element (possessor) can be any noun except a derived noun, and the first NP is marked by the possessive marking suffixes or NICS referred to above (functioning semantically as either an actually possessed element or a nominal modifier—see 1.2.5.2.3).
1.16.2. Pronoun
There are two classes of pronouns: (1) demonstrative and (2) emphatic. (1) The demonstrative pronoun is a subclass of nouns. It satisfies three of the syntactic
criteria that define the noun: (i) it may appear by itself as the subject or object of the verb;

Wari' 216
(ii) it may appear by itself as the complement of a form of the preposition; and (iii) it may appear as the second element (possessor) of a possessed NP. It is different from nonpronominal nouns, however, in that it cannot be suffixed or postposed by an NIC or possessive marking suffix, nor can it be followed by a demonstrative.
(2) The emphatic pronoun is not a subclass of nouns. It cannot occur by itself as the subject or object of the verb, nor can it appear as the complement of a form of the preposition. It is marked by its potential to occur alone (in the case of first and second person) or in apposition to a noun or demonstrative pronoun (in the case of third person) in coordinate constructions (see 1.3.3) or to express emphasis (see 1.11.2.1.3).
1.16.3. Verb The verb is the main predicate constituent of all major sentence types. It is marked by the following morphological criteria: (i) its potential to be compounded with a verbal modifier or with another verb; and (ii) that it may be followed by verbal inflectional clitics. There are two additional subclasses of verbs, which we label verbal modifiers. These are like main verbs, except they may only occur in compounded verbs (see 1.16.7). There are usually slight semantic differences in the meanings of verbs when compounded in nonhead position.
1.16.4. Nominal modifier Nominal modifiers do not occur as a separate word class. See 1.16.1.
1.16.5. Preposition The preposition is marked by its function as the head of the prepositional phrase, which may occur as any nonsubject argument of the verb. It can occur alone (inflected for the person, number and gender of its object) or with a complement, which may be a simple noun or derived noun—see 1.2.4.
1.16.6. Numeral/quantifier Numeral/quantifiers are collective particles that precede nouns and derived nouns—see 1.2.5.2.6.
1.16.7. Verbal modifiers Verbal modifiers are a subclass of verb roots. They can only appear in compound verbs. They are divided into two classes: (1) preverbal, which are marked by their occurrence preceding the main verb root; and (2) postverbal, which follow the main verb root immediately before the VIC, modulo compounding (see 2.2.3).

Syntax 217
1.16.8. Inflectional clitics There are two classes of inflectional clitics: (1) verbal inflectional clitics, or VICS, which are marked for person, number and, in some cases, tense/ mood and third person gender of subjects and objects—see 2.1.3.6.2.2; and (2) possessive nominal inflectional clitics, or NICS, which mark person, number, and third person gender, appear in derived nouns and may also follow unpossessed nouns—see 2.1.1.4.6.
1.16.9. Particles Particles are simple (i.e. phonological) clitics that generally occur at or near the end of the sentence—see 2.1.8.
1.16.10. INFL morphemes INFL morphemes cliticize to the verb in COMP sentences, noun clauses and derived nouns (see 2.1.8.1.9) and express tense/mood and sometimes gender of the element in COMP (whether overt or covert).
1.16.11. Operator words Operator words are a small class of words that appear in COMP in COMP sentences— see 2.1.8.1.10.
1.16.12. Ideophones Ideophones are onomatopoeic words that express the sound of actions. Many ideophones deviate from phonological norms of the language: (1) some employ phonological units not found elsewhere in the language; (2) vowels are often exaggeratedly lengthened; and (3) varied intonation is often employed: high, low, whispered, etc. See 4.1.

2.1. INFLECTION

2.1.1. Noun inflection
Aside from the marking discussed under 2.1.1.1.1 and 2.1.1.1.3, there are no other ways, other than in kinship terms (see 2.2.2.2.1.5), for directly marking noun functions on the noun. But in what follows, we indicate how the different functions are expressed.

2.1.1.1. Means by which the syntactic and semantic functions of noun phrases are expressed

2.1.1.1.1. Bound affixes
Bound affixes consist of (1) a set of possessive suffixes, which mark the person, number, and third person gender of the possessor on -xi' nouns-see 2.1.1.4.6; and (2) a prefix, co-, which marks the derivational process whereby certain kinship terms are formed—see 2.2.2.2.1.5.

2.1.1.1.2. Morphophonemic alterations
Internal morphophonemic alterations to express syntactic and semantic functions in the noun phrase do not occur.

2.1.1.1.3. Nominal inflectional clitics
A set of possessive nominal inflectional clitics mark person, number, and third person gender of the possessor. They follow the free form of most nouns, and they function in derived nouns—see 2.1.1.4.6 and 2.2.2.2.

2.1.1.1.4. Prepositions

The single (inflected) preposition marks the theme/patient NP when a goal is present, and marks oblique objects to the verb—see 1.2.1.2.2–4.

2.1.1.1.5. Constituent order
Constituent order is useful (but not foolproof) in distinguishing subject, direct object and indirect object (in each of which only third person may be overtly expressed). The basic order of constituents in a transitive/ intransitive clause is verb, object (or object-like argument), subject; in a ditransitive clause, it is verb, direct object, indirect object, subject—see 1.2.1.2. However, as noted in section 1.2.1.2.6, order may vary, so referencing of the grammatical relation on the VIC or NIC is a more reliable means for distinguishing NP functions. Most clauses do not have overtly expressed subjects or objects; they are simply expressed in the VICS. Many clauses have only one overtly expressed constituent (subject or object), while both are expressed in the VIC, and in these clauses, word order is not sufficient to determine whether the constituent is subject or object, and ambiguity can result. The postverbal modifier pan, marking subject emphasis, or the use of alternate VICS (i.e. passive or reciprocal mor-phemes) can help disambiguate such structures—see 1.11.2.1.2 and 1.7. Sometimes ambiguity cannot be avoided and can only be resolved by context.

2.1.1.1.6. Derivational processes

Derived nouns can function as the subject (385a), direct object (385b), or oblique object of the verb (385c). They can also function as nominal modifiers, much the same way that -xi' nouns do (385d).

2.1.1.1.7. Combinations

Any or all of the means of expressing syntactic and semantic noun phrases described above may be combined, except that the distribution of the bound affixes described in 2.1.1.1.1 and the possessive marking nominal inflectional clitics described in 2.1.1.1.4 are mutually exclusive.

2.1.1.2. Means for expressing syntactic functions
2.1.1.2.1. Subject of intransitive verb
The subject of an intransitive verb is (usually) marked on the VIC. (The VIC is sometimes deleted in series of actions in discourses.) Third person subject may also be overtly expressed by an NP—see 1.2.1.2.1. Like the direct object of a transitive verb, the subject of an intransitive verb governs the number agreement on suppletive or reduplicated verb forms: a plural intransitive subject requires the plural form of the intransitive verb (a plural object requires the plural form of a transitive verb)—see 2.1.3.6.1.1. There is no distinction between subjects of intransitive verbs as agent or nonagent.

Morphology 221

2.1.1.2.2. Subject of transitive verb
The subject of a transitive verb is (usually) marked on the VIC. Third person subject may also be overtly expressed by an NP—see 1.2.1.2.1. The number of the subject of a transitive verb does not govern plural marking on the verb—see 2.3.1.6.1.1. The form of the overtly expressed subject of a transitive verb is the same as that of an overtly expressed direct object, unless there is an indirect object in the sentence, in which case the (erstwhile) direct object occurs in a prepositional phrase—see 1.2.1.2.3.1. When both subject and object are overtly expressed, the subject almost always follows the object— see 1.2.1.2.6. There is no distinction between subjects of transitive verbs as agent and nonagent.

2.1.1.2.3. Subject of copular constructions
Copular constructions do not exist, but see 1.2.1.1, for what we consider a functionally similar 'ON construction.

2.1.1.2.4. Direct object
The direct object is optionally marked on the VIC. Third person object may also be overtly expressed by an NP. When an indirect object is in the sentence, whether overtly expressed or merely marked in the VIC, the direct object may be referenced by an inflected preposition (or simply understood from context)—see 1.2.1.2.2–3. There is no change in the form of the overtly expressed object when the subject is not overtly expressed. Like the subject of intransitive verbs, the object of transitive verbs governs number agreement on the verb—see 2.1.3.6.2–4.

See 1.2.1.2.3.

2.1.1.2.5. Indirect object

2.1.1.2.6. Object of comparison
Comparison is expressed by means of juxtaposed sentences that show contrasts. The object of comparison is often the subject or object of such verbs as tiquin' mao ‘to go on’, tiquin' ca' ‘to pass up’ and juc 'in pin ‘to push away’ in the last of the contrasting sentences—see 1.1.2.4.2.7.

2.1.1.2.7. Object of equation

Equation is expressed by means of the verb 'an xiho' ‘to imitate’ (387a) or by verb 'ac ‘to be like’ occurring as the leftmost member of a compound with a noun or emphatic pronoun (387b–c), or as the operator word in the verbalized comparative clause described in 1.1.1.4.3.3.6.

The verb win ‘to be like’ or ‘to be the same’, described in 1.1.2.4.2.7, usually equates only on a clause level. It can be interpreted, however, to equate on a word level in some contexts, as in (388), repeated here from (155c), where it occurs in a relative clause.

2.1.1.2.8. Other objects governed by verbs
For discussion of how other grammatical relations are expressed, see 1.2.1.2.4, 1.3, and 1.2.4.

2.1.1.2.9. Complement of copular construction Complements of copular constructions are discussed in 1.2.1.1.

2.1.1.2.10. Subject complement

Like the notion of copular construction, the notion of subject complement is also expressed as an intransitive verb. There is no difference in the means of expressing the notion of copular complements and subject complements.

2.1.1.2.11. Object complement

The notion of object complement is expressed by what would be the object complement appearing as the second member of a compound verb.

2.1.1.2.12. Objects governed by adjectives

Objects are not governed by adjectives. The notion of ‘to be like something or someone’ is expressed by the verb 'an xiho' ‘to imitate’ (lit. ‘to take together’) that expresses object of equation—see 2.1.1.2.7, (387a). Its negative form expresses the notion of ‘to be different from something or someone’.

2.1.1.2.13. Agent in passive constructions Agent is never expressed in passive constructions.
2.1.1.2.14. Topic Topic noun phrases are marked by left dislocation. The head of the phrase is often repeated in the main clause. The noun phrase is not specially marked. See 1.12.
2.1.1.2.15. Emphasis There is no inflection for emphasis in the language. Means of emphasizing NPS are discussed in 1.11.

Wari' 224

2.1.1.3. Syntactic functions in relation to nonfinite forms
Just as with the nouns discussed above, there is no special inflection for nonfinite or nominalized verbs with regard to nominal grammatical function. See 1.1.2.3.

2.1.1.4. Means of expressing nonlocal semantic functions

2.1.1.4.1. Benefactive

Benefactive NPS are licensed by the verb mi' ‘to give’, appearing as the last member of a verb compound. Mi' adds a benefactive or goal argument to the array of arguments normally assigned by the root to its immediate left. The added argument is expressed as a surface direct object - see 1.2.1.2.3.

2.1.1.4.2. Source

Morphology 225

2.1.1.4.3. Instrumental

There is no instrumental case. Instrument is expressed by the preverbal modifier mam ‘instrument’. The element with which it is related occurs in a prepositional phrase following the direct object of the verb.

(396)

Mam

wac 'inon 'ina-on

hwam

instr

cut

1s:rp/p-3sm

fish

prep:3n

knife

‘I cut the fish with a knife.’

Instrument may be expressed without mam, although this is much less common:

(397)

?Wac

'inon 'ina-on

hwam

pain

quit.

cut

1s:rp/p-3sm

‘I cut the fish with a knife.’

Negative instrument must be expressed by negating a positive instrumental statement, followed by a parallel positive statement. Instrumental, as the preverbal modifier mam and a prepositional phrase, may occur in both statements.

2.1.1.4.4. Comitative

Comitative is expressed by the verb jajao ‘together’. The comitative NP is its direct object.

'inam

younger:sibling:1s

‘My younger sister accompanied me.’

Wari' 226

Comitative is also expressed by a compound verb, in which jajao precedes the verb root. When this happens, the comitative NP must appear in a prepositional phrase. This may be due to the fact that the addition of another verb adds a goal argument, though covert in the examples in our corpus. On the other hand, this is somewhat speculative, because there are no examples in the corpus of jajao occurring with a goal when compounded with another verb, whether intransitive or transitive, and the example in (400b) was said to be ungrammatical by a native speaker. At this point, we do not have a final account of these facts.

Comitative is also expressed by the postverbal modifier wi ‘together’ in a compound verb. While there is no evidence in the corpus that a compound verb with wi can occur with a direct object marked on the VIC, we do not believe it would be ill-formed to mark the direct object on the VIC, as in (401b) and (401d).

Comitative is also expressed by an inflected form of the preposition in ‘and’coordination—see 1.3.3(4), examples (274).
Negative comitative is expressed by using the verb jajao in a negative construction.

2.1.1.4.5. Circumstance
Circumstance is also expressed by the preverbal modifier mam (see instrumental— 2.1.1.4.3), but unlike instrumental, the element with which it is related cannot occur in a prepositional phrase. It must be referenced on the object portion of the VIC—see 1.2.1.2.3. The examples below would only be grammatical under a bizarre instrumental

There is no formal means of expressing negative circumstance, other than by negating a positive circumstance statement. In this case, however, the scope of negation seems only to include negative circumstance.

2.1.1.4.6. Possessive

Possessive is marked on the possessed element. It is expressed three ways, each of which applies to a separate class of nouns:
(1) The class of possession marking suffixes inflects for person, number, and third person gender on the bound form of all -xi' nouns, which are inalienably possessed. The paradigm of possession marking suffixes is as follows (each of these suffixes has allomorphs that are phonologically conditioned—see discussion and examples in 3.4):

first singular

-0

second singular

-m

third singular masculine

-con

Wari' 230

third singular feminine third neuter first plural inclusive first plural exclusive second plural third plural masculine third plural feminine

-cam -in -xi' -xut -hu' -cocon -cacam

Most -xi' nouns also have free forms, some of which make up a class of nonpossessed nouns (they cannot be possessed—see 2.1.1.4.6.1), and others of which, together with all other unpossessed nouns, can be possessed by:
(2) The class of nominal inflectional clitics that also inflect for person, number, and third person gender. None of these NICS has allomorphs. The paradigm of NICS is identical in function and phonologically similar to the possessive suffixes described above. It is as follows:

first singular

ne

second singular

nem

third singular masculine

nucun

third singular feminine

nequem

third neuter

nein

first plural inclusive

nexi'

first plural exclusive

nuxut

second plural

nuhu'

third plural masculine

nucucun

third plural feminine

nequequem

(3) The Tenseless verbal inflectional clitics mark possession on co' kinship terms—see the discussion and examples in 2.2.2.2.1.5.
2.1.1.4.6.1. Alienable and inalienable possession Co- kinship terms, derived from relative clauses (see 2.2.2.2.1.5), are inalienably possessed, as are -xi' nouns, so-called because their citation form ends with the suffix -xi' ‘first person plural inclusive’. Most xi' nouns have free alternate forms which can be divided into two classes: (1) nonpossessed forms, which cannot be possessed; and (2) unpossessed forms, which are accepted by some speakers in alienable possession. The nonpossessed class of nouns consists of words for body parts: 'at ‘bone’, waji' ‘head’, caxim ‘foot’, jat ‘tooth’, 'ut ‘nose’. Possession of words in this class of nouns must be expressed by the inflection of their -xi' forms, rather than their free forms:

(407) a.

'aracon

Morphology 231

(407) b. (408) a. (408) b.

nuhu' poss:2p

There is some question as to whether the class of unpossessed nouns, that have -xi' alternate forms, is truly possessable. A few of them have been found in the corpus ((409c) is one example), occurring with the possession marking NICS, but some informants have said that the use of NICS with these unpossessed forms is ungrammatical, and that their use is the result of outside pressure from persons who do not speak the language well. Of the pairs of examples below, (a) is preferred to (b).

Possessable nouns include names of species (most animals, e.g. birds, fish, bees and other insects, trees), as well as names of people. Possession is marked on this class of nouns by the NICS listed above. Many animals and birds, especially significant game animals and birds, have -xi' forms, by means of which possession is preferably marked—see the preceding examples.

2.1.1.4.7. Possessed Possessive is marked on the possessed element—see 2.1.1.4.6.

2.1.1.4.8. Quality

There is no special nominal inflection marking for quality. The notion of quality (person with or without a certain quality) can be expressed by the preverbal modifier tama' ‘always’ or the verb taxipa' ‘to befriend’ used in the postverbal modification position with the meaning of ‘customarily’, appearing optionally with the main verb of the sentence.

2.1.1.4.9. Quantity

There is no special nominal inflection marking for quantity. Terms of quantity are limited in the language. They occur as verbs, as follows: xica' pe/to ‘to be alone’/‘to be one’, tucu caracan ‘to be face-to-face’/‘to be two’, paric ‘to be few’, tocwan ‘to be several’, mija ‘to be much’, 'iri' mijo ‘to be many’, and xam' ‘to be all of it’. Numerical terms for ‘two’ or more have been borrowed from Portuguese, and they are readily used by the younger generation; older people, however, usually use only 'ON equivalents wherever possible. The Portuguese term for ‘one’, um or uma is never used as a substitute for xica' pe/to ‘to be alone’/‘to be one’.

2.1.1.4.10. Material
There is no special nominal inflection for material. In the Wari' culture, products carry the name of the material from which they are made, e.g. temem' ‘bow’ is made from the

Morphology 235

hard palmwood which bears this name, wao' ‘small woven basket’ is made from the leaves of the palm tree which bears this name. A statement such as ‘I made the bow with temem' wood’ would be senseless, because a temem' can only be made with temem' wood. They would simply say, ‘I made a temem'.’

Quep

'inain 'ina-in

make

1s:rp/p-3n

bow

‘I made a bow.’

There are, however, some articles that can be made from a variety of materials, such as mats, large baskets, house coverings, canoes, etc. Material in relation to these objects can be expressed by verbalizing the noun representing the product (i.e. using the first person singular possessive form), using it as the last member of a compound verb, and expressing the material as the object of this compound verb:

(419) a. Ten

wita wita-0

caxima.

weave

mat -1s

Either the regular verb or the verbalized noun in the constructions illustrated in (419) can be omitted:

(420) a.

Ten

'inain

caxima.

'ina-in

2.1.1.4.11. Manner

There is no special nominal inflection marking for manner. Manner is expressed in two ways.
(i) As a derived noun in a prepositional phrase

2.1.1.4.12. Cause Cause as a nonlocal semantic function is described in 1.1.2.4.2.4.

2.1.1.4.13. Purpose

There is no formal means of expressing purpose such as that found in ‘I went to Guajará to get clothes’, or ‘I cut wood for my house.’ This concept may be expressed by two juxtaposed sentences, the second of which conveys purpose in the following ways.
(1) By means of a verbalized future tense sentence, described in 1.1.1.4.3.2.2.

2.1.1.4.15. Reference

There is no special nominal inflection marking reference. Reference is expressed as a nominal, appearing as the direct object of a verb expressing communication (e.g. pijim' ‘tell’, tomi' ‘to speak’, coromicat ‘to think’). Note its function with an indirect object in (428b), where the indirect object is marked in the object (suffix) VIC, and the (logical) direct object is expressed by a prepositional phrase.

2.1.1.4.16. Essive

Essive is expressed by two juxtaposed sentences, the essive element being in the second sentence:

2.1.1.4.17. Translative

Translative is expressed as direct speech in the form of a first person singular possessed noun.

2.1.1.4.19. Partitive

2.1.1.4.19.1–4. Partitive and nonpartitive numeral and quantifier Numeral and quantifier forms are limited in the language. See 2.1.1.4.9, where we list the verbs that express numeral and quantity in 'ON. Numerals, including dois ‘two’, are borrowed from Portuguese (duas ‘two (f)’ is rarely used). Um is never used as a substitute for the verb xica' pe/to ‘to be alone’/‘to be one’.
There are no formal means of expressing partitive. There are no significant syntactic distinctions between numeral and quantifier as they relate to partitive, nor is the line between partitive and nonpartitive clear. Partitive numeral and quantifier employ numerals or numeral/quantifier verbs as postverbal modifiers to form a compound with the verb ma' ‘to exist’. The verb describing the action of the element to which partitive is related appears in a relative clause whose head is the subject of the verb ma'. This construction may also be construed to express nonpartitive.

While partitive may be taken to mean nonpartitive, nonpartitive may be expressed more specifically, as in (434), where the number or numeral/ quantifier verb appears in the postverbal modification position with the verb describing the action of the element to which nonpartitive is related. There is no relative clause in nonpartitive constructions.

2.1.1.4.20-21. Price and value Price and value involve concepts that were lacking in the language and culture until recent years (see also 2.1.1.4.9). The nouns tajixi' ‘our leaf or simply tan ‘leaf’ are used by many to express the concept of money, price or value.

Portuguese monetary terms have been incorporated into the language in a limited way: real and centavo (Brazilian monetary units) usually appear in a compound verb with a preposed number; dinheiro, the Portuguese term for ‘money’ but generally used as ‘price’ in 'ON, usually appears as a noun, invariably accompanied by a postposed possessive marking NIC, as in the following exchange:

Though both (437) and (438) are acceptable forms, the tendency is to avoid the borrowed terms as much as possible. (438) is usually preferred to (437).

2.1.1.4.22–23. Distance and extent

Specific terms for distance and extent are lacking in the language. Portuguese terms have been borrowed in a limited way; they usually appear as verbs. Relationships are expressed in a sequence of two sentences, similar to that of price and value in (439). The first sentence contains a proposition, the quantity implied in distance or extent being expressed by an 'ON equivalent in the VP. The borrowed term is expressed with a preposed number in the VP of the second sentence, and its subject usually reiterates the verb of the first sentence, or a meaning similar to it, in a noun clause or derived noun.

2.1.1.4.24. Concessive

There is no special form for marking nominals for the concessive case. Concessive is expressed by the contraexpective type of verbal modification clause. It is usually preceded by a clause with paxi' ‘not:find’, which is described in 1.1.2.4.2.8.

2.1.1.4.25. Inclusion

When an element is to be specifically mentioned as included in a group, it is expressed in a second sentence as a topicalized element, either as the subject or the left dislocated topic—see 1.12. The referent particle quem is postposed to the topicalized element.

2.1.1.4.26. Exclusion

Like inclusion, exclusion is expressed by a sequence of two sentences. The first expresses the proposition; the second specifies the element to be excluded from the group. A relative clause is often used in the second sentence.

2.1.1.4.27. Addition

Addition is expressed by a sequence of two sentences, the first of which states the original proposition, while the second states who is to be ‘added’ to the action of the first. The referent particle quem is also postposed to the element to be ‘added’ to the action of the first sentence. The verb mo ‘list presentation’ and the VP ca' na ‘thus it is/was’ are often used to specify the participants of the addition element (see coordination 1.3).

2.1.1.4.29–30. Citation and label forms

Citation and label forms are expressed in the following forms: (i) Possessed nouns are expressed in their basic form, which is first person plural
inclusive, i.e. winaxi' ‘our heads’ for ‘heads’ in general. (ii) Verbs and unpossessed nouns may also be expressed as nominals with the
infinitival/participial marker wa. When the verb is reduplicated, as in (446a–b), the postverbal modifier qui' ‘coming:this:way’ always accompanies it.

2.1.1.5. Local semantic functions
2.1.1.5.1. Introduction
Location in space is expressed (1) by verbs (compound or simple); and/or (2) by bodypart nouns. While the type of location (general, interior, ulterior, etc.) may be expressed by the body-part noun functioning as the object of the verb, movement in relation to the location (‘at rest’, ‘motion to’, ‘motion from’, or ‘motion past’) is expressed only by the verb. The noun to which the local function is related appears as an object of the verb, or as the possessor of an object of the verb. We will describe in this section the means for expressing local semantic functions, although none of these involves special case marking on the noun.
(1) Location in space expressed by verbs Some types of location in space are expressed by verbs that indicate specific types of motion or states (‘at rest’, ‘motion to’, ‘motion from’ and ‘motion past’) inherent in their meaning, e.g. pe/to ‘to be at’ for general ‘at rest’ location, wixicam ‘to go near’ for proximate ‘motion to’ location, xom tacam' ‘to cross over a river to the other side’ for ulterior ‘motion to’ location, etc. It is, however, more common for the specific categories of local function to be expressed by a set of verbs and postverbal modifiers that explicitly indicate location: pe/to ‘to be at’, mao/mama' ‘to go’ (meaning ‘going that way’ when appearing in postverbal modification position), qui' ‘coming this way’ and ca' ‘this neuter’ (meaning ‘from’ or ‘away from’ when occurring in postverbal modification position). We call these location verbs.
‘Motion at rest’ can be expressed by the verb pe/to ‘to be at’, appearing either in a noncompounded verb (448a–b) or as the rightmost member of a compound verb

Morphology 247

(postverbal modification position) (448c–d). When appearing in a compound verb, pe/to conveys the idea that the action of the verb with which it occurs was executed, and then the participant remained in the position occupied after completing the action. Compare (448c–f) with the other examples in (448) below.

‘Motion to’ is expressed by two verbs whose use depends upon the physical location of the speaker: mao/mama' ‘to go’ appears either as an independent verb or in compound verbs (postverbal modification position) to express outward motion, or motion away from the speaker; and qui' ‘coming this way’ (a postverbal modifier) expresses inward motion, or motion toward the speaker.

‘Motion from’ is usually expressed by the demonstrative ca' ‘this (n)’, appearing in postverbal modification position with the meaning of ‘away from or past’. Sometimes the postverbal modifier qui' ‘coming this way’ is used for motion from the source.

‘Motion past’ is expressed by a semantically appropriate ‘motion’ verb, such as xut/xuruxut ‘to walk’, tiquin' ‘to continue on’, 'ac ‘to travel’, mao/ mama' ‘to go’ and hwet/hwerehwet ‘to appear’, occurring optionally (but usually) in a compound verb with the demonstrative ca' ‘this (n)’ or ‘away from or past’.

(2) Location in space expressed by use of body-part nouns. In addition to the use of location verbs to express the specific categories of motion or
orientation in space, semantically appropriate body-part nouns are used to express some types of location (interior, exterior, anterior, ulterior, etc.). They occur as a possessed noun. The possessor is the noun to which the local function is related. The body-part nouns which are used to express location in space are as follows: quimaxi' ‘our chest’ (‘in front of, ‘on top of, ‘over’, ‘above’, ‘under’, ‘this side’); waraxi' ‘our back’ (‘general area behind’); nomonoxi' ‘our buttocks’ (‘behind’, ‘immediate area close behind’); tamaxi' ‘top of our head’ (‘in front’, ‘over’, ‘above’, ‘on top of); xonexi' ‘curve of our back’ (‘outside’, ‘on top of, ‘under’, ‘that side’); tequipaxi' ‘our thorax’ (‘inside’, ‘under’); cacaraxi' ‘area at our side’ or ‘our edge’ (‘beside’); quirixi' ‘our side’ (‘beside’); 'iri' cwerexi' ‘our right side’ (lit. ‘our true body’) (‘beside right side’); parajixi' ‘our left side’ (‘beside left side’); tapaxixi' ‘our wing’ (‘beside’); ximijaxi' ‘our waist’ (‘between’, ‘among’).
The choice of body-part noun to express location is quite subjective. In most cases, the element to which location is related is likened to the human form. For example, the indigenous Wari' house was built with one tall watershed that had a tendency to droop forward at the top. The roof almost reached the ground at the back, and the sides and front were open. Nowadays, the Wari' have adopted the architectural style of local Brazilians, but they still liken houses to huge hulking forms. ‘Behind the house’ is ‘its back’ or ‘its buttocks’; ‘on top of the house’ is ‘the curve of its back’; ‘in front of the house’ is ‘its chest’; ‘beside the house’ is ‘its side’, etc. A bed is also likened to a hulking form, in that ‘under the bed’ is ‘its thorax’; however, since the top of a bed is useful and exposed to view, ‘on top of the bed’ is ‘its chest’ and the under surface is ‘the curve of its back’. Long, narrow objects, like canoes, are also likened to human forms: ‘in front’ in a canoe is at ‘the top of its head’, and ‘behind’ in a canoe is at ‘its buttocks’. (For evidence that these body parts, unlike the use of body parts in English, are not simply dead metaphors, we refer the reader to 2.1.1.5.21.)

2.1.1.5.5. Exterior location

Exterior location is characterized by the verb hwet/hwerehwet ‘to appear’ (both the singular and plural form are used as intransitive verbs) or ‘to approach’ (only the singular form, hwet, may be used when this meaning is intended). It often functions the same way that corom (see (464)) expresses interior location, i.e. hwet can be compounded with a location verb, and this compound form can be used as the second member of a compound verb (466b).

When people are in front of each other, face to face, tucu hwet ‘to face toward’ (used to express citerior-anterior location (see 2.1.1.5.21)) is preferred to a construction using quimaxi', as in (470d), where ‘face to face’ is not implied.

2.1.1.5.8. Superior location

Superior location can be expressed by the body-part noun tamaxi' ‘top of our head’ or the simple noun pawin ‘height’ or ‘sky’, appearing as the object of an appropriate verb. The verb piri' is also often used to express superior and superior-contact location—see 2.1.1.5.9.

2.1.1.5.9. Superior-contact location

Superior-contact location is expressed by appropriate verbs and/or location verbs, whose object may be one of three body-part nouns. The choice of noun depends on the element to which it is related: ‘on top of a tall object’ is expressed by tamaxi' ‘top of our head’; ‘on top of an object, whose surface is considered the outside of that object’ is expressed by xonexi' ‘curve of our back’; and ‘on the flat surface of an object’ is expressed by quimaxi' ‘our chest’. We do not have an expression for superior-contact ‘past’ location.

2.1.1.5.10. Inferior location

Inferior location is characterized by the verb corom ‘to enter’, which, it will be noted, is also used to express interior location (see 2.1.1.5.4). It is often preposed by the verb mo ‘to run’ in a compound verb. The variant of corom, com, is also used in a verb compound, mo com terem' ‘to lie under’, to express inferior location. The only examples we have of mo com terem' in our data are in (491c) and (494a) below. It would seem that com is the singular form of corom (compare (491c) and (491d)). However, corom is the form used in all other environments, differing from all singular/plural verbs where the plural intransitive subject and plural transitive object govern the choice of the plural verb form.
Inferior location in relation to tapit ‘indigenous bed’ and horop ‘elevated floor of a house’ is expressed by a derived noun, appearing as the object of the verb: tucu tapit ‘under the bed’ (lit. ‘facing the bed’) and tucu horop ‘under the floor’ (lit. ‘facing the floor'). These derived forms convey the idea that one is under the floor or bed, facing the underside. They function as normal nouns. See (491) and (492) for examples.

2.1.1.5.12–13. Lateral location

Lateral location is expressed by appropriate verbs and/or location verbs, whose optional (but usual) objects are any one of four body-part nouns: cacaraxi' ‘our edge’, quirixi' ‘our side’, 'iri' cwerexi' ‘our right side’ (lit. ‘our true body'), and parajixi' ‘our left side’. When preposed by xijein ‘its otherness’, cacaraxi' means ‘area at our side’ or ‘our side’. The resulting possessed NP (xijein cacarain) means ‘its other side’ or ‘one of its sides’. Xijein also occurs with quirixi' and functions like xijein cacaraxi'. The use of quirixi' is sometimes limited, depending on the element to which it is related. For instance, quirinain ‘its side’ in (500b) cannot be used with wao' ‘basket’, because a basket is round, without definite sides; cacarain ‘area at its side’ expresses ‘the side of the basket’ more adequately. In addition to these body-part nouns, tapaxixi' ‘our wing’, occurring in its third person neuter inflection (tapaxi ‘its wing’), may be used to express lateral location in relation to an inanimate element. When expressing lateral location, it means ‘the edge of an area’.

Citerior and citerior-contact location are expressed alike in most cases (509a–b); however, when one is talking about an object like a mat or a piece of cloth, the body-part noun quimaxi' ‘our chest’ must be used, specifying its top or front, rather than ‘this side’ (509c).

Ulterior location is characterized by one or more of the following, appearing with appropriate verbs: (1) the verb mao/mama' ‘going that way’; the demonstrative cain ‘that neuter distal’, appearing in an NP or as an object of the verb; and (3) cacarain ‘its side or edge’, appearing as an object of the verb. Although the use of the verb mao/mama' ‘going that way’ is preferred to express ulterior location, qui' ‘coming this way’ is also used in some contexts. Note, however, that the demonstrative cain ‘that neuter distal’ makes it clear that ulterior location is being expressed and it is indeed cain that, for the most part, conveys the notion of ulterior location, in contrast to citerior location.

2.1.1.5.17. Ulterior-contact location

Ulterior-contact location is expressed, for the most part, like ulterior location. When one is talking about an object like a mat, however, the body-part noun xonexi' ‘curve of our back’ must be used, specifying its back or outside, rather than ‘that side’.

2.1.1.5.18–19. Medial location

Medial location is characterized by the verb ximija ‘to be in the middle’, or ‘to “middle”’ (516a–d), derived from ximijaxi' ‘our waist or middle’; or the body-part noun ximijaxi' ‘our waist or middle’, appearing as the object of an appropriate verb (516e–f). Both ‘between’ and ‘among’ are expressed by ximijaxi'; the use of the third person neuter inflection, ximijain ‘its middle’, implies ‘between (in the middle of) two elements’, and the other inflections imply ‘among (in the middle of) three or more elements’. The element to which medial location is related is expressed either as the object of the verb, or in a prepositional phrase.

2.1.1.5.21. Citerior-anterior location

Citerior-anterior location is characterized by the verbalized form of three body-part nouns: quimaxi' ‘our chest’ (quima ‘to “chest”’), tocoxi' ‘our eye or face’ (tucu ‘to face’), and winaxi' ‘our head’ (wina ‘to “head”’). Citerior-anterior location is used in relation to animate elements only. This location in relation to inanimate elements must be expressed as anterior location—see 2.1.1.5.6. The choice of verbalized nouns in citerior-anterior location depends on the physical position of the persons or animals standing opposite one another. If two people are standing opposite one another, ‘chest to chest’ or ‘eye to eye’, quima ‘to “chest”’ or tucu ‘to face’ is used. If the elements standing opposite one another are an animal and a human, they cannot be ‘chest to chest’ to each other, because the animal’s chest normally faces the ground. Citerior-anterior location in relation to the human may be expressed by quima ‘to “chest”’ or tucu ‘to face’, but in relation to the animal, it must be expressed by tucu ‘to face’ or wina ‘to “head”’. We have found no expressions for citerior-anterior ‘motion from’ and ‘motion past’ location. This use of body parts to express different citerior/anterior spacial relations indicates to us that the use of body parts in location expressions does not merely involve dead metaphors, but rather we believe that the speakers are consciously aware of the primary meaning as body parts as they use these forms.

2.1.1.5.22–30. Motion past a long object in the direction of its length and at right angles to its length

Motion past a long object in the direction of its length and at right angles to its length is expressed by semantically appropriate verbs. There are no particular similarities to the types of local functions already discussed in 2.1.1.5, except that interior and inferior motion past a long object employ verbs used to express interior and inferior location.

2.1.1.6.1. General locations of time

There are no special nominal inflection forms to mark general locations of time; however, we will discuss the way such notions would be expressed in 'ON. There are three nouns and one preverbal modifier ('u' um ‘dusk or dawn’) that express periods of the day or night. The nouns may appear either as arguments of the verb (530a–b) or as the leftmost member of verb compounds (530c–d). 'U' um only appears as a preverbal modifier.

2.1.1.7. Double case marking There is no double case marking in the language.

2.1.1.8. Number marking system There is no distinction between singular and plural marking on nouns.

See 2.1.1.8.3.

2.1.1.8.1. Number marking systems in nouns

2.1.1.8.2. Optionality of number marking systems in nouns See 2.1.1.8.3.

2.1.1.8.3. Other means of indicating number

Although there are no obligatory number distinctions on nouns, there are four ways (optionally) to mark number on them.
(1) There is a set of collective markers or particles that can precede nouns to express the general notion of plurality. 'Oro is the most common. It can appear optionally with all common nouns, even on collective nouns (546d).

‘all the children’

There are four other collective particles that have a limited, complementary distribution. They indicate a specific group. Waram can occur with the first person singular inflection of kinship terms, as in waram te ‘my fathers’; mon occurs with the word tarama’ ‘man’; oromon occurs with the words xojam' ‘young girl’ and horon ‘old person’; and mana can occur with the second and third person singular and plural inflections of co-kinship terms, as well as some common nouns. See (547) below, where the use of mana with common nouns illustrates the difference between 'oro as a general plural marker and the other collective particles as specific group markers. Although 'oro and mana may appear with the same noun, 'oro does not appear together with waram, mon, or 'oromon with the same nouns—see 1.2.5.2.6.

(2) Although the number of nouns referring to humans is also marked in the verbal inflectional clitics (548a), possessive morphemes (548b) or on an inflected preposition (548c), this device is very restricted, because only human nouns can be marked this way (compare (548d) and (548e)), and they are also normally marked by other means—see 2.1.1.8.3(1, 3–5). See 2.1.1.8.3(4) on how to mark the number of nonhuman nouns.

(3) There are three collective nouns referring to humans that express plural number semantically. There are no collective nouns referring to nonhumans.

(549) b.

(549) c.

(4) The grammatical number of a noun can also be marked via the form of verbs that have a less intense, or singular, and a more intense, or plural form. The number of the subject of intransitive verbs and the object of transitive verbs is marked via the use of the more intense, or plural form. So although the plural number of a nonhuman noun is not marked on the VIC, if the verb has an intense, or plural form, the number of the subject or object can nevertheless be marked by its use—see 2.1.1.9.3.

2.1.1.9. Division of nouns into classes

Nouns are divided into distinct grammatical classes by three features:

feature gender possession animacy

Value masculine/feminine/neuter alienable/inalienable/unpossessable human/nonhuman

2.1.1.9.1. Distinguishing affixes or markers
There are no distinguishing characteristics to mark gender or humanness/nonhumanness on a noun; they are distinguished semantically and/or elsewhere in the clause via agreement.
There are two sets of nouns that have inalienable possession. The -xi’ noun class is marked by the set of inflected possessive suffixes (554a). The other class is a set of derived kinship terms. The ‘verb’ of the kinship term is the first person singular form of

Morphology 287

the kinship term, and it has the form of a quote (554b), with the possessor having the form of a subject. See 2.1.1.4.6.1 and 2.2.2.2.1.5, where these two classes of nouns having inalienable possession are described in detail.

2.1.1.9.2. Characterization of the class meanings of each class

Division of nouns into classes by gender is determined semantically. Human females are the only members that belong to the feminine gender class. However, mixed gender groups (that is, including both males and females), collective nouns (e.g. ‘children’ or ‘siblings’ when males and females are included) are also treated as feminine gender class, and groups of people including both males and females are also referred to with feminine markers. The nouns in the examples in (555a–b) are feminine; 'oro wari' in (555c) is treated as feminine because it is a mixed gender group.

‘I saw the people (both men and women).’

All remaining nouns are divided between the masculine and neuter gender classes. Although gender is not marked overtly on nouns, their gender may be marked elsewhere in the clause. The masculine gender class includes all human males and about half of the culturally significant animals and objects. By ‘culturally significant’, we mean animals and objects that were familiar to the Wari' before their contact with civilization, or that played an important role in their pre-contact world view. These include about half of the small fish, birds, animals and insects; some large fish; about half of the bees; some useful objects; some phenomena of nature; and about half of large game animals. The examples in (556) belong to the masculine gender class.

coparac ‘species of bee’
wom ‘cotton’
towapiji ‘cold south wind’
min' ‘tapir’

The neuter gender class includes inanimate objects and most plants, animals and fish which were not familiar to the Wari' before their contact with civilization. It also includes small fish, birds, animals, insects and large game animals indigenous to the Wari' area not included in the masculine gender class. Finally, all subordinate clauses and derived nouns are neuter in gender. All of the constructions in (557) belong to the neuter gender class.

Nouns are also divided into classes by the feature of possession. All body parts and kinship terms, as well as some useful objects when expressed as a -xi' noun, have inalienable possession.

Division of nouns into classes by their humanness/nonhumanness is also determined semantically. See 2.1.1.9.3 for the significance of this class division.

2.1.1.9.3. Marking of noun classes

Gender is not marked on the noun itself, but on the verbal inflectional clitic (561a–c), in the possessive suffix (562a–c) or nominal inflectional clitic (562d–f), or by the demonstrative following the noun (563a–c). In the latter case, a distinction is only made between neuter versus nonneuter, i.e. the masculine and feminine distinction is neutralized. In these cases, agreement with the gender of the noun is obligatory. Verbal inflectional clitics are described in 2.1.3.6; genitives in 1.10; and demonstratives in 1.2.5.2.5.

Humanness/nonhumanness is indicated on the verbal inflectional clitics or possessive suffixes/nominal inflectional clitics via number marking. Plural suffixes/inflectional clitics can only be used in reference to humans; reference can be made to nonhumans only with singular suffixes/inflectional clitics, even when the nonhuman element is plural. The number of the nonhuman element is marked, where possible, in the form of the verb (less intense, or singular, and more intense, or plural—see 2.1.1.8.3).

2.1.1.10. Marking of definiteness in noun phrases

The use of the object marker suffix in verbal inflectional clitics (see section 2.1.3.6.2.2) and/or the use of demonstratives in NPS (see 1.2.5.2.5) can express definiteness of a noun phrase, although this marking is optional.

Absence of these three indicators of marking definiteness can be interpreted as indefiniteness. There is no formal marker to express referential indefiniteness (‘He ate a

Wari' 294

(specific) fish’), but nonreferential indefiniteness can be expressed by the verb jimao ‘to be different’ following the noun like a modifier. We have recorded jimao with only two nouns, as illustrated in (568).

Indefiniteness is not overtly marked in noun phrases, although the absence of VICS and/or demonstrative adjectives can indicate indefiniteness—see 2.1.1.1.1.

2.1.1.13. Marking of genericness in noun phrases

Genericness may be marked in noun phrases by the use of the collective morpheme 'oro, which precedes the noun. The marking of genericness in noun phrases is optional.

2.1.1.14. Distinguishing of more important noun actors from less important ones
There is no morphosyntactic distinction between more important and less important noun actors, aside from the semantic-role/agreement hierarchy discussed in 1.2.1.2.3. above.
2.1.2. Pronouns The only underived pronouns in the language are emphatic pronouns, discussed in the next subsection. However, demonstrative pronouns may be used as personal pronouns, as discussed in 2.1.2.2.

Morphology 295

2.1.2.1. Emphatic pronouns

There is a distinct class of emphatic pronouns. There are no distinctions for degrees of emphasis in this class. Emphatic pronouns occur in first, second, and third persons, in both singular and plural forms. Note that the first person plural inclusive emphatic pronoun, wari', is the autodenomination of the Wari' (Pacaas Novos) tribe.

first singular second singular third singular masculine third singular feminine third neuter first plural inclusive first plural exclusive second plural third plural masculine third plural feminine

wata' wum wirico wiricam je wari' warut wahu' wiricoco wiricacam

Emphatic pronouns may not appear alone as arguments of the verb. They may, however, appear alone or in apposition to a noun in left dislocation. They may also appear in apposition to a noun as the object of a verb in ‘and’-coordination, where the pronoun and accompanying appositive do not occupy the first position of the series.

Emphatic pronouns are commonly used to mark ‘and’-coordination between nominal elements of the clause—see 1.3.3. They may link arguments of the verb, as in (570b) above, or they may connect a series of names given as clarification to an otherwise complete sentence, as in (571) below. It is common for a series so marked to end with the verb phrase ca' na ‘thus it is’ (lit. ‘this:n 3s:rp/p’). The first, second and third person forms may be used in ‘and’-coordination expressed in a disconnected series.

First and second person emphatic pronouns are frequently used in answer to questions of the type, ‘Who is it?’ or to ask, ‘Is that you?’ Note that these same constructions involving third person are given with demonstrative pronouns—see 2.1.2.2.

Emphatic pronouns may also be verbalized and appear in compound verbs, as seen in 2.2.2.1.2.1. These are, however, rare; and have only been found in narrative text.

Morphology 297

2.1.2.2. Demonstrative pronouns

Demonstrative pronouns occur only in the third person, singular and plural. They are formed when four proclitics (co ‘singular masculine’, cam ‘singular feminine’, 'i ‘neuter’ and caram ‘plural’) precede the demonstratives described in 1.2.5.2.5 (ca'/cwa' ‘this:n/mf proximate to speaker’, ma' ‘that proximate to hearer’, cain/cwain ‘that:n/m-f distal’, paca' ‘that just occurred’, cara ne ‘that recently absent’ and cara pane ‘that long absent’).
These proclitics could be interpreted as prefixes; however, if they were prefixes, the

word-initial nonphonemic glottal stop on ma'

‘that proximate to hearer’, on co

ma' ‘that masculine one proximate to hearer’ and 'i ma' ‘that neuter one proximate to

hearer’ should delete, since word-medial glottal-consonant clusters do not occur. Note

that the word-initial glottal does disappear when the INFL clitic co ‘m/f realis

past/present’ prefixes on to 'aji' ‘my older brother’ to form cwaji' ma ‘your older brother’.

In the case of cwaji' ma, co is obviously a prefix; but in the cases of co ma' and 'i ma', we

believe co and 'i must be interpreted as free clitics, and therefore that cam and caram

must also be interpreted as free clitics.

2.1.2.2.1. Parameters involved in demonstrative pronouns
The parameters involved in demonstrative pronouns are spatial and temporal: proximity to the participants in the speech act, and relative remoteness in time—see 2.1.2.3 on the use of demonstrative pronouns as personal pronouns.

2.1.2.2.4. Marking of case in demonstrative pronouns There is no case marking in the language.

2.1.2.2.5. Adjectival use of demonstrative pronouns

Demonstrative pronouns cannot be used adjectivally. This is accomplished by the demonstratives from which demonstrative pronouns are derived—see 1.2.5.2.5.

2.1.2.3.2. Person distinctions in demonstrative pronouns Demonstrative pronouns used as personal pronouns occur only in the third person.

2.1.2.3.3. Marking of pronouns for number

Singular-plural distinctions are made only in nonneuter forms (see the table of demonstrative pronouns in 2.1.2.2). Masculine and/or feminine plural is formed by reduplication of the feminine singular form, also shown above. Neuter is only marked for singular.

2.1.2.3.4. Status of various third person actors
The language does not mark the different status of various third person actors. There are no fourth or fifth person forms of personal pronouns.

2.1.2.3.5. Degrees of proximity

Three degrees of spatial proximity to the participants in the speech act are marked in demonstrative pronouns: ‘proximate to the speaker’ (578a), ‘proximate to the hearer’ (578b) and ‘distal’ (578c). Three degrees of temporal proximity to the participants in the speech act are also marked: ‘just occurred’ (579a), ‘recently absent’ (579b) and ‘long absent’ (579c).

2.1.2.3.6. Anaphoric third person pronouns There are no special anaphoric third person pronouns.

2.1.2.3.7. Gender distinctions in pronouns
Unlike nouns (see 2.1.1.9), gender is marked directly on demonstrative pronouns via proclitics. As with all other references to gender in the language, mixed groups of males and females are referred to as feminine. See the paradigm in 2.1.2.2. above.

2.1.2.3.8. Kinship affiliations in pronouns
There are no special pronominal forms indicating the tribal, sectional or family relationships of the referents.

2.1.2.3.9. Other forms of personal pronouns
The paradigm of demonstrative pronouns described in 2.1.2.2 is the only form of personal pronouns.

2.1.2.3.10. Tense agreement of pronouns The pronoun does not agree with the verb in tense.

2.1.2.3.11. Status distinctions in pronouns Status distinctions are not marked in pronouns.

2.1.2.3.12. Nonspecific indefinite pronoun

There is one term, 'ara ‘so-and-so’, which is used like an indefinite pronoun. It is rare and used only when describing hypothetical situations.

2.1.2.3.15. Pronoun-noun constructions
Only third person emphatic pronouns may occur in apposition to nouns. See the examples in 2.1.2.1.

2.1.2.4. Reflexive, reciprocal and possessive pronouns
There are no possessive, reflexive or reciprocal pronouns in the language. See 1.6. for a discussion of reflexive/reciprocal verbal inflectional clitics. Also, see 1.10 for discussion of possessive nominal inflectional clitics.

2.1.2.5. Interrogative pronouns and other question words
There are no interrogative pronouns in 'ON—see 1.1.1.2.2 on the formation of questionword questions.

2.1.2.6. Relative pronouns

The INFL morphemes ca ‘neuter realis past/present’ and co ‘masculine/ feminine realis past/present’, 'iri' ‘realis past/present’, and xi ‘irrealis’ discussed in 1.1.1.4.2 are the closest thing there is to a relative pronoun in 'ON. There are no other special forms of relative pronouns.

2.1.3.1.1. Passive

2.1.3.1.1.1. Personal passive Passive is expressed by nonactive verbal inflectional clitics, as well as by the infinitival marker wa. Like all other verbal inflectional clitics, they follow the verb. They do not express tense/ mood. Passive VICS express person, number and gender. One set of passive VICS occurs where Tense active VICS would be used, and the other occurs where Tenseless active VICS would be used. Gender is marked only on the latter set. We will refer to these as ‘Tense’ and ‘Tenseless’ passive VICS, to indicate their distribution, even though they do not really mark tense/mood. ‘Tense’ passive VICS can occur in simple sentences just as the realis and irrealis VICS, but they tend to be used rarely. The use of ‘Tenseless’ passive VICS is preferred, because they function in constructions in which tense/mood is marked in INFL morphemes or in verbalized sequential- and comparative-type sentences, as in the following examples. Note that (582d) illustrates the use of the infinitival marker to express passive.

The two paradigms of passive VICS seem to be incomplete. There are forms for all but the first person plural, and we are not certain about the existence of the first person singular. (BK thinks she may have heard examples with first person singular, but there is no record of it in the corpus.) The second person clitics are rarely used. Third person clitics are quite common, especially the ‘Tenseless’ class. The reason for this disparity in the use of third person passives versus first and second person passives may be the following: since passive (among other things) demotes the agent, the use of the passive is less crucial for first and second persons, since they never fill grammatical relation positions in the sentence and, therefore, do not need to be demoted.

2.1.3.1.3. Increasing the valency of a verb
The valency of a verb can be increased by verb compounding. There are several possible semantic relationships between the verbs in a compound verb; causative is one of them. We discuss only causative compound verbs here—see 2.2.3.1 for discussion of other compound verbs.

2.1.3.1.3.1 Causativization

2.1.3.1.3.1.1. Intransitive verb made causative: An intransitive verb forms a causative when it is compounded on the right of a transitive verb. In all of the examples in (590), the surface objects marked in the verbal inflectional clitics are the semantic subjects of the intransitive verbs, supporting our analysis of them as causatives.

Wari' 310

2.1.3.2. Tense

Tense is only expressed in conjunction with realis mood. See 2.1.3.4. Tense/mood is marked in simple sentences by three sets of verbal enclitics that we call verbal inflectional clitics (VICS)—see 1.1.1.4.1, where we discuss the use of Tense active verbal inflectional clitics in simple sentences. These three sets of VICS also mark the person and number of the participants of the action. See 2.1.3.6. where we discuss VICS in detail.
The three sets of tense/mood VICS cannot be used in all grammatical constructions, for instance, in COMP sentences (1.1.1.4.2), most subordinate clauses (1.1.2) and derived nouns (2.2.2.2). In these kinds of constructions, tense/mood is marked by five different clitics that we call inflection (INFL) morphemes: ca ‘neuter realis past/present’, co ‘masculine/feminine realis past/present’, 'iri' ‘realis past/present’, ta ‘realis future’, and xi ‘irrealis’. When an INFL morpheme appears, person and number (and gender for third persons) is marked by Tenseless VICS (except with some occurrences of co ‘masculine/feminine realis past/present’ and ‘iri’ ‘realis/past present’—see 1.1.1.4.2). The complementarity between INFL and VICS is accounted for simply enough: tense, when it appears, must appear in the sentence-second position (in nonprohibitive matrix clauses).
Most constructions require either a tense/mood VIC or an INFL morpheme. However (see 1.6), with reflexive VICS in simple sentences, tense and mood are not expressed. Also (see 1.1.1.4.1), there is a small class of verbal modifiers used in simple sentences which requires the use of Tenseless VICS. Finally (see 1.1.2.3.1), INFL morphemes sometimes do not function in relative clauses, leaving the clauses unmarked for tense/mood. The first of each pair of examples below illustrates tense/mood marked by a VIC, and the second or later of each pair illustrates it marked by an INFL morpheme. The element illustrating tense/mood is italicized.

2.1.3.2.1. Types of tense

2.1.3.2.1.1. Universal tense There is no marking of universal tense in the language. 2.1.3.2.1.2–3 Past/present tense Past/present tense is marked by the realis
past/present VICS and the past/present INFL morphemes, each in its appropriate grammatical environment as discussed in 2.1.3.2—see (592). Tense is absolute with past/present VICS. Past tense can also be specified by three sentence-final particles that mark degrees of remoteness: ne ‘recent past’ refers to actions done within the last twelve hours; pane ‘mid/remote past’ refers to actions done the day before or any time earlier up to a specified point in time many years ago; and pacara pane ‘historic past’ refers to actions done at some unspecified point in the past. The use of these past tense particles is optional.

The realis past/present can express the present progressive or continuous aspect (to' na wom ‘she is washing clothes’) but only when the action is going on in the presence of the speaker. See 2.1.3.2.1.4, where we discuss a future tense construction that can express the present perfect aspect when the actor is no longer present at the moment of utterance.
2.1.3.2.1.4. Future tense The realis future VICS and the realis future INFL morpheme mark future tense—see example (593). However, the preferred way of expressing future tense is via the future tense verbalized construction discussed in 1.1.1.4.3.2.2. In this construction, the derived verb consists of a verb plus the first person singular or plural inclusive realis future VIC plus an optional object or adjunct. The person of this derived verb is marked by the realis past/present VIC following it—see the discussion and examples. This form can also be said to express intentional mood.

In order to express the present perfect aspect (e.g. ‘He has gone fishing’), when the actor is no longer present at the moment of utterance, the future tense verbalized construction is used. Thus pa' ta' hwam na ‘He will go fishing’ (lit. ‘“I will go fishing”, he (says))’ can also be freely translated as ‘He has gone fishing.’ When so used, it indicates that the state of affairs described is a past action with present consequences.
The sequential verbalized construction discussed in 1.1.1.4.3.3.5 is also commonly used to express future tense. In this construction, the person of the verb is expressed within the derived verb, and the tense/mood is expressed by the VIC following the derived verb. The choice of the third person singular future VIC tara expresses future tense in this construction. Tara is the only VIC that can express future tense in sequential verbalized sentences.

One reason why the simple use of the realis future VICS/INFL morphemes is a less common way to express future tense, is that realis future also expresses a modal value of mere probability.

We understand realis future in 'ON as falling along a continuum of certainty, whose ends are realis past/present and irrealis, respectively. Future realis can indicate certainty but usually carries a degree of uncertainty, indicating that it occupies the middle range of this continuum. A fact may or may not be so; an action may or may not take place, as illustrated in the exchanges in (599) and (600).

Realis future VICS are also used to express the imperative mood and the realis future INFL morpheme ta is used to express the prohibitive mood—see 1.1.1.3. See the examples in this section.
Future is not subdivided according to degrees of remoteness, although the spatial demonstrative cara (without the gloss of ‘always’ or ‘forever’) can also be used, together with the realis future, to denote an unending future action.

There are no tenses relative to a point in the future. 2.1.3.2.2. Tense distinctions in all moods and nonfinite forms Tense is distinguished in the realis past/present and realis future; irrealis makes no
tense distinction. Tense is also distinguished in nonfinite forms, since they require the use of INFL morphemes.

2.1.3.2.3. Absolute vs relative tenses
Tenses are, for the most part, absolute, with the exception of the future tense construction discussed in 2.1.3.2.1.4, which also expresses the present perfect aspect. The tenses in main vs some subordinate clauses are, however, relative, for instance, in time (1.1.2.4.2.1) and irrealis conditional clauses (1.1.2.4.2.5). See the examples in those sections.
2.1.3.3. Aspect
There are no special forms to mark aspect in the language. It is expressed in four different ways: (1) understood in the context of the tense/mood VICS; (2) some appropriate verbal modification, (3) sentence-final temporal particles, or (4) certain verbalized sentences.
2.1.3.3.1. Perfect aspect
One of the future tense constructions discussed in 2.1.3.2.1.4 can express the present perfect aspect—see the discussion following (596). There is no formal marking that makes this a perfect aspect, unless it would be the joint use of the realis future and realis

Morphology 315

past/present VICS, in which the realis future VIC appears on the embedded verb within the future tense predicate, and the realis past/present occurs on the VIC in the matrix clause.
There are no similarities between the present perfect aspect and the past tense. Rather, the form of the present perfect aspect is identical to the future tense construction discussed in the first paragraph of 2.1.3.2.1.4.

2.1.3.4. Mood
Mood is expressed by the three kinds of VICS/INFL morphemes discussed in 2.1.3.2. It moves on a continuum from realis past/present on one end to irrealis on the other. Realis future occupies the middle area of this continuum; at least this is how we characterize its somewhat variable interpretation. In realis past/present, the situation described by the speaker is perceived as being real, something that has already happened or is happening. As it moves up the continuum, realis future is perceived as a situation that has not yet happened, and there is always the possibility that it will not happen, but, usually, it is believed to be likely to happen. On the irrealis end of the spectrum, the situation is perceived as unreal or contrary-to-fact, something that is not likely to happen. See the examples.

2.1.3.4.1. Indicative

2.1.3.4.2. Conditional The notion of conditionality is expressed in COMP sentences in which the operator word mo ‘conditional’ appears in COMP, and the realis future or irrealis appears in INFL. See the discussion and examples in 1.1.2.4.2.5(1).
2.1.3.4.3. Imperative and Prohibitive Imperative mood is expressed by use of realis future or the second person reflexive VICS—see the discussion and examples in 1.1.1.3.1. Prohibitive mood is described in 1.1.1.3.2.
2.1.3.4.4. Optative Optative mood is expressed by the verbalized desiderative sentence, in which irrealis is used—see the discussion and examples in 1.1.1.4.3.3.2.

Wari' 318

2.1.3.4.5. Intentional

Intentional mood is expressed by realis future. It often takes the form of the verbalized future tense sentence (see 1.1.1.4.3.2.2), in which the person of the verb is marked in the realis past/present VIC that follows the derived predicate.

2.1.3.4.7. Potential There are no forms that mark the potential mood exclusively.
2.1.3.4.8. Degree of certainty The modal value of certainty/uncertainty is expressed by realis future—see the paragraph preceding (599) in 2.1.3.2.1.4. The modal value of supposition is expressed by the two kinds of verbalized supposition sentence described in 1.1.1.4.3.2.3, which employ realis past/present and realis future—see the examples in that section.
2.1.3.4.9. Authority for assertion There is no formal way in which the speaker can indicate his authority for making an assertion. The use of direct speech to express the concept of indirect speech, discussed in 1.1.1.1, is, however, a way to express degrees of authority for making an assertion of secondhand information. When active VICS are used following the speech (derived predicate of the verbalized sentence), the information is considered reliable. When

Morphology 319

passive VICS are used, the information is not as reliable, although it does not mean that it is unreliable. See example (1a) and (1b) in 1.1.1.1.

2.1.3.4.12. Narrative
There is no formal marking for narrative mood. The normal tense/mood used in narration is realis past/present.

2.1.3.5. Nonfinite forms

There are two ways of marking nonfinite forms: (1) the infinitival marker wa; and (2) the set of nominal inflectional clitics that marks possession on free and derived nouns—see 1.10. Tense/mood is marked in nonfinite forms by the INFL morpheme preceding the verb.

2.1.3.6. Person, number, tense/mood, gender, human-nonhuman

2.1.3.6.1. Coding of subject and direct object/indirect object/benefactive
Table 2.1 offers, at a glance, the different categories of verbal inflectional clitics that mark agreement with the subject and direct object/indirect object/benefactive of verbs. All VICS follow the verb. All the verbal inflectional clitics in Table 2.1 indicate person and number. Some of them also indicate tense/mood, and others indicate third person gender. In addition, number is indicated in verbs that have a singular and plural form. A more complete discussion follows.
2.1.3.6.1.1. Subject The person and number of the subject must be coded in the VIC. In addition, tense/mood is coded in the Tense VICS, and third person gender is coded in the Tenseless VICS (which usually co-occur with INFL). There are three sets of Tense VICS: realis past/present, realis future, and irrealis; they occur in simple sentences. There is a single set of Tenseless VICS which occurs in most COMP sentences. They must also be used when a small class of verbal modifiers functions in simple sentences—see
Table 2.1 Categories of verbal inflectional clitics

Active

realis past/present realis future irrealis

Non-active passive 1

Tenseless
simple uninflected passive 2

Object
object reflexive/reciprocal

1.1.1.4.1 and 1.1.1.4.2. Passive 1 VICS (‘Tense’) are like Tense active VICS in not cooccurring with INFL, but are unlike them in not expressing tense themselves. Passive 2 VICS (‘Tenseless’) function like Tenseless active VICS in co-occurring with INFL.
Subject person is coded by the choice of the appropriate subject VIC. In addition, subject humanness/nonhumanness is coded by the choice of singular vs plural subject VICS: only humans can be marked by plural VICS; both singular and plural nonhumans must be marked by singular VICS. Subject number is also coded by the correct choice of the intransitive verb (see 2.2.3.1, where we discuss agreement of subject/object with singular and plural verb forms). Both human and nonhuman plural subjects must be marked by the plural form of intransitive verbs.

2.1.3.6.1.2–4. Direct object/indirect object/benefactive The person, number and third person gender of the object may be coded in the VIC. The single set of object morphemes occurs as suffixes on subject morphemes, with this pair of affixes functioning together as a postverbal clitic. The object morphemes agree with the person and number of all objects, and gender of third person objects, whether overt or covert (see 2.1.2.3.1).

The same rules for coding person and number in the subject also apply to objects. In addition to coding object number by the correct choice of the object affix, it can also be coded by the correct choice of the form of the verb, if it is one of the transitive verbs that has a singular and plural form. In contrast to intransitive verbs, where both human and nonhuman plural subjects must be indicated, when possible, by the plural form of the verb, transitive verbs do not always require the use of plural forms to indicate plural objects. The plural form of transitive verbs can clarify the number of the object, but it also describes the scope of the action. Less intense actions of a shorter duration tend to be marked by singular forms, while more intense actions of a longer duration tend to be marked by plural forms. The choice of the singular or plural form of the verb in these situations depends on how the speaker views the situation; it is largely subjective.

2.1.3.6.2. Marking of agreement

2.1.3.6.2.1. Marking of agreement on the verb Agreement is not marked on the verb. 2.1.3.6.2.2. Person marking clitics The verbal inflectional clitics that mark for
person, number, and gender are verbal enclitics. We offer the following arguments that these are not affixes:
(1) VICS can occur alone as responses. Observe the examples in the following exchanges:

Morphology 323

(2) VICS fail to undergo word-internal phonological changes which ordinarily happen when morphemes are suffixed to nouns. For example, in the derived noun copari’ ‘our maternal grandmother’ (co-pa'-'iri' INFL:m/frp/ p-maternal:grandmother: 1s-1pincl) two phonological changes take place when ‘iri’ is suffixed to pa': there is vocalic harmony (a+i=a) and the glottal is deleted—see 3.2.6.4 for the complete discussion of vowel harmony. By contrast, VICS that follow verbs do not undergo these phonological changes.

(3) VICS do not alter the norms for syllable final stress in words. The last syllable of

VICS bears secondary stress, while the last syllable of verbs bears primary stress.

(4) VICS bear secondary stress. The general rule for stress is that primary stress falls on the last syllable of the word, and secondary stress, if there is any, precedes it. If VICS were suffixes, they would provide the only exception to this stress rule in the language: secondary stress would follow primary stress (622a).
To summarize, these are clitics that behave like separate words outside of compounding processes (see kinship terms in (624) that make one word out of two or more words).
The paradigms of all the VICS are shown in Table 2.2.

(1) These object suffixes attach only to first person plural exclusive subject morphemes—see the discussion following (628) in this section. (2) Tense third person VICS do not inflect for gender.

Subject and object portions of the verbal inflectional clitic are treated themselves as affixes, i.e. in relation to Vowel Harmony and stress, the two portions of the VIC behave as though they form a single root or are two suffixes on a single root. It might be possible to consider the subject portion of the VIC as the head of the VIC. This is partially supported by the fact that, in general, subject agreement is obligatory, while object agreement is optional. Thus object agreement may not usually occur without subject agreement. However, there are some (rare) cases that have been observed with first person and third person object, where object agreement may occur without subject agreement.

There are some further morphophonological features of VICS which warrant mention here.
(i) There are suppletive forms for combinations with second person subjects. For second person plural subjects, the expected form for realis past/ present and Tenseless would be hwepa'; and for irrealis would be xihwepa'. The actual forms however are mahu' and ximahu', respectively. The forms hepa' and xihepa' are acceptable forms in the

Wari' 326
'Oro Mon, 'Oro Waram, and 'Oro Waram Xijein dialects. Combinations of second person realis future subjects plus first person objects also produce suppletive forms:

(ii) Third person feminine of Tenseless active subject morphemes appears as the masculine form when suffixed by all but the third person neuter object morphemes, for example:

However,

(iii) The first person plural exclusive subject forms 'urut, xut, and xuxut, which are used alone to indicate the subject without an object suffix, appear in the same form as the first person plural inclusive subject forms ('iri', xi', and xixi') when they take an object suffix. Compare the following examples, which illustrate first person plural inclusive and exclusive taking object suffixes.

(iv) Furthermore, rather than taking the object suffixes shown in Table 2.2, the form of the object suffixes on first person plural exclusive subjects is identical to the second and third person inflected forms of the preposition: pum ‘second singular’, con ‘third singular masculine’, cam ‘third singular feminine’, pain ‘third neuter’, pahu' ‘second plural’, cocon ‘third plural masculine’ and cacam ‘third plural feminine’—see (626)–(628) above.
2.1.3.6.2.3. Number marked in the form of the verb Some verbs have two forms: singular/less intense and plural/more intense. Many pairs of forms are suppletive, as shown in the following examples:

(629) a.

Mao

na.

go:s

3s:rp/p

‘He went.’

(629) b.

‘They went.’

(630) b.

Wixicao'

nain. na-in

throw:p

3s:rp/p-3n

‘He threw them away.’

Many of the plural/more intense verbs are formed by partial reduplication of the singular/less intense verb. This is accomplished by infixing the syllable rv, where v reduplicates the following (stressed) vowel immediately preceding the stressed (i.e. final) syllable of the verb. Note the reduplicated form of wixicao' ‘throw (p)’ (suppletive of xin ‘throw (s)’) in (634b), where the plural form is further intensified.

In general, the number of the subject governs the form of an intransitive verb, while the number of the object governs the form of a transitive verb. Most of the verbs whose plural form is achieved by infixing rv prior to the stressed syllable are intransitives, whereas most of the verbs whose plural form is achieved by cv or cvcv reduplication prior to the stressed syllable are intransitives.

(637) a.

In verb compounds consisting of a transitive verb plus an intransitive verb, even though the subject of the intransitive verb is marked as the object of the verb compound, its number still governs the form of the intransitive verb.

2.1.3.6.3. Conditioning factors for marking agreement There are no conditioning factors for marking agreement.

2.1.3.6.4. Features of the noun phrase coded in the verb Person, number, third person gender, and definiteness are marked in the VICS.

2.1.3.6.5. Coding affected by discrepancy between syntactic and semantic features

Discrepancies may arise in gender when referring to males and females as a group. When it is explicitly known that a group consists of males and females, the group is referred to as feminine. Reference to mixed genders involving nonhumans (masculine and neuter, or feminine and neuter), are handled by parataxis, as in the following example.

2.1.3.6.6. Exceptions to verb agreement rules
Agreement for person and number are the same for all tense/moods and voices. Agreement for third person gender is also the same for all tense/ moods and voices, although VICS used in simple sentences do not (normally) indicate gender; the criterion for this exception, however, is sentence type, not tense/mood or voice.

2.1.3.6.7. Identity between subjects of verbs
The identity or nonidentity between the subject of a verb and the subject of the following or preceding verb is not indicated.

2.1.3.6.8–9. Reflexive and reciprocal forms of the verb
The set of reflexive/reciprocal VICS discussed in 1.6 and 1.7 and shown in Table 2.2 is used to mark reflexivity and reciprocality of the verb. There are no special reflexive/reciprocal stem forms.

2.1.3.6.10. Marking of actions involving motion

There is one postverbal modifier, qui' ‘coming this way’, that indicates movement toward the speaker; and one verb mao/mama' ‘to go’, that occurs in postverbal modification position to indicate movement away from the speaker.

Wari' 332

There is also a category of orientation involving two sentence-final clitics: me ‘orientation toward the speaker’ and 'e' ‘orientation away from the speaker’. Their use is optional. Me is used primarily in constructions involving the first person, whether overtly expressed or not; 'e' can occur in any construction except prohibitives. Their distribution is complementary. See the discussion and examples in 1.1.1.3.

2.1.3.6.11. Distinction between different modes of body orientation No distinction is made between different modes of body orientation.

2.1.3.6.12. Incorporation of verbal elements There is no incorporation in the language—see 2.2.3.1.2.

2.1.4. Nominal modification

Nominal modification, expressed in many languages via adjectives, is expressed in ‘ON by nouns (but see 1.2.5.2.5, for a discussion of demonstratives which could possibly be considered adjectives). Attributive modification is handled like a possessive phrase: the first syntactically nominal element occurs with a genitive morpheme (nominal inflectional clitic or suffix) and is understood as modifying the second noun. These genitive nominal elements can have the form of derived nouns (641a) or -xi' nouns (641b). In addition, one derived kinship term can also be glossed as a modifier (641c).

2.1.4.1. Distinctions between predicative and attributive forms of modification

When a modified element is realized as a (surface) verb, the modification is predicative. When the modifier is realized as a (surface) noun, the modification is attributive. There are a few -xi' nouns that inflect only for third person (first and second person may not be used for possession with these particular -xi' nouns); these words use the same form for predicative and attributive modification.

In all other cases, there is a distinction between predicative and attributive forms of modification as follows:
(1) In -xi' nouns, the first person singular form functions as the complement to a copula (predicative), whereas attributive modification is expressed by the third person inflection.

2.1.4.2. Distinction between absolute and contingent state There is no formal distinction between an absolute and a contingent state in 'ON.

2.1 .4.3. Agreement between modification and nouns

Except for the small class of -xi' nouns that inflect only for third person (see 2.1.4.2, first paragraph and examples), predicative modifier stems do not agree with the noun (although the VIC attached to them does). On the other hand, all attributive modifiers agree with the noun in number and third person gender. This information must be expressed whether the noun appears overtly or not. Conflict between the gender of coordinated nouns is resolved by parataxis.

2.1.4.4. Comparison

Comparison and degree of quality are expressed by juxtaposed sentences showing similarity or contrasts.

2.1.4.5. Degrees of quality

Most degrees of quality are expressed by modification of the verb root via compounding. Such a sentence may look like the contrasting sentence of a comparison pair, as illustrated in the examples in the preceding section.

2.1.4.6. Verbal categories with predicative modification

With predicative modification, the verbal categories are expressed on the VIC.

2.1.5. Prepositions

There is one preposition that expresses all the semantic functions of prepositions—see 2.1.1.1.4. This preposition agrees with the noun it governs for person, number and third person gender. The paradigm of the inflected preposition is as follows:

first singular

pata'

second singular

pum

third singular masculine

con

third singular feminine

cam

third neuter

2.1.6. Numerals and quantifiers

2.1.6.1. Forms of numerals used in counting
Although there is a way to express ‘one’ and ‘two’ as attributes, numerals used in counting do not exist in 'ON. Since the contact with Brazilian society, Portuguese numerals have come to be used for counting.

2.1.6.2. Distinct cardinal numeral forms used as attributes

There is one compound verb that expresses the notion of cardinal numerals used as an attribute: xica' pe ‘to be alone’, used as ‘one’. It is always used to express ‘one’, that is, the Portuguese numeral um is never used. There is another compound verb, tucu caracan ‘to face each other’, that used to be used as ‘two’ but is rarely used nowadays; rather the Portuguese numeral dois is used. Dois ‘two’ (masculine form of Portuguese ‘two’) is used irrespective of the gender of the noun it modifies. New numerals take the Portuguese form and occur as a simple verb (see (655c–d)). Numerals (both 'ON and loan numerals) appear in verbal position with the syntax of intransitive verbs.

Cardinal numerals may be used attributively in derived noun constructions, as illustrated in the examples in (657). This, however, seems to be a recent innovation, an attempt to conform to the Portuguese numerical system, expressing numerals as attributive modifiers as they would any other kind of nominal modification (see 2.1.4).

2.1.6.3. Distinct numerals for counting different kinds of objects There are no distinct numerals for counting different kinds of objects.

2.1.6.4. Ordinal numerals

Ordinal numerals do not exist. This notion is expressed by parataxis, often employing cardinal numerals.

2.1.6.5. Other derivatives of numerals. There are no derivatives of numerals.

2.1.6.6. Quantifiers

Most quantifiers take the form of verbs, although there is one quantifier, 'oro ‘collective’, which functions as a prenominal modifier. The quantifiers which take verbal forms exclusively are: paric ‘to be few’, pije' ‘to be few (lit. child)’, tocwan ‘to be several’, tamana ‘to be many, to be much’, 'iri' mijo ‘to be many’, xam' ‘to be all of it’ and pi' pin ‘to be all’ (lit. ‘finish completely'). Xam' ‘to be all of it’ and pi' pin ‘to be all’ usually require repetition of the verb preceding it. The examples in (659) to (662) show quantifiers appearing in head and nonhead positions of compound verbs.

2.1.7. Verbal modification Verbal modification is discussed in 1.2.1.3.1.1 above. See also 2.1.4.4–5.
2.1.8. Clitics and particles
2.1.8.1. Types of clitics
2.1.8.1.1. Pronoun clitics There are three kinds of pronominal clitics:

Morphology 343
1 A set of proclitics (co ‘masculine’, cam ‘feminine’, ‘i neuter’, and caram ‘plural’) precedes demonstratives to form demonstrative pronouns. They occur only in the third person—see the discussion and examples in 2.1.2.2.
2 Postverbal inflection; see 2.1.3.6.2.2. 3 Postnominal inflection; see 2.1.8.1.2.
2.1.8.1.2. Possessive pronoun clitics A set of nominal inflectional clitics occurs in derived nouns and with some nouns in NPS. They belong to the same person/number/gender marking system as VICS. See the discussion and examples in 1.10.
2.1.8.1.3–4. Reflexive/reciprocal pronoun clitics A set of reflexive/reciprocal pronoun clitics belongs to the system of verbal inflectional clitics described in 2.1.3.6.2.2. See also 1.6 and 1.7.
2.1.8.1.5. Auxiliary verbs There are no auxiliary verbs.
2.1.8.1.6. Sentence particles There are four classes of sentence particles. 1 Temporal particles: ne, pane, pacara pane, 'ira. They occur sentence-finally. See
2.1.3.2.1.2–3 for a more complete discussion and examples. 2 Emphatic particles: ta; 'e' /me; ca' /ma' /ne/pane 'ira and ca'/ma' /ne/pane quira, wa,
wira and nowa (spoken by men); and je, cama (spoken by women). Some of these emphatic particles can co-occur. They occur sentence-finally. See 1.11 for a more complete discussion and examples. 3 ‘Rhetorical’ particles: ra and its alternate forms ron/ram/rain/roron/ raram; xin…ne/pane; and na' nam/na'non—see 1.1.1.2.1.2, where the position and function of all these particles are discussed and illustrated. 4 Dubitative particle xi'; see 1.1.2.4.2.1(3).
2.1.8.1.7 Sentence connectives There are no morphemes which function exclusively as sentence connectives.
2.1.8.1.8. Anaphoric particles The particle quem refers to something already mentioned or implied. It is sometimes glossed as ‘also’—see 1.1.1.2.1.
2.1.8.1.9. INFL morphemes

Wari' 344
The five INFL morphemes are clitics: ca ‘neuter realis past/present’, co ‘masculine/feminine realis past/present’, 'iri' ‘realis past present’, ta ‘realis future’ and xi ‘irrealis’. See 1.1.1.4.2, where INFL morphemes are discussed and illustrated.
2.1.8.1.10. Operator words The following superordinate sentence-level operator words occur in COMP: ma' ‘that proximate to hearer’; mon ‘that proximate to hearer-3sm’; mam ‘that proximate to hearer3sf’; main ‘that proximate to hearer-3n’; 'om ‘not exist’; cain', derived from ‘that neuter distal’; je ‘third person neuter emphatic pronoun’; mo ‘conditional’; 'ac ‘like’; and 'ane ‘different’. The third person neuter preposition, pain, precedes subordinate clauses (as well as NPS). These operator words behave like clitics in COMP position and elsewhere, as independent words (except pain, which always behaves like an independent word). See 1.1.1.4.2, where operator words are discussed and illustrated.
2.1.8.2. Positions occupied by clitics
2.1.8.2.1. Preverbal The only preverbal clitics are the INFL morphemes—see 2.1.8.1.9 and 2.1.8.2.5.
2.1.8.2.2. Postverbal See 2.1.3.6.2.2 for verbal inflectional enclitics. The nominal inflectional clitics also occur after the verb in a derived noun construction—see 2.1.8.1.2. The ‘rhetorical’ particle xin follows the VIC—see 2.1.8.1.6.
2.1.8.2.3. Sentence-final The temporal, emphatic, and anaphoric particles occur sentence-finally—see 2.1.8.1.6 and 2.1.8.1.8. Of the ‘rhetorical’ particles, only ra (and its variants) and na' nam/na' non occur sentence-finally—see 2.1.8.1.6.
2.1.8.2.4. Sentence-initial The only sentence-initial clitics are the operator words in COMP and the INFL clitic in prohibitive sentences—see 2.1.8.1.10 and 1.1.1.3.2.
2.1.8.2.5. Sentence-second position Tense/mood occupies second position in the sentence. In simple sentences, where the verb occurs sentence-initially, tense/mood is on the VIC. In COMP sentences, where the operator word occurs sentence-initially, tense/mood is on the INFL. In addition, two of the three INFL morphemes that function in realis past/present constructions make it possible to indicate the gender of the element that is referenced in COMP: ca ‘neuter’ and

Morphology 345

co ‘masculine/feminine’. The other three INFL morphemes ('iri ‘realis past/present’, ta ‘realis future’, and xi ‘irrealis’) do not indicate gender. Examples (664) show tense/mood marked on the VIC; examples (665) show tense/mood marked on the INFL morpheme.

The only exceptions to INFL as a second position clitic are found in prohibitive sentences (see 1.1.1.3.2) and nominal modification clauses (see 1.1.2.3).

2.1.8.2.6. Pre-adjectival The set of proclitics described in 2.1.8.1.1 occur before demonstratives.

Wari' 346
2.1.8.2.7. Pre-subject
Inflected ‘rhetorical’ particles occur before the subject if it is expressed—see 1.1.1.2.1.2.
2.1.8.3. Relative order of clitics
The relative order of postverbal clitics is first VIC, then the ‘rhetorical’ particle xin. There are five sets of sentence-final particles, classified according to their sequence of occurrence from left-to-right: (1) temporal particles, followed by (2) the emphatic particles other than those in set 5, followed by (3) the referent particle quem, followed by (4) the emphatic particle ta, followed by (5) the emphatic particles that have restricted use (one set spoken by men, the other spoken by women).
2.1.8.4. Combinations of particles
Except for the temporal particle pane ‘mid/remote past’, which may precede 'ira ‘past progressive’, the members of each of the five sets of sentence-final particles are mutually exclusive. There do not seem to be any restrictions on the combination of sets of particles. It is unlikely, however, that five sentence-final particles would occur in one sequence.
2.2. DERIVATIONAL MORPHOLOGY
2.2.1. Introduction
In this section, we deviate somewhat from the suggested outline in order to present more effectively some of the highly unusual, perhaps unique, features of 'ON derivational morphology. There are various derivational processes in the language, but two are worth special mention here, since they are used to derive both nouns and verbs. These are zeroderivation and compounding. Other derivational processes, e.g. iteration and suffixation, are discussed in the final subsections of this section. The process of zero-derivation is of particular interest to all theoretical and typological morphologists, because by this process words may be derived from sentences. This requires us to allow the derivational morphological component of 'ON grammar to apply to both the input and output of sentence formation, something which some syntactic and morphological theories predict to be impossible. Compounding provides additional evidence for this claim. We are going to argue too that all words in 'ON are left-headed, whether derived by inflectional or derivational processes.
We have organized this section around derivational processes, rather than by the categories which undergo these processes (e.g. N and V), since for the most part, the processes described may apply to similar input categories to derive nouns or verbs (although there are interesting differences in the nature of the input category).

Morphology 347

2.2.2. Zero-derivation
Zero-derivation is the process whereby words of one syntactic category are derived from other syntactic categories without affixation (e.g. English He is the head of the committee; He heads the committee; I will give you a permit; I will permit you). The only phonological reflex of zero-derivation in ‘ON is the stress shift seen when the category serving as input to the derivational process is larger than a single word. All words receive primary stress on their final syllable, modulo certain stress-avoiding postverbal modifying morphemes, regardless of how many words formed the input to the derivational process (as in the case of sentences used as verbs). See 2.2.2.1.1 and 3.3.2 below on stress.

2.2.2.1. Verbs

2.2.2.1.1. Zero-derivation from sentences

Verbalized sentences are discussed in section 1.1.1.4.3. The verb in such sentences is always derived (at least partially) via zero-derivation from clauses, according to the rule in (666):

(666)

[Sent] → [V[S]]

Consider the structure in (667)

(667) [V[Sent

coll

woman

‘“Who went to Guajará?” (said) the chief (to) the women.’

nain na-in 3s:rp/p-3n taramaxicon.
chief

The stress pattern of the verbalized sentence prior to the application of rule (666) would

be as in (668):

(668)

2Ma' co 1mao nain Guaja2rá?

The COMP word ma' and the final syllable of Guajará bear secondary stresses, with the primary stress of the utterance falling on the verb mao 'to go'. In the verbalized version, however, the stress pattern is as in (669):
(669)
The primary stress has shifted from mao to the final syllable of Guajará, just as we would expect in any polysyllabic word (see section 3.3.2).

Wari' 348

Note too that the matrix inflectional clitic nanam attaches to Guajará. Normally this clitic would only be able to attach to the verb. Moreover, there is no verb of the matrix clause if we deny this status to the verbalized sentence. Stress, clitic attachment and matrix clause structure thus support our analysis of these sentences as having undergone the zero-derivation rule in (666) above. Further support for this rule is provided by compounding. Consider example (670):

(670)

Pan'

'am

ta'] tara]] ma']]

fall:s be:lost:s

1s:rf 3s:rf that:prox:hearer

'inon

xa'.

'ina-on

1s:rp/p-3sm

younger:brother:1s

‘I thought my younger brother was going to get lost.’ (lit. ‘“‘I will probably get lost’, he will probably (say)”, I (thought) (of) my younger brother.’)

In this example there are several ‘embeddings’ resulting from zero-derivation and, at the last layer, compounding. Sent1 is the simple sentence ‘I will (probably) get lost.’ This is verbalized as the verb (v1) of sentence Sent2, reporting the likely speech of the (final) speaker’s younger brother. This Sent2 is then verbalized (v2) to form a compound verb with ma' (a common postverbal modifier, see 1.2.1.3), v3. v3 then serves as the verb of the matrix clause, to which 'inon attaches and in which xa' is the object. A simplified phonetic transcription of (670) is given in (671) (primary stress is marked by [1] and secondary stress is marked by [2]):
(671)

The strongest stress of the utterance goes on the final stressable syllable of the compound verb (v3 in (670)). Ma' is unstressable in the postverbal modifier position and so the next available syllable for bearing stress is [ra]. The stress facts are thus exactly as our account predicts. The fact that ma' can compound with the derived verb v2 in (670) provides quite strong support for our analysis of these sentences as resulting from the derivational rule in (666) above.

2.2.2.1.2. Zero-derivation from nominate

2.2.2.1.2.1. Zero-derivation from emphatic pronouns Verbs can also be zero-derived from emphatic pronouns, as in (672):

(672)

[EP]→[V[EP]]

Consider the example in (673):

(673) Ma'

wirico

exist emph:3sm

‘There was Pinom.’

na 3s:rp/p

Pinom m:name

ma'. that:prox:hearer

Morphology 349

In this example, the emphatic pronoun wirico has been compounded with the verb ma' ‘to exist’. Since it is part of the verb, it could have been placed there either by incorporation or by compounding. Incorporation seems unlikely, however, since the position from which wirico would have been incorporated is presumably occupied by Pinom. (Additional arguments against incorporation are given in 2.2.3.1.2.2.)
In our data, emphatic pronouns can only appear as noncompounded verbs in copular structures, as in Wirico na ‘It is he himself.’ Emphatic pronouns in compounds behave like modifiers. We can capture this fact if we recognize a separate category of verb root, the modifier verb root, alongside nonmodifying verb roots, as in (674):

(674) a.

[VM]

(674) b.

[V]

Only [V] verbs may serve as noncompounded verbs or heads of (i.e. appear in leftmost position of) compound verbs. All postverbal modifiers discussed in section 1.2.1.3.1.1 are of type (674a). We analyse preverbal modifiers as a subtype of (674b) and merely use the term modifier to indicate that they do not have particularly ‘verby’ core semantics and cannot serve as main verbs. We therefore modify our rule in (672) above to (675):

(675)

[EP] → [VM [EP]] (or [V[EP]] for copular sentences)

2.2.2.1.2.2. Zero-derivation from nouns Any noun can be made into a verb via zeroderivation, although the process seems more common with -xi' nouns. Moreover, any

Wari' 350

form of the noun (first, second, third) may undergo zero-derivation. If a noun has both a xi' and a non-xi' form, the -xi' form will generally (not always) be preferred. The form used affects the translation markedly, however. Modulo some individual variations (which is to be expected if this process is lexical), the general rule seems to be that if the first person singular form of the noun (whether -xi' noun or noun plus NIC) undergoes zero-derivation, the resultant verb is active, often taking an agentive or volitional subject. When a nonfirst person form of the noun serves as input to verb derivation, the result is either a descriptive predicate or, in compound forms, an adverbial-like translation of the denominalized portion of the compound. These are illustrated in the examples which follow.
The rule of zero-derivation is given in (677):

(677)

[N] → [V [N]]

This means that denominalized verbs, like other verbs, may appear in noncompounded forms or as the leftmost or second member of a verbal compound. Examples of these follow (with nonderived forms in the (a) examples):

2.2.2.1.2.3. Zero-derivation from nominal modifiers There are no verbs derived from nominal modifiers.

2.2.2.2. Nouns
Zero-derivation of nouns from verbs and subsentences is common. There are a couple of possible instances of zero-derivation of nouns from inflectional clitics as well, but these seem to be unproductive and quite peculiar in other ways. Nevertheless we will mention them here for completeness.

2.2.2.2.1. Zero-derivation from subsentential constituents

Nouns are unlike verbs in that they may not be formed from the zero-derivation of entire sentences (i.e. COMP sentences). They may never include a COMP word. However, zero-derivation of the following strings of material is possible.
2.2.2.2.1.1. Zero-derivation from INFL+v The first string we will consider is the INFL morpheme ca ‘neuter realis past/present’ and v:

Examples like (704d) involve two levels of zero-derivation. First, tarama' ‘man’ undergoes zero-derivation to form a verb, ‘to (be a) man’ or ‘to grow’. Next, it and ca undergo zero-derivation to form a noun, to which is attached the NIC, nexi' ‘possessive1pincl’. The question which arises with regard to these examples is the nature of the constituent formed by the INFL+verb unit which undergoes zero-derivation. It does not seem possible to merely analyse the INFL morpheme as a prefix on the verb for two important reasons. First, this would leave us with no account for the fact that ca must precede the verb in order to guarantee that tense be the second constituent in the clause. Second, this would fail to account for the fact that in normal matrix and subclauses, the gender information on the INFL morpheme does not agree with the subject or object per se, but with the content of the COMP node.
Consider the first problem, i.e. the requirement that tense always appear as the second constituent of the clause. If tense/mood were a verbal affix, it would be the second constituent of the clause whenever its ‘host’, the v, followed overt COMP. But it would be the first constituent whenever the verb appeared in initial position, whether or not it was prefixed or suffixed to the verb, since notions like first or second constituent cannot ‘look through layers’. That is, the restriction cannot be ‘second morphological or syntactic constituent’, it must be one or the other. In fact, for 'ON, it must be ‘second syntactic constituent’ because when question phrases appear in COMP (see 1.1.1.4.2 above on information questions), the INFL morpheme may not intervene between them, meaning that tense must be the second phrasal constituent (we assume that VICS are generated outside the verb phrase in agreement phrases, AGRPS). As for the fact that INFL agrees in gender with the material in COMP, we claim that this is because the INFL morpheme heads the phrasal projection in which COMP occurs at surface structure (i.e. it winds up in co position and information questions and other COMP material are in the SPEC (=specifier) position of the COMP phrase (CP)). However, we shall not argue here for these more abstract structures. Suffice it to say that the VICS never agree directly with material in COMP, so that if INFL were a verbal prefix, it would be a very strange one in that its gender is controlled by sentence-initial position rather than by standard grammatical relations, e.g. subject and object.
But if INFL is not a verbal prefix, what is it? We will claim that it is the head of its own Tense Phrase (TP) and that the verb adjoins to it. It is this INFL+v adjunction

Wari' 358

structure which then undergoes zero-derivation to form a noun. The VICS, heading as they do separate phrasal constituents under our analysis (AGRPS) can be omitted from the scope of the nominalization rule. For readers who have an aversion to such terminology, the bottom line is that we must allow INFL+v to form a constituent which excludes the VICS but which does not merely analyse INFL as a prefix on the verb.
To head off a potential counteranalysis: we consider the forms in (704) above to be derived from verbs plus INFL, rather than from subordinate clauses, because they do not contain VICS or NP arguments. A possible objection to analysing these as derived nouns (rather than phrases) might be raised on phonological grounds. In (705) below, the wordinitial glottal immediately following the INFL morpheme fails to delete. However, in the formation of kinship terms, which are clearly used as individual nouns (see 2.2.2.2.1.5), the glottal stop does delete in this same environment. However, we believe that kinship terms are idiomatic, crystallized forms that have been reanalysed as single words, and that they do not represent a productive word-formation process. Thus, they do not prejudice our claims here.

As for the form of the NIC appearing on this type of structure, the gender of the possessor determines which form of the third person NIC can be used; masculine NICS cannot be used with words referring to women, and vice versa.

While all verbs derived from -xi' nouns can function in derived nouns with the infinitival marker wa, not all such verbs can function in derived
nouns with possession marking NICS. For instance, if the relationship between the noun and its possessor is purely possessive, the regular possessed noun must be used: xirinain mapac (house-3n corn) ‘corn house’, not *ca xuru nein mapac (INFL:nrp/p house-1s poss:3n corn); tapa' napa' wina me (burst 3s:rp/p-1s head-1s emph) ‘my head is hurting me’, not *tapa' napa' ca wina ne me (burst 3s:rp/p-1s INFL:nrp/p head-1s poss:1s emph). On the other hand, if the derived verb is expressing an event or process ((708)– (711)), or if the relationship between the noun and its possessor is descriptive ((712)– (713)), it can be used in a possessed derived noun:

2.2.2.2.1.2. Zero-derivation from Verb+VIC Zero-derivation of nouns can also differ from the above process and exclude the INFL morpheme while including the VIC. In such examples, however, a nominal inflectional clitic cannot be added. In (718a) below, the noun is zero-derived from a verb, mam toc ‘drink with’. In (718b), it is zero-derived from the verb+VIC. (718c) shows that these cannot co-occur.

Only Tenseless VICS may occur within the scope of zero-derivation. The prohibition, illustrated in (718c), against adding NICS to a zero-derived nominal including a VIC can be explained if we assume that the features of the VIC are still visible/syntactically relevant after the zero-derivation process and that something like Marantz’s (1984) prohibition against vacuous affixation (or Chomsky’s (1993) ‘economy’ principle) is in effect. To sum up, then, zero-affixation may derive a noun from a verb+VIC, excluding INFL, but (i) VICS must be Tenseless; and (ii) no NIC may be added.
2.2.2.2.1.3. Zero-derivation of clauses with NP arguments We have a few examples of nouns derived from clauses, in which the NP constituents of the clause are present (object and/or subject). However, these differ from simple subordinate clause structures in that the verb is usually iterated and there is no VIC.

2.2.2.2.1.4. Zero-derivation of wa ‘infinitive’ clauses To derive a nonpossessed noun, a wa infinitival clause may undergo zero-derivation:

INFL:nrp/p

take:s

inf

man

‘marriage’ (for a woman)

Example (720c) is interesting in that it shows an overt NP, tarama' ‘man’, within the scope of zero-derivation. Recall from section 1.1.2.2.6.3 that wa has a passivization effect in that it may not co-occur with an agent/actor NP but only with a theme NP. Another example is:

(720) d.

Some of these might merely be analysed as infinitive clauses, but since they may also function as nouns, we include them here as a potential example of zero-derivation.

We have two examples of derived nouns, in which the verb is iterated and the infinitival marker wa is used. The example in (722a) is the name of a river in the region, well known for its abundance of game birds. The base form in (722b) is a verb derived from a -xi' noun. As a verb, it means ‘to be fleshy’. See 2.2.2.1, where we describe these ‘derived verbs’.

2.2.2.2.1.5. Kinship terms Kinship terms are the only examples we have of zero-derived nouns from clauses containing both INFL and VICS. These seem to be opaque to native speakers (i.e. they do not think of their individual parts); they undergo phonological processes other zero-derived nouns fail to undergo; and the process no longer seems productive, since only kinship terms are so derived. Co- kinship terms are formed in the following way: the INFL morpheme co precedes the first person singular form of the kinship term and a Tenseless active VIC follows it.

Note in (723b) that the use of the first person singular form of older sister we supports our analysis, wherein we has first been verbalized via zero-derivation and then combined with co and 'iri' to form a noun zero-derived from a clause (with a literal translation like ‘we older sister’). Examples (724a–d) illustrate co- kinship terms with the first person plural inclusive Tenseless VIC, expressing the notion of possessive and occurring as a suffix (stress falls on the last syllable of the VIC). Examples (724e–g) illustrate cokinship terms with second and third person Tenseless VICS expressing possessive and occurring as a separate clitic (stress falls on the base form).

Co- kinship terms are words and not merely relative clauses. This can be seen by the fact that (1) they can function with elements normally found in NPS (collective particles (725a), possessors (725b) and demonstratives (725c)); and (2) they also function semantically as nouns. The Tenseless VICS that occur with co- kinship terms express the notion of possessive.

The complete list of the basic forms of co- kinship terms, with their primary meanings is as follows: te ‘my father or paternal uncle’; 'aji' ‘my older brother or maternal uncle’; we ‘my older sister or paternal aunt’; xa' ‘my younger sibling’; pa' ‘my maternal grandmother’; jeo' ‘my paternal grandparent or maternal grandfather’; nowin ‘my sister’s

Morphology 367

daughter (male ego)’; and nem ‘my brother-in-law (sister’s husband)’. The remaining kinship terms take the form of -xi' nouns. There is one additional kinship term that neither uses co-, nor could be described as a relative clause. It refers to the child of a man: panxita' (child-1s) ‘my child’, panxima (child-2s) ‘your (s) child’, etc.
Kinship term constituents form a tighter phonological unit than other nouns derived from co. This can be seen in certain phonological changes which take place in the derived form, in particular, asyllabification and glottal deletion. For example, when co precedes 'aji' ‘my older brother’, as in cwaji' ca ‘his older brother’, the word-initial glottal plosive

on 'aji'

is dropped, and co becomes a labialized dorso-velar plosive. This

phonological change does not occur anywhere else when co precedes a word beginning

with a glottal-vowel sequence, as shown in (726b).

The first person plural VICS also show a more intimate phonological connection to the derived kinship term than in nominalized sentences: (1) the word-initial glottal on 'iri' ‘1pincl’ and 'urut ‘1pexcl’, as well as word-final glottals where applicable, are dropped; (2) vocalic harmony occurs between the root and suffix; and (3) primary stress is transferred from the basic form of the kinship term to the last syllable of the VIC.

Headless co relative clauses in which the relativized person or thing is nonsubject, and which function in NPS, could also be argued to be derived nouns.

2.2.2.2.2. Zero-derivation of nouns from verbs
A few nouns are derived from verbs simply by zero-derivation. This process is not productive, but it is semantically regular. We have the following examples: horon ‘old person’ is the plural, intense form of the verb hwara' ‘to be big’; mo'o ‘bearer of death news’, when used as a verb, means ‘to notify of a death and bring back the mourners’; mowa ‘poison vine’ means ‘to kill fish’ by crushing the poison vine and squeezing the juices into a dammed up area of the river; and wac, used by most sub-groups to signify ‘knife’, while meaning ‘to cut’ as a verb. In addition, many nouns (names of animals, birds, fish and objects) could be said to be derived from verbs, since they are onomatopoeic terms (direct speeches), which are handled as verbs in the language. See 4.1 for examples.

Morphology 369

2.2.2.3. Zero-derivation of operator words
Operator words, which mark moods or movement in the sentence and occur in COMP, are zero-derived from various word classes: demonstrative, pronoun, preposition and verb. They are semantically regular in that their meanings are fairly transparent and their origins are clear:
ma' signals interrogation (from ma' ‘that proximate to hearer’)
'om signals negation (from 'om ‘to not exist’)
je signals affirmation (from je ‘third person neuter emphatic pronoun’)
'ac signals indication of resemblance (from 'ac ‘to be like’)
mo signals condition (possibly from mo ‘list presentation’)
'ane signals contraexpectation (from 'ane ‘to be different’)
pain signals subordination and (?) distant past (from pain ‘third person neuter preposition’)
ma' has three alternate forms that are derived by means of the third person singular object suffix verbal inflectional morphemes: -on ‘masculine’, -m ‘feminine’, and -in ‘neuter’. Mon, mam and main also signal interrogation.
cain' signals interrogation. It is derived from cain ‘that neuter distal’. If we are correct in our analysis of this form, as deriving from cain, the glottal is added, meaning that this is not simply zero-derivation. See 2.2.6, where we describe verbs derived from nominals by this same process.
See 1.1.1.4.2, where we discuss operator words and their function in COMP sentences.

2.2.3. Compounding

2.2.3.1. Verbs
Compounding is easily the most productive process for deriving subtypes of verbs. Here we want to discuss the headedness of compounds, the causal-temporal-modificational organizing principles of compounds, and offer arguments that cases we are analysing as compounds cannot be analysed instead as incorporation of serial verbs. We should note at the outset that we do not write compounds as single words, following instead the practical orthography of the language, which separates each member of the compound.

2.2.3.1.1. Compound-internal organization and headedness

We have observed up to five elements in a compound verb form (731f):

(731) a.

Note that the first member of the compound is the semantic core. Other members of the compound either express result/effect of the action of the verb to their immediate left or restrict the meaning (i.e. modify) of that verbal element. Consider, for example (732):

(732) a. Juc wao

roron. ra-ocon

‘Sing until they come.’ (lit. ‘Sing-come them.’)

These lead us to conclude that compounds are left-headed and left-branching:

2.2.3.1.2. Alternative analyses

2.2.3.1.2.1. Serial vs compounding One plausible alternative to our compounding analysis would be to treat these as serial verbs rather than compound verbs. However, this analysis does not seem to be what is wanted here for semantic, syntactic and phonological reasons. Semantically, serial verb constructions should maintain the basic translation of each verb in the string, rarely ‘adding’ them together at the end. This indeed does seem to work for examples like (733):

(733) Juc wao

ron

coxa'

ma.

ra-on

co-xa'

push swing 2s:rf-3sm

INFL:m/frp/p younger:brother

2s

‘Swing your little brother.’

You push your little brother and you (by pushing) swing him. But now notice the problem if we add the verb pi'am ‘sleep’ to this.

(734) Juc wao

pi'am ron ra-on

coxa' co-xa'

push swing sleep 2s:rf-3sm INFL:m/frp/p younger:brother

Wari' 372

ma. 2s ‘Swing your little brother to sleep.’

There is a clear causative meaning to the verb pi'am (and arguably to wao ‘swing’ as well) in (734). If these were merely serial verbs, one might expect them all to ‘unify’ (à la Baker 1988), where they all shared the same subject. But in its nonserial/noncompound use, sleep could only have as its subject coxa' ma ‘your little brother’, not ‘you’ as it does here. Consider too the case of an intransitive verb compounded with/followed by a transitive verb:

(735)

Com

taxipa'

nana

hwijima'.

sing

befriend

3p:rp/p

children

‘The children customarily sing.’

Taxipa' ‘befriend’ would otherwise be a transitive verb. Used following an intransitive verb, however, it never has this transitive meaning but only the modificational, aspectual meaning ‘customarily’. This type of semantic drift is typical of compounding, but not of incorporation. In the examples which follow, this type of semantic drift, or noncompositionality, is manifested in varying degrees.

na.

ca-in

do

travel

3sm-3n

3s:rp/p

‘Then he touched it.’

In example (736d), 'ac ‘travel’ is interpreted as a sequential aspect, rather than a separate verb ‘to travel’. This type of fact is compatible with either a compounding or suffixation analysis (where morphemes can function as verbs or aspectual suffixes depending on

Morphology 373

their position in the word), but not, it seems to us, with a simple serial verb structure. Other more extreme examples are:

(737) a. Tomi'

querec

te

napa'

pije'.

na-pa'

speak

see

father:1s

3s:rp/p-1p

child

‘The child is happy (lit. ‘speaks, sees and says “My father”) with me.’

(737) b.

Mi'

pin

na.

give

completely

3s:rp/p

‘He died (lit. gave completely).’

Xiram

napa'.

na-pa'

press:down

upon

3s:rp/p-1s

‘He feels sorry for (lit. presses down upon) me.’

Such semantic drift is expected under a compounding analysis, but not under a suffixation nor a serial verb analysis.
Phonologically, a string of independent words would receive stress on each word in the string. In the verbs above, however, this is not the case. Primary stress is placed only on the final verb of the string (with the verbs to the left receiving very light secondary stresses at most). If these form a single compound verb (or affixed verb), this is to be expected. It is harder to account for by a serial verb analysis. (At least it is less economical, since we need compounding already to handle semantically opaque cases like those in (737), and the ‘serial verb’ construction would be formally identical.)
Syntactically, the verbs in a serial verb construction should share the same subject. That is not the case here, however, if we merely take the literal meaning of each verb:

(738) Querec

querec

mao 'inon 'ina-on

cawiji

pane.

see

see

go:s 1s:rp/p-3sm

son:1s

rem:past

‘I saw my son off long ago.’ (lit. ‘I saw-went my son long ago.’)

This sentence can be uttered even when the speaker (the subject referenced on the VIC) does not go anywhere. It is the son that is doing the going in (738), not the speaker. At the same time, however, the speaker is not causing the son to go, so a simple causative analysis would miss the mark. A compound analysis can handle this by assuming that the second verb is the result or object of the first, forming a single complex event of seeing and going of which the subject is the ‘seer’ (because as leftmost verb, ‘see’ will be the head of the compound and thus determine the subject of the verb, while the subject of ‘go’, the son, will be the object of the compound verb). In other words, while this has the superficial form of a causative, it is in fact a new, compound verb. Consider the case of a plural object:

(739) Querec querec mama' 'inonon

'oro wari'

pane.

Wari' 374

'ina-ocon

see

see

go:p

1s:rp/p-3pm

coll person

‘I saw the people off long ago.’ (lit. ‘I saw-went the people long ago.’)

rem:past

Here the suppletive plural form of the verb ‘to go’, mama', is used. This follows if the construction in (739) is either a serial construction or a compound, since in the former case, 'oro wari' 'the people' is the subject of mama' ‘to go’, and in the latter case, it is the object of the entire verb compound, querec querec mama'. But the compound analysis is again preferred, since without it, we would have to allow for a sequence of verbs inflected as one, but with different subjects. We conclude, therefore, based on semantics, syntax and phonology that multiverbal complexes in 'ON are verb compounds and not serial verbs. Before concluding, however, we also want to argue that our compounding analysis is also superior to an incorporation analysis.
2.2.3.1.2.2. Incorporation vs compounding Some structures which we have analysed as zero-derivation plus compounding, might instead be analysed as incorporation. (We will ignore the possibility of verbal incorporation here, since this would be nearly equivalent to a serial verb analysis, already rejected.) Consider (740):

(740) a.

Wina

‘The waram monkey had a short tail (lit. played around at having a tail).’

However, we can safely reject this analysis, based on examples like (741):

In the above examples, there is no possible verb-external source for the incorporated N. It cannot be the object, since that position is filled. Nor could the incorporated N have plausibly originated as possessor of the object. Thus we reject incorporation as the source of the compound verbs in (740)–(741), analysing them instead by (i) zero-derivation of the ‘nominal’ part of the compound ([N]→[V[N]]), followed by (ii) compounding.
Yet another argument against incorporation comes from our earlier discussion of zeroderivation of verbs from nouns (see 2.2.2.1.2.2). The form of the noun which appears to the left of the VIC is not predictable from anything to the right of the VIC, i.e. cannot be predicted via movement into the verb from pre-existent deep structure. Moreover, the form of the noun which appears in the verb affects the translation of the compound or simple denominalized verbs in only roughly predictable ways, much more easily accounted for by compounding, whose semantics are often less than fully compositional, than by incorporation, which, at least by Baker’s (1988) account, would be expected to be fully compositional, with no semantic drift at all. We therefore reject incorporation as an analysis of the above verb forms.

2.2.3.2. Nouns

Compounding is not a productive process for nouns. Nouns zero-derived from compounded verbs may appear like compounded forms, but we analyse the compounding as a feature of the verb prior to nominalization, rather than as a property of the noun itself (see 2.2.3.1 for a discussion of verb compounding). There is one potential case of noun derivation via compounding, however: the formation of subgroup names by combining 'oro ‘collective’ and the noun. But even in these cases, it seems easiest just to analyse these as noun phrases which have been zero-derived to form nouns. The reason for this is that we have various cases of 'oro modifying nouns in examples above, e.g. 'oro hwijima' ‘all the children’, 'oro narima' ‘all the women’ and 'oro carawa ‘all the animals’. Subgroup names look just like such phrases formally (some clan names involve deverbalized nouns as well), except that they are interpreted as proper names. Consider the following:

(742) a.

'Oro Nao' ‘the Bats’

(742) b.

'Oro 'At ‘the Bones’

(742) c.

'Oro Mon ‘the Faeces’

(742) d.

'Oro Waram ‘the Waram Monkeys’

(742) e.

'Oro Waram Xijein ‘the Other Waram Monkeys’

(742) f.

'Oro Jowin ‘the Jowin Monkeys’

(742) g.

'Oro Win ‘the Win ?Palm Species’

(742) h.

'Oro Taracom ‘the Bamboos’

(742) i.

'Oro Mawin ‘the Urucũs’

(742) j.

'Oro Xina ‘the Suns’

Morphology 377

(742) k.

'Oro 'Eo ‘the Burpers’

(742) l.

'Oro Cao' Orowaji ‘the Eaters of Green Things’

(742) 'Oro 'Eo 'Ao Wao ‘the Burpers-Creepers (/Barkers/Criers)-Screamers’ (name given by m. Wari' to recently contacted Tupi group, speaking a dialect of Kawahib)

(742) 'Oro Caracat ‘the Social Law Breakers’ n.

(742) 'Oro Corom ‘the Enterers’ o.

(742) 'Oro Nene ‘the Whiners’ p.

People do not interpret expressions like 'Oro Nao' as ‘all the bats’, but as proper names. So we will analyse these as in (743):

(743)

[N [Np 'Oro Nao'] ] N

(Aside from the interpretation of such terms as proper names, we have no other evidence that these are in fact zero-derived nouns instead of NPS.) The only other potential cases of nominal compounding are the reduplicated cases in 2.2.4.2 as compounds. See that section for discussion.

2.2.4. Reduplication

2.2.4.1. Reduplication of verbs
Reduplication is very productive in 'ON. It ranges from monosyllabic and disyllabic reduplication to repetition of the entire verb.

2.2.4.1.1. Plural/intensive reduplication

Most plural, intense forms of verbs are derived from their singular forms by means of partial reduplication. This is accomplished either by simply reduplicating the cv of the stressed syllable once or twice (this process usually takes place with transitive verbs), or by reduplicating the cv of the stressed syllable with a cvrv pattern (this process usually takes place with intransitive verbs). There are also many singular and plural pairs of verbs formed by suppletion. Approximately one third are formed by suppletion, one third by simply reduplicating the cv of the stressed syllable, and one third by reduplicating with the cvrv pattern. Note (744e), where the plural, intense form is the base form for a form of yet greater intensity.

2.2.4.1.2. INFL and reduplication

INFL morphemes are often omitted when the verb is reduplicated. This could be either a morphological fact, that INFL and reduplication are in complementary distribution, but it seems more likely to have a semantic account, namely that with progressive aspect marked in reduplication, INFL is unnecessary. INFL is absent in each of the verbreduplicated clauses below, where it would have otherwise been expected.

We have several examples of iterative derived nouns, where the base is an onomatopoeic term. The base form represents the sound the object makes. We have described them here since, as in section 1.1.1.1, onomatopoeic forms are usually verb-like. Note that cucuruc in (747e) is only partially iterative.

Ergativity seems to be a factor in iterated verbs forming nouns. When the base form is a transitive verb, the derived form refers to its object (748a–b); when it is an intransitive

Morphology 381

verb, it refers to its subject (748c–d). The example in (748b) could possibly be derived from the onomatopoeic formative 'ein, the sound this particular frog species makes.

2.2.5. -derivation

A few cases of verbs derived from nominals (and one derived from a demonstrative) involve the addition of a glottal (or globalized nasal as in (749a)) to the end of the noun to derive the verb. No other phonological changes are observed.

In (750) the verb cawain' ‘to dry’ seems to be derived from the -xi' noun cawaxi' ‘dry season’. Although we have no record of cawaxi' occurring in an inflected form, cawain would be its third person neuter inflection.

2.2.6. Derivation from verbal inflectional clitics
There are two kinship terms and one verb which might have been derived from verbal inflectional clitics, although this is still a bit speculative. It seems that the noun na' ‘my mother’ could be derived from the third person realis past/present VIC na; the noun nem ‘my brother-in-law’ could be derived from the realis past/present VIC na ‘third person singular’ with the second person singular object, nem ‘third person singular to second person singular’ respectively; and the verb nam'/nanam' ‘to be pregnant’ could be derived from the third person singular and/or plural VICS, na and nana, with third person singular and/or plural objects, -m and vcvm. In the case of na' and nam'/nanam', it could be said that they are derived by the addition of a glottal, as discussed in 2.2.5. In the case of nem, it could be said that it is derived via zero-derivation.
Not only are these terms identical to their basic forms, but the first person plural forms of na' ‘my mother’, xi' ‘our (inclusive) mother’ and xut ‘our (exclusive) mother’, are exactly identical to the forms of the first person plural realis future VICS. On the other hand, this similarity breaks down in the second and third person inflections of na' ‘my mother’, where the kinship term follows the pattern of regular -xi' nouns: jim ‘your (s) mother’, jicon ‘his mother’, jicam ‘her mother’, jinain ‘its mother’, juhu' ‘your (p) mother’, jicocon ‘their (m) mother’, and jicacam ‘their (f) mother’. Nem ‘my brother-inlaw’ inflects for possession like co- kinship terms: conem ma ‘your (s) brother-in-law’, conem ca ‘his brother-in-law’, etc.
The literal meanings of the VICS would lead culturally and etymologically quite naturally to the kinship terms, since these derived forms reflect two of the most important aspects of the basic social structure of this matriarchal society: that of mother and sister. ‘Mother’ might reasonably be thought of simply as one who is, who exists: ego needs no special term (noun or verb) to refer to her; she just is, hence the simple use of the third person singular realis past/present VIC, na ‘he or she (is)’. In like manner, male ego’s sister is his most honoured and important kin, and he needs no special term to refer to her

Morphology 383

husband. He simply uses the third person singular to second person singular VIC, nem ‘he to you (s)’. As for the verb nam'/nanam' ‘to be pregnant’, the origins (‘he to her’ and ‘them to them feminine’) are also clear.

Many words, especially monosyllabic words, begin with a glottal plosiveconsonant sequence, involving plosives, affricates and nasals. In these words, the glottal plosiveconsonant sequence fluctuates with the single consonant of the respective sequences, and

we analyse the sequence as an allophone variant of the relevant c. In addition, a glottal plosive always precedes word-initial semivowels, even in polysyllabic words.
There seems to be some correlation between words beginning with a glottal-consonant sequence in the 'Oro Nao' dialect and words that, in other dialects ('Oro Waram, 'Oro

Mon, 'Oro Waram Xijein, 'Oro 'At) begin with : com

‘water’, te

Wari' 388

In some idiolects, especially of children, word-final glottal plosives, glottalized nasals, and glottal-consonant sequences are not pronounced at all. Adults’ pronunciation is variable. Adults and children always pronounce word-initial glottal plosives preceding vowels at the beginning of a word and usually intervocalically within words (although glottal stop is sometimes replaced by length on the preceding vowel or following consonant). Adults are fairly consistent in pronouncing word final glottal plosives and glottalized nasals.

3.1.2.2.2. Nasalized vowels

Nasalization of vowels occurs only on surface diphthongs. In fact, there are only a few diphthongs which are not nasalized. The exceptions to nasalization of diphthongs are a few examples of plain diphthongs ending with /i/ [I]. They occur in seemingly open, stressed syllables (see examples in (797) and (799) below), and the voiced nonsyllabic [i] becomes the voiceless [I]. Alternatively, it is possible that the nonsyllabic [i] is actually

an allophone of

. Although this analysis would eliminate an anomaly, allowing us

to say that all diphthongs are nasalized, it would be the only instance of

occurring

syllable-finally. It would, however, be no less a rarity than plain diphthongs. This

admittedly needs further study. (1) [ẽĩ] ‘ei’ [ẽĩ] diphthong of mid open front unrounded nasalized vowel followed by voiced high

close front unrounded vowel. Although [ẽĩ] is always followed by /n/ or

in the

accepted orthography, it is always pronounced as an open syllable or one closed by a

glottal plosive. It always occurs in the stressed syllable of the word. We have no record of the plain diphthong, [ei], occurring in an open syllable (see other diphthongs ending in

[i]), but it may exist.

3.1.2.3. Borrowings None of the above segments occur only in borrowed words.
3.1.2.4. Restrictions in word classes The segments described above occur in all word classes. In addition to the above segments, there are a number of sounds used only in onomatopoeia, which violate normal phonotactic and segmental phonological constraints.

3.2. PHONOTACTICS

3.2.1. Distribution of single consonants

3.2.1.1. Word-final consonants

The following consonants occur word finally: /p/, /t/, /k/, , /m/,

/n/, and

. Neither /kw/ nor any of the affricates, fricatives, liquids, or semivowels occur word finally, though see the discussion in 3.1.2.2.2, where we suggest the possibility of

occurring word finally. See 3.1.2.1 for examples.

3.2.1.2. Word-initial consonants

All consonants but the globalized nasals (

and

) occur word-initially.

However /ſ/ occurs word-initially only in verbal inflectional clitics, which never occur

isolated in an utterance. They are always utterance-medial, so one might conclude that /ſ/

never occurs utterance-initially. See 3.1.2.1.4 for examples.

3.2.2. Distribution of consonant clusters

3.2.2.1. Word-initial consonant clusters
There are no word-initial consonant clusters in the language, though see the paragraphs following (770), where we discuss sequences of glottal plosive with other consonants that occur word-initially.

Phonology 399

3.2.2.2. Word-final consonant clusters
There are no word-final consonant clusters in the language, though see 3.1.2.1.3, where we discuss the sequences of nasal followed by glottal word-finally.

3.2.2.3. Word-medial consonant clusters

Word-medial consonant clusters in noncompounds are rare, /n/ is the only consonant we

have found occurring as the first element, and /t/, /k/ and

have been found as the

second element of a cluster. Syllable division is marked by a period.

(805) b.

Conco' na. (con.co') ‘He has dysentery.’

(805) c.

panxica (pan.xi.ca) ‘his son’

3.2.3. Distribution of vowels

3.2.3.1. Word-final vowels All vowels occur word-finally.

3.2.3.2. Word-initial vowels No vowels occur word-initially.

3.2.3.3. Sequences of (syllabic) vowels
There are no sequences of syllabic vowels in the language in mono-morphemic words. Vowel sequences are realized as surface diphthongs.

3.2.4. Differences between structure of lexical morphemes and words

While /ſ/ never occurs word-initially in regular words, it does occur initially in verbal inflectional clitics. In these cases, however, it is still utterance-medial—see 3.2.1.2.
While the minimal construction of words is either cv or cvc, there are a few lexical morphemes in the form of suffixes that have a vc, vcvc, or simply c construction. Vowel harmony, or the formation of a diphthong reduces the resulting combinations, however, to a normal cvc pattern. A few examples:

3.2.5. Syllabification
3.2.5.1. Assignment of medial units and clusters to syllables The most common medial units are single vowels and single consonants. The vowel is always assigned to the syllable in which it occurs, and the consonant following it is always assigned to the following syllable. In the rare instances where word-medial consonant clusters occur, the first consonant is assigned to the preceding syllable and the second consonant is assigned to the following syllable—see 3.2.2.1.3 where we discuss the occurrence of word-medial consonant clusters.
3.2.5.2. Canonical syllable type The canonical syllable type is cv(c).

Phonology 401

3.2.6. Sequences of segments

3.2.6.1. Consonant-vowel sequences

/kw/ and /hw/ are never followed by /o/, /Y/, or /ö/.

and

are never followed

by any of the vowels. We do not have examples of every diphthong following every

consonant, but we are certain they would not follow

and

, since these

phonemes only occur word-finally. Otherwise we see no phonological reason why every

diphthong could not follow every other consonant.

3.2.6.2. Vowel-consonant sequences

Only plosives and nasals may occur word- or syllable-finally. These may be preceded by any of the simple vowels. Diphthongs ending with /o/ may only be followed by the glottal

plosive; diphthongs ending with /i/ may only be followed by /n/ or

.

3.2.6.3. Restrictions of co-occurrence of segments
The only restrictions between syllable-initial units and syllable-final units or nextsyllable-initial units is that neither /h/ nor /hw/ is preceded by the glottal plosive.

3.2.6.4. Vowel harmony
Different vowels in successive syllables of the same word are common, but the incidence of identical vowels in successive syllables of the same word where /ſ/ is the medial consonant is so high that we believe it warrants mentioning here. Two texts were examined: one with 257 lines, the other with 218 lines, looking for different words containing /ſ/. There were 57 such words in the larger text; 38 in the smaller. Exactly 73.7 per cent of these words in both texts contained identical vowels preceding and following /ſ/, while 26.3 per cent of the words had different vowels. Admittedly, some of these words were the result of partial reduplication (see 3.4.7 below), but the majority had undergone no morphological processes to attain their phonological structure. A few examples: xuruxut ‘walk (p)’, wereme ‘breathe’, taracop ‘corndrink’, 'orowaji ‘its greenness’, piri’ ‘rise’, horop ‘bark species’, miri'om ‘ignore’, cucuruc ‘parakeet’, cotere’ ‘our (incl) father’, caramaxicocon ‘their things’; xirao' ‘write’, tora' ‘choose’, narima' ‘woman’, mirop ‘monkey species’, 'awori ‘ready’.
Regressive assimilation within words (not across morpheme boundaries) occurs when /e/ precedes a nasal or a plosive other than glottal plosive in a stressed syllable, by causing the /e/s in preceding contiguous syllables to take on its phonetic characteristics. This can ‘travel’ up to two syllables away (in our data), as in hwerehwet ‘appear’, where /e/ before the plosive is pronounced as open [ε] and causes the normally closed /e/s of hwere to be pronounced as [hwεrε]: [hwεrε'hwt]. Other examples: hexec [hε'tsεk] ‘to dawn’, perepec [pεrε'pεk] ‘to glisten with oil’, and querec [kε'rεk] ‘to see’. Similarly, in menem ‘your (s) possession’, /e/ before the nasal is pronounced as open [I], and it causes

Wari' 402

the normally closed /e/ of me to be pronounced as [mI]: [mI'nIm]. Other examples:

comerem

‘thunder’ and teteren

‘numb’.

Vowel harmony operates from right-to-left within the word as follows: /Y/ causes /e/,

/i/ and /o/ to change to /Y/. Note the order of application of vowel harmony and

coalescence in (807d–e): the final vowel of the stem first coalesces with /Y/, and then

Harmony proceeds, changing the /i/ and /o/ in the stem to /Y/. For Harmony to spread, all

vowels must be the same height, see (807c).

Progressive assimilation occurs when /e/ causes /a/ and /i/ to change to /e/ (807a–c) and /o/ to change to /Y/ (807d–e). Note the order of assimilation in the latter: the assimilation of /o/ to /Y/, which then causes the /e/s of the stem to change to /Y/ in regressive assimilation.

Dissimilation (vowel disharmony/dissonance) occurs when successive syllables of a word

contain /i/. The last /i/ causes the preceding /i/s in the word to be pronounced as . When pronounced slowly and clearly, all the /i/s are pronounced as [i].

3.2.6.5. Consonant harmony
See 3.4.1.1, where we discuss consonant harmony that occurs across morpheme boundaries.
Another process which might be considered consonant harmony is where identical syllables in a word are reduced to a lengthened consonant. This is just a fluctuation.

3.2.6.6. Restrictions between adjacent or nonadjacent units or clusters

There are no more restrictions between adjacent or nonadjacent units or clusters, other

than those already described.

or

‘our (incl) hair’

3.2.6.7. Differences between phonotactic patterns with different word classes
Many ideophones employ sounds that are used nowhere else in the language. We have not included any of these variations from the normal phonology of the language in this study.
Portuguese loan words are assimilated into 'ON phonology. For example, Portuguese
/s/ and /z/ are realized as 'ON or one of its allophones; Portuguese /f/ and /v/ are realized as 'ON [w], [h] or [hw], but we have found no rule to predict exactly which of these forms will be adopted. Portuguese /!/ is realized as 'ON [ſ]; and all voiced plosives are realized as voiceless plosives. When speaking Portuguese, Wari' people tend to have difficulty distinguishing between Portuguese voiced vs voiceless plosives. They also find it difficult to distinguish Portuguese /m/ from Portuguese /b/ and Portuguese /n/ from Portuguese /d/.
With regard to effects on suprasegmental features of loan words, it is interesting to note that, in spite of the fact that all 'ON words are oxytones, Portuguese oxytones are stressed as paroxytones when borrowed into 'ON, while Portuguese paroxytones are stressed as oxytones, or their last unstressed syllable is dropped. For example, biribá ‘a fruit species’ is pronounced [mbI'rima]; and cobertor ‘blanket’ (ultimate stress) is

Wari' 404

pronounced [ko'mbeto]; leite ‘milk’ is pronounced

remédio ‘medicine’ is

pronounced [he'me]; canoa ‘canoe’ (penultimate stress) is pronounced [ka'no]; and

cachorro ‘dog’, is pronounced

.

Within the sentence, the final syllables of major lexical categories are stressed. Primary
stress in the sentence normally falls on the final syllable of the verb, with final-syllable
stress on other lexical categories interpreted as secondary stress. Other morphemes, e.g.
verbal inflectional clitics and inflected forms of the preposition, carry tertiary (or even
quartiary) stress, depending on the presence of other constituents in the sentence. In the
examples below, the different degrees of stress are marked by a superscript number before the stressed syllable: 1is primary stress, 2 is secondary stress, 3is tertiary stress, and 4is quartiary stress.

In addition to contrasting levels of stress between constituents, verb compounds of two or more verb stems also have two levels of stress. The rightmost member of the compound carries primary stress, while the preceding members carry secondary stress.

In accordance with the rule of oxytonic primary stress in verbs, derived predicates in verbalized sentences also receive primary stress on the last syllable—see 1.1.1.4.3.

See 3.3.2.1.

3.3.2.3. Levels of stress

3.3.2.4. Position of stress

Stress falls on the last syllable of the word, except when that syllable is a stress-avoiding member of a verbal compound, in which case stress will go on the syllable to its immediate left.

3.3.3. Pitch There is no distinctive use of pitch in the language.

Phonology 407

3.3.4. Intonation

3.3.4.1–2. Normal intonation patterns

There is only one basic intonation pattern in the language: rising pitch through the verb, reaching high on the last syllable of the verb, and falling sharply on the next syllable or postverbal modifier that does not carry stress); it then holds through any optional arguments until the end of the sentence, or until a demonstrative or sentence-final particle, in which case it rises on the last syllable of the argument preceding the demonstrative or particle and falls sharply on the demonstrative or particle. In normal speech, the second high pitch is lower than the first high pitch. Interrogative and declarative intonation patterns are basically the same, differing only in the fact that the peaks of intonation are higher in interrogatives than in declaratives (816d–f).

3.3.4.3. Contrastive and emphatic intonation In contrast to normal speech, where the higher pitch of intonation falls on the verb, the higher pitch of intonation is transferred to the emphasized constituent when a constituent other than the verb is emphasized.

3.4. MORPHOPHONOLOGY (SEGMENTAL)

3.4.1. Articulatory alterations

3.4.1.1. Assimilatory processes
All three types of assimilation occur: regressive (see also 3.2.6.4), progressive, and coalescent (see 3.4.3, where we discuss coalescence). Most assimilatory processes occur across word-internal morpheme boundaries.

3.4.1.1.1. Regressive assimilation

Regressive assimilation across morpheme boundaries involving consonants (though see 3.4.3 below) takes place when -xi' nouns whose stems end with ji inflect for third person
masculine or feminine. The /k/ of the suffix causes the /y/ of the stem to change to /ts/.
See also 3.2.6.4 above.

‘her strangeness’

Regressive assimilation of vowels is discussed in 3.2.6.4 above.

Phonology 409

3.4.1.1.2. Progressive assimilation

Progressive assimilation occurs across morpheme boundaries between a nasal consonant or nasalized diphthong and a voiceless stop. This assimilation is optional and is most common in normal speech. In fact, we have no examples of this in careful speech.

3.4.1.2. Dissimilatory processes
There are no dissimilatory processes across morpheme boundaries. See 3.2.6.4, where we discuss dissimilation within the word other than across morpheme boundaries.

3.4.1.3. Alternations between segments

There are a few alternative forms of the singular and third person plural possessive

suffixes on -xi' nouns. These can be best seen in Table 3.1. Examples are found in 3.4.1.1.

There are three variants of the first person plural inclusive Tense active

that

function with co- kinship terms: -ri' occurs with verbs ending with the sequences

and ; -re' occurs with verbs ending with /e/; and 'iri' occurs with all other verbs. 'Iri' occurs as a free morpheme, while -ri' and -re' are suffixes.

vowel-glottal-plosive sequence; 'urut occurs with all other morphemes. As with -ri', -re'

and 'iri' above, -rut is a suffix, and 'urut is a free morpheme.

3.4.3. Coalescence and split

Vowel coalescence takes a sequence of two vowels and returns a single vowel as output, according to the following principles: (1) if one of the two relevant vowels is marked [+back], the output vowel will be [+back]; (2) if the two vowels differ as to height, the output vowel will have the height of the highest vowel of the input sequence; (3) if the vowels are identical (the only actual case of identical input vowels in the corpus is /i/+/i/), then a single, identical vowel is outputted. This process is reminiscent of vowel coalescence in some dialects of Modern Greek.

3.4.4. Asyllabification

Asyllabification occurs when the INFL morpheme co occurs with 'aji' ‘my older brother’

in a co- kinship term: the prefix co- [ko] coalesces with the first syllable of

to

form [kwa]: cwaji' ca

‘his older brother’. This phenomenon also occurs

in third person inflections of -xi' nouns ending with /o/ when /k/ is in the last syllable of

the stem or first syllable of the suffix. Note the occurrence of asyllabification in the

examples below.

(836) a.

toco-

+ -i

= tocoi [to'kwi]

(836) b.

eye toco-

-3n + -cam

‘its eye’ = tocwam [to'kwam]

eye mono-

-3sf + -camcam

‘her eye’ = monococwam [monoko'kwam]

belly

-3sf

‘their bellies’

3.4.5. Deletion processes

Glottal stop is deleted in kinship term formation, prior to asyllabification.

word-final /n/ or

Pain' 'iripain

toast 1pincl:rp/p-3sm

corn

‘We are toasting corn.’

Finally, there is a process of truncation which occurs in the -xi' noun tocoxi' ‘our (incl) eye’. When it inflects in the third person masculine and feminine, co is deleted: toco-+con=tocon ‘his eye’, not *tococon (although tococon is correct for ‘their (m) eyes’); toco+-cam=tocwam, not *tococwam (although tococwam is correct for ‘their (f) eyes’); toco+-cocon=tococon, not *tocococon; and toco-+-cacam=tococwam, not *tocococwam. This is not a result of the consonant reduction/harmony described in 3.2.6.5.

3.4.6 Insertion processes There are no insertion processes in the language.

3.4.7. Reduplication processes
Number (plural) is expressed by partial reduplication throughout the language. This is accomplished, with few exceptions, either by simply reduplicating the cv of the stressed syllable once or twice, or by reduplicating the cv of the stressed syllable via infixation of the bisyllabic sequence cvrv, in which c and the two v positions take their values from the

Phonology 415

onset and nucleus of the reduplicated (stressed) syllable. These two patterns are found in

(1) verbs: cat/caracat ‘break’, toc/tototoc ‘drink’, wixicao'/wixicaracao' ‘throw’; (2)

verbal modifiers: 'i/'iri ‘already, mon/ momon ‘slowly’; (3) inflectional clitics: na/nana

‘third person realis past/ present

, nucun/nucucun ‘third person possessive

',

(exception: tara/tatara ‘third person realis future VIC’); (4) demonstrative pronouns: cam

cwa' /caram cwa' ‘third person feminine’; and (5) suffixation on xi-nouns:

winacon/winacocon ‘his/their head’.

Reduplication or repetition of the entire verb is a way of expressing the continuous,

progressive, and iterative aspects—see 2.1.3.3.2.4–5 and 2.1.3.3.2.8.

Total reduplication occurs in derived nouns—see 2.2.1.

3.5. MORPHOPHONOLOGY (SUPRASEGMENTAL)
Stress always occurs on the last (rightmost) syllable of the (grammatical) word, even if that syllable is a suffix. Stress also falls on the last syllable of derived predicates in verbalized sentences, as our analysis of these as single verbs predicts. In this sense, it could be said that stress is constant under morphological processes.

Chapter 4 Ideophones and Interjections

4.1. IDEOPHONES

We understand ideophones to be words which are partially onomatopoeic, may involve reduplication, and (unlike merely onomatopoeic words) respect the general phonological patterns of the language. Many verbs and nouns, especially names of animals, birds, fish and some objects, are ideophones. In the case of verbs, they represent the sound produced when the action takes place; in the case of nouns, they represent the sound the animal, bird, fish, or object makes. These ideophones are treated formally like other nouns and verbs. They may head NPS/VPS like any other noun or verb, being accompanied by inflectional clitics, demonstratives and collective particles where applicable (the preceding material is full of examples). In addition, many verbal ideophones undergo regular reduplication processes to form plural, intense verbs.
The (incomplete) list of verbal and nominal ideophones below was taken from the 'ON dictionary:

5.1. STRUCTURED SEMANTIC FIELDS

5.1.1. Kinship terminology

Kinship terms are obligatorily possessed (although the first person singular possession suffix of co- terms is covert). While the first person singular inflection of all kinship terms is used in vocatives, the term of endearment, 'arain ‘lit. its bone’, is preferred when addressing anyone whom ego calls ‘child’, ‘son’, or ‘daughter’. The first person singular inflection of kinship terms appears as a derived verb, as shown below. See 2.2.2.1, where we describe the first person singular inflections of nouns functioning as derived verbs.

(841) Pa' a.

mam? ma -m

maternal:grandmother:1s

2s:rp/p-3sf

‘Is she your grandmother?’ (‘Do you “grandmother” her?’ (lit. ‘(…say) “my grandmother” to her?’)

(841) b. Te

non

Xijam

'Orowao'.

na -on

father:1s

3s:rp/p-3sm

m:name

m:name

‘Xijam is ‘Orowao'’s father.’ (‘'Orowao' “father’s” (lit. (says) “my father” to) Xijam.’)

When talking about a relative, ego uses the first person singular inflection of the kinship term. When two or more people talk about a person with whom they are related in the same way, the first person plural inclusive inflection of the kinship term is used. This includes siblings (both brothers and sisters): when talking about one of the sister’s children, the term for female ego’s child (children) is used; when talking about one of the brother’s children, the term for male ego’s child is used. When two people talk about a mutual relative with whom they are not related in the same way, the term describing the closest relationship to one of them is used. A husband and wife always refer to their child (children) as pije' ‘child’ (hwijima' ‘children’) when talking to each other. In-laws also use pije' and hwijima' when speaking to their wife’s/husband’s relatives about their child.
Kinship terms belong to two word classes. The glosses of the terms listed below are only their basic meaning. These terms also include broader relationships, crossing generation levels—see the discussions and lists in 5.1.1.1–3.
(1) -xi' nouns

Lexicon 425

As with all -xi' nouns, the citation/base form for the paradigm is first person plural inclusive. The first person singular inflection of six of the terms is suppletive; otherwise they all inflect for possession like common -xi' nouns. The complete list of -xi' noun kinship terms is shown below. The first person singular inflection is shown in parentheses following each citation form. (Although we do not include ‘our (incl)’ in the gloss of each term, it is part of the full translation of each of these terms.)
'aramanaxi' ('aramana) sister (lit: female of the species) (male ego)

cainaxi' (caina)

daughter (female ego)

cawinaxi' (cawiji)

son (female ego)

humajixi' (humaju)

taramajixi' (taramaju) brother (lit: male of the species) (female ego)

taxixi' (taxi)

xerexi' (xere)

siblings

xinaxi' (wixi)

sister’s son (male ego)

xi' (na')

mother

Plural of -xi' kinship terms is expressed by a collective particle preceding any inflection of the noun. 'Oro is used with manaxi'; waram is used with all other -xi' kinship terms.

(842) a.

mana

‘my wife’ (lit. ‘my hole’)

(842b)

oro mana ‘my wives’

(843) a.

(843) b.

waram na' ‘my mothers’

(843) c.

waram jicocon ‘their mothers’

(2) co- kinship terms, derived from relative clauses

Wari' 426

The citation form of co- kinship terms is the first person singular form. See 2.2.2.2.1.5, where we describe the structure and inflection of co- kinship terms. The complete list of co- kinship terms is shown below. (Although we do not include ‘my’ in the gloss of each term, it is part of the full translation of these terms.)

Plural of co- kinship terms is expressed by the collective particle waram preceding the citation form (first person singular) and mana preceding all inflections of the term.

(844) a.

5.1.1.1–2. Sanguineal relationships
The purpose of this description is only to identify and define the kinship terminology, and not to analyse the kinship system in depth. However, a brief discussion of how the system works will help one to easily identify and define the terms. In the following guidelines, ‘actual generation level’ means the same genealogical rank or remove from a common ancestor; and ‘theoretical generation level’ means two or more actual generation levels that share kinship terms normally thought to be used on the same actual generation level.
In the kinship charts and discussions in 5.1.1.1–3, the following abbreviations are used: F ‘father’, M ‘mother’, B ‘brother’, Z ‘sister’, e ‘elder than ego’, y ‘younger than ego’, s ‘son’, D ‘daughter’, c ‘child’, H ‘husband’, and w ‘wife’.
Guidelines to be considered in order to identify and define the kinship terminology are as follows:
1 Any ego considers father’s brother the same as father (te) and mother’s sister the same as mother (na'); therefore parallel cousins are the same as siblings, and any child of one whom ego’s father calls brother, or ego’s mother calls sister, is a sibling ('aji' ‘elder brother’, we ‘elder sister’, xa' ‘younger sibling’, xere ‘siblings’).

Lexicon 427

2 The children of anyone whom male ego calls brother, or female ego calls sister, are ego’s children (panxita' ‘my child (male ego)’, cawiji ‘my son (female ego)’, caina ‘my daughter (female ego)’, humaju ‘my children (female ego)’).
3 A woman considers her brother ('aji'/xa') to be on the same theoretical generation level as her own children; therefore her children (ego) consider mother’s brother the same as elder brother ('aji', though see (4) below), and his children and grandchildren are ego’s children (panxita' ‘my child’, or panxica 'aji' ‘my elder brother’s child’) and grandchildren (wina ‘grandson’ and jina ‘granddaughter’) respectively. This principle also extends to the second ascending actual generation level: although mother’s mother’s brother is called jeo' ‘grandfather’, he is considered the same as ego’s brother (and thus on his same theoretical generation level); his children are considered ego’s children (panxita' ‘my child’, or panxica jeo' ‘my grandfather’s child’), and they call each other’s children’s children grandchildren.
4 Likewise, male ego considers his sister to be on a theoretical generation level above himself, proven by the fact that he considers her son (wixi) the same as his brother: their children are siblings, and they call each other’s children’s children grandchildren. The theoretical generation level breaks down, however, with male ego’s sister’s daughter (nowin): although she refers to him as ‘elder brother’, he calls her children grandchildren.
5 Any ego considers father’s sister the same as elder sister (we), and all of father’s sister’s direct line female descendants ad infinitum are the same as elder sister (we). This deviates from (2) above, where female ego’s sister’s children are also considered her own children.
6 As soon as father’s sister or any of her direct line female descendants (FZD, FZDD, FZDDD, etc.) has a son, he is considered the same as father (te) and occupies the same theoretical generation level as ego’s own father. The children of this “father” are ego’s siblings (and thus on his own theoretical generation level).
7 Anyone whom ego’s father calls father or mother, or ego’s mother calls father, is ego’s grandparent (jeo'); anyone whom ego’s mother calls mother, or ego’s father calls father’s sister (whether FZ, FZD, FZDD, FZDDD, etc.) is ego’s maternal grandmother pa').
8 Anyone whom ego’s child calls child is ego’s grandchild (wina, jina, wiji').

With this discussion as a background, we will now present each kinship term in order of descendency (first grandparents, then parents, siblings, children, and grandchildren). Although the Wari' people keep track of kinship up to the third theoretical ascending and descending generation, their reasoning and terms are the same as for the second theoretical ascending and descending generations, i.e. a parent of one whom ego calls grandparent is also grandparent, and a child of one whom ego calls grandchild is also grandchild, with one exception—while female ego’s ss and so is wiji, sss and SDS is wina and SSD and SDD is jina—see the footnote on (21) in the list of relationships that follows. The specific relationships listed below are exhaustive to the second actual ascending and descending generations.

1 Contrary to the general principle of mixed groups being marked for plural number by feminine

Wari' 432

person markers, references to two or more grandchildren (whether wina, jina, or wiji) of both sexes is made by the plural form of wina ‘grandson’: waram wina.

Persons identified by the same term can be contrasted by use of the following type of phrase:

(846) a.

we

con

te

elder:sister:1s

prep:3m

father:1s

‘my elder sister by means of my father’ (FZ )

(846) b.

cam

'aji'

cam

na'

elder:brother:1s

prep:3sf

mother:1s

‘my elder brother by means of my mother’ (MB)

Clarification is also sometimes made by use of the modifiers xucun ‘other of something masculine’, xequem ‘other of something feminine’, and 'iri' ‘truly’ preceding the kinship term (xucun te ‘my other father’, xequem na' ‘my other mother’, 'iri' xa' ‘my real brother’). We believe, however, that these clarifications are more for the benefit of outsiders. There is no need for this type of distinction within the Wari' society.
References to deceased relatives are usually made in the plural:

(847) Coromicat

tamana 'inonon

waram 'aji'.

'ina-ocon

think

much

1s:rp/p-3pm

coll

older:brother:1s

‘I am very sad about my older brother (lit: older brothers).’

Reference is also often made to any deceased relative, but particularly a deceased sibling, by 'oro jima' ‘dead ones’ followed by a nominal inflectional clitic marking posession:

(848) 'Ac 'i ma'

na

tata

‘It was like that, what our dead relative (lit: dead relatives) said long ago.’

5.1.1.3. Relationships by marriage
Distance relatives are marriageable. Reference is made to these persons as illustrated in (849). Anyone with whom one is hwaramu (kinship term) ‘chin related’ (evidently

Lexicon 433

reflecting the habit of pointing to a distant object with a motion of the chin) or mapam' (kinship term) ‘search related’ is eligible:

(849) a. Hwaramu

te

'inon.

hwarama-u

'ina-on

chin-1s

father:1s

1s:rp/p-3sm

‘He is my distant “father”.’ (lit. ‘I refer to him distantly as “my father”.’)

(849) b. Mapam'

te

'inon.

'ina -on

search

father:1s

1s:rp/p-3sm

‘He is my distant “father”.’ (lit. ‘I refer to him distantly as “my father”.’)

Some of the kinship terms for relationships by marriage are generally used only when there are no children present in the marriage. Once a child is born, compound terms in the form of possessed NPS are used to describe the relationship of the kin in consideration for the child or children of the marriage, for example, cote cacama humaju ‘my children’s father’ instead of taxi ‘my husband’. The person marker of the NP varies according to the sex and number of the child/children. In the following list, the citation form is listed first, and where it differs, the term for marriages where children are present is listed immediately under the citation form, with its gloss. Alternate forms assume that two or more children of both sexes are present in the marriage.

In addition, the following relationships are expressed only by possessed NPS. Again, the relationship for a childless marriage is listed first, and that for a marriage with children is listed immediately following it. Any other relationships by marriage, e.g. HBW, HZH, WZH or WBW, are usually identified by their sanguineal relationship, since in fact all the members of a given subgroup, and often across subgroup boundaries, are related in some way or another.
