Abstract Word order in South Conchucos Quechua
by Diane M. Hintz
This quantitative study of spoken language adds a piece to the word order puzzle for South American native languages, showing South Conchucos Quechua to have SV&OV word order and delineating the various pragmatic factors which motivate variation.
Word order in the Quechua language family has traditionally been described as SOV, though order in main clauses is quite variable. Quechua exhibits many of the correlates of the SOV type as observed by Greenberg 1966. However, if frequencies of the various word orders are considered, South Conchucos Quechua cannot be classified by Greenberg’s traditional six-way typology. In the few clauses with both a subject and an object, no order emerged as being significantly more frequent than any other order. Dryer’s four-way typology (1997a) did make it possible though, to determine “basic” word order for this language, consistent with his 2:1 frequency criterion.
Variation from the most frequent order is not arbitrary, but is motivated by discourse-pragmatic factors. Variant word order appears when the speaker is finishing what s/he wanted to say and is offering the floor to the listener for
v

commentary, when the speaker is focusing on a certain referent, when a new participant is being introduced, when something unfamiliar or contrary to expectation is being presented, or when the speaker is searching for a word. Additionally, very heavy arguments often appear after the verb.

1 Introduction 1.1 The South Conchucos Quechua language and its speakers
South Conchucos Quechua (SCQ) is spoken in central Peru by about 250,000 people. Specifically, the speakers live in the eastern part of the department of Ancash, between the Cordillera Blanca mountain range and the Marañón river, in the provinces of Huari, Antonio Raimondi, Asunción and San Luis, as well as in the district of Huacaybamba east of the Marañón River. Though some of the Quechua languages are endangered, this one is thriving. It is the language of everyday life for the people of this area. Most children are monolingual until they enter school, when they begin the process of learning Spanish.
In the early 60’s Parker 1963 and Torero 1964 both developed classification systems1 for the Quechua languages. South Conchucos Quechua is a member of the Quechua B language family, according to the classification by Parker, and of the Quechua I family according to the classification by Torero. All the Quechua B (or Quechua I) languages are spoken in central Peru. Quechua A (or Quechua II) is spoken in northern and southern Peru, as well as in Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia and
1 Landerman (1991:112) describes Parker’s study as the first attempt to provide a genetic classification of Quechua dialects, while the Torero classification is based on shared features. Landerman asserts (1991:265) that both Parker’s and Torero’s systems fail as genetic classifications, due to the fact that there is insufficient evidence based on shared innovations to demonstrate a binary classification system. Landerman developed his own four-way classification based on clusters of shared features within broad geographic areas. In his system, Central Quechua corresponds roughly to Quechua I and Quechua B, while Northern, North Peruvian, and Southern together correspond to Torero’s Quechua II and Parker’s Quechua A. The labels from all three classification systems are commonly used by Quechua linguists.

Argentina. Mapping of the exact areas where different varieties of Quechua are spoken is presented in Landerman 1991.
Linguistically and geographically, the nearest neighbors to South Conchucos Quechua are North Conchucos Quechua, spoken just to the north; Huamalíes Quechua, spoken just to the east; and Huáylas Quechua, spoken across the continental divide to the west. 1.2 Objectives of this study
Word order2 in the Quechua language family has traditionally been described as SOV.3 However, it has been noted4 that though Quechua languages are commonly called SOV languages, order in main clauses is quite variable. Both Weber 1989 and Fuqua 1992 show that only a small percentage of clauses actually exhibit SOV word order. Based on statistics presented in Weber (1989:16) on word order in Huallaga Quechua,5 Dryer (1997a:83) argues that Huallaga word order is better described as SV and OV.
2 I use the term “constituent order” interchangeably with “word order” in this thesis. Word order seems to be the more common term, but constituent order is more accurate for this thesis, because I am dealing with the order of the major constituents, S, A, O and V.
3 This follows the seminal work of Greenberg 1966 (1963), who proposed the six-way typology SOV, SVO, VSO, VOS, OVS and OSV. Among those reporting SOV word order for a particular Quechua language include Parker 1976:31, Adelaar 1977, Cole 1982, Cerrón-Palomino 1987:289, Fuqua 1992, Marsch 1993, Stewart 1987:8, Weber 1989:15, etc. I am not aware of any other basic word order reported for Quechua.
4 Payne 1993, Weber 1989, Fuqua 1992. 5 Huallaga Quechua is closely related to South Conchucos Quechua, but people from the two areas have considerable difficulty understanding each other.
2

In this study a quantitative analysis of spoken language is presented, showing SCQ word order to be also SV and OV.6 Both of these are “basic” according to Dryer’s 2:1 frequency criterion (1997a:74),7 with SV at 82% of all clauses with both an S and a V, while 70% of all clauses with an O and a V demonstrate OV word order. The claim that Dryer makes for Huallaga is thus also validated in South Conchucos.
South Conchucos does exhibit many of the correlates of the SOV type as observed by Greenberg 1966, such as postpositions and preposed genitives (possessors). However, counting by the traditional methodology was inconclusive in determining word order, as is shown in section 6.2. Counting by the traditional methodology was also inconclusive for Huallaga Quechua (Weber 1989).
Analysis shows that the instances of VS and VO are not arbitrary, but rather are conditioned by factors within the discourse. In a study on meaning and pragmatics of word order in South American Indian languages, Payne (1993:282) gives her impression that Quechuan, along with several other South American languages, is particularly sensitive to discourse-pragmatic factors. I found that this to be true for SCQ. This study seeks to answer the question she posed (1992:1) “When
6 An initial study on this topic was done in two papers by Diane Hintz and Dan Hintz, entitled “SV versus VS word order in South Conchucos Quechua” and “OV, VO and OVO in South Conchucos Quechua” respectively. Many insights from those unpublished manuscripts are included in this study. In the process of doing thorough counts and including more data, I modified and added to the initial conclusions reached in those papers.
7 If an order is at least twice as frequent as the order it contrasts with, it is considered as basic.
3

there are several possible order patterns in a language, what is the communicative function of one, rather than another, order?”
In addition to providing more pieces to the word order puzzle for South American languages, it is hoped that this study will also serve as a reference for those working in applied linguistics in Quechua languages. As educational materials are produced for the growing number of native Quechua readers, it is important to understand the discourse-pragmatic principles involved in word order so that the texts produced will be natural and completely understandable. 1.3 Organization of this work
Section two gives a brief review of the work of Greenberg and Dryer on word order typology, and then a review of the literature on word order in Quechua. Section three shows that SCQ does have the grammatical relations of subject and object, relations which are difficult to identify in some languages. Section four describes the data used for this study. About half of the material is conversation; the other half consists of stories as they were told to people. There is some interaction in the stories, but much less than in the conversation. Section five describes the methodology followed for coding the clauses and the NPs. As well, it provides examples of the categories of clauses and NPs coded.
Section six is the analysis section of this thesis. Section 6.2 provides counts according to the traditional six-way typology and also counts according to Dryer’s alternate typology. It is shown that if frequencies of the various word orders are considered, SCQ cannot be classified by Greenberg’s traditional six-way typology.
4

In the few clauses with both a subject and an object, no order emerges as being significantly more frequent than any other order. However, by counting according to Dryer’s typology it is possible to determine this variety of Quechua is to have SV&OV word order.
Section 6.3 deals with the clause types which have a strong tendency towards SV, OV and SOV order. Subordinate clauses, as well as reported speech with both an S and a V have a strong tendency to have non-variant word order.
Section 6.4 shows that infinitival complements show a stronger preference for OV word order than regular NPs and that conversely, other complements show a stronger preference for the variant VO order than regular NPs. Reasons are suggested for these preferences.
Section 6.5 gives the pragmatic motivations for the variant VS and VO orders, which include introducing a new participant, presenting a contrast, closing a segment of talk, presenting something unfamiliar to the listener or contrary to his expectation, searching for a word, and employing dialogic syntax. Very heavy NPs also motivate variant word order.
Section 6.6 gives a brief glimpse at intonation and other factors accompanying variant word order.

2 Background 2.1 Word order typologies
Greenberg 1966 postulated a six-way word order typology, with the most common types being VSO, SVO, and SOV. The other three: VOS, OSV, and OVS, in which the O precedes the S, he found to be rare8 (1966:76). In his 1966 report based on a sample of 30 languages, one of which was Quechua, Greenberg proposed 45 linguistic universals. As Dryer (1995:1050) noted, 28 of these universals refer to the order or position of grammatical elements, while the others deal with morphological characteristics. Many of the universals are implicational; they take the form, “given x in a particular language, we always find y” (1966:73). This typology was designed to help predict certain characteristics for a particular language, given that a certain word order characteristic is found in that language.
Dryer (1997a) proposes a four-way typology, which is based on two binary parameters, OV versus VO and SV versus VS. In this paper he argues against the traditional word order typology based on the six types, in favor of the four-way typology.
8 Though Greenberg found VOS to be rare, Dryer (1997a) supplies references on several VOS languages. In his first three arguments he deals with languages that are indeterminately VSO/VOS, the similarity of VSO and VOS languages, and the instability of VSO versus VOS (1997a:74-78), showing that VOS order does need to be taken into consideration.

2.2 Review of the literature on word order in Quechua To my knowledge, there have been no thorough studies of word order in
SCQ. After presenting some of the issues related to the word order puzzle in Conchucos Quechua, Stewart (1987:8) states that it is outside the scope of her dissertation to deal with those issues, and relates that this is an area ripe for research in Quechua languages.
Weber’s quantitative study (1989:15ff) demonstrated considerable freedom of word order in Huallaga Quechua, another member of the Quechua B language family. In relation to the properties Greenberg uses to characterize an SOV language, Weber mentions that the one Huallaga Quechua demonstrates least is that of SOV word order.
Fuqua’s study9 of word order in discourse of North Junín Quechua, also a member of the Quechua B language family, shows several factors to be important in explaining variation from SOV word order in that language. He finds word order variation at “pivotal junctures, at peak, at paragraph boundaries, and also in relation to participant reference operations of first mention, role reversal, and local thematicity” (1992:iv). Fuqua also finds foregrounding and backgrounding to play a part in word order. Additionally, he reports that action verbs not involving motion have SOV order and motion verbs have SVO order.
7

Marsch’s 1993 study on Presentative Movement in Margos Quechua, also from the Quechua B language family, shows that the NP follows the V when a new participant is introduced. She also finds that the NP may follow the V as an “afterthought”10 to help the listener distinguish who the speaker is referring to. Both of these findings are confirmed and developed in this study on SCQ.
3 Defining the constituents As illustrated in Andrews 1985, it can be difficult to identify subjects and objects in some languages, particularly if there is not evidence from case marking, from cross-referencing on the verb or from word order. Mithun 1992 and Dryer 1995 and 1997b suggest that a given language may not have exactly these grammatical relations. This raises the question of whether constituent order should be defined universally in terms of these categories. However, for SCQ there is strong evidence for the categories of subject and object. This language employs a nominative/accusative system, where subjects of both transitive and intransitive clauses are marked with nominative case (zero) and objects are marked with accusative case -ta.11 Similarly, verbs are marked to cross-
9 This present study employs a quantitative methodology, while Fuqua’s study is based on a discourse mapping methodology. I do not attempt to contrast and compare the two studies because different methodologies were used, different terms are used to describe the variation and the text genres studied are different. At least one of his findings is confirmed and expanded in the present study; namely, that the first mention of a participant motivates a variation in word order.
10 Previously, Chafe 1976 had discovered this in Seneca. He uses the term ‘antitopic’ to refer to the afterthought.
11 The O is usually marked with -ta. However, there are certain times when -ta does not occur with the O. Dan Hintz 2002b presents several examples of this along with thoughts on why -ta does not occur in those cases.
8

reference the person of the subject and the object.12 Hence, both NP coding and verb indexing demonstrate that South Conchucos has a nominative/accusative system.
In this thesis, S and O refer to the grammatical relations subject and object, which are core arguments of verb V. This means that S is equivalent to the combination of S and A in the S-A-O framework.13
The following three examples show how the cross-referencing and case marking systems work in this language. In (1) below,14 ‘his dog’ is the subject and is zero marked for nominative case. It is cross-referenced on the verb with the third person suffix -n.
(1) S in an intransitive clause
S Allqu-n... kushi-sha puklla-yka-n dog-3POSS happy-PRT play-PROG-3 ‘His dog is playing happily.’ [FR, 1025]
In (2), the first person independent pronoun is the subject of the transitive clause, zero marked for nominative case. The object, ‘worm’, is marked with -ta, the accusative case. The first person subject is cross-referenced on the verb. Third person objects are not overtly cross-referenced.
(2) S and O in a transitive clause
12 There are some exceptions to this. Third person objects do not have overt cross-reference markers on the verb. Additionally, second person objects do not have overt cross-reference markers on the verb when the subject is first person and the tense is non-future.
13 I did code separately for subjects of intransitive clauses and subjects of transitive clauses, but the word order statistics came out very similarly, and so it was not necessary to present separate sets of statistics for the two kinds of subjects. 81% of the intransitive clauses have SV word order, while 82% of transitive clauses have SV word order.

In (3), ‘mother’ is the subject of the transitive clause, and is zero marked for

nominative case. The third person subject and the second person object are cross-

referenced on the verb with -shu-nki. The second person object is a recipient and semantically an indirect object.15 The direct object ‘those things’ is marked with the

accusative marker -ta. A compound verb is used here, the ‘habitual past’ tense.

14Refer as necessary to the abbreviation page at the end of this thesis for the glosses in the examples. Also, each example is identified by text and clause references, in brackets.
15 As Weber (1989:179) also documents for Huallaga Quechua, indirect and direct objects are not distinct syntactic categories in SCQ. Both trigger verbal agreement marking and both are case marked with the accusative -ta. However, as Weber also mentions (1989:180), if there is both an indirect object and a direct object in the clause, as in (3), the cross-referencing on the verb will be with the indirect object, indicating that there is some distinction between the two.
Weber suggests (1989:180) that “recipients” being treated as objects is a fairly recent innovation in Quechua B. In Quechua A they are treated as “goals” and marked with the case marker -man.

4 Data The data for this study were taken from transcriptions16 of recordings I made in Peru in 1992 and 2002. Approximately half of the data consist of a conversation lasting 21 minutes between a brother and sister in their late twenties, from the community of Huaripampa, in the district of San Marcos. They had not seen each other for a while and were “catching up” on current happenings. Conversation is an ideal source for a study of word order, because the order of constituents is not governed by grammar alone, but rather by the interaction of grammar and pragmatic conditions that arise in natural discourse. Stories, with some listener interaction, make up the other half of the data. Two stories told by a mother to her son at night are included. Both speakers are from the town of Huari. One of these stories is similar to the traditional Hansel and Gretel story. In this Andean version, the witch is called the “Achikay”. The other is a story about a gigantic worm, called “Lamunkuru”. Also included in the data studied were descriptions by two speakers of what was happening on the pages of a wordless, illustrated book entitled “Frog, where are you?” by Mercer Mayer. Both of the narrators were from the community of Yacya, in the district of Huari.
16 The transcription was done by Dan Hintz and Diane Hintz in conjunction with native language consultants. Anyone interested in having these transcriptions can write to Dan-Diane_Hintz@sil.org. The conversation text has been interlinearly glossed. At this writing, the stories have not been glossed, other than the examples found in this thesis.
11

Altogether, the stories last 20 minutes, 30 seconds, which is comparable in time to the 21 minute conversation. The total number of utterances coded was 1127. Utterances without any clear argument or verb were excluded from the count of clauses. Examples of utterances which were excluded are: Aw ‘yes’, Imallata: ‘what?’, A: kara:hu ‘oh good grief’, Waraynin qoyana ‘tomorrow morning’, and Pwestuman ‘to the police station’. Eliminating the utterances without any clear argument or verb left 998 clauses, 503 in the conversation and an almost equal number, 495, in the stories.
The number of clauses useful for this study was further reduced by the fact that in Quechua a high frequency of verbs stand alone. As noted above, verbs are obligatorily marked to cross-reference the person of the subject, as well as the person of the object. As long as the two speakers can keep the referents straight, NPs are not necessary. Of the clauses, 38% consist of a verb without any overt core arguments.17
Another 5% consist of an S alone.18 An additional 2% is composed of cases consisting of an O alone and cases where one part of the O or the S came before the
17 The example below of a clause consisting of a verb alone demonstrates how the person of subject and object are cross-referenced on the verb.
<<Hipi-yka-lla:-ma-y>> take.out-PROG-POL-1OBJ-2IMP ‘Get me out of here!’ [LA, 633]
Doris Payne (1986:440ff) finds that V-only is the most frequent word order in Yagua, a Peruvian Amazonian language. Like Quechua, this language also has a rich cross-referencing affix system.
18 For example, in the case of an S with a predicate nominal, if the copula is in the present tense, third person singular, and does not carry any additional morphology, it is not expressed, asample below.
12

V and one part came after it.19 These cases were not useful for the study. There are
545 clauses in the database containing a verb, at least one argument and no
disassociated arguments. Hence, the number of clauses useful for making word order
determinations was 545 of the 998 clauses, or 55%.
In the next section, the methodology, including a discussion of the coding
process, will be presented.
5 Methodology
5.1 Coding of clauses All the clauses were coded20 for a variety of features.21 Each clause was
coded for primary constituent order, using the labels S, O and V. Additionally, the
clauses were coded positively or negatively for six features: whether or not the
clause was a question, the answer to a question, had a negative element, was
Peru… kostumbri-m tse:. But custom-DIR that ‘But, that is the custom.’ [GR, 100]
The S may also appear without the verb in the case of a simple existential clause, as in the following example.
na:da ni huk ima-n-pis. nothing nor one what-3POSS-EVEN ‘There was nothing, not even one.’ [GR, 148]
19 There may be two parts of the object or two parts of the subject, which are separated by the verb. I use the terms ‘disassociated O’ and ‘disassociated S’ respectively, to refer to this phenomenon. This phenomenon happens most commonly with compound objects or subjects. However, it may also happen with two parts of a genitive construction. Additionally, one of the disassociated NPs may be an appositive of the other. See examples (23) and (24).
20 The Microsoft Access program was used to maintain the relational database. 21 Payne (1997:77ff) discusses several features known to be important in relation to constituent order. I coded for many of these features, as well as those which Dan Hintz and I found to be important in our initial studies. I also referred toTurk 2000 in choosing features to code for.
13

reported speech, contained reported speech, or involved a change in the topic of
conversation.22
The clauses were also coded for tense: present, future, simple past, recent
past, past perfect, narrative past, habitual past, conditional, or imperative. The
subordinate clauses do not generally carry tense markers and hence were almost
always coded ‘none’ for tense. In a study on variation in tense in Corongo Quechua
(Hintz 1996), I found different tenses being used in narrative for
conclusions/summary statements and conclusions of the “contrary to expectation”
type. Having noticed in the previous word order studies (Diane Hintz 2002 and Dan
Hintz 2002a) that concluding statements often correlated with variant word order,
I wanted to see whether there was also a correlation of certain tenses with the
concluding statements exhibiting variant word order.23
Additionally, the clauses were coded for clause type. Each clause was
identified as one of the following types: simple independent, independent following
22 In my initial study I hypothesized that the introduction of a new topic of conversation is a pragmatic factor motivating variant word order this language. However, I could not demonstrate that, for three reasons. First, each clause which was coded positively for “new topic of conversation” had at least one other accompanying motivation for variant word order. Frequently this was the introduction of a new participant. A second piece of evidence against a claim that the introduction of a new topic of conversation motivates variant word order is that 14/20, or 70%, of the clauses which were coded positively for “new topic of conversation” exhibited the standard SV, OV or SOV word order. A third drawback was that coding for “new topic of conversation” proved to be difficult, because the path of the conversation so gradually shifted from one issue to a related but different issue. The instances where there was a break from the previous topic of conversation and entrance into a totally new topic were rare in the conversation. In the stories, it was even more difficult. There is a progression of events as the story unfolds, and I did not see shifts of topic.
23 Roughly half of the concluding statements were in present tense. Most of the rest were divided between the narrative past, simple past and recent past. Tense variation in the conversation in this database is more complex than the tense variation I have seen in folktales. The reasons for tense variation are presented in Hintz 2003, and are not related to word order.

The clauses were subsequently coded for whether or not the clause was a

conclusion to or a summary of the previous talk; whether the speaker was intending

to communicate something unfamiliar or contrary to what the listener was

expecting; whether there was a contrast in focus, putting the focus on one entity as

opposed to another; and whether or not dialogic syntax was having an effect on word

order. Examples of each are provided in section 6.5 along with discussion.

5.2 Coding of NPs

In addition to coding clauses, each NP was coded for various properties known

to influence information flow, and hence possibly constituent order.

First, the NPs were coded for their referential form, whether lexical, proper

name, pronoun, nominalization, infinitive form of the verb, or several nouns in a

combination of referential forms.

Examples are given below of a nominalization and of an infinitive form of

the verb in context. Nominalizations often serve as object complements, as in (14).

They may also serve as subject complements, but these are rare and I do not have a

clear example in this database. Weber (1989:288) provides one for Huallaga

17

Quechua. Infinitive forms of the verb can also serve as subject and object

complements. See example (15), in which an infinitive serves as an object

complement.

here-DEF-LOC-NOW dog climb.up-INF-OBJ want-PROG-3

‘On this one (on this page) the dog is wanting to climb up.’ [FA, 932]

The NPs were also coded according to their activation state. Many factors come into play in determining activation state. Chafe 1976 and 1987 points out that each of the following can affect activation state: pauses, changes of scene, and the entrance of new participants supposedly pushing out old ones. For the sake of simplicity, I coded as follows. If the argument was completely new or had not been mentioned within thirty clauses, it was coded as “new”. If it had been mentioned within the three previous clauses, it was coded as “given”. If it was mentioned prior to the preceding three clauses, it was coded as “active”. The NPs were coded for whether or not they were mentioned subsequently (within thirty clauses).
The arguments were also coded as to whether or not they consisted of a list, or an otherwise heavy NP (made up of three or more words.) They were coded as to

18

whether or not there is obvious evidence that the speaker was searching for a word.26

For examples of heavy NPs see section 6.5.7, and for an example of a word search

see section 6.5.5.

Each NP was also coded for its role: whether it was the subject of an

intransitive clause, the subject of a transitive clause, an object, an oblique, a

predicate nominal, a participle, an appositive, a vocative, a disassociated O or a

disassociated S. Examples of the various roles are given below for clarification. In

(16), noqantsikpis is the subject of this intransitive independent clause.

26 The fact that a speaker is searching for a word is usually demonstrated by the use of na-, a root to which any substantive or verbal morphology may be attached. That root can be substituted for any noun or verb, when the word escapes the speaker. Dan Hintz (p.c.) has observed that when used as a verb, na:- has a lengthened vowel; when it is used as a noun it is short, though may appear to have length when a speaker is trying to come up with the word.
27 The line over the words of the O indicates that all these words are part of the O.

The bolded phrases in (23), below, are both Os. One appears before the V and one comes after it. Dan Hintz 2002a offers some possible reasons why these Os occur on opposite sides of the V. This is an area remaining for further study. There are nine instances of this phenomenon in the database, 8/9 of them occurring in conversation. The S can also have two parts which are separated by the V, as in (24). Other constructions, including genitives, obliques, and participles, can also be broken into two parts by the verb.

6 Findings 6.1 Overview
Section 6.2 is a quantitative presentation of the different constituent orders represented in the data according to two different typological frameworks: the traditional system developed by Greenberg, and that more recently proposed by Dryer. Comparisons are made and conclusions are drawn, giving support for Dryer’s alternate typology.
Section 6.3 presents the clause types which have a strong tendency towards SV, OV, and SOV order, giving specific counts.
Section 6.4 compares the behavior of nominalizations as object complements with the behavior of non-complement NPs, in relation to word order patterns.
Motivations for the contrastive VS and VO orders are presented in section 6.5. Though the data were coded for many factors and subsequent queries were run

22

on each factor, only the factors which were found to have an affect on constituent order are discussed in this thesis.
Section 6.6 presents other factors which may accompany variant word order, including certain intonation patterns. 6.2 Counts and comparison of typologies 6.2.1 Counts according to the traditional six-way typology
Counts were done using the six-way typology elaborated by Greenberg. However, only 66/998 clauses had both an independent subject and an independent object (6.6%). Eliminating the cases where there was a pronoun as the subject or the object, the percentage drops to 3.8%. Only 38/998 clauses had both a lexical subject and a lexical object.

Dryer (1997a) gives a number of arguments against the traditional word order typology. In one of these, he observes that clauses containing a noun subject and a noun object occur infrequently (1997a:78). For SCQ, as for many other languages, clauses containing both an NP subject and an NP object are so infrequent that an
23

analysis cannot be based on them.28 Nevertheless, a breakdown on the order of constituents for the 66 clauses is presented in Table 2.29

_____________________________________________________________

In addition to the problem of having very few clauses left to work with, there is another drawback to counting according to the six-way typology. The percentages for SOV and SVO are very close, at 35% and 32% respectively. The preference for S before V is evident, but the order of O and V cannot be determined from these statistics. In summary, counting according to the traditional six-way typology in order to determine frequencies does not give much aid in establishing SCQ word order.

28 Thompson and Hopper 2001 document the fact that transitivity is very low in English conversation. They note (2001:53) that the “clauses of high Transitivity that do occur seem to be used for reporting events in a highly non-subjective, in fact distancing, manner.” I noticed this tendency also in the Quechua data. When a speaker uses a clause with two NPs as arguments s/he is generally reporting something. Many of these clauses are reported speech; two are book titles, some are maxims, such as “Chihuahuas understand Spanish well.”
29 The rarity of clauses with two full lexical NPs suggests that they are pragmatically marked, which is another reason these kinds of clauses should not be considered as foundational to the determination of basic word order.
30 There was one instance each of SOVO, OSVO, OVOS, and OVSO. Disassociated Os are shown in (23) above.

24

6.2.2 Counts according to Dryer’s alternate typology Counts were then done according to the alternate four-way typology
proposed by Dryer (1997a), which is based on two binary parameters, OV versus VO and SV versus VS.
First, a count was done of all the clauses containing both an S and a V. There are 418 clauses which have either an NP or a pronoun as S. Of these clauses with subjects, in 341/ 418 cases (82%), the S came before the V. In 77/418 cases (18%), the S came after the V. Dryer treats a particular order as basic in a language if it is at least twice as frequent as the order or orders it contrasts with. In the subsequent discussion I refer to this as “Dryer’s 2:1 ratio criterion”. By basic I believe he means the most common order, the unmarked order, from which there may be variation due to certain pragmatic factors. Following Dryer, the fact that 82% of subjects appear before the verb provides strong evidence that SCQ is an SV language.
Secondly, all the clauses containing both an O and a V were counted. There are 193 clauses which have either an NP or a pronoun as O. In 135 of the 193 clauses (70%), the O came before the V. In 58/193 clauses (30%), the O came after the V. Following Dryer’s 2:1 ratio criterion, SCQ is eligible to be classified as OV, though not strongly so. The counts are summarized below.31
Table 3: Word Order in SCQ, Dryer’s typology _________________________________________________________
31 For all the counts of SV, VS, OV and VO in this thesis, the instances of disassociated S and disassociated O are not included, because they do not fall into either category.

6.2.3 Support for Dryer’s alternate typology

In his paper on the six-way word order typology, Dryer gives convincing

arguments for his claims, clearly illustrating the problems with the traditional system

and showing how the alternate typology he is proposing addresses those problems.

This study on word order in SCQ gives further validation to two of his arguments.

As discussed in section 6.2.1, one of his arguments deals with the fact that

the six-way typology is based on clauses containing a noun subject and a noun

object, but such clauses do not occur very often (1997a:78). In SCQ, as in many

other languages, clauses with an NP subject and an NP object occur infrequently.

Another of his arguments has to do with the fact that there are languages

which cannot be classified by the traditional typology and can only be classified by

the proposed typology (1997a:80). Table 2 and the accompanying discussion show

that like Hanis Coos (cited by Dryer), SCQ cannot be classified by the traditional

typology. However, by counting according to Dryer’s typology it was possible to determine that this variety of Quechua is an SV&OV language.32

32 Turk (2000:55), in a word order study on Russian conversation involving frequency counts, reports that clauses in conversation infrequently contain all three primary elements needed to determine order according to the Greenberg typology. As I found for SCQ, she found Dryer’s fourway typology to be a fruitful way to address the problem, allowing her to examine subject-predicate and object-predicate orderings separately.
26

6.2.4 Comparison of conversation and stories The word order patterns used in conversation were compared with those
employed in story telling. There is a slightly greater tendency to follow SV and OV order in conversation. SV is used in 83% of the clauses with both an S and a V in conversation and in 80% of the clauses with an S and a V in the stories. OV is used in 73% of the clauses with both and O and a V in the conversation, and in 69% of the clauses with both an O and a V in the stories. I do not take the small difference of 34 percent to be significant.

Table 4: Word orders used in conversation compared with those used in stories ________________________________________________________________

OV 64/93 69%

VO 29/106 27%

VO 29/93 31%

________________________________________________________________

It also should be taken into consideration that there are long stretches of narrative embedded in the conversation, particularly where an account of a lost donkey was given, with just a few comments or questions from the listener. By the same token, in the telling of the “Achikay” and “Lamunkuru” stories, there is embedded interaction as the listener asks questions and sometimes finishes the sentence for the story teller. Even the “frog” stories are not without feedback from

27

the listener. Hence, the conversation contains some segments of narrative and likewise, the narrative includes some interaction. 6.3 Clause types with a strong tendency for SV, OV, and SOV order
Some clause types have a stronger tendency towards SV than the 82% shown above, which is an average for all clause types, and as well, some clause types have a stronger tendency towards OV than the 70% shown above. The clause types exhibiting a greater than average frequency of the most typical word order for this language include: 1) reported speech containing both an S and a V, and 2) various types of subordinate clauses, particularly adverbial clauses. Examples and commentary are given below in relation to each of these. 6.3.1 Reported speech with both an S and a V
There were 35 instances of reported speech having both an S and a V. In 33 of those 35 cases, or 94%, the order was SV. This percentage is notably higher than the average 82% for all clauses with an S and a V. One example is below.

28

There were 23 instances of reported speech33 having both an O and a V. In 16/23 cases, or 70%, the order was OV. This is exactly the same as the average for all clauses with an O and a V. 6.3.2 Subordinate clauses
Subordinate clauses, particularly adverbial clauses, have a greater than average frequency of SV and OV word order. Weber (1989:17) also observes for Huallaga Quechua that “the tendency toward rigid SOV word order is much greater in subordinate clauses.” Additionally, Cole (1982:47) observes that in Imbabura Quechua, verb-final word order is strongly preferred in adverbial clauses.

6.3.2.1 Adverbial clauses

Of the adverbial clauses in the database which contain both an S and a V,

37/38, or 97%, exhibit SV word order. Of those which contain both an O and a V,

34/36, or 94% exhibit OV word order. It is also noteworthy that in all of the four

instances where there was both an S and an O, the word order was SOV. An example

of an adverbial clause is provided below.

33 Reported speech is almost always followed or preceded by an adverbial quotative nir (same subject) or niptin (different subject). Reported speech is generally embedded in these adverbial clauses. In a sense, then, we could think of the reported speech included in an adverbial clause as subordinate to the main clause. However, I have left reported speech as a separate category from subordinate clauses, because reported speech itself is usually composed of a finite clause with a main verb.

Purpose clauses

There are 26 purpose clauses in the database. Only 9 of those had an argument in addition to the verb. There were 2 with an S and a V34 and 7 with an O

and a V. Of those with both and O and a V, 6/7 or 86% were OV, which is higher

than the average 70% of OV word order in this language.

Relative clauses

In the example below, the relative clause is the O of the main clause and is

marked with the -ta object marker. The relative clause itself has SOV word order, as

does the main clause.

There were 7 relative clauses in the database and only one varied from SV and OV

word order. 86% exhibited SV and/or OV order, somewhat higher than the average.

6.3.3 “Unattached” clauses

Only 5/88, or 6%, of the dependent clauses (including adverbial clauses,

purpose clauses, and relative clauses) exhibited variant word order. Dependent

clauses exhibiting variant word order never come before a main clause in the data

studied; they are either “unattached” clauses or they are afterthoughts. It could be

argued that these types of clauses are not truly dependent when they are unattached

or when they occur as afterthoughts. They are much more separate than those in

close connection with a matrix clause. Evidently, speakers are free to vary the word

order in unattached clauses for pragmatic reasons, but word order may not vary in adverbial clauses, purpose clauses and relative clauses which are attached.35

35 Even when something new is presented in a dependent clause or something else is happening pragmatically in that clause, the order is always verb-final (excepting three cases of “unattached” clauses and two cases where the clause is an afterthought). Below is an example of an “unattached” clause. This one is a purpose clause, uttered without a main clause.

6.3.4 Discussion Why would subordinate clauses have a greater tendency towards SV and OV
word order? Bybee 2002, referencing work on several languages,36 reports that word
order changes in main clauses are not immediately duplicated in subordinate clauses. She supports the hypothesis that diachronic changes happen earlier in main clauses than in subordinate clauses, with the reasoning that main clauses are pragmatically richer.37 Thus main clauses are more subject to word order changes.
Bybee is specifically talking about word order change over a period of time. An interesting topic for further study would be to look at old Quechua texts from colonial times to determine whether or not word order in main clauses is presently freer than it was previously.
The data in this sample support Bybee’s statement that main clauses are pragmatically richer. 29% of the main clauses were coded positively for one or more of the pragmatic factors discussed in section 6.5, while roughly only half that percentage, 16%, of the subordinate clauses were coded positively for one or more of the factors.
36 She reports that there are good examples of this in Old English, German, and Kru. 37 She explains what she means by ‘pragmatically richer’ as follows, “…main clauses are pragmatically richer, containing the focused information and the possibility of setting off old from new information, while subordinate clauses tend to be pragmatically more even, replaying previously presented or supplementary material” (2002:14). See also Thompson 1984, Tomlin 1985, Givón 2001b, and Mithun 2002, who examine pragmatic differences between main and adverbial clauses in terms of the foreground/background dimension.
32

Section 6.3 has presented the types of clauses which follow SV and OV word order with greater frequency than 82% and 70% respectively, the percentages including all clause types. Reasoning has been given in an attempt to explain why these types of clauses have a strong tendency to follow SV and OV word order.
The following section discusses the preferences two types of object complements have for OV and VO word order. 6.4 Nominalizations as object complements
There are 20 instances of nominalizations serving as object complements in the database but no instances of subject complements. See (14), a nominalized verb serving as an object complement and (15), an infinitive, which is also a nominalization, serving as an object complement. In order to determine whether or not they follow the same word order patterns as other NPs, the object complements were separated out and their behavior was compared with the behavior of the noncomplement NPs.
The first column of Table 5 gives the statistics for non-complement NPs. The middle column shows that 1/7, or 14% of the object complements of the infinitive type have VO word order. In contrast, other nominalizations serving as object complements have a much greater tendency towards variant word order, with 6/8, or 75%, of the clauses exhibiting VO word order.

Why would there be such a large variance in behavior between infinitival complements and other nominalizations serving as object complements? I believe the infinitival complements are more tightly bound to the verb, and that they are actually part of the verb complex, though they are marked with the accusative case marker.
Another interesting possibility is that semantics may have something to do with the degree to which a complement is bound to the main verb. Givón (2001b:40f) writes that complement-taking verbs fall into three major classes:
• Modality verbs (‘want’, ‘begin’, ‘finish’, ‘try’ etc.) • Manipulation verbs (‘make’, ‘tell’, ‘order’, ‘ask’ etc.) • Perception-cognition-utterance (PCU) verbs (‘see’, ‘know’, ‘think’, ‘say’
etc.) He writes that the PCU verbs are bonded more weakly to their complements than are the other two kinds of verbs. My data support this statement. For instance, the main verb ‘want’, a modality verb, appeared 5 times with complements (all of which were infinitival complements) and each time the order was OV. This shows strong bondedness between the verb and the complement. Contrastively, the variant VO order was used with the instances of PCU verbs, including ‘see’, ‘know’, ‘think’, ‘say’, and ‘hear’, indicating that the complements may be less tightly bound to these verbs. All the PCU verbs appeared with complements other than the infinitival type.

34

Because there are so few instances of complements in the data, I cannot make a conclusive statement here, but can only suggest that PCU verbs may be less tightly bound to their complements than modality and manipulation verbs, thereby allowing these complements to more easily appear after the verb for pragmatic reasons. Each of the complements which appeared after the verb had a pragmatic motivation for variant word order.
Givón (2001a:250) also points out that “In many otherwise-rigid SOV languages, verbal complements, especially those of perception-cognition-utterance verbs, either optionally or obligatorily follow the verb, thus displaying VO order.” None of the complements of PCU verbs in the database appeared before the V, showing that VO order may be obligatory for this language when the object is a complement of a PCU verb. To determine this, a wider study of complements would need to be done, because there are insufficient numbers here to make a determination.
The next section presents pragmatic motivations for the contrastive VS and VO orders. 6.5 Pragmatic motivations for the contrastive VS and VO orders
When the core argument comes after the verb in the South Conchucos data, one or more of the following communicative functions can be observed, each of which is discussed below: 1) to introduce or re-introduce a new participant, 2) to specify or put emphasis on a certain referent, 3) to close a segment of talk, 4) to communicate something the listener does not expect or something outside the
35

understanding of the listener. Parallels can be drawn between these pragmatic factors and those discussed by Payne (1993:283-287). SCQ fits well into the typological pattern of pragmatic factors influencing word order which she describes for South American Indian languages.
The common thread for all these discourse motivations for variant word order is that there is something in particular the listener should notice about what is being said; something special is happening pragmatically. Either something new is being introduced, special attention is to be paid to one of the referents on stage as opposed to another, a summary statement of some type is being made, or something unusual is happening or being explained.
There are some additional reasons why the argument can appear after the verb in conversation. The speaker may be searching for a word, and is indirectly asking the listener for help in verbalizing that word, see section 6.5.5. Another factor is that dialogic syntax may be employed, in which case sentence structure and vocabulary used by the first speaker are reused by the second, see section 6.5.6.
A last factor motivating VS or VO order has to do with heaviness of the NP, discussed in section 6.5.7.
In section 6.5.8, the motivation for OSV constituent order is discussed. In this constituent order, both arguments appear before the verb, but the O is fronted. This is a marked order. It has the pragmatic function of calling attention to the O, of communicating in effect, “As for that…”.
36

Each of these factors is discussed below, together with examples to illustrate how each factor comes into play as speakers use the language to communicate. 6.5.1 Introduction or re-introduction of a participant
This section deals with constituent order variation related to the introduction or re-introduction of a participant. There were 33 instances of variant word order motivated by the introduction of new participants which were subsequently mentioned (tracked through the discourse).
However, there were 44 instances of SV or OV word order at the first mention of a referent which was subsequently mentioned. In many of these cases, the referents could be said to be accessible,38 even though they are being mentioned for the first time. These would include members of the immediate family or people otherwise well known to the speaker and the listener. Mass nouns, (like water or gravel), or non-identifiable NPs (like ‘somebody’ or ‘something’) may also appear before the V. We can assume that very little mental energy is required of the listener in accessing these elements, the first two because these people are easily accessible, the second two because these are general kinds of things. Examples of each of these are given below.
Additionally, 12 of the 44 cases occur in dependent clauses. Dependent clauses have a strong tendency to be SV and OV, often overriding pragmatic reasons for variant word order. See section 6.3, above, for several examples.
37

6.5.1.1 Introduction of new participants which motivate marked word order As has been documented for other Quechua languages,39 generally speaking,

new participants occur after the V. All of the 33 examples of this were found in

independent clauses. One example follows, where the speaker mentions for the first

time their cousin Tom, whom they rarely see. She then says more about him, that he

stayed at their house, etc. At this first mention, the S comes after the V.

6.5.1.2 First mentions which do not motivate marked word order The new participants which appear after the V are those for which the
speaker needs the listener to open a new cognitive file.40 We assume that mental energy is required to start files on these referents, to which more information will be added later.

38 Chafe (1987:25) defines a semi-active, or accessible concept as ‘one that is in a person’s peripheral consciousness, a concept of which a person has a background awareness, but which is not being directly focused on’.
39 See Fuqua 1992 for North Junín Quechua and Marsch 1993 for Margos Quechua. 40 When a new referent is introduced which is to have a part in the story subsequently, the speaker needs the hearer to establish a new cognitive “file” for that referent, to which information will be added as the story progresses. Du Bois 1980 and Payne 1993 use this term. Du Bois writes that indefinite articles serve to encourage the listener to establish new cognitive files (1980:221).
38

Contrastively, the first mentions41 in independent clauses that do not motivate marked word order are generally more accessible. Examples of each of the various types are given below.

6.5.1.2.1 Immediate family

The referent may be a member of the immediate family and very accessible

to the listener. In the following example, María is the wife of the listener. There were

7 instances of this type, not including the ones marked with -qa (see 6.5.1.2.2).

6.5.1.2.2 Referent well known to the speaker and the listener
First mentions of referents which are very familiar may be marked with -qa, the topic marker, as in (31), below. In the 12 instances where the new, subsequently mentioned referent is marked with -qa,42 both the speaker and the listener had previously had close association with the referent, though it had not been mentioned in this conversation. The purpose of the -qa in these cases is to communicate, “you

39

know, remember our previous experience with that”. It does not require much

cognitive energy to call up this type of referent. In using -qa with this kind of

referent, the speaker is communicating to the listener that this is the familiar thing

they both know about. The S or the O comes before the V in these cases. In the

example below, the ronda is a police force made up of men from the community.

One has been operating in their community for a number of years.

6.5.1.2.3 Mass nouns
In (32), ‘rock’ is a mass noun, which requires very little energy to access. It appears before the verb. There were 4 instances of this type.

42 Weber (1989:400) reports for Huallaga Quechua that -qa tends to occur on constituents that have been previously mentioned or alluded to, or are part of “general knowledge” and that some uses of -qa increase the salience of the constituent to which it is attached. His study shows that -qa is part of the system by which a speaker guides the attention of the hearer.
40

6.5.1.2.4 Argument is nonidentifiable
There are 3 instances where the NP is nonidentifiable,43 and even though it

is mentioned subsequently it does not become identifiable. The word order does not

vary in these instances. The speaker does not mark these NPs for special notice in

any way. For instance, in the conversation, Guillermo once referred to doing

‘everything’. It was not clear from the context exactly what ‘everything’ included. It

had to do with the various work projects he and Rita had been talking about.

rura-yka:-ya:-sha:-mi.

every.kind-OBJ-EVEN do-PROG-PL-1FUT-DIR

‘We’ll do everything.’ [GR, 597]

The introduction of nonidentifiable NPs does not seem to affect word order in

this language. There evidently is not a great cognitive cost in introducing new

nonidentifiable NPs, especially those which continue to be nonidentifiable as they are tracked through the discourse.
6.5.1.2.5 Referent is nonidentifiable but becomes identifiable
There is another kind of nonidentifiable NP which becomes identifiable. The word huk, the indefinite marker, which also means ‘one’, may be used with the first
43 Du Bois (1980:218) writes that an NP is identifiable “if the hearer can establish a link between the noun phrase and the concept it refers to”. He also writes that an important function of nonidentifiable mentions is to introduce new files (1980:220).

41

mention of such a nonidentifiable referent.44 The word order does not vary in these

cases, and it does not need to, because the new referent is marked with the indefinite

huk. A new cognitive file is opened in this case, because the referent becomes

identifiable after the first mention. The example below demonstrates the presentation

of this kind of referent. After this first mention, the ‘child’ was referred to without

the indefinite. There is one example of this in an independent clause and others in

dependent clauses.

(34) New, subsequently mentioned, SV, nonidentifiable, referential

S

V

Huk wamra .. hama-ra-yka-n.

a child rest-DUR-PROG-3

‘A child is resting.’ [FA, 888]

Hence, there are two types of nonidentifiable NPs, those which remain

nonidentifiable even though they are subsequently mentioned, and those which

become identifiable after the first mention. Both have SV or OV word order. The

first is unmarked, but the latter is marked with the indefinite huk and requires the

listener to open a new cognitive file.

In the next two paragraphs, reasoning is given to explain the remaining few

instances of SV and OV word order used in conjunction with new referents which

are subsequently mentioned.

Payne 1993 finds that identifiability is not one of the pragmatic factors affecting word order in Yagua, but reports (1993:305) that C. Jenson identifies it as a factor affecting word order in Wayampi, a Tupí-Guaraní language of northeastern Brazil. Bentivoglio and Weber 1986 determined that identifiability has an effect on subject word order in spoken Spanish.

42

6.5.1.2.6 Speaker does not know that an NP will be mentioned subsequently

A speaker may employ SV or OV word order when mentioning an NP for

the first time, not realizing that the NP will become referential later. This happened

in the telling of the “frog” story, because the speaker did not know in advance what

would happen on the next page. When mentioning the ‘owl’ the first time, the

speaker must have thought the owl was incidental and probably did not realize it

would have a part in the story subsequently. There are three occurrences of this kind

of thing. The ‘owl’ example follows.

‘Owl comes out of that hole where he (the child) had been playing.’ [FR, 1052]

6.5.1.2.7 Infinitival complements
Finally, infinitival complements to the verb are marked with accusative case and serve as Os. Clauses with new subsequently mentioned Os of this type had OV word order in both of the two instances, one of which is provided below. Two is very few instances, but they lead me to hypothesize that the presentation of a new subsequently mentioned infinitival complement does not require the opening of a

44 Additionally, in many folktales, the main characters are introduced with huk and are subsequently referred to without it. For instance, a fox may be introduced in the first line of a story with huk atoq, and then is subsequently referred to simply as atoq or atoq-qa.
43

new cognitive file.45 It can be argued that these complements are not really

participants but part of the verb complex.

‘In this one (this scene), the dog is wanting to go up.’[FA, 932]

Marked word order in association with a new referent signals that something

important is being introduced, something that the listener particularly needs to

notice. As seen above, not all new referents motivate variant word order. Those that

do not are either easily accessible to the listener or not of particular importance.

The next section deals with contrast, another factor affecting word order.

6.5.2 Contrast

Contrast is a factor known to motivate variant word order. Various

researchers studying word order variation have established this. See Mithun

(1992:37), Payne (1993:289), Ono and Suzuki (1992:435), and Marsch (1993:4).

Payne 1993 defines contrast, citing Chafe 1976 as “a situation where (a) there

is some propositional background knowledge in the hearer’s mind, but some item of

information is missing or incorrectly assumed; (b) there is a limited set of

possibilities in the addressee’s mind as to candidates which could supply the missing

or incorrectly assumed information; and (c) the speaker asserts which candidate is

45 However, contrast may be a factor influencing word order of infinitival complements in relation to the V. See (39).
44

the correct one.” Payne relates that the term “single focus contrast” is generally used for communicative situations meeting these three criteria. It is this type of contrast which motivates variant word order in each of the communicative situations described below. The speaker asserts which is the correct candidate, placing it after the V.
The speaker may specify a certain referent, may put emphasis on a certain referent, or focus on an infinitive complement of the verb. There are 34 instances in the data where contrast motivates variant word order. 6.5.2.1 Contrast involving specification of referent
As mentioned earlier, in this language the S and/or the O are frequently not specified overtly, but the person of the argument(s) is marked on the verb. Hence, it is possible for confusion to arise as to who or what is being talked about. When two or more entities have just been mentioned and are active in the minds of the speaker and the listener, either one could be a possibility for the referent. It is sometimes necessary to specify which one. The speaker needs to communicate, “Given the options, I’m talking about this one.”
The example below is from the beginning of the Achikay story. The story teller has just given the setting as ‘during a time of poverty’. She also explains that there were many people living at that time, parents and children. Then she keys in to a certain family, and, beginning the story says, ‘Because of the famine, they went to look for food, the parents.’ If she had not specified which referent, it may not have
45

been clear to the listener whether it was the parents or the children or both who went

to look for food. The order is VS, with the correct candidate placed after the V.

‘There were many parents and many children. So the parents went to look (for food).’ [AL, 603-604]

Sometimes it seems that mentioning the referent is almost an “afterthought”, as the

speaker realizes the listener may not understand clearly who is being referred to.

Marsch (1993:4) shows that this also happens in Margos Quechua.

The next type of contrast is closely related but slightly different from the

first.

6.5.2.2 Contrast involving emphasis on one referent Ono and Suzuki (1992:435) show that in Japanese, a strict verb-final
language, speakers may express the post-predicate element for the purpose of “further specification, emphasis and elaboration”. It seems that almost exactly the same thing happens in Quechua. In (38), below, the speakers have been talking about who came to the fiesta. Rita says that their Aunt Rose came. This aunt is elderly and not well. Guillermo responds, “Poor thing, even she came.” Of all the people they were talking about who could have come, SHE came, for whom it was difficult. The order is VS, with the referent which is being emphasized placed after the V.

Mithun (1992:37-38) also reports for Cayuga, Ngandi, and Coos that

constituents can represent a focus of contrast, very much like what is described

above. She also explains that any kind of constituent, pronominal, nominal, or even

verbal, can be the focus of a contrast. This is true for Quechua as well. In (39), the

infinitival complement to the verb represents a focus of contrast.

6.5.2.3 Contrast involving an infinitival object complement

In (39), the going or the not going is what is being contrasted. Rita had just

said she would go to Lima (to get a job), but then having pity on her elderly mother,

could not motivate herself to go. The ‘to go’ part of the verb, the object complement,

comes after the main part of the verb.

47

The infinitival object complements usually come before the verb. In 7 of the 8 instances in the database they came before the verb. The example above is a marked case.
The next section deals with another pragmatic motivation for variant word order, closing a unit of talk. 6.5.3 Closing a segment of talk
Closing statements fit into the type of operation Payne (1993:286) refers to as “chunking of discourse”, where variant orders may correlate with the opening, closing, peak of thematic units, or the beginning or end of event chains. 6.5.3.1 Closing statements in general
The example below includes the last few utterances of a segment of conversation between Rita and Guillermo. They are dealing with the problem of not having enough food for their animals due to lack of rain. This discussion takes place in a location distant from the town where they live. Guillermo will be getting back there before Rita. They have been talking about who could take the animals to the high pasture. Guillermo has agreed to talk to a family member about it when he gets home.
He uses variant word order to mark the closure. When he said, ‘We will all put everything in order’, he was wrapping up what they had just talked about with a concluding statement regarding what they were going to do.

In the database there are 42 closing statements, 37 of which exhibit variant word

order. Granted, it was somewhat subjective to code for closing statements. It was not

nearly so clear cut, for instance, as coding for whether or not a negative was present.

However, it is apparent to me that speakers use variant word order to mark closure.

Reasoning is given in the next few paragraphs.

A closing statement often has information that needs to be marked in some

way. It contains a key piece of information the listener needs to attend to, such as a

summary, a conclusion or the main point of the discussion thus far.

As mentioned above, 37 of the 42 closing statements exhibited variant word

order. The other 5 had SV word order. An examination of these 5 closing statements

shows that 4 of them are restatements of conclusions which had been stated

49

previously. The other one was marked as a conclusion through heavy use of obliques
and adverbial phrases. In the 4 instances of restatements of conclusions which had been given previously, there is nothing that needs to be marked.46 There is nothing
new that the listener needs to notice.
To summarize, closing statements are marked with variant word order, unless
they have been stated previously, or unless they are marked in another way, such as
with heavy use of accompanying obliques and adverbial phrases. It is noteworthy
that of the 37 instances of closing statements exhibiting variant word order, 28 of
them had no other discourse pragmatic reason to account for the variant word order.47
In the following section, discussion is provided showing that marked word
order in closing statements invites response.
46 Interestingly, Payne (1993:294, 306ff) reports the opposite for several other South American languages, namely Yagua, Hixkaryana (citing Derbyshire 1986), Brazilian Guaraní (citing Dooley 1982), and Wayampi. In these languages, restatement of previously mentioned information motivates marked pragmatic restructuring. Unmarked word order appears with the first statement and marked order with the restatement. She relates that for Hixkaryana at least, Derbyshire hypothesizes that the restatements are associated with the end of a discourse unit. Also, Payne relates (1993:295) that for the languages she discusses, “one motivation for simple restatement may be to rhetorically underline the importance of some part of a proposition, which was not made evident in the initial assertion of that proposition.” My sense for SCQ is that the first appearance of the concluding statement is marked because it is the conclusion. When the information is given a second time, it seems that the speaker is musing about what happened, rehashing it in his or her mind. Doing this does not require any special markedness because the speaker is not asking anything of the listener.
47 Frequently an utterance has more than one discourse pragmatic factor motivating variant word order. For instance, a concluding remark may also include an element of suspense. (See section 6.5.4.3.)
50

6.5.3.2 Closing statements invite response

Each time variant word order is used, there is something happening

pragmatically that the listener needs to notice. By way of variant word order in the

closing statement, the speaker indicates to the listener that for the moment s/he has

come to a stopping point and wants some feedback. In the conversation, in 14/17, or

82%, of the instances of closing statements, the addressee responded orally with a

comment, a question, or agreement.

Variant word order in closing statements also elicited feedback in the

storytelling, but to a much lesser extent. In the stories there was listener response to

5/20, or 25%, of the closing statements.

In the example below, the mother (L) has been telling the Achikay (Witch)

story to her son (E). She has told the part about how the witch gets the boy to go

upstairs to sleep, where the witch also sleeps, and about the cries from the boy in the

night. The next event in the story is given in (41). The speaker’s utterance with VO order invites a response, which she receives.48

48 In addition to making a concluding remark employing variant word order, another way to invite listener response is through use of a tag question, as in the first part of (40), above.

51

E: How did she finish him? L: She ate him.’ [LA, 688-690]
The next section deals with another pragmatic reason for varying the constituent order, that of introducing something unfamiliar or contrary to expectation. 6.5.4 Unfamiliar, contrary to expectation, suspenseful
Cumming and Ono (1997:116) state that, given the setting of the previous discourse, “We expect information which is relatively accessible or predictable to be coded with less linguistic work; conversely, information which is relatively inaccessible or surprising should be coded with special, heavy or ‘marked’ linguistic mechanisms.” This is just what happens in SCQ. Information which is unfamiliar or contrary to expectation is marked with variant word order. Information which is designed to produce suspense in the listener also fits into this category. There are 27 clauses in the database coded positively for this type of information and each one exhibits variant word order.
In addition to Cumming and Ono’s statement above, Payne 1993 gives additional support for “expectedness” being a factor affecting pragmatic marking. Payne points out that pragmatic markedness is related to what the speaker believes about what the hearer is expecting. She writes (1993:284), “The speaker is constantly making assumptions about the extent to which the hearer’s information network matches his or her own, including the extent to which the hearer may be expecting certain information” and (1993:286) “pragmatic markedness has to do
52

with the speaker’s assumptions about the hearer’s expectations based on the latter’s

knowledge structure.”

One important point to make in relation to the three features mentioned above

is that they apply to the listener, and not necessarily to the participants in the story

being told. For the word order to vary, the information being conveyed must be

unfamiliar to the listener, must be contrary to what the speaker believes the listener

is expecting to hear, or must produce suspense in the listener.

An example is provided below of an instance where a participant in the

“frog” story was surprised. When a gopher comes up out of a hole, the child, who

has been peering into the hole, is surprised and scared. However, when the story

teller says, “The child is scared”, no suspense is produced in the listener. (Both the

speaker and the listener can see what happened on the page.) If, however, the

storyteller had reversed the order of S and V and had said, Mantsakasha kaykan

wamraqa, I would predict that this would have produced suspense in the listener and

she would have known that something interesting was going to happen to the child.

As it was, it was a simple statement of fact, a comment not meant to produce

suspense in the listener.

In the next three subsections, examples demonstrating the types of information which affect constituent order are provided.

6.5.4.1 Unfamiliar

Constituent order is varied when introducing the unfamiliar. In (43)

Guillermo is explaining to Rita what a glossary is. The constituent order is VO.

‘At that end of Mark (book) it says whatever things are not understood.’ [GR, 388]

6.5.4.2 Contrary to expectation

In the following example, also from the conversation between Rita and

Guillermo, the purpose of the variation in word order is to communicate to

Guillermo that what actually happened is contrary to what he would have expected.

In this culture it would not be expected that immediate family would drink the hot

beverage that was prepared for paying customers. However, when their uncle (more

distant family) offered to treat them and paid for the drink, they accepted.

6.5.4.3 Suspenseful

In the Achikay story, the witch had arranged with her daughter to push the

girl visitor into the cooking pot so that they could eat her for dinner. However, the

girl who was visiting overheard the instructions. The O appears after the V,

heightening the suspense in the story. The listener knows something interesting is going to happen, but does not yet know what.49

The next section deals with another pragmatic factor, that of the speaker

looking for a word and indirectly asking the listener for help.

6.5.5 Word search

There are 20 obvious instances in the database where the speaker is looking

for a word. In each case, variant word order is exhibited. The fact that the speaker is

searching for a word is often indicated by use of na-, a morpheme that takes the

place of the root the speaker is searching for. It can take morphology, as is seen in

(46) below. A pause is another indication that the speaker is searching for a word.

Sometimes there is use of na- with a pause.

6.5.6 Dialogic syntax

There are three instances where dialogic syntax can be observed in the

database. Two of them appear with variant word order. Du Bois (2001:1) explains

dialogic syntax as occurring “when one speaker constructs an utterance based on the

immediately co-present utterance of a dialogic partner. Words, structures, and other

linguistic resources invoked by the first speaker are reused by the second.” In the

second sentence of the example below, the fact that dialogic syntax is being

employed explains the variant word order. None of the other discourse-pragmatic

factors I coded for are present in the second sentence.

Rita was relaying to Guillermo a conversation that had taken place in their

community related to determining who had taken someone’s shoes. The situation

became complicated as various people accused other people. At one point, Guillermo

tries to draw closure to what Rita was relating to him. The variant word order in the

first sentence can be explained by the fact that he is trying to draw a conclusion from

that segment of the conversation and is inviting a response from her (section 6.5.3.2).

The response she gave was one of agreement. She used several of his words and his

constituent order. She replaced his first word with a synonym.

The next section deals with the relationship of heavy NPs to word order.

6.5.7 Heaviness Ss, Os and As which consist of lists or heavy NPs51 generally go before the

V, unless one of the pragmatic reasons described above is present, motivating

appearance after the V. However, if the NP is exceedingly heavy, it may come after

the V, even in the absence of any other pragmatic reason.

Hawkins (1983:106) argues that psycholinguistic principles involving

language use, such as processing difficulty, memory, complexity, etc. help explain why heavy elements can appear in a subsequent position.52 These same

psycholinguistic principles are probably motivating the placement of very heavy NPs

after the V in Quechua.

50 The precise difference in meaning between the two evidentials -chir, used in Guillermo’s statement, and -chi, used in Rita’s statement, has not been defined. A speaker uses them to suggest the veracity of the statement he/she is uttering, without knowing for certain if it is true or not.
51 NPs which are composed of three or more words were counted as heavy NPs. 52 Hawkins illustrates with the English Complex NP shift (1983:91), and also discusses the preference heavy modifiers have for a rightward position within the NP (1983:101). See also Hawkins 1994 and Arnold, Wasow, Losongco and Ginstrom 2000.
57

Below, (48) shows a simple independent clause with a heavy NP coming before the verb, and then, (49) shows an extremely long NP appearing after the V. 6.5.7.1 List or heavy NPs
Heavy Ss, Os and As go before the V unless they are exceedingly long or unless there is an accompanying pragmatic reason for their placement after the V. In (48), the word order is SV, with a heavy NP appearing before the V.
(48) Heavy S
S Miku-y-qA ni pa:ha-lla-pis ni panqa-lla-pis eat-INF-TOP nor straw-JUST-EVEN nor husk-JUST-EVEN
V ka-n-tsu. be-3-NEG ‘There is no food, not even straw or corn husks.’ [GR, 581]
6.5.7.2 Exceedingly long NP placed after the V There are several instances where an exceedingly long argument follows the
V, rather than appearing before it. In two of those instances, there is nothing else happening pragmatically to motivate the variant word order. The example below exhibits SVO order, with an exceedingly long O.
58

‘And he surely knows what kind of hearts we have, whether we are bad or good hearted.’ [GR, 590]

There were 50 instances in the database of heavy NPs serving as arguments. Of

those, in each of the 21 cases where the argument appeared before the V, none of the

pragmatic factors discussed above were present. In the 22 cases where it appeared

after the V, at least one of the pragmatic motivations discussed above was present.

There were 2 cases of exceedingly heavy NPs appearing after the V though no other

pragmatic motivation was present.

Finally, there were 5 cases where new, but not subsequently mentioned heavy

NPs appeared after the verb. As was discussed in section 6.5.1.1, the introduction of

new referents which are subsequently mentioned motivates VS and VO word order.

Those arguments which are only mentioned once, and are not subsequently tracked

through the discourse do not motivate variant word order. However, it appears that if

the argument is heavy as well as new, that those two factors together tip the balance

scale and motivate appearance of the argument after the V.

59

The next section deals with the factors motivating the appearance of the O

before the S, which is also variant constituent order for this language.

6.5.8 “As for”, OSV word order There are seven instances of OSV word order.53 Neither argument comes

after the V, but rather the O appears before the S, which is not typical. Fronting the

O has the effect of calling attention to it, communicating in effect “As for that…”.

Of the seven instances of this constituent order, six occurred in the conversation. The

first speaker talks about something and the second wants to make a related point. In

the example below, Guillermo has been talking about a story he wrote, explaining

that he has been doing comprehension checking on it in the community. Rita jumps

in to say that she has read the manuscript. A free gloss for the example would be,

“Oh yeah. As for that, I read it too.”

(50) “As for”, OSV, in conversation

O

S

V

Aha. Tsay-ta noqa-pis liyi-ra-:-mi.

Oh.yeah that-OBJ I-EVEN read-PST-1-DIR

‘Oh yeah. (As for that)I read it too.’ [GR, 384]

The seven instances exhibiting OSV order cannot be categorized as contrasts

(as discussed in 6.5.2), because there are no contrastive elements present in the

preceding discourse. I hypothesize that this is a method by which a person can link

her talk to the previous talk and communicate that she too is interested in what the

first speaker was saying. If Rita had used SOV word order here, I believe she would

60

have communicated that she was not too excited about the story he had written. If she had used SVO word order,54 Guillermo could have drawn one of several possible

conclusions: 1) she was contrasting it with something (but there was nothing on

stage for it to contrast with), 2) she was trying to close the conversation on this point,

3) or that there is something he does not know about this book that she is going to

tell him. None of these were true. To indicate simple interest in the book, she had to

front the O. The six instances in the conversation were of this type.

In reference to the one instance in narrative, immediately before its

occurrence, the speaker had digressed to mention something that was happening on

the side. She then came back to the main event she had been talking about, and

fronted the O, as if to say “as for …” or “back to…”. In the “frog” story, the

storyteller says, “The deer is carrying the child in its horns. The dog is running along

beside.” She then says, coming back to the child, the main protagonist, “In this one

(on this page) now the deer throws the child off.” Hence, fronting the O can also re-

establish the main participant after a digression.

6.5.9 Numeric breakdown and summary

A numeric breakdown is given in the Table 6 below, showing how many

clauses were coded positively for each factor known to motivate variant constituent

order. No one factor seems to be more prominent than any other factor in producing

marked constituent order. The first six factors are those which most frequently

account for variant word order, but the others are also important and worthy of

mention.

There were 139 clauses in the database exhibiting variant word order, compared with

406 exhibiting the non-variant SV, OV or SOV orders. The total in the table above

(191) is greater than 139, due to the fact that some clauses exhibited more than one

of the factors.

The analysis in section 6.5 has accounted for all the 139 clauses exhibiting

variant word order. In each of the 139 clauses, at least one of the factors discussed

above serves to motivate variant word order.

62

What overarching statement can be made to describe the purpose behind variant word order in this language? Based on the analysis presented in this section, the appearance of variant word order in a clause shows that something special is happening pragmatically in that clause; variant word order is a signpost to the listener that there is something s/he should notice. 6.6 Intonation and other factors accompanying variant word order
Several factors may accompany variation in word order, factors which aid in calling the listener’s attention to elements which are new, in contrast, etc. These factors include: 1) a rise in pitch or intensity on the element following the verb, 2) a pause preceding the element, 3) -qa, the “topic” marker, attached to the element. Of these factors, a rise in pitch on the newsworthy element is the factor which most often accompanies variant word order.
I first examined pitch and intensity traces for 16 simple declarative sentences with SV, OV or SOV order, section 6.6.1. For comparison, I then studied the traces in 17 declarative sentences with variant word order, section 6.6.2. 6.6.1 Patterns for sentences with nonvariant word order
Regarding the sentences with nonvariant word order, it is interesting that three patterns surfaced.
In the first pattern observed, pitch and intensity show very little variation across the utterance, but they do fall at the close of the sentence.
In the second pattern, the first syllable of each word has high pitch, which gradually falls as the subsequent syllables are pronounced, so that the last syllable of
63

the word has low pitch. The pitch is reset at the initial level for the first syllable of each successive word in the clause. The pitch fall is greater on last syllable of the last word than on the other words. In this language, the primary stress usually comes on the first syllable, which would help to explain this second pitch pattern.
In the third pattern, there is a rise in pitch across the clause or sentence. The speaker’s voice is low at the beginning, and then gets higher and higher in pitch. At the very end of the sentence it drops.
The discovery of the pragmatic functions for these distinct intonation patterns is left for further study. 6.6.2 Patterns for sentences with variant word order
In relation to rise in pitch and intensity, in a study on Siouan, Caddoan, and Iroquoian languages, Mithun (1995:421) finds that “The most newsworthy elements are generally uttered with the highest volume and pitch…” There seems to be a tendency this way also in SCQ, especially regarding highest pitch on the newsworthy element.
Of the sample of 17 sentences with variant word order, the first two kinds of patterns mentioned in 6.6.1, above, were observed in the initial parts of the sentences. In 10/17 of the cases, though, the pitch on the constituent appearing after the verb was higher than the pitch on any preceding segment in the sentence. This is distinct from the sentences with nonvariant order, where there were no instances of pitch rise on the last element, (except in the third pattern above, which has a pitch rise across the whole clause.)
64

In only one of the 17 cases was the intensity higher than that of the preceding words.
In 5/17 of the cases, there was a pause before the constituent appearing after the verb.
-qa, the “topic” marker, appeared on 5/17 of the constituents which come after the verb. This could have the effect of calling the listener's attention to this element, much like raised pitch would.
In several cases, two of the above factors were present. For instance, there may be pitch rise on the element appearing after the verb, along with a pause preceding it.
This section has provided a brief glimpse of the prosodical and morphological factors accompanying variant word order and of the intonation patterns observable in sentences with nonvariant word order. Further work in these areas should be fruitful.
7 Conclusion Word order in SCQ is dependent on grammatical relations. This language has been shown to have a “basic” word order of SV&OV, based on frequency counts. SV occurs 82% of the time in clauses with both an S and a V, while OV word order occurs 70% of the time in clauses with both an O and a V. Word order may vary from the most frequent order, and this is not arbitrary; it is motivated by discoursepragmatic factors, as described in section 6.5 and summarized in Table 6.
65

South Conchucos does exhibit many of the correlates of the SOV type as observed by Greenberg 1966. However, if frequencies of the various word orders are considered, this language cannot be classified by the traditional six-way typology, as shown in section 6.2. Dryer’s four-way typology (1997a) does make it possible though, to determine “basic” word order for this language, consistent with his 2:1 frequency criterion.
In relation to the variation of word order due to pragmatic factors, Mithun (1992:58-59) observes that in languages with syntactically-based constituent order, pragmatically-marked order “is usually assumed to result in a theme-rheme order, with elements of lower communicative dynamism at the beginning of clauses, followed by increasingly more important or newsworthy elements.” This general principle, that the noteworthy element comes at the end of the clause for languages with syntactically-based order, holds true for SCQ. When an argument comes after the V in this language, something special is happening pragmatically in the clause, something the listener needs to notice.
This study has shown that various discourse-pragmatic factors affect word order in this language. Variant word order appears when the speaker is finishing what s/he wanted to say and is offering the floor to the listener for commentary, when the speaker is focusing on a certain referent, when a new participant is being introduced, when something unfamiliar or contrary to expectation is being presented, or when the speaker is looking for a word. Additionally, very heavy arguments often appear after the verb.
