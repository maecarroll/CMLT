Following Smith’s (1991, 1997) two-component theory, this dissertation investigates the structural characteristics and the semantic properties of the temporal system, including tense, mood, viewpoint aspect, situation aspect and discourse modes, of Iquito, a highly endangered and moribund language spoken in the northern Peruvian Amazon.
Iquito has three tenses: Extended Current Tense, Recent Past Tense, and Distant Past Tense. Extended Current Tense gives a Reference Time (RT) frame from the day which includes Speech Time (SpT) to the infinite future. Therefore, situations occurring earlier on the same day or unrealized situations both appear in sentences with this tense. The temporal interpretation is inferred from the combination of aspect and mood morphology. Recent Past Tense gives a frame of RT from yesterday to one to two years prior to SpT. Distant Past Tense gives a frame of RT from one to two years prior to SpT extending backward to the infinitely remote past. Temporal boundaries among the tenses are not rigidly fixed in terms of a metrical conception of time. Iquito has seven perfective aspects, including a General, a Momentary, a Remote, two Deictic, an Allative, and an
vii

Ablative Perfective Aspect and one Imperfective Aspect. Remote Perfective Aspect incorporates an adverbial component while Ablative and Allative Perfectives incorporate directional components and Deictic Perfectives incorporate deictic components. The system of perfective aspects in Iquito manifests the importance of expressing the realization of an event in conjunction with information about the time of the day, location, and routing in terms of location. Regarding situation aspect, I propose that there are six types in Iquito, including States, Activities, Accomplishments, Achievements, Semelfactives and Motions, which all manifest language-specific correlates. With respect to grammatical moods, realis and irrealis moods are manifested in Iquito through a typologically unique strategy: word order change and vowel hiatus resolution. Regarding Discourse Modes, I find four modes in Iquito, including Narrative, Report, Description and Information. In addition, Quoted Speech manifests an interesting mixture of modes.
This dissertation adds another dimension to the close connections among tense, aspect and mood, and contributes to linguistic documentation and advances the structural and semantic analysis of Iquito and Amazonian languages. It also contributes to research on the crosslinguistic variation of temporal semantics and to linguistics in general through an interesting case study.

Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1 PURPOSE AND CENTRAL QUESTIONS OF THE STUDY There are currently around 6000 languages spoken in the world. However, the
average rate of language death is one language every two weeks. That is to say, at least half of the languages on the planet will disappear in the very century in which we live now. One of the fundamental goals in linguistics is to discover language universals—how all languages are similar to each other—as well as language variations—how different languages can be. To achieve this goal, it is urgent and essential for linguists to contact speakers and to document as many languages as possible, especially under the circumstance that languages are disappearing at such an alarming rate. Iquito is a Zaparoan language spoken in the northern Peruvian Amazon. Out of the seven Zaparoan languages, three are still spoken nowadays: Iquito currently only has 25 speakers; Arabela has around 100; Záparo has virtually no fluent speakers left.
The present dissertation research on the Iquito tense, mood and aspect (TMA) system emerges from my continuing linguistic research1 in the Iquito community of San Antonio de Pintuyacu in the northern Peruvian Amazon since 2003, the year in which I joined the Iquito Language Documentation Project (the ILDP hereafter). Among the topics of linguistic research done on Iquito, TMA has been one of the most challenging, problematic and interesting ones. Matthew S. Dryer (2005: 282), among many other authors, points out that “it is frequently difficult to determine from descriptive grammars whether a category ought to be considered tense or aspect. Different descriptions of the same language often differ in whether they characterize a category as one of tense or as one of aspect.” Dryer’s assertion motivates me very much to provide a detailed study,
1 Specific periods of my fieldwork are detailed in §2.2 Methodology.
1

descriptively, analytically, as well as theoretically, and to present convincing evidence supporting my decision to designate a certain category as tense or as aspect in Iquito.
The goal of this dissertation is to provide a detailed description of Iquito tense and aspect, to propose a strong analysis under Smith’s (1997[1991]) two-component theory and to offer a typological comparison with the languages of the world, which is not yet available for Iquito or other Zaparoan languages. The dissertation will also include discussions of grammatical mood in Iquito with the expectation to add another dimension to the close connections between tense, mood and aspect. The fieldwork conducted by the ILDP from 2003-2005 produced a basic understanding of tense, aspect and mood from oral texts in Iquito that was quite unanimous among the project members. However, because Iquito has a very unique and complicated tense and aspect system, many details and analyses of this system cannot be assured or even understood without systematic elicitation, including semantic tests and questionnaires, especially because certain viewpoint aspects do not occur frequently enough in any given natural text. These tasks were carried out during the dissertation fieldwork in 2006. In this dissertation, of course, I provide data not only from elicitation examples, but also from spontaneous conversational texts and narratives. The fundamental research questions of this study, which were unclear prior to the dissertation fieldwork, include: 1) Does Iquito have tense? If so, what are the tenses and how are they defined? 2) Does Iquito have relative tense? Tense, grammaticalized location in time (Comrie, 1985), takes some reference time as the deictic center from which it indicates the distance of an event. Therefore, this dissertation not only looks at independent sentences but also at the discourse context. Most tenses take utterance time as the deictic center in independent principal clauses, but they can depend on reference time in some cases. I study the Iquito patterns of different clause types (e.g. subordinate clauses, when clauses, etc.) and the discourse of narratives
2

in light of the well-established facts in Smith (1991, 1997, 2003). 3) Is future expressed by a modal category or tense, or a combination of both? 4) Is the tense category restricted to a certain type of situation, e.g. stative or dynamic? 5) How many viewpoint aspects and morphemes of temporal function are there in Iquito? 6) Does aspect interact with modal constructions? 7) Does aspect contribute to temporal interpretation? 8) Do viewpoint aspect and lexical aspect of predicates interact? In answering all the aforementioned questions, the goal of the dissertation research is to define the Iquito tense, mood and aspect categories, and to discover their interactions and patterns of obligatoriness. This dissertation pursues a thorough understanding of the temporal system of the Iquito Language.
This project has intellectual merit in that it will contribute to the linguistic documentation of the Iquito language, a highly endangered Zaparoan language. This study will also highlight the language-specific characteristics of Iquito and advance and contribute to the analysis and the overall understanding of TMA systems crosslinguistically. It advances general linguistics because the TMA system of a language is one of the most fundamental components of the grammar. It relates to the understanding of central cognitive categories. How different situation types of the verbs are categorized has to do with how a prototype is perceived. The way Iquito organizes temporal/modal/aspectual expressions and categorizes verb types and predicate arguments will present a variation in comparison with other languages. This study will add to our knowledge of how human languages pattern in terms of TMA systems and will contribute to the study of prototypes. As a broader impact, this project will bring together the linguistic description and theory of TMA systems and add to our knowledge of human brains and human languages. In short, it is expected that the detailed description, analysis and discussion of the Iquito temporal system included in this work will
3

contribute not only to the documentation of the Iquito, Zaparoan, and Amazonian languages, but also to linguistic theories and typological linguistics.
1.2 THE IQUITO PEOPLE AND LANGUAGE This section examines some of the most important social and historical factors
affecting the vitality of the Iquito language. The data used for this section include: 1) approximately 9 hours of interviews with 8 Iquito speakers, recorded by Karina Sullón Acosta, a member of the ILDP during the summer of 2005; 2) two articles by Beier and Michael, (2002, 2003); and 3) independent observations from my own fieldwork with the ILDP.
This section begins with a historical overview, including a brief description of Iquito’s place in the Zaparoan family of languages, in order to contextualize the processes and stages of language shift in the Iquito case. Iquito language loss actually started within a historical context larger than just the language itself. This section discusses the relationship between historical diversity and the change of group identity, the political and social factors that led to the language shift and the attitude of the Iquito people towards their culture due to external pressure and cultural differences. Next the section turns to a discussion of the current situation of and the potential for language maintenance.
1.2.1 Iquito Language Shift and Maintenance Iquito, the name used for both the ethnic group and the language, is one of seven
Zaparoan languages that were spoken in the Northern Peruvian Amazon. Besides Iquito, only Arabela and Záparo survive (as detailed below). The Iquito population currently can
4

be found concentrated in two areas on the Pintuyacu and Chambira Rivers. The largest and most concentrated population is found in the community of San Antonio de Pintuyacu, Loreto, Peru. There are only about 25 fluent native speakers, 23 of whom live in San Antonio de Pintuyacu. None of them are monolingual. The native people identify themselves by the name of the river beside which they were born or by the name of the group to which the river corresponds.
Historically, there were six sub-groups of Iquito, according to the interview data, distributed throughout the region of the Chambira, Pintuyacu, Nanay, Mazán and Momón Rivers. The group Majanacani lived in the region of the Momón and Chambira Rivers. Their physical characteristics were described by the 8 interviewed Iquito speakers as short and potbellied, with thick thighs and small feet. The group Incahu+raana2 lived near the headwaters of the Pintuyacu River. This is the group of people who migrated to where the current city of Iquitos is today. Their physical characteristics were described as tall, light skinned and chubby. The Namutujuri group lived near the riverhead of Río Nanay. Their physical characteristics were described as potbellied with slim thighs. The Cajiyuri group lived in the region of the Pintuyacu. They were described as tall and chubby. The group Amuhuaja was described as a roaming tribe which did not settle in one place. The group Masicuri lived in the region of the Mazán River. They were described as small and thin, with delicate faces. These six groups of Iquito represent six dialects of one language. One thing to be noted is that although almost all of the interviewees were able to identify their individual origins in terms of these six groups, they emphasized that they are all Iquito people, a unified group. And indeed, a few of them were not able to distinguish the different groups of Iquito. In the following, I briefly represent the history of language shift of the Iquito language to Spanish.
2 The plus sign ‘+’ is used in Iquito orthography to indicate the sound of barred ‘i’ in IPA.

The seven languages of the Zaparoan family were estimated to have approximately 10,000 speakers for each language in pre-Columbian times. For the past three hundreds years, the number of speakers of these seven languages has declined due to political pressures brought about by colonization. The Andoa, Aushiri, Cahuarano and Omurano languages have become extinct, while the remaining three languages, Arabela, Iquito and Záparo, are now on the verge of extinction as well. When Catholic missionaries first arrived in the Amazon Basin in the 1600s, the Iquito people inhabited a fairly broad area as discussed above. Because of oppression and violence, which will be discussed below, the Iquito population gradually became concentrated and was reduced to about 500 people. When the Protestant missionary linguists of the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL hereafter) arrived in the community of San Antonio de Pintuyacu in 1958, most of the adults were Iquito speakers. Linguists of SIL suggested that up until the 1930s, most of the Iquito people had been monolingual speakers. The situation of the Iquito language before the 1950s corresponds to the first stage of language shift outlined by Fishman (1985): language use is influenced by the institutional power of the social attitude of the majority group. The following diagram illustrates the Zaparoan family and the sub-groups of the Iquito language.

In the early 1900’s the mestizo Güímack family4 arrived in the region and adopted a forceful and strong approach to promoting the use of Spanish and repressing the use of indigenous language. This situation was especially serious from 1950 to 1980 (as detailed below). When Robert and Elizabeth Eastman of SIL arrived in San Antonio in 1958, all of the adults were able to speak Iquito. However, there was a high percentage of bilingualism among adults, and the loss of Iquito had started among children. Eastman (as cited in Beier and Michael, 2002) indicates that if both parents of the child were Iquito, the child would learn the language. If one of the two parents of the child was not Iquito, the Iquito language would not be passed on to the child. As such, inter-dialectal (i.e., marriage of Cajiyuri and Namutujuri, among others) marriage contributed to the loss of the diversity within the language, and inter-ethnic (i.e., marriage of Iquito and Spanish) marriage, plus external pressure, led to the loss of the language. According to current community members, 1950-1980 was an era of strong racism caused by the newcomers who brought political pressure. Speaking Iquito was a marker of indigenous identity, which was perceived as shameful, so they stopped speaking in Iquito in most contexts; the Iquito language use ceased to exist in all public domains.
Daily use of Iquito continued until about the 1980s because there were still monolingual Iquito speakers. Towards the end of the 1980s, monolingual speakers started to pass away. The population of monolingual speakers became smaller, leaving behind a majority of bilingual speakers. Thus, the absolute need to speak the Iquito language in order to communicate with monolingual speakers started to disappear. Furthermore, in the early 1990s, there were several severe waves of malaria. Almost all senior
4 The Güímacks were Peruvian mestizos who came from the highlands as patrones during the rubber boom; the ‘mixed race’ Güímacks that now exist resulted from ‘mixing’ between mestizo men and Iquito women subsequent to the Güímacks’ arrival (personal communication with Chris Beier, December, 15, 2005).
7

monolingual speakers and a considerable number of bilingual speakers were infected and died. As noted, currently there are only 23 bilingual speakers left in the community of San Antonio de Pintuyacu.
The 1950s was a crucial period in terms of the loss of Iquito. Besides the strong presence of the mixed-race Güímack family, the last Iquito tribal leader died at the same time. This death represented a loss of local authority among the Iquito people. In addition, more immigrants coming from the highlands also arrived at the same time (Sullón, 2005). These newcomers came with pigs, abundant food, and other assets. Not long after their arrival, a new social hierarchy was developed in the community. The Iquito people were seen as poorer compared with the new community members. Meanwhile, due to the death of the last tribal leader, there was no internal authority among the people themselves. The Güímack family became the only authority and used violence to impose the use of Spanish. They encouraged social dependency, inter-ethnic marriage and external political force; therefore, Iquito people stopped passing on their native language to the next generation. At about the same time, Protestant Christian missionaries, bringing abundant medical resources and food, also arrived to convert the indigenous people to Christianity. The Bible stories they told reflected an entirely different way of life from traditional Iquito life. The indigenous people were ashamed for many of their cultural practices. The lack of authority among Iquito people at this period of time encouraged the loss of cultural practices. The abandonment of the language and also the cultural practices signaled relinguification and reethnification as the Iquito not only gave up their ethnic language and many cultural practices, but also came to view the ethnic language and these practices in negative ways. When interviewed, for example, some speakers said that their ancestors were nude and sometimes painted their bodies with plant pigments of a neutral tone. Some commented that their ancestors had been like
8

animals, wandering in the jungle. Some speakers did not admit that the ancestors sometimes painted their bodies. An obvious sense of shame can be discerned in the recorded interviews.
The situation of the Iquito language between 1950 and 1990 corresponds to the second and third stage of language shift outlined by Fishman (1985): the social dependency of the minority group on the majority group and relinguification and reethnification. The only caveat is that the terms ‘minority’ and ‘majority’ are not defined in terms of number, but in terms of power and wealth.
All of the 25 fluent native speakers are at least 58 years old. There is no fluent Iquito speaker younger than this age. In addition, there are about 15-20 semi-speakers and about 15-25 passive speakers (Beier and Michael, 2002). The ages of the semispeakers and passive speakers ranges from 27-57 years old. People in the community continue to practice inter-ethnic marriage. Many of them now also marry people from the Iquitos area. Thus, the population continues to become more diverse in terms of linguistic and ethnic background. The use of the Iquito language is currently extremely limited. This fact can be attributed to the now small number of fluent speakers and their language attitudes. Fewer than 10 of the 23 speakers in the community state that they should not feel ashamed of speaking Iquito, while the rest of them still reported hesitancy in using Iquito as a means of communication among speakers. Even in a home setting where there are two or more Iquito speakers, Iquito is reportedly used much less than Spanish.
Since the mid-1990s, the racism characteristic of the period from 1950-1980 has become milder. The Iquito people strongly state that the situation of their ethnic language is critical, and they have been pursuing assistance from the regional provincial government for language revitalization and preservation. They have requested help in establishing bilingual primary and secondary schools to help preserve their own
9

language. They have also sent a request, through the regional government, for linguists to help with planning preservation-related issues and details. The ILDP, based at the University of Texas at Austin, has been working with the community of San Antonio de Pintuyacu since 2001. The preparation of the reference grammar and pedagogical materials started in 2002.
The linguistic situation of the Iquito language since the mid-1990s corresponds to the fourth stage of language shift outlined by Fishman (1985), representing the possibility of a reaction that sets the scene for language revitalization and maintenance. In his research as a sociologist, Fishman (1985) used three variables to make predictions about language maintenance: the number of native speakers claimed in the census as an indication of the number of speakers of a language, the quantity of institutional resources available for the language, and an index relationship between the two. The following section discusses what actions the community has taken in elevating the number of speakers and the institutional resources available for the language. It also discusses the relationship between speakers’ language attitudes and behaviors to estimate the potential of Iquito language revitalization and maintenance.
Although some speakers report that they value their ethnic language and claim they should not be ashamed of speaking it, the strong personal and social impact of racism since the arrival of Europeans in the sixteenth century cannot be changed overnight or even in a few years. Speakers have taken small steps in increasing the domains of language use. According to self-reported data, speakers say that they use Iquito with other speakers more frequently than before. In addition, in the celebration of Peruvian Independence Day in 2003, public speeches in Iquito were given. Although Iquito language use remains infrequent and symbolic, its language status has been enhanced in public domains. Iquito, as a subject, is now taught in primary and secondary
10

schools with materials created for this purpose. Children who have studied the language in school talk about it at home with their parents. Therefore, one interesting phenomenon is that adults are learning some Iquito through their children.
While many people are enthusiastic about revitalizing the language, the actual situation is more complicated. Descendents of immigrants from the highlands are indifferent to and even critical of Iquito language preservation. The majority of the mixed-race Güímack family is very enthusiastic about the ILDP linguistics project. However, most of the young Iquito people are not interested in learning linguistics or, ultimately, in learning to teach and conduct linguistics-related tasks for their ethnic language. Two young Iquito people, Miloslava and Arturo, who were originally interested in learning to be community linguists, could not continue to dedicate the time to learning linguistics and Iquito. The Iquito people have learned gradually to appreciate the effort of some descendants of the Güímack family, but the community still has a long way to go toward language revitalization because community-based efforts are essential to this goal.
The Peruvian government has already put in place legislation that clearly supports the preservation of indigenous languages, as well as their use in early education. Iquito is the official language of the community described here while Spanish and Quechua are the official languages of Peru. Thus, the political context is appropriate for language maintenance in the Iquito case. However, to teach and learn a language, it is necessary to have teachers who can teach and materials for them to use. To have teachers, the community needs to have trained bilingual teachers with the resources provided by the government. The original teachers of primary and secondary schools have contacted the cultural and educational department of the local provincial government, which has shown high respect for the indigenous languages of the Amazon basin and has been conducting
11

bilingual education programs, to demonstrate their goal of becoming eligible bilingual teachers. Together with the NGO Lupuna, an educational organization, the community teachers and the provincial government have successfully established bilingual schools and developed limited pedagogical materials. The support of the local government has been important in assuring the education and the training of Iquito people to be bilingual teachers. The community has incorporated senior Iquito speakers in the bilingual education classroom. Specifically, a bilingual teacher conducts the class while an Iquito speaker models the content of the language.5
Besides teachers, pedagogical materials are also in demand. One point to recognize is that the language must be taught not only to children, but to adults as well in order to maintain it. In addition to the home setting, where children talk to their parents about what they learn from the school, printed materials are also important in the long run for helping to preserve the language. Since the language cannot be learned naturally from the earlier generation, the materials for language learning include a grammar, which covers different aspects of the Iquito language, a dictionary, and a collection of texts, which represents the actual usage of Iquito. The ILDP has been preparing these materials since 2002.
The linguistic research of the ILDP plays an important role in the language maintenance of Iquito. It started with providing a practical and simple orthography, modified from the earlier orthography designed by the Eastmans of the SIL, and it has continued to create linguistic materials, including a descriptive reference grammar, a pedagogical grammar, a dictionary and a text collection.
5 Of course, in many cases, the scope of learning is limited to vocabulary and fixed phrases.

1.2.2 Main Speakers and the Community of the Study The data of the Iquito language in the current study were collected in the Iquito
community of San Antonio de Pintuyacu, Loreto, Peru, in consultation with four principal, fluent native speakers. Throughout the dissertation, I use the terms speaker, informant, and consultant, interchangeably in referring to them. The four speakers are Ema Llona Yareja, Hermenegildo Díaz Cuyasa, Jaime Pacaya Inuma, and Ligia Inuma Inuma. Their ages range from 58 to around 78 years of age. In the body of the text of discussion, I often address them by first name. However, in the specific context of discussing the variations of their speaking styles or dialectal differences, I chose to use the abbreviated forms to indicate the source of the data and the participants due to high frequency of reference. The abbreviations are ELY for Ema Llona Yareja, HDC for Hermenegildo Díaz Cuyasa, IWL for myself, JPI for Jaime Pacaya Inuma, and LII for Ligia Inuma Inuma.
1.2.3 Iquito Orthography The ILDP has adopted the following orthography (i.e. phonemic6) for the Iquito
language. In the following, I introduce first the consonants and then the vowels; the graphemes can be written in both upper and lower case. I also include the corresponding IPA symbols between square brackets.
There are ten consonants in Iquito: p represents the voiceless aspirated bilabial stop [ph]. t represents the voiceless aspirated alveolar stop [th].
6 For detailed discussions on Iquito sound inventory, please refer to Sullón (2004) and Rauschuber (2005).
13

c or qu represents the voiceless aspirated velar stop [kh]; the digraph qu is specifically used preceding the high front [i] or high central [] vowels.
s represents the voiceless alveolar fricative [s]. j represents the voiceless glottal fricative [h]. m represents the bilabial nasal [m]. n represents the alveolar nasal [n]. r represents the alveolar flap [].7 y represents the palatal approximant [j]. hu or u represents the labio-velar approximant [w];the digraph hu is used when
there is no preceding consonant.
There are eight vowels in Iquito, four short vowels and four long vowels: a represents the low back unrounded vowel [a]. aa represents the long version of the low back vowel. i represents the high front unrounded vowel [i]. ii represents the long version of the high front unrounded vowel. u represents the high back rounded vowel [u]. uu represents the long version of the high back rounded vowel. + represents the high central unrounded vowel. It is the corresponding barred i,
[], in IPA. ++ represents the long version of the high central unrounded vowel.
7 The ILDP team members all notice a slight difference between the Iquito r and the flap r as defined in IPA. There is an additional frication property (i.e. the airstream coming out of a narrow passage) in the Iquito r. In addition, the Iquito r is pronounced with the tip of the tongue rather than the blade of the tongue.
14

In addition to the graphemes used above, the pitch-accent (also referred to as tone by the ILDP) is also marked on the vowel (e.g. í) except when the vowel is the high central vowel +, in which case, it is marked by an apostrophe ‘’’ preceding the vowel (e.g. ’+). It is noted that analysis of tone in Iquito is a developing project. The examples in the current study do not represent the most current tonal marking.
1.2.4 Features of Local Spanish as Phenomena of Language Contact Local Spanish in the community of San Antonio de Pintuyacu displays striking
differences from the regular Latin American Spanish and Regional Amazonian Spanish, spoken in the city of Iquitos. Regional Amazonian Spanish is structurally the same as the common Latin American Spanish with the addition of regional vocabulary. Local Spanish in the community is quite different, not just in terms of its special vocabulary, but in the grammar as well. This profound difference has presumably been around for at least sixty years. Due to its grammatical difference from the regional and Latin American Spanish, it presents a border case between ‘a dialect of Spanish’ and ‘a creole.’ The current local Spanish in the community could be derived from both the substrate influence of the Iquito grammar and the effect of second language acquisition. At the very least, it presents an interesting case of a language-contact phenomenon. In the following, I discuss the fundamental grammatical characteristics of the Spanish spoken in San Antonio de Pintuyacu.
Tense-Aspect In the use of local Spanish, the perfect form of common Spanish, such as he, has, ha, hemos, han, había, habías and habían, are adopted as the tense distinctions of remoteness in the past and in the perfective sentences, which correspond to the tense
15

distinctions in Iquito. The group of forms he, has, ha, hemos and han is used to indicate events taking place in the recent past and the group of forms había, habías, habíamos and habían is used to indicate the distant past. The ‘perfect’ meaning is lost, as in (a) and (b). The speaker Jaime indicates that the phrase acabar de ‘just’ in the present tense acaba de sounds weird in the community. The people in the community do not use it; they only use the form ha acabado de. Some of them understand acaba de, some of them do not.
(a) Jaime reciencito ha acabado de cocinar. ‘Jaime recently finished cooking.’
(b) Jaime había cocinado. ‘Jaime cooked a long time ago.’
In addition, there is no regular preterit (i.e. perfective past) form in local Spanish, as indicated in the following paradigm (c).
(c) cocinar ‘cook’ cociné ‘cook.1S.preterite’: N/A cocinaste ‘cook.2S.preterite’: N/A cocinó ‘cook.3S.preterite’: N/A cocinaron ‘cook.2P/3P.preterit’: N/A
To indicate perfect meaning, the adverb ya ‘already’ is added together with an explicit temporal reference to indicate the time of the event, as in (d).
(d) Pero yo ya he cocinado en la mañana. ‘But I have already cooked in the morning.’
16

To indicate progressive imperfective situation, the auxiliary estar is used in combination with the progressive form, as in (e).
(e) Ella está cocinando. ‘She is cooking.’
However, there is no perfect progressive in local Spanish as in (f). Instead, a sentence such as (g) or (h) is the acceptable form. This, again, confirms that the form ha, among others, has lost its perfect meaning and is used solely to indicate perfective situations. This phenomenon also corresponds to the Iquito structure in which the perfect progressive is indicated through an adverbial indicating a duration of time in combination with the regular progressive, expressed through the imperfective aspect.
(f) Ella ha estado cocinando por tres horas. ‘She has been cooking for three hours.’: N/A
(g) Ella ya es tres horas lo que está cocinando. ‘She has been cooking for three hours.’ (Literally: She, it is already three hours what she is cooking.)
(h) Ella está cocinando tres horas. ‘She has been cooking for three hours.’ (Literally: She is cooking three hours.)
Corresponding with the fact that there is no preterit form in local Spanish, the copula forms in common Spanish, such as fui, fuiste, fue, fuimos and fueron, do not exist in local Spanish. In addition, era, eras and eran are also not used. The perfective and imperfective uses of the copula are conflated into one expression haber sido. The phrases
17

he sido, has sido, ha sido, hemos sido, han sido are used for situations in the recent past and había sido, habías sido, habíamos sido, habían sido are used for those in the distant past. The present forms of ser, such as soy, eres, es, somos and son are retained in local Spanish. Examples in (i) demonstrate what is discussed above.
(i) Yo soy estudiante. ‘I am a student.’ Yo he sido estudiante antes. ‘I was a student before/earlier.’ Yo había sido estudiante antes. ‘I was a student before (many years ago).’ Yo era estudiante. ‘I was a student.’: N/A Yo fui estudiante. ‘I was a student.’: N/A
The last tense/aspect characteristic of local Spanish is that there is no future conjugation of the verb, only periphrastic expressions, as in (j).
(j) Mañana va a matar una huangana. ‘Tomorrow he is going to kill a peccary.’
Irregular Conjugation One interesting borrowing from common Spanish is the adjectival form muerto ‘dead’ derived from morir ‘die.’ The form muerto is now used in local Spanish in the phrase haber muerto to mean ‘killed.’ The infinitive form of ‘kill’ is still matar. The forms of the present tense are still based on the infinitive form (i.e. mato, matas, mata, matamos and matan); however, the forms of the past tense have changed to he muerto, has muerto, ha muerto, hemos muerto, han muerto, había muerto, habías muerto, habíamos muerto and habían muerto, as in (k).
18

(k) matar ‘kill’ maté ‘kill.1S.preterit’: N/A mataste ‘kill.2S.preterit’: N/A mató ‘kill.3S.preterit’: N/A matado ‘kill.perfect’: N/A ¿Has muerto una huangana? ‘Did you kill a peccary?’ Él ha muerto una huangana. ‘He killed a peccary.’ Había muerto una huangana. ‘He killed a peccary (a long time ago).’
This irregular past tense conjugation of ‘kill’ merges with that of ‘die.’ The only difference is that in the case of ‘die,’ a reflexive se is added, as in (l). This does not indicate a suicidal event. If it were a suicide, the phrase él mismo ‘he himself’ is added to stress this, as in (m).
(l) Mañana ya va morir ese enfermo. ‘Tomorrow this sick person is already going to die.’ Ese enfermo ya se ha muerto ayer. ‘That sick person already died yesterday.’ Ese enfermo se había muerto. ‘That sick person died (a long time ago)’
(m) Ya se ha muerto él mismo. ‘He already killed himself.’
Double Subjunctive8
8 Spanish subjunctive conjugation of verbs is generally formed by changing the vowel height. However, some verbs have irregular conjugation; for example, the subjunctive form of the verb tener ‘have’ is tenga. What happens in the Iquito community is that they further change the vowel height of the irregular conjugation of subjunctive to make the form tengue. I refer to this strategy as ‘double subjunctive.’
19

Local Spanish also displays a phenomenon of double subjunctive, specifically in those already irregular forms, such as tenga derived from tener ‘have.’ Sentence (n) shows the subjunctive conjugation of the verb hablar ‘speak’ and (o) shows the subjunctive conjugation of the irregular verb tener ‘have.’ The phenomenon of the double subjunctive is possibly a remnant of over-generalization from language acquisition.
(n) Espero que hable Iquito. ‘I hope he speaks Iquito.’
(o) Espero que tengue dinero. ‘I hope he has money.’ Espero que tenga dinero. ‘I hope he has money’: N/A
Determiner/Demonstrative Regarding the definite articles el and la, speakers of local Spanish use them only for generic or indefinite unspecific readings. They mostly use un or una for indefinite specific readings and ese/esa and este/esta for definite readings.
(p) No he visto a ese hombre. ‘I did not see that man.’ El hombre está durmiendo. ‘A man is sleeping.’ Un hombre está durmiendo. ‘A (specific) man is sleeping.’
Nominalizer Local Spanish also displays a phenomenon of over-generalization when nominalizing a verb. The nominal form la enseñanza ‘teaching’ is generally replaced by el enseñar and el aprendizaje ‘learning’ by el aprender; the nominal form el professor
20

‘the teacher’ is also expressed through the phrase el enseñador and el estudiante ‘the student’ through el aprendedor.
Other Special Lexical Items There are a few terms that are specifically shared in the community, and perhaps among other indigenous communities as well, but not in the city of Iquitos.
(q) apu ‘tribal leader’: a term that Iquito borrowed from Quechua deverasmente ‘really, indeed’: They also use the phrases en verdad and de veras. ha regresar ‘returned.3S.past’: The speaker Jaime indicates that some people use the unconjugated form regresar ‘to return’ in the phrase ha regresar ‘returned.’
1.3 PREVIOUS LITERATURE ON IQUITO AND ORGANIZATION OF THE DISSERTATION The first language documentation on Iquito is Eastman & Eastman’s (1963) Iquito
Syntax which provides a syntactic sketch using a tagmemic framework. Since 2003, the ILDP has documented several aspects of the grammar, including phonology, verbal morphology, and syntax. Preliminary research and documentation directly related to the TMA system include Beier (2003b) which explores Iquito tense markers, including nonpast tense, recent past tense and distant past tense. She also discusses the basic use of the Imperfective Aspect in Iquito. Lai (2003a) explores Iquito completive and inceptive aspects (which were re-analyzed and renamed as General Perfective Aspect and Momentary Perfective Aspect in this work) and Lai (2005a) proposes to change the label of completive aspect to perfective aspect because, in Iquito, completive aspect only indicates the termination or occurrence of an event and does not indicate the completion
21

of an event. Completion is generally assumed, but can be cancelled if an open9 situation is asserted. Lai (2003b, 2005a) provides a basic understanding of how Iquito tense/aspect and mood interact. These works point out that perfective aspects are generally used in counterfactual situations while Imperfective Aspects are generally used in noncounterfactual situations. It is anticipated that this study will provide a detailed TMA investigation on the basis of previous research on this topic.
The current dissertation is organized as follows. In chapter 2, the pertinent background of the dissertation is discussed, including the theoretical framework, the methodology and the relevant basic constructions of Iquito. In chapter 3, I discuss tense in Iquito, including its morpho-phonology, its semantics and how temporal interpretations are achieved. In addition, I discuss the symmetric nature of temporal adverbials in Iquito and how a day is divided in the use of the language. In chapter 4, I discuss grammatical mood in Iquito, including the structural characteristics and the semantic contexts in which it is used. In addition, I also discuss constructions of negation, conditionals, desideratives, optatives, CF wishes, imperatives and jussives, specifically based on structural comparison of them with the mood constructions. In chapter 5, I discuss grammatical viewpoint aspects in Iquito, including their morpho-phonology and their semantics. In chapter 6, I discuss the realization of situation types in Iquito. In chapter 7, I discuss the temporal system in the discourse context and discourse modes discovered therein. Appendix 1 includes the discussion of event quantification in derivational morphology. Appendix 2 contains three example texts, including one traditional tale, one narrative, and one conversational text.

Chapter 2: Pertinent Background
2.1 THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK The analysis of the Iquito temporal system in this dissertation assumes Smith’s
(1997) two-component theory on aspectual systems, as well as her framework on discourse modes (2003) and tense and temporal interpretation (1997, 2005). Grammatical mood is not within the scope of her theory; however, in Iquito it contributes to the temporal interpretation of the sentence in certain cases and, therefore, is included in this dissertation. This section gives an overview of the assumed framework on tense (§2.1.1), viewpoint aspect (§2.1.2), situation aspect (§2.1.3), and discourse mode (§2.1.4), which are discussed in detail in respective chapters later in this dissertation. §2.1.5 introduces the notational conventions used in this study.
2.1.1 Tense and Temporal Interpretation As stated in Smith (1997: 97), “Temporal location and aspect are complementary
temporal systems. The former locates a situation in time, while the latter specifies the internal temporal structure of the situation.” Temporal information, including tense and explicit temporal adverbials, of a sentence contributes to temporal interpretation, which determines and locates a situation in time. The term ‘situation,’ following Smith’s use, includes states and events (i.e. Activities, Accomplishments, Achievements and Semelfactives). Therefore, States, Activities, Accomplishments, Achievements and Semelfactives are five types of ‘situation aspects,’ also termed ‘situation types.’ The term ‘situation’ is used on both the basic level (i.e. verbal constellation) and the derived level (i.e. shifted by grammatical aspects or explicit adverbials). Situation aspect is conveyed
23

by the verb constellation, including the verb and its arguments; grammatical aspect, also termed viewpoint aspect, is conveyed by one (or more) grammatical morphemes. ‘Eventuality’ is another term frequently encountered in Smith’s work, especially on discourse modes as a type of entity; it is, in general, equivalent to the term ‘situation’ used for the derived level.
Temporal interpretation indicates where a situation is temporally located in relation to reference time (frequently abbreviated as RT in this study), which may be the same as speech time (abbreviated as SpT) or some other reference point. Temporal interpretation is directly attained from tense in tensed languages, but is indirectly inferred, if there are no explicit temporal adverbials, from the semantic information conveyed by aspects and the pragmatic principles of their interpretation. Smith defines the tense category as an obligatory morpheme in the sentence. To temporally locate a situation, we need three times—SpT (the time of utterance), RT (the temporal perspective of the presentation), and SitT (the time a situation holds or occurs)—and two relations— the relation between SpT and RT, and that between RT and SitT. The three times and two relations are both encoded by tense; therefore, temporal interpretation is direct in tensed languages. It is noted that in simple sentences, SpT is the orientation point; in complex sentences, RT may serve as a secondary orientation point.
In tenseless languages, temporal interpretation relies on the semantic information of aspects, and pragmatic principles and inference rules. Viewpoint aspects semantically convey boundedness by presenting the situation in part or in its entirety. Boundedness information is crucial in determining the relationship between the situation and SitT. Bounded events occur within the SitT interval and unbounded events or states overlap the SitT interval. Pragmatic principles for inference of temporal interpretation in tenseless languages include the following, from Smith (2005):
24

A. The Deictic Principle Speech Time is the central orientation point for language. The Present time is located at Speech Time; the Past precedes it, the Future follows.
B. The Bounded Event Constraint Bounded situations may not be located in the Present.
C. The Simplicity Principle Choose the interpretation that requires least information added or inferred.
Following the principle above, in tenseless languages which have grammatical aspects, a perfective sentence is by default inferred as the past unless additional information indicates otherwise. Likewise, an imperfective sentence is by default inferred as the present. The above three principles constrain temporal interpretation in tensed languages and guide the default pattern of temporal interpretation in tenseless languages. For a tenseless language that does not have grammatical aspects, boundedness is further inferred from the situation aspect. Situation aspects are categorized in terms of three temporal features: dynamism, duration, and telicity. Telic and non-durative events are intrinsically bounded. Atelic and durative events are unbounded.
In independent sentences of tensed languages, the deictic pattern is the default pattern of tense, whose interpretation is anchored to SpT. However, in stretches of sentences, the interpretation tense might be anchored to the previous discourse, illustrating a continuity and an anaphoric pattern. This is introduced in §2.1.4 and discussed in detail in §7. A detailed overview of the theory and the details of tense and temporal interpretation in Iquito are discussed in §3.
25

2.1.2 Viewpoint Aspect Viewpoint aspects, expressed through grammatical morphemes, semantically
convey boundedness information of a situation in the sentence. Imperfective aspect presents part of a situation, an unbounded situation with ‘no information’ on the initial and final endpoints (also termed as the endpoints being ‘invisible’); this is also often addressed as an ‘open reading’ of a situation or an ‘open situation.’ The term ‘open’ therefore is equivalent to ‘unbounded’ while the term ‘closed’ is equivalent to ‘bounded.’ Bounded events occur within the SitT interval and unbounded events or states overlap the SitT interval. Perfective aspect presents a situation in its entirety, a bounded situation ‘including’ the initial and final endpoints (also termed as the endpoints being ‘visible’); this is often addressed as a ‘closed reading’ or a ‘closed situation.’ There are different types of closure (i.e. closed readings), including completion and termination. The above are the general unmarked properties of viewpoint aspects. However, viewpoint aspects interact with situation aspects; since States do not contain endpoints, properties of perfective aspect might not apply. Details on how much information viewpoint aspects span and present also differ from language to language. Smith proposes a third main type of aspect, Neutral aspect, which applies to languages with an unmarked aspect, allowing either a closed or an open reading. The terms ‘viewpoint aspect’ and ‘grammatical aspect’ are used interchangeably throughout the dissertation.
The information conveyed by linguistic forms of viewpoint aspect is its semantic meaning, which cannot be cancelled. Viewpoint aspects span all or part of a situation. The information a viewpoint presents is affected by the structure of the situation. This leads us to the point that aspectual viewpoints are independent of situation types as assumed in the two-component theory. The main semantic distinction among aspectual viewpoints is how much of a situation they make visible. Perfective viewpoints focus a
26

situation as a whole and include endpoints while imperfective viewpoints focus an interval and exclude endpoints. The evidence for the semantic meanings of aspectual viewpoints comes from semantic tests: conjunctions and questions. Conjunction is based on the compatibility of two assertions. Open situations are compatible with assertions that the situation continues or terminates without completion, which means the imperfective viewpoint does not entail the completion of the situation and, hence, the final endpoint of the event is not visible. Closed situations, on the other hand, are not compatible with assertions that the situation continues or terminates without completion, which means the perfective viewpoint entails the completion of the situation and, hence, the final endpoint of the event is visible. Crosslinguistically, there are different manifestations of perfective aspects; some languages have terminative closure instead of completive closure and some languages include a post stage, etc. Before- and after- clauses are also useful to test if the final endpoint of a situation is semantically visible. When- clauses can distinguish the imperfective viewpoint from others because a sequential reading would not be available for it. Questions also function as tests to discover the semantic meaning of a sentence: a closed situation is not compatible with a question which asks about its continuation.
The perfective viewpoint presents an entire situation and, therefore, is incompatible with an assertion that the event continued, as indicated in (r). It is closed informationally as an unmarked perfective viewpoint. As such, prototypically it does not apply to stative situations. The English perfective viewpoint conveys termination or completion depending on situation types. The Chinese perfective viewpoint conveys termination for all non-stative events. The Russian perfective requires the boundary of events to be specifically indicated. Regarding the parameter of statives and the perfective viewpoint, the French perfective applies to statives because the perfective includes changes into and out of a state; the English perfective presents open stative situations
27

because it does not include endpoints of States; perfectives in Russian, Mandarin Chinese, and Navajo do not apply to States at all, except when the verb constellations undergo a shift in situation type. The marked perfective viewpoint includes the Chinese guo which requires a discontinuity in situation and is evident in conjunction tests.
(r) #Mary walked to school and she’s still walking. (Smith, 1997: 64)
The imperfective viewpoint presents internal stages of a situation excluding its endpoints. Marked imperfective viewpoints span the preliminary stages of events or the resultant stages of telic events. Imperfective viewpoint can be tested by the conjunction test, when- and after- clauses. After- clauses require sequentiality and hence an open situation in the main clauses would be incompatible, as in (s). When transitivity and morphological factors allow, the stages which are focused by imperfective viewpoints may be ambiguous (i.e. an eventive or resultative reading). The neutral viewpoint is open but not unlimited and it allows both open and closed readings, with its temporal schema including the initial endpoint and at least one stage of the event.
(s) ?/* John was singing after Mary broke the glass. (Smith 1997: 65) 10
Viewpoint aspect is independent of situation aspect. For example, imperfective viewpoints may focus the preliminary or resultant stages of a situation, in which case the schemata of a situation and the span of the viewpoint do not coincide. In addition, the Chinese -guo perfective viewpoint requires the span to include the situation and also a

post-final stage which cannot be said to be dependent on the situation schema. As such, one crucial point is not to confuse perfectivity with telicity. Perfectivity indicates the boundedness of the situation while telicity concerns the natural final endpoint, in terms of a temporal bound as well as an outcome. For example, the sentence I talked contains an atelic event in the perfective aspect, indicating an event with an arbitrary final endpoint. A detailed overview of the theory and details of viewpoint aspects in Iquito are discussed in §5.
2.1.3 Situation Aspect11 Smith recognizes five situation types: States, Activities, Accomplishments,
Achievements and Semelfactives. Situation aspect, as one of the two components in the aspectual system, is conveyed through the verb and its arguments, including obligatory adverbials, at the basic level and is coerced (i.e. as shifts of situation types) by nonobligatory adverbials, viewpoint aspects, or sometimes even tense (i.e. English present tense) at the derived level. A given situation type, as a covert linguistic category, is indirectly grammaticized in a language if the verb constellations have a consistent set of linguistic properties. Intrinsic temporal features which distinguish the five situation types are based in human perceptual/cognitive abilities and can be described in terms of dynamism, duration and telicity. While the five situation types hold across languages, linguistic correlates of the distinction vary from language to language. Three features, [static/dynamic], [telic/atelic] and [durative/instantaneous] represent the properties of the five situation types. In addition, the mereological concept (i.e. quantized vs. cumulative events) of the analogy between things and events is also relevant.
11 In the typological literature, ‘situation aspect’ is usually called ‘Aktionsart.’ However, there is a distinction in that ‘Aktionsart’ generally applies to verbs while ‘situation aspect’ applies to verbal constellations which include verbs and the obligatory arguments and adverbials.
29

The Activity situation type has the temporal features of [+dynamic], [-telic], and [+durative]. The situation type value of Activity shifts to Accomplishment when accompanied by a bounding adverbial. There are two basic types of Activity: one consists of a cumulative, unlimited, event (i.e. an atelic verb with compatible complements, such as laugh, talk, push a cart, etc.), while the other consists of numerous internal stages (i.e. a telic verb with a mass NP complement, such as eat cherries).
The Accomplishment situation type has the temporal features of [+dynamic], [+telic] and [+durative] and consists of a process and an outcome or a change of state. The relationship between the process and the outcome/result of the Accomplishment situation type is well known as non-detachability. Telic events can be classified by the type of result they bring about: affected object (e.g. break a pot), constructed object (e.g. write a letter), consumed object (e.g. eat an apple), affected experiencer (e.g. entertain Mary), and path-goal (e.g. walk to the park). Accomplishments derived from Activities (e.g. walk for 3 hours) do not have the feature of change of state as the outcome.
Semelfactives are single-stage events with no outcome/result, with the temporal features of [-dynamic], [-durative] and [-telic] (e.g. cough). Semelfactives with durative adverbials (e.g. cough for a day) are interpreted as derived multiple-event Activities.
The Achievement situation type is instantaneous and has a change of state (e.g. win). Its temporal features are [+dynamic], [-durative] and [+telic]. Derived Achievement sentences (e.g. finish running, suddenly know) in English appear with super-lexical verbs, such as start and finish, or adverbials.
States consist of an undifferentiated period with internal structure (e.g. believe). Their temporal features are [-dynamic], [+durative] and [-telic]. Derived Statives (e.g. tigers eat meat and always play piano) include generic predication and habitual sentences. English event sentences with present tense and perfective viewpoint must be
30

taken as habituals. Across languages, Statives differ in compatibility with the kind of aspectual viewpoint. Some languages cannot combine Statives with perfective viewpoint; some cannot combine Statives with progressive viewpoint. The notational conventions and how temporal schemata of situation aspect and viewpoint aspect combine to yield aspectual interpretations are discussed in §2.1.5. A detailed overview of the theory and the details of situation aspects in Iquito are discussed in §6.
2.1.4 Discourse Mode Smith (2003) recognizes five discourse modes at the level of local text structure,
the level of passage: Narrative, Description, Report, Information and Argument. They are characterized in terms of types of text organization (i.e. temporal, atemporal), of entities (i.e. eventualities, general statives, abstract entities), of progression (i.e. temporal, spatial, metaphorical), and of patterns of tense interpretation (i.e. deictic, continuity, anaphoric). All of the above features are conveyed through linguistic correlates.
Narrative, Description and Report are temporal modes and convey, respectively, continuity, anaphoric, and deictic patterns of tense. That is to say, Reference Time (RT) in Narrative and Description is interpreted depending on the preceding discourse: it advances with each bounded event in Narrative and does not advance temporally in Description. The text of Description progresses spatially from one part of the scene to another; time is static in Description. RT and temporal advancement in Report depend on tense and deictic temporal adverbials, both related to Speech Time (SpT). Tense in Information and Argument is deictic as it anchors to SpT. However, Information and Argument are atemporal, involving situations which cannot be located in time in the real world. Text in Information and Argument progresses in the metaphorical domain as the Primary Referent of the text metaphorically moves or changes. Summarizing the above
31

discussion, tense in independent/simple sentences conveys deixis; however, contextual interpretation of tense, as well as aspect, varies according to different discourse modes. Regarding situation entities in discourse modes, Narrative, Report and Description, in general, consist of eventualities (i.e. specific events and states), while Information and Argument generally consist of general statives (i.e. generic and generalizing sentences) and abstract entities (i.e. facts and propositions). Besides text organization, progression, patterns of tense interpretation and situation entities, discourse modes also differ in the subjectivity they express. In Report and Argument, the author is usually strongly present while in Narrative, Description, and Information it is the opposite. All the above features are conveyed through linguistic correlates: the choice and the interpretation of tense and aspect, deixis shift of tense, pronoun, and space, temporal and spatial adverbials, and clause structure, among others.
A detailed overview of the theory and the details of discourse modes in Iquito are discussed in §7.
2.1.5 Notational Conventions Throughout the dissertation, the following notational conventions are used in
discussing temporal properties and relations, and in presenting diagrams and temporal schemata. The conventions basically follow and extend those laid out in Smith (1997:23). In discussing temporal properties of situation aspect, the types of situation (i.e. event or state) are characterized in terms of their duration and whether they consist of successive internal stages, their initial and final endpoints, whether the final endpoint is natural or arbitrary, and the outcome of the event. In discussing temporal properties of viewpoint aspect, the span of a situation the aspect makes visible is characterized in terms of initial and finial endpoints, internal stages and preliminary and post stages. In discussing
32

temporal relations of tense, the three times (i.e. SitT, SpT and RT) are related in terms of the overlapping, preceding or following relationship of their time points/intervals. In discussing temporal properties of a given discourse mode, the RT of the discourse context is characterized whether it is deictically related to SpT or anaphorically related to the previous discourse. The underlying assumption is a timeline, with the time flowing from the left to the right. Below is a list of conventions with explanations used in the current dissertation. Where necessary, annotations may be added as subscript text next to the conventions listed here.

In the following, we see how aspectual interpretation is yielded through the composite information of situation aspect and viewpoint aspect, using the sentence Mary was walking to school as an example (based on Smith 1997: 63). The event of [Mary walk to school] is an Accomplishment event, which is dynamic with successive stages, durative, and with a natural endpoint. The temporal schema is as follows:

I…….FNat R

The sentence contains an imperfective aspect -ing, which generally focuses on the internal stages of an event, schematized as follows:
34

I…///////…F
The composite temporal schema of the event is, therefore, as follows, expressing a durative telic event with no information regarding the initial and final endpoints as the imperfective aspect does not make such information available.
I…///////…FNat R
The tense in the sentence is past tense, expressing a situation with reference in the past. The temporal relations in the sentence are as follows: RT precedes SpT which is the present moment; SitT is the same as the RT and both of them precede SpT.
RT < SpT SitT = RT
Besides the above-mentioned notational conventions, I use the title case (e.g. Past) to indicate the grammatical tense and aspects in Iquito and the lowercase (e.g. past) to indicate time and aspects in general.
2.2 METHODOLOGY This dissertation presents typological phenomena of TMA systems from the
literature and provides the Iquito data and analysis as a comparison to highlight the language-specific properties and contribute to an overall understanding of TMA systems of human languages. The analysis assumes Carlota Smith’s framework, as discussed
35

above in §2.1. In this section, the collection of the data and the basic methodology, including analytical criteria and tests, of how one determines the aspectual meanings in question, are discussed.
Prior to the dissertation fieldwork in 2006 (May-December), I had already collected some narrative stories, in addition to abundant texts collected by other ILDP members and some elicited examples relevant for the study of the Iquito temporal system. The data were obtained primarily during my own summer field research done in 2003 and 2005, and from the text collection of the ILDP. I also had written my qualifying paper for doctoral candidacy, entitled Fundamental Aspects of the Iquito Language, on six major components of Iquito grammar: 1) A General Introduction to Tense and Aspect, 2) Basic Word Order, 3) Negation, 4) Coordination, 5) Complement Clauses and 6) Conditional Clauses. However, the study of tense and aspect at that point was still preliminary and did not incorporate large-scale data collection or data obtained through semantic tests.
In pursuit of a thorough and systematic corpus, I adopted Dahl’s (1985, 2000) methods, which use questionnaires as an essential approach to data collection, in May 2006, when I began my dissertation research. Among the questionnaires that I used were Dahl’s (1985) “TMA Questionnaire,” Dahl’s (2000) “The Future Time Reference Questionnaire,” “The Perfect Questionnaire” and “Questionnaire on the Progressive Aspect.” I adapted and contextualized the questions in these questionnaires according to specific cultural traditions to prevent speakers from directly translating the sentences. After collecting the data, and in order to progress towards an analysis, I worked with Iquito consultants, using the criteria and suggested semantic tests provided in Smith (1997), which proposes certain linguistic correlates for the determination of aspects and situation types and their parameters. I also incorporated comments obtained through
36

personal communication with Carlota Smith during the dissertation field period for the determination of tense and its RT span. Tense locates the event in time, Aspect characterizes the internal temporal structure of the event, and Mood describes the actuality of the event (Chung & Timberlake, 1985). The parallels between tense-aspect and mood are that tense and aspect provide information with respect to reference time while mood provides information with respect to the reference world. Therefore, in analyzing mood, I incorporate Chung and Timberlake’s essential idea which embraces a unified account of TMA. I focus on the distinctions of grammatical mood (i.e. realis vs. irrealis) made by phonological, morphological and syntactic means and how tense, aspect and mood interact with each other. Indeed, in Iquito, it is mood as well as aspect that together determine temporal interpretations in the context of a certain tense, Extended Current Tense, even though Iquito is a tensed language. In addition to the elicited data, I also collected conversational texts and considered the analysis of the temporal system in the contextual use of Iquito oral texts. The use of the Iquito dictionary of the ILDP,12 with around 7000 entries, was essential in the part of the analysis on lexicalized use of event quantification (Appendix 1).
The data collected during my 2006 dissertation fieldwork consists of around 130 hours of recordings, including texts, elicitation and consultation (i.e. discussion of elicitation, questions, contexts, and texts). The content of texts and elicitation was transcribed, analyzed and translated into English as presented in this dissertation. The consultation part, however, is in Spanish and, therefore, was not transcribed. For the analysis of text, I transcribed in 3-second intervals for around 5 minutes of texts, and then I had consultation sessions with the speakers for the translation and analysis; I repeated
12 To assist in the task of building the dictionary, I made word lists that included example sentences, definition, and function of the word as I encountered a new lexical item, and I handed the lists over to the person in charge, Lev D. Michael. He then would enter these words into the SHOEBOX database. The ILDP dictionary has been useful and I would like to acknowledge Lev’s extensive work on the dictionary.
37

this process until the entire text was done; I went over the translated and transcribed texts with a few other speakers for other analysis-related opinions. The elicitation, generally based on the above-mentioned questionnaires and modified sentences and questions from the texts, and the consultation sessions, usually went together, so I transcribed as I asked the questions. The estimated transcribed words number around 8000 in Source Language. For the transcribed and annotated data, I use a 3-tier convention, including the first line in segmentized texts, second line as gloss (i.e. morpheme translation and abbreviated grammatical function), and the third line as free translation. One side note about the free translations for the example sentences in this dissertation is that they represent the fruit of quite nuanced discussions with the consultants. The analytical pertinence is the concern here. The first free translation a consultant would give might be so fully-packed with discourse information, just like any sentence one would utter in a daily conversational context, that it includes additional interpretations or information which cannot be obtained from the sentence itself and is not expressed through the temporal/aspectual meanings of the morphemes under discussion. I would discuss the translation quite intensively with the consultants to peel off the added interpretation and information not yielded from the sentence itself and I would request them to give an as simple as possible a translation. Through routine sessions and training, they could generally give the simplest translation without adding unnecessary context, but they also usually commented that the translation is correct but too simple, and is not a rhetorically beautiful and complicated sentence. In addition, one difficulty exists in the line of segmentized texts. The tone in Iquito operates on different levels and so it was the most inconsistent part of my transcription, although fortunately the tone does not affect the semantic and syntactic analysis at all.
38

In the following, I briefly discuss the precise analytical criteria (i.e. linguistic correlates) and the semantic tests I employ in determining the various temporal and aspectual meanings in question. The information introduced here should be combined with the detailed explanations of the theoretical background and tests outlined in §2.1 and in respective chapters and sections of different TMA categories. Smith defines the tense category as an obligatory morpheme in the sentence. Temporal interpretation is directly attained from tense in tensed languages. Therefore, the first criterion of determining whether a morpheme in question is a tense is its obligatory status in a finite sentence. If it is optional, most likely13 it is a temporal adverb. If a morpheme is truly a tense category, even if a temporal adverb, such as ‘yesterday,’ which explicitly indicates RT, appears, the tense, such as the past tense in English, is still required in the sentence and the lack of such a tense would result in ungrammaticality. The second criterion I propose is the compatibility of such a morpheme and temporal adverbials; this criterion also serves to determine the temporal meaning of a tense morpheme. If a morpheme yields a past interpretation, it could be a past tense or a perfective—or even an imperfective—aspect. In tenseless languages which have grammatical aspects, a perfective sentence is by default inferred as the past and an imperfective sentence is by default inferred as the present unless additional information indicates otherwise. Therefore, a perfective aspect can be combined with a future adverbial while a past tense cannot be combined with a future adverbial. In other words, if the morpheme which supposedly yields a past interpretation can be combined with a future adverbial, chances are that it is a perfective aspect instead of a past tense. Likewise, if a morpheme which supposedly yields a present interpretation can be freely combined with a past adverbial or a future adverbial, chances
13 Smith includes three types, in terms of tense, of languages in the world: tensed languages, tenseless languages, and mixed-temporal languages. Mixed-temporal languages (e.g. Navajo) have morphemes that function like a tense, but are not always required in a given finite sentence.
39

are that it is an imperfective aspect instead of a present tense. If after all these tests, one obligatory morpheme, for example, can only be used in a past context and yields a perfective interpretation, one might be able to preliminarily argue that such a morpheme encodes both past tense and perfective aspect meanings. To determine the precise temporal meanings of tense morphemes, one can work out a range of time to test; this is especially important for a language which has a remoteness distinction, such as Iquito. For example, recent past tense cannot be combined with future, present, immediate past, or distant past adverbials. For a complete discussion, please combine this paragraph with §2.1.1 and §3.
Viewpoint aspect, also often termed as grammatical aspect, encodes boundedness information of a situation (i.e. presenting all or part of a situation) in the sentence. I will discuss imperfective and perfective aspects here as they are the most common ones. The general unmarked properties of aspects are as follows. Imperfective aspect presents an unbounded situation with no information on the initial and final endpoints (also termed as the endpoints being ‘invisible’ in the literature); this is also often addressed as an ‘open reading’ of a situation or an ‘open situation.’ Perfective aspect presents a situation in its entirety, a bounded situation including the initial and final endpoints (also termed as the endpoints being ‘visible’); this is often addressed as a ‘closed reading’ or a ‘closed situation.’ Crosslinguistically, individual languages might have different types of closure; some languages have terminative closure instead of completive closure and some languages include a post stage. It is noted that a completed event in the past might be presented using an imperfective aspect or a perfective aspect. Therefore, the use of aspect is a matter of aspectual choice by speakers, depending on how they prefer to present a situation; the main semantic distinction among aspectual viewpoints is how much of a situation they make visible. If a speaker wants to focus on part of a situation, he might
40

choose an imperfective aspect which makes only part of a situation visible and provides no information on either endpoint. To determine the meanings of viewpoint aspects, conjunctions (i.e. compatibility of two assertions) and questions are the two most important tests. Before-, after- and when- clauses are also useful tests. The main principles are that open situations, presented by an imperfective aspect, are compatible with assertions that the situation continues or terminates without completion and that closed situations, presented by a perfective aspect, are not compatible with assertions that the situation continues or terminates without completion. For a complete discussion, please combine this paragraph with §2.1.2 and §5.
Situation aspect, often used interchangeably with the term ‘situation type,’ at a basic level, is conveyed through the verb and its arguments, including obligatory adverbials. When combined with non-obligatory adverbials, viewpoint aspects, or sometimes even tense (i.e. English present tense), one situation type might be coerced (i.e. as shifts of situation types) into another situation type at the derived level. Situation type is a covert linguistic category, which means that it is not directly marked through a morpheme, but indirectly grammaticized if the verb constellations have a consistent set of linguistic properties/correlates. Smith recognizes five situation types: States, Activities, Accomplishments, Achievements and Semelfactives. Three features, [static/dynamic], [telic/atelic] and [durative/instantaneous] represent the properties of the five situation types.
The Activity situation type has the temporal features of [+dynamic], [-telic] and [+durative], and is an event with dynamic stages that goes on for an interval of time without an outcome, therefore without a natural endpoint. Due to their [+dynamic] value, they can appear in imperative constructions, as the complement of the verb ‘order,’ and with volitional adverbials. Due to its [-telic] value, imperfective Activity sentences entail
41

perfective Activity sentences, are compatible with a sentence which asserts the continuation of a situation, but are incompatible with a sentence which asserts that the event did not take place. Also due to its [-telic] value, Activity shifts to a derived Accomplishment when used with a bounding adverbial. Due to its [+durative] value, when combined with punctual adverbials, inceptive readings are rendered.
The Accomplishment situation type has the temporal features of [+dynamic], [+telic] and [+durative] and consists of a process and an outcome or a change of state. Due to its [+telic] value, imperfective Accomplishment sentences, unlike Activity sentences, generally do not entail perfective Accomplishment sentences, although there is crosslinguistic difference for this criterion. In addition, a sentence which asserts the completion of an event is incompatible with a sentence which asserts an open situation. Due to its [+durative] value, imperfective Accomplishments can combine with simple durative adverbials. However, due to its [+telic] and [+durative] value, it is odd to combine perfective Accomplishments with simple durative adverbials. Due to their [+dynamic] value, they can appear in imperative constructions, as the complement of the verb ‘order,’ and with volitional adverbials.
The Achievement situation type has the temporal features of [+dynamic], [durative], [+telic], and is a single-stage event that results in a change of state. Due to its [durative] value, imperfective Achievement sentences focus on the preliminary stage of an event and do not entail perfective Achievement sentences. They combine naturally with punctual adverbials, which do not trigger inceptive readings of events but represent the actual occurrence of the events. Achievements are intrinsically bounded and have natural endpoints (i.e. [+telic]). A sentence which asserts the culmination of an Achievement is incompatible with a sentence which asserts an open situation. Because Achievements are instantaneous, they are not compatible with simple durative adverbials. If combined with
42

durative adverbials, the interpretation would be forced to focus on the preliminary stage of the event; such a sentence then is compatible with another clause asserting an open situation. Due to their [+dynamic] value, they can appear in imperative constructions, as the complement of the verb ‘order,’ and with volitional adverbials.
Semelfactives are single-stage events with no outcome or result, with the temporal features of [+dynamic], [-durative] and [-telic]. Due to their [+dynamic] value, they generally can appear in imperative constructions, as the complement of the verb ‘order,’ and with volitional adverbials. Although sometimes this might be pragmatically odd, it is grammatical. Due to its [-durative] value, when appearing with punctual adverbs, Semelfactives are interpreted as occurring once. Semelfactives with durative adverbials and/or an imperfective aspect are interpreted as multiple-event (derived) Activities. Due to their [-telic] value, imperfective Semelfactive sentences entail perfective Semelfactive sentences, are compatible with a sentence which asserts the continuation of a situation, but are incompatible with a sentence which asserts that the event did not take place.
The Stative situation type (also referred to as ‘State’) includes an undifferentiated (i.e. without internal structure) period of time (i.e. a moment, the minimal duration, or an interval), during which it obtains, with the temporal features of [-dynamic], [+durative], [-telic]. Due to its [-dynamic] value, they generally cannot appear in imperative constructions, neither as the complement of the verb ‘order,’ nor with volitional adverbials. As Statives do not differentiate within the period they cover, they are odd with indirect durative adverbials, such as slowly and quickly, unless the adverbials refer to the coming about of states. Due to its [+durative] value, Statives are compatible with adverbials of simple duration. When appearing with punctual adverbs, inceptive readings are triggered. Derived Statives are triggered by frequency adverbials combining with non-statives. Across languages, Statives differ in terms of compatibility with given kinds
43

of aspectual viewpoint. Some languages cannot combine Statives with the perfective viewpoint; some cannot combine Statives with progressive viewpoint. For a complete discussion on the methodology of situation type, please combine this section with §2.1.3 and §6.
2.3 IQUITO BASIC CONSTRUCTIONS This section provides an overview of basic constructions in Iquito, especially
those relevant to the analysis and examples in this dissertation. It is organized in five subsections: basic word order (§2.3.1), negation (§2.3.2), coordination (§2.3.3), whenclauses and conditional constructions (§2.3.4), and basic verbal morphology and a general introduction to tense, mood and aspect (§2.3.5). The basic word order in Iquito is SVO. There are three major types of negation for constructions with lexical verbs, locative and existential constructions, and imperatives. The negation section in §2.3.2 demonstrates all three types of negation while §4.3 focuses on the sentential structure of the negation of lexical verbs and its interaction with grammatical mood. There are three types of coordination in Iquito: conjunction, disjunction and adversative conjunction. Conjunction and disjunction are discussed as they are more relevant for the semantic tests than is adversative conjunction. The section on when- clauses and conditional constructions is included because throughout the dissertation these two constructions are often used. When- clauses are especially used for semantic tests; conditional clauses are discussed in detail in §4.4, as part of the analysis of mood. Finally, a section that introduces verbal morphology and the basic temporal system is presented.
44

2.3.1 Basic Word Order This section discusses and defines the basic word order of Iquito. The discussion
of basic word order here concerns only the surface word order. It does not deal with theoretical assumptions concerning the underlying word order from which the surface word order is derived. The study of basic word order is based on the assumption that there is always one basic word order in all languages which is syntactically defined by the relative order among principal constituents. This assumption generally stands except in the case where the word order of the language is free, is pragmatically constrained or defined rather than syntactically based, or the appearance of both constituents (i.e. grammatical subject and object) in a clause is rare, in which case, defining any basic word order for such languages could be forced to some extent. However, as Mithun (1987) points out, “for languages with relatively rigid, syntactically defined surface word order, the establishment of this order at the outset has obvious utility. The description of rarer, morphologically and pragmatically marked alternative orders as the result of the movement of constituents out of their normal position is mechanically simple.” The basic word order of a language refers to the relative order among principal constituents in one clause. The principal constituents of a transitive clause include subject, verb and object. Many languages, although not allowing free word order, allow more than one possible word order. In Iquito, this is also the case. However, a sentence with basic word order is characterized as being least specific and least marked, morphologically as well as pragmatically, and although frequency of use is not a necessary part of the definition of basic word order, in Iquito the most common word order is in fact the basic word order. This section considers transitive and non-topicalized sentences. Lai (2006) includes examples of all possible variants which might influence, crosslinguistically, the placement of nominal phrases, including animacy, definiteness and the weight of the
45

phrase, e.g. full phrases vs. pronouns. I argue that the basic word order in Iquito is SVO instead of SOV and that animacy, definiteness and the phrase weight play no role in deciding the basic word order for Iquito. The following is a table to illustrate all wordorder variations in a finite clause with one lexical verb.

In a more detailed study of word order in Lai (2006), I take into consideration the definiteness, animacy, and the weight of the nominal phrases and investigate seven different categories of subject as well as object. The seven categories include ‘inanimate indefinite,’ ‘inanimate definite,’ ‘animate indefinite,’ ‘animate definite,’ ‘personal indefinite,’ ‘personal definite’ and ‘proper name.’ These seven different categories, applying to the subject and object, generate forty-nine different expressions.

the study concludes that animacy, definiteness and phrase weight do not operate on the pattern of word order in simple transitive clauses and that the basic word order of Iquito is SVO. In deciding basic word order, this chapter considers sentences containing the following characteristics: independent transitive clause, affirmative, realis mood and active voice. In addition, the subject and the object have to be expressed and represented in complete and full nominal phrases, for example, those including nouns as opposed to pronouns. In Iquito, there is no agreement information (e.g. person, number, gender, class, etc.) of grammatical arguments marking on the verb, and the alignment system, based on word order, exhibits an accusative pattern. It is noted that although pronouns in Iquito are not agreement inflection markers, they were excluded from the preliminary stage of investigation and the following examples do not contain them. A sentence with the basic word order is shown as in (1). As can be seen, the relative order among the principal constituents in the clause is SVO.

(1) Aási picuu-Ø-cura

iíta-ca.

rain wet-GNR.PFV-RPST house-PL

The rain wet the houses (yesterday15).

In Iquito, word order conveys grammatical mood: SVX (realis mood) and SXV (irrealis mood). Note that SOV is one of the varieties of SXV orders detailed below. Irrealis mood is characterized as allowing an intervening element between the subject and the verb in the X position. A variety of elements could appear in the X position, including grammatical object and adverbs, among others, as detailed in §4.2. This section focuses

47

on defining the basic word order as SVO. I argue in the following that SXV word order is actually highly marked and that SVO is the true basic one.
Consider first the following two sentences. In (2), we can see that the subject begins the sentence and the object follows the verb, displaying an SVO pattern. In (3), the subject and the object are attached together at the beginning of the sentence, displaying an SOV pattern. Note that pronoun clitics, which are not agreement markers, are not obligatory if a nominal phrase is used as subject or object.

(2) Nu=niqui-qui-Ø

3S=see-GNR.PFV-EC 3S

He/she saw him/her (today16).

(3) Nu=nu=niqui-r++-Ø. 3S=3S=see-MMT.PFV-EC He/she will see him/her (tomorrow).

In the above examples, both subject and object are pronouns.17 Two additional sentences using full noun phrases as the subject and the object are shown below to demonstrate that word order patterns remain the same regardless of types of constituents. Example (4) with a nominal subject and object shows the SVO pattern, and example (5) with a nominal subject and object shows the SOV pattern.

(4) Aási picuu-Ø-Ø

iíta-ca.

16 The Extended Current Tense gives an RT frame from the day of SpT extending into the infinite future. The precise temporal interpretation is based on the combination of aspect and mood morphology. 17 It is noted that Iquito does not have agreement inflections on the verb.
48

rain wet-GNR.PFV-EC house-PL The rain wet the houses (today).
(5) Aási iíta-ca picuu-r++-Ø. rain house-PL wet-MMT.PFV-EC The rain will wet the houses (tomorrow).
So far, both SVO and SOV word orders seem to be unmarked in the sentences in the Extended Current Tense. However, the following discussion shows that SXV word order is actually highly marked in all other environments.
In the past-tense environment, SVO word order maintains the same kinds of morphological markings, while SOV word order cannot appear with only tense-aspect information as demonstrated above in (3) and (5), but has to be accompanied by either counterfactual or hypothetical morphemes.18 As can be seen in (1) above, SVO word order in the past-tense environment only changes its tense morpheme and so still has the same kinds of morphological markings. However, SXV word order in the past context can only be used in conditional and counterfactual constructions and has to be accompanied by either the non-assertive hypothetical morpheme or the counterfactual morpheme. It cannot be used with just tense-aspect information. Example (6) is a case with a counterfactual morpheme. As can be seen, the counterfactual morpheme -t++ and indirect O nu ‘3S’ are inserted between S and V, providing evidence to support the claim that SXV, with intervening elements between S and V, is a marked word order.
(6) Caa quia=t++=nu-mit++-Ø-cura cacaraaja naaqui, nu=t++=sap+-Ø-cura.

NEG 2S=CF=3S-give-PFV-RPST hen egg 3S=CF=cry-PFV-RPST If you did not give him eggs, he would have cried.

The possible positions of adverbs for both SVX and SXV word orders are nonargument positions including topic, pre-subject and post-verbal positions. However, in SXV sentences, adverbs are also allowed to appear in the X position where a grammatical object could appear, indicating that SXV word order is relatively marked. Example (7) shows that the temporal adverb amicaáca ‘one day away (i.e. yesterday/tomorrow)’ occupies the X position in the SXV sentences. Example (8) shows that such a sentence is ungrammatical in the past context without the counterfactual morpheme or the nonassertive hypothetical morpheme. Examples (9) and (10) show that the temporal adverb can occupy the post-verbal position in both realis and irrealis sentences.

(7) Qui=amicaáca=nara-r++-Ø. 1S=one.day.away=bathe-MMT.PFV-EC Tomorrow I will bathe.

(8) *Qui=amicaáca=nara-Ø-cura. 1S=one.day.away=bathe-GNR.PFV-RPST Yesterday I took a bath.

In Iquito, there are two major types of sentential negation. The first one occurs in independent declarative sentences. The negative particle caa precedes the pronoun subject, as in (11), or follows the topicalized item if there is any. The position of caa is not sensitive to tense, aspect, or mood under this type of construction.

(11) Caa qui=niqui-Ø-cura

iina icuani.

NEG 1S=see-GNR.PFV-RPST DET man

I did not see that man (yesterday).

The second type of sentential negation in Iquito exists in interrogative clauses and subordinate clauses, including relative and adverbial clauses. In this type of construction, a different negative morpheme -ji is marked on the verb, and the negative marker caa, which precedes the verb in the first type, now follows the verb, as in (12).

(12) Can++ca casira-ji-qui-Ø

caa paapaaja?

who grab-NEG.SUB-GNR.PFV-EC NEG fish

Who did not grab fish?

However, the sentential negation of the second type of construction presents numerous diverse forms in the environment of irrealis19 mood, indicating that SXV word order is a

51

marked structure. Example (13) shows that caa follows the interrogative subject and then precedes as well as follows the verb. In (14), the interrogative object begins the sentence. The negative particle caa follows the pronoun subject and then precedes as well as follows the verb. The fact that caa can also occupy the object position in the SOV environment further supports the idea that the SOV pattern is highly marked.

(13) Can++ca caa jicata-ji-r++-Ø

caa nu-naana?

who NEG take.out-NEG.SUB-MMT.PFV-EC NEG 3S-wood

Who will not take out his wood?

(14) Saaca nu=ca=mit++-ji-r++-Ø

caa nu-atamajana?

what 3S=NEG=give-NEG.SUB-MMT.PFV-EC NEG 3S-brother

What won’t he give to his brother?

Note that in sentences with a complex verbal predicate, for example, those having embedded infinitival clauses besides the main verb, the word order does not display a straightforward SVO pattern. Instead, it exhibits an SVV...OV pattern, which is also the case in the irrealis environment (SOV word order). Example (15) is an example of a complex verbal phrase in the SVO environment, and (16) is an example of it in the SOV environment. It is seen that both sentences using complex predicates display the same word order pattern—SVV…OV—no matter whether they are in realis mood (SVX) or in irrealis mood (SXV).

It is important to mention that SV is basic word order in intransitives, just as in transitive clauses. When the subject is a non-topicalized, definite nominal phrase, only the definite article precedes the verb, with the bare nominal remaining after the verb. As can be seen in (17), the determiner iina begins the sentence and appears before the verb and the bare subject appears after, showing a discontinuous S. The word order in example (17) is DVS (D stands for determiner/demonstrative).

(17) Iina maqui-i-Ø icuani. DET sleep-IPFV-EC man That man is sleeping.

One might attempt to group S and O together as opposed to A (i.e. agent, the subject of a transitive verb) in terms of grammatical relations, based on the subject position shown in
53

(17). However, there are several points we have to make clear. While we can get a discontinuous S in a realis indicative single-verb intransitive clause, we never get a discontinuous O in a realis indicative single-verb transitive clause. As can be seen in (18), the word order is DAVDO (SVO). We do not get a discontinuous O.

(18) Iina m+yaara s++naqui-Ø-cura

iina caaya.

DET dog

chew/bite-GNR.PFV-RPST DET person

That dog bit that person (yesterday).

Moreover, when the subject is indefinite, the word order in an intransitive clause is SV instead of VS. It is noted that the translation of subject phrase in English shows that it is semantically and syntactically indefinite in this language. Example (19) shows that the bare nominal subject precedes the verb.

(19) Icuani maqui-i-Ø. man sleep-IPFV-EC A man is sleeping.

In addition, when the definite S is topicalized, leaving behind a resumptive subject pronoun preceding the verb, the word order is—S, SV as shown in (20).

(20) Iina icuani nu=maqui-i-Ø. DET man 3S=sleep-IPFV-EC That man, he is sleeping.

54

The syntactic behaviors of S and O, in terms of positions appearing in the clause and the discontinuous pattern pertaining to the context of definiteness, are totally different. We could not group S and O together to say that this is an ergative language.
Besides all the above-mentioned points, the SVO word order indeed appears very frequently in the texts, and it is usually the word order which starts a discourse. Based on all these factors, SVO should be considered as the basic word order which fulfills the criterion of descriptive simplicity.
2.3.2 Negation There are three major types of negation in Iquito: sentential negation with lexical
verbs, negation of locative and existential constructions, and negation of imperatives. This section introduces negation with lexical verbs (detailed in §4.3), negation in locative and existential constructions and negation in imperatives (detailed in §4.6.3).
In Iquito, sentential negation in principal and independent clauses is expressed differently from embedded and interrogative clauses. As such, there are two main patterns of sentential negation. The first main pattern of sentential negation, named caa negation, exists in independent or principal declarative sentences. The negative marker caa precedes the pronoun subject or follows the topicalized item if there is any. The second main pattern of sentential negation, named ji-caa negation, exists in embedded and interrogative clauses. Here a different negative morpheme -ji, which follows the verbal root and precedes tense and aspect morphemes, is marked on the verb, and the negative marker caa, which precedes the main verb in the first main pattern now follows the main verb. See §4.3 for schematic structures of sentential negation.
In caa negation, the negative particle caa is placed at the beginning of the utterance, if there is no topic element, to negate the entire sentence; it follows a
55

topicalized element and precedes the resumptive pronoun. As can be seen in (22) in comparison with (21), when the subject is a non-topicalized pronoun, the negative particle caa is placed directly at the beginning of the sentence without changing the position of the subject. On the other hand, if there is a topic element, as in (23), caa follows such an element and precedes the resumptive pronoun, as in (24). Example (25) is a case of constituent negation of the subject. As can be seen, the cleft construction is used to express subject negation. It is noted that the negated subject cannot be repeated again before the verb in the embedded clause, as in (26).

(21) Qui=niqui-Ø-cura

iina icuani.

1S=see-GNR.PFV-RPST DET man

I saw that man (yesterday).

(22) Caa qui=niqui-Ø-cura

amicaáca iina icuani.

DET woman 3S=see-GNR.PFV-RPST one.day.away DET man

That woman saw that man yesterday.

(24) Iina m+saji caa nu=niqui-Ø-cura

iina icuani.

DET woman NEG 3S=see-GNR.PFV-RPST DET man

That woman did not see that man (yesterday).

56

(25) Ca=t+ quiija (iina)20 niqui-Ø-cura iina icuani. NEG=COP 1S DET see-PFV-RPST DET man It’s not me who saw that man (yesterday).
(26) *Ca=t+ quiija (iina) qui=niqui-Ø-cura iina icuani. NEG=COP 1S DET 1S=see-PFV-RPST DET man It’s not me who saw that man (yesterday).
Note that expressions of constituent negation imply an affirmative presupposition before the negative version is uttered. Therefore, expressions of constituent negation often imply contrastive focus. The characteristics of Iquito constituent negation as focus are as follows. First, when only a subject or an object is negated, instead of the entire clause, only the negated constituent is fronted to the beginning of the sentence, separated from the original clause. Second, a copula construction is adopted for the negated elements, followed by a finite clause. The whole sentence is usually called a cleft construction. Third, the negated elements are not repeated again in the embedded clause, which is very similar to how focus is usually expressed crosslinguistically. Based on the abovementioned characteristics, it could be said that in Iquito, the cleft construction is used to express focused elements (i.e. affirmative and the constituent negations). Another point is that the relative pronouns iina/iimi/iip+ are not always obligatory. Although they are preferred by some speakers, they are used more often when more than one embedded clause is used. Example (27) shows that in a negative embedded clause, an additional
20 In Iquito, the difference between an independent clause and a dependent clause is that for a dependent clause, it is generally grammatical to add the word iina at the beginning of the clause. Iina can function as a subordinator, a relative pronoun, a determiner or a demonstrative, depending on the context in which it appears. In an independent clause, on the other hand, such an addition would otherwise make the sentence ungrammatical.
57

negative morpheme -ji is attached to the verbal stem followed by the tense/aspect information, followed by the negative particle caa.

(27) Ca=t+ quiija (iina) niqui-ji-Ø-cura

caa iina icuani.

NEG=COP 1S DET see-NEG.SUB-PFV-RPSTNEG DET man

It’s not me who did not see that man (yesterday).

The following is a pair of examples of affirmation (28) and negation (29). In (29), caa follows the topic noun phrase and precedes the resumptive pronoun in the principal clause; caa follows the verbal complex, additionally marked by -ji, in the embeeded clause.

(28) Iina m+saji nu=niqui-qui-Ø

iina icuani (iina) nacusi-i-Ø umaata.

DET woman 3S=see-GNR.PFV-EC DET man DET know-IPFV-EC much

That woman saw that man who knows a lot.

(29) Iina m+saji caa nu=niqui-qui-Ø

iina icuani

DET woman NEG 3S=see-GNR.PFV-EC DET man

(iina) nacusi-ji-Ø-Ø

caa umaata.

DET know-NEG.PFV-IPFV-EC NEG much

That woman did not see that man who does not know a lot.

We now turn to the negation in copula and in locative/existential constructions. The negative particle caa is contracted with the copula verb t++ as a contracted form
58

cat+ ‘is not,’ which is placed directly in front of what is to be negated. Example (30) is an affirmative copula sentence, and (31) is the negative version with the contracted negative particle and copula.

(30) Huiirajuuja t++ iina paapaaja.

COP DET fish

That fish is fried.

(31) Ca=t+

huiirajuuja iina paapaaja.

NEG=COP fried

DET fish

That fish is not fried.

The locative/existential is expressed as iiquii ‘there is/are’ in the affirmative context, as in (32). In the negative context, the existential is expressed as ajapaqui ‘there isn’t/aren’t’ (33), while the locative is conveyed through the expression of caa …iiquii ‘isn’t/aren’t’ (here/there)’ (34).

(32) Iina paapaaja tíira nu=iiqui-i-Ø. DET fish there 3S=EXT-IPFV-EC That fish is there. There is (that) fish there.

(33) Ajapaqui paapaaja (tíira).

NEG.EXT fish

(34) Iina paapaaja caa nu=iiqui-i-Ø

tíira.

DET fish

NEG 3S=EXT-IPFV-EC there

That fish is not there.

Negation in imperative sentences is, at first sight, indicated by the potential marker -cuma, as in (36). However, this grammatical marker does not have a negative meaning itself as it is also used in affirmative contexts. The reason for this preliminary confusion is due to the omitability of the negative particle in combination with the second person singular pronoun, comparing (36) with (37). The possibility of omitting the negative particle and the grammatical person does not exist if the negative imperative sentence is directed to other grammatical persons. Refer to section §4.6.3 for a detailed discussion.

2.3.3 Coordination Coordination refers to the connection of two or more phrases or clauses.
Coordination differs from subordination in that connected clausal units are independent of each other. This section introduces three types of coordination in Iquito: conjunction, disjunction, and adversative conjunction. It is generally noted that very frequently two elements are simply juxtaposed directly without using any coordinator. As such, we can say that in Iquito, when coordinators are used, they do not function only as connectors, but also are used to express a sense of comparison or contrast. This section only discusses conjunction and disjunction because they are more relevant for the semantic tests of temporal properties than the adversative conjunction, which I did not use for the tests.
In Iquito, conjunction is used more frequently at the clausal level than at the level of nominal phrases or verbal phrases. Therefore, the sentence you and I are singing is most frequently expressed as you are singing (and) I am singing. When the coordinator najaaja ‘also’ is used, it expresses the sense of comparison, and demonstrates the equal status of phrases or clauses. Although the word najaaja ‘also’ can be used in the conjunction of two or more clauses, it is noted that if the clauses share neither subjects/objects nor verbs, the word najaaja ‘also’ cannot be used since no parts of the sentences are in common. The following diagram shows all possible positions of the coordinator najaaja ‘also’ with respect to the coordinated phrases. There are three observed possibilities for the positions of the coordinator najaaja ‘also.’ It can appear in all positions between the coordinated phrases simultaneously. Alternatively, it can just appear once before or after the last coordinated phrase.
61

Diagram 3. Possible Positions of the Coordinator Najaaja ‘also’

As shown in (38), the coordinator appears between two clauses, and in (39), it appears after the second, also the last, clause.
(38) Quiaaja quia=ariicua-a-Ø. Najaaja quiija cu=ariicua-a-Ø. 2S 2S=sing-IPFV-EC also 1S 1S=sing-IPFV-EC You are singing and I am also singing.
(39) Quiaaja quiaricuaa. Quiija cuaricuaa najaaja. You are singing and I am singing as well.
It is noted, again, that in general, the word najaaja is optional. The word najaaja ‘also’ does not usually appear when we are simply connecting two phrases or clauses. It appears more frequently when we connect more than two, especially when the coordinated phrases are objects. However, the presence of the coordinator is obligatory when infinitive verbs are coordinated. The coordinator appears to disambiguate infinitival clausal constructions from conjunctions. As seen in (40), there is no coordinator appearing between the two infinitive verbs namit++ni ‘begin’ and naajuuni ‘write.’ However, in (41), the coordinator appears between the two coordinated infinitive verbs.
(40) Jaime nu=nacar++-yaa-cura namit++ni naajuuni. 62

Jaime 3S=want-IPFV-RPST begin.INF write.INF (Yesterday), Jaime wanted to begin to write.

paj++ni najaaja naajuuni.

DET 3S=know-IPFV-EC learn.INF also write.INF

He knows how to read and write.

Sometimes, instead of utilizing coordination, speakers place one of the elements they wish to coordinate at the end of the sentence and use a comitative phrase in the expression as shown in (42).

(42) Quiija qui=mayaasi-i-Ø arihuaani=jata. 1S 1S=dance-IPFV-EC sing.INF=COM I dance and sing. (Literally: I dance with singing.)

Disjunction expresses the meaning of English or and offers alternatives, options or possibilities in the sentence. Subject disjunction applies at the phrasal level in three ways. First, we can place all elements together before the verb and use the singular form as the subject pronoun to indicate disjunction. The use of a singular pronoun disambiguates disjunction from conjunction in which the subject pronoun takes a plural form to express a sense of and. Second, we can put all elements for disjunction at the beginning of the sentence and use the word cuquisaacari ‘probably’ before one or all elements. A singular pronoun is still used before the verb. Third, we can express one option before the verb and displace others to the end of the sentence and connect them with the sentence using the word cuquisaacari ‘probably.’ Disjunction of objects and
63

adpositional phrases works in the same way except the word cuquisaacari ‘probably’ is always used to disambiguate it from conjunction. Also, they do not involve the form of the subject pronoun. Disjunction of verbs operates only at the clausal level and therefore each verb has to appear in different clauses. Note that speakers use the word cuquisaacari ‘probably’ more frequently than any other alternative although some speakers like to use phrases, such as najaaja j++ta/j++ta najaaja ‘also as,’ or najaaja cuuta ‘also perhaps.’ The following schematized diagram shows all possible positions of the coordinator cuquisaacari ‘probably’ with respect to the coordinated phrases. There are two observed possibilities for the positions of the coordinator cuquisaacari ‘probably.’ It can appear before all coordinated phrases simultaneously or just once before the last coordinated phrase. Unlike in the case of conjunction, it does not appear after the last coordinated phrase.

In subject disjunction, we can simply place all elements together before the verb and use the singular form as the subject pronoun to indicate disjunction as in (43) and (44). The use of a singular pronoun disambiguates disjunction from conjunction in which
64

the subject pronoun takes a plural form as shown in (45). Examples (43)-(45) do not use coordinators.

We can also put all elements for disjunction at the beginning of the sentence and use the word cuquisaacari ‘probably’ before one (46) or all options (47). A singular pronoun is still used before the verb.

It is possible to express only one option before the verb and displace others to the end of the sentence and connect them with the sentence using the word cuquisaacari ‘probably’ as in (48).

(48) Jaime nu=pariijata-a-Ø cuquisaacari Juaa. Jaime 3S=help-IPFV-EC probably Juan Jaime or Juan will help.

In object disjunction, the word cuquisaacari ‘probably’ is always used between the coordinated phrases to disambiguate disjunction from conjunction as seen in (49). If cuquisaacari ‘probably’ is not used, the meaning is conjunction as in (50).

2.3.4 When- Clauses and Conditional Constructions This section introduces when- clauses and conditional constructions. A when-
clause, paired with a principal clause, is often used for semantic tests of aspectual readings. The ordering of the when- clause and the principal clause is not fixed; either of the two clauses can appear first. A when- clause begins with j++ticari in Iquito and introduces an RT. The RTs of the two clauses overlap if one of the clauses contains the Imperfective Aspect; they follow each other, yielding a sequential reading, if both clauses contain perfective aspects. For example, in (51), both clauses contain perfective aspects; therefore, the RTs of the two clauses do not coincide. The event of [I arrive there] and that of [he finish write two letters] do not overlap with each other; the temporal adverb jaa ‘already’ gives the cue that the event [he finish write two letters] precedes that of [I arrive there].

When I arrived there (yesterday), he had already finished writing two letters.

A conditional construction in Iquito consists of two clauses—an antecedent clause and a consequent clause. There is a fairly strong preference for ordering the antecedent clause before the consequent clause. There are counterfactual (CF) and noncounterfactual (non-CF) conditionals (detailed in §4.4) in Iquito. Tense, Mood, and Aspect in both CF and non-CF conditionals is ‘real’ in the sense that they receive the
67

same temporal, modal and aspectual interpretations as they do in non-conditionals. The counterfactuality difference between CF conditionals and non-CF conditionals is expressed by a specialized CF morpheme (+)t+,22 which always accompanies SXV irrealis word order and conveys CF meaning by entailment instead of implicature. As in (52), the CF morpheme appears directly following the subject, in this case, between the subject and the adverb in the antecedent clause and between the subject and the definite article of the object phrase in the consequent clause. The object phrase in the consequent clause is discontinuous as the definite article precedes the verb while the nominal follows the verb.

If I had been here, I would have seen that woman.

The difference between non-CF conditionals and non-conditionals resides in that there is an additional bi-partite non-assertive formative sa…cari appearing in the antecedent clause or an epistemic adverbial cuuta ‘perhaps’ appearing in the consequent clause in a non-CF conditional. In (53), the non-assertive formative appears in the antecedent clause.

2.3.5 Basic Verbal Morphology and a General Introduction to Tense, Mood and Aspect in Iquito
This section introduces the morphology in the verbal complex and the general overview of tense, mood and aspect in Iquito. The positions of morphemes inside the verbal complex are fixed as schematized in the following diagram. The optionality or obligatoriness of the morphemes is indicated by the presence or absence of parentheses. As shown, tense and aspect are obligatory categories in the verb. Copulas, discussed below in this section, are exceptions and crosslinguistically manifest irregularities.
Diagram 5. The Schematic Structure of Verbal Morphology in Iquito
(Proclitic)=(Prefix)-Verbal Root-(Derivational Suffix(es))-Aspect-Tense=(Enclitic) (Particle)23
Each label in the diagram is explained in the following. Proclitic indicates a monosyllabic pronoun which phonologically cliticizes onto the verbal complex (i.e. the equal sign ‘=’ signifies the boundary between the clitic and the verbal complex). It is parenthesized because the nominal phrase in the preverbal position is not always a pronoun. In addition, any monosyllabic element in Iquito cliticizes rightward to another
23 It is noted that most of the verbal morphology in Iquito is concatenative and, therefore, I segment the verbal morphology of Iquito as concatenative throughout this dissertation. However, some verbal roots have more than one allomorph and exhibit a change in vowel quality under different aspects and tenses. For example, the root n+t+- ‘swim’ exhibits the form n+tii in Imperfective Aspect and Extended Current Tense and the form n+t+qui in General Perfective Aspect and Extended Current Tense. Strictly speaking, the verbal morphology for this root in these forms is non-concatenative; however, for the sake of consistency, convenience, and clarity for aspect and tense morphology, I choose to present the verbal morphology of this sort as if it were concatenative. The following is an example of my segmentation for this kind of root: n+t+-i-Ø ‘swim-IPFV-EC’ and n+t+-qui-Ø ‘swim-GNR.PFV-EC.’

element to form a phonological word. Prefix indicates a formative attached before the verbal root. In Iquito, suffixation is the prevailing pattern. There is only one prefix attested so far, which is the imperfective anterior morpheme (+)ta- that localizes a situation earlier in the day of SpT, discussed in §5.7. Verbal root is a general term to indicate the core of the verbal complex and the form to which derivational suffixes attach. In Iquito, verbal stem is perhaps a better term to represent the form of the verb (with or without derivational morphemes) to which inflectional suffixes attach. The form of the verbal root (followed by a derivational morpheme) and that of the verbal stem (in this case followed by an inflectional morpheme without intervening derivations) might be different. A derivational suffix is not obligatory, as indicated by parentheses; on the other hand, there could be more than one derivational morpheme present, as indicated by parentheses surrounding the plurals. One aspect morpheme, followed by one tense morpheme, is informationally obligatory in Iquito, even though they might be zeromarked in some cases. Enclitic indicates any clitic (i.e. possibly a reportive marker =na, a proximity =yaa(jaa), or a clause-final marker =na) that follows the verbal complex; an enclitic is not obligatory as indicated by the parentheses. Following the verbal complex and preceding other postverbal elements, there might be a particle, such as the negative particle caa.
Iquito has three tenses (detailed in §3): Extended Current Tense (conveyed by -Ø, indicating an RT frame from the day of SpT extending into the infinite future), Recent Past Tense (conveyed by -cura, indicating an RT frame from the day prior to SpT extending to one to two years prior) and Distant Past Tense (conveyed by -(y)aariqu+ and -quiaqu+, indicating an RT frame from one to two years prior to SpT extending into the infinitely remote past). One of these three tenses is obligatorily expressed in any given Iquito sentence. Viewpoint aspect in Iquito (detailed in §5) is either perfective or
70

imperfective. There is a complex system of perfective aspects, including a General -qui/Ø, a Momentary -r++, a Remote -maa, two Deictics -cuaa/-hu++, an Allative -sahu++ and an Ablative -(y)ar++ Perfective Aspect. There is only one kind of imperfective aspect in Iquito, the general Imperfective -:/-yaa. The positions of tense and aspect
morphemes inside the verbal complex are fixed, as schematized in table 2. In a given
Iquito sentence, one of these eight aspects is expressed, as shown in examples in (54)-
(61).

Grammatical mood in Iquito (detailed in §4) is realis or irrealis. Iquito realis/irrealis mood is expressed by word order change and vowel-hiatus resolution,
72

which is unique among strategies that are attested to date. SVO is the basic word order (Eastman & Eastman, 1963; Lai, 2005) and conveys realis mood. It occurs in finite realis clauses with no element allowed to appear between the subject and the verb, as in (62) and (63). Irrealis mood, however, generally requires an element to occupy the position between the subject and the verb, resulting in SXV word order. The X position in SXV order can be filled by an indefinite grammatical object (64), a pronoun object (65), the determiner of a definite object phrase (66) or an adverb (67), among others (Anderson et al, 2006). In a counterfactual construction, an additional counterfactual morpheme appears after the subject (68).

If I had searched for a peccary, I would have one (now).

In addition, Iquito exhibits a phonotactic constraint against heteromorphemic vowelhiatus within a phonological word. A monosyllabic preverbal element cliticizes rightward to the verbal complex. Instances of underlying vowel-hiatus are resolved by glide formation,24 vowel deletion or vowel fusion, depending on the morphemes and the qualities of the vowels involved. In realis clauses, vowel-hiatus resolution between the subject and the verb is observed (69), while in irrealis clauses such a strategy is blocked when the X position is not filled by an overt lexical item (70). Vowel qualities in (70) are unaltered, as if there is an implicit element in the X position that blocks the vowel-hiatus.

[p+:sakwa:]
24 Glide formation, specifically, is suspected to operate on two levels. First, it is associated with the realis mood. However, secondly, it is also associated with a post-syntactic phonetic phenomenon. That is to say, in slow speech, the glide formation strategy is observed to be blocked in irrealis clauses and to be active in realis clauses; in fast speech, however, glide formation is observed to be still active in irrealis clauses.

With respect to tense and aspect, copulas have fixed forms in different tenses and seem to convey only Imperfective Aspect, exhibiting irregularities. I dedicate the rest of this section to a discussion of forms of copulas as they are not discussed further in the dissertation. In sentences in the Extended Current Tense, the most common form of copula surfaces as t++, as in (71). Copulas do not seem to combine with additional aspectual morphemes, as in (72) and (73).

In sentences in the Recent Past Tense, the only grammatical form of the copula is taa, which is followed by the tense suffix -cura, (80) and (81). Such a form can likewise be attached to by clitics, as in (82)-(86).

Only you yourself were the teacher upriver.

In the sentences in the Distant Past Tense, the form taariqu+ is used to express the copula with an imperfective interpretation, as in (87) and (88). It seems to be the result of the lexicalized form derived from taa plus the Distant Past Tense with Imperfective Aspect -(y)aariqu+. The form taariqu+ can also be attached to by clitics, as in (89) and (90); however, it seems to be ungrammatical or at most marginally acceptable when combined with the veridical and inferential clitics, as in (91) and (92). Its ungrammaticality or unacceptability is possibly attributable to a pragmatic constraint or semantic restriction. For example, the context of using veridical and inferential clitics in the distant past could be highly marked.

In the following chapters, Iquito tense (§3), mood (§4), viewpoint aspect (§5), situation aspect (§6) and their use in discourse contexts (§7) are discussed in detail.

Chapter 3: Tense
3.1 INTRODUCTION
3.1.1 Typology of Tense The preceding chapter provides an overview of the two-component theory, which
includes two components of the aspectual system, situation aspect and viewpoint aspect, and of the theory of temporal interpretation. “Temporal location and aspect are complementary temporal systems. The former locates a situation in time, while the latter specifies the internal temporal structure of the situation” (Smith, 1997: 97). In this chapter, I provide an analysis of Iquito tense in light of Smith’s theory (1997, 2005) of tense and temporal interpretation. Temporal information of a sentence contributes to temporal interpretation which locates a situation25 in time. That is to say, temporal interpretation indicates where a situation is located temporally in relation to a reference time, which is generally SpT or some other reference point. Temporal interpretation is directly attained from tense in tensed languages, but is indirectly inferred, in tenseless languages, from semantic information of aspect/mood and pragmatic principles of interpretation. Smith defines the tense category as an obligatory morpheme in the sentence. This is in accordance with Comrie (1993: 2), in which tense is defined as “grammaticalized expression of localization in time.” In light of this conception, Smith presents a typology in terms of formal encoding of time and indicates three types of languages: tensed languages, tenseless languages, and mixed-temporal languages. In tensed languages, such as English, tense is an obligatory category in the sentence; in
25 The term ‘situation’ includes events (i.e. Activities, Accomplishments, Achievements and Semelfactives) and States, following Smith (1991/7). These are five types of ‘situation aspects,’ also termed ‘situation types’.
80

tenseless languages, such as Mandarin Chinese, there is no grammatical tense and temporal interpretation is achieved through adverbials or inferred from aspects; in mixedtemporal languages, such as Navajo, there are inflectional categories expressing time, but they are not obligatory.
The temporal location of a situation requires 1) three times: SpT (the time of utterance), RT (the temporal perspective of the presentation) and SitT (the time in which a situation holds or occurs), and 2) the relation between SpT and RT, and that between RT and SitT. The three times and two relations are encoded by tense; therefore, temporal interpretation is direct in tensed languages. In tenseless languages, temporal interpretation relies on the semantic information of aspects, pragmatic principles and inference rules. An aspectual system, under Smith’s two-component theory (1991 [1997]), includes situation aspects and viewpoint aspects.26 Situation aspects are categorized in terms of three temporal features: dynamism, duration and telicity. Telic and non-durative events are intrinsically bounded. Viewpoint aspects semantically convey boundedness by presenting the situation in part or in its entirety. Boundedness information is essential as it determines the relationship between the situation and SitT. Bounded events occur within the SitT interval and unbounded events or states overlap the SitT interval. Pragmatic principles for inference of temporal interpretation in tenseless languages include the following:
(93) From Smith (2005) A. The Deictic Principle Speech Time is the central orientation point for language. The Present time is located at Speech Time; the Past precedes it, and the Future follows.
26 Situation aspect is conveyed by the verb and its argument(s); viewpoint aspect is conveyed by a grammatical morpheme.
81

B. The Bounded Event Constraint Bounded situations may not be located in the Present.
C. The Simplicity Principle Choose the interpretation that requires least information added or inferred.
The above three principles constrain temporal interpretation in tensed languages and guide the default pattern of temporal interpretation in tenseless languages. In the following, I will briefly discuss tensed languages and tenseless languages, using the principles presented above.
I use English as the example of a tensed language. Essentially following Reichenbach’s (1947) account, Smith assumes SpT=RT=SitT for Present tense, SitT=RT and RT<SpT for Past tense, and SitT=RT and RT>SpT for Future tense. The Perfect conveys SitT<RT.
(94) English: a tensed language a. Mary is talking. b. Mary left the house. c. Mary will leave the house. d. Mary has left the house. e. Mary had left the house when I arrived home.
In (94), the Present sentence Mary is talking locates the situation as simultaneous with SpT. The Past sentence Mary left the house locates the situation as prior to SpT. The Future sentence Mary will leave the house locates the situation as posterior to SpT. The Present Perfect sentence Mary has left the house locates the situation as prior to SpT
82

which is also the temporal perspective of the sentence, the RT. The Past Perfect sentence Mary had left the house when I arrived home locates the situation [Mary leave the house] as prior to some RT in the past, in this case, the moment when I arrived home, which is in turn prior to SpT.
In tenseless languages, tense is not an obligatory category in a sentence. While temporal adverbials can explicitly specify the temporal location, temporal interpretation without such adverbials is achieved through inference from aspectual information. Viewpoint aspects semantically encode boundedness information and the relationship between SitT and RT. The relationship between RT and SpT in tenseless languages is not directly provided but indirectly inferred. The crosslinguistic default pattern of temporal location in tenseless languages, explained by pragmatic principles in (93), is as in (95). The simplest deictic interpretation of an unbounded situation is present while the simplest deictic interpretation of a bounded situation is past, rather than future, which generally requires additional information. The default pattern can be overridden if an explicit adverb or other information is presented.
(95) Default pattern of temporal location Unbounded situations are located in the present; bounded situations are located in the past.
In the following, I take Mandarin Chinese, a tenseless language, as an example to show how aspectual information contributes to the inference of temporal interpretation. I discuss only the perfective aspects -le and -guo, and the imperfective aspect zai. These viewpoint aspects semantically encode the following information as in (96).
83

(96) Mandarin Viewpoint Aspects -le: bounded event; SitT=RT -guo: bounded event; SitT<RT zai: unbounded event; SitT=RT
Based on the information provided by the viewpoint aspects (as in (96)), in conjunction with the pragmatic principles in (93), the situations in (97) are located in the past ((97)a and (97)b) and in the present ((97)c). Please refer to Smith and Erbaugh (2005) for detailed discussions on Mandarin Chinese.

3.1.2 Tense Morphology in Iquito This section principally discusses the morphology of tense27 in Iquito. Semantic
details are discussed in §3.2.
27 The first work done on tense suffixes is Beier (2003b).
84

Iquito exhibits three tense distinctions:28 Distant Past Tense, Recent Past Tense and Extended Current Tense, which are conveyed by -quiaqu+/-(y)aariqu+, -cura, and -Ø, respectively. One of these three tenses is obligatorily expressed in a given finite sentence. Distant Past Tense presents a situation within an RT frame from one to two years prior to SpT extending into the infinitely remote past. The morpheme -quiaqu+ combines with perfective aspects, as in (98), while -(y)aariqu+ is a portmanteau morpheme of Distant Past Tense and Imperfective Aspect, as in (99).

He wrote this letter (yesterday).

28 Structurally, the potential/optative -cuma patterns with tense formatives (i.e. occupies the same position in the verb) and clearly refers to a situation in the distant future. However, besides the arguable temporal component, it is solely used to express a weak prediction or a wish with strong uncertainty, it is therefore discussed under the mood chapter in §4.5.2.
85

Extended Current Tense, conveyed by -Ø, indicates an RT frame from the day of SpT extending into the infinite future, as in (101).
(101) Qui=iicua-qui-Ø tíira naqui-cuura. 1S=go-GNR.PFV-EC there forest-DST I went there to the forest (today).
In the following, I discuss specifically the morphology of Extended Current Tense. A previous study on Iquito by Eastman and Eastman (1963) presents -qui and the phonologically unexpressed -Ø as allomorphs of a tense morpheme which means “present (pp. 179)” or “present, done today (pp. 180).” Although diachronically it might once have been a tense morpheme, this dissertation re-analyzes -qui as an allomorph of General Perfective Aspect synchronically, and proposes -Ø as the only form of Extended Current Tense. Below I present empirical grounds in favor of the current analysis and suggest the case of -qui as an interesting phenomenon of a shift in function, within inflectional morphology, of the same bound morpheme, as there is evidence showing that it must once have been a tense morpheme while other evidence suggests it is best treated as General Perfective Aspect synchronically.
First, sentences in the Extended Current Tense (with more examples and semantic details in §3.2) represent a range of reference time from the day of SpT, including earlier today (102), the current speech moment (103) and later today (104), to the more distant future, as in (105) and (106). This suggests that as a tense category, definitions, such as ‘present’ tense or ‘done today,’ clearly do not cover all possible temporal references of the situation indicated in a sentence.

Second, in a simple sentence without a postverbal clitic, -qui only surfaces in perfective environments following stems ending in short vowels, including past perfective, as in (107), and future perfective, as in (108). This suggests that it is best treated as a perfective aspect marker, and not as a past-tense marker.

Third, the form -qui alternates with -Ø depending on the phonological environment. The relative positions of different tense and aspect morphemes in a verb are as shown in (109), and the schematic summary in table 3 represents the phonological contexts and realizations of General Perfective and Imperfective Aspects in sentences in the Extended Current Tense without clitics. Table 3 shows that in sentences in the Extended Current Tense, when the ending vowel of the verbal stem (verbal root with or without derivational suffixes) is short, General Perfective Aspect surfaces as -qui and Imperfective Aspect surfaces as vowel length; when the ending vowel is long, Genreral Perfective Aspect is unmarked as -Ø and Imperfective Aspect surfaces a -yaa.29

29 The first work on the allomorphy of Imperfective Aspect is Beier (2003a).

It follows from the above discussion that -qui only appears in a perfective environment in sentences in the Extended Current Tense. As shown in (110) and (111), this allomorph does not go with the Imperfective or any other perfective aspects. The sentences are ungrammatical if -qui surfaces in place of -Ø, which indicates Extended Current Tense, as in (112).

30 There is only one verbal prefix attested in Iquito, which is the anterior morpheme -(+)ta which goes with the Imperfective Aspect in sentences in Extended Current Tense. Its function is to locate an open situation prior to SpT.

Fourth, when speakers utter a sentence in the morning to talk about a situation later in the night31 of the same day, some of them adopt the Imperfective Aspect if the situation is viewed as imminent. If the situation is viewed with more temporal distance, they use the irrealis mood (SXV) in combination with either General Perfective Aspect (104) or Momentary Aspect (105). Speakers use the irrealis mood plus General Perfective Aspect for the more immediate future than when they use Momentary Perfective Aspect. The fact that General Perfective -qui and Momentary Perfective -r++ are in complementary distribution structurally suggests -qui, just like -r++, is best treated as an aspect morpheme, at least synchronically speaking. In addition, the fact that -qui is not always used indicates that it does not pattern as an obligatory tense category. Finally, Iquito uses perfective aspects to indicate an imperative construction. Different perfective aspects are utilized in imperative sentences to indicate different spatial orientations, as in (113)(115), by which the speaker expects the situation to be realized. Again, this suggests that because -qui patterns with other perfective aspects, it is best treated as an aspect morpheme. It is noted that the General Perfective aspect marker surfaces as a null morpheme following a root ending in long vowels, as in (116).

(113) Quiaaja, cuhuasi-qui!
31 When speakers talk about events that will take place on the same day, they use different aspect markers (Momentary Perfective Aspect -r++, General Perfective Aspect -qui, or Imperfective Aspect -yaa ~ -:), depending on the distance in time they view the situation.

(116) Isiin++-Ø! cough-GNR.PFV Cough!

In the above, I provide empirical evidence and propose that -qui is synchronically an allomorph of General Perfective Aspect instead of an allomorph of a tense category and that sentences in the Extended Current Tense are zero-marked. The evidence discussed is summarized again as follows. First, sentences in the Extended Current Tense cover a range of possible temporal reference, from earlier today to further in the future. Second, the form -qui only appears in perfective environments. Third, -qui alternates with -Ø in sentences in the Extended Current Tense depending on the phonological environment and not according to any semantic differences. In addition, -qui cannot combine with Imperfective Aspect or any other perfective aspect, indicating that it is an aspect

91

morpheme. Fourth, -qui structurally patterns with other perfective aspects, which is shown especially clearly in imperatives.
To continue with the discussion of how -qui might be a tense morpheme diachronically, I provide examples with the postverbal clitic =yaa(jaa). The clitic =yaa(jaa) appears in postverbal positions, including immediately following the verb, or in sentence-final positions. It pairs with temporal or spatial reference to emphasize the proximity or exactness of the orientation point. For example, in the context of temporal expressions, it functions as a temporal narrowing device and indicates proximity to RT, translated in English as still or soon; in spatial contexts, it narrows the area of reference, translated in English as right (there/here), exactly (there/here). It can pair with the same reference term and has either temporal or spatial expression, depending on the aspect appearing in the sentence. The clitic =yaa(jaa) cannot attach to the element in the sentence-initial position, except for some lexicalized examples (§3.3).
The clitic always surfaces as =yaajaa in sentence-final positions, as in (117), (118), (119) and (120), no matter if it attaches to the verb or the reference word. It also is not restricted in terms of what aspect it appears with, as it can appear with the General Perfective Aspect as in (117) and (118), or the Imperfective Aspect, as in (119) and (120).

I now restrict the examples to the position which immediately follows the verb. It is seen that the clitic surfaces as =yaa(jaa) following the tense of the verb in the context of Distant Past Tense (122) and Recent Past Tense (123). In the context of Extended Current Tense, however, it surfaces as =quiyaa(jaa), following the Extended Current Tense (124).

It is seen that the ‘qui’ in =quiyaa(jaa) does not stand for the General Perfective Aspect, as it can appear after the Imperfective Aspect. Sentence (124) contains the General Perfective Aspect and a verbal root ending in a long vowel; (125) contains the Imperfective Aspect with the same verb as (124); (126) contains the Imperfective Aspect and a verbal root with short vowel; (127) contains the General Perfective Aspect and the same verb as (126).

The realization of the clitic =yaa(jaa), among other post-verbal evidential clitics, is the only systematic evidence that would support the idea that -qui must once have been a tense morpheme, indicating ‘today,’ as the sequence ‘quiyaa(jaa)’ patterns with ‘curayaa(jaa)’ and ‘quiaqu+yaa(jaa)’/‘(y)aariqu+yaajaa’ where -cura and -quiaqu+/ -(y)aariqu+ are tense morphemes.
I propose that synchronically -qui is an allomorph of the General Perfective Aspect marker instead of a tense morpheme. It is clearly an analytical matter and this analysis is simpler and more straightforward than the one proposed in the previous literature.

3.2 DISCUSSION OF TENSE AND TEMPORAL INTERPRETATION IN IQUITO
In this section I discuss the formal encoding of tense (§3.2.1) as a grammatical
category, demonstrate the interaction between tenses and temporal adverbials (§3.2.2)
and propose an account of temporal interpretation32 (§3.2.3) in Iquito. I will show that
32 In this chapter, I focus on independent sentences and the deictic temporal interpretations of tenses contained therein. According to Smith (1997[1991]: 104), “canonically communication occurs at SpT and deictics are anchored to that time.” In the narratives, however, sometimes an anaphoric pattern of interpretation is obtained. That is to say, the deictic center shifts to a time introduced or previously established. “A shifted deixis implies a center of consciousness at the new orientation time”…in other words, “with a shifted orientation time the center of communication and consciousness shifts also” (pp. 104). I will discuss temporal interpretation of tense in connected texts in Chapter 7 of this dissertation. For more information about tense in discourse, please also refer to Smith (2003) and Banfield (1982).

tense, like aspect, is obligatory in Iquito. I will also show that in Iquito, although all three tenses provide basic temporal information, more precise temporal location in relation to SpT is inferred in the case of Extended Current Tense. This is a particularity of Iquito which makes it distinct from other tensed languages.

3.2.1 Tense Distinctions in Iquito Iquito has three tenses: Distant Past Tense, Recent Past Tense and Extended
Current Tense. The two Distant Past Tense morphemes -quiaqu+ and -(y)aariqu+, as in (128) and (129), respectively, each gives a time span of RT from one up to two years prior to SpT, extending into the infinitely remote past. The difference between the two Distant Past Tense morphemes is that the morpheme -quiaqu+ is used with perfective aspects including General Perfective Aspect and Momentary Perfective Aspect, among others. General Perfective Aspect33 is unmarked in recent and distant past, so the morpheme -quiaqu+ could by itself represent a combination of Distant Past Tense and General Perfective Aspect. The morpheme -(y)aariqu+ encodes Distant Past Tense and Imperfective Aspect.34

1S=go-GNR.PFV-DPST.NIP there forest-DST

I went there to the forest (in the distant past).

33 Iquito has a complex system of perfective aspects. General Perfective Aspect is not morphologically marked in the recent-past and distant-past environment. When combining with Extended Current Tense, -qui surfaces after the verbal root ending in a short vowel. It is also not marked after the verbal root ending in a long vowel. For a detailed discussion of the General Perfective Aspect, please refer to Chapter 5. 34 Imperfective Aspect is realized as -(y)aariqu+ in the Distant Past Tense and -(y)aa in the Recent Past Tense. When combining with Extended Current Tense, -: (vowel length) surfaces after the verbal root ending in a short vowel and -yaa after the verbal root ending in a long vowel. For a detailed discussion on the Imperfective Aspect, please refer to Chapter 5.

3S=write-GNR.PFV-RPST DET letter

He wrote this letter (in the recent past).

The morpheme -cura, glossed as Recent Past Tense as in (130), conveys the RT span from yesterday to one year prior to SpT (up to two years prior, for some speakers). The temporal boundary between -cura, and -quiaqu+/-(y)aariqu+ is not rigidly fixed in terms of metrical conception of time. When talking about an event occurring around one and half years ago, speakers might choose to use either Recent Past Tense or Distant Past Tense, depending on the sense of temporal remoteness they perceive. Speakers also have their individual styles. Certain people tend to choose Recent Past Tense and others, Distant Past Tense. Although the boundary between Distant Past Tense and Recent Past Tense is not entirely unchangeable, the range of this relatively free zone is unanimously restricted. None of the speakers would talk about an event occurring more than two years prior to SpT, using Recent Past Tense. Likewise, when talking about an event occurring within a month prior to SpT, none of them would use Distant Past Tense.
Extended Current Tense, conveyed by the phonologically unexpressed -Ø, indicates a time span of RT which includes the day of SpT and extends into the infinite future. Sentences in the Extended Current Tense are obligatorily unmarked and yet have
97

such an interpretation, which is confined within a certain RT span. Furthermore, Extended Current Tense cannot combine with temporal adverbs indicating a time in the recent past or distant past. The current study, therefore, proposes that sentences which are not overtly marked with any audible element are in fact tensed and contain Extended Current Tense, very much like the Present Tense with first or second person in English. Greater specificity regarding the temporal location within the RT span is either specified by temporal adverb or pragmatically inferred from viewpoint aspects and mood.35 The temporal location of perfective sentences with realis word order (SVX) is inferred as being prior to SpT, as in (131). That of perfective sentences with irrealis word order (SXV) is understood as posterior to SpT, as in (132). Clauses containing verbs marked with Imperfective Aspect always co-occur with realis word order (SVX), and the temporal location for these clauses is understood as overlapping with SpT,36 as in (133), unless an anterior morpheme -(+)ta appears at the beginning of the verbal complex to locate the situation as prior to SpT. I discuss the temporal interpretation of sentences in the Extended Current Tense in detail in §3.2.3.

35 Realis mood is realized by the basic word order SVO, while the irrealis mood is realized by placing an interruptive element between the subject and the verbal complex, when such an element is available, resulting in an SXV pattern. For a detailed discussion on grammatical mood, please refer to §4. 36 These constructions are employed to report on on-going situations or situations in the immediate future.

In the following, I compare these three tenses by giving examples and discussing what speakers pointed out when producing and being presented with these examples.
Sentences with a temporal reference in the recent or distant past obligatorily contain Recent Past Tense or Distant Past Tense. Sentences without them can never be interpreted as indicating such temporal reference, the only exceptions being in narratives where the temporal origo (i.e. deictic center) of the narrator frequently switches to the narrated time.

He wrote this letter.

Example (134) is a sentence with General Perfective Aspect and Recent Past Tense. The temporal reference of clauses marked by -cura is usually interpreted as yesterday by speakers, also very often as the day before yesterday or within a few days, and less often but possibly as up to approximately two years ago. The temporal reference of a similar sentence lacking -cura is understood as the day of SpT, as in (135). Since the sentence is a perfective one, the sentence is interpreted as prior to SpT.37 The sentence cannot be interpreted as yesterday or further in the past.
37 Please see §3.2.3 for detailed discussions on temporal interpretation.

iina simiím+.

(already) 3S=write-GNR.PFV-EC DET letter

He wrote this letter (today).

As illustrated in examples (134) and (135), the cut-off point of Extended Current Tense (conveyed by -Ø) and Recent Past Tense (conveyed by -cura) with respect to temporal distance is between ‘today and afterwards’ and ‘before today.’ According to Comrie (1985), this is one of the most common cut-off points and is referred to, in Latinate terminology, as “hodiernal” and “pre-hodiernal.” In Iquito, therefore, tense is only phonologically overtly marked in a pre-hodiernal context, with -cura being Recent Past Tense, and -quiaqu+ and -(y)aariqu+ being Distant Past Tense.
The temporal reference of sentences marked by -quiaqu+ is generally interpreted as more than one year ago and very often as many years prior to SpT. Example (136), repeated from (128), is a sentence with General Perfective Aspect and Distant Past Tense.

(136) Qui=iicua-Ø-quiaqu+

tíira naqui-cuura.

1S=go-GNR.PFV-DPST.NIP there forest-DST

I went there to the forest (a long time ago).

Again, the temporal reference of similar sentences without -quiaqu+ is interpreted as the day including SpT, as in (137). The temporal reference of the sentence is interpreted as earlier in the day containing SpT, and not one year ago.

(137) Qui=iicua-qui-Ø

tíira naqui-cuura. 100

1S=go-GNR.PFV-EC there forest-DST I went there to the forest (today).
The temporal reference of a sentence marked by -(y)aariqu+, like -quiaqu+, is also interpreted as more than one year ago. Example (138) is a sentence with Imperfective Aspect and Distant Past Tense.
(138) Cu=am+yaaqui-aariqu+ tíira naqui-jina. 1S=hike-DPST.IPFV there forest-LOC I used to walk there in the forest.
The temporal reference of similar sentences without -(y)aariqu+ cannot be interpreted the same. Example (139) is marked with the Imperfective aspect and the Extended Current Tense. The directional morpheme -cuura ‘reference at a distance’ as well as the adverb tíira ‘there’ indicate that the forest is at a distance and, therefore, that the speaker is not in the forest at SpT. If the speaker is in the forest at SpT, the adverb iíti ‘here’ and the locative morpheme -jina ‘on the surface of an object or location’ are used instead. Example (139), therefore, is interpreted as having an immediate future temporal reference as ‘the person is on his or her way to walk in the forest.’
(139) Cu=am+yaaqui-i-Ø tíira naqui-cuura. 1S=hike-IPFV-EC there forest-DST I am going to walk there in the forest.
101

3.2.2 Interaction between Tense and Temporal Adverbs As discussed above, Iquito has three tenses. In this section, I will show that
sentences with past tenses, including Distant Past Tense and Recent Past Tense, cannot combine with present adverbials. Likewise, sentences with Extended Current Tense can never combine with temporal adverbials indicating a time in the recent or distant past. In the following, I demonstrate this point by showing the combination of each tense with the distant-past adverbial j++tirimi amariaana ‘many years ago,’ the recent-past adverbial amicaáca38 ‘yesterday’ and the present adverbial ácari yahu++ni ‘today, now.’ I discuss how temporal adverbials contribute to further specifying the temporal information conveyed by tense morphology. Later, I also show how tense affects and limits the interpretation of adverbials in some cases, specifically in the case of the adverb taríiyaajaa ‘a long time ago.’
We first start with the distant-past adverbial j++tirimi amariaana ‘many years ago.’ In (140), the Distant Past Tense -quiaqu+ co-occurs with this distant-past adverbial. The morpheme -quiaqu+ provides an RT frame spanning from one to two years ago to the infinitely distant past. The temporal adverbial j++tirimi amariaana ‘many years ago’ further specifies a temporal reference that is more vaguely conveyed by the tense.

iina simiím+.

many year COP DET 3S=write-GNR.PFV-DPST.NIP DET letter

Many years ago he wrote this letter.

38 The adverbial amicaáca is actually a symmetric one, meaning ‘one day away from SpT,’ i.e. it has both past and future time reference. When it combines with the recent-past tense, it renders the interpretation ‘yesterday’. When used with irrealis mood, realized by word order change, plus Momentary Perfective Aspect -r++, it renders the interpretation ‘tomorrow.’ Please refer to §3.3 for more information.
102

Example (141) shows the incompatibility of j++tirimi amariaana ‘many years ago’ and Recent Past Tense -cura. The speaker Jaime commented that this sentence sounds like “many years ago, he wrote this letter these days,” which is not understandable for him. He suggested that the morpheme -quiaqu+ should be used instead.

iina simiím+.

many year COP DET 3S=write-GNR.PFV-RPST DET letter

Many years ago, he wrote this letter these days.

Likewise, the temporal adverbial j++tirimi amariaana ‘many years ago’ cannot occur in sentences in the Extended Current Tense, as in (142). Jaime suggested, again, that the morpheme -quiaqu+ should be used because the sentence sounds like “many years ago, he wrote this letter today,” which is simply impossible.

iina simiím+.

many year COP DET 3S=write-GNR.PFV-EC DET letter

Many years ago, he wrote this letter today.

We now discuss the recent-past adverb amicaáca ‘yesterday.’ The adverb amicaáca is a symmetric one39 and indicates a time point which is ‘one day away’ from SpT. Therefore it has two interpretations; one is yesterday and the other is tomorrow. Here we discuss the use of ‘yesterday.’ In (143), the sentence combines Recent Past Tense -cura with amicaáca. The tense morpheme -cura gives an RT frame spanning from the day prior to the day of SpT to one up to two years ago. The temporal adverbial
39 Please refer to §3.3 for more discussions.
103

amicaáca ‘yesterday’ further narrows down and specifies the temporal information conveyed by the tense.

iina simiím+.

one.day.away 3S=write-GNR.PFV-RPST DET letter

He wrote this letter yesterday.

Example (144) shows the incompatibility of amicaáca ‘yesterday’ and the distant-past tense -quiaqu+. The speaker Jaime commented, as above, that this sentence sounds like ‘yesterday, many years ago he wrote this letter.’ He suggested that the morpheme -cura should be used.

(144) *Amicaáca nu=najuu-Ø-quiaqu+

iina simiím+.

one.day.away 3S=write-GNR.PFV-DPST.NIP DET letter

Yesterday, many years ago he wrote this letter.

Example (145) shows that the temporal adverb amicaáca ‘yesterday’ cannot occur in a sentence in Extended Current Tense and General Perfective Aspect. As discussed in § 3.2.1, such a sentence has a temporal reference as ‘earlier on the day of SpT.’ The temporal adverb amicaáca therefore does not fit within this span. Jaime suggested, again, that the morpheme -cura should be used.

(145) *Amicaáca nu=najuu-Ø-Ø

iina simiím+.

one.day.away 3S=write-GNR.PFV-EC DET letter

Yesterday, he wrote this letter today.

104

It is worth noting that the temporal adverb amicaáca often renders the interpretation ‘tomorrow.’ However, a future temporal interpretation generally involves several grammatical features. First, an irrealis mood, realized by SXV word order, is usually used, except when the sentence refers to an immediate-future situation, in which case, realis word order with Imperfective Aspect is used. Second, depending on the remoteness of the future situation, different perfective aspects are used. To refer to a situation within the day of SpT, General Perfective Aspect -Ø or -qui is used; to refer to a situation on the following day, Momentary Perfective Aspect -r++ is used; to refer to an even more distant-future situation, Remote Perfective Aspect -maa and the potential -cuma are used. Finally, Extended Current Tense is always used instead of any other tense morpheme. For future temporal reference, §3.3, chapter 4, and chapter 5 all have relevant discussions.
We now continue with the discussion of the present adverbial ácari yahu++ni ‘today.’ In (146), the present adverbial ácari yahu++ni ‘today’ occurs in a sentence of Extended Current Tense. Although Extended Current Tense gives an RT frame spanning from the day of SpT to the infinite future, the temporal adverbial ácari yahu++ni ‘today’ narrows down and makes explicit the temporal reference of the sentence. Furthermore, because the sentence contains General Perfective Aspect and realis mood, the situation of the sentence is interpreted as prior to SpT.

In above discussions, we see that temporal adverbials are only compatible with the tenses which indicate an RT span within which the temporal adverbials are located. Therefore, temporal adverbials contribute to further specifying the temporal information conveyed by tense morphology. Now, I discuss how, on the other hand, tense also affects and limits the interpretation of certain adverbials, specifically in the case of taríiyaajaa ‘a long time ago.’
The temporal adverbial taríiyaajaa ‘a long time ago’ is defined by the speakers, when asked for the meaning of the word without a sentential context, as referring to a time point in the distant past. However, the reference to the temporal point or interval
106

conveyed by taríiyaajaa ‘a long time ago’ is affected by tense morphology in a way that leads to different temporal interpretations. When used with Distant Past Tense, taríiyaajaa ‘a long time ago’ indicates a time within the RT frame of one up to two years ago to the infinite past. When used with Recent Past Tense, taríiyaajaa ‘a long time ago’ indicates a time prior to SpT, within the RT frame between yesterday to one up to two years ago. Finally, when used in a sentence of Extended Current Tense, taríiyaajaa ‘a long time ago’ indicates a time prior to SpT, within the day containing it, usually rendering an interpretation of ‘a few hours ago.’
In examples (149)-(152), the sentences are marked with Distant Past Tense -quiaqu+, and consequently, the time point indicated by taríiyaajaa ‘a long time ago’ is limited to the indicated RT frame. The temporal adverbial taríiyaajaa ‘a long time ago’ can appear either in the beginning or at the end of the sentence.

Example (150) shows that taríiyaajaa ‘a long time ago’ corresponds to a three-year period in the past, which is further specified by the temporal adverbial s+saramaaj+tami amariaana ‘for three years,’ the duration of how long the subject of the sentence lived in the city of Iquitos.

In the Distant Past Tense, taríiyaajaa alternates with two distinct elements, taríi and
yaajaa. Taríi appears independently at the beginning of the sentence and =yaa(jaa)40
appears at the end of the verbal complex. If =yaa(jaa) is not in the sentence-final
position, the syllable ‘jaa’ is omitted. Consultants Hermico and Jaime commented that
taríi indicates a more recent point in the past than does taríiyaajaa in the sentence-initial
position.
40 The clitic =yaajaa functions, in the context of temporal expressions, as a temporal narrowing device. It indicates proximity (expressions such as just or soon) to RT. The clitic =yaajaa cannot attach to the element in the sentence-initial position. I propose that the word taríiyaajaa in the sentence-initial position is lexicalized and used as a word in distant-past situations. The form post-verbal =yaajaa alternates with =quiyaajaa in sentences in Extended Current Tense. As discussed in §3.1.2, this is one of several pieces of evidence to suggest that -qui was once a tense marker, indicating ‘today’. Synchronically, -qui is an allomorph of General Perfective Aspect.

When combined with Recent Past Tense -cura, the RT interpretation in the sentence changes to ‘the other day’ within the frame of yesterday to one up to two years ago.

When taríiyaajaa appears in a sentence of Extended Current Tense, the RT frame in the sentence ranges from around ‘half an hour ago’ to ‘many hours ago.’ The interpretation of temporal reference is flexible, but is limited to the period prior to SpT on the same day of SpT. Hermico commented that sentence (156) means that the letter was written at 5 AM while this sentence was recorded around 10 AM.

A point worth noting is that the temporal adverbial taríiyaajaa ‘a long time ago’ cannot appear sentence-initially in sentences in the Recent Past Tense or Extended Current Tense. Only taríi can appear in this position, with the part =yaa(jaa) appearing at the end of the verbal complex. Only =yaa appears if it is not in the sentence-final position. As mentioned earlier, Hermico and Jaime commented that taríi, in the sentence-initial position, indicates a temporal point closer to SpT than taríiyaajaa does. This observation is consistent with the distributional fact that taríiyaajaa appears in sentence-initial position only in sentences in the Distant Past Tense. I suggest that such a use is a lexicalized one.

3.2.3 Temporal Interpretation in Iquito As shown above, Iquito has three tenses: Distant Past Tense, Recent Past Tense
and Extended Current Tense. Tense, as well as aspect, is an obligatory category in a finite Iquito clause. In this section, I show that, although Iquito is a tensed language―all three tenses provide basic temporal information; the way in which temporal interpretation is achieved in Iquito actually involves characteristics of both tensed and tenseless languages―more precise temporal location in relation to SpT is inferred in the case of Extended Current Tense. In Distant Past Tense and Recent Past Tense, temporal interpretation is direct and the situation in the sentence is located prior to SpT. In sentences in the Extended Current Tense, however, the temporal interpretation is indirect and is achieved through inference which is based on semantic information of aspect and mood, in conjunction with pragmatic principles. I show how temporal interpretation under each tense is achieved using Smith’s (1997, 2005) framework. The study of Iquito temporal interpretation adds another dimension to the already known close connections between tense, mood and aspect.
We first consider Recent Past Tense and Distant Past Tense. The morpheme -cura, as in (161), conveys the RT span from yesterday to one year prior to SpT (up to two years prior, for some speakers). The two Distant Past Tense morphemes -quiaqu+ and -(y)aariqu+, as in (162) and (163) (repeated from (138)), respectively, each gives a time span of RT from one up to two years prior to SpT, extending into the infinitely remote past.

(163) Cu=am+yaaqui-aariqu+ tíira naqui-jina. 1S=hike-DPST.IPFV there forest-LOC I used to walk there in the forest. I was walking there in the forest (in the distant past).

Extended Current Tense (conveyed by an unpronounced morpheme -Ø), as mentioned in §3.2.1 and §3.2.2, is incompatible with temporal adverbials specifying a time in the recent or distant past, and indicates a time span of RT which includes the day of SpT and extends into the infinite future. Sentences in the Extended Current Tense are, therefore, tensed and carry temporal meaning. However, as the RT span conveyed by the tense is relatively broad with respect to SpT, the exact temporal location of a situation can be before, on, or after the current moment, SpT. Such a precise temporal location is either specified by temporal adverbials, or it is attained or pragmatically inferred from viewpoint aspects and mood (cf. §2.1 for background information on Iquito basic constructions). In this section, I use General Perfective Aspect and Imperfective Aspect, in combination with realis mood and irrealis mood, to illustrate how temporal

112

interpretation is achieved under Extended Current Tense. Iquito viewpoint aspects and moods semantically convey the following information (164).
(164) General Perfective Aspect: bounded situation; SitT=RT Imperfective Aspect: unbounded situation; SitT=RT Realis Mood: situation realized, being realized, or definitely to be realized in the immediate future Irrealis Mood: unrealized situation in the future, or used in combination with the counterfactual morpheme (+)t+ to indicate a counterfactual situation in the past or present41
In conjunction with the pragmatic principles in (93), which include the Deictic Principle, the Bounded Event Constraint and the Simplicity Principle, the default pattern of temporal interpretation under Extended Current Tense is the same as that in (95): unbounded situations are located in the present; bounded situations are located in the past. Therefore, for a sentence of Imperfective Aspect, which conveys an unbounded situation, the simplest deictic temporal interpretation is ‘present’ because it requires the least information added or inferred. Likewise, a sentence of General Perfective Aspect, which conveys a bounded situation, receives ‘past’ as the most basic deictic interpretation. The comprehensive pattern in Iquito is stated in (165) and is demonstrated in (166)-(169).
41 According to Iatridou (2001: 231), “we cannot have a counterfactual to the future as the future is conceptualized as not yet fact.” In Iquito, the counterfactual morpheme in combination with the irrealis mood mostly applies to a counterfactual situation in the past or present. It almost never indicates a counterfactual situation in the future, except in the context of a scheduled future event. Please see Chapter 4 for more information.
113

(165) Temporal interpretation in sentences in the Extended Current Tense Imperfective Aspect: The simplest deictic interpretation is present; unless an anterior-imperfective morpheme appears in the sentence to locate a situation prior to SpT. Imperfective Aspect does not combine with irrealis mood except in a counterfactual context. Perfective Aspect: The simplest deictic interpretation is past, unless a word order change (SXV word order which indicates irrealis mood) is involved, in which case, the situation is located in the future.

(166) Nu=simiita-a-Ø iina simiím+. 3S=read-IPFV-EC DET book He is reading this book (now).

Sentence (166) contains Imperfective Aspect and displays the basic SVO word order which conveys realis mood. The situation is interpreted as located in the present, overlapping SpT. This default interpretation is yielded because it requires the least information added. An explicit temporal adverbial, such as soon or in a moment, can override the default reading and force an interpretation of ‘immediate future.’ However, the default reading here is unambiguously present as guided by principles (93)A and (93)C.

114

Example (167) contains a main clause and a subordinate clause, both marked with Imperfective Aspect. The sentence expresses two overlapping situations (due to Imperfective Aspect) which share RT. The difference between (166) and (167) in terms of structure within the clause is that (167) contains an additional anterior-imperfective morpheme (+)ta- which locates the situation in the past, prior to SpT. The interpreted temporal location ‘earlier today,’ as indicated in the translation, is more precise than the temporal information conveyed by Extended Current Tense, although still within its time span.

Sentence (168) is marked with General Perfective Aspect and displays the basic SVO word order which conveys realis mood. The situation is interpreted as located in the past, prior to SpT. This default reading is achieved because 1) General Perfective Aspect conveys a bounded situation, 2) SpT is the orientation point, and 3) no additional information is presented in the sentence, following the pragmatic principles in (93). Again, the further inferred temporal location ‘earlier today’ still remains within the time span given by Extended Current Tense.

115

Sentence (169) is marked with General Perfective Aspect. The difference between (168) and (169) is that (168) displays the basic SVO word order while (169) involves a word order change (SXV which indicates irrealis mood). The situation in (169) is interpreted as located in the future, posterior to SpT. This reading overrides the default pattern because 1) a bounded situation, as conveyed by perfective aspect, may not be located in the present, 2) SpT is the orientation point, and 3) the irrealis mood (realized by SXV word order), which conveys an unrealized situation, is indicated in the sentence. Following the pragmatic principles in (93), a future reading is yielded for (169). Remoteness distinctions within future are made by the use of different perfective aspects. In (169), the combination of General Perfective Aspect and irrealis mood renders the temporal interpretation of ‘later today.’
3.3 THE SYMMETRIC NATURE OF SOME DEICTIC TEMPORAL ADVERBIALS In this section, I discuss a set of temporal adverbials which indicate a temporal
distance relative to SpT that is symmetric with respect to the flow of time. That is, these adverbs simply refer to the absolute temporal distance from SpT, without specifying if the point lies in the future or the past. Temporal reference arises out of the combined meaning of tense morphology and these symmetric temporal adverbials.
In Iquito, there are no metrical (milliseconds, seconds, minutes, or hours) or calendrical (weeks, name of months, name of years) temporal expressions. Temporal divisions of the day (cf. §4) are based on the position of the sun and degree of darkness or sunlight. Finer temporal distinctions within the day are deictically given based on proximity to SpT.
The adverbials to be discussed are shown in the following table, arranged by temporal distance from the closest to the furthest with respect to SpT. It is worthy of note
116

that the numbers belonging to the same row indicate alternative orderings of the relevant expressions. The parentheses indicate the optionality of the use of the indicated morphemes. The morpheme -jina is a postposition used with expressions of temporal and spatial location.

within the RT span conveyed by the tense. The indicated temporal distance can precede SpT, as in (170)-(171), or follow SpT, as in (172)-(174). Examples (170) and (171) are perfective sentences, and in them, RT is prior to SpT. General Perfective Aspect is marked by a null alternant when a clitic follows, but a high pitch short vowel and a fairly sharp silence can be observed before the clitic =quiyaa(jaa). Please refer to a discussion of the allomorph of General Perfective Aspect in Chapter 5.

Examples (172)-(174) are imperfective sentences, where the Imperfective Aspect is indicated by the lengthened final vowel on the verbal root. In this context, RT follows SpT. Jaime commented that examples (172) and (173) are used when the person is already walking towards the direction of speaker.

We have already seen above that the adverbial ácariyaajaari can appear in several positions in the sentence. If it appears in sentence-final position, ácariyaajaari appears as a single phonological unit, as in (173) and (174). Although a grammatical object might intervene between ácari=yaa and jaari, as indicated in footnote 44, speakers prefer the form without interruption. If the part ácari appears before the verb, the clitic =yaa and jaari remain in the postverbal position and an additional qui45 appears in a sentence in Extended Current Tense, as in (170)-(172). Ácariyaajaari cannot appear entirely in the sentence-initial position, as in (175).

(175) *Ácari=yaa=jaari nu=ani-i-Ø. now=NWR=already 3S=come-IPFV-EC Right now he is coming.

interpretation ranges from ‘within half an hour’ to ‘on the same day.’ Example (176) is a perfective sentence, and RT is prior to SpT.

(177) Ácari nu=pajuu-yaa-Ø=quiyaajaa. now 3S=teach-IPFV-EC=NWR Fairly soon he is going to teach. He has been teaching since fairly recently.

Jaime commented that the following example could be used when the subject of the sentence might still be doing something else. In comparison to examples (172) and (173) above, the subject of example (178) is supposed to arrive later than the ones in those examples.

120

Adverbial (c), ácari (iina) niínaqui in the chart, refers to the nighttime hours46 on either side of the daylight hours which contain SpT. Thus it may refer either to the past night, as in (179), or the coming night, as in (180)-(182). When a sentence is uttered during the nighttime hours, the term iina niínaqui ‘this night’ is used and the word ácari ‘now, today’ is omitted, as in (183). This temporal adverbial is only used in a sentence of Extended Current Tense.

The following sentence was uttered in the morning and the adverbial refers to the coming night. Hermico used the irrealis word order plus General Perfective Aspect -qui. Jaime commented that he prefers to use Momentary Perfective Aspect -r++ instead, as in (181). This reflects the remoteness of future a speaker perceives, as well as tailors the use of the aspect and mood morphology.

Adverbial (d), amicaáca, means ‘one day away,’ indicating the temporal distance of one day from SpT. Having both past and future time reference, it can indicate either yesterday, as in (185) and (186), or tomorrow, as in (187) and (188). The precise interpretation of this term depends on aspect and mood morphology. In (185) and (186), the sentences are marked by Recent Past Tense and the term is interpreted as ‘yesterday.’ In (187) and (188), the sentences are in Extended Current Tense and the terms are interpreted as ‘tomorrow.’

Adverbial (e), huar+ta amicaáca, means ‘two days away,’ indicating a temporal distance of two days away from SpT. Therefore, it can refer either to the day before yesterday, as in (189), or to the day after tomorrow, as in (190).

Adverbial (f), taana yahu++ni-jina, literally means ‘on another day,’ and indicates a temporal distance of at least three days away from SpT. It can indicate a day in the recent past or in the near future, generally within two years from SpT. It is used either with Recent Past Tense to indicate the relevant temporal distance in the recent past, or with Extended Current Tense to indicate a similar distance in the future. The speakers use the determiner iina before the adverbial if they wish to specify a particular day or when they are counting the number of days by pointing to their fingers. The expression iina taana yahu++ni-jina varies freely with iina yahu++ni-jina taana.

Adverbial (g), taana casiiri-jina, means ‘another month,’ which indicates ‘a month’ other than the month which includes SpT. It is used either with Recent Past Tense, which gives an RT frame between yesterday to one to two years ago, to indicate some other month in the recent past, as in (197) and (198), or with Extended Current Tense to indicate some other month in the future within approximately two years from SpT, as in (199) and (200). As in the case of adverbial (f), consultants use the determiner iina when counting the number of months by pointing to their fingers, or when they seek to indicate a specific month. The expression iina taana casiiri-jina varies freely with iina casiiri-jina taana and iina-jina taana casiiri.

Within the RT frame of Recent Past Tense and Distant Past Tense, it indicates a situation realized in the morning of a particular day. As a rare case in aspectual morphology, the meaning of a temporal adverbial, ‘in the morning,’ is grammaticalized and incorporated into Remote Perfective Aspect as one of the two meanings discussed above. 51 The local Spanish word minga indicates a collaborative labor activity in which the host prepares food and drink for the people who assist him.

3.4 TEMPORAL DIVISIONS OF A DAY The expressions referring to the divisions of the day, as shown in the following
table, are based on the position of the sun and degree of darkness or sunlight. I discuss in the following the terms depicted in table 5.

The term yahu++ni is often described by the speakers as ‘when the sunlight comes out,’ i.e. ‘day time.’ However, as can be seen in line (a) of the above table, yahu++ni is also used to refer to a more general concept of ‘day,’ which includes nin++ni-+j+qu+ya ‘midnight,’ cutataani-ácuji ‘before sunrise,’ taaríqui ‘morning,’ yahu++ni-+j+qu+ya ‘midday,’ nin++ni-ácuji ‘afternoon’ and niínaqui ‘night.’ When speakers quantify the number of days for some purpose, the term yahu++ni is used to indicate an entire day-night cycle, corresponding roughly to a 24-hour period, as in núquiica yahu++ni ‘one day’ or p+y++ni yahu++ni ‘every day’ or ‘all day.’
We continue with the discussion of the terms niínaqui and nin++ni. Speakers use the term ácari iina niínaqui to refer to the two periods of darkness bracketing a given daylight period (line (b)), reflecting the overall symmetric nature of temporal remoteness meanings indicated by temporal adverbs in Iquito, as discussed in §3.3 of this chapter. The term ácari iina niínaqui can refer to either the night that has just passed, including nin++ni-+j+qu+ya ‘midnight’ and cutataani-ácuji ‘before sunrise,’ or the coming night. When talking about the portion of the prior night before midnight, the term amicaáca
52 Besides using the spoken terms here, speakers can always use hand gestures, by pointing to arc of the sun’s or moon’s path in sky, to indicate a more precise time of day.
129

niínaqui ‘yesterday night’ is used, together with Recent Past Tense. Line (c) reflects the non-deictic divisions of the day. When speaking of a number of nights, the term nin++ni is preferred (line (b)), meaning ‘night, to become dark.’ Speakers commented that niínaqui sounds odd when used in a numerical sense, further indicating that it sounds like “a darkness rather than a night.” In the following, I discuss this in more detail.
The term nin++ni, as an infinitival verb form, means ‘to become dark,’ signaling the coming of the night, as in (205).
(205) Jaa nu=nacar++-yaa-Ø nin++ni. already 3S=want-IPFV-EC become.dark.INF The night time is coming. It is about to become dark. Literally: It already wants to become dark.
To describe ‘become dark,’ due to dark clouds or other factors instead of sun-setting, during the day time, the verb niin+taani ‘to be dark’ is used, as in (206) and (207).
(206) Jaa nu=nacar++-yaa-Ø niin+taani. already 3S=want-IPFV-EC be.dark.INF It is about to become dark (because of some reason).
Sentence (207) in the following is used to describe the darkness in some part of the forest. It is very dark because it is under a lot of trees.
(207) Naaca-cari t++ iíti. Umaata iíti niin+ta-a-Ø. trees-below COP here very.much here be.dark-IPFV-EC 130

It is full of trees here. It is very dark here.

The term niínaqui means ‘dark; darkness.’ Sentence (208) describes the darkness in a cave. Sentence (209) refers to a dark area in a far distance. Sentence (210) describes the darkness in a house. It is seen that niinama is used instead of niínaqui because of its concordance with spatial deictics; this is, however, outside the scope of this dissertation and not discussed in detail here.

(208) Juura niínaqui t++ iíti sahuija-jina. really dark COP here cave-LOC It is really dark here in the cave.

(209) Niínaqui-iira t++ tíira. dark-GOAL COP there It is dark there.

1P.INCL=enter-ABL.PFV-EC DET-inside house

Niinama t++ naami iíta-jinacuma. dark COP inside house-inside We entered into that house. It is dark inside the house.

Hermico commented that sentence (209) has an alternative as in (211), which is of course understood by other speakers.
131

(211) Tíira niin+ta-a-Ø. there be.dark-IPFV-EC It is dark there.

As mentioned above, to refer to the portion of night prior to midnight, the term amicaáca niínaqui together with Recent Past Tense is used. Hermico, in explaining (212) recorded on the afternoon of the 4th of July, commented that the event of ‘writing a letter’ is understood to take place on the night of the 3rd of July around 8-10PM. It is seen that the Recent Past Tense -cura is used, indicating that it is not the part of the day which includes SpT.

(212) Amicaáca niínaqui qui=najuu-yaa-cura núquiica simiím+. one.day.away dark 1S=write-IPFV-RPST one letter Last night I was writing a letter.

In (213), the term ácari (iina) niínaqui is used to refer to the night time that has just passed. It can be seen that the sentence is in Extended Current Tense, indicating that it is considered to be part of the day which includes SpT.

132

I didn’t sleep well last night.

When quantifying the number of nights, speakers prefer to use the term nin++ni ‘night, to become dark,’ as in (214) and (215), although the term niínaqui ‘night, darkness’ can also be employed. Both Hermico and Jaime explained that (214) means “three times of becoming dark, I haven’t slept (literal translation)” while if the term niínaqui ‘night, darkness’ is used, it means “I haven’t slept in three darknesses (literal translation),” which sounds odd to them.

The term nin++ni-+j+qu+ya ‘midnight’ literally means ‘night’s halfway point,’ as speakers also used their hands to demonstrate a knife-cutting gesture when explaining this. Hermico commented that a given day starts at nin++ni-+j+qu+ya ‘midnight,’ which is consistent with the fact that a sentence containing such a temporal adverbial goes with Extended Current Tense, as in (216). He also said that by this time, most people have fallen asleep already. In addition, Jaime commented that ancient people knew when midnight was by observing the movement of the stars or the sound of different species of crickets which start to chirp at midnight. Sentence (216) is a
133

perfective one; it is interpreted as taking place on the same day which includes SpT. Midnight as the start of the current day also corresponds with the use of the temporal adverbial ácari iina niínaqui ‘this night’ which could be the previous or the following dark portion of the day. Ácari means ‘today’ or ‘now.’ Therefore, either the previous night or the coming night can be referred to as ‘tonight.’ A more precise reference is specified by an added relative clause.

The term yahu++ni-+j+qu+ya ‘midday’ indicates the time point when the sun is immediately above our heads and literally means ‘day’s halfway point.’ The term nin++ni-ácuji ‘afternoon’ indicates the portion of the day between the sun’s highest point and when the sun sets, and literally means ‘before becoming dark.’

One last important point for this section is the remoteness of time that speakers perceive when talking about the coming night. Speakers can freely choose to use the Imperfective Aspect (221), irrealis-mood word order with General Perfective Aspect (222), or irrealis-mood word order with Momentary Perfective Aspect (223), depending on how far they view it in terms of temporal distance, which of course also depends on the time of day when the sentence is uttered. If the sentence is uttered in the late afternoon, speakers most likely will use Imperfective Aspect while General or

53 Local Spanish gloss for the word nasi is ‘chacra,’ which is a vegetable- and fruit-cultivating field in which crops are cultivated, situated away from the village.
135

3.5 CONCLUSION In this chapter, I discussed the formal encoding of Iquito tense, the obligatory
status of tense and its interaction with temporal adverbials, temporal interpretation, the symmetric nature of a set of temporal adverbials, and the divisions of the day. Iquito displays a three-tense system. A number of remoteness distinctions are made in the prehodiernal past tenses, more finely distinguishing the localization of time prior to the day preceding SpT. Extended Current Tense is interesting in Iquito. On the one hand, it is obligatory and incompatible with temporal adverbials referring to a time outside its RT span. On the other hand, more precise temporal interpretation is inferred through aspects, which is a feature of tenseless languages. With respect to adverbials, a set of symmetric
136

temporal adverbials may be employed to make remoteness distinctions in terms of the temporal distance from SpT. Their use interacts with tense and aspect marking. Finally, the division of the day, according to the position of the sun and degree of darkness/sunlight, was described.

Chapter 4: Mood
4.1 INTRODUCTION This chapter discusses grammatical expressions of mood in Iquito, with a
language-specific focus on the realis/irrealis mood, including their morphosyntactic characteristics and semantic properties. I first define the term ‘mood’ used in this dissertation and distinguish it from the term ‘modality’ as both terms are used in the literature. I use the term mood to refer to a formally grammaticalized category which has a modal function; therefore, it is the grammatical expression of modality in languagespecific terms. Bybee, Perkins & Pagliuca (1994: 239) indicate that “mood categories are extremely difficult and extremely interesting, as they represent long chains of diachronic developments, and they interact with semantic, syntactic, and discourse parameters. Imposing binary distinctions and looking for the one semantic element that all uses have in common will not always yield useful results.” Bybee (1998: 262) states that “modality is a broad functional or conceptual domain, and certain focal points in this domain commonly take grammatical expressions in language-specific grams”…although “a major difficulty is encountered in giving a coherent characterization to the conceptual domain of modality.” Both of the above sources question the validity of realis/irrealis as a crosslinguistic grammatical category; however, the following three authors have argued differently. Mithun (1995: 368; 1999: 173) recognizes the binary distinction between realis and irrealis mood, indicating that the realis portrays situations as “actualized” or “having occurred or actually occurring” and that the irrealis portrays situations as “purely within the realm of thought.” Elliot (2000: 55) “argues for a grammatical category of reality status, which has two components, realis and irrealis, and which is intriguingly interrelated with other grammatical categories.” Palmer (2001: 2) concludes that “the idea
138

that notional features of realis and irrealis are grammaticalized as the typological categories of Realis and Irrealis is a useful one” while also recognizing that “there is variation, at a quite fundamental level, in the categories that are treated as Realis and Irrealis in different languages. One language may mark commands as Irrealis, another may mark them as Realis, while yet another may not treat them as part of a system of modality at all.” In light of the previous citations, the current dissertation adopts the binary terms realis/irrealis to best characterize the two contrastive constructions whose meanings—although I do not intend to assign a single meaning for this contrast—are definable under language-specific terms. In declarative, negative, interrogative and nonCF conditionals, realis mood is consistently used for non-future (i.e. past, present and immediate future) situations while irrealis mood is consistently used for future (i.e. later in the same day of SpT, the day following SpT, and further in the future) situations, reflecting the speaker’s assessment of time rather than certainty. In CF conditionals, embedded clauses of desiderative/timitive verbs, (including ‘want,’ ‘fear,’ among others), and a particular potential future/optative construction, realis mood never applies and the choice of irrealis mood reflects speaker’s assessment of factuality. The last two constructions, desiderative/timitive and potential future/optative, arguably reflect the speaker’s assessment of both time and factuality.
As formal categories, moods vary from language to language with respect to number of markers and what modal distinctions are grammaticalized. Crosslinguistically frequent grammatical types include conditionals and imperatives, among others (Bybee and Fleischman 1995: 2). They are expressed in language in a variety of ways: morphological, lexical, syntactic, or via intonation (Bybee and Fleischman, 1995). Elliott (2000:64-66) comments that “reality status is not marked by the same kind of morphosyntactic device in all languages, although by far the most common device used is
139

verbal affixation of some kind” and includes simple affixation, portmanteau affixation, particles, and enclitics as types of marking. Palmer (2001[1986]) also comments that inflectional mood is a very clear example of grammatical marking and the markers of modality may be modal verbs, clitics or particles. However, he also points out that modality is not necessarily marked in the verbal element, nor is there any obvious reason why it should be, apart from the fact that the verb is the most central part of the sentence. He further indicates that moods, the grammaticalized attitudes and beliefs of the speaker, are less associated with the verb, but have more to do with the whole sentence. Crosslinguistically, it should not be surprising, although it is uncommon, that mood and modality can be marked outside the verbal complex. In this dissertation, I introduce the grammatical strategy of Iquito realis/irrealis mood (i.e. SVX word order vs. SXV word order in combination with vowel-hiatus resolution) and propose to include ‘word order change,’ a crosslinguistically uncommon means, as a grammatical type of mood marking in linguistic typology.
Two grammatical moods are found in Iquito: realis and irrealis mood. Each Iquito sentence expresses either realis or irrealis mood. Irrealis mood imposes structural variations on certain constructions due to its unique grammatical strategy—SXV word order and vowel-hiatus resolution—which especially affects negation constructions, conditionals and counterfactual sentences, desideratives, imperatives and jussives. This chapter is organized as follows: §4.2 discusses these two grammatical moods in terms of the structural differences between them and the semantic contexts in which they appear; §4.3 discusses negation constructions and their structural realization influenced by mood; §4.4 deals with conditionals and counterfactuality; §4.5 discusses CF wishes54 and desideratives because ‘CF wish’ is a topic commonly disccused together with other
54 “CF wish” is a common term used in the literature of conditionals and counterfactuality, such as in Iatridou (2000), among others.
140

counterfactual constructions; §4.6 discusses imperatives and jussives; §4.7 concludes this chapter.
4.2 GRAMMATICAL MOOD: REALIS AND IRREALIS
Iquito has a grammaticalized realis/irrealis mood which is expressed by a typologically uncommon strategy, word order change and vowel-hiatus resolution.55 The basic word order in Iquito is SVO, which appears in all finite clauses with realis mood. Irrealis mood in finite clauses,56 however, generally requires an element to occupy the position between the subject and the verb, resulting in SXV word order. The X position in an SXV order can be filled by an indefinite grammatical object, an adverb, or the determiner of a definite object phrase, among others (Anderson et al., 2006). To add to what is proposed in this literature, I propose that when the X position is not filled by an overt lexical item, the vowel-hiatus resolution strategy between S and V is blocked. Because the SXV order conveys the irrealis meaning and imposes syntactic restrictions on the overall sentence structure, mood in Iquito can be viewed as a grammaticalized category. Following Bybee (1998: 264), I consider the entire SXV construction as being responsible for expressing irrealis mood.57 The binary terms ‘realis’ and ‘irrealis’ are used in this dissertation because these two specific terms are useful, as promoted by many linguists (Elliot 2000; Mithun 1995, 1999; Palmer 2001), in this case to best characterize two constructions which systematically apply to clauses with certain modal functions. ‘Realis’ and ‘irrealis,’ however, do not correspond exactly in meaning to real
55 Please refer to Huamancayo (2003), which specifically discusses vowel hiatus resolution in Iquito. Also see footnote 24 for more information. 56 In complex sentences which contain embedded infinitival clauses, the word order is neutralized to SV….OV (i.e. with no interrupting element between the subject and the main verb), regardless of mood. Please see §4.2.3 for more discussion. 57 For a theoretical analysis of irrealis mood, please refer to Anderson et al. (2006).

Realis mood, realized by SVX word order, is used in affirmative and negative declaratives, interrogatives and non-CF conditionals for mostly non-future situations.58 In declaratives, the situation in clauses with realis mood is realized, being realized, or will be realized in the immediate future. In Iquito, negation, interrogatives, and non-CF conditionals do not impinge on the choice between realis and irrealis mood. Irrealis mood, realized by SXV word order or with vowel-hiatus resolution strategy blocked in the case of intransitive clauses, is used in non-immediate future declaratives, interrogatives and non-CF conditionals. In addition, it is used in all the CF conditionals, including past and present CF, together with an additional CF morpheme (+)t+-, a particular potential future/optative construction, and desideratives/timitives. In the second group of contexts, the choice of irrealis mood appears to depend on speaker’s assessment of factuality. Imperatives show structural characteristics of both realis and irrealis mood. This dissertation, therefore, does not intend to assign a single meaning for either realis or irrealis mood, but uses these language-specific terms to characterize the two constructions in which two different types of word orders are used. I introduce the grammatical strategy by which the Iquito language expresses mood and propose to include ‘word order change’ as a grammatical type of mood marking in linguistic typology.
In §4.2.1, I focus on the structural differences of realis (SVX order) and irrealis (SXV order) clauses and the syntactic restrictions of irrealis mood constructions. Later in §4.2.2, I introduce the semantic contexts to which realis and irrealis mood apply. Most of
58 Situations in the immediate future which is expected to be realized immediately following the SpT is expressed by realis mood in combination with the Imperfective Aspect. It is noted that the choice between realis and irrealis here has to do with a speaker’s assessment of time instead of certainty about the future event. A sentence, indicating a situation in the immediate future and expressed by realis mood, can include an epistemic adverbial, such as ‘perhaps’ while a sentence, indicating a situation in the near future (i.e. occurring later on the same day of SpT for some speakers, the day following the SpT or later), always displays irrealis mood regardless of how certain the speaker is about the situation referred in the sentence.
142

these contexts are discussed in detail in subsequent sections. In §4.2.3, I propose possible origins and motivations of word order change.

4.2.1 The Structural Characteristics of Realis and Irrealis Mood The clauses with realis mood display SVX word order, with no element allowed
to appear between the subject and the verb. In addition, vowel-hiatus resolution, detailed below, appears in realis clauses. In contrast, clauses with irrealis mood display SXV word order, with an element (X) standing between the subject (S) and the verb (V). The categories that can appear in this X position are summarized in table 6. It is noted that this position is not always filled by a lexical element if the verb is intransitive. Under such circumstances, the interpretation of realis or irrealis mood is determined by the blockage of vowel hiatus, or by pragmatic knowledge.

59 This, applying to both transitive and intransitive clauses, includes postpositional phrases (noun plus postpositional clitic) or determiner plus postpositional clitic, leaving the nominal phrase in the postverbal position. The list here is representative. For an exhaustive list of the possible types of elements, please refer to Anderson et al. (2006). 60 This, applying to both transitive and intransitive verbs, appears in complementizer-type clauses, including wh-questions and subordinate clauses, when nothing appears between the subject and the verb. In Iquito, clausal negation is sensitive to clause types, please refer to §4.3 for a detailed discussion.
143

In a transitive clause, the types of elements that can appear in the X position include an indefinite grammatical object or pronoun, the determiner of the definite object, adverbs, adverbial phrases, postpositional phrases consisting of a noun plus a postpositional clitic, a determiner plus a postpositional clitic, and negative particles if no other elements appear in such a position. What cannot go in the X position is a complete nominal phrase or postpositional phrase containing a determiner. To be exact, [a determiner plus noun]61, as a definite object, cannot appear in the X position, but [an indefinite article, or a modifier, plus noun] can.
As can be seen in (224) and (225), an indefinite grammatical object or a pronominal object, respectively, can appear between the subject and the verb of an irrealis clause. In realis clauses, they appear in the postverbal position, as can be compared with (1), (2), and (4).

61 Cynthia Anderson Hansen pointed out that “if a determiner plus noun is part of a possessive phrase, such a combination can occur in the X position.” She also provided the following example. The abbreviations were adapted to mine.

62 The Momentary Perfective r++, when used in the irrealis mood, is observed to be acoustically longer with level tone (the term level tone is suggested by Cynthia Anderson Hansen); when it is used in the realis mood, it is observed to be acoustically shorter with contour falling tone. At this point, I am not sure if such a difference in length and tone is associated with irrealis mood on the syntactic level, or with the morpheme r++ itself. If it is associated with irrealis mood, then no matter which aspectual morpheme is used in the irrealis mood, such a difference should apply to it impartially. However, if it is associated with the morpheme r++, then the r++ used in the irrealis mood should be considered as a different morpheme than the one used in the realis mood. Unfortunately, I do not have enough data to prove either view at this point in my research.

Sentence (226) shows that the X position can be filled by the determiner of the definite object. The pronoun nu ‘3S’ is the resumptive pronoun of the topicalized subject iina icuani ‘that man.’ The determiner iina that follows the resumptive pronoun forms a complete definite object phrase with the postverbal noun pápaaja ‘fish.’ It is ungrammatical if the entire definite object noun phrase appears in the X position, as in (227).

In (228), an adverb is in the topic position, which is always in the clause-initial position, followed by a subject pronoun, subsequently followed by a determiner pertaining to a definite object phrase.

Sentences (229) and (230) show that an adverb can appear in the X position of an irrealis clause. In a realis clause, an adverb must appear in the pre-subject or postverbal position, as in (914), (610), and text 3: line 214. For a full treatment of adverb order, please refer to Hansen (2006).

Besides the above-mentioned elements, the negative particle can also appear in the X position in certain types of clauses63 (i.e. interrogatives, subordinate clauses) under irrealis mood. First, we see a negative interrogative clause in realis mood, as in (231). Negation is expressed through a negative morpheme marked on the verb and a negative particle in the postverbal position.

Interrogative sentences (232) and (233), show that when the object appears at the beginning of the sentence as a wh-word, as in (232), or remains in the postverbal position, as in (233), the negative particle caa has to be copied to appear in the X position, otherwise the sentence is ungrammatical. When a copy of the negative particle caa appears in the X position, the postverbal caa can appear optionally without changing the grammaticality of the sentence.

The X position in an intransitive clause, however, is not always filled by a lexical element. When it is not, vowel-hiatus resolution strategy is blocked. Iquito exhibits a phonotactic constraint against heteromorphemic vowel hiatus within a phonological

149

word.65 If a preverbal element is monosyllabic, it cliticizes rightward to the verbal complex. As a result, it is pronounced together with the verbal complex as a continuous sound stream. In a realis clause, the quality of adjacent vowels of the preverbal and verbal elements is resolved by assimilation or alteration of the vowel. Instances of underlying vowel hiatus are resolved by glide formation, vowel deletion, or vowel fusion, depending on the morphemes and the qualities of the vowels involved. In realis clauses, non-focal subject pronouns generally form a phonological word with their associated verb (i.e. they behave like phonological clitics). If the verb root in question is vowelinitial, heteromorphemic vowel hiatus typically results, and one of the hiatus resolution processes just mentioned takes place. In irrealis clauses, however, non-focal subject pronouns typically do not cliticize to their associated verb. In cases in which an overt element intervenes between the subject pronoun and the verb, the subject pronoun normally cliticizes to the intervening element, instead of to the verb. Crucially, the subject pronoun, even if there is no intervening element (e.g. in the case of an intransitive verb in a clause with no adjuncts), still appears not to cliticize to the verb. Specifically, the normal rules of vowel-hiatus resolution strategy are blocked, as if the subject pronoun and the verb independently form separate phonological words. In slow or careful speech a brief pause may even be audible between the subject pronoun and the verb. That is to say, in the irrealis clause, it is observed that the quality of adjacent vowels remains intact, as if there is an implicit element in the X position that blocks the vowel hiatus.
In realis mood, as in (241), the vowel /i/ in iisa- ‘urinate’ changes to /+/, and the sentence means ‘we went there to urinate in the morning.’ If the sentence is an irrealis one, as in (242), the vowel /i/ does not assimilate to the preceding vowel (i.e. the

sequence [+] and [i] is heard), and the sentence means ‘we will go to Iquitos tomorrow.’ This phenomenon, in addition to other pragmatic factors in the discourse, contributes to disambiguating whether an intransitive clause receives a realis or irrealis interpretation.

4.2.2 The Semantic Contexts of Realis and Irrealis Mood The semantic contexts in which realis and irrealis mood appear are first
summarized in the following table.

later on the same day of SpT, the daycounterfactual, emotions and

following SpT, or even later)

wishes/weak prediction)

Semantic basis and observations:

For contexts in group 1, the choice between realis and irrealis mood reflects speaker’s

assessment of time. The speaker might be certain or uncertain about a particular situation

in the immediate future, but realis mood is chosen with an optional usage of the epistemic

adverb cuuta ‘perhaps.’ If the situation in the sentence is understood to be realized

tomorrow, the day following SpT, the irrealis mood is chosen, regardless of how certain

the speaker is about the situation.

For contexts in group 2, the choice reflects the speaker’s assessment of factuality. The choice of irrealis mood in desideratives/timitives and potential future/optative arguably represent the assessment of both time and factuality.

In Iquito, realis mood (realized as SVX word order) is used in past and present affirmative declarative sentences, as in (243) and (244). In (243), the subject is a pronoun qui ‘1S’ which cliticizes66 onto the verbal complex. The verbal complex contains the verbal root pani- ‘search,’ General Perfective Aspect, and the Extended Current Tense, zero-morpheme. The object is an indefinite nominal phrase, consisting of the indefinite article núquiica ‘one’ and the noun anitáaqui ‘peccary,’ an animal people hunt in the Amazon for food. This sentence receives a past interpretation. Sentence (244), besides the present interpretation, also receives an immediate-future interpretation, meaning ‘he will be reading this book now.’

In addition to affirmative declaratives, realis mood is also used in past and present negative declaratives (245), as well as interrogatives, including yes-no questions (246) and wh-questions (247). The following three sentences all have SVO word order, with subject pronouns preceding verbs in (245) and (246), and a subject interrogative pronoun preceding the verb in (245).

Finally, realis mood can also be used in non-CF conditionals to refer to non-future situations. The difference between conditionals and the sentences discussed above is that there is an additional non-assertive formative or epistemic adverbial appearing in conditionals. Sentence (248) is a non-CF conditional, referring to a habitual pattern of situations, and realis mood is used. Sentence (249) is also a non-CF conditional. The consequent clause refers to a future situation and the irrealis mood is used. The paired clauses present the sequentiality between the situation in the antecedent and that in the consequent, due to the perfective aspect. The antecedent refers to a time preceding that of the consequent and the realis mood is used.

Sentence (250) is another non-CF conditional. The antecedent refers to a situation in the recent past and the consequent refers to a situation in the present.

If he drank it (yesterday), he is probably recovering now.

In the above-mentioned contexts (i.e. affirmative and negative declaratives, interrogatives, and non-CF conditionals), the situation in the sentence is in the past, present, or immediate future. As such, realis mood seems to align with perception or assessment of time, rather than with assertion.
When the situation in the sentences is in non-immediate future (i.e. from as soon as later on the same day of SpT to the more remote future), irrealis mood is used. Again, this applies to both affirmative and negative declaratives, interrogatives, and non-CF conditionals. Sentence (251) refers to a situation which the speaker states that he will realize later in the same day of SpT. As can be seen, the subject qui ‘1S’ is followed by the object núquiica anitáaqui ‘a peccary,’ followed by the verb pani- ‘search.’ The sentence displays SOV word order, expressing irrealis mood.

When the event is understood to occur in the more remote future, ranging from within a month to a few months of SpT, Remote Perfective Aspect in combination with the irrealis mood is used, as in (253).

(253) Qui=núquiica anitáaqui pani-maa-Ø

1S=one

peccary search-REM.PFV-EC 1S=kill.INF=GOAL 3S

A particular potential future/optative construction is used to refer to situations in the even more distant future. Such a construction is strictly used to express the first person’s (i.e.
156

speaker’s) wish or prediction which imposes on the action of other people, usually the subject of the sentence. In such a construction, irrealis mood, in combination with Imperfective Aspect -yaa and the potential future marker -cuma, is used. The situation in such sentences might or might not be realized in the distant future, as in (254) and (255). The choice of irrealis mood in this particular construction can be argued to reflect the speaker’s assessment of both time and factuality.

(254) Tácari yahu++ni=jina quia=cuhuaa amuu-yaa-cuma. other day=LOC 2S=meat kill-IPFV-POT Someday you will kill animals.

Whether a future situation is presented as in the immediate future, realis mood with Imperfective Aspect (244), or as in the near future, irrealis mood with General Perfective Aspect (251), reflects the speaker’s assessment of time (whether he views the situation as close or more distant from SpT). As Chafe (1995: 363) points out, the realisirrealis distinction reflects judgments that certain ideas stem from direct perception, memory, or expectation of what is normal, while others have their source in imagination. He also comments (1995: 358) that reality is not a binary but a gradient dimension and that speakers may have a relatively stronger expectation that commands will be obeyed or that predicted events will take place. I believe, then, that the choice of realis or irrealis word order, reflecting speakers’ perception and assessment of time, in certain sentences
157

of Iquito, is one of the flexible areas and that the realis-irrealis division along the reality continuum also varies from language to language.
In the following contexts in which irrealis mood is used, I show that it aligns with speakers’ assessment of factuality (i.e. counterfactual,67 desideratives/timitives, and potential future/optative as in (254) and (255) above). Desideratives/timitives and potential future/optative constructions arguably reflect a speaker’s assessment of both time and factuality.
In addition to declaratives and interrogatives of future situations, irrealis mood is also used in CF conditionals. Sentence (256) is a CF conditional, consisting of a CF antecedent clause of a recent past situation, and a present CF consequent clause. As can be seen, the subject is followed by a CF morpheme, followed by the object, displaying SOV order. In (257), the element following the CF morpheme in the antecedent is an adverb, and that in the consequent is a determiner of an object phrase. Different types of elements can fill the position between the subject and the verb in an irrealis clause. This is discussed in more detail in §4.2.2.

CF wish, detailed in §4.5.3 of this chapter, is structurally entirely different from CF conditionals. It does not involve irrealis word order and is expressed by a type of imperative, consisting of a main verb and the causative and counterfactual markers (259), to express the speaker’s wish. The first person can be an affected party in the situation or not. Speakers commented that (259) is the sentence they speak in their mind when the situation at present is that the woman is not drinking masato and they wish the contrary.

(259) T+=rari-t++-r++

itíniija nuu!

CF=drink-CAU-MMT.PFV masato 3S

I wish she could drink masato!

(Literally: Would it make her drink masato!)

Irrealis word order appears in the subordinate clauses of desiderative/timitive verbs. The matrix verb of (260) and (261) is nacar++- ‘want/like/hope’ and the subordinated finite clause, as indicated by square brackets, exhibits irrealis word order.

(260) Qui=nacar++-yaa-Ø [Ima=asuraaja asa-qui-Ø]. 1S= want-IPFV-EC Ema=yuca eat-PFV-EC I hope that Ema will eat yuca. 159

(261) Qui=nacar++-yaa-Ø [iina maaya qui= niqui-qui-Ø]. 1S=want-IPFV-EC DET child 1S=see-PFV-EC I want that child to see me.

Sentence (262) is analyzed as taking a non-finite participle phrase as the object and hence does not use the irrealis word order.

(262) Qui=nacar++-yaa-Ø Ima asaani=iira asuraaja. 1S=want-IPFV-EC Ema eat.INF=GOAL yuca I want Ema to eat yuca.

In (263), qu+r++- ‘fear’ is the matrix verb and the subordinate clause also exhibits irrealis word order. In the subordinate clause, iina m+yaara ‘that dog’ is in the topic position and the resumptive subject pronoun nu ‘3S’ precedes the definite article of the object.

(263) Qui=qu+r++-yaa-Ø [iina m+yaara nu=iina s++naqui-qui-Ø icuani].

1S=fear-IPFV-EC DET dog

3S=DET bite-PFV-EC man

I am afraid that that dog might bite that man.

The last point of this section concerns the imperative68 construction. Whether
imperatives are assigned to realis or irrealis mood in Iquito is an on-going question as
they demonstrate structural characteristics of both grammatical moods. An alternative
68 I use the term ‘imperative’ in the sense of directive illocutionary force, here including first person plural hortative, second person singular imperative, and second person plural imperative constructions.
160

view is that it might not be treated as part of the realis/irrealis system. Realis clauses display SVX word order and present vowel-hiatus resolution. Irrealis clauses, on the other hand, generally require an element to occupy the position between the subject and the verb. The X position is not always filled by a lexical element if the verb is intransitive, and the vowel-hiatus resolution strategy is blocked. Interestingly, in imperatives of intransitive verbs, as in (264), vowel hiatus resolution is also suspended (i.e. two vowels are pronounced distinctively), resembling the phonological characteristics of irrealis mood constructions. However, in imperatives of transitive verbs, as in (265), the object follows the verb, displaying SVO word order, resembling the syntactic characteristics of realis mood constructions. It is ungrammatical if the object appears between the subject and the verb in an imperative. Mood assignment in Iquito imperatives is, therefore, an on-going puzzle at this point of research.

As discussed in this section, the terms realis and irrealis are chosen because they represent two distinct constructions which consistently coincide with constructions of certain modal functions. However, the terms are not chosen to present a strictly semantic
161

contrast between real and unreal situations. Therefore, the terms are to some extent language-specific.

4.2.3 Possible Origins69 of Irrealis Word order Expressing mood through word order change is typologically unusual and
interesting. So far, there has not been another language reported in the literature that utilizes a comparable approach. Irrealis word order in Iquito might be the result of a word order retention or word order change through historical development. That is to say, it is possible that 1) SOV (i.e. as one of the varieties of SXV word order) is the old word order and is retained in infinitival clauses as well as retained in or extended to irrealis clauses, or that 2) SVO has been the word order and SXV is a new strategy in irrealis clauses.
Synchronically, in all sentences with a complex verbal predicate, such as those including embedded infinitival clauses (although not in all kinds of subordinated clauses) besides the main verb, the word order does not display a straightforward SVO pattern. Instead, it exhibits a SV(V)...OV pattern. Given the fact that infinitival clauses, which have an ‘irrealis-like’ (i.e. talking about unrealized situations) element, it is not difficult to understand why two types of clauses could share the same word-order pattern. Examples (266) and (267) are sentences in realis mood with complex verbal phrases.

It is seen that all three sentences above with complex predicates display the same word order pattern—SV(V)…OV. Mood is only expressed in the finite clause and does not determine the order of the non-finite clause since the grammatical information of finiteness is not relevant. In addition, because the subject of the verb in a non-finite clause is not always present and, therefore, there is no condition of talking about mood construction, which is based principally on the adjacency of subject and verb. The word order of non-finite clauses can be variable. The following three sentences have their embedded clauses as non-finite.
163

(269) Qui=nacar++-yaa-Ø quia=asaani=iira iina papaaja. 1S=want-IPFV-EC 2S=eat.INF=GOAL DET fish I want you to eat that fish.
(270) Qui=nacar++-yaa-Ø papaaja asaani. 1S=want-IPFV-EC fish eat.INF I want to eat fish.
(271) Qui=nacar++-yaa-Ø iina asaani papaaja. 1S=want-IPFV-EC DET eat.INF fish I want to eat that fish.
If we can consider the effect of raising and control, in the case of English, it is noted that the big PRO actually occupy a space. Applying to the case in Iquito, however, we found out that subject control does not seem to occupy a space. For sentences (269) to (271), we might be able to give the following analyses. In (269), the subject of the infinitival clause is present, followed by the infinitive verb, followed by the full NP object. In (270), the subject of the infinitival clause is controlled by the principal clause; the space is not occupied; the next NP, which is indefinite, raises. In (271), the subject of the infinitival clause is controlled by the principal clause; the space is not occupied; the next NP is definite, so only the determiner raises. This structure is in a sense reminiscent of a finite intransitive clause, as in (272) and (273).
(272) Iina maqui-i-Ø icuani. 164

DET sleep-IPFV-EC man That man is sleeping.
(273) Icuani maqui-i-Ø. man sleep-IPFV-EC A man is sleeping.
In addition to subordinate clauses, Iquito also displays numerous unexpected OV correlations in terms of word order typology as discussed in Dryer (1991, 1992): (1) it uses postpositions instead of prepositions; (2) the time/aspect (aux) information follows the verbal root, utilizing suffixes instead of prefixes; (3) in possessive noun phrases, the genitive precedes the noun instead of following it; (4) and finally, the copula verb follows the predicate instead of preceding it. According to typological studies, languages tend to retain their old word order in embedded clauses. Iquito, therefore, could have once been an OV language. However, what remains to be confirmed is the motivation of such a change of basic word order and why SOV, a variety of SXV word order, is retained in irrealis clauses. Two explanations are offered in the following. One is that in sentences with S[V(V)….OV] constituent order, all elements after the subject through the sentencefinal verb historically constitute a complex object phrase, with the final verb as the principal verb. Throughout the historical development, some non-principal lexical verbs were frequently used and grammaticalized into tense and aspect morphemes, resulting in grammatical morphemes being positioned in the post-subject position and motivating the SVO word order in the simple clause. The other possible explanation is that the word order change in the simple clause is a relatively recent and drastic innovation because SVO word order, distributively more restricted, only appears in the realis simple clause.
165

The motivation of this might be a calque of Spanish sentence structure from the recent acquisition of the Spanish language. Both options are possible. However, one synchronic observation is that Arabela, which supposedly forms a branch of the Zaparoan family with Andoa, is predominantly SOV while Záparo, which supposedly forms a branch with Iquito, is SVO. SVO word order is therefore a shared innovation, if indeed a new word order, within the Záparo-Iquito branch. However, an Iquito text in Beuchat and Rivet in the 18th century displays SVO order (Lev Michael, p.c.). The above discussion suggests language contact is a less likely scenario since all Zaparoan languages have contact with Spanish, but present distinct synchronic facts. If SOV is indeed the old word order and SVO is a new word order, the motivation of such a change remains to be a topic for future research.
The other possible word-order development is that SVO has been the basic word order and that SXV is a new strategy in irrealis clauses and a new phenomenon in embedded infinitival clauses and complex predicate contexts. Complex predicates, especially complements of cognition verbs and the like, might plausibly be associated with irrealis mood (Patience Epps, p.c.). Here the explanation needed is the mechanism of such a word-order-change strategy. Hopper and Thompson (1980) correlate variations in word order and relative verbal transitivity, such as noun incorporation, with affectedness or individuation of object, which is also associated with irrealis mood. It is, therefore, that noun incorporation is the drive of SVO to SXV change. However, this scenario seems unlikely since there is almost no noun incorporation in Iquito, which is distinct from most of the Amazonian languages. The motivation of SVO to SXV change also remains to be a topic for future research.
§4.2 above gives an outline of the Iquito irrealis mood. It discusses the structural facts of the realis and irrealis word order, and the kinds of semantic contexts in which
166

each mood is employed. Iquito evidently adopts an extremely uncommon strategy, word order change, to encode the irrealis mood. The present study proposes to include this as one of the grammatical types by which modality can be expressed typologically. The discussion of this section also attempts to trace the origin of this uncommon means from a typological approach on word-order correlations. It is suggested that the earlier word order of Iquito might have been SOV and it gradually developed into SVO word order. This section also establishes that the choice of the terms realis and irrealis is based on the fact that these two terms represent two different constructions which are consistently used in sentences of different modal functions.
4.3 NEGATION AND MOOD This section discusses clausal negation. Following the discussion in §4.2,
negation aligns with neither realis nor irrealis mood. The choice of realis or irrealis mood depends on the temporal reference of the sentence; there is, therefore, no direct semantic interaction or correlation between negation and mood. However, since the X position of SXV word order, expressing irrealis mood, can be filled by a negative particle in an irrealis clause, there is a certain structural interaction between negation and mood that is worthy of discussion. This section includes only examples from declaratives and interrogatives because other types of clauses, such as imperatives, use a completely different negative morpheme and display a different syntactic structure. Negative imperatives (i.e. prohibitives) are discussed in §4.6. Clausal negation in Iquito adopts two strategies, one in matrix clauses and the other in subordinate clauses. The current negation section discusses the matrix-clause strategy in §4.3.1, and the subordinateclause strategy70 in §4.3.2. In §4.3.3, I discuss the scope of negation and the function of
70 Anderson (2004b) discusses the Iquito negation in subordinate clauses extensively.
167

different negation strategies in terms of empirical contexts based on the interpretation of the perception of the speakers. The current negation section does not include a theoretical analysis of negation structure. For a proposed theoretical analysis, please refer to Lai (2006b) for more discussion.
There are two principal strategies of clausal negation in Iquito: one uses the negative particle caa (referred to as caa negation hereafter) and the other uses the negative morpheme -ji in combination with the negative particle caa (referred to as ji-caa negation hereafter). In caa negation, the negative particle caa precedes a pronominal subject or a non-topicalized subject phrase, and follows a topicalized element if any. This strategy is generally used in principal/independent declarative clauses and yes/no questions. In ji-caa negation, the negative particle caa follows an inflected verb, in which the verbal root is followed by the negative morpheme -ji, followed by tense and aspect information. This strategy is generally used in wh-questions, relative clauses, and embedded clauses of cleft constructions. While caa negation does not have variation in irrealis mood, ji-caa negation varies structurally in irrealis clauses. The negative particle caa in ji-caa negation may appear repetitively in the postverbal position as well as in preverbal position if no other elements appear between the subject and the verb of an irrealis clause (detailed in §4.3.2). In adverbial and complement clauses, either one of these two strategies can be used.
4.3.1 Caa Negation Caa negation uses the negative particle caa in the pre-subject position to negate
an entire clause. It is used in matrix clauses of declarative sentences and yes-no questions. Diagram 6 below shows the structural position of caa in relation to other
168

constituents of the clause. When there is a topic element in the negative clause, caa follows this element; otherwise, it precedes a non-topic element.
Diagram 6. The Schematic Structure of Caa Negation {topic} caa71 {pronominal or non-topicalized subject} {verbal complex} {object}
The negative particle caa can precede a pronominal subject, as can be seen in (274). The sentence consists of an independent declarative clause, in which only caa is used to negate the entire clause. No other negation marking is found on the verb.
(274) Caa qui=niqui-Ø-cura iina icuani. NEG 1S=see-PFV-RPST DET man I didn’t see that man.
The negative particle in caa negation can also precede a non-topicalized subject. As can be seen in (275), caa precedes the nominal subject which is not topicalized.
(275) Caa m+saji niqui-Ø-cura iina icuani. NEG woman see-PFV-RPST DET man The woman did not see that man.
71 Cynthia Anderson Hansen reminded me to add this information.The negative particle caa here is in focus position and cannot co-occur with a focused element: Adverb occurs in focus position, as in (302); with the introduction of negation, adverb occurs after the object, as in (303).
169

Caa follows a topicalized element, if there is one in the clause, and precedes the resumptive subject pronoun, as in (276).

(276) Iina m+saji caa nu=niqui-Ø-cura iina icuani. DET woman NEG 3S=see-PFV-RPST DET man That woman did not see that man.

Besides independent declarative sentences, caa is also used in the principal clause of a complex clause construction, as can be seen in (277).

(277) Caa qui=niqui-Ø-cura iina icuani [ Ø sir+ta-Ø-cura

asúraaja].

NEG 1S=see-PFV-RPST DET man REL take.out-PFV-RPST yuca

I didn’t see that man who took out the yuca.

The last type of clause in which caa negation is used is in yes-no questions. As can be seen in (278), caa precedes the pronominal subject even if the sentence is a question. Yes-no questions and declarative sentences are structurally the same in Iquito. The only difference resides in the intonation contour at the end of the sentence, with yesno questions displaying a rising pattern.

(278) ¿Caa quia=niqui-Ø-cura iina icuani? NEG 2S=see-PFV-RPST DET man Didn’t you see that man?

170

The final point of caa negation is that the negative structure is not sensitive to mood. That is to say, the syntactic position of the negative particle does not vary because of the grammatical mood. Sentence (276) expresses realis mood (SVX word order), with General Perfective Aspect and Recent Past Tense, while sentence (279) expresses irrealis mood (SXV order), with Momentary Perfective Aspect and Extended Current Tense. The negative particle caa in both sentences follows the topicalized element and precedes the pronominal subject, remaining in the same position structurally.
(279) Iina icuani caa nu=m+saji niqui-r++-Ø. DET man NEG 3S=woman see-MMT.PFV-EC That man will not see a woman.
From the examples shown above, we see that caa negation is not sensitive to tense, aspect, or mood. The syntactic position of the negative particle remains the same, following a topic element and preceding a pronominal or non-topicalized subject.
4.3.2 Ji-caa Negation Ji-caa negation uses the negative particle caa, plus an additional negative
morpheme -ji attached to the verb root, to negate a clause. This strategy is used in the following types of clauses: wh-questions, relative clauses, and embedded clauses of cleft constructions. Complement and adverbial clauses can adopt either caa negation or ji-caa negation. In ji-caa negation, both -ji and caa contribute to the negation meaning. The negative marker -ji is a portmanteau morpheme which encodes both the negation and the clause-type information. The fact that it also conveys the negation meaning is supported by two pieces of evidence. First, it is ungrammatical for it to appear in an affirmative
171

clause; second, in some cases, caa is omitted while the clause still retains its negation meaning. It is possible to consider ji-caa negation as a type of negative agreement since it agrees with the type of the clause it occurs. However, it is unlike a typical inflectional agreement marker for the following reasons. First, it cannot appear freely in any negative clause, but only in wh-questions, relative clauses, and embedded clauses of cleft constructions. Second, it attaches to the root (as opposed to stem) form of the verb, which indicates that it behaves more like a derivational morpheme in Iquito. Diagram 7 shows that the negative particle caa follows the inflected verb and the negative morpheme -ji is suffixed to the verbal root, preceding tense and aspect information.

Diagram 7. The Schematic Structure of Ji-caa Negation {subject} {verbal root-ji-aspect-tense} caa {object and other adverbial phrases}

Ji-caa negation presents many variations in irrealis clauses. I discuss the basic pattern of ji-caa negation and its variations below.
In the types of clauses introduced above, the negative particle caa follows the verb. As can be seen in (280) which is a wh-question, caa is in the postverbal position and -ji is marked after the verbal root, as part of the verbal complex. It is noted that -ji appears after the verbal root to which only derivational morphemes attach. This suggests that in Iquito -ji is considered a derivational morpheme.

Who didn’t grab fish?

172

In addition to wh-questions, relative clauses also adopt ji-caa negation. As can be seen in (281), this sentence consists of a principal clause and a relative clause. In the principal clause, the negative particle caa precedes the pronominal subject and in the relative clause, caa follows the verb which is additionally marked with -ji.

(281) Iina m+saji caa nu=niqui-qui-Ø iina icuani DET woman NEG 3S=see-PFV-EC DET man

(iina) nacusi-ji-qui-Ø

caa umaata.

REL know-SUB.NEG-PFV-EC NEG much

That woman did not see the man who did not know a lot.

Embedded clauses of cleft constructions also adopt ji-caa negation. As can be seen in (282), negation in the embedded clause uses ji-caa negation.

(282) Caa t++ iina m+saji (iina) niqui-ji-Ø-cura

caa iina icuani.

NEG COP DET woman REL see-SUB.NEG-RPST NEG DET man

It is not that woman who did not see that man.

Unlike caa negation, ji-caa negation presents many syntactic variations sensitive to mood (i.e. in irrealis clauses). The negative particle in such clauses can appear after the verb, as in the basic pattern, before and after the verb, or only before the verb in some cases. Recalling the requirement of irrealis mood (i.e. one element should occupy the position between the subject and the verb), when this requirement is fulfilled, then caa
173

stays in the postverbal position, maintaining the basic pattern. When the object of a clause is dislocated to form a wh-question, or stays in the postverbal position, the negative particle caa appears between the subject and the verb, by which the requirement of irrealis mood is fulfilled. Sometimes, when caa already appears in the preverbal position, it does not appear again in the postverbal position. In each variation, the verb is obligatorily marked with the negative morpheme -ji.
In sentence (283), -ji marks the verb, followed by the negative particle caa, displaying the basic pattern of ji-caa negation. The wh-word is the subject, followed by the object phrase nu-nasi ‘his garden,’72 followed in turn by the verb. This is the configuration of irrealis mood (SXV word order).

caa?

who

3S-garden cultivate-SUB.NEG-MMT.PFV-EC NEG

Who will not cultivate his garden?

In (284), caa precedes and follows the verb which is marked with -ji. The questioned element here is the subject as well. However, the object nu-naana ‘his wood’ does not appear between the subject and the verb, but remains in the postverbal position. In comparison with the above example, the negative particle caa in the current example appears postverbally as well as preverbally, forming a linear SXV Word order to fulfill the requirement of irrealis mood. Compare this sentence with (286) below.

72 In regional Spanish, the term chacra means ‘terrain for planting’.
174

Who will not take out his wood?

As is seen in (285), the sentence is ungrammatical when the object as well as the negative particle remain in the postverbal positions (i.e. nothing appears between the subject and the verb in a transitive irrealis clause).

(285) *¿Can++ca jicata-ji-r++-Ø

caa nu-naana?

who

take.out-SUB.NEG-MMT.PFV-EC NEG 3S-wood

Who will not take out his wood?

In (286), the negative particle caa both precedes and follows the verb marked with -ji. The question word in the sentence is the direct object. The subject is a pronoun nu ‘3S’ and caa appears after it in the preverbal position, which forms the SXV word order to express the irrealis mood. The indirect object remains in the postverbal position.

(286) ¿Saaca nu=ca73=mit++-ji-r++-Ø

caa nu-atamajana?

what 3S=NEG=give-SUB.NEG-MMT.PFV-EC NEG 3S-brother

What will he not give to his brother?

It is important to mention that when the negative particle caa already appears in
the preverbal position, in order to fulfill the requirement of irrealis mood, the sentence is
also grammatical if it does not appear in the postverbal position again. This phenomenon
is especially common in intransitive clauses, although it is also observed in transitive clauses. In (287), caa appears after the wh-word, which is the subject, to fulfill the irrealis

175

mood requirement. The object asúraaja ‘yuca’ appears in the postverbal position. Caa also appears after the verbal complex. Interestingly, speakers indicate that sentence (287) is the most correct one while (288) is preferred because there is less repetition.

(287) ¿Can++ca caa sir+ta-ji-r++-Ø

caa asúraaja?

who

NEG take.out-SUB.NEG-MMT.PFV-EC NEG yuca

In (288), caa appears between the questioned subject and the verb marked with -ji. The negative particle caa does not appear again in the postverbal position and the sentence is grammatical.

(288) ¿Can++ca caa sir+ta-ji-r++- Ø

asúraaja?

who

NEG take.out-SUB.NEG-MMT.PFV-EC yuca

Examples (289) and (290) show that some negative clauses can be marked only by the negative morpheme -ji, although this is not common and not agreed on by all the speakers. The fact that a given negative clause can possibly be marked with only the negative morpheme -ji confirms its negation meaning.

It is worth noting that many speakers use both strategies—caa negation and ji-caa negation—for certain types of clauses, such as adverbial clauses, as seen in (291) to (294), and complement clauses, as in (295) and (296). This corresponds to the fact that it is difficult in Iquito to classify adverbial and complement clauses as either independent or subordinate clauses. It seems that they can be viewed as both types of clauses. I attempt to explain this variation from a functional/pragmatic perspective in §4.3.3.

4.3.3 The Scope of Negation and the Function of the Two Strategies
In addition to the syntactic characteristics (i.e. type of clause) discussed above, there is a correlation between the negation strategy, the scope of negation and the
178

pragmatic function: caa negation has scope over the entire clause while ji-caa negation has scope over only the verb phrase, excluding the subject of the clause. For example, in wh-questions, the wh-word is not negated; only the rest of the clause is negated. This has much to do with the function of the two negation strategies: caa negation negates the clause without focusing any element, but ji-caa negation focuses the first element of the clause and negates the rest of the clause. This corresponds to the fact that wh-questions, relative clauses and embedded clauses are similar to cleft constructions, not only structurally (i.e. using ji-caa negation) but also functionally (i.e. generally interpreted by speakers as clefts and the first element focused). Recall also the phenomenon such that adverbial and complement clauses can adopt both negation strategies. In Iquito, the syntactic status of these types of clauses can be treated as subordinate clauses as well as coordinated clauses. In addition, it is noted that this variation also corresponds to different pragmatic functions (i.e. whether the first element of the clause focused or not). In the following, I start the discussion with a comparison between the structure of cleft constructions and that of clausal negation.
Sentence (297) consists of an affirmative clause. As seen in (298), to negate a principal or independent clause, the negative particle caa is directly placed at the beginning of the clause, which is caa negation.
(297) Qui=niqui-Ø-cura iina icuani. 1S=see-PFV-RPST DET man I saw that man.
(298) Caa qui=niqui-Ø-cura iina icuani. NEG 1S=see-PFV-RPST DET man 179

I didn’t see that man.

On the other hand, if a cleft construction is used, the subject is represented by the full form of the pronoun (i.e. quiija instead of qui ‘1S’) and the negation strategy changes from caa negation to ji-caa negation, as can be seen in (299), because the negation is now occurring in a relative clause.

(299) Quiija t++ iina niqui-ji-Ø-cura

caa iina icuani.

1SP COP REL see-SUB.NEG-PFV-RPST NEG DET man

I am the one who didn’t see that man.

Other cases of ji-caa negation, besides embedded clauses of cleft constructions, are whquestions and relative clauses. The speakers always interpret them in the same way they interpret clefts, and they frequently insert the copular t++.74 Consider example (300). Speakers interpret it with the meaning between parentheses and sometimes produce (301) to express the same meaning. There is variation, therefore, in that one can choose to use a cleft, (301), or not, (300). The structural similarity between these two clauses is especially clear with negation because both clauses use ji-caa negation. In addition, the interpretation suggests that these two clauses have the first elements focused, which correlates ji-caa negation with the focus function of the cleft construction.

(300) ¿Can++ca casira-ji-Ø-cura

caa páapaaja?

who

grab-SUB.NEG-PFV-RPST NEG fish

Who didn’t grab fish? (Who is the one who didn’t grab fish?)

74 The copular t++ in Iquito is analyzed as carrying both copular function and focus function.
180

(301) ¿Can++ca t++ iina casira-ji-Ø-cura

caa páapaaja?

who

COP REL grab-SUB.NEG-PFV-RPST NEG fish

Who is the one who didn’t grab fish?

As discussed above, we see that besides clause types, there is a correlation between the negation strategy and the pragmatic function. Caa negation does not focus any element in the clause while ji-caa negation focuses the first element of the clause. The fact that adverbial and complement clauses can adopt both strategies supports the idea that these clauses are not typical subordinate clauses and select the different negation strategies due to pragmatic reasons.

4.4 CONDITIONALS AND COUNTERFACTUALITY
This section provides a description and proposes an analysis of the morphosyntactic composition of conditionals and the status of counterfactuality in Iquito. A conditional construction in Iquito consists of an antecedent clause and a consequent clause. There are non-CF and CF conditionals. Non-CF conditionals are used to express habitual patterns of situations in the past and present, past and present epistemic situations, and future situations. CF conditionals are used in present counterfactual (PresCF75) situations or in past counterfactual (PastCF) situations.76 CF constructions convey the meaning that the speaker believes a certain proposition not to hold (Iatridou, 2000: 231). The PresCF conveys that the antecedent and consequent of a conditional do not hold at present while the PastCF conveys that the antecedent and consequent of a
75 I adopt the terminological convention used in Iatridou (2000). 76 The CF morpheme is generally not used in a future situation except when the consultant believes that certain ‘scheduled future situations’ would not be realized.
181

conditional did not hold at a particular time in the past (Iatridou, 2000:232). Iatridou (2000) provides a discussion of “fake” tense/mood/aspect (TMA) in English and Modern Greek conditionals and CF wishes, indicating that TMA in these constructions is “fake” as it does not receive the same interpretations as those in other constructions. For example, in the sentence ‘if I were you, I would be happy with that,’ the past tense does not really indicate a past situation, but a present counterfactual situation. In addition, she also points out that counterfactuality is, in these languages, conveyed by implicature. In this section, I present a system differing from those discussed by Iatridou, and propose that, in Iquito, TMA in both CF and non-CF conditionals is “real”77 because it receives the same temporal, modal, and aspectual interpretations as it does in non-conditionals. The counterfactuality difference between CF conditionals and non-CF conditionals is expressed by a specialized CF morpheme (+)t+,78 which conveys CF meaning by entailment instead of implicature. With respect to mood morphology which is realized by the word order change, the irrealis mood (realized by SXV word order to express an unrealized situation) is always used in the CF consequent in combination with the CF morpheme.
This section discusses conditional constructions in detail, including non-CF conditionals (§4.4.1) and CF conditionals (§4.4.2). §4.4.3 proposes an analysis of TMA morphology in conditionals and of the status of counterfactuality.
77 Many Indo-European languages (i.e. Modern Greek and English, among others) and other non-IndoEuropean languages (i.e. Papago, Japanese, Korean, Hebrew, Turkish, and Basque, among others) have fake tense and aspect morphology in CF conditionals and wishes (Iatridou, 2000: 245). 78 The form is t+ when phonologically fused with other morphemes and is +t+ when not fused with other morphemes.
182

4.4.1 Non-CF Conditionals In non-CF conditionals, a non-assertive morpheme sacari is used in antecedents
in combination with the realis word order SVX, expressing the meaning ‘on the condition in which the indicated situation is realized or being realized (i.e., ‘if’),’ depending on the viewpoint aspect. Sacari is a circumfix with tense and aspect inflections appearing between sa- and -cari. Non-CF conditionals are used in the following three situations: habitual patterns of situations in the past and present, past and present epistemic situations and future situations. The specific structural characteristics of these three situations are summarized in the table below. I discuss, in the following, each situation in the order presented in this table.

First, non-CF conditionals can be used to express habitual patterns of situations. The Imperfective Aspect and the realis word order SVX are used in both antecedent and consequent clauses. If expressing past habitual patterns, past tenses (i.e. Distant Past Tense or Recent Past Tense) are used; otherwise the Extended Current Tense is used.
Sentence (302) conveys a present habitual situation. It can be seen that the nonassertive morpheme sacari is used in the antecedent. Both clauses reflect the realis word order, SVX. The frequent adverbial p+y++ni yahu++ni ‘everyday,’ the Imperfective Aspect and Extended Current Tense appear in the sentence, indicating that the RT overlaps with SpT. The Imperfective Aspect receives a habitual interpretation. As introduced earlier, sacari is a bipartite morpheme with tense and aspect inflections appearing between sa- and -cari.80

nuu, ca=nu=sapi-i-Ø. 3S NEG=3S=cry-IPFV-EC If you give him (an) egg everyday, he doesn’t cry.

Sentence (303) shows that negation does not affect sentence structure in the habitual use of non-CF conditionals.
80 This is especially clear when Recent Past Tense appears. When used with Extended Current Tense, saacari is heard with Imperfective Aspect; sácari is heard with a short and high-pitched vowel on the first syllable, with General Perfective Aspect; sar++cari is heard with Momentary Perfective Aspect.

If you do not give him an egg everyday, he cries everyday.

In (304)-(306), it is seen that a frequency adverbial is not required in such a habitual construction. In other words, the Imperfective Aspect yields the habitual interpretation. The sentence does not render a progressive interpretation, such as ‘if the situation in the antecedent is ongoing, then the situation in the consequent is ongoing.’ Rather, the consultants commented that the situations in these sentences hold for ‘several days,’ not just ‘today,’ the day of SpT.

Besides habitual situations, non-CF conditionals can also be used to express epistemic situations. The realis word order SVX is used in both antecedent and consequent clauses. An epistemic adverb cuuta ‘perhaps’ is optionally used in antecedents and is always used in consequents. The tense and aspect morphology of both clauses depends on the meaning of the indicated situations.
Sentence (307) consists of a past epistemic antecedent and a present epistemic consequent. It is noted that the epistemic adverb cuuta ‘perhaps’ does not occur in the antecedent. The antecedent clause, therefore, can have three interpretations: a future interpretation ‘if he drinks it today,’ a past epistemic interpretation ‘if he drank it today’ (this example), or a past counterfactual interpretation ‘if he had drunk.’ The clause literally means ‘on the condition where the situation is realized (with a perfective aspect) or being realized (with Imperfective Aspect).’ The interpretation of sacari is selected by the other clause which pairs with it. The other point is that although the recent past tense can appear between sa and cari, the consultants prevailingly prefer Extended Current Tense. The temporal interpretation of the clause depends on the paired clause, by which I argue that the RT of such a clause anchors with the RT of the paired clause unless an explicit adverbial is used. In (307), the interpretation is clarified by the consequent. Since

186

the consequent is about the present situation, the antecedent is about the eventuality of the past.

If he (already) drank it (earlier today), with this he is probably recovering (now).

Sentence (308) consists of a past epistemic antecedent and a past epistemic consequent. The epistemic adverb cuuta ‘perhaps’ appears in the antecedent as well as in the consequent clause.

It is noted that epistemic conditionals can also be expressed without the nonassertive morpheme sacari, by two declarative clauses in combination with the epistemic adverb cuuta, as in (309) and (310).

3S=recover-IPFV-EC perhaps now

If he drank it (in the recent past), he is probably recovering now.

Finally, non-CF conditionals can also be used to express future situations. Extended Current Tense is used in both clauses. The non-assertive morpheme sacari and the realis word order SVX are used in antecedents while the irrealis word order SXV is used in consequents. Aspect morphology in the antecedent depends on the indicated meaning. A variety of perfective aspects, depending on the remoteness of future indicated, are used in consequents.
Example (311) concerns an immediate future situation later in the same day which includes SpT. The antecedent contains a Stative verb and the Imperfective Aspect is used, indicating overlapping SitT of situations in two clauses. The sentence means ‘I will visit you during the time while I can.’ It can be seen that Extended Current Tense is used in both clauses. The antecedent exhibits realis word order while the consequent exhibits irrealis word order.

qui=quia=sihu+ra-cuaa-Ø. 188

1S=can-NASS-IPFV-EC-NASS 1S=2S=visit-DEI1.PFV-EC If I can, I will go visit you.

Sentence (312) concerns a near future situation which might occur either very late on the same day or in a few days. The antecedent contains the same morphology as that in (311). The consequent contains Momentary Perfective Aspect in combination with the irrealis word order, indicating a near future.

maaya.

1S=can-NASS-IPFV-EC-NASS 1S=DET=see-MMT.PFV-EC child

If I can, I will see that child.

Sentence (313) consists of an antecedent concerning immediate future and a consequent concerning tomorrow. As introduced earlier, an antecedent clause containing sacari and Extended Current Tense can have three interpretations, including future interpretation, past epistemic interpretation, and past counterfactual interpretation, and the precise interpretation is selected by the paired clause. In (313), the antecedent contains General Perfective Aspect and Extended Current Tense. The condition that the antecedent sets up is not concerned with whether the SitT precedes the SpT or follows the SpT. Rather, it expresses the boundedness of the telic predicate and the sequentiality between the antecedent and the consequent. It also shows that the event presented by the antecedent is not an ongoing event which overlaps with SpT. The future interpretation, among the three possible interpretations, is selected by the consequent. The consultants Jaime and Hermico commented that the past epistemic reading of the antecedent in (313) is also available, but not the past counterfactual interpretation. In contrast, the antecedent in
189

(314) which contains the adverb cuuta ‘perhaps’ yields only the epistemic reading. The verbs in the consequents of both (313) and (314) contain the Imperfective Aspect because this is the most unmarked aspectual choice for stative predicates.

If Maria is running now, tomorrow she will go to the race.

If the antecedent concerns a future situation specifically for ‘tomorrow,’ Momentary Perfective Aspect can be used in place of General Perfective Aspect, as in (319). However, this is not obligatory, as in (320)-(322). As discussed earlier, the future interpretation of an antecedent is selected by the consequent. The temporal adverbials narrow down and specify the RT.

Examples (319) and (320) above contain epistemic antecedents. Example (323) consists of a past epistemic antecedent and a future consequent. As can be seen, the recent past tense -cura appears in the circumfix sacari. The consultants sometimes produce such examples, but they prefer Extended Current Tense in the antecedent.

4.4.2 CF Conditionals In Iquito, CF conditionals are used in PastCF and PresCF situations. PastCF
conveys the meaning that the proposition does not obtain in the past and PresCF conveys the meaning that the proposition does not obtain in the present. As in other languages, in Iquito the CF morpheme usually cannot be applied to a future situation;81 however, in the context of a scheduled future, the CF morpheme can be used. In antecedent clauses of CF conditionals, either the non-assertive morpheme sacari with realis order SVX, or the CF morpheme (+)t+ with irrealis order SXV, is used. The consultants prefer using the CF morpheme in the antecedent. In consequent clauses, the CF morpheme (+)t+ with irrealis order SXV is always used. With respect to tense morphology, past tenses or Extended Current Tense are used in PastCF while in PresCF only Extended Current Tense is used. With respect to the aspect morphology in PastCF, General Perfective Aspect is mostly used for telic and Activity predicates while the Imperfective Aspect is mostly used for stative predicates. However, other aspects can also be used depending on the indicated meaning. In PresCF, the Imperfective Aspect is always used. In the following, I first discuss PastCF conditionals, then PresCF conditionals. The syntactic characteristics introduced here are summarized in table 9 below.
81 “We cannot have a counterfactual to the future as the future is conceptualized as not yet fact” (Iatridou, 2001).

In PastCF conditionals, the tense and aspect morphology depends on the situation types of the verb constellation and the indicated meaning. When the predicate is stative, Imperfective Aspect is usually used. In (324), we can see that the situation indicated in the antecedent is marked with Imperfective Aspect and overlaps with the event in the consequent. Consultants pointed out that if the perfective aspect is used in the antecedents of examples (324)-(327), the sentence is interpreted as ‘if you had not revived there, I would have died,’ which is grammatically possible but pragmatically odd for the consultants due to the combination of the antecedent and the consequent. A sentence like ‘if you had not revived, we would not have been so happy’ would be pragmatically acceptable. In Iquito, an inceptive reading is generally triggered when perfective aspect combines with statives. The aspectual morphology in the counterfactual conditionals is, therefore, ‘real’ because it receives its usual interpretation. If the sentence concerns a recent past situation, the recent past tense is used, as in (324) and (327). If the sentence
195

concerns a distant past situation, the distant past tense is used, as in (325). If the sentence concerns an immediate past situation, the Extended Current Tense is used, as in (326). As discussed before, the clause containing sacari often anchors with the RT of the paired clause. In (327), the Recent Past Tense marker -cura is optional and the interpretation remains the same.

When the predicate is telic or an Activity, perfective aspect is usually used; the sentence conveys a sequential reading. In (328), the antecedent refers to a situation where the drinking of the remedy is finished. The CF morpheme indicates that the speaker believes that the indicated situation is contrary to the actual situation. It is noted that the clause which includes the CF morpheme reflects the irrealis word order. In (328), the subject is followed by the CF morpheme, followed by a determiner of the object phrase. A temporal adverb, as in (329), or the object pronoun, as in (330), may follow the CF morpheme as well. The X position is not always filled if the verb is intransitive, as in the consequent of (328). Extended Current Tense, with perfective aspect, is used to refer to a CF situation in the immediate past (i.e. earlier on the same day which includes SpT), as in (328) and the consequent of (329). Recent Past Tense is used to refer to a CF situation in the recent past (i.e. at least one day ago up to one to two years), as in the antecedent of (329).

Besides using the CF morpheme in the antecedent, the non-assertive morpheme might also be used, conveying the meaning that ‘on the condition in which the indicated situation is realized,’ as in (331), although as mentioned before, using the CF morpheme is prevailingly preferred. The CF morpheme is always used in the consequent, as in (331).

Examples (332) and (333) show different degrees of past remoteness. In (332), the sentence concerns an immediate past situation and the Extended Current Tense is used. In (333), the sentence concerns a recent past situation and the Recent Past Tense is used.

Just like in PastCF conditionals, in PresCF conditionals, both the non-assertive morpheme sacari (with realis order SVX) and the CF morpheme (+)t+ (with irrealis order SXV) can be used in the antecedent. The consequent, again, always contains the CF morpheme and irrealis word order. Imperfective Aspect is used in both the antecedent and the consequent of a PresCF conditional. As can be seen in (334), both the antecedent and the consequent concern a present counterfactual situation. The sentence means ‘I currently do not work as a lawyer and I don’t have money.’ In both clauses, Imperfective Aspect is used.

(334) Qui=t+=naji=tarahuajuu-yaa-Ø j++ta núquiica abogada, 1S=CF=such=work-IPFV-EC as one lawyer

qui=t+=cuuriqui=mii-yaa-Ø. 199

1S=CF=money=have-IPFV-EC If I were working as a lawyer, I would have money.
In (335), the sentence conveys the meaning ‘he is currently not knowledgeable and he is not a teacher.’ The consultant Hermico commented that if the perfective aspect is used in the sentence, it conveys the meaning that ‘if he had become knowledgeable earlier today, he would have become a teacher by now,’ as in (336). When General Perfective Aspect appears with Statives, it renders an inceptive reading. The tense and aspect morphology in CF conditionals is real as tense and aspect yield the usual interpretation. Sentence (336) is grammatically possible, but it is pragmatically odd for the speakers.
(335) Nu=t+=nacusiaana=cuqui-i-Ø, 3S=CF=knowledgeable=be-IPFV-EC

200

The consultants commented that General Perfective Aspect can be used only with Distant Past Tense, as can be seen in the antecedent of (337). The interpretation of the antecedent involves a learning process in which a person became knowledgeable from being non-knowledgeable. General Perfective Aspect indicates an inceptive reading.
(337) Nu=t+=nacusiaana=cuqui-Ø-quiaqu+, 3S=CF=knowledgeable=be-GNR.PFV-DPST.NIP
ácari nu=t+=pajuuyaana cuqui-i-Ø. now 3S=CF=teacher be-IPFV-EC If he had become knowledgeable (a long time ago), he would be a teacher now.
If the Imperfective Aspect is used with the Distant Past Tense, as in (338), the interpretation does not concern the learning process. It only renders the meaning that if he had been knowledgeable a long time ago, he could have become a teacher back then, and so he would be a teacher now. The sentence remains neutral about whether the person is knowledgeable or not right now. The consultants commented that he is perhaps knowledgeable now, but it is too late for a teaching career. Alternatively, he might still not be knowledgeable.
(338) Nu=t+=nacusiaana=cuqui-Ø-aariqu+, 3S=CF=knowledgeable=be-GNR.PFV-DPST.NIP

now 3S=CF=teacher

be-IPFV-EC

If he had been knowledgeable (a long time ago), he would be a teacher now.

Besides the CF morpheme, sacari can also be used in the antecedent of a PresCF, as in (339).

(339) Nacusiaana cuqui-sa-a-Ø-cari

nuu,

knowledgeable be-NASS-IPFV-EC-NASS 3S

ácari pajuuyaana +t+ cuqui-i-Ø. now teacher CF be-IPFV-EC If he were knowledgeable, he would be a teacher now.

The CF morpheme is obligatory in the consequent clause of a CF conditional. The sentence is ungrammatical and unacceptable to the speakers if the CF morpheme is absent, as in (340).

(340) *Suhuaani caaya +t+ cuqui-i-Ø, qui=nu=is++cuu-Ø-Ø.

If he were a good person, I would befriend him (later today).

Comparing (341) with (342), both sentences contain the non-assertive morpheme sacari in the antecedent and the CF morpheme in the consequent. Both sentences contain Extended Current Tense, which gives an RT span from today that includes SpT, extending into the infinite future. The difference between the two sentences is that in the
202

consequent of (341), the unmarked General Perfective Aspect is used while in that of (342), Imperfective Aspect is used. Therefore, the consequent of (341) is interpreted as PastCF, meaning ‘he would have shouted,’ and that of (342) is interpreted as a PresCF, meaning ‘he would be shouting.’ This corresponds to the temporal interpretation of Extended Current Tense in non-conditional sentences.

(341) Nu=aqu+si-sa-a-Ø-cari, 3S=be.drunk-NASS-IPFV-EC-NASS

jaa nu=t+=ruruucuu-Ø-Ø. already 3S=CF=shout-GNR.PFV-EC If he were drunk, he would have already shouted.

3S=be.drunk-NASS-IPFV-EC-NASS already 3S=CF=shout-IPFV-EC

If he were drunk, he would already be shouting.

In (343), both clauses use the Imperfective Aspect. The sentence conveys that ‘it is not big now and it is not good.’

(343) Umaana cuqui-sa-a-Ø-cari,

suhuaani +t+ cuqui-i-Ø.

If it were big, it would be good.

203

Example (344) consists of a PastCF antecedent and a PresCF consequent. It is seen that General Perfective Aspect and Recent Past Tense are used in the antecedent and the Imperfective Aspect and the Extended Current Tense are used in the consequent.

4.4.3 A Proposed Analysis In the discussions above, I show that in CF conditionals as well as in non-CF
conditionals, TMA morphology is real, which means it yields interpretations consistent with those in non-conditionals. The counterfactuality difference between CF conditionals and non-CF conditionals resides in the presence of a specialized CF morpheme in consequents, expressed by entailment rather than implication.
In (329) above, the perfective aspect receives its usual interpretation. If the Imperfective Aspect is used, as seen in (345), a progressive ongoing reading is rendered, and the sentence remains a PastCF.

jaa nu=t+=ácari anaj+-qui-Ø. 204

already 3S=CF=now recover-GNR.PFV-EC If he had been taking the medicine the day before yesterday, he would have already recovered by now.

In the following, I discuss the status of the CF morpheme and argue that its counterfactual meaning, the consultant’s believing that a certain proposition does not hold (Iatridou, 2000: 231), is conveyed by entailment instead of implicature. Sentence (346) indicates that the speaker believes that the patient did not take the medicine and did not recover. It is compatible with (347) which directly states that the reason why the patient did not recover from sickness is due to his not having taken the medicine. The consultants commented that it is repetitive to utter both (346) and (347). Furthermore, (346) is incompatible with (348) which states that the consultant does not know if the patient took the medicine or not. This shows that when (346) is uttered, the consultant believes that he knows the actual situation even though the actual situation might be different from what he asserts and that counterfactuality in (346) is asserted and conveyed by entailment.

Examples (349)-(351) are relevant cases in point. Sentence (349) conveys the meaning that ‘the object was not big and I did not buy a big one.’ Sentence (349) is incompatible with (350) which conveys the meaning that ‘the consultant does not know the size of the object. It may be big or not.’ Sentence (351), again, is a repetition of what is conveyed in (349).

Since it was small, I did not (because there is not a big one) buy a big one.

The other point worth noting is that the CF morpheme usually is not compatible with a future situation. However, if the consultant believes a certain scheduled future event will not take place because of the unfulfillment of a past or current event, the CF morpheme can be used (although this usage is marked). In (352), the antecedent indicates that ‘since the candidate of a political election did not arrive yesterday, all the events originally scheduled for today and tomorrow will not take place.’

It is noted that the CF morpheme can only refer to a CF situation82 in Iquito, contrary to the case in English. Sentences (353) and (354) are a pair of conversational sentences. The sentence (353) indicates that ‘The subject is a bad person. He has many friends simply because he has money.’ Sentence (354), from another conversation partner indicates that ‘If the subject were a nice person, he would have even more friends.’ The consultant Hermico commented that the word masiaana ‘many’ in (354) refers to the quantity apart from the number of friends that the subject already has, therefore receiving the interpretation of ‘many more.’ Hermico commented that the consequent of (354) refers to a CF situation and cannot mean that ‘If the subject were nice, he would also
82 In Iatridou (2001), the English CF sentence ‘if he were nice, he would also have many friends’ is argued to contain a non-CF consequent.
208

have the same number of friends that he has now.’ He further commented that if the sentence in parentheses is used, the entire sentence in (354) means that ‘If the subject were nice, he would have the same amount (i.e. interpreted from the phrase naji j++ta ‘such as’) of friends apart from (i.e. interpreted from the word masiaana) the amount of friends he has now.’ The consultant Jaime gave the same interpretation and further commented that he would change the word masiaana ‘many’ in (353) to núquiica ‘one’ and he would not use the sentence in parentheses. The meaning conveyed by the entire sentence, after the revision, would be ‘The subject has only one friend and he has that friend only because he has money. He is a bad person. If he were a nice person, he would have many friends apart from that friend he already has currently.’

In conclusion, in this section I propose that TMA in Iquito conditionals is ‘real,’ and that the CF morpheme asserts and conveys counterfactuality by entailment and not by implicature. For further research, it would be worthwhile to compare Iquito with other languages within the same family, those spoken in the surrounding geographical area, as well as other languages in the world which use a specialized CF morpheme. The CF morpheme as well as conditional constructions are frequently used in Iquito narratives. In the following, I provide some examples from the ILDP text collection:

4.5 DESIDERATIVES, OPTATIVES AND CF WISHES84
In this section, I discuss how an Iquito speaker expresses wishes. To express a
wish, speakers choose from several strategies. First, they can use the lexical verb
nacar++- ‘want’ which takes an infinitival complement or an inflected clausal
83 The word minga refers to collective community work. A family requests other people’s help to clean the field, cultivate yuca, harvest leaves to weave roofs, etc. The family that requests help invites people to drink masato, a fermented yuca drink, and to eat before and after working. 84 Following Iatridou (2000), I name this construction ‘CF wish’ because it involves the use of the CF morpheme in Iquito. However, it could be viewed as a type of optatives, which is crosslinguistically common to formally resembling imperative constructions.
212

complement. This construction is also used to rephrase the commands or wishes given by a person other than the speaker. I call this construction ‘desiderative.’ Second, an optative construction with Imperfective Aspect and the potential mood -cuma can also be used. Third, they can use a CF wish construction, by which a speaker does not expect the addressee to carry out the event.
The Desiderative expresses a past or present wish for an event to be realized (or not) in the future relative to RT. The sentence can be affirmative or negative. The addressee, if also the action-performing referent, is obligated to realize the event. The Desiderative is frequently used to rephrase commands (i.e. imperatives or other directive constructions) or wishes (i.e. by optatives) of other people. Correspondingly, the subject of the verb nacar++- ‘want,’ the person who expresses the expectation, can be any grammatical person and not necessarily the speaker of the sentence. The Optative, marked with Imperfective Aspect in combination with the potential mood,85 expresses a weak prediction or wish about a potential event in the distant future. The wish is conveyed through implicature as this construction does not always express a wish and generally expresses a prediction. The sentence can be affirmative or negative and the person who expresses the prediction or wish is always the first person, which is the speaker. A CF wish expresses a past or present counterfactual situation which the speaker strongly desires to be realized or to have been realized. However, no action-performing referent is obligated. The sentence can only be affirmative and the person who expresses the wish can only be the first person, the speaker. I discuss desideratives in §4.5.1, optatives in 4.5.2, and CF wishes in 4.5.3.
85 The potential mood -cuma is also used in another construction, in combination with the unmarked General Perfective Aspect -Ø, to express a negative imperfective in which a strong expectation about a negative event being promptly realized is conveyed.
213

4.5.1 Desideratives The lexical verb nacar++- ‘want’ can take an NP, a non-finite, or an inflected
clausal complement;86 the verb is translated as ‘love’ or ‘want,’ depending on the context. In (359), nacar++- ‘want’ takes an NP complement nuu ‘3S,’ which follows it. In (360), the complement of nacar++- ‘want’ is an infinitival clause in which the subject of the infinitive verb asaani ‘to eat’ is the same as that of the matrix clause, being unexpressed in the infinitival clause. It can be seen that the object páapaaja ‘fish’ appears before the infinitive verb asaani ‘to eat.’

(359) Qui=nacar++-yaa-Ø nuu. 1S=want-IPFV-EC 3S I love him/her.

(360) Qui=nacar++-yaa-Ø páapaaja asaani.

1S=want-IPFV-EC fish

eat.INF

I want to eat fish.

When the subject of the infinitive verb is different from that of matrix clause, it is obligatorily expressed and a construction with the clitic =iira is used instead, as in (361). It can be seen that quia= ‘2S’ appears before the infinitive verb asaani ‘to eat’ which is followed by the clitic =iira ‘GOAL.’ The object iina páapaaja ‘that fish’ appears after the infinitive verb.

(361) Qui=nacar++-yaa-Ø quia=asaani=iira iina páapaaja.
86 For a detailed discussion on Complement Clauses, please refer to Lai (2005a).
214

1S=want-IPFV-EC 2S=eat.INF=GOAL DET fish I want you to eat that fish.

In (362), the verb nacar++- ‘want’ takes an inflected clausal complement. The embedded clause reflects the irrealis word order SXV, with the determiner of the object phrase situated between the subject and the verb. General Perfective Aspect is used in the embedded clause to indicate that the speaker expects the addressee to realize the event soon after SpT. Sentence (363) shows that the demonstrative iina and the embedded finite clause in (362) are in equivalent positions in terms of clausal structure.

I want you to eat this cashew.

(363) Qui=nacar++-yaa -Ø iina. 1S=want-IPFV-EC DET I want this one.

The lexical verb ‘want’ can be used to express a past or present wish about an event being realized in the future relative to RT. The speakers commented that they impose the obligation on the action-performing referents when they use these sentences (affirmative or negative). The difference between these sentences and imperatives is that these sentences seem to be less direct and impose slighter obligation. The imperative sentence reflects the realis SVX word order87 while the complement clause of the verb
87 Imperatives display characteristics of both realis and irrealis mood in terms of structural features. For a detailed discussion, please refer to §4.2 and §4.6.

nacar++- ‘want’ reflects the irrealis SXV word order. In addition, these sentences also express wishes in the past or present about an event being realized in the non-immediate future. Direct imperatives can only express the expectation about an event being realized in the proximity of SpT. In (364), the speaker wants the addressee to eat the cashew soon, or later in the day of SpT while in (365), the speaker wants the addressee to eat the cashew tomorrow or in a few days.

(364) Qui=nacar++-yaa-Ø quia=iina=ima-qui-Ø

maraniu.

1S=want-IPFV-EC 2S=DET=eat-MMT.PFV-EC cashew

I want you to eat this cashew (in a few days).

In (366), the speaker wants the addressee to eat the yuca further in the future, in this case a year later.

(366) Qui=nacar++-yaa-Ø quia=iina=asa-maa-Ø

when 3S=one-year

have-REM.PFV-EC

I want you to eat this yuca when it is one year old.

216

In (367), the speaker wants the addressee to eat the yuca some time in the distant future. Although the speaker imposes an obligation on the addressee, he or she is not sure if the event will be realized. The complement clause expresses a weak prediction, which is to be discussed in §4.5.2.

(367) Qui=nacar++-yaa-Ø quia=iina=asa-aa-cuma asúraaja. 1S=want-IPFV-EC 2S=DET=eat-IPFV-POT yuca I want you to eat this yuca perhaps once sometime in the distant future.

In addition to expressing a current wish about events being realized in the future, desideratives are also used to express a wish in the past. The complement clauses anchor to the RT of the matrix clause by means of tense and temporal adverbials.

(368) Iina=jina yahu++ni qui=nacar++-Ø-cura quia=iina=raati-qui-Ø

té.

DET=LOC day

1S=want-PFV-RPST 2S=DET=drink-GNR.PFV-EC tea

On that day, I wanted you to drink tea.

The action-performing referent in the complement clause not only can be the second person, but also can be the third person, as in (369). The speaker might or might not expect the addressee to facilitate the event; in a jussive sentence, on the other hand, the addressee is always expected to facilitate the event, as in (370).

(369) Qui=nacar++-yaa-Ø iina cuhuasi-qui-Ø maaya. 1S=want-IPFV-EC DET talk-GNR.PFV-EC child I want that child to talk. 217

JUSS=3S=talk-IPFV-EC first

Let him talk first!

In addition to the above-mentioned contexts, desideratives are frequently used to rephrase the commands (i.e. imperatives which impose obligation on the addressee) or wishes (i.e. CF wishes which do not impose obligation on the addressee) of other people. As a consequence, the rephrased sentence is ambiguous as to whether the subject of the sentence imposes obligation on the realization of the event. The subject of the verb nacar++- ‘want,’ the person who expresses the expectation, can be any grammatical person. Sentence (371) is used in the following scenario. The addressee is hard of hearing and couldn’t hear the hostess utter the imperative sentence, as in (372). A person sitting next to the addressee rephrased the imperative sentence and told him what the hostess said. The speaker of (372), which is not a syntactic argument in the sentence, corresponds to the subject of (371). The implicit subject in (372) appears to be the subject, quia= ‘2S,’ of the complement clause in (371). The object of (372), iina itíniija ‘this masato,’ corresponds to the object of the complement clause in (371). It is noted that the word order of the complement clause in (371) is SXV, an irrealis word order.

(371) Anuuja nu=nacar++-yaa-Ø quia=iina=raati-qui-Ø

(372) Raati-qui

iina itíniija! 218

Examples (373) and (374) express past wishes of third-person subjects.

Besides paraphrasing imperative sentences, desideratives are also used to rephrase a CF wish. Example (375) is a CF wish (§4.5.3). Like direct imperative sentences, the speaker of a CF wish sentence is always the grammatical first person, especially since a CF wish is not usually said out loud. The first person can be a syntactic argument in the sentence if it is involved with the wished event, as in (376). Structurally similar to the second person imperatives, as in (372), CF wishes in Iquito do not have an explicit subject in the sentence-initial position. In (372), the object appears after the transitive verb rariini ‘to drink’ while in (375), two objects appear after the same transitive verbs rariini ‘to drink’ which is because the causative morpheme -t++ increases the valence of the verb. I argue that in the case of CF wishes, the causative is responsible for introducing a hypothetical addressee and consequently yields, in combination with the CF morpheme, the meaning ‘want.’89 Corresponding to the function to indicate CF situations, a CF morpheme (+)t+ appears before the verbal root. The difference between imperatives and CF wishes is that imperatives are directed to the addressee and impose an obligation while CF wishes are not directed to a real addressee and do not impose any obligation. If talking to a real person to impose an obligation, an imperative or a desiderative is used. CF wishes can be uttered in the conversation, but often reside in speakers’ mental activities. They are only used in CF situations (i.e. counterfactual to a present or a past situation; a future situation is not considered counterfactual since “future is conceptualized as not yet fact.” (Iatridou: 2000)) and the sentence is not directed to any addressee, unlike a typical imperative.
89 I am very grateful to my colleague Cynthia Anderson Hansen for pointing out the contradiction and the oddness of my previous phrasing of this sentence. By adding the omitted information, the idea presented here is now clear.
220

According to the speakers Ema and Jaime, the sentence is used as if you were ‘praying to god.’ Strikingly, the paraphrased version of a CF wish (375) is the same as that of an imperative sentence, as in (377), in terms of the sentence structure of the rephrased version. The speaker of (375) appears to be the subject of the matrix clause in (377). The two objects appear to be the subject and the object of the complement clause in (377). The differences are that the addressee of imperatives (372) appears to be the subject of the complement clause, as in (371) while the subject of the complement clause in (377) is not the addressee of (375) since there might or might not be an actual addressee. In addition, Momentary Perfective Aspect in (375) is changed to General Perfective Aspect in (377). The function of different perfective aspects in CF wishes is discussed in §4.5.3.

(375) T+=rari-t++-r++-Ø

He (the speaker) wants him to drink masato.
90 Note that this construction resembles that of imperatives. However, in terms of speech acts, it is uttered as mental activity and expects no actual addressee. Here in the gloss, the term ‘it’ represents this implicit addressee in the mental activity.
221

Finally, desideratives can be used in either affirmative sentences, as above, or negative sentences, as in (378).

(378) Ca=qui=nacar++-yaa-Ø quia=iina=ima-qui-Ø

miitii.

NEG=1S=want-IPFV-EC 2S=DET=eat-GNR.PFV-EC cashew

I don’t want you to eat this cashew.

4.5.2 Optatives
The second strategy, optatives, with the Imperfective Aspect and the potential mood -cuma, is used to express a weak prediction or wish about a potential event in the distant future. As optatives generally convey a prediction, the wish is conveyed through implicature and is cancellable.91 The sentence can be affirmative or negative and the person who expresses the prediction or wish is always the first person, the speaker. Structurally, potential/optative -cuma patterns with other tense formatives (i.e. occupy the same position in the morphological template of the verbal complex) and it also solely applies to the situation in the distant future. Therefore, it arguably incorporates both temporal and modal meanings.
In (379) below, the speaker who wishes feels uncertain as to whether the event will be realized eventually. And even if the event will be realized, it will be a long time after. The scenario of this sense is ‘when a child already passed the age he is supposed to
91 In all contexts, the potential/optative -cuma expresses ‘a weak prediction about a situation in the distant future,’ which is the semantic meaning I claim for this morpheme. If a doctor uses -cuma and says ‘this child might never talk,’ clearly he does not have such a negative wish; instead, he is making a weak prediction based on his current diagnosis. However, as -cuma is frequently used in an affirmative sentence by the speakers, such a sentence is frequently interpreted as a wish by the speakers. The ‘wish’ sense of the morpheme -cuma, therefore, is yielded from its pragmatic use and is cancellable.
222

start talking.’ The speaker produced this sentence (379) to express an uncertain wish. The sentence can also be used in the sense of prediction. For example, if the child is recently born and still too small to talk, the speaker can use the following sentence.

(379) Iina maaya nu=cuhuasi-aa-cuma. DET child 3S=talk-IPFV-POT This child might talk (one day). This child, (I hope) he will talk one day.

In (380), a doctor who examined a child who had passed the age of starting to talk may use the sentence if he found out that the child is not physically capable of talking. It is certainly not the case that the doctor does not want the child to talk.

(380) Iina maaya ca=nu=cuhuasi-aa-cuma. DET child NEG=3S=talk-IPFV-POT This child might not talk (ever).

The speaker Ema commented that the following sentence can be used by a parent who is about to pass away, saying it to a little child and wishing him to be able to collect leaves when he grows up.

(381) Quia=naam+ cata-aa-cuma.

2S=leaf

collect-IPFV-POT

(I hope) you may collect leaves one day.

223

Ema indicated that the following negative sentence can also be used to express a wish. She said that the speaker wishes the child does not stop studying and hopefully he will not need to collect leaves like they do now.

(382) Ca=quia=naam+ cata-aa-cuma naji

j++ta cana=sujurisii-yaa-Ø.

NEG=2S=leaf collect-IPFV-POT like.this as 1P.EXCL=suffer-IPFV-EC

(I hope) you may never collect leaves like how we are suffering now.

The speaker Jaime commented that both (383) and (384) can be used after requesting a person to sing for a long time and that person still refuses to sing. In (383), the speaker expresses a wish and weak prediction that the addressee might still sing one day. In (384), on the other hand, the speaker might still wish (or not) that the addressee would sing one day. The sentence expresses a weak prediction that the addressee might never sing.

(383) Quia=ariicua-aa-cuma tácari

yahu++ni-jina.

2S=sing-IPFV-POT other.indefinite day-LOC

(I hope) you will sing one day.

You might sing one day.

Ca=quia=ariicua-aa-cuma j++ticari. NEG=2S=sing-IPFV-POT when
224

You are already like this. You might never sing.

Jaime indicated that (385) can be a wish or prediction, while (386) is more a prediction than a wish. Example (386) is used to express the disappointment when the addressee, a little child, does not want to practice writing.

(385) Tácari

yahu++ni-jina quia=núquiica-simiím+ najuu-yaa-cuma.

other.indefinite day-LOC 1S=one-letter

(386) Ca=quia=núquiica-simiím+ najuu-yaa-cuma.

NEG=2S=one-letter

write-IPFV-POT

You might never write a letter.

4.5.3 CF Wish The third strategy expresses a past or PresCF wish. In the case of a PresCF wish,
the speaker expresses a strong desire for something to be realized that is not currently being realized; he wishes for something, but expects opposite to happen. In the case of a past CF wish, the speaker expresses a strong desire for something to have been realized that was not realized in the past. A CF wish is an internal mental activity. It can also be used in the conversation. However, no action-performing referent is obligated. To obligate the addressee, the imperative construction or desideratives (as discussed in this chapter) are used. The sentence can only be affirmative and the person who expresses the wish can only be the speaker.
225

As discussed above, there are many formal similarities between second-person direct imperatives and a CF wish. I repeat the essential points here. First, no explicit subject appears in the sentence-initial position,92 as in (387) and (388). In (387), the object of the transitive verb rariini ‘to drink’ appears in the post-verbal position; in (388), two objects appear after the same transitive verb rariini ‘to drink.’ The difference in the verbal complex of these two sentences is that in (388) there is a causative morpheme -t++ which increases the syntactic valence of the verb. Second, both imperatives and CF wishes express an expectation about the realization of an event. The difference between them is that imperatives are directed to the addressee and impose obligation while CF wishes are not directed to the addressee and do not impose any obligation. Corresponding to the function to indicate CF situations, a CF morpheme (+)t+ appears before the verbal root. The sentence does not mean that ‘you make x happen.’ The speakers Ema and Jaime often commented that the sentence is used in praying. A striking fact is that the rephrased version of an optative sentence is the same as that of an imperative sentence. Please refer to (377) above for the discussion of a paraphrased imperative and CF wish.

IMPERATIVE:

(387) Raati-qui

iina itíniija!

drink-GNR.PFV DET masato

Drink that masato!

CF wish:

(388) T+=rari-t++-r++-Ø

itíniija nuu!

CF=drink-CAU-MMT.PFV-EC masato 3S

92 A subject of a simple declarative sentence always appears in the sentence-initial position. Iquito is an SVO language.
226

I wish he would drink masato! (Literally: Would it make him drink masato!)

A formal similarity between a CF wish and a ditransitive sentence in terms of clausal structure is that the word order is flexible in the postverbal position. As can be seen in (389) and (390) below, the two sentences convey the same meaning. Ema indicated that the sentence is used to think by yourself when you pass a house that has masato and the people inside the house did not invite you in. A CF wish can, therefore, be viewed as a kind of ditransitive causative construction.

(389) T+=rari-t++-r++-Ø

quiija iina itíniija!

CF=drink-CAU-MMT.PFV-EC 1S DET masato

I wish I could drink that masato!

(390) T+=rari-t++-r++-Ø

iina itíniija quiija!

CF=drink-CAU-MMT.PFV-EC DET masato 1S

I wish I could drink that masato!

Different perfective aspects and tense morphemes can appear in a CF wish. I show them and the corresponding contexts in the table below. In a PresCF wish, Momentary Perfective Aspect followed by Extended Current Tense is used in the verbal complex. In a PastCF wish, which is contrary to a past situation occurring today, the unmarked General Perfective Aspect followed by Extended Current Tense is used. In a PastCF wish, which is contrary to a past situation occurring further in the recent past, the unmarked General Perfective Aspect followed by Recent Past Tense is used. In a PastCF wish, contrary to a past situation in the distant past, the unmarked General Perfective
227

Aspect plus Distant Past Tense is used. The Imperfective Aspect can never be used in a CF wish, as in (391). This is also the case for imperatives, as detailed in §4.6. I argue that the tense and aspect morphology in the CF wish is real (i.e. not fake).93 The temporal interpretation of tense morphology is the same as that in a declarative sentence. The aspectual interpretation of aspect morphology corresponds to its conventional uses. Both General and Momentary Perfective Aspects are used in past as well as in future contexts. Please refer to the respective sections on grammatical aspects for a detailed discussion. Here in a CF wish construction, General Perfective Aspect is used to express a PastCF wish, while Momentary Perfective Aspect is used to express a PresCF wish. A PresCF wish in Iquito is used to express a desire which the speaker believes unrealizable currently in the actual world. It might be still realizable in the future, although the future possibility is not the scope of reference in the Iquito CF wishes. The notion of counterfactuality in Iquito is hence different from the general understanding as “a term only with respect to situations that cannot be helped anymore. (Iatridou, 2000: 231)” With respect to mood morphology, the irrealis mood (realized by SXV word order to express an unrealized situation), is generally used in other constructions containing the CF morpheme. Here, in CF wishes, it is not used since there is no condition to discuss the adjacency between the subject and the verb due to the obligatory absence of subjects in the sentence. Therefore, it is irrelevant to argue whether the mood morphology in CF wishes is real or fake.

(391) *T+=rari-t++-yaa iina café quiija! CF=drink-CAU-IPFV DET coffee 1S (The sentence is not interpretable for the speakers.)

The last structural point before I go into the discussion of different CF wishes is that a postverbal object can be topicalized. The topicalized object is followed by a noticeable pause when the sentence is pronounced. In (392), the object pronoun quiija ‘1S’ is topicalized and repeated again in the postverbal position. In (393), the object pronoun iina m+saji ‘that woman’ is topicalized and the resumptive pronoun appears in the postverbal position.

229

When a PresCF wish is expressed, Momentary Perfective Aspect and Extended Current Tense are used in the verbal complex. Examples (394) and (395) are from a narrative text. When the man met a non-human spirit in the forest, he spoke to it using the following sentences. Since the spirit is not a human female, the wish is contrary to fact. The speaker wishes the spirit to be human, which she is not, so the wish is desiring something that is not the case.

The speaker Ema indicated that she often goes to her chacra ‘vegetable garden’ by herself and only one or two dogs accompany her. She often says to the dog and to herself the following sentence because she feels lonely and wishes the dog could actually talk to her.

The speakers Jaime and Ligia commented that if they had a child who had passed the age of starting to talk and still hadn’t said a word, they would wish that the child would talk, using the following sentence.

(398) T+=cuhuasi-t++-r++-Ø

iina maayarica!

CF=talk-CAU-MMT.PFV-EC DET child.DIM

It is noted that the construction of the PresCF wish can also be used to fantasize about an event which is not realized presently, as in (399). The speakers commented that usually

231

the event in this construction has little chance to be realized. This shows that the concept of counterfactuality is oriented to a speaker’s belief.

The counterfactuality of a CF wish is not cancellable, as a true situation cannot be followed by a CF wish about the same situation. In (401), the speaker himself states that he is in Iquitos, which implies that the speaker knows and believes that he is in Iquitos. A PresCF wish which states the desire of being in Iquitos is hence incompatible with the first statement.

iina café quiija!

CF=have-CAU-MMT.PFV-EC DET coffee 1S

The speaker Ligia commented that CF wishes cannot be used to make a request directly to someone who has the beverage you want. It also cannot be used when you know you have such beverage in your own kitchen. For both situations, the following sentence is used instead. The beverage in the sentence is masato, a fermented yuca drink.

I wish that woman would drink this masato!

Examples (405) and (406) provide the verbal root sani- ‘taste’ and niqui- ‘see’ in CF wishes.

(405) T+=sani-t++-r++-Ø

quiija iina nu=ta=mii-yaa-Ø!

CF=taste-CAU-MMT.PFV-EC 1S DET 3S=ANT.IPFV=have-IPFV-EC

(406) T+=niqui-t++-r++-Ø

iina m+yaara quiija im+raani!

CF=see-CAU-MMT.PFV-EC DET dog

1S again

I wish I could see that dog again!

In addition to PresCF wishes, PastCF wishes can also be expressed using this construction. Example (407) is used when the speaker knows that the dog he wants to see again was here earlier today, but he was away and did not see the dog. Now the dog was taken away again and he lamented about what happened with a PastCF wish.

(407) T+=niqui-t++-Ø-Ø

quiija iina m+yaara im+raani! 234

CF=see-CAU-GNR.PFV-EC 1S DET dog I wish I had seen that dog again (today)!

again

The following sentence is used to express regret about a past situation in which the speaker saw what I-Wen drank, but could not have it himeself. Item (409) is a sentence with a similar context.

(408) T+=mii-t++-Ø-Ø

quiija iina iwen raati-qui-Ø!

CF=have-CAU-GNR.PFV-EC 1S DET Iwen drink-GNR.PFV-EC

I wish I had had (today) what Iwen drank (today)!

(409) T+=rari-t++-Ø-Ø

iina café quiija!

CF=have-CAU-GNR.PFV-EC 1S coffee 1S

I wish I had had that coffee (today)!

When making a PastCF wish contrary to a situation occurring before today, the unmarked General Perfective Aspect and the recent past tense -cura are used. Example (410) is used when the event in which the speaker could have seen the dog occurred before the day which includes SpT. The speaker wishes that he had seen the dog.

(410) T+=niqui-t++-Ø-cura

quiija iina m+yaara im+raani!

CF=see-CAU-GNR.PFV-RPST 1S DET dog

I wish I had seen that dog again (the other day)!

235

Example (411) is a PastCF wish contrary to a situation occurring in the distant past. The speaker did not have a piano when he was a child and wishes he had had one. It is seen that the unmarked General Perfective Aspect and Distant Past Tense -quiaqu+ is used.

(411) T+=mii-t++-Ø-quiaqu+

núquiica piana quiija!

CF=have-CAU-GNR.PFV-DPST.NIP one piano 1S

I wish I had had a piano (a long time ago)!

Besides the structure discussed above, there is also a trend to use the phrase t+=cuuhui-t++-(r++/or with Recent Past and Distant Past Tenses) as a fixed expression followed by an inflected clause. In this context of use, the speakers generally translate this phrase as ‘I wish that’ (originally in Spanish as ‘quisiera que’). There are at least two reasons to argue that this structure is calqued from Spanish. First, in Spanish, the phrase ‘quisiera que’ takes an inflected clause as the complement. The use of the fixed phrase is translated as ‘quisiera que’ and also takes an inflected clause as the complement. Second, under this use, there is only one complement in the postverbal position which indicates that the function of the causative morpheme -t++, increasing the syntactic valence, ceases. This is a strong indicator which shows that the phrase is used as a frozen unit. The only difference between local Spanish ‘quisiera que’ and the fixed use of the Iquito phrase is that in local Spanish, the person who makes the wish can be first person or third person singular. However, in Iquito the person who makes the wish can only be first person singular. In the following, I provide a few examples.
The complement clause of (412) is intransitive and, therefore, the nominal part of the subject appears after the verb cuhuasi- ‘talk’ while the determiner of the subject phrase appears before the verb.
236

(412) T+=cuuhui-t++-r++-Ø

iina cuhuasi-qui-Ø maaya!

CF=become-CAU-MMT.PFV-EC DET talk-GNR.PFV-EC child

I wish that this child would talk!

The complement clause of (413) is transitive and the word order reflects the irrealis SOV order. The speaker Ema commented that the following sentence is used to plan and to think before talking to people and imposing obligations on them.

(413) T+=cuuhui-t++-r++-Ø

p+=naam+ cata-t++-Ø-Ø!

CF=become-CAU-MMT.PFV-EC 1P=leaf collect-CAU-GNR.PFV-EC

I wish that we could request (people) to collect leaves!

In the following sentence, the fixed phrase takes a PastCF situation, consisting of a whenclause and a principal clause.

(414) T+=cuuhui-t++-Ø-quiaqu+ CF=become-CAU-GNR.PFV-DPST.NIP

In §4.5, I discussed how an Iquito speaker expresses wishes. Three strategies are generally used: the first one, desideratives, involves the use of the lexical verb nacar++‘want’; the second one, optatives, involves the Imperfective Aspect in combination with the potential mood -cuma; the third one, CF wishes, uses the CF morpheme and a construction similar to that of imperatives. Desideratives express a past or present wish about an event being realized in the future relative to RT. This construction is also frequently used to rephrase the commands (i.e. by imperatives) or wishes (i.e. by optatives) of other people. Optatives express a weak prediction or wish about a potential event in the distant future. The wish is conveyed through implicature as this construction does not always convey a wish and generally conveys a prediction. CF wishes express a wish contrary to a present or past situation. The speaker expresses a strong desire about an event being realized or having been realized.

4.6 IMPERATIVES AND JUSSIVES94
This section discusses the imperative and the jussive constructions in Iquito. Iquito imperatives are used when the addressees, as well as the action-performing referents, are first person plural inclusive, second person singular, or second person
94 I use the term ‘imperative’ in a broad sense and include constructions of the first person hortative and second person imperative. The other point worth noting is that I distinguish ‘imperative’ and ‘jussive’ in this dissertation because Iquito does make a formal distinction between them; therefore, theses labels reflect language-specific distinction, rather than crosslinguistically defined categories per se.
238

plural. Jussives are used when the action-performing or -involving referents are third
person singular or third person plural. The addressees of jussives are second person
singular or plural. Iquito imperatives and jussives can be used to give strong commands
in which non-compliance is not expected by speakers. In addition, they can also be used
to give permission, make requests, or provide instructions.
In affirmative contexts, imperatives and jussives are formally distinct structures
while in negative contexts, imperatives and jussives use the same type of formal structure. Affirmative imperatives can appear with all seven perfective aspects,95 except when they are pragmatically incompatible. In fact, the use of one of the seven perfective96
aspects is obligatory in affirmative imperatives. The seven perfective aspects render
different interpretations in terms of the location where the events are to be carried out
and, therefore, the direction and trajectory of addressees’ movement. The Imperfective
Aspect can never be used in the imperative constructions. The affirmative jussives, on the
other hand, appear only with the Imperfective Aspect and can never appear with any
perfective aspect. In correspondence with this formal observation, imperatives are used
before the potential event is realized while jussives can be used both before the event is
realized and when the event is already in progress.
In negative contexts, both imperatives and jussives use a negative particle in
combination with an unmarked perfective aspect, General Perfective Aspect, and the
95 There are seven perfective aspects in Iquito: General Perfective, Momentary Perfective, Remote Perfective, two Deictic Perfectives, Allative Perfective and Ablative Perfective, which are discussed in detail in §5. 96 According to Patience Epps (p.c.), in some languages, in particular, aspectual indicators in imperatives have a politeness function. For example, Hup perfective aspect makes a polite imperative to emphasize that the imposition will be of limited duration (Epps, 2008). In Iquito, because perfective aspects are obligatory in imperatives, the use of perfective aspect does not specifically carry a function of politeness. To make a polite request, speakers could express imperatives in a softer tone. Alternatively, they might use other types of clauses, such as desideratives. They could also express their expectations indirectly to another person and have them indirectly convey their expectations to the intended addressee.
239

morpheme of potential mood -cuma.97 Negative imperatives and jussives are only used before negative events are realized. In both affirmative and negative constructions, speakers indicate that they expect the addressed events or the associated process of the addressed events to be realized upon uttering the sentences.
I have analyzed imperative (§4.6.1) and jussive (§4.6.2) sentences as tenseless because there are no counterpart sentences that are overtly marked with a tense morpheme. In addition, Sadock and Zwicky (1985: 172) indicate that tense and aspect distinctions in imperatives are relatively uncommon crosslinguistically. The fact that Iquito uses different perfective aspects in imperatives might be a reflection of the historical development of the aspect morphemes from verbs indicating direction and path.
In terms of realis/irrealis marking, which is realized by word order, both affirmative and negative imperatives and jussives are observed to reflect realis word order SVX, instead of irrealis word order SXV. Payne (1997) indicates that imperatives are usually expressed with irrealis structures crosslinguistically, reflecting the fact that an imperative commands that something happen rather than asserting that it has already happened. Given the fact that affirmative jussives can be used when the event is already in actual progress, the perfective aspects, together with the realis word order SVX, in the affirmative imperatives, negative imperatives and jussives express a strong expectation of the realization of addressed events. Indeed, some affirmative imperatives, especially when the addressees are first person plural inclusive or second person plural, might be structurally ambiguous with a perfective sentence which indicates a realized event. However, these imperatives and perfective declaratives are generally distinguished by the
97 The morpheme of potential mood -cuma does not only appear in the negative constructions of imperatives and jussives, in which it appears with an unmarked perfective aspect. It is also used in combination with the Imperfective Aspect, in both affirmative and negative sentences, to indicate an uncertain prediction or a weak wish in which the speaker is not certain if the event will be realized. The events in this construction are further remote in the future.
240

following principles. First, in affirmative imperatives, explicit pronouns are pronounced with long vowels at the last syllable, as p++= ‘first person plural inclusive’ and quinaa= ‘second person plural’ while in past perfective declaratives, these two pronouns are pronounced as having a high pitch on the first syllable and short vowels on all syllables, as p'+= ‘1P.INCL’ and quína= ‘2P.’ Second, non-vowel-hiatus phenomena, 98 as introduced in §4.2, exist in imperatives under certain phonological environments. Third, most perfective declaratives appear with tense markers while the imperatives are always in Extended Current Tense. Fourth, speakers can use a temporal adverbial jaa ‘already’ before the subject pronoun to further clarify a past perfective declarative. Fifth, speakers use their pragmatic knowledge as well.
I discuss imperatives in §4.6.1, jussives in §4.6.2, and negative imperatives and jussives in 4.6.3 in terms of the sentence structure, the aspectual morphemes they appear with, and the mood structure they are associated with in the realis/irrealis system.
4.6.1 Imperatives Imperative constructions are used to address interlocutors in the first person plural
inclusive, as in (415), in the second person singular, as in (416), or in the second person plural, as in (417). Imperatives are observed to reflect SVX realis word order, instead of SXV irrealis word order, but with the non-vowel hiatus phonemenon, a characteristic of irrealis mood. It is noted that the addressees are also the action-performing referents in the sentences. If the addressee is second person singular, the subject pronoun is omitted, otherwise it appears before the verbs.
98 This is a characteristic of irrealis mood. In consideration of this feature, imperatives are ambiguous in terms of the alignment of mood. They reflect characteristeristics of both realis and irrealis mood, including SXV word order and the non-vowel hiatus phenomenon.

To highlight the person, a phonologically independent pronoun can be used in the sentence-initial position, as in (418)-(420). In sentences (418)-(420), it can be seen that the resumptive pronouns, the phonologically dependent pronouns, appear before the verbs except in the case when the addressee is second person singular.

99 General Perfective Aspect is not morphologically marked in the recent-past and distant-past environment. In the hodiernal and future environment, -qui surfaces after the verbal root ending in a short vowel, except when followed by certain clitics, in which case it is not marked. It is also not marked after the verbal root ending in a long vowel.

The imperative constructions can appear with all seven perfective aspects, except when
they are pragmatically incompatible. The seven perfective aspects (i.e. General Perfective
Aspect, Momentary Perfective Aspect, Remote Perfective Aspect, two Deictic Perfective
Aspects, Allative Perfective Aspect, and Ablative Perfective Aspect) give information on
the location where the events are to be carried out and the direction in which addressees
are supposed to proceed. The Imperfective Aspect can never be used in imperative
constructions. In the following, I discuss how the seven perfective aspects are used in
imperative constructions.
When General Perfective Aspect is used in imperatives, the addressee is expected
to realize the action where he is, without proceeding to other locations. General
Perfective Aspect,100 as also discussed in §5.2, applies to situation types101 of Activities
(421), Accomplishments (422), Semelfactives (423) and some Motion verbs (424). For
Achievements, General Perfective Aspect is used only when the commands, in
combination with Momentary Perfective Aspect (425), have already been given many
times. Speakers can use Achievements plus General Perfective Aspect to convey the
100 In the past perfective declaratives, General Perfective Aspect spans the initial and final endpoints of Activities and Accomplishments, presenting them as closed situations. For Achievements, which are singlestage events and generally apply to Momentary Perfective Aspect, General Perfective Aspect spans the single-stage interval plus an extended post-stage, indicating that the Achievement situations are realized before the Reference Time (RT hereafter). For single-stage Semelfactives, General Perfective Aspect views both the single event (with natural final endpoints) and the multiple events (with arbitrary final endpoints) of Semelfactives as closed situations. 101 For a detailed discussion on the classification of situation types, please see chapter 6.
243

insistence of their command (426). General Perfective Aspect is the most common perfective aspect in the imperative construction in the sense that it is most frequently used and compatible with almost all the verbs, except the verb ani- ‘come’ (427).

(423) Isiin++-Ø! cough-GNR.PFV Cough!

When General Perfective Aspect is used with Motion verbs, such as n+t+- ‘run,’ the speaker only expects the addressee to start running from his original location. The speaker does not expect any particular speed or direction to which the addressee runs.

(424) N+t+-qui! run-GNR.PFV Run!

(426) Iniica-qui

jaa!

Wake.up-GNR.PFV already

Wake up!

(427) *Ani-qui! come-GNR.PFV Come!

When Momentary Perfective Aspect 102 -r++ is used in imperatives, the addressee is expected to realize the action when he passes by on the way to some other place, if used with Activities, as in (428), Accomplishments, as in (429), and Semelfactives, as in (430). The addressee either keeps moving or stops by to perform the action, depending on the type of action and the amount of time it takes, before continuing his trip. When -r++ appears with Achievements, as in (431), the addressee is expected to realize the action where he is. When -r++ appears with the Motion verb n+t+- ‘run,’ the addressee is expected to realize the action in rapid speed, as in (432).

(428) Cuhuasita-r++ quiija!
102 In past perfective declaratives, Momentary Perfective Aspect spans intrinsically bounded single-stage Achievements. For Statives, it coerces derived Achievements, which focus on instantaneous initial endpoints. For Accomplishments, multiple-event Semelfactives, and most Activities, it associates the temporal schema to a short interval of time and triggers an ‘in-passing’ reading. More specifically, it indicates ‘the event is realized in some place, on the way to some other place’. Finally, for some Motion Activities, such as ‘swim’ and ‘run,’ it renders a ‘fast’ reading which focuses on the initial point of the fast part of Activities in which the actions are realized rapidly.

(432) N+t+-r++! run-MMT.PFV Run fast!

Except in an idiomatic expression which will be introduced below, Momentary Perfective Aspect cannot appear in imperatives with several Motion verbs as in the following.

(433) *Iícua-r++! go-MMT.PFV Go! 246

(434) *Iicuu-r++! walk-MMT.PFV Walk!

(436) *++-r++ (aviyu-jina)! fly-MMT.PFV airplane-LOC Fly (in the plane)!
(437) *Ani-r++! come-MMT.PFV Come!
In a particular idiomatic expression where Momentary Perfective Aspect is used as part of the fixed expression, Motion verbs, among other verbs, can freely appear in the sentence.
(438) Ajaa, iicuu-r++=quiaja. let’s.see walk-MMT.PFV=VERD Let’s see, walk!
247

(439) Ajaa, quinaa=iicuu-r++=quiaja. let’s.see 2P=walk-MMT.PFV=VERD Let’s see, you all walk!
When Remote Perfective Aspect -maa is used in imperatives, the addressee is expected to realize the action with movement, either approaching the speaker or moving away from the speaker. It is very rarely used, for several reasons. First, pragmatically there are very few actions that can be realized while one is walking. Second, there are very few occasions in which the speaker would want other people to perform some actions while they are on the move. Third, there are other imperatives with equivalent meaning. Examples (440) and (441) indicate that the speaker wants the addressee to talk and walk towards him at the same time. The speaker Hermico prefers the locative adverbial tíira=ji ‘from there’ while the speaker Jaime prefers the locative adverbial tíiracuma=ji ‘from (unspecific) there on.’
(440) Cuhuasi-maa tíira=ji! talk-REM.PFV there=from Come talking from there!
(441) Saqu+-maa narata=yaa tíiracuma=ji! tell-REM.PFV like.this=NWR unspecific.there=from Keep coming from there like this and talk!
Example (442) and (443) indicate that the speakers want the addressee to keep talking while leaving. The adverbial used is tíiracuma ‘(unspecific) there.’
248

(442) Cuhuasi-maa tíiracuma! talk-REM.PFV unspecific.there Keep going and talking!
(443) Saqu+-maa tíiracuma! tell-REM.PFV unspecific.there Keep going and talking!
It is noted that it is ungrammatical for Remote Perfective Aspect to appear with any Motion verb, except ani- ‘come.’ On the other hand, it is interesting to note that the imperative form of the verb ani- ‘come’ cannot appear with any other perfective aspects except Remote Perfective Aspect -maa.
(444) Ani-maa! come-REM.PFV Come!
There are two Deictic Perfective Aspects, -hu++ and -cuaa that speakers often use in imperative constructions. The addressee is expected to move to a certain location and realize the indicated event. As is discussed in §5.5, two systems of deixis are represented by the two Deictic Perfective Aspects: one is the speaker-centered riveroriented deixis and the other is the speaker-centered radial deixis. The formative -hu++ is used to indicate upriver orientation or in the proximity of the speaker while the formative -cuaa is used to indicate downriver orientation or away from the speaker. The
249

switch of deixis depends on the explicit use of deictic adverbials. Correspondingly, in the imperatives in combination with -hu++, the addressee is expected to realize the event in the proximity of the speaker or somewhere towards upriver, depending on the explicit adverbials together with manual gestures. In an imperative sentence with -cuaa, the addressee is expected to realize the event in a place that is away from the speaker or somewhere towards downriver. The two Deictic Perfective Aspects can appear with all event situation types (i.e. Activities, Accomplishments, Achievements, and Semelfactives) and stage-level Statives (i.e. a transitory state, such as angry and happy). The situations are expected to take place within a certain indicated area. Therefore, -hu++ and -cuaa are incompatible with verbs which encode directional components, such as iicua- ‘go,’ ani- ‘come,’ and sihuaan+- ‘arrive.’ Motion verbs, such as n+t+‘run,’ musi- ‘swim,’ and ++- ‘fly,’ can appear with -hu++ and -cuaa if the actions are to be performed within a restricted area.
Examples (445)-(448) show the use of the two Deictic Perfective Aspects with explicit adverbials in imperatives of the Activity situation type. The context is that a group of people are waiting for the addressee to arrive at a certain location and give a talk.
(445) Cuhuasi-hu++ iíti! talk-DEI1.PFV here Come here to talk!
(446) Cuhuasi-hu++ cáami! talk-DEI1.PFV upriver Go upriver to talk! 250

(448) Cuhuasi-cuaa naami! talk-DEI2.PFV downriver Go downriver to talk!

Examples (449)-(452) show the imperatives of Accomplishments with explicit plural addressees and Deictic Perfective Aspects. The subject pronoun is not optional. It can also be observed that the word order of the sentences reflects SVX realis word order.

Examples (453) and (454) are an Achievement and a Semelfactive, respectively. In (453), it does not matter if the rope is in the indicated location or with the addressee who is already ripping it in the unsuitable location. The point is that the addressee is expected to realize the event in the indicated location. Sentence (454) can appear in the two scenarios. It can be used in a rehearsal of a theater play. It can also be uttered to a person who is coughing in another place that the speaker considers unsuitable.

(453) Isiica-cuaa tíira iina iniy+! rip-DEI2.PFV there DET twisted.rope Rip the twisted rope there!

(454) Isiin++-hu++ iíti! cough-DEI1.PFV here Cough here!

Stage-level Statives can appear with Deictic Perfective Aspects in imperatives, as in (455).

(455) Iiqui-hu++ cáami! live-DEI1.PFV upriver Go upriver! (Literally: Be upriver!) 252

Directional Motion verbs, such as iicua- ‘go’ and ani- ‘come,’ are incompatible with -hu++ and -cuaa, as in (456) and (457).

(456) *Iicua-hu++ cáami! go-DEI1.PFV upriver Go upriver!

(457) *Ani-hu++

iíti!

come-DEI1.PFV here

Come here!

Motion verbs, such as n+t+- ‘run,’ can appear with -hu++ and -cuaa only if the actions are to be performed within a restricted area. In (458), the addressee is supposed to arrive at the indicated location, which is near the speaker, and run around that area. If the speaker wants the addressee to run from ‘here’ to ‘there,’ a location indicated by gesture, General Perfective Aspect is used, as in (459). Ablative Perfective Aspect is often used when the destination is not indicated by the speaker, as in (460).

(458) N+t+-hu++ iíti! run-DEI1.PFV here Come here to run!

(459) N+t+-qui

253

Run from here to there!
(460) N+t+-aar++ tíiracuma! run-ABL.PFV unspecific.there (Start to) run (to where I cannot see)!
Allative Perfective Aspect -sahu++ and Ablative Perfective Aspect -(y)aar++ incorporate a directional component. In past perfective declarative sentences, -sahu++ is used to express the realization of an event upon arrival at a location, while -(y)aar++ is used to express the departure from a location upon realization of an event. Imperatives in combination with -sahu++ can be used, but the combination is rarely used. The addressee of such a sentence can only be someone who is already arriving near you and you know in advance that he is coming towards you (i.e. a visitor or some visitors approaching your house, a person or a group of people mooring to the riverbank, among other situations). The addressee is expected to realize the event immediately upon arrival, without doing any other activity in between. Example (461) is directed to a group of people who, you know, are arriving to help you build a house. You see them coming and utter the sentence.
(461) Quinaa=mii-sahu++ iíta iíti! 2P=do-ALL.PFV house here Since you all are arriving, come build a house right away! (Literally: You all, come build a house upon arrival!)
(462) Ariicua-sahu++! 254

sing-ALL.PFV Sing immediately upon arrival!
Imperatives in combination with -(y)aar++, on the other hand, are usually directed to an addressee who is ready to depart from a location which is near the speaker. If directed to an addressee who is not ready to leave, the addressee is expected to realize the indicated event and leave where he is. In (463), the addressee is leaving already, but the speaker wants to listen to one more song, so the sentence is uttered.
(463) Ariicua-aar++! sing-ABL.PFV Sing before you depart!
In (464), it can be seen that the adverbial amaqu+=iira ‘to your trip,’ modifying the verb, is clearly related to the departure from a location.
(464) Cuhuasi-aar++ quia=amaqu+=iira! talk-ABL.PFV 2S=road=GOAL Talk before your trip!
As briefly mentioned earlier in this chapter, as well as in §5, Motion verbs in combination with Ablative Perfective Aspect -(y)aar++ trigger an inceptive reading (i.e. walk away, run away and swim away) and focus on the starting/initial endpoint of Activities, in which case the destination of the motion is not part of the conveyed
255

information. Example (465) is directed to a person who is standing away from the speaker. They are engaged in a walking-related training activity.

(465) Iicuu-yaar++ ácari tíira=ji! walk-ABL.PFV now there=from Now walk from there!

Example (466) is directed to a person near you. The interpretation is hence ‘leave swimming.’

(466) Musi-aar++! swim-ABL.PFV Swim away!

As discussed above, Deictic Perfective Aspect -hu++ is used in the imperative construction. The allomorph of this aspect morpheme -cuhu++103 is never used in imperatives with the exception of the verbs carii- ‘look’ and niqui- ‘see.’ When the speaker orders a person to come towards him to see something, -hu++ is used, as in (467). However, when a person does not believe what the speaker saw, the allomorph -cuhu++ is used, as in (468). Sentence (468) conveys an additional emphatic meaning which presupposes that the listener does not believe the speaker.

(467) Carii-hu++

iina!

look-DEI1.PFV DET

103 Please refer to §5.5 on Deictic Perfective Aspects for more discussion.
256

Come look at this!
(468) Carii-cuhu++ iina! look-DEI1.PFV DET Come look at this yourself! (I am not lying.)
The verb niqui- ‘see’ works the same as the verb carii- ‘look’ in the imperatives.
(469) Niqui-hu++ iina! see-DEI1.PFV DET Come see this!
(470) Niqui-cuhu++ iina! see-DEI1.PFV DET Come see this (if you don’t believe me)!
One more point in terms of the structure of affirmative imperatives is that the Imperfective Aspect can never appear in imperative sentences. In the following, I show ungrammatical examples.
(471) *Musi-i! swim-IPFV Swim!
(472) *Iicuu-yaa! 257

walk-IPFV Walk!
As mentioned in the introduction section, some affirmative imperatives, especially those directed to first person plural inclusive or second person plural, could be structurally ambiguous with a past perfective sentence which indicates a realized event. However, differences exist to distinguish them. First, in affirmative imperatives, explicit pronouns are pronounced with long vowels in the last syllable without high pitch on the first syllable, as p++= ‘first person plural inclusive’ instead of p+= and quinaa= ‘second person plural’ instead of quína=. In past perfective declaratives, these two pronouns are pronounced as having a high pitch on the first syllable and short vowels on all syllables, as p'+= ‘1P.INCL’ and quína= ‘2P.’ Second, non-vowel-hiatus phenomena in certain phonological environments clearly exist in imperatives. In the following, (473) and (474) are imperatives and the explicit pronouns are both pronounced with long vowels before the verbal roots. Examples (475) and (476) are past perfective declaratives and a high pitch is observed on the first syllables of the subject pronouns. It is also noted that the subject pronoun quína= is pronounced with a short vowel at the end. In addition, in (474), an imperative sentence frequently produced by speakers, the barred /i/ of the first person plural pronoun and the /i/ in the verbal root-initial position are clearly two distinct sounds in the imperative construction. In the past perfective sentence (476), a long barred /i/ is observed instead of two distinct sounds. The verbal root isa- ‘urinate’ changes to +sa- in the context of the past perfective declarative.
(473) Quinaa=mii-Ø núquiica iíta! 2P=do-GNR.PFV one house 258

You all build a house!

(474) P++=isa-cuaa! 1P.INCL=urinate-DEI2.PFV Let’s go urinate!

(475) Quína=mii-Ø núquiica iíta. 2P=do-GNR.PFV one house You all built a house (today).

(476) Taaríqui p'+=+sa-cuaa tíira. morning 1P.INCL=urinate there We went there to urinate in the morning.

Third, most perfective declaratives appear with tense markers, as in (477) and (478), while the imperatives are always null-tense marked, as in (473) and (474) above. Fourth, speakers can use a temporal adverbial jaa ‘already’ before the subject pronoun to further clarify a past perfective declarative, as indicated between the parentheses. In (475) above, the temporal adverbial jaa ‘already’ can appear in sentence-initial position. Lastly, speakers also distinguish a declarative from an imperative by their pragmatic knowledge.

(477) Quinaaja, (jaa) quína=mii-Ø-cura

núquiica iíta.

2P

already 2P=do-GNR.PFV-RPST one

house

You all (already) built a house (a few days or a few months ago).

259

(478) Quinaaja, (jaa) quína=mii-Ø-quiaqu+

núquiica iíta.

2P

already 2P=do-GNR.PFV-DPST.NIP one

house

You all (already) built a house (a long time ago).

4.6.2 Jussives When the action-performing referents are third person, the jussive construction is
used to direct to a second person addressee, as in (479) and (480). Jussives cannot be used when the action-performing referents are first or second person, as in (481).

(479) Pá=nu=cuhuasi-i

namiini!

JUSS=3S=talk-IPFV first

Let him talk first!

(480) Pá=na=ariicua-a! JUSS=3P=sing-IPFV Let them sing!

(481) *Pá=qui /cana /p+ /quia/quina=cuhuasi-i! JUSS=1S/1P.EXCL/1P.INCL/2S/2P=talk.IPFV Let me/us (exclusive)/us (inclusive)/you (singular)/ you (plural) sing!

In contrast with the imperative constructions discussed in §4.6.1 above, the jussive construction can only appear with the Imperfective Aspect and can never appear with any of the seven perfective aspects, as in (482).
260

(482) *Pá=nu=cuhuasi-qui! JUSS=3S=talk-GNR.PFV Let him talk!
In addition, while imperatives are only used before the potential event is realized, jussives can be used both before the event is realized as well as when the event is already in process. Example (479) and (480) above can be used to express that the speaker wants the subject(s) to realize the event or continue the event. The addressee is expected to induce, facilitate, or permit the event to be continued. Example (483) in the following is an example that is frequently used by speakers during the daily working sessions. When I bring a hot beverage and invite them to drink, they often use the utterance. It can be clearly observed that the jussive construction can have an event-involving referent which is actually not the action-performing referent. The imperative construction, on the other hand, can only have an action-performing referent as the subject and the addressee of the sentence.
(483) Pá=nu=sucuta-a! JUSS=3S=cool.down Let it cool down!
4.6.3 Negative Imperatives and Jussives In negative contexts, imperatives and jussives have the same structure, both using
a negative particle caa (or ca= as a clitic) in combination with an unmarked perfective
261

aspect -Ø and the morpheme of potential mood -cuma. Negative imperatives, also called ‘prohibitives,’ and jussives are only used before the negative events are realized.
As can be seen from (484) to (488) in the following, negative commands can have all grammatical persons as the action-performing referents, except first person singular and first person plural exclusive. The addressee(s) is second person. The speakers commented that example (484) might be used to think to oneself: ‘I shouldn’t say anything,’ but the sentence is never verbally uttered. Example (485) is ungrammatical. In (486), the addressee is also one of the action-performing referents. In (487), it is noted that the addressee is second person singular and the explicit mention of the subject is optional. However, the negative particle and the second person singular subject pronoun are either both omitted or both present. When the subject is one of the other grammatical persons, the subject pronoun and the negative particle are obligatorily present, as in (486), (488)-(490).

(484) *Ca=qui=cuhuasi-Ø-cuma saaca! NEG=1S=talk-GNR.PFV-POT thing Let me not say anything!

(485) *Ca=cana=cuhuasi-Ø-cuma

saaca!

NEG=1P.EXGL=talk-GNR.PFV-POT thing

Let us not say anything!

(486) Ca=p+=cuhuasi-Ø-cuma

saaca!

NEG=1P.INCL=talk-GNR.PFV-POT thing

Let us not say anything!

262

(487) (Ca=quia=)cuhuasi-Ø-cuma

saaca!

NEG=1P.INCL=talk-GNR.PFV-POT thing

Don’t say anything!

(488) Ca=quina=cuhuasi-Ø-cuma saaca! NEG=2P=talk-GNR.PFV-POT thing You all, don’t say anything!

(489) Iina maaya ca=nu=cuhuasi-Ø-cuma

saaca!

DET child NEG=3S=talk-GNR.PFV-POT thing

That child, don’t let him say anything!

(490) Ca=na=cuhuasi-Ø-cuma

saaca!

NEG=3P=talk-GNR.PFV-POT thing

Don’t let them say anything!

It is noted that the combination of General Perfective Aspect -Ø and the potential mood -cuma is only used in the context of a negative imperative or negative jussive. It is never used in an affirmative context. From the discussion above, we can see that in both affirmative and negative constructions, the word order is observed to reflect realis word order—SVX. The speakers indicate that they expect the addressed events or the associated process of the addressed events to be realized upon uttering the sentences. The following are two textual examples. The speaker expects that the situation can be realized right away.
263

(491) Ca=p+=pajuu-Ø-cuma iip+ p+aarata cayaa-ca… NEG=1P=teach-GNR.PFV DET.PL our person-PL Let’s not teach our people… (T.CJC: 27; re-segmented and translated by IWL)

NEG=2S=tell.to-GNR.PFV-POT nothing who Don’t tell anything to anyone. (T.HMS: 202; re-segmented and translated by IWL)

If the speakers don’t expect the addressed events to take place right away (i.e. immediately or on the same day which includes SpT), they use the Imperfective Aspect (vowel length or -yaa/-aa) and the potential mood -cuma, in combination with the irrealis word order—SXV. In this construction, affirmative or negative, the speaker expresses a weak prediction or wish to indicate that the event might take place in the distant future.

(497) Iina maaya nu=cuhuasi-aa-cuma. DET child 3S=talk-IPFV-POT This child might talk (one day). This child, (I hope) he will talk one day.

In §4.6 above, I discussed imperative and jussive constructions in Iquito in terms of the sentence structure (i.e. the requirement of an explicit pronoun or not), the aspectual morphemes with which they appear, and the mood structure (i.e. word order and relevant characteristics) they associate with in a realis/irrealis system. Iquito imperatives are directed to second person(s). Action-performing referents, on the other hand, can be first person plural inclusive, second person singular, or second person plural. Jussives are directed to second person(s) when the action-performing or -involving referents are third person singular or third person plural.
In affirmative contexts, imperatives and jussives are formally distinct structures, while in negative contexts, imperatives and jussives use the same type of formal structure. In terms of realis/irrealis marking, which is realized by word order, both affirmative and negative imperatives and jussives are observed to reflect realis word order—SVX, instead of irrealis word order—SXV. In this section, I also discuss how imperatives, when there is an explicit pronoun, are distinguished from past perfective
266

declaratives in terms of high pitch and vowel lengthening on the subject pronoun. This section concludes with a brief extension on how the potential mood marker is used in constructions other than negative imperatives.
Iquito imperatives and jussives can be used to give strong commands in which the realization of situations is highly expected by speakers. In addition, they can also be used to give permission, make requests, or provide instructions.
4.7 CONCLUSION In the above chapter, I discussed the grammatical expressions of Iquito mood,
including the semantic contexts and the structural differences between realis and irrealis mood, negation constructions and their structural realization influenced by mood, conditionals and counterfactuality, CF wishes and desideratives, and imperatives and jussives. The terms realis/irrealis are language-specific to some degree as they correspond to two different constructions which are consistently used in sentences of certain modal functions. However, there is not a single meaning assigned for either realis or irrealis mood. When used in non-CF sentences (i.e. affirmative and negative declaratives, interrogatives, non-CF conditionals), the choice between realis and irrealis mood conincides with a speaker’s assessment of time. That is to say, realis mood is chosen for past, present, and immediate future situations and irrealis mood is chosen for near future and more distant future situations. When used in CF sentences (CF statements and conditionals), desideratives, and potential future/optatives, the choice between realis and irrealis mood lies in the speaker’s assessment of factuality. To be exact, irrealis mood, used with a specialized CF morpheme, is chosen for unreal (i.e. PresCF) or unrealizable (i.e. PastCF) situations. The choice of irrealis mood in desideratives and potential future/optative constructions arguably reflect the assessment of both time and factuality.
267

Imperatives display structural properties of both realis and irrealis mood, and may be considered ambiguous or outside of the system in terms of alignment of realis or irrealis mood. In addition, as realis and irrealis mood in Iquito are realized by a typologically uncommon strategy, word order change, I propose to include this as a grammatical means for the expressions of mood. Finally, I propose that Iquito might once have been a SOV language and changed into an SVO language synchronically.

Chapter 5: Viewpoint Aspect
5.1 INTRODUCTION This chapter discusses the grammatical expressions of viewpoint aspects in Iquito,
including their structural and semantic properties. Comrie (1976: 1-3) indicates that “tense,” as a deictic category, “relates the time of the situation referred to to some other time, usually to the moment of speaking” and that “aspects are different ways of viewing the internal temporal constituency of a situation.” Smith (1997: 97) also indicates that “temporal location and aspect are complementary temporal systems. The former locates a situation in time, while the latter specifies the internal temporal structure of the situation.” This dissertation adopts Smith’s (1997[1991]) two-component theory of aspect which includes viewpoint aspects (discussed in §5) and situation aspects (discussed in §6). Viewpoint aspect is conveyed by the grammatical morpheme; situation aspect is conveyed by the verb and its argument. Viewpoint aspects semantically convey boundedness by presenting the situation in part (i.e. unbounded, such as Imperfective Aspect) or in its entirety (i.e. bounded, such as perfective aspect) (Smith, 2005). Situation aspects are characterized in terms of three covert temporal features: dynamism (i.e. agency), duration (i.e. durative vs. instantaneous), and telicity (i.e. completion and change of state). Telic and non-durative events are intrinsically bounded. The term “situation” includes events (i.e. Activities, Accomplishments, Achievements and Semelfactives) and States. These are the five types of “situation aspects,” also termed “situation types.” The characterization of the five situation types in terms of the three temporal features is summarized in the table below. As can be seen, States are [dynamic], [+durative] and [-telic]. Activities are [+dynamic], [+durative] and [-telic]. Accomplishments are [+dynamic], [+durative] and [+telic]. Achievements are
269

[+dynamic], [-durative] and [+telic]. Semelfactives are [+dynamic], [-durative] and [telic]. Besides duration, detachability also distinguishes Accomplishments from Achievements. This chapter focuses on the viewpoint aspects of Iquito and leaves the situation aspects for discussion in §6.

In terms of formal identity, Dahl & Velupillai (2005: 266) indicate that “traditionally, tense and aspect are seen as grammatical categories of verbs,” but they further comment that “periphrastic constructions…are employed in functions similar to those of inflections”; in addition, “tense and aspect do not always present themselves as separate and neatly delineated categories” and “one and the same grammatical form may combine temporal and aspectual elements in its semantics.” According to Bybee et al. (1994), the past tense and perfectives may derive from perfects with respect to grammaticalization paths, and imperfectives from progressives. Therefore, the past tense, perfectives and imperfectives are notably inflectional (i.e. indicated by morphological means) while perfects and progressives are overwhelmingly periphrastic (Dahl and Velupillai, 2005: 266). Out of 222 languages in their sample, only 101 languages have grammatical marking of the perfective/imperfective distinction; their geographical distribution lies “in a band across southern Eurasia from Europe (excluding most of the
270

northern part) to China (but excluding the Dravidian part of South Asia and all of SouthEast Asia)…extending into Africa down to the Equator” (p. 267). The parts of the world that do not have a grammatical perfectivity distinction include “Northern Europe outside the Slavic area” and “large parts of South America and South-East Asia” (p.268). They further comment that “the widespread view of tense and aspect as alternatives to each other-that languages tend to be either tense languages or aspect languages” does not hold and state that “in fact, there are considerably more languages in the sample that have both the aspectual and the temporal categories, or neither of the alternatives, than have one only” (p.268). They characterize the imperfective-perfective distinction as “the basic opposition between one form (or set of forms) which is used exclusively or almost exclusively for single completed events in the past and another form (or set of forms) which is used for everything else” (p. 267). Comrie (1976: 4) indicates that “perfective looks at the situation from outside, without necessarily distinguishing any of the internal structure of the situation, whereas the imperfective looks at the situation from inside, and as such is crucially concerned with the internal structure of the situation.” Smith (2005) indicates that viewpoint aspects semantically convey boundedness by presenting the situation in part or in its entirety. Therefore, languages that have grammatical aspects (viewpoint aspect in Smith’s term) convey perfectivity (i.e. boundedness) information directly while aspectless languages achieve this through inference from the situation types (also termed situation aspect by Smith) of the verb constellation. As for the temporal location of a situation, temporal interpretation is directly attained from tense in tensed languages as tense provides information about the relation between RT and SpT; however, in tenseless languages, temporal interpretation is indirectly inferred from semantic information of aspects (which encode the relation between RT and SitT and boundedness information) and pragmatic principles of interpretation. Moreover, in
271

languages with grammatical aspects, temporal interpretation is even more indirectly inferred from the situation types of the verb constellation in conjunction with pragmatic principles. Boundedness information and the relation between RT and SitT are not grammatically conveyed, but are instead inferred through the situation types. Please see §3 for more discussion of temporal interpretation.
In terms of the position of tense-aspect affixes, Matthew S. Dryer (2005: 282) indicates that “morphological indicators of tense-aspect are [verbal] prefixes and suffixes”; in addition, “there are three less common morphological ways to indicate tense-aspect,” including “tone, infixes, and stem changes.” Indeed, out of 1062 languages with tense-aspect categories in his sample, 150 languages use prefixes, 629 use suffixes, 11 use tone, 133 use combinatory strategies with none primary, and the remaining 139 do not have tense-aspect inflection (i.e. by means of separate words, auxiliary verbs, noninflecting particles, or clitics). He further states that “for many languages, perhaps even a majority, the morphological indicators of tense-aspect on verbs are rather heterogeneous and do not form a single category within the morphological system of the language.” In addition, “there are also many languages which combine prefixes or suffixes with one of the minor strategies.”
In Iquito, verbs, which do not inflect for person and number, obligatorily inflect for tense and aspect in a finite clause, although sometimes either tense or aspect may be realized by the absence of any overt tense-aspect morphology (i.e. Extended Current Tense, General Perfective Aspect in some phonological environments discussed in §5.2). The positions of morphemes inside the verbal complex are fixed as schematized in (502) (repeated from (109)). The optionality and obligatoriness of morphemes are indicated by the presence and absence of parentheses.
272

(502) (Proclitic) = (Prefix) - Verbal Root104 - (Derivational Suffix(es)) - Aspect Tense105 = (Enclitic) (Particle)
As can be seen, verbal suffixation is the prevailing pattern in Iquito. There is only one verbal prefix attested in Iquito, which is the anterior morpheme -(+)ta that goes with the Imperfective Aspect in sentences in the Extended Current Tense to locate an imperfective situation prior to SpT. Tense and aspect information are conveyed by an aspect suffix followed by a tense suffix. Tense and aspect in Iquito are synchronically exclusively verbal formatives and do not attach to nouns or other parts of speech. They are bound morphemes because they have to occur with a verb rather than as a separate word. They are not periphrastic expressions because the sole occurrence of an aspect suffix conveys the aspect information. The position of aspect and tense suffixes are fixed in the verbal complex; therefore, they are structurally homogeneous morphological indicators, as the set of aspect suffixes form a single category within the morphological system while tense suffixes form another. Tense and aspect information are presented, in general, as separate formatives, except in the case of -(y)aariqu+ which is a portmanteau morpheme encoding both Imperfective Aspect and Distant Past Tense.
In a finite clause, one of the three tenses (i.e. Distant Past Tense, Recent Past Tense, and Extended Current Tense) or the potential/optative -cuma has to be used. As for viewpoint aspects, either a perfective or an imperfective aspect is expressed in a sentence. Iquito has a complex system of perfective aspects, including a General, a Momentary, a Remote, two Deictic, an Allative, and an Ablative Perfective Aspect. There is one Imperfective Aspect. In a finite clause, only one aspect can be used and no
104 A verbal stem is used if no derivational suffix is present before the aspect suffix. 105 The potential/optative -cuma structurally patterns with tense formatives. Please refer to §4.5.2 for the discussion.
273

overlapping combination among the aspects, as in (503), is allowed. Besides using grammatical aspects to convey aspectual meaning, lexical verbs, such as stop, can also be used as auxiliaries (inflected for tense and aspect) to convey such a meaning.

The various viewpoint aspect distinctions discussed in the current chapter are summarized in the following table.

Table 12. Viewpoint Aspects in Iquito

Perfectivity Name, Gloss and Forms

Semantics

Perfective General Perfective Aspect It conveys a bounded (i.e. closed) event in

(GNR.PFV): -Ø in Distant which SitT=RT. It generally renders an Past Tense and Recent Past inceptive reading with an extended period of Tense. In Extended Current time in Stative sentences. Tense, -Ø surfaces after a If used in the future context, it contributes to long vowel and -qui surfaces specify the RT of a situation in the immediate

after a short vowel.

future, generally within the same day of SpT.

Momentary Perfective Aspect In a past situation, it conveys an intrinsically

(MMT.PFV): -r++

bounded Achievement for which it spans a

single-stage event with its natural endpoint.

For Accomplishments, Semelfactives, and most Activities, it coerces an ‘in-passing’

reading. More specifically, it indicates ‘the

event is realized in some place, on the way to

some other place, as an interruption of a

larger path.’ For Statives, it generally renders

an inceptive reading and focuses on the initial

endpoints of the States. If used in the future context, it contributes to specify the RT of a situation in the near

future, generally from within a few days of

SpT up to a month.

274

Remote Perfective Aspect Remote Perfective Aspect incorporates an

(REM.PFV): -maa

adverbial component. When used in the past

context, it indicates an event realized in the

morning. When used in the future context, it

contributes to specify the RT of situation in

the remote future, generally from a month up

to two years.

Deictic Perfective Aspect 1 These two aspects incorporate a deictic

(DEI1.PFV): -hu++

component and convey a closed situation

Deictic Perfective Aspect 2 plus the discontinuous post-stage in terms of

(DEI2.PFV): -cuaa

change of location at SpT.

With respect to the deictic property, two

systems of deixis are represented by Deictic

Perfective Aspects: one is the speaker-

centered river-oriented deixis and the other is

the speaker-centered radial deixis. The

formative -hu++ is used to indicate upriver

orientation or the area in the proximity of the

speaker while the formative -cuaa is used to

indicate downriver orientation or an area

away from the speaker. The switch of the

deixis depends on the explicit use of the

deictic adverbials.

Allative Perfective Aspect These two aspects incorporate a directional

It is noted that the definitions of the terms used for the Iquito aspects are language-specific to some degree and are not necessarily the same as used in the literature on other languages. In addition, the table above only provides a general characterization of these aspects. Their detailed usage, including the use of aspects in imperatives and their meanings, are provided in their respective sections of this chapter. General Perfective Aspect is discussed in §5.2, Momentary Perfective Aspect in §5.3, Remote Perfective Aspect in §5.4, the two Deictic Perfective Aspects in §5.5, Allative and Ablative Perfective Aspects in §5.6 and Imperfective Aspect in §5.7. In §5.8, I draw a conclusion and summary for this chapter.
5.2 GENERAL PERFECTIVE ASPECT
5.2.1 General Characterization of Semantics and Forms
This section discusses General Perfective Aspect (glossed as GNR.PFV; referred to as GNRPFV hereafter in this chapter) in Iquito. GNRPFV is used in past contexts with realis106 word order (SVX), in immediate-future107 contexts with irrealis word order (SXV), and in imperative constructions. This section discusses the first two contexts in detail and briefly includes its use in imperatives which is discussed in detail in §4.6. When used in the past context, it conveys a bounded (i.e. closed) event in which SitT overlaps with RT. It generally renders an inceptive reading in Stative sentences. When the adverbial jaa ‘already’ is used, the sentence presents properties of the perfect in which SitT precedes RT. When used in the context of the immediate future, the sentence
106 For a detailed discussion of grammatical mood, please refer to §4. 107 When speakers talk about events that will take place on the same day, they use different strategies: Imperfective Aspect -yaa ~ -: with the realis word order (SVO) if they view the situation as already in progress; General Perfective Aspect -qui ~ -Ø with the irrealis word order (SXV) if they view the situation as being realized later on the day of SpT with more distance; Momentary Perfective Aspect -r++ with the irrealis word order (SXV) if they view the situation with even greater temporal distance.
276

displays irrealis word order and an explicit reference time is usually given, but not required. The sentence indicates that the action will be realized on the same day as SpT.
GNRPFV is not overtly marked in sentences in the Recent Past and Distant Past Tenses. In sentences in the Extended Current Tense, which is formally unmarked, the formative -qui surfaces after the verbal stem (i.e. the verbal root with or without derivational suffixes) ending in a short vowel, except when followed by certain clitics, in which case it is unmarked. It is also unmarked after the verbal stem ending in a long vowel. In the following, I provide a paradigm of two verbs with GNRPFV in the context of Distant Past Tense, Recent Past Tense, and Extended Current Tense with an enclitic and without an enclitic. The verbal root sani- ‘try’ ends with a short vowel and the verbal root najuu- ends with a long vowel. In the following table, the verbs do not contain derivational suffixes after the verbal root. For an explaination in favor of analyzing -qui as synchronically an allomorph of GNRPFV instead of an allomorph of Extended Current Tense, please refer to §3.

5.2.2 Past Context
This section discusses what types of situation GNRPFV appears with and the types of closure it conveys. I then discuss how GNRPFV associates with RT.
5.2.2.1 Situation Types and Type of Perfective Closure
GNRPFV appears with all situation types (i.e. Stative, Activity, Accomplishment, Achievement, and Semelfactive). It spans the initial and final endpoints of Activities and Accomplishments, presenting them as closed situations. For Achievements, which are single-stage events and generally apply to Momentary108 Perfective Aspect (§ 5.3), GNRPFV spans the single-stage interval plus an extended post-stage, indicating that the Achievement situations are realized before a certain reference point, usually the moment of speech if in the present or the time of a past situation if in the past. For the single-stage Semelfactives, GNRPFV views both the single event (with natural final endpoints) and multiple events (with arbitrary final endpoints) of Semelfactives as closed situations. When it appears with Statives, it generally triggers an inceptive reading and spans the initial endpoint plus an extended interval, indicating that the situation begins before a certain reference point. For the inceptive reading of Statives which focuses solely on the initial endpoint (i.e. rather than initial endpoint plus an extended interval), then Momentary Perfective Aspect is usually used. There is one exception with the verb ihuiini ‘live, stage-level109 be’ which has a locative interpretation when combined with
108 Achievements use Momentary Perfective Aspect -r++ when an RT, which corresponds to SitT (i.e. the event is realized), is given or implied. When used in sentences in Extended Current Tense, the SitT is understood as being in the proximity of SpT. 109 Stage-level be, which holds of stages of individuals and applies to a state of transitory properties, is the counterpart of individual-level be, which holds of individuals. One example of this distinction is the Spanish estar and ser, respectively.
278

Distant Past Tense; GNRPFV in this case presents a closed state which no longer obtains. In summary, GNRPFV presents all events as closed situations. As for shifted Stative situations, GNRPFV focuses on the initial endpoint and the extended interval without giving information with respect to its continuation; such sentences are open and are compatible with sentences which assert that the state continues or that the state no longer obtains.
As for the types of closure, for non-stative verb constellations, GNRPFV presents Activities with arbitrary final endpoints, Accomplishments with natural final endpoints or termination, Semelfactives with natural final endpoints as single-stage events and with arbitrary final endpoints as multiple events, and Achievements with single-stage events plus an extended post-stage. When GNRPFV is used with Accomplishments, it generally implies completion. However, termination is suggested if a perfective sentence is coordinated with another sentence which asserts an open situation. Therefore, GNRPFV is terminative instead of completive. Although completion is generally inferred, it is not obligatory and can be further emphasized by an adverbial p+y++ni ‘entirely’ or by a lexical verb p+ca- ‘finish.’ For Statives, it coerces an initial endpoint of the situation and an extended interval. I give detailed discussions with examples in the following. The following diagram is the general temporal schema for GNRPFV.

Examples (504) to (518) in the following show that GNRPFV appears with all types of situations in different tenses.

GNRPFV in Iquito presents all events (i.e. Activity, Accomplishment, Achievement, and Semelfactive) as closed. The type of closure is the same for Activities (510)-(512) and Semelfactives (513)-(515). It represents arbitrary final endpoints for Activities. As can be seen from examples (510)-(512), GNRPFV presents closure whether the duration of Activities is specified or not. It represents natural final endpoints of single-stage Semelfactives, as in (515), and represents arbitrary final endpoints of multiple-event (derived) Activities, as in (513)-(514). For Achievements, however, it spans the final endpoint plus an extended post-stage. As can be seen in (507), the sentence is uttered only when the subject of the sentence arrived a while ago already. If the sentence is uttered near the moment of arrival, Momentary Perfective Aspect is used, as in (519).

(519) Jaa iina sihuaan+-r++-Ø

caa.

DET 1P.INCL=ANT-wait-SUB.NEG-IPFV-EC NEG

The painted queen that we were not expecting just arrived.

283

Another example is that the speakers often uttered the following sentence when the minidisc ran out out. I asked if I can utter the sentence (521) instead. They commented that I clearly can, but only when the mini-disc had run out a while ago already and we didn’t realize that it was not recording anything anymore.

(520) (Jaa) nu=p+qu+-r++-Ø. (already) 3S=end-MMT.PFV-EC It (already) ran out. Literally: It (already) ended.

(521) Jaa nu=p+qu+-qui-Ø. already 3S=end-GNR.PFV-EC It already ran out (a while ago). Literally: It already ended (a while ago).

The other clear example can be found in the when- construction of two Achievement verbs where the when- clause indicates an RT and uses Momentary Perfective Aspect. It can be seen that the second clause, which takes place earlier, uses GNRPFV.

When I arrived there (yesterday), he had already finished writing two letters.

284

For Accomplishments, GNRPFV semantically conveys termination instead of completion. Completion is generally inferred and can be cancelled if the perfective sentence is coordinated with another sentence which asserts an open situation as can be seen in (523) and (524). If completion is semantically encoded, such a conjunction should not be possible.

nu-huintana-ca.

1S=do-IPFV-EC at.that.moment=NWR 3S-window-PL

Completion is emphasized by an adverbial p+y++ni ‘entirely’ or by a lexical verb p+ca‘finish,’ as can be seen in (525) and (526), respectively.

(525) Nu=p+ca-Ø-cura

3S=read-GNR.PFV-RPST DET book

He read this book entirely.

Sentences (525) and (526) are not compatible with a clause which asserts that the event is not completed, as can be seen in (527) and (528) in the following.

(527) #Nu=p+ca-Ø-cura

iina simitaani simiím+,110

110 The pound sign # is used to indicate semantically ill-formed sentences. Examples (527) and (528) are each composed of two clauses which are grammatical individually. However, when combined together, they become semantically weird.
286

The closed reading of the perfective viewpoint can be further confirmed by the sequential reading in the after- clause as in (529).

(529) Amicaáca nu=simiita-Ø-cura.

Atiíjijaa, nu=asa-Ø-cura.

one.day.away 3S=read-GNR.PFV-RPST afterwards 3S=eat-GNR.PFV-RPST

Yesterday he read. Afterwards, he ate.

GNRPFV conveys closed readings in the when- constructions as well. Whether the situation in the when- clause is realized before that in the principal clause or after that in the principal clause depends on which temporal adverbial or temporal connective111 is used. In (530), the event of [he receive money] takes place before the event of [he buy a beer]. The two clauses are connected by the temporal connective atií ‘then, at that moment/location’ which points to the time when the event [he receive money] is realized. In (531), repeated from (522), the event of [he arrive] takes place after the event of [he finish writing two letters]. The principal clause begins with the temporal adverbial jaa ‘already’ which places the SitT of [he finish writing two letters] before the RT which is introduced by the event of [he arrive]. Both sentences (530) and (531) render sequential readings.

When the GNRPFV appears in Stative sentences, it generally triggers an inceptive reading, as in (516)-(518) above. The Stative verb ihuiini ‘live, stage-level be’ generally combines with Imperfective Aspect and indicates the meaning that ‘a person/being/thing lives or exists,’ ‘a person/being/thing is located in a certain place,’ or ‘a person is in a certain (emotional) state.’ When combined with GNRPFV, the sentence renders an inceptive reading. GNRPFV, however, does not only coerce an initial point of the State, it actually spans the initial endpoint plus an extended interval, indicating that the situation begins before the RT. Compare the sentence (532) and (533) below. Example (532) is used at the moment or right after the moment of the village leader’s revival. Example (533) is used after the event takes place a while already. It can be seen that for the inceptive reading of Statives which focuses solely on the initial endpoint, Momentary Perfective Aspect is used.

The village leader (really) revived quite recently.

In (534) and (535), the verb pariini ‘be able to’ generally combines with Imperfective Aspect and indicates the meaning that ‘a person is capable of doing something.’ When combined with Momentary or General Perfective Aspect, the sentences render an inceptive reading. The consultant Ligia gave the following scenario: A person went to collect some firewood. It was too heavy so he could not carry it. He kept trying and finally stood up with the entire pile of firewood. The sentence (534) can be uttered at this moment by other people. He went on walking for a while. The sentence (535) can be uttered by other people.

or interval is indicated, the RT is understood as either overlapping with SpT or being fairly recent with respect to SpT, depending on the use of aspect. The form of =yaajaa surfaces as =quiyaajaa in the sentences in Extended Current Tense. The ‘jaa’ part is not pronounced if not in the sentence-final position.
289

In (536) and (537), the verb nacusiini ‘know’ also usually combines with Imperfective Aspect and means ‘a person has the knowledge of something,’ ‘a person/being knows in a dispositional sense,’ or ‘a person is acquainted with someone.’ When combined with Momentary or General Perfective Aspect, the sentences render an inceptive reading. The speaker Ligia gave the following scenario: A person did not know how to weave leaves and was learning. When he started to weave well, (536) could be uttered. When he wove a while or later in the same day, (537) could be uttered.

(537) Nu=nacusi-qui-Ø

It is worth noting that Stative sentences with an inceptive reading can freely combine with a momentary temporal adverbial, as in (538) and (539).

There is one exception with the verb ihuiini ‘live, stage-level be’ which has locative interpretation in Distant Past Tense, as in (540). GNRPFV in this case presents a closed state which no longer obtains, as in (541)-(543). Examples (540) and (541) indicate that the state has ended and that the subject of the sentence no longer lives in Iquitos anymore, a closed interpretation.

Shifted Stative situations with the inceptive reading, on the other hand, focus on the initial endpoint and the extended interval without giving information with respect to the situation’s continuation. Such sentences are open and are compatible with sentences which assert that the state continues, as in (548), or that the state no longer obtains, as in (549).

In summary, GNRPFV in Iquito presents a sentence with the endpoint properties of its situation type schema for Activities and Semelfactives. For Accomplishments, it presents closed situations with terminative endpoints. For Achievements, it presents closed situations with their natural endpoints plus an extended post-stage. For most States, it presents coerced initial endpoints with an extended interval.

5.2.2.2 Reference Time and General Perfective Aspect As mentioned above, GNRPFV is mostly used in a past context and conveys a
bounded event in which SitT=RT. Consider the following sentence. In (550), the temporal adverb amicaáca ‘one day away’ specifies the reference time and also the time when the event took place.

(550) Amicaáca qui=iicua-Ø-cura

tíira naqui-cuura.

one.day.away 1S=go-GNR.PFV-RPST there forest-DST

Yesterday I went to the forest. 294

However, when the adverb jaa ‘already’ is attached to it, the sentence presents properties of the perfect which is SitT<RT, as (531) above, and (551)-(554) below. It conveys that situation time precedes reference time. Example (551) contains Extended Current Tense which provides an RT frame from the day of SpT extending into the infinite future. Without any temporal adverbial, the more precise temporal location is inferred to be prior to SpT.114 With an explicit temporal adverb, such as jaa ‘already,’ the temporal location is specified. The event [he read this book] took place before the present moment.

In (552), the specified RT of the principal clause is ‘the moment when you arrived there this morning.’ The event [I eat] took place before the specified RT.

114 See §3 for a detailed discussion on temporal interpretation and information.
295

In (553), the RT of the principal clause is ‘the moment when I arrived yesterday.’ The event [he leave] took place before RT.

(553) Amicaáca j++ticari qui=sihuaan+-r++-cura,jaa nu=iicua-Ø-cura. one.day.away when 1S=arrive-MMT.PFV already 3S=go-GNR.PFV-RPST Yesterday when I arrived, he already left.

Sentence (554) is a question and was elicited in the following context: the addressee being asked moved to the speaker’s village several years ago and the speaker asks if the addressee met the speaker’s brother before moving to the village. The RT of the principal clause is ‘the moment when you arrived that year.’ The event [you meet (you start to know)] took place before the RT.

It is worth noting that jaa ‘already’ indicates that SitT<RT. Therefore, it is not compatible with the enclitic =yaa(jaa) which anchors to RT and indicates that SitT=RT, as in (555) and (556).

5.2.3 Immediate-Future Context and Imperatives GNRPFV is mostly used in a past context, but can also be used to refer to events
which will take place on the same day of SpT. In addition, it is also used in imperative constructions of Activities and Accomplishments. In this section, I discuss the use in these contexts.

5.2.3.1 Immediate Future Context When referring to future situations, speakers use different strategies according to
temporal distance, relative to SpT. When speakers talk about events that will take place on the same day, they very often use Imperfective Aspect -yaa ~ -: with realis word order (SVX), seeing the SpT as part of the entire situation, hence already in progress. They can also use GNRPFV -qui ~ -Ø with irrealis word order (SXV), seeing the situation as more distant temporally and SpT as not part of the entire situation. An utterance of this type is less common, but is sometimes encountered. Finally, they can also use Momentary Perfective Aspect -r++ with irrealis word order (SXV), seeing the situation with even greater temporal distance. The difference between the second (GNRPFV with irrealis word order) and the third (Momentary Perfective Aspect with the irrealis word order)
297

strategies is that the second strategy does not require an explicit temporal reference and the situation is understood to be realized later in the same day of SpT. The third strategy, however, requires an explicit temporal reference if the sentence indicates an event which will take place on the same day. Without a specific temporal reference, the interpretation is that the event will take place within a few days up to a month. To refer to a longer distance in time, Remote Perfective Aspect -maa with irrealis word order is used. The interpretation is that the event will take place within a month, up to a few years. To refer to an even longer temporal distance, Imperfective Aspect -yaa ~ -:, in combination with the potential/optative -cuma and irrealis word order, is used. The interpretation is that the event will presumably take place in the very distant future.
Example (557) is uttered in the late afternoon and speakers choose to use realis word order with Imperfective Aspect.

(557) Ácari iina niínaqui, qui=maqu+-i-Ø suhuaata. now DET night 1S=sleep-IPFV-EC well Tonight, I am going to sleep well.

Examples (558) and (560) are uttered in the morning. Example (559) is uttered in the afternoon. Both Hermico and Ema use irrealis word order plus GNRPFV. Jaime commented that sentence (558) is good for him, but he prefers to use Momentary Perfective Aspect -r++ instead, as in (560). In all three sentences, an explicit temporal reference is given.

(558) Ácari iina niínaqui, qui=suhuaata maqu+-qui-Ø.

now DET night 1S=well

now DET night 1S=well

sleep-MMT.PFV-EC

Tonight, I am going to sleep well.

It is worth noting that no explicit temporal reference is required when GNRPFV is used in the future context. The event is understood to be realized later in the same day, as in (561). The speakers were talking about a football team which needs a coach. The game will take place in the near future which corresponds to the use of -r++ with the irrealis word order. The speakers commented that they will look for a coach today to start directing them today, which corresponds to the use -qui ~ -Ø with irrealis word order.

person look.for-GNR.PFV-EC REL 1P.INCL=look-APPL-GNR.PFV-EC Who will direct our game? We will look for a person who will direct us.

Remote Perfective Aspect -maa is used with irrealis word order when referring to a more distant future. The speaker Jaime commented that the event in example (562) will eventually take place, but it will take a longer time. Hermico commented that the time the event will take place ranges from 10 days to a few months with respect to SpT.

núquiica simiím+.

Some day, I will write you a letter.

When an even more distant future is referred to, Imperfective Aspect, potential/optative -cuma and irrealis word order are used, as in (563). Jaime and Hermico commented that when the following sentence is uttered, the speaker does not guarantee the writing of letter. He might not write a letter after all. Hermico further commented, when I asked about this sentence, that he feels there is no hope of receiving the letter from me because there is no certainty expressed by the sentence.

(563) Tácari yahu++ni=jina, qui=quia najuu-nii-yaa-cuma-Ø núquiica simiím+.

5.2.3.2 Imperatives In addition to the declarative constructions, GNRPFV is also used in imperatives
of Activities and Accomplishments. Speakers use this construction to order or request a person (who is usually next to them) to perform the action at the same place where they are. For imperatives which involve the motion of the subject, Deictic Perfective Aspects are used instead. I provide a few examples here. For a detailed discussion of imperative constructions, please refer to §4.6.1.

5.2.4 Summary In this section, I discussed the use and the meaning of GNRPFV in Iquito.
GNRPFV is mostly used in a past context with realis word order (SVX). In addition, it is also used with irrealis word order (SXV) in the context of the immediate future to indicate a situation on the same day of SpT. Finally, it is used in imperatives of Activities and Accomplishments. This section discussed the first two uses of GNRPFV in detail and briefly included its use in imperatives. In a past context, it conveys a bounded event in which SitT=RT. When the adverbial jaa ‘already’ is used, the sentence presents properties of the perfect in which SitT<RT. Perfective Statives generally render an inceptive reading. As for the type of closure, GNRPFV presents a sentence with the endpoint properties of its situation type schema for Activities and Semelfactives. For Accomplishments, it presents closed situations with terminative endpoints. For Achievements, it presents closed situations with their natural endpoints plus an extended post-stage. For most States, it presents coerced initial endpoints with an extended interval.
5.3 MOMENTARY PERFECTIVE ASPECT 5.3.1 General Characterization of Semantics and Forms
This report discusses Momentary Perfective Aspect (glossed as MMT.PFV; referred to as MMTPFV hereafter in this chapter) in Iquito. MMTPFV is used in past
302

contexts with realis115 word order (SVX), in near-future contexts with irrealis word order (SXV), and in imperative constructions of Achievements. This work discusses the first two uses in detail and briefly includes the imperative use.116 MMTPFV appears with all situation types. In past contexts, it conveys an intrinsically bounded Achievement for which it spans the single-stage event with its natural endpoint. For Accomplishments, Semelfactives, and most Activities, it coerces an ‘in-passing’ reading. More specifically, it indicates ‘the event is realized in some place, on the way to some other place, as an interrupting activity within a larger path.’ For Statives, it generally renders an inceptive reading which focuses on the initial endpoints of States.
MMTPFV also appears with all situation types in the context of the near future. Such sentences display irrealis word order and an explicit temporal reference is usually given. Without an explicit temporal reference, the situation is interpreted as one that will be realized within a few days or within up to a month. With an explicit temporal reference, it can be used to indicate a situation which will be realized later in the same day of SpT, the following day, or further in the future. The ‘in passing’ reading does not arise in the use of a future context. In imperative constructions, MMTPFV is only used with Achievements.
MMTPFV is marked as -r++ in all clauses. In the following, I provide a paradigm of two verbs with MMTPFV in sentences in the Distant Past Tense, Recent Past Tense, Extended Current Tense not followed by an enclitic, followed by a clitic, and the context of near future. The verbal root sihuaan+- ‘arrive’ ends with a short vowel and the verbal root najuu- ‘write’ ends in a long vowel. It can be seen in the table that MMTPFV does not have allomorphs due to the change of the phonological environment.
115 For a detailed discussion on grammatical mood, please refer to §4. 116 Please see §4.6 for a detailed discussion on imperatives.

5.3.2 Past Context: Situation types, Type of Perfective Closure and Reference Time This section discusses the situation types MMTPFV appears with and the
meanings it conveys, including how MMTPFV associates with RT. MMTPFV appears with all situation types (i.e. Stative, Activity,
Accomplishment, Achievement, and Semelfactive). It spans intrinsically bounded single304

stage Achievements. For Statives, it coerces derived Achievements which focus on the instantaneous initial endpoints. For Accomplishments, multiple-event Semelfactives, and most Activities, it associates the temporal schema to a short interval of time and triggers an ‘in-passing’ reading. More specifically, it indicates ‘the event is realized in some place, on the way to some other place.’ Finally, for certain Motion Activities, such as ‘swim’ and ‘run,’ it renders an inceptive ‘fast’ reading which focuses on the initial point of the fast part of Activities in which the actions are realized rapidly. I give detailed discussions with examples in the following.
Examples (569) to (583) in the following show that MMTPFV appears with all types of situations in different tenses.

Achievements MMTPFV spans the temporal schema of intrinsically bounded single-stage
Achievements which are “instantaneous events that result in a change of state” (Smith, 1997). In a sentence where it appears, an explicit temporal reference which corresponds to SitT is usually given, as in (573) and (574) above. In sentences in the Extended Current Tense, the moment of the Achievement event is understood as being realized in the proximity of SpT, as can be seen in (584) and (585). Note that (584) is uttered without the temporal adverb jaa ‘already.’ When the sentence is repeated again, jaa ‘already’ is added. Within about five to ten minutes from the moment when the Achievement event is realized, (585) is used. Sentence (586) is used when the subject of the sentence has woken up for at least half an hour or more.

(584) (Jaa)

nu=iniica-r++-Ø.

(already) 3S=wake.up-MMT.PFV-EC

He (already) woke up.

(586) Jaa

nu=iniica-qui-Ø.

Already 3S=wake.up-GNR.PFV-EC

He already woke up a while ago.

Sentence (587) is another pertinent example to show that MMTPFV is used corresponding to the moment when the Achievement event is realized. The mother is talking to the baby, complaining that she is still cooking and cannot attend to him right at this moment. MMTPFV is used in the first sentence.

(587) ++, jaa quia=iniica-r++-Ø

maaya.

Qui=capi-i-Ø

atií=yaajaa.

1S=cook-IPFV-EC at.the.moment=NWR

Ah, you woke up already, child. I am still cooking now.

In sentences in the Recent Past Tense and Distant Past Tense, MMTPFV is used when the moment the Achievement event takes place is given by an explicit temporal reference, as in (573) and (574), implied by temporal terms, such as j++ticari ‘when,’ as in (588) and
309

(589), or understood as happening on a particular day, as in (590). When the clause of an Achievement event serves as the RT of the other clause, MMTPFV is also used. In (588), the moment of [I arrive] serves as the RT of the principal clause; MMTPFV is used on the verb sihuaan+- ‘arrive.’ The event [he finish writing two letters] takes place prior to the indicated RT. Therefore, GNRPFV is used with the Achievement verb p+ca- ‘finish’ together with the temporal adverb jaa ‘already.’

In (589), the child does not stop talking until the moment when the movie ends. The Achievement verb p+qu+- ‘end’ uses MMTPFV. The Achievement verb quit++- ‘stop,’ again, uses MMTPFV.

When a person changes his position from lying down to being upright, he is getting up. The verb san+- ‘get up,’ as in (592), encodes an instantaneous event when the change of state results. This can be seen from the fact that it is compatible with a punctual adverb, as in (596).

The verb jicat+- ‘exit’ encodes the instantaneous event of a person exiting the door, or of an animal exiting a hole, among others. When MMTPFV is used, it means the person exited the door without leaving the house too far away, as in (593). Consultants Jaime and Ema commented that when (599) is used, it means an animal came out of a hole or a person exited the door from the house.

(599) Nu=jicat+-r++-Ø. 3S=exit-MMT.PFV-EC He came out.

The verb jicat+- ‘exit’ can be used in the sense of ‘leave’ if followed by Ablative

The transitive verb p+ca- ‘finish’ encodes an instantaneous event in which a person finishes a certain task. In contrast, the intransitive verb p+qu+- ‘end’ encodes the meaning that an object of a certain quantity runs out, such as a movie ending, a tape finishing recording, a bottle of water running out, among others. It combines with MMTPFV when the above-mentioned events occur. When combined with Ablative Perfective Aspect -(y)aar++, it can be used to indicate the ending of a person’s life, as in (602), or a light bulb’s life, as in (603), which do not have a fixed length in Iquito speakers’ mind.

In addition, the intransitive verb p+qu+- ‘end’ can also combine with Ablative Perfective Aspect -(y)aar++ to mean that a stick disappears in a deep hole full of soft mud, or in a hollow wood trunk. The use with Ablative Perfective Aspect is discussed in detail in §5.6.

Statives MMTPFV coerces derived Achievements for Statives and focuses on the
instantaneous initial endpoints. The stative verb ihuiini ‘live, stage-level be’ generally combines with the Imperfective Aspect. When used with MMTPFV, it triggers an inceptive reading, as in (605). Example (605) is used right after the moment of the village leader’s revival. Example (606), with GNRPFV, is used after the event has been taking place for a while already. Hermico commented that sentences (605) and (606) each can have two different readings. It can be that the existing village leader revived or it can be the case that the village did not have a leader and recently nominated one and now they

315

have a new village leader. Example (607) presents the beginning of a new emotional state of being happy.

The verb pariini ‘be able to’ generally combines with the Imperfective Aspect. When used with MMTPFV, it renders an inceptive reading, as in (608). The same applies to the verb nacusiini ‘know,’ as in (609). For more relevant discussion on the inceptive reading of Statives, please also refer to the discussion on GNRPFV.

‘In-Passing’ Reading and the inceptive ‘Fast’ reading For Accomplishments, multiple-event Semelfactives, and most Activities,
MMTPFV associates the temporal schema to a short interval of time and triggers an ‘inpassing’ reading, meaning ‘the event is realized in some place, on the way to some other place.’ For some Motion Activities, such as ‘swim’ and ‘run,’ it renders an inceptive ‘fast’ reading which focuses on the initial point of the fast part of events in which the actions are realized rapidly. The final destinations of these events are usually understood or expressed in the discourse context.
For most Activities, MMTPFV renders an ‘in-passing’ reading. Example (610) means that a person is traveling and cooked here, on the way to some other place. The sentence renders an ‘in passing’ reading and does not have a ‘fast’ reading. As can be seen, it is compatible with the manner adverb macuaarica ‘slowly.’

(610) Iíti nu=capi-r++-Ø

(macuaarica).

Here 3S=cook-MMT.PFV-EC slowly

Here he cooked (slowly) in passing.

A point worthy of note is that the place of passing is assumed to be here, where the sentence is uttered, if it is not specified in the sentence. In addition, the information about the destination of the trip is not always specified, but can be, as in (611).

p+-isacuma.

3S=fly-MMT.PFV-RPST 1P.INCL-above

For Accomplishments, MMTPFV also renders an ‘in-passing’ reading, as in (613) and (614). Example (613) means that a person was traveling, but stopped over at a place to read a book then left to continue his trip afterwards. For example in (614), Hermico gave the following scenario. Some family members of a person are looking for him and asked the people in town if he was seen at all. The people in town can answer the question using (614), meaning a long time ago, he wrote a letter here when he was traveling.

3S=write-MMT.PFV-DPST.NIP one letter

For Semelfactives, it also renders an ‘in-passing’ reading. For (615), the speaker gave the following scenario. A person who coughs a lot passed here when he was on his way to his chacra.120 When he passed here yesterday, he was coughing.
(615) Amicaáca nu=isiin++-r++-cura. one.day.away 3S=cough-MMT.PFV-RPST Yesterday he coughed in passing.
For some Motion Activities, such as ‘swim’ and ‘run,’ MMTPFV renders an inceptive ‘fast’ reading and focuses on the initial point of the fast part of events in which actions are realized rapidly. Consultants Jaime and Hermico gave the following scenario about an event of ‘running.’ A running race is about to begin. All the competitors line up and prepare to run. The judge counts to three and all the competitors start to run. At this moment, (616) is used, indicating that Ablative Perfective Aspect -(y)aar++ encodes the initial points of the running event. When the runners were running, Imperfective Aspect is used, as in (617). One of the runners tried running really fast to arrive at the finish line first. Sentence (618) with MMTPFV is used to describe the initial point of this part of the event. Sentence (619) is used after (618) is uttered.
(616) Jaa na=n+ti-aar++-Ø. already 3S=run-ABL.PFV-EC They just started to run.
120 Chacra is a local Spanish term, which is a field in which crops and fruit are cultivated, situated away from the village.

The other example with the inceptive ‘fast’ reading is the Motion verb musi- ‘swim.’ Sentence (620) means a person swam really fast in order to reach the river bank or the edge of a lake. Note that the final destination of Motion Activities which use MMTPFV is usually pragmatically understood or expressed in the discourse context.

5.3.3 Near-Future Context and Imperatives MMTPFV is used in the past as well as in near-future contexts. In addition, it is
also used in imperative constructions of Achievements.
320

5.3.3.1 Near-Future Context MMTPFV -r++ with irrealis word order (SXV) is used to indicate situations in
the near future, the temporal distance of which is not rigidly fixed in terms of a metrical conception of time. Without any explicit temporal reference, the event in the sentence, as it is interpreted, will take place from within a few days up to a month. However, if an explicit temporal reference is given, the time frame a sentence can indicate ranges from an event which will take place on the same day to an event which will occur in one to two years. To refer to a longer distance in time, speakers use Remote Perfective Aspect -maa with irrealis word order (SXV). The consultants commented that the event will take place from within a month, up to a few years. The boundary between the use of MMTPFV and that of Remote Perfective Aspect in future situations is clearly not rigid and reflects the flexibility of speaker’s choice. To refer to an even longer temporal distance, speakers use the Imperfective Aspect -yaa ~ -: plus the potential/optative -cuma, together with irrealis word order (SXV). The speakers commented that the event will or will not take place a long time later.
Examples (621)-(625) in the following show that MMTPFV appears with all situation types in near-future contexts. It can be seen that the sentences display the SXV pattern for transitive verbs. For intransitive verbs, as in (622)-(624), the adverbs amicaáca ‘one day away’ can optionally cliticize onto the subject, displaying an SXV pattern as well. However, the adverb can also appear in the sentence-initial position, leaving nothing standing between the subject and the verbal complex, in which case the subject does not phonologically fuse with the verbal complex and the phonologically independent form of pronoun is used. For a detailed discussion on the grammatical irrealis mood, please refer to §4.
321

It is worthy of note that when MMTPFV is used in near-future contexts, it applies to all situation types and does not have shifted readings, such as an ‘in-passing’ reading.

To express an ‘in-passing’ reading in the near-future context, an explicit adverbial clause or phrase is required, as in examples (626)-(633). In (626), the principal clause simply states that the event [he writer a letter] will take place tomorrow. The subordinate adverbial clause narrows down the RT to the time ‘when he passes by.’

j++ticari nu=ar++-r++-Ø. when 3S=pass-MMT.PFV-EC Tomorrow he will write a letter when he passes by.

Example (627) shows that an adverbial phrase can also be used to specify the ‘in-passing’ reading.

(627) Achievement with ‘in passing’ reading Amicaáca nuu sihuaan+-r++-Ø ar++ni=jata. One.day.away 3S arrive-MMT.PFV-EC pass.INF=COM Tomorrow he will arrive in passing.

323

For the Achievement verb sihuaan+- ‘arrive,’ the consultants prefer to use another independent clause to indicate that the subject of the sentence will arrive, but will go soon. They commented that the constellation [he arrive in passing] does not really make sense in Iquito. Instead, the constellation [he pass.by] can be used, as Amicaáca nuu ar++-r++ ‘tomorrow he will pass by.’

In (629), if the adverbial cáamicu-cu ‘towards upriver’ were not used, the sentence would not render an ‘in-passing’ reading. In (630), it is shown that the place of ‘eating’ can be omitted and the adverbial cáamicu-cu ‘towards upriver’ can enter the interruptive position between the subject and the verbal complex.

5.3.3.2 Imperatives In addition to declarative constructions, MMTPFV is also used in imperatives of
Achievements. Speakers use this construction to order the person who is next to them to perform the action at the same place where they are. For imperatives which involve the motion of the subject, Deictic Perfective Aspects are used instead. When applying MMTPFV to other situation types, the addressee is expected to realize the event in passing. In this section, I provide a couple of common usages. For a detailed discussion on imperative constructions, please refer to §4.6.1.
(634) Tacu-r++! stand.up-MMT.PFV Stand up!
(635) Cari-r++! look-MMT.PFV Look! (also: Attention!)
5.3.4 Summary In this section, I discussed the use and the meaning of MMTPFV in Iquito.
MMTPFV is used in past situations with realis word order (SVX), in near-future situations with irrealis word order (SXV) and in the imperative constructions of Achievements. This section discussed the first two uses in detail and introduced its use in imperatives. In past contexts, it conveys an intrinsically bounded Achievement for which it spans the single-stage event with its natural endpoint. For Accomplishments, Semelfactives, and most Activities, it coerces an ‘in-passing’ reading. For Statives, it
326

generally renders an inceptive reading which solely focuses on the initial endpoints of the States. In near-future contexts, it is used for all situation types without the ‘in-passing’ reading, which needs to be further specified by an adverbial clause or phrase.
5.4 REMOTE PERFECTIVE ASPECT
5.4.1 General Characterization of Semantics and Forms This section discusses Remote Perfective Aspect -maa (glossed as REM.PFV;
referred to as REMPFV hereafter in this chapter). In Iquito, GNRPFV and MMTPFV do not incorporate adverbial components while REMPFV encodes an adverbial component. When used in past contexts (i.e. sentences in realis word order), it specifically indicates a perfective situation realized in the morning, including before sunrise. When used in future contexts (i.e. sentences in irrealis word order), it indicates a situation in the remote future. Therefore, when REMPFV is used in a sentence with Extended Current Tense, the RT of which spans from the day of SpT to the infinite future, such a sentence receives possible temporal references of either earlier in the day, including before sunrise or in the morning, or further in the future within approximately two years from SpT. The specific interpretation depends on the use of grammatical mood, realized by word order change (i.e. realis word order (SVX) in past situations and irrealis word order (SXV) in future situations) and vowel-hiatus resolution.
Regarding its adverbial components ‘in the morning’ and ‘in the remote future,’ the comparative data121 from other Zaparoan languages suggest the historical origin of REMPFV from two distinct morphemes. With respect to the sense of ‘in the morning,’ Arabela exhibits a free adverb maa which means ‘begin’ (Rich, 1999: 187). It is plausible
121 I am very grateful to my colleague as well as my outside committee member Lev Michael for pointing out and sharing his knowledge with me.
327

to project a grammaticization trajectory which links a free adverb meaning ‘begin’ with a verbal affix meaning ‘in the morning’ (i.e. beginning of the day). With respect to the sense of ‘in the remote future,’ Záparo exhibits a verbal affix -ma (~-na) which means ‘future’ (Peeke, 1991:12). Synchronically, I argue that it has developed into a single perfective morpheme which incorporates the adverbial component of these two senses. The empirical ground includes the following points. First, the -maa used in the past context and the -maa used in the remote-future context are phonologically homophonous according to the analysis up-to-date. Second, REMPFV structurally patterns with the other six Iquito perfective morphemes. Perfective aspects are used in past situations, in future situations, and in imperative constructions. Perfective aspects are especially obligatorily present in future situations and in imperative constructions: the exceptions are 1) in potential/optative constructions, Imperfective Aspect is required and 2) in imminent-future situations, Imperfective Aspect can be used. Third, a morpheme can be portmanteau; an aspectual component is not in conflict with a temporal component analytically.
REMPFV is used in past contexts with realis word order (SVX) and in remotefuture contexts with irrealis word order (SXV). When used in imperatives, the addressee is expected to realize an event while on the move (§4.6.1). It is rarely used, although both grammatical and possible, in imperative constructions, with the exception of animaa ‘come!,’ since requesting a person to realize a task while on the move is in general uncommon. In past contexts, REMPFV appears with all situation types. It conveys a closed event for Accomplishments, Activities, Accomplishments, and Semelfactives and renders an inceptive reading for States. When in the context of the remote future, REMPFV appears with all events with irrealis word order and indicates that the situation
328

will take place in the remote future. This report discusses the use of REMPFVs in declarative sentences in detail and briefly includes its imperative use.
REMPFV is marked as -maa in all clauses and does not have other allomorphs.

5.4.2 Past Context: Situation Types and Type of Perfective Closure In sentences in the Extended Current Tense, REMPFV indicates a perfective
situation at a long temporal distance away from SpT. Past situations (i.e. earlier in the morning, including before sunrise) are expressed by realis word order (SVX) and future situations (i.e. the remote future) are expressed by irrealis word order (SXV). Examples (636)-(650) in the following show that MMTPFV appears with all situation types.

As can be seen throughout the above examples, a temporal adverbial can be expressed in the sentence or not. If no explicit temporal adverbial appears in the sentence, the sentence receives a temporal interpretation of ‘in the morning.’ REMPFV can appear with the temporal adverbials (ácari) taaríqui ‘(this) morning,’ and cutataani-ácuji ‘before sunrise,’ but it cannot appear with nin++ni-+j+qu+ya ‘midnight’ or yahu++ni+j+qu+ya ‘noon,’ as in (651) and (652).

GNRPFV conveys a closed event without giving any temporal information. To specify a time reference, an explicit adverbial is needed, as in (653). In contrast, REMPFV does
333

not need an explicit adverbial, as above. REMPFV, in comparison with GNRPFV, therefore encodes an additional component of a temporal adverbial.

(653) Ácari taaríqui nu=capi-qui-Ø. now morning 3S=cook-GNR.PFV-EC This morning he cooked.

A sentence which contains a REMPFV morpheme cannot appear with GNRPFV again, as in (654) and (655). It is semantically redundant as well as structurally ungrammatical in terms of the morphological template of the verbal complex.

(654) *Ácari taaríqui nu=capi-qui-maa-Ø. now morning 3S=cook-GNR.PFV-REM.PFV-EC This morning he cooked.

(655) *Ácari taaríqui nu=capi-maa-qui-Ø. now morning 3S=cook-REM.PFV-GNR.PFV-EC This morning he cooked.

As REMPFV conveys a closed situation, it appears with the formative -quiaqu+ in the Distant Past Tense, as in (636), (639), (642), (645) and (648). It is ungrammatical if it appears with the formative -(y)aariqu+ which indicates Distant Past Tense with Imperfective Aspect, as in(656).

A sentence with REMPFV conveys a closed event and and is incompatible with the Imperfective Aspect. In the Recent Past Tense, it is also incompatible with the Imperfective Aspect, as in (657)and (658). This is also true in sentences in the Extended Current Tense, as in (659) and (660). Imperfective Aspect has to be used independently from the perfective aspect, as in (661).

With respect to the type of closure, REMPFV presents a sentence with the endpoint properties of its situation type schema for Activities, Achievements and Semelfactives. For States, it presents coerced initial endpoints. For Accomplishments, it presents closed situations with terminative endpoints. The completion of the event is in general implied; however the sentence is grammatical when followed by a sentence asserting an open situation, as in (662) and (663). This suggests that REMPFV conveys termination rather than completion.

REMPFV spans the entire event; therefore, it cannot be used to indicate an event that takes longer than the length of a morning, as in (664). The consultant Jaime comments that ‘you cannot build a house in one morning, but you can write a letter in one morning,’ as in (665). Compare the examples (662)-(665), (664) seems to be a counterexample to the idea that REMPFV conveys a terminative endpoint. However, there are two preferences that we can annotate to this. First, a short event is strongly preferred when using REMPFV and second, a completive endpoint is strongly suggested unless otherwise asserted. This is an interesting case for the study of perfectivity.

The consultant Jaime further suggests that if the verb p+ca ‘finish’ or an explicit adverbial is used, the sentence conveys a clear completive reading, as in (666) and (667), and cannot be followed by a sentence asserting an open situation, as in (668) and (669).

As a perfective aspect, REMPFV conveys a sequential reading in connected sentences, as in (670). The SitT of the event [he receive money] precedes that of [he buy a beer].

When he received money in the morning, he bought a beer in the morning.

In (671), the SitT of the event [he finish writing all the letters] precedes a certain RT, in this case, the time of the event [I arrive]. The adverbial jaa ‘already’ reverses the temporal sequential order of the events in the sentence.

5.4.3 Remote-Future Context and Imperatives
5.4.3.1 Remote-Future Context In addition to past contexts, REMPFV also appears in future contexts with irrealis
word order (SXV). Examples (674)-(677) in the following show that MMTPFV appears with all events. REMPFV also does not appear with Statives in future contexts.

other year-LOC 3S=morning cook-REM.PFV-EC The other year, he will cook in the morning.
(677) Semelfactive Taana yahu++ni-jina nu=isiin++-maa-Ø. other day-LOC 3S=cough-REM.PFV-EC He will cough some day.
When used in an irrealis clause, REMPFV, without any explicit temporal adverbial, as in (674), indicates an event which will be realized in the distant future. It does not render the interpretation of ‘in the morning,’ as in (674) and (677). To convey a temporal reference of ‘morning,’ an explicit temporal adverbial is required in the sentences, as in (675) and (676). It is noted that it can only refer to situations in the distant future; therefore, it cannot appear with a temporal adverbial such as amicaáca ‘one day away,’ as in (678). A clause indicating a near future situation contains MMTPFV, as in (679).
(678) *Amicaáca nu=taaríqui inica-maa-Ø. one.day.away 3S=morning wake.up-REM.PFV-EC Tomorrow he will wake up in the morning.
(679) Amicaáca nu=taaríqui capi-r++-Ø. one.day.away 3S=morning cook-MMT.PFV-EC Tomorrow he will cook in the morning.
341

To indicate a distant future without certainty, Imperfective Aspect -(y)aa~ -: is used in place, structurally, of the aspect followed by the potential/optative mood marker -cuma, as in (680). The indicated situation might or might not take place after all.

(680) Quia=taaríqui inica-aa-cuma. 2S=morning wake.up-IPFV-POT You might wake up in the morning some day.

In (681), it can be seen that the verb capi- ‘cook’ appears with Imperfective Aspect plus the potential/optative -cuma while the verb cuqui- ‘become’ appears with REMPFV. The event [he cook] might or might not take place in the distant future while the event [he become adolescent] will definitely take place in the distant future.

(681) Nu=capi-aa-cuma j++ticari nu=maana cuqui-maa-Ø. 3S=cook-IPFV-OPT when 3S=adolescent become-REM.PFV-EC He might cook some day when he grows up.

One point worthy of note is that the consultant Jaime prefers not to use REMPFV with the Semelfactives directly, as in (647). Instead, he prefers the following sentence, as in (682). The scenario of the following sentence is as follows. A person who has not begun to cough went to see the doctor. The doctor told him that three years later, he would start coughing.

quia=apara-maa-Ø

isin++ni=jina.

2S=start-REM.PFV-EC cough.INF=LOC

Three years later, you will start to cough.

5.4.3.2 Imperatives In addition to declaratives, REMPFV is also used in imperatives (§4.6.1),
although extremely rarely due to pragmatic constraints. When used in imperatives, the addressee is expected to realize a task in movement for a distance, which is in general uncommon in the real world. In Iquito, the only common expression of REMPFV in the imperative is as in (683). Since one has to move in order to realize the event of ‘come,’ it is not pragmatically weird in the daily use of imperatives in Iquito. For a detailed discussion on imperative constructions, please refer to §4.6.1.
The imperative use of -maa could be developed either from ‘begin’ or ‘remote/distance’ sense of REMPFV since the addressee is expected to begin realizing the event for a distance while in movement as soon as he hears the imperative sentence. It is noticed that, in Iquito, there is a directional morpheme -ma which has the senses ‘towards, inside, down,’ depending on context in which it appears. It is also noted that there are cognate morphemes of this directional morpheme found in Andoa (Rich, 1999: 75-6), meaning ‘towards, in’ and appearing both with verbs and nouns. However, I doubt that -maa in imperative constructions is developed from the directional morpheme -ma for several reasons. First, phonologically these two morphemes have different vowel length: short vowel is devoiced and hard to hear at the end of the sentence while long vowel is clearly heard at the sentence-final position. Second, the imperative use of -maa can be developed from regular senses of REMPFV. Third, all Iquito imperatives require
343

the presence of a perfective aspect. Even if it is the directional -ma here, a perfective aspect which will be yet another morpheme in this case will still be required. Fourth, in Andoa directional morphemes attach to both verbs and nouns while in Iquito directional morphemes can only attach to nouns; analyzing the imperative use of -maa here as the directional one would make this use the only exception that they attach to verbs. Fifth and the last, there is another directional morpheme -cu in Iquito, which cannot be used in imperatives either. However, given the complicated origin of REMPFV -maa, I think it is worth noting the relevant observations and the comparative facts here.

5.4.4 Summary In this section, I discussed the use and the meaning of REMPFV in Iquito.
REMPFV is used in past contexts with realis word order (SVX), in remote-future situations with irrealis word order (SXV), and in imperative constructions. This section discussed the first two uses in detail and introduced the use of REMPFV in imperatives. In past contexts, it conveys a closed event realized in the morning. It coerces an inceptive reading for Statives. In future contexts, it indicates an event to be realized in the remote future.
344

5.5 DEICTIC PERFECTIVE ASPECTS
5.5.1 General Characterization of Semantics and Forms This section discusses Deictic Perfective Aspects (glossed as DEI1.PFV and
DEI2.PFV; referred to as DEIPFVs hereafter in this chapter) in Iquito. In Iquito, GNRPFV, MMTPFV, and REMPFV are non-deictic perfective aspects while the perfective aspects -hu++ and -cuaa are deictic. DEIPFVs are used in past contexts with realis123 word order (SVX), in immediate and near-future contexts with irrealis word order (SXV), and in imperative constructions of all events and stage-level Statives (i.e. indicating transitory states, such as estar in Spanish). They cannot appear with individual-level Statives (i.e. indicating permanent states, such as ser in Spanish). One point worthy of note is that verbs which have directional components, such as iicua- ‘go’ and sihuaan+- ‘arrive,’ cannot combine with DEIPFVs. This section discusses their use in declarative sentences in detail and summarizes their imperative use. In past contexts, DEIPFVs appear with all situation types and convey, in terms of the aspectual property, a closed situation plus the discontinuous post-stage in terms of change of location at SpT. With respect to the deictic property, two systems of deixis are represented by DEIPFVs: one is the speaker-centered river-oriented deixis and the other is the speaker-centered radial deixis. The formative -hu++ is used to indicate upriver orientation or the area in the proximity of the speaker while the formative -cuaa is used to indicate downriver orientation or the direction away from the speaker. The switch of deictic reference depends on the explicit use of deictic adverbials. DEIPFVs also appear with all situation types in future contexts, with irrealis word order, to indicate that the situation will take place in the future and that the subject of the sentence has not reached the specified location at SpT.
123 For a detailed discussion on grammatical mood, please refer to §4.
345

DEIPFVs are marked as -hu++ and -cuaa in all realis clauses and do not have allomorphs in these clauses. The formative -cuhu++ surfaces in irrealis clauses as the allomorph of -hu++; the formative -cuaa remains the same in irrealis clauses.
5.5.2 Past Context 5.5.2.1 Deictic Property
Two deixis systems are represented by DEIPFVs: one is speaker-centered riveroriented deixis and the other is speaker-centered radial deixis. The formative -hu++ is used to indicate the proximity of the speaker, in terms of radial deixis, or the upriver orientation, in terms of river-oriented deixis. The formative -cuaa is used to indicate the non-proximity of the speaker, in terms of radial deixis, or the downriver orientation, in terms of river-oriented deixis. Without an explicit deictic adverbial, the sentence can be interpreted in terms of either river-oriented deixis or radial deixis. However, if an explicit deictic adverbial is specified, it clarifies the reference.
Speaker-centered river-oriented deixis Within the river-oriented deitic system, the formative -hu++ is used for situations
with an upriver orientation from the speaker-centered deictic center and the formative -cuaa is used for situations with a downriver orientation from the deictic center.
In example (684), if the deictic adverbial cáami ‘upriver’ is not used, the sentence can be interpreted as ‘he slept here,’ with respect to radial deixis, or ‘he slept upriver,’ with respect to river-oriented deixis. However, when the upriver-related deictic expressions, such as cáami ‘upriver’ (684) or -cu ‘postposition: upriver’ (685), are used in the sentence, then an interpretation in terms of river-oriented deixis is specified.
346

Likewise, when a deictic adverbial, such as iíti ‘here,’ appears in the sentence, it has to be interpreted in terms of radial deixis. The formative -hu++, instead of the formative -cuaa, pairs with upriver-related deictic adverbials. The location expressed by the deictic adverbial cáami ‘upriver’ can indicate another village which is upriver to the community of San Antonio de Pintuyacu where the sentence is produced. Within the scope of the community, it can indicate the area which is upriver to the area where the sentence is produced.

Example (686) receives an interpretation of a closed state in which the verb iiqui- ‘live’ functions as a stage-level Stative to indicate the location of the subject. It can be seen that when the deictic adverbial cáami ‘upriver’ is used, it pairs with DEIPFV -hu++. Example (687) shows that the combination of -hu++ with naami ‘downriver’ is ungrammatical.

Example (688), which is composed of an Accomplishment constellation, indicates that the speaker who produced the sentence went to his chacra upriver to harvest his yuca earlier on the same day which includes SpT. The speaker has returned from his chacra upriver where he harvested the yuca.

Example (690) shows that the deictic adverbial cáami ‘upriver’ is optionally used when the postposition -cu is already used to indicate that the location of the noun is relatively upriver in comparison with the location where the sentence is uttered.

The consultant Hermico commented that the following sentence could be said in Taiwan after I go back there for a few years because the sentence is in Distant Past Tense. He explained that in order to go to Taiwan, one needs to go downriver first to the city of Iquitos and then fly to other destinations. Therefore, San Antonio is relatively upriver to Taiwan from this perspective. Jaime, however, commented that this sentence can be used only if I am in the city of Iquito.

In (693), if the deictic adverbial tíira ‘there’ is not used, the sentence is still generally interpreted as ‘he slept there,’ with respect to radial deixis, but can also be interpreted as ‘he slept downriver’ with respect to river-oriented deixis. However, when downriverrelated deictic adverbials appear in the sentence, the sentence needs to be interpreted in terms of river-oriented deixis. The formative -cuaa, instead of the formative -hu++, pairs with downriver-related deictic adverbials. Sentence (693) is a radial-deictic one because of the adverbial tíira ‘there.’ The location expressed by (693), according to Ema and Jaime, can be any place, within approximately 200 meters in distance, away from the speaker-centered deictic center.

Like (686), example (694) receives an interpretation of a closed state in which the verb iiqui- ‘live’ is a stage-level Stative and indicates the location of the subject. It can be seen that when the deictic adverbial naami ‘downriver’ is used, it pairs with DEIPFV -cuaa.

He was in his chacra upriver (and is no longer there).

Example (697) shows that the deictic postposition -ma ‘downriver’ should be used instead to pair with DEIPFV -cuaa. The sentence indicates that the speaker who produced the sentence went to his chacra downriver to harvest his yuca earlier on the same day which includes SpT. The speaker has returned from his chacra downriver where he harvested the yuca.

If the speaker is going to his chacra, the following sentence which contains Imperfective Aspect is uttered.

1S-chacra-DEI.downriver 1S=go-IPFV-EC yuca harvest.INF-in.order.to I am going to my chacra downriver to harvest the yuca.
Example (699) shows that the deictic adverbial naami ‘downriver’ is optionally used when the postposition -ma is already used to indicate that the location of the noun is relatively downriver in comparison with the location where the sentence is uttered.
(699) Qui=samarata-cuaa-cura (naami) qui-iíta-ma. 1S=rest-DEI2.PFV-RPST downriver 1S-house-DEI.downriver I rested in my house downriver.
Speaker-centered radial deixis Within the radial deixis system, the formative -hu++ is used for situations in the
proximity of the deictic center and -cuaa is used for situations away from the deictic center. The deictic adverbials, cáami ‘upriver’ and naami ‘downriver,’ and the deictic postpositions, -cu ‘DEI.upriver’ and -ma ‘DEI.downriver,’ are not used in radial deictic sentences. Instead, adverbials of radial orientation, such as iíti ‘here’ and tíira ‘there’ are used.
In (700), if the deictic adverbial iíti ‘here’ is not used, the sentence can be interpreted in terms of radial deixis or in terms of river-oriented deixis. Here, the sentence is interpreted with respect to radial deixis because the deictic adverbial iíti ‘here’ is used. The formative -hu++, instead of the formative -cuaa, pairs with it.
(700) Nu=maqu+-hu++-Ø iíti. 3S=sleep-DEI1.PFV-EC here 352

He slept here (and is no longer here).

Example (701) shows that the combination of -cuaa and the deictic adverbial iíti ‘here’ is ungrammatical.

(701) *Iíti nu=maqu+-cuaa-Ø. here 3S=sleep-DEI2.PFV-EC He slept here.

When the first grammatical person appears to be the subject of the sentence in which DEIPFV -hu++ and the deictic adverbial iíti ‘here’ are used, the sentence is interpreted with a discontinuous period in terms of the subject’s location. The consultant Jaime gave a scenario for the following example. At first, he was in a meeting and then he went home to eat. After eating, he went back to the meeting. When he returned home again, his family arrived and invited him to eat. He can use this sentence to respond.

(702) Jaa cu=asa-hu++-Ø

iíti.

already1S=eat-DEI1.PFV-EC here

I already ate here.

If the subject stayed in the house after eating until SpT, then the following sentence is used.

(703) Cu=ani-qui-Ø

iíti asaani-anuura.

1S=eat-GNR.PFV-EC here eat-in.order.to

353

I came here to eat.

Within radial deixis, the formative -hu++ is used for situations in the proximity of the speaker-centered deictic center and the formative -cuaa is used for situations away from the deictic center. In (704), the deictic postposition -cuura indicates a distance within approximately 200 meters from the radial deictic center. The formative -cuaa, instead of the formative -hu++, pairs with the deictic postposition -cuura.

If the chacra is within a short distance towards the upriver direction, the consultant Hermico can use the deictic postposition -cuura together with DEIPFV -hu++ to indicate that he was there, as in (705). For the speaker JPI, (705) is ungrammatical and (706) is uttered instead.

5.5.2.2 Aspectual Property DEIPFVs -hu++ and -cuaa convey a closed situation plus a discontinuous post-
stage in terms of change of location in SpT. Examples (707)-(716) show that DEIPFVs appear with all situation types.

In the following I provide examples, in order, of -hu++ with an upriver meaning in riveroriented deixis, -cuaa with a downriver meaning in river-oriented deixis, -hu++ with near-the-deictic-center meaning in radial deixis -cuaa with away-from-the-deictic-center meaning in radial deixis. Example (715) shows that DEIPFV -hu++ conveys a closed state. The sentences in (717) are grammatical individually, but the combination of these two sentences is semantically ill-formed, which is indicated by a pound sign (#). If a sentence containing -hu++ does not convey a closed state, it should be possible to coordinate it with a sentence which asserts an open situation. DEIPFV -hu++, therefore, conveys a closed situation.

(717) #Nu=iiqui-hu++-Ø cáami. Nu=iiqui-i-Ø cáami atií=yaajaa. 3S=live-DEI1.PFV-EC uprvier 3S=live-IPFV-EC upriver at.the.moment=NWR I was upriver and am still upriver.

In addition to conveying a closed situation, DEIPFV -hu++ also includes a discontinuous stage in terms of change of location at SpT. As can be seen in the following, a sentence containing -hu++ cannot be coordinated with a sentence which asserts the continuous presence of the subject in terms of the same location.

To express that the person is still upriver, the general Motion verb ihuaani ‘go’ with the non-discontinuous GNRPFV is used, as in (719) and (720).

The same discontinuous property applies to the perfective -cuaa of its downriver meaning in river-oriented deixis, as in (721).

(721) #Nu=iiqui-cuaa-Ø

naami. Nu=iiqui-i

naami atií=yaajaa. downriver at.the.moment=NWR He was downriver and is still downriver.

To express that the person is still downriver, the general Motion verb ihuaani ‘go’ with the non-discontinuous GNRPFV is used, as in (722).

m+y+qu++ni im+raani.

3S=go-GNR.PFV-EC downriverNEG 3S=learn-IPFV-ECreturn.INF again

He went downriver and cannot return again.

The same aspectual property applies to -hu++ of near-the-deictic-center meaning in radial deixis and -cuaa in away-from-the-deictic-center meaning in radial deixis. As can be seen in (723), the combination of the two grammatical sentences is semantically illformed.

(723) #Nu=maqu+-hu++-Ø iíti. Iíti nu=maqui-i-Ø

atií=yaajaa.

3S=sleep-DEI1.PFV-EC here here 3S=sleep-IPFV-EC at.the.moment=NWR

He slept here and is still here.

The consultants commented that the example above would be better if the word im+raani ‘again’ were used because it would indicate a change of location and the discontinuous stage of the situation between the two sentences. To indicate a continuous situation of coming and staying to sleep, the following example is uttered instead.
359

He came to sleep here and and he is still sleeping (here).

In (725), the combination of the two grammatical sentences is semantically ill-formed, indicating that DEIPFV -cuaa conveys a closed situation and a discontinuous stage.

To indicate that the subject of the sentence is still there in his chacra, the following example is used.

NEG=3S=come-IPFV-EC at.the.moment=NWR He harvested the yuca in his chacra there and he still hasn’t arrived yet.

One point worthy of note is that DEIPFVs cannot appear with verbs which encode directional meanings, such as iicua- ‘go’ and sihuaan+- ‘arrive.’ In (727) and (728), iicua- ‘go’ plus cáami ‘upriver’ or naami ‘downriver’ is an event with a directional meaning; DEIPFVs cannot appear in such sentences. GNRPFV is used instead, as in (729).

(727) *Nu=iicua-hu++-Ø cáami. 3S=go-DEI1.PFV-EC upriver He went upriver.

(728) *Nu=iicua-cuaa-Ø naami. 3S=go-DEI1.PFV-EC downriver He went downriver.

(729) Nu=iicua-qui-Ø

cáami.

3S=go-GNR.PFV-EC upriver

He went upriver.

Another example is with the verb sihuaan+- ‘arrive’ which is an Achievement verb with a directional meaning in Iquito. DEIPFV cannot appear with it, as is seen in (730). MMTPFV is used instead, as in (731). Jaime commented that (730) is fine, but it means that the person only arrived at the port, and came downriver immediately.

5.5.3 Future Context and Imperatives DEIPFVs are used in past contexts as well as in immediate, near, and remote
future contexts. In addition, they are also used in the imperative constructions of all events. In this section, I discuss the uses in the future and briefly discuss those in imperative constructions.

5.5.3.1 Future Context The formative -hu++ has an allomorph -cuhu++ in irrealis clauses while the
formative -cuaa remains -cuaa. In irrealis clauses, both -cuhu++ and -cuaa attach to the derivational verbal root in some cases, as if they were derivational morphemes. This is observed from the stem-changing verbs (i.e. compare (738) with (748)). DEIPFVs -cuhu++ and -cuaa, with irrealis word order (SXV), are used to indicate situations in the immediate, recent, and remote future, which ranges from later in the same day of SpT, to within a few days, to up to a few months. The exact temporal location is indicated by an explicit temporal reference.
362

Examples (732)-(743) in the following show that DEIPFVs appear with all situation types in irrealis clauses. It can be seen that the sentences display the SXV pattern for transitive verbs, as in (732)-(737). For intransitive verbs, as in (738)-(743), adverbs can cliticize onto the subject, displaying an SXV pattern as well. Adverbs can also appear in sentence-initial position, in which case the subject does not phonologically fuse with the verbal complex and the long form of the pronoun is used, as in (738) and (740)-(742). For a detailed discussion on irrealis mood, please refer to §4.

He will be downriver. On the same day he will return from downriver.

In (732), the object of the sentence is a definite phrase. It can be seen that the determiner of the object phrase cliticizes onto the subject noun. In irrealis clauses, as in (732), the allomorph -cuhu++ is used while in realis clauses, as in (744), the allomorph -hu++ is used. It is ungrammatical for -hu++ to appear in irrealis clauses, as in (746). The formative -cuaa does not have an allomorphic counterpart in irrealis clauses, as is illustrated in (734) as well as (745).

one.day.away 3S=DETwrite-DEI1.PFV-EC letter

Tomorrow he will write the letter (here or upriver).

In (737), the object of the sentence is a pronoun. It can be seen that the pronominal object cliticizes onto the subject noun in the irrealis clause. In realis sentences, the pronoun object stays in the post-verbal position, as in (747).

366

(747) Amicaáca nu=namit++-hu++-cura nuu. one.day.away 3S=begin-DEI1.PFV 3S Yesterday he started it (here or upriver).

Examples (738)-(743) are intransitive clauses. It can be seen that adverbs can cliticize onto the subject, displaying an SXV pattern, as in (739), (742) and (743). Adverbs can also appear in sentence-initial position. If there is no adverb in the clause, the subject does not fuse to the verbal complex, as in (738) and (740)-(741). One point worthy of note is that sentences (738) and (739) contain the stem-changing verb muuta- ‘dig,’ whose derivational stem is muura- and inflectional stem is muuta-. From the comparison of (738) and (739) with (748) and (749), we can see this alternation.

5.5.3.2 Imperatives In addition to declarative constructions, DEIPFVs are also used in the imperatives
of all events. Speakers use this construction to order a person to move to a certain location and realize the indicated task. In imperatives, the allomorph -hu++, instead of
367

-cuhu++, is generally used. The verbs carii- ‘look’ and niqui- ‘see’ are exceptions in that they can take both allomorphs with an additional emphatic meaning when combined with the allomorph -cuhu++. One point worthy of note is that the inflectional stem of the verb is used instead of a derivational stem.
The formative -hu++ is used to order a person to move towards the speaker or upriver, then to realize an event in the proximity of the speaker or in some place with an upriver orientation. An explicit adverbial is usually provided to specify the location where the action is to be realized, as in (750) and (751). If no explicit adverbial is provided, the sentence is interpreted in terms of radial deixis. Sentence (750) is used to order a person who is at a distance from the speaker to move towards the speaker and stand. Sentence (751) is used to order a person, regardless of his current location relative to the speaker, to move towards somewhere upriver and sing.

(750) Tacu-hu++

iíti!

stand-DEI1.PFV here

Come stand here!

(751) Ariicua-hu++ cáami! sing-DEI1.PFV upriver Go sing upriver!

It is noted that the allomorph -hu++ is generally used. An imperative sentence which contains -cuhu++ is generally ungrammatical. Sentences (752)-(753) do not have an explicit adverbial. Therefore, the sentences are interpreted with respect to radial deixis. It can be seen that (754) is ungrammatical because the allomorph -cuhu++ is used.
368

(752) Najuu-hu++ iina carta! write-DEI1.PFV DET letter Come write the letter (here)!
(753) Namit++-hu++ tarahuajuuni! start-DEI1.PFV work.INF Come start to work (here)!
(754) *Najuu-cuhu++ iina carta! write-DEI1.PFV DET letter Come write the letter (here)!
In (755), it is seen that the verb iicua- ‘go’ which has a directional component is incompatible with DEIPFV -hu++; instead the verb iiqui- ‘live or stage-level be’ has to be used, as in (756).
(755) *Iicua-hu++ cáami! go-DEI1.PFV upriver Go upriver!
(756) Iiqui-hu++ cáami! live-DEI1.PFV upriver Go upriver! (Literally: Be upriver!)
369

The formative -cuaa is used to order a person to realize an event at a distance from the speaker, in terms of radial deixis, or in some place with downriver orientation, in terms of river-oriented deixis. An explicit adverbial is usually provided to specify the location where the action is to be realized, as in (757) and (758). If no explicit adverbial is provided, the sentence is interpreted in terms of radial deixis. Sentence (757) is used to order a person who is in the proximity of the speaker to move away from the speaker and stand. Sentence (758) is used to order a person, regardless of his current location relative to the speaker, to go somewhere downriver and sing.

Go stand there! (E.120806.ELY.IWL)

(758) Ariicua-cuaa naami! sing-DEI1.PFV downriver Go sing downriver!

The two verbs, carii- ‘look’ and niqui- ‘see, find, locate,’ are exceptions because of their compatibility with the allomorph -cuhu++ as well as -hu++. When a speaker orders a person to come towards him to see something, the allomorph -hu++ is used, as in (759). However, when (760) is used, it is because the person being requested to perform the action does not believe the speaker. Sentence (760), therefore, conveys an additional emphatic meaning which presupposes that the listener does not believe the speaker.

(760) Ani-maa!

Carii-cuhu++ iina!

come-REM.PFV look-DEI1.PFV DET

Come look at this yourself! (I am not lying.)

5.5.4 Summary In this section, I discussed the use and the meaning of DEIPFVs in Iquito.
DEIPFVs are used in past contexts with realis word order (SVX) following inflectional verbal stem, in future situations with irrealis word order (SXV) following a verbal root, and in the imperative constructions of all events and stage-level Statives. The formative -hu++ has an allomorph -cuhu++ in irrealis clauses while the formative -cuaa remains the same in both realis and irrealis clauses. This section discusses the use of DEIPFVs in
371

declarative sentences in detail and summarizes the imperative use. In the past context, DEIPFVs appear with all situation types and convey a closed situation plus the discontinuous post-stage in terms of change of location at the SpT. The consultant Jaime commented that when DEIPFVs are used, it is understood that ‘one went to a specific location only to realize a certain task’ and that ‘one stayed there for a relatively short time.’ With respect to deictic properties, two systems of deixis are represented by DEIPFVs: one is the speaker-centered river-oriented deixis and the other is the speakercentered radial deixis. The formative -hu++ is used to indicate upriver orientation or the area in the proximity of the speaker while the formative -cuaa is used to indicate downriver orientation or the direction away from the speaker. The switch of deitic reference depends on the explicit use of deictic adverbials or postpositions. It is noted that verbs with directional components, such as iicua- ‘go’ and sihuaan+- ‘arrive’ cannot combine with DEIPFVs.
5.6 ALLATIVE AND ABLATIVE PERFECTIVE ASPECTS
5.6.1 General Characterization of Semantics and Forms This section discusses Allative Perfective Aspect and Ablative Perfective Aspect
(glossed as ALL.PFV and ABL.PFV respectively; referred to as ALLPFV and ABLPFV hereafter in this chapter) in Iquito. In Iquito, GNRPFV, MMTPFV, REMPFV, and DEIPFVs do not incorporate any directional meaning while ALLPFV -sahu++ and ABLPFV -(y)aar++ contain a directional component.
ALLPFV spans a closed event (i.e. events and derived Achievements from Statives) with a preliminary stage indicating the agent’s motion from some unspecified place to the location of the referred event. The agent realized or will realize the event
372

upon arrival. ABLPFV spans a closed event (i.e. events and derived Achievements from Statives) with a following stage indicating the agent’s departure from the location of the referred event to some unspecified place. The agent departed or will depart the location of the event referred to upon its realization. The following diagrams summarize the information in this paragraph. The slashes represent what the aspects encode and the brackets indicate the initial (I) and final (F) endpoints of the events. I-1 indicates preliminary stage and F+1 indicates subsequent stage.
Diagram 9. Allative Perfective Aspect -sahu++ Realization of the event upon arrival at a location
I-1 I F /////////[////////]
Diagram 10. Ablative Perfective Aspect -(y)aar++ Departure from a location upon realization of the event
I F F+1 [////////]////////
ALLPFV and ABLPFVs are marked as -sahu++ and -(y)aar++ in all clauses and do not have other allomorphs.
373

5.6.2 Allative Perfective Aspect This section discusses the uses of ALLPFV -sahu++ in comparison with DEIPFV
-hu++ because of the similarity in their formal identity. The formatives -hu++ and -sahu++ both present a closed event. However, -sahu++ includes a preliminary stage in terms of the agent’s movement towards the location where the event is realized; -hu++ includes a discontinuous post-stage in terms of change of location. In the text, this can be seen by the explicit mention of movement of the subject or by a previously set-up scene. The interpretations by the speakers always include a long stretch of time before the situation expressed by the verbal constellation actually takes place. In future and imperative constructions, -sahu++ also indicates the realization of the event upon arrival at a certain location.
Jaime gave a scenario for the following example. You and other people headed home together from the forest. You arrived first. And because you could not bear the hunger any longer, you ate first upon arrival. When other people arrived and asked you to eat, you use this sentence to respond, as in (763).

(763) Jaa cu=asa-sahu++-Ø jaa. already 1S=eat-ALL.PFV-EC already I already came first to eat. (Jaime) I already ate upon arrival. (Hermico)

ALLPFV -sahu++ presents a closed event; therefore, the sentence containing it cannot combine with another sentence that asserts an open situation, as in (764).

(764) #Jaa

cu=asa-sahu++-Ø.

Cu=asa-a-Ø 374

atií=yaajaa.

already 1S=eat-ALL.PFV-EC 1S=eat-IPFV-EC at.the.moment=NWR I already ate upon arrival and I am still eating.

In order to express that you are still eating, (765) or (766) is used.

(765) Jaa cu=asa-a-Ø. already 1S=eat-IPFV-EC I have been eating. (Literally: I am already eating.)

(766) Jaa cu=ani-qui-Ø

cu=asa-a-Ø=quiyaajaa.

at.the.moment 1S=eat-IPFV-EC=NWR

I already came here in order to eat. At this moment, I am still eating.

Hermico gave the interpretation for (767) that the subject came from a distance to see the object, ‘finding’ (i.e. seeing upon arrival) the object sitting there already. This interpretation made the initial point of niquiini ‘see’ visible.

(767) Na=niqui-sahu++-quiaqu+ quiija ajitiaana. 3P=see-ALL.PFV-DPST.NIP 1S seated Upon arrival, they saw me seated.

375

Other examples in Distant Past Tense also reveal the motion of the subject before the situation -sahu++ attaches to takes place. The situation takes place as soon as the subject arrives at a certain location. The sequentiality of events is clearly indicated, as in (768).

(768) Qui=sihuaan+-r++-quiaqu+

tii.

Cu=asa-sahu++-quiaqu+ paapaaja.

1S=arrive-MMT.PFV-DPST.NIP that.place 1S=eat-ALL.PFV-DPST.NIP fish

I arrived at that place. I ate fish upon arrival (it was already prepared).

In contrast, the following example with -hu++ does not have any information concerning the arrival of the subject and how the ‘eating’ takes place.

(769) Cu=asa-hu++-quiaqu+

paapaaja.

1S=eat-DEI1.PFV-DPST.NIP fish

I ate fish (here or upriver a long time ago).

The following examples from the text explicitly mention the motion of the subject and imply that sachavaca was already coming.

(770) Nu=jata nu=iicua-Ø-Ø=quiyaajaa, nu-cajija=jata, tíira aasamu 3S=COM 3S=go-GNR.PFV-EC=NWR 3S-ax=COM there creek

With this, he just went with his ax to there, to the shore of the creek. Upon arrival,

he sat on Sachavaca’s track. (T.PSV.2003.HDC: 148-150)

376

The following example shows that the subject’s movement was explicitly explained. In the previous context, it was also mentioned that the sachavaca was floating in the well the people were heading for.

(771) Jaari nuu-huaar+ta cayaaca, titar++-Ø-Ø

ALLPFV appears with all events. For Statives, it presents the movement of the subject towards a location and focuses on the initial endpoints of the Statives. It is compatible with a sentence asserting an open situation.

3S=know-ALL.PFV-EC all

DET.PL person-PL

He arrived at San Antonio. Almost at the same moment, he got acquainted with

For Activities, ALLPFV conveys the arbitrary endpoint and that the event is not in process. In (776), the subject ran (a few rounds or however long) upon arrival, but is not in the middle of running at SpT.

(776) ACTIVITIES 378

Nu=n+t+-sahu++-Ø. 3S=run-ALL.PFV-EC He ran upon arrival.

To express that the subject is still running, (777) has to be used.

(777) Nu=sihuaan+-r++-Ø. Nu=n+ti-i-Ø. 3S=arrive-MMT.PFV-EC 3S=run-IPFV-EC He arrived and he is running now.

The following connected sentences further confirm that ALLPFV -sahu++ conveys a closed event.

(778) Jaa nu=asa-sahu++-Ø. Jaa nu=asa-qui-Ø

jaa.

already 3S=eat-ALL.PFV-EC already 3S=eat-GNR.PFV-EC already

He already ate upon arrival. He indeed already ate.

The following sentence shows that momentary adverbials are not compatible with Activities in sentences containing -sahu++.

(779) *Tiijicuaji nu=asa-sahu++-Ø. suddenly 3S=eat-ALL.PFV-EC Suddenly he ate upon arrival.

Achievement verbs, instead, are compatible with momentary adverbials, as in (780). 379

(780) Tiijicuaji nu=sihuaan+-r++-Ø. Nu=apara-qui-Ø

asaani=jina.

suddenly 3S=arrive-MMT.PFV-EC 3S=begin-GNR.PFV-EC eat.INF=LOC

All of a sudden, he arrived. He started to eat.

ALLPFV conveys the natural final endpoints of Accomplishments. It can be seen from the examples below that for an event that takes more than one day to finish, such as ‘build a house,’ -sahu++ can be used with Recent Past Tense (781), but not with Extended Current Tense (782), because pragmatically it is not possible that a group of people could arrive at a certain location, start to build a house, and finish building it by SpT.

(781) ACCOMPLISHMENTS

(782) #Na=mii-sahu++-Ø núquiica iíta. 3P=do-ALL.PFV-EC one house They built a house upon arrival.

380

For a short Accomplishment event, ALLPFV can appear in sentences in the Extended Current Tense with -sahu++, as in (783).

(783) Jaa

nu=najuu-sahu++-Ø iina simiím+.

Already 3S=write-ALL.PFV-EC DET letter

He already wrote the letter upon arrival.

For Achievements, ALLPFV spans the single-stage event with a preliminary stage, as in (784) and (785).

(784) ACHIEVEMENTS Jaa na=p+ca-sahu++-Ø iina miini iíta. already 3P=finish-ALL.PFV-EC DET do.INF house

they

ALLPFV cannot combine with some Achievements because they are semantically incompatible, as in (786). One cannot arrive somewhere upon arrival.

381

(786) #Nu=sihuaan+-sahu++-Ø. 3S=arrive-ALL.PFV-EC He arrived upon arrival.

ALLPFV also spans single-stage Semelfactives and presents intrinsically bounded events.

(787) SEMELFACTIVES Nu=isiin++-sahu++-Ø. 3S=cough-ALL.PFV-EC He coughed upon arrival.

(788) Nu=asíjuu-sahu++-Ø. Atií

5.6.3 Ablative Perfective Aspect This section discusses the uses of ABLPFV -(y)aar++. ABLPFV -(y)aar++
conveys a closed event (i.e. Accomplishments, Achievements, non-motion Activities, Semelfactives, and derived Achievements from Statives) with a post-stage indicating the motion of going away from the location of the event. For Motion verbs, it indicates the onset of the motion with a direction away from a location. It can be used in past contexts and immediate and near-future contexts, but not remote-future contexts. In addition, it can also be used in imperatives.
As in (789), for Accomplishments, ABLPFV indicates that the subject realized an event and left the premises (addressed as ablative reading in this section; the consultants
382

often address this reading as ‘para su despedida’ ‘for his farewell’). The ablative reading obtains in both past (789) and future contexts (790). Note that ABLPFV cannot be used in the remote future. As in (790), REMPFV -maa is used.

For most Motion verbs, an inceptive reading in addition to the ablative reading is also obtained, as in (800)-(803). Sentence (800) means that ‘the subject ran away from a location.’ The speaker sees the beginning of ‘running’ and uses the following sentence. Whether the subject is still running or not is not encoded.
(800) Motion Jaa nu=n+ti-aar++-Ø. already 3S=run-ABL.PFV-EC He already ran away. 385

For Statives, ABLPFV conveys a derived Achievement (i.e. an inceptive reading that focuses on the initial endpoints of a new state) and the motion of going away from the location. Note that (811), which contains ABLPFV, conveys the equivalent meaning of (810) in terms of the event of ‘getting to know’ and ‘leaving afterwards.’

However, it is noted that ABLPFV is incompatible with the existential iiqui-. To express the idea that he was at some place, but not at SpT, DEIPFV is used. See §5.5 for relevant discussion.

Interestingly, some verbs, such as maqu+- ‘sleep,’ convey an inceptive reading when combined with ABLPFV, patterning as a Stative124 verb in this case, although the ablative reading is not rendered, unlike with other Statives. The reason for this inceptive reading is probably because ‘sleeping’ usually lasts a relatively long period of time with not much control by the agent and not much variation within the entire process. To express that the subject slept at a certain location and is not there at SpT, DEIPFV is used.

The derived verb ma qu+t++- ‘make sleep, cause to sleep,’ however, has an ablative reading when combined with ABLPFV.

(819) Jaa qui=maqu+-t++-yaar++-Ø nuu. already 1S=sleep-CAU-ABL.PFV-EC 3S I already left after making him sleep.

124 Other linguistic correlates (i.e. imperatives, etc.) show that the verb maqu+- ‘sleep’ is an Activity verb. However, the inceptive reading triggered by ABLPFV suggests that the verb also exhibits properties of Stative verbs due to these language-specific correlates.
390

(820) Nu=maqu+-t++-yaar++-cura nuu. 3S=sleep-CAU-ABL.PRF-RPST 3S He made him sleep and then left.

Compare (817) with (821); the subject in (817) is asleep at SpT while that in (821), which contains GNRPFV in combination with the verb maqu+- ‘sleep,’ is awake.

In the following, I discuss the verb tiqui- ‘pass through’ (i.e. pass a certain landmark and keep going), also often glossed as ‘enter’ by the consultants, as an Achievement verb. It is noted that although this verb is commonly translated by the consultants as ‘entrar’ in local Spanish, its meaning is more accurately described as ‘reach a certain point.’ This verb is the most common one used in imperatives with ABLPFV, as in (823).

If the speaker passed through the door of a house and is coming inside, he can utter the following the sentence.

(825) Jaa qui=tiqui-aar++-Ø

iíti=iira

jaa.

already 1S=pass.through-ABL.PFV-EC here=GOAL already

I already entered here (I am still in the house).

125 This is a special imperative construction with the explicit mention of the addressee. The expression iicu-maa tíira ‘walk (until) there’ pairs with ani-maa iíti ‘come (until) here,’ but is not as common in daily imperative use.
392

If he reached to a certain point and stopped walking, and, after a while, somebody who cannot see him asks him where he is, the following sentence with GNRPFV is used, exhibiting a language-specific linguistic correlate of Achievements. See §6 for more discussion on situation types.

(826) Jaa qui=tiqui-qui-Ø

I already entered (second time responding).

5.6.4 Summary This section discussed ALLPFV and ABLPFV. ALLPFV spans a closed event
with a preliminary stage indicating the agent’s motion from some unspecified place to the location of the event referred to. ABLPFV spans a closed event with a following stage indicating the agent’s departure from the location of the event referred to some unspecified place. Both of them are uncommon with imperatives.

5.7 IMPERFECTIVE ASPECT
5.7.1 General Characterization of Semantics and Forms This section discusses Imperfective Aspect (glossed as IPFV; referred to as IPFV
hereafter in this chapter) in Iquito. IPFV does not occur with irrealis word order, except in counterfactual constructions in which an additional counterfactual morpheme, besides irrealis word order, also appears in the clause. When appearing in realis clauses, it combines with all three tenses (i.e. Extended Current Tense, Recent Past Tense, and Distant Past Tense) and yields imminent-future, present, and past interpretations. It is
393

ungrammatical with imperatives. It appears with all situation types. In general, IPFV conveys an unbounded situation (i.e. an open situation, part of a situation without endpoint information) in which SitT overlaps with RT. Smith (1997: 73) indicates that “the unmarked imperfective spans an interval that is internal to the situation” and that the “marked imperfective” spans “the preliminary stages of events or the resultant stages of telic events.” IPFV in Iquito renders progressive, habitual, dispositional, generic, or preliminary readings, depending on the situation types of the verbal constellation and the adverbials in the clauses. The most common uses of IPFV are the following. It focuses on the internal structure of all durative situations (i.e. Statives, Activities, Accomplishments). For non-durative situations (i.e. Achievements, Semelfactives), it focuses on the preliminary stage in the case of Achievements and it renders a multi-event reading for Semelfactives. It can also render an imminent-future reading usually with an explicit adverbial meaning ‘soon’ or other adverbials indicating a specific temporal reference, which, in a sense, focuses on the preliminary stages of all situation types in this context.
Regarding its formal identity, IPFV is morphologically marked in Iquito. Distant Past Tense and IPFV appear as a portmanteau morpheme -(y)aariqu+. In Recent Past Tense, it appears as -(y)aa except when following a short /a/ in which case the vowel is just lengthened. In the Extended Current Tense, it appears as -yaa following a long vowel and as vowel length -: following a short vowel. The following phonological rules are adapted from Lai (2005):
(827) In Distant Past Tense: -(y)aariqu+ ‘Distant Past Tense with IPFV’
(828) In Recent Past Tense (-cura): 394

Only the short vowel /a/ which ends the verbal root is lengthened; all other vowels regardless of length are followed by -yaa. It is noted that the short vowel /+/ assimilates totally to [j] and is deleted when -yaa is attached.
a) IPFV -> -:/a-__-cura
b) IPFV -> -yaa/V(V)-__-cura {V, VV}= /i, +, uu, ii, ++/
(829) In Extended Current Tense (-Ø): For verb ending in a short vowel, the last vowel of the verbal root is lengthened,
except for /+/ which changes to /i/ when lengthened. The possible vowels in point a) below include /a, i, +/.
a) IPFV -> -:/V-__-Ø {V}= /a, i, +/
For verbs ending in a long vowel, the formative -yaa suffixes. The possible vowels in point b) below include /uu, ii, ++/.126
b) IPFV -> -yaa/VV-__-Ø {VV}= /uu, ii, ++/
The following is the general temporal schema of IPFV.
126 Up to now, there are still no examples ending in /aa/.

5.7.2 Present and Past Contexts IPFV applies to all situation types in all three tenses. It renders progressive,
dispositional, habitual, preliminary, generic, and multiple-event readings, depending on the situation type in the sentence. In the following, I discuss each situation type and how IPFV spans the temporal schemata of the respective situation types.

ACTIVITIES For Activities in Extended Current Tense, IPFV renders progressive,
dispositional, and habitual/generic readings, among which the progressive reading is the most common, as in (830)-(832). The event is ongoing at the moment of speech. The dispositional reading requires more pragmatic contexts, as in (833) and (834) and the habitual reading is generally accompanied by the use of frequency adverbials, as in (835). When the sentence is negated, either a dispositional or a progressive reading is interpreted, as in (836).

(836) Ca=nu=ariicua-a-Ø. NEG=3S=sing-IPFV-EC He is not singing. He does not sing.

IPFV indicates an open situation. This can be seen from the overlapping reading of a coordinated sentence. In (837), the events of eating and talking are on-going at the same time. The pronoun nu ‘3S’ can refer to the same person or to two different persons.

(837) Nu=asa-a-Ø najahuaari

3S=eat-IPFV-EC at.the.same.time 3S=talk-IPFV-EC=VERD

He is eating and talking at the same time.

Hei is eating while hej is talking.

In Iquito, the comitative =jata also has the function of conjunction; it can be used if the agent of two events is the same, as in (838).

(838) Cuhuasiini=jata nu=asa-a-Ø. talk.INF=COM 3S=eat-IPFV-EC He is eating and talking.

In (839), it can be seen that the verb cuhuasi- ‘talk’ is intransitive. The subject of the verb is indicated by a discontinuous definite phrase in that the definite article precedes the verb while the nominal phrase remains in the postverbal position.

For Activities in the Recent Past Tense and Distant Past Tense, the most common readings of IPFV, in contrast to those in the Extended Current Tense, are habitual/generic and dispositional, as in (840) and (841). The progressive reading is yielded under more specific pragmatic and linguistic contexts, as in (842) and (843). Sentences (842) and (843), consisting of a when- clause, also serve as a diagnostic test to show that IPFV linguistically conveys open situations as an overlapping reading is obtained.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS For Accomplishments in all three tenses, the progressive is the most common
reading of IPFV, as in (844)-(846). In order to obtain a habitual/generic or dispositional reading, a frequency adverbial is required, as in (847) and (848). Speakers commented that the sentences indicate that ‘writing a letter’ was the subject’s job or part of his life, which is why he did it everyday. The sentence implies that he might have changed his job or habit now, if he were alive. In a negated sentence without an adverbial, only a progressive reading is obtained, as in (849). If the situation type in the sentence is changed to an Activity constellation, as in (850), either a dispositional or progressive reading is interpreted.

ACHIEVEMENTS For Achievements in the Extended Current Tense and Recent Past Tense,
preliminary focus (i.e. a progressive reading which focuses on the preliminary stage of an Achievement event) is the most common reading, as in (852) and (853). In the Distant Past Tense, on the other hand, a habitual/generic reading is the most common reading, as in (853) in which the frequency adverbial is optional. This is probably because when people are talking about the distant past, more frequently they talk about patterns of events and less frequently about a particular event. In order to yield a preliminary reading in the Distant Past Tense, more pragmatic and linguistic context is required, as in (855). The IPFV viewpoint, when yielding a preliminary reading, focuses an interval that preceeds, hence is preliminary to, the single stage of an Achievement. Such an interval does not include the event itself and hence does not provide information on the actual realization of the Achievement event.
(852) (Jaa) nu=sihuaani-i-Ø. 3S=arrive-IPFV-EC He is arriving. 402

(853) Amicaáca nu=sihuaani-aa-cura iíti ánuura qui-iíta=jina. one.day.away 3S=arrive-IPFV-RPST house towards 1S-house=LOC Yesterday he was arriving toward here at my house.

Sentence (856) further confirms that IPFV focuses on the preliminary stage of the Achievement event. Since the subject is prior to the state of being awake, it is not possible that he is eating at the same time, since eating requires a certain level of consciousness to perform the related muscle movements. Sentence (857) is, on the other hand, grammatical because it indicates that the subject is at the preliminary stage of waking up as well as prior to eating.
403

(857) Nu=iniica-a-Ø

asaani-ánuura.

3S=wake.up-IPFV-EC eat.INF-towards

To indicate the actual realization of an Achievement event, perfective aspects are required, as in (858) and (859).

Interestingly, in a negated sentence, IPFV conveys a perfect meaning for Achievement events. Sentence (860) does not mean the subject is not arriving. In fact, he is arriving,
404

but has not arrived yet. To indicate that the subject did not arrive, perfective aspects are used, as in (861) and (862).
(860) Ca=nu=sihuaani-i-Ø atií=yaajaa. NEG=3S=arrive-IPFV-EC at.the.moment=NWR He hasn’t arrived yet.

(862) Ca=nu=sihuaan+-Ø-cura. NEG=3S=arrive-GNR.PFV-RPST He did not arrive (yesterday).
SEMELFACTIVES For Semelfactives in the Extended Current Tense, IPFV yields an ongoing
multiple-event reading as the most common reading, as in (863) and (864). In a negated sentence, as in (865), either a habitual/generic or progressive reading is obtained.
(863) Nu=isiin++-yaa-Ø. 3S=cough-IPFV-EC He is coughing.

3S=sneeze-IPFV-EC He is sneezing.

(865) Ca=nu=isiin++-yaa-Ø. NEG=3S=cough-IPFV-EC He doesn’t cough. He is not coughing.

Sentence (866) further confirms the ongoing multiple-event reading of IPFV for Semelfactives. Since the subject is coughing and singing at the same time, the event of singing must be interrupted by multiple events of coughing.

(866) Nu=isiin++-yaa-Ø najahuaari

nu=ariicua-a-Ø=quiaaja.

3S=cough-IPFV-EC at.the.same.time 3S=sing-IPFV-EC=VERD

He is coughing and singing at the same time.

For a reading of single or multiple closed events, the perfective aspect must be used, as in (867) and (868). The number of events is not specified.

(867) Nu=isiin++-Ø-Ø. 3S=cough-GNR.PFV-EC He coughed.

(868) Nu=asíjuu-Ø-Ø. 3S=sneeze-GNR.PFV-EC He sneezed. 406

Semelfactives can also receive a habitual/generic reading, but with more pragmatic and linguistic contexts, as in (869)-(871).

(869) J++ticari ipanaca casiita-a-Ø

He coughs everyday.

In the Recent Past Tense and Distant Past Tense, habitual/generic is the default reading of Semelfactives, as in (872) and (873). An ongoing multiple event reading is available when used with a when- clause, as in (874) and (876). Sentences (874) and (875) serve as a minimal pair in that IPFV in (874) yields an overlapping reading while GNRPFV in (875) yields a sequential reading. A closed reading is not possible for IPFV; therefore, sentences (874) and (876) cannot receive the reading ‘when I arrived there he had been coughing but he wasn’t at the moment.’ In order to express this reading, the speaker has to use (875) with a further explanation, such as ‘before I arrived, he was coughing.’

STATIVES

408

For Statives in the Extended Current Tense, IPFV renders a state reading as the default reading. However, the IPFV might also render an inchoative reading for Statives, as indicated in the translation of (878), depending on the pragmatic contexts of the discourse. Such marked use of IPFV in Statives only appears with the Extended Current Tense, perhaps because the vividness of the present moment contributes dynamism to Statives. If conjoined with an event indicated by a comitative phrase, such a dynamic inchoative reading is also triggered, as in (879). In a negated sentence, only the state reading is interpreted, as in (880) and (881).

In Recent Past Tense and Distant Past Tense, the IPFV conveys a state reading. Statives and IPFV generally combine with Extended Current Tense; they only combine with Recent Past Tense and Distant Past Tense if the subject of the sentence died or incurred a change of state due to an accident or other reasons.

5.7.3 Imminent-Future Context
It is noted that an additional adverbial which specifies a later time with respect to SpT forces a temporal interpretation of the imminent future. Speakers often use this strategy (i.e. Extended Current tense, realis mood, and IPFV in combination with an additional adverbial to indicate a situation in the imminent future) if they view the
410

situation as fairly close in terms of temporal distance and feel certain about its realization. This strategy can be applied to all situation types as follows.

5.7.4 Summary In Iquito, IPFV has the functions of a general imperfective as well as a
progressive as it applies to all situation types. When applied to the basic level of the verbal constellation, it conveys a progressive reading for Activities and Accomplishments, a preliminary reading for Achievements, an ongoing multiple-event reading for Semelfactives and a state reading for Statives. When used in more specific pragmatic and linguistic contexts (i.e. combined with frequency adverbials, etc.), dispositional and habitual/generic readings can be obtained for Activities, a habitual/generic reading for Accomplishments, Achievements, and Semelfactives, and an inchoative reading for Statives. Interestingly, there is a scale with respect to which reading is considered the most common one according to the particular tense it is
412

combined with. It is perhaps due to the fact that when talking about the distant past, people frequently talk about patterns of events or states and less frequently talk about a specific event. Consequently, habitual/generic readings are generally obtained in past tenses without frequency adverbials while such readings generally occur with adverbials in Extended Current Tense. Habituals and generics are structurally quite similar in Iquito.
5.8 CONCLUSION In this chapter, I discussed the grammatical aspects in Iquito. There are seven
perfective aspects (i.e. General Perfective Aspect, Momentary Perfective Aspect, Remote Perfective Aspect, two Deictic Perfective Aspects, Allative Perfective Aspect and Ablative Perfective Aspect) and one Imperfective Aspect. Some of these perfective aspects incorporate an adverbial component while others incorporate directional or deictic components. The system of perfective aspects in Iquito manifests the importance of expressing the realization of an event in conjunction with information about the time of day, the location and the routing in terms of location (i.e. whether the event is realized upon arrival and if the subject leaves upon completion of the event). Perhaps the additional information has been so important (i.e. frequently expressed) that it is encoded synchronically as portmanteau morphemes together with the perfective meaning. The Imperfective Aspect is interesting as even though it has multiple functions when combining with different situation types, a scale of the most common reading to the least common reading is observed according to the tense it combines with. This scale reflects the important role of language use in determining the ultimate interpretation.

Chapter 6: Situation Aspect127
6.1 INTRODUCTION The dissertation adopts Smith’s (1997[1991]) two-component theory of aspect
which includes viewpoint aspects (discussed in §5) and situation aspects (this chapter). The aspectual meaning of a given sentence results from the interaction of these two independent yet interacting components of aspect. Viewpoint aspect, grammatically encoded, semantically conveys the boundedness of a given situation (i.e. a bounded situation in its entirety vs. an unbounded situation in part). Situation aspect, expressed through the verb constellation (i.e. the verb and its argument), conveys intrinsic temporal properties of a situation. This chapter first gives an overview of the fundamentals of situation aspect in terms of different approaches and details the currently assumed approach in §6.1; then it continues with a discussion of situation types in Iquito in §6.2, including the basic properties and temporal schema of each type and its language-specific linguistic correlates; §6.3 concludes this chapter. Event quantification, including iterative, frequentative, and verbal number/pluractionality, is often discussed together with situation aspect as readers of the situation aspect literature are often interested in finding more information on this topic. In many languages, event quantification is expressed through productive morphology. In Iquito, however, it is conveyed through a set of synchronically unproductive derivational verbal morphemes. Because the discussion of event quantification in Iquito is essentially different from other analyses and consists of lists of words, I include this discussion in Appendix 1.
127 In this dissertation I use the terms situation aspect and situation type quite interchangeably. Strictly speaking, I consider situation aspect as conceptual categories of human cognition and situation type as “covert linguistic categories” (in accordance with Smith 1997) which could manifest differently crosslinguistically.
414

Vendler (1967: 97) points out that “the use of a verb may also suggest the particular way in which that verb presupposes and involves the notion of time” and proposes four types, including States, Activities, Accomplishments and Achievements. Smith (1997) adds a fifth type which is Semelfactives. Aspectual properties of a situation are presumably part of human cognition as conceptual categories while situation types are considered, in the literature, equivalent to these categories (Bach 1981, Parsons 1990, among others), or as covert linguistic categories because they are manifested through language-specific correlates and are not directly coded in the grammar (Vendler 1967, Dowty 1979, Smith 1997, among others). The situation-type relevant linguistic elements or constituents are considered to be VP (Dowty 1979, Verkuyl 1993), AspP (Borer 2005), both verb head and VP (Rothstein 2004), or a verb constellation (Smith 1997) which includes the verb and its arguments, corresponding to all non-optional lexical elements at the clausal level. I assume Smith’s (1997) approach as the situation type is compositional and is ultimately determined by properties of all elements in the clause, including nominal and verbal ones. In terms of characterizing situation types, both a set approach (Bach 1981, Pustejosvky 1995) and a feature approach (Verkuyl 1989, Smith 1997, Rothstein 2004) have been used. A set approach assumes hierarchical relationships among the situation types while a feature approach directly captures the situation types by the value of features, assuming no hierarchy and showing situation-type shifting as the result of feature changing. Verkuyl (1989) provides a verbal [ADDTO] and a nominal feature [SQA], distinguishing States, atelic events (i.e. Semelfactives and Activities) and telic events (i.e. Achievements and Accomplishments). Verkuyl (2005: 203) states that “the [+ADDTO]-property of the verb expresses dynamic progress, change, nonstativity or whatever term is available to distinguish it from stative verbs, which have a minus value. The [+SQA]-feature expresses that the NP pertains to a specified quantity of things or
415

mass denoted by its head noun.” Rothstein (2004) provides two features, [stage] and [telic], and distinguishes four types which are States, Activities, Achievements and Accomplishments while grouping Semelfactives and Activities together. Smith (1997) provides three covert temporal features: dynamism (i.e. agency), duration (i.e. durative vs. instantaneous), and telicity (i.e. completion and change of state). She distinguishes five situation types: States are [-dynamic], [+durative] and [-telic]; Activities are [+dynamic], [+durative] and [-telic]; Accomplishments are [+dynamic], [+durative] and [+telic]; Achievements are [+dynamic], [-durative] and [+telic]; and Semelfactives are [+dynamic], [-durative] and [-telic]. Besides duration, detachability also distinguishes Accomplishments from Achievements. Smith includes two levels of composition, which are a basic level and a derived level. This chapter assumes Smith’s framework. I assume situation types as covert linguistic categories (i.e. rather than a direct correspondence of conceptual categories of aspect) that is manifested through language-specific linguistic correlates. Situation type is conveyed by the verb constellation as it is interpreted at a clausal level and it is characterized by three temporal features-dynamism, duration, and telicity. With respect to the number of situation types, I propose to add a sixth type, Motion, in Iquito, as it reflects language-specific correlates. In this work, I use the term motion as both a situation type and a parameter feature for Iquito. Perhaps a more accurate term, such as [repetitive process with a directed path in mind],128 should be considered in future research. It is worth noting that there seems to be a correspondence between situation types (i.e. in terms of temporal schemata) and verb classes (i.e. in terms of semantics). However, because the three parameters (i.e. dynamism, duration and telicity) might not be equally crucial crosslinguistically, the instantiation (i.e. manifested
128 I use the term motion as a parameter feature because I am not really satisfied with the term [repetitive process with a directed path in mind]. Perhaps an even better term should be used in future research. It is also noted that this is a tentative proposal for a language-specific finding and I am using the term motion to denote the group of verbs that demonstrates this correlate; a few of them are not necessarily motion verbs.
416

temporal schemata through grammatical correlates) of the situation types in individual languages might not be the same. For example, in Thai, according to Sudmuk (2003), duration, instead of telicity, is crucial for events. As such, in some languages, Activities and Accomplishments might not be clearly distinct situation types although they might still be different verb classes, both cognitively and in terms of syntactic constructions. Motion verbs, semantically as a verb class, are commonly considered as pertaining to Activities in terms of situation type; Smith does not specifically distinguish the two. However, they have been proposed, by some authors, to be distinct in the aspectual system. Tenny (1995) indicates that Motion verbs are aspectually special. Janda (2007) states that “motion verbs are prototypical in the Russian aspectual system.” In the case of Iquito, the fact that the default use of certain perfective aspects clashes with Motion verbs and coerces derived meanings, among other grammatical correlates, suggests that Motion verbs have distinct temporal schemata, which consequently constitutes a distinct situation type. This proposal of adding Motion as a sixth situation type in Iquito is a pioneering and preliminary one, which is still a continuing research topic.
6.2 SITUATION TYPES This section discusses the classification of situation types in Iquito, distinguished
by internal temporal features in terms of dynamism, duration, and telicity. Situation types are covert grammatical categories realized at the clausal level through linguistic correlates. According to Smith (1997), a given situation type is indirectly grammaticized in a language if verb constellations have a consistent set of linguistic properties. She assumes five idealized situation types which hold universally across languages: Activities, Accomplishments, Achievements, Semelfactives, and Statives. I propose that this is generally true in Iquito, with some modifications. Iquito has six distinguished
417

situation types as demonstrated in their linguistic correlates: Activities, Accomplishments, Achievements, Semelfactives, Statives, and Motions. Motion clauses generally have the same linguistic correlates as Activities or Accomplishments, depending on the adverbials (i.e. if there is a goal indicated) in the sentences, except when appearing with the Ablative Perfective -(y)aar++ and the directional postposition ánuura, in which case Motion clauses receive marked interpretations in the former situation or are the only grammatical sentences in the later situation. The parameters which distinguish the six situation types in Iquito are therefore dynamism, duration, telicity, and motion. In the following, I discuss the situation types manifested in Iquito in terms of the three parameters of the internal temporal features and the linguistic correlates and show how Motion verbs are a distinct class in Iquito in terms of languagespecific grammatical correlates.
Dynamism The temporal feature of dynamism requires agency as the source of energy, by
which it distinguishes statives from events. Statives, therefore, cannot appear in the imperative construction and, correspondingly, cannot be the complements of verbs, such as ‘command’ or ‘order.’ Statives are also incompatible with manner or instrumental adverbials. In terms of language-specific grammatical correlates, Statives in Iquito generally appear with Imperfective Aspect. The combination of different perfective129 aspects and Statives triggers different readings. The combination of Statives and General Perfective triggers an inceptive reading, in which case the General Perfective spans the initial endpoint plus an extended interval, indicating that the situation begins prior to RT. The combination of Statives and the Momentary Perfective triggers an inceptive reading
129 There are 7 perfective aspects in Iquito: General Perfective, Momentary Perfective, Remote Perfective, two Deictic Perfectives, Allative Perfective and Ablative Perfective, which are discussed in detail in §5.
418

which solely focuses on the coerced initial endpoint. Remote Perfective indicates that the states began (i.e. the change of state began to hold) in the morning of a given day. Deictic Perfective Aspects indicate the location where the states began or obtained. With the Allative Perfective, the initial endpoint of a Stative is coerced upon the arrival of a given subject. With the Ablative Perfective, the initial endpoint of a Stative is coerced before the departure of a given subject. This section will discuss these language-specific grammatical correlates.
Duration The temporal feature of duration has adverbial and verbal linguistic correlates by
which it distinguishes duratives from non-duratives. Durative verb constellations are compatible with simple durative adverbials (i.e. for x time), indirect durative adverbials (i.e. slowly, quickly) and inceptive and terminative verbs (i.e. begin, stop) which imply a durative situation. If combined with momentary adverbials (i.e. suddenly, at noon), an inceptive interpretation is rendered. Instantaneous verb constellations, on the other hand, are not compatible with simple durative adverbials, indirect durative adverbials or inceptive or terminative verbs. The sentences are either ungrammatical or yield marked interpretations (i.e. the duration of the preliminary or resultant state, derived multipleevent Activities). Instantaneous verb constellations are compatible with momentary adverbials which depict the moment when events occur. When combined with Imperfective Aspect, duratives focus on the internal stages while the instantaneous events focus on the preliminary stages. In terms of language-specific grammatical correlates, instantaneous telic (i.e. Achievement) events occur with the Momentary Perfective. The combination of the Momentary Perfective Aspect with all other events triggers an ‘inpassing’ reading (i.e. the event is realized as a separate interrupting route with respect to
419

a main route). The General Perfective is used in combination with instantaneous events only when SitT precedes RT.
Telicity The temporal feature of telicity has verbal correlates (i.e. finish vs. stop) and
adverbial correlates (i.e. in x time vs. for x time) to distinguish Accomplishments from Activities. This is true in Iquito. Speakers can use the verb ‘finish’ and the adverbial ‘in x time’ with Activities only when there is a presupposed goal. They prefer to use the verb ‘stop’ and the simple durative adverbial ‘for x time’ with Activities. What distinguishes Accomplishments from Achievements is that when the adverbial ‘in x time’ is used for Accomplishments, the events span the entire duration. When it is used with Achievements, the expression receives the reading ‘it has been x time that’ which means it has been a certain period of time since the Achievement event has been realized. Speakers prefer to use the verb ‘stop’ for the termination of multiple-event Activities. In addition, the imperfective Activity sentences entail a perfective Activity sentence while imperfective Accomplishment sentences do not entail the completion of the event.
6.2.1 Activities The Activity situation type has the temporal features of [+dynamic], [-telic], and
[+durative], and is an event with dynamic stages that goes on for an interval of time without an outcome, therefore without a natural endpoint. Its temporal schema is shown in Diagram 12. The symbol ‘I’ indicates the initial endpoint and ‘F’ indicates the final endpoint of the event. The subscript ‘Arb’ indicates that the event contains an arbitrary endpoint instead of a natural one. The dots indicate the internal stages of the event. Let’s take ‘talking’ as an example of an Activity. The event of ‘talking’ requires an input of
420

energy. At one moment the person who is talking moves his tongue towards the front of the mouth and at the other moment he moves it towards the back. The event of ‘talking’ hence spans a period of time with a sequence of mouth-moving stages. ‘Talking’ can continue as long as the input of agency is sustained and can end any time when the source of agency ceases; therefore, it is an event with an arbitrary ending, a temporal bound. Other notions relevant to the atelicity of Activities are known as ‘homogeneity’ and ‘cumulativity.’ Homogeneity entails that any sub-stretch of an Activity event constitutes an instance of such an Activity. However, an Activity is not entirely homogenous because, for example, at one moment a person might be opening the mouth but is not talking. The notion of cumulativity (Krifka 1992, Rothstein 2004) is a much more precise notion in that an event such as ‘talking’ consists of sub-events of ‘talk.’ Smith’s (1997) Entailment Pattern for Activities states: “If an Activity event A holds at interval I, then the process associated with that event holds at all intervals of I, down to intervals too small to count as A.”

6.2.2 Accomplishments The Accomplishment situation type has the temporal features of [+dynamic],
[+telic], and [+durative] and consists of a process and an outcome or a change of state. The successive stages of the process advance to the natural final endpoint which is the completion of the event and bring about a change of state. The temporal schema of Accomplishments is provided in Diagram 13. Again, ‘I’ indicates the initial endpoint and ‘F’ indicates the final endpoint of the event. The subscript ‘Nat R’ indicates that the event contains a natural endpoint which leads to a result or change of state. The dots indicate the internal stages of the event. As a telic event, an Accomplishment does not fit with the notion of cumulativity (Krifka 1992, Rothstein 2004) because an event such as [build a house] does not consist of sub-events of [build a house]. Smith’s Entailment Pattern for Accomplishments states: If event A occurs at interval I, then the process associated with A occurs during the internal stages of that interval.
Diagram 13. Temporal Schema of Accomplishments
I…….FNat R
The imperfective Accomplishment sentences, unlike Activity sentences, do not entail perfective Accomplishment sentences. However, as a language-specific property, the General Perfective Aspect in Iquito semantically encodes only termination, not
427

completion.131 Therefore, an imperfective Accomplishment, as in (916) and (917), does entail the counterpart perfective sentence, as in (918) and (919). Nevertheless, it does not entail the completion of the event as it can combine with a sentence which asserts an open situation, as in (920) and (921), or a closed situation, as in (922) and (923).

Accomplishments have a natural endpoint. A sentence which asserts the completion of the event is incompatible with a sentence which asserts an open situation, as in (924) and (925), unless it is a new event which involves writing a new letter or building another house. Momentary Perfective Aspect in the examples indicates a recent completion of the events relative to RT.

As mentioned above, to assert the completion of an Accomplishment sentence, the verb p+ca- ‘finish’ is used. To assert the termination and the incompletion of an Accomplishment, the verb quit+- ‘stop’ can be used, as in (938). The house indicated in the sentence is not completed.

núquiica iíta miini.

3S=stop-MMT.PFV-EC one

house do.INF

He stopped building a house.

In contrast with Accomplishments, speakers prefer to use the verb quit+- ‘stop’ for Activities, as in (939), unless a presupposed goal is realized.

(939) Nu=quit+-r++-Ø

cuhuasiini.

3S=stop-MMT.PFV-EC talk.INF

He stopped talking.

What differentiates Accomplishments from Activities is in part the non-detachability feature which indicates the relationship between the process and the outcome/result of the Accomplishment situation type. One of the most common tests is with the adverb almost. For example, the sentence he almost built a house might have the interpretation of ‘he almost began building a house’ or ‘he almost successfully completed building a house.’ The above-demonstrated examples include a constructed object, a written letter or a built
433

house. Derived Accomplishments from Activities, such as (901) and (902), repeated below, do not have the feature of change of state as the outcome; therefore, they do not have the feature of non-detachability. The sentence he almost sang for three hours cannot have the interpretation of ‘he almost began singing for three hours.’

6.2.3 Achievements The Achievement situation type is instantaneous (i.e. occurs in a moment) and
includes a change of state. Its temporal features are [+dynamic], [-durative], [+telic]. Diagram 13 provides the temporal schema of Achievements. Achievements are singlestage events that result in a change of state. The dots indicate the preliminary and the resultant stages which are not part of the event. It is noted that Achievements might or might not have preliminary or resultant stages; some Achievement events such as [recognize] and [find out] do not necessarily have preliminary stages. Because Achievements are single-stage events, they are detached from any associated process and there is no whole-part entailment. That is to say, if the sentence John arrived is true at a certain time T, John was arriving would not be true at the same time T. It might be true at T-1, a time earlier than time T.
434

Diagram 14. Temporal Schema of Achievements …….ER.......

Imperfective Achievement sentences, which focus on the preliminary stage of an event, do not entail perfective Achievement sentences. Therefore, an imperfective Achievement, as in (942) and (943), does not entail the counterpart perfective sentence, as in (944) and (945).

(942) Ácari taarqui nu=ta

(945) Jaa nu=sihuaan+-r++-Ø. already 3S=arrive-MMT.PFV-EC He already arrived.
435

As a language-particular grammatical correlate, instantaneous telic Achievements appear with the Momentary Perfective Aspect in which SitT=RT. Therefore, if a person witnessed someone else waking up, sentence (946) is used instead of (944). The event of [he wake up] is in the proximity of RT which is the same as SpT in a sentence in the Extended Current Tense. If SitT < RT, the General Perfective Aspect is used, as in (944).

(946) Jaa nu=iniica-r++-Ø. already 3S=wake.up-MTT.PFV-EC He already woke up.

In (947), the SitT of the event [he finish writing two letters] precedes the RT introduced by the when- clause. Therefore, the General Perfective Aspect is used in the principal clause which contains the event [he finish writing two letters].

When I arrived there (yesterday), he had already finished writing two letters.

The imperfective Achievement sentences do not entail the perfective Achievement sentences. This can also be observed from the compatibility of the imperfective clauses

436

with another clause which asserts an open situation, as in (948) and (949). The Imperfective Aspect in Iquito hence focuses on the preliminary stages of Achievements.

Achievements are intrinsically bounded and have natural endpoints. A sentence which asserts the culmination of an Achievement is incompatible with a sentence which asserts an open situation, as in (950) and (951).

Achievements are instantaneous and hence are not compatible with simple durative adverbials, as in (952) and (953). Instead of using the simple durative adverbials, such as s++saramaj+táami hora ‘for three hours’ or p+y++in iina nin++ni ‘all night long,’ speakers use the expression jaari t++ s++saramaj+táami hora ‘it has been three hours,’ as in (954) and (955).

The adverbial suhuaaramaj+táami hora=jina ‘in four hours’ can be used to give the ingressive reading of Achievements. At the end of the four-hour period, they arrived.

Achievements are dynamic and appear in imperative constructions, as in (957) and (958), and as the complement of the verb ‘order,’ as in (959) and (960).

Indirect durative adverbials can appear with Achievements, but they focus on the preliminary stages of events, as in (963). A clause containing an indirect durative adverbial is compatible with another clause asserting an open situation, as in (964).

Achievements are compatible with punctual adverbs, as in (965) and (966). Unlike in Accomplishment sentences, punctual adverbials do not trigger inceptive readings of events; they represent the actual occurrence of the events.

Another point which distinguishes Achievements from Accomplishments is the incompatibility with the aspectual verb which expresses the final completion of a durative event, as in (967) and (968).

(967) *Nu=p+ca-r++-Ø

Achievement sentences derived from Activities or Accomplishments, as in (912), (913), (922), (923), (926), (927), (938) and (939), appear with aspectual verbs such as namit+‘begin,’ p+ca- ‘finish,’ and quit+- ‘stop.’ Example (912) is repeated as (969) below. The Momentary Perfective Aspect r++- appears with Achievements and spans the temporal schema of single-stage events. When appearing with Activities, Accomplishments, and Semelfactives, an ‘in passing’ reading is rendered, as in (970)-(972). This is discussed in detail in §5.3.

6.2.4 Semelfactives Semelfactives are single-stage events with no outcome or result, with the temporal
features of [+dynamic], [-durative] and [-telic]. The temporal schema of Semelfactives is as in Diagram 15. The symbol ‘E’ denotes an instantaneous event without outcome. Semelfactives are proposed by Smith as they are not included in Vendler’s (1967) classic typology. They are grouped with Achievements by Vendler (1967) because they are both punctual, with Activities in Verkuyl (1989) and Rothstein (2004) because repetition of Semelfactives (viewed as sub-events of Activities) constitutes Activities. Smith’s (1997) feature [-telic] separates Semelfactives from Achievements even though both of them are [-durative]; the feature [-durative] in turn distinguishes Semelfactives from Activities even though both of them are [-telic]. As Smith assumes a basic level and a derived level of situation type shifted by adverbials or viewpoints through the clash of features,
443

repetition of Semelfactives is treated as a derived Activity event consisting of multiple sub-events. For example, the sentence John sneezed (i.e. [-durative]) is a sentence with a Semelfactive verb constellation at the basic level while John sneezed for an hour (i.e. [+durative]) is interpreted as a multiple-event Activity at the derived level.

Diagram 15. Temporal Schema of Semelfactives …….E…….

Semelfactives have the property of dynamism and, correspondingly, can appear in imperative constructions or as the complement of the verb ‘order.’ Examples (974)-(977) can appear in the context of a theater play or when people are establishing a certain signal to correspond to certain information. For example, people can say ‘cough once when people see us.’

Iquito has non-productive derivational morphology132 to derive a verbal stem, which encodes a mass number of multiple events, from an underived verbal root, which encodes a countable number of events. A few derived verbal stems are lexicalized and re-analyzed as a new verbal root. Example (984), which yields the same interpretation as that of (982), is not used all the time by the same speaker, and furthermore, not by all speakers. In addition, for the interpretation of a single event, the adverbial suhuaaramaj+táami hora=jina ‘in four hours’ is used, as in (985).

132 For a detailed discussion of this topic, please refer to Appendix 1: Event Quantification in Derivational Morphology.

6.2.5 Statives The Stative situation type includes an undifferentiated (i.e. without internal
structure) period of time (i.e. a moment, the minimal duration, or an interval), during whmch it obtains. Its temporal features are [-dynamic], [+durative], [-telic]. There might be a change into the state (i.e. initial endpoint) and change out of the state (i.e. final endpoint) involved; however, such endpoints, constituting changes of state, are distinct
447

situations instead of being part of the State. As indicated in Diagram 16, ‘I’ and ‘F’ are given in parentheses as they are not part of the State. The straight line indicates the undifferentiated period.

Diagram 16. Temporal Schema of States (I)_______(F)

Two kinds of States are identified: individual-level and stage-level States (Carlson 1977, 1980). Individual-level Statives (such as Spanish ser) denote properties of individuals which are considered more stable or permanent; stage-level Statives (such as Spanish estar) denote properties of stages (i.e. spatio-temporal manifestations) of individuals, which are considered transitory, temporary or episodic. In a derived level, Statives include generic and habitual readings of events (i.e. non-stative situation types). In the following, I discuss sentences of two commonly used verbs nacusi- ‘know, be acquainted with’ and iiqui- ‘live, EXT.’ Stative predicates in Iquito are generally expressed in the sentences with Imperfective Aspect, as in (988) and (989).

(989) Jaime iiqui-i-Ø iíti. Jaimelive/EXT-EC here Jaime lives here. Jaime is here.
448

In accordance with the non-dynamic temporal feature, Statives indeed cannot appear in imperative constructions, as in (990) and (991).

(990) #Nacusi-qui

Iquitu cuhuasiini!

know-GNR.PFV Iquito speak.INF

(991) #Iiqui-qui iíti! live-GNR.PFV here Live here!

The speakers made corrections and provided the following sentences instead.

(992) Paj+-qui

Statives also cannot appear as the complement of the verb ‘order,’ as in (994) and (995).

Statives also cannot appear with volitional adverbials, as in (998) and (999). Speaker Jaime commented that people might be able to guess what you mean by sentence (999) as it might refer to the things a person does that constitute his life and he does those things carefully. With respect to the sentences (998) and (999), the improved sentences are (1000) and (1001), respectively.

As Statives do not differentiate within the period they cover, they are odd with indirect durative adverbials, such as slowly and quickly, unless the adverbials refer to the coming about of states, as in (1002), in which case, the sentence is arguably a derived Achievement because the Imperfective Aspect focuses on the preliminary stage of ‘the change of state.’ Sometimes, speakers resolve the weirdness by interpreting that the adverb does not have scope over the Stative verb, as in (1003). The adverb has scope over the infinitive verb ‘speak.’ Example (1004) has no alternative interpretation and, therefore, is completely bad as indicated by the speaker.

As a language-specific grammatical correlate, Iquito Statives usually appear with the Imperfective Aspect. An inceptive reading is rendered when they appear with perfective aspects. Momentary Perfective Aspect coerces derived Achievements which focus on the instantaneous initial endpoints of the States, as in (1007) and (1008). General Perfective Aspect generally triggers an inceptive reading and spans the initial endpoint plus an
452

extended interval, indicating that the states obtain before RT, as in (1009). A detailed discussion is provided in §5.

Derived Statives are triggered by frequency adverbials combining with non-statives, as in (1010).

6.2.6 Motions
In Iquito, there is a group of Motion verbs, including n+t++ni ‘to run,’ musiini ‘swim,’ icuuni ‘walk,’ ++ni ‘fly,’ among others, which form a distinct class in terms of
453

language-specific grammatical correlates. Motion clauses generally have the same linguistic correlates as Activities or Accomplishments, depending on whether they have an adverbial indicating the destination. Examples (1011) and (1012) entail the perfective sentences (1013) and (1014), respectively.

(1011) Taaríqui nu=ta

(1014) Jaa nu=musi-qui-Ø. already 3S=swim-GNR.PFV-EC He already swam.

Imperfective sentences are incompatible with sentences which assert that the Motion events did not take place, as in (1015) and (1016).

The Motion events do not have a natural endpoint, unless a goal is indicated. The features of atelicity and duration are indicated by the combination with a sentence which asserts an open situation, as in (1017) and (1018).

The situation type value of Activity shifts to a derived Accomplishment when combining with a bounding durative adverbial, as in (1019) and (1020).

Motion sentences are dynamic. They can appear in imperative constructions and as the complement of the verb ‘order,’ as in (1021) and (1022), and (1023) and (1024), respectively.

(1021) N+t+-qui! Run-GNR.PFV Run!

(1024) Qui=iyáquita-qui-Ø Hirmicu nu=musiini=iira. 1S=order-GNR.PFV-EC Hermico 3S=swim.INF=GOAL I ordered Hermico to swim.

They can also appear with volitional adverbials, reflecting the feature of dynamism, as in (1025) and (1026).

(1025) Jaimenu=n+ti-i-Ø

ca=marij++ni=jata.

ca=marij++ni=jata.

Hermico 3S=swim-IPFV-EC NEG=mistake.INF=COM

Hermico is swimming carefully.

Activities are durative and, therefore, are compatible with an inceptive verb, which implies a durative situation, as in (1027) and (1028).

Indirect durative adverbials are also compatible with Activities and describe the progress of internal stages.

(1030) Macuaarica nu=musi-i-Ø

naji j++ta núquiica m+tiija.

slowly 3S=swim-IPFV-EC as like one taricaya

He is swimming slowly like a taricaya turtle.

Activities are durative. Therefore, when combined with punctual adverbials, inceptive readings are rendered, as in (1031) and (1032). Where Motions differ from Activities in Iquito, in terms of linguistic correlates, is that Motion verbs combine with the Ablative Perfective Aspect instead of the General Perfective Aspect with punctual adverbials. The General Perfective Aspect can appear in this context only when the speaker is depicting a previous event. The speakers Jaime and Hermico commented that it is rarely used.

(1031) Tiijicuaji, nu=n+ti-aar++-Ø. suddenly 3S=run-ABL.PFV-EC Suddenly, he ran.

458

(1032) Tiijicuaji, nu=musi-aar++-Ø. suddenly 3S=swim-ABL.PFV-EC Suddenly, he swam.

The inceptive reading of the Ablative Perfective Aspect only applies to very few verbs, including the Motion verbs mentioned above and the verb maqu++ni ‘to sleep,’ as in (1033).

(1033) Jaa nu=maqui-aar++-Ø

ácari=yaa=jaari.

already 3S=sleep-ABL.PRF-EC now=NWR=already

He already fell asleep just now.

When Activities combine with the Ablative Perfective Aspect, the reading is ‘realized the event and then left the premises,’ as in (1034).

(1034) Jaa Hermico cuhuasi-aar++-Ø. already Hermico talk-ABL.PFV-EC Hermico already talked and left.

Besides the above-mentioned grammatical correlates, the directional purposive postposition ánuura is another specific linguistic correlate of Motion verbs. In a clause which contains ánuura, only Motion verbs can appear as the main verb, as in (1035). The sentences containing non-motion verbs as the main verb are ungrammatical. As can be seen in (1036), the compatible postposition is =iira.

In this section, I discussed the classification of situation types in Iquito in terms of the temporal features of dynamism, duration and telicity. Distinct situation types have respective consistent sets of linguistic properties in Iquito. I proposed that Iquito has six distinct situation types as demonstrated in their linguistic correlates: Activities, Accomplishments, Achievements, Semelfactives, Statives, and Motions. The parameters which distinguish the six situation types in Iquito are therefore dynamism, duration, telicity, and motion.

6.3 CONCLUSION This chapter first provided an overview of the fundamentals of situation aspect in
terms of various approaches and proposed using Smith’s (1997[1991]) framework. I assume situation types as covert linguistic categories that are manifested through language-specific linguistic correlates at the clausal level. The classification of situation types is characterized by the internal temporal features in terms of dynamism, duration and telicity. With respect to the number of situation types, I propose to add a sixth type, Motion, in Iquito as it reflects language-specific correlates.

Chapter 7: Oral Texts and Discourse Modes
7.1 INTRODUCTION As discussed in §3, tense and temporal interpretations of single/independent
sentences are deictic; that is to say, the default way to determine the temporal location of a situation is based on the perspective of the speaker and is oriented to SpT. To expand the domain of the study of tense and temporal interpretation, the current chapter aims to explore Iquito text at the passage level (i.e. at least two sentences in context, stretches of text, text segments) in which various modes of discourse are manifest. Smith (2003) uses the term “discourse” to refer to both spoken and written material and reserves the term “text” for written material. In the field of language documentation, the term “text” is generally used to refer to transcribed material of audio recordings from oral activities. As the Iquito language does not have a writing tradition, although the Iquito people practice painting culturally, writing consequently does not constitute a distinct genre. This dissertation follows Smith’s (2003) terms and definitions for “discourse” and “discourse mode,” while using the terms “text” or “oral text” to refer to the transcribed version of originally oral content.
Smith (2003) proposes five discourse modes133 manifested at the passage level: Narrative, Report, Description, Information (as “Informative” in Smith 2004), and Argument (as “Argument-Commentary” in Smith 2004). They are characterized in terms of types of text organization (i.e. temporal, atemporal), of entities (i.e. eventualities, general statives, abstract entities), of progression (i.e. temporal/spatial, metaphorical), and of patterns of tense interpretation (i.e. deictic, narrative/continuity, anaphoric). These features are interrelated as, for example, principles of progression change in accordance
133 This does not include procedural texts and conversations.
461

with the types of entities and the organizational temporality of a given passage. Temporality, pertaining to human cognition, is essential in differentiating between the modes: Narrative, Report, and Description are temporally organized modes and are located in time while Information and Argument are not temporally organized and are not located in time. The main types of entity introduced into the discourse universe are eventualities and abstract entities. These correspond to the temporality discussed above since eventualities are temporally located in the world while abstract entities are not. Eventualities include events, states and general statives (including generics and generalizations). Abstract entities include facts, propositions, and projective propositions. Different types of entities prevail in different discourse modes. The following summary is adapted from Smith (2004).

In terms of principles of text progression (i.e. advancement), in temporally organized discourse modes (i.e. Narrative, Report, and Description) text advances as temporal or spatial location changes, while in atemporally organized discourse modes (i.e. Information and Argument) text advances along with metaphorical motion or change of metaphorical location. Subtypes of text progression are discussed in the following under each discourse mode.
462

Smith (2004) states that “at the local level of the passage, one recognizes stretches of text that are intuitively of different types, e.g. Narrative, Description, Commentary” and that “these stretches tend to have a particular force and a characteristic cluster of linguistic features and interpretations.” In the following I discuss the five modes individually. Moens (1987) points out that the main component of a narrative is the episode, which is a series of sequentially ordered and consequentially related events and states. These subevents “occur in a certain order, which is crucial for understanding” (Smith, 2003). The text of a narrative is therefore temporally organized and is located in time. After the first sentence of a passage, the understanding of RT depends on that of the previous sentence, and is not in accordance with SpT. Narrative RT advances according to the dynamism of events, with “perfective event sentences and with explicit temporal adverbials” (Smith, 2004). In addition, inference about change of time from change of location also advances narrative time (Smith, 2003). Tense in narrative mode conveys continuity instead of temporal location. That is to say, tense is not interpreted as deictically related to SpT; rather, it is interpreted as internally related to other clauses and RT advances with each bounded sentence. Narrative mode also consists of a limited anaphoric pattern in which the RT of a given sentence is the same as that of the preceding sentence when the sentence is unbounded. The continuity pattern is represented schematically in Diagram 17 and the anaphoric pattern in Diagram 18.

RT2 = RT1

Like Narrative, the Report mode mainly consists of eventualities. The difference between Report and Narrative in terms of the ordering of situations is that it is less significant in a Report because it neither determines nor changes the interpretation. The text of a Report is temporally organized and is located in time. However, the situations in the text are not related to each other; rather, they are related to SpT, the temporal perspective of the reporter. As such, Report RT advances according to the temporal standpoint of the reporter. Tense, as well as temporal adverbials, in Report mode conveys deixis with SpT as the orientation point, very much like the temporal interpretation of single/independent sentences. Tense frequently changes back and forth, confirming that the presentation order of the situations does not correspond to the temporally sequential order of events. The deictic pattern (with past tense) is schematically represented in Diagram 19 below.

RT1 < SpT

RT2 < SpT

RT3 < SpT RT4 < SpT

Like Narrative and Report, the Description mode mainly consists of eventualities, as opposed to abstract entities. However, the situations are unbounded, including ongoing events, states, and statives. Time in Description is static, without dynamism. There might
464

be perfective sentences, but they do not advance time. As Smith (2004) states, “if there is motion it doesn’t involve significant changes of state and there is no sense that time advances.” She posited a tacit durative time adverbial that has scope over the entire description, the duration of which depends on the context. That temporal stability and the coercion effect of perfective sentences in Description is interpreted with no temporal advancement can be attributed to such a tacit temporal adverbial. In addition, a locative adverbial in general appears as the first sentence to set the scene and has scope over the entire Description passage. The text of a Description is temporally organized and is located in time. However, as mentioned earlier, the time is static and the situations in the text share the same RT, an anaphoric pattern, as shown above in Diagram 18. Text does not advance temporally; rather, it advances spatially as the description moves from one part to another part of the scene. The presentational order of sentences corresponds to the path being traversed in the scene.
Information and Argument modes, unlike Narrative, Report, and Description mode, consist of statives and abstract entities in general. There might be sentences that express eventualities in the passage; however, they function to illustrate the relevant point, but are not part of the intended information or argument. These two modes are not temporally organized; the text progresses in a metaphorical domain, instead of a temporal or spatial domain. Smith (2003: 31) states that “The idea can be implemented with the notion of a Primary Referent that is semantically central to a situation. Each clause in a passage has a Primary Referent. When the Primary Referent moves metaphorically from one part of the text domain to another, one has the intuition of metaphorical progression.” The Primary Referent corresponds to Patient and Theme in general. She further states that “conventional organizing principles include causal relations, chronology, and geography (pp. 31),” which is timeless, not temporally organized. Information and Argument modes
465

differ in several ways. Their major types of entities are different: Information contains mainly facts and general statives while Argument contains all abstract entities, including propositions, and statives. They also differ in subjectivity: Information presents a collection of (uncontroversial) facts and generalizations while Argument presents potentially controversial findings or comments and the author might be strongly present or not depending on the use of deictic terms. Both Information and Argument have a deictic pattern as the function of tense. The choice of tense conveys deixis as tense anchors to SpT.
In summary, the three tense patterns (i.e. continuity, anaphora, and deixis) are demonstrated for non-first clauses of text passages with the first sentence being interpreted by the default deictic principle. The five discourse modes are interactive and frequently co-exist in a stretch of text. For example, a Description passage might appear in a larger Narrative Mode; a Narrative passage might appear in a larger Information or Argument passage to assist in illustrating the main point. Smith (2004) states that the list of five modes is perhaps not complete but is significantly representative, and that the list must be relatively short if it were to represent a generalization. Allowing variation within a mode (e.g. discounting non-major entities and patterns) is one of the ways that permit us to see a bigger picture of a mode.
The following table summarizes the characteristics of the five discourse modes discussed above.

7.2 TENSE AND TEXT PROGRESSION IN IQUITO
In this section, I discuss the structure of Iquito oral texts in terms of the discourse modes. Following Smith (2003), I use the linguistic correlates associated with each discourse mode to explicate the discourse mode pattern in Iquito. I further add languagespecific grammatical correlates that occur in each discourse mode to demonstrate how each mode is manifested. In addition, I also include factors such as stress and intonation, audience and the surrounding setting in the discussion. Two oral texts are used as detailed case studies in this section; the first one is a narrative entitled How I Used to Live Down River (§7.2.1) and the second one is a traditional tale entitled The Story of the Moon (§7.2.2). In §7.2.3, I conclude, based on nearly twenty-one texts134 from the ILDP text collection, that four modes (i.e. Narrative, Description, Report, and Information135) from Smith’s (2003) list were found in the Iquito texts. This is not to say that Argument mode does not exist in Iquito texts. Perhaps it is due to the contexts and the cultural tradition of the oral texts of Iquito that Argument mode, which includes controversial facts and projections, does not appear in the existing texts. In the appropriate context, it might still emerge. The other possible reason that I have not encountered passages of Argument mode might have to do with the fact that Iquito is a moribund language. The Iquito language is not used on a daily basis and, therefore, naturally there is no political discussion or similar topics. Most of the conversations carried out by the speakers occurred during the recording sessions. In addition to the four modes mentioned above,
134 Through personal communication with Chris Beier, the text coordinator of the ILDP, she confirmed that “the ILDP has a collection of more than ninety unique recorded ‘texts,’ documenting the Iquito language…yielding a total of about twenty-two hours of audio and/or video recordings” and that “seventy of the texts have been either completely or partially transcribed and translated, either by hand or as electronic documents; twenty-one are ready for publication.” 135 Information Mode is found in instructional texts, such as Cómo Hacer Chacra ‘How to Establish a Vegetable garden,’ Cómo Hacer Masato 1 ‘How to Make Manioc Beer 1,’ and J++tarata canatanii in++si ‘How to Weave a Hammock’.
468

Quoted Speech in Iquito, especially the direct quotes136, manifests an interesting mixture of modes with distinct language-specific grammatical correlates, interpretation of tense, and subjectivity. However, since it is currently only found embedded within a larger Narrative mode in Iquito and might as well be found embedded within other modes in the future, I discuss, in this dissertation, the interesting aspects of its properties, but presently I am not proposing it as an independent, separate, mode. Smith (2003) does not specifically discuss quoted speech, and does not include Quoted Speech as a separate mode. This might have to do with the fact that features of quoted speech might, to some extent, be predictable. For example, deixis (e.g. pronoun and space) shifts to that of the character because the speaker utters the sentence as if he were the character. However, since, in Iquito, quoted speech does exhibit different grammatical correlates and tense interpretation, it is worth discussing these interesting findings.137 Although I do not specifically include a conversational text in this section, conversations (such as text 3 in Appendix 2) contain all four proposed modes—passages of narration, description, report and information—and quoted speech, as a mixture of modes.
7.2.1 How I Used to Live Down River
In this oral text (as text 2 in Appendix 2), the speaker Ema Llona Yareja talked about her life when she lived down river long time ago. She used to live there with her husband before he passed away. Her brother lived there at the time when this text was recorded. Among the four speakers who all display distinct traits of style, Ema is the one
136 I am currently observing some variations of direct quotes. Direct quotes in conversational texts seem to be accompanied by the reportive markers. 137 In Smith’s class in Fall 2005, Marie Harnisch, a former classmate, wrote a course paper based on the text Saasaaquiicuaa Iiyuu ‘The Powerful Man of the Purge Saasaaquiicuaa’ and proposed Quoted Speech as an independent mode. Smith gave positive comments at that time. Harnisch’s (2005) work, however, did not propose a detailed outline in terms of interpretation of tense in Quoted Speech and did not include Information in her findings.

who generally tends to give sentences of patterns of events instead of specific events. She also often repeats. As such, in her narration the narrative time does not constantly advance because most of the sentences are generalizing statives; instead, it advances only at a few important points, manifesting a Narrative Mode with many instances of Report or Description modes in between. In this current oral text, narrative time advances twice. Once is when her husband passed away, which is also the same time when she got tired of living there. The second time is when she moved upriver. Below I discuss the text in more detail.
The beginning line of the text is in Report mode. The tense is deictic with RT1138 the same as SpT, reflecting the temporal perspective of the narrator. The aspect is imperfective, indicating an ongoing or immediate-future139 event. The first grammatical person refers to the narrator and the second person refers to the researcher who was recording the story, establishing a connection between the narrator and the audience. This sentence constitutes its own mode also because its content is not related to that of successive sentences.
001 Qui=saaqu++nii-yaa-Ø quiaja Don Leo. 1S=tell-IPFV-EC 2S Mr. Leo I am going to tell you, Mr. Leo.
Lines 2-7 are the first major narrative passage in this oral text. Lines 2-3 are the first sentence which functions to establish an RT based on which the following event sentences advance the narrative time. As the first sentence of a narrative passage, the
138 The subscript number next to RT is consistent with the line number in the oral text. 139 Imperfective Aspect can only receive an interpretation of immediate future when combining with Extended Current Tense. Please refer to §3 for discussion on tense and temporal interpretation and §5 for discussion on aspect.

tense is related to SpT and is not anaphoric with the previous discourse. We can designate reference times of this sentence as RT2 and RT3, the time when she lived with her husband and the time she lived very well respectively. RT2 < SpT because this is the first sentence of the narrative passage and the tense and RT interpretation is deictic; RT3 = RT2 due to the Imperfective Aspect.

003 qui=iiqui-yaariqu+ suhuaata. 1S=live-DPST.IPFV well I lived well.

Lines 2-5 are a small descriptive passage with locatives. The RT of the tense in lines 3-5 is anaphoric to the previous discourse. The narrative time does not advance. Time is static due to the stative sentences expressing patterns of events instead of specific events; however, the scene moves from her house (line 4; RT4 = RT3) to her vegetable garden (line 5; RT5 = RT4). It is interesting to note that the tense choice in line 5 is Extended Current Tense. There are two possible reasons. First, the deictic center of the tense shifts and here anchors with the RT of the previous sentence. Second, it is also possible that she does still have a vegetable garden downriver at the time of recording this story, in which case, this will be a sentence of Report mode (RT5 = SpT) within a larger Narrative mode.

Line 6 is a perfective sentence, expressing a bounded event. The narrative time advances so that the time when her husband passed away is after the time when they lived together (RT6 > RT5). Line 7 again is a perfective sentence, expressing RT7 > RT6, meaning the time when she came from there to here is after the time when her husband died. The tense choice from line 2 to line 7 is basically distant past tense, which means the deictic center of the tense is still SpT. In terms of the temporal interpretation of narrative time of these sentences, however, the advancement is based on the perfective sentences in sequential order, conveying a continuity pattern, the spirit of Narrative mode. This is distinct from the deictic pattern (e.g. Report mode) in which the order of the sentences does not represent the sequential order of RT. Instead, the specific RT of the sentences is related to SpT and relies on tense and the temporal adverbial which anchors to SpT.

Lines 8-17 are another major narrative passage which is in fact a repetition of the first narrative passage. Lines 8-15 are a descriptive passage within the larger Narrative mode. Line 8 talks about the same unbounded events as line 2, so RT8 = RT2. Lines 8-15 consist of stative sentences expressing patterns of events. The order of sentences only represents traversing the path (between the house and the field) in the scene and does not advance the narrative time. The RT is anaphoric, meaning all the sentences share the same RT (i.e. RT9 = RT8, RT10 = RT9, RT11 = RT10, RT12 = RT11, RT13 = RT12, RT14 = RT13, and RT15 = RT14).

Line 16 is a perfective sentence and so is line 17. Therefore, RT17 > RT16 in which the time when she came outside from there is after the time when she got tired of living there. Line 17 and line 7 talk about the same event (RT17 = RT7) and supposedly the preceding events share more or less the same reference time (RT16 = RT6). Again, lines 8-17 are a
474

larger narrative passage because the order of lines 8-15, in relation with line 16 and line 17, represents a sequential order in time and their interpretations of RT build on previous discourse and are related to each other.

Lines 18-21 are the concluding passage in the Report mode. The interpretation of RT is related to SpT. The sentences consist of a series of states. Subjectivity is maintained by mentioning the narrator’s brother. Line 18 serves as a bridge between the modes. Because the sentence talks about the same situation as that in line 8 and line 2, the three reference times are the same (RT18 = RT8 = RT2). The connection between line 18 and line 19 is the location. Line 19 depicts that the narrator, at the present time, still has plants at the same location. Line 20 extends what she has to items other than plants. In line 21, the narrator’s brother is introduced and concludes this oral text. The RTs of lines 19-21 are deictic because they rely on SpT.

7.2.2 The Story of the Moon In this oral text (as text 1 in Appendix 2), the speaker Jaime Pacaya Inuma
narrates a traditional tale, a tale shared among the speakers as part of their cultural knowledge, about how the moon was created. It is believed by the Iquito people that a long time ago there was no moon and it was dark in the night, until a person who had committed adultery went up to the sky for his error. He turned into the light of the moon and lighted up the sky from then on. Jaime often prefers to give specific events in his narration. As such, the narrative time advances constantly. He also tends to use the evidential reportive marker =na with Distant Past Tense, maintaining the deixis of tense choice at SpT instead of presenting a shifted deixis although he does shift the deixis in Quoted Speech. Many interesting points can be observed from his narration: variation within Narrative mode, the interaction between the reportive marker and discourse modes, and usage of reportive markers in Quoted Speech and other contexts. I discuss the text in more detail below.

477

The beginning line of this oral text sets the temporal background of the entire story. The tense is Distant Past Tense and the aspect is Imperfective Aspect. Because it is the first line which lacks any previous discourse, the interpretation of RT is related to SpT (RT1 < SpT), reflecting a deictic pattern. The Imperfective Aspect in this sentence indicates an unbounded situation, meaning that RT is overlapping with SitT which is the lifespan of the man in the narrative. This first sentence indicates that the events in the following narration occur within this time interval unless additional information overrides this. This first sentence is not considered to be in Report mode for several reasons. First, the content is directly related to the following discourse. Second, the narrator does not use any deictic grammatical person to identify himself, entering an impersonal mode immediately. This is further confirmed by the use of reportive marker =na as well as iiyaiinana,140 which indicates the perspective is objective and not subjective, in Smith’s terms. The use of the reportive marker often corresponds to second-hand information rather than first-hand information.

Lines 2-14 are a descriptive passage that shares the same RT which is within the
RT1 span set up in the first line. The RT in this passage is the earliest time point in comparison with the RT in the following discourse context. The RT of the tense in each
sentence is anaphoric to (i.e. the same with the RT of) the previous sentence. The
narrative time does not advance because the stative sentences express patterns of events

instead of specific events. The scene moves from one part of his life to another part, giving an overview of this person’s life, his habits, and the architecture in his time. It is interesting that in line 2, the sentence contains perfective aspect, expressing a bounded event in which he met/married a woman. However, the following sentences containing Imperfective Aspect give rise to the same RT interpretation as if the sentence means ‘he was married to a woman.’ Smith (2003) talks about this coercion effect and states that this is due to the influence of a tacit durative adverbial posited from the context at the beginning of a descriptive passage. The other possible explanation is the view that this sentence containing perfective aspect provides a temporal bound through the expression of a bounded event. The following sentences containing Imperfective Aspect have their RT overlapping with this interval (i.e. RT2 ⊆ RT1; RT3 = RT2; RT4 = RT3; RT5 = RT4; RT6 = RT5; RT7 = RT6; RT8 = RT7; RT9 = RT8; RT10 = RT9; RT11 = RT10; RT12 = RT11; RT13 = RT12; RT14 = RT13). The passage is in Description mode and not Report mode not only because the tense conveys an anaphoric pattern, but also because the deictic adverb tíira ‘there’ does not reflect the narrator’s deixis in its interpretation, but it is anaphoric with the location indicated in the previous sentence.

Starting from line 15 to the end of the text, almost every line represents a specific bounded event and advances the narrative time. The RTs of each clause are dependent on

the previous discourse and are related to each other. The entire oral text (lines 1-43) is in Narrative mode because the ordering of sentences from lines 2-14, as a block, to line 15 and the following lines represents a sequential order in time which is the spirit of Narrative mode. Between line 15 and 43, only a few lines do not advance the narrative time: the first clause of line 16 does not advance it because it is a repetition of line 15; line 18 does not advance it because it pertains to the same clause as line 17; line 23 and 24.2144-29 are Quoted Speech; line 37 is Quoted Speech as well; lines 42-43 are descriptive sentences. Interestingly, Quoted Speech in Iquito seems to emerge as an interesting mixture of modes and collectively takes an anaphoric pattern for the interpretation of tense. Below I discuss the lines in more detail.
Line 15 contains a perfective bounded event and advances the narrative time (RT15 > RT14 = RT2), indicating that the time the woman grated huito is after the time of sleeping with her son-in-law.

The first clause of line 16 is a repetition of line 15, so the narrative time does not advance. The second clause of line 16 advances the narrative time. So, after grating huito, she placed it somewhere for use in the night.

She grated it. She placed it somewhere for the night.

Lines 17 and 18 pertain to the same clause and advance the narrative time. The time the man came again to bother her is after she had already placed huito for the use in the night.

Line 23 is Quoted Speech. Quoted Speech seems to emerge as an interesting mixture of modes in Iquito due to distinct linguistic correlates. It is similar to Description mode because its RT is anaphoric to the previous discourse: in this case, the time when line 23 is uttered by the character is the same as that of line 22 in which his brother talked to him. It is different from Description mode, however. Instead of progressing spatially from one scene to another, Quoted Speech progresses only because speech itself progresses. Collectively, Quoted Speech passages in Iquito do not advance narrative time in a larger Narrative mode. The time is static and stays the same as the previous RT of a narrative sentence. Furthermore Quoted Speech in Iquito amazingly does not contain a reportive marker for the direct quotes cited here145 and tense always has shifted deixis to the previously established RT. According to Smith (2003), a passage of a particular mode consists of at least two sentences. However, so far in Iquito, I posit Quoted Speech as always being its own passage even if there is only one sentence. The criterion for this depends on whether the RT of the following sentence advances. For example, the following lines, 24.2-29, are Quoted Speech as well. While one might tend to group lines 23-29 as a passage of Quoted Speech with the exception of line 24.1, the best option is to
145 Direct quotes in conversational texts seem to be accompanied by the reportive markers.
484

group line 23 and line 24.1 each as its own passage and lines 24.2-29 as one passage. The reason is that in line 24.1, RT advances. Therefore, the RT of lines 24.2-29 and that of line 23 do not coincide.

The first clause of line 24 is in Narrative mode and advances the narrative time. The tense deixis shifts back again to the narrator’s deixis. The RT builds on the previous discourse (RT24.1 > RT23). From the second clause of line 24 to line 29 there is Quoted Speech again. All the features discussed for line 23 apply here as well: shifted deixis, anaphoric tense (RT24.2 = RT25 = RT26 = RT27 = RT28 = RT29), speech progresses, no reportive marker.

Lines 38-41 are in narrative mode and each line advances narrative time once. The surprising fact is that even though lines 38-39 are not Quoted Speech, the deictic reference of tense does not shift back immediately to that of the narrator. It shifts back in line 40.

147 The nature of iiya is still under investigation. So far, it seems to function parallel with iina as irrealis reference. 148 The discourse particle atiíja introduces a bounded event that anchors to the RT of previous discourse.
488

Following Smith (2003), two sentences of the same mode can be considered a passage in that mode. Lines 42-43 are in Description mode with anaphoric tense and spatial advancement, concluding this oral text.

7.2.3 Discourse Modes in Iquito
In this section, I discuss the discourse modes manifested in oral texts of Iquito,
based on the study in §7.2.1, §7.2.2,149 and some procedural/instructional texts, including
Cómo Hacer Chacra ‘How to Establish a Vegetable garden,’150 Cómo Hacer Masato 1
‘How to Make Manioc Beer 1’ and J++tarata canatanii in++si ‘How to Weave a
Hammock.’ Of the five modes proposed by Smith (2003), Narrative, Report, Description,
and Information are manifested in the Iquito texts. Argument mode is so far not found
(i.e. there is also no distinct grammatical correlates which indicate Argument mode) in
the ILDP text collection at this point. Perhaps in a future text, Argument mode might
emerge in the appropriate context. In addition, Quoted Speech emerges as an interesting
mixture of modes in Iquito because it demonstrates distinct linguistic correlates. Three
modes (i.e. Narrative, Report and Description) and Quoted Speech passage consist of
eventualities, are temporally organized and can be located in time. Information mode is
atemporal and cannot be located in time. The text in Information consists of fact and
statives, and advances along with metaphorical motion or change of metaphorical
149 Although the oral texts featured here, How I Used to Live Down River and The Story of the Moon, are relatively short, they display three modes (i.e. Narrative, Report, and Description) plus the passage of Quoted Speech. This finding in general categories corresponds to Harnisch’s (2005) conclusion based on a longer text Saasaaquiicuaa Iiyuu ‘The Powerful Man of the Purge Saasaaquiicuaa’. The details on the grammatical correlates and the analyses in this dissertation, however, are quite different from those in her study. In addition, this dissertation proposes to add Information mode to the list of modes manifested in the Iquito text. 150 The English titles of the texts are translated by the author of the dissertation.

location. In the following, I discuss each mode in terms of the grammatical correlates (i.e. reportive markers, shifted deixis of tense and deixis of other terms, such as pronouns and adverbials which conveys subjectivity), temporal advancement/text progression (i.e. temporal/spatial or metaphorical order of sentences), anchor of RT and pattern of tense function (i.e. deictic, anaphoric or continuity).
Narrative mode in Iquito, corresponding to Smith (2003), conveys primarily a continuity pattern and a limited anaphoric pattern. This is consistent with the finding, as shown above in table 19, that Narrative mode may consist of smaller passages of Description mode and Quoted Speech passage, which convey an anaphoric pattern. After the first sentence, the interpretation of RT depends on that of the preceding sentence, and is not in accordance with SpT. This is to say, tense is not interpreted as deictically related to SpT; rather, it is interpreted as related to tense in other clauses and RT advances with each bounded situation. The order of sentences represents the sequential temporal order of events. In Iquito, Narrative mode has the following grammatical correlates. The reportive markers =na, =iiyaiinana and =quiana are used, expressing objectivity instead of subjectivity (i.e. this largely corresponds to second-hand rather than first-hand information). The use of reportive markers accompanies impersonal deictic terms. For example, there are no instances of first person pronouns referring to the narrator himself and the deictic adverbs such as ‘here’ and ‘there’ do not anchor to the narrator’s spatial deixis. Of course, this grammatical correlate also has to do with the kind of content the narrator is providing. If he were talking about personal experiences, there will be no reportive markers and deictic terms will anchor to his deixis. In this case, I might argue that the text contains heavy components of Report mode, while still with narrative temporal advancement. Smith does not specifically discuss the difference between narrating personal experience and non-personal experience and the variation in terms of
493

subjectivity. Finally, tense deixis in narrative is in general very consistent and Narrative rarely has shifted deixis of tense. Shifting might occur, but prevailingly before and after Quoted Speech, functioning as a bridge for a change of mode.
Report mode conveys a deictic pattern of tense. This is to say, the interpretation of RT and temporal advancement always depend on tense and deictic temporal adverbials, which are related to SpT instead of anchoring to the preceding sentence. The order of sentences only represents an advancing SpT and does not reflect the temporal order of events. Report expresses the reporter’s personal perspective, temporally and spatially. In Iquito, Report mode does not contain any reportive markers. This accompanies personal deictic terms. For example, first person pronouns refer to the reporter himself and the deictic adverbs such as ‘here’ and ‘there’ anchor to his spatial deixis. Report mode in Iquito text expresses the narrator’s standpoint, establishes the connection between the narrator and the audience and relates the content in the story to current settings. The tense deixis of Report always anchors to SpT and therefore does not have shifted deixis of tense.
Description mode conveys an anaphoric pattern of tense, in which the interpretation of RT is the same as that of the previous discourse. Time in Description mode is static, without dynamism. The situations in the passage share the same RT. As such, text does not advance temporally; rather it progresses spatially as the description moves from one part of a scene to another. The order of sentences corresponds to a path being traversed in the scene. Like Narrative mode, Description mode in Iquito generally contains reportive markers and deictic terms are impersonal with the narrator absent in the scene. As mentioned above, I allow some variation in terms of subjectivity within the mode of Narrative and Description as this is what Iquito texts suggest. Description mode in general does not have shifted deixis of tense.
494

Quoted Speech in Iquito distinguishes itself as well as mixes with other modes due to grammatical correlates as well as a distinct combination of features. In passages of Quoted Speech, deixis of tense always shifts to the previously established time. No reportive markers are used. In addition, the first person pronoun is also used, reflecting a personal perspective. However, this personal deixis is not the narrator’s, but the character’s. In Quoted Speech, the narrator speaks for the character as if he were the character in the story. Quoted Speech, in terms of some features, is similar to Description mode: First, RT is anaphoric to the previous discourse; second, time is static within a larger Narrative mode. Quoted Speech is also similar to Report mode: First, it does not contain reportive markers151, expressing subjectivity; second, the deixis is personal, reporting from the standpoint of the character; third, the order of sentences represents an advancing SpT. Finally, Quoted Speech is similar to Narrative: First, the sequential order of sentences represents the temporal ordering these sentences as they are uttered by the character; second, time is static in Quoted Speech in terms of a larger time point/interval of Narrative (i.e. the interval within which the content is said or heard), but it advances within its own stretch of time if we view sentences in Quoted Speech as subevents of a larger event (i.e. [say]) in Narrative. However, one crucial difference between the temporal advancement of Narrative and that of Quoted Speech is that Narrative advances due to bounded events while Quoted Speech advances because the speech itself progresses, reflecting the ordering of Report mode. Because RT within the Quoted Speech is related to the speech time of the character instead of the narrator, its RT interpretation has no direct connection with the main stream of RT within the larger Narrative mode. I propose the following schematic diagram for the tense pattern in Quoted Speech within a larger Narrative mode. I assume E2: x say y. Esay.1 represents the
151 Direct quotes in conversational texts seem to be accompanied by the reportive markers.
495

first subevent of [say], Esay.2 represents the second subevent and so on. As suggested in the last line of the diagram, RTQS within Quoted Speech is not related to RTsay within Narrative at all, and the relation between RTQS and SpTQS depends on the tense choice within Quoted Speech.

Information mode conveys a deictic pattern of tense: the choice of tense conveys deixis as tense anchors to SpT; therefore it does not have shifted deixis of tense. Information mode is atemporal and cannot be located in the time of the real world. The order of sentences represents the traversing of a path in a metaphorical domain; text progresses in a metaphorical domain, instead of a temporal or spatial domain. Text progresses as the Primary Referent of the sentences metaphorically moves or changes. Information mode contains entities of (in general) uncontroversial facts and statives. Information can be subjective (i.e. expressing facts generalized from personal
496

experiences) as it could contain second grammatical person marking and other deictic terms with the narrator as the deictic center. In addition, it does not contain any reportive markers. However, in Information mode, the narrator is in general not strongly present as no first person pronouns and spatial terms such as ‘here’ are included. Below are a few excerpted sentences from the text J++tarata canatanii in++si ‘How to Weave a Hammock.’ The organizing principle is chronology. However, the events described cannot be located in the time of the real world.

From the discussion above, we see that the grammatical correlates, including reference of grammatical persons, the use of reportive markers, deixis of tense and adverbs, and viewpoint aspects associate with each discourse mode. Therefore, they also serve to signal the transition/shift from a given mode to another. For instance, in the beginning of a passage in Description mode, a new RT or durative adverbial, or a locative adverbial, usually appears. In addition, the sentence switches to Imperfective Aspect. In the beginning, or even before, of a passage in Quoted Speech, the tense deixis shifts to the previous RT. The pronoun deixis also shifts, with the first person being the speaking character and the second person being other characters within the story. The reportive marker ceases. Notably, the tone of voice of the narrator also changes, as though he were carrying on a real conversation.
Besides temporal advancement in the narration, we notice the particle =iiyaiinana throughout the text The Story of the Moon. Instead of signaling the advancement of
499

narrative time, this particle serves to advance the foreground information, highlighting the foreground scenes in the story. The virtual line connecting all the instances of this particle shows how foreground information progresses. This observation leads us to another question: foreground vs. background. One interesting concern, as mentioned before in §7.2.2, is that sometimes a single sentence or clause of a distinct mode appear, surrounded by another mode. For example, line 23 and lines 24.2-29 of The Story of the Moon is Quoted Speech while line 24.1 is a clause in Narrative mode because it advances narrative time. Likewise, lines 30-36 are in Narrative mode, with one descriptive sentence, line 33, mixed in between. This line does not advance narrative time. One approach to see this phenomenon of insertion is to view it as a shift in discourse mode. However, as an alternative offered in Smith (2003), instead of treating this as a shift in discourse mode, we can hold the view that the primary mode is the foreground discourse while the inserted clause or sentence is the background discourse. One of the correlates of this is that its discourse mode is distinct from the surrounding discourse mode. Strikingly, this view coincides with the use of the particle =iiyaiinana. While preceding and following sentences, although not immediately preceding or following, might carry the particle =iiyaiinana, these inserted sentences, line 24.1 and line 33, do not begin with this particle, signaling that foreground information is not embedded in these sentences. This section provides an interesting study of Iquito text in terms of the discourse modes and the progression of text, including narrative time as well as foreground flow.
7.3 TEMPORAL CONNECTIVES In this section, I explore a set of temporal connectives, emerging from the study
of texts, that relate to the sequence, grouping and progression of events: jaa, jaari, atií, atiíja, atiíji, atiíjija, j++ticari, huaari, jahuaari, iyácari and iiyaiinana. They are difficult
500

to distinguish by means of translation and will be discussed in pairs, in many cases, to facilitate the comparison.
The temporal connectives, jaa and jaari, grammatically considered to be adverbials, are both often glossed as ‘already.’ However, they are distinct in terms of the type of situation they associate with as well as the relation between the situation referred to and RT. Jaari focuses on the final point of a bounded event and relates it to a given RT (SitT < RT), with a conceptually observable discontinuous period of time separating the two. That is to say, the bounded event precedes RT with a greater conceptual distance than that introduced by jaa. The particle jaa, on the other hand, focuses on the initial point of a situation, bounded or unbounded, and relates it to a given RT (SitT < RT or SitT = RT). If a bounded event is being related, such an event is viewed as immediately preceding RT; if an unbounded event is being related, such an event is viewed as starting immediately preceding RT. Jaari cannot be used with Imperfective Aspect, indicating an unbounded situation. The notion discussed above is schematically represented in the following.

501

The following excerpt from the texts (Saasaaquiicuaa Iiyuu ‘The Powerful Man of the Purge Saasaaquiicuaa’: lines 131-134) illustrates the use of jaari and jaa. In line 131, the event of [he start grate the root] introduced by jaari begins a while before RT. Then, the narrator follows the entire event, reporting time points of each subevent. In line 134, upon realization of the event [he put it on the patio], the narrator reports it using jaa.

134 Jaa nu=inata-qui-Ø pacaricu nu=jina. already 3S=put.on-PFV-EC patio 3S=LOC He has already put it on the patio. 502

The particle jaari ‘already,’ since it combines with perfective situations, always advances the narrative time in the text. Besides the properties of temporality, jaari and jaa can only be used in affirmative sentences and are ungrammatical in negative contexts, therefore patterning as Affirmative Polarity Items.
The temporal connectives atií and atiíja, both often glossed as ‘then’ or ‘there,’ are grammatically the same. They convey anaphoric time or location according to the previous discourse. Spatially, the event in a given sentence containing these particles takes place in the same location; temporally, the event in such a sentence has its SitT overlapping with that of the previous discourse. If the sentence contains perfective aspects, the event in the sentence is considered as a subevent of a larger event. For example, in line 132 of the text above, the event [he grate it] shares the same location with the event [he begin grate his root] in line 131. The sentence contains perfective aspects, but the event therein can be considered as a subevent of a larger event [he grate the root]. The temporal connectives atiíji and atiíjija, often glossed as ‘from then’ or ‘from there,’ on the other hand, signal change of location spatially from the previous sentence or temporally discontinuous/separation of events. This means a sentence containing atiíji and atiíjija indicates events considered as new events from the previous discourse. Temporally, the event in such a sentence does not have its SitT overlapping with that of the previous discourse. The following examples from the texts illustrate the discussion here. The first text is from J++tarata canatanii in++si ‘How to Weave a Hammock’ (lines 3-12).153 In line 4, which contains the particle atiíjija, the event, [you dry this grass], takes place in a different location from that of line 3, [you cut the grass].
153 I include all the excerpted lines together in one chunk because later in the section when I discuss other temporal connectives, I use examples from the same texts as well. The cited texts were transcribed by various members of the ILDP, but is re-segmented, organized and translated by the author of the dissertation.
503

In addition, they are considered separate events which might not follow each other immediately. After cutting the grass, you need to bring it home. Before drying the grass, you might be too tired and have to first rest. Both bringing it home and taking a rest make up a major portion of time; this can also be seen from the irrealis mood (i.e. SXV word order) in line 4, signaling that the event should take place at least later in the day of the event in line 3. In line 5 which contains atiíja, the event [the grass dry] obtains in the same location as that of the event [you dry the grass] in line 4. In addition, the Imperfective Aspect also indicates the overlapping SitT of the two events. Lines 6-9 contain a sequence of events of twisting and weaving. Line 10, which contains atiíjija, signals that the event in line 9 concludes a major event and line 10 starts a new event. As such, ‘making handles’ is considered as a separate event from ‘making the main part of the hammock.’

The temporal connective j++ticari, glossed as ‘when,’ establishes a specific RT. This RT in the text is either different from the previous RT or a specific RT if within the interval of a previous RT. When this particle accompanies an advancement of narrative time depends on grammatical aspect. Perfective aspect advances narrative time while imperfective aspect does not. In the text J++tarata canatanii in++si ‘How to Weave a Hammock,’ lines 5, 7, 9 and 11 contain j++ticari ‘when.’ Each line introduces a new RT, the time point of ‘when the grass is dry,’ ‘when it’s twisted,’ ‘when you finish weaving’ and ‘when the arms are already twisted.’ This particular text is procedural. Each time
511

point might not be located in real time; however, the particle j++ticari in these lines advances a metaphorical time line. In the text Cómo Hacer Chacra ‘How to Establish a Vegetable garden,’ lines 1, 7, 13, 14, 19, 23 contain j++ticari ‘when.’ Each line introduces a new RT, the time ‘when the field is burned,’ ‘when everything is planted,’ ‘when everything including Sachapapa is planted,’ ‘when the yuca plant is already growing nicely,’ ‘when many months already passed,’ and ‘when nine months has passed since the yuca plants started growing.’ In the text Cómo Hacer Masato 1 ‘How to Make Manioc Beer 1,’ the lines 11, 15, 21 each introduces the time ‘when the manioc dough is watery,’ ‘when it’s strong,’ and ‘when it’s fermenting.’
The temporal connectives huaari and jahuaari, often glossed as ‘that moment’ or ‘at that moment,’ are grammatically the same and only reflect dialect variation. The speaker Ema uses the term huaari while the rest of the speakers prefer jahuaari. The terms huaari and jahuaari indicate an RT anchoring to the previously introduced RT, typically accompanied with j++ticari ‘when.’ Whether it presents an overlapping or a sequential situation with the previous discourse depends on grammatical aspect. The following examples are from the excerpted texts: Lines 6 and 8 in J++tarata canatanii in++si ‘How to Weave a Hammock’; lines 15, 20, 21 and 24 in Cómo Hacer Chacra ‘How to Establish a Vegetable garden’; and lines 12, 16, and 22 in Cómo Hacer Masato 1 ‘How to Make Manioc Beer 1.’ In addition, line 17 (excerpted below) in text 2 in Appendix 2 provides an example in point. The moment of ‘I came out’ is anchoring to the moment ‘when I had got tired of living there.’

The terms iyácari and iiyaiinana are only used in a context and time which is outside the scope of the narrator’s personal experience. The term iyácari, glossed as ‘historical now’ anchors to the time established in the narrative context. For example, in the text Iimi saaqu++ni icuani iina iiquiaariqu+na naquim++nijata ‘The Story of a Man who lived with a Female Spirit,’ the term iyácari is modified by maacatuuhua ‘ancestors.’ Therefore it indicates that the time the narration is about is the time of the ancestors, which is also the time when the character in the story lived. The term iiyaiinana, often glossed as ‘like this’ and sometimes translated as ‘one day,’ is also only used in traditional or historical narratives. As discussed in §7.2.2 and §7.2.3, it has a reportive function as one of its grammatical components. However, it more serves to specify and highlight the foreground character, scene or topic. It presents a line along which the foreground information progresses or changes. Its presence, instead of advancing narrative time, advances the foreground of the storyline. Corresponding to this observation, we find it often appears at the beginning of more specific historical events which could be translated as ‘like this, one day….’ In the text Iimi saaqu++ni icuani iina iiquiaariqu+na naquim++nijata ‘The Story of a Man who lived with a Female Spirit,’ lines 8, 12 and 14 each highlights the important information the narrator wants the audience to pay attention to. Also refer to the discussion in §7.2.2 about the storyline of the text ‘The Story of the Moon.’

7.4 CONCLUSION In this chapter, I expanded the scope of study from independent sentences to
stretches of sentences at the passage level. Tense and temporal interpretations of single/independent sentences are deictic: this is the default way to determine the temporal location of a situation which is based on the perspective of the speaker and is oriented to SpT. Smith (2003) proposes five discourse modes manifested at the passage level: Narrative, Report, Description, Information and Argument. Narrative mode conveys continuity patterns of tense; Report, Information and Argument convey deictic petterns; Description conveys anaphoric patterns. I conclude that four modes (i.e. Narrative, Description, Report and Information) from Smith’s (2003) list are manifested in Iquito texts, although Argument might still emerge in a future text. In addition, I propose Quoted Speech as an interesting mixture of modes. Later in the chapter, I discussed the major temporal connectives relating to sequence, grouping and progression of events and their implications in the text, including jaa, jaari, atií, atiíja, atiíji, atiíjija, j++ticari, huaari, jahuaari, iyácari and iiyaiinana.

Appendices
APPENDIX 1: EVENT QUANTIFICATION In many languages, event quantification is expressed through productive
morphology. In Iquito, however, it is conveyed through a set of synchronically unproductive derivational verbal morphemes, including -s++, -juu, -cuu, -tii, -yuu, -yuucua, among other morphemes with rarer frequency of usage. Structurally, these morphemes suffix directly to the verbal root and before the causative and other derivational morphemes which precede inflectional morphemes. Currently only very few words containing the derivational morphemes discussed here occur with great frequency in natural speech. The derivational morphemes in these cases encode serialization of multiple (i.e. mass number in this case) events conveyed by the verbal root. As their synchronic generalized meanings, these derivational morphemes are related with event quantification (i.e. patterns of frequency or habituation), spatial distribution, serialization, degree of endeavor and distributive events of multiple subjects. The meanings conveyed by these derivational morphemes are prevailingly expressed through the use of adverbials, in which case the presence of the derivational morphemes is not obligatory.
The derivational morphology discussed here is diachronically productive, but not synchronically productive. When the meaning of a combination of a verbal root and the derivational morphemes were asked for, only -s++, -juu and -tii were given synchronically generalized meanings, all of which are optional and can be expressed by adverbials or other devices. The derivational morphemes -cuu, -yuu and -yuucua, among other morphemes, are only observed with specific verbal roots as lexicalized roots. Within the lexicon of items that occur with derivational morphemes with great frequency, the following phenomena are observed. First, some irregular roots appear in the
515

underived and in the derived verbal forms which suggests that the derived verbal stems appear to be lexicalized after the derivational morphemes attach. Second, some verbal stems which display apparent derivational morphology do not seem to have a direct correspondence, in terms of their meanings, with their underived forms. Third, several apparently derived verbal stems do not have their corresponding underived forms. These phenomena support the observation that the derivational morphology is not synchronically productive although people can provide an interpretation when given a derived form.
In section 1, I discuss the lexicon which contains the relevant derivational morphemes and occurs with great frequency in the natural speech. In section 2, I discuss the generalized meanings of the derivational morphemes synchronically.
1. Derivational Morphemes in the Lexicon This section presents the lexicon which contains the relevant derivational
morphemes and occurs naturally (i.e. produced by speakers). The words in this section are gathered from the Iquito Dictionary, Text Collection, and the elicitation sessions, with the definitions confirmed and explained by the speakers. First, I present a table containing the infinitival forms of underived verbal roots (i.e. used for expressing the countable number of events), infinitival forms of derived verbal roots (i.e. used for expressing the mass number of events), local Spanish gloss and English translation. Later I discuss the observations made from the data presented.

In the following, I discuss the observation made for each derivational morpheme presented above. The derivational morpheme -s++, although there are only four instances in the dictionary, is one that has its generalized synchronic meaning as the frequentative, yet non-serial, occurrence of a given event. It can be seen from the table that the lexicalized forms which contain -s++ convey serialization of events, with several occurrences of events in a row. The derivational morpheme -juu has its generalized synchronic meaning as a cumulative diminutive which conveys a series of continuous events performed in a diminutive fashion. This will be discussed in detail in section 2. From the twenty-one lexicalized forms presented in the table, it can be seen that they generally convey one of two meanings: first, cumulative serialization; second, verbal diminutiveness, such as the verbs amanijuutaani, asaajuutaani and picujuuni. Therefore, the generalized synchronic meaning seems to combine the two meanings conveyed by the lexicalized forms. The derivational morpheme -tii has its generalized synchronic meaning as distributive events of a collective subject, which conveys distributive simultaneous events performed by a collective plural subject. The meaning encoded by the lexicalized
521

form in the table is either serialization of punctual verbs or the frequentative of State verbs.
The derivational morphemes -s++, -juu and -tii discussed above are three morphemes that can be freely combined with verbal roots. Other morphemes discussed below cannot be freely combined with verbal roots and hence do not have synchronic general meanings. The words containing -s++, -juu or -tii all have their underived forms as part of the Iquito lexicon. The meanings of the underived forms and the derived forms also generally correspond to each other in terms of the basic verbal root. Two exceptions exist in words which contain -juu. In the pairs of words, saminiini ‘preparar’ (ENG: prepare) > saminijuuni ‘pensar’ (ENG: think), and amaniini ‘matar a varios’ (ENG: kill several entities) > amanijuutaani ‘dar golpesitos muy suaves a un bebé para que duerma’ (ENG: to pat gently on the back of a baby to facilitate his sleeping), the meanings of the underived forms and the derived forms do not seem to relate to each other directly. In addition, the underived forms and the derived forms which contain -s++, -juu or -tii have identical base forms. One exception exists in the case of -juu, cuhuasiini ‘hablar’ (ENG: to speak) > cuhuarijuuni ‘hablar sin parar por un largo tiempo’ (ENG: to speak continuously for a long time) and one exception exists in the case of -tii, asiyaani ‘pisar’ (ENG: to step on, kick) > asimatiini ‘pisotear’ (ENG: to step on or kick many times). The combination of the above-mentioned phenomena suggests that the derivational morphology of -s++, -juu and -tii is not a synchronically productive one and that the morphology of -juu and -tii might be older than that of -s++. This is also supported by the fact that speakers can interpret forms with -s++ following either -juu or -tii. Collectively, the morphology of -s++, -juu and -tii is a relatively more recent one in comparison with the morphology of other morphemes to be discussed below.
522

The derivational morpheme -cuu cannot freely combine with verbal roots synchronically. Therefore, the twelve words in the table are the only words which can appear with -cuu. The lexicalized forms presented in the table convey serialization of events in general. Three out of the twelve pairs of words provided in the table have an indirect meaning mapping between the underived forms and the derived forms: amaniini ‘matar a varios’ (ENG: to kill several entities) > amanicuutaani ‘golpear algo repetidamente contra algo’ (ENG: to hit something repetitively against something), jimuuni ‘enterrar’ (ENG: to bury, fill in the gap) > jimuucuuni ‘llorar para un muerto para anunciar su entierro’ (ENG: to cry for a dead person to announce his burial), and ruruuni ‘ladrar’ (ENG: to bark) > ruruucuuni ‘gritar’ (ENG: to meow, shout). One derived form, tamacuuni ‘moler una soga del monte por torcerla repetidamente, generalmente con el fin de hacer la soga más flexible’ (ENG: to grind a rope from jungle by rubbing it repetitively, generally resulting in making the rope very flexible), does not have a corresponding underived form. One pair of words does not have an identical phonological shape in their roots: tahuataani ‘huequear’ (ENG: to poke through) > tahuaracuuni ‘perforar algo repetidamente’ (ENG: to perforate).
The derivational morpheme -qu++ also cannot freely combine with verbal roots synchronically. The nine words listed are the only words which contain -qu++ with the meaning of event quantification. The lexicalized forms presented in the table convey the serialization of events. One interesting point to be noted is that they are mostly intransitive verbs, with only one exception: apáraaqu++ni ‘tocar o palpar varias veces’ (ENG: to touch or pat many times). The following two pairs of words especially demonstrate the middle voice alternation between -cuu vs. -qu++ and -juu vs. -qu++: tamacuuni ‘moler una soga del monte por torcerla repetidamente, generalmente con el fin de hacer la soga más flexible’ (ENG: to grind a rope from jungle by rubbing it
523

repetitively, generally resulting in making the rope very flexible) vs. tamaqu++ni ‘torcerse varias veces’ (ENG: to be twisted by itself many times), and nirijuuni ‘cagar a cada rato’ (ENG: to defecate all the time) vs. niriqu++ni ‘cagarse, mogrentar a ensuciar su proprio cuerpo’ (ENG: to defecate on oneself). In addition, two of the nine words do not have an underived form: cunitaqu++ni ‘hacer patarashca’ (ENG: to make patarashca) > tamaqu++ni ‘torcerse varias veces’ (ENG: to be twisted by itself many times).
The derivational morpheme -nuu cannot freely combine with verbal roots synchronically. The three words listed, hence, are the only words with the meaning of event quantification. All of them convey the serialization of events. One interesting point to be observed is that they are all transitive verbs with the meaning of specific instruments and implied result states: ijanuuni ‘picar varias cosas uno después del otro’ (ENG: to spear many things one after another), sajinuuni ‘cortar varias veces’ (ENG: to cut many times with machete), and siquinuuni ‘molestar con dedo o palo’ (ENG: to bother something all the time with finger or stick).
The derivational morphemes -n++, -nihui and -niqui all have one example for each of them in the dictionary. They convey the serialization of events. Interestingly, the derived form which contains -n++, sim++n++ni ‘buzar agua varias veces’ (ENG: put one’s head in the water many times), is an intransitive verb which appears to be part of the middle voice alternation pair, but synchronically, there is no sim++nuuni. The derivational -yuu and -yuucua both have very few words containing them and cannot freely combine with verbal roots synchronically. The verbs which contain -yuucua are notably Motion verbs in general. The verb muriyucuaani ‘rujar’ (ENG: to roar) does not have a corresponding underived form synchronically and the word has come to encode both a countable and a mass number of events depending on the specific adverbials and inflectional morphemes, as shown in the following.

2. Generalized Synchronic Meanings156
In this section, I discuss the following three points: first, the generalized
synchronic meanings of the derivational morphemes -s++, -juu and -tii; second, the
equivalent adverbials used to express them or the relevant syntactic conditions; and third,
their structural position with respect to other derivational and inflectional morphemes
156 This section embraces more diversity in terms of acceptability and interpretations of sentences. Therefore, I include the relevant recording information (i.e. elicitation, date, speakers and linguist) when such varieties present themselves. The following format and abbreviations apply: E=elicitation; six digits of date, representing two digits, each, of day, month and year; ELY=Ema Llona Yareja; HDC=Hermenegildo Díaz Cuyasa; IWL=I-Wen Lai; JPI=Jaime Pacaya Inuma; LII=Ligia Inuma Inuma.
525

within the verbal complex. One important point to be noted is that most of the sentences in this section which contain the derivational morphemes -s++, -juu and -tii are interpretable by the speakers, but were not produced spontaneously by the speakers. When asked for equivalent meanings, sentences with adverbials (i.e. without the derivational morphemes -s++, -juu and -tii) were produced most of the time. Only in rare cases were sentences with the derivational morphemes -s++, -juu and -tii produced. Most of the sentences in that case contained lexicalized uses of the verbs as presented in the above section.
The derivational morpheme -s++ has its generalized synchronic meaning as the frequentative, yet non-serial, occurrence of a given event. Actual interpretations include habitual events and frequentative events in spatially distributive locations. Speakers were able to give different interpretations in different elicitation sessions for the same sentences presented. The speaker Ema gives frequentative distributive readings preferably over a period of time than on a single day. The speaker Jaime gives habitual reading most of time, but indicates that there also can be a frequentative spatially distributive reading. The speaker Hermico gives both habitual and frequentative distributive readings. The speaker Ligia gives both readings as well. She is also the only speaker who cannot accept the combination of a few verbal roots with the derivational morpheme -s++. All four speakers produced sentences with adverbials without the derivational morphemes and indicate that the frequentative morpheme is not required if an explicit relevant adverbial appears in the sentence.
In the following, I provide examples of the verb asaani ‘eat.’ Example (1041) is a sentence which contains the underived form of the verb.

(1041) Nu=asa-a-Ø

núquiica páapaaja. 526

3S=eat-IPFV-EC one fish He is eating a fish.
When presented with the following sentence, the speakers gave different interpretations as indicated. The meanings (1042)a and (1042)b are habitual; (1042)c is a frequentative spatially distributive reading. The speaker Ligia cannot accept this sentence at all.
(1042) Nu=asa-s++-yaa-Ø páapaajaa. 3S=eat-FREQ-IPFV-EC fish a. He eats fish everyday. (E.190906.JPI.IWL) b. He eats fish three times a day. (E.220906.HDC.IWL) c. He is eating fish many times in different places. (E.190906.JPI.IWL) (E.230906.ELY.IWL) (E.220906.HDC.IWL) *(E.091906.LII.IWL)
The habitual reading is, of course, influenced by the grammatical Imperfective Aspect. With the perfective aspect, the reading can only be frequentative or frequentative and spatially distributive within a limited period of time, indicated by the tense or by an adverbial. Note that the perfective aspect is unmarked when following a long vowel, as in (1043).
(1043) Nu=asa-s++-Ø páapaajaa. 3S=eat-FREQ-EC fish a. He ate fish many times today. (E.190906.JPI.IWL) b. He ate fish three times (as at three meals) today. (E.220906.HDC.IWL) 527

c. He ate fish many times in different places today. (E.190906.JPI.IWL) (E.230906.ELY.IWL) (E.220906.HDC.IWL)
*(E.091906.LII.IWL)

All four speakers gave the following sentence when asked the indicated meaning. It is seen that the frequentative adverbial p+y++ni yahu++ni-jina ‘every day’ is used without the frequentative derivational morpheme -s++.

(1044) Iina caaya p+y++ni yahu++ni=jina nu=asa-a-Ø páapaaja. DET person all day=LOC 3S=eat-IPFV-e fish This person eats fish everyday.

Likewise, the frequentative adverbial sam++ra ‘frequently’ is used without the derivational morpheme.

(1045) Sam++ra nu=asa-a-Ø

páapaaja.

frequently 3S=eat-IPFV-EC fish

He eats fish frequently.

When asked the frequentative spatially distributive reading, the speakers gave the adverbial masiaquiihuacu ‘various place’ and p+y++ni tíhuacu ‘everywhere.’

(1046) Masiaquiihuacu nu=asa-a-Ø. various.places 3S=eat-IPFV-EC He eats in various places. 528

(1047) Nu=asa-a-Ø p+y++ni tíhuacu. 3S=eat-IPFV-EC all place He eats everywhere.

Other adverbials indicating numerous locations can also be used, as in (1048).

(1048) Nu=asa-a-Ø

páapaaja p+y++ni iíta-ca=jina.

3S=eat-IPFV-EC fish

all

house-PL=LOC

He eats fish in all houses.

When asked the interpretation of a sentence containing frequentative adverbials as well as the derivational morpheme -s++, speakers generally have two reactions: 1) with the frequentative/habitual reading, the derivational morpheme -s++ is redundant; 2) the spatially distributive reading is triggered as in (1049) and (1050).

(1049) P+y++ni yahu++ni=jina nu=asa-s++-yaa-Ø

529

In addition, if an adverbial indicating a limited period of time is present, the frequentative spatially distributive reading is also triggered, as in (1051).

(1051) Ácari yahu++ni nu=asa-s++-yaa-Ø

masiaana páapaaja.

3S=eat-FREQ-IPFV-EC a.lot.of fish

(E.180906.JPI.IWL) *(E.091906.LII.IWL) ?(E.230906.ELY.IWL)

In the following, I provide examples of the verb capiini ‘eat.’ Sentence (1052) in the following is a sentence containing the underived form.

(1052) Nu=capi-i-Ø. 3S=cook-IPFV-EC She is cooking.

Pragmatically, the event of cooking is considered a habitual one which should take place every day. Therefore, the following sentence was interpreted as taking place in a spatially distributive fashion, changing to a different place each day. The sentence was also interpreted as a person cooking fairly frequently to an extreme that she or he cooks all the time.

(1053) Nu=capi-s++-yaa-Ø. 3S=cook-FREQ-IPFV-EC a. She cooks in a different place everyday. (E.180906.JPI.IWL) (E.220906.HDC.IWL) (E.230906.ELY.IWL) (E.091906.LII.IWL) 530

b. She cooks frequently/all the time. (E.180906.JPI.IWL) (E.220906.HDC.IWL)

When a sentence containing the derivational morpheme -s++ and an adverbial indicating a single place is provided, the speakers gave the habitual/frequentative reading, as in (1054). However, they all gave and preferred the alternative sentence with the use of adverbials, as in (1055).

(1054) Nu=capi-s++-yaa-Ø

iina=jina iíta.

3S=cook-FREQ-IPFV-EC DET=LOC house

3S=cook-IPFV-EC all

day=LOC DET=LOC house

She cooks in that house everyday.

When the sentence (1056) is provided, speakers gave the reading of ‘cooking in a different place each day’ and explained that usually ‘cooking takes a lot of time so a person normally cannot be cooking in different places on a single day unless she or he is helping a little bit only in each place,’ as in (1057), as ‘if he or she is only directing the cooking,’ as in (1058).

The derivational morpheme -juu has its generalized synchronic meaning as the cumulative diminutive, which conveys a series of continuous events performed in a diminutive fashion. The actual interpretations include: 1) performing an action slower than the rate typically associated with a given verb; 2) performing an action to a lesser degree of endeavor than typically associated with a given verb; 3) dividing the quantity of activities associated with a given verb into small portions and performing the action cumulatively to complete the task. Because of its verbal diminutive meaning, speakers often give examples, using a child as the action performer and commented that this derivational morpheme is for speaking ‘affectionately.’ Speakers were able to give different interpretations indicated above in different elicitation sessions for the same sentences presented. The speaker Ema especially prefers the first (‘slow’) reading. Other
532

speakers prefer the second (‘lesser degree of endeavor’), the third (‘cumulative’) and the ‘affectionate’ reading. It is noted that -juu can be freely combined with most verbs unless this is pragmatically uninterpretable by the speakers. The generalized meaning conveyed by -juu can be expressed by the adverbials macuaarica ‘slowly’ and s++sarica ‘a little.’
In the following, I provide examples of the verb capiini ‘cook.’ Example (1060) is interpreted as ‘cooking slowly’ or ‘cooking in small portions each time, augmenting the food for a single meal.’
(1060) Nu=capi-juu-yaa-Ø. 3S=cook-CUM-IPFV-EC a. She is cooking slowly. (E.230906.ELY.IWL) b. She is cooking in small portions (i.e. in a small pot) many times in order to make enough food for a meal. (E.180906.JPI.IWL) (E.220906.HDC.IWL) (E.190906.LII.IWL) c. A little child is cooking a small portion. (E.180906.JPI.IWL) (E.220906.HDC.IWL)
The speakers commented that the following sentence was heard when they were children; they just don’t use it very often anymore. Their parents usually said this to them upon going fishing. Because waiting for fish could take a long time and is boring, they would sleep continuously, but not deeply, while fishing on the canoe.
(1061) Qui=maqu+-juu-yaa-Ø cáami-rata. 1S=sleep-CUM-IPFV-EC upriver-towards I am going to sleep lightly going upriver. 533

(1062) Nu=rarii-juu-yaa-Ø. 3S=drink-CUM-IPFV-EC a. He is drinking slowly. (E.230906.ELY.IWL) b. He is drinking in small portions many times to finish what he has. (E.180906.JPI.IWL) (E.220906.HDC.IWL) (E.190906.LII.IWL)

The speakers interpret the verb asaani ‘eat’ very similarly to the use in (1062). They were able to produce more sentences as follows.

(1063) Ca=nu=p+ca-a-Ø

atií=yaajaa.

p+y++ni.

3S=eat-CONT-IPFV-EC all

He is eating little by little. (E.180906.JPI.IWL)

The verb muraani ‘dig’ is another good example of the reading ‘to a lesser degree of endeavor.’ The sentence is interpreted as ‘a person is kind of digging, but not digging as deeply as digging is supposed to be done.’

(1067) Nu=mura-juu-yaa. 3S=dig-CUM-IPFV He is digging shallowly.

The derivational morpheme -tii has its generalized synchronic meaning as distributive events of a collective subject, which conveys distributive simultaneous events performed by a collective plural subject. Speakers generally indicate that these sentences do not sound good with a singular subject and they also commented that sentences without the derivational morphemes -tii are more common currently. The speakers Ema and Ligia, in particular, do not like sentences containing -tii, except, of course, in cases of the lexicalized use presented in section 1 above.
In the following, I provide examples of the verb asaani ‘eat.’ Example (1068) is understood as a group of people eating their own food on different tables.

(1068) Na=asa-tii-yaa-Ø. 3P=eat-DSTR-IPFV-EC

(E.220906.HDC.IWL)

Example (1069) with the verb capiini ‘cook’ indicates that a group of people are cooking, each of them having their own stove.

(1069) Na=capi-tii-yaa-Ø. 3P=cook-DSTR-IPFV-EC They are cooking. (E.180906.JPI.IWL) *(E.230906.ELY.IWL) *(E.190906.ELY.IWL)

(E.220906.HDC.IWL)

Example (1070) with the verb sihuan++ni ‘arrive’ was interpreted as a group of people arriving each in their own boat, one after the other.

(1070) Na=sihuan+-tii-yaa-Ø. 3P=arrive-DSTR-IPFV-EC They are arriving.

Example (1071) with the verb ruruuni ‘bark’ indicates that in a collective group of dogs scattered in a place, each dog is barking in its own pace.

(1071) Na=ruruu-tii-yaa-Ø. 3P=bark-DSTR-IPFV-EC They are barking.

536

Example (1072) with the verb ruruucuuni ‘meow’ indicates that in a collective group of cats scattered in a place, each cat is meowing in a distinct voice.
(1072) Na=ruruucuu-tii-yaa-Ø. 3P=meow-DSTR-IPFV-EC They are meowing.
The relative structural positions of the derivational morphemes discussed in this report can be summarized as follows. In the case of lexicalized stems, it can observed that -cuu precedes -tii, -juu precedes -s++, -tii precedes -s++, as illustrated in the following table.

In this section, a set of derivational verbal morphemes related to event qantification was discussed, including -s++, -juu, -tii, -cuu, -yuu, -yuucua, among other morphemes with rarer cases. The derivational morphology discussed here is a diachronically productive one, but not a synchronically productive one. Currently only a few lexicalized words, discussed in section 1, containing the derivational morphemes discussed here, occur with great frequency. The derivational morphemes in these cases encode serialization of multiple (i.e. a mass number in this case) events conveyed by the
538

verbal root. Synchronically (section 2), the combinations of verbal roots and these derivational morphemes, as non-lexicalized derived stems, are interpreted as being related to event quantification (i.e. patterns of frequency or habituation), spatial distribution, serialization, degree of endeavor and distributive events of multiple subjects. They are interpretable, but not obligatorily used. The meanings conveyed by these derivational morphemes are prevailingly expressed through the use of adverbials and other lexical items. The phenomena discussed in this report are interesting for a study of how morphological processes can become unproductive and lexicalized while the speakers can still obtain a general interpretation of the unproductive morphemes.
This appendix discusses event quantification conveyed through a set of synchronically unproductive derivational verbal morphemes, including -s++, -juu, -cuu, -tii, -yuu, -yuucua, among other morphemes with rarer frequency of usage. These morphemes derive new situation types from the basic-level ones. Currently only very few words containing these derivational morphemes occur with great frequency in natural speech. The derivational morphemes in such cases encode serialization of multiple (i.e. a mass number in this case) events conveyed by the verbal root. Synchronically, these derivational morphemes are related to event quantification (i.e. patterns of frequency or habituation), spatial distribution, serialization, degree of endeavor and distributive events of multiple subjects. The meanings conveyed by these derivational morphemes are mostly expressed through the use of adverbials, in which case the presence of the derivational morphemes is not obligatory. Structurally, these morphemes attach directly to the verbal root and before the causative and other derivational morphemes which in turn precede inflectional morphemes.

APPENDIX 2: EXAMPLES OF ORAL TEXTS 1. Introduction
I include three example texts in Appendix 2, which embraces a few varieties of genres: traditional tale, narrative and conversation. These three texts were all recorded in the community of San Antonio de Pintuyacu, Loreto, Peru, in the northern Peruvian Amazon. After they were recorded, the texts were transcribed and translated with the help of Iquito consultants. Since the 25 native fluent speakers of Iquito are all at least 58 years of age, these texts represent the speech of the older generation among the ethnic Iquito group. The traditional and the narrative oral texts were told strictly in Iquito, with the exception of a few loanwords from Spanish. The conversational text present a few incidents of code-switching between Spanish and Iquito.

2. Traditional Tales Text 1 is a story about the origin of the moon. The text does not only deal with
how and why the moon is created; it also beautifully presents the style of the houses in the ancient time and the traditional materials used for body paint.

3. Narratives Text 2 is a narrative of personal experience. The speaker Ema lived in a different
place downriver from the community of San Antonio de Pintuyacu for a long time. In the text, she explains the condition and the quality of life she had when she lived downriver and why and when she decided to move upriver to the current community.

4. Conversation
Text 3 is a conversational text about leaf-collecting and leaf-weaving activities. In mid-August of 2006, Ema Llona Yareja went upriver of San Antonio with her grandson Rubén. They arrived at the post159 of Doña Erlinda, Rubén’s sister-in-law. That working post is on the land of barillal, which is a champoso160 area, full of rotten leaves. Ema stayed there for almost a month to collect the leaves of the irapay plant, which people use to weave the rooves of houses in the Amazon. According to Ema, her house in San Antonio de Pintuyacu was already full of holes. When the ILDP team arrived, from the city, to the community of San Antonio de Pintuyacu on September 16, 2006, Ema was still upriver. She returned to the community on September 20, and the following day this conversational text was recorded. She talked about why and how she had gone upriver, what she had done, and what it had been like to work and collect leaves upriver. There were three participants in this conversation, including two speakers, Ema Llona Yareja and Ligia Inuma Inuma, and the person in charge of recording from the ILDP, Christine Beier. This conversation reflects an important part of daily life of the people in this region.
In the transcription, the left square bracket, [, is used to indicate words simultaneously produced by more than two persons. The parenthesis, ( ), is used for the following situations. First, it is used to indicate a laughing sound or other non-linguistic
159 The word post, puesto in regional Spanish, is used to refer to a hut where people stay when they leave the community to work in the jungle. 160 The word champa in regional Spanish is used to refer to two types of weeds. First, on the land of barillal, the short champa grows (approximately 1 cm.) on the surface of a layer of rotten leaves (approximately 15 cm. above the real soil). Second, champa could also be used to refer to a type of weed that is big (approximately 20~45 cm.). This type grows on top of or near the land of barillal. To refer to an area full of champa weed, the word champal is used in the regional Spanish. In Iquito, the word sasaqu+ is used to refer to these two types of weeds. In addition, the word is also used to refer to the type of land. To refer specifically to the large weed, the phrase tasiíta sasaqu+ ‘real champa’ can also be used.

sounds. Second, it is used to indicate the information, for example, the pause, between the utterances. Third, it is used to modify an Iquito word (i.e. add or delete), according to the speaker’s request, in which case a footnote is also added to note this. Fourth, it is used in the translation line to indicate a meaning that is not expressed in Iquito. The double parenthesis, (( )), is used to indicate the interactions among the conversational participants or information between the utterances.
Below I provide a table specifying the geographical positions and the related activities of the places mentioned in the conversation and in the discussion of this conversation.

Text 3: Conversation about Leaf Collecting and Weaving Activities S++saramaj+táap+ Itim'+ra Cuhuasitaa A conversation among Christine Beier, Ligia Inuma Inuma and Ema Llona Yareja Transcribed by I-Wen Lai (21 of September, 2006)

001 Ligia:Núquiica saáqu++ni. A story.

002 Christine: ++j++. [Núquiica saáqu++ni, iína Ema saaqu'+niiyaa Ligia, Cristina najáaja. Yes. A story, Ema tells Ligia and Christine as well.

004 Ligia:Saáqu+=quiáana161 j+'+tarata quia=iícuacura cáamirata=na. [
Tell us how you had gone upriver, she said.162
Ema: [Ah…
161 The reportive morpheme surfaces as =quiáana after the verb with the unmarked General Perfective Aspect and Extended Current Tense. It surfaces as =na following other elements. It can be used to indicate that the origin of the information is from other people. It can also be used as quotative to quote the exact words used by another person. 162 Ligia explained that this sentence was quoted from Christine because Christine had requested Ema to tell her what had happened before this recording.
552

Ah…

005 Ema: Quí=iícuacura cáamirata huáari=yaajaa163 quia=iícuacura Iquito=jina. [ I went the same164 day when you165 had left for Iquitos.

Christine: [++j++. Yes

006 Ema: Huáari quí=iícuacura cáamirata Rubé=jata. [ That same166 day I went upriver with Rubén.

++j++. Yes.

Christine: [¿Rubén? Rubén?

007 Ema: Nu=aátiaácura quíija, “Iíti ca=quia=paájii=quiáana naám+ taniini=na,167 mama.”168
He was telling me, “Here you cannot weave leaves, mamá.”
163 It is noted that there is a brief pause here, before the speaker speaks the next word. In general, the enclitic =yaajaa surfaces as =yaa if not in the utterance-final position. I consulted the speaker and she indicated that the sentence retains the same meaning if only =yaa is uttered with the pause. 164 The word huáari means ‘the moment of or then’. In this context, Ema translates it as ‘that same day’ because the enclitic =yaajaa is used. The ILDP team leaved for the city on the 15th of August. The same day in the afternoon, Ema, Rubén, Vilton and Géiser, left for the post of Doña Emérita. Doña Emérita, Don Julio, and Don Eduardo were already there. Ema and her people stayed there overnight. The following morning at dawn, they left for the post of Doña Erlinda. 165 Ema directed this utterance towards Christine and not towards Ligia. Christine and other members of THE ILDP left the community that day. 166 Refer to footnote 164. 167 The phrase ‘weave leaves’ here refers to the process of collecting the leaves of the irapay plant from a specific region in the jungle, and then weaving these collected leaves into panels which can be used by the weavers or sold. In this case, Ema wanted to weave leaves to repair the roof of her own house in the community. 168 Rubén is Ema’s grandson, but is like her son because she raised him. Therefore, he often calls Ema mamá.
553

((Rubén’s words to Ema))
008 Ema: “Iícua=quiáana cáamirata=na.” “Go upriver.” ((Rubén’s words to Ema))
009 Ema: “Cáami taa=na iitíca=na naám+. Quí=quia paríjata=quiáana.” “Upriver the leaves are close (to the post). I will help you.” ((Rubén’s words to Ema))
010 Ema: Ca=quí=iícuacura naámirata cas… yáana=jina, Montebello169=jina. I didn’t go downriver to cas(tilla), to that Monte Bello.
011 Ema: “Síipa taa=na naám+ naámi quia=aníitaani=íira=na.” “Leaves are too far to carry.” ((Rubén’s words to Ema))
012 Ema: Cana=sihua…cana=iícuacura ácari j+'+ta, ácari yahu'++ni. Taaríqui cana=iícu170maacura. We ar(rived)…we started off like now, like today. We left in the morning
013 Ema: Cana=sihuaán+r++cura cáami yahu'++ni '+jaqu+ya, We arrived upriver at noon,
169 Monte Bello is a place downriver from San Antonio de Pintuyacu. Ema lived there for a long time before her husband passed away. Her brother, before passing, also lived there. 170 The verb iícua- ‘go’ has an allomorph iícu- when appearing before the Remote Perfective Aspect -maa, which seems similar to the verb iicuu- ‘walk’. In the following, I provide two sentences for comparison: cana=iícumaa ‘I left in the morning’ versus cana=iicuumaa ‘We walked in the morning’.
554

014 Ema: cáami nu-cuniata171 íyacu, Doña Erlinda. [ upriver at the post of his sister-in-law Doña Erlinda.

++j++. Yes.

Ligia: [¿Cáami nu=iíquii? She is upriver?

015 Ema: Cáami nu… cana=ajat+t+'+cura. Cáami=ji nu=an+'+cura canáaja. Upriver she…we anchored. From uphill, she called us.

016 Ema: Cana=nacar+'+yaácura ar++ni cáami=iíra172=yaajaa.173 We wanted go even more upriver.

P´+=tarahuaáju(uyaa). 174 Quináaja…canáaja=na cana=tarahuaájuuyaa=quiáana
madera.
171 The third person pronoun, nu, refers to Rubén. Doña Erlinda is his sister-in-law. 172 Although the phrase cáami=iíra=yaajaa sounds like cáami=raa=yaajaa in the recording, it is noted that a stress is heard on the /i/. After consulting the speaker, she segmented it as written here and explained that the phrase cáami=iíra means ‘more upriver’. 173 The enclitic =yaajaa expresses the insistence of going ‘more upriver’ and emphasizes the meaning of ‘more upriver’. Ema translated this phrase as “even just a little bit more upriver.”
555

“Brother-in-law, don’t go more upriver. Here let’s stay. Let’s work. You all…we are working on the woods.175 ((Erlinda’s words to Rebén to invite all the people on the boat where Ema was))

020 Ema: “Quina=tarahuaájuu=quiáana sacumatáani iína naám+. “You all go to work on the leaves instead. ((Erlinda’s words to the people))

021 Ema: “Masiáana taa=na naám+=na iíti=na, cuniata.” “Here there is a lot of leaves, brother-in-law.” ((Erlinda’s words to Rubén))

022 Ema: Anihua=ácuji cana=iyuújuucura cáami. [

That’s why we stayed upriver there. Yes. We stayed right there upriver.

Christine: [(Laugh) (Laugh)

023 Ema: Cana=cut+t'++r++cura. Nahuaáca tuu na=iícuacura naám+ cataani=ánuura, p+y'++ni.
We woke up (the following day). They indeed had gone to collect leaves, all of them.

174 The words in the parentheses were not pronounced in the recording. After reviewing the recording, Ema added them. 175 The phrase ‘work on woods’ refers to any process from searching and cutting to taking out the woods from the trees in the forest, for one’s own use or for sale.
556

024 Ema: Iíti iíti, naji j+'+ta iíti=ji=na j+'+ta tíira, itíira curi=cúura. Here here, just like from here, they say, to there, there at the port.

025 Ema: Naám+ iitíca[=yaa jaári. The leaves are that close.

031 Ema: S+'+saramaj+taámi carga na=miiyaácura núquiica yahu'++ni=jina. They accomplished three loads of cargo in one day.
032 Ema: Masiáana naám+ cáami. There are lots of leaves upriver.
033 Ema: Iína=iíra, j+'+ta iína=iíra iíta=na,176 masiáana cáami. (The leaves) such as177 for this house, there are plenty of them upriver.
034 Ema: ++j++, cáami cana=iyuújuucura cáami. Yes, upriver we stayed upriver.
035 Ema: Cana=cut+t'++r++cura. We got up.
036 Ema: Yáana Doña Erlinda aátiaácura, That Doña Erlinda was saying (to Rubén),
037 Ema: “¿T++178 taa=raa=na=huaja yáana Clara179=na, cuniata?”
176 The morpheme =na here is not reportive, but is the clause-final marker. 177 Ema makes a comparison between the type of leaves that were used for the ILDP kitchen where the conversation was recorded and the type she had seen upriver. She commented that this type of leaves is everywhere upriver.
558

“Where is, then, that Clara, brother-in-law?” ((Erlinda asked Rubén))
038 Ema: “Naámi nu=iyuújuu=quiáana.” “She stayed downriver.” ((Rubén’s response to Erlinda.))
039 Ema: “Caa=na. Iricuaa=quiáana quia-majáana, nu=nacusiini=íira=na j+'+tarata=na núquiica icuani sujurísiiyaa=quiáana.
“No. Go bringing your wife, so that she knows how a man suffers. ((Erlinda’s words to Rubén))
040 Ema: “Nu=nacusiini=íira, nu=ariini=íira=na naji=na, “So that she knows, so that she says, ((Erlinda’s words to Rubén))
041 Ema: “Iína=na, cana=tarahuaájuuyaa=quiáana quí-níyaaca=jata=na. “Like this we worked with my husband. ((Erlinda’s words to Rubén))
042 Ema: “Cana-sudor taa=na p+y'++ni=na. Nu=nacusiini=íira j+'+tarata=na núquiica icuani sujurísiiyaa=quiáana nuúriqu+ca tarahuajuuni=na.”
178 In the recording, it is heard as written here. However, when I consulted the speaker, she repeated the following sentence: “¿T++ti taa=raa=na=huaja yáana Clara=na, cuniata?” 179 Clara is Doña Erlinda’s sister and Rubén’s wife.
559

“It is both of us’s sweat. So that she knows how a man suffers when he works by himself.”
((Erlinda’s words to Rubén))
043 Ema: “Iricuaa=quiáana. Nu=quia=capinii=quiáana. “Go bringing (her) so that she cooks for you. ((Erlinda’s words to Rubén))
044 Ema: “¿Cán++ca quia-sinaáqu+ siquita=na=huaja?” “Who is going to wash your clothes?” ((Erlinda’s words to Rubén))
045 Ema: Huáari180 Rubé anímaacura taaríqui cáami=ji. That day Rubén came from upriver in the morning.
046 Ema: Nu=irihu++cura Clara,181 nu=irihu++cura nu-asúraaja. He took Clara, and he took the yuca with him.
047 Ema: Na=cut+t´++r++cura, 182 huáari cana=miiyaacura cáami saqu´++ca 183 sacumatáani.
180 Two days after the conversation between Doña Erlinda and Rubén, Rubén traveled downriver early in the morning. While telling the story, the speaker Ema was downriver in the community of San Antonio. Therefore, she used the word aní- ‘come’ instead of iícua- ‘go’. 181 Besides Clara, Rubén also took his baby Felicho and his housekeeper, Mariela. 182 Ema explained that Rubén was away for four days. During those days, yuca was running out. Therefore, they could not make manioc beer then. The fourth day, when Rubén and Clara arrived, they brought with them three bags of yuca. It was already very late when they arrived; therefore, that day they didn’t make the manioc beer either. The following day, after waking up, the women started making the yuca dough. Ema used the word sacumatáani ‘instead’ to say that they made the manioc beer after they arrived instead of before their arrival.
560

They woke up, then we were upriver making the yuca dough (instead of making
it before their arrival).
048 Ema: Míinca cana=miicura cáami. ++j++.
We had minga184 upriver. Yes.
049 Ema: Don Estalia185 aátiaácura, “Quí=iícuaa=quiáana naqui=cúura=na.”
Don Estalio was saying, “I am going to the jungle (for hunting).”
((Don Estalio’s words to the people))
050 Ema: Nu=ámuucura s+'+saramaj+taámi anitáaqui.
He killed three peccary.186
051 Ema: ++j++. Nu=im+'+tamaacura ihuaani. Nu=ámuucura núquiica siquiáaja, umáana
siquiáaja.
Yes. He went again187 early in the morning. He killed a deer, a big deer.
183 To make masato (i.e. the manioc beer) for a minga, first you need to take out two rows of yuca from your vegetable garden, then you peel them, wash them and then cook them. When the yuca is cooked, you grind it in a big container and chew it. You leave the yuca dough in the container to cool down. When the dough is cold, you put it in a bucket and leave it for three days. When it is fermented and bubbles, you filter it and dilute it with water. Now the masato is ready to serve. 184 A minga is a collective, collaborative, work. A family requests other people in the community to help with a task (i.e. clean or cultivate a field, collect or weave leaves, etc.) and invite them to drink masato and eat before and after working. To have a minga, you have to make masato (with two rows of yuca) and two meals (breakfast and lunch at 3 or 4 in the afternoon) for a group of people. 185 Because Iquito does not have o sound in the inventory, they pronounce it as a here. When they do pronounce o, it is considered code-switching in Spanish. 186 There were two mingas mentioned in this conversation. The first one is Rubén’s, in ‘barillal’ where the post of Don Estalio and Doña Erlinda is located (they live principally in the city of Iquitos) and Rubén’s small hut. Rubén had his minga with masato and the three peccaries that Don Estalio killed. The people in the minga include Rubén, Clara (Rubén’s wife), Mariela (Rubén’s housekeeper), Géiser (Ema’s nephew), Vilton (Sonia’s son), Ema, Don Estalio, Doña Erlinda and three people sent by Don Daniel Bartra de Moronilla (see footnote 190). The second minga is Don Edbin and Doña Elicha’s, see footnote 193 and 194.

052 Ligia: ¿Ácusana? [ Colorful?
Ema: [Ácusana siquiáaja. ++j++. A colorful deer. Yes.
053 Ema: Suhuáani tacura iína míinca. That minga is good.

056 Ema: Íimaji189 yáana moronilla=jina=ji…yáana… From downriver, from that Moronilla190…that…
187 After the first minga, Don Estalio went to hunt and killed a big deer. The meat of that deer was only for the family of Don Estalio and Doña Erlinda. It was not for Rubén’s minga. 188 To complete the word, Ema added the part written between parentheses. 189 The word íimaji means ‘from downriver or from inside’. It is used more often to compare two places. The place of Don Daniel Bartra was downriver from that of Doña Erlinda, but still upriver from San Antonio de Pintuyacu where Ema recorded this sentence, which is why she did not use the word naámi ‘downriver’.
562

057 Ema: …Don Daniel Bartra nu-caayaaca iícuacura cáami. …Don Daniel Bartra’s people were upriver.
058 Ema: Mincásii…na…na=mincásiihu++cura cáami. To join the minga, they came upriver to join (Rubén’s) minga.

190 Moronilla is place where the post of Don Daniel Bartra is located. It is more downriver than Doña Erlinda’s. It takes one hour walking from the post of Doña Erlinda to the post of Don Daniel Bartra. 191 The morpheme =na here is the clause-final marker. 192 Although the phrase huárata ámicaáca means ‘the day before yesterday or the day after tomorrow,’ here it is best translated as ‘two days after Rubén’s minga’.
563

064 Ema: naámi193=jina Edbin majáana, huárata ámicaáca tacura nu…nu-míinca cáami. the one who lives downriver, Edbin’s wife, had her minga194 upriver the day before yesterday (from the day of recording).

066 Ema: Na=miiyaácura s+'+saramaj+taáp+ caasíca, núquiica tímaaca. They had three collared peccary and a majás.

067 Ema: Anúu=tacura nu-míinca=iíraana. Iína cana=asámaacura taaríqui. That was her minga.195 We ate that in the morning.

At noon we cooked another (half) of majás with a chicken. (Laugh)

069 Ema: Suhuaá asácap+ canáaja.

Christine: [(Laugh). ++j++. (Laugh). Yes.

193 Don Edbin and Doña Elicha live principally in Monte Carbalio, a community upriver from Saboya. Monte Carbalio is downriver from San Antonio where the conversation was recorded. Therefore, Ema used the word naámi ‘downriver’. 194 The second minga was made by Don Edbin and Doña Elicha (they live principally in the community of Monte Carbalio) in a place called ‘Acamanilla,’ more upriver than Don Estalio and Doña Erlinda. The post of Don Edbin and Doña Elicha is in Acamanilla. They made a minga with a majás, a chicken and three buckets of masato. The people who were in that minga include Don Edbin, Doña Elicha, Don Estalio, Doña Erlinda, Ema, Géiser (Ema’s nephew) and Mariela (Rubén’s housekeeper). The stingray acquirers (see footnote 242) were also there. The majority of the meat from the three collared peccaries was for those three stingray acquirers, not for the minga. The family of Don Edbin kept a portion of meat from the three collared peccaries and their livers. They gave Ema a small piece to taste. 195 See footnote 194 for more details on this minga.
564

We ate well.
070 Ema: Itíniija iíquiaácura s+'+saramaj+taámi balde, j+'+ta iími.196 There were three buckets of masato, like these (big buckets).
071 Ema: Aási, aási=jina, atíira aási aniaácura=yaa naám+ cata=cu=cúura naá. Rain, in the rain, it was raining there where they went to collect the leaves.
072 Ema: Síipa, cuúmi naji aasámuca na=ár++yaa tíira=ánuura. Far away, two little creeks they had to cross from here to there.
073 Ema: Naám+ t++ tíira naji=yaajaa.197 ++j++. There are plenty of leaves there. Yes.

Christine: [¿++? What?
075 Ema: S+'+saramaj+[taámi viaji=na nu=miir++. ¿++?
196 The speaker Ema pointed, with her finger, to the biggest buckets in the kitchen where this conversation was recorded. 197 The enclitic =yaajaa indicates that there are always a lot of leaves there. 198 Ema acquired this information from Rubén.
565

Three trips he is going to make. What?

Ligia: [¿Cáami taa=yaajaa t++ Erlinda iíquii? Upriver where Erlina is?

Ema: [Cáamijiita, suhua=yáana,

more upriver199 than, well that, Acamanilla already.

077 Ema: Iína, iína cacuti p´+=iniyaa tíira ánuura. [ That, that beach where we need to cross on the way there.200

Ligia: [++j++. Yes.

078 Ema: Atií nu=iíquii iína=jina cacuti. Tíira ijácuca, atíira taa nu=tanii naám+. The location on that beach is where he (Don Edbin) is. There on top of the riverbank, there is where he weaves the leaves.

199 Acamanilla, the post of Don Edbin and Doña Elicha, is more upriver than the post of Don Estalio and Doña Erlinda. The place where they went to collect leaves for the minga of Don Edbin was even more upriver than Acamanilla. 200 Ema is trying to describe the distance between Acamanilla and the place where they went to collect leaves for the second minga. If the kitchen where this conversation was recorded were Acamanilla, the beach (i.e. Trinidad’s house, approximately 1 km upriver from the kitchen) would be the place where they went to collect leaves.
566

079 Ema: Cáami.[ Upriver.

[++j++. Yes.

Ligia: [¿Erlinda íimaji, iína201 isámajiita?

082 Ema: Yám+ca na=catacura cúuta iim´+ca. Masiáana naám+. Like this a big square204 they collected, perhaps like here (like the size of the
kitchen). A lot of leaves.

(3 seg)

201 The determiner refers to Don Edbin and Doña Elicha. 202 Don Edbin said to Ema that he will go bringing his people from the community of Monte Carbalio. 203 The word ‘lote’ refers to about 100 panels of woven leaves. Because it refers to a counted quantity of leaves (i.e. not spreaded sporadically on the ground), this word generally includes, in its meaning, the structure with which the woven leaves are piled up. If 100 panels of woven leaves are spread on the ground, in general the word lote cannot be used to refer to the same quantity. I assume it has to do with the fact that when you count the panels, you usually pile them up together. Refer to footnote 264 for information on how to make the construction on which the woven leaves are piled up. 204 Ema is indicating the quantity of leaves they collected. The woven leaves were all piled up and the area these panels occupied was like the size of the kitchen. Ema uses the word ‘vueltito’ when translating the words into Spanish to indicate a square area like the kitchen where this conversation was recorded.

084 Ema: Yáana, quí=iícuacura naám+ cataani ánuura. Well, I went to collect leaves.

088 Ema: ¿Yáana, j+'+tarata t++ Sonia níyini '+yaaca? [ That, what is the name of Sonia’s son?
Ligia: [¿Pitusi?
205 Ema and other people returned to the post of Don Estalio and Doña Erlinda in the afternoon the same day Don Edbin and Doña Elicha had their minga. 206 Géiser is one of Ema’s nephews. He went upriver with Rubén and Vilton, Sonia’s son. 207 Ema indicated that this word between parentheses was a speech error and it does not contribute to the meaning of the sentence.
568

(nickname of Vilton, Sonia’s son)
089 Ligia: [Vilton. Vilton.
Ema: [Vilton. (Laugh) Quí=tújiiyaacura, “++.” Na208=an'+cuuyaacura. Vilton. (Laugh) I heard, “juu.” They were calling (me).

208 Ema went with Vilton and Géiser to collect leaves. 209 When the boys were talking to Ema, they were about 50 meters away from the trail. They could not see her and they told her to wait for them on the trail.
569

094 Ema: Quí=tásiiyaacura amaqu+=jina naá. I was waiting for them on the trail.

Christine: [(Laugh) (Laugh)
Ligia: [++. Yes.
210 Ligia and Ema both explained that the expression cúuta=ji is a affective form of speech. Although I am not familiar with this way of speech, I think it is quite possible that this expression is a calque from local Spanish because both of them told me this expression corresponds to the phrase in local Spanish ‘de verdad, di’ ‘really, no’. 211 Ema pointed with her finger to her own armpit.

Ema: [R+'+ca=jina. On barillal.
101 Ema: Na, yáana, nu=pujutacura naji na=sajiini=iíra nuú.
212 Géiser said this to Ema about what happened. 213 The word ‘barillal’ is used to refer to a type of land where there is a level of rotten leaves above the original soil. Refer to footnote 160 for more details.
571

They, it (the amardillo) curled up its body like a circle (lying down in its nest where it was sleeping) before they cut it (with machete).

Yes. We ate it like a mazamorra216 dish, with plantain. Yes.
214 The other person, in this case, is Vilton because Géiser was the person who told Ema about what happened. 215 The expressions iíti=íiracuma means more or less near here. Ema indicated with her finger and pointed to her own waist and translated the phrase as ‘in its middle’.

216 Mazamorra is a type of thick soup made of plantain or yuca, and meat or fish. 217 The post of Don Daniel Bartra is more upriver from the community of San Antonio, but it is downriver from the post of Doña Erlinda where Ema was. It takes one hour walking on land from the post of Doña Erlinda to the post of Don Daniel Bartra. 218 Every Sunday, the family of Don Estalio and Doña Erlinda travel downriver to the post of Don Daniel Bartra to play ball because there is a big field there for the game.

With Doña Elinda Yes. Her house, in her sleeping hut made of palm223 like
this (with a height).
219 The speaker commented that the form of this sentence is ungrammatical and should be as follows: ¿Quia=maquiaácura iíta=jinacuma? 220 The sentence should be corrected as follows: ¿Quia=maquiaácura iíta=jinacuma? 221 A sleeping hut, made of the leaves and bark of palm trees, is a smaller and simpler house than those in the community. 222 Ema used her hand to indicate a height of about one meter. The people use the bark of a type of palm tree to make an elevated floor in the house.
574

Christine:[Ah. ++j++. Nu-iíte. Ok. Yes. Her house.

223 That is to say, the sleeping hut is a humble rural home. This specific hut has an elevated floor made of palm barks. Usually a sleeping hut does not have an elevated floor. 224 Ema indicates a distance of about 5 meters between the hut of Doña Erlinda and that of Rubén.

Christine: [++j++. Yes.
225 In reviewing the recording, Ema added the part between parentheses to complete the phrase. 226 Ema explained that the balsas always hit the riverbank on a particular point with a particular angle, and sometimes this makes some of the supporting wood rotten or float away. Therefore, they moor the balsa weekly, in this case, every Saturday, to change its direction so that it hits on a different point evenly. 227 In this sentence, Ema started to count the days when Rubén and other people will travel downriver in a balsa. 228 Ema was yawning when he uttered this sentence. 229 The verb ani- ‘come’ indicates that the direction of movement is towards the speaker where the center of deixis is. However, the destination is not necessarily the center of deixis. In this case, Rubén and other people are going downriver, passing the community of San Antonio, to the city of Iquitos two weeks after the recording of this conversational text.

230 The speaker Ema wanted to delete this part of the sentence. 231 A row is a rectangular and large area where the leaves grow. The quantity of leaves in one row is approximately equivalent with that for a load of cargo. 232 The speaker Ema wanted to delet this part of the sentence. 233 The roofs of the houses in San Antonio are mostly made of woven leaves. They get worn out after a few years of use and the holes start to appear.

234 Ema explained that what she had woven was only a lot piled up in her patio. 235 Ligia want to tell Ema that he went to look for her. She also wanted to start talking about her experiences upriver. She repeats the same sentence again in line 143. 236 Ema explained that she could have finished weaving more leaves, but they went to Don Edbin and Doña Elicha’s minga instead, the second minga mentioned in this conversation. Because of that, she lost one day of work.

239 Ligia indicates that she is not responding to Ema. She is only thinking what she could have done with this meat if she were Ema. 240 Ema explained that the collared peccaries were what stingray acquirers requested from Don Edbin. They had given her a small piece to taste. 241 In the second minga, Ema stayed in the post of Don Edbin and Doña Elicha to help with cooking instead of going to collect leaves.

242 A stingray acquirer is a person who travels upriver to buy the stinrays that all the communities obtain and then to sell them. Ema explained that the stingray acquirers had requested Don Estalio to hunt three collared peccaries for them.

243 The speaker Ema added the part between the parentheses to complete the sentence. 244 Ema explained that the word yaquica expresses a short distance, approximately 120 meters, like she indicated in the sentence. 245 Ema was making an example to describe the distance and the direction of collecting leaves. She said that it was like if you start from the riverbank, and continue collecting inland for about 120 meters, until here where the conversation was recorded. Such a long area of collecting is for a load of cargo and is a row. 246 In this sentence, =na is a clause-final marker.

156 Ema: Núquiica sanja, nu=tiitaa iína naám+. [
247 Ema explained that after collecting a row for a load of cargo, you have to bring the leaves back to your post. You return to continue collecting from where you finished the last time (e.g. from the kitchen which is about 120 meters from the riverbank). 248 The trail is a piece of land, the bank of a small creek. A trail stretches on and the term is used to refer to the form of a creek, like the creek near the ILDP center. Ema said that an area like this for collection is a long area. 249 Ema repeated and said that for a load of cargo, perhaps you collect from the river port to here. And later, you have to carry it. The following day you can return to continue collecting. 250 Ema has made an example of temporal deixis here. If you start collecting today, tomorrow will be the second day, and the day after tomorrow will be the third day. Like this, you continue collecting.
584

A trail of creek borders the leaves.
Ligia: [(Sneeze) (Sneeze)

160 Ligia: R+'+ca naám+ í…r+'+ca naám+ íruhuana t++. Leaves from so(ft)…leaves from barillal are very soft.
161 Ligia: Ca=t+=irísina. [ ++j++. Íruhuana t++ naji nuú. Ácanana. They are not hard. Yes. Like this soft are the leaves. And shiny.
251 The word champal is used to refer to an area full of the herb ‘champa’ which grows on the surface of a level (approximately 15 cm.) of rotten leaves above the soil. The leaves fall from the trees and form a soft level, like mattress. This type of land is called barillal. See footnote 160 as well for more details. 252 Ema explained that there is actually no creek and she was making an example. She only meant that the area for collecting leaves is pronlonged like a creek. 253 The pronoun anúu refers to the champal. 254 Ema was talking about the area where the leaves were collected and started to talk about the quality of the leaves.
585

Ema: [Puquina.255 Rotten.
162 Ema: Iína, na=ap++ta256=raa, na=ap++tacura nuú.257 Nu…Nuúrica iriaap+ iína maderaji [nahuaáca, Doña Erlinda. [ Those (leaves), they had left behind, they had left them behind. Doña Erlinda’s people had only brought the wood.258

164 Ema: “Abuela, quiína taa=na naám+=na. Canaraquicuma=na. “Grandmother, here are the leaves. Don’t be shy. ((Erlinda’s words to Ema))
165 Ema: “Yáana, ca=na=nacar++cura=na,259 taa yáana, yáana, Edbinhuaaca.”260
255 Ema indicated that the leaves in the barillal are is really close and easy to collect, but they are very soft, which can only be used for the house and not for sale. Because the leaves are very soft, they break and rot easily. 256 This word is also translated as ‘sobrar’ in regional Spanish, meaning ‘extras’. 257 Ema said that what they had collected was the part that other people didn’t want. Doña Erlinda, her husband, and her sons only took the slender wood, and did not collect the leaves. 258 The word maderaje in Spanish is used for the translation, referring to slender wood. 259 Doña Erlinda said to Ema that Don Edbin and his people had stayed there for a week and did not want to collect the leaves there. After one week, Don Edbin and his people went downriver to Santa María. Ema and Rubén arrived after Don Edbin and his people had left the post of Don Estalio and Doña Erlinda. 260 The word Edbinhuaaca and the pronoun na in the previous sentence are coindexed.
586

“That, they didn’t want. That, that Edbin and his people.” ((Erlinda está hablando a Ema))
166 Ema: Nahuaáca na=iíquiaácura cáami na=jata. [ They (Don Edbin and his people) were upriver with them (Doña Erlinda’s

167 Ema: “Ca=na=nacar++cura=na naám+ nu=cataani, iyámi ácuji taa=na naji, tíhuacu=na [síipaqu+ya=na.”
“They didn’t want to collect leaves because they were spread throughout several locations.”261 ((Erlinda’s words to Ema))
Ligia: [++. Yes.
168 Ema: Icuami, cu=áatiaacura nuú. [ It’s not true, I told her.
Ligia: [++. Yes.
261 The word rareada ‘spread’ was used for translation. It is a synonym of salteada ‘jumped’ or no concentrada en un solo lugar ‘not concentraed in one single place’ in the regional Spanish.
587

169 Ema: Núquiica sanja, iína=tiitaa naám+. [ Along a small creek trail, the leaves continue (to grow).

Ligia: [++. Yes.

170 Ema: ++. ++. Iíp+ tuu icuanihu+ya=na,262 Yes. Yes. They (Rubén, Vilton, and Géiser) indeed being men,

172 Ema: Iína, yáana, Géiser nu=miiyaa naji, jaa naji lote nu=miiyaa. That, that, Géiser has so much, he already has (four) lots.

262 In this sentence, =na is a clause-final marker. Ema said that the men (i.e. Rubén, Vilton and Géiser) who went with her are real men because they could do hard work. The men who went with Ema had collected a lot of leaves, unlike the men with Don Edbin who didn’t collect any leaves.

Ema: [Naám+. Leaves.

181 Ligia: Así como [está viendo donde Jameco? [esa clase se llama [lote. [ Like it can be seen where Jaime lives now? That type of thing is a lot.

264 Ligia explained that the word lot refers to a unit of a hundred counted panels of woven leaves, but including the structure where people pile up and count the woven leaves. To start to make this structure, people prepare two long wooden sticks (approximately 2.5 meters in height and placed about 2 meters apart). They sharpen the ends of these two sticks in order to drill them into and fix them into the soil, about 75 degrees tilted between the stick and the ground, in order to make it durable. On the surface of the soil, people put three sticks lying down, under which people put a stick or a wooden board to form a height and an angle so that the panels of woven leaves do not slip to the ground. On top of the sticks that are lying down, people put the panels against the two fixed standing-up sticks. People put the panels on the wider side (the side that has a 105 degrees angle between the stick and the ground). A structure of this type can hold up to one hundred panels. Sometimes, the two sticks are not well fixed and people would put two wooden boards against them to support the sticks better.

265 The word curarina is the name of a plant from which people make remedies. People pull the entire plant, discard the leaves, and then grind the stem. People boil the ground powders with hot water. When the water turns green, they remove it from the fire and let it cool down. People drink 1 to 2 large glasses (500 ml each glass) on an empty stomach. It is taken to induce vomiting, after which the fever and the illness retreat completely.

268 Ligia wants to do a minga, but she doesn’t have sufficient food to make it happen. 269 In the Amazon, there is no clear distinction between the seasons. In general, the people use the word ‘spring’ to refer to the Spring Festival. This year (i.e. the year 2006), the party is on September 23, after the date of recording. Ligia indicated that after this party, Lacho will do the indicated work.
595

206 Ligia: Tarií=yaajaa cana=miicura nuú [j+'+ticari tacura tasiíta sasaqu+.275 Before we did it when there was even big champal plant.
270 Ligia was thinking about Lacho when she said this sentence. She explained that she was not responding to Ema. 271 Ligia just seeded her field in the beginning of September. When she recorded this conversation, yuca had only been planted for two weeks. 272 In the recording the word samaa was heard. According to Ligia, that was a speech error influenced by Ema’s word sasaqu+ ‘champal’. Ligia indicated that she wanted to say tamaa ‘in vain’. 273 Tamaa or tamaayaaja is considered a frustrative adverb in Iquito. 274 Ema uses the word sasaqu+ to refer to the land where there grows a lot of short champa. Ligia explained to me that in a real barillal area, only this type of short weed would grow and no other plants can grow; therefore, Ema thought Ligia’s land was of this type. Also refer to footnote 160 for more detail. 275 Ligia indicated that land was full of tasiíta sasaqu+ ‘real champa’ which is larger in size. Her land was not a real barrillal (i.e. only short champa grow); therefore, she still cultivates the land for planting.
596

Ema: [¿Ácari=huaja? ¿Ácari=huaja? And now? And now?

276 Ligia wanted to say the word malagüera in regional Spanish. She wanted to delete this syllable from the sentence. 277 Here I provide the definition from the Iquito dictionary of THE ILDP: Malagüera a alguien, dicho de cosas o animales que por su presencia o sonido presenta un malagüera (e.g. macuuhua) que afecta a alguien, que por lo tanto indica que algo mal va pasar a la persona que presencia la malagüera.

Ligia: [++j++. Iína=jina [ajaána, nu=suriiyaa iyarácata.
Yes. This summer, the sun is strong and the field is done fast.280
278 The original translation in regional Spanish is the word purma. I provide the definition from the ILDP dictionary: una chacra vieja y abandonada, donde el monte ha vuelto crecer. It indicates an old and abandoned field where all kinds of plant begin to grow again. 279 A jullo means a group of about ten people who clean the field (i.e. cut and eradicate it) together. A piece of land that can be cleaned with a jullo of people is very small in size.
598

215 Ligia: Naji iína maquína [máquisi. Such as a green purma field. Ema: [++j++. Yes.
280 When the sun is strong, the cleaned field dries especially fast and weeds do not return. When the cut and eradicated plants are dry, the field is burned clean before any vegetable plant is seeded.

Vita
I-Wen Lai was born in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, on September 20, 1976, the daughter of Chin-Sung Lai and Mei-Chu Chan. She graduated from National Kaohsiung Normal University (Taiwan) in June 1998 with a B.A. in Chinese and received an M.A. in Applied Linguistics from Indiana State University in May 2001. In August 2001, she entered the Graduate School of The University of Texas at Austin to study Linguistics, with a specialization in descriptive and documentary linguistics. Since then, she has studied Mayan languages and participated in the Iquito Language Documentation Project (the ILDP). She received an M.A. in Linguistics in May 2006. She received a dissertation grant from the ILDP, funded by the Endangered Languages Documentation Programme, London, to conduct fieldwork on Iquito, an endangered Zaparoan language spoken in the northern Peruvian Amazon. She has been a teaching assistant and an assistant instructor of undergraduate-level linguistics courses. She has presented and published a number of articles on the linguistic structure of Iquito, including “Realis and Irrealis Distinction in the Iquito Language (Zaparoan)” in The (forthcoming) Proceedings of Chronos 8 (The 8th meeting of Chronos: International Conference on Tense, Aspect, Mood, and Modality); “Lanegación clausular en iquito” in The Proceedings of CILLA II (Second Conference on Indigenous Languages of Latin America); “Conditionals and Counterfactuality in Iquito” in The Proceedings of CLS43 (The 43rd Annual Meeting of the Chicago Linguistic Society); “Temporal Interpretation in Iquito” in The Proceedings of LSJ134 (The 134th Meeting of the Linguistic Society of Japan).
