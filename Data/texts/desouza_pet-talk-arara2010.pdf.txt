ABSTRACT The Arara people of Para, Brazil, as a whole, are remnants or survivors of some larger Cariban groups who descended from the headwaters of the upper Xingu to the mid and low areas of this river by the beginning of the nineteenth century. Now they live in three different villages: Maia, Cachoeira Seca and Laranjal. The present thesis aims to describe thirteen different ludlings or “play languages” that elderly Arara people from Laranjal know and sometimes use in talking to pets. Play languages are linguistic forms that are purposely manipulated at some level. The strategies which the Arara people use to manipulate the base language to form their ludlings are the addition of affixes and/or certain phonological modifications, such as copying vowels, nasalization, murmur, and lateralization of flaps. The addition of affixes may trigger some phonological processes, such as vowel deletion and haplology. In addition to the ludlings, an informal sketch of Arara phonology is presented as part of the background for the discussion of the “language games”, as well as a brief overview of Arara grammar.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
This thesis describes thirteen different play languages, or ludlings,1 that elderly Arara people sometimes use in talking to pets. The use of play languages among the Araras is decreasing, and only elderly people know them. The Arara language is spoken in the state of Pará, Brazil. The data presented here were collected during several years, starting in November, 1982, in the Posto de Vigilância 1, and later, starting in 1994, in the village of Laranjal, under the auspices of the Summer Institute of Linguistic (SIl) and the Brazilian non-governmental organization Associação Linguística Evangélica Missionária (ALEM).2 Scientific names for plants and animals were collected from different sites on the internet, usually with a picture of each type or species. Arara proper names used in this thesis are from the Arara language (not borrowed from Portuguese).
The strategies that Arara people use to manipulate the base language to form their ludlings in talking to pets are the addition of affixes and/or some phonemic modifications, such as copying vowels, modifying vowels, nasalization, murmur, and lateralization of taps. The addition of affixes may trigger some phonological processes, such as vowel truncation and haplology.
1 For a discussion of this term, see Section 4.1. 2 In 2010 I collected supplementary data following the Institutional Review Board (IRB) policies, under the University of North Dakota (UND), using an Informed Consent document, which was signed by me and by the Arara language resource person.

This thesis consists of four chapters. Chapter one is an introduction where I present the purpose of the thesis and how it is organized. Chapter two presents general information about the Arara people, including a short history of their group. Chapter three presents an overview of Arara phonology, as well as a brief overview of Arara grammar. In the phonological section some phonological phenonema are discussed in prose with no formal representations; in the grammar section, there is a brief sketch that describes grammatical structures of the language that are pertinent to the discussion in the remainder of the thesis. Chapter four deals with word game data and includes the meaning and purpose of the ludlings, presentation of the data, and a summary of their phonological behavior. Closing the thesis, there is a small conclusion section. In addition to this, there are five Appendices: the first one shows contrast among consonants in Arara; the second one presents contrast among vowels in Arara; the third one presents a summary charts of the ludling data forms in isolation or in simple syntactic constructions; the fourth one presents transcriptions of ludlings that were recorded in sentential contexts; the fifth one presents a table for flora and fauna with terminology in Arara, English, Latin (scientific names), and Portuguese.
The Arara data are written with the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Narrow Phonetic transcriptions are shown inside square brackets, while more abstract representations are sometimes shown in slashes and sometimes without any such marks. By abstract representation, I mean any representation that is not phonetic. I do not always intend these to signify an underlying representation, since I will use slashes for various purposes. For example, the same stem can have different abstract forms: /ibɯ/ or /ip/ ‘to take a bath’, depending on what is being presented. Since stress usually falls on the last
2

syllable of the word, it is not marked in the Arara examples, except in the section about stress (3.1.4).
With this thesis, I document these interesting language games that are very typical of Arara culture. As far as I know, there is very little documented information about any similar ludlings among the other indigenous people groups in Brazil. One of them is about the Palikur people, from the state of Amapá, northern Brazil, written by Diana Green (1998), from the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL, Brazil). In her paper she comments that there is a ludling using a reversal strategy in the Guarani language of southern Brazil. Finally, I hope that the Arara people, once aware of studies like this, will continue to use these ludlings in their culture.
As a preview of what is coming later in chapter 4, here are few ludling forms: [paɾu] ‘water’, but [palugu] ‘water (talking to a capuchin monkey)’. In this ludling, they add the infix /-ɡV-/ to the base word, and change /ɾ/ into [l]. Another example is [wɔt] ‘fish’, but [idiwɔt] ‘fish (talking to a titi monkey)’. In this ludling, they add the prefix /idi-/ to the base word. Finally, [eduet] ‘hammock’, but [ẽdũẽt] ‘hammock’ (talking to a howler monkey). In this ludling, they nasalize the vowels of the base word.

CHAPTER 2
GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ARARA PEOPLE
Various unrelated ethnic groups with unrelated languages in Brazil are referred to as “Arara” by outsiders, including Arara-Karo, from Rondônia,3 Arara of Acre,4 Arara of Mato Grosso,5 and Arara of Pará.
This thesis is a study of the language of the Arara of Pará, a Cariban language (Rodrigues 1986; Meira 2006), ISO 639-3 code aap. These people, as a whole, are remnants of some larger Cariban groups who came down from the headwaters of the upper Xingu to the mid and low areas of this river by the beginning of the 19th century (Souza in progress). They now live in three different villages: Maia, Cachoeira Seca and Laranjal. People living in Maia do not speak the Arara language anymore, only Portuguese.
Maia is located on the Xingu River, below the city of Altamira. The residents have had contact with the Juruna people since the 19th century, with whom they merged as one
3 The Karo language belongs to the Ramarama family, of the Tupi linguistic stock (Rodrigues, 1986). They are located in the southern area of the Lourdes creek, in the State of Rondônia (Gabas Jr., Nilson. www.institutosocioambiental.org.br/pib/epienglish/karo.shtm – accessed on July 19, 2008). Its ISO 639-3 code is arr (Gordon 2005). 4 Also called Apolima-Arara, whose speakers live along the Humaitá River, a tributary of the Tarauacá river, in the state of Acre. The speakers come from different ethnic groups, including Chama, Amoaka, Santa Rosa, Arara and Jaminawa (Padilha, Lindomar. www.amazonlink.org/amazonia/culturas_indigenas/povos/apolina_arara.html – accessed on July 19, 2008). The ISO 639-3 code is mcd (Gordon 2005). 5 Other names for this language are Arara do Beiradão and Arara do Rio Branco. Its ISO 639-3 code is axg. The language is almost extinct (Gordon 2005).

ethnic group, as well as with other Brazilian citizens. In the late 1990s, they were recognized as a separate people by the Fundação Nacional do Índio (FUNAI), the Brazilian federal entity that manages indigenous affairs in the country. The residents of the other two Arara villages still speak the Arara language. These villages are located along the left bank of the Iriri River, the largest tributary of the Xingu.

The Arara people living in Laranjal were contacted by FUNAI during two different periods of time: 1981 and 1983. The group contacted in 1981 had fifty people and the other one only twenty. The Arara living in Cachoeira Seca were contacted by the same governmental agency in 1987. They numbered about thirty people. These Arara people as a whole call themselves [uɡɔɾɔŋ'mɔ], which is the first person inclusive pronoun. The morphological structure of this word is: [uɡɔ'ɾɔ] (first person inclusive) and [-ŋmɔ] (plural) (Souza 2004). Thus, some of them translate the meaning of their autonym as just nós in Portuguese (“we” in English).7
There are about 335 speakers of Arara living in the villages of Laranjal (about 250) and Cachoeira Seca (about 85). According to my research (Souza in progress), people from these two villages were separated from each other around 1925, when there was a conflict between them on a place along the Iriri River called Cachoeira Grande, close to the mouth of this river, and not very far from Laranjal village. An advocate for the indigenous cause named Afonso Alves da Cruz told me (p.c. 2004) that one day he was traveling in a motor boat along the Iriri River with an Arara family from Cachoeira Seca, and as they were passing by Cachoeira Grande, a woman in the boat, who was the oldest woman from Cachoeira Seca at that time, cried out: “I know this place! It was here that my people separated themselves from the Laranjal people! Piput (the oldest man from Laranjal at that time) was very small! I remember it!” She pointed out that when this happened she was about the same age as a girl from her family, who was six years old. Through an examination of Piput’s teeth, dentists from FUNAI estimated the year of his birth as 1922. Since he was not able to remember that story, he would have been three years old or less at the time of the event.8
7 The first person exclusive pronoun is [tʃimna]. 8 I thank Afonso Alves da Cruz for his long discussions with me about Arara ethnohistory. Without his

Some languages related to Arara are Hixkaryana, Apalaí, Wayway, Makuxi, Taulipang, Waimiri, Atroari, Kuikuro, Bakairi, and Ikpeng (Txikão), among others. By comparing descriptions of these languages (lexicon and morphology) it is possible to state that the closest one to Arara is Ikpeng (Rodrigues 1986).9
My first contact with the Arara people from Laranjal was in November 1982. At that time my wife and I spent four months in Posto de Vigilância 1. Between November and December 1986 I spent a month with three young Arara men at this same Posto de Vigilância. Only in 1987 were my wife and I able to start having regular interaction with them. Since that time we have spent several months of every year among the Arara people. During these periods of time, we began studying their language and culture, developed a practical alphabet for writing the language, helped to start a school among them, helped them acquire medicines, helped protect their territory, helped them acquire canoes and sewing machines, and established a nursery for fruit plants and trees such as mahogany to help in their food and money resources, etc.
Only twice was I able to visit people from Cachoeira Seca: the first time by invitation from an anthropologist who was doing studies for the Cachoeira Seca’s area demarcation, and the second time by the FUNAI’s chief in the Cachoeira Seca village, Afonso Alves da Cruz. I stayed in the village for one week during each trip. However, my main research has been among the Arara from Laranjal. Thus the ludling data I present in this thesis were collected among the Arara living in Laranjal, the only sub-group where these ludlings have been attested.
knowledge, my studies about these people would have many gaps. 9 I have personally collected comparative data from some of these languages, including Makuxi, Kuikuro, Bakairi and Ikpeng. These data have not yet been published.

CHAPTER 3 THE ARARA LANGUAGE

3.1 A Brief Overview of Arara Phonology 3.1.1 Phonemic Inventory
The Arara language has twenty-two phonemes: sixteen consonants and six vowels.

A. Consonants

A phonemic consonant chart, used as a basis for systematic transcription, is shown

below with the sixteen consonants.

Glottal (h)

In order to confirm the consonant phonemes of the language, I show contrast

between some of them in Appendix 1 at the end of this thesis. Of these sixteen

consonants, two of them occur rarely: the voiceless bilabial trill [ʙ̥] and the glottal

fricative [h]. They occur in a very specific phonological environment. For example, the

voiceless bilabial trill occurs in expressive words.10 In addition to that, it occurs only in

10 Expressive words resemble ideophones, but have a larger scope of meaning, as can be seen in the examples in (1).

8

onset position. Furthermore, it only occurs before the vowel [u], which is always

followed by an alveolar or palatal consonant. The trill does not occur in proper names.

All seven of the words in which it occurs are given in (1) below:

(1) a. [ʙ̥utekeni] b. [ʙ̥utakeni] c. [ʙ̥ut ʙut] d. [ʙ̥uta] e. [ʙ̥uta ʙuta] f. [ʙ̥uʧak] g. [ʙ̥uʧik]

‘Orion’s belt, Pleiades’ ‘small and round cultivated field’ ‘an insect’ ‘to throw away’ ‘rolling on the ground’ ‘to shoot an arrow’ ‘to miss a target/aim’

The glottal fricative occurs only in coda position but never word-finally and, like the

voiceless bilabial trill [ʙ̥], is always followed by a coronal consonant, also in a very

specific phonological environment. It is present in only four words in the normal

language, but also occurs in proper names.

(2) a. b.

[mɯhna] [muhtɔ]

c. [kahtaɾat] d. [niahnia] e. [muhtahta]

f. [mohtidi] g. [ʧahʧa]

‘there further’ ‘over there’ ‘fire caterpillar’ ‘a banana’ ‘proper name for a man’ ‘proper name for a man’ ‘proper name for a woman’

For these reasons [ʙ̥] and [h] are placed within parentheses in the consonant chart.

They are excluded from further discussion in this section. It is also worth mentioning that

a few expressions sometimes include two implosive stops that are otherwise never used

in the lexicon: [ɓ] and [ɗ].11
(3) a. [ɓɔh] b. [ɗah ketkɔ]

‘(s/he is) lying down in a hammock’ ‘sit downǃ’

Because of their specific occurrence in special expressions, they are not included in

the Arara phonemic inventory.

11 The only exception in the whole Arara language is [ɓak keni] ‘hoe’.
9

In normal speech, the voiced bilabial and alveolar stops have an optional lenis

realization intervocalically: [β] and [d]̆ ,12 respectively. Here are some examples:

(4) a. [mɔβɛ] b. [aβat]

‘a fruit’ ‘manioc bread’

(5) a. [idă ɾa] b. [oudɔ̆ ]

‘fly’ ‘big traditional house’

There is no such realization for the voiced velar stop /ɡ/. In additon to this lenition

process, there are restrictions on the occurrence of some of the Arara phonemes. For

example, in lexical items other than proper names, there is lack of contrast between [t]

and [ʧ] before the high front vowel [i]. In this environment only the affricate occurs:

(6) a. [ʧiʧi]

‘sun’

b. [kɔʧi]

‘a fish’

c. [ʧiɾuka]

‘coati’

This neutralization of contrast occurs because an alveolar stop always is realized as a

palatal affricate before /i/, as can be seen in examples (7b) and (7c) below, where this

lexical phonological process happens to reflexive and first person dual inclusive prefixes,

respectively:
(7) a. /ɔt-pɛ-pɔ-lɯ/13 Ref-forehead-hit-Rec
b. /ɔt-inɔ-lɯ/ Ref-leave-Rec
c. /kut-inɔ-lɯ/ 12Erg-leave-Rec

→ [ɔtpɛpɔlɯ] → [ɔʧinɔlɯ] → [kuʧinɔlɯ]

‘s/he hit his/her own forehead’ ‘they left each other’
‘we (dual) left him/her’

The process of affrication of a coronal stop also occurs (lexically and post-lexically)

before a palatal approximant, as can be seen in (8b) and (9b) below:

(8) a. /kaɾiamɯ-um/ deer-Aug

→ [kaɾiamɯum] ‘sheep’

12 The lenis form [d]̆ is an IPA notation for a quickly released [d], similar to an alveolar tap. 13 Here there is object incorporation.

10

b. /ɔɾɔt-um/ cashew-Aug

→ [ɔɾɔʧum]14

‘cultivated cashew’

(9) a. /pitɔt i-ɛmi-lɯ/ fruit 1Erg-eat-Rec
b. /pitɔt jɛmi-lɯ/ fruit eat-Rec

→ [pitɔd iemilɯ] ‘I ate a (tropical) fruit’ → [pitɔʧemilɯ] ‘s/he ate a (tropical) fruit’

However, there is contrast between [t] and [ʧ] before the vowel [i] in proper names:

(10) a. [titik]15 b. [ʧipi]

‘proper name for a man’ ‘proper name for a woman’

(11) a. [mohtiti]16 b. [taʧi]

‘proper name for a man’ ‘proper name for a man’

Before the vowel [i] the voiceless affricate [ʧ] is voiced into [ʤ] after nasal

consonants, as in (12b) below.
(12) a. /i-la-ʧi/ 3Abs-mouth-Poss
b. /i-mumɯ-ʧi/ 3Abs-head-Poss

→ [ilaʧi]
→ i-mum∅-ʧi17 [imumʤi]

‘his/her mouth’ ‘his/her head’

Thus, within a word only the voiced affricate is found after a nasal:

(13) a. /kuŋʧi/ → [kuŋʤi] b. /tɔŋʧiɾi/ → [toŋʤiɾi]
c. /ɛmʧin/ → [emʤin]

‘a bird’ ‘a lizard’ ‘his daughter’

14 Here there is insertion of the palatal approximant [j], and coalescence of the preceding /t/ and /j/, resulting in the affricate [ʧ]. Insertion of [j] occurs within certain linguistic structures that involve relationships between a direct object + 3 person verb (statement only), genitive-nouns, and the noun stem -Aug when the first constituent ends in a consonant and the following one starts with a vowel (except for [i]): /ɔɾɔt ɛnɛbɯlɯ/ → [ɔɾɔʧenebɯlɯ] ‘s/he brought cashew fruit’, /ɔɾɔt awom/ → [ɔɾɔʧawom] ‘cashew fruit tail (shred)’, /wom-um/ → [womjum] ‘cultivated banana’. Compare these examples with: [ɔɾɔd inebɯlɯ] ‘I brought cashew fruit’, [munbɔ awom] ‘rat tail’, and [munbɔum] ‘big rat’. Palatal glide insertion does not occur between subject-verb and moods other than declarative. Palatalization triggered by [j] is a post-lexical process. Compare: /ibɯt jɛ/ → [ibɯʧe] ‘his mother-in-law’ with /ibɯt imɯ/ → [ibɯd imɯ] ‘his father-in-law’. 15 This man is deceased. 16 This man is deceased. 17 Here there is a vowel deletion process, whereby across morpheme boundaries a vowel is deleted before a non-liquid consonant.
11

Actually, affricate voicing is part of a general process whereby only voiced obstuents

occur after a nasal consonant, as illustrated in (14b) and (15b):

(14) a. /ɛnɛbɯ-ta/ bring-Dist

→ ɛnɛb∅-ta18

[enepta]

b. /ɛnɛŋɯ-ta/ see-Dist

→ ɛnɛŋ∅-ta

[enenda]

‘bring it (from there)ǃ’ ‘(go there to) see itǃ’

(15) a. b.

/ɛnɛbɯ-kɔ/ bring-Imp
/ɔmɔmɯ-kɔ/ enter-Imp

→ ɛnɛb∅-kɔ → ɔmɔm∅-kɔ

[enepkɔ] [ɔmomɡɔ]

‘bring itǃ’ ‘come in!’

Thus, within a word only voiced obstruents are found in this environment:

(16) a. [tomɡem] b. [panbak]
c. [amdet]19

‘an insect’ ‘ball’ ‘handle, strap, hank made of cotton or vegetal fiber’

As shown in examples (14a) and (15a) above, other voiced consonants do not cause

the subsequent voiceless consonant to be realized as voiced. On the contrary, they are

realized as voiceless themselves.

Although the alveolar stop [t] never occurs before [i] in the lexicon other than in

proper names, its voiced counterpart [d] rarely can occur before this vowel: in the

question word [wadite] ‘how is it?’, and in few derived words, where the vowel /e/ is

raised to [i] before [a], in a dissimilation process. In this case, it must be noted that the

voiced alveolar stop [d] is not realized as palatal before [i]. Examples are given in (17b)

and (18b):
(17) a. /ɯ-ɡuɾi-dɛ-lɯ/ 1-angry-Verb-Rec
b. /ɔ-ɡuɾi-dɛ-ane/ 2Abs-angry-Verb-Admon

→ [ɯɡuɾidɛlɯ] → [ɔɡuɾidiane]

‘I got angry’ ‘don’t get mad!’

18 For vowel deletion here and in example (15), see footnote 17. 19 The Arara people from Cachoeira Seca village pronounce all these words with the corresponding voiceless stops.
12

(18) a. /i-mu-dɛ-lɯ/ 3Abs-egg-Verb-Rec
b. /ni-mu-dɛ-a/ 3Abs-egg-Verb-Perm

→ [imudelɯ] → [nimudia]

‘it laid an egg’ ‘let it lay eggs’

The sequence [di] also occurs in proper names:

(19) a. [adidi] b. [mohtidi]20

‘proper name for a woman’ ‘proper name for a man’

Other restrictions on sound occurrences can be found in utterance-initial position. Of

the fourteen consonants, only nine occur in this position: the voiceless stops [p], [t] and

[k], the affricate [ʧ], the bilabial and alveolar nasals [m] and [n], the lateral [l], and the

glides [w] and [j]. The other five cannot be found in utterance-initial position: the voiced

stops [b], [d] and [ɡ], the dorsal nasal [ŋ], and the tap [ɾ]. Neither consonant group seems

to form a natural class. Examples with consonants in utterance-initial position are given

in (20):
(20) a. b. c. d. e. f. g. h. i.

[peɾa] [tupɔ] [kutɔ] [ʧanɔ] [mɯta] [nunɔ] [lukɯnden] [wauɾi] [jaɡuɾi]

‘a tropical fruit’ ‘a gourd container’ ‘a toad’ ‘poison’ ‘a monkey’ ‘moon’ ‘scorpion’ ‘small fruit of a palm tree’ ‘agouti’

However, in terms of stops it is possible to see from affixation that each pair of

voiceless and voiced stops occurs lexically in initial position in underlying forms (UF).

Examples are given in (21) for voiceless and (22) for voiced, respectively:

(21) a. b.

/kambɔt/ /i-kambɔt-ɾɯ/ 3Abs-fire-Poss

→ [kambɔt] → [ikambɔɾɯ]

‘firewood, fire’ ‘his/her firewood, fire’

(22) a. b.

/bɯlɛptɛ/
/i-bɯlɛptɛ-n/ 3Abs-knife-Poss

→ [pɯlepte] → [ibɯlepten]

‘knife’ ‘his/her knife’

20 This is different from [mohtiti] ‘proper name for a man’ in (11a).
13

As can be seen in (21b) above, the /k/ of the stem does not voice after the prefix [i-];

the phonetic representation *[iɡamboɾɯ] is unacceptable. Therefore, the variation

between [p] and [b] in [pɯlepte] and [ibɯlepten] in (22a) is better explained as a

devoicing process (utterance-initially) than a voicing process after a vowel across a

morpheme boundary.

Stems starting with underlying voiceless consonants are extremely rare, like the

example in (21) above. They form just a small group of stems: about twenty or less in the

whole language. The most common situation is to have stems starting with voiced

consonants which are realized as voiceless word-initially.

There are other kinds of examples showing a difference of behavior between

underlying voiceless and voiced stops. One of them is that a voiceless alveolar stop (/t/)

in a UF is realized as voiced after a nasal consonant, while in this same environment, an

underlying voiced alveolar stop is deleted. This is possible to see comparing examples

(23b) and (24b) below, where in the first there is voicing of a consonant and in the second

deletion: (23) a.
b.

/ak-ta/21 eat-Dist
/ɛnɛn-ta/ see-Dist

→ [akta] → [enenda]

‘(go there and) eat it’ ‘(go there and) see it’

(24) a. b.

/i-ɛmi-da/ 1Erg-eat-Near
/i-ɛnɛn-da/22 1Erg-see-Near

→ [iemida] → [ienena]

‘I will eat it’, or ‘let me eat it (near me)’ ‘I will see it’ or ‘let me see it (near me)’

Yet among the fourteen consonants, only six can be found in utterance-final position:

the voiceless stops [p], [t] and [k] and the nasals [m], [n], and [ŋ]. The other eight cannot:

21 The UF for “eat” is /aɡu/ and “see” in (b) is /eneŋɯ/. They were modified here for the sake of simplicity. The vowel deletion is referred to in footnote 17. 22 See the previous footnote about the UF for “see”.

14

the voiced stops [b], [d] and [ɡ], the affricate [ʧ], the lateral [l], the tap [ɾ], and the glides

[w] and [j]. Examples with consonants in utterance-final position are illustrated in (25):

(25) a. b. c.

[kamap] [wakat] [kɔk]

‘a gourd container’ ‘alligator, cayman’ ‘evening, night’

d. [ɔɡum] e. [uɡon]
f. [manaŋ]

‘wasp’ ‘man’ ‘a coconut bug’

In terms of UF’s, the analysis developed to show contrast between the stops in initial

position does not apply to the stops in final position because: (a) they agree in voicing

with the following segment in a derived environment; or (b) they resyllabify to the onset

position when the next segment is a vowel, as expected in any other language. In other

words, in UF’s stops are unspecified for voicing lexically in final position. This non-

specification is represented by capital letters here and elsewhere.23 Examples of voicing

agreement between stops are shown in (26) and (27):

(26) a. /kamaB/

→ [kamap]

b. /kamaB tɯt/ c. /kamaB lɔn/

→ [kamap tɯt] → [kamab lon]

(27) a. b. c.

/kaɡaG/ /kaɡaG tɯt/ /kaɡaG lɔn/

→ [kaɡak] → [kaɡak tɯt] → [kaɡaɡ lon]

‘a gourd container’ ‘he wants a gourd container’ ‘gourd container itself’
‘a toucan bird’ ‘he wants a toucan bird’ ‘a toucan bird itself’

Examples of stops moving to the onset position when the next segment is a vowel are

presented below: (28) a. /ibɯD/
b. /ibɯD imɯ/
(29) a. /adaG/ b. /adaG adaG/

→ [i.bɯt] → [i.bɯ.di.mɯ̃ ]
→ [a.dak] → [a.da.ɡa.dak]24

‘his wife’ ‘his father-in-law’
‘two, pair’ ‘four’

23 Small upper case [ʙ̥] is used to represent a bilabial trill in this thesis. Therefore, it cannot be used to represent lack of contrast in voicing. Thus capital letters will be used: /B/ stands for bilabial, /D/ for alveolar, and /G/ for velar. 24 The insertion of /j/ does not occur between a word for number and a verb (regarding /j/ insertion, see footnote 14).
15

c. /adaG amɯD/ → [a.da.ɡa.mɯt] d. /adaG enepkɔ/ → [a.da.ɡe.nep.kɔ]

‘s/he (has) two pets’ ‘bring twoǃ’

On the other hand, all of the consonants may occur in onset position within an

utterance. But in coda position within an utterance, only the stops (voiceless and voiced)

and the nasals may occur, a total of nine consonants: [p], [b], [t], [d], [k], [ɡ], [m], [n],

and [ŋ]. However, the voiced stops occur only across word boundaries. The other five

consonants never occur in coda position: [ʧ], [l], [ɾ], [w], and [j]. Some examples of

consonants in coda position within an utterance are shown in (30):

(30) a. b. c. d. e. f. g. h. i. j. k.

[tɯap.kɔ] [kamap taɾik.pe] [kamab lon] [ɔt.pidɔ] [wakad wɔlɯ] [tuk.tɔ] [kaɡaɡ lon] [tom.ɡem] [en.ban] [kuŋ.ʤi] [waɡ wak]

‘a toucan bird’ ‘the gourd container is big’ ‘gourd container itself’ ‘an armadillo’ ‘he killed an alligator’ ‘cultivated field’ ‘toucan bird itself’ ‘insect’ ‘her/his food (fruit)’ ‘a bird’ ‘a bird’

B. Vowels

As mentioned above, the Arara language has six vowels. A vowel chart is shown

below with these phonemes:

Table 2: Vowels

Front

Central

Back

Non-round Non-round Non-round

Round

High

i

ɯ

u

Mid

ɛ

ɔ

Low

a

In order to confirm the vowel phonemes of the language, I show contrasts between

them in Appendix 2 at the end of this thesis.

Phonetically, the high back vowels, /u/ and /ɯ/, tend to be pronounced as lax or

slightly open. On the other hand, the mid front vowel /ɛ/ and the mid back vowel /ɔ/ tend

16

to be realized as more close before the close vowels /i/ and /u/. Examples with /ɛ/ being

realized as [e] are given in (31) below:
(31) a. [muɾei] b. [eudɯ]25

‘chair, bench’ ‘his ambush’

Examples with /ɔ/ being realized as [o] are given in (32) below:

(32) a. [oɡoi]26 b. [pou]

‘snake’ ‘small peccary’

The front mid vowel /ɛ/ is often pronounced as [e] in closed syllables:

(33) a. [ɔet]

‘rubber tree, plastic’

b. [ɔɾek]

‘skin wound’

c. [pɯɾep]

‘instrument made out of vine put on feet to climb trees’

An Arara speaker can pronounce a word in several different ways, showing vowel

fluctuation. This is illustrated below with the word for ‘beads’: (34) a. [kuɾi]
b. [koɾi] c. [kɔɾi]
However, there are restrictions on the occurrence of the vowels. Although all of them

can begin a word or an utterance, with rare exceptions only /a/ and /ɛ/ begin stems that

take prefixes (e.g. nouns that can be possessed, and verbs). Here are some examples with

nouns with stems starting with vowels other than /a/ and /ɛ/:

(35) a. uɡ-iɛ-n 12Abs-tooth-Poss

‘our (incl.) tooth’27

b. ɯ-ɔdɔ 1Abs-owner

‘my owner’28

c. ɯ-u-n 1Abs-food-Poss

‘my food’29

Here are some examples with verbs:

25 This is a trisyllabic word: [e.u.dɯ]. 26 This is also a trisyllabic word: [o.ɡo.i]. 27 Only eight stems starting with /i/ were found. 28 Only this stem was found. 29 Only this stem was found. No stem was found starting with /ɯ/.

17

(36) a. b. c. d.

i-ɔkpɛ-lɯ 1Erg-keep-Rec
i-ubi-tkɛ-lɯ 1Erg-seek-Iter-Rec
in-iadu-lɯ30 1Erg-burn-Rec i-ɯmdɯ-mɛ-lɯ 1Erg-dive-Caus-Rec

‘I kept it’ ‘I looked for it’ ‘I burned it’ ‘I put it in the water; I made it to dive’

At the same time, all of them undergo a nasalization process when they are in

utterance-final position and are preceded by a nasal consonant. This may be seen as an

intonational marking of an utterance boundary. Some examples are presented in (37)

below:
(37) a. b. c. d. e. f. g.

/abiana/ /ponɛ/ /ɔɾɛmi/ /tɔɾɔmɔ/ /imu/ /kaɾiamɯ/ /mau/

→ [abianã] → [pɔnẽ] → [ɔɾemĩ] → [tɔɾɔmɔ]̃ → [imũ] → [kaɾiamɯ̃ ] → [mãũ]

‘a peccary’ ‘piranha’ ‘a fish’ ‘Brazil nut’ ‘its egg’ ‘deer’ ‘cat’

When vowels are not in utterance-final position there is no nasalization. Some

examples are presented in (38) below:
(38) a. [abiana βɔk] b. [pɔnɛ βɔk] c. [ɔɾɛmi βɔk] d. [tɔɾɔmɔ βɔk] e. [imu βɔk] f. [kaɾiamɯ βɔk] g. [mau βɔk]

‘on the peccary’ ‘on the piranha’ ‘on the fish’ ‘on the Brazil nut’ ‘on the egg’ ‘on the deer’ ‘on the cat’

Vowel nasalization occurs in proper names that end in a vowel, when said in an

emphatic call. In this case, the nasalization spreads over all vowels of the word:31

30 /i/ needs to be better analyzed, since it receives /in-/ as the person marking prefix, which comes before consonants, and not vowels. 31 n this same kind of emphatic call, proper names that end in consonants have an extra unrounded high back vowel /ɯ/ after that consonant: /waŋɡɔT/ → [waŋɡɔdɯ] ‘proper name for a man’, /paŋ/ → [paŋɯ] ‘proper name for a boy’. Depending on the length of the calling, the epenthetic vowel can be lengthened.
18

(39) a. [eŋ̃ ɡɔ̃ ]̃ b. [ɔt̃ pa]̃ c. [ʧĩmĩ]

‘proper name for a man’ ‘proper name for a woman’ ‘proper name for a man’

3.1.2 Syllable Structure Arara has the following syllable types: V, CV, VC, and CVC. Thus its maximal

syllable template is CVC; there is no obligatory onset. All syllable types can occur word-

initially and word-finally. Here are some examples with the V pattern, word-initially and

word-finally, respectively:
(40) a. [ɯ.pɯ] b. [ɔ.ɡum]

‘yam’ ‘wasp’

(41) a. [mɯ.ɛ] b. [tu.a]

‘bag made out of vegetable fiber’ ‘a wild fruit’

Here are some examples with CV, word-initially and word-finally, respectively:

(42) a. [mɔ.ɛ] b. [ka.map]

‘a toad’ ‘a gourd container’

(43) a. [ɔna.kɔ] b. [ɯ.bɯ]

‘a bird’ ‘stone’

Here are some examples with VC, word-initially and word-finally, respectively:

(44) a. [ɔt.pidɔ]

‘an armadillo’

b. [ap.tenu]

‘wind’

(45) a. [ɛ.ɔk] b. [ɔ.et]

‘a beetle’ ‘rubber tree, plastic’

Here are some examples with CVC, word-initially and word-finally, respectively:

(46) a. [tuk.tɔ] b. [kɔt.kɔt]

‘cultivated field’ ‘a bird’

(47) a. [am.net] b. [ka.map]

‘his blood vessel, his vein’ ‘a gourd container’

19

3.1.3 Stress

In words pronounced in isolation, such as in a list, primary stress in Arara

preferentially falls on the last syllable of the word. Some examples are given in (48)

below:32
(48) a. b. c. d. e.

[kɔ'kɔ] [wa'kat] [tuk'tɔ] [apte'nũ] [ɔtkɔi'mɔ]̃

‘my uncle’ ‘alligator, cayman’ ‘cultivated field’ ‘wind’ ‘an armadillo’

However, there are some variations in stress. If a word ends in a sequence of two

vowels (followed or not followed by a consonant) and the second vowel is [+high], the

stress may alternatively switch to the previous vowel, resulting in a variation between a

monosyllabic and a disyllabic realization of the same word. Some examples are given in

(49) below:

(49) a. b. c. d. e.

Two Syllables

One Syllable

[po'u]

~ ['pou]33

[iɯ'i]

~ [i'ɯi]34

[mã'ũ]

~ ['mãũ]

[tɔ'uŋ]

~ ['tɔuŋ]

[a'ut]

~ ['aut]

‘small peccary’ ‘tree’ ‘cat’ ‘shotgun with a long barrel’ ‘his ribs’

Normally the pronunciations in the left column occur in careful speech; the others in

normal speech. This variation is not present when the second vowel is [-high], as can be

seen below:

(50) a. b. c.

[mɯ'ɛ] [tu'a] [mɔ'ɛ]

*['mɯɛ] *['tua] *['mɔɛ]

‘bag made out of vegetable fiber’ ‘a wild fruit’ ‘a toad’

Usually this variation is also absent in words containing three syllables:

32 This is the only section of the thesis where stress is marked. 33 If [u] were a consonant, [po'u] or ['pou] would receive [-ɡɔm] as plural and not [-ŋmɔ] as it does (see Section 3.2.7). 34 The phonetic form [jei] ‘wood, tree’, starting with a consonant, was attested only in the ludling examples (see Appendix 3, example 4).
20

(51) a. [takɯ'i] b. [oɡo'i]

*[ta'kɯi] *[o'ɡoi]

‘manioc flour’ ‘snake’

But there are some exceptions. In these cases, the consonant of the penultimate

syllable must be a liquid: /ɾ/ or /l/. Some examples are given in (52) and (53) below:

(52) a. [muɾe'i] b. [kaɾe'i]

~ [mu'ɾei] ~ [ka'ɾei]

‘chair, bench’ ‘non Indian’

(53) a. [lala'u] b. [ʧila'u]

~ [la'lau] ~ [ʧi'lau]

‘proper name for a woman’ ‘proper name for a woman’

Since stress on words pronounced in isolation, such as in a list, is very predictable, in

the rest of my phonetic transcriptions I will not mark it. However, it is worth noting that

within a sentence the stress can change from its final position within the word to a

different syllable. This can be seen in words such as [iʧiɡu'ɾu] ‘his urine’ and [u'ɾɔ] ‘I’,

which in isolation are spoken with stress on the last syllable, but within a sentence

pronounced with stress on the third and second syllable (from right to left), respectively.

(54) [i''ʧiɡu'ɾu doŋ 'uːɾɔ]35

/i-ʧiɡu-ɾu

doŋ uɾɔ/

3Abs-urine-Poss be I

‘I am going to urinate’

3.1.4 Some Common Phonological Processes In this section I will present one phonological constraint and some of the common
phonological processes that occur in the Arara language.

Obligatory Contour Principle The Obligatory Contour Principle (OCP) “prohibits consecutive or adjacent identical segments” (Goldsmith 1990:309). When identical segments are adjacent the OCP is violated. In Arara UF’s, it is possible to find sequences of segments with similar points of articulation, consonants or vowels, violating the OPC. When this happens, one of them is deleted: either the first or the second segment. It is not yet completely understood what

35 This sentence was collected in 1988, from a young man during an Arara festival. It was recorded with a Sony tape recorder. An Arara vowel can be lengthened in an emphatic linguistic environment.
21

triggers the direction of deletion. Examples involving regressive deletion of consonants

are shown in (55b), (56b), and (57c):

(55) a. b.

/ɛɾuB/36 /ɛɾuB mɔmuɾu/ hurry PN

→ [eɾup] → ɛɾu∅ mɔmuɾu
[eɾu momuɾu]

(56) a. b.

/i-bɔD put/ 3Abs-lip hair
/i-bɔD-ɾɯ/ 3Abs-lip-Poss

→ [ibɔt put]
→ i-bɔ∅-ɾɯ [ibɔɾɯ]

(57) a. b. c.

/wan/ /ɛpi/
/wan ɛpi/ honey bark

→ [wan] → [epi] → wan j-ɛpi37
wa∅ jɛpi [wajepi]

‘hurry’ ‘hurry, Momuruǃ’
‘his beard, his moustache’
‘his/her lips’
‘honey’ ‘his/her skin, its bark, leather’ ‘beeswax’

Examples of progressive consonant deletion, which occurs only in suffixes, are

shown in (58b) and (59b) below:
(58) a. abɛ-dam ebb-season
b. inmɛl-am fill-season

‘season of ebbing (water stream), dry season’ ‘season of filling (water stream), rainy season’

(59) a. b.

ɛŋu-ɾu eye-Poss
i-daɡin-u 3Abs-whistle-Poss

‘her/his eye’ ‘her/his whistle’

Examples of regressive vowel deletion are shown in (60b) and (61b):

(60) a. uɾɔ

‘I’

b. malon ur ɛndɔ enough I here

‘I am going to stay here’

36 It must be remembered that stops lose their voicing contrast in utterance-final position: in this position, only voiceless stops occur. Thus, a capital symbol in the underlying representation stands for an archiphoneme that points to neutralization of contrast (see footnote 23). 37 Here there is a feeding relationship: a palatal approximant is inserted across word boundaries between a C and the following V (CjV), and the preceding coronal C is deleted by virtue of the OCP violation (∅jV).
22

(61) a. b.

aŋna aŋn ebu-ɾu mortar handle-Poss

‘mortar’ ‘pestle’

An example of progressive vowel deletion is shown in (62b):

(62) a. wauɾi aɾɯ fruit leaf

‘fruit tree’s leaf’

b. waŋwa ɾɯ tree leaf

‘fruit tree’s leaf’

Progressive Vowel Deletion

A vowel is deleted after another vowel across a morpheme boundary. This deletion

applies only in certain suffixes: /-ɛnŋɛ/ ‘plural in postpositions’, /-ɛbaɾa/ ‘negation’, and

/-ɯpɛ/ ‘there is’. This phonological process cannot be insertion since it would be

necessary to propose that there is insertion of different vowels, such as [e] vs. [ɯ].

Examples with the ‘plural’ suffix in postpositions /-ɛnŋɛ/:

(63) a. /i-bɯdɛɡ-ɛnŋɛ/ 3Abs-similar-Pl

→ [ibɯdeɡenŋɛ]

‘he/she is like them’

b. /uɡ-wɯna-ɛnŋɛ/ 12Abs-for-Pl

→ uɡ-wɯna-∅nŋɛ [uɡwɯnanŋɛ]

‘for us’

Examples with the ‘negative’ suffix /-ɛbaɾa/:

(64) a. /mɔndɔn-ɛbaɾa/ there-Neg

→ [mondɔnebaɾa]

b. /tɔ-nɛn-dɛ-ɛbaɾa/ T-see-Nmlz-Neg

→ tɔ-nɛn-dɛ-∅baɾa [tɔnendebaɾa]

‘s/he, it is not there’ ‘it is not possible to see it’

Examples with the ‘existential’ suffix /-ɯpɛ/:

(65) a. /mulik-ɯpɛ/

→ [muliɡɯpe]

ani-there.is

b. /pumiɛ-ɯpɛ/ woman-there.is

→ pumiɛ-∅pe [pumiepe]38

‘there is an ani bird’ ‘there is a woman’

38 This phonetic representation shows that the deletion process being described here does not apply cyclically; otherwise the phonetic form would be *[pumiep]. But that surface form means ‘she is a woman’.
23

Nasalization of Stops

A stop consonant is realized as a nasal before a nasal consonant, as can be seen in

(66b), (67b), and (68b) below:

(66) a. b.

/wambiT/39 /wambiT muɾɛn/ vulture baby

→ [wambit] → [wambin muɾen]

‘vulture’ ‘vulture’s baby’

(67) a. b.

/w-ibɯ-lɯ/ 1Erg-bathe-Rec
/w-ibɯ-naŋɯɾɯ/ 1Erg-bathe-Prog

→ [wibɯlɯ]
→ w-ib∅-naŋɯɾɯ40 [wimnaŋɯɾɯ]

‘I took a bath (today)’ ‘I am taking a bath (in the river)’

(68) a. b.

/uɡ-aɾɔ/ 12Abs-lung
/uɡ-mum-ʧi/ 12Abs-head-Poss

→ [uɡaɾɔ] → [uŋmumʤi]

‘our (incl.) lung’ ‘our (incl.) head’

Vowel Deletion in CV Syllables

A high back vowel, [u] or [ɯ], is deleted after another vowel across a morpheme

boundary. The vowels must have an intervening labial consonant. The following diagram

represents this vowel deletion process.

(69)

V

+

C

V̆ → ∅

Labial [+high] [+back] Only a few nouns with obligatory possession undergo this deletion. The phonological process described here cannot be insertion since it would be necessary to propose that there is insertion of different vowels, such as [u] or [ɯ]. As shown in the above chart, the vowels that are sensitive to deletion after a prefix are marked with a diacritic to mark this sensitivity. This breve mark over the vowel is an ad hoc device, just to show that they

39 See footnote 23 for an explanation of capital letters. 40 Across morphemes a vowel is deleted in verb stem-final position before a non-liquid consonant (see footnote 17); stop sequences then are realized as voiceless: /bt/ → [pt]. Even when both stops are underlyingly voiced they are realized as voiceless: /uɡ-banan/ → [ukpanan] ‘our (incl.) ear’.
24

have a different behavior in relation to other vowels that do not undergo deletion in the

same environment. Examples of noun stems with vowels sensitive to deletion are: /mun̆ u/

‘body, flesh’, /mɯ̆ dabɯɾi/ ‘food’, /mŭbɛ/ ‘shoulder blade, scapula’, /bɯ̆ ʧi-/ ‘leg’, etc. As

already stated, all noun stems with a vowel sensitive to deletion begin with a labial

consonant.
(70) a. /mɔukɔ bɯ̆ ʧi-n/ PN leg-Poss
b. /i-bɯ̆ ʧi-n/ 3Abs-leg-Poss

→ [moukɔ bɯʧin] → [ipʧin]

‘Mouko’s leg’ ‘his leg’

(71) a. b.

/taʧi mŭbɯa-ʧi/ PN arm-Poss
/i-mŭbɯa-ʧi/ 3Abs-arm-Poss

→ [taʧi mubɯaʧi] → [imbɯaʧi]

‘Tatji’s arm’ ‘his arm’

Noun stems with vowels not sensitive to deletion after a prefix have no diacritic: /bana/ ‘ear’, /mɔwa/ ‘back’, /duɾu/ ‘central part of the body’, /bɛba/ ‘forehead’, /bia/ ‘cheek’, etc.

Regressive Vowel Harmony

When the back round vowel /u/ occurs before a tap preceding the mid vowel /ɛ/, the

mid vowel spreads its features to the back vowel across morpheme boundaries. Here are

some examples:
(72) a. /i-mɯŋu-ɾu/ 3Abs-blood-Poss
b. /tɯ-mɯŋu-ɾɛ/ T-blood-Adjr

→ [imɯŋuɾu] → [tɯmɯŋɛɾɛ]

‘his/her blood’ ‘s/he is bleeding’

However, if the preceding vowel is not an /u/, then /ɛ/ does not spread its features.

(73) a. /abo-n/ wing-Poss

→ [abɔn]

‘its wing’

b. /t-abo-ɾɛ/ T-wing-Adjr

→ [tabɔɾɛ]

‘it is with open wings’

3.2 Brief Overview of Arara Grammar

3.2.1 Morphological Typology In relation to the synthetic index (Comrie 1989:46; Whaley 1997:128-9), the Arara

language is a synthetic language since it utilizes various prefixes and suffixes, as

illustrated in (74).41

(74) tɯ-wɔ-dɯ-k ɔmɔɾɔ-ŋmɔ ɡanan

DO-kill-Pl-Imp you-Pl

at.least

‘kill itǃ, at least you all (do it)’42

No statistical research was done, however the Arara language seems to uniformly

share fusional and agglutinative characteristics, according to the terms of the fusion index

(Comrie 1989:46; Whaley 1997:133). Example (75b) below shows fusion occurring

between the second person /ɔ-/ and the vowel /ɛ/ in the stem, resulting in [i].

(75) a. /uɡ-ɛɾɛ-n/ 12-liver-Poss

[uɡɛɾen]

‘our (incl.) liver’

b. /ɔ-ɛɾɛ-n/ 2-liver-n

[iɾen]43

‘your liver’

Examples in (76) show agglutinative characteristics in Arara. The majority of these

morphemes can be easily segmented.
(76) a. kuʧ-ip-ta-ndɯ-n 12Erg-bathe-Dist-Pl-Hort
‘let’s (all) take a bath’ (elicited)
b. k-ɔd-ɛmia-ɡuɾuɡɛ-da 1Erg-Refl-hand-wash-Near
‘I am going to wash my hand (in a near place)’ (elicited)

In Arara there are three orders of prefixes and seven of suffixes. Sentence (76b)

above is an example of a sequence of three prefixes: person-Refl-Noun. Here is an

example of five suffixes:

The following diagram shows the order in which the different morphemes occur in

3.2.2 Ergative Type In terms of person cross-referencing on the verb (Comrie 1989:111, 126), Arara

displays an ergative-absolutive pattern. The prefix of the subject of an intransitive clause

has the same form as the prefix of the direct object of a transitive clause. The prefix of

the subject of a transitive clause has a different form. Some examples are given below (all

of them elicited):
(79) a. ɯ-wɯnɡɯ-lɯ 1Abs-sleep-Rec
‘I slept’
b. ∅-ɯ-mɔŋɔɡu-lɯ 3Erg-1Abs-wait-Rec
‘he/she waited for me’
c. in-∅-mɔŋɔɡu-lɯ 1Erg-3Abs-wait-Rec
‘I waited for him/her’

In the entire Arara language, there are nine intransitive verbs that form clauses with

an ergative subject prefix, similar to the ones that occur in transitive clauses. In terms of

first person, five of them occur with the allomorph [w-] and four with the allomorph [k-].

This last allomorph occurs only before verb stem starting with the vowel /ɔ/; the

allomorph /w-/ occurs before verb stems starting with the other vowels, as can be seen in

(80) below.
(80) a. w-ibɯ-lɯ 1Erg-bathe-Rec
‘I took a bath’

27

b. k-ɔɾiɡu-lɯ 1Erg-dance-Rec
‘I danced’44

When a language has intransitive verbs that sometimes perform the function of an active subject and sometimes perform the function of a non-active subject, it can be said that this language has split intransitivity. Since in Arara there are so few intransitive verbs with ergative (active) prefixes and the vast majority has abslotutive (non-active) prefixes, it cannot be classified as having split intransitivity.

3.2.3 Word Order

For transitive clauses, Arara has the basic word order object-verb-subject (OVS).

Examples are given below:

O

V

S

(81) ɔɾɛmi abot-tadamɯ-lɯ kɔkɔ

fish.(sp.) catch-Iter-Rec uncle

‘uncle caught several “oremi” fish’

O

V

(82) ...wɔtɔmɔ aut j-ak-takpɯ-lɯ

S waɡa...

tapir rib Relr-eat-finish-Rec PN

‘...Waga finished eating the tapir rib...’

For intransitive clauses, the word order is primarily SV.

S

V

(83) [mutɛ kun-ɛp-pa] 45 i-ɛʧit

poda-akʧi

PN Rem-arrive-Ind 1Abs-house inside-Dir

‘Mute came to my house (remote)’

S

V

(84) paɾu akɯndɛ-lɯ

water dry-Rec

‘the water dried up (in the small creek)’

44 The other verbs that follow these patterns are: [webɯlɯ] ‘I arrived’, [wɯdɔlɯ] ‘I went out’, [wibeŋɯɾɯ] ‘I fled’, [wiʧilɯ] ‘I layed down’, [kɔɾamelɯ] ‘I missed the target’, [kɔɾapɔtadamɯlɯ] ‘I walked around’, and [kɔngulɯ] ‘I climbed up’. 45 The use of square brackets within a sentence is only to mark syntactic constituents.
28

OVS word order is quite rare among the languages of the world. For example, in one

database of 1228 different languages, only nine are reported to have this word order, and

six of them are from South America (Dryer 2008:331).

In stative clauses, Arara has the word order subject-adjectival predicate (S-AP).

S
(85) maɾaɡ wɛt cockroach feces

AP
pɯgiɾimam-bɛ46 dirt-Pred

‘the cockroach feces are dirty’

3.2.4 Noun Phrases OV languages usually have the order adjective-noun (Comrie 1989:95). However, in

Arara, a noun phrase has the adjective after its head:
N Adj (86) uɡɔn ka-kɔ-mnɯ i-ɾumbɔ-lɯ
man high-over-Neg 3Abs-die-Rec
‘the short man died (today)’ (elicited)

N Adj (87) [wɔŋɔ taɾik-kɔm] bɯdɛk-ɛbaɾa tawɛ,

tɯ-mnɛ-bara

game big-Pl like.be-Neg monkey.(sp) T-flesh-Neg

‘monkey is not like big game meat; it does not have a big body’

On the other hand, the number precedes the noun:
Num N (88) [ananɛ nunɔ] w-ɛp-ta-nbɔm
one moon 1Erg-come-Dist-later
‘I will come back within one month (from the city to the village)’

Num N Adj

(89) [adak ɔbinɛ apaɡɯrɯdɛm] jɛŋnabɯ-lɯ ɔbɛtpambɯn

two metal flat

put-Rec buy.few

‘s/he put two worthless coins (in the basket)’

The head may be detached from the number and placed at the end of the clause:

46 Text: Marak. Author: Akitu Arara. Text collected and transcribed by Isaac and Shirley Souza, Altamira, April 23, 2004. The word [maɾak] seems to be borrowed from the Portuguese barata ‘cockroach’.
29

Num (90) [adak] n-iʧ-a

N [i-amɯ-t]

two 3Abs-Aux-Perm 1Abs-pet-Poss

‘let me get two pets (from these ones)’

Or the number may be detached from the head to the end of the clause:

N

Num

(91) [maɾapa] abi-lɯ papa [adak]

paddle make-Rec father two

‘my father made two paddles’

3.2.5 Relational Phrases

Typological studies show that OV languages usually have postpositions instead of

prepositions (Comrie 1989:95). The Arara language follows this general typological

tendency, as may be seen in the following examples:

(92) walɔ

muɾɛn i-abɔt-taŋ-dɛ

[ɔɾɔŋ bɔk]

hawk.(sp.) small 1Sg.Erg-catch-Uni-Perf ground on

‘I caught a small hawk on the ground’

(93) t-udu-k

[karɛi

wɯna]

DO-give-Imp non.Indian to

‘give it to the non-Indian!’

3.2.6 Tense, Aspect and Mood
The Arara language inflects verbs for tense, aspect and mood. Tense is marked by
[-lɯ] ‘recent past’, [-nɛ] ~ [-n] ‘remote past’, [-tʃi] ~ [-t] ‘present’, [-tɔmɛ] ‘future’, [-taŋ]
~ [-aŋ] ‘universal tense’.47 Below are examples of each tense: (94) a. w-ibɯ-lɯ
1Erg-bathe-Rec ‘I took a bath (today)’ b. w-im-nɛ-ba 1Erg-bathe-Rem-Ind ‘I took a bath (yesterday)’ c. w-ip-ʧi 1Erg-bathe-Pres ‘I bathe’

47 /-(t)aŋ/ has been glossed as universal tense (Uni) because: (a) in indicative clauses it does not point to a specific time, but only functions as a support to the aspect markers for perfective and imperfective; (b) in interrogative clauses it seems to function as a non-past tense.

30

d. pawi

i-ak-tɔmɛ kɔɡɔlɔne

curassow.(sp.) 1Erg-eat-Fut tomorrow

‘tomorrow I will eat the curassow’

e. w-ip-taŋ-dɛ-ba

1Erg-bathe-Uni-Perf-Ind

‘I already took a bath’

Aspect is marked by [-dɛ] ‘perfective’, [-ɡɯ] ‘imperfective’, and [-naŋɯɾɯ]

‘progressive’. Below are examples of each aspect:
(95) a. w-ip-taŋ-dɛ-ba 1Erg-bathe-Uni-Perf-Ind ‘I already took a bath’
b. w-ip-taŋ-ɡɯ-ba 1Erg-bathe-Uni-Imperf-Ind ‘I was taking a bath’
c. w-im-naŋɯɾɯ 1Erg-bathe-Prog ‘I am taking a bath’

Mood is marked by [-kɔ] ~ [-k] ‘imperative’, [-nɛ] ~ [-n] ‘hortatory’, and [-ba]

‘affirmative’.48 Here are examples with imperative and hortatory mood:
(96) a. ip-kɔ bathe-Imp ‘take a bath!’
b. kuʧ-ip-tɯ-n 12Erg-bathe-Pl-Hort ‘let’s (all) take a bath!’

Here are examples with the affirmative mood:
(97) a. w-ip-taŋ-dɛ-ba 1Erg-bathe-Uni-Perf-Aff ‘I took a bath’
b. w-im-nɛ-ba 1Erg-bathe-Rem-Aff ‘I took a bath (yesterday)’

However, /-ba/ never occurs with recent past:
(98) *w-ibɯ-lɯ-ba 1Erg-bathe-Rec-Aff
‘I took a bath’

48 Interrogative mood (Yes-No Questions) is formed by the use of the particle [ga] ~ [ka], as in [magu ga] ‘did you eat?’, and [mip ka] ‘did you take a bath?’.
31

3.2.7 Plural Forms

There are thirteen different allomorphs for showing plurality in Arara. They can be

classified into eight groups, depending on the grammatical form they occur in. In the

clusters below with more than one member, the allomorphs depend on the phonological

environment. In the verbs, the plural forms refer mainly to the subject.

(99) a. b. c.
d.
e. f. g.
h.

[-ŋgmɔ] ~ [-kɔm ~ -gɔm]49 [-tɔm ~ -dɔm] [-ɛnŋɛ ~ -nŋɛ]
[-tɯ ~ -dɯ]
[-ptɯ] [-ndɯ] [-am]
[-bu]

nouns, proper nouns, adjectives, subject in verbs in the indicative mood, verb suffix of purpose subject in verbs in the interrogative mood and in verbs in future tense object of post-positions, subject of verbs in conditional sentence, subject in verbs in negative mood, verbal stems without markers for mood/aspect/time, adverbs of intensity subjects in verbs in imperative and hortatory mood, subjects in verbs with the sufix for ‘later (euphemic imperative)’, subject in verbs with the sufix for ‘always’
subject in verbs with the suffix for ‘admonition’ subject in verbs with the suffix for ‘distal’ possessor of obligatorily possessed nouns without the possessor marker, possessor of obligatorily possessed nouns with the nominalizer of past, a question word object of post-position for ‘companion’

Proper names can have plural suffixes, as other nouns do:

(100) a. [taiŋmɔ]

‘Tai and others’

b. [pɯtɔtkom] c. [mutemgom]

‘Pytot and others’ ‘Mutem and others’

There is no agreement in number between a verb and any of its overt arguments, or

between a head and its dependent. Examples of absence of agreement at the sentence

level are given below in (101) and (102):

(101) a. kaɾei

ɯdɔ-lɯ-ŋmɔ

non.Indian go-Rec-Pl

b. kaɾɛi-ŋmɔ ɯdɔ-lɯ non.Indian-Pl go-Rec

‘the non-Indians went out’ ‘the non-Indians went out’

49 The suffix [-ŋmɔ] occurs after a vowel, and the suffixes [-kom] and [-gom] after a consonant; but [-kom] after a voiceless consonant and [-gom] after a voiced consonant.
32

c.
(102) a. b. c.

CHAPTER 4 LUDLING DATA
In this chapter I present the Arara ludlings that I collected from some elderly Arara people living in the village named Laranjal. In terms of the ludlings, young people are not, unfortunately, learning them any longer and the elderly Arara, due to lack of practice, are forgetting them. As a dying phenomenon, it is not unusual for the ludling speakers to have trouble with some or many of these unique forms. Indeed, the first time I heard these language games was in about 2001, and it was only by chance. One evening I was sitting at a table with some young Arara men and I spoke to one of them in the same way as I had been speaking to his little daughter. Children learning the Arara language use [l] instead of [ɾ]: [jɔlu] instead [jɔɾu] ‘tortoise’. So I replied to one of his questions by saying [ibala] instead of [ibaɾa] ‘no, nothing’, pretending I was a little boy. Laughing and widening his eyes he replied to me with surprise: “I am not a monkey for you to talk to me like this!” Then I found out that I was going to learn something new about the Arara language. I grabbed my notebook and said: “What? Is it not only children who speak this way?” He explained: “We only speak like that to monkeys. For example, instead of saying [amuɾu] we say [amulu]” (this word denotes a kind of alcoholic drink made out of chewed roots, mainly cassava). But he did not know any more examples. So he pointed out some people who would know more of these. The next day I started going to those people and, in several sessions, I discovered thirteen different ludlings that they use not only to talk to monkeys, but to other pets as well, one for each kind of animal that they
34

are talking to.50 As can be seen, the effect of my joke was the opposite of what I had intended. Instead of the man interpreting my utterance as if I were a little child talking, he interpreted it as if had been talking to a pet.
4.1 Meaning and Purpose of the Word Games Ludlings are common among the languages of the world, as pointed out by Bagemihl
(1996:319). In the literature, according to Sherzer (1982), ludlings have different labels, such as “disguised speech”, “linguistic games”, “ludling,” “pig latins”, “secret codes”, “secret languages, “speech disguise”, and other names. Botne & Davis (2000) use the term “language game”. Sherzer prefers the terminology “play language”. In this thesis I use some of these terms, with preference for the label ludling, from Latin ludus ‘game’ and lingua ‘language’, as described by Laycock (1969:14). Also, the word ludlingant, derived from ludling, will be used in this thesis. This word is defined by Sanders (2000:31) as the morpheme “realized as a substring of the output that is sensitive to constraints that reference it.” His definition includes only the reversal ludling morpheme, but here I use the term ludlingant for any morpheme used by the Arara people in their ludlings.
Laycock (1972) says that a ludling is a transformation of an ordinary language, changing the format but not the content of the original message, for purposes of concealment or comic effect (Frazier & Gil 2007). In this sense, Sherzer (1982:175) states that play languages imply the creation of new linguistic codes derived from the base language. He also says that play languages are linguistic forms that at any level are purposely manipulated. In this sense, the Arara language has ludlings, since the Arara
50 Child speech is not included here because, although having some small similarities with the ludlings, it also has lots of differences. For example, one main strategy to talk to children is to shorten consonants and words ([tekɔ] instead [ɔdepkɔ] ‘come here’), something out of the ludlings’ scope.
35

elders purposely manipulate the base language, changing the format but not the content of it, creating new linguistic codes with a certain purpose. Sherzer says that strictly speaking, the ludlings are not games, since they do not involve competition or winners, being primarily used for fun, although this does not mean that they need to be necessarily humorous (Sherzer 1982:175). Indeed, in Arara the elders do not have a humorous purpose when they use them.
Historically, purpose was crucial for ludling studies. Bagemihl (1996:699) says that traditional definitions of language games were based mainly on their sociolinguistic function. According to him they always have restricted sociolinguistic functions. Along this line, Sherzer (1982) specifies some common functions of play languages: concealment or secret, language learning (in Thai), pure fun or for play’s sake. He also says that some play languages are used in ritual contexts. In relation to the Arara language, the ludlings fulfill a very restricted sociolinguistic purpose; they are used to “talk” to the Araras’ pets as an expression of friendship. They can use the ludlings any time they approach their pets. On the other hand, in Arara there is no ritual context in which the ludlings are used.
Although being important, the purpose approach was not enough to explain the ludlings in the languages around the world. Thus Laycock51 shifted this approach to one based on the ludlings’ formal properties themselves. From this perspective, according to Bagemihl (1996:697) there are some factors intrinsic to ludling data: (a) they are quite unlike ordinary language operations and (b) they are relatively restricted with respect to their sociolinguistic function. In other words, the data have common operations such as
51 This happened in: Laycock, Donald. 1972. “Towards a typology of ludlings, or play-languages.” Linguistic Communications: Working Papers of the Linguistic Society of Australia 6:61-113 (see Bagemihl 1996). I was not able to find the Laycock article, so it is not part of my bibliography.
36

reversal, replacement, etc., that are not common to the normal language. Also, while the normal language can be used for a great variety of sociolinguistic functions, ludlings have very restricted social functions. Thus, in defining ludlings, Bagemihl (1996:699) includes the following criteria:
(a) ludling morphological processes may involve affixing, templatic structure, reversal, and replacement;
(b) their affixes are limited to one or at most a handful of lexical items; (c) their morphology is semantically empty. Criterion (b) does not describe the Arara ludlings very well, since these are quite productive. However, criteria (a) and (c) do. Commenting on criterion (a) above, Bagemihl (pp. 699-700) states that affixing is the simplest process in forming ludlings, and it involves attachment of a ludling affix to a non-ludling word. The ludling affix may have a vowel slot that is unspecified for its quality; but also it may have a vowel specified for its quality. The infix /-ɡV-/ is an example of a ludling affix containing an unspecified vowel. This infix can be added to an Arara base word such as /abat/ ‘manioc bread’, resulting in the ludling form /abaɡat/. An example of an affix containing specified vowels in Arara is the prefix /idi-/, which can be added to the same Arara base word /abat/, resulting in the ludling form /idibat/. Bagemihl also states that in templatic processes nasality may be mapped onto the template. This is attested in Arara, where the feature of nasalization can pertain to a word, a phrase, a sentence or a whole discourse. This can be seen in the Arara base word /tawɛ/ ‘capuchin monkey’, which turns to /tãwɛ/̃ after the addition of the ludling’s nasal feature. Yet in reference to (a) above, Bagemihl says that all or most of the vowels in a non-ludling utterance are replaced by one or two segments in the ludling form. In Arara the vowels in a base word can be replaced by the vowel [æ], or by lower and/or more fronted vowels in relation to the vowels of the base word, as can
37

be seen in /tawɛ/ changing to [tæwæ]. All of these phenomena will be presented in more detail in Section 4.2 below.
Commenting on (c) above, Bagemihl (1996:700) states that ludling morphology is semantically empty because it is used only to classify the speaker or the hearer as belonging to a particular category of individuals. For example, a person uses Pig Latin to address someone who belongs to a certain circle of friendship. In the Arara culture, a person uses the appropriate ludling to address specific classes of animals. Thus, the infix /-ɡV-/ is used to talk to capuchin monkeys; the prefix /idi-/ to talk to titi monkeys; the infix /-pt-/ to talk to squirrel monkeys; and nasalization is used to talk to howler monkeys.
The Arara people love their pets. Therefore, pets are very important in the Arara culture. Arara myths reveal that some animals were their ancestors, mainly the monkeys. Sometimes the Arara people use the ludlings’ structures for naming their pets, according to each animal species. Thus they can give the name /muni-ɡV/ → [muniɡi] ‘brother’ to a capuchin monkey. Usually the pets get names like any human being and the process of naming them is the same they use to name people. Then a person can get a proper name like [tɯptʃigɔriwɯ] ‘crooked shinned’; a capuchin monkey can get a proper name such as [tɯptapa] ‘the one who has a flat hand’.52 Right after the Arara contact with FUNAI, it was possible to see Arara mothers feeding from their own breasts not just their new babies but also own baby monkeys that their husbands had brought from the forest. For other pets, they offered their milk in a leaf. Thus, in this sense, it is not a surprise that the Arara people have different language games when playing with their pets. The surprise is in the high number of ludlings they use to “talk” to their pets. Just for a matter of
52 See Souza (in progress).
38

statistical comparison, Javanese (the language I found with the most play languages) presents only seven different ludlings (Sherzer 1982:183-186).53 Arara has almost twice this many.
In spite of the differences between a ludling and the base language in which it originates, an actual development in ludling analysis is the recognition that a ludling also involves linguistic processes of the ordinary language (Bagemihl, p. 701). In this sense, Sherzer (1982) states that there are similarities and differences among the linguistic structures of ludlings and ordinary languages. Haas (1967) provides a taxonomy of mechanisms or rules involved in play languages that are common to the languages of the world, namely: addition, subtraction, reversal, and substitution. The phonological typology of language games shows that the two most common types of games are syllable transpositions and phoneme insertions in one or more locations in a word (Botne & Davis 2000). On the other hand, reversal does not exist cross-linguistically. The ludlings in Arara fit in this typology, since they are built up mainly through the insertion of one ludling per word. It is noteworthy that what belongs to ordinary languages is more common in the ludlings and what does not belong to ordinary languages is rarer among the ludlings. If syllable reversal is not exploited in common languages, it will not be widely used in the ludlings. On the other hand, if addition is common among the languages of the world, it will be used in ludlings. Indeed, addition is the main process by which Arara speakers form their ludlings (eleven, out of thirteen).
Bagemihl (p. 711) states that “ludlings are an integral part of the human linguistic capacity and as such, an integral part of linguistic theory”. In other words, linguistic

theory has the necessary tools to analyze the ludlings around the world. I illustrate this using the thirteen different ludlings I found in the Arara society. 4.2 Presentation of Data
Some Arara elders from Laranjal village use ludlings to address different pets. These ludlings occur mainly with nominal words, like nouns. But they are also attested in verbs, phrases, and sentences, although only one man knows all thirteen ludlings and can use them in sentences. They are built through the addition of affixes to the base words of the Arara language. To form a ludling in Arara the attachment of only one affix is necessary. This affix can be a prefix, a suffix, an infix, or a suprafix. Among these, only the first two affixes occur in the normal Arara language. The last two are specific to the ludlings. These ludlings include vowel nasalization (V → Ṽ), vowel delition (V-V → V∅), and changes in consonant manner of articulation (/ɾ/ → /l/), tap deletion ((/ɾ/ → ∅), consonant replacement (C(C) → pt), changes in vowel quality (V → æ), etc. These changes will be exemplified and discussed below. For now I present the pets and the ludlingants relating to them:

The Arara ludlings have as their label in Arara [ilumbanbɔt] ‘to make tongue’ (i-lu-

mban-bɔt = 3Abs-tongue-Verb-Purp). The Arara people do not use the word for tongue as

a metaphor for language, except in these ludlings. The term they use for language/speech

is [wɔɾunduŋɔ]. The Arara ludlings have the same inventory of phonemes that is found in

the normal language. Each ludling will now be presented in detail.

4.2.1 Capuchin Monkey Talk Capuchin monkeys are called tawɛ in Arara. The ludling for this species of monkey is
labeled in Arara tawɛ lumbanbɔt ‘to make the tongue of a capuchin monkey’. There are

54 Borrowed word from Portuguese: galinha. 55 The two prefixes /eŋna-/ and /eŋnaɾa-/ appear to be completely unrelated to each other. That is, the last syllable made up of /ɾa-/ does not occur as an independent morpheme elsewhere in the language.

41

two steps to build the capuchin monkey ludling: (a) a morphological process that consists

of adding the infix /-ɡV-/ right after the base word’s last vowel, where the V is a vowel

without underlying feature specifications, copying the phonological features of the last

vowel from the word; and (b) a replacement of /ɾ/ by /l/.56 Examples in (104) below show

the ludlingant /-ɡV-/ added to base words ending in a consonant.

(104) a. ɛduɛt

ɛduɛɡɛt

‘his hammock’

b. ibam

ibaɡam

‘his illegitimate father’

c. kɔk

d. ɔɛt

ɔɛɡɛt

‘rubber tree, plastic’

e. pɔɾat

pɔlaɡat

‘a catfish’

Examples in (105) show this same ludling added to base words ending in a vowel.

(105) a. b. c. d. e. f. g. h.

aɛ nu57 ibaɾa paɾu kuɾi pɔu ikpa muni

‘a wasp’ ‘abcess, tumor’ ‘no, nothing’ ‘water’ ‘bead’ ‘small peccary’ ‘mud’ ‘my brother’

This ludlingant, like the other ones, can occur within polymorphemic words, such as

nouns, verbs, adjectives, and even auxiliaries, as can be seen in (106) below (see

Appendices 3 and 4).
(106) a. kɔkɔ-ŋmɔ uncle-Pl
b. k-ɔd-ɛmia-ɡuɾuɡɛ-da 1Erg-Refl-hand-wash-Near
c. tɔɾik-kom-bɛ big-Pl-Adjr

kɔkɔŋmɔɡɔ kɔdɛmiaɡuɾuɡɛdaɡa tɔlɛkombɛɡɛ58

‘uncles’
‘I am going to wash my own hand (near)’ ‘they are big’

56 This is the same kind of change that occurs in baby talk (see the introduction to this chapter). 57 The phonetic representation for this example is [nuБ]. A glottal stop is added to a CV content word when spoken in isolation. The glottal stop is not a phoneme in Arara. 58 Here the speaker changed the /i/ of /tɔrik/ to [e].

42

d. kɔɡɔlone [n-iʧ-a]

kɔɡɜlone [niʧaɡah]59 ‘leave it for

tomorrow [Abs-Aux-Perm]

tomorrow’

It can be seen above that the ludlingant /-ɡV-/ occurs word-finally in polymorphemic

words that end in open syllables, as it does in monomorphemic ones. However, there is

one exception with the suffix for deceased beings: /-mgeni/. Here the suffix comes after

the ludlingant:
(107) papa-mɡeni father-deceased

papaɡamɡeni60

‘my deceased father’

This probably happens because the meaning of the suffix refers to the whole word,

including the ludlingant. In the general case, it is the ludlingant that seems to have scope

over the whole word. Besides occurring in polymorphemic words, the ludlings in general

also occur in larger linguistic structures, such as sentences.

As can be seen in (108) and (109) above, the changes triggered by the ludlingant only

occur within the scope of a word, and thus do not affect the surrounding words,

phonologically speaking. It can also be seen that the ludling sentences follow the same

59 Here the speaker changed the second /ɔ/ of /kɔgɔlone/ to [ɜ]; this variation in common among some of the Arara speakers. He also added an extra [h] at the end of the utterance. Instead of the fricative, Arara speakers optionally use the stop [Б]. This process of adding a glottal at the end of an utterance is very common in normal speech. 60 There is another example similar to this one in our data: /uɡ-ɛnba-ɡa-n-ɡom/ (12Abs-food-LUD-Poss-Pl) ‘it is our food’ (see Appendix 4, example (11)). 61 In this sentence the speaker did not change the /ɾ/ into [l] in the stem [tɔɾik]; he also changed the /ɡ/ into /h/: /taɡie/ → [tahie].

grammatical structures of the Arara base language. For example, sentence (108) shows

ergativity (see Section 3.2.2) and OV word order (see Section 3.2.3). It can also be seen

that within a verbal sentence like (108), only the object has a ludlingant attached to it, but

not the verb. On the other hand, the adverbial complements have a ludlingant attached to

them. However, the attachment of a ludlingant to an adverbial phrase seems to be

optional, since there is one example where there is no ludlingant attached to it: /kɔɡɜlonɛ

n-iʧ-a-ɡah/ ‘leave it for tomorrow’ (Appendix 4, example (19)). The grammatical word

/bɔk/ does not have a ludlingant attached to it. Within a stative sentence, such as (109)

above, both the subject and the adjectival predicate have a ludlingant attached to them,

but not the adverb of intensity /tagie/ nor the tense marker /gumɯk/. The general data

above show that this ludlingant occurs with all syllable types:

(110) a. b. c. d.

V CV VC CVC

pɔ.u nu ɛ.du.ɛt i.bam

pɔuɡu nuɡu ɛduɛɡɛt ibaɡam

‘small peccary’ ‘abcess, tumor’ ‘hammock’ ‘his illegitimate father’

In terms of this specific ludling which adds the infix /-ɡV-/ to a base word, according

to Bagemihl (1996:699) the addition of affixes, and vowel copying, are common

phenomena among the languages of the world.

4.2.2 Duski Titi Monkey Talk Duski titi monkeys are called [kuʧamit] in Arara. The ludling for these species of
monkeys is labeled in Arara [kuʧamit lumbanbɔt] ‘to make the tongue of a duski titi monkey’. The morphological process used by the Arara people to build the duski titi monkey’s ludling is the addition of the prefix [idi-] to the stem of the base language form, where it has a /d/ before an /i/, which is a rare sequence in the Arara base language (see Section 3.1.1). Here are some examples with the ludlingant /idi-/:

44

(111) a. nu
b. wɔt c. kɔk

idinu idiwɔt idiɡɔk62

‘abcess, tumor’ ‘fish’ ‘night, evening’

We can see in the data above that there is no morphophonological process when [idi-]

is attached to a monosyllabic word. Similarly, in some words starting with a CV syllable

and where the next vowel of the stem is different from the vowel of this first CV syllable,

there is no morphophonological process resulting from the addition of [idi-].

(112) a. b. c. d. e. f.

malɔn muni ʧɛlɯ kɯdɛn piluŋɔ pɔu

idimalon idimuni idiʧɛlɯ idikɯdɛn idipiluŋɔ idibɔu

‘that’s okay’ ‘my brother’ ‘my sister’ ‘cassava’63 ‘bird hind quarter’ ‘small peccary’

However, in a few stems with these same characteristics, there is deletion of the first

CV syllable as a result of adding [idi-].

(113) a. idi-taupa b. idi-nabiɔt

→ idi-∅∅upa → idi-∅∅biɔt

[idiupa] [idibiɔt]

‘a banana’ ‘sweet potato’

On the other hand, if a stem starts with a CV(C) syllable and the next vowel of the

stem has the same backness as the first vowel of this CV(C) syllable, then deletion

(haplology) extends to the vowel of this syllable: /idi-V[αback](C)CV[αback](C)/ →

[idi∅∅(C)CV].
(114) a. /idi-jeme/ b. /idi-kɔkɔ/ c. /idi-papa/ d. /idi-pɔmu/ e. /idi-kutkut/ f. /idi-womjum/

→ idi-∅∅me → idi-∅∅kɔ → idi-∅∅pa → idi-∅∅mu → idi-∅∅tkut → idi-∅∅mjum

[idime] [idikɔ] [idipa] [idimu] [iditkut] [idimium]64

‘mom, my mother’ ‘my uncle’ ‘dad’ ‘beetle (sp.)’ ‘night monkey’ ‘banana (generic)’

62 The variation between [kɔk] and [idi-gɔk] is better analyzed as a devoicing process than a voicing process (see Section 3.1.1, examples (21) and (22)). 63 Other examples from Appendix 3 are: /muɾɛi/ → [idimuɾei] ‘bench’, /pɛɾa/ → [idibeɾa] ‘a fruit’, /pɯɾak/ → [idibɯɾak] ‘an arrow’, and /pɔɾat/ → [idibɔɾat] ‘a catfish’. 64 Phonetically speaking, the /j/ turns into the vowel [i], here and elsewhere.
45

As seen in (114e-f) this deletion process does not extend to a coda of a vowel to be

deleted. Furthermore, there seem to be exceptions to the deletion process, since a vowel

with the same backness as another one in the following syllable is not deleted in a few

stems:
(115) a. b. c.

/kamap/ /wakat/ /manaŋ/

[idikamap] [idiwakat] [idimanaŋ]

‘gourd container’ ‘alligator, cayman’ ‘a coconut bug’

There are other examples with fluctuation, such as /kaɾa/ ‘macaw (type of)’, where

the speaker once said /idiɡaɾa/ and another time /idiaɾa/. If the stem starts with a vowel,

this vowel is deleted: /idi-V/ → [idi∅]. Examples are given below:

(116) a. b. c. d. e.

idi-ae idi-abat idi-amuɾu idi-ɛmiaɾɯ idi-ɯpɯ

→ idi-∅e → idi-∅bat → idi-∅muɾu → idi-∅miaɾɯ → idi-∅pɯ

[idie] [idibat] [idimuɾu] [idimiaɾɯ] [idipɯ]

‘wasp (sp.)’ ‘manioc bread’ ‘his/her drink’ ‘his/her hand’ ‘yam’

A similar phonological phenomenon occurs in the Arara normal language, as seen in

Section 3.1.4 (specifically, Progressive Vowel Deletion), where the second vowel is

deleted in a vowel sequence. Again, if the vowel to be deleted in the ludling form has a

coda, the coda is not subject to deletion:

(117) a. idi-ɛnbɛn b. idi-ikpa

→ idi-∅nbɛn → idi-∅kpa

c. idi-ɔtpidɔ

→ idi-∅tpidɔ

[idinben] [idikpa] [iditpidɔ]

‘penis’ ‘mud’ ‘armadillo’

As can be seen in (107), a consonant in coda position preserves its voicing feature

after the deletion process. If the vowel to be deleted is followed by a non-final syllable

starting with an /ɾ/, the deletion extends to this syllable. (118) ɔɾɛmi idi-ɔɾɛmi → idi-∅∅∅mi [idimi]

‘a fish’

For now, only (118) was found as an example. If the /ɾ/-syllable occurs at the end of

the (first) stem, it will not be subject to the deletion process, as can be seen in (119)

below:

46

(119) a. idi-kuɾɔ-kuɾɔ65 b. idi-kuɾɛ-p c. idi-wɯɾɯ-pɛ d. idi-tɔɾik-kɔm-bɛ

→ idi-∅∅ɾɔ-kuɾɔ → idi-∅∅ɾɛ-p → idi-∅∅ɾɯp-pɛ → idi-∅∅ɾik-kɔm-bɛ

[idiɾɔkuɾɔ] [idiɾep] [idiɾɯpɛ] [idiɾikombɛ]

‘a bird’ ‘it is good’ ‘it is bad’ ‘they are big’

This ludlingant, like the other ones, can occur within polymorphemic words, such as

nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, as can be seen in (120) below (see Appendices 3

and 4). (120) a.

‘my path’
‘I am going to wash my own hand (near)’ ‘it is big’
‘leave it for tomorrow’

It can be seen above that the ludlingant /idi-/ occurs word-initially in polymorphemic

words, as it does in monomorphemic ones. In (120a and b) the deletion process goes over

the vowel of the prefix and is extended to the first vowel of the stem, deleting two

vowels. In monomorphemic words (see example (116a) above) the deletion process

deletes only one vowel, not extending deletion over the second vowel of the stem. In

(120a and b) the deletion acts completely over the personal and reflexive prefixes. The

example below also shows the complete deletion of a prefix:

(121) ugu-pʧi-n-ɡɔm 12Abs-leg-Poss-Pl

idipʧinɡɔm

‘our (incl.) leg’

As happens with /-ɡV-/, the ludling /idi-/ also occur in larger linguistic structures,

such as sentences.

Again, as triggered by the ludling /-ɡV-/, the changes triggered by /idi-/ only occur

within the scope of a word, and thus do not affect the surrounding words, phonologically

speaking. The same occurs in terms of grammatical structures, following the patterns of

the base language. Some words that start with a voiceless stop in the Arara base language

preserve their voiceless nature after the addition of the ludlingant /idi-/, while others do

not, changing from voiceless to the corresponding voiced counterparts, as can be seen

below: (124) a.

‘bird hind quarter’ ‘small peccary’
‘cassava’ ‘a fish’

As can be seen in (124a) and (125a) above, neither [p] nor [k] voices after the

addition of /idi-/. However, in examples (124b) and (125b), both [p] and [k] voice after

this ludlingant. Therefore, the variation between [p] and [b], and [k] and [ɡ] is better

explained as a devoicing process (utterance-initially) than a voicing process after a vowel

across a morpheme boundary. This same kind of devoicing process is found in the Arara

base language (see Section 3.1.1, examples (21) and (22)). There is no example showing

this variation between the alveolar stops [t] and [d]. Only the voiceless counterpart occurs

in this environment.

Absence in the variation of voicing between the alveolar stops may be due to limited

data. This same absence of variation is also present among the affricates [ʧ] and [ʤ], but

48

this is expected from the base language, where an affricate does not voice after a vowel.

It voices only after a nasal consonant (see Section 3.1.1, examples (12)). The general data

show that the ludlingant /idi-/ occurs with all syllable types:

(127) a. V a.ɛ b. CV kɯ.dɛn

idiɛ idikɯdɛn

‘a wasp’ ‘cassava’

c. VC ik.pa d. CVC kut.kut

idikpa iditkut

‘a fish’ ‘night monkey’

All the ludlings formed by prefixation, except for /un-/, such as /idi-/, /wi-/, /pɔ-/,

/nɯ-/, /pi-/, /tɔ-/, /ɛŋna-/, and /ɛŋnaɾa-/, work in similar ways in terms of phonological

processes, mainly the last seven ones that have the syllabic shape CV.

4.2.3 Large Bird Talk Large birds, including chickens, muscovy ducks, Brazilian mergansers, guans, and

curassows are, respectively, called [ʧaɾina], [bakeni], [jaɾambi] [wogaɾaum], and [pawi]

in Arara. The ludling for these species of large birds is labeled in Arara [ʧaɾina, bakeni,

jaɾambi, wogaɾaum, pawi bene lumbanbɔt] ‘to make the tongue of chickens, muscovy

ducks, Brazilian mergansers, guans, and curassows’. The morphological process used by

the Arara people to build these large birds’ ludling is the addition of the /wi-/ prefix.

(128) a. nu b. wɔt

winu wiwɔt

‘abcess, tumor’ ‘fish’

c. kɔk

wiɡɔk

‘night, evening’

The phonological patterns of this ludling work almost exactly the same way as those

of the ludling /idi-/. See section 4.2.2 (Duski Titi Monkeys Talk) for a description of

these phonological patterns, which are analogous to that ludling. Thus the data in (128)

show examples of the /wi-/ ludling in monosyllabic words. In (129) below there are

examples of this ludling attached to polysyllabic words, resulting in a haplology process:

/wi-(C)V/ → [wi(∅)∅].
(129) a. wi-aɛ b. wi-taupa c. wi-ɔɛt

→ wi-∅ɛ → wi-∅∅upa → wi-∅ɛt

[wie] [wiupa] [wiet]

‘a wasp’ ‘a banana’ ‘rubber tree’

g. wi-pɔmu
h. wi-ɔɾɛmi i. wi-muni

[wibat] [winat] [wime] [wimu] [wiɾemi] [wini]

‘manioc bread’ ‘corn’ ‘mom, my mother’ ‘a beetle’ ‘a fish’ ‘my brother’

It is interesting to note that example (129h) shows that /wi-/ triggers a different

phonemic process than the ludlingant /idi-/ above. The /idi-/ extends deletion to the next

syllable with an /ɾ/-onset (see example (118) above); /wi-/ does not extend deletion to this

/ɾ/-initial syllable. On the other hand, similar to /idi-/, here this deletion process does not

extend to the coda of a vowel to be deleted.

(130) a. wi-ɛnbɛn → wi-∅nbɛn

b. wi-ikpa c. wi-ɔtpidɔ

‘his penis’ ‘mud’ ‘armadillo’ ‘night monkey’ ‘banana’

This ludlingant, as /idi-/ and the other ludlings, can occur within polymorphemic

words, such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives, as can be seen in (131) below (see

Appendices 3 and 4).

‘I am going to wash my own hand (near)’ ‘I wrote it’
‘they are big’

Unlike the ludling /idi-/, the deletion here does not act over the personal and reflexive

prefixes, only over the first CV syllable, as in (131b) above. But like /idi-/, it deletes

identical vowels in a prefix:
(132) ugu-pʧi-n-ɡɔm 12Abs-leg-Poss-Pl

wipʧinɡɔm

‘our (incl.) leg’

67 Here the speaker changed /wi-/ to [we-] ‘LUD’, in a dissimilation process.
50

In terms of exceptions, in a couple of words starting with a bilabial consonant, no

deletion occurs:
(133) a. pɔu b. pɔɾat

wibɔu wibɔɾat

*wiu *wiɾat

‘small peccary’ ‘catfish’

There are similar examples where the deletion process does apply:

(134) a. pɯɾak b. pɛɾa

wiɾak wiɾa

‘arrow (type of)’ ‘fruit (type of)’

It was seen that in the /idi-/ ludling there is no example of variation of voicing

between the alveolar stops [t] and [d]. With /wi-/, in addition to [t] and [d], there is also

no example showing variation of voicing between the velar [k] and [ɡ], mainly because of

the deletion process over the CV syllable word-initially, such as in the following

4.2.4 Trumpeter and Woodpecker Talk Trumpeters and woodpeckers are, respectively, called [waɾakina] and [iebɛɾɛbɯɾɯ]

in Arara. The ludling for these species of animals is labeled in Arara [waɾakina

iebɛɾɛbɯɾɯ bene lumbanbɔt] ‘to make the tongue of the trumpeters and woodpeckers’.

The morphological process used by the Arara people to build the trumpeters’ and

woodpeckers’ ludling is the addition of a /pɔ-/ prefix.

The phonological patterns of this ludling work almost exactly the same way as those

of the /idi-/ and /wi-/ ludlings. However, it is much more similar to the patterns of the

/wi-/ ludling (see Section 4.2.3). Thus, example (141) illustrates the ludlingant /pɔ-/ in

monosyllabic words. In (142) below there are examples of this ludling attached to

polysyllabic words, resulting in the haplology process: /pɔ-(C)V/ → [pɔ(∅)∅]. Here are

some examples:
(142) a. pɔ-aɛ b. pɔ-taupa c. pɔ-ɔɛt d. pɔ-abat e. pɔ-ɔnat f. pɔ-jɛmɛ g. pɔ-pɔmu

→ pɔ-∅ɛ → pɔ-∅∅upa → pɔ-∅ɛt → pɔ-∅bat → pɔ-∅nat → pɔ-∅∅mɛ → pɔ-∅∅mu

[pɔɛ] [pɔupa] [pɔet] [pɔbat] [pɔnat] [pɔmɛ] [pɔmu]68

‘a wasp’ ‘a banana’ ‘rubber tree’ ‘manioc bread’ ‘corn’ ‘mom, my mother’ ‘a beetle’

68 Here the word resulting after the addition of the ludlingant is coincident with the base Word. Therefore, there is a homonym process between the base language and this ludling, in this case.

Like /wi-/, this ludlingant does not extend deletion to an /ɾ/-initial syllable (see

Section 4.2.3). And like all the other (V)CV prefixed ludlings, it does not extend deletion

to the coda of a vowel to be deleted.

d. tɔɾik-kɔm-bɛ big-Pl-Adjr

pɔɾik-kɔm-bɛ

Like the ludling /wi-/, and unlike /idi-/, the deletion here does not act over the

personal and reflexive prefixes, only over the first CV syllable of the word, as in (144b)

above. But unlike /idi-/ and /wi-/, it does not delete identical vowels in a prefix:

(145) ugu-pʧi-n-ɡɔm 12Abs-leg-Poss-Pl

pɔgɔpʧinɡɔm69

‘our (incl.) leg’

Like /wi-/, there are exceptions to the deletion process (/pɔ-(C)V/ → [pɔ(∅)∅]):

(146) a. pɔu b. pɔɾat

pɔbɔu pɔbɔɾat

*pɔu *pɔɾat

‘small peccary’ ‘catfish’

(147) a. pɯɾak pɔɾak

‘an arrow’

b. pɛɾa

pɔɾa

‘a fruit’

69 Here the expected form is [pɔgupʧingom]; or better yet, [pɔpʧingom], deleting the whole prefix /ugu-/, as occurs with the other ludlings.
53

also occurs in sentences, following the parameters of the base language.

4.2.8 Small Bird Talk Small birds, including macaws, parrots, orange-cheeked parrots, and parakeets are,

respectively, called [kaɾa (awɯ, kaɾaja, kaɾaum)], [ʧaɾɔkʧaɾɔ], [kui], and [eɾidak] in

4.2.10 Spider Monkey Talk Spider monkeys are called [woŋoum] in Arara. The ludling for these species of

monkeys is labeled in Arara [woŋoum lumbanbɔt] ‘to make the tongue of the spider

monkey’. The morphological process used by the Arara people to build the spider

monkey’s ludling is the addition of an /un-/ prefix.

(221) a. un-nu b. un-wɔt
c. un-kɔk

unu unwɔt unɡɔk

‘abcess, tumor’ ‘fish’ ‘night, evening’

We can see in the data above that there is no morphophonological process when [un-]

is attached to a monosyllabic word, except if the base word starts with an alveolar

69

consonant, as in (221a). In this case, the alveolar consonant is deleted (see below for

more examples of this process). But deletion also does not occur in some polysyllabic

words. For example, there is no deletion when the base word starts with /m/.79

(222) a. b. c. d. e. f. g.

muni mɯda matɛ malon mɯdaimɔ muɾɛi manaŋ

unmuni unmɯda unmatɛ unmalon unmɯdaimɔ unmuɾɛi uŋmanaŋ80

‘brother’ ‘wait!’ ‘go!’ ‘that’s okay’ ‘a fish’ ‘bench’ ‘a coconut bug’

Also no deletion occurs if the ludlingant /un-/ is added to a word that starts with a

closed syllable: un-(C)VC.81
(223) a. un-kutkut b. un-ɔtpidɔ c. un-ɔtkoimo d. un-ikpa e. un-ambamba f. un-ɛnbɛn g. un-wɔmjum

→ [unɡutkut] → [unɔtpidɔ] → [unɔtkoimõ] → [unikpa] → [unambamba] → [unenben] → [unwomjum]82

‘night monkey’ ‘armadillo’ ‘armadillo’ ‘mud’ ‘sting ray’ ‘his testicles’ ‘banana’

However, some deletions occur as a result of the addition of the ludlingant /un-/ in

polysyllabic words. One deletion occurs when this ludlingant is added to a word starting

with an alveolar consonant. In this case, the alveolar consonant is deleted: un-C[Cor] →

un-∅.83

79 Here deletion has scope only over bilabial nasals and not over bilabial consonants in general, similar to what happens with /tɔ-/ and /eŋna-/ (see Sections 4.2.7 and 4.2.8). 80 The form /uŋ-/, for this ludlingant, is a speaker variant. 81 There are exceptions: /pɔtpɯɾi/ → [unbɯɾi] ‘wood tick’, /ɔnma/ → [unma] ‘path’. 82 The form [uŋmjum] was also attested (datum from 2010). 83 There is one exception: /un-ʧamit/ → un-∅∅mit → [unmit] ‘squirrel monkey’, instead of the expected form: *[unamit].

It is noteworthy that some words can be input to different phonological processes

when the ludlingant /un-/ is added. For example, /nu/ ‘abcess, tumor’, as a monosyllabic

word, can be an input to the deletion blocking process. At the same time, it can undergo

deletion, since it is a word that starts with an alveolar consonant. As can be seen, the

deletion does apply (see (221a) and (224a) above). Neither *[unnun] nor *[unːun] are

attested.

Another deletion occurs when the ludlingant /un-/ is attached to a word whose first

two vowels are identical, except if the first syllable has a coda (see examples in (223)

above). In this case, the syllable of the first vowel is deleted (haplology): /un-

(C)ViCVi/→ [un-∅∅CV].88

84 There also exists the form [undawe], collected at the same time (January 2003) as [unawe]. 85 Here the speaker changed the high round back vowel /u/ to /i/. 86 The form [uŋbiɔt] was recorded as well. Besides deleting the vowel /a/, there is an unexpected change in the place of articulation of the nasal consonant from the prefix. 87 The form [unɡɯi] is also attested. 88 There are exceptions such as /un-kaɾa/ → [ungaɾa] ‘macaw (spp.)’ and /un-kamap/ → [ungamap] ‘gourd container’ where no deletion occurs. 89 The expected form was [unbiɾinda].

It is noteworthy that the stops in (225d-f) are voiced after a nasal consonant, as occurs

in the normal language (see Section 3.1.1, examples (14) and (15)). Again it is

noteworthy to see that some words can be input to different phonological processes when

the ludlingant /un-/ is added. For example, /manaŋ/ ‘a coconut bug’ can be an input to the

blocking process or to the deletion triggered by the addition of /un-/ before a word whose

first two vowels are identical. However, only the blocking process applies (see (222g)

above). The form *[unanaŋ] is not attested.

It was seen that deletion is blocked in some words: monosyllabic words, words that

do not start with bilabial nasal, and words that do not start with a closed syllable. It was

also seen that some words undergo deletion: words that start with an alveolar consonant

and words whose first two vowels are identical. For other words, their behavior is not

always consistent. For example, there are some cases where no phonological process

occurs even though the first two vowels of the base word are different.

90 Here the nasal assimilates to the place of articulation of the following consonant. As can be seen from the other examples, this assimilation is not a general process among the ludlings. 91 In the data I recorded with an elderly man the following alternative forms appear: [unum], [unɾun], and [uniɾun]. 92 The form [unat] was also attested (/un-ɔnat/ → un-∅nat → un-∅∅at). 93 Here and elsewhere, only voiced obstruents occur after a nasal consonant (see Section 3.1.1, examples (14) and (15)).

72

However, similar words undergo deletion.

‘rubber tree’ ‘manioc bread’ ‘catfish’ ‘forest’ ‘club’ ‘I ate it’ ‘a fish’ ‘cassava’

Therefore, there is no general pattern for these data, from (226) and (227) above.

Other variatons by the speaker can also be found. There is a change from a back vowel to

a front vowel in the prefix /un-/, either into [in-] or [en-]:

(228) a. /un-idamuɾu/

[indamuɾu]

‘his grandson/granddaughter’

b. /un-ikamabuɾu/ c. /un-ipun/
d. /un-ɛmuɾu/

[inɡamabuɾu] [inbun] [enemuɾu]

‘a gourd container’ ‘his/her foot’ ‘his testicles’

Also there is an example with /i/ epenthesis:

(229) /kuʧamit/

→ un-kuʧamit

[uniʧamit]

‘duski titi monkey’

There are examples with vowel mutation in the base word, from /e/ to [i] and /u/ to

[i], respectively:
(230) a. /ɛnaɾut/ b. /tuktɔ/

→ un-ɛnaɾut → un-tuktɔ

[uninaɾut] [uniktɔ]

‘his sister’ ‘cultivated field’

This ludlingant, like the other ones, can occur within polymorphemic words, such as

nouns, verbs, and adjectives, as can be seen in (231) below (see Appendices 3 and 4).

(231) a. i-ɛnma-n 1Abs-path-Poss

‘I wrote it’

d. kuɾɛ-p good-Adjr

It can be seen above that the ludlingant /un-/ occurs word-initially in polymorphemic

words, as it does in monomorphemic ones. Here the deletion process can also be

73

extended over two vowels word-initially. However, like the other prefixed ludlingants,

this deletion process occurs only if the first vowel is part of a prefix, as in (231a) above.

Similar to the other ludlings that are prefixes, except /pɔ-/, this ludlingant deletes a whole

prefix when it is formed of two identical vowels:

(232) ugu-pʧi-n-ɡɔm

unbɯʧinɡɔm

12Abs-leg-Poss-Pl

‘our (incl.) leg’

However, in order to fit into Arara syllable structure, the stem used here is the one

that occurs after a noun, bɯʧinɡɔm, and not the one that occurs with prefixes -pʧinɡom

(see the vowel deletion process that occurs here in section 3.1.5). And like all of the

ludlings, /un-/ also occurs in sentences:

74

4.2.11 Squirrel Monkey Talk Squirrel monkeys are called [ʧamit] in Arara. The ludling for these species of

monkeys is called in Arara [ʧamit lumbanbɔt] ‘to make the tongue of a squirrel monkey’.

The morphological process used by the Arara people to build the squirrel monkey’s

ludling is the addition of an infix /-pt-/ after the first vowel of the base word.

(237) a. nu b. wɔt
c. kɔk

nuptu wɔptɔt kɔptɔk

‘abcess, tumor’ ‘fish’ ‘night, evening’

As seen above, when the ludlingant [-pt-] is inserted into a monosyllabic word, the

vowel from the syllable nucleus is repeated after the addition of the infix. This seems to

happen so that the output forms can accommodate Arara syllable structure. Without this

repetition these output forms would present consonant clusters, such as *nupt, *wɔptt,

and *kɔptk, respectively, not licensed by the CVC Arara canonical pattern.

When this ludlingant occurs in words with a vowel sequence in the two first syllables,

it simply separates the two vowels: /(C)VV(C)/ → [(C)V-pt-V(C)].

(238) a. aɛ b. ɔɛt c. pɔu d. taupa

a-pt-ɛ ɔ-pt-ɛt pɔ-pt-u ta-pt-upa

[apte] [ɔptet] [poptu] [taptupa]95

‘a wasp’ ‘rubber tree’ ‘small peccary’ ‘a banana’

If the first vowel in the word is followed by a consonant, the ludlingant replaces this

consonant: /(C)V-C-V(C)/ → [(C)V-pt-V(C)].

(239) a. /kɔkɔ/

→ kɔ-pt-ɔ

b. /jɛmɛ/

→ jɛ-pt-ɛ

c. /papa/

e. /ʧɛlɯ/

→ ʧɛ-pt-ɯ

f. /ɔɾɛmi/

→ ɔ-pt-ɛmi

g. /ɔnat/

→ ɔ-pt-at

h. /pitɔt/

→ pi-pt-ɔt

i. /mɯda/

→ mɯ-pt-a

‘my uncle’ ‘mom’ ‘dad’ ‘manioc bread’ ‘sister’ ‘a fish’ ‘corn’ ‘a fruit’ ‘wait!’

95 This example is in Appendix 3, example (12), line C. In that appendix, in the sentence section, example (20), line C, the speaker gave the form [taupta], with the ludlingant after the second vowel.
75

If there are two consonants following the vowel, both of them will be replaced by the

ludlingant /-pt-/. Thus we can have /(C)V-CC-V(C)/ → [(C)V-pt-V(C)], as can be seen in

the examples below.
(240) a. /ɛnbɛn/ b. /ɔnma/ c. /ɔtpa/ d. /ikpa/ e. /tamɡɔ/ f. /kutkut/

→ ɛ-pt-ɛn → ɔ-pt-a → ɔ-pt-a → i-pt-a → ta-pt-ɔ → ku-pt-ut

[epten] [opta] [opta] [ipta] [taptɔ] [kuptut]

‘his penis’ ‘path’ ‘a fish’ ‘mud’ ‘old man, grandpa’ ‘night monkey’

There are other examples that support this hypothesis. Similar, but not identical to

/idi-/ (see Section 4.2.2, example (118)), if the next consonant in the sequence of

phonemes is a flap and the vowel following the flap is identical to the one before it, the

replacement extends until the flap: /(C)V-CViɾ-Vi/ → [(C)V-pt-Vi].

(241) a. /ibiɾinda/ → i-pt-inda

[iptinda]

b. /ibaɾa/

→ i-pt-a

[ipta]

c. /amuɾu/

→ a-pt-u

[aptu]

‘companion’ ‘nothing’ ‘alcoholic drink’

The only other ludlingant that causes this kind of deletion is /idi-/, for duski titi

monkeys talk (see Section 4.2.2). On the other hand, a palatal affricate does not delete.

(242) a. /kɔtʃi/ → kɔ-pt-tʃi b. /ɛmʧin/ → ɛ-pt-ʧin

kɔ-p∅-tʃi [kɔptʃi] ɛ-p∅-ʧin [epʧin]

‘a fish’ ‘his daughter’

Since the lundlingant /-pt-/ ends in an alveolar stop, and the contiguous affricate

begins with a similar stop, the OCP is violated with a consequent deletion of the alveolar

stop from the ludlingant (for OCP see Section 3.1.5). This is the only example of a

ludlingant undergoing a phonemic process. However, there is an example where the

affricate is replaced.
(243) ugu-ptʃi-n-gɔm 12Abs-leg-Poss-Pl

→ ugu-pt-ingɔm

[uguptingom] ‘our (incl.) leg’

Different from the normal language, this ludling does not palatalize an alveolar stop

before the vowel /i/ (see Section 3.1.1, examples (7b and c)).

(244) a. /ɔtpidɔ/

[woptium] [naptiɔt] [iptinda] [iptin] [iptit]

‘banana’ ‘sweet potato’ ‘companion’ ‘her brother’ ‘her younger sister’

The ludlingant [-pt-] has other variants, such as [-kt-] and [-tt-].

(245) a. /ɯun/ b. /ugɔnɡɔm/ c. /itutun/

→ ɯ-kt-un → u-kt-ɔnɡɔm → i-tt-un97

[ɯktun] [uktɜnɡom]96 [itːun]

‘my food’ ‘men’ ‘her vagina’

Other variants seem to be systematic, being allomorphs of [-pt-]. One of them is

[-ht-], which occurs in few a words that have an alveolar consonant, such as /d/, /l/, /n/,

and /t/, following the first vowel of the base word:98

(246) a. b. c. d.

/matɛ/ /kɯdɛn/ /malɔn/ /muni/

→ ma-ht-ɛ → kɯ-ht-ɛn → ma-ht-ɔn → mu-ht-i

[mahte] [kɯhten] [mahtɔn]99 [muhti]100

‘let’s go!’ ‘cassava’ ‘that’s ok’ ‘brother’

But as can be seen above (example (239e-i)), alveolar consonants, such as /l/, /ɾ/, /n/,

/t/, and /d/, are also replaced by the form /-pt-/. One other variant is that the voiced

coronal stop /d/ also occurs replacing alveolar consonants, such as /ɾ/ and /l/.

(247) a. /aɾun/
b. /jɔɾu/ c. /malon/

→ a-d-un → jɔ-d-u → ma-d-on

[adun] [jɔdu] [madon]101

‘howler monkey’ ‘tortoise’ ‘that’s okay’

Here the alveolar consonants are liquids. But as was seen, there are liquids which are

replaced by the form /-pt-/ as well (see (239e and f)). Again the motivation to the

96 Here the speaker used [ɜ] instead of [o]. 97 In this example an extra syllable deletes. The expected form is [iptutun]. This is the only example where the OPC violation does not result in deletion from the first consonant onward. 98 However, there are examples where alveolar consonants are replaced by [-pt-], such as /mate/ → [mapte] ‘you can go’, /wɔtɔmɔ/ → [wɔptɔmõ] ‘tapir’, /ɛduɛt/ → [eptuet] ‘his/her hammock’, /manaŋ/ → [maptaŋ] ‘a coconut bug’. 99 The form [madon] was also attested (see example (247c) below). 100 In Appendix 3, example (10), line C, there also exists the form [muptiŋmɔ] ‘brothers’. 101 The form [mahtɔn] was also attested (see example (246c)).
77

replacement triggered by the form /-d-/ instead of /-pt-/ seems not to be phonemic. There

are also examples where two replacements take place within a word:

(248) a. /i-ɛnaɾut/

→ iɛ-pt-a-d-ut

1Abs-sister

[ieptadut]

‘my (man) sister’

b. /i-manɔ/

→ i-pt-a-d-ɔ

3Abs-brother

[iptadɔ]

‘his younger brother’

In this case, the first replacement is with /-pt-/, which replaces the consonant that follows the first syllabic nucleus of the base word; the second replacement is with the

segment /-d-/, which replaces the alveolar sonorant that follows the second vowel of the

base word. It is not clear when the form /-d-/ has a primary or a secondary role.

The data presented so far are mainly monomorphemic. But this ludlingant, like the

other ones, can occur within polymorphemic words, such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives,

as can be seen in (249) below (see Appendices 3 and 4).

It can be seen above that the ludlingant /-pt-/ occurs in polymorphemic words, as it

does in monomorphemic ones, i.e., after the first syllabic nucleus of the base word. In this

sense, a vocalic sequence can be read as one vocalic cluster, if the first vowel of this

sequence is a prefix. If this first vowel is part of the stem, it is not considered a cluster

together with the following vowel (see example (238) above). Similarly to the other

ludlings, except for /pɔ-/, this ludlingant treats a prefix formed by two identical vowels as

one whole, being added after the last vowel of the prefix:

labeled in Arara [aɾun lumbanbɔt] ‘to make the tongue of a howler monkey’. The

linguistic process the Arara people use to build the howler monkey’s ludling is

phonological, i.e., the placement of nasalization on the vowels of the base words:

102 The expected form is [taptupa] (see Appendix 3, example (352d)).

To my ear, the nasalization here is slighltly weaker than the (allophonic) nasalization

that occurs on a vowel after a nasal consonant and before silence (see Section 3.1.1).

4.2.13 Tortoise Talk Tortoise are called [joɾu] in Arara. The ludling for this species of animals is labeled

in Arara [joɾu lumbanbot] ‘to make the tongue of a tortoise’. There is no morphological

process to form this ludling. Instead, there are two phonological processes used by the

Arara people to build the tortoise’s ludling: murmuring the whole base word, plus

lowering and/or fronting the first vowel, some vowels, or even all the vowels. In this

case, the optimal vowel to be achieved in Arara is [æ], which is at the same time the most

advanced and the lowest vowel. It is interesting to note that this vowel is not part of the

Arara phonemic inventory. Here are some examples:

This ludlingant, like the other ones, can occur within polymorphemic words, such as

nouns, verbs, and adjectives, as can be seen in (262) below (see Appendices 3 and 4).

4.3 Summary of the Ludlings In the Arara ludling constructions surveyed above, the most frequently used strategy
is to add prefixes to the base words, in a total of nine out of thirteen cases. Among the other four strategies, two involve the addition of an infix, one the addition of nasalization, and the last one the lowering and fronting of vowels, as well as murmuring. Below a

82

summary of all the ludlings described above is presented, with /abat/ ‘manioc bread’ as

the base word.

A summary of some of the phonological processes triggered by the addition of the

ludlingants to the base language forms is also presented. Some of these processes include

voice-voiceless contrast, neutralization of a voicing contrast, haplology, and quasi-

absence of haplology.

Ludlingant prefixes ending in a vowel show contrast among voice and voiceless stops

at the beginning of the following root. The ludlingant prefix ending in a nasal consonant

(/un-/) neutralizes this contrast, as can be seen in the first two columns in the chart above.

Ludlingants ending in a vowel, except /idi-/, trigger haplology. The ludlingant ending in a

83

nasal consonant (/un-/), with rare exceptions, does not feed haplology. The ludlingant /idi-/ does not trigger haplology like the other ludlingant prefixes ending in a vowel do. However, it has more examples triggering haplology than /un-/ does. To show this, it is placed between the column that causes haplology and the one which usually does not. The other ludlingants are not crucial for these phonological processes.
84

CHAPTER 5 CONCLUSION

In this thesis I have described thirteen different ludlings extant in the Arara language.

As can be seen, they are used only by some elderly Arara people living in the village of

Laranjal. And despite their large number, the ludlings fulfill a very restricted

sociolinguistic purpose: speaking to pets.

All ludlingants seem to occur with different word classes of the Arara base language.

There is even an example of /-ɡV-/ in an auxilary word: kɔɡɜlone niʧaɡah ‘leave it for

tomorrow’. In future research I intend to directly attempt to elicit ludlings in conjunction

with functional parts of speech such as postpositions, interjections, etc.

Based on the descriptions presented in this thesis, the ludlingants can be grouped in

six different ways:

(V)CV-

un-

-ɡV-

-pt-

nasalization fronting/murmuring

The first form above includes all of the prefixes except /un-/: /idi-/, /wi-/, /pɔ-/, /nɯ-/,

/pi-/, /tɔ-/, /eŋna-/, and /eŋnaɾa-/. These eight prefixes are grouped together because they

form a specific ludling class that shares a similar deletion process triggered on the stems

of the base language. The addition of the other five types of ludlingants also triggers

deletion and other phonological processes on the stems of the base language. Some of

these processes include copying of vowels, nasalization, murmur, and lateralization of

taps.

85

Sherzer (1982) claims that there are similarities and differences among the linguistic structures of play languages vs. ordinary languages. In Arara, these similarities include stress, syllable patterns, word order, ergativity, restrictions on consonant occurrence, etc. For the sake of illustration, the addition of the ludlingant /-pt-/ on monosyllabic words, such as /nu/, /wɔt/, and /kɔk/, would result in the unacceptable forms *nupt, *wɔptt, and *kɔptk, respectively. However, for these forms to accommodate the canonical Arara syllable pattern, the vowel from the syllable nucleus is copied directly after the ludlingant /-pt-/, resulting in /nuptu/, /wɔptɔt/, and /kɔptɔk/, respectively. Another example is the use of the allomorph bɯʧinɡɔm ‘our (incl.) leg’ instead of the allomorph -pʧingɔm. Using the latter would result in a sequence of three consonants, *[npʧ] and the consequently unacceptable form *unpʧinɡɔm, which violates Arara syllable structure. However, the use of the first allomorph produces the acceptable form [unbɯʧinɡɔm]. In addition to this, the ludling for capuchin monkeys has the same child speech substitution of a flap for a lateral, such as in /jɔɾu/ → [jɔlu] ‘tortoise’ (as stated above it was through this similarity that I came to know about these Arara ludlings).
Another important conclusion is that the Arara ludlings are different from the base language. For example, the alveolar stop of the ludlingant /-pt-/, used to address squirrel monkeys, does not undergo palatalization before the vowel /i/, as occurs in the base language. This can be illustrated with the base word /ibiɾinda/ ‘companion’, which after the addition of the ludlingant is realized as [iptinda], not *[ipʧinda]. Furthermore, in the normal Arara language there is no front low vowel [æ]. However, in the tortoise ludling this is the optimal vowel to be achieved.
Perhaps the Arara ludlings were developed in the early Arara culture because in their mythic past, animals played an important part, the capuchin monkey being the most
86

important. He did many things as the Arara mythic hero, including transforming the kapok tree branches into manioc and transforming a vine nodule into his younger brother. He and his younger brother are referred to as [pamdaŋmɔ], for which name I do not have a translation. I only know that the suffix [-ŋmɔ] marks the plural form. The agouti was the sister of the capuchin monkey; the tapir was his relative; the vulture was his friend.
In the mythic past, it was believed that the Arara people reproduced through eggs, like birds do. But Pamdaŋmɔ made them understand that there was another way. So it is not a surprise that the Arara people are extremely connected to their pets, even to the point of inventing a specialized way to address them.

Chart with Ludlings

In this appendix I present examples of ludling data in three large charts, with all

ludlingants using the same base words or sentences, to show all ludlings present in the

Arara language. I obtained these data through a broad phonetic transcription that I made

in 2010 on location in Laranjal village (see Chapter one and Chapter two). I recorded the

data from Tjimi Arara, a 73 year old male, after being authorized by him to do so. Since

he does not know how to read or write, I read aloud an Informed Consent document to

him. He agreed with the terms presented in the document and impressed his thumbprint

on it. We had several meetings. In the process of eliciting these data, I told him a base

word or a base sentence and asked him to say each ludling for that word or sentence. I

repeated the base word or sentence each time he was going to say a ludling. So these big

charts are formed from elicited data. Consequently, a few variations in the speaker’s

pronounciation were attested in this material, such as for the word ‘tree’, which seems not

to follow any pattern. I did not record these charts electronically, as I did for Appendix 4.

For each base word or sentence in the charts, there is a gloss. In this appendix there is a

table with isolated nominals, a table with isolated verbs, and a table with sentences.

Appendix 4 Recording of Ludlings In this appendix I present examples of ludling data in the context of larger syntactic units, including phrases, clauses, sentences, and discourse. I have transcribed (phonetically) these data based on recordings I made in 2010 on location in Laranjal village (see Introduction and Chapter one). The recordings were made using the program Audacity; the microphone used was a Galaxy Audio on an HDR2 (handheld digital recorder). The speaker is Tjimi Arara, a 73 year old male. I asked him to make up one story or conversation about each of the different ludlings. I suggested that he use the Arara base word /taupa/ ‘species of banana’ as a consistent topic for each one of these texts. Each ludling story in this appendix is separated into its own distinct table. Glosses of each individual morpheme appear right below the Arara forms (in the same cell), and a free translation is given in the column to the right. When I could not make out certain words that Tjimi said in the recordings, I use numbers in the free translation column to refer to the location in the Audacity file where that portion of speech occurs. It is noteworthy that Tjimi is the only Arara speaker who still remembers all thirteen ludling forms. Furthermore, he appears to be the only speaker who can fluently put these words together into larger utterances of this type, i.e., conversations. However, it is very evident in these recordings that he frequently hesitates, as though he finds the task difficult. In addition, the ludling which he hesitates with the most is the squirrel monkey ludling (see the third section below “Squirrel monkeys ludling”). All other Arara
105

speakers familiar with this ludling consistently form it by infixing /-pt-/ after the first vowel. Nevertheless, while Tjimi uses /-pt-/ in most cases, such as in this appendix, he sometimes changes this empty morpheme to /-kt-/, or even /-tt-/, as in Appendix 3.

Appendix 5:

Flora and Fauna Identification

In this appendix I present the flora and fauna mentioned in this thesis in alphabetical order by the Arara term. The second column gives an English gloss, the third column a

probable (but not certain) scientific identification, and the fourth column the local

Portuguese terms. The scientific names are not the result of scientific studies nor were

they provided by an expert, but rather based on my personal research using the internet,

comparing photographs and descriptions there with my personal experience in the Arara

area. They should not be taken as certain identifications but simply as aids for future

researchers.
