Preface
AFTER CENTURIES OF reckless exploitation of the Amazonian rain-
forest and an unprecedented persecution of its native inhabitants, only a handful of indigenous groups have managed to hold on to their ancestral land and traditional ways. The Makuna, living in a remote part of the Colombian Amazon, are one such group. This book documents their vital traditions and dynamic society. Though focusing on a single people, the account has a more general relevance since the Makuna not only exemplify a type of culture that until recently was widespread in the Amazon, but also illustrate the current plight of countless other Amerindian peoples struggling to maintain their identity in a world of turbulent change.
This book is a preliminary version of ongoing work. I have spent exten-

sive periods among the Makuna since 1972, and the book draws together results of many years of work. My ambition is to provide a personal and accessible but ethnographically accurate account that conveys a sense of the richness and complexity of Makuna life and culture.
By way of introduction, the first part of the book sketches Makuna culture and society in broad outline, and recounts my own initiation into this seemingly strange world. Each of the subsequent parts deals with an important aspect of Makuna reality in greater detail: their natural surroundings, mode of subsistence, domestic environment, and ritual life. As a whole, the book focuses on the cultural dimension of Makuna reality, the notions they have about humanity and society, their perceptions of nature and reality at large, and the way this vision guides their everyday life.
The apparent material poverty of the Makuna belies the profundity of their thought and the spiritual richness of their culture. The Makuna endow their land with mythical significance and sacred value, which makes living 4 intensely meaningful and gratifying. Powerfully expressed in myth and ritual, this enchantment of nature not only gives their life an almost poetic quality, but also turns their mode of livingthe daily chores of hunting, fishing, and swidden cultivationinto a carefully integrated system of resource management, worthy of our attention.
Today the Makuna and their heritage are more than ever threatened by powerful forces beyond their control. The last part of the text describes the gold rush presently sweeping through the Amazon and its particular effects on Makuna society. Following in the wake of the early-century rubber hunters and the recent coca barons, gold-miners now encroach on their ancestral lands, defile their sacred places, cut down forest, and pollute rivers. The Makuna fear that these menacing events forebode a catastrophic end of the world.
Implied in this apocalyptic vision is a tacit but powerful critique of Western industrial civilization. With their gentle wisdom the Makuna, along with

other indigenous peoples, embody a radically different kind of humanity and an alternative vision of the world, suppressed but not yet eradicated by modernity. This book is offered as a testimony to one of these unobtrusive but resilient cultures in the hope that it may challenge some of the readers deeprooted notions of reality and stimulate critical reflection on the current conditions of the world at large.

CHAPTER ONE
Entering the Makuna World
TO THE CASUAL visitor, the immense forest of the north-west-
ern Amazon may seem a wild and perilous country. Yet, for the Makuna Indians it is not only their home and source of livelihood, but also their fount of cultural inspiration and creative imagination. The rain-forest environment has nurtured their particular philosophy of life and vision of the world, as different from ours in spirit as the forest is from the city. Only by suspending the ingrained truths of our civilization, can we perceive reality the Makuna way.
In their world every tangible form is more than it appears. The visible world of ordinary experience also has an invisible and intangible dimension

that the Makuna refer to as hethe world of powerful spirits and deified ancestors. In this other dimension of reality, rocks and rivers are alive, and animals and plants are people. The shaman, at the same time human and super-human, has the capacity to see beyond the world of appearance and into this timeless and changeless spirit world. Known through myth, and controlled through ritual, the he world contains the primordial powers of creation that ultimately governs the present. Through their rituals and shamanic acts the Makuna continuously enlist these powers to maintain life and renew cosmic order.
Theirs is a boundless universe of continuities and relatedness, in which rivers and forest, humans and animals, the living and the dead form part of a total and encompassing community. The past and the present coexist, and our distinction between nature and culture dissolves and looses its meaning. The following pages take the reader on a journey into this reality of strange beauty and unsettling wisdom. Along the way, some of its darker sides will 6 also become evidentthe turbulent history of the region and the powerful challenges currently faced by its native inhabitants.
First Visit
Makuna territory comprises a stretch of densely forested land along the lower Apaporis and Pirá-Paraná rivers in the Vaupés region of eastern Colombia, near the Brazilian border. In 1971, when still a young anthropology student, I first visited a group of Makuna living on the Komenya river, a western tributary of the Pirá-Paraná. At the time the Makuna were little known and only rarely visited by missionaries and traders. To reach their territory was a difficult and not altogether safe endeavour. Starting out from Mitú, the regional capital of Vaupés, and travelling with local Indians, recruited as guides

along the way, the journey took about ten days of paddling and trekking. We ascended an upstream tributary of the Vaupés, then crossed the watershed between the Vaupés and Apaporis drainage systems, and entered the middle Pirá-Paraná river through one of its principal affluents, the rusty Colorado river.
Below the confluence of the Colorado and Pirá-Paraná rivers there was a Catholic mission post where I rested for a few days before continuing the journey down the Pirá-Paraná together with two Barasana boys. The PiráParaná, or WaiyaFish Riverin Makuna, is a blackwater river, originating in the sandy upland soils of the watershed between the Vaupés and Apaporis rivers.1 Its waters are dark, clean, and poor in nutrients. Yet, its aquatic fauna and the forest it drains sustain a scattered population of perhaps a thousand Indians or more, living along its shores and tributaries. Travelling down the Pirá-Paraná we passed only a handful of settlements. Then, as now, most Indians lived along the smaller tributaries.
The many falls and rapids have contributed to the inaccessibility of the Pirá-Paraná area and its relative isolation from the rest of the Vaupés region. Steering through one of these rapids, I saw for the first time the sacred petroglyphs at Nyi. Consisting of various engravings on an erect rock in the middle of the riverstylized anthropomorphic and geometrical figures they are said to depict the decorated body of a mythical being called Nyi, the ancestral anaconda of the Taiwano people, who turned into stone as he danced in his underwater house beneath the rocks in the midst of the river.
A few hours paddling distance downstream from Nyi the yellowish water of the Komenya flows into the dark current of the Pirá-Paraná. Just above its mouth there is a magnificent waterfall, below which a pool of still water is formed, covered with foam and floating debris. A multitude of large, intensely azure morpho butterflies fluttered over the calm surface as we entered the Komenya river in bright sunlight. Paddling hard against the strong current, we then passed a series of difficult rapids, the last of which was called

Thunder after a huge dark boulderanother petrified ancestral beingrising above the surface of the river. Just above the rapids we encountered the first Makuna maloca, the traditional Indian longhouse. Its owner and headman, an old man called Luis, received us with customary hospitality and invited us into the cool, shady interior. We had an austere meal of dry, white manioc bread, hot, black pepper sauce, and manioc juice before we hurried on. Luis told to us continue upstream to the maloca of Ignacio, the headman and local leader of the Komenya Makuna. I was made to understand that Ignacio was the appropriate person to receive a stranger such as me.
In the late afternoon, as the river took on the sombre green colour of the surrounding forest, we eventually reached the headmans settlement. At the canoe landing a swarm of yellow butterflies exploded into flight as we jumped ashore. From there I could see the silhouette of Ignacios majestic maloca, encircled by towering peach palms, groves of plantains and other fruit trees. A soft, rhythmic sound of women grating manioc and men pounding coca 7 leaves emanated from the maloca, and a group of children came running down the path to meet us. The entire scene radiated an atmosphere of familiarity and warm hospitality, and as we walked towards the house, I had the strange but comforting feeling of coming home.
That first evening among the Makuna, I tried to explain the reason for my presence. Ignacio himself turned out to be away on a long river journey, but his teenage son, Venancio, who had spent several years in a missionary boarding school, received us and acted as translator as I told my story in Spanish to the assembled people. Drawing a comparison with Venancios years in school when he and other Indian children learnt Spanish among the Whites, I said I wished to live among themthe Makunato learn their language and way of life. There is a lot you can teach me, I said, Indians and Whites ought to learn from one another. Only then can we begin to understand each other. My words may now sound idealistic and rhetorical, but I honestly meant them then and still do today.

No doubt for other, more mundane reasons than those I invoked, the people of Ignacios maloca accepted me among them. I soon realized that to many of them I represented, above all, a potential source of trade goods and a link to the world of the Whites. Only gradually did I begin to see that Makuna elders also interpreted my presence in a different, more subtle way. Thus, after some months when I had mastered some Makuna, an old man said to me, in the typical frank manner of the elders: It is good that you have come, we had been expecting you... This seemingly cryptic utterance was evidently a response to my words on the eve of my arrival. They knew that they had something to teach me, and my arrival confirmed, as it were, their conviction. In my initial discourse I had also unwittingly invoked the principle of reciprocity so central to Makuna life. According to their way of thought, the fact that some Makuna, like Venancio, had been to school and worked among the Whites almost implied that Whites also would come to stay among them. In this sense I was thus expected.
Looking back, however, it now seems to me that the old mans cryptic comment also revealed an awareness of the value of their own culture, which other Makuna would later formulate in a different way: The Whites only see with their eyes, but we can see with our mind, meaning that through shamanic thinking and chanting, and through participation in rituals they can enter a worldthe invisible he worldwhich is closed to us Whites. To obtain this minds eye became the ultimate objective of my stay among them and they generously accepted to teach me. Now, twenty years later, I realize I will never attain this objective, but I believe I have caught at least a glimpse of that other, distinctly Makuna, reality.
***
Ignacios maloca became my home for the better part of the coming two years. Here I was offered a place to sling my hammock and store my goods. Throughout my first stay in Komenya, from 1972 through 1974, Ignacio and

his two wives always shared their food generously with me and patiently took the time and trouble to initiate me into the apparent mysteries of Makuna culture. In return I brought them desired goods and needed medicines. I think it is no exaggeration to say that over the years we forged bonds of friendship, which have allowed me to return time and again to Komenya.
Subsisting by shifting cultivation, fishing, hunting and the gathering of wild forest foodsincluding frogs and edible insectsthe Makuna lead an austere but deeply gratifying life. The daily chores were largely determined by the rhythms of nature, the breeding and harvest seasons of animals and plants, and punctuated by frequent rituals, small and large, celebrating the abundance of food and the life-cycle events of Makuna individuals. In their lives the cosmic blended with the social and the individual, and the sacred was always a part of the mundane and the practical.
Makuna men and women manufactured and used most of the traditional tools and artifacts, including baskets, pottery, blowguns, bows and arrows, 8 and fish spears. The implements and other goods that they needed but could not produce themselves, such as fish hooks, nylon lines, knives, axes, metal pots, and clothes, were obtained from traders who occasionally travelled up the Pirá-Paraná and Apaporis rivers. To acquire trade goods they sold or bartered with hides and manioc flour, farinha, or worked periodically for White rubber patrons and merchants on the Mirití and upper Apaporis rivers. Several men had spent many yearssome up to ten or fifteen yearsas employees of White patrons. Yet, in the early 1970s, the world of the Whites seemed rather remote to the people of Komenya; the sporadic and transient encounters they had with traders and missionaries were unobtrusive. There was no school, no shop, no chapel or church in their territory, and the nearest White settlements were La Pedrera on the Caquetá river and Mitú on the Vaupés river, both several weeks paddleand-walking distance away.
With relatively simple tools, handled with competence and an impressive knowledge of the local environment, the Makuna thus gained their living.

Their food consisted mainly of manioc bread, fish, and meat, supplemented by vegetables, fruits, nuts, and insects. A measure as good as any of their dietary standard was that, during my prolonged stay among them, I never went hungry for long, nor suffered any serious deficiency or illness.
Fifteen Years Later
In 1988, more than fifteen years after my first visit, I returned to Komenya. The population was now regrouped in three nucleated villages, and only a few big, traditional malocas remained. In each village there were a small school house and a chapel built by the inhabitants themselves, and in onethe largest, called Santa Isabelthere was also a shop and a rudimentary but functioning airstrip. Local teachers, paid by the Catholic mission, now provide elementary instruction in Spanish. The children learn to read, write and count, and mission-trained catechists give a simple religious service every Sunday in the chapel.
The village has brought a new authority structure to the local community. The headmen of the few remaining malocas are still influential in local politics, but each village now also has its capitan, appointed by the community members and recognized by the regional authorities as the official spokesman of the village. Though this position is new, those who occupy it are senior men of traditional standingprestigious headmen and shamans. Thus, the old and the new blend in the emergent power structure of the village communities.
The increased presence of the State and the Church in the communities, visible in the proliferation of new civic and religious functionariesincluding village headmen, schoolteachers, catechists, village secretaries, health promoters, and representatives of local development committees and youth clubs, has also entailed a greater measure of Indian self determination in the region.

In the late 1970s a considerable part of the Vaupés region was thus declared resguardoa protected area guaranteeing the Indians legal rights to their traditional lands. Though a momentous improvement of their juridical status in the national context, most Makuna are unaware of the full significance of the new legislation.
On the surface, daily life appears much the same today as in the early 1970s. The men still fish and hunt while the women work in the manioc gardens. The rhythm, pattern and techniques of subsistence are unaltered. Yet the local economy has undergone great changes since then. A drastic decline in the fur trade as a result of increasing government restrictions and a short-lived revival of the rubber economy in the mid-1970s induced many young men to seek temporary employment with White rubber patrons and traders.
One young man, Bere, who lives in a small community in the headwaters of Komenya, told me on my return that he and his family had suffered many 9 hardships since I left. From where could we get our trade goods when you had gone?, he exclaimed. We were poor, very poor. Together with his younger brother he therefore went to work for a White rubber patron, known as Monolopez, on the upper Apaporis. They worked for two years but then ran away from the camp. We could not stand it any more, he said, and showing me a long scar on his left arm he continued: My boss struck me here with his machete, almost cutting my arm off. He beat and mistreated us all the time. We worked hard, from before dawn to long after dark. Sometimes we returned to camp only after midnight, and still he hit us. When Bere and his brother saw an opportunity they escaped and returned home by river. Bere was full of resentment when he told his story, but also proud of the trade goods he had acquired at the rubber camp. Look here, he said, pointing at his tattered pair of trousers and worn-out shirt, this is what I brought from the camp. He also brought the hammocks he and his family sleep in, the machete and the axe he works with, and a set of cooking pots for his wife.

Apart from the small house they live in and Beres two canoes, these are the greater part of their material possessions.
Several other Makuna men shared Beres experiences. After several years in the rubber camps for patrons like Monolopez, some secured a fair share of trade goods while others ran away or returned heavily in debt. To defend themselves against the rubber patrons and avoid being forced to go back to the labour camps, the people on Komenya in the late 1970s decided to join together and form village communities. Encouraged by the Catholic mission, they founded the village of Santa Isabel on the lower Komenyawhere Ignacio and his brothers and brothers-in-law now liveand subsequently the two other upstream communities of Santa Rosa and Puerto Amazonas. The formation of administrative villages, endorsed by the regional authorities in Mitú, allowed the Indians to defend their interests against the unjust exploitation on the part of the rubber patrons.
However, the need for a constant supply of trade goods remained. When, a few years later, the coca trade reached the Pirá-Paraná region, it was embraced by the Indians as a new means of obtaining coveted trade goods. The Makuna and their neighbours traditionally cultivated and used the leaves of the coca plant as a mild stimulant and an important ritual substance. The onset of the drug trade now turned the plant also into a lucrative commercial crop, serving as raw material for chemically refined cocaine. In the early 1980s the coca boom engaged almost all young men in the area. Much of the traditional garden land turned into coca plantations. The young men cultivated the plants and transported the harvested leaves to White buyerscoqueros who had established themselves on the upper Pirá-Paraná. Successful Indians obtained great quantities of trade goods. A few even employed fellow Indians on their plantations and sold trade goods for profit in the community. Shotguns, transistor radios, wrist-watches, and outboard motors now flooded Makuna territory, and with each item the external world drew nearer.
The coca trade created new economic opportunities but also tensions and

cleavages in the community. Like most forces of change, it was experienced as both a blessing and a burden. Some men spent most of their time cultivating coca for sale and in the process neglected their families. Conflicts surfaced during drinking brawls, which now became part of community life as liquor and crack, basuco, found its way into the villages. There was also an outflux of young men going to work for coqueros in various parts of Colombia. Many learned a rudimentary Spanish, and new values crept into the communities. As a result, many young Makuna are now more interested in the world and goods of the Whites than in their own traditions.
The coca boom declined as suddenly as it rose. In the mid-1980s the PiráParaná Indians stopped trading coca leaves and the coqueros left the area. The abrupt end of the trade was apparently a combined result of a fall in the black market price, pressures from the Catholic mission, and prosecution by the civil authorities. Soon life in Komenya reverted to the rhythm and pattern of the pre-boom days. The young men who returned from their working so- 10 journs in different parts of the country married local girls and settled down in their natal communities. Returning to Komenya in 1988, I was impressed by the fact that practically all recent marriages followed the traditional pattern of exchange among close relatives.
Ritual life is not only intact but seems to have intensified as a reaction against the mounting pressures from the outside. Many of the rituals performed during my earlier stay are now conducted with renewed fervour. Beneath the overt changes in settlement pattern, the traditional structure of kinship and marriage relations remain surprisingly unchanged. Makuna culture seems to provide a remarkably stable framework of ideas and concepts in terms of which current events are interpreted and validated. What happens today is perceived in terms of the mythical sayings and doings of the ancestors. Conversely, traditional notions are reshaped and given new meanings by current experiences. In this way the Makuna try to make sense out of a changing reality and enable themselves to control and direct it. Nurtured

by the past, Makuna cultureas portrayed in this bookis thus vigorously alive in the present.
Traces of the Past
The changes in Makuna society witnessed over the past twenty years are, of course, only the latest in a much longer history. By the mid 18th century, Spanish and Portuguese explorers had already traversed the interfluvial forests between the Vaupés and Apaporis riversprobably following the course of the Pirá-Paraná river. By then soldiers and slave raidersbandeirantes had been harrying the native groups in the region for a century or more. Indians were captured and forced to work on colonial plantations along the major rivers, and traders and backwoodsmen crossed the forest in search of quinine bark, sarsaparilla, vanilla, chocolate, indigo, and rubber. New diseases, against which Indians had little resistance, followed in the wake of the colonization process. As a result, the native population of the Vaupés and upper Rio Negro was severely depleted and at the end of the 19th century entire sections of the rivers were depopulated.
Little is known about the first contacts between Indians and Whites in the Pirá-Paraná area. The Makuna are first mentioned in the chronicles of the Portuguese explorer Ferreira, who in 1775-76 reports of Mucuna settlements along the Apaporis river. But it was not until the turn of the present century that the German ethnographer Theodor Koch-Grünberg, who travelled the Pirá-Paraná and Apaporis rivers, provided the first detailed and reliable description of the Indian groups in the region. He not only mentions various Makuna-speaking groups but also visited and described the location of several malocas where Makuna communities are still found today.
During Koch-Grünbergs travels, the great rubber boom had reached the Northwest Amazon. The terror and turmoil it caused would continue well

into the 1920s and leave its scars on all Indian communities in the region. Though the most affected part was the Caquetá and Putumayo river basin south of the Vaupés river, the destructive impact of the rubber boom was also felt among the Makuna and their neighbours. Thousands of Indians were forced to work for White rubber barons, and those who fled from the rubber camps were hunted down and brutally executed. Groups which resisted the initial raids were massacred. During the first decade of the present century some 40,000 Indiansprobably more than half of the Indian population in the entire Northwest Amazondied as a consequence of the activities of rubber companies such as the infamous Casa Arana, later renamed the Peruvian Amazon Company. In the 1920s the Amazonian rubber industry drastically declined as more competitive rubber plantations developed in South East Asia. Yet, petty rubber patrons continued to exploit Indians in the Northwest Amazon up to the mid 1970s.

Makuna historical traditions tell of a time before the arrival of the Whites when raiding and warfare were common among the tribal groups in the region. In stories and legends they recall countless battles with their traditional enemies, the Tanimuka and Yauna on the Apaporis. These violent conflicts seem to have been motivated by their cosmological and shamanic traditions rather than by any competition for scarce resources or political dominion. To the Makuna, the Tanimuka and Yauna were jaguar people, sorcerers and evil spirit beings, posing a threat to society and cosmic order in general. The shamans of the different peoples were said to send disease, misfortune and death to their enemies. The Makuna of today can point to sites where battles were fought and enemy groups defeated. They say that at one point the Yauna were all but exterminated but eventually saved by a powerful Makuna shaman who pitied them and decided to cease the hostilities. As a result, the Makuna and the decimated remains of the Yauna people today

intermarry peacefully. These tribal wars were a prominent part of indigenous life in the history
of the region. For defence purposes settlements were much larger in the past a single maloca could hold a hundred or more peopleand war-leaders occasionally exercised considerable power over entire territories. The Makuna, just as the neighbouring Tukanoan groups, still have a hierarchical ideology of chiefs, chanters, warriors, shamans and servants, which contrasts with their current egalitarian political practice. It is possible that this political ideology was occasionally put into practice in the past as influential local leaders became powerful chiefs, subjugating enemy groups which together with war captives were reclassified as servants or slaves. These speculative observations are not altogether improbable in the light of our present historical knowledge about the Amazon valley. Thus warlike chiefdoms, ruled by great chiefs, and organized into ranked strata of aristocrats, priests, warriors, and servants, did exist in the upper and central Amazon valley at the time of the Spanish and Portuguese conquest. Perhaps then, the imaginary chiefdom, implied by the Makuna political ideology, mirrors these real, 16th-century Amazonian chiefdoms?
***
The personal memories of old living Makuna individuals stretch back to the turn of the century, when White rubber hunters and traders began to enter the Pirá-Paraná area from Brazil and Peru. Their appearance caused unrest among the Indians and resulted in a chain of population moves from the Apaporis and lower Pirá-Paraná rivers to the more inaccessible tributaries and headwaters. In the early decades of this century Ignacios grandfather and his family thus moved with other Makuna from their homeland on the Toaca, a tributary of the lower Pirá-Paraná river, to the upper reaches of Komenya to escape the incursions of the rubber hunters. But the Whites came after them, pursuing the Indians even to the most remote parts and

raiding them for their labour force. Below the present village site of Santa Isabel there is a hill known as the Port of the Whites where rubber hunters once had a fortified camp to keep the captured Indians imprisoned. As a result of incessant raiding and harassment, the Indians were decimated and the survivors moved still deeper into the forest.
In the 1940s, when Ignacio was a child, times had changed. The rubber economy was on the decline after a short resurge during the Second World War, and the brute violence of earlier decades had been replaced by a more refined system of debt bondage. Small scale rubber patrons and merchants tempted the Indians with trade goods which later had to be paid by labour in the rubber campsa system surviving into the 1970s. For a pair of trousers, a shirt, and a handkerchief, Ignacios father had to work for two years on a camp on the Apaporis, andIgnacio told meever since profoundly resented the Whites. When the regional authorities urged the Pirá-Paraná Indians to move down on the Apaporis to provide a more manageable labour 12 force in the post-war rubber industry, the Makuna group headed by Ignacios father refused to heed the call.
Instead he withdrew deeper into the headwaters of the Komenya to avoid contact. Since he did not want his children to learn Spanish, he also refused to send his children to any of the mission schools that had begun to appear in various parts of the Vaupés region at the time. That is why we lived hidden in the forest and why I never learnt to speak any Spanish, Ignacio explained. Indeed, it was Ignacio himself who decided to move from the headwaters of Komenya to its lower reaches, and to renew the contacts with White traders and missionaries in the 1950s. He also decided to send one of his sons, Venancio, to the mission school in La Pedrera on the Caquetá river, as the first Makuna from Komenya to attend school and learn Spanish. Now several of Ignacios sons speak Spanish and know how to read and write. Yet he has kept some of his children from school in a conscious effort to reduce the influence from the outside world in order to strengthen old Makuna tradi-

tions. Thus, one of his sons currently trains to become a shaman and a chanter like Ignacio himself.
Other Makuna tell similar stories about the early contacts with the Whites. When Joaquín, now a middle-aged headman living in a traditional-style maloca on the Apaporis, was a young boy, a White rubber hunter came to his fathers maloca on the Toaca and took him to a work camp on the upper Apaporis. After several years of hard labour, Joaquíns fatherlike so many other Indian rubber workersdeserted the camp and returned home. Some time later, when the patron came to round up defectors and recruit more men to his camp, he was ambushed and killed. Fearing retaliation, many Indians went into hiding in the forest and headwaters of the Pirá-Paraná, while others, like Joaquíns father and his family, moved down on the Apaporis to seek protection under other, less brutal patrons. In this way, the lower Apaporis, which had been virtually depopulated since the first violent impact of the rubber boom at the turn of the century, began to be repopulated in the 1940s and 50s. In a sense, Makuna families, such as Joaquíns, reclaimed ancestral land since the Apaporis is the mythical birth place of their clan ancestors.
***
Although the Catholic mission has a long history in the Colombian Vaupés its presence was only intermittent in the Pirá-Paraná area until the 1970s. There were sporadic missionary activities along the Vaupés and Apaporis rivers since the mid-18th century. The Portuguese explorer Ferreira reported various mission villages along the Apaporis in 1776. From the 1850s Carmelite and Franciscan missionaries made repeated attempts to civilize and concentrate the Indians on the Vaupés and its principal tributaries into nucleated settlements. Mission villages were founded but soon abandoned due to strong resistance from the Indians and local White traders who felt their dominion of the area threatened. Only in the first decades of the present century, the Salesians and Montfortians gained a permanent foot-hold in the Vaupés region. Continuing the work of their predecessors, they regrouped the Indians

in mission villages, burned malocas, and suppressed ancient rituals. The

Javerianos replaced the Montfortians in the Colombian Vaupés in 1949 and

have since largely controlled both the missionary activities and the secular

education in the region.

In the late 1960s Bible translators of the Summer Institute of Linguis-

ticsa branch of the Wycliffe Bible Societyalso entered the scene, estab-

lishing themselves among most Indians groups in the region. They made

contact with the Makuna and opened an airstrip on the Komenya in the early

1970s. From then on a family of translators has worked and intermittently

lived among the Makuna. The activities of the Summer Institute of Linguis-

tics, consisting mainly of Bible translation and linguistic workamong other,

the creation of simplified indigenous orthographieshave been less conspi-

cuous in the region than the more direct and concrete social transformations

brought about by the Catholic mission during its two centuries of active

presence in Vaupés.

13

Today the missionary strategies of the Catholic Church have changed and

become more sensitive to the needs and cultural values of the Indians. The

influence on the indigenous communities in the Pirá-Paraná area is pervasive

and increasing. Indeed, many of the changes apparent in Komenya since my

first visit are the result of one dynamic individual, Father Elorza. Travelling

the rivers and trails of the Pirá-Paraná area for more than twenty years, he

has been instrumental in encouraging the Indians to regroup into nucleated

villages, to build schools and chapels, and to open up airstrips and cut trails

through the forest, thus connecting the different villages with one another

and with the outside world. The success of his labours among the Indians

has, however, depended less on the promise of spiritual returns than the ma-

terial rewards his projects have brought in the form of remunerated work

and improved access to trade goods.

For the missionaries the image of prosperity seems to be a village with a

school and a chapel, a shop and an airstrip to bring in trade goods and medi-

cal aid. Yet, while the urge for progress is heeded by the young, there is among the elders a growing apprehension that something is amiss and lost along the path to progress. They fear that the young, who increasingly attend mission schools and traffic the new trails to the towns of Mitú and La Pedrera, are in the process of losing their roots and identity. As their territory is opened up to the forces of progress, more seems to be lost than gained. The trails that now bring trade goods to the villages eventually threaten to drain the spiritual sources of their culture.
Indians of the Vaupés
The Makuna are one of some fifteen Indian groups in the Vaupés region of the Colombian Amazon speaking a language of the Eastern Tukano language family and sharing a set of fundamental cultural features. The Colombian Vaupés, delimited by the Vaupés river and its tributaries in the north and the Apaporis river in the south, comprises between 15-20 000 Indians, mainly Eastern Tukano speakers, but also some Arawak-speaking groups and scattered Makú communities. The Tukanoan and Arawakan groups are all riverine and sedentary, subsisting on shifting cultivation, fishing, hunting, and the gathering of wild forest foods. Manioc is the staple crop and fish provide the bulk of the protein in the diet. In contrast, the semi-nomadic Makú, living in small, mobile camps of the interfluvial forest, depend more heavily on hunting and gathering. They occasionally attach themselves as servant groups to the riverine Tukanoans, hunting for their hosts in return for cultivated plant food. Though most Makú groups today also cultivate their own swiddens, they are still considered an inferior category of people. The Makuna call them josa masa, which means servants or the last-born.
The Pirá-Paraná area in the heartland of the Vaupés region harbours a mosaic of small Indian groups speaking different Tukano languages. The clos-

est neighbours of the Makuna are the Barasana, Taiwano, Tatuyo, Bará, and Tuyuka, all with a similar social organization and sharing a basic vision of the world as expressed in myth and ritual. Each group is sub-divided into a ranked set of patrilineal clans, reckoning descent on the fathers side from a named, mythical figure described as an ancestral anaconda. Such a group of brother clans is exogamous and ideally speaks a distinct language. According to the general Tukanoan pattern, a man should marry a woman speaking a different languagea custom known as linguistic exogamy. In actual practice, however, there is no absolute fit between the language group and the exogamous group. The Makuna, along with the Cubeo on the northern banks of the Vaupés river, provide exceptions to the rule, since they intermarry among different clans speaking the same language.
The Makuna however closely correspond to another general Tukanoan marriage idealthat of sister exchangeaccording to which a man exchanges his sister for a wife. Obviously a man does not always have a sister to 14 exchange, perhaps because he never had one, or because his elder brothers already exchanged them for wives. There are two ways for a man deprived of a sister to resolve this very real and sometimes acute dilemma. One, he may either try to marry a cousin for free, as it were, on the assumption that the debt will be cancelled out over time. This is the most common solution; after all, marrying a cousin means having ones uncle and aunt for parents-inlaw. The other solution is both more dramatic and risky, as it involves the capture of an unrelated woman from another group and territory. This option, usually described as bride capture, becomes necessary if the man neither has an exchangeable sister, nor a marriageable cousin. Raids for women among neighbouring and distant groups were probably not uncommon in the past, and may still occur today. I witnessed the prelude and aftermath of one such raid in 1972 when staying in Ignacios maloca. The story is worth telling since it gives a close-up view of life on Komenya:
In the middle of the night I was awakened by the noise of shouting men.

As fires were kindled and a torch went aflame in the centre of the maloca, I could see Paulo, Ignacios nephew, screaming and gesticulating with rage. Frightened and not yet fully awake I turned to Venancio, who slept in a hammock nearby, asking what was going on. He explained that one of Paulos sisters, who had earlier been given away in an exchange marriage, had returned during the night. Her husband, a Barasana man living in the adjacent Umunya territory, had maltreated her and she had run away from him to seek protection with her brother. Paulo had now come to summon his clansmen for revenge action.
Well before dawn, Paulo left the maloca with a group of young men on a retaliatory bride capturing raid. At noon they were back with two very young Barasana girls from the Umunya territory. The girls were brusquely dragged to the house, where one of them was immediately allotted as wife to Chico, a young bachelor, while Paulo took the other girl to his own house a distance downstream. For the first day and night the girl in Ignacios maloca neither spoke nor moved. In the evening the women in the house approached her. They sat down by her side and talked to her softly. Chico also tried to talk to her but she did not respond. The second day she accepted some food from the other women. That night Chico offered her his hammock and she accepted it, while he himself slept on a palm-leaf mat on the ground. Ignacio blessed water for Chico to drink so that he would be able to make love to her. Just as game brought by the hunter from the forest must be blessed before eaten, I was told, captured women have to be shamanized before men can safely have intercourse with them.
On the third day I was again roused before dawn by an alarming stir in Ignacios maloca. A group of four Barasana men from Umunya, all armed with shotguns, blowpipes and machetes, turned up at the front of the house. Pushing up the thatched door, they stopped silent in the doorwayfour menacing shadows against the misty background. With a strained calm Ignacio went up to greet them in the formalized way strangers usually greet one

another, but they remained silent. The entire maloca breathed tension. The women retired to the rear and some left through the back door. Ignacio urged the strangers to enter and sit down to talk in the manner of men. One of them, apparently their leader, stiffly stepped in and sat down on a stool in front of Ignacio while the other stayed outside, weapons in hand. Inside, the men of Ignacios maloca remained seated in their hammocks. Two Makuna men from a neighbouring maloca, evidently summoned by the women, arrived, entering through the back door. Ignacio prepared a cigar and offered some coca to the Barasana man who had entered. A lengthy, sometimes heated, ceremonial dialogue followed and within an hour the matter was settled. Ignacio agreed to return the Barasana girls immediately, but Paulos sister would stay with her brother in Komenya. Her marriage was thus dissolved. The Barasana men got their kinswomen back but lost a wife.
One of the Barasana men now went up to their kinswoman in the house. The girl stood close to Chico, who apprehensively lay in his hammock. Dur- 15 ing the entire scene Chico had remained quiet. The Barasana man called the girlhis niecebut she neither answered nor moved. Apparently she did not want to leave. The man then resolutely went up to her, grabbed her arm, and dragged her towards the doorin the very same way that her abductors a few days earlier must have taken her from her home. While Ignacio and his kinsmen sat still and silent, the Barasana girl was thus returnedby force and against her willto her home on the Umunya river.
These events not only illustrate the precarious relationship between intermarrying clans and the unequal status of men and women in Makuna societywhere men as husbands and brothers can be both exceedingly aggressive and overprotective, but also points to the fundamental importance of the relationship of reciprocity in their culture. As will become evident in the course of this book, the principle of exchange influences every aspect of Makuna society; it permeates their ideas about nature and cosmos, and structures the activities of everyday life.

***
Traditionally, and to a significant extent still, life in the Pirá-Paraná area revolves around the maloca as the fundamental social and political unit. The headman and owner of the maloca is always a senior member of the clan group inhabiting it. Since there exist no hereditary offices among the Tukanoans, the status as headman is open to any resourceful and ambitious man. The exemplary headman is industrious and wise, well versed in traditions and known for his ritual expertise. His authority rests on his success in guiding and protecting his following; if he fails to live up to expectations his following simply disperse. At times, particularly influential headmen succeed in gaining authority over a larger group of people, sometimes an entire territory. Since ritual knowledge is a major political resource, struggle for power usually takes the form of the competitive staging of large-scale, communal rituals.
In terms of control over material resources, Tukanoan society is strikingly egalitarian and undifferentiated. Its elaborate complexity most clearly shows in its ritual organization and spiritual life. In Pirá-Paraná each locality has its officiating shamans, ritual chanters, and dancers. The shaman, called kumu or yailiterally jaguarin Makuna, has direct access to the invisible he world. He communicates with the spirits, supervises rituals, and uses his mental powers to prevent and cure illness. In curing, the shaman blows spells and sucks out pathogenic substancesusually envisioned as darts (waka)from his victims bodies, but never uses medical plants or other material medicines. The chanter, yuamuthe voice or spokesman of the shaman, and the master dancer, baya, exercise their specialist roles only in the context of the many communal rituals, which are performed to ensure cosmic order and protect the people from evil and misfortune.
Since every adult manincluding headmen, shamans and ritual experts takes part in all the everyday subsistence activities, and every woman is a

gardener and mother, each maloca is largely a self-sustained economic unit. The various households in the multi-family maloca engage in their own daily chores, and the unity of the maloca is only physically asserted during the communal meals at dawn and dusk, and during periodic, collective labours, such as clearing the swidden land and constructing and repairing the house itself.
The integration of the semi-autonomous settlements into the wider Tukanoan society is, above all, accomplished and reinforced by the many conspicuous communal rituals involving several different settlements and clan groups. During important rituals, such as the pan-Tukanoan dabucurí feast and the masked dances of the Makuna, great quantities of foods and ritual goods are exchanged among intermarrying clans, thus symbolically underpinning their interdependence and the necessity of peaceful alliances between clans for the reproduction and continuity of society at large.
In all rituals copious amounts of coca, powdered snuff, and chichaa lo- 16 cal beer made from manioc or other root cropsare consumed. These are the mens ritual foods, replacing ordinary food during ritual events. Particular potions of shamanized coca and snuff, referred to as spirit food, keti bare, are also allocated by the officiating shaman to reinvigorate and infuse spiritual powers to the participants. At particularly important events a hallucinogenic drink, yagé, is served to initiated men. The drink is said to bring the men into contact with the he world and enable them to communicate with its powerful spirits.
At the heart of traditional Tukanoan culture is what is generally known in Vaupés as the Yuruparí cult which involves large-scale, seasonal rituals during which men play large palm flutes and trumpets, representing deified ancestors. The Makuna call the instruments heliterally spirits of the he world. There are two kinds of Yuruparí instruments: the ancient and most sacred ones, he bucura, played at the elaborate initiation ceremony when boys become men, and the less sacred forest-fruit instruments, herica samara, played

to celebrate the harvest season of particular fruits. The fact that women and children are prohibited from seeing the instruments has contributed to the aura of a mystical, secret mens cult which surrounds the Yuruparí rituals. For the early missionaries, the Yuruparí cult epitomized the pagan beliefs of the Indians, and was regarded as a form of devil worship and therefore relentlessly repressed. For the Indians, in contrast, the instruments are the sacred body of the clan ancestors, and as such the supreme, tangible symbol of the unity of the clan. The Yuruparí instruments, say the Makuna, are the heart and soul of the clan, and the seasonal Yuruparí rituals, when the scattered clan members come together to dance and play the flutes, provide the fullest expression of the identity of the Makuna as a people.
The Makuna
Makuna individuals identify themselves by the name of the clan, or wider exogamous group to which they belong. The name Makuna, like those of most other tribal groups in the Vaupés region, is of Geral originthe generalized Tupi trade language previously employed throughout the Amazon and is used only by outsiders. Today the Makuna-speakers comprise some twelve distinct clans, which in turn are grouped into two exogamous units, named after the two principal clans in each group, the ide masa and the yiba masa, roughly translatable as Water People and Land People respectively. The two groups of clans intermarry frequently and it appears that the language they today share was originally proper to the Water People. Thus, the term Makuna can be employedand often isin two senses: a strict sense referring to the Water People as an exogamous and originally language-bearing unit, and a wider sense implying all the Makuna-speaking clans. Since the Makuna-speakers share a relatively well defined territory, and have a long history of close intermarriage that has shaped their culture and given them a

sense of collective identity, I generally use the term Makuna in this wider sense to refer to the Makuna language community.
According to their origin myths, the earliest ancestors of all Makuna clans were born as anacondas at a point in the east that they refer to as the Water Door (ide sohe). From this eastern gateway, where the rivers flow out of this world, the ancestral anacondas swam upriver, following the large river that the Makuna call the Milk River (ohengu riaca). As they swam upriver they entered the Apaporis, and later the Pirá-Paraná river, which to the Makuna represent the axis of their territory. At various points along the Apaporis and lower Pirá-Paraná and their principal tributariesthe Umunya, Toaca, and Komenya riversthe ancestral anacondas went up on land and turned into people. These sites are the birth places of the different clans, the ancestral waking-up-houses, masa yuhiri wiri. To ordinary people these mythical birth places manifest themselves as rocks and rapids in the rivers, or as tapirs salt licks in the forest, but to shamans they are huge malocas, beautifully 17 decorated and full of adorned men wearing the complete ceremonial regalia, including the shining headdresses of macaw feathers.
At death, Makuna say, the soul of the deceased travels to the ancestral birth place of the clan, and in the waking-up-house it comes alive as a spirit person. At the birth of a boy child, the spirit of a deceased grandfather, and in the case of a girl, a grandmother spirit, travel from the house of the dead to the house of the living and enter the body of the new-born child, who thus become identified with the dead ancestor whose name it receives. The Makuna thus believe in the reincarnation and transmigration of the soul, expressed in the practice of naming children after deceased relatives at two generations remove. Along with the Yuruparí flutes and the sacred feather head-dresses, the birth names of its members form part of the clans most important spiritual possessions.
The waking-up-house of the first ancestor of all the Water People clans is a huge underwater maloca at Manaitara, an island set in the midst of a series

of rocks and rapids in the Apaporis river below the mouth of the Pirá-Paraná. From the birth house of their common ancestor, known as ide hino or Water Anaconda, the individual ancestors of the various Water People clans travelled upstream, founding other malocas and receiving their own Yuruparí instruments and ritual goods. At the mouth of the Toaca river on the lower Pirá-Paraná the ide masa clan proper, to which Ignacio belongs, received the ancestral clan goodsthe Yuruparí flutes, the gourds of beeswax, coca, and tobacco, the yagé pot, and the ritual dance regalia, which allow the presentday clan members to live and protect themselves from spiritual dangers. This sacred wealth, kept in the invisible maloca at the mouth of Toaca, comprises the spiritual weapons of the clan, its defence, kuni oca. Therefore the Toaca river is referred to as the life line or water pathide maof the ide masa clan.
The Land People, yiba masa, on their part, are the proper owners of the Komenya river. A salt lick at the mouth of the Komenya, called itara, is their waking-up-house, where their clan ancestor emerged into this world, and to which the souls of their dead return. Here are their spiritual wealth and sacred goods, and here they received their ancestral Yuruparí instruments. Like the Toaca river for the Water People, the Komenya is the ancestral territory of the Land People, their life-giving water path which connects the living with the dead, and the present with the mythical past.
Today both Land and Water People live on the Komenya river. Only two Makuna malocas remain on the Toaca river, since most Water People moved to the Komenya several generations ago as a consequence of the persecution from rubber hunters in the early decades of the century. Ignacios grandfather and his local clan group sought protection among their mother people, hako masa, of the yiba masa clan with whom they had intermarried for generations and developed close political alliances. Bringing their Yuruparí instruments and other ritual goods from the Toaca, the ide masa clan settled on the Komenya were they are still found today.

***

The Water People and the Land People are, according to Makuna tradition, proper marriage partners. A well-known Makuna myth tells how Yiba, the ancestor of the Land People and son of a dog motherappearing alternatively as a jaguar, an anaconda, and a human beingmarried Yawira, Water Anacondas daughter. Water Anaconda is the owner and guardian of all water animals, and the fish are his kin and following. Yiba, on the other hand, who lives in the forest, is the owner and guardian of the land-living forest animals. While hunting in the forest, so the story goes, Yiba encountered Yawira collecting fruits and instantly fell in love with her. He captured her and brought her to his house:

However, since Yawira was a water being, belonging to the river world, she at

first found it difficult to live with Yiba. His raw, wild forest food made her

thin and ill. Your food is no good, she said to Yiba, it is not real food. I am

going to my fathers house to bring you some real food. She left and then

18

returned with manioc and other cultivated plants which are still grown in the

gardens today. Again, Yiba did not know tobacco or coca. He smoked and

chewed the leaves of wild trees. Once more Yawira went to her fathers un-

derwater maloca and brought tobacco leaves and coca plants for Yiba to cul-

tivate. But Yiba thought that the tobacco leaves were fish and ate them. He

became ill, vomited and defecated outside his house. From the spot where he

had defecated, the tobacco plant grew. Yiba also received yagé and ceremo-

nial feather headdresses from his father-in-law. In return he offered Water

Anaconda smoked meat. Later Water Anaconda invited Yiba to a ritual dance

in his underwater house. Yawira gave her husband a magical substance which

enabled him to turn into an anaconda and swim in the river. He brought

forest fruits to his father-in-law to be distributed during the dancewasoa

basa, the dance of the wild wasoa fruit. To reciprocate, Yiba invited Water

Anaconda and his people to dance wamu basathe dance of the wild wamu

fruitin his own house. This time Water Anaconda brought fruits from his

underwater gardens. Thus the Makuna received their ritual dances, the yagé

and the sacred dance regalia.

This much abbreviated fragment of the epic myth about Yiba and Yawira, recounted in a multitude of different versions, conveys to the Makuna a sig-

nificant message about their identity as a people. The marriage between Yiba and Yawira established the primordial alliance between the Land People and the Water People and brought about a creative conjunction between different cosmic domains, land and water, forest and river. Through this procreative union of opposites, society and culture were born. The alliance between the beings of the forest and the river was consolidated by the exchange of foods, ritual goods, and dances. Thus, when Yawira brought cultivated plants, spirit foods, and ceremonial paraphernalia from the river world up onto land and into this world, the Makuna culture as we know it today emerged. The manioc and other cultivated food plants, the coca, the tobacco, and the yagé along with the sacred goods and the ritual dances, the myths and the shamanic knowledge, are the cultural riches of the Pirá-Paraná peoples, which still sustain and give meaning to their lives.

CHAPTER TWO
The Land

THE MAKUNA SOMETIMES describe their cosmos as an im-

19

mense wasp nest, divided into layers, each forming a world unto itself. The

middle level is the earth, inhabited by human beings and the plants and ani-

mals of this world. The upper layers form the Sky world, and the lower layers

constitute the Underworld, each inhabited by different kinds of beings. The

uppermost levels of the sky sustain the sun and the moon, stars, thunder, and

lightning which, to the Makuna, are all powerful spirit beings. The level imme-

diately above the earth, called the Path of the Wind, is the abode of vultures

and swift-flying raptors, and the underworld is peopled by ants, worms, frogs,

and the soul-less corpses of the dead. A celestial river runs across the sky and

another, chthonic river traverses the underworld. Each day the sun travels

the celestial river from east to west, and each night it follows the underworld

river from west to east, thus completing a cosmic circuit.

The middle earth is represented as flat and circular like the clay griddle on

which women bake bread in the maloca. Along the edge of the world is an

imagined circle of hills supporting the sky and protecting its inhabited canter. Four gateways in the cardinal directions and one in the canter lead into and out of the world. The great River of Milk, collecting all terrestrial waters, traverses the earth and debouches at the eastern gateway, the Water Door, where the sun rises every morning and where earth fuses with sky. This eastern gateway is the source of all life on earth, the point of creative beginning, from which the world was successively populated by the ancestral people. The gateway in the west, huna sohe, or the Door of Suffering, is the end of the world, associated with death and disease, and the entrance of the destructive forces of the underworld that periodically invade the earth.
This mythical world is mapped onto the major landmarksthe hills, rivers, and rapidsof the Makuna territory. The mountains at Mitú and La Pedrera, the ranges of hills along the Taraira and upper Pirá-Paraná rivers, and the majestic falls at Yuruparí on the Vaupés, and the Araracuara on the Caquetá rivers, define the extension of their world and form the protective mountain wall encircling it. Makuna say that the world, as known and named by them, begins at the falls of La Libertad on the lower Apaporis and ends at the Jirijirimo falls on its upper reaches. Thus, La Libertad is their Water Door where life once began and is continuously renewed, and Jirijirimo their Door of Suffering. But the end of the Makuna world is the beginning of other worlds and other territories. Thus, the Jirijirimo is the Water Door of the Kabiyarí people on the upper Apaporis. In this way the territories of the different tribal groups of the Vaupés region are interlocked in a complex mosaic of adjacent but distinct worlds.
The Makuna live at the canter of this universe and refer to themselves as gudareco gana, people of the canter. The geographical and cosmological canter is said to be close to the headwaters of the Komenya river. Uninhabited and rarely visited, this site, called Tabotiro or the Place of White Grass, is sacred to the Makuna. Those who have seen it say it is an open, treeless area in the midst of the forest, covered with shining white grass. In the beginning

of time, the ancestral beings here measured the world and separated earth from sky, creating the universe as the Makuna know it today. At Tabotiro, the Makuna say, there is an invisible cosmic pillar reaching to the uppermost sky and extending deep into the underworld, along which shamans may travel between the layers of the cosmos.
The proper, ancestral territory of the Makuna-speaking clans stretches from the island of Manaitara on the Apaporis river to the great fall of Nahu Gohethe Hole of the Manioc Breadon the middle Pirá-Paraná, above the mouth of the Komenya river. This Makuna homeland is further subdivided into various clan territories, defined by the water paths and birth places of the individual clan ancestors. The Indian groups living on the upper Pirá-Paraná, including the Barasana, Taiwano, and Tatuyo, are called headwaters people, jode gana, while more remote peoples, living at the edge of the Makuna worldthe Tukano, Cubeo, Yukuna, and Huitotoare people of the margin, tunima gana. Beyond the frontiers of their world live only 20 strangers and Whites, demons and monsters.
The people of the canter, Makuna say, are like the inhabitants of a great maloca, protected by the hills encircling them and the spiritual powers of the shaman. When a Makuna shaman performs his protective shamanism, wanore, in the midst of the maloca, his mind travels along this circle of hills, turning it into a wall shielding the canter from the dangers and evil forces of the outside. To the shaman, then, the world is a cosmic maloca, with hills for walls and supporting posts, and the sky for roof.
Forest and River
The Makuna describe their land in a language of mythical scenes and metaphorical images that to a Western audience may seem opaque and elusive. Fully to appreciate their perception of nature and the ecological knowledge

on which it is based, it is necessary to describe briefly the tropical forest environment in ourWesternterms, derived from the language of natural science.
Geologically, the flat, forested land of the Makuna, sloping imperceptibly towards the great basin of the Amazon, forms part of the ancient land formation called the Guiana shield. Geographically it belongs to the central Northwest Amazon, an area of meagre soils and nutrient-poor rivers. Here and there dome-shaped mountains and steep rocks shoot up from the otherwise undifferentiated forest cover. Yet, nothing could be more misleading than this apparent uniformity of landscape: the Amazonian rain-forest is extremely differentiated, and the north-western part probably the most varied and species-rich of the entire basin.
Biological diversity is, indeed, the true wealth of the rain-forest. Harbouring more than 80 000 plant species, of which more than 4000 are trees, the Amazon forest provides a formidable variety of micro-environments supporting a multitude of life forms. A crude estimate indicates that an average four-square-mile patch of rain-forest may contain up to 1500 species of flowering plants, as many as 750 species of tree, 125 mammal, 400 bird, 100 reptile, 60 amphibian, and 150 butterfly species. Insects are so abundant and so little known that it is difficult even to provide an estimate, especially when considering that a single tree can support some 400 insect species, unique to that tree alone.
This tremendous diversity of life forms corresponds, however, with a paucity in numbers: there are relatively few representatives of each species. Thus the forest sustains a great variety of species of small and often highly localized populations. Compared with the plant and animal life of temperate forest, most tropical forest species are actually rare. Alfred Wallace, the famous British naturalists and Amazonian explorer, wrote:
If the traveller notices a particular species and wishes to find more like it, he may often turn his eyes in vain in every direction. Trees of varied forms,

dimensions and colours are around him, but he rarely sees any one of them repeated. Time after time he goes towards a tree which looks like the one he seeks, but a closer examination proves it to be distinct. He may at length, perhaps, meet with a second specimen half a mile off or fail altogether, till on another occasion he stumbles on one by accident.
The highly localized distribution of plants in the tropical forest has important consequences for its human inhabitants. Vaupés Indians seasonally travel long distances to collect the scarce and scattered resources of the forest wood for house and canoe building, plants used for the manufacture of important artifacts including basketry and musical instruments, and vines, leaves, and roots used in the preparation of fish- and arrow poison. Particularly relished fruits, and ritual goods and substances derived from rare and precious plants have become the objects of important ceremonial exchanges between different local and territorial groups. In former times, the localized occurrence of forest and river resources provided the material basis for a developed, indigenous trade network, extending over large parts of the North- 21 west Amazon.
***
The extraordinary diversity of life in tropical rain-forests is partly a result of the hot and humid climate in which organisms can grow and reproduce continuously throughout the year. More than half of the water falling as rain in the Amazon is recycled from the forest, evaporated and transpired from the immense mass of green foliage. Temperatures vary more in a day than the monthly average in a year. In Vaupés, temperatures range between 20-35 degrees C, and the average annual rainfall exceeds 2500 mm.
The life of the forest and its rivers follows a markedly seasonal pulse, manifest in the periodicity of floods, fruiting seasons, and the reproductive cycles of animalsmigratory fishes, frogs, swarming ants, termites, and larvae, which all make up an important part of the Indian diet. Though the

Makuna distinguish a whole series of wet and dry seasons, identified by fruits in season and star constellations on the night sky, the seasonal cycle in central Northwest Amazon is conventionally divided into two wet and two dry seasons. The long wet season lasts from April to August, the short for a few weeks in October-November. The long dry season lasts from December to March, and the short for some weeks in September-October. Makuna talk about these alternations between high and low water as the breathing of the rivers.
This seasonal rhythm largely dictates the subsistence activities of the forest dwellers. Thus men cut clearings in the forest for their gardens before the long dry season, so that the trunks have time to dry out before the cleared land is burned towards the end of the dry season and planted at the beginning of the rains. While the swidden garden provides a fairly constant supply of manioc throughout the year, the yields of other cultivated plants and wild plant food tend to be seasonal; the cultivated fruits are mainly available during the long dry season, while wild fruits generally ripen during the long wet season. The harvests of wild and cultivated plants thus form complementary seasonal cycles that together secure a regular supply of plant food all year round. Hunting and fishing go on throughout the year, but techniques and their relative importance also vary seasonally.
***
Ecologists usually make a fundamental distinction between two gross types of environments in the Amazon river basin with vastly different potentials for human settlement: the flood plains, or várzea, and the interfluvial upland forests, or terra firme. The former, comprising only a small part of the total area, consists of the seasonally flooded and fertile valleys of the Amazon river and its major affluents. In contrast, the remaining and vastly greater part of the area consists of relatively poorer upland soils, providing a bleaker prospect for human settlement than the rich flood plains. Yet, it is in the

interfluvial forests that most of the Amazonian Indians are found today, adapting to the limitations of the environment by living in small, scattered settlements. The complex indigenous civilizations that once existed along the floodplains of the large rivers were rapidly subdued and destroyed by the Spanish and Portuguese conquerors.
Though environmentally diversified, the upland forests and blackwater riversthe rivers of hungerof the Northwest Amazon are considered the poorest in the entire Amazon basin in terms of nutrient levels and biomass productivity. The fact that numerous Indian populations, sustaining a rich variety of sophisticated cultures, have survived in the region up to the present time testifies not only to human adaptive ingenuity but also to the diversity of nature in the region. Even within a limited area, such as the Pirá-Paraná drainage system, a gradient of local environmental variation can be discerned, yielding widely different subsistence conditions. Soils, flora, and fauna thus vary substantially between the headwaters area and the lower reaches of a 22 single river system. Certain fish do not extend beyond particular falls and rapids, and species composition differs considerably between headwaters and main-river areas. Hunting and gathering generally becomes relatively more important than fishing in the headwaters communities, while the opposite is true for the downstream and main-river communities. Similarly, the productivity of manioc cultivation declines as one moves from main-river to the headwaters environment, and the varieties of crops as well as their size and quality change.

Just as its living resources are highly localized in horizontal space, the rainforest environment is vertically stratified. The forest is truly three-dimensional andlike the Makuna cosmosmulti-layered, each layer forming a distinct ecological niche, with its own conditions of life and its own particular biological community. The roof of the forest, composed by the dense

canopy, is penetrated by a few scattered, giant trees reaching above the compact mass of foliage. Below the canopy follows a series of intermediary levels made up of shorter trees and saplings, and close to the forest floor, usually bare except for a thin litter of dead leaves, mosses, and fungi, there is a sparse under-storey of shrubs and seedlings.
The canopy protects the fragile soils from the scorching heat of the sun and the destructive impact of tropical rain storms. At the same time, its foliage is so dense that only a fraction of sunlight reaches the forest floor, leaving it in almost constant shade. The lush world of the canopy, which receives an abundance of light and rain, provides a favourable habitat for a variety of flying and climbing animals. Its wealth of leaves, fruits, seeds, and flowers thus sustains butterflies, bees, and wasps of all kinds, a spectacular variety of birds, including tucanos, macaws, parrots, and hummingbirds, a whole range of monkeys, and the slow-moving sloth, to mention only a few. In the deep shade of the forest floor, ground-living mammals such as tapirs, peccaries, anteaters and tinamous rummage for fallen fruits, nuts, seeds, worms, and insects.
Most animals tend to stay permanently in their particular layer of the forest. Tree-dwelling mammals rarely come down to the ground, and some, such as the sloth, can spend months in a single tree. Being both acute observers and practical scientists, Makuna hunters not only divide animals according to habitat into ground, tree, and air dwellershakahu wara, henira, and wutira, respectivelybut also according to the level of the forest they inhabit: tree-top dwellers, middle-trunk dwellers, and low-trunk dwellers.
Superimposed on this layered framework is an enormous number of epiphytes and climbers which occupy all layers. Climbing and growing on trunks and branches in search of sunlight, they depend on the trees for physical support, but unlike parasites they make no harm to their host plants. Epiphytic ferns, orchids, and bromeliads, which have no roots in the soil, survive by

collecting surface water and extracting nutrients from dead leaves and twigs that fall from the canopy. The thick, waxy leaves of the bromeliads, for example, are arranged in rosette that forms a tank that collects rain and falling debris. The miniature gardens thus formed may hold communities of otherwise typically terrestrial animals such as cockroaches, earthworms, and snakes high up in the forest canopy. Some even harbour aquatic species such as salamanders and frogs.
Lianas and woody vines, while rooted in the soil, adapt to the rain-forest environment by climbing even the tallest trees, using them as ladders, and may reach hundreds of meters in length. Their straight, twisted, or curly stems, sometimes as thick as a mans body, entangleand occasionally stranglethe trees of the rain-forest. A whole range of them is utilised by the Indiansas ropes, and as a source of the deadly dart poison, curare, and the narcotic yagé, consumed at important rituals.
Due to their vast numbers, incredible variety, and ecological importance, 23 insects are the true lords of the rain-forest. Not surprisingly, insects form a significant part of the native diet. In a recent nutritional study among the Indians of the upper Pirá-Paraná insects proved to be the second most important source of protein in the diet, after fish but well before game meat. Insects play a crucial role in the forest ecosystem by pollinating flowers and transporting seeds. Apart from contributing to plant reproduction they also help breaking down forest debris so that it can be recycled as nutrients for the living plants. Many ants and termites thus collect plant material, chew and deposit it in their nests, where it nourishes and serves as fertilizer for plants growing near the nests. Some ants and termites have developed relations of close association and interdependence with certain plants. A Brazilian termite, for example, feeds exclusively on the root tips of a particular plant, which in its turn only grows adjacent to this particular species of termite. Leaf-cutter ants even cultivate a certain fungus, unique to their nest, on which their larvae feed. Another curious example of the intricate interde-

pendence between distinct life forms is provided by the sloth, who supports and camouflages a number of species of moths, beetles, ticks, and mites who live in its fur, which itself is camouflaged by the algae that grow on it and give it a protective green tint.
The army-ant illustrates the role of insects in the food chain, linking species of all the different trophic levels of the forest. The nomadic insect travels in troops of up to twenty million, collecting lichens, mosses, small bits of bark, twigs, and leaves, which they take back to their nests and break down into food for their queen. Catherine Caufield writes: As the swarm advances, some of the insects in its path manage to run or fly away, often into the clutches of a number of species that have evolved to take advantage of army ant leftovers. These camp followers include birds, beetles, springtails, millipedes and flies. Some follow the odour trails the ants leave on the ground; others perch or hover overhead, catching flying insects in a well-defined order. Some depend entirely upon food that army ants deliver to them. In the wake of this foraging army, a whole food chain thus unfolds, with the ants and their food at one end, and the predators and raptors feeding on the insectivore animals at the other.
The forest Indians observe and reflect on ecological processes and relationships such as these. Myths and cosmological notions are to a great extent inspired by native peoples knowledge of the natural world. The way the Indians classify animals according to forest levels, and perhaps even their conception of the multi-layered cosmos, reflect a fundamental feature of the tropical forest environment and exemplify the close relationship between practical knowledge and cultural elaboration. More specifically, the Makuna origin myth and their notion of the transmigration of human souls along particular water paths seem to be based on a precise knowledge about the migratory routes of certain fish species. And, as will be shown below, their classification of all natural life forms into a shamanic system of eaters and food symbolically elaborates the fundamental ecological principle of the

food chain. A tropical forest environment and its complex web of life thus provide a rich source of imagery for Makuna thought and mythic poetry, and form the factual backdrop to their conception of life and reality at large. The rest of this book substantiates this assertion.

***

In the Amazon, forest and river are closely linked. In an environment where

considerable tracts of land are permanently or periodically inundated, it is

difficult to tell where the forest ends and the river begins. The rain-forest

with its myriad of waterways is thus very much an integrated whole, to which

its animal inhabitants have adapted. Tree-dwelling species stay in the upper

layers of the forest to escape flooding, while ground living animals have de-

veloped an amphibian capacity to move freely between land and water. The

jaguar and its principal preytapirs, peccaries, and large rodentsare, for

example, excellent swimmers, while other predators such as anacondas,

caymans, and otters, live most of their lives in the rivers.

24

Even the fish depend on the forest for their food supply. At least fifty

species in the Rio Negro basin, and most large fishes in the Vaupés river, feed

practically exclusively on fruit that falls into the river. Several fruit-eating

species appear not to eat at all when their preferred fruits are out of season or

the flood has receded so that they can no longer reach their food. Other fish

feed on insects which fall into the river. According to one estimate approxi-

mately one fourth of all the fish species of the Amazon, and possibly all

young fish, feed on the thick layer of detritus and insects that periodically

covers the surface of rivers and streams.

This close interdependence between the life worlds of the river and the

forest is reflected in the peculiar Makuna idea that fish and game animals

may transform into one another. In their hunting tales fish at will walk up on

land to feed on the fruits and seeds of the forest. Conversely, game can turn

into fish and disappear into the depths of the rivers to escape the hunters.

Therefore, they say, fish never have empty stomachs, and hunters often fail to track down game along the river beds.
The Indians also put their knowledge of rain-forest ecology and animal habits to more practical uses. The Makuna classify all plants according to whether they are food for men, birds, mammals, or fish. Fruits consumed by fish are thus referred to as fish food. When certain fruits are in season, men will use them as bait when fishing at the spots where they are known to fall into the river. Another ingenious fishing technique is seasonally used as the peach palm fruit, equally relished as food by men and fish, is grated into a mash and mixed with fish poison. The mix is then moulded into fruitlike balls which are thrown into the river. The fish come up to the surface to eat the false fruit, while the men in canoes let themselves float downriver, collecting the stupefied fish. The Makuna, along with the other Indian groups in the region, also avoid cutting their gardens along river banks, thus preserving the riverine forest as a source of food for the fish.
No one knows how many species of fish exist in the Amazon basin as a whole, but 5000of which less than 3000 have been identifiedis an often-quoted estimate, making it the worlds most diverse collection of freshwater fish. In the Rio Negro alone, into which the Vaupés river flows, there are more than 700 different speciesmostly characins and catfishes. By way of comparison all rivers of Europe combined support fewer than 150 species of freshwater fish.
For the Indians the rivers are the life-sustaining arteries of the forest. The seasonal floods determine fish migrations and spawning patterns, but also the distribution and availability of many other animals living in or near rivers and streams, such as caymans, pacas, and peccaries, which all form an important part of the native diet. In the past, river turtles were so numerous in parts of the Amazon basin that Indians actually bred them in artificial dams as a major source of food.
The river, just as the forest, is ecologically complex and differentiated. It

contains a variety of micro-environments and ecological niches, supporting localized populations of fish and aquatic mammals. The rapids and falls of a single river form veritable biological barriers between such animal communities. In the Northwest Amazon the large characins, for example, seasonally migrate along specific routes bounded by the major cataracts of the main rivers. At the beginning of the wet season the fish descend the tributaries of such local river systems to spawn in the main river, near the confluences. A second migration, known as pirasemu, takes place during the dry season, when the fish ascend the main river, annually moving from one tributary to another, in a long upriver journey which takes several years to complete.
These migratory movements of fish are culturally significant for the Makuna: the Water People are said to be the children of Water Anaconda, and arein another dimensionfish. The annual fish migrations along particular and known river routes correspond in Makuna mythology to the creative journey of the ancestors along particular water paths defining the ter- 25 ritories of the different Makuna clans. Indeed, the migrating fish are the souls of human individuals travelling from the malocas of the living to the wakingup-houses of the dead and back again. It appears, then, that for the Makuna the migratory movements of fish serve as a model and prime source of imagery for conceptualizing their territorial organisation, their origin and identity as people, and the nature and trajectory of the human soul as it travels between birth, death, and rebirth.
Enchanted World
For the Makuna, nature is saturated with meaning and mythical significance. Every place and landmark has a name, and each tells a story of its own. The world as the Makuna know it was created by Romikumu or Woman Shaman, the Ancestral Mother, and by the Ayawaroa, the mythical Male Heroes. These

primordial beings appear in myth in different guises, and their works and deeds are described in a bewildering variety of ways. The cosmogonic myths provide a series of almost hallucinatory images representing the same events from different perspectives and in changing contexts. One set of images depict Romikumu as the world itself, and the Ayawaroa as the celestial bodiessun, moon, stars, and thunder. The rivers of the earth are Romikumus breast milk and blood, and the Water Door in the east is her vagina. Her ribs are the mountain ridges at the northern and southern gateways of the world and the seasonal changes in the water level of the rivers correspond to her menstrual cycle, the opening and closing of her womb.
Another series of images visualize Romikumu and the Ayawaroa as beings living and acting on the earth, human-like but immortal and omnipotent. They are the he people, alternatively referred to as the Creators, Owners, or Children of the World, who through their actions and deeds created the world and all that is in it. The Ayawaroa travelled across the world from the Water Door in the east to the centre, playing the primordial Yuruparí flutesthe sound of which were actually their singing voicesand making the first artifacts and ritual instruments, thereby creating rivers, rapids, hills, and forest, and all the animals of this earth.
The world as it now exists was thus created by the he people, from their bodies and as a result of their creative work. Significantly, the ancestral beings thereby established a cosmic division of labour between the sexes: Woman Shaman created the world out of her own body, thus literally giving birth to the world, and land and waters are one with her body. The Male Heroes, on the other hand, created by means of their work, the skills of their craft and the powers of their ritual acts. Nature, then, in a very direct and concrete way shares in the creative powers of the ancestral beings.
***
Before the present cosmic and social order existed, chaos reigned over the

world. People were not yet differentiated from animals. The he people were thus at the same time powerful shamans, jaguars, and anacondas. They preyed on their own kind, bred indiscriminately, committed incest, and ate their own children. The Male Heroes paid no respect to Woman Shaman who responded by destroying the world by flood and fire. She then turned it upside down so that the sky became this earth, and the old, drowned and scorched earth became the underworld, now full of dried skulls and incinerated bones. From its ruins, a new world and a new generation of living beings emerged. This mythical event is known in Makuna as the creation of the seasons, rodori menire. By flooding and burning the world Woman Shaman created the seasons of the year which make life possible on earth. In this sense, the myth marks the beginning of time and the creation of the present natural and social order.
As an opaque, symbolic comment on the biological process of death and regeneration and the seasonal rhythms of nature, the myth links female fer- 26 tility as manifest in the menstrual cycle of women with the fertility of the land and the agricultural cycle of burning and planting the swiddens. At another level, and translated into the language of science, the myth can be seen as a strangely accurate account of the evolution of the Amazonian rain-forest environment. Scientists today believe that the Amazon forest evolved through a sequence of floods and dry spells during the Pleistocene glaciations and interglacial periods. What is now tropical rain-forest has thus alternately been dry savannah and inundated flood plain. It is as if the Makuna myth about the creation of time, in its own veiled language, recalls this remote period of the pre-historic past.
The new world that emerged after the flooding and burning of the old earth, was flat, dry, and barren. Through a series of deeds, the ancestral beings now recreated forest, rivers, and mountains and then the living beings of the present. The rivers are described as the paths of the ancestors. As the he people travelled in line from the margins towards the centre of the earth,

they pushed the primordial Yuruparí instruments before them in the still soft earth, thus forming the river valleys. And as they played the sacred flutes, saliva dripped from the orifices, and the rivers came into being. At various places along the journey they stopped to rest, drink, and dance, and to perform a variety of deeds. They brought night to the world and thus created the diurnal rhythm; they created forest and hills, built and thatched the first maloca, and fabricated the original artifacts and ritual regalia. Upon each of these sites they bestowed a name, thus giving the land a history and endowing it with meaning for its present inhabitants.
The low hills in the forest are the birth- and dance houses of the land animals where they gather to reproduce and multiply, and the higher mountains and conspicuous hilltops are the posts and walls of the cosmic maloca, which materialized out of the sound from the Yuruparí flutes as the Ayawaroa traversed the earth in search of its centre. The hills and mountains are also the petrified bodies of the ancestral beings themselves, supporting the sky and protecting the people at the centre. Makuna shamans therefore continuously offer blessed coca and snuff to the hills, and blow fragrant smoke from cigars and burning beeswax in their direction, to placate the ancestral beings who inhabit them.
As the Male Heroes reached the centre they stopped. Tabotiro was the home of Woman Shaman, and from there she ruled the world. She kept the creative fire in her vagina, and as long as she maintained it, the Ayawaroa could not have intercourse with her. Through a series of cunning acts they managed to steal fire from her, and impregnate her with their fertilizing semen. Their work now completed, the Ayawaroa rose to the sky and turned into thunder and lightning, while Romikumu, infuriated as she realized that she was pregnant, returned to the Water Door. There she gave birth to the ancestral anacondas, which became the clan ancestors of the present generations of people.
As the anaconda children grew up, they followed the rivers of the earth to

their source at the centre, and then again returned to the east. Following in

the wake of the he people, they stopped at various sites along the journey,

went up on land, danced, and gave birth to people. These are the birth places

of the clan ancestors and the waking-up-houses of deceased clan members in

the present.

***

Thus the rivers and forests, hills and cataracts of the Makuna territory teem

with invisible life. They contain the waking-up-houses of people and the

birth- and dance houses of animals. Nature is not only the abode of plants,

animals, and spirits, but in its very substance and essence impregnated with

the forces of creation. The water in the rivers and everything that grows in

the forest contain the bodily fluids of the he people, and thus partake of the

ultimate powers of life and death. Into the Komenya river, for example, there

flows a small stream of dark, reddish water which according to the Makuna

contain the poisoned blood of a man-eating giant eagle, once slain by the 27 male mythical heroes. Higher up the Komenya, along another seemingly in-

significant tributary, a great fire is said to have burnt the first generation of

initiatesthe ritual protégés of the Ayawaroato death. Its water is there-

fore believed to contain the flames of this ancestral fire and the ashes of its

victims. At Jirijirimo, the Ayawaroa felled the Water Tree that turned into

the upper Apaporis river. Its waters are the trunk and branches of the cosmic

tree itself. The headwater streams flowing from Tabotiro at the centre of the

Makuna world contain the menstrual blood of Woman Shaman, and from

the blood-stained soil at the Water Door, where she gave birth to the ances-

tral anacondas, grew the first palm tree, called the Palm of Food since its

fruits nourished the first fruit-eating animals. Hence, forest fruits are said to

contain the ancestral fire, the heat of Woman Shamans blood.

The stories are as endless as the named sites in the Makuna territory, each

providing a variation on the fundamental message that the land is potent

because it is part of the ancestral body and the result of primordial creation.

Everything that lives off the land partakes of its creative and destructive powers. It is essential for the Makuna to know these names and the messages they convey. Where waters are poisoned or contain the ancestral fire, people may not fish. The fruits of the forest must be blessed before eaten, as must the animals which feed on forest fruits, and the fish that swim in harmful waters. In order to bless food, prevent and cure illness, and protect people from misfortune, shamans must know the mythical significance of their territory and its resources. Myth thus instructs on the blessings and dangers of the land.
Lessons of a Shaman
In Makuna natural history, all living beings form a relativistic trophic universe of eaters and food. From the point of view of any class of beings all others are either predators or food. Thus, from the point of view of human beings (masa), this trophic universe is divided into human food (masa bare), including all plants and animals which are food for men, and maneaters (masa bari masa), including those predators that, according to Makuna, feed on men. In shamanic language the predator category is labelled after the supreme predator, the jaguar (yai), and the food category after the prototypical human food, fish (wai), thus forming a tripartite system of cosmic classification, based on the food chain:
eater  food/eater  food YAI  MASA  WAI
jaguar  people  fish
The limits of the system are defined, at one extreme, by the supreme predators, who prey on all living beings but are prey to none; and, at the other extreme, the plants which are only food. The intermediate trophic level com-

prises most life forms, including human beings, who are at the same time both eaters and food. And since all animals to the Makuna are people, the scheme applies to any animal: from the point of view of game animals and the common food fish men are included among their jaguars, while fruits, seeds, insects, and plant detritus are their fish.
Not surprisingly, the supreme predator category, which includes jaguars, anacondas, and the major raptors, is considered extremely powerful and mythologically important to the Makuna. Shamans are thus identified with jaguars, and are called yaia. In the Makuna shamanic universe, jaguars, anacondas, and raptors are one and the same in different guises; they are hunters of the different cosmic domains: jaguars in the forest, anacondas in the rivers, and raptors in the sky. As with their human counterpartsthe shamansthe cosmic hunters freely change shape and convert from one to the other as they move between the various layers and domains of the universe.
Here, then, is a fundamental ecological principlethe food chainelabo- 28 rated into an entire cosmology, a way of looking at the world. According to this cosmic scheme, fish is the preferred human food. To the Makuna, all edible animalsthe animals created to sustain human beingsare, in fact, related to fish in an imagined developmental sequence modelled on the life cycle of fish. Accordingly, fish is subdivided into small fish or fish children (wai ria) and big or adult fish (wai), while game animals are known as old fish, wai bucu. The idea behind this peculiar classification of animal food seems to be that as the fish children are born in the birth houses of the rivers, they swim upriver and grow into mature fish, feeding on the ripe forest fruits seasonally falling into the rivers. When the mature fish die they enter another existence, walk up onto land and turn into forest animals. The life cycle of fish thus repeats the creative journey of the ancestral anacondas who travelled up the rivers of the earth, walked up onto land, and became people. In shamanic thought fish, game, and men are contextually and symbolically identified with one another.

***
The animals came into being by means of the transformative labours of the ancestral beings. As the he people made the original artifacts and ritual regalia at different places along their creative journey, all kinds of animals were created from the wastes and leftovers of their work; the thrown-away chips, splinters, and downs from the ancestral feather crowns and Yuruparí flutes turned into game, fish, and insects. Similarly, when the Ayawaroa cut down the Water Tree at Jirijirimo which turned into the Apaporis river, the woodsplinters from the cosmic tree turned into fish. Different animals were created at different places and by means of different creative processes. Local communities of the same kind of animal were thus created separately at various sites, with different implications for food blessing and shamanic curing: the fish in Komenya is different from the one in the Apaporis, and each variety of game in the upper Pirá-Paraná area differ from those of the lower Pirá-Paraná. Thus, each local variety of game and fish must be blessed in its own unique way before it can be safely consumed, and every shaman must know the local history of creation of every animal species in his shamanic dominion.
Fish and game animals, the Makuna say, are people, masa. They live in malocas in the rivers and the forest, in salt-licks, rapids and hills. These invisible malocas are their waking-up-houses, in which they gather to dance and drink chicha, and where they are born and breed. In these houses, the animals keep their household goods and ritual regalia including baskets and pots, gourds of coca and snuff, sacred feather head-dresses and Yuruparí flutes. When the animals roam in the forest or swim in the rivers, they appear as fish and game, but as they enter their houses, they discard their animal guises, don their ritual regalia and turn into people. Makuna say that animals change appearance just as White men change shirts. Inside their houses they are spirit people, beautifully painted and dressed in full dance regalia.

Like men, animals form communities. They have cultivated gardens where they gather their food, and ports by the river to collect water and bathe. Each animal maloca has its headman and owner, uhu, who guards and protects its inhabitants. The guardians or fathers of the fish, wai hacu masa, for example, are the anacondas (hinoa) and stingrays (hawa) dwelling in the deep parts of rivers and lagoons. Animals seasonally gather in their dance houses to exchange food and play their Yuruparí flutes. When the animals dance and sing in their malocas, they actually breed and multiply. Animals, then, live and behave much like people do. Their communities are organized along the same lines as human societies. Each species or community of animals has its own culture, its knowledge, ritual and goods by means of which it sustains life. Animals are people in another dimension of reality.
In the words of a Makuna shaman:

When the fish travel along the river they visit the fish people of other houses,

just like people visit one another in this world. The fish people go to drink

29

and dance in each others houses. As they leave one house and enter another

they take off the old dresses and put on new ones; each house is different,

with its own name and history. The fish change accordingly. Even the river

changes from one place to another; the water is here bitter and heavy, there

light and sweet like the juice of sweet fruits. The fish also change with sea-

son; in the appropriate season they perform forest fruit rituals, make dabucurí

feasts, and play their Yuruparí instruments. Therefore the fish has to be blessed

differently according to season and place, depending on when and where it

was caught.

When a child falls sick, people say that an evil shaman sent illness upon

the child. But no, it is the river itself and the fish in it which causes the

sickness, because the child has eaten unblessed fish, or fish caught in prohib-

ited places.

Though fish live in the river world they easily turn into birds, monkeys,

rodents, peccaries and other fruit eating game animals. When food in the

river is scarce, fish turn into birds and ground-living animals seeking food in

the forest. With their baskets they collect food both in the river and the

forest. That is why fish always have their stomachs full. In the river the fish

people dress like fish, on land they dress like game animals. Fish and game

animals are wai masa, fish people; they are the same, they just change dress.

Vultures feed on cadavers. To them a corpse is a river full of fish. The worms that live in the rotten corpse are the fish of the vulture people. In our vision the vulture eats worms and rotten meat; in the vision of the vultures they eat fish trapped in the river. Vultures are like White people: they have plates, cups, spoons, and frying pans in which they fry their fish. Certain parts of the rivers belong to the vulture people where the fish are dangerous for human consumption because it is the food of the vultures. Thus what seems to be fish are actually worms.
The large game animals have their proper dance houses called kawiri large, painted malocas in the salt licks where tapirs go to drink at night. Every year, at the time when summer ends and the winter rains begin, all the animals of the forest and the fish of the rivers come to these dance houses to drink and dance. Here animals of all kinds and shapes gatherforest animals and fish, jaguars, anacondas, and vultures. Even monsters, souls of dead people, and the spirits of living menshamans, dancers and chantersparticipate in the dance. They come from all the directions and corners of the world, from the sky and from the underworld. These houses are also called the birth houses of songs and dances, basa bucua wiri, where all the ritual songs and dances that people posses today were born.
In the middle of the dance house stands the yagé pot. The animals drink the yagé and paint their faces and bodies, take coca and snuff, drink chicha and dance in full ritual gear. Thus the animals receive their knowledge, and like human beings they have their own mind. When the animals dance they breed and multiply. When people dance in this world, our spirits also dance in the dance houses of the animals, and when the shaman blows over coca and snuff, he offers spirit foods to the animals. If people do not dance and the shaman does not fill the gourds of coca and snuff in the dance houses of the animals they will not reproduce and multiply.
Because the game animals dance and drink in their own houses, it is dangerous to kill them and eat their meat. Their bodies contain all the powerful substances they have consumed, the paint and the ritual ornaments they wear. All these substances and goods cause us to fall ill if we eat unblessed meat. Therefore the meat must be blessed before eaten; the powerful substances contained in the meat must be removed and restored to their proper places in the dance houses of the animals. It has to be converted into food by means of food shamanism. The person, who knows how to bless food, converts the tapirs meat into cassava bread or cultivated plants like plantain or pineapple. In former times only adults ate meat; it was considered too dangerous for children to eat.
At the mouth of the Komenya river there is a tapirs salt lick called Itara.

Its owner and headman is Yuta Wecu, Cotton Tapir. What to us is a tapirs salt lick, a swampy, muddy place full of flies, isin the eyes of the shaman a big, beautifully painted maloca surrounded by a clean patio and groves of fruit trees and garden land where the tapir people grow their food. Inside the maloca is the big beer trough of the tapir people. When a particular fruit is in season the juice of this fruit turns into chicha and fills up the vessel. When the tapirs drink water in the salt lick, they really drink the chicha and juice of the fruits in season. When the trough is full of chicha, animals from all parts of the world come to drink. The tapir people from different malocas visit each other; even anacondas and fish come from their underwater malocas in the rivers to drink and dance in the tapirs dance houses. Dressed in full ritual regalia, playing the Yuruparí flutes, they enter with basket loads of forest fruits to drink and dancejust as people do in the harvest season of the wild forest fruits.
In our vision tapirs look like animals but in the vision of the shaman a tapir is a person dressed in animal skin. Thus, whatever people do in this world, tapirs do in theirs. Yet, at the same time their world is the opposite of ours as if in a dream. When it is night in this world, it is daylight in theirs. What is dark and invisible to us is clear and bright to them...

In Makuna thought, the world and all living beings in it have both a material, apparent form and an immaterial, spiritual aspect or essence, perceived by shamans but invisible to ordinary men. Men, game animals, and fish are different bodily manifestations of this spiritual essence, which flows, as it were, between the various domains and life worlds of which nature is composed, appearing in different corporal forms as it changes from fish to game animal to human being and back again in an ever-changing circuit of life.
This reversible process of transformation between different life worlds, and between physical form and spiritual essence, lies at the heart of Makuna concepts of birth and death. Each conversion is simultaneously a death and a rebirth, a passage from one life world into another. Birth is the embodiment of spirit. Makuna see it as a creative movement from the undifferentiated spirit world into the life world of human beings. Death, in a sense, is just the opposite. It separates soul from body and involves a passage from the differ-

entiated universe of corporal forms to the undifferentiated world of spiritual essence. Birth and death are thus, as it were, movements between dimensions of reality. The soul of a diseased person may easily turn into an animal, and much of the work of Makuna shamans aims at securing the cycling of souls within the human life world. Yet, in life as in death, human beings constantly run the risk of loosing their soulsin dreams, during rituals, or when seriously illto the waking-up-houses and life worlds of animals. The loss of a human soul is thus a gain to the animal world; human deaths replenish the game animals in the forest and the fish in the river.
It appears, then, that the spiritual essence shared by men and animals forms a sort of common pool of fertile powers, located in the birth houses of men, fish, and game animals, upon which all life forms draw. The different classes of living beings form different worlds with their own particular characteristics and shapes, but the spiritual essence flows freely between them, animating their different forms of life. Or, to put it differently, the spirit essence circulates between the different life worlds of the Makuna cosmos, bringing all living beings together into an inter-related whole where disparity in outer shape disguises an inner unity of spiritual essence. This fundamental oneness of reality the Makuna call the he world.
In this transformational universe, there is no single, privileged perspective on the world, no single true representation of reality. All living beings are divided into eaters and food, and those who are predators from one point of view, are themselves prey from another. The world looks radically different from the point of view of different seers and eaters: what from one point of view looks like a river full of fish, from another is a rotten carcass full of worms; and what for some appears to be a mudhole full of flies, for others is a beautifully painted maloca. In such a universe, the human-centred conception of reality just becomes one of many, all equally valid, important, and true. The world is multi-centred, and a true understanding of reality requires the capacity to see it from different points of view, or rather

from the points of view of different seers. Makuna shamans have this capacity to identify with different kinds of beings, and see the world their way; indeed, herein rests a great part of their extraordinary powers.
***
Clearly, the Makuna concept of nature is vastly different from ours. Where we stress separateness and discontinuity between nature and culture, they emphasize relatedness and continuity. In their view, men, animals and plants have the same origin, share in the same creative powers, and arein a deep senseessentially identical. All living beings are related and participate in a single cosmic society, ordered by the same, pervasive principles and patterns. Nature and culture are fundamentally one, and the norms governing the relationships among men also apply to the relationships between men and other living beings.
The Makuna world is enchanted, the land sacralized by myth. Myth gives it meaning and instructs people how to use the land. It teaches women how 31 to cultivate the swidden, and gives men the knowledge to hunt and fish without depleting the resources of the forest and the rivers, but also to bless food and prevent illness. Makuna myths encode their vision of the world, and ensure the well-being of the people. The mythical geography of their territory is essential for survival the Makuna way. The entire traditional medical systemtheir ideas about disease and therapeutic practicesrests on the specialised knowledge of the mythical history of the land; the meaning, dangers, and blessings of each named site and its resources, and of every kind of edible or useful plant and animal.
Thus the enchanted world of the Makuna is local, confined to the known and named places of their ancestral territory. Their myths tie them to the land. Their world view, their shamanic knowledge, and their spiritual wealth are literally anchored in the soil of their territory. Torn from their land, the Makuna would not only be deprived of their physical means of survival, but

also of the spiritual resources of coping with life at large. They would lose their culture, their soul as a people.

CHAPTER THREE
People of the Forest

WHEN THE MAKUNA wish to distinguish themselves

32

from the Whites, they call themselves people of the forest, hoari gana. The

term, which broadly corresponds to our notion of Indians, identifies a life-

style and a mode of survival associated with the rain-forest environment.

Indians belong to the forest, Whites do not.

People of the forest are hunters and fishermen, cultivators and gather-

ers. Men hunt and fish, women cultivate, and both men and women gather

foods in the forest. The Makuna treat their environment with care and utilize

its resources with caution. To them, hunting, fishing and cultivation are at

once a means of survival and a meaningful way of life. Grounded in an im-

pressive practical knowledge of rain-forest ecology and charged with pro-

found symbolic significance, their mode of living is a cultural whole, a world-

view in practice.

A Hunter’s Tale
The Makuna view hunting and fishing as part of a continuous exchange between the world of men and the world of nature. The shaman has the power to release game animals and fish from their houses in the rivers and the forest. In his mind and by means of his silent chant, the shaman travels to these invisible houses where he meets and talks with the spirit-owners and guardians of the animals. He asks them to release the game and fish, which later become the hunters prey and the fishermans catch. The deliberations between the shaman and the spirit-owners are said to be like marriage negotiations, and the successful hunt is metaphorically compared to a completed marriagean exchange of women between clans.
By means of his chanting, the shaman negotiates the release of game animals from their houses in the forest. But it is the task of the hunter actually to find and kill the animals. The hunter uses his skills to attract and seduce the game and as such hunting is, for the Makuna, a form of courtship. Hunter and prey are related like man and woman, seducer and seduced. Conversely, the relationship between a man and his prospective brideand any potential sexual partneris compared to the relationship between hunter and prey. The story of bride capture recounted earlier must be understood in this light, as the Makuna talk of capturing women like they talk of hunting. If the hunt symbolically is a form of courtship, bride capture is a kind of huntthe man seduces, conquers, and symbolically kills his prey.
Like marriage and sex, hunting for the Makuna has a double aspect of exchange and predation. The hunter kills his prey, but only after the shaman has made a mystical pact with the spirit-owners of the animals. The animal slain, just as a woman obtained in marriage, has to be reciprocated. So the hunt is also described as an exchange of food between men and animals. What to ordinary men looks like a hunters bag, slain and brought to the house, appears to the shaman as a gift of food from the spirits. When the

shaman chants in the centre of the maloca, he in fact travels to the houses of the animals and offers them coca and tobaccothe foods of the spiritsin return for the hunters bag.
Just as the relationship among different exogamous groups is fragile and unstable, the relationship between men and animals is potentially antagonistic. And just as a marriage may easily break up and lead to strife between affines, the relationship between people and game animals may lead to metaphysical warfare. In Makuna anthropomorphic cosmology not only do people prey on animals but animals also prey on people. Hunting has a price; men kill to survive at the cost of being killed and consumed themselves by the animal spirits. Men are the food of spirits. When a person falls sick, Makuna believe that he or she falls victim to a predatory spirit, often in the guise of a game animal or fish. In this universe, where the hunter simultaneously is prey and the prey hunter, an animal killed means a human being reborn and the death of a human being implies the birth of an animal. Killing, death, and 33 disease thus form necessary parts of the generative circuit of life. Hunting is a creative act, the regenerative work of men corresponding to the life-giving labour of women as mothers and cultivators.
Most Makuna rituals aim at preserving or restoring this pact of reciprocity between men and nature, thus ensuring peace and order in the cosmic society of men, spirits, animals, and plants. Ritual, marriage and hunting are all variants of the same themethe fundamental principle of exchange which pervades every aspect of Makuna life. At the seasonal he-fruit ritual, for example, when ripe fruits are brought from the forest, the guardians of the fruitsrepresented as animal spirits and embodied in the sacred Yuruparí instrumentsare invited to come and dance, drink, and feast with the men of the maloca. In return, the shaman asks the spirit-animals to release abundant supplies of forest fruits to the people. At another great Makuna ritual, the Spirit Dance, men and young boys dress in bark cloth costumes and painted masks to represent all kinds of animal spirits coming as honoured

guests to eat, drink, and dance with people, ensuring the regeneration of nature and the reproduction of society. These, and other rituals, form part of the continuous exchange with the natural world which allows people to use the common resources of the rivers and the forest on which they allanimals, plants and mendepend.
Formerly the shaman supervised and regulated hunting and fishing, and thereby guarded against environmental mismanagement. Today shamans no longer intervene in the daily subsistence activities. Yet, any sign of over-exploitation of the forest and river resources is strongly condemned by the community. At ritual food feasts, such as the Spirit Dance and the dabucurí ceremonies, when large amounts of fish, meat, and plant food are exchanged, the services of the shaman are needed to secure abundant food supplies as well as to protect both those who procure the food and those who ritually consume it. Game animals and fish may only be killed and caught beyond the immediate needs of the family in preparation for important, collective rituals, when meat and fish are shared among various families. This activity is only engaged in with the explicit approval of the shaman and through his mystical mediation.
If this moral code is transgressed by men who hunt and fish beyond their domestic needs without the consent of the shaman, the animals are believed to take vengeance. Illness and misfortune befall the imprudent hunter or fisherman as his soul is captured by the animal spirits and taken to their houses in the forest or river. Unless retrieved by a shaman, the victim wastes away and dies. In effect, these shamanic beliefs imply a strong ideological sanction against the overuse of the environmental resources. Today however, say the Makuna, people tend to ignore the hunting code and kill game animals in excess; when shamans visit the houses of the animals they see, hanging like old dresses along the inner walls of the maloca, only tattered skins perforated by bullets and arrows.

***
The close community between men and animals in Makuna thought reflects their dependence on nature in everyday life. The following incident, which took place during a peccary hunt, exemplifies this mystical involvement with nature which lies at the centre of their way of life. After a long trek with Hacinto, a young Makuna hunter, we eventually smelled the peccaries at close quarters. As we climbed a gentle hill, we came upon a herd of at least fifty animals. I was stunned by the sudden encounter but Hacinto immediately fired his gun into the herd and wounded one animal as the rest scattered. He reloaded and fired again but this time missed entirely. Running after the fleeing animals Hacinto shouted at me to stay and watch the injured one.
The peccary was now lying on the ground. With blood trickling from his side, he looked at me intently. For a long while we just stared at each other. I felt strangely at a loss. Should I try to kill him? Or just wait for Hacinto to come back? My confusion was mixed with a feeling of compassion. His gaze 34 made me feel pity, and something in his frightened eyes made him peculiarly human to me. Suddenly he rose to his feet and my pity gave way to fear; a fear of the utterly strange and unknowna beast from another world. Was he going to attack me? I looked for a tree in case I had to climb to safety. But he stood quite still, without taking his eyes from me. The thought crossed my mind that if I didnt kill him, he would escape. But kill him with what? Should I grab a stick and hit him? But what if hes stronger than me? As my tension and bewilderment grew, he started to move. First slowly, then faster. He ran away and disappeared into the forest. Only a faint trail of blood was left on the forest floor.
I stood rooted to the spot, feeling foolish but yet relieved by his escape. After a while Hacinto returned empty-handed and irritated. He reprimanded me for having let the wounded animal escape. He was almost dead! How could you let him go? You should have beaten him on the head with a stick

and killed him. Now we have nothing to eat tonight. Hacinto soon calmed down, however, and as went back along another peccary trail we came after a while to a clearing in the forest. This is the house of the peccaries, Hacinto said. It is their maloca. Over there is their eating place, he continued, pointing to a bare, trampled spot on the ground, full of crushed seeds and nutshells. And this is where they sleep. There is their path down to the stream where they bathe and drink water. A trail led down to a small stream. Indeed, the whole place resembled an abandoned Makuna hunting camp. We were tired and sat down to rest in the clearing. Leaning against a fallen tree trunk, I fell asleep. I woke up as Hacinto gently shook my shoulder saying that it was late and we had to go back to the maloca before nightfall.
Darkness had fallen when we arrived home. Hacinto told the others about our mishaps. I went to sleep hungry and somewhat gloomy. The next thing I remember was waking up in the middle of the night, hot and sweating, and with a terrible headache. To my surprise I found the shaman of the house squatting by my hammock. There was a fire burning and the old man was blowing and mumbling over a gourd of water. When he saw that I was awake he looked up and said, almost in a whisper: Dont worry, it will be all right. You have been grunting like a wild boar all night. The peccaries took your soul away. They took it to their house and turned you into a peccary. But I went there and brought you back. Your soul has returned, you are safe now. Drink this blessed water and you will be relieved. I drank the water. I must have been running a very high temperature. My shirt was drenched, and my head felt like it would explode. In disbelief, and wondering whether in fact I had suffered from sunstroke, I fell asleep again. In the late morning I woke feeling well, with no trace of the previous nights pain. The old shaman lay in his hammock smiling at me with an expression of pride on his wrinkled face.
The nights suffering made perfect sense to the Makuna. We had injured a game animal, and I had entered a particular relationship with one of them. As a result the peccaries had called me to their house; perhaps in revenge, per-

haps as a foreigner merely out of curiosity. They had captured my soul and I lacked the knowledge to protect myself. Fortunately a shaman was at hand to return my soul to my body.
***
In hunting and fishing, the Makuna rely to a great extent on their knowledge of the local environment and the habits of the animals. They know where and when certain animals are available; their feeding habits, sounds, and tracks. Hunting and fishing involve tracking and attracting animals - luring them near by imitating their sounds, or by using seductive baits. The image of the hunt as courtship and deadly seduction thus makes very practical sense.
The Makuna use the blowpipe and poisoned darts to hunt monkeys and large birds living in the canopy; the bow and arrow for other birds, peccaries, deer, rodents, and sometimes even tapir. Nowadays they use shotguns for all kinds of game and there is usually a gun or two in every settlement. If ammunition is available, the gun is the preferred hunting weapon, carried along 35 on all trips in the forest. Often, however, Makuna hunters are short of ammunition and must rely on their traditional hunting weapons, or choose to redirect their subsistence efforts to the more regular and accessible supply of fish.
The most common game animals are the pacaa large rodent with tender meatand its smaller relative, the agouti; the two species of peccary; monkeys, armadillos, and caymans; a variety of game birds including toucans, curassows, guans, and tinamous. Hunted at night along the river beds, by canoe and with flashlight, the paca is by far the most important in the diet. Peccaries, which roam the forest in big herds, are most easily tracked down by hunting dogs and then killed by shotgun, spears or even clubs. Big game birds such as curassows and guans are hunted at dawn; their presence is disclosed by their conspicuous calls and they are killed with blowpipe or shotgun. Tinamous are hunted at sunset or just after dark when they settle to

sleep on the lower branches of the trees. Caymans are usually hunted at night, using torch or flashlight, and are killed by gunshot or by a well-measured blow with the machete.
Because of its size and delicious meat, the tapir is perhaps the most coveted game but also least hunted. Tapirs are prototypical spirit-animals and as such their hunt is surrounded by rules and restrictions. The Makuna believe that tapirslike jaguars and anacondasharbour the souls of dead people. The salt licks, where tapirs gather to browse and drink, are their birth-and dance houses, and the waking-up-houses of people. Only with the consent of the shaman and in preparation for ritual food feasts may they therefore be hunted in the salt licks. Solitary animals may however be killed when occasionally met with in the forest.
While the hunting equipment is relatively simple, fishing tools and techniques are diverse and elaborate. Traditional Makuna fishing technology includes the use of rod and line, short hand lines, long lines, scoop nets, traps of all kinds, fishing spears, bows and arrows, and fish poison of various types. Each tool and technique is appropriate for the catch of particular species, at particular times and places.
The Makuna catch a variety of food fishes. The sábalo, sabaleta, palometa, and waracú are migratory characins with a tasty meat, often caught in large quantities as they feed on falling fruits in the flooded forest or travel in shoals between their up-river feeding grounds and down-river spawning sites. The taraira is a nocturnal, predatory fish, tasteless but easy to kill as it lies still in the shallow waters at the rivers edge, waiting for its prey. The pintadillo, a big, striped catfish often measuring a metre or more in length, is caught with baited line in the deepest parts of the rivers. When caught, a single specimensmoked and cookedprovides food for a family for several days.
Apart from the big and medium-size fish, the Makuna regularly catch small and young fish, the fish children or sardinas in Spanish, which is the basic source of protein for small children as well as adults during periods of

ritual food restrictionsafter important ceremonies, childbirth, and during illness.
***
A characteristic feature of Makuna culture is that subsistence efforts and food intake are geared, not only to the natural seasonal rhythm, but also to the life-cycle rituals of individuals and the collective rituals of the community. Some foods are periodically and selectively prohibited, depending on the age, sex, and ritual status of the individual. At a particular point in time, the male head of a family, for example, may eat meat and fish without restriction, while his nursing wife is allowed to eat only certain varieties of fish, their small children sardinas, and a recently initiated boy no meat or fish whatsoever. This arrangement entails in practice that a hunter, who comes home with a bag of meat after a long day in the forest, immediately may have to set out on a fishing expedition, while his wife and children collect fruits in the forest and catch sardinas at the canoe landing. Though strenuous this 36 custom also has a very practical ecological consequence as it diversifies resource utilization and thus spreads the pressure on the environment.
The integration of practical knowledge and cosmological beliefs turns the Makuna mode of subsistence into an efficient system of resource management. Their mythical geography has important implications for human land use. Myths, in effect, are land use plansand extremely efficient ones at that since they are at the same time pragmatically informed, emotionally charged, and morally binding. Thus, for example, is every bend, stretch, pool, and rapid in the river known by name and associated with a mythical story. Depending on the story it tells, the place is believed to be either harmless or harmful. Fish swimming in harmful waters are dangerous to eat; they cause illness and death, and fishing is consequently prohibited at these sites. A river section may be harmful because it contains the fire or blood of the ancestors, or is polluted by ancestral yagé or dart poison. Particularly danger-

ous are the fish houses, the sites where the fish spawn. Other sections of the river are said to be harmless because they are associated with the benevolent deeds of the ancestors. In this way, by dividing the rivers into sections which are safe and others which are dangerous, the Makuna often exclude more than half the length of any river from fishing. The harmful sections, where fishing is prohibited, are called wai huna, places where the fish cause pain and as such constitute a kind of protected area or river reserve.
Forest Fruits
With its multitude of life forms the forest provides the Makuna with a variety of foods gathered with comparatively little effort. The Makuna seasonally collect an impressive amount of wild fruits and nutsmore than twenty varietieswhich complement their diet. In a sense, the forest is a natural garden, a notion which corresponds to its symbolic image in Makuna mythology. The forest, it is said, is the garden of the mythical Male Heroes, the Ayawaroa, and the wild fruits are their crops. The Makuna term for forest fruits, he rica, alludes to this symbolic association between forest fruits and the he-people, the ancestral spirit beings.
Forest fruits are distinguished from the cultivated plants, ote, of the swidden. This distinction has a clear sexual connotation: the forest is the domain of men, the cultivated garden belongs to women. Accordingly, forest fruitsmythically identified as the crops of the Male Heroesare mainly collected by men in the context of ritual and feasting. The cultivated plants, in contrast, referred to in myth as the children of the plant mother (ote haco ria), are planted, tended and reaped by women for domestic consumption.
The forest fruits are the focus of various important collective rituals. Their seasonal harvest is a source of a great interest, apparently out of proportion to their importance in the diet. While walking through the forest, the Indians

constantly watch for fallen fruits and make long detours to collect a handful of fruits, which they examine and consume, commenting on their shape, colour and taste. When in season, people from different localities come together in camps in the forest to collect them, at times by cutting down whole trees to collect the fruits on the ground. Men, women and children also collect and consume fruits in smaller quantities as they hunt, fish, or wander in the forest.
During the long, wet season, when fruits abound in the forest, large-scale rituals are celebrated during which the fruitsalong with ants, grubs and other seasonal forest foodsare shared and exchanged among groups. At the he-fruit ritual men from different settlements are invited to bring forest fruits to the dance maloca. Carrying the fruits in baskets on their backs and playing the Yuruparí instrumentsthe he rica samarathe men enter the maloca in a long line, depositing the fruits on the ground in front of the host. During a pause in the dance, the host then redistributes the fruits among the 37 participants. Throughout the ritual, the shaman blows over the fruits and protects the dancers from the danger of the visiting he-people, embodied in the sacred flutes.
According to Makuna myths, the forest fruits originally grew from the soil where Woman Shaman gave birth to her anaconda children and spilled her menstrual blood. The fruits thus contain the fire and potent heat of her blood, and are therefore potentially harmful to eat. The forest fruits are also food for innumerable animals of the forest. In the he-fruit ritual, the Yuruparí flutes represent the owners of the fruits, who are invited to come and share food with people. The ritual is performed to ensure a plentiful harvest of fruits, and to appease their spirit-owners. The shaman blesses and cools the fruits by blowing and chanting over them, and on behalf of his people asks the spirit-owners for permission to harvest a fair share. In return he offers coca and tobacco to the spirits. If the ritual is not properly performed, there will be a poor harvest, and people will fall sick and die when they eat the

fruits as the spirit-owners take revenge for being disrespected. The forest not only yields plentiful plant food, but also abounds with
edible ants, termites, larvae, and frogs. Edible larvae and wild fruits tend to be symbolically equated; both are seasonal in the sense that the former swarm when the latter come into season, and certain larvae feed exclusively on particular fruit trees. Hence they are gathered and their harvests jointly celebrated. Certain species of caterpillars and grubs are collected and celebrated with even greater enthusiasm than the forest fruits. When these edible larvae are abundant in the forest, it is as if a collective trance seizes the community. People collect as many they can, and those too young or too old go from house to house to ask for roasted, cooked, or raw larvae.
Certain varieties of grubs, feeding on the decaying trunks of particular palm trees, are manipulated in a semi-domesticated manner: palm trees are selectively cut at comfortable walking distance from the settlement and left to rot to attract the parent beetles. The decaying trunks in which the eggs of the beetle develop into grubs thus serve as a store of protein-rich snacks, collected at convenience to supplement the diet.
Until recently, the forest and the river provided the Makuna with all they needed for survivalnot only animal and plant food, but also raw materials for their houses, weapons, tools and household goods; large cedars for canoes, termite-resistant wood for house posts, palm fronds for thatching, bark for making walls and cloth, fibres for making ropes, fishing nets and hammocks, poison for hunting and fishing, clay for pottery, and plentiful material for basketry. Though new needs are making their inroads in Makuna society and the demand for trade goods is growing, the forest and its yield are still the basis for their existence. In fact, as the Makuna now become increasingly aware of the contrast in life style between themselves and the Whites they tend to be even more committed to their identity as people of the forest.

The Swidden
The lush vegetation and biological richness of the rain-forest conceals a poverty of soils. Formed through thousands of years of leaching the Northwest Amazonian soils are ancient, weathered, and infertile. Most of the nutrients in the forest are stored in the vegetation and less than 10 per cent are found in the soil. The rain-forest environment is a closed system, continuously and efficiently recycling the same nutrients. As soon as a leaf or branch withers and falls to the ground, it begins to decay as micro-organismsfungi and bacteriaattack the debris and accelerate the process while roots help the plants absorb the released nutrients. But precisely because the re-absorption of the nutrients in the vegetation is so rapid, the soil is never effectively fertilized.
The dense vegetation protects the fragile soils and reduces erosion and leaching. The roots of the trees act as sponges, absorbing the rain and releasing it slowly, thereby counterbalancing the seasonal extremes of rain and 38 heat. Consequently, if the protective forest is removed, the soil is washed away by the rainstorms and burnt by the tropical sun. The Makuna are well aware of these features of their environment and their insights are put into practice through an elaborate system of swiddenor shiftingcultivation.
The bulk of the food in the Makuna diet comes from the cultivated gardenthe swidden. Each year before the rains the men clear and burn a patch of forest. With the onset of the rains, the women begin to plant the crops. Each household simultaneously utilizes several gardens in different stages of maturation. While the recently burnt garden is being planted, older ones are harvested. The staple, bitter manioc, provides good yields for only two to three years but sweet potatoes, yams, pineapple, tree grapes and several other crops are harvested for many more years. The transition from swidden to secondary forest is thus gradual with the harvest tapering off over a long period. Among some groups of Amazonian shifting cultivators fallows may

be productive for fifteen years and selectively harvested for even longer periods.
Recent ecological studies of indigenous swidden agriculture in the Amazon also reveal that fallows are often actively managed. In fact, even the natural forest is likely to be manipulated. A number of wild plants that are part of the forest regeneration process are thus tended and utilized by the Indians, and plants may be transplanted from old to new garden sites, and from primary forest to secondary forest close to human settlement areas. There is thus no clear-cut distinction between swidden and fallow, nor between fallow and natural forest. Rather there is a continuum from the swidden dominated by cultivated crops and an old fallow composed entirely of natural vegetation.
Fallows also attract a number of coveted game animalspeccaries, agoutis, and deer among othersmaking the overgrown garden an important hunting ground. By inventively manipulating and upgrading the secondary forest for human use the Indians thus create man-made resource concentrations animal gardens and forest fieldswhich form part of an integrated system of forest management.
In various significant ways, then, the natural forest can be seen as a vast, overgrown garden. Walking along a forest trail or following a stream, the Makuna name and point to different sites, which to the untrained eye are indistinguishable from the surrounding forest, but to them are known to be old house sites, abandoned fields, and still used fallows. The forest is not as wild and virgin as it appears. It is quite literally a home and a garden, full of memories and replete with human history; it bears the signs of remembered dead, traces of the lives and works of named and known relatives. The Makuna notion of the forest as the garden of the ancestors is quite literally true.
***
At first sight, a Makuna garden does not seem an impressive feat. It resem-

bles an overgrown clearing in the forest, where the crops struggle against the encroaching wilderness. A typical swidden is rarely bigger than a hectare, with charred tree trunks and branches lying in heaps over the clearing. Recently planted, it looks hopelessly entangled, and presents an almost impassable obstacle to the untrained traveller. But to the Makuna the swidden is an open field. Balancing on stocks and branches, passing over and under felled trunks, they easily find their way. Amongst the trunks, stumps, and heaps of branches, grow a variety of roots and fruit trees of different sizes and heights. The Makuna cultivate more than thirty different food crops, most of them found in any single garden including well-known aboriginal Amazonian crops such as manioc, sweet potato, yam, arrowroot, pineapple, chilli pepper, plantain, banana, cashew, papaya, avocado, and squash to mention only a few. While the women plant food crops, men grow coca and tobacco. The garden thus contains both male and female plants: the ordinary food crops, most of which are harvested by women, and the ritual foods, reaped by men. As 39 with every other aspect of Makuna culture the garden expresses the fundamental complementarity of men and women.
There are ecologically sound reasons for the chaotic appearance of the Makuna garden. The diversity of plants reduces the risk for crop disease and competition for nutrients. The interplanting of crops of different sizes and heights protects the fragile soils from the impact of sun and rain. In important respects, the swidden mimics the rain forest itself, its diversity, density and multi-layered structure. The small size of the garden allows secondary forest to conquer the clearing over a period of some 20-30 years. The burning of the felled trees and the slow decomposition of unburnt debris release the nutrients fixed in the vegetation and fertilize the soil. Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, extensive swidden cultivation is probably the most rational form of agricultural land-use in the tropical rain forest. The system produces a sustained yield of food crops in an environment where intensive field agricultureeven with the most modern techniqueswould

fail. Moreover, as the swidden forms part of an integral system of forest management including also fishing, hunting, gathering and the harvesting of manmade forest fields, the productivity of swidden-based indigenous land use systems is much greater than previously realized.
***
Ecologically the swidden resembles the forest, and in practical terms the transition from fallow to natural vegetation may be gradual and indistinct, but symbolically the Makuna sharply differentiate the garden from its surroundings. The forest, as noted above, is the domain of men and spirits. Men hunt in the forest, fish in its rivers, and collect wild fruits for the communal exchange rituals. The manioc garden, in contrast, is the domain of women and children and as such intimately associated with female fertility and procreative power. There is a myth about the origin of manioc in which Yawira, the daughter of Water Anaconda and wife of Yiba, planted the first manioc by breaking her fingers and sticking them into the earth. The primal manioc crop thus grew, as it were, out of Yawiras own body. She is therefore also referred to as the mother of the cultivated crops or simply plant mother, ote haco.
In their daily work in the garden, women identify themselves with their ancestress, the plant mother. They compare the manioc garden to her womb, and the growing plants to her children. Planting is like giving birth, and tending the garden like nursing their own children. Accordingly, women give birth to children in the manioc gardenthe fertile womb of the plant mother. And after delivery the mother carries the new-born child to the maloca, just as she carries her daily harvest from garden to house. This symbolic identitywidespread in the Amazon areabetween procreation and cultivation makes women, not men, the supreme agriculturalists: women are mothers, and the crops are their children.
The long process of preparing manioc bread - grinding, squeezing and baking - is also symbolically elaborated. The various parts of the processed

tubers are metaphorically associated with the different substances of the human body: the starch and juice correspond to the body liquids, the dry fibre to the hard bone. The separation and final recombination of starch and fibre in the preparation of the bread symbolize the physical formation of the child, the integration of bone and blood, soul and body. Baking becomes an act of creation.
Among the Makuna, then, even the most mundane and ordinary tasks, such as gardening and baking, are highly meaningful. The relationship Makuna women have with the land and its produce is one of intimacy and community. Since gardening and the preparation of manioc bread are compared to giving birth and nursing children, and hunting to marrying and ritualized exchanges among men, there are strong inducements for using the tropical forest environment with caution and care.

Food Shamanism

40

The blessing of food, bare keare, is perhaps the most visible and recurrent aspect of Makuna shamanic practices. At all times, and in every place, men silently chant and blow spells over a piece of food or a gourd of liquid. Practically nothing is eaten unless first blessed, and virtually everything brought from the forest or the riverplants and animalspass through the hands of senior men, who by means of chanting and blowing convert the potentially harmful beings of nature into life-sustaining food for human beings.
One particular incident comes to mind. A man, Amasio, sits on a stool on the yard in front of his thatched house of poles and woven palm fronds busily carving a wooden mask for a coming ritual. A woman comes up to him with a piece of meat on a small stick in her hand. She asks Amasio to bless the meat for her young son. Amasio receives the meat, places it on his lap, and continues carving. After a while he pauses, puts his tools aside, picks up the

meat, and begins to blow as he holds the meat close to his mouth, breathing rhythmically over it and muttering a hardly audible chant. As he sits blowing and chanting, another woman comes forward, asking him to bless some berries in a gourd. He signals to her with his head to place the gourd on the ground in front of him. He stops blowing, calls on the first woman to come and receive the blessed meat. He hands it over to her while giving her some instructions, and then returns to his woodwork. After a while he again pauses, takes the gourd of berries in one hand and begins to blow. When ready, he calls on the second woman and hands the blessed berries over to her with instructions. He then continues carving...
The scene is typical. Blowing and carving, blowing and weaving, blowing and repairing fishing gear. So it goes, with shamanic and manual labour continuously alternating, both forming equally important parts of a mans daily work. A considerable portion of mens time is thus spent in blowing over food. Some, like Amasio, are known for their skills in food shamanism. In fact, men tend to specialize in different kinds of food shamanism as certain individuals become experts in blessing particular foods. In this way, most men make themselves useful for the community as a whole.
***
To the Makuna, all food is ambivalent and powerful; it sustains life and gives strength, but may also kill and cause disease. Forest fruits, cultivated crops, fish and gameall share in the powers of creation. They contain the primordial substances from which the world was made, the powers of creation and destruction, life and death. The Makuna say that plants and animals received powerful weapons or defences from the substances out of which they emerged and, in the case of animals, through the foods they eat. Forest fruits, for example, emerged from the stained soil where Woman Shaman shed her blood, and thus received her ancestral fire. Animalsinsects, fish, and gamewere born out of the materials from which the mythical heroes fabri-

cated the first ritual goods - the ancient Yuruparí instruments and the sacred

feather crowns. All the animals which feed on the leaves, flowers and fruits

of the forest thus have in their bodies the ancestral fire of Woman Shaman,

and insect-eating animals contain the left-over palm splinters and chips of

the primal Yuruparí instruments. Because they possess these powerful prop-

ertiestheir weaponswhich derive from creation itself, plants and ani-

mals are considered inherently dangerous to eat. Herbivorous animals cause

fever and vomiting, insect-eating animals sores, coughing and severe itching.

The weapons of fish and game animals are visualized, like the de-

fenceskuni ocaof human beings, as their ritual goods and shamanic sub-

stances; a kind of Yuruparí instruments, feather crowns, and dance regalia of

the animals, and their own varieties of coca and snuff, chicha and yagé. Thus

animals have their ritual regalia and shamanic substances, their own ritual

dances and knowledgein short, soul. As such, they are people and there-

fore particularly powerful and potentially harmful to humans.

41

These ideas about the weapons of all living beings, form the basis of

Makuna theories of illness and curing. Food shamanism amounts to a sort of

preventive therapy, a mystical means of evading and removing the dangers of

eating. All foods are blessed in a similar mannerby blowing and chanting,

each class of food requiring a distinct chant. The dangers of food are thereby

controlled and the destructive weapons removed.

Only adult men have this knowledge. Some Makuna say that, in his mind

and by means of the silent chant, the food blesser collects the weapons of

the food, ties them together, breaks them and throws them away through the

doorways of the world. Others say that the blesser carefully collects the sa-

cred goods of the killed animal and return it to its birth- and dance house. Or

again, in the words of the shaman cited earlier: ...the powerful substances

contained in the meat must be removed and restored to their proper places in

the dance houses of the animals. (The meat) has to be converted into food by

means of food shamanism. The person, who knows how to bless food, con-

verts the (tapirs) meat into cassava bread or cultivated plants like plantain or pineapple... When blessing forest fruits, either a shaman may cool the fruit by evokingin his chantthe juicy liquid from certain sweet berries, or he can mentally pass on the fruit to fruit-eating animals like, for example, the capuchin monkey (gake). The monkey then eats the fruit instead of the human being, who thereby avoids its harmful consequencesa form of shamanic substitution.
Food blessing thus varies according to context, from individual to individual, and from one shaman to another. Animals and plants from one part of the forest require their own particular chants, as different from those of another part. When blowing over peccary meat, for example, a shaman from the headwaters of Komenya said that he collects all the seeds, nuts and fruits on which the peccary feed and which make up his armoury; he ties them up, breaks them, throws them out of this world and closes the doors of the world so that the spirit of the peccary cannot return to haunt the people who eat its meat. If this is not done, the fire of Woman Shamans menstrual blood will cause fever, the grubs on which the peccary has fed will eat the victims body from within and cause sores and boils. The spirit of the peccary may capture the soul of the victim, and take him to the waking-up-house of the peccaries; this means that the victim will fall sick and ultimately die.
In spite of individual and local variations, a general pattern of food shamanism emerges. The weapons of the slain animals are collected and removed. But not only must the food blesser collect the weapons that an animal receives through the food it eats; he must also remove the danger deriving from the predators feeding on, and the animals living in association with itits owners and helpers, to speak in the Makuna shamanic idiom. The same is true for the blessing of wild forest fruits, which also have their ownersthe fruit eating animals feeding on them. For each species, the blesser must, in his silent chant, cover the entire food chain in which the species in question participates, including the owner-animals from which

man steals food. The Makuna are thus acutely aware of the fact that a kill or a catch interferes with the complex web of life which constitutes the rain forest ecosystem. They also recognize in thought and action that human beings form an integral part of this community of living beings, in which the death of one means life for another.
***
Each category of food has to be blessed and subsequently introduced to every Makuna individual. In this way the young child gradually encounters all food a process which takes some 5-7 years. The sequence is then repeated in abbreviated versions during and after every collective ritual, particularly when the Yuruparí instruments are shown and yagé drunk.
Food restrictions are also selectively imposed at the birth of a child, after a girls first menstruation, and during serious illness. All these instances have in common the potentially dangerous contact with the he world. At birth, the soul of the new-born child travels from the he world into this one. At 42 every ritual, but particularly during male initiation, the participants establish a voluntary contact with the ancestral world in order to be reborn, to change soul, and to recreate in the present the cosmic order established in the mythical past. As they give birth and while menstruating, women are subject to a natural, involuntary but regenerative contact with the he world. During illness, the patient again faces the potentially harmful powers of the spirits. The Makuna attribute illness to many causes: to the eating of wrong, prohibited, or unblessed food, to sorcery coming from evil shamans, and to exposure to the powerful and predatory spirits invoked at major rituals. If not properly treated, the sick person is likely to die. The soul will be taken away, out of this world and into the sky world or the underworld or, again, to the waking-up-houses of the animals. To the Makuna, all these other worlds are different dimensions of that single, fundamental, and alternative reality the he-world.

The food restrictions imposed on each of these occasions are only gradually removed, and food is successively reintroduced by the blessing of each class in a fixed order. The sequence of food blessing following the male initiation ritual is perhaps the most complete one and provides a good example of the process. At first the diet consists exclusively of thin starch bread, raw and toasted ants and termites, always eaten cold and unspiced. After some time cold manioc juice, vegetable foodparticularly palm heart and the boiled leaves of the manioc plantand wild forest fruits are introduced. Then follows a ritual at which pepper is shamanized. This ritual removes the danger of heat and fire, and the restriction on hot and peppered food is lifted. The pepper shamanism is followed by the blessing of fresh manioc bread, and boiled sardinas. Subsequently other kinds of fish and small game are gradually introduced in the diet, roughly in order of size. The whole series culminates with the blessing of tapir meat at a communal ceremony, after which the initiates return to their ordinary diet.
The food-blessing sequence can be understood as a series of symbolic movements through various domains and dimensions of the Makuna cosmos. The overall movement corresponds to a progression from bloodless foods (plants and insects) to blood rich animal food, and from minimally processed (cold, raw, and unspiced) foods to increasingly processed (hot, cooked, smoked, and spiced) foods. This progression seems to allude to the process of initiation by which the initiate, symbolically killed and identified with the non-human spirit world, is reborn and gradually reintegrated into the cultural world of human beings. The sequence of food blessing can also be seen as a movement from underground root crops (manioc) and creatures living below the ground (ants and termites), to above-ground plants (vegetables and forest fruits). In the process, the initiate symbolically emerges from the ground like a growing plant. The growth of a new-born child and a socially reborn initiate is thus metaphorically compared to that of a manioc plant.

After the pepper shamanism, there is a clear progression from small fish to larger fish and game animals; the sequence of food blessing now describes a movement from water to land which replicates the emergence of the ancestral people from river to land at the birthplaces of the different clans. In other words, the rebirth of the young boys at the initiation ceremony evokes the mythic image of the collective emergence of the clan, and also the chain of creative transformation of fish children into fish and ultimately into old fishthe land-living game animals. This sequence of food blessing also implies a movement from female to male; from foods collected principally or exclusively by women to foods exclusively procured by men: the big fish and game. In the Makuna dietary idiom this process intimates that the initiate, like the small child, gradually grows away from the private world of the mother towards the male-dominated social world of adults. At the end of the sequence both male and female foods are eaten, emphasizing the interdependence between men and women in society. Just as men and women nec- 43 essarily co-operate in life, no meal is complete without their complementary contribution. As a metaphor of society and the human condition in general, even the ordinary meal is rich in cultural meaning.
There are other possible messages encoded in Makuna food symbolism. The sequence of food blessing can perhaps also be said to describe an upward movement in the ecological pyramid from plants and insects to fish and game, thus turning it into another expression of Makuna ecological awareness. There is also the temptation to recognize in this process an evolutionary concept of creation, in which ontogeny repeats phylogeny and the history of creation is inscribed in the life-history of the individual. Just as the myth about the flooding and burning of the primordial world evokes the evolutionary history of their land, Makuna food shamanism seems to offer a symbolic comment on the emergence and interdependence of the multiple life forms which make up the tropical forest environment.
However far one wants to push this interpretation, it is evident that Makuna

food symbolism is complex and profuse. Food is saturated with meaning, its preparation and consumption subtly ritualized. While based on a detailed knowledge of the rain-forest environment, gained over thousands of years of carefully using its resources, the Makuna way of life also expresses a world view and a profoundly moral attitude to nature. To cultivate, to fish and to hunt in the correct manner, and to eat the right food at the right time, is a way of maintaining health and recreating the social and cosmic order. To proceed in the wrong manner, and to eat the wrong food at the wrong time, upsets the cosmic order and causes misfortune, disease and death. By following their ancestral traditions the Makuna thus sustain and continuously reshape the meaningful world in which they live.

CHAPTER FOUR
The Longhouse

LOCATED IN A forest clearing, near a river or small stream,

44

the large traditional longhousethe malocais the centre of the Makuna

world; a whole village under one roof, communal dwelling, meeting place,

and temple. The maloca is a world unto itself, the Makuna cosmos writ small.

The imposing beauty of its architecture, set in a large open space encir-

cled by gardens and groves of palms and fruit trees, establishes the maloca as

an oasis of culture in the endless expanse of forest. A network of well-trod-

den paths converges on the settlement. One leads from the river, where ca-

noes are moored, to the front of the maloca; others from the forest to the

backyard of the settlement, where a variety of kitchen- and medicine plants

grow, including tobacco, gourds, pepper, yagé vines, and fish poison plants.

The multi-family maloca was until recently the traditional settlement of

all Tukanoan groups in the Pirá-Paraná area. Today malocas are sparsely dis-

tributed among the larger, nucleated village communities and small, single-

family settlements which have supplanted them. However, two types of malocas, both of majestic proportions, are still found in the Makuna territory: the rectangular longhouse, previously common in the Pirá-Paraná area, measuring up to 40 m in length and 10 m in height, and the roundhouse along the Apaporis river, with a diameter of 20 m or more. A thatched roof of palm fronds covers the wooden structure, the eaves of the roof almost reaching to the ground. The following description refers, when not otherwise specified, to the longhouse of the Komenya Makuna.
Constructed entirely from materials of the foresttree trunks, palm leaves, vines, and barkthe maloca is functionally well adapted to the tropical rainforest environment. The roof, usually changed after 6-8 years as it rots and becomes infested with bugs, is woven from the fronds of various palm species, each emblematically associated with a particular clan. The supporting house posts, named after the clan ancestors, are made of a naturally termite-resistant wood, and the low walls of woven palm leaves or bark. Sometimes the front is decorated with multicoloured designs, depicting sacred petroglyphs or the yagé-induced visions of its inhabitants. The maloca itself has only two entrancesone at the front, called the mens door, and one at the rear, called the womens doorwhich ensure relatively dry and constant conditions in the spacious interior. During the day small fires smoulder in the two entrances, producing a thick smoke screen which repels insects. At night, when a cool breeze from the forest sweeps through the maloca, the family hearths spread a cosy warmth inside.
Each maloca is identified with its headman, the leader and spokesman of the group inhabiting it and usually the man who took the initiative of building the house and, together with an officiating shaman, supervised its construction. As so many other Makuna labours the construction of a new maloca is a lengthy and collective process, punctuated by rituals and feasting. The house is usually built in the centre of an abandoned garden after the crops have been harvested and the land successively cleared of logs and de-

bris. Before trees and vines are cut in the forest to provide building material, and before the leaves for the roof may be collected, the shaman asks permission from the spirit owners of the forest to cut the trees and collect the leaves. Many months later, when the maloca is complete, an inauguration ritual is performed, during which the men of the maloca offer coca and snuff to the spirit owners of the trees and palms from which the building materials were obtained. During this ritual the soft, sandy ground of the new house is sprinkled with water and then hardened by the stamping feet of the dancers. The dance re-enacts the origin myth when the ancestral he people walked across the earth, creating mountains and rivers and hardening its soil.
The dance of inauguration is also said to give life and soul to the new house. As the shaman blows smoke from burning incense into the maloca, he literally breathes life into its body. He also blows spells to guarantee strength and durability, and to protect the house from wind, rain, and lightning as well as attacks from evil spirits. In his chants the shaman invokes the 45 primordial underwater maloca of the clan ancestor that, according to the Makuna, is eternal and alivethe living body of the Water Anaconda. After some ten to fifteen years and various replacements of the roof, the maloca is usually worn out and abandoned. If its headman dies, or if unusually many people of the house become sick or die, it may be abandoned much earlier; the house is then said to be filled with sorrow and considered inauspicious. A new house site is chosen, usually not far from the old one.
***
The interior space of the maloca is divided by invisible frontiers and organized by tacit cultural rules. The front and central part of the house forms the focus of public, ritual life, political affairs and the entertainment of guests. The rear and sides are the domains of women and domestic life. These divisions are most marked during rituals when women are confined to the rear or the family compartments along the sides, while the men gather at the front

and centre to chew coca, smoke and chant. At the most important rituals, such as the male initiation ceremony when the sacred Yuruapari flutes are played, women and children either stay away, or hide behind a screen at the back of the house.
The rear of the house is domestic space and family area. Here women process the manioc and prepare the meals, and along the side walls, extending from the back wall to the centre of the house, are the various family compartments where people sleep and sometimes take private meals. On the back wall hang woven manioc presses in which manioc mash is squeezed, and next to the womens door stands a large, communal ceramic griddle on which manioc bread is baked. Tripods for washing manioc pulp, and big, blackened pots for boiling the manioc juice also have their place there. Outside each family compartment, usually separated from the central hall by a woven palm leaf wall, stands a wicker stand carrying the familys tray of manioc bread and pepper pot. Inside, hammocks are slung round the hearth. From the roof above the fire hangs a rack on which meat and fish are smoked, and dried peppers stored in baskets and bark cloth bags. Leaning against the wall and stuck in the thatch are blowpipes, bows, arrows, shotguns, canoe paddles, fishing rods, traps and other tools. Ripening plantains hang from the beams, clothes and blankets dangle from stretched vines, while other personal articles such as knives, beads, torches, batteries, mirrors, and combs are stored away in baskets or wooden chests.
The centre of the maloca is sacred space. The area around the four central posts is known as the dance path, basa ma, where rituals are performed. Clustered around one of the central house poststhe one of the left seen from the mens doorare wicker stands containing gourds of shamanic substancescoca, snuff, bees wax, and red paintand the equipment for coca preparation. On the ground stands a canoe-like trough where chicha is fermented and stored during rituals. From a beam hangs a finely woven palm leaf chest containing the ceremonial head-dresses, eagle feathers, ancient ci-

gars, snuff and other sacred goods associated with ritual and shamanism. More rattles, feathers, and musical instrumentspanpipes, reed flutes, and deer bone fluteshang from branched sticks lashed to the front house posts. Nowadays colourful calendars are often nailed to one of the posts.
The sacred centre is also the burial place of important menheadmen and shamans. Other men, women, and children are buried close to the compartments they occupied, thus turning the maloca into a dwelling for both living and dead, men and spirits.
***
The size of the longhouse reflects the prestige of its headman and the strength of his following. There are accounts of immense longhouses in the past holding up to 150 individuals representing an entire lineage or local clan group. Today the group inhabiting a longhouse is relatively smallon the average fifteen to twenty closely related people: a father and his married sons or a set of married brothers, their wives and children. The longhouse of Ignacio, where 46 I stayed when I first came to Komenya, is rather typical. Ignacio, then in his forties, had two wives occupying distinct compartments in the rear of his house. He stayed with one, but provided impartially for both and his eight surviving children. The young widow of Ignacios late father lived with her small children in the house of one of his brothers, but often came to visit and stayed for long periods in his maloca.
Two of Ignacios half brothers, born of different mothers, lived in his maloca. One was married with a small child, the other was a bachelor. A total of fifteen persons, divided between three households, lived in Ignacios maloca on a permanent basis. Often, however, the house contained many more people, since close and distant relativeskin and affinesperiodically came to stay with Ignacio.
Judging from the early accounts on the Vaupés Indians, their appearance dress and adornmenthas changed considerably over the last century. In the

past adult men wore long hair in a bound braid down their backs. They had
small ear plugs - some still seen todayand possibly also a lip plug. A quota-
tion from Alfred Wallace, the naturalists, describing his arrival at a longhouse
on the Vaupés river in the mid 19th century, provides an idea of how the
Makuna could have looked before the arrival of the Whites:
On entering this house, I was delighted to find myself at length in the presence of the true denizens of the forest... The women were absolutely naked; but on the entrance of the brancos they slipped on a petticoat, with which in these lower parts of the river they are generally provided but never use except on such occasions. Their hair was but moderately long, and they were without any ornament but strongly knitted garters, tightly laced immediately below the knee. It was the men, however, who presented the most novel appearance... Their hair was carefully parted in the middle, combed behind the ears, and tied behind in a long tail reaching a yard down the back. The hair of this cord was firmly bound with a long cord formed of monkeys hair, very soft and pliable. On the top of the head was stuck a comb, ingeniously constructed of palm-wood and grass, and ornamented with little tufts of toucans rump feathers at each end; and the ears were pierced, and a small piece of straw stuck in the hole; altogether giving a most feminine appearance to the face, increased by the total absence of beard or whiskers, and by the hair of the eyebrows being almost entirely plucked out. A small strip of tururi (the inner bark of a tree) passed between the legs, and secured to a string round the waist, with a pair of knitted garters, constituted their simple dress.
In the early 1970s, when I first came to Komenya, Makuna men were still
dressed much as in Wallaces account except that the bark-cloth tururi was
now replaced by a piece of loin cloth. Women, on their part, wore cotton
skirts, leaving the upper part of the body bare. The mens pigtail had, how-
ever, disappeared and they wore their hair short, while women carried it long
and loose, occasionally held with a bright-coloured plastic comb. Now only
very old men are occasionally seen in loin cloth. Shorts and shirts among
men and cotton dresses among women have become the fashion of the day.
Both men and women take pleasure in adorning themselves with brightly-

coloured bead collars and painting their faces with red vegetable dye (gunanyi).

Face painting is to the Makuna a creative artistic activity. Patterns and de-

signs seem to be freely invented, and individuals change their designs daily.

Sometimes women accentuate their hair and jaw lines with a black dye (we)

obtained from another plant. But the red face paint is also considered magi-

cally protective. When men go to hunt in the forest and women to work in

the gardens they carefully paint themselves. At particularly critical occasions,

during sacred rituals, and when people set off on long journeys, or carry out

difficult and dangerous work, a special blessed red paint, often kept in the

house for generations, is applied. During dances hands, feet, and knees are

also stained with the black dye, and basket weave patterns are traced on the

legs and arms which are said to identify the ritual participants with spirits

from the he world. The dye remains for weeks on the skin, leavingas it

werea visible trace and bodily imprint of the ritual experience, which only

gradually wears off as the individuals resume ordinary human status.

47

The Daily Round
The maloca stirs before sunrise, when the air is still chilly and dusky. Women rise first, kindle the fires before going to the stream to bathe and fetch water. The headman signals the beginning of the new day by opening the front door. As the bleak light of dawn penetrates the house, one after another the men and young boys also get up to take their morning bath in the still cold river, believed to make their bodies hard and strong. Screams and laughter are soon heard from the canoe landing, and a drumlike beat resounds through the forest as the boys playfully strike the surface of the water with their handsa peculiar habit common to all Indians in the area.
When the fire in the big oven blazes, and the griddle is heated in the house, men and children gather around it to warm and dry themselves. The

smell of newly baked bread soon fills the house, and pots of fish, meat, and vegetables boil over the family hearths. The women bring basket trays of manioc bread and pots of food and pepper sauce to the centre of the house, and the headman calls the people to the communal breakfast. Men eat first, then the women and children. Squatting in close circle around the food laid out on fresh banana leaves on the ground, they dip the bread in the pepper pots and grab pieces of meat and fish with their hands, smacking with gusto and peacefully chatting as they eat. When the meal is finished, the women collect the trays and pots and put them away in their different compartments. The men wash their hands and rinse their mouths in water and take the obligatory pinch of coca, without which no meal is complete.
As the morning wears on, men and women go off on their different pursuits. While most men go hunting and fishing, a few usually stay in the house during the day, to rest, weave a basket or repair some tool or weapon. Women and children leave for the gardens, and as the sun begins to burn the sandy plaza, the whole settlement is for a few hours strangely silent and deserted.
At noon the women begin to return, soaked in sweat and loaded with manioc tubers and garden fruits. They again bathe in the stream and, still half immersed in the cool water, wash and peal the tubers. In the house they prepare a small meal for themselves and the children, and perhaps take a short rest before they begin to process the manioca lengthy and arduous work which takes the rest of the day. The tubers are grated, sieved, and squeezed into a dry mash, which is separated from the juice and baked into bread. The juice is boiled into a tasty drink which, in turn, is cooled and served at dusk.
In the afternoon, when the men arrive, the house revives and fills with excited chatter. The successful hunters hand over game and fish to their women who clean, slice and cook them for the afternoon meal. While the pots of meat and fish boil over the fires, the men laugh and joke as they report on the days events to each others and the attentive women and children. When the

food is ready, the residents gather for a late afternoon or early evening meal that marks the end of the day; the rest of the evening is reserved for the spirit foods of mencoca, snuff, and puffs on sweet-smelling cigars. The two main meals of the dayin the morning and afternoonthus structure time by separating day from night, and each in itself carries a message about the structure of society; to be complete, the meal must contain the manioc bread provided by women and the fish and meat procured by men, thus expressing their complementary roles in subsistence.
As the light fades, the men leave to pick coca leaves in the nearby gardens. Their work in preparing the coca in many respects corresponds to the womens processing of manioc during the day; again the gender tasks are complementary and symbolically significant. The fresh coca leaves are toasted until dry and brittle, then pulverized in a mortar and mixed with the ash from the leaves of the tree grape. The powdered mixture is then pounded in a long, hollow balsa cylinder. The green, dustlike powder when ready is tipped out 48 in a gourd and shared among the men. For the men, this moment marks the culmination of the day, while for the women the day is already over. They serve the hot manioc juice and then retire to the sleeping quarters.
The men gather round the bowl of freshly prepared coca. Seated on stools in the dark maloca, barely lit by the burning torch in the centre, the men now pass the coca around, occasionally puffing on freshly rolled cigars and inhaling the potent snuff. The headman sits facing the other men, with the bowl of coca at his feet. The ceaseless sharing of coca, cigars, and snuff among the men, their low-key talk and long moments of silence, give their gathering a solemn character. Evening is a time for reflection, for blessing, curing, and the exchange of knowledge among men. After a long days physical work, when the men have been separated in various individual pursuits, the evening gathering unites them and enhances their sense of community. In the sacred centre of the maloca the spiritual traditions of the community are forged, shared, and passed on to the younger generations. A day without the mens

gathering is incomplete, like a meal without coca, a body without soul. The deep calm, the reflexive contemplation, the mythical discourse, and the shamanic activities performed for the good of the community radiate a profound spirituality, which contrasts with the hectic work and merry atmosphere in the maloca during the afternoon. After a few hours, when women and children are long since asleep, the headman dissolves the gathering:  The night has come, he says, we have eaten and smoked together, it is time to rest... The headman extinguishes the torch-light, closes the doors of the longhouse, and the men retire to their hammocks.
Riches of the House
The goods of the houseand the house itselfare the tangible objects of Makuna art. Every piece of pottery and basketwork, every tool, weapon, and ritual ornament condenses in its form utility, aesthetics, and meaning. Makuna artifacts, usually simple in design and serving the most practical of purposes, are also vehicles of symbolic expression. They are, as it were, gateways into Makuna culture.
The basketry of men and the pottery of women are the two fundamental indigenous crafts. Like hunting and gardening, they epitomize the symbolic division of labour between the sexes. Woven baskets, trays, sieves, and manioc presses are all used by women in gardening and household work. Manioc tubers are carried in baskets from garden to house, the grated mash is pressed through the sieve and later squeezed through the manioc press. The bread is baked on a large clay griddle and then served on a tray. Pots are used for cooking fish and meat, manioc juice and pepper sauce. Other clay vessels are used by men for storing arrow poison, toasting coca leaves, and serving yagé in ritual contexts. Except for the big and carefully moulded yagé pot, ornated with geometrical designs in pale yellow mud-colour, the vessels are all simple

and functional in form and covered with a black, undecorated glaze. The sexual division of crafts is grounded in Makuna cosmology. Pottery is
associated with agriculture, baking, and cooking which are all female tasks involving the creative use and transformative power of fire. The moist clay is transformed into dry pots, the swidden turns into a bountiful garden, manioc is baked into bread, and raw fish and meat become food. According to Makuna metaphysics, pottery, agriculture, and cooking are all distinct expressions of the supreme female capacity of procreation, metaphorically described as the fire or heat of women. Basketry, in contrast, is associated with the forest and the activities of men. Men hunt in the forest, they cut trees for canoes and house construction, and they collect fruits for ritual consumption and canes for baskets. In Makuna thought the living trees of the forestlike game animals and fishare people, and cutting a form of killing. To the Makuna, then, basketry is a symbolic form of hunting.
Makuna hunting symbolism, as seen in the previous chapter, is rich and 49 complex. As ritualized warfare, hunting creates life by killing, thus releasing the souls of animals and transforming them into human beings. Alternatively, conceived as metaphorical marriage, hunting is an act of seduction and intercourse with the other. Either way there is an obvious creative aspect of hunting, which through a chain of symbolic associations between killing, cutting, and weaving sheds light on the creative role of baskets in Makuna mythology. When the male, mythical heroes had finished making the primordial artifactsincluding baskets and all the sacred ritual goods they collected the leftover wooden splinters and chips in four basketsone in each gateway of the earth. From these baskets, containing the waste of the primordial ritual goods, game animals, fish, and insects were born. The myth thus establishes a connection between baskets, animals, and the creative powers of the male ancestral heroes. Men, as opposed to women, create culturallyby means of their knowledge and skilled crafts. Basketrylike huntingis a male way of procreation.

Makuna say that men make baskets in exchange for the manioc bread prepared by women. During the male initiation ritual the boys are taught the craft of basketry by elder men. Towards the end of the initiates seclusion period they are expected to manufacture baskets, sieves, and trays which are then given to the women who have ritually painted the boys during the ritual a kind of payment. This exchange, which creates a ritual bond between a boy and girl, is often a prelude to marriage. Baskets are also customarily given to prospective mothers-in-law, and the art of basketry is seen as a pre-requisite for male adult status. Again there is a chain of close symbolic associations between basketry, sexuality, and marriage. Baskets were formerly exchanged between intermarrying groups, just as fish, meat, and forest fruits still are today in the dabucurí rituals.
Though basketry is a male activity, the baskets themselvesjust as the round clay potshave strong female connotations. The manioc basket (jibu) symbolically stands for the woman who uses it in her agricultural work, and the exchange of baskets between intermarrying groups of men appears as a metaphorical substitute for the exchange of women. The symbolic identity between baskets, pots, and women in Makuna thought can be traced to their common metaphysical function as vessels of life: the primordial baskets, as mentioned, contained the animals born from the waste of the primordial artifacts; womens agricultural baskets contain their plant childrenthe manioc tubers; and cooking pots contain the fish and meat which become life-sustaining food. Thus, pots and baskets can be seen as man-made replicas of the ultimate symbol of femaleness and procreative power: the hot, blood-filled womb which transforms male semen into children.
The neighbouring Barasana explicitly compare the pepper pot to a womb full of blood. Similarly, I believe that the Makuna symbolically identify the poison pot with the womb of the Ancestral Mother, Romikumu, and the poison it contains with her menstrual blood since in myth the ancestral poison vine is said to have grown from the spot where she shed her menstrual

blood. The manufacture of the large manioc griddle (gataro), burned and blessed
in the centre of the maloca, is the supreme expression of female craftsmanship and the only work of pottery demanding the spiritual supervision by a shaman. In myth the earth is a huge griddle, supported by pot stands of clay. The griddle-earth is also the body of the Ancestral Mother herself, which by means of the transformative power of firethe procreative fire contained in every womans bodycreates the white, dry manioc cakethe Makuna bread of life.
An equally rich texture of meaning attaches to the woven manioc press. Its Makuna name, hinobu, or basket anaconda, not only alludes to its serpent-like forman elongated tube, opened in one end, closed in the other but also to its function: it swallows the wet manioc mash and regurgitates the dry fibre pulp. This process is compared to the eating habits of the anaconda and alsoamong the Barasanato the male initiation ceremony: 50 the symbolic death and rebirth of the initiate. In a Letuama myth the manioc press is explicitly identified with the ancestral anaconda vomiting up the first people on land. The passage of the manioc mash through the press thus symbolically evokes the mythical origin of people as well as the social rebirth of adolescent men into adulthood.
The stool, the wicker stand, and the gourds of coca and snuff, grouped round one of the house posts in the centre, form part of the sacred riches of the house. The stool, kumuroliterally meaning the shaman thingis the insignia of male spirituality. Elevating its occupant from the ground, the finely carved and painted stool also differentiates the sexes, since women sit directly on the ground, or on woven mats, or rough-cut, low seats. Every stool is blessed by a shaman, thus enhancing the spiritual powers of its owner when, during evenings, he sits invoking ancestral spirits, blessing food, and blowing curative spells. The stool also figures prominently in Makuna myths. After giving birth to the anaconda children at the Water Doorway in the

east, Woman Shaman placed her children on rows of stools to dry. As they grew up, the ancestral anacondas travelled up the rivers of the earth and, in their turn, engendered the first people. In shamanic imagery the rows of stools, the ancestral anacondas, and the rivers of the earth are identical. The painted pattern on the mens stools is said to depict the journey of the ancestral anacondas. In fact, the stool design replicates the weave pattern of the manioc pressthe basket anacondaand the painted designs on the legs of ritual dancers. Stools, baskets, and dancers thus all symbolically represent the creative powers of the ancestral anaconda. During rituals, when men alternately dance and sit chanting on their stools, they become one with the ancestors. The stoolthe shaman thingtransports them, like the anacondas it embodies, into the time and space of myth, the spiritual reality of the he world.
The hourglass-shaped wicker stand, saniro, made of palm splinters, supports the gourds of blessed coca, snuff, and beeswax. These gourds, called tuga kwa, are sometimes decorated with carved designs similar to those painted on the yagé pot. The Makuna say that the wicker stand holds up the sky and sustains life. The mountains around the edge of the earth are described in shamanic language as stools or house posts holding up the roof of the cosmic maloca, but at the centre of the world stands a huge wicker stand supporting the various levels of the sky world. In this shamanic imagery the wicker stand, stools, and gourds at the centre, and the clay griddle at the rear of the house, become synonymous to the multi-layered world itself. The griddle is the earth, and the gourds of coca, snuff, and beeswax the various sky levels sustained by the cosmic wicker stand and the mountains-stools around it.
The ritual goods are thus packed with symbolic significance. The cosmic wicker stand is also the gateway into the sky world through which shamans pass between the various levels of the universe during their chanting. The gourds symbolically represent the skulls of the ancestors, and the coca, snuff, and bees wax they contain are identified with different substances of the

ancestors bodies. But these substances are also collectively referred to as spirit foods, offered to the spirits in all ritual contexts. As such, coca and snuff are opposed to the ordinary manioc bread which has obvious female connotations. Coca and manioc bread are to one another as soul to body, and just as men and women, they are opposed, but equally important and united in life. These ideas, then, add another level of meaning to the wicker stand, since not only does it support the gourds of coca and snuff at the centre of the maloca, but also hold the tray of manioc bread outside each family compartment at the rear and sides. Symbolically uniting soul and body, the wicker stand is a profound life-sustaining symbol. Like so many other Makuna artifacts, it is gracefully simple in form but exceedingly rich in meaning.
Sacred Space
The Makuna term for maloca, wi, means more than simply house. It also 51 has the connotations of skin, as in wiro, the coat of an animal or the skin of a human being; a sacred ritual, as in he withe ritual of the ancient Yuruparí flutes; and birth place, a point of origin, procreation, and propagation, as in bucua wia place where animals are believed to breed and multiply and masa yuhiri withe mythical birth place of the clan. A maloca, then, is the protective skin of the clan, a sacred state of being, a space of procreation and rebirth, and a cross-road between this world and the he world...
Every Makuna maloca is constructed according to the plan of the primordial maloca of the clan ancestor. The house in this world thus has its counterpart in the spirit realm, where the life of the clan and all its spiritual knowledge and tangible possessions originated. In Water Anacondas underwater maloca, his descendants were taught the sacred dances and received the cultivated food plants and ritual goods of the clancoca, tobacco, yagé, and the dance regalia. Every post and beam of the original maloca is named after the

ancestral anacondas. The four central house posts in the Makuna maloca are thus identified with Yiba Hino, Kome Hino, Wai Hino, and Ide Hino himselfthe ancestors of the Land People, Ant People, Fish People, and Water Peopleall closely related by mythical ties of kinship and marriage.
In ritual the maloca turns into temple, and in the sacred dance regalia Makuna craftsmanship achieves its highest artistic expression and most profound symbolic value. The fully adorned dancer wears seed rattles tied to his right ankle, a belt of jaguar or peccary teeth round the waist with a painted, white bark cloth apron hanging in front, and sprigs of aromatic leaves tucked in over the buttocks. On the right elbow is a monkey-fur bracelet with feathers, snail shells, and metallic coloured beetle wing-cases as jingling pendants. Some men have a heavy cylinder of white quartz hanging from a necklace of black seeds round the neck with another necklace of jaguar teeth and silver metal triangles on top.
The most important part of the ritual regalia is the bright feather headdress called macaw feathers, maha hoa, from the crown of deep yellow feathers of this bird worn over the forehead. A band round the head supports a banana leaf stalk at the back, a substitute for the old pigtail of hair bound with monkey-fur string, embellished by a plume of white egret feathers on a woven frame, a red macaw tail with white streamers and a stick of down with a green feather topping. Onto the stalk is bound a hollow jaguar or eagle leg-bone and from this hang hanks of monkey-fur string, white egret wings or fish shaped objects with a mosaic of brilliant blue and purple cotinga feathers. In the past shields of woven vine and ceremonial adzes were carried and elaborate combs worn in the hair. Through his ornamentsderived from the most beautiful and conspicuous of natures treasuresthe dancer transcends the ordinary human existence and becomes one with the primordial forces of nature and cosmos.
Ritual dances are held regularly throughout the year, to celebrate the change of season or the initiation of young boys, the ripening of fruits and the mi-

gration of fish, the inauguration of a maloca, or for no other reason than that a shaman or headman consider the time appropriate for a particular dance ritual. Each ritual has its own particular setusually a pairof dances, songs, and accompanying musical instruments: decorated gourd rattles, hollow tubes of bamboo or painted balsa wood which are thumped rhythmically on the ground, and a whole series of different kinds of flutes. In total, the Makuna possess some fifteen distinct dance-songs, sung in an archaic language understood fully only by the lead dancers, shamans, and knowledgeable old men.
The ritual is announced with blasts on clay trumpets which carry across the forest. It is said that, in the past, huge painted wooden slit-gongs beaten with rubber headed sticks were used to call the guests. As they arrive at the dance house the guests are greeted and served with large gourds of chicha. The men enter through the front door, chanting loud greetings, and then sit down to share coca and exchange news with their hosts. Women and children furtively walk in through the back door. The actual dancing usually begins in 52 late afternoon when the men, dressed in their ritual regalia and painted with black and red designs on face and body, move along the hall and around the dance path. As the dancing continues through the night the women join in the dance, tucking their heads under the shoulders of the men. At interludes, the men sit down on stools in a circle in the centre, smoking, taking coca, and chanting. Yagé is prepared outside the front door: vines are pounded in a mortar and the macerated bark is mixed with water, sieved and the bitter brown liquid put in the decorated yagé pot. The yagé is then served to the dancing men and ritual officiants in little gourd cups. As the drug begins to take effect the men play on cane flutes and whistles. It is said that their sound is that of yagé birds, spirits of the drug, which bring brightly coloured visions to the men.
As the main performers pause to chant, young men and women dance to the joyful tune of pan-pipes, weaving in and out between the house posts. Children run around playfully imitating the adults, while women sit talking

and laughing in the back of the house. As midnight approaches, the head chanter picks up the rattle-lancea long staff, decorated with feather mosaic and with small pebbles inserted in a swelling at the endand strides to the rear of the maloca and back to the centre. Holding the lance in the right hand, he hits it with the left to produce a sustained rattle as the lance vibrates along its length. The dance continues till the morning, when it is called off and the weary dancers sit down on their stools to rest. The shaman collects the feather head-dresses and other ritual regalia, and blows spells over the head and bodies of the dancers to ward off the dangers coming from having worn the sacred macaw feathers. The men then go down to the river to bath and wash away the face paint. To purify their bodies, the dancers also drink water mixed with particular leaves till they vomit. Returning to the maloca they sling their hummocks and go to sleep.
Every ritual dramatizes and recreates events in the ancestral world. The participants are transportedthrough the dance and the songs, the ritual foods they consume, and the sacred ornaments they wearto the time and space of myth, and when they put on the sacred feather head-dress and paint themselves in red and black, they become spirits. The men dress in feathers, down and plumes, jaguar bones and teeth, the fur of sloth and monkey, because in mythical times men were not differentiated from animals. In the he world men are animals and animals are people. The archaic language of the songs is the voice of the ancestors, and the ritual foods are the foods of the spirits. The line of fully ornamented dancers represents the ancestral people, and the dance itself enacts their creative journey from the Water Doorway in the east to the centre of the world, where they gave birth to the present generations of people.
The sacred substances and ritual paraphernalia handled during the ritual are all bodily parts and substances of the he people. The beeswax is their liver and tongue, the snuff their brain, and the big, ceremonial cigar, their penis. The metal ear ornaments that hang from the ears of the dancers are their

eyes, and the crown of yellow macaw feathers worn by the dancers represents the Primal Sun, identified with the seniormost of the mythical heroes, who together with the Ancestral Mother created the world and its original inhabitants. During dance rituals, when the sacred ornaments and substances are assembled, the ancestral beings thus come alive and make their presence powerfully felt in the maloca.
Through the work of the shaman and the chanter, myth becomes real and the ancestral order is recreated in the present. By blessing and blowing shamanic spells over the ritual substances, the shaman turns the dancers into spirits and protects the participants from the danger of being in contact with the potent he world. The ritual imparts new life to society and its members, and ensures that the human world is attuned to the wider order of the universe.

A Cosmos Writ Small

53

During rituals, the house becomes one with the cosmos. The roof is the sky, the house posts are the mountains that support it, and the floor is the earth. The ridge-pole under the roof is the path of the sun and the river of the sky. Along the middle of the house flows an imaginary river representing the Milk River of the earth, and below the earthen floor, where the dead are buried, is the underground river of death and sorrow, bohori riaca, where the human corpses float down to its mouth in the Door of Suffering in the west. At the Water Doorway in the east, contextually identified with either the mens or the womens door in the maloca, the Milk River flows out of this world and into the upper and lower layers of cosmos. The three imaginary river systems are thus all connected in the maloca-cosmos, forming a great circuit of celestial, terrestrial, and chthonic waters embracing the entire world.

Stephen Hugh-Jones has summarized the symbolic connotations of the Barasana longhouse thus: Symbol of cosmic space and of human society, the maloca also represents a human body. As a man, its painted front is a painted face with the door for a mouth, ridge-pole for backbone, lateral beams for ribs and central river for gut. As a woman, with head to the rear, the mens door is her vagina and interior a womb that shelters and nourishes the people inside. Thus the body physical, the body social and the universe, micro-space and macro-space, are all united in one potent symbol.
***
The spatial symbolism of the roundhouse is a variant of the same theme, perhaps even clearer expressing the symbolic identity between house and cosmos. In a series of remarkable articles Martin von Hildebrand and Elizabeth Reichel have described the cosmic symbolism of the Tanimuka (Ufaina) roundhouse in great detail. Since the Tanimuka are closely related neighbours of the Makuna and their architecture all but identical, their account also sheds light on the meaning of the Makuna roundhouse. As in the longhouse, the posts and beams reflect the multilayered architecture of the universe. The roundhouse resembles a great cone of thatched roof, erected over four pillars enclosing the central square and an outer circle of twelve posts. The maloca is oriented in east-west direction so that four pairs of posts in this outer circle form a cross pointing at the cardinal directions, each pair corresponding to the four gateways of the world. The horizontal and vertical spaces in the maloca are all named and attributed with cosmological significance. The Tanimuka describe the ground in the centre as the navel of the world and the four central posts as the ancestral anacondas holding up the sky. The outer circle of twelve posts, called the Shamans Path, represent the hills at the edge of the world. When the shaman blows protective spells his soul travel along this path, encircling the world and protecting its inhabitants from the evil forces of the outside.

The four central pillars are connected at the top by four horizontal beams, jointly referred to as the Sky Anaconda. The twelve outer posts are also joined by various curved rafters, lashed together to form a big circle on which the roof tilts rest. Between this circle and the four beams forming the Sky Anaconda is another supportive circle of enlashed rafters, called the Sun Rafter. Each of the horizontal spaces formed by these beams and rafters corresponds to a cosmic layer. The layer formed by the Sky Anaconda is the upper-most level of the cosmos, the abode of the Thunder Spirits. The space between the Sky Anaconda and the Sun Rafter is called the Path of the Sun. The lower layer corresponding to the Sun Rafter itself is the House of Music, the origin of songs and dances and the abode of the spirits of deceased dancers and chanters who descend to possess the living during rituals. The layer formed by the wide, circular hoop of enlashed rafters which connects the twelve outer posts is the home of the spirits of the dead, and the space between this layer and the Sun Rafter above is referred to as the Path of the Stars. Finally, 54 the horizontal space below the intersection of roof and wall at the perimeter of the maloca is called the House of Vultures. Significantly, the Tanimuka bury their dead in the ground just inside the wall below the House of Vultures, where the thatched roof rots most quickly.
A peculiar feature of the roundhouse is its two openings or windows in the roof through which sunlight enters. According to Reichel and von Hildebrand, this architectural feature turns the Tanimauka roundhouse into a solar calendar and clock, indicating both the season of the year and the time of the day. The two windows, just under the roof crest, face east and west. As the sun moves over the sky during the day, its raysentering through the two windowsdescribe a regular trajectory across the wall and the floor inside the maloca, which allow the inhabitants to judge the time of the day. In the morning the light is projected onto the western part of the interior; at noon the house lies in shadow, and in the afternoon the sunrays light up the eastern wall. The seasonal changes in position of the sun in the sky have a

similar effect. The sunrays entering the house through the windows in the roof describe a pendular movement on the floor, lighting different parts of the house according to season. Only the sacred centre of the house lies constantly in shadow.
***
The house, then, is a cosmos writ small. Conversely, the universe is conceived as a cosmic house, with doors, posts, beams, roof and walls. By conflating house and cosmos, and thus transposing cosmic structures and processes onto the house and its inhabitants, the Makuna seek to bring time and space under their control. During ritual the participants become the immortal actors of the cosmic drama. Identified with the powerful he spirits they have the capacity to transformcreate and recreatethe world. By means of spatial and temporal metaphors, the ritual manipulates the ultimate forces of the universe. Thus, the cosmic space and mythical universe of the maloca sets the stage for one of the most important, but also least known, of the Makuna ritualsthe dramatic Dance of the Spirits.

CHAPTER FIVE
The Dance of the Spirits

IT IS LATE afternoon in mid-March, when fish migrate and edible

55

frogs abound in the forest, heralding the beginning of the long winter rains.

This is the harvest season of the peach palm, one of the principal cultivated

food palms in the Northwest Amazon. Planted and harvested by men, the

towering palms enclose every Indian settlement and reveal the presence of

abandoned gardens and old house sites. In the spare light of Ignacios maloca

people are hectically preparing for the great harvest festival. At the back of

the house a group of women work at a tripod, preparing drink for the feast

by squeezing the mash of grated peach palm fruits through a woven sieve

into a huge clay pot. Nearby other women bake piles of manioc bread on the

griddle. They laugh and chat as they work, while small children dart around

them, playing among the pots and piles of food and firewood.

At the front of the crowded maloca, now repaired and decorated with

fresh wall-paintings for the feast, a group of men sit chanting, incessantly

passing around cigars and bowls of coca. As a young boy runs between the back and front of the house, serving peach palm drink to the men, Ignacio and his adult sons ceremoniously greet the arriving guests. Along the sides other guests have already settled in with their pots and baskets full of food and drink. A multitude of hammocks fill the sleeping corridors of the maloca. A noisy group of youngstersdressed in finest clothes, and with their faces elaborately paintedplay pan-pipes, deer bone flutes, and shell whistles near the mens door. After the greeting ceremony, Ignacio, who is also officiating shaman, withdraws behind a screen at the rear to blow silent spells over coca and snuff. As darkness approaches, the maloca presents that paradoxical mixture of solemnity and triviality, order and disorder, tension and laxity, which characterizes all Makuna rituals.
Suddenly there is a stir. Chatter and howling are heard in the distance, first faintly, then louder. Children curiously peep through the door, but are cautioned by the adults: Come back, children, dont look out. The spirits are coming. If you see them, you may become blind. A line of masked dancers eventually appears, and one after another enter through the front door, beating the post with branches. They howl and swagger towards the centre of the maloca, imitating a flock of capuchin monkeys. With the arrival of the Monkey Spirits, who come to eat, drink, and dance in Ignacios maloca, the ritual has begun. Over the next few days an extraordinary drama will take place in the maloca as masked dancers, representing a multitude of spirits, engage in a moving and varied performance.
Dressed in reddish bark-cloth hoods in the shape of monkey heads, with protruding ears and charcoal designs for face, the masked dancers command the attention of the crowd. They wear a shirt of the same material with long sleeves, and a whitish skirt with a pitch black fringe. Hands and feet are dyed black, and each dancer has a seed rattle attached to the right ankle, producing a rhythmic sound as they move across the dance path.
As their performance continues, the spirit-dancers draw the on-looking

crowd into the playful drama, turning the entire maloca into a stage. Bundles of food hanging from the roof beams and house posts are torn down by some of the masked dancers, while others rush and retreat from the attentive and laughing crowd. When finally the Monkeys move towards the rear where the hosts placate them with peach palm drink, another pair of masked dancers, very different in appearance and demeanour, steal into the maloca. Each wears a large, black resin mask, painted with white and yellow stripes and forming a monstrous head with a ferocious grin and lifeless, staring eyes made of metallic bits from torch batteries. These are the Penis Spirits, or Tori. One of them is male, the otheroddly, it may seemfemale. Each holds a long stick with an attached rattle in one hand while the other grasps another staff with its tip darkened red and held between the legs in the manner of a huge penis.
They dance towards the amused onlookers with obscene movements. Children within reach are grabbed or pushed aside with mock brutality. The men 56 fend off the dancers attacks by striking the grotesque bodies and penises with sticks, while screaming women try to escape. After a while the Penis Spirits sit down in the centre of the maloca. The men of the host group approach, greet, and jokingly touch and scrutinize them. The spirits remain silent, stirring only to accept snuff and drink. Now the Monkeys join them to receive the drink and trays of manioc bread offered. Then the Penis Spirits leave, soon followed by the Monkeys, laden with food, drink, and blessed snuff.
Moments later several groups of Bee Spirits enter, dance, and leave, wearing black masks with a protruding nose, said to resemble the tube-shaped entrance to the bees nest. Each strikes the ground with a branch as they dance across the middle of the house in a long, single file to the rear where also they are received by the hosts. Their performance is followed by a pause when the dancers remove their masks to rest, eat, and drink outside the maloca. Inside, young men and women begin another dance to the mournful tune of

the peach palm flutes, jota seru, particularly made for the occasion from a pair of ordinary pan-pipes lashed together. In contrast to the swift movement of the usual pan-flute dance, the dancers now stride slowly and rhythmically, round and round, in a wide circle.
At dusk there is a dramatic change in mood as twenty or more masked dancers reappear in a long row of pairs, again beating the door post upon entry. Their black masked faces are distinctively adorned with white and yellow designs. Sculptured noses and eyebrows protrude from the garish faces. These are the spirits of the nocoroa small fish with coloured head living in streams and rivulets in the forestdancing in file with long striding steps along the hall dimly illuminated by two flaming torches. As the dance continues, they reassemble at the rear of the house with their backs towards the womens door and their heads facing the front entrance. The men of the host group greet the dancers, addressing them as grandfathers and asking them who they are, and from where they have come. The spirit dancers answer only by moving their hands and hooded heads as if speechless. Anyone who would address them by name and thus reveal their human identities would waste away and die.
After the greeting ceremony, the hosts offer drink, and blow snuff up the noses of the visiting spirits. Reinvigorated they begin a solemn, circular dance very different from the playful appearance of their predecessors. Their forceful but monotonous performance is accompanied by a melancholic song as they dance, leave, and re-enter several times. As the dancing becomes more intense, women join the men, together moving in the interlaced manner typical of most Makuna dances. Yet the tune of the Nocoro Dance is singular, unlike any other Makuna song. The atmosphere is deeply suggestivethe masked dancers move rhythmically through the dark of the longhouse; the red hooded heads with their black, painted faces glow in the moody torch-light, then fade into strangely figured silhouettes. The loud chorus of fifty or more men, the stamping of a hundred feet, and the sound of rattles and throbbing tube

drums all combine to give the impression, as night wears on, that the spiritdancers indeed are visitors from another world.
In this way, alternating between jestful, dramatic play and solemn, sacred dance, the spirits continue through the night and following day. In the interludes elders chew coca, smoke, and take snuff to keep away sleep, while the young pick up the paired pan-pipes and continue to dance. Neither the dancers, nor the spectators are supposed to sleep during the ritual to avoid being carried away by the spirits. Though believed to be auspicious if properly performed and carefully supervised, the dance of the spirits is also potentially harmful. Like all Makuna rituals, the peach palm festival is a precarious encounter with the ultimate forces of reality. It is performed to bring life and fertility, but may also cause death and misfortune.
***
The festival consists of two parts: the first, rumua saharethe Spirit Dance or, literally, the entry of the spirits, lasts for about twenty-four hours, from 57 late afternoon one day to nightfall on the following; the second, the Peach Palm Dance proper, jota basa, which is also the name of the entire festival, lasts for another nightfrom dusk to dawn on the third day. For the Makuna, the festival as a whole is a celebration of the peach palm harvest. Yet, as will be seen, the festival is more than a first-fruit ritual and food feast; fundamentally it is an engagement with the spirits of the dead. For the days and nights it lasts, time as we define it will be suspended, the past joined with the present, and death itself symbolically transcended.
The festival demands considerable preparation, starting months before the actual feasting. As the peach palms sprout and ripen, and the fruits are harvested and converted into a liquid mash, they are successively blessed by the officiating shaman. Closer to the agreed date of the ritual, masks and costumes are made, ample manioc bread baked, and large quantities of meat and fish procured for redistribution during the feast. As one of the great

events in the Makuna ritual calendar, the festival requires an extensive investment of physical labour, material resources, and shamanic skills.
The host group sends word about its intention to sponsor the ritual well in advance. In response to the copious amount of food and drink anticipated, the guests, on their part, provide masks and costumes, and lead the dancing during the ritual. This complementary division of tasks between hosts and guests is symbolically important and in itself part of the ritual. Ideally hosts and guests are supposed to correspond to intermarrying clans, and the ritual itself to strengthen the relationship among them. In actual practice, however, hosts and guests are not rigidly separated and jointly take part in most tasks before and during the event. The shaman, responsible for the mystical preparations and the supervision of the entire ritual, may belong to either group.
About two weeks before the festival the host group intensify hunting and fishing efforts to obtain meat and fish in abundance, a labour which again involves shamanic expertise. Since large amounts of fish and meat are needed, the shaman seeks permission from the guardians of the animals to hunt and fish beyond the everyday subsistence needs of the community. Lest the animal spirits take revenge, causing people to fall sick, the shaman offers them coca and tobacco. As the hunters return with their bag, meat and the fish are smoked and stored on racks over big fires. Other men gather the peach palm fruits, while women harvest the manioc, and boil and grate the palm fruits into a mash to be stored in the ground inside the dance house.
At this time the guests, on their part, begin to prepare the various masks and costumes for the spirit dance. One important type consists of a reddish bark cloth hood with a tuft of black bark strips tied to the end. A round or oval face of black tree resin, adorned with white and yellow circular or semicircular design, is glued to the hood. Nose and eyebrows, of carved bits of balsa wood, provide a characteristic profile. This class of masks typically represents various kinds of fish, including the Nocoro, but also other animals closely associated with them in Makuna myth, such as the Vulture. Together

they enact the solemn parts of the ritual. Despite the common basic pattern

there are also individual artistic flourishes and local stylistic variations. Thus,

it is difficult to identify a particular mask with a certain spirit character; only

the artist himself can do so with certainty. The identification is doubly diffi-

cult since each mask may represent a whole series of different spirits in the

course of a single ritual.

Another important mask type consists of a hollow balsa-wood tube, on

which a yellow face is painted. The facial features are brought out by a styl-

ized design in red and black. Oversized ears, also made of balsa wood and

painted in abstract designs, are inserted in holes on the sides of the tube. The

wooden mask is then fixed on a bark cloth hood drawn over the head. This

mask typifies the boreroa wader bird living on the shores of the Apaporis

riverwho appears at dawn after the first nights dancing. By changing the

forms of the ears, the mask is made to represent the spirits of other animals

who, like the Borero birds, all perform in pairs.

58

Several other kinds of masks are also made from the same basic materials

to represent a single or a few conspicuous characters including termites, ant-

eaters, jaguars and others. The mask of the jaguar spirit, like those of ter-

mites and anteaters, consists of a carefully sculptured balsa head, moulded

with black resin, and decorated with yellow and white spots, resembling the

colouring of the beast.

The preparation of masks and costumes, too, requires the close supervi-

sion of the shaman. Before the material can be collected, the shaman blows

over snuff to placate the spirit owners of the wasogu treeancestral anacon-

das believed to inhabit certain named sites along the Apaporis river. The men

inhale the blessed snuff before venturing into the forest. The same proce-

dure holds for the collection of the resin. When the material is blessed and

amassed, the men collectively prepare the masks in a secluded place, away

from women and children. After the resin has been heated up and moulded

into faces and heads, the masks are then addressed as Grandfathers, nyicu

masa. Henceforth the masks are carefully guarded until just before the ceremony when each dancer will add the final touch to his creation.
To prepare the cloth, a wasogu tree is felled, and the lower, branchless part of the trunk cut into suitable pieces. Each section is then beaten with a heavy stick until the crushed bark texture loosens and is removed from the trunk. The thick, cloth-like material is then washed in the river and dried in the sun before being finally cut and sewn into hoods and shirts. Lastly eye holes are burnt out with a piece of glowing charcoal. The skirts are prepared from the inner bark of another tree that has been torn in long, narrow strips and dried. The strips are then tied to a fibre string, wound into bundles, and taken to the forest to be dipped in a certain clay which yields the black fringe of the final product. With the masks and costumes on hand the ritual may begin.
***
The guests arrive on the appointed time, or a day earlier to settle in comfortably in the dance house. The dancers themselves make a camp in a clearing away from the maloca where they may temporarily withdraw to rest and eat with their families during the ritual. In the maloca the hosts are busy making the final preparations. Women bake piles of manioc bread and complete the peach palm drink while the men prepare sufficient amounts of coca and snuff to last them through the feast.
The host maloca and the dancers camp in the forest form the spatial coordinates of the ritual. The division in space reinforces the symbolic separation between the hosts and the guests, between the people inside and the spirits outside. The spirit-dancers move between the camp and the maloca, dancing in the house and on the plaza, and carrying food, drink and blessed snuff to their camp for redistribution among their women and children.
Apart from all kinds of animal spirits, the performers also impersonate a disparate collection of other odd spirit characters including the male and female Penises, Tree Fruits, Fishnets, and Bows-and-Arrows. All in all, more

than a hundred distinct characters may figure in the ritual as they arrive, eat,

drink, and dance. Though the masks are continuously changed to represent

different spirits, the basic costume remains constant throughout as the per-

formances alternate between sacred dance, basa, and playful acting, ahere.

This dramatic tension between the solemn and the ludic, essential to the

ritual as a whole, is underscored by the visual contrast between the stylized,

black face of the Fish Spirits and the more realistic, yellow face of the playful

Borero Spirits.

The details of the ritual may vary from one occasion to another, but the

general sequence remains the same. The Monkeys inaugurate the ritual, usu-

ally followed by the Penises, the Bees and the Nocoro fish. The Capuchin

Monkey (gake) is the head (uhu) of the forest animals, and as such also said

to be a jaguar. He comes to collect foods from the hostmeat, fish, and

peach palm drink. The Penis Spirit, on the other hand, whose task is to re-

ceive shamanized snuff, is actually said to be a fish.

59

After the mournful dance of the Nocoro at dusk, which lasts for an hour

or two, a more cheerful mood is again ushered in by the appearance of a pair

of Frog Catchers, who come to look for frogs. These creatures stalk the

ground and house posts of the maloca with burning torches in search of their

prey. The Coloured Toads follow in their footsteps, now and then jumping

on an imaginary frog and treading it on an equally imaginary string as men

do when they collect edible frogs.

A series of odd animal spirits, in pairs or small groups, now follow in

quick succession. Bats, Leeches, Piranha, Opossum, Peccary, Anteater, and

Termites all enter in apparent disorder. They dance, sometimes several at a

time, leave, and re-enter. Each dance has its characteristic movement and

song to imitate the animal impersonated. The Bats move with waving arms,

while the Leeches fall upon the on-looking crowd as if they were trying to

suck their blood. Some spectators shout mock insults at the spirits, while

others shy away to avoid capture. Various groups of Piranha move quickly

like shoals of fish. The Termites, with huge masked heads, enter slowly and silently through the back door. They are Food Thieves (bare rinire masa), coming to eat leftover food.
In the late evening the true Fish Spirits (wai rumua) enter as the sacred dance starts anew. Then there is again a sequence of dramatic play featuring Otters, Jaguars, the small and the big Sloth, Tree Ants, Anteater, and the Wasogu Beetle, whose larvae feed on the tree from which the bark cloth is made. The Otters persecute fish, swirling around and emitting a humming sound. Three growling Jaguars with big spotted heads run into the screaming crowd, aggressively attacking the central house posts. The Sloth, always solitary, walks exceedingly slowly around the house, with a penis-like stick between his legs. Women strike at it and he falls to the ground with a loud puff. A long line of Ants, followed by the Anteater, then enters. The Ants come to feast on the leftover food, while the Anteater prey on the ants. He is said to be the god-child (ngamo) of the Water Anaconda, and he has also come to offer ants to his god-father.
The mournful appearance of two Wasogu Beetles at midnight provides a high-point of the ritual. With huge sculptured heads, dominated by curved wooden noses, they dance at the centre of the house. Surrounded by the hosts, who illuminate the performance with torches in hand, the Beetles attack in turn the four central posts, beating them with sticks. The complex and graceful choreography of their dance, and their melodious and sad song hold the crowd in suspense.
Between midnight and dawn the Fish Spirits re-enter performing the Fishes Night Dance. More drawn-out and intense than their earlier appearance, the song and the dance retrace the migration routes of the fish from the mouth of the Apaporis river to its headwaters, entering and following all the major affluents up to their sources. Each important river segment has its own verse, tune, and movement. The dance repeats the original dispersal of the fish in the rivers, and recreates a moment in mythical time when they had

yet no distinct, incarnate form, but were still spirit beings, appearing both as fish and people. As dawn approaches the Fish leave and the Vultureswith the same masksenter. Their song and dance are similar to those of the Fish Spirits; the Vultures are said to follow the migration routes of the fish, feeding on their dead and rotting bodies.
Dawn is greeted by the Borero birds, who like the Anteater are god-children of Water Anaconda, and also Owners of the Fish. They dance in a pair, one leading the song, the other answering, and together they imitate birds playing on a beach. A whole series of bird spirits follows, wearing similar tube-like masks of balsa wood, but with differently designed ears. There are other animal spirits as well, some in distinct masks, offering a colourful and varied performance as the morning wears on.
Before noon it is time for a break and short rest. The shaman blesses an oversized cigar and offers it to the host who then leads the participants, dancers and spectators, in a long line, himself energetically puffing the cigar and blow- 60 ing the smoke in all directions, down to the river. He exhales the smoke over the water, thereby blessing the river and making it safe for bathing. The men then bathe and wash themselves before returning to the maloca to rest and eat.
At noon the dance starts anew with the reappearance of the Fish Spirits. An hour or so later there is another playful sequence as other spirits arrive to eat, drink, and dance. They include Butterfly, Agouti, Otter, Cayman, Fish Children, the Fishnet and the Bow-and-Arrow, the Armadillo, Spider, Forest Fruits, Tapir, and Wasps. The two Butterflies, wearing the cylindrical balsa masks and connected by a string, dance around and around like fluttering butterflies. The Spiders hold a strip of bark in their hands used to tie up some of the spectators, who thus become caught in their web. The Bow-and-Arrow Spirits try to kill fish as the spectators stick leaves on the arrows, representing the pierced fish, and the Tapirs dance in a wide circle with women, singing a deep humming tune.

In the late afternoon the Fish Spirits return for the last time. Their performance, the Fishes Day Dance, is a turning point in the ritual as the spirits now begin to return to their other-worldly abode. As the dancers, exhausted and intoxicated with snuff and coca, move in a circle, and up and down the dance hall, the Fish descend the rivers and streams to their down-stream homes and birth houses on the Apaporis river. They finally depart, dancing for a while in the plaza, and bidding farewell to their hosts. When the sun sets the Vultures also come to take their leave.
A short pause follows, then chaos overtakes the maloca. The disparate spirits from earlier now reappear to say good bye and get their lasts gulps of drink and portions of food. The Fish Servants (wai josa)the last-born of the fishappropriately come long after the other fish spirits have left. They are closely followed by the Otters, which chase them around. The Jaguar and the Deeranother predator-prey pairturn up, then the Ants and the Anteater, the Fish and the Fishnet; group after group and occasionally all at the same time. The spectators now join in the play and the entire maloca boils. When the Hawk enters, with long sticks representing its split tail, people know that the dance is about to end. The Hawk, chased around by men with blowguns, dances six times round the four central pillars. His appearance is followed by the Agouti joined by the rest of the spirits dancers in no apparent order. Except for the masks they wear, representing a mixture of all the spirits they have impersonated during the dance, they carry other masks in their hands or on sticks. Thus ends the Spirit Dance, with all participants with and without masks, men, women, and childrensimultaneously moving round the maloca, and out through the front door, into the open plaza where the performance finally comes to a halt.
It is again dark when the host burns sweet smelling beeswax inside and around the house to send away the dangers lingering after the spirits visit. The dancers remove their masks and costumes and return to their camp to rest. Blessed food is communally served in the maloca and while some eat,

others pick up the paired pan-pipes and begin to play. Soon men, women, and children are again on their feet, moving to the sorrowful melody.
After a few hours break the dance of the spirits is followed by the Peach Palm Dance proper, during which the men wear neither masks nor costumes or head-dresses. With a palm frond in one hand, rhythmically shaking a gourd rattle in the other, they dance till the morning, or until the peach palm drink is finished. This concluding part of the ritual also recounts the deeds of the spirit people; the major characters are the same as in the preceding part, but the songs and the movements are now different. With the Peach Palm Dance, the entire festival is complete. The perishable bark cloth masks and costumes are thrown away or burned, while the wooden masks are carefully stored away in the house till the next occasion.
The peach palm festival as a whole is part of an ideally fixed sequence of seasonal communal rites. The ceremony is succeeded by the he-fruit ritual when forest fruits are brought to the house to the tune of the Yuruparí flutes 61 (he rica samara) at the beginning of the wet season, usually in the months of April or May. This is followed by the ritual of the Ancient Yuruparís (he bucura) in June or July at the height of the wet season. According to knowledgeable shamans, this is the proper sequence of the three most important Makuna rituals. If the order is broken, or any of the rituals neglected, misfortune and disease will beset the community.
***
The peach palm festival is radically different from all other Makuna rituals. In no other do men wear masks or bark-cloth costumes. Also in contrast to other important Makuna rituals, men do not drink yagé, nor wear the sacred head-dresses of macaw feathers. The peach palm festival, they say, is an occasion of feasting and amusement. Hence they cannot drink yagé or don the head-dresses. Conversely, during rituals when men consume yagé and wear the complete ritual ornament, no ordinary food may be consumed, only chicha

and spirit foodcoca and snuff. On the whole, masked dances are rare among the Tukanoan groups in the
Vaupés region, and occur only on its northern and southern fringes, where the Tukanoans live in close contact with neighbouring Arawakan groups. The Cubeo to the north thus have masked dances in connection with their funerary rituals, and masked rituals similarly appear among the southern Tukanoan groupsthe Makuna, the Letuama, and the Tanimuka on the Apaporisand their Arawakan neighbours, the Yukuna and the Cabiyarí, in connection with the peach palm harvest. The names of certain key figures in the ritualfor example, the Toriare identical among these groups, suggesting a common archaic ritual language. In addition, masked dances occur among the Bora, Miranya, Huitoto, Andoke and Tikuna peoples further to the south, between the Caquetá, Putumayo and Amazon rivers. Significantly, the Arawakan neighbours of the Makuna, the Yukuna and Cabiyarí, do not use yagé at all. Thus, the characteristic ritual use of masks and the absence of yagé suggests Arawakan cultural origin.
Yet the Makuna consider the ritual an important part of their own cultural heritage. The mythical context of the ritual is genuinely Tukanoan; it forms part of the cycle of myths about the ancestral anacondas, andin the case of the Makunaabout the original alliance between Water Anaconda and Yiba. If the spirit dance thus has an Arawakan origin it is certainly historically integrated into Makuna culture. All the above groups closely interact and share a fundamentally similar cosmology and mythic corpus which facilitates mutual borrowing and the incorporation of new ritual elements and symbolic themes. In 1989, for example, a group of Makuna performed the peach palm festival among the Tuyuka, among whom it was previously unknown, with the express purpose to teach them the ritual.
The mutually exclusive presence of masks and yagé in Makuna rituals is significant and may, in part, explain the easy accommodation of Arawakan elements into Makuna culture. Thus the use of masks and the consumption

of yagé are, in important respects, symbolically and functionally equivalent: both are ritual means of turning people into spirits, and depending on context, one takes the place of the other. When men take yagé and put on the sacred head-dresses they turn into spirits, just as they become the spirits whose song they intone when dressed in painted masks and bark-cloth costumes. Yagé allows men to see the spirits; the masks actually and tangibly depict them. The masks, as it were, externalize and objectify the inner visions produced by the yagé. Therefore it may not be incidental that the colours of the yagé pot, in which the sacred yagé drink is served, are identical with those of the black, ornate resin masks worn during the spirit dance. Indeed, the geometrical designs on the yagé pot and the spirit masks are conspicuously similar.

Spirits of the Dead, Source of Life

62

What does this rich, colourful and dramatic ritual mean, and who are the mysterious spirits impersonated by the masked dancers? The ethnographic literature gives little guidance and the Makuna themselves give no simple answer. As with most rituals the deeper levels of significance are difficult to articulate in words; they must be intuitively experiencedthrough participation in the ritual itself and the culture as a whole. However, from what the Makuna say about the rite, and by placing it in context, it is nevertheless possible to provide a tentative interpretation.
After witnessing a Makuna peach palm festival in March 1989 I asked Ignacio, the officiating shaman, to explain the origin and purpose of the ritual. He responded, as usual, with a story:

The dance of the spirits is like a film, showing something that happened a long time ago, at another place, in another world. It is performed to remember important events in the ancestral past. Before human beings yet existed,

the peach palm was owned by the Fish People. It was first planted at the Water Doorway in the east. The Fish People went upriver, and at various points along the journey they stopped to dance and plant the primal peach palms. The first palms were planted at Boraitara, an island on the lower Apaporis and the birth house of the Fish People clans; then at Manaitara, the birth place of the Water People clans, below the mouth of the Pirá-Paraná river; at Wasoturia above the mouth of the Pirá-Paraná; and, the last palm, at Jasajudiro, the Jirijirimo falls on the upper Apaporis.
At each of these sites there is a great underwater maloca, around which groves of peach palm grow together with the other trees from which masks and costumes are made. The Fish People planted these trees. They also created the resin used for the masks, and the clay used for painting them. The owner of the maloca at Boraitara is Fish Anaconda, and at Manaitara, Water Anaconda, the ancestor of the Water People clans. Fish Anaconda was the original owner of the bark-cloth tree (wasogu). His descendants are today experts in preparing the white bark-cloth aprons used during certain other rituals, but never learnt to prepare the hoods and shirts from the red barkcloth. Instead the Water People received the knowledge to make masks and costumes for the spirit dance. They, in turn, taught the art to the Letuama, Tanimuka, and Yukuna. Together they are today the owners of the peach palm ritual.
As the ancestral Fish People travelled up the Apaporis river they stopped to dance in the four malocas at Boraitara, Manaitara, Wasoturia, and Jasajudiro. At each of these places they prepared the peach palm drink, made masks and costumes, and danced. All animals of the forest and the rivers came to the dance. The first dance was held at Boraitara, the next at Manaitara, then at Wasoturia, and finally at Jasajudiro. When the Fish People had danced at all four sites they again returned downriver to the Water Doorway.
This somewhat cryptic explanation, is apparently a fragmentary outline of
the mythical context of the ritual. The peach palm festival of today repeats
the dances of the ancestral Fish People at the four mentioned underwater
malocas. For the Water People clans the mythical dance at Manaitara is of
particular importance since it was given by their ancestor, Water Anaconda.
Yawira, the Plant Mother, daughter of Water Anaconda and wife of Yiba, was
the hostess and owner of the food and drink at this original feast. It is through
her and her marriage with Yiba, that the peach palm was later brought into

this world, and distributed among people. Owing to her, Makuna say, the peach palm is today cultivated throughout the region.
The dance shows what happened in myth, and in this sense is like a film. But there is obviously more implied. The ritual performance actually re-enacts the ancestral dance and physically involves the participants in the mythical drama it recreates. During the ritual the masked dancers become part of this drama and, indeed, identify with its actors. When men wear masks, and sing and dance, Ignacio said, it is the Fish People who sing and dance through them. The spirits of the Fish People enter their bodies. The dancers become the Fish People. The song of the fish spirits speaks about the ancestral journey of the Fish People, and each verse refers to a particular named site on this journeya waking-up-house of the Fish People. As a dancer begins a new verse he calls the spirits from their underwater malocas. And as he calls them, they come to possess him. When the song is over the Fish People return to the sites from where they came. In the eyes of the 63 shaman, then, the masked dancers are the Fish People, alive and present in the dance house.
***
The Fish People, wai masa, figure prominently in Makuna myths. They are spirits of the he worldthe timeless world of myth in which animals and men are undifferentiated, but also a dimension of the present, an invisible spiritual reality which exists parallel to the visible world of ordinary experience. In the ordinary world, Fish People appear as fish, wai, but in the vision of the shaman fish are really a kind of people, masa. The peach palm harvest coincides with the migration of the sabaletaa fruit-eating species and important food fish of the Brycon family. This coincidence is deeply significant to the Makuna; they say that when the sabaleta spawn at the beginning of the wet season in March-April, it is the Fish People who dance at their birth houses. During the harvest season of the peach palm, the fat sabaleta travel

down in shoals from its feeding areas in the tributaries of the Pirá-Paraná river to the Apaporis river to spawn along the shores of Manaitara island. After the spawning period, great numbers of spent and exhausted fish die in the turbid waters around the island or perish on their journey back to their upriver habitat.
The migrating fish are the Fish People travelling to dance in Water Anacondas underwater maloca at Manitara. It is said that the sabaleta are men, the palometaanother important food fishwomen. When they travel in the river, they appear as fish; when they go up on land, they turn into animals of the forest. As they enter the underwater maloca at Manaitara they become people, beautifully painted and dressed in ritual costume. They drink the peach palm juice, and receive blessed snuff from their host, Water Anaconda himself. Thus, when the fish spawn at Manaitara, it is the spirit people who dance their own peach palm dance.
The mythical images of the dance in Water Anacondas maloca account for the form and organisation of the peach palm festival as enacted today. The first part of the ritual, rumua sahare, represents the arrival of the Fish People in their various animal shapes at the underwater maloca at Manaitara. The animal spirits are greeted and received with food, drink and shamanized snuff. The second part, the peach palm dance proper, enacts the actual dance of the visiting spirits, jota basa, as it was once performed in mythical times and still is in the invisible he world when fish spawn and the peach palm bears fruit. The transition between the two phases of the ritual corresponds to a passage from one life world to another, an act of creation and transformation; when men remove their masks after the spirit dance and begin the peach palm dance, the spirits shed their animal appearances and turn into people in the waking-up-house of the clan ancestors.
The clue to the deeper levels of meaning of the ritual is suggested by the two Makuna wordsrumua and nyicu masaused to describe and address the masked dancers, and indeed the masks themselves. The former term,

translated here as spirits, properly means ghosts, a term the Makuna use for the spirits of the dead. The phrase nyicu masa means grandfather people, denoting living as well as dead ancestors at two or more generations remove. There is thus a clear sense in which the Fish People are identified with human ancestors. The spirits, who come to visit the living during the dance, are the souls of deceased relatives.
Manaitara is the waking-up-house of the Water People clans. Here, in the underwater maloca of their ancestor, the spirits of deceased Makuna men and women reside, leading a life parallel to that of the living. At the birth of a child the soul of a defunct grandparent travels from the waking-up-house at Manaitara into this world and enters the body of the new-born child. The child receives the name of the soul-giving ancestor and becomes mystically identified with him or her. At death the soul returns to its point of origin and joins the spirit people at Manaitara. The journey of the soul at the beginning and end of life thus repeats the mythical journey of the ancestral anacondas, 64 when people were first created and the earth populated.
However, the waking-up-house of the Makuna people is also, as we have seen, the major spawning ground of the sabaleta fish. The territory of the Makuna clans corresponds to the migratory routes of the sabaleta. During their seasonal migrations, the fish of the Komenya river repeat the journey of the human soul at birth, death, and rebirth, which was also the trajectory of the ancestors when they travelled between the margins and the centre of the world. Thus, the myth of the creative journey of the ancestors and the journey of the soul in the life cycle of individuals are both patterned after the seasonal migration of fish.
In the shamans vision, then, the fish migrating between the headwaters of Komenya and the island of Manaitara on the Apaporis are the souls of the deceased returning to their point of origin, their waking-up-house. The visiting spirits of the peach palm festival are the unborn children of future generations of people, the reborn spirits of the dead coming to fertilize the liv-

ing. When men dance in this world, the spirits also dance in theirs. And as men and spirits dance, fish spawn, palms bear fruit, and people procreate. Makuna say this ritual dancing actually causes animals and people to reproduce and multiply. In their view, dancing creates and maintains life. Just as the ancestors sang and danced the world into existence, people today through their communal ritualsseasonally recreate the world. The peach palm festival, then, is in its broadest sense a fertility ritual whose performance ensures the regeneration of nature and the fecundity of humankind. By inviting the spirits of the dead into the house of the living, the Makuna unlock the generative power of death, which is also the ultimate source of life.
***
The rituals of the peach palm festival speak to us across barriers of culture; its most general message transcends frontiers of time and space. The dance of the spirits thus expresses the Makuna cultural wisdom that man and nature are aspects of a single reality, that all living beings participate in a cosmic society, structured by common relations of kinship and exchange, and that there is a fundamental unity of life behind the apparent disparity in form. During the ritual drama this vision of man and nature is transformed into a powerful personal experience for the participants, which shapes and reshapes their perception of reality. Processes of nature are brought under human control, and human actions are shown to have consequences for the working of nature. By turning ecology into ritual, Makuna enable themselves to act upon nature within a meaningful context of moral values and sacred duties. The sacralization of nature provides a firmperhaps the onlybasis for a careful use of its resources.

CHAPTER SIX
A Threatened World
65
IN 1986, GOLD was discovered in the hills along the Taraira river,
only two days walking distance from the Makuna territory. Over the years thousands of miners have entered the Taraira valley, and whole towns have appeared in what was once the heart of the forest. Encroaching on their ancestral land, destroying the forest, polluting the rivers, and increasingly eroding their culture, the gold mining at Taraira threatens the entire Makuna world.

Life and Death in a Mining Town
In March 1990, I visited Cerro Rojo, one of the new mining towns in Taraira. Since 1989, a small airfield serves the gold fields, which earlier could be reached only by river and trail from La Pedrera and Mitú. With the airstrip and the army post which soon followed, the regional government has now established a fragile foothold in the area, previously ruled by one of Colombias militant guerrilla movements. Still present, though now less visible, the insurgents continue to tax the wealthier miners and traders.
As the single-engine, small plane flew in towards Cerro Rojo, I could see the Taraira river winding between hills and rocky outcrops in the dense forest beneath, marking the boundary between Colombia and Brazil. Scattered camps, clearings, and bare spots of red earth scarring the forest, revealed the presence of the miners. The airstrip, dividing the town in two parts, looked just like another patch of cleared and bare-scraped land. On one side were the army post, a few administrative buildings and shops, while on the other side the mining town proper spread out haphazardly over the hill of Cerro Rojo.
After landing, I headed for the towns only hotel along a path leading across a small stream and through a cleared and burned patch of forest. Heaps of discarded beer and coke cans lay scattered among the charred tree stumps some sticking half-way up from the ashes, looking like the strange crop of a recently planted swidden; a harvest of waste, the barren fruits of civilization.
The hotel was a thatched wooden shelter on poles. Over a few beers on the austere veranda, Jorge, the local governor, later told me that the number of miners in Taraira is declining. In the three main mining towns in the regionCerro Rojo, Garrimpo, and Peladerathere are now perhaps 3000 people as compared to some 6-7000 in the late 1980s, when the mining population reached its peak. At that time, several boat-loads of people arrived every day from La Pedrera. Now, most people enter Taraira by air from Mitú.

We are all a bunch of fortune hunters and adventurers here, he said, sipping his beer, a special brand of people who never liked the settled life in the city, nor the drudgery of farm life in the countryside. Before coming to Taraira, Jorge worked in the emerald mines of Santander. Of those who came with me in 1987, only a few are still here, he continued. Many have left, some totally broke, others with only pocket money to return back home. In the beginning it was easy to find gold in the streamsnot much but some. Today the easy finds are becoming scarce. Only those with the money to invest in pumps, dredges, and other heavy machinery remain.
When Jorge came to Cerro Rojo there were only a few camps on the hill. He was one of the pioneers. But within a few months several hundred people came. The town grew rapidly and totally unplanned. With the miners came traders, prostitutes, and adventurers from every corner of the country. In the beginning the miners simply panned for gold in the shallow streams. Now teams of miners clear big areas of land, scrap and sift the top soil, and a few 66 successful patrons have begun to cut deep tunnels into the rocks, fetching wagon-loads of rocks which are crushed to gravel and dust, and sifted for gold. The once forested hill at Cerro Rojo is today bare. The red soil which gave the hill its name is scraped away, and the rock itself is perforated and reduced to dust. Piles of gravel tower over the devastated land; a forest turned into wasteland.
In the late afternoon I walked with Jorge to the other side of the town. The muddy trail lead from the level land near the airstrip to the hill where the miners live and work. On the trail there was a steady traffic of porters, loaded with petrol tanks, cases of beer, and all kinds of other goods. The local transport service, said Jorge jestingly. Here everything has to be carried on human backs. Not even donkeys manage the trails and the climate out here. As porters the miners who never quite made it in the gold fields can still make a living in Taraira.
The trail winds through the forest, across streams and swamps, up on the

rocky hillside, and into the shantytown of Cerro Rojo, located a few kilometres from the airfield. Everything in this town except the poles and planks used for the houses has been carried from the port of the Taraira river, several hours walk away, Jorge said. I remember when they carried the first pool table all the way from the port to the town; six men, muddy up to their waists. What a sight it must have been: the heavy, finely carved table carried in procession by the men like some sacred cult objecta relic of their civilizationinto this wilderness!
The town itself was a muddle of ramshackle buildings scattered over the hill. The housessimple frames of poles with plastic or tin sheets for roof looked as if they were erected overnight. Muddy foot paths connected the houses, shops, and bars. All sorts of trade goods could be found in the shops from hoes and pans to radio-cassette recorders and clothes of latest Brazilian fashion. The bars served beer, cooled in petrol refrigerators, and the shelves were brimful with liquor including aguardientethe local Colombian liquor, Brazilian brandy, and imported Scotch whiskyall brought from Mitú and La Pedrera.
Only gold counts as currency in the mining towns and with it everything is for sale, including sexamor minerathe gold miners love. Every shop and bar has a scale for weighing gold dust and nuggets, and the girls of the local brothels evaluate prospective customers according to the quantity of gold they carry in small containers hanging from their necks.
At the far end of the town are the mines proper. Heaps of soil and gravel reveal the work sites from afar. Wagons, loaded with stone boulders, emerge from tunnels and trenches on wooden rails. Nearby are the work sheds and machines for crushing the boulders and sifting the gravel for gold. The mines are, in effect, merely a huge factory for grinding the entire hill to gravel and dust. The clear streams that once flowed from the hill into the Taraira river are now polluted by the mercury used by the panners to separate the gold from the sand and the soil. These deposits will last at least fifty years, said

Jorge confidently. We plan the township to last for that period. Then the gold will be finished... And the land wasted, he might have added, as evidenced by the ghostlike sceneries of abandoned gold-fields in other parts of Colombia.
At dusk we entered a bar. The melancholic tune of a lambadastrangely out of place in this wildernessdrowned our efforts to converse. I sat back to watch and listen. In a corner sat two pale and weary-looking bar girls, excessively made up as if trying to conceal the vestiges and vicissitudes of their trade and the hardships they endure in places like this. A few couples began to dancelambada, samba, cambia, salsa. One man in particular caught my attention, as beaming with joy he swung one girl after another across the dance-floor. He was one of the porters we met earlier on the trail to town, then bent under a heavy petrol drum.
The bar was getting crowded. I exchanged a few words with a man who sat down to share a bottle of aguardiente with us. Like me, he said, most of 67 the men here have their wives and children at home, far away from here. We dont live here, we just work and suffer, and if we make some money we send it home to our families. We stay until we have enough to return home with something in our pockets. Many of the miners have spent all their savings to come here, and many do not earn enough even for the ticket back home. Others, spend what they earn in the bars and brothels. Despite the rough surface and apparent companionship among the miners, there are deep social and economic cleavages in Cerro Rojo. Here, as elsewhere in the Amazonian mining towns, the big profits are not made by the miners but the patrons, traders, and entrepreneursthe owners of capital and machinery.
Night wore on, and people began to get drunk. Voices were raised, jokes exchanged, but also insults and threats. In the lawless mining towns tempers easily run high and brawls are commonplace. People fight over gold, merchandise, and women, and all carry guns. Most miners spend the weeks working in remote camps and come to town only during week endsto shop, drink,

and drown the drudgery and hardships of their toil, like sailors in port. The dream of making a fortune keeps the spirit high during long work days in the mines. Jorge did not drink much that night; partly, perhaps, as a concession to his office, but also because he was obviously worried about me. The fellows around here are not very civilized, he said. When they drink, they can get pretty nasty. We had better leave before it gets too late. I looked around and agreed.
We left and staggered downhill in the darkness. At the outskirts of the town I almost stumbled on a wooden cross stuck in the muddy roadside. Jorge explained that a man was killed here a few months ago. It was a bar brawl and both were drunk. It was just bad luck. The killer is otherwise a good man. He still works in a camp a couple of hours away from here. Over there, he continued, pointing to another crude cross, another man, a White man, a civilizado, was killed only weeks ago by an indio, one of his workers. A brutal murder, he was shot point blank. The murderer disappeared and is hiding out there somewhere... I had heard of many such cases, including the story about a young Makuna man, who recently killed his patron in fury because the patron refused to pay him for his work. Almost every other week there is a new cross put up, Jorge said. Life is really rough out here, one has to be careful. And as I carefully steered towards the hotel, I was glad to be still alive.
The Shaman’s Eye
The Taraira valley is a wild and inhospitable tract of dense forest, steep hills, and violent streams. Twenty years ago, when I first came to the Makuna, the area was uninhabited and rarely visited by the Indians. According to the Makuna it was sacred land, never meant to be inhabited by human beings.
The hills where miners today dig for gold form part of the protective wall

encircling the Makuna world and supporting the sky. In their cosmology mountains and rocks are petrified ancestral beings, the transfixed mythical heroes that created the world and maintain all life on earth. The Hill of the Sun, overlooking the great Sun Fall in the middle course of the Taraira river, contains the light and heat of the Primal Sun. From the Sun Fall northwards, a line of hills extends along the upper reaches of the river. The Jaguar Hill is said to be the ancestral Sky Jaguar with its rugged peak his petrified head. The Hill of the Shamans Stool is his stool in the cosmic maloca, and the Metal Hill his golden ornament. When shamans bless coca and snuff in the maloca they offer food to these hills. By caring for the spirits of the hills they protect the people from illness and misfortune.
Gold itself is culturally significant to the Makuna as indicated by its many names and symbolic allusions. It is called he cahea macuri, the shamans vision or spirit eyes, since it allows the shaman to see beyond the appearances of things into the world of the spirits. Gold, the Makuna say, contains 68 the light of the sun and stars. Just as the sun and the stars are the visible manifestations of the ancestral beings in the sky, gold is the sign of ancestral life on earth. Therefore gold is also called the stars of the earth. Another metaphor for gold is the gods ornament alluding to a myth about the beginning of time when the world was dark and chaotic. As the ancestral people dressed in ritual regalia, put on their sacred ornaments and began to dance, the present world was created. Ayawa, the seniormost of the mythical heroes, made a star descend to the earth to illuminate the cosmic maloca in which the ancestral people were dancing and singing the world into being. This star became the Hill of the Star on the lower Apaporis river, and its gold is the materialized reflection of its light.
In Makuna territory myth and reality blend. The forest, the hills, and the rivers are at once physical nature and the sacred space of the cosmic maloca. What the Whites call gold, for the Makuna is a gateway into the spirit world. The light it contains illuminates their world and bestows on the shaman his

clairvoyant powers. According to Makuna, then, gold belongs to the spirits of the hills and should be left where it is. As the miners now carve into the rocks of Taraira, they are literally cutting into the foundations of the Makuna universe.
To the Whites gold means wealth and worldly powers, and for gold they are prepared to suffer, kill and die. The miners success is conspicuously displayed in golden necklaces, bracelets, and chains, and profits are quickly spent in bars and brothels. To the Makuna, in contrast, the gold in the hills and streams of Taraira used to be part of their spiritual legacy. In their minds and by means of their imaginative thought Indians used, and still use, the shining light of goldthe Shamans Eyeto cure and prevent illness and to protect people from evil. Gold, then, means very different things to the Indians and the Whites, and the different meanings reflect their contrasted life-ways and world views.
Luciano’s Story
Times are changing, and Makuna shamanic wisdom no longer hold the same sway over people. Today the young men of Komenya recognize the earthly powers of gold. In fact, it was a Makuna boy, Luciano, who first discovered it on the Colombian side of the Taraira river in 1986, thus unwittingly bringing the miners to the threshold of his community. His story is both moving and instructive since it brings into focus the current predicament of the Indians as they try to cope with a rapidly changing realitythe obstacles and opportunities they encounter, and the hopes and despairs they experience.
I knew Luciano well from my first stay in Komenya when he was only twelve or thirteen years old. He had no schooling and spoke no Spanish but was a notoriously clever and curious boy. While I stayed in the traditionalstyle maloca of his father, he often spent time with me, teaching me his lan-

guage and taking me out for hunting and fishing trips while at the same time quickly learning some Spanish.
When I returned to Komenya in 1988, Luciano was away in the gold fields but a year later he told me his story in his own words. In the early 1980s, he married his cousinaccording to the traditional customand went to live with his parents-in-law just across the border in Brazil. By then he had obtained a few years of schooling and had a job on a Catholic mission post near the headwaters of the Taraira river.
While there he learnt the techniques of gold panning and eventually left his job with the mission to join a team of gold minersgarrimpeirosprospecting for gold in the hills on the eastern bank of the Taraira river. Realizing that there must be gold deposits also on the Colombian side, he later returned home to explore it.
Together with some Brazilian friends he spent several weeks in early 1986 traversing the area known to him from hunting trips since childhood. To 69 facilitate transport along the Taraira river they cut a trail and dragged a canoe through the forested watershed between the Pirá-Paraná and Taraira river systems, a tremendous feat taking them several weeks. In the process Luciano was badly wounded by a splinter penetrating his foot but undaunted continued the explorations until they finally struck gold in a stream flowing from the hills overlooking the Sun Falls.
Luciano returned with a modest share of gold grains to Komenya, and after receiving the blessings of his father to continue his undertaking, he went on to the mission village of Trinidad on the Tiquié river, where he sold the gold to the Catholic Father, locally known as Padre GramoFather Goldfor his interest in gold. In Trinidad he also sought in vain to interest the local Tuyuka Indians in a joint, small-scale gold mining venture. Since the Tuyuka and Makuna were allies, Luciano had the idea that the two communities should pool their resources, buy tools and equipment, and together exploit the gold deposits he had just discovered. In this way, he thought, they

would be able to control their own source of wealth, and obtain trade goods without White middlemen. But the Tuyuka were not interested; they were afraid that the project would only bring them trouble, so Luciano went ahead on his own.
Luciano related the incident with some bitterness: This was our chance to become independent from the rubber patrons, he said. But they did not understand it.We dont need gold, we dont want to be like the Whites, they said. I told them that we are already half-Whites. We need clothes, shotguns, fish hooks, and aluminium pots. It is too late to think we can live without it. We are no longer uncivilized Indians, like our ancestors, I said. If you think that you dont need money, you are wrong. We all need it. And I am going to get it, even if I have to work on my own, I told them.
From Trinidad Luciano then went to Mitú to obtain equipment to continue his work in Taraira. Since his money did not suffice, he took goods on credit from White traders. Although he tried to keep silent about his discovery the news soon spread. Indebted Luciano returned to Komenya where he exchanged most of the trade goods for farinhathe local manioc flour and the miners staple. Loaded with manioc flour and mining equipment, he went on to Taraira with some local friends, hoping to find more gold with which to pay off his debts and buy more trade goods. Instead, this was for Luciano the beginning of a process of increasing debts, dependence, and impoverishment.
He built a camp at the shores of the Taraira river, just below the Sun Falls. He brought his wife and children to stay with him. He found more gold, and again went to Mitú. He paid off part of his debts, and took more trade goods and equipment on credit. When he returned to his camp in Taraira he found that the stream he had claimed for himself had been invaded by White miners, some of whom worked for his creditor in Mitú. Groups of Indians among them some Tuyuka from Trinidadnow also began to arrive and claim other streams nearby. The Whites had entered the Taraira by river and trail from La Pedrera. Arriving in large numbers, and better equipped with arms

and tools the White miners soon appropriated the richer deposits. This was in late 1986. Only eight months earlier Luciano had first found
the gold but was now forced to leave his site and look for another. He was heavily indebted and his situation gradually deteriorated. He found other streams and more gold, but he never succeeded in meeting his debts. In order to avoid the expensive trips to Mitú he decided at one point to send his gold with a trusted White miner returning to Mitú to renew his supplies. The miner, however, disappeared with the gold and was never seen again. Lucianos creditor in Mitú, now also his patron, claimed that he never received the gold. By 1988 more than six thousand miners worked in Taraira. Indians from the entire region came and went, forming a floating mining population. Today Luciano still lives with his family at the Sun Falls on the Taraira, and still hopes to make a living panning the gold he once discovered.
Lucianos story is in many respects typical of the history of Indian-White relations in the Amazon. Native lands and resources suddenly become at- 70 tractive to White entrepreneurs, colonizers and miners, and the Indians previously unimportant to the dominant societynow become either a cheap labour force to exploit or an obstacle to be removed. As a result, they are dispossessed, violently forced, or unknowingly drawn into the commercial economy dominated and manipulated by the Whites. The rubber boom at the turn of the century, the coca trade in the 1970s and 80s, and now the gold rush all follow the same historical pattern.
The current developments in Taraira are but a part of a gigantic gold rush sweeping through the Amazon since the late 1970s with no signs to abate. Several hundred thousand gold minersinheritors of the early conquerors and colonistshave entered the region, clearing the forest, building roads and airstrips, and establishing mining camps and towns in almost every corner of the Amazon. Invasions on native lands and violent confrontations with Indians are recurrent events, most notoriously in the territory of the Yanomami Indians near the Brazilian-Venezuelan frontier. Compared to the

Yanomami, whose land is invaded by more than 30,000 miners, the Makuna are fortunate: their territory is protected by law as part of the extensive Vaupés Indian resguardo, and they still have control over their lives and means of survival.
Amazonian Apocalypse
The Amazonian rain-forest is one of the oldest ecosystems in the world. Its complex web of life, evolved during millions of years, brings our species in contact with the roots of creation. Perhaps this is what the Indians mean when they say that the land is alive and embody the creative powers of the ancestral beings. To the Indians, nature is part of their culture and as such potently meaningful. Therefore the destruction of the Amazonian environment not only impoverishes the land and deprives its native inhabitants of their means of survival but also drains the spiritual sources of their existence. The death of the forest severs their ties to the ancestors, silences their myths, and renders their lives meaningless.
The Whites say we are poor, Ignacio once said, but we used to be rich. We dont have money or trade goods, but our ancestors gave us another, lighter kind of wealth. They gave us our land, the forest and the rivers to feed us, and they gave us the knowledge to use it, and the myths and rituals to maintain life and protect us from evil. But we no longer take care of our land, and the young do not listen to what we elders tell them. They no longer want to follow the ancestral way, and prefer to go to school and listen to the Whites. But the Whites have no respect for our land and disregard our traditions...
The gold mining in Taraira precipitates the processes of change among the Makuna and neighbouring groups. The mining towns now supply most of the trade goods flowing into the Makuna communities and most young men today spend weeks and months away in the gold fields. For long periods

the village of Santa Isabel on the Komenya can be almost abandoned. When the men return, the village revives and there is plenty of food in the houses. Often groups of Indians from other communities pass through the village on their way to or from Taraira, staying for a few days to rest and socialize.
Gold brings trade goods into the communities, but mining also takes time and effort from the daily subsistence activities. While the men are away in the gold fields women and children are left to sustain themselves as best they can for months at a time. The periodic presence of outsiders - Indian miners from other villages and territories - represents a source of strain and additional pressure on scarce subsistence resources. The demand for trade goods has increased to a degree far beyond what is possible to satisfy. Young women today want men who can provide them with dresses, trinkets, and other trade goods. Economic differentiation is accelerated, and though some men are more successful than others in obtaining trade goods, all are poor according to national standards. The domestic economy is becoming more individual- 71 ized, and the all-important principle of reciprocity is loosing its force.
As miners begin to penetrate their world and extract its gold, many Makuna feel increasingly threatened and unprotected. The vision of the shaman is blurred, they say, and his powers weakened. Ignacio and other elders see gold mining in Taraira as a sign of a pending apocalypse. They fear the imminent destruction of their world.
According to the Makuna creation myth, the present world emerged out of the ruins of a previous one. The Ancestral Mother, Woman Shaman, destroyed the old world because its inhabitants did not respect her creation. People ate each other, brothers had sex with their sisters, plant seedlings bore fruits, and pre-pubescent girls gave birth to children. Woman Shaman therefore drowned the world, and as people desperately gathered on the hilltops at the margins of the world, jaguars, eagles, and huge anacondas killed and devoured them unsparingly. Then Woman Shaman set the world on fire and burned it to ashes. The earth was left like a swidden with only charred bones

and skulls scattered on its devastated surface. The ruins of the old world sank into the underworld, and the sky fell down and became the new earth from which new generations of people emergedthe ancestors of the present-day Makuna clans.
The Makuna interpret their current reality in terms of this myth. During long nights the elders sit smoking and chewing coca in the centre of the maloca, commenting on the events of the day and the signs of the time. To them, the encroachment of the Whites on their ancestral land, the violence of the mining towns, the surging strife and division within their communities, and the childrens increasing neglect of ancient traditions all forebode a catastrophic end of the world. Makuna elders fear that there will be no place for their people in the new world emerging out of the ruins of the present one.
***
I would like to think that the apocalyptic vision of Makuna elders is premature, and that there still is a place for them in the world of today and tomorrow. As long as they are able to hold on to their land they may survive as a people. Their culture has proved resilient in the past and its strength is dynamic. Along with other native groups in the Pirá-Paraná area, the Makuna have survived the dramatic impact of previous boom-economies. Just as in their rituals, life is constantly renewed through death and rebirth, and just as they have recovered after the decline of the rubber boom and coca trade, it is possible they will emerge from the current crisis transformed but reinvigorated, their society changed and their lives accommodated to a new reality, yet remaining distinctively MakunaLand and Water People, People of the Forest.

Notes
1. The term blackwater refers to the dark colour of these rivers, owing to their humic acids and lack of silts. Early chroniclers described them as rivers of hunger because of their biological poverty.
2. As a result of the early violent encounters with the Whitesfrom the 18th century and up to the beginning of the present centurythe Indians withdrew to the less accessible headwaters and tributaries.
3. The evangelical mission represented in Vaupés above all by the North Ameri-
can-based Summer Institute of Linguistics may also have played an important 72
role in this development (see below).
4. As traditionally used by the Indians in the region, the cocanot to be confused with the chemically refined cocaineconsists of a green, powderlike substance prepared from the leaves of the coca plant (Erythroxilon coca). The preparation of coca is described in Chapter 4.
5. Basuco is a semi-refined by-product obtained in the process of cocaine production. Being cheap and in abundant supply it was widely used among the Indians in the region during the boom days.
6. For detailed references regarding the history of Vaupés, see S. Hugh-Jones, 1981.
7. For a comprehensive account of the atrocities of the rubber barons in the Northwest Amazon, see Pineda, 1987.
8. These inter-tribal hostilities may partly have been a consequence of the slaveraiding which ravaged in the Northwest Amazon between 1750-1850 but it was probably also inherent in the indigenous cultures of the time. Warfare apparently had a ritual character and formed part of the perpetual exchange relationship among socially distant groups. Just like hunting still is today, war-

fare may in the past have been seen as a male regenerative activity, a sort of cosmic fertility ritual, creating new life through the killing of othersdistant peoples or animals. (See also below).
9. The hierarchical ideology of the Tukano-speaking groups of Vaupés is thoroughly described and analyzed by Stephen and Christine Hugh-Jones in their works on the Barasana, neighbours of the Makuna (see also below).

13. The social and political importance of the maloca is declining with the current break-up of longhouse communities and the formation of nucleated villages. Yet culturally Pirá-Paraná society is still very much centred on the maloca as an ideologically and ritually effective unit. In other parts of the Vaupés, however, there are today fewer traces of the Tukanoan maloca tradition.
14. Though particularly associated with the men, elderly women may also take snuff and coca in modest quantities, and men, women and children all drink chicha. On the other hand, while men are expected to consume only ritual foods during feasts, women and children also eat ordinary foods.
15. The drink is prepared from a mixture of leaves and the bark from the yagé vine (Banisteriopsis caapi).

32. The ecology and migratory behaviour of characins in central Brazil are de-

scribed and analyzed by Goulding (1980). His findings confirm my own lay

observations from the Pirá-Paraná drainage system and the accounts given by

expert Makuna fishermen.

33. Current views on the prehistory and palaeo-ecology of the Amazon are reviewed, for example, in Meggers (1988) and Reichel (1987).

36. Sábalo (Brycon), sabaleta (Colossoma), palometa (Myleus), waracú (Leporinus), taraira (Erythrinus), and pintadillo (Pseudoplatystoma) are some of the most important food fishes (see below).

37. This estimate tallies well with findings from related Tukanoan groups. Thus, Chernela (1987:50) has calculated that among the Uanano of the upper Rio Negro fishing may be restricted to less than 40% of the river margin available in their territory. (See also Clay, 1988).

38. The Hupdu Makú identify at least 40 species of edible forest fruits and nuts

(though only about a quarter is harvested in any significant quantity) and the Bará Makú recognize 54 different kinds of edible fruits (Reid, 1979; Silverwood-Cope, 1972; both quoted in Moran, 1991).
39. The grubs are known in Vaupés as mojojoy (in Makuna: wadoa), predominantly of the species Calandra palmarum. The custom of breeding grubs is widespread in the Amazon (cf. Clay, 1988:6).

43. In light of the foregoing discussion it is clear that any estimate of the period of forest recolonization is at best approximate. In poor soils of blackwater ecosystems the full recovery of natural vegetation may take over one hundred years (Moran, 1991).
44. See Clay (1988), Hecht and Cockburn (1989), Posey and Balée (1989).
