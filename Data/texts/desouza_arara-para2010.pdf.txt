ABSTRACT In this thesis I describe the morphology of nouns in the Ugoroŋmo language (Arara of Pará), which is spoken by just over three hundred people. The Ugoroŋmo people live on the bank of the Iriri river, in two villages (Laranjal and Cachoeira Seca) in the state of Pará, Brazil. The nouns of this language can be divided in three main groups: those that are not inflected for possession, those that may be inflected for possession, and those that must be inflected for possession (inherently possessed nouns). Possession is marked by two affixes: a possessor prefix and a possessive suffix. Inherently possessed nouns can also be inflected in an absolute form, indicating that the possessor is not expressed. The nouns can be inflected with five suffixes that indicate case. Most of these relate to location, but one is the comparative case. Nouns are inflected for plural in two ways, and the interpretation of the plural suffix depends on the type of noun. Possessed nouns can be marked for both plural possessor and plural possessed item. Compound nouns are formed from two (or occasionally three) roots. All of the attested compound nouns are possessed nouns. Modifying suffixes that denote size, shape, etc., expand the nouns in interesting ways. Finally, predicate adjectives are derived from nouns. They all have the meaning ‘characterized as having (noun)’.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
The subject of this thesis is nouns, which belong to one of two major word classes in the Ugoroŋmo language; the other main class is verbs. In Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 I discuss morphological marking for possession. In Chapter 4, case suffixes are illustrated. Chapter 5 treats the marking of plurality. In Chapter 6 I discuss compound nouns and modifying suffixes. In Chapter 7, the denominal predicate adjective is described. This thesis does not deal with names in detail, nor do I consider them as a type of noun (see Anderson 2007: 239). Nevertheless, the discussion of nouns here includes examples showing how names may or may not work similarly. Other topics related to nouns are not in the scope of this thesis such as: nominalization, verbalization and incorporation.
The data used in this thesis were collected in the village of Laranjal and the Posto de Vigilância 1 under the auspices of the Brazilian nonprofit organization Associação Linguística Evangélica Missionária (ALEM), which is headquartered in Brasilia. The data corpus is in a standard format database consisting of about 3,000 entries plus a few texts.
I present the Ugoroŋmo data using a set of symbols that is slightly different from the standard IPA symbols for the phonemes of the language, as shown in Table 1.1 Specifically note the symbols for /g/, /ɾ/, /ɛ/ and /ɔ/.
1 The phonemes are presented in I. Souza (2010). 1

1.2 General information about the language community The name ―Arara‖ [aˈɾaɾa], which means ‗macaw‘ in Portuguese, is used to refer to
four different native ethnic groups of Brazil whose languages are not related to each other.3 The first is the Arara-Karo group, which is found in the state of Rondônia.4 Their language belongs to the Ramarama family, a branch of Tupi (Rodrigues 1986). The second group known as Arara lives in the state of Acre.5 They speak a language classified as Panoan. A third group lives in the state of Mato Grosso.6 They no longer speak their native language. The fourth Arara group lives in the state of Pará and speaks a language that belongs to the Cariban family (Rodrigues 1986). The particular Arara group to which I refer in this thesis is the last one. The ISO 639-3 code for this language is [aap]. The Cariban family has an estimated 40 members in the Amazonian area. Among them are the Makushi, Karinya, Pemon, Panare, Waiwai, Wayana, Tiriyó, Hixkaryana, Apalaí, Kuikuro, Bakairi and Ikpeng (Meira 2006). The language in this family that is closest to the Arara language is Ikpeng (Rodrigues 1986), also referred to as Txikão.
The earliest information about the Arara of Pará is from a report given in 1853 by Brusque, the president of the province of Pará.7 Brusque says that for some period of time the Arara had peaceful relationships with rubber tappers; more than once they encamped together. Some years later, in 1864, the Arara people had some conflicts with the Juruna people, and in 1884 Von Den Stein met among the Juruna an Arara man being kept as a

Souza, in progress). 4 The ISO 639-3 code for Arara-Karo is [arr]. 5 Arara from Acre is also called Arara Shawãdawa (Instituto Socioambiental - ISA). 6 Arara from Mato Grosso is also called Arara do Beiradão or Arara do Rio Branco (Poz, 2007). 7 I.

prisoner. In 1917 the Arara tried to contact some rubber tappers without success; the rubber tappers shot at them.
Several times the Arara had contact with outsiders.8 Some of these contacts were peaceful and some not. In 1967, the workers constructing the Trans-Amazonian Highway (Transamazônica) were attacked by indigenous people. So at that time a group sent by the FUNAI9 went to try to contact them. Among the group were Afonso Alves da Cruz, Cláudio Villas Boas, Orlando Villas Boas and Francisco Meirelles. They did not find the Arara people; they found only a village with vestiges of their presence. During several years only signs of them were found.
However, in the mid-seventies and early eighties, the presence of the Arara in the area was again made known. In 1976 they had some conflict with a group of workers from a metal exploration company. Between 1977 and 1980 some FUNAI workers were shot with arrows by the Arara. In early 1981, five Arara people came to the Posto de Vigilância 1 and made contact with FUNAI workers.
The name ―Arara‖ was used by outsiders before any contact was made, and it still remains in use. However, the people call themselves Ugoroŋmo [ugɔɾɔŋˈmɔ], which is the free pronoun for first person inclusive, ugoro, with a plural suffix. Without the plural suffix this pronoun has an interpretation of first person inclusive dual, while with the plural suffix -ŋmo, it has two interpretations. First, Ugoroŋmo indicates the first person inclusive plural. It also indicates the Arara people in contrast to the non-indigenous people (karei) and also in contrast to other indigenous people known to the Arara, such as awɯteka, udot, udotpɯem, peleum, tɯmobugamo, tɯtʃimilamo, tɯbɯrɯbi, wapete,

watɯmiŋgom, tobiuŋgemnɯ, idarerɯma and imarama.10 In this thesis I refer to them by their indigenous name.
Groups of the Ugoroŋmo were contacted by FUNAI, the Brazilian government agency, in three different stages: 1981, 1983, and 1987. The two groups contacted in 1981 and 1983 had originally lived together, but due to some internal conflicts they split and stayed apart for about 38 years preceding the contacts by FUNAI.11 The construction of the Trans-Amazonian Highway built in the early 1970s caused them to be more separated than before, although they still had an idea where their relatives were living. The first group to be contacted was on the south side of kilometer 120, where FUNAI had built an observation station (called Posto de Vigilância 1), and the second group was on the north side of kilometer 80. At the time of contact, the first group had only 50 people. During the process of getting acquainted with them, the FUNAI agent responsible for that contact asked them if they still had any relatives in the forest. They said they did, and helped FUNAI contact their relatives, making this second contact much easier than the first. The second group had only 20 people. The two groups together totaled 70 people in 1983.
For a while, the second group stayed apart from the first, but eventually they all began living together at the same place, where they have now lived for many years. Their village, called Laranjal, is located on the bank of the Iriri river, a tributary of the Xingu river, in the state of Pará. The third group was contacted in 1987 by another FUNAI agent. This group lives in another place, Cachoeira Seca, more than six hours upriver by
10 I. Souza, (2003). Some of these groups may be extinct; the Ugoroŋmo do not relate most of these terms to groups with whom they presently interact. The name awɯteka does, however, refer to the Kayapó people.
11 I. Souza (in progress) gives this calculation of the length of the split based on information about a conflict that occured in 1945. The Ugoroŋmo claim that they separated shortly after that conflict.

The three groups speak the same language, which they refer to as Ugoroŋmo worondu ‗language of the Ugoroŋmo‘, but each group displays some small dialectal differences. They differ in some specific words. For example, the first group says [tʃaɾina] for ‗chicken‘ while the second group says [kaɾina]. (I do not have information from the third group for this word.) They also differ in more systematic ways. The first group drops an [n] before a suffix-initial [j], while the second group palatalizes it in that position. (Again, I have no information from the third group for this situation.) For example, the word for ‗big man,‘ derived from the root ugon ‗man‘, is pronounced [uɡɔjum] by the first group, and [uɡɔɲjum] by the second. The people of the third group are able to communicate in the language easily with the people of the first two groups. My husband and I are also able to talk to them without any comprehension problem. In this thesis I am focusing only on the dialect of the first group.
In this group there is linguistic evidence for long-term cultural interaction between the Ugoroŋmo and other groups. In the region where the Ugoroŋmo people live, there are also other groups, such as the Xipáya, Curuáya, Kayapó, Asurini of Xingu, Araweté, Parakanã and the Juruna. Before contact with outsiders, the relationships among some of these groups were often not peaceful. Now they interact with each other in Altamira, the closest city to the village, where they obtain health services, food, and clothes, as well as attend meetings together, etc. The village closest to their own village is Kararahô, primarily populated by the Kayapó people. Sometimes the Kayapó soccer team goes to

the Ugoroŋmo village to play against their team, and the older Kayapó go to trade goods with the older Ugoroŋmo, from whom they acquire feathers for making headdresses.
Evidence of linguistic interaction is found in some of their shared vocabulary items. The word for ‗spoon‘ for example, is borrowed from the Kayapó. One word the Ugoroŋmo use for a certain drink is a Juruna word. One word for howler monkey, used only in a traditional song, is from the (unrelated) Tupi-Guarani language family. Although these words are borrowed, the Ugoroŋmo are not aware of this fact.
Portuguese is the main language that has influenced the Ugoroŋmo language since 1981. While there are still many older people in the village who know only a few Portuguese words, all people under 40 years of age speak Portuguese, with different levels of fluency. Some of the older ones in this second group were teenagers during the contact phase, so they have had contact with Portuguese since they were young. Nevertheless, the Ugoroŋmo continue to use of their own language among themselves.
The number of speakers has increased considerably in the past three decades. Since 1983 the number in the Laranjal community has increased from 70 people to 250.

CHAPTER 2 MORPHOLOGICAL MARKING FOR POSSESSION
Noun roots in the Ugoroŋmo language are divided into three groups: 1) those with no morphological possession; 2) those with optional morphological possession; and 3) those with obligatory morphological possession. Nouns in the second and third groups may or must have a prefix that indicates the person and number of the possessor, and a suffix that indicates that the item is possessed.
The first group of nouns (section 2.1) includes most common nouns that refer to items of nature, including inanimate items like the sun, the moon, stones, sand, and trees, as well as animate items like monkeys, birds, snakes, and fish. Some nouns referring to tools (e.g., nail and axe) are also in this class.
The second group (section 2.2) consists primarily of items that people commonly own. This is a small class.
Nouns in the third group (section 2.3) refer to body parts, relatives, and some personal items. A few inherently possessed nouns are used only to express relative location (section 2.3.6). Inherently possessed noun stems may also be derived through an unproductive morphological process (section 2.4).
2.1 Nouns that cannot be inflected for possession Noun roots that cannot be inflected for possession consist primarily of items found in
nature. The examples in (1) and (2) illustrate this group.
8

(1) Inanimate items

koŋbo idua aptenu ɯbɯ nuno tʃitʃi iɯi paru oroŋ

‗rain‘ ‗forest‘ ‗wind‘ ‗stone‘ ‗moon‘ ‗sun‘13 ‗tree‘ ‗river, water‘ ‗land‘

(2) Animate items

wakat wokori tawe potpɯri

‗alligator‘ ‗dog‘ ‗capuchin monkey (sp.)‘14 ‗wood tick‘

Some man-made objects are also included in this class; see examples in (3). (3) Man-made objects

obine obineum touŋ pɯtʃiga ugeni tamoegem

‗nail, metal, iron‘ ‗axe‘15 ‗shotgun‘16 ‗machete‘17 ‗container for liquids‘ ‗rake‘18

13 The noun for ‗sun‘ can also refer to time, watch. With the latter meaning it can be possessed, ɯ-tʃitʃi-n (1SG-watch-POSS) ‗my watch‘, o-tʃitʃi-n (2-watch-POSS) ‗your watch‘.
14 Probably Cebus sp. 15 The noun obine is used to refer to any metal (iron, gold, silver, etc.). The word for axe is formed by obine and the modifier suffix -um ‗Augmentative‘, which gives the idea of something bigger or manufactured. More details about this suffix are found in section 6.2.1. 16 The noun touŋ ‗shotgun‘ is an ideophone which describes the noise the shotgun makes. 17 There is another word for machete, potpipo, but it is used mainly by the older generation. 18 The noun t-amoe-g-em ‗rake‘ literally means ‗the one that has fingernail‘: t-amoe-g-em (T-fingernail-ADJR-NMLZR).
9

Nouns of the types shown in (1), (2), and (3) cannot be morphologically possessed, as

illustrated in (4), (5) and (6). (Details about morphological possession are presented

in Chapter 3.)
(4) *ɯ-iɯi *i-oroŋ
(5) *ɯ-potpɯri *ɯ-wokori
(6) *k-obine *ɯ-touŋ

(my tree) (my land)
(my tick) (my dog)
(my nail) (my shotgun)

This morphological restriction does not mean that the Ugoroŋmo do not own animals

or things, however. If a person wishes to refer to a possession that belongs to this group

of nouns, two options are used. One option is to simply use the noun, and the hearer must

infer from the situation that a particular possessed item is being referred to, as shown in

(7) and (8).

(7) obineum enep-ko

axe

bring-IMP

‗Bring the axe!‘

(8) wokori enep-ko

dog

bring-IMP

‗Bring the dog!‘

The second option is to use a possessed generic noun in the general context, as shown

in (9) and (10) using the generic nouns meaning ‗tool‘ and ‗pet‘, respectively.

(9) Speaker A:

ɯ-wɯ-n

1SG-tool-POSS bring-IMP

‗Bring my tool!‘

Speaker B: odɯ what.IN ‗Which (inanimate) one?‘

10

Speaker A: obineum ‗axe‘ ‗The axe.‘

‗A: Bring my tool! B: Which one? A: The axe.‘

(10) Speaker A: i-amɯ-t 1SG-pet-POSS ‗Bring my pet!‘

enep-ko bring-IMP

Speaker B: nok what.AN ‗Which (animate) one?‘

Speaker A: wokori dog ‗The dog.‘

‗A: Bring my pet! B: Which one? A: The dog.‘

2.2 Nouns that are optionally inflected for possession A fairly small number of nouns (perhaps twenty-five in the corpus) are optionally
inflected for possession. In (11) seventeen of these nouns are listed; most of them refer to man-made items. In addition to the possessor prefix that occurs on the possessed form, there is a suffix indicating that the object is possessed. The possessed forms are in the third column.

(11) a. ‗manioc bread‘ b. ‗mortar‘ c. ‗fireplace, firewood‘ d. ‗bead‘ e. ‗canoe‘ f. ‗bench‘ g. ‗bag‘ h. ‗basket‘ i. ‗knife‘

2.3 Inherently possessed noun roots Inherently possessed noun roots include terms for kinship, body parts, feelings, some
personal items, some generic terms, and some locatives. These nouns are always inflected, either to indicate the possessor or the absence of a possessor. The form without a possessor is referred to here as the absolute form. (More details about the absolute form are given in section 3.2.)
I claim that all inherently possessed nouns have two affixes (section 2.3.1). One is a prefix (sometimes null, sometimes fusing with the root, as discussed in section 3.1) that indicates the person of the possessor. The other is a suffix (null for some nouns) that indicates that the noun is possessed. The inherently possessed nouns can be grouped into six different classes based on the allomorphs of the possessive suffixes. (See section 3.3 for more details.) 2.3.1 The forms of the inherently possessed nouns
The inherently possessed noun paradigm consists of up to seventeen forms (some nouns have less), as illustrated in (12) by the paradigm for √etʃit ‗house‘.21 (NP represents any noun phrase, name, demonstrative pronoun, or the first person exclusive pronoun; the latter functions like an NP in various ways.

The forms in (12a-i) are the forms that show inflection for a possessor. Plurality is indicated by a suffix. First person inclusive without the plural suffix has an interpretation of dual, while with the plural suffix it has a plural interpretation that must include more than two.

22 Here the second person possessor morpheme o- and the initial vowel e of the stem coalesce to become the high front vowel i: o-+√e → i. More details about this are found in Appendix A.
23 Here the vowel of the reflexive prefix tɯ- and the initial vowel e of the stem coalesce with the initial root vowel e: tɯ-+√e → to. See Appendix A.

An inherently possessed noun typically has a distinct form that is used when an explicit NP possessor is present, although this is not evident from the example shown in (12j). This form is discussed in detail in section 3.1.3.
An inherently possessed noun also has an absolute form, which means that it is marked and interpreted as unpossessed, as shown in (12k). More details about the absolute form are presented in section 3.2.
These nouns, as well as unpossessed nouns, can be marked for case. More details about case forms are given in Chapter 4.
Another item of interest concerning inherently possessed nouns is that almost all of the vowel-initial noun roots begin with a or e. At this point in time the corpus contains only twelve words beginning with other vowels: one with o, two with u, and nine with i. These twelve words are all inflected with the set of prefixes used for consonant-initial roots. Details about these irregular forms are presented in section 3.1.6. 2.3.2 Kinship noun roots
The kinship terms in the corpus are illustrated by the forms in (14)-(18), cited in the third person singular possessor form. With the exception of the vocative forms, all kinship terms are inflected for possession.24 Some of them are used only by women and some only by men. The kinship terms in (14)-(18) are grouped according to the allomorph of the possessive suffix that they take. (See section 3.3 for more details).
24 The vocative forms are usually very different from the non-vocative forms. For example, the vocative for ‗uncle‘ is koko while the possessed form is a-wo-n (3-uncle-POSS)‗his/her uncle‘; the vocative for ‗sister‘ is tʃelɯ while the possessed form is -enaru-t (3-sister.ME-POSS)‗his sister‘; and the vocative for ‗brother (FE)‘ is muni while the possessed form is i-bi-n (3-brother.FE-POSS) ‗her brother‘. For two very irregular nouns, the vocative and the first person possessed form are the same. These nouns are papa ‗dad‘, ‗my father‘, and jeme ‗mom‘, ‗my mother‘. See the paradigms in (23). Only a few kinship terms have an absolute form. I do not discuss them in this thesis.

25 The word edem is primarily used as ‗his/her/its guide (on a trail, a driver of a boat)‘ and is also used to mean ‗her husband‘.
26 The word imɯ is also used as a modifier meaning ‗big‘ as in paru imɯ (water big) ‗big river‘. It is also used as a noun to refer to the ‗thumb‘: imɯ ‗thumb‘.
27 The word io refers to the male sex: ‗her husband‘ or ‗its mate (male)‘. 28 The expressions for ‗his father-in-law‘ and ‗his mother-in-law‘ are simple phrases: i-bɯ-t i-mɯ- (3-wife-POSS 3-father-POSS) ‗his wife‘s father‘, and i-bɯ-t je- (3-wife-POSS 3.mother-POSS) ‗his wife‘s mother‘. The forms of the nouns are as expected by the general principles presented here. There are no expressions referring to a woman‘s father-in-law or mother-in-law. 29 The word iben is also used to refer to ‗her boyfriend‘. 30 The word amɯt is also used to refer to a pet: ‗his/her pet‘. 31 This word may also refer to the female mate of an animal. Another word for wife that is more polite is e-wene-no- (3-after-NMLZR-POSS) ‗his wife‘ that literally means ‗the one who goes after him‘ or ‗his follower‘. It is a noun derived from the postposition e-wene (3-after) plus a nominalization suffix -no. If one did not know it were a derived noun it would not make any difference since it inflects like the basic

When kinship term roots are inflected as nouns they must have the appropriate
possessive suffix, as shown in (20a), (21a) and (22a).
(20) a. i-bi-n 3-brother.FE-POSS ‗her brother‘

Lack of the possessive suffix makes (20b) and (21b) unacceptable. Furthermore, as

with any possessed noun (with two exceptions, i-mɯ- ‗his/her/its father‘ and i-mu-n

‗his son‘), the possessor prefix is required unless the kinship terms is immediately

preceded by a possessor NP. Examples (20c), (21c) and (22b) are unacceptable because

there is neither a possessor prefix as in (20a), (21a) and (22a) nor a possessor noun phrase

as in (20d), (21d) and (22c).

2.3.3 Body part terms and other part-whole terms

There are more than one hundred body part terms and related terms (such as body secretions) in the corpus.33 The examples below are grouped according to their possessive

suffix. I present the surface forms of the possessive suffixes. In addition, there are about

twenty words that refer to parts of whole items (branch of tree, leaf of tree, etc.) All of

them are inherently inflected for possession.

(26) a. b. c. d.

‗his/her/its hip‘ ‗his/her/its coccyx‘ ‗his/her/its knee‘ ‗his/her/its wrist‘ ‗his/her/its backbone‘

33 Body part terms have extended meanings for inanimate objects. For example, the noun i-mum-tʃi (3-head-POSS) ‗his/her/its head‘ is also used to refer to hammock loops and to the part of the yam that is used to plant. It can also be used with water, paru mumtʃi ‗lake‘ (literally ‗water‘s head‘). The noun i-ptʃi-n (3-shin-POSS) ‗his/her/its shin‘ is used to refer to the manioc stalk (kɯden bɯtʃin), to the central part of the palm tree leaf (kuarɯ bɯtʃin), and also to a table leg (moropi bɯtʃin). More details about the changes on the noun i-ptʃi-n are presented in section 3.1.3.
34 These nouns may appear to be vowel-final, but they are not. Compare the inflected form of ‗hand‘ with other forms in the following paradigm: -emia-rɯ (3-hand-POSS) ‗his/her/its hand‘; tomiat-ke (T.hand-ADJR) ‗having hand‘; and omiat- (ABST.hand-ABST) ‗hand‘. The root is √emiat. More details about these nouns are presented in section 3.3.

When the expected affixes are not present, the body part terms are ungrammatical, as shown in (33b) and (34b-d). The lack of the possessor prefix is possible only when the possessed noun is preceded by an overt noun phrase, as shown in (33c) and (34e). The

The words that refer to parts of items (such as ‗branch‘ and ‗leaf‘) do not have such

fully developed paradigms, at least in the corpus. (I do not know what would happen if a

tree in a story were to talk about its branches and leaves. Animals can talk in stories using

the expected sets of prefixes and suffixes on nouns.) Compare the several forms of the

paradigm for ‗house‘, which begins with a vowel, with the attested forms of the words for

‗branch‘ and ‗leaf‘.

Abstract nouns presenting feelings are also inherently possessed nouns. The only ones
that I have found in the corpus are presented in (36) using the first person possessor
forms. (36) a. ɯ-guri-n
1SG-anger-POSS ‗my anger‘ b. ɯ-moe-n 1SG-joy-POSS ‗my joy‘ c. ɯ-bomnu- 1SG-sadness-POSS ‗my sadness‘
d. i-apoel-u 1SG-belligerence-POSS ‗my belligerence‘
2.3.3.1 Details about the words ‘hand’ and ‘mouth’
The word for ‗hand‘ has two suppletive roots: √emiat and √amda. The stem √emiat
(which loses its final consonant under conditions discussed in Appendix A), is used to
form common inflected nouns. Examples are given in (37). (37) a. i-emia-rɯ
1SG-hand-POSS ‗my hand‘ b. omia-rɯ-ŋo ABST.hand-POSS-ABST ‗hand‘
The root √emiat can also be incorporated into the verb, as shown in (38).37 So far I
have only observed it incorporated with two verbs.
37 Noun incorporation is very productive in the language.
21

(38) a. k-od-emia-guruge-lɯ 1-REFL-hand-wash-REC ‗I washed my hands.‘
b. od-emiat-kod-ɯlɯ REFL-hand-cut-REC ‗He cut his own hand.‘
The other stem for ‗hand‘, √amda, cannot be inflected for possessor, nor can it occur
in the absolute form. (39) a. *i-amda-n
1SG-hand-POSS (‗my hand‘)
b. *omda ABST.hand (‗hand‘)
However, this stem can be part of an inflected compound noun (see Chapter 6), as shown
in (40).38 (40) a. i-amda-boi-
1SG-hand-shirt-POSS ‗my glove‘
b. i-amda-gua-n 1SG-hand-?-POSS ‗my palm‘
The root √amda can also be used in coumpound forms and situations with incorporation
(including with the same verb that √emiat can be incorporated with), as shown in (41). (41) a. t-amda-ku-t39
T-hand-black-ADJR ‗having blackened hand‘, ‗his/her hand is dirty (with something dark)‘
b. k-od-amda-guruge-lɯ 1-REFL-hand-wash-REC ‗I washed my hands.‘
38 The stem √amda can also be followed by a modifying suffix, as discussed in section 6.2. Example: t-amda-pa (T-hand-flat) ‗flat handed‘.
39 In his description of Tiriyó, Meira (1999:358) glosses this prefix with a capital ‗T‘; I follow that
22

The word for ‗mouth‘ also has two suppletive stems: √la, and √mda. The stem √la is
inflected for a possessor prefix and a possessive suffix, as shown in (42).
(42) a. ɯ-la-tʃi 1SG-mouth-POSS ‗my mouth‘
b. o-la-tʃi 2-mouth-POSS ‗your mouth‘

The root √mda is used instead of √la when the word is inflected for the inessive case,

as shown in (43).
(43) a. ɯ-mda-am 1SG-mouth-INE ‗in my mouth‘

b. odɯ o-mda-am what.IN 2-mouth-INE ‗What do you have in your mouth?‘

2.3.4 Personal items

Some personal item words cannot be inflected for possession, as shown in

section 2.1; some may be inflected, as shown in (section 2.2); but the majority of them

must be inflected. Examples of these nouns are given (44)-(48), grouped by the

possessive suffix.

2.3.6 Locative

A few locative words are inflected for possessor. The ―possessor‖ in these cases has

nothing to do with the semantic notion of ―possess‖, but rather refers to the point of

reference that is expressed in English and Portuguese as the complement of a preposition.

A full discussion of the semantics of these nouns is beyond the scope of this thesis. These

are illustrated by the examples in (53), all given in the first person form.

‗on me‘ ‗behind me‘ ‗under me‘ ‗before me‘ ‗s/he/it is above me‘ ‗it is inside me‘ ‗in front of me‘

Although the locative nouns in (53) are inflected for possessor, they do not have possessive suffixes. However, they can be inflected for case suffixes. (More details about the case suffixes are included in Chapter 4.) Furthermore, the locative nouns do not have absolute forms.
A complete paradigm of one locative noun is provided in (54).

40 This word and the next are only found inflected with some other suffix, such as the inessive case in these particular examples. More details about the inessive suffix are in section 4.1.

‗under me‘ ‗under you‘ ‗under him/her/it‘ ‗under us (incl., dual)‘ ‗under himself/herself/itself‘ ‗under NP‘

prefix when an explicit location is not present, and they disallow the possessor prefix
when an explicit location is present, as shown in (55).

2.4 Derived inherently possessed noun stems There is a suffix -rɯn that appears on nouns, and it is used in two ways:
derivationally and inflectionally. 2.4.1 Derivational use of -rɯn
The suffix -rɯn occurs on nouns referring to plants, and in this situation it has a derivational use. The derived noun stems refer to the field (or garden) in which the plant is cultivated and not to the plant itself, as shown in (56)-(59). These derived noun stems are inherently possessed. (I do not know if they have absolute forms.) They do not take

26

any suffix after the morpheme -rɯn, although I do not know about plurals or the locative
case forms. (For details about the allomorphs, see Appendix A.) (56) a. womjum41
banana ‗cultivated banana‘
b. ɯ-womjum-ɯrɯn 1SG-banana-POSS ‗my banana field‘
(57) a. mitaum42 ‗coconut (sp.)‘
b. ɯ-mitaum-ɯrɯn 1SG-coconut.(sp.)-POSS ‗my coconut field‘
(58) a. karana ‗hemp‘
b. ɯ-karana-rɯn 1SG-hemp-POSS ‗my ―karana‖ field‘
(59) a. manan ‗yucca (sp.)‘
b. ɯ-mana-rɯn43 1SG-yucca.(sp.)-POSS ‗my ―manan‖ field‘
The nouns for ‗papaya‘ and ‗corn‘ have the absolute prefix marker o- when no
possessor is indicated, as shown in (60) and (61).
41 The word for ‗(cultivated) banana‘ is formed from wom ‗wild banana‘ plus the augmentative suffix -jum. More details about this are given in section 6.2.1.
42 The word for ‗coconut‘ looks like it might have the augmentative suffix -um, but the noun without the suffix -um (*mita) does not appear in the corpus.
43 Here the final consonant of the noun root is deleted before the suffix -rɯn.
27

(60) a.

o-kajamoum44 ABST-papaya ‗papaya‘

b. ɯ-kajamoum-ɯrɯn 1SG-papaya-POSS ‗my papaya field‘

c. (61) a.

i-kajamoum-ɯrɯn 3-papaya-POSS ‗his/her papaya field‘
o-nat ABST-corn ‗corn‘

b. ɯ-na-rɯ 1SG-corn-POSS ‗my cornfield‘

c. i-na-rɯ 3-corn-POSS ‗his/her cornfield‘

The derived noun for ‗sweet potato‘ makes some idiosyncratic changes, as shown in

(62). (62) a.

nabiot ‗sweet potato‘

b. ɯ-nobia-rɯn 1SG-sweet.potato-POSS ‗my sweet potato field‘

The noun for ‗rice‘ is a compound noun that includes the morphemes -bɯ-em, but the
derived noun with -ɯrɯn drops these morphemes, as shown in (63). (63) a. tɯretʃiŋ-bɯ-em
pasture-similar-NMLZR ‗rice‘
b. ɯ-tɯretʃiŋ-ɯrɯn 1SG-pasture-POSS ‗my rice field‘
44 The word okajamoum looks like it might have the augmentative suffix -um, but the noun without the suffix -um (*okayamo) does not appear in the corpus.
28

The derived noun for ‗yam field‘ has two possible forms. In both forms, the root has

an extra d that has no parallel anywhere else in the language. One form has the expected

suffix -rɯn, while the other has only -n. Speakers claim that both forms are possible and

mean the same.
(64) a. ɯpɯ ‗yam (sp.)‘

b. ɯ-dɯpɯ-rɯn 1SG-yam.(sp.)-POSS ‗my yam field‘

c. ɯ-dɯpɯ-n 1SG-yam-POSS ‗my yam field‘

2.4.2 Inflectional use of -rɯn

The inflectional use of the suffix -rɯn is analogous to the possessive case suffix

found on possessed nouns (see Chapter 4), and could be viewed as another suppletive

allomorph of the possessive suffix. Of the four examples in the corpus, three are

compound nouns, as shown in (65)-(67).

(65) a. pɯleptebɯem < ‗razor blade‘

pɯlepte-bɯ-em knife-similar-NMLZR

b. (66) a.

ɯ-bɯleptebɯem-ɯrɯn 1SG-razor.blade-POSS ‗my razor blade‘

tapedaum

<

‗box, poster

tapeda-um paper-AUG

b. ɯ-tapedaum-ɯrɯn 1SG-box/poster-POSS ‗my big paper‘

29

(67) a. bakkeni ‗hoe‘

< bak-ke-ni45 noise-do/make-NMLZR

b. ɯ-bakkeni-rɯn 1SG-hoe-POSS ‗my hoe‘

Note that in ‗razor blade‘ (65), the whole compound occurs in the possessed form; the
second half (bɯem) is not omitted, unlike in the case of ‗rice‘ in (63b).
One noun that gives no evidence of being a compound, but which, nevertheless, uses
the -rɯn suffix, is the word for ‗ball‘, as shown in (68). (68) a. panbak
‗ball‘
b. ɯ-banbag-ɯrɯn 1SG-ball-POSS ‗my ball‘

45Bak is an ideophone, and the voiced b is implosive. Implosives are common in ideophones or special words.

CHAPTER 3 MORPHOLOGY OF POSSESSED NOUNS
As shown in section 2.3, possessed nouns are morphologically complex, sometimes in ways that are obvious and sometimes in ways that are not. An overt possessor prefix appears on possessed nouns to show person and number of the possessor except in two situations, as explained in Chapter 2. The first situation is the null prefix for third person possessor that is used before vowel-initial roots, as shown in (69a). (69) a. -eŋna-n
3-nose-POSS ‗his/her/its nose‘ b. i-eŋna-n 1Sg-nose-POSS ‗my nose‘
The second situation in which no overt possessor prefix occurs is when an NP possessor appears before the possessed noun, as shown in (70b). (70) a. i-mum-tʃi
3-head-POSS ‗his/her/its head‘ b. NP mum-tʃi NP head-POSS ‗NP‘s head‘
Under certain conditions phonological fusion takes place, which makes the morphology a bit less transparent (see Appendix A). The present chapter looks at the morphology of the possessor prefix and possessive suffix.
31

3.1 Possessor

The Ugoroŋmo language distinguishes between five persons: first person singular,

second person, third person, first person inclusive, and first person exclusive. These, with

the exception of first person exclusive (see below), are marked as prefixes on nouns and

verbs, as in the related Hixkaryana language (Derbyshire 1985:8). Third person possessed

nouns appear in the third person reflexive form when the subject of the clause is

coreferential with the possessor.

All of these persons can be pluralized, with the exception of first person singular (but

see below for additional details). First person inclusive without the plural suffix has an

interpretation as dual  having exactly two in number  while with the plural suffix it has

a plural interpretation that must include more than two. The various combinations are

shown by the forms in (71).

ɯ-mum-tʃi

uŋ-mum-tʃi

uŋ-mum-tʃi-ŋmo

o-mum-tʃi

o-mum-tʃi-ŋmo

i-mum-tʃi

i-mum-tʃi-ŋmo

tɯ-mum-tʃi

‗my head‘ ‗our (incl., dual) heads‘ ‗our (incl., plural) heads‘ ‗your head‘ ‗your (pl.) heads‘ ‗his/her/its head‘ ‗their heads‘ ‗his/her/its own head‘ ‗their own heads‘

First person exclusive is expressed by an invariant free pronoun that functions like a
noun phrase preceding the possessed noun, requiring no agreement on the noun (see
section 3.1.7). This form does not change regardless of the number of people involved.
The plural suffix is not used with it, as shown in (72). See Chapter 5 for discussion of
plural marking and interpretation. (72) a. tʃimna mum-tʃi
1EXCL head-POSS ‗our (excl.) heads‘

32

b. *tʃimna mum-tʃi-ŋmo 1EXCL head-POSS-PL (‗our (excl.) heads‘)

c. *tʃimna-ŋmo mum-tʃi

1EXCL-PL

head-POSS

(‗our (excl.) heads‘)

The possessor prefixes often have different forms before consonants than before

vowels, as illustrated in (73). Some of these differences may be explained by

phonological rules, but some definitely are not. The illustrative paradigms in (73) do not

cover all of the complexities of possessor prefix allomorphs, however. In Appendix B, 52

complete paradigms of some possessed nouns are presented.

‗my shirt‘ ‗your shirt‘ ‗his/her shirt‘ ‗our (incl., dual) shirts‘ ‗his/her own shirt‘

Table 2 shows my proposals for the underlying forms of the possessor prefixes. Phonological rules sometimes insert a vowel, coalesce vowels, and affect voicing, as discussed below.

The morphemes shown in Table 2 are also used on verbs to show the person of one of the core grammatical relations. This thesis does not address those situations. In this section the different allomorphs of the possessor prefixes are discussed. Since these

33

morphemes also occur on verbs, a complete account of the allomorphs of these

morphemes would take verbs into consideration. However this is outside the scope of this thesis. It can be noted, however, that the basic facts about the distribution of the allomorphs in verbs are quite parallel to the distribution shown in the following sections.

3.1.1 First person singular possessor The first person singular possessor prefix is ɯ- before a consonant, and i- before

vowel-initial roots that begin with a or e, as shown in (74) and (75), respectively. The first person inclusive is also presented for comparison. Noun roots beginning with vowels other than a or e are discussed in section 3.1.6.

3.1.2 Second person possessor

The second person possessor prefix is a bit more complicated. It is o- before a

consonant, as shown in (76). (76) Second person possessor

a. o-bi-n b. o-kambo-rɯ c. o-la-tʃi d. o-mum-tʃi e. o-pu-n

‗brother (FE)‘ ‗firewood‘ ‗mouth‘ ‗head‘ ‗foot‘

Before roots that begin with the vowel a, the second person possessor prefix is u-.

(This does seem to be a vowel and not the approximant w- since it is phonetically longer

than one expects for an approximant.) I propose that this is handled by the phonological

rule of Vowel Raising (see Apppendix A). (77) Second person possessor

a. u-aba-rɯ b. u-aboi- c. u-aborim-uru d. u-amim-uru e. u-amoe-n

‗manioc bread‘ ‗shirt‘ ‗forearm‘ ‗stomach‘ ‗fingernail‘

With roots that are clearly e-initial (as shown by the first person singular inflection in the paradigm below), second person possessor is indicated by a change of the initial e to i. I account for this with a rule of Vowel Coalescence (see Appendix A). Underlying o+e becomes i.

Noun roots beginning with vowels other than a or e are discussed in section 3.1.6 below. 3.1.3 Third person possessor
The third person prefix has four suppletive allomorphs: i-, a-, e- and -. The most common, and presumably the default marker, before consonant-initial roots (including some that are w-initial) is i-, as shown in (79). These explicitly marked forms are compared there with the form that occurs when the possessor noun phrase is overtly present.

Before several w-initial roots, the prefix is a- and before several w-initial roots it is e-,

as seen in (80) and (81).

Before the vowels a and e, with the exception of the cases discussed in section 3.1.6,

the prefix is -, as shown in (82).

NP aboi NP edet NP amoen NP aro NP etʃit

As mentioned in section 2.3.2, a possessed noun may occur with or without an

explicit noun phrase. When an overt noun phrase occurs, the noun is not inflected for

possessor, as shown in (83) and (84).
(83) a. i-lu- 3-tongue-POSS ‗his/her/its tongue‘
b. wakat lu- crocodile tongue-POSS ‗the crocodile‘s tongue‘
c. *wakat i-lu-
(84) a. i-mɯŋu-ru 3-blood-POSS ‗his/her/its blood‘
b. NP mɯŋu-ru NP blood-POSS ‗NP‘s blood‘
c. *NP i-mɯŋu-ru

However, two kinship terms are exceptions to this pattern, as shown in (85) and (86). In these cases the possessor prefix occurs on these possessed nouns even when the noun

37

phrase is overtly present. Other kinship terms follow the regular pattern, as shown in (87)

and (88).
(85) a. i-mɯ- 3-father-POSS ‗his/her father‘
b. NP i-mɯ- NP 3-father-POSS ‗NP‘s father‘
c. *NP mɯ-

i-ru- 3-older.brother.ME-POSS ‗his older brother‘

b. NP ru- NP older.brother.ME-POSS ‗NP‘s older brother‘

c. *NP i-ru-

Since vowel-initial stems have null for third person possessor prefix, the form of the possessed noun is the same for these when they are preceded by a noun phrase, as shown in (89).

38

Sometimes there is a small phonological difference between the inflected stem and

the stem preceded by a noun phrase. One of these differences is the absence of the vowels

ɯ and u between the two initial consonants in the noun inflected for possessor. Examples

with the vowel ɯ are in (90), and examples with the vowel u are in (91). I assume that the

vowels ɯ and u of the forms preceded by the noun phrase are present in the underlying

form since the quality of the vowel does not appear to be predictable.

Once a vowel is deleted in the stem, predictable changes in voicing take place, as

illustrated in (90a-c). I. Souza (2010) proposes that a process of devoicing occurs. See

section A.3 of the Appendix A. Further phonological discussion is beyond the scope of

this thesis.

In two nouns, ‗partner‘ and ‗bag‘, the vowel ɯ in the underlying form is not deleted; it is changed to i when the noun is inflected for possessor.48 The vowel ɯ changes to i,

47 Obstruents are always voiceless when they occur in a sequence. I do not formalize here how this comes about.
48 This also happens with the nominalization of the word for ‗similar‘; compare NP bɯ-em (NP similar-NMLZR) ‗s/he/it is alike NP‘, and ibiem ‗s/he/it is alike her/him/it‘.
39

regardless of the vowel in the possessor prefix, as shown in (92). The form preceded by the noun phrase is the underlying form.

With the nouns for ‗field‘ and ‗thing‘, (93), there is an extra syllable tu that appears at

the beginning of the form preceded by a noun phrase. Note also that the k in the noun for

‗field‘ (93a) does not appear in the NP-possessed form. With the nouns for ‗egg‘ and

‗hair/fur‘ the extra syllable that appears is bu, (93c) and with the noun for ‗foot‘ it is gu,

as shown in (93d).

3.1.4 First person inclusive possessor

The first person inclusive prefix is ug-. The allomorphs are explained phonologically

by rules of devoicing, nazalization, and epenthesis. These allomorphs are shown in

(94)-(97). The proposed basic form appears before vowels, as shown in (94).

3.1.5 Third person reflexive possessor

The prefix for third person reflexive indicates that the possessor of the possessed

noun is co-referential with the subject of the clause in which the noun occurs, as shown in

(99)-(100).

The vowel of this prefix usually seems to fuse with the e of a root to become o, as

shown in (102). In the nouns there is one known exception where we see the o but also the e of the root, as shown in (103).49

49 The initial e remains on several verbs when the participle is made, for example: to-ep-te (?-arrivePART) ‗arrived‘, to-ige-t (?-stop-PART) ‗stopped‘, to-ebage-t (?-wake.up-PART) ‗waked up‘, to-ikpɯ-ne (?heal-PART) ‗healed‘, to-ip-te (?-bathe-PART) ‗bathed‘. There is no apparent phonological reason to delete
the initial vowel e or keep it. For example, the noun for ‗his/her/its medicine‘ is -eptɯ- (3-medicine-

3.1.6 Roots that begin with the vowels i, o and u

While most vowel-initial roots begin with e or a, twelve nouns begin with other

vowels (one with o, two with u, and nine with i), as shown in (105). The possessor

prefixes used with the latter are the same as those used with consonant-initial roots, see

t-eb-ɯlɯ (3-arrive-REC) and its participle form is to-ep-te (?-arrive-PART) ‗arrived‘. 50 In the denominal predicate adjective the noun for ‗rack‘ can have two possible forms: to-epkal-e
(T-rack-ADJR), and tɯ-epkal-e (T-rack-ADJR) ‗s/he has a rack‘. The last form is among the roots that have the vowel i in the underlying form, as shown in section 3.1.6.
51 This form might be i-itpɯ-n, but even this is not clear from the recording.

The root-initial vowel i usually appears when the noun is inflected for the first person

inclusive and third person. There are two exceptions. The noun for ‗husband‘ has the i

also when inflected for second person. And the noun for ‗bone‘ has the i in all of its

forms.

3.1.7 The first person exclusive pronoun

The first person exclusive morpheme tʃimna is a free pronoun that functions like a

third person singular nominal with respect to the syntax and morphology when it is a

possessor, as shown in (106). Plural marking is not possible, as illustrated in the

beginning of section 3.1.

44

(106) a. tʃimna emia-rɯ 1EXCL hand-POSS ‗our (excl.) hands‘
b. tʃimna bɯtʃi-n 1EXCL shin-POSS ‗our (excl.) shins‘
c. tʃimna eŋ-uru 1EXCL eye-POSS ‗our (excl.) eyes!‘

Recall that a possessed noun almost always has two different forms when the possessor is third person. It has one form when the possessor is an overt NP and immediately precedes the possessed noun, and it has another form when the possessor is not an overt NP. Furthermore, a few nouns have unusual changes between these two stems. See the data in (107).

The pronoun tʃimna acts like a simple NP with respect to this pattern, and determines

the possessed noun form as an NP possessor does, as shown in (108).

45

Although tʃimna is not a prefix, it has a fixed position before the noun or the verb.

The difference between tʃimna and a prefix is that tʃimna can occur alone as an answer

whereas a prefix cannot, as illustrated in (109).

3.2 Absolute form Nearly all inherently possessed noun roots can be inflected in a way to indicate that
no possessor is relevant, as shown in (110).52 I refer to this form as the absolute form.53 The possessed form is also presented for comparison.

52 Only the possessor is obligatorily not expressed. The majority of the nouns also do not have the possessive suffix expressed on the absolute form but some nouns, for a reason that I do not know, keep the possessive suffix, as shown in section 3.2.1.
53 These affixes are called ―depossession‖ in Derbyshire‘s (1985: 203) description of Hixkaryana, a related language.
46

-mɯdabiri-ŋo i-mdabiri- -worondu-ŋo a-worond-u -wogɯrɯ-ŋo a-wog-ɯrɯ

The absolute form is characterized by two affixes: a prefix and a suffix. Some nouns

are inflected with both affixes. In some nouns only the prefix is used, and in some only

the suffix is used. More details about these affixes are given in section 3.2.1. The

possessed form is also presented for comparison.

A few nouns have an unpossessed form that is apparently simple; this form is

analogous to the Absolute form but is different in that it has no morphology.

The noun in the absolute form sometimes has a more generic meaning than the

possessed noun, as shown in (112).

A noun in its absolute form cannot be the head of a genitive construction. Only
inflected nouns can occupy this position, as shown in (113c) and (114c).

c. NP la-tʃi NP mouth-POSS ‗NP‘s mouth‘

d. *NP latʃiŋo (‗NP‘s mouth‘)

3.2.1 Morphology of the absolute form

As shown by the examples in (110) above, absolute morphology is indicated by a

variety of combinations of prefixes and suffixes. The great majority of the absolute nouns

end in the suffix –ŋo; this is the most important, consistent indicator of the absolute form.

Consonant-initial stems have no overt prefix; I posit a null prefix for these because of

what happens with vowell-initial stems. In the typical vowel-initial stems, the vowels a

and e are replaced by o. It is unclear what the underlying form of this prefix might be. It

is unlikely to be o- because the second person possessor is o- and that prefix interacts

very differently with the stem, as shown in section 3.1.2 above.

When a consonant-initial root is inflected in the absolute form, the initial consonant

my devoice by the expected rules (see Progressive Devoicing rule in Appendix A), as

shown in (115) and (116).

b. NP bɯtʃi-n NP shin-POSS ‗NP‘s shin‘
c. pɯtʃi-ŋo shin-ABST ‗shin‘

All inherently possessed nouns have a suffix which marks the possessive, as shown in section 3.3 below. Though the reason is unknown at this point, some nouns keep the possessive suffixes -uru, -ɯrɯ or -tʃi in the absolute form; compare (117) with (118).

-aborim-uru54 -akpum-ɯrɯ -erem-ɯrɯ -eŋ-uru i-la-tʃi i-mum-tʃi i-waka-tʃi

54 The possessive suffix on these nouns occurs in the absolute form. The possessive suffix does not occur in some constructions such as noun incorporation, compound nouns and modifying suffixes. The noun -aborim-uru (3-arm-POSS)‗his/her/its forearm‘ does not have an absolute form without the suffix -uru as some nouns do, for example, the noun i-ptʃig-uru (3-diarrhea-POSS) ‗his/her/its diarrhea‘ has two absolute forms: pɯtʃik and pɯtʃig-uru-ŋo (diarrhea-POSS-ABST). When the noun aborimuru is incorporated it does not have the suffix -uru: t-aborim-got-te (T-arm-cut-PART)‗his/her/its forearm is cut‘. The same happens to -eŋ-uru (3-eye-POSS) ‗his/her/its eye‘. In a compound noun -eŋ-bi-pu-t (3-eye-skin-hair-POSS) ‗his/her eyebrow‘ the suffix -uru does not occur.

Seven noun roots have two absolute forms. Both are used and there does not seem to

expected. The two forms differ in the suffixes; one form has no suffix at all and the other

has the Absolute suffix as well as the Possessive suffix (in most of them).

3.3 Possessive suffixes

All inherently possessed nouns have a possessive suffix when inflected for

possession. The allomorphy displayed by the suffixes suggests that there are six formatives involved: -n, -, -t, -tʃi, -ru and -rɯ.55 Their distribution is not predictable and

so six arbitrary classes of nouns must be posited.

The formatives –n, - and -t all occur after vowels, as shown in (120), (121) and

(122).

‗shirt‘ ‗lung‘ ‗skin, shell‘ ‗tongue‘ ‗older brother (ME)‘
‗rib‘ ‗wife‘ ‗name‘ ‗house‘ ‗fat‘

The allomorph -tʃi is a very uncommon formative; it occurs only with the roots shown in (123).

55 The formative -n is the most used. In a corpus of 295 inherently possessed nouns –n occurs 103
(35%), - occurs with 51 (17%), –ru occurs with 51, -rɯ with 49; -t with 33 (11%), and tʃi with 8 (3%).
56 The formative –t acts in two different ways. With some inflections it is replaced and with some it is not. For example, etʃit ‗his/her house‘ when in the absolute form otʃi-ŋo (ABST.house-ABST) ‗house‘, t is not present; when pluralized -etʃi-t-kom (3-house-POSS-PL) ‗their house‘, t is present; i-bɯ-t ‗his wife‘ can be inflected with two plural suffixes, in one the t remains and in the other the t does not: i-bɯ-t-kom (3wife-POSS-PL) ‗their wife‘ and i-bɯ-am (3-wife-PL) ‗his wives‘.

‗face‘ ‗heel‘ ‗shotgun‘ ‗shoulder‘ ‗mouth‘ ‗arm‘ ‗head‘ ‗buttock‘

The formatives -ru and -rɯ begin with r and end with a back vowel, but they seem to be unrelated forms since the vowel quality is not predicatable. Both occur with vowelfinal roots as well as consonant-final roots, and both have allomorphs with an epenthetic vowel identical to the vowel of the suffix, and both have allomorphs in which the r has been deleted. A root-final coronal obstruent deletes before a r-initial suffix.
For the sake of comparison, these two formatives are presented in parallel fashion below.

Since there does not seem to be any phonological basis for the distribution of the formatives, we might look for other factors. But there also seems to be no semantic basis for the distribution. The choice of suffixes does not depend on the semantic category of the noun.59 For example, the words for ‗son‘ and ‗daughter‘ have the same suffix as some

59 The same happens to Apalai, a related language. ―...the choice of suffix depends on each lexical item‖, Koehn (1994:41).

Of the six formatives, -n occurs with the greatest number of roots in native Ugoroŋmo

vocabulary. It is also the formative used on words borrowed from Portuguese, as shown

in (129). (The phonetic facts of the Portuguese facts are not discussed here; the only point

of discussion is the use of the formative -n.)

CHAPTER 4 CASE MARKING

The Ugoroŋmo language does not have any marker inside the noun phrase, whether a

postpositional element or case marking on any word in the noun phrase, to indicate a

major grammatical function in the clause (such as subject, ergative, absolutive, or direct object).60 The major grammatical relations are indicated by pronominal agreement marking on the verb and by word order, as shown in (130).61 Only the basic word order is

presented in these examples, however.

‗I washed my good/beautiful shirt.‘

60 In Kuikuro, a related language, the postposition heke is used to mark the ergative case (Santos 2007:31). No morpheme like this exists in Ugoroŋmo.
61 The pronominal agreement system on the verb involves two main sets of morphemes: absolutive and ergative. The absolutive set marks the subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb, while the subject of a transitive verb is marked by the ergative set.
62 When the object is not overtly expressed, the prefix t- occurs on the verb √udu indicating the pronominal object: t-udu-lɯ papa koko wɯna (3O-give-REC 1SG.father 1SG.uncle to) ‗my father gave it to my uncle.‘ This marker does not occur on most verbs.

Certain nominals other than subject and direct object are marked by postpositions, as shown in (131a-d). These postpositions inflect for person to agree with their complement. Parallel to the situation with possessed nouns shown in Chapter 3, third person forms are different when the complement is an overt NP, as shown in (131e).

Furthermore, the language has five case suffixes that occur on some nouns and on some locative words.63 Four of them are related to location (inessive, illative, elative and

perlative) and one is comparative. These are presented in the following subsections.

These suffixes do not occur on names nor on pronouns. Furthermore, some nouns and some locative words use another small word to carry the locative case suffixes.64

63 Locative words are not discussed here. 64 Some nouns that refer to liquids such as paru ‗river, water‘ need the word gu ‗liquid‘ to carry the case suffix, for example: paru gu-am (river/water liquid-INE) ‗inside the river/water‘, paru gu-aktʃi (river/water liquid-ILL) ‗into the river/water‘, paru gu-andubo (river/water liquid-ELA) ‗from the river/water‘, paru gu-e (river/water liquid-PERL) ‗through the river/water‘. Some nouns that refer to plants, animals or people use the word du ‗location‘ to carry the case suffix; for example, womjum du-am (banana location-INE) ‗in the (field of) banana‘, womjum du-aktʃi (banana location-ILL) ‗into the (field) banana‘,
56

4.1 The inessive case suffix

The term inessive refers ―to a type of inflection which expresses the meaning of

location or position within a place‖ (Crystal, 2003:232). An example with a noun

inflected for inessive case in Ugoroŋmo is given in (132).

(132)

ogoro tʃimna kun-idaŋ tuktu-am jaguar 1EXCL 3REM-hear field-INE ‗We (excl.) heard the jaguar in the field.‘ (Ogoro, line 2)

There are three inessive formatives: -am, -tam and -p. The formative -p is found only on two nouns (see (133l-m)); the formative –tam on perhaps only two, after consonants (133j-k); the formative –am is the regular one, after vowels. When the inessive suffix is added, small phonological changes may occur, some of which are regular and some of which are not.

abiana du-am (peccary location-INE) ‗among the peccaries‘. With the noun tʃitʃi ‗sun‘ the small word required is ŋu ‗sunny.location‘: tʃitʃi ŋu-am (sun sunny.location-INE) ‗in the sunlight‘. Some locative words
use the word na ‗location‘: kuronbo n-aktʃi -ɯdo-naŋɯrɯ (outside location-ILL 3-go-Prog) ‗s/he/it is going towards the outside‘, iɯi womno n-aktʃi -ɯdo-lɯ (wood underneath location-ILL 3-go-REC) ‗s/he/it
went towards the underside of the wood.‘ 65 All instances of o become u before a at morpheme boundaries. See Appendix A. 66 A root-final vowel is deleted in many of these words. I have not studied the conditions under which
this happens. 67 In kambot there is a deletion of the final t, and the vowel o changes to u with all the suffix cases. 68 The noun ietʃit ‗my house‘ when inflected in the inessive, illative and elative cases has more
57

k. ‗his/her/its head‘ i-mum-tʃi i-mum-dam ‗on his/her head‘

l. ‗hammock‘ (Abst.) oduat-

m. ‗its shore‘

-etpa-n

odua-p -etpa-p

‗in the hammock‘ ‗on its shore‘

As illustrated in (133h-i and k) the possessive suffix is replaced by the inessive case,

except the possessive suffix of the noun for ‗house‘.

4.2 The illative case suffix

The term illative refers ―to a type of inflection which expresses the meaning of

‗motion into‘ or ‗direction towards‘ a place‖ (Crystal, 2003: 226), as shown in (134).

(134)

tuktu-aktʃi -ɯdo-lɯ papa

field-ILL

3-go-REC 1SG.father

‗My father went towards the field.‘

As with the inessive suffix, when the illative suffix is added to a noun root small phonological changes may occur. With possessed nouns, the possessive suffix is replaced with the illative case.

(135)

Noun without case

tuktu-aktʃi ‗towards the field‘

b. ‗basket‘

c. ‗firewood‘

kambot kambu-aktʃi ‗towards the firewood‘

d. ‗hammock‘ (Abst.) oduat- odu-aktʃi

‗towards the hammock‘

e. ‗path‘ (Abst.)

onma- onm-aktʃi ‗towards the path‘

h. ‗my house‘

i-etʃi-t

‗towards my house‘

i. ‗his/her/its head‘ i-mum-tʃi i-mum-daktʃi ‗towards his/her/its

head‘

Illative case is expressed by two formatives, -taktʃi and -aktʃi, the distribution of

which is not predictable. The formative -taktʃi occurs with very few nouns; the initial

complications. The initial stem vowel is deleted, and the possessor prefix does not appear; for example: tʃi-t-tam (1SG.house-POSS-INE) ‗in my house‘ or ‗in our (incl.) house‘, tʃi-t-taktʃi (1SG.house-POSS-ILL) ‗into my house‘, tʃi-t-tandubo (1SG.house-POSS-ELA) ‗from my house‘.
58

consonant voices in predictable situations. The formative -aktʃi occurs with most nouns, some of which end with a consonant in their basic form; this consonant is deleted unexpectedly whenever a case suffix follows the noun.

4.3 The elative case suffix

The term elative refers ―to a type of inflection which expresses the meaning of motion

‗away from (inside)‘ a place‖ (Crystal, 2003:153), as shown in (136).

(136)

marak t-eb-ɯlɯ

idu-andubo ...

cockroach 3-arrive-REC forest-ELA

‗The cockroach arrived from the forest ...‘ (Marak 2, line 1)

Parallel to the previous cases, inessive and illative, when the elative suffix is added to a noun root some phonological changes may occur, as shown (137).

(137)
a. ‗forest‘ b. ‗field‘ c. ‗hand‘ (Abst.) d. ‗its shore‘ e. ‗my house‘

Noun without case idua tukto omiat- -etpa-n i-etʃi-t

Elative case

idu-andubo tuktu-andubo omi-andubo etp-andubo tʃi-tandubo

‗from the forest‘ ‗from the field‘ ‗from the hand‘ ‗from the shore‘ ‗from my house‘

Elative case is expressed by two formatives, -tandubo and -andubo. The distribution

of the first one is after consonant; and -andubo, primarily, after vowel.

4.4 The perlative case suffix
The suffix perlative suffix has the meaning ‗through‘, ‗across‘, ‗along‘ or ‗throughout‘, as shown in (138).69 (138) a. tuktu-ako i-aba-naŋɯrɯ
field-PERL 1-pass-PROG ‗I was passing through the field‘
69 There is another suffix -e which is similar to -tako but I have found its use only with locative words. For example: otʃi-ŋo bod-e pɯgɯrimam-be (ABST.house-ABST inside-PERL dirty-PRED) ‗It is dirty throughout the house.‘ Locative words are not part of the scope of this thesis.

Examples with the small phonological changes that occur with this suffix are provided in (139).

‗across the field‘ ‗throughout my back‘ ‗along its shore‘ ‗throughout my forehead‘ ‗throughout your shoulder‘ ‗throughout my house‘

The perlative case has two formatives, -tako and -ako. The formative -tako occurs

after consonant, as in (139f); and -ako occurs after vowel, as in (139a-e).

4.5 Comparative case suffix

The comparative suffix is used on the object of comparison when two items are being

compared, as shown in (140). I have found the comparative suffix only with possessed

nouns.70

(140) a.

o-bɯlepte-n

i-bɯlepte-k

2-knife-POSS

3-knife-COMP

‗your knife is like his/her knife‘

b. -amoe-n

i-amoe-k

3-fingernail-POSS 1SG-fingernail-COMP

‗her/his fingernail is like mine‘

70 The comparative suffix is not used on names. If one wants to say, for example, ‗Podat is taller than Mune‘ a separate word is used: podat mune umba-p (Podat Mune tall-PRED) ‗Podat is taller than Mune‘. If one wants to say ‗Podat is like Mune‘ the word banop ‗alike‘ is used: podat mune banop (Podat Mune alike) ‗Podat and Mune are alike.‘
60

c. mouko eŋ-uru -emtʃi-n

eŋ-uru-ŋ

Mouko eye-POSS 3-daughter-POSS eye-POSS-COMP

‗Mouko‘s eyes are like his daughter‘s eyes.‘

The comparative formatives are -k, and -ŋ. In chapter 3.3 the nouns were divided into six classes based on the possessive formative they take: -n, -t, -rɯ, -, -ru, and -tʃi. The comparative formative -k is the most widely used, and occurs with all of the nouns in the -n and -t classes as well as some of those in the -rɯ class, as shown in (141). When a noun is inflected with the suffix -k, the possessive suffix is not present.

‗like my knife‘ ‗like my ear‘ ‗like my tooth‘ ‗like my fingernail‘ ‗like my tool‘ ‗like my hair‘ ‗like my house‘ ‗like my hand‘ ‗like my breast‘

The comparative formative -k has the allomorph -ke after consonants, as in (141h-i).

The comparative formative -ŋ occurs with the other nouns (a relatively small group), as shown in (142).71 The possessive suffix remains on the nouns when they are inflected

with the comparative formative –ŋ.

(142)

Noun

a. ‗my lip‘

ɯ-mum-tʃi

ɯ-bo-rɯ-ŋ i-apoel-u-ŋ i-eŋ-uru-ŋ ɯ-la-tʃi-ŋ ɯ-mum-tʃi-ŋ

‗like my lips‘ ‗like my belligerence‘ ‗like my eye‘ ‗like my mouth‘ ‗like my head‘

71 I did not find any noun which the possessive suffix is null with the comparative suffix. So it is not possible to say which comparative suffix would be used with those forms.
61

Another way to compare two things that are alike is using the reflexive prefix ot-

(which is most commonly used on verbs) with the comparative suffix, as shown in (144).

(143) a. ot-pana-k

tʃimna

REFL-ear-COMP 1EXCL

‗Our (excl.) ears are alike.‘

b. ot-pana-k

ugoro

REFL-ear-COMP 1INCL

‗Our (incl.) ears are alike.‘

Some additional forms are given in (144).

(144) a. b. c. d. e.

‗house‘ ‗hand‘ ‗hair‘ ‗tooth‘ ‗fingernail‘

‗his/her/its ...‘ -etʃi-t -emia-rɯ i-retpu-t i-e-n -amoe-n

‗their (two) houses are alike‘ ‗their (two) hands are alike‘ ‗they (two) have similar hair‘ ‗their teeth are alike‘ ‗their (two) fingernails are alike‘

72 The reflexive has three allomorphs: ot-, od-, and otʃ-. The allomorph ot- occurs before a voiceless consonant, otʃ- occurs before the vowel i, and od- before the other vowels.
62

CHAPTER 5 PLURAL
In this chapter I discuss only the plural suffixes that occur on nouns. Three formatives indicate something about plurality: -am, -kom, and –ŋmo. The latter two could be considered suppletive allomorphs of the same suffix because of their distribution. Therefore I refer to two suffixes in this chapter: the –am suffix and the –kom suffix. These morphemes have very specific uses and interpretations that are explained in this chapter. In section 5.1 I show the basic uses of the plural suffix -kom, and in section 5.2 I discuss the more complicated scenario of indicating plurality on possessed nouns, a topic that includes the plural suffix -am.
5.1 Basic uses of the plural suffix -kom Caribanists describing similar suffixes in languages of the same linguistic family use
the term ―collective‖ rather than ―plural‖ because in some structures the meaning is more than simple plurality. For instance, the suffix -kom gives the idea of a group when used on names or kinship terms. Rather than referring to more than one person with the same name, -kom on a name refers to a group of people accompanying the person whose name is being used, or a group of the same age, classmates, coworkers, or people from the same house, etc., as shown in (145).73
73 No one in the village has the same name as another person there. Names are given according to something that happened during the mother‘s pregnancy. A name only can be reused after the name‘s ‗owner‘ is dead, and even then after a generation or more has passed (I. Souza, In progress)
63

This collective meaning is possible only when the plural suffix is attached to a name. In the examples in (146) and (147), simple plurality is explicitly indicated. (The distribution of the allomorphs is described below.)

74 In this thesis I have avoided using the names of living people. The names I use are fictitious but are similar phonologically to real names.
75 Note that the postposition abu is in its plural form; the singular is ak. The postposition is in agreement with jeme, the kinship term with the plural suffix-ŋmo.
64

The formative -kom occurs after consonants, while the formative -ŋmo occurs after vowels, as in (146) and (147).76
5.2 The structure of a word inflected for plural The situation is more complicated when the pluralized noun is a possessed noun.
When used on inflected nouns, a plural suffix has three possible interpretations: 1) indicating a plural possessor (section 5.2.1); 2) indicating a plural possessed item (section 5.2.2); or 3) indicating that both the possessor and the possessed item are pluralized (section 5.2.3). As shown below, -kom (or its suppletive allomorph -ŋmo) is used in the first situation and -am is used in the second. In the third situation, some nouns can have both suffixes -kom and -am indicating that the possessor as well as the possessed item are pluralized. And, some nouns have only one plural suffix yet have two interpretations – the possessor or the possessed item is pluralized – according to the context. 5.2.1 The possessor is plural
On the majority of possessed nouns, the plural suffix -kom (including its suppletive allomorph -ŋmo) unambiguously indicates that the possessor of the possessed noun is plural. It does not directly indicate plurality of the possessed item, as shown in (148). This subsection deals only with examples where the possessed item is singular and the possessor is plural.
76 The suffix -ŋmo is also used on verbs when they are inflected for recent past and continuous. These two suffixes -ɯlɯ and -ɯrɯ end with a vowel, as in: t-eb-ɯlɯ-ŋmo (3-arrive-REC-PL) ‗they arrived‘, -eneŋ-ɯrɯ-ŋmo (3-see-REC-PL) ‗they saw it/her/him‘. The suffix -kom is used after the nominalizer -tobot: t-ep-tobot-kom enem-bɯra uro (3-arrive-NMLZR-PL see-NEG I) ‗I did not see their arrival‘.

77 The noun for ‗wife‘ when inflected with the plural suffix gives the idea of a promiscuous woman. 78 In the Ugoroŋmo culture they believe that a baby is formed after having sexual intercourse several times. So, if a woman had relations with more than one man, the child can be referred to as having more than one biological father. 79 This term is used when a person does not know a child‘s name. So the person refers to the child as their (mother and grandmother‘s) child.

With a few nouns, including those for ‗house‘ and ‗medicine‘, the explicit marking of

plurality of the possessor (with -kom) may be interpreted as implying the plurality of the

possessed item as well as the possessor, as shown in (149). These plural forms are

ambiguos.

(149)a. ug-etʃi-t 1INCL-house-PL ‗our (dual) house‘

ug-etʃit-kom 1INCL-house-PL ‗our (incl.) house(s)‘

b. -etʃi-t 3-house-POSS ‗his/her house‘

-etʃi-t-kom 3-house-POSS-PL ‗their house(s)‘

c. itʃi-t 2.house-POSS ‗your house‘

itʃi-t-kom 2.house-POSS-PL ‗your (plural) house(s)‘

d. iptɯ- 2.medicine-POSS ‗your medicine(s)‘

iptɯ-ŋmo 2.medicine-PL ‗your (plural) medicine(s)‘

With body part terms and the nouns for ‗word‘, ‗bowl‘ and ‗shirt‘, the presence of the

plural suffix -kom (or its suppletive allomorph -ŋmo) indicates a plural possessor, as

expected, but the possessed noun is also interpreted as plural, for pragmatic reasons in

most of these cases, as shown in (150).

(150) a.

o-pu-n-gom 2-foot-POSS-PL ‗your (plural) feet‘ (*your (sg.) feet)

b. o-e-n-gom 2-tooth-POSS-PL ‗your (plural) teeth‘ (*your (sg.) teeth)
c. o-worond-u-ŋmo 2-word-POSS-PL ‗your (plural) words‘ (*your (sg.) words)

e. u-aboi-ŋmo 2-shirt-PL ‗your (plural) shirts‘ (*your (sg.) shirts)
These same nouns, when not occurring with a plural possessor can have singular or
plural interpretations, as shown in (151) and (152).
(151) a. ɯ-worond-u 1SG-word-POSS ‗my word(s)‘
b. o-worond-u 2-word-POSS ‗your word(s)‘

d. NP bugu-n NP foot-POSS ‗NP‘s foot/feet‘

5.2.2 The possessed item is pluralized
When the possessed item is plural, the suffix -am typically occurs, as shown in (153)
and (154). (Some complications are discussed in section 5.2.3.) This suffix does not
occur on names nor on unpossessed nouns. When the suffix -am occurs, the possessive
suffix does not occur.
(153) a. i-bɯ-t 3-wife-POSS ‗his wife‘
b. i-bɯ-am 3-wife-PL ‗his wives‘ (*their wife, *their wives)
(154) a. -amɯ-t 3-pet-POSS ‗his/her pet‘
b. -amɯ-am 3-pet-PL ‗his/her pets‘ (*their pet, *their pets)

With nouns that use the null or –n formatives of the possessive, a ―linking‖ suffix is used between the noun root and plural suffix. The linking suffix is -neŋg except with the root √mano, for which it is –bi. See (155).

(155)a. i-mano- 3-younger.brother.ME-POSS ‗his younger brother‘

i-mano-bi-am 3-y.brother.ME-LNKR-PL ‗his younger brothers‘ (*their younger brother)

b. i-ru- 3-older.brother.ME-POSS ‗his older brother‘

i-ru-neŋg-am 3-older.brother.ME-LNKR-PL ‗his older brothers‘ (*their older brother)

c. -edem- 3-husband-POSS ‗her husband‘

-edem-neŋg-am 3-husband-LNKR-PL ‗her husbands‘ (*their husbands)

69

d. i-bi-n 3-brother.FE-POSS ‗her brother‘

i-bi-neŋg-am 3-brother-LNKR-PL ‗her brothers‘ (*their brothers)

e. -emtʃi-n 3-daughter.ME-POSS ‗his daughter‘

-emtʃi-neŋg-am 3-daughter.ME-LNKR-PL ‗his daughters‘ (*their daughter)

f. i-mu-n 3-son.ME-POSS ‗his son‘

i-mu-neŋg-am 3-son.ME-LNKR-PL ‗his sons‘ (*their sons)

While the suffix -am typically indicates plurality of the possessed item, the noun for ‗friend/relative‘ is irregular.80 See the data in (156).

(156)a. i-ebɯ- 1SG-friend/relative-POSS ‗my friend/relative‘

Plural possessor no

b. i-ebɯ-ŋmo (*i-ebɯ-am) no 1SG-friend/relative-PL ‗my friends/relatives‘

c. ibɯ-ŋmo

e. -ebɯ-neŋg-am 3-friend/relative-LNKR-PL ‗his/her friends/relatives‘ ‗their friends/relatives‘

ambiguous

Plural item no yes ambiguous
no yes

80 This also happens with the noun for ‗child‘ ɯ-maraŋmo-ŋmo (1SG-child.FE-PL) ‗my children‘ but the paradigm for this noun is not available in the corpus. Only these two nouns in the corpus have the plural suffix -ŋmo with the first person singular.
70

5.2.3 Pluralizing both the possessor and possessed item

While some nouns have plurality of the item implied when the possessor is plural, as

shown in 5.2.1, in others it is possible and necessary to indicate plurality explicitly. In

these cases the plural suffix -am precedes the plural suffix -kom/-ŋmo, as shown in Table

3. Table 3 Plural suffixes marking the possessor and the possessed item

71

With the nouns for ‗husband‘ and ‗mother‘, the suffix -kom is used to pluralize the possessor and -am is used to pluralize both the possessor and possessed item, as shown in (157). Here the suffix -am does not give the possibility of pluralizing only the possessed item.

(157)a. idem- 2.husband-POSS ‗your husband‘

idem-gom 2.husband-PL ‗your (plural) husband‘

idem-neŋg-am 2.husband-LNKR-PL ‗your (plural) husbands‘ (*your (sg.) husbands)

And with the nouns for ‗friend/relative‘ and ‗partner‘, the suffix -ŋmo is used to

pluralize the possessor and -am has two interpretations, as shown in (158).

5.2.4 The suffix -am with the former suffix -tp

The suffix -am can occur after the suffix indicating ‗former‘ which comes right after

the noun root, as shown in (159).

CHAPTER 6 COMPOUND NOUNS AND MODIFYING SUFFIXES
In this chapter I discuss compound nouns and modifying suffixes. Compound nouns contrast with simple nouns in the way that they are formed from two or three noun roots. Both compound and simple nouns have only one possessor prefix and one possessive suffix that occur in the margins.81
The modifying suffixes are used to express some qualities such as augmentative, diminutive, long, flat, etc.82
6.1 Compound nouns Crystal (2003:92) defines a compound as a ―unit which is composed of elements that
function independently in other circumstances‖. In section 3.3 I showed that each possessed noun has only one possessor prefix and only one possessive suffix, and they come on the margins of the singular noun. In a compound noun, there is only one possessor prefix and one possessive suffix, forming a unit. The compound nouns I discuss here are composed from two or more inherently possessed nouns.
81 There are two more ways of forming a compound noun. It can be formed from a simple noun followed by the word for ‗similar‘ plus a nominalizing suffix, for example: uk-pɯlepte-bɯ-em-ɯrɯn (1INCL-knife-similar-NMLZR-POSS) ‗our (incl.) razor blades‘. Also it can be formed from an ideophone followed by a verb plus a nominalizing suffix, for example: uŋ-bak-ke-ni-rɯn-gom (1INCL-noise-do/makeNMLZR-POSS-PL) ‗our (incl.) hoes‘. Nominalization is outside the scope of this thesis.
82 Some of these qualities as ‗big‘ and ‗small‘ have another way to be expressed. They can be expressed by words and not suffixes. However they are not discussed here.
74

As I will show in this chapter, the ordering of possessed and plural suffixes on nouns
provides one formal criterion for determining the existence of compounds. When a
possessed noun is inflected with a plural suffix, this suffix follows the possessive suffix.
A simple example is given in (160). (160) a. i-pu-n
3-foot-POSS ‗his/her/its foot‘
b. i-pu-n-gom 3-foot-POSS-PL ‗their feet‘

A compound is different from a sequence of two nouns in a genitive construction.

This is an important point since some of the compounds discussed in this chapter may

appear at first glance to be simply a sequence of two nouns in a genitive construction. In

the genitive construction, a noun phrase is followed by a possessed noun, as shown in

(161). (161) a.

wokori bugu-n

dog

foot-POSS

‗dog‘s foot‘

b. mune bugu-n Mune foot-POSS ‗Mune‘s foot‘

c. ugu-tʃigu-ru-ŋmo

etʃi-t83

1INCL-urine-POSS-PL container-POSS

‗our (incl.) bladders‘

d. ug-ere-n

mum-tʃi-ŋmo

1INCL-liver-POSS head-POSS-PL

‗our (incl.) hearts‘.

83 In a genitve construction only one element is pluralized, either the first or the second element, as shown (161c and d).
75

A compound is formed by the combination of two or more inherently possessed noun

roots, resulting in an inherently possessed noun. Consider the example of ‗hair (on the

head)‘. (162)

i-mumbu-t 3-hair.on.head-POSS ‗his/her hair (on head)‘

I claim that the morpheme mumbu is a compound formed from the roots mum ‗head‘

and pu ‗hair/fur‘. All body parts that have hair can form a compound with pu ‗hair/fur‘.

The alternative analysis, rejected here, is that this is simply a lexicalized phrase that is

essentially ‗his head‘s hair‘ (although that is certainly the etymological origin of the

compound). Comparison with the genitive plus noun construction described above,

however, shows that the morphology expected for a genitive phrase does not occur. The

word for ‗his/her/its head‘ is i-mum-tʃi (3-head-POSS) and the word for ‗his/her/its

hair/fur‘ is i-pu-t (3-hair/fur-POSS). See Chapter 3 for the inflectional marking relating to

possession. The data in (163) repeat the relevant facts for these particular nouns.

(163) a.

i-pu-t 3-hair/fur-POSS ‗his/her/its hair/fur‘

b. i-mum-tʃi 3-head-POSS ‗his/her/its head‘

A genitive plus noun construction formed from these words is, in this case,

ungrammatical, as shown in (164).

(164)

*i-mum-tʃi pu-t 3-head-POSS hair/fur-POSS (‗his/her hair (on head)‘)

The morphological criterion mentioned in the introduction to this chapter is relevant here. We know that the string mumbu is a single (but historically complex) noun because

76

it is inflected as a single noun and not as two nouns. The crucial thing to notice is that the possessive suffix tʃi is not permitted between mum and pu.
In all of the data in the corpus, the allomorph of the possessive suffix on a compound noun is the same as that used for the second root of the compound, as shown in (165).

(165)

‗his/her/its ...‘ Compound ‗his/her/its ...‘ nouns

a. ‗shin‘ b. ‗head‘

i-ptʃi-n i-mum-tʃi

c. ‗back‘ d. ‗lip‘

i-mowa-n i-bo-rɯ

e. ‗skin/shell‘ -epi- f. ‗hair/fur‘ i-pu-t

i-ptʃipu-t i-mumbu-t i-mumbi- i-mopu-t84 i-botpu-t i-botpi-

‗shin hair‘ (shin-hair/fur) ‗head hair‘ (head-hair/fur) ‗scalp‘ (hair/fur-skin) ‗back hair‘ (back-hair/fur) ‗mustache‘ (lip-hair/fur) ‗skin of lip‘ (lip-skin)

A compound noun can be formed from three noun roots, as can be seen by comparing

(166a-c) with (166d), which has the compound.
(166) a. i-eŋ-uru 1SG-eye-POSS ‗my eye‘
b. NP epi- NP skin/shell-POSS ‗NP‘s skin‘
c. NP pu-t NP hair/fur-POSS ‗NP‘s hair‘
d. i-eŋbipu-t 1SG-eyebrow-POSS ‗my eyebrow‘

As can be seen in the examples above, the compound possessed noun (typically composed of two or more roots) is inflected like a common possessed noun, with inflection at the margins.

84 The second syllable of mowa is deleted with the adding of put.
77

The nouns for ‗shirt‘, ‗skin/shell‘, and ‗hair/fur‘ are the nouns used as the second
element in making a compound. All terms for body parts that have hair can be combined
with pu ‗hair/fur‘; some of the nouns can be compounded with epi ‗skin/shell‘; and, body
part terms that can have a cover, such as ‗eye,‘ ‗hand,‘ ‗head,‘ and ‗foot‘ can be attached
to aboi to form ‗eyeglasses,‘ ‗hat,‘ ‗gloves‘ and ‗socks‘, respectively.
One compound noun is exceptional and requires mentioning. In the compound noun
stem for ‗glasses,‘ instead of the possessive suffix being only at the end of the compound
word, it occurs in the middle of the words, after the first stem, as shown in (167c).
Compare this form with the inflected nouns in (167a-b) (167) a. i-eŋ-uru
1SG-eye-POSS ‗my eye‘
b. NP aboi- NP shirt-POSS ‗NP‘s shirt‘
c. i-eŋuruboi- 1SG-eyeglasses-POSS ‗my eyeglasses‘
The presence of the suffix -uru leads to an initial hypothesis that this is really a noun
phrase. However, other formal criteria suggest that it is a compound. One of these has to
do with the restrictions on the plurality morpheme. When a compound is inflected for
plurality, the plural suffix comes in the final position, after the possessive suffix, as can
be seeing by comparing the compound nouns in (168) with the simple nouns in (169). (168) a. uŋ-mumbu-t-kom
1INCL-hair.on.head-POSS-PL ‗our (incl.) hair (on head)‘ b. ug-eŋbipu-t-kom 1INCL-eyebrow-POSS-PL ‗our (incl.) eyebrows‘
78

(169) a. i-pu-n-gom 3-foot-POSS-PL ‗their feet‘
b. ug-eŋ-uru-ŋmo 1INCL-eye-POSS-PL ‗our (incl.) eyes‘

If the word for ‗glasses‘ were a sequence of two nouns, we would expect to be able to

pluralize the first noun (‗eyes‘), or the second noun (‗shirts‘), as in (170b-c) but this is not

acceptable.
(170) a. ug-eŋuruboi-ŋmo 1INCL-eyeglasses-PL ‗our (incl.) eyeglasses‘

b. *ug-eŋ-uru-ŋmo

boi-

(1INCL-eye-POSS-PL shirt-POSS)

(‗our (incl.) eyeglasses‘)

c. *ug-eŋ-uru

aboi-ŋmo

And also the initial vowel of the root aboi would not be deleted. This deletion does not
happen when aboi occurs in a genitive plus noun construction, as shown in (171b).
(171) a. -aboi- 3-shirt-POSS ‗his/her shirt‘
b. ioru aboi- Ioru shirt-POSS ‗Ioru‘s shirt‘
c. *ioru boi-

This evidence leads to the conclusion that the word ieŋuruboi ‗my eyeglasses‘ is a compound noun despite the presence of the syllable uru that corresponds to the possessive suffix for eŋ ‗eye‘.

79

The second root in a compound always loses its initial vowel (if it has one), whether
or not the first root ends in a vowel. The examples in (172), compounding with √epi
‗skin, shell,‘ show this type of deletion as with √aboi ‗shirt‘.
(172) a. i-mum-tʃi 3-head-POSS ‗his/her/its head‘
b. -epi- 3-skin/shell-POSS ‗his/her/its skin‘, ‗its shell‘
c. i-mumbi- 3-scalp-POSS ‗his/her scalp‘

A further possible example of deletion appears in five compound nouns referring to body part terms, and one referring to a plant part. These compounds have a common morpheme gua attached to the root, as shown in (173). This morpheme may be a reduced form of the root for ‗hole‘ √egua, which is inherently possessed.

(173)

‗his/her/its ...‘ Compound nouns

a. ‗hole‘ -egua-n b. ‗mouth‘ i-la-tʃi c. ‗heel‘ i-pta-tʃi d. ‗armpit‘ i-apta-n85 e. ‗hand‘ √amda f.

i-lagua-n i-ptagua-n i-aptagua-n i-amdagua-n -elegua-n

‗his/her palate‘ ‗his/her sole‘ ‗his/her armpit‘ ‗my palm‘ ‗its (palm tree) green leaf‘

If gua is a reduced form of the root √egua, then the same process of ‗deletion‘ which

occurs in √aboi ‗shirt‘ and √epi ‗skin, shell‘ is happening with √egua, as shown in

(175b). Compare (174b) with (175b).

85 The word iaptan ‗his/her armpit‘ is used by the group of people who were contacted in 1983 and iaptaguan ‗his/her armpit‘ is used by the group of people contacted in 1981.
80

(174) a. -aboi- 3-shirt-POSS ‗his/her shirt‘
b. i-eŋuruboi- 1SG-eyeglasses-POSS ‗my glasses‘
(175) a. -egua-n 3-hole-POSS ‗its hole‘
b. i-lagua-n 3-palate-POSS ‗his/her/its palate‘
All six compound nouns with gua have similar shape: roof of the mouth, sole, armpit, palm, back part of the knee and the place where the palm leaves attach to the trunk. I think gua is referring to the shape of these nouns (concave or curved), which resemble a hole in some way.
The evidence of the deletion of the initial vowels of aboi ‗shirt‘, epi ‗skin‘ and egua ‗hole‘ and also the fact that it is not possible to pluralize the noun for ‗eye‘ inside of this expression cause me to conclude that eŋuruboi ‗his/her glasses‘ is a compound and not a sequence of two lexical words even though the possessive suffix -uru is present.
6.2 Modifying suffixes Nouns can be modified by suffixes that denote the deceased, former, size and shape,
etc. Some of these suffixes are very productive, while others are not. These suffixes may attach to noun bases of any sort (unpossessed, inherently possessed, or derived). In some cases, they derive new lexical items. For some of these suffixes, there is an alternative way of communicating the same information through adjective phrases.
81

6.2.1 Augmentative Augmentative suffixes denote a large size. There are two augmentative suffixes: -jum,
and -gemnɯ. The suffix -um is used on unpossessed nouns, as shown in (176a-h); and on children
names denoting a big or strong person, as shown in (176i and j).86

It has two allomorphs: -jum after consonants, as in (176a-d); and -um after vowels, as in (176e-h).
Some unpossessed nouns with the augmentative -um can be inflected for possession and plurality, as shown in (177). The possessive suffix comes after the augmentative, and

86 There is only one kinship term that can be inflected with this suffix. It is the term for ‗uncle‘ which is only used to refer to the shaman of the village: koko-um. In this case, it is not referring to the size of the man but to his availability or authority.
87 The consonant t palatalizes before the suffix -jum, as in (176a and b). Stops are palatalized before the coronal glide.
88 The final n is deleted before the suffix -jum, as in (176c and d). When two consonants of similar points of articulation are together, there is a violation of the Obligatory Contour Principle, so, the first one is deleted. (I. Souza: 2010)
89 The noun tapeda is used to refer to ‗paper, or money‘, depending on the context. When inflected with the augmentative suffix it refers only to ‗paper‘.
82

the plural suffix comes after the possessive, providing evidence for considering the
augmentative morpheme as a suffix.

c. i-tapedaum-ɯrɯn-gom 3-paper.big-POSS-PL ‗their big paper‘

The addition of the augmentative suffix sometimes produces a new lexical item. The object that the derived form refers to is viewed as being larger than the object that the base noun refers to, as shown in (178).

shown in (179).

The examples in (179) show that -gemnɯ is a suffix. The evidence that it is a suffix is

the lack of the possessive suffix, a fact that we would not expect if -gemnɯ were a simple

adjective. However, there are some nouns where gemnɯ is following the possessive

suffix, as shown in 180).

eŋuru gemnɯ ‗his/her big eye‘; and ibet egemnɯ ‗his/her big thigh‘, as a regular N ADJ

Noun + Aug i-maŋat-tpɯgemnɯ95 ‗her big breast‘ i-mbɯa-tʃi-tpɯgemnɯ ‗his/her big/thick arm‘

Although -tpɯgemnɯ is following the possessive suffix -tʃi in the second example, it

is probably a suffix and not a N ADJ phrase (imbɯatʃi tpɯgemnɯ) for two reasons: first,

when imbɯatʃitpɯgemnɯ ‗his/her big/thick arm‘ (182b) is syllabified, then the t

of -tpɯgemnɯ comes with tʃi (im-bɯ-a-tʃit-pɯ-gem-nɯ); second, the language does not

have any word beginning with a cluster with two consonants, for example, ‗his/her/its

shin‘ is i-ptʃi-n (3-shin-POSS). As a NP one would expect *NP ptʃin ‗NP‘s shin,‘ but it is

not; it is NP bɯtʃin. The underlying form in this case is bɯtʃin, as shown in section 3.1.3.

6.2.2 Diminutive

The suffix -giri denotes a small size. It is used only with words referring to body

parts, as shown in (183). The evidence to consider -giri a suffix is that the possessive

suffix is not present.

95 The final t of maŋat is part of the root. It can be seen in the following forms as i-maŋat-ke-bara (3-breast-COMP-NEG) ‗It is not alike her breast‘; tɯ-maŋat-ke (T-breast-ADJR) ‗she has breast‘; tɯ-maŋatkae (T-breast-NEG) ‗She does not have breast (handicapped)‘.
96 There are two roots for ‗arm‘: √mubɯa and √ambo. The first one, presented in (182b), can be inflected with possessor prefix and possessive suffix: ɯ-mbɯa-tʃi (1SG-arm-POSS) ‗my arm‘; the second cannot be inflected with possessive suffix; it is always combined with modifying suffixes, as in (183); noun incorporation, as od-ambo-pi-ge-lɯ (REFL-arm-skin-get-REC) ‗his/her own skin peeled off‘; and with a derivational suffix, as t-ambo-g-a (T-arm-ADJR-NEG) ‗without arm (handicapp)‘.
97 The final t of emiat is part of the root. It can be seen by comparing the following paradigm: omiat (ABST.hand) ‗hand‘; tomiat-ke (T.hand-ADJR) ‗s/he/it has hands‘; tomiat-k-ae (T.hand-ADJR-NEG) ‗s/he/it does not have hand (handicap)‘.

However, the same thing that occurs with the augmentative suffix -gemnɯ discussed in

section 6.4.1 is occurring here. The diminutive suffix -giri is following the possessive

suffix of the nouns for ‗head‘, and ‗eye‘, as shown in (183j-k).

6.2.3 Deceased

The suffix -mgeni ‗deceased‘ is used only with names and nouns that refer to people.

It is not culturally acceptable to mention a dead person‘s name without using this suffix.

It can be used with unpossessed nouns such as ‗man‘, and ‗woman‘, with kinship terms,

and with names, as shown in (184). After vowels the allomorph used is -mgeni, as in

(184b-d), and after consonants it is -geni, as in (184a and e). Note in these examples that

the final consonant of the noun or name is dropped when the suffix is added.

6.2.4 Long, flat and short

The qualities of being long, flat, and short have in common the following

morphological details: (a) the possessive suffix is not present; (b) the predicate suffix -k

follows these suffixes and is obligatory; and, (c) they occur mainly with inherently

possessed nouns, as shown in (185).

b. -eŋna-tʃi-ma-k 3-nose-DIM-long-PRED ‗it has a long and thin beak‘ (bird, sp.)

98 ‗Long-tongued‘ is used to refer to a part of a flute. 99 The form imumak ‗s/he/it is long-headed‘ is used only referring to third person. It is not possible to say ‗I am long-headed‘ inflecting it with the prefix for first person *ɯ-mum-ma-k (1SG-head-long-PRED). To say this the free pronoum is needed: i-mum-ma-k uro (3-head-long-PRED I) ‗I am long-headed‘. 100 The morpheme tʃi is used as a diminutive in the dialect of the group contacted in 1983 in the following lexical item: ogorotʃi ‗(domestic) cat' is literally ‗jaguar-Diminutive‘.

6.2.5 Birthmark

A birthmark is marked by the suffix -pe. It is attached to the noun root and is used

only with body parts, as shown in (191). The suffix -pe ‗birthmark‘ co-occurs with the

prefix tɯ-, to-, or t-, the same prefix that is used with the suffixes for ‗flat‘ and ‗short‘.

101 The prefix tɯ- is homophonouns to the third person reflexive, that is discussed in section 3.1.5.

102 The noun for ‗neck‘ seems to have two roots: √demtʃitpɯ ‗neck‘ and √dem. The first one can be inflected for possessor (with the possessive suffix): ɯ-demtʃitpɯ-n (1SG-neck-POSS) ‗my neck‘, o-demtʃitpɯ-n (2-neck-POSS) ‗your neck‘, etc. The second one is used with other forms, including noun incorporation: i-dem-bulu (3-neck-protuberance) ‗his Adam‘s apple‘, i-dem-iako (3-neck-PERL) ‗throughout his/her/its neck‘, i-dem-daige-lɯ ‗his/her throat got hurt‘.
103 The suffix -gowɯ has a variation -goriwɯ. It is used with the noun for ‗tail‘ t-awom-goriwɯ-t ‗it is crooked-tailed‘ and for ‗shin‘ in tɯ-ptʃi-goriwɯ ‗crooked-shinned‘ (a man‘s name), as in (195).
89

A word with the suffix -gowɯ ‗crooked‘ can occur with or without the prefix T- and occur without the suffix ‗having‘ to name animals and humans, as shown in (194) and (195). Some people receive their names based on the part of the body that is crooked.

6.2.7 ‘Encircled by black’ and ‘one of a pair’

The suffixes -burume ‗encircled by black‘, and -tedun ‗one of a pair‘ occur with body

parts. -burume seems to refer only to animal‘s body part words, as shown in (196). The

generic prefix that co-occurs with the suffixes for ‗flat‘, ‗short‘, and ‗birthmark‘, also

co-occurs with -burume.

‗shoulder blade‘. It is attached to the noun root, as shown in (197).

(197)a. i-mbe- 3-shoulder.blade-POSS ‗his/her shoulder blade‘

6.2.8 Soft

The suffix -pkura ‗soft‘ occurs in one only example in the data. It is added to the

noun root and the possessive suffix comes after it, as shown in (198).
(198) a. -eŋna-n 3-nose- POSS ‗his/her/its nose‘

b. -eŋna-pkura-n 3-nose-soft-POSS ‗soft part of his/her/its nose‘

6.3 Former The idea of ‗former‘ is widely used in the language. The ‗former‘ suffix has slightly
different meanings when it is used with different nouns. For example, when the noun refers to an inanimate object, the suffix indicates that the item has been abandoned or is now being used for some purpose other than its primary use. The word mobutpo ‗former canoe‘, for example, can be used during the process of making manioc flour. They put the former canoe inside the water next to the river bank, and then use it to put the manioc to be softened. On such a noun, it may also indicate that the item has been damaged and is now unusable, even though it is new; tuktotpo ‗former field‘ means the field is abandoned; oboiŋotpo ‗former clothes‘ means the clothes are old and not used anymore.104 The word amɯtubɯrɯ ‗his/her former pet‘ may have two meanings: the pet has another owner or is dead. The word ibɯtubɯrɯ ‗his former wife‘ is ambiguous: the

104 oboiŋotpo ‗former clothes‘ is the absolute form of √aboi ‗shirt‘. In this form it can have only this meaning. When √aboi ‗shirt‘ is inflected for possession and former, then it has two meanings, as do pet and wife etc.
91

couple is no longer married either due to divorce or to death of one or the other. The word emtʃitpɯn ‗his former daughter‘ always refers to a deceased daughter.
Two suppletive suffixes are used to indicate this concept: -tubo, and -nbo.105 They are attached to the noun root. -tubo can occur on unpossessed nouns (199), on nouns inflected for the absolute form (200), and on optionally and inherently possessed nouns (201).

The ‗former‘ suffix allomorphs are phonologically conditioned: -tubo and -tub occur

after voiceless consonant, (202); -dubo and -dub occur after nasal, (203); and -tpo and -tp

occur after vowel, as shown in (204). The allomorphs that end in -o (-t(d)ubo, -tpo

and -nbo) occur with unpossessed nouns or nouns in their absolute forms; and the other

allomorphs occur with possessed nouns.

105 -tubo has six allomorphs: -tubo, -dubo, -tpo, -tub, -dub, and -tp; and -nbo has two allomorphs: -nbo and -nb. More details about them are given below.

When the suffix -tubo is attached to a possessed noun, inherently or optionally

possessed, the final o of -tubo is dropped and a possessive suffix -ɯn or -ɯrɯ is added to

it. It is added independently of the possessive suffix inherent to the noun, which is not

overt when the noun is inflected with -tubo, as shown in (205) and (206).

The other suffix used to indicate ‗former‘ is -nbo which occurs mainly on inherently

possessed nouns that have zero as their possessive suffix. It has two allomorphs: -nbo and

-nb, which occur only after a vowel. In contrast to -tubo, -nbo occurs only on

unpossessed nouns. There are only two examples inflected with -nbo, as illustrated in

(208), and they do not have a possessed counterpart. The allomorph -nb occurs on

possessed nouns that have null as their possessive suffix, as shown in (209). When in

their absolute form these possessed nouns use the ‗former‘ suffix -tpo, (210).

The ‗former‘ suffixes -tubo and -nbo are attached on the noun roots. The noun‘s

possessive suffix is dropped or replaced with -tubo or -nbo. However, the noun for ‗his

son‘, and the nouns that have -t as their possessive suffix, keep the possessive suffix

when inflected with -dubo, (211), and the noun for ‗his/her/its eye‘ also keeps the

possessive suffix when inflected with -nbo, (212).

In these two cases, the possessive suffixes are present. Example (211a)

could be considered to be two distinct words if other possible sequences were taken into

consideration: i-mu-n dub-ɯrɯ ‗his former son‘. However, -eŋ-urunb-ɯn is not

possible because the language does not have any word beginning with two consonants,

*-eŋ-uru nb-ɯn, as shown previously, in section 6.2.1.

CHAPTER 7 DENOMINAL PREDICATE ADJECTIVES
In this chapter I discuss one suffix that has six suppletive allomorphs that only co-occur with a certain prefix, /tɯ-/.107 The result of this combination seems to be a predicate adjective, and so these suffixes can be viewed as derivational.108 In section 7.1 I discuss the morphology of these words. In section 7.2 I compare and contrast these words with basic adjectives, looking at both structural and distributional features, in order to explain their syntactic category.
The allomorphs of the suffix under discussion can occur on unpossessed nouns or on inherently possessed nouns. All six of these derivational suffixes seem to have the same meaning ‗characterized as having‘ and so I gloss them as ADJR for ‗adjectivizer‘. The relationship between a noun and the denominal predicate adjective is shown in (213).
107 In his description of Tiriyó, Meira (1999:358) glosses the prefix /tɯ-/, with which these suffixes occur, with a capital ‗T‘; I follow that practice here. The prefix /tɯ-/is homophonous with the reflexive prefix, shown in section 3.1.5, and has the same allomorphs as that morpheme. It is also homophonous with the prefix used on verbs to form the participle, and with the prefix used on some transitive verbs to mark the object. I do not take a position here on whether these forms are somehow related or are simply accidentally homophonous.
108 Hixkaryana, Ikpeng and Tiriyó, related languages to Ugoroŋmo, have the same type of word. Derbyshire (1985:237) calls it an adverb for Hixkaryana; Pacheco (2001:113) refers to an adjectival construction for Ikpeng; and Meira (1999: 358) calls it an adverb for Tiriyó.

b. tɯ-bana-k T-ear-ADJR ‗S/he/it has ear.‘ or ‗S/he/it hears.‘

109 This form can also be used to refer to a sharp tool, such as knife, machete, or axe. 110 In yes-no questions there is a particle ka, which can carry a marker for second person -ŋ ‗2‘ or third person -k ‗3‘ when these persons are not marked on the noun or verb. For example, m-od-ep ka? (2-REFLarrive Q) ‗Did you arrive?‘, to-ep-te ka-ŋ (?-arrive-PART Q-2) ‗Have you arrived?‘, n-ep ka? (3-arrive Q) ‗Did s/he/it arrive?‘, to-ep-te ka-k (?-arrive-PART Q-3) ‗Has s/he/it arrived?‘. The -k can be used with a first person pronoun, kure-p ka-k uro (good/beautiful-PRED Q-3 I) ‗Am I good, beautiful?‘ kure-p ka-k tʃimna (good/beautiful-PRED Q-3 1EXCL) ‗Are we (excl.) good, beautiful?‘

7.1 The forms of the predicate adjectivizer suffix Just as the choice of the suppletive allomorphs for the possessive suffix seems to be a
matter of arbitrary noun class, the choice of the form of the suppletive allomorphs of the adjectivizer suffixes is generally unpredictable. The six suppletive allomorphs and their phonologically derived allomorphs are presented in (218).

Each of these morphemes is presented in the following subsections.

7.1.1 tɯ-...-k

The formative -k can occur with a stem that is an inherently possessed noun root, as

shown in (219), or an unpossesse noun, as shown in (220). This suffix is widely used. It

99

occurs with some of the nouns whose possessive suffixes are -n, -rɯ, and -. On possessed nouns this suffix appears following the root without the possessive suffix.
The suffix -k has the phonologically related allomorph -ge after nasal consonants, and the allomorph -ke after voiceless consonants, as shown in (219)-(220).

7.1.2 tɯ-…-ŋ

This formative -ŋ occurs mainly with inflected nouns. It quite unexpectedly occurs

with any overt possessive suffix that the possessed noun is expected to take, as shown in

(221). Note that in (221) the possessive suffixes -tʃi and -ru precede the formative -ŋ.

7.1.3 tɯ-...-ŋie

The formative -ŋie combines with only a small number of nouns, and, like the

suffix -ŋ above, co-occurs with the possessive suffix -rɯ. Only the nouns listed in (223)

were found in the corpus with -ŋie.

(223)
a. ‗helper‘ b. ‗trunk (tree)‘ c. ‗husband‘ d. ‗owner‘ e. ‗older brother (of ME)‘ f. ‗older sister (of FE)‘ g. ‗(plant) flower‘ h. ‗fishbone‘

-ano- -ebɯ- i-o- i-odo- i-ru- i-ba-rɯ -eborog-uru i-g-ɯrɯ

The formative -ŋie appears to have an allomorph -ie which appears (so far) with only

two nouns that end with the consonant g, as shown in (223g-h).

7.1.4 tɯ-…-re

The formative -re is used with inherently possessed nouns, as shown in (224). The

possessive suffix -t remains in the derived adjective (though voiced, because it is in

intervocalic position, see (224a-d)), but the possessive suffix -ru does not.

The formative -re has the phonologically related allomorphs: -e occurs after coronals (see

Appendix A for rule on R-deletion), as shown in (224a-i), and -ere elsewhere (see

Appendix A for rule on Vowel epenthesis), as shown in (224j-p).

So far only one inherently unpossessed noun has been found to be inflected with the

derivational suffix -re, as shown in (225).
(225) a. wot ‗fish‘

b. tɯ-wod-e ‗S/he has fish (food).‘

7.1.5 tɯ-…-igere

The formative -igere occurs with nouns that all happen to refer to hair and fiber and co-occurs with the possessive suffix, as shown in (226).112 The meaning of these forms

seem to be ‗characterized as having a lot of X‘. (The formative –re in section 7.1.4 also

occurs with nouns that refer to hair.)

7.2 Some common features of basic adjectives and denominal adjectives In this section, some common features of basic adjectives and denominal adjectives
are presented. 7.2.1 Features of the class of basic adjectives
The class of basic adjectives attested in the corpus is very small. The most common members of this class are presented in (228).

(228) Basic adjectives
a. kure b. wɯrɯp c. tarik d. muren e. pɯrɯmon f. paemnɯn

103

g. amgun

‗shallow‘

These adjectives can have either an attributive function or a predicative function. The

examples in (229) illustrate the use of these adjectives in an attributive function within a

noun phrase. Note that they follow the noun.

(229) a. [oboi-ŋo

d. [pɯlepte bɯrɯmon] i--arɯ-lɯ

knife

enormous 1-3-take-REC

‗I took the enormous knife.‘

When a basic adjective is used predicatively, it must be marked with the Predicative
suffix, as shown in (230).
(230) a. kure-p good/beautiful-PRED ‗S/he/it is good, beautiful.‘
b. wɯrɯp-pe bad/ugly-PRED ‗S/he/it is bad, ugly.‘
c. tarik-pe big-PRED ‗S/he/it is big.‘

The subject of the predicate adjective is expressed externally, and is interpreted as third person if it is not overt, as shown in (231)-(232).

104

(231) a. kure-p

uro

‗I am good.‘

b. kure-p good/beautiful-PRED ‗S/he/it is good, beautiful.‘ (*I am good. *You are good.)
(232) a. nuno tarik-pe moon big-PRED ‗The moon is big.‘

b. tarik-pe big-PRED ‗S/he/it is big.‘ (*I am big. *You are big.)

A construction with a simple adjective that is used predicatively can have the plural

marked in three different ways. If the subject is not overt, the plural suffix occurs after

the root, as shown in (233)-(235). The distribution of these plural forms is not discussed

here. (233) a.

kure-p good/beautiful-PRED ‗S/he/it is good, beautiful.‘

b. kure-ŋmo-p good/beautiful-PL-PRED ‗They are good, beautiful.‘

b. wɯrɯ-bi-am-be113 bad/ugly-LNKR-PL-PRED ‗They are bad, ugly.‘

113 The adjective wɯrɯp when inflected with -am ‗plural‘ refers to ‗bad or ugly things‘ and when inflected with -kom refers to ‗bad‘ or ‗ugly people‘ wɯrɯp-kom (bad/ugly-PL.)
105

(235) a. tarik-pe big-PRED ‗S/he/it is big‘
b. tarik-kom-be big-PL-PRED ‗They are big.‘

If the yes-no question particle is used, the plural suffix occurs after the person marker,

which is attached to the yes-no question particle, as shown in (236).

(236) a. kure-p

ka-ŋ

good/beautiful-PRED Q-2

‗Are you good, beautiful?‘

b. kure-p

ka-ŋ-dom

good/beautiful-PRED Q-2-PL

‗Are you (plural) good, beautiful?‘

And, if the subject is overt, the plural suffix occurs with it, as shown in (237).

(237) a. kure-p

omoro

good/beautiful-PRED you

‗You are good, beautiful.‘

b. kure-p

omoro-ŋmo

good/beautiful-PRED you-PL

‗You (plural) are good, beautiful.‘

The basic adjectives cannot be nominalized, either when functioning as attributive or

when functioning predicatively, as shown in (238).

To have the meaning of ‗the ... ones‘ only the plural suffix is used without the predicative suffix, as shown in (239).

7.2.2 Features of denominal adjectives

Denominal adjectives are used predicatively but never attributively (but see below for

more details). A set of simple examples is shown in (240).
(240) a. t-aboi-ŋ T-shirt-ADJR ‗S/he is wearing a shirt.‘

b. t-aboi-ŋ

uro

T-shirt-ADJR I

‗I am wearing a shirt.‘

with externally expressed subject

c. t-aboi-ŋ

ka-ŋ

with yes/no question particle

T-shirt-ADJR Q-2

‗Are you wearing a shirt?‘

When a denominal adjective has an overt subject or occurs in a yes-no question, the

plural suffix occurs on the external subject or the question construction, like the simple

adjective does when it is used predicatively, as shown in (241)-(242).

(241) a. t-aboi-ŋ

omoro

T-shirt-ADJR you

‗You are wearing a shirt.‘

c. t-aboi-ŋ

omoro-ŋmo

T-shirt-ADJR you-PL

‗You (plural) are wearing a shirt.‘

107

(242) a. t-aboi-ŋ

ka-ŋ

T-shirt-ADJR Q-2

‗Are you wearing a shirt.‘

b. t-aboi-ŋ

ka-ŋ-dom

T-shirt-ADJR Q-2-PL

‗Are you (plural) wearing a shirt.‘

The denominal adjective can be nominalized. In this case, the nominalizer suffix,

meaning ‗the one who ...‘, occurs after the adjectivizer suffix, as shown in (243).

(243) a.

t-aboi-ŋ-em T-shirt-ADJR-NMLZR ‗the one who is wearing a shirt‘

b. t-abo-g-em T-wing-ADJR-NMLZR ‗the one who has wing(s)‘

The denominal adjective can also be inflected with the plural suffix -am, (as the basic
adjective wɯrɯp can, as shown (234)), which occurs after the adjectivizer. In this case,
there is another nominalizer suffix, -o, that always occur after the plural suffix, as shown
in (244). (244) a. t-aboi-ŋ-am-o
T-shirt-ADJR-PL-NMLZR ‗the ones who are wearing a shirt‘
b. t-abo-g-am-o T-wing-ADJR-PL-NMLZR ‗the ones who have wing(s)‘

CHAPTER 8 SUMMARY
In this thesis I have presented general and detailed information about the morphology of nouns in the Ugoroŋmo language. Nouns can be divided in three main groups: those that cannot be inflected for possession, those that can be so inflected, and those that are inherently possessed. Inflection is by both prefixation and suffixation.
Inherently possessed nouns are always inflected, indicating either the possessor or the absence of a possessor (absolute form). They typically have a paradigm of up to seventeen forms, one of which is a distinct form that is used when an explicit NP possessor is present.
Almost all of the inherently possessed noun roots that begin with a vowel begin with either a or e. Only twelve words begin with a different vowel, and these twelve use allomorphs of prefixes that generally occur with the nouns that begin with consonants.
Possessed nouns require a possessive suffix in addition to a possessor prefix. Six arbitrary classes are required to account for the distribution of the formatives used. The possessive suffix is usually replaced by an absolute suffix, or a comparative case suffix, but the details are complicated and there are some exceptions.
There are five person distinctions in the language: first, second, third, first person inclusive and first person exclusive. All of these are marked on the nouns as prefixes, except for first person exclusive, which is expressed by a separate word that syntactically acts like a noun phrase.
The absolute form, which indicates the lack of a possessor, is formed using two affixes: one prefix (sometimes null) and one suffix (sometimes null). The absolute form has a more generic meaning.
109

Nouns can be inflected for four locative cases and a comparative case, all suffixes. The comparative case occurs only with possessed nouns.
Nouns can also be pluralized. There are some complications on the inherently possessed nouns since one may want to pluralize the possessor, or the possessed item, or both. Typically, the suffix –am indicates plurality of the possessed item, and –kom plurality of the possessor. Some situations are more complicated. In some cases it is necessary to infer the interpretation from the context.
Compound nouns are formed from two or three inherently possessed nouns, as indicated by the fact that they have only one possessor prefix and one possessive suffix. The possessive suffix of a compound is the one used on the last root of the compound.
Modifying suffixes denote size, shape, etc. Besides denoting a large size, the augmentative suffix also sometimes produces a new lexical item.
The denominal predicate adjective is derived from a noun. Basically meaning ‗characterized as having‘, it is formed by a prefix and a suffix. The suffix has six suppletive allomorphs, of which the formative -k has the widest distribution.
This thesis makes a contribution to the field of linguistics by providing a more detailed description of the nominal morphology of a Cariban language than was previously available. It provides important data that will be useful for comparison with other languages of this family. It also provides a more serious foundation for future development of Ugoroŋmo language in its written form by demonstrating the complexities of its morphology.

APPENDIX A PHONOLOGICAL RULES

Some of the phonological rules presented here are lexical rules and some are postlexical (Kiparsky, 1982). Most of them are presented in I. Souza (in progress). Complete justification for each rule is not presented in this appendix.

A.1. Progressive Devoicing

An obstruent is devoiced when it follows a voiceless context – that is, when it is

either in utterance-initial position or follows a voiceless consonant. The first of these

situations is shown in (1).

(1)

After a prefix vowel After a vowel-final word Elsewhere

a.

ɯ-bɯlepte-n

bɯlepte

1SG-knife-POSS

‗knife‘

‗my knife‘

pɯlepte ‗knife‘

b.

ɯ-borido-n

borido

1SG-basket-POSS ‗basket‘

‗my basket‘

porido ‗basket‘

Data such as that in (2) show that underlyingly voiceless obstruents remain voiceless

in all of these contexts.

(2)

After a prefix vowel

After a vowel-final word Elsewhere

a. ɯ-kambo-rɯ 1SG-firewood-POSS ‗my firewood‘

kambot ‗firewood‘

kambot ‗firewood‘

b. ɯ-tutu-n 1SG-vagina-POSS

tutuŋo ‗vagina‘

tutuŋo ‗vagina‘

112

The second situation (namely, following a voiceless consonant) is shown in (3);

specifically, note the devoicing in (3c).
(3) a. i-boda-p 3-inside-PRED ‗it is inside it‘

b. porido boda-p basket inside-PRED ‗it is inside the basket‘

c. i-etʃi-t

poda-p

1SG-house-POSS inside-PRED

‗it is inside my house‘

A.2. Progressive Voicing

A consonant is voiced when it follows a sonorant consonant (which happens to

always be a nasal), as shown in (4) for the suffixes shown.

(4) a. tʃi-t-tam house-POSS-INE ‗at my house‘

i-mum-dam 3-head-INE ‗on his/her/its head‘

b. tʃi-t-taktʃi

i-mum-daktʃi

house-POSS-ILL 3-head-ILL

‗towards my house‘ ‗towards his/her head‘

or ‗towards its top‘

c. i-la-tʃi

i-mum-dʒi

3-mouth-POSS

3-head-POSS

‗his/her/its mouth‘ ‗his/her/its head‘

A voiced obstruent of a preceding root does not cause a voiceless obstruent of a suffix to be voiced. See the following section A.3.

A.3. Regressive Devoicing An obstruent becomes voiceless when it precedes a voiceless context – that is, either before a voiceless obstruent, or in utterance-final position, as shown in (5) with roots that

113

end in voiced obstruents in their underlying forms. This is the mirror-image of the rule

shown in A.1.

(5)

Before a suffix vowel

a. -emeb-uru 3-walking.stick-POSS ‗his/her walking stick‘

Before a voiceless suffix
tomep-ke T.walking.stick-ADJR ‗having a walking stick‘

Final utterance
omep ABST.walking.stick ‗walking stick‘

b. -arog-ɯrɯ 3-headdress-POSS ‗his/her headdress‘

t-arok-ke T-headdress-ADJR ‗having headdress‘

orok ABST.headdress ‗headdress‘

A.4. Regressive Voicing

A voiceless obstruent becomes voiced when it precedes a voiced context, as shown in

(6)-(7). This is the mirror-image of the rule shown in A.2.

(6) a. i-bana-n 3-ear-POSS ‗his/her/its ear‘

ot-pana-k REFL-ear-COMP ‗(their) ear are alike‘

b. -amoe-n 3-fingernail-POSS ‗his/her/its fingernail‘
(7) a. kambot ‗fireplace, firewood‘
b. adak ‗two‘

od-amoe-k REFL-fingernail-COMP ‗(their) fingernail are alike‘

kambod

adak

fireplace/firewood two

‗two fireplaces, firewoods‘

adag adak ‗four‘

A.5. Nasalization of Stops

A nasal consonant causes a preceding oral stop to become a nasal. This may happen within a word, as shown in (8). It also happens across word boundaries, as shown in (9).

(8) a. w-ib-ɯlɯ 1-bathe-REC ‗I bathed‘
b. kut-tɯke-lɯ 1INCL-write-REC ‗We (incl.) wrote him/her‘

w-im-naŋɯrɯ 1-bathe-PROG ‗I am bathing‘
kun-moku-lɯ 1INCL-write-REC ‗We (incl.) smelled him/her/it‘

114

c. uk-pet- 1INCL-thigh-POSS ‗our (incl.) thigh‘
(9) a. tɯ-bɯ-t REFL-wife-POSS ‗his own wife‘
b. i-mapo 3-place ‗his/her/its place‘
c. panbak ‗ball‘

uŋ-mum-dʒi 1INCL-head-POSS ‗our (incl.) head‘

tɯ-bɯ-n

mapo

REFL-wife-POSS place

‗(it is) in his own wife‘s place‘

panbaŋ mapo ball place ‗(it is) in the ball‘s place‘

A.6. Vowel Coalescence o+e → i The second person possessor morpheme is o-, as shown in (10) with consonant-initial stems.

(10) a. o-pu-n 2-foot-POSS ‗your foot‘
b. o-la-tʃi 2-mouth-POSS ‗your mouth‘
When e-initial noun stems are inflected for second person possessor, the initial /e/ of
the stem coalesces with the /o/ of the second person possessor prefix, resulting in the
vowel /i/, as shown in (11).

(11) Second person
a. ire-n 2.liver-POSS ‗your liver‘
b. ide-t 2.name-POSS ‗your name‘

First person
i-ere-n 1SG-liver-POSS ‗my liver‘
i-ede-t 1SG-name-POSS ‗my name‘

Third person
-ere-n 3-liver-POSS ‗his/her/its liver‘
-ede-t 3-name-POSS ‗his/her/its name‘

115

A.7. Vowel Coalescence ɯ+e → o Another vowel coalescence happens when prefixes ending in /ɯ/ precede /e/. The vowels coalesce to /o/. It seems that the underlying form of the prefixes is seen when they precede a consonant-initial stem, as shown in (12).

(12) a. i-pu-n 3-foot-POSS ‗his/her/its foot‘

tɯ-pu-n REFL-foot-POSS ‗his/her/its own foot‘

b. i-la-tʃi 3-mouth-POSS ‗his/her/its mouth‘

tɯ-la-tʃi REFL-mouth-POSS ‗his/her/its own mouth‘

c. i-ru-

tɯ-ru-

3-older.brother.ME-POSS REFL-older.brother.ME-POSS

‗his older brother‘

‗his older brother‘

The effects of coalescence are shown in (13).

(13) a. -etʃi-t 3-house-POSS ‗his/her house‘
b. -ede-t 3-name-POSS ‗his/her/its name‘
c. -eŋ-uru 3-eye-POSS ‗his/her/its eye‘

totʃi-t REFL.house-POSS ‗his/her own house‘
tode-t REFL.name-POSS ‗his/her/its own name‘
toŋ-uru REFL.eye-POSS ‗his/her/its own eye‘

A.8. Vowel Raising

The vowels /o/ and /e/ raise to /u/ and /i/ respectively before the vowel /a/ when they are in the same word, as shown in (14).

(14) a. oriŋgo ABST.pan ‗pan‘
b. porido ‗basket‘

oriŋgu-am ABST.pan-INE ‗in the pan‘
poridu-am basket-INE ‗in the basket‘

116

c. -anme-lɯ 3-throw.away-REC ‗s/he/it threw it away‘

-anmi-a 3-throw.away-DIST ‗threw it (there)‘

The vowels /o/ and /e/ do not raise before other vowels, as shown in (15).

(15) a. b. c. d. e. f.

o-odo o-itpɯ-n -aboi- oet pou toɯtʃi

‗your owner‘ ‗your bone‘ ‗his/her shirt‘ ‗rubber‘ ‗peccary (sp.)‘ ‗a man name‘

The vowels /o/ and /e/ do not raise across word boundaries, as shown in (16).
(16) a. porido aŋde-lɯ basket fall-REC ‗The basket fell.‘

b. mɯe arɯ-lɯ bag take-REC ‗s/he/it took the bag‘

c. wotomo aro- tapir.(sp.) lung-POSS ‗tapir (sp.)‘s lung‘

d. mobe

a-rɯ

fruit.tree.(sp.) leaf-POSS

‗fruit tree (sp.)‘s leaf‘

A.9. Palatalization of /t/ The coronal stop /t/ palatalizes before the vowel /i/ and before /j/, as shown in (17) and (18).

(17) a. i-bana-n 3-ear-POSS ‗his/her/its ear‘

ot-pana-k REFL-ear-COMP ‗(their) ear are alike‘

b. ug-ie-n 1INCL-tooth-POSS ‗our (incl.) teeth‘

otʃ-ie-k REFL-tooth-COMP ‗(their) teeth are alike‘

c. kut-tɯke-lɯ

kutʃ-ib-ɯlɯ

1INCL-write-REC

1INCL-bathe-REC

‗We (incl.) wrote him/her‘ ‗We (incl.) bathed.‘

117

(18) a. eridak ‗parakeet (sp.)‘

eridag-jum parakeet-AUG ‗large parakeet (sp.)‘

b. orot ‗wild cashew (sp.)‘

orotʃ-jum wild.cashew-AUG ‗cultivated cashew (sp.)‘

c. kambot ‗fireplace, firewood‘

kambotʃ-jum fireplace/firewood-AUG ‗gas stove‘

The palatalization before /i/ is a lexical rule, and before /j/ is a postlexical rule, as

shown in (19).
(19) a. i-bɯ-t 3-wife-POSS ‗his wife‘

b. i-mɯ- 3-father-POSS ‗his/her/its father‘

ibɯd imɯ ‗his father-in-law‘

c. je- 3.mother-POSS ‗his/her/its mother‘

ibɯtʃ je ‗his mother-in-law‘

A.10. R-deletion There are three suffixes that lose their initial /r/ when it follows a voiced coronal, as shown in (20). These suffixes are -ru ‗possessive‘, -rɯ ‗possessive‘ and -re ‗Adjectivizer‘.

(20) a. -ru

a-wokpa-ru 3-burp-POSS ‗his/her/its burp‘

b. -rɯ

i-ba-rɯ 3-older.sister.FE-POSS ‗her older sister‘

c. -re

to-wakpa-re T-burp-ADJR ‗characterized as having a burp‘

Deletion of the r is illustrated by the forms in (21).

118

(21) a. i-mul-u 3-cough-POSS ‗his/her/its cough‘
b. i-gunel-u 3-sweat-POSS ‗his/her sweat‘

e. i-dagin-u 3-whistle-POSS ‗his/her whistle‘
f. -eŋnaptal-ɯ1 3-nosedress-POSS ‗his/her nosedress‘
g. e-wel-ɯ 3-necklace-POSS ‗his/her necklace‘
h. tɯ-mul-e T-cough-ADJR ‗having a cough‘
i. t-apoel-e T-belligerence-ADJR ‗having a belligerent behavior‘
j. tɯ-dagin-e T-whistle-ADJR ‗characterized by whistling‘
k. to-worond-e T-word-ADJR ‗characterized as having words‘ (talking)
1 The suffix -rɯ was not found after nouns ended in /d/ and /n/.
119

A.11. Vowel Epenthesis
Vowel epenthesis occurs with the three suffixes mentioned in section A.10. The
vowel is inserted after voiced obstruents and nasals, except the coronals. The epenthetic
vowel is identical to the one in the suffix, as shown in (22)-(24).
(22) a. -eb-uru 3-smile-POSS ‗his/her/its smile‘
b. -amborog-uru 3-pendant-POSS ‗his/her/its pendant‘
c. -aborim-uru 3-arm-POSS ‗his/her/its arm‘
d. -eŋ-uru 3-eye-POSS ‗his/her/its eye‘
(23) a. -aŋ-ɯrɯ 3-worm-POSS ‗its worm‘
b. -arog-ɯrɯ 3-headdress-POSS ‗his/her headdress‘
c. i-b-ɯrɯ 3-arrow-POSS ‗his arrow‘
d. -erem-ɯrɯ 3-song-POSS ‗his/her/its song‘
(24) a. toŋnab-ere T.snore-ADJR ‗characterized by snoring‘

120

c. toŋ-ere T.eye-ADJR ‗characterized as having eyes‘ (awake)

A.12. T-deletion

A /t/ is deleted when it precedes a voiced coronal, as shown in (25). Compare the nouns in their simple or absolute forms with the ones inflected for possession.

(25) a. abat ‗manioc cake‘
b. omiat- ABST.hand-ABST ‗hand‘
c. kambot ‗fireplace, firewood‘

-aba-rɯ 3-manioc.cake-POSS ‗his/her/its manioc cake‘
-emia-rɯ 3-hand-POSS ‗his/her/its hand‘
