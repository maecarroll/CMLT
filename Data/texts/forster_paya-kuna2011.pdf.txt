ABSTRACT
The purpose of this grammar is to help any interested person learn to speak and understand Paya Kuna , which is spoken by the people of Paya, Pucuru, and Capetí in the Darién province of the Republic of Panama and in the Kuna settlements of Arquía and Kudi on the Colombian side of the border. This volume deals with some of the most basic characteristics of Kuna pronunciation and grammar, and it provides appendices on various topics and a fairly extensive Paya Kuna vocabulary. Many important characteristics are not discussed in this volume, but hopefully, after mastering these first twenty lessons the student will be equipped to continue self-directed language learning. The grammar was designed primarily for use in a classroom where the teacher is a native speaker of Kuna, but it also lends itself to learning Kuna in the informal situation of a Paya Kuna village. Each section is not meant to be covered in a single class period, but normally consists of a dialogue, pronunciation notes, notes on cultural etiquette, grammar aspects and exercises, and vocabulary items for memorization. Emphasis is put on learning by mimicking in chorus and alone until the speech patterns become automatic, thus, using a conversational approach to learning a language. An attempt is made throughout to not only explain and drill the forms discussed, but also to enable language students to know in which situational contexts their use is appropriate. An effort was also made to show the inseparability of the Kuna language from its socio-cultural context.

THE PAYA KUNA ALPHABET

To simplify reference, Paya Kuna will be referred to as ―Kuna.‖ For pedagogical purposes some modifications of the official Kuna alphabet have been employed in the spelling of Kuna words in the body of the text. In the vocabulary in Volume 3, if the official spelling differs from the practical one adopted for this grammar, it is given in square brackets.

1 BASIC GREETINGS AND TAKING LEAVE

1.1 Dialogue
When you first encounter a Kuna speaker, it is important to establish rapport. The first step is the use of greetings and leave-takings appropriate to the occasion. One of the common formats for greeting and leave-taking is given in this Dialogue.

Upon arrival: 1. Visitor: 2. Villager:
3. Visitor: 4. Villager: 5. Visitor: 6. Villager: 7. Visitor: Upon departure:

Anná.1 Mai./Chi.
An pe taktani. Ajáj. Toge. Nabiri. Chigwe. Nabiri.

‗Hello.‘ ‗I‘m home (masculine)./I‘m home (feminine).‘ (see I.D.1.) ‗I‘ve come to see you.‘ ‗Come in.‘ ‗Okay.‘ ‗Sit down.‘ ‗Okay.‘

8. Visitor: 9. Villager:

Nade. Eye.

‗I‘m going.‘ ‗Yes‘

1.2 Pronunciation
1.2.1 Intonation (Ex. 1–2) In learning another language as an adult, you will have to break one set of habits and acquire a new set as required by the new language. One of the first is intonation, the ―tune‖ of what is being said, since Kuna intonation differs from that of English or Spanish. Learning the intonation patterns is very important to your future control of the language. Learn them at the beginning so you do not have to unlearn wrong patterns later.
Exercise 1. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher (not another student) as he says Dialogue 1.1 by humming the intonation patterns (―tune‖).
Note: Humming the intonation patterns should be done before any attempt is made to master the individual (segmental) sounds.
Attention should be paid to pitch, intensity, rhythm, etc. In short, mimic everything you can say with your mouth still firmly shut! Further practice can be gained by mimicking the teacher under your breath, while he is working with other students. Do not mimic other students.
Exercise 2. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 1.1. Pronounce the individual sounds as best you can without 1) slowing down or, 2) losing the intonation pattern.
Note: If you have trouble with a particular sound, you should master the sound by using the drills designed specifically for the sound, not by trying to master it in the dialogue.

1 Stress or accent is not normally written in Kuna, but is marked here on some words to help the beginning student. 1

Basic Greetings And Taking Leave

1.2.2 Consonant pronunciation
The pronunciation of Kuna consonants is distinct from both English and Spanish. In English and Spanish, for example, the difference between b and p, d and t, and g and k is voicing. For example, contrast the two English words ‗bad‘ and ‗pat‘. Place a finger gently at your voice box (larynx) and say aloud the words ‗bad‘ and ‗pat‘ slowly. You will note that your voice box vibrates for all three sounds b, a, d, in the word ‗bad‘. For the word ‗pat‘ the voice box does not vibrate for the sounds p or t, but only for the sound a. That is to say, the vowel a, and the consonants b and d are voiced and, thus, contrast with p and t, which are not voiced (voiceless).
Now say the words ‗got‘ and ‗cot‘ with your finger on your larynx in the same manner as above. In this example, you will find that your voice box vibrates for g and o, but not for c or t. In other words, the English consonant g is voiced and the consonants c/k and t are voiceless.
In Kuna, however, the difference between the consonants b and p, d and t, and g and k is not voicing versus voicelessness, but rather a contrast between a gentle, relaxed way of holding the parts of the mouth which form the sounds versus a firm, tight way of doing so. Accordingly, consonants in Kuna are classified into two groups, lenis (relaxed) versus fortis (tight) consonants (see 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 for a more detailed description of fortis sounds).
Lenis consonants are written b, d, g, n, zh, r, l, m, and s.2 Lenis consonants in Kuna are pronounced by keeping the lips and tongue very relaxed. Outsiders, especially English speakers, tend to pronounce lenis consonants with the lips, tongue, or glottis quite taut or tight. Sometimes an outsider‘s vocal apparatus is so taut that the consonant produced is no longer lenis, and miscommunication may ensue.
1.2.3 Pronunciation of individual vowel and lenis consonant sounds
In order to speak Kuna fluently, it is important to be able to pronounce vowel and lenis consonant sounds well.

1.2.3.1 Pronunciation of vowels
Kuna has five vowels, a, e, i, o, and u. The pronunciation of the vowels is the same as the pronunciation of the vowels in Spanish. The sounds exist in English too.

Examples Kuna
1. nana 2. ege 3. ina 4. oba 5. ulu

‗mother‘ ‗to open‘ ‗medicine‘ ‗corn‘ ‗canoe‘

Spanish animal veo igual olvidar uva

‗animal‘ ‗I see‘ ‗equal‘ ‗to forget‘ ‗grape‘

English ahh! late beet open noodle

1.2.3.2 Pronunciation of the lenis consonants b, d, and g As with all lenis consonants, b, d and g are pronounced in a very gentle way with the vocal apparatus very relaxed.
1) The lenis consonant b
In Kuna, the b is very soft and gentle, similar to the Spanish b. It is formed by bringing the lips together in such a relaxed way and so gently that they barely touch, if indeed they touch at all. English speakers tend to make the sound b very hard when they see the written symbol or when they try to repeat a Kuna word. Practice saying a very relaxed b in the following exercise.
Exercise 3. Pronunciation of lenis b drill
The teacher says the word and the student repeats the word mimicking as closely as possible the teacher‘s pronunciation. This exercise may be repeated several times.

2 Labialized lenis consonants (dw, gw, mw and zw) are discussed in 4.2.3.

10. abe

2) The lenis consonant d
In Kuna, the lenis consonant d is also pronounced in a very relaxed way. The tongue is held very gently and it barely touches, if indeed it touches at all, the back of the teeth in the pronunciation of d. The point of contact, i.e., the point of articulation, is similar to that of the sound d in Spanish. The English point of articulation is the ridge behind the teeth and consequently English speakers must practice two new techniques in pronouncing the Kuna sound d, the relaxed tongue, and the dental point of articulation.

Practice saying a very relaxed d in the following exercise.

Exercise 4. Pronunciation of lenis d drill
The teacher says the word and the student repeats the word, mimicking as closely as possible the teacher‘s pronunciation. This exercise may be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: nade

5. ado

‗(yes) that‘s the one‘

3) The lenis consonant g
In Kuna, the lenis consonant g is also pronounced in a very relaxed way; the tongue barely touches the velum, if it touches at all. Practice saying a very relaxed g in the following exercise. Spanish speakers must practice making every g relaxed.

Exercise 5. Pronunciation of lenis g drill
The teacher says the word and the student repeats it, mimicking as closely as possible the teacher‘s pronunciation. This exercise may be repeated several times.

Exercise 6. Pronunciation of lenis g before vowels e and i
The teacher says the word and the student repeats it, mimicking as closely as possible the teacher‘s pronunciation. This exercise may be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: ege

Student: ege

1. ege

‗to open‘

2. age

6. ugin

‗in (the) nest‘

7. igi

‗how?‘

8. wegid

‗that kind‘

1.2.3.3 Vowel length
Now that you are hearing the gentle, relaxed way in which lenis consonants are pronounced, you will, with practice, begin to realize that the vowel preceding the lenis consonant tends to be held longer, or is more drawn out than other vowels. This drawing out of the vowel preceding a lenis consonant is called vowel length.

In syllables occurring after the stressed syllable, vowel length is not as noticeable as it is in the stressed or pre-stressed syllables.

In two and even three-syllable words, vowel length is easier to hear. In words of more than three syllables, vowel length is minimized to the point of non-existence due to the phenomenon of word timing, a characteristic of Kuna speech. The speaker attempts to complete the utterance of a word, whether it has two or eight syllables, in the same block of time so that short words are said rather slowly, while long, multi-syllable words are said very quickly. Thus, word timing allows for vowel length preceding lenis consonants in short two or three-syllable words, but words of four or more syllables are said so quickly that vowel length tends to disappear altogether.

The recognition of vowel length comes with practice and will be discussed again in 2.2.4. At this time, however, it will help you to pronounce words more correctly if you are aware of, and work toward, drawing out the vowels (lengthening them) before lenis consonants. In the following exercise, concentrate on vowel length preceding the lenis consonant.

Exercise 7. Vowel length before lenis consonants
The teacher says the word and the student repeats it, mimicking as closely as possible the teacher‘s pronunciation of the vowels. This exercise may be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: oba

Student: oba

1. oba

‗corn‘

2. iba

‗day‘

3. uba

Exercise 8. Vowel length
The teacher says at random the words listed in Exercises 3 through 6, and the student repeats the words, mimicking as closely as possible both the lenis consonant and the vowel length.

1.2.3.4 Pronunciation of the other lenis consonants n, zh, r, l and s The other lenis consonants n, zh, r, l, m, and s are also pronounced with a very relaxed vocal apparatus.

1) The lenis consonant n
In Kuna, the lenis consonant n is pronounced, as it is in Spanish, with the tongue at the back of the teeth. The position of the tongue in Kuna is different from the position used in the pronunciation of n in English. English speakers must practice the pronunciation of the Kuna n.

Exercise 9. Pronunciation of the lenis consonant n
The teacher says the words in the exercise and the student repeats them after the teacher, mimicking as well as possible the lenis consonant n.

Example Teacher: nana

Student: nana

1. nana

‗mother‘

2. nane

‗to walk‘

3. ono

‗to find‘

4. ina

‗medicine‘

5. nade

‗went‘

2) The lenis consonant zh
The lenis consonant zh is pronounced like the z in the English word ‗azure‘, the j in the French name Jacques ‗Jack‘, and the y of yo ‗I‘ in Argentinian Spanish.

Exercise 10. Pronunciation of the lenis consonant zh
Look at each of the following words as the teacher reads them. Mimic the teacher by reading each word after him.

Example Teacher: azhu

Student: azhu

1. azhu

‗nose‘

2. azha

‗dregs‘

3. ezha

‗machete‘

4. ozhi

‗pineapple‘

5. izhe

‗taboo‘

6. izho

‗to destroy‘

7. nuzha

‗egg‘

8. nuzhu

‗worm‘

9. uzhu

‗agouti‘

10. mazhi

‗plantains‘

3) The lenis consonant r
The lenis consonant r in Kuna is pronounced like the single r in Spanish, as found in the word caro ‗expensive‘. This flapped r is similar to the way in which some English speakers pronounce the tt in ‗matter‘ or ‗latter‘. The tongue very quickly and firmly touches the ridge behind the teeth.

6

Basic Greetings And Taking Leave

In some dialects of English, the speaker drops or barely pronounces a lenis r occurring at the end of a word or syllable. The speakers of that English dialect need to pay particular attention to the pronunciation of lenis r when it occurs word or syllable final.

The lenis consonant r sometimes is pronounced without any voicing. This makes it sound something like an l to English or Spanish speakers. This l is called a voiceless flapped l (written l).

Example nabiri or nabili

‗good/okay‘

Exercise 11. Pronunciation of the lenis consonant r
The teacher says the words in the exercise and the student repeats them after the teacher, mimicking as closely as possible the lenis consonant r.

Example Teacher: mara

Student: mara

1. mara

‗thunder‘

2. pure

‗to wrap around‘

3. turwa

‗rubbish‘

4. ira

‗hira palm‘

5. piri

‗top of ____‘

6. ire

‗to recede‘

7. yoroku

‗noon‘

Exercise 12. Pronunciation of word or syllable-final lenis r
The teacher says the words in the exercise and the student repeats them after the teacher, paying particular attention to pronounce correctly the lenis r at the end of the words or syllables.

Example Teacher: tar

Student: tar

1. tar

‗him‘

2. tiur

‗sabaletta (a species of fish)‘

3. chamur ‗intestines‘

4. arki

‗huacuco (a species of fish)‘

5. purwa

‗wind‘

6. turwa

‗rubbish‘

7. chapur

‗forest‘

4) The lenis consonants l, m, and s
In Kuna, the lenis consonant m is pronounced approximately as it is in English and Spanish. The position of the tongue in pronouncing s is more like English than Spanish; that is, the tip of the tongue is further back. On the other hand, the tongue tip touches the teeth in pronouncing l so that it is more like Spanish than English.

Exercise 13. Pronunciation of the lenis consonants l, m, and s
The teacher says the words in the exercise and the student repeats them after the teacher, mimicking as closely as possible the lenis consonants.

Example Teacher: mola

Student: mola

1. mola

‗cloth/blouse‘

2. olo

‗gold‘

3. ome

Exercise 15. Pronunciation of the semivowel w
The teacher says the following words and the student repeats each word after the teacher.

Example Teacher: wal Student: wal
1. wal 2. we 3. wini 4. welwel 5. waga 6. wawadun 7. urwe 8. ibiwa 9. aswe 10. chowal

1.3 Culture

1.3.1 Visiting
When you go visiting in a Kuna town, it is customary to call out at the door of the house and wait for an invitation before entering. The host or hostess will probably invite you to sit down. He/she will indicate where you are to sit (normally on a kana ‗bench‘). Visiting chiefs or male dignitaries may be invited to sit in (actually astride) a hammock. If you are not offered a seat, it means you are not welcome. You should make an attempt to either increase rapport or state your business right away, in spite of the cool reception. If you are accepted, you should exchange pleasantries before discussing business.

1.4 Grammar

1.4.1 Mai versus chi
In Paya Kuna4 there is a distinction made in the term used to refer to the location or presence of a man, versus the location or presence of a woman. The term mai ‗to be (here/there/at home)‘ is used by both men and women to refer to a man‘s presence, whereas the term chi ‗to be (here/there/at home)‘ is used by both men and women to refer to the presence of a woman (see 6.4.1). Thus, if you are a man and are referring to your own presence, you always use the term mai. If, however, you are a woman referring to your own presence, you will always use the term chi.

Examples 1. Mai. 2. Mai. 3. Chi. 4. Chi.

‗(I, a man) am (here/at home).‘ ‗(He) is (here/at home).‘ ‗(I, a woman) am (here/at home).‘ ‗(She) is (here/at home).‘

1.4.2 Use of personal pronouns
The first and second person personal pronouns an ‗I/me (direct object)‘ and pe ‗you‘ closely parallel the English use of personal pronouns.5 The first and second person plural pronouns anmal ‗we/us (direct object)‘ and pemal ‗you‘ also parallel English usage. The third person pronouns ad ‗he/she/it‘ or ‗him/her/it (direct object)‘ and amal ‗they/them (direct object)‘ have a more restricted use than in English. In the case of the early language learning process, however, ad ‗he/she/it‘ and amal ‗they‘ may be used as a third person pronoun in many situations. (The pronouns are discussed more completely in 20.4.)

Examples 1. An chi 2. An mai. 3. An pe taktani.

‗I (a lady) am (here).‘ ‗I (a man) am (here).‘ ‗I am coming to see you.‘

4 This distinction does not exist in San Blas Kuna. 5 The first person pronoun is actually ann (fortis nasal) or anni, but is written an wherever the shortened form occurs to conform to the spelling in general use.

2.2 Pronunciation

2.2.1 Intonation (Ex. 1–3)
Every time you say something, you say it with a ―tune‖ (intonation). Basic intonation patterns for statements, questions, commands, etc., should be automatic. The patterns become automatic only as you spend time mimicking the Kuna speakers with whom you come in contact.

Exercise 1. Intonation drill
First mimic the teacher as he says Dialogue 2.1 by humming the ―tune‖ (intonation patterns). Practice makes perfect. Mimic under your breath while the teacher works with other students.

Exercise 2. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 2.1, pronouncing the individual sounds as closely as possible without 1) slowing down, or 2) losing the intonation pattern.

Exercise 3. Intonation of ‗I want to ____.‘
Mimic the teacher by humming the intonation of the following:

1. An mas kumpi. 2. An mas pakpi. 3. An mas ukpi. 4. An mas tubi. 5. An mas chubi. 6. An kallin pakpi. 7. An nuzha pakpi. 8. An mol pakpi. 9. An kachi pakpi. 10. An ogob pakpi.

‗I want to eat food.‘ ‗I want to buy food.‘ ‗I want to sell food.‘ ‗I want to cook food.‘ ‗I want to fetch food.‘ ‗I want to buy a chicken.‘ ‗I want to buy eggs.‘ ‗I want to buy cloth/molas.‘ ‗I want to buy a hammock.‘ ‗I want to buy coconut(s).‘

In 1.2.2., the contrast between lenis consonants and fortis consonants was introduced. Fortis consonants in Kuna are written p, t, k, ch, mm, nn, ss, ll, and rr.7

2.2.3 Pronunciation of individual fortis consonant sounds (Ex. 4–8)
The parts of the vocal apparatus used in the pronunciation of fortis consonants are the same as those used for the lenis consonant counterparts. The difference in pronunciation lies in the fact that the vocal apparatus is kept very taut or tense in the pronunciation of fortis consonants. They are much stronger sounds than their lenis counterparts.

2.2.3.1 Pronunciation of fortis consonants p, t, k, and ch
The fortis consonants p, t, k, and ch are said in such a way that it almost sounds as though there is a pause or hesitation before the following vowel.

1) Pronunciation of the fortis consonant p
In Kuna, the fortis consonant p is a very strong, well-articulated, vigorous sound. The lips are held firmly together, and the p is said so strongly it almost ―pops‖. The p is still voiceless though, and is not aspirated (see discussion below on aspiration).

2) Pronunciation of the fortis consonant t
The fortis consonant t is a very strong, well-articulated sound. The tongue is held firmly against the back of the teeth. The t sound is almost spit out, it is so vigorous, but it is not aspirated.

3) Pronunciation of the fortis consonant k
The fortis consonant k is also a strong sound in which the tongue is held firmly against the velum; it is released very forcefully, but without aspiration.

4) Unaspirated stops p, t, and k
The fact that the fortis consonants p, t, and k are unaspirated is a potential problem for English speakers. Aspiration is the little puff of air English speakers use in saying the consonants p, t, and c/k in such words as ‗par‘ ‗tar‘ and ‗car‘. Aspiration of a consonant may be detected by dangling a thin piece of paper in front of the mouth as a word is said. The paper will flutter slightly if a puff of air was used in the pronunciation of the consonant, that is to say, if the consonant was aspirated. Generally the t in ‗star‘ is unaspirated for English speakers. Spanish speakers do not aspirate the consonants p, t, or k.

Exercise 4. Pronunciation of unaspirated fortis consonants p, t, and k
The teacher repeats the following words. The student holds a thin piece of paper in front of his mouth and repeats each word after the teacher. The student is to practice saying the words without making the paper flutter. Now the teacher will repeat the words in groups of three, reading across the columns. The student, still holding the piece of paper in front of his mouth, will repeat the groups of three words after the teacher.

Example 1 Teacher: paba

5) Pronunciation of the fortis consonant ch
In Kuna, the fortis consonant ch is a very vigorous sound made by holding the tongue in approximately the same position as for ch in English or Spanish. The sound is like that of an English-speaking child making the sound of a very energetic steam engine, ―CH-ch-ch-ch, CH-ch-ch-ch‖.

Exercise 5. Pronunciation of the fortis consonants p, t, k, and ch
The teacher says the word and the student repeats it, mimicking as closely as possible the teacher‘s pronunciation.

Example Teacher: napa

Student: napa

1. napa

‗earth‘

2. opas

‗crossed over (river)‘

3. mata

‗lake‘

4. iti

‗this‘

5. kaka

‗mouth‘

6. akan

‗axe‘

7. acha

‗honey‘

8. ochi

‗sweet‘

2.2.3.2 Pronunciation of the fortis consonants mm, nn, and ss The fortis consonants mm, nn, and ss are drawn out more, or held slightly longer than their lenis counterparts.

They are pronounced with very taut or tight vocal apparatus. The mm and ss use the same vocal apparatus as is used in the English m and s. Similarly to its lenis consonant counterpart, the nn is pronounced by placing the tongue tip at the back of the teeth rather than at the alveolar ridge as in English. As you learn to pronounce the fortis mm, nn, and ss, it might help to think in terms of your vocal apparatus getting ―stuck‖ on the sound for an instant before it can complete the word.

Exercise 6. Pronunciation of the fortis consonants mm, nn, and ss
The teacher says the word and the student repeats it, mimicking as closely as possible the teacher‘s pronunciation.

Example Teacher: amma

Student: amma

1. amma

‗aunt‘

2. mimmi ‗baby‘

3. inna

‗chicha‘

4. punnu

‗tail‘

5. panne

‗hummingbird‘

6. kissi

‗sap (of a tree)‘

2.2.3.3 Pronunciation of the fortis consonant ll The ll in Kuna is not pronounced as the ll of calle ‗street‘ in Spanish. Rather, it is pronounced as a very firm, vigorous l in Spanish, i.e., the tongue tip touches the teeth. In pronouncing the ll, the sound is drawn out, or ―stuck,‖ to the extent that there is almost a pause before the following vowel.
Exercise 7. Pronunciation of the fortis consonant ll
The teacher reads the list of words in the exercise and then reads each word again and the student repeats the word, mimicking as closely as possible the teacher‘s pronunciation.

2.2 Pronunciation

Example Teacher: alle

Student: alle

1. alle

2. olli

‗mud‘

3. melle

‗don‘t‘

4. ollo

‗empty‘

5. kullu

‗ravine/hollow‘

2.2.3.4 Pronunciation of the fortis consonant rr
In Kuna, the fortis consonant rr never occurs at the beginning of words. Although rr occurs in Spanish in such words as carro ‗car‘ and perro ‗dog‘, it is not used in English, and is, therefore, difficult for the English speaker to master. He usually refers to it as a rolled or trilled r. The time an English speaker comes closest to saying rr is when he is cold and exclaims, ―Br-r-r!‖, or when he is imitating a diesel truck and says, ―R-r-r-rum, r-r-r-rum!‖ It is best to practice saying rr in isolation first and then to practice saying it in words.

Exercise 8. Pronunciation of the fortis consonant rr
The teacher says a word from the list below and the student repeats it concentrating on rolling the rr.

Example Teacher: arri

Student: arri

1. arri

‗iguana‘

2. marra 3. irr-ir8

‗guava/jungle ice cream (a species of fruit)‘ ‗cricket‘

4. arrad

‗blue‘

5. orro

‗arrow‘

2.2.4 Vowel length (Ex. 9)
In 1.2.3.3, it is noted that in the case of a lenis consonant the vowel before it is drawn out, held, or lengthened. In the case of a fortis consonant, however, the vowel before it is not drawn out, that is, it is short. It is about the same as most English and Spanish vowels in normal speech. The vowel before a fortis consonant is always short, even if it is in a stressed syllable, or if it is in the syllable before a stressed syllable.

In order to know how long a vowel should be, train yourself to zero in on the following consonant. If the following consonant is a fortis consonant p, t, k, ch, mm, nn, ss, ll, or rr, the vowel will be short (that is to say a normal length). If the following consonant is a lenis consonant b, d, g, zh, m, n, s, l, or r or a semivowel j, w, or y, the vowel is lengthened.

Exercise 9. Pronunciation of short vowel preceding a fortis consonant.
The teacher reads aloud the list of words while the student reads along silently. The teacher then pronounces each word and the student repeats it after the teacher.

Example Teacher: apa

Student: apa

1. apa

‗boa‘

2. napa

‗earth‘

3. achu

‗dog‘

4. machi

‗boy‘

5. iti

‗this‘

6. mata

‗lake‘

8 Fortis consonants syllable and word final are written with a single symbol by convention.

2.2.5 Distinguishing between fortis and lenis consonants (Ex. 10–27)
The distinction between fortis and lenis consonants in normal conversation is often difficult to hear. Two clues may help:

a. The quality of the consonant Listen for the articulation of the consonant. Is it tense? The tense articulation indicates a fortis consonant. Is it relaxed? The relaxed articulation indicates a lenis consonant.
b. The quality of the vowel Listen for the vowel length. Is the vowel clipped short? A short vowel accompanies a fortis consonant. Is the vowel drawn out? A lengthened vowel usually accompanies a lenis consonant.

2.2.6 Consonant clusters (Ex. 28)
A consonant cluster in Kuna is a group of two consonants, usually different, occurring next to each other. Although ch, chw, dw, gw, kw, ll, mm, mw, nn, rr, ss, sw, tw, zh, and zhw are written as two or three consonants, they each represent a single sound and, consequently, are not referred to as consonant clusters.

In Paya Kuna, a consonant cluster is either lenis or fortis. If the first consonant of the cluster is lenis, the second is also lenis. If the first consonant is fortis, the second is also fortis. Consequently, most suffixes have both fortis and lenis forms.

Examples

1. mak + -bi/-pi = makpi

‗want to sew‘

but

2. tig + -bi/-pi = tigbi

‗want to plant‘

In the case of a consonant cluster which includes ll, mm, nn, rr, or ss, these fortis consonants are written with single rather than double letters. The accompanying fortis consonant indicates the l, m, n, r, or s to be a fortis sound. However, in the case of a stem-final fortis nn followed by a suffix initial n as in -ne ‗immediate future‘ the normal pronunciation is the same as for a single fortis nn. Thus, kunne may mean ‗going to eat‘ (kunn(e) ‗to eat‘ + -ne ‗immediate future‘) or ‗to eat‘. The context is usually adequate for determining which of the two meanings is intended.

Example 1 pinche

‗for nothing/in vain‘

The fortis consonant ch indicates to the reader that the n is actually the fortis consonant nn and that the vowel is short.

Example 2 pinzhe

‗to think‘

The lenis consonant zh indicates to the reader that the n is indeed the lenis consonant n and that the vowel is long.

2.3 Culture
When you arrive in a Kuna village, you should ask to see the chief before you conduct any business. If the chief is out of town, there is a designated replacement who should be seen. The chief should be:
1. told who you are. 2. told the purpose of your visit. 3. told whether you are there to represent your own business or the affairs of another. 4. told who sent you. (Any letter of introduction should be shown.) 5. told of any needs you have which the village can supply (housing, guides, etc.). 6. asked for permission before you carry on any negotiations in the village. In response to the above, the chief will designate people to help you or will advise you that you are at liberty to negotiate on your own. If something requires community approval, the chief will call a meeting. He will advise you of the decisions taken at the meeting.

2.4 Grammar

2.4.1 Word order (Ex. 29–30)
Most languages allow for some variation in the normal word order for specific reasons. In Kuna, the normal word order is different from Spanish or English. Normal word order in the transitive sentence is subject, object, predicate.

Example

Subject

Object

An

ogob

I

coconut

‗I want to eat coconut.‘

Predicate kumpi. eat-want-to

Exercise 29. Word order -- object substitution drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the class repeats it. The teacher says Sentence 2 and the class repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

‗I want to buy a chicken.‘ ‗I want to buy eggs.‘ ‗I want to buy cloth.‘ ‗I want to buy a hammock.‘ ‗I want to buy coconuts.‘ ‗I want to eat plantains.‘ ‗I want to eat fish.‘ ‗I want to eat meat.‘ ‗I want to eat manioc.‘ ‗I want to eat an avocado.‘

In forming words, it is important to realize that if certain consonants occur before certain other consonants, the first consonant changes: n (nn: see section 2.2.6) becomes m if it occurs before p.

Example kun + -pi = kumpi Note 2: Concept of Plural

‗want to eat‘

In Spanish and English, in most cases, the speaker must distinguish between singular and plural, e.g., the speaker must choose between boy and boys, egg and eggs, etc. In Kuna, this is not so. The speaker does not need to distinguish (and generally does not distinguish) between singular and plural. The concept of plural and the means of distinguishing plural from singular is dealt with in Lesson 13.4.3.

Exercise 30. Direct object substitution drill
The teacher repeats the frame and then says any word from the list below. The student then substitutes the word in the frame.

2.4.2 Desiderative (Ex. 31–35)
Desires can be divided into two areas. One either wants to do something (desiderative action) or wants to have something (desiderative state).

2.4.2.1 Desiderative action In Kuna, the desire to do something is expressed by adding the suffix -bi/-pi to the verb. An + (noun)9 + verb + -bi/-pi ‗I want to ____.‘

Example

An

ogob

I

coconut

‗I want to eat coconuts.‘

kumpi. eat-want-to

Exercise 31. Desiderative action frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the class repeats it. The teacher says Sentence 2 and the class repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Examples Teacher: An ogob kumpi. Student: An ogob kumpi. Teacher: An ogob tigbi. Student: An ogob tigbi.
1. An ogob kumpi. 2. An ogob tigbi. 3. An ogob chubi. 4. An ogob chikpi. 5. An ogob pakpi.

‗I want to eat a coconut.‘ ‗I want to plant a coconut.‘ ‗I want to fetch a coconut.‘ ‗I want to cut a coconut.‘ ‗I want to buy a coconut.‘

3.2 Pronunciation

3.2.1 Intonation (Ex. 1–2) As you learn to speak Kuna, it is important that you learn to mimic the intonation of a Kuna speaker. The correct intonation pattern becomes automatic as you spend time with Kuna people, listening for the way they say sentences and trying to mimic them. Do the following exercises, listening carefully to the intonation patterns of the questions and answers, and mimicking the intonation as closely as possible.
Exercise 1. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher as he says Dialogue 3.1 by humming the intonation. Especially concentrate on the intonation patterns of the questions and answers.
Overlearn: Mimic under your breath while the teacher works with other students.
Exercise 2. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher in the above dialogue, formulating the individual sounds as closely as possible without 1) slowing down, or 2) losing the intonation pattern.

3.2.2 Pronunciation of consonant cluster with lenis consonant g or fortis consonant k before nasals m and n (Ex. 3)
The nasals m and n following a lenis consonant g do not change the quality of the g, The g is still said in a relaxed, soft manner and the preceding vowel is lengthened.

Examples chig + -ne = chigne tig + -mal = tigmal

‗going to sit‘ ‗(they) plant‘

10 oi is pronounced like oy in ‗boy‘ in English or like ‗hoy‘ ‗today‘ in Spanish. Igi ‗how‘ is contracted to ig in this greeting. 24

3.2 Pronunciation

25

The nasals m and n following a fortis consonant k, however, change the quality of the k. The k remains a fortis sound but is pronounced as a hard g sound. The hard g sound is used in the English word ‗bigness‘ and in the Spanish word gorra ‗cap‘. In the case of a consonant cluster of k before nasals m and n, the vowel preceding the cluster is short. In this way the identity of the fortis k is clarified.

Examples chik + -ne = chikne pak + -mal = pakmal

‗going to cut‘ ‗(they) buy‘

Exercise 3. Pronunciation of consonant cluster lenis g or fortis k and nasals m or n
The teacher reads through the list of words aloud while the student reads the words silently. The teacher reads each word and the student mimics the teacher, being careful to pronounce as closely as possible the lenis g and fortis k before the nasals m and n.

Example Teacher: chikne

Student: chikne

1. chikne

‗going to cut‘

2. chigne

‗going to sit down‘

3. makne

‗going to sew‘

4. magne

‗going to paint‘

5. chikmal

‗(they) cut‘

6. chigmal

‗(they) sit (down)‘

7. makmal

‗(they) sew‘

8. magmal

‗(they) paint‘

3.2.3 Intonation patterns of questions and answers (Ex. 4–10) In Kuna, questions and answers have different intonation patterns.

3.4.2.2 Intonation pattern of answers As you get into the Kuna language and people try to get to know you, you will find that your early conversations are primarily question and answer interactions. Both the questions and the answers in Kuna have specific intonation patterns. For the purpose of these lessons, consider the normal pitch to be that of a statement.
Exercise 4. Answer intonation drill
The teacher says Dialogue 3.1 and the student reads the dialogue, humming the intonation quietly as the teacher reads aloud. Pay special attention to the intonation and pitch of the answers.

3.2.3.2 Intonation pattern of questions
A question has a different intonation pattern from a statement. The actual order of words in a question which requires a yes/no answer is the same order as for a statement. Because the word order does not vary, it is important that you learn the intonation patterns for questions versus statements in order to distinguish a question from an answer.

In Kuna, the pitch at which the question is said is higher than the pitch of a statement. The last word of a question is even higher pitch than the rest of the question and then the pitch of that word falls off quickly.

Exercise 5. Yes/no question intonation drill
Mimic the intonation of the teacher by humming the the intonation of the following questions.

1. ¿Pe mas chikne? 2. ¿Pe mol pakne? 3. ¿Pe ogob tigne? 4. ¿Pe ua tune? 5. ¿Machi ob kunne? 6. ¿Machi chowal chikne?

‗Are you going to cut plantains?‘ ‗Are you going to buy cloth?‘ ‗Are you going to plant the coconut?‘ ‗Are you going to cook the fish?‘ ‗Is the boy going to eat the corn?‘ ‗Is the boy going to cut the firewood?‘

26

Conversational Replies

Exercise 6. Yes/No question intonation pattern drill
The teacher drills the class using Sentences 1–5 below as yes/no questions.

Example Teacher: ¿Machi ob kunne?

Student: ¿Machi ob kunne?

1. ¿Machi ob kunne?

‗Is the boy going to eat corn?‘

2. ¿Machi mas chikne?

‗Is the boy going to cut plantains?‘

3. ¿Machi immal amine?

‗Is the boy going to hunt (something)?‘

4. ¿Machi ina komne?

‗Is the boy going to drink the medicine?‘

5. ¿Machi ul chune?

‗Is the boy going to fetch the canoe?‘

Note: The lenis consonant b becomes m when it occurs before n

Example kob + -ne = komne

‗going to drink‘

Exercise 7. Statement intonation pattern drill
The teacher drills the students using Sentences 1–5 below as statements.

Example Teacher: Machi ob kunne. Student: Machi ob kunne.
1. Machi ob kunne. 2. Machi mas chikne. 3. Machi immal amine. 4. Machi ina komne. 5. Machi ul chune.

‗The boy is going to eat corn.‘ ‗The boy is going to cut plantains.‘ ‗The boy is going to hunt (something).‘ ‗The boy is going to drink the medicine.‘ ‗The boy is going to fetch the canoe.‘

Exercise 8. Question and statement contrast
The teacher says one of the sentences above. The student has to identify whether the teacher has uttered a question or a statement and writes ―question‖ or ―statement‖ on his answer sheet.

Examples Teacher (says):

¿Machi immal amine?

Student (writes):

question

Teacher (says):

Machi mas chikne.

Student (writes):

statement

If difficulty is experienced by the student in hearing the differences in the exercise, then the student should

practice Exercise 9.

Exercise 9. Question and statement contrast
The student should listen while the teacher repeats Sentences 1–5 in Exercise 6 above. The teacher then inserts the following sentence between Sentences 4 and 5 as a statement (A) or as a question (B). The student has to tell the teacher which has been used -- a question or a statement. The exercise should be repeated several times.

A. Machi ua makne. B. ¿Machi ua makne?

‗The boy is going to spear fish.‘ ‗Is the boy going to spear fish?‘

Exercise 10. Question and statement contrast
Repeat Exercise 9 using the statements in Exercise 7. Again, the student needs to distinguish whether the statement (A) or the question (B) has been inserted.

Note: After Exercises 9 and 10 are successfully completed, Exercise 8 should be repeated.

3.2.4 Pronunciation of consonants at the beginning of a word
At the beginning of a word, the difference between fortis and lenis disappears. For convenience we have written the consonants as p, t, k, ch, m, n, l, and s.

3.3 Culture

27

Examples

1. paba

‗father‘

2. tada

‗grandfather/elder‘

3. kobe

‗to drink‘

4. chobe

‗to make‘

5. sagla

‗chief‘

6. mama

‗manioc‘

7. nana

‗mother‘

8. lele

‗shaman (uses black magic)‘

Note: The lenis consonant r does not occur at the beginning of words.

3.2.5 Pronunciation of monosyllabic words (Ex. 11)
Monosyllabic words are words which have only one syllable. Kuna words which are made up of only one vowel and one consonant, or of only one vowel are pronounced by lengthening the vowel. When such monosyllabic words are said in isolation or at the end of a sentence, the tone slides down (down glides).

Examples 1. ti 2. an 3. u

‗water‘ ‗branch‘ ‗nest‘

Exercise 11. Pronunciation of monosyllabic words
The teacher says a word from the list below, and the student repeats the word after the teacher, mimicking as closely as possible the down glide in these monosyllabic words.

Example
1. ti 2. no 3. ka 4. pe 5. ku 6. ma 7. ne 8. ni 9. po 10. tu 11. a 12. e 13. u

Teacher: ti Student: ti
‗water‘ ‗frog‘ ‗hot peppers‘ ‗you‘ ‗louse‘ ‗to peck‘ ‗Go!‘ ‗moon‘ ‗to cry‘ ‗(species of) armadillo‘ ‗that‘ ‗his/her/its‘ ‗nest‘

3.3 Culture
When people first meet, there is usually an exchange of questions which helps the people become acquainted. Cultures differ as to the questions which may be politely asked in such a situation.
Questions about where you have come from and where you are going are quite acceptable in Kuna. The question, ―When are you leaving?‖ is also often asked. That question does not have the same negative connotation it does in English, but rather implies the idea of, ―How long are you staying?‖ Questions concerning your parents, brothers and sisters, and wife/husband and children are bound to follow.

28

Conversational Replies

In Kuna, it is quite acceptable to ask the price of items bought. If the item was a gift there is no need to disclose the value.
Great care should be taken when inquiring about the success of a hunting or fishing trip. Direct questions concerning the kill or the catch may be interpreted as a request/demand to share in the proceeds. It is much more acceptable to ask what happened on the trip than to ask what was killed or caught.

3.4 Grammar

3.4.1 Yes/No questions
As stated in 3.2.3.2, the order of words in a question requiring an eye ‗yes‘ or chuli ‗no‘ answer is the same as the order of the words in a statement. In conversation, a question is distinguished from a statement by intonation. In writing, a question is distinguished from a statement by punctuation (question marks).

Example ¿Pe mas tune?

‗Are you going to cook?‘

3.4.2 Verb tense aspect - immediate future (Ex. 12–16)
When an event is viewed by the speaker as being imminent (the action will undoubtedly take place), the tense-aspect11 used is called the immediate future. In using the immediate future, keep two things in mind: the immediate future suffix is added to the verb and a time reference must be either stated or implied.

3.4.2.1 Immediate future suffix The immediate future is formed by adding the suffix -ne to the verb stem.

Example kun + -ne = kunne

‗going to eat‘

The Kuna immediate future parallels the English construction ‗going to...‘ and the Spanish construction ‗ir a...‘.

Example An ua kunne.

‗I am going to eat fish.‘

Exercise 12. Immediate future frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the class repeats it. The teacher says Sentence 2 and the class repeats it, etc. The exercise should be repeated several times.

Examples Teacher: Machi ob tigne. Student: Machi ob tigne. Teacher: Machi ob emine. Student: Machi ob emine.
1. Machi ob tigne. 2. Machi ob emine. 3. Machi ob weine. 4. Machi ob chune. 5. Machi ob kunne.

‗The boy is going to plant corn.‘
‗The boy is going to weed corn.‘
‗The boy is going to plant corn.‘ ‗The boy is going to weed corn.‘ ‗The boy is going to harvest corn.‘ ‗The boy is going to fetch corn.‘ ‗The boy is going to eat corn.‘

Exercise 13. Immediate future frame drill
The teacher repeats the frame and selects any word from the list below and says it. The student then substitutes the word in the frame.

11 Most tense-aspect suffixes in Kuna indicate primarily the duration, rather than the time, of an action. For convenience, they are termed ―tense-aspect‖ or frequently, simply as ―aspect.‖

Exercise 14. Immediate future varied substitution frame drill
The teacher repeats the frame, selects a word from the list below which can be substituted in the frame and says it. The student then substitutes the word in the correct place in the frame. Random choices of a noun or a verb by the teacher is important.

Examples Teacher: An ogob pakne.

Teacher: ua

Student: An ua pakne.

Teacher: An ua pakne.

Teacher: kun

Student: An ua kunne.

Frame An ogob pakne.

2. kallin

‗chicken‘

3. ua

‗fish‘

‗I am going to buy coconuts.‘ ‗fish‘ ‗I am going to buy fish.‘ ‗I am going to buy fish.‘ ‗to eat‘ ‗I am going to eat fish.‘ ‗I am going to buy coconuts.‘

3.4.2.2 Time reference with the immediate future A time reference which may be implied or specified, is needed in the use of the immediate future.

1) Implied time reference
In the case of the implied (unspecified) time reference, the listener understands the time to be the time the speaker made his statement. The preceding examples and exercises fall into this category.

Example An ua pakne.

‗I am going to buy fish.‘

In this example, the listener understands that the speaker is going to buy fish right now (at this time of speaking).

30

Conversational Replies

2) Specified time reference
The speaker must specify the time an action will take place, if the action is not going to take place at the time he is speaking. This is done by the use of a time word at the beginning of the sentence.

Example Pan an mol makne.

‗Tomorrow I am going to sew a blouse.‘

Exercise 15. Time reference varied substitution frame drill
The teacher repeats the frame and selects any word from the list below and says it. The student substitutes the word in the frame.

Examples Teacher: An mol makne.

‗I am going to sew a blouse.‘

Teacher: pan

‗tomorrow‘

Student: Pan an mol makne. ‗Tomorrow I am going to sew a blouse.‘

Teacher: An mol makne.

‗I am going to sew a blouse.‘

Teacher: achul

‗day after tomorrow‘

Student: Achul an mol makne. ‗The day after tomorrow I am going to sew a blouse.‘

Frame An mol makne.

‗I am going to sew a blouse.‘

1. kujal

‗later‘

2. chedo

‗in the afternoon‘

3. wakur

4. yoroku

‗at noon‘

5. pan

‗tomorrow‘

6. achul

‗day after tomorrow‘

Exercise 16. Immediate future drill
The teacher gives the stimulus in the desiderative form. The student replies in the form of a statement using the -ne form. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: An ob kumpi. Student: An ob kunne.
1. Pan an ob tigbi. 2. Achul an ob emibi. 3. Kujal an ob pakpi. 4. Yoroku an ob chubi. 5. Pan an ob weibi.

‗Tomorrow I want to plant corn.‘ ‗Day after tomorrow I want to weed corn.‘ ‗Later I want to buy corn.‘ ‗At noon I want to fetch corn.‘ ‗Tomorrow I want to harvest corn.‘

3.4.3 Intransitive sentence word order
In Kuna, the normal word order for an intransitive sentence is subject, then predicate. This is similar to the word order in intransitive sentences in English.

Example

Subject

Predicate

An

abarmane.

I

run-going-to

‗I am going to run.‘

3.4.4 Long and short forms of words
Many (but not all) Kuna words have a short form and a long form. The short form of a word is made by dropping the final vowel.

3.4 Grammar

31

A few short forms end in one of the fortis consonants which is represented by a double symbol, such as nn. By convention, a single symbol is used to represent the word final fortis consonant in cases in which the double symbol is used in other positions in the word.

zh/ch become ss/s respectively, in word final position (4.2.5), but both are written s.

Examples

1. b

3.4.5 Contrast of subject As you begin hearing and using Kuna, you may notice that a Kuna person sometimes adds the suffix -din2 to pronouns, proper names and nouns. This suffix is used to mark a change or a contrast of subjects (see Appendix E).

3.4.5.1 Change of subject
A common use of the change of subject suffix is the exchange of greetings. One person may ask, ―How are you?‖ Then the other person answers, ―I am fine. How are you?‖ In this case, the you refers back to the first speaker. The subject of the dialogue has changed. A Kuna speaker would signal such a change of subject by the use of the suffix -din.

Example Visitor : Villager:

¿Pe igi oipos? Ampala. ¿Pedin?

‗How are you this morning?‘ ‗So-so. And you?‘

3.4.5.2 Contrast of subject Kunas also use the suffix -din/-tin to mark a contrast between what two subjects are doing.

Example Machidin ua makne.

‗On the one hand, the boy is going to spear fish.‘

Omedin ua tune.

‗On the other hand, the woman is going to cook fish.‘

1 Helps for distinguishing between short and long fortis consonants at the end of words are given in 4.2.2. 2 -din becomes -tin after a fortis consonant.

4 QUESTIONS

4.1 Dialogue

Question words are extremely useful in finding your way among strangers in a new place. When you have only partial control of the language, you can question someone until you fully understand what they have been saying. By fully using the question words—several of which are included in Dialogue 4.1—you can continue a conversation for a reasonable time, even though you have very little control of the language. They also help the language learner to become better acquainted with the language and culture.

Wife to her husband about visitors in their village:

1. Wife: 2. Husband: 3. Wife: 4. Husband: 5. Wife: 6. Husband: 7. Wife: 8. Husband: 9. Wife: 10. Husband: 11. Wife:

¿Toa noni? Waga. Mmm. ¿Inkwa noni? Immis. Immis. ¿Ibi pei? Chuli. Kinki pakcha. Mmm. ¿Igi mani? An wichul. ¿Pia pakcha? Teal. Mmm.

‗Who has arrived?‘ ‗An outsider!‘ ‗Hmm. When did he arrive?‘ ‗Today./Just now.‘ ‗Oh, today. What does he want?‘ ‗Nothing. He bought a gun.‘ ‗Hmm. How much?‘ ‗I don‘t know.‘ ‗Where did he buy it?‘ ‗Downriver.‘ ‗Hmm.‘

4.2 Pronunciation

4.2.1 Intonation (Ex. 1–2) In section 3.2.3 the intonation pattern of questions requiring yes/no answers is discussed. Other types of questions are discussed in this lesson (see 4.4.3 for grammatical explanations). Become familiar with the correct intonation of questions by doing the following exercises.15
Exercise 1. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 4.1 by humming the intonation. Pay special attention to acknowledgement of the answer to a question.
Exercise 2. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 4.1, formulating the individual sounds as closely as possible without 1) slowing down, or 2) losing the intonation pattern.

4.2.2 Pronunciation of consonants at the end of words (Ex. 3)
Most of the time, the fortis and lenis difference between consonants at the end of words is maintained. Often, however, it is very difficult to hear.

Examples 1. nab 3. tub

‗gourd‘ ‗rope/thread‘

2. nap 4. tup

‗earth‘ ‗island‘

15 Since most intonation patterns are quite difficult to describe adequately and there is a great deal of variation according to the focus of emphasis of an individual speaker, we have not described most of the patterns, but emphasized mimicking the teacher or a tape for acquiring good intonation.
33

34

Questions

Suggestions to help distinguish lenis from fortis consonants at the ends of words are:

Suggestion 1: Listen carefully to the vowel before the consonant. The vowel before a lenis consonant is longer than the vowel before a fortis consonant.

Suggestion 2: Listen to the long form of the word (see 3.4.4) in order to help clarify whether the final consonant is lenis or fortis.

Examples

1a. nab

naba

‗gourd‘

b. nap

napa

‗earth‘

2a. tag

tage

‗to come‘

b. tak

take

‗to see‘

3a. an

ana

‗branch‘

b. an

anni

‗I‘

Suggestion 3: At the end of words, lenis sounds are made in a relaxed way and fortis sounds are made in a tense way. By watching the speaker‘s mouth, you will get a clue to the identity of the final lenis or fortis consonant. For example, watch the speaker‘s mouth as he says the word nab ‗gourd‘, and then as he says the word nap ‗earth‘. The b of nab is said with relaxed lips and they barely close at the end of the word. The p of nap is said with tense, tight lips which snap shut.

Exercise 3. Pronunciation of word-final consonants
The teacher reads aloud at random one of the following words. Without looking at the book, the student says/writes whether the final consonant is fortis or lenis. The lesson may be repeated with the student writing down the final letter of each word read by the teacher.

Example Teacher: tub

Student: lenis/b

1. tub

‗rope/thread‘

3. nab

‗gourd‘

5. nag

‗foot‘

7. mag

‗to paint‘

9. tag

‗to come‘

2. tup 4. nap 6. nak 8. mak 10. tak

‗island‘ ‗earth‘ ‗mouth of river‘ ‗to sew‘ ‗to see‘

4.2.3 Pronunciation of labialized consonants (Ex. 4–7)
There are seven labialized consonants: kw, gw, tw, dw, chw, zhw, and mw. These are not considered to be consonant clusters, but rather to constitute single sounds. Kw and gw are fairly frequent, the others are very rare. The labialized consonants only occur at the beginning of a syllable. There are equivalents for most of the labialized consonant sounds in both English and Spanish.

4.2.3.1 Pronunciation of labialized consonants for English speakers 1. kw is pronounced like qu in ‗quiet/quick‘. 2. gw is pronounced like gu in ‗language‘. 3. tw is pronounced like tw in ‗tweet‘. 4. dw is pronounced like dw in ‗dwarf‘. 5. chw is pronounced like tu in ‗actual‘. 6. zhw is pronounced like su in ‗casual‘. 7. mw does not occur in English, but there should be no difficulty in producing this sound.

4.2 Pronunciation

35

4.2.3.2 Pronunciation of labialized consonants for Spanish speakers
In order to find an equivalent to the Kuna labialized consonants, the u in the following Spanish examples must be treated virtually as an onglide, rather than as a full vowel. The onglide sound may be achieved by pronouncing the Spanish examples fairly quickly:

1. kw is pronounced almost like cu in cuarto ‗room‘. 2. gw is pronounced almost like gu in agua ‗water‘. 3. tw is pronounced almost like tu in santuario ‗sanctuary‘. 4. dw is pronounced almost like du in Eduardo ‗Edward‘. 5. chw is pronounced almost like chu in tachuela ‗tack‘. 6. zhw does not occur in Spanish. 7. mw is pronounced almost like mu in muebles ‗furniture‘. Note: The difference between gwa and wa is often difficult for a Spanish speaker to control. For that reason, gwa and wa are drilled in the following exercises.

Exercise 4. gwa versus wa distinction drill
The teacher says the list of words inserting either A: ibiwa or B: ibigwa in position 5. The student must say whether choice A or choice B was inserted. The drill should be repeated several times.

1. piawa 2. turwa 3. purwa 4. tewa 5. A or B 6. owanma

‗Where has it gone to?‘ ‗rubbish‘ ‗wind‘ ‗perhaps‘

A: ibiwa B: ibigwa

‗to shiver/shake‘

‗for what reason?‘ ‗how many days?‘

Exercise 5. gwa versus wa distinction drill
The teacher says the list of words inserting either A: ibiwa or B: ibigwa in position 5. The student must say whether choice A or choice B was inserted. The drill should be repeated several times.

1. akwa 2. pukwa 3. purkwal 4. kollogwad 5. A or B 6. chibugwad

‗rock/stone‘

A: ibiwa

‗to be sitting (plural - see 13.4.3.2)‘

‗paralyzed‘

‗yellow‘

‗the white ones‘

‗for what reason?‘ B: ibigwa ‗how many days?‘

Exercise 6. gwa versus wa distinction drill
The teacher dictates a random listing of the words in Exercises 4 and 5 and the student writes whether the word contains a gwa or a wa.

Exercise 7. wa pronunciation drill
Practice reading aloud the following words, having the teacher check your performance.

1. wala 2. waga 3. wawadun 4. wanagak 5. walpa 6. piawa 7. turwa 8. purwa

‗trunk‘ ‗outsider‘ ‗bananas‘ ‗door‘ ‗three‘ ‗Where has it gone to?‘ ‗rubbish/sweepings‘ ‗wind/clouds‘

4.2.4 Pronunciation of transitional w In many dialects of Kuna, there tends to be a transitional w sound when the vowels u or o are followed by the vowels a or e
ua ‗fish‘ is pronounced uwa. ue ‗hot‘ is pronounced uwe. toa ‗Who?/Whom?‘ is pronounced towa. koe ‗deer‘ is pronounced kowe.

4.2.5 Fluctuation and phonological changes of fricatives, affricates and the semi-vowel j
The fricatives and affricates in Kuna are ch, zh, s, ss and the semi-vowel j. There is fluctuation between them according to the preference of the speaker, their position in the word or syllable, or the other consonant in the cluster. Following are some of the general rules governing the fluctuation of these consonants.

4.2.5.1 ch/s word initial
There is fluctuation between the use of ch and s at the beginning of a word. Some general rules will help clarify their use.

Rule 1: Where there is fluctuation between ch/s word initially, the generally preferred pronunciation for a word or sense of a word has been chosen as the criteria for determining the correct spelling of the word.

Rule 2: Almost all words are written with ch word initially on the basis of Rule 1.

Example chuli

‗no‘

Rule 3: If the first vowel in a word is an a, the preceding fricative is often written s.

Example sate/chage

‗nothing‘

Rule 4: In some cases where a word beginning with ch/s has two distinct meanings, the distinction is

made more clear by retaining an initial ch for one meaning and s for the other.

Examples sagla/chagla

‗chief/hair‘

sagla ‗chief‘ is the preferred spelling (although chagla ‗chief‘ is also correct).

chagla ‗hair‘ is the preferred spelling (although sagla ‗hair‘ is also correct).

Rule 5: Some words are always pronounced and written with an s word initially.

Example sae

‗yesterday‘

Rule 6: Some words are always written with an s word initially, according to their preferred pronunciation.

Example sabured

‗skirt‘

4.2.5.2 ch/zh syllable final ch and zh become ss and s, respectively, at the end of a syllable and are both written s in this position.
nuzhu becomes nus ‗worm‘ in its short form. ochi ‗sweet‘ becomes ostigid ‗a sweetened thing/sugar‘. Note: In the case of ostigid ‗a sweetened thing/sugar‘, one knows that the s is actually a fortis ss because the following consonant t is fortis and therefore, the s is also fortis.

4.2.5.3 Addition of suffixes which begin with a fricative/affricate/semi-vowel j Suffixes beginning with ch/zh/j are added to words according to the following rules.

4.4 Grammar

37

Rule 1: The form of a suffix beginning with ch/zh/j varies according to the particular final consonant or vowel which occurs in the word in which the suffix is added. The ch form of the suffix is added to a word ending in a fortis consonant.
Example nap ‗earth‘ + -che = napche ‗to the earth‘ The zh form of the suffix is added to a word ending in a lenis consonant.
Example neg ‗house‘ + -zhe = negzhe ‗to the house‘ The j form of the suffix is added to a word ending in a vowel.
Example ya ‗hole‘ + -je = yaje ‗to the hole‘
Rule 2: If the addition of a suffix results in bringing any two fricatives or a fricative and affricate together, the two parts contract to ch.
Example wis ‗to know‘ + chuli ‗no‘ = wichuli ‗don‘t know‘
Note: It should be noted that although suffixes that begin with ch are common in the Paya Kuna dialect, the cognate forms usually begin with s in the San Blas and Bayano dialects. In those dialects, ch sometimes occurs intervocalically, but j never occurs.
4.3 Culture
In Kuna, if someone answers a question you have asked, it is polite to acknowledge the answer before you ask another question. Such expressions as ajáj, aaaa, eye ‗yes‘, are used to acknowledge the answer to a question (see 11.4.3.1).
Most Kunas have a Spanish name and a Kuna name; they prefer to use their Spanish names with outsiders and for doing business. If you are referring to a Kuna while you are in conversation with someone, or if you need to attract the attention of a Kuna, it is more polite to refer to him by his role in society (e.g., sagla ‗chief‘) or by his kinship to someone (e.g., Luis pab ‗Louis‘ father‘, Alvaro machi ‗Alvaro‘s son‘), than directly by name. It is not polite to ask someone his Kuna name. Even if you know an individual‘s Kuna name, you should use his Spanish name to refer to him. Only if/when in conversation with you, the Kuna people refer to someone by his Kuna name, are you at liberty to use his Kuna name.
4.4 Grammar
4.4.1 Verb tense in completive aspect When an event is viewed by the speaker as being completed, i.e., the action has been finished, the aspect used is called the completive. This aspect roughly parallels the English past tense and the Spanish tiempo preterito. In using the completive aspect, you must keep in mind 1) the form of the verb used, and 2) that the time reference must be either stated or implied.
4.4.2 Verb form in completive aspect (Ex. 8–10) The completive aspect is formed by adding one of the following four forms of the completive suffix to the verb stem.
-cha follows a fortis consonant. -zha follows a lenis consonant. -s follows a vowel. It may be word final or followed by other suffixes. -ja follows a vowel preceding certain suffixes such as -l ‗when‘, -n(a) ‗contrary to fact‘, or -d ‗nominalizer‘.

4.4.3 Content Questions (Ex. 11–18)
Content questions are questions which require something other than yes/no answers (see 3.2.3.2). The information required is signalled in English by a question word such as ―Who?,‖ ―What?,‖ ―When?,‖ etc. In Kuna, there are three types of content questions: amplificatory questions, topic-establishing questions, and confirmation questions.

4.4.3.1 Amplificatory questions
Amplificatory questions are asked about a topic that may be already under discussion, or so obvious that it requires no introduction. Most of the time, more information is being sought about the action referred to in the discussion at hand. For example, the questioner may want to know who did the action, or when the action happened. In dealing with amplificatory questions, two things must be remembered: the intonation pattern of the question and the formation of the question.

1) Intonation pattern of amplificatory questions
Amplificatory questions have a characteristic intonation pattern. Do the following exercise to familiarize yourself with this pattern.

Exercise 11. Intonation of amplificatory questions drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the class repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the class repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example

Teacher: ¿Pia ne? Student: ¿Pia ne?

40

Questions

1. ¿Pia ne? 2. ¿Ibi chobzha? 3. ¿Igi choge? 4. ¿Toa noni? 5. ¿Inkwa noni?

‗Where are/is (you/he) going?‘ ‗What did (you/he) make?‘ ‗What (how) do/does (you/he) say?‘ ‗Who arrived?‘ ‗When did (you/he) arrive?‘

2) Form of amplificatory questions
To form an amplificatory question, the appropriate question word is used and the verb about which more information is wanted is repeated. The subject is usually omitted.

Exercise 12. Amplificatory questions frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the class repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the class repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Examples Teacher: ¿Toa chikcha? Student: ¿Toa chikcha? Teacher: ¿Ibi chikcha? Student: ¿Ibi chikcha?
1. ¿Toa chikcha? 2. ¿Ibi chikcha? 3. ¿Inkwa chikcha? 4. ¿Pia chikcha? 5. ¿Igi chikcha?

‗Who cut (it)?‘ ‗What did (he) cut?‘17 ‗When did (he) cut (it)?‘ ‗Where did (he) cut (it)?‘ ‗How did (he) cut (it)?‘

Exercise 13. Amplificatory questions substitution frame drill
The teacher repeats the frame and selects a word from the list below, which can be substituted in the frame, and says it. The student then substitutes the word in the correct place in the frame.

Examples Teacher: ¿Toa makcha?

Teacher: ibi

Student: ¿Ibi makcha?

Teacher: ¿Ibi makcha?

Teacher: inkwa

Student: ¿Inkwa makcha?

4. igi

‗How?‘

5. toa

‗Who?‘

‗____ did (she) sew (it)?‘

Exercise 14. Amplificatory questions, varied substitution frame drill
The teacher repeats the frame and selects a word from the list below which can be substituted in the frame and says it. The student then substitutes the word in the correct place in the frame.

17 Here and throughout this grammar, where no subject is overtly indicated by a noun or pronoun, an appropriate pronoun is supplied. In another context, it might be a different one.

4.4.3.2 Topic-establishing questions
The topic of a question is the person or thing to whom/which the question refers. It is very important in Kuna that the topic of a question be clear. If the person or thing to whom/which the question refers is not presently being talked about, or if the topic is not obvious, it must be stated before the question itself. If the topic of a question is obscure and it is not stated, the listener may not understand the question.
For example, if you suddenly ask, ―Where is he going?,‖ your listener will invariably reply, ―Where is who going?‖ By asking this question, the listener has tried to establish the topic of your question. In other words, the topic of the question was unclear. Once the listener has understood the topic, he will answer the question. Three things must be kept in mind in using topic-establishing questions: the intonation pattern of the question, the order of the sentence, and the form of the topic.

1) Intonation of a topic-establishing question
Topic-establishing questions have a characteristic intonation pattern. Do the following exercise to familiarize yourself with this pattern.

Exercise 15. Topic-establishing question drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the class repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the class repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: ¿Waga, pia ne? Student: ¿Waga, pia ne?
1. ¿Waga, pia ne? 2. ¿Machi, ibi chobzha? 3. ¿Sagla, igi choge? 4. ¿Kinki, igi mani? 5. ¿Sagla, inkwa noni? 6. ¿Pedrode, toa sakis?

‗Where is the outsider going?‘
‗Where is the outsider going?‘ ‗What did the boy make?‘ ‗What does the chief say?‘ ‗How much was the gun?‘ ‗When did the chief arrive?‘ ‗Whom did Peter hit?‘

2) Form of a topic-establishing question
The topic of a question is stated first in the topic-establishing question. The topic is followed by 1) the appropriate question word, and 2) a verb.

42

Questions

Examples 1. ¿Waga, pia ne? 2. ¿Punu, pia chi?

‗The outsider, where is he going?‘ or ‗Where is the outsider going?‘ ‗Daughter, where is she?‘ or ‗Where is (my) daughter?‘

3) Form of the topic
Many nouns have long and short forms (see 3.4.4. and Appendix A). One of the times the long forms is used is in establishing the topic of a question.

Examples

1. mol becomes mola

‗cloth/blouse‘

2. pab becomes paba

‗father‘

You must memorize the nouns which have two forms and the ones which do not. Some hints which will help you learn some nouns which do not have short forms are:

1. A noun is almost never shortened if the short form would introduce ambiguity.

2. Nouns which have a consonant cluster (two consonants together) before the final vowel, cannot be

shortened.

Examples

1. arki

‗huacuco fish‘

2. sagla

‗chief‘

Exercise 16. Topic-establishing question frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the class repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the class repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

4.4.3.3 Confirmation (please repeat) questions
Structurally, confirmation questions are the same as the amplificatory questions. However, their purpose is different. A confirmation question acknowledges that the narrator has already given the information asked for by the listener. The listener has missed the information for some reason or another, so he asks for a repeat. The confirmation question is signalled by a distinctive intonation pattern. The question basically says: ―I know you already said this, but would you please say it again?‖ Do the following exercise to familiarize yourself with the intonation pattern.

Exercise 18. Confirmation question drill
The teacher says Sentence 1a and then leads the class in asking the confirmation question 1b. The class repeats the question after the teacher, being careful to mimic the intonation pattern. The teacher then replies to the question by repeating Sentence 1a. Continue to practice the intonation pattern of confirmation questions by doing the following dialogue-type exercises.

Example Teacher (speaking as narrator):

Teacher (leading the class as listener):

Student (mimicking the teacher as listener):

Teacher (speaking as narrator, in answer to confirmation question):

1a. Narrator: Tule ogob pakcha.

‗The Kuna bought coconuts.‘

b. Listener: ¿Ibi pakcha?

‗Bought what?‘

2a. Narrator: Tule ogob pakcha.

‗The Kuna bought coconuts.‘

b. Listener: ¿Toa pakcha?

‗Who bought (them)?‘

3a. Narrator: Machi arri makcha.

‗The boy shot an iguana.‘

b. Listener: ¿Ibi makcha?

‗He shot what?‘

4a. Narrator: Machi arri makcha.

‗The boy shot an iguana.‘

b. Listener: ¿Toa makcha?

‗Who shot (it)?‘

5a. Narrator: Tad ul ukcha.

‗The elder sold a canoe.‘

b. Listener: ¿Ibi ukcha?

‗He sold what?‘

6a. Narrator: Tad ul ukcha.

‗The elder sold a canoe.‘

b. Listener: ¿Toa ukcha?

‗Who sold it?‘

Exercise 4. Listing pronunciation drill
Mimic the teacher as he repeats Sentences 1–5 of Exercise 3 above. You should take care to maintain rhythm and pitch as you formulate the sounds of the words. Try not to distort the intonation pattern.

5.3 Culture
Kunas are vitally interested in buying and selling. Bargaining does not play a big role in the culture. Most things have a ―going price.‖
They often want to know the cost of your possessions and it is quite acceptable to discuss prices freely. The outsider is expected to remember what he paid for the clothes he is wearing or any of his tools or equipment. However, it is also acceptable not to know the cash value of gifts you have received.
Sometimes Kunas do not like for you to disclose the price of something they have sold to you. When others ask the price you gave for an item you bought in the village you may refer them to the seller. If nobody in the present company knows the person who sold you the item, you may disclose the price, but not the name of the person from whom you bought it.
If Kunas are buying or selling small items (e.g., fish hooks, buttons) the items are usually counted in groups of fives.

5.4 Grammar

5.4.1 Numbers (Ex. 5–15)
The numeral system in Kuna is complex. The numbers themselves are not difficult, but the system of prefixes is difficult to control.

5.4.3.3 Basic number stem
The basic number stems of Kuna are used in counting items in much the same way as items are counted in Spanish and English. The stems, however, are never used by themselves; they always occur with a prefix (see 5.4.1.3). It is important to memorize the basic number stems.

1. -gwen(na) 2. -bo 3. -pá 4. -bake 5. -atal(e) 6. -nerkwa 7. -kugle 8. -pabak(e)

‗one‘ ‗two‘ ‗three‘ ‗four‘ ‗five‘ ‗six‘ ‗seven‘ ‗eight‘

5.4 Grammar

47

9. -bakebak(e) 10. -ambe 11. -tula-

‗nine‘ ‗ten‘ ‗twenty‘

5.4.1.2 Word order of the number phrase Unlike English or Spanish, the numeral in Kuna is used after the noun: noun + (prefix + number stem).

Example nuzha + (kwa- + -bake) = nuzha kwabake

‗four eggs‘

5.4.1.3 Numeral prefixes In Kuna, you must use one of the many numeral prefixes with the number stem. These prefixes are divided into four main groups according to how a Kuna perceives the item he is counting, or according to the complexity of the number:
1. Group I Shape of object prefixes 2. Group II Complex number-building prefixes 3. Group III Measurement-related prefixes 4. Group IV Time-related prefixes In this lesson, Group I and Group II prefixes are discussed; Group III and Group IV prefixes are discussed in Lesson VII.

1) Group I. Shape of object prefixes
When a speaker describes a single object he uses a prefix which reflects the speaker‘s view of the shape of that object. There are several such shape prefixes.

a) Ka-
Ka- is the most general of the number prefixes based on the shape of an object. It is usually used for longish, non-flat objects such as leaves (mango, plantain, etc.), canoe poles, needles (for sewing and injections), and (a stack of) dollar bills (see 7.4.1.3).

Ka- is also used in cases in which no other shape distinction seems to fit. A tip for language learners is: When in doubt, try ka-, it just may work!

Examples 1. es kapá 2. aktigal kabo 3. tagar kabo 4. iko kapá 5. karta kabo 6. nalas kagan kabo

‗three machetes‘ ‗two canoe poles‘ ‗two wild banana leaves‘ ‗three needles‘ ‗two dollar bills‘ ‗two orange leaves‘

b) Wala-/wal-18
Wala-/wal- is used in describing people and animals and anything which transports people such as cars, planes, and boats. It is used for such elongated objects as plantain, manioc, and jungle ice cream (guava). It is also used for any long, thin pole from which the branches have been removed such as house poles, logs and in counting spirit beings and God.

18 Actually, several of the terms which are treated here as shape prefixes can occur alone as noun stems or in compound forms with other noun roots. For example, wala-/wal- occurs with ezha/es ‗iron/machete‘ in eswal ‗spear‘ When it occurs alone, wala/wal means ‗pole/trunk/main river‘.

48

Trade Language

The prefix wala-/wal- may be used in either the short or the long form in counting between one and four items. The long form, wala-, is used when the number is in focus, that is, when the number is the important part of the sentence. Only the long form, wala-, is used in counting five or more items.

Examples 1. tule walpá / tule walapá 2. tule walbake / tule walabake 3. achu walanerkwa 4. kukualed walaatal 5. mas walbake / walabake 6. puwal walpá / walapá 7. Pab Tummad walgwen chi. 8. mas walakugle

‗three people‘ ‗four people‘ ‗six dogs‘ ‗five planes‘ ‗four plantains‘ ‗three house poles‘ ‗One God exists.‘ ‗seven plantains‘

Exercise 5. Drilling numerals frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the class repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the class repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Examples Teacher: Tule walgwen nad.

Student: Tule walgwen nad.

Teacher: Tule walbo nad.

Student: Tule walbo nad.

1. Tule walgwen nad.

‗One person went.‘

2. Tule walbo nad.

‗Two people went.‘

3. Tule walpá nad.

‗Three people went.‘

4. Tule walbake nad.

‗Four people went.‘

5. Tule walaatal nad.

‗Five people went.‘

6. Tule walanerkwa nad.

‗Six people went.‘

7. Tule walakugle nad.

8. Tule walapabak nad.

‗Eight people went.‘

9. Tule walabakebak nad.

‗Nine people went.‘

10. Tule walaambe nad.

‗Ten people went.‘

c) Kwa-
Kwa- is used in describing objects that are more or less round, such as fruits (oranges) and the sun. It is also used to count birds and insects. It is used for spools of thread, and kernels of rice.

Examples 1. nalas kwanerkwa 2. kallin kwabo 3. kwi kwakugle 4. tub kwabo 5. Tad kwagwenna chi.19

‗six oranges‘ ‗two chickens‘ ‗seven mosquitos‘ ‗two spools of thread‘ ‗There is one sun.‘

Exercise 6. Drilling numerals substitution frame drill
Using the frame, the teacher counts one and the student repeats one. The teacher and student count two through ten in unison. This exercise should be repeated several times.

19 kwagwenna is the long form of kwagwen ‗one‘ used in this case for emphasis.

Numbers over ten in Kuna are ―built‖ by the addition of prefixes to the basic number stems.

a) Numbers eleven to nineteen
The numbers twelve to nineteen are formed by a phrase in which -ambe ‗ten‘ with the appropriate prefix is followed by the prefix kaka- with a basic number stem from two to nine. To form eleven, the basic number stem -gwen ‗one‘ is prefixed by kaka- and suffixed by -chak. The phrase may be summarized as follows: (number prefix + -ambe) + (kaka- + basic number stem).

1. -ambe kakagwenchak 2. -ambe kakabo 3. -ambe kakapá 4. -ambe kakabake 5. -ambe kakaatal 6. -ambe kakanerkwa 7. -ambe kakakugle 8. -ambe kakapabak 9. -ambe kakabakebak Examples 1. sabured koaambe kakapá 2. nalas kwaambe kakakugle 3. chowal chaglaambe kakaatal

‗eleven‘ ‗twelve‘ ‗thirteen‘ ‗fourteen‘ ‗fifteen‘ ‗sixteen‘ ‗seventeen‘ ‗eighteen‘ ‗nineteen‘

b) Numbers twenty and over
The Kuna counting system is based on the numbers ten and twenty. The affix -tula- ‗twenty‘ is used in conjunction with the appropriate numeral prefix.

Kunas describe large quantities of items by stating the multiple of twenty plus the number of extra items from one to nineteen prefixed by kata- (and followed by -chak in the case of ‗____ one‘): (number prefix -tula- basic number stem) (kaka- number one to nineteen).

In other words, the number forty-two is described as ―two twenties, plus two‖; fifty-six is describes as ―two twenties, plus sixteen‖; and eighty-four is described as ―four twenties, plus four‖.

Examples 1. karta katulagwen 2. tule walatulagwen kakagwenchak 3. mas walatulabo kakagwenchak 4. sabured koatulagwen kakaambe kakabo

c) Numbers one-hundred and over
The numbers 100 to 999 are viewed from a base of twenty -tula-. The basic form of tulaatal ‗five twenties/one hundred‘ is followed by the number prefix ila- ‗times‘, and the appropriate basic number stem in describing units of hundreds (see 7.4.1.1). for further discussion of ila-).

d) Spanish loan words in the numeral system
Due to the complexity of the numerical system, Spanish loan words are generally preferred for large numbers. The loan words are used as number prefixes.

Example 1 1. siento2. mil3. milyon-
Example 2 1. masde, sientokugle 2. masde, milpá 3. kartade, milyonpá

‗one-hundred‘ ‗one-thousand‘ ‗one million‘
‗700 plantains‘ ‗3,000 plantains‘ ‗$3,000,000.00‘

5.4.2 Listing
Things and events in Kuna are listed in their long form, and the conjunction tegine ‗and‘ is used to group them into shorter segments. There is a special intonation pattern for listing which is drilled in Exercises 3 and 4. Tegine ‗and‘ is also used during a pause in listing. Sometimes a speaker does not complete a list, but uses the term egmal ‗rest, remainder‘ to indicate that the list is incomplete.

5.4.2.1 Normal grouping
Although it is not a hard and fast rule, lists are usually sectioned into groups of three items separated by the conjunction tegine ‗and‘.

Example Pedro, Luis, Ricardo; tegine Alberto, Toni.

‗Peter, Louis, Richard and Albert, Tony.‘

5.4.2.2 Hesitancy
Anytime a speaker hesitates to think of the next item on the list, he will use the conjunction tegine ‗and‘ in the pause as he thinks. Sometimes a speaker will use the conjunction tegine ‗and‘ between each item in a list for emphasis.

Example Pedro ... tegine Luis ... tegine Ricardo.

‗Peter and Louis and Richard.‘

5.4.2.3 Incomplete listing
When a speaker chooses not to name the rest of the items on a list, egmal ‗others‘ is added to the end of the sentence.

Example Pedro, Luis, Ricardo, tegine egmal.

‗Peter, Louis, Richard and the rest.‘

6 POSITIONAL WORDS

6.1 Dialogue
The position of a person or thing is very important in Kuna. Everything in a Kuna‘s world is considered to be either lying, sitting, standing (leaning), suspended, or on ―all fours,‖ as illustrated in the following dialogue.

A visitor comes to pick up a fishing spear he has arranged to borrow.

1. Visitor:

Anná.

2. Villager:

Mai./Chi.

3. Visitor:

¿Ibi chenai?

4. Villager:

Chuli. Pinche chi.

5. Visitor:

Mmm. ¿Mimmidin?

6. Villager:

Kammai.

7. Visitor:

Ajáj. ¿Pe omedin?

8. Villager:

Mas tuji.

9. Visitor:

Mmm. Eswaldin, ¿pia mai?

10. Villager:

Webal kwichi.

11. Visitor:

Nuedi.

The visitor gets up, takes the spear and starts to leave.

‗Hello.‘ ‗I‘m home.‘ ‗What are you doing?‘ ‗Nothing. I‘m just sitting.‘ ‗Uh huh. And the baby?‘ ‗She is (lying) sleeping.‘ ‗Oh. And your wife?‘ ‗She is just cooking.‘ ‗Hmm. Where is (lying) the fishing spear?‘ ‗It is (standing) over there.‘ ‗Thank you.‘

12. Visitor: 13. Villager:

Kujal. Eye.

‗(See you) later.‘ ‗Okay.‘

6.2 Pronunciation
It is important that the student studying Kuna continue to practice the general conversational intonation as well as give special attention to the intonation of a disclaimer response.
6.2.1 Conversational intonation (Ex. 1–2) Practice your ability to carry on a normal conversation in Kuna by drilling the intonation patterns.
Exercise 1. Intonation practice
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 6.1 by humming the intonation. Pay special attention to the acknowledgements of a comment such as ajáj, mmm, eye.
Exercise 2. Pronunciation practice
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 6.1, formulating the individual sounds as closely as possible without 1) slowing down, or 2) losing the intonation pattern.
6.2.2 Disclaimer (nothing-special-is-happening) response (Ex. 3) It is very common to use the disclaimer response intonation (see 6.4.3) in reply to routine questions such as: ‗What have you been doing?‘, ‗What are you going to do?‘, ‗Where have you been?‘, and ‗Where are you going?‘. The pitch of a disclaimer response is higher than that of a normal reply and there is also a tendency to laryngealize the utterance, i.e., there is a different kind of vibration of the vocal cords.
Exercise 3. Disclaimer response intonation
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the class repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the class repeats it, etc.. This exercise should be repeated several times.

6.3 Culture
Gestures and habits vary from culture to culture. It is important to identify with the culture you are studying by learning common gestures, such as the way the people point at things and the way they count on their fingers.

6.3.1 Pointing
Kuna people point at objects or people by facing the object/person, giving a quick uplift of the chin in that direction, and raising the lower lip slightly.

6.3.2 Counting with fingers The numbers 1–5 are counted by holding the left hand, palm up. The right index finger is laid across the successive fingers one at a time, starting with the little finger.
The numbers 6–10 are counted by holding the right hand palm down. The left thumb is laid across the successive fingers, starting with the thumb.

6.4 Grammar

6.4.1 Positional verbs (Ex. 4–5)
In English/Spanish it is relatively easy to talk about the general location or presence of a person or object by using the verb ‗to be‘ or estar.

Examples

English

Spanish

1. The spear is on the floor.

El chuzo está en el piso.

2. The spear is against the wall.

El chuzo está recostado a la pared.

3. The basket is on the floor.

La canasta está en el piso.

You will note in the above examples that the same verb, (is), is used throughout the English examples to refer to general location of the object. The verb está is used throughout the Spanish examples.

A Kuna speaker, however, must choose one from several positional verbs to refer to the general location and position of a person or object. The above English/Spanish examples require three different positional verbs to be said in Kuna.

Examples

1. Eswal

napkin

mai.

spear

on-the-ground is-(lying)

‗The spear is lying on the ground.‘

60

Positional Words

2. Eswal

ilagin

kwichi.

is-(leaning/standing)

‗The spear is leaning against the wall.‘

3. Karpa

napkin

basket

on-the-ground is-(sitting)

‗The basket is sitting on the ground.‘

The general location of a person/object is always viewed in light of his/its position. There are five basic
potential positions—lying, sitting, hanging (suspended), standing, and ―on all fours‖—each of which is indicated by one of five20 positional verbs. When a Kuna speaks of the location of a person/object, he must
choose the positional verb which, in his point of view, reflects the position of the person/object.

Examples 1. Aktigal mai. 2. Nalas chi. 3. Mol nai. 4. Eswal kwichi. 5. Koe un.

‗The canoe pole is (lying) there.‘ ‗The orange is (sitting) there.‘ ‗The blouse is (hanging) there.‘ ‗The spear is (standing up) there.‘ ‗The deer is (on all fours) there.‘

6.4.1.1 Positional verbs with reference to objects Various situations or objects indicate to a Kuna speaker the specific positional verb which ought to be used.

1) Mai
In general, the positional verb mai refers to objects which are ―lying down.‖ An object which occurs with the verb mai is generally a long object. From the viewpoint of a Kuna speaker, a long object cannot generally be doubled (bent) into a sitting position. It is either mai ‗lying‘ or kwichi ‗standing‘.

Examples 1. Eswal mai. 2. Aktigal mai.

‗The spear is (lying) (on the floor).‘ ‗The canoe pole is (lying) (on the floor).‘

2) Chi
In general, the positional verb chi refers to objects which are ―sitting.‖ An object which occurs with the verb chi is generally a squat object. The objects may be either large or small.

Examples 1. Karpa chi. 2. Nalas chi. 3. Kan chi. 4. Pude chi. 5. Esmed chi.

‗The basket is (sitting) there.‘ ‗The orange is (sitting) there.‘ ‗The bench is (sitting) there.‘ ‗The bottle is (sitting) there.‘ ‗The pot is (sitting) there.‘

3) Nai
In general, the positional verb nai refers to objects which are ―hanging‖ or ―suspended.‖ Any object which is hung from rafters, as well as boats and planes which are viewed as being suspended (presumably in water or air) occur with the positional verb nai.

20 A sixth positional verb, ti, which involves motion, is dealt with in 18.4.2.

6.4 Grammar

61

Examples

1. Mol nai.

‗The clothes are (hanging) there.‘

2. Kachi nai.

‗The hammock is (hanging) there.‘

3. Kukualed nai.

‗The plane is (suspended) there.‘

4. Choul nai.

‗The boat is (suspended) there.‘

Another use of the positional verb nai is in the case of some items being left over out of a group.

Examples 1. Nuzha ampa nai. 2. Yannu ampa nai.

‗There are (still some) eggs (left over).‘ ‗There are (still some) peccary (left in the herd).‘

4) Kwichi
In general, the positional verb kwichi refers to objects which are standing up/leaning against something. Nonrigid items cannot ―stand‖ and consequently never occur with the positional verb kwichi.21

Examples 1. Eswal kwichi. 2. Pagla kwichi.

‗The spear is (standing) there.‘ ‗The main house pole is (standing) there.‘

5) Un
Un is used to describe something which is viewed as being ―on all fours.‖

Examples 1. Koe wegin un. 2. Achu wegin un.

‗The deer is (on all fours) there.‘ ‗The dog is (on all fours) there.‘

6.4.1.2 Variation in choice of positional verbs
Usually it is fairly easy to choose the correct positional verb as you view an object from a Kuna person‘s point of view. Sometimes, however, the choice of position may vary according to the situation or to the viewpoint of the speaker at the moment.

Examples 1. Mol nai. 2. Mol mai. 3. Mol chi. 4. Mol pukwa.22

‗The blouse is (hanging) there.‘ ‗The blouse is (folded flat and lying) there.‘ ‗The blouse is (sitting) there (on a temporary basis).‘ ‗The blouse is (in a heap) there.‘

6.4.1.3 Positional verbs with reference to people Although any of the positional verbs may be used on occasions with reference to people, the verbs mai and chi are most commonly used.
1) Idiomatic use of mai/chi
In the Paya Kuna dialect,23 there is an idiomatic distinction made between the positional verb used to refer to the physical presence (location) of a man versus that of a woman. The positional verb mai is almost always used to refer to the location of a man or a boy, and the positional verb chi is almost always used to refer to the location of a woman or a girl.

21 kwichi is actually a compound verb derived from kwi ‗to stand‘ + -s ‗completive‘ + chi ‗to sit‘. Note that s + ch becomes ch. 22 The plural of positional verbs is discussed in 13.4.3.2. 23 The San Blas dialect uses mai for both male and female.

62

Positional Words

Examples

1. Tad mai.

‗The grandfather is (at home/present).‘

2. Machi mai.

‗The boy is (at home/present).‘

3. Mu chi.

‗The grandmother is (at home/present).‘

4. Pun chi.

‗The girl is (at home/present).‘

According to tradition, this distinction stems from the ancient times when a man always received guests

while lying in his hammock (mai), while women were seated on benches (chi) to receive guests.

2) Position in focus with reference to people
Although by far the most common use of positional verbs for men and women is mai and chi, respectively, occasionally the situation demands that another one be used.

If, in the mind of the speaker, the position of the person is in focus, the construction parallels the Spanish/English construction lying, sitting, standing/leaning, hanging/suspended, or ―on all fours.‖ It is helpful to be aware of some examples of situations in which a position is in focus and, consequently, a positional verb other than mai/chi is used.

Situation 1

A man has been sick and lying in his hammock for days. A visitor comes to call. The sick man is feeling a little better and is even sitting up on a bench. The fact that the man is sitting is very important to the visitor because he had not expected that turn of events. The person responding to the visitor‘s opening remarks might say:

Tad chi. Situation 2

‗The elder one is sitting.‘

A woman is very sick and lying in a hammock. The important information is that the woman is so sick she is lying down. Relatives may say to visitors:

Nan mai.

‗Mother is lying (down).‘

3) Temporary presence
If the presence of a man is temporary, the positional verb chi may be used.

Examples 1. Machi chi. 2. An machered neggin chi.

‗The boy is here (temporarily).‘ ‗My husband is (temporarily) in the house.‘

4) Positional verb mai referring to a person‟s status
Mai is used in speaking of a person‘s status or position in the community. To form the status construction, the suffix -ga is added to the status position.

Examples 1. Pedro saglaga mai. 2. Alvaro tummadga mai.

‗Peter is the chief.‘ ‗Alvaro is the leader.‘

5) Positional verb nai referring to allegiance
Nai is used to show allegiance of one person to another. The suffix -bal is added to the name of the person to whom allegiance is shown.

Examples 1. Pedro anbal nai. 2. Juan, Luisbal nai.

‗Peter is for me.‘ ‗John is for Louis.‘

6.4 Grammar

63

Exercise 4. Idiomatic use of mai/chi drill
The teacher says one of the words in the following list. Using the word the teacher has said, the student completes a sentence with the idiomatic form of mai/chi.

Example Teacher: Ome

Student: Ome chi.

1. ome

‗woman‘

2. pun

‗daughter‘

3. machi

‗boy‘

4. tad

‗elder‘

5. Luis

‗Louis‘

6. María

‗Mary‘

Exercise 5. Positional verb viewpoint drill
If practical, the teacher should carry out the following drill. The purpose of the drill is to help the student learn how a Kuna would view the position of an object. The teacher points to an object. The student replies, inserting in the frame below the positional (nai, mai, chi, kwichi or un) that a Kuna would use, viewing the object involved.

Example Teacher: (points to a cord hanging down from the roof)

Student: We, wegin nai.

Frame We, wegin ____.

‗That is (lying, sitting, standing, hanging, on all fours) over there.‘

Note: Ten to fifteen items should be used, if possible. The drill should be repeated several times until the

student is able to anticipate the Kuna viewpoint of an object‘s position.

6.4.2 Present progressive tense-aspect (Ex. 6–9)
When an event or action is viewed by the speaker as being in progress, the aspect of the verb is present progressive. The present progressive parallels the Spanish/English construction Estoy comiendo. ―I am eating.‖ In Kuna, the present progressive is formed by suffixing one of the positional verbs -mai, -chi, -nai, or -kwichi to the verb stem.

6.4.2.1 General use of the present progressive
In general, the positional verb used to form the present progressive reflects the position of the person/thing doing the action.

Examples

1a. Mimmi kammai.24

‗The baby is (lying) sleeping.‘

b. Mimmi kabzhi. c. Wag kabgwis.25

‗The baby is (sitting in a chair) sleeping.‘ ‗The outsider is (standing/leaning against something) sleeping.‘

2a. An mas kunchi. b. An mas kunkwis.5

‗I am (sitting) eating.‘ ‗I am (standing) eating.‘

3. Kukualed kukunai.

‗The plane is (suspended) flying.‘

It is important to note that the present progressive suffix -chi, changes its form according to the final vowel or

consonant of the verb stem:

-chi occurs following fortis consonants. -chi becomes -zhi following lenis consonants. -chi becomes -ji following vowels.

24 b becomes m before m or n. For example, kab + -mai = kammai ‗is sleeping‘. 25 -gwis and -kwis are short forms of kwichi ‗to be standing‘.

64

Positional Words

Examples 1. An mas kunchi. 2. An madun kobzhi. 3. An mas tuji.

‗I am (sitting) eating.‘ ‗I am (sitting) drinking.‘ ‗I am (sitting) cooking.‘

6.4.2.2 Active/passive involvement in present progressive tense
A Kuna speaker often makes a distinction between a person actively engaging in an action, versus someone who is passively involved in an action. If the speaker is focusing on the idea that the person is actively or passively involved in an action, rather than on the action itself, the positional verbs nai and chi are used as present progressive suffixes. The suffix -nai ‗hanging/suspended‘ is used to indicate that a person is actively involved in an action. The actor may be standing, sitting or lying, but he is actively involved.

Examples

1. An mol maknai.

‗I am actively (sitting) sewing a blouse.‘

2. Machi karro nudanai.

‗The boy is actively (lying down underneath) fixing a car.‘

The present progressive tense suffix -chi is used if an actor is passively involved in an action, regardless of a standing, sitting, or lying position. If, for example, a woman is standing passively watching food cook, but is not stirring it, or doing anything to the fire, a Kuna speaker would use the present progressive suffix -chi/-zhi/-ji. Or, if a man is lying under a car, passively looking at it, but he is not actively involved in doing anything, the present progressive suffix -chi/-zhi/-ji could be used.

Examples 1. Ome mas tuji. 2. Tule karro takchi. 3. An aros takchi.

‗The woman is passively (possibly standing) cooking food.‘ ‗The man is passively (possibly lying underneath) looking at a car.‘ ‗I am passively (possibly standing) looking at the rice.‘

6.4.2.3 Temporary action sense of -gwis/-kwis
The temporary nature of an action in progress can be indicated by using -gwis/-kwis in a secondary sense. In this case the suffix -gwis/-kwis26 is added to the short form of the verb stem.

Examples 1. An nuskan takkwis. 2. An itigin meggwis.

‗I am looking after the children for the moment.‘ ‗I am living here temporarily.‘

Exercise 6. Present progressive aspect frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: An ua kunnai. Student: An ua kunnai.
1. An ua kunnai. 2. An ua maknai. 3. An ua chwanai. 4. An karta takchi. 5. An karta nermaji. 6. Machi kammai. 7. Machi atamai. 8. Machi ullukumai.

‗I‘m eating fish.‘ ‗I‘m spearing fish.‘ ‗I‘m catching fish.‘ ‗I‘m just sitting looking at/reading a letter.‘ ‗I‘m just sitting writing a letter.‘ ‗The boy lies sleeping.‘ ‗The boy lies awake.‘ ‗The boy lies resting.‘

26 purkwis ‗died‘ and nakwis ‗to ascend/go up‘ are not derived in this way.

6.4.3 Disclaimer (nothing-special-is-happening) response (Ex. 10)
It is very common that on a chance meeting or casual visit a Kuna will ask the person he sees a general question such as, ‗What are you doing?‘, ‗Where have you been?‘, or ‗What are you going to do?‘. The response is often a nothing-much type of an answer, a disclaimer response. The disclaimer response states what the person is doing or where he is going in a manner that suggests that the activity is routine, nothing special. Pinche ‗for nothing/for no special purpose‘ is an optional feature of a disclaimer response. It serves to heighten the disclaimer.

Exercise 10. Disclaimer response drill

7.2 Pronunciation

7.2.1 Intonation (Ex. 1)
Exercise 1. Intonation pattern drill
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 7.1 by humming the intonation patterns. Think the words as you hum them. Pay special attention to the intonation change between questions and answers.

7.2.2 Pronunciation (Ex. 2–3)
Exercise 2. Pronunciation drill
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 7.1, formulating the individual sounds the best you can without 1) slowing down, or 2) losing the intonation pattern.
Exercise 3. Dialogue drill
Practice carrying on a normal conversation, using the correct intonation patterns by doing the following exercise:
Dramatize Dialogue 7.1 with the teacher playing the role of the villager and the student playing the role of the trader. Repeat the exercise with the student as villager and the teacher as trader. After the teacher has done the dialogue a couple of times, allow two students to dramatize the dialogue. While the students are dramatizing the dialogue, the teacher should note the sentences which are most difficult for the student and work on the intonation of those sentences at a later time. Use Kuna-like gestures while dramatizing the dialogue.

7.2.3 Unit price intonation pattern (Ex. 4–5)
When quoting a price per unit in Kuna, the unit is given first followed by a drop in pitch. The price is given in the lower pitch.

Exercise 4. Unit price intonation pattern
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student hums the intonation; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student hums the intonation, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

1. Yardagwen, karta kagwen. 2. Kogwen, karta kapá. 3. Libergwen, maniatal. 4. Bultogwen, karta kanerkwa. 5. Galonkwen, karta kagwen eg tongwen.

‗One dollar per yard.‘ ‗Three dollars per length.‘ ‗Twenty-five cents per pound.‘ ‗Six dollars per lot.‘ ‗One dollar and fifty cents per gallon.‘

Exercise 5. Unit price intonation pattern
Mimic the teacher as he repeats Sentences 1–5 of Exercise 4 above. You should take care to maintain the rhythm and the pitch as you formulate the sounds of the words. Try not to distort the intonation pattern.

7.3 Culture
In carrying out business, Kunas usually buy and pay for one item at a time. This practice is common in many parts of the world. The price of sugar, for instance, is discussed and agreed upon. The sugar is paid for, handed over to the buyer, and any change is given. You are then ready to buy or sell the next item.
As you become more integrated into the Kuna culture, you will occasionally find yourself involved in situations which are embarrassing to you or to your Kuna associates. One such embarrassing situation is related in Dialogue 7.1. The villager discovered when he went to pay for some merchandise that he had left his money at home. A Kuna would feel very embarrassed on discovering his error. The most inoffensive way of handling an embarrassing situation in a culture other than your own is to ignore the situation and carry on as though nothing unusual had happened. Avoid using smiles or quips in such situations. People tend to be doubly sensitive to embarrassment in front of people from another culture. If the embarrassing situation is ignored it is much easier for the embarrassed party to regain his composure.

7.4 Grammar

7.4.1 Numbers (Ex. 6–19)
In 5.4.1., basic number stems, the word order of the number phrase, and numeral prefixes from Group I (Shape of object prefixes) and Group II (Complex number-building prefixes) are discussed. Prefixes from Group III (Measurement-related prefixes) and Group IV (Time-related prefixes) are also in constant use in the Kuna counting system.
Measurement-related prefixes and time-related prefixes are vital to your control of the numerical system in Kuna.

7.4.1.1 Group III. Measurement-related prefixes
Measurement-related prefixes are used to describe collective nouns or quantitative measurements such as pounds, bushels, herds. The measurement-related prefixes attach to any basic number stem as the shape of object prefixes. There are several measurement-related prefixes.

1) Karpa-
Karpa- literally means ‗basket‘ and is used to describe the quantity of crops harvested in a day or the total crop harvested. It is used to describe crops collected in baskets such as oba ‗corn‘, chia ‗cocoa‘, aros ‗rice‘, aswe ‗avocado‘, and mam ‗manioc‘.

Examples
1. Oba karpabo an chus. 2. Aros karpaambe an chus.29

‗I harvested (fetched) two baskets of corn.‘ ‗I harvested (fetched) ten baskets of rice.‘

2) Kuk-/kuku-
Kuk-/kuku- is used to describe bundles of elongated objects such as leaves (thatch) for roof building. Bundles numbering from one to three use the short form kuk-, and bundles numbering four or more use the long form kuku-.

Examples 1. tagar kukgwen 2. tagar kukbo 3. tagar kukukugle

‗one bundle of wild banana leaves‘ ‗two bundles of wild banana leaves‘ ‗seven bundles of wild banana leaves‘

3) Tan-/tana-
Tan-/tana- is used to describe fields or farms. If a person has fields of rice planted in two different locations, tan- is the prefix used to count the fields. Tan- is also used to describe a stand of reeds used in basket weaving. The short form tan- is used to count items numbering from one to three and the long form tana- is used to count four or more items.

Examples 1. Negchaled tanbo. 2. Kaie negchaled tanpá. 3. Nagwal tananerkwa.

‗(There are) two fields.‘ ‗(There are) three cane fields.‘ ‗(There are) six stands of reeds.‘

4) Tak-
Tak- is used to describe a bunch of coconuts on a stalk, or a hand of bananas or plantains.

29 See Appendix E for an explanation of the word order in these two examples.

70

Buying and Selling

Examples 1. Ogob takbo. 2. Wawadun taknerkwa.

‗(There are) two stalks of coconuts.‘ ‗(There are) six hands of bananas.‘

5) Il-/ila-
Il-/ila- is used to describe the number of times an action is performed or an event occurs. It is also used to count rows of crops. The short form il- is used to count one to three items, and the long form ila- is used to count four or more items.

Examples 1. Ilbo an takcha. 2. Ilanerkwa an takcha.

‗I saw it two times.‘ ‗I saw it six times.‘

6) Chog-/choga-
Chog-/choga- is used to describe sets of things or groups of items. It can be used to describe the number of ways an idea may be correctly expressed or the number of expressions. Herds of animals or flocks of birds are counted by using this prefix. The short form chog- is used to count items (groups) of one to three and the long form is used to count items (groups) of four or more.

Examples 1. Chogpá. 2. Immal chogabake. 3. Yannu chogbo. 4. Padu chogpá. 5. Sapat chogabake.

‗(There are) three ways of saying it.‘ ‗(There are) four groups of different kinds of animals.‘ ‗(There are) two yannu herds.‘ ‗(There are) three flocks of ducks.‘ ‗(There are) four groups (piles) of shoes (of different kinds: sandals, sneakers, boots).‘

7) Tar-
Tar- is used to describe a basic measured unit of an item. Tar- is usually used in the selling of cloth.

Examples 1. Mol tarpá. 2. Mol tarpabak.

8) Out-of-culture measurement unit prefixes
Kunas sometimes use measurement units from outside their culture to describe various items. Some out-of-culture measurement unit prefixes include: yarta- ‗yard‘, metro- ‗meter‘, and liber- ‗pound‘. These prefixes are used with basic number stems to describe quantities of various items such as cloth, sugar, and flour.

Examples 1. Mol yartabo pei. 2. Ostigid libergwen.

‗I would like (to buy) two yards of cloth.‘ ‗(There is) one pound of sugar.‘

7.4.1.3 Money units
Money units function in a different way from other measurement prefixes and need to be discussed individually. The five prefixes and/or words used to describe money by the Kunas of the Darién are:

1. mani2. ton3. karta

‗five cents/one nickel‘ ‗fifty cents‘ ‗dollar bills‘

76

Buying and Selling

4. olmani-

‗dollar bills‘

5. tula-

‗twenty‘

These five terms form the basis of the five-way distinction used to describe money units below.

1) Money unit prefixes used to describe quantities less than one dollar
Two prefixes used by Darién Kuna for money valued at less than one dollar are mani- ‗five cents/nickel‘ and ton- ‗fifty cents‘.

a) Mani- ‗coin‘
Mani- ‗five cents/one nickel‘ is the smallest unit of money used for trade in the Darién.30 In describing the cost of items valued between five and forty-five cents, the Kunas describe the cost as a multiple of five cent pieces. For example, if an item costs twenty-five cents, the Kunas would interpret the cost of the item as five five-cent units, or five nickels. The prefix mani- uses two forms of the numeral phrase. If an item costs from five to thirty cents (i.e., one to six nickels), the form of the numeral phrase is mani- + basic number stem.

If the item costs from thirty-five to forty-five cents (seven to nine nickels), the form of the number phrase is mani- + kwa-31 + basic number stem.

Example 1. manibake 2. maniatal 3. manikwakugle 4. manikwapabak

‗20 cents (four five-cent units)‘ ‗25 cents (five, five-cent units)‘ ‗35 cents (seven, five-cent units)‘ ‗40 cents (eight, five-cent units)‘

Exercise 10. Money unit drill
The teacher writes on the board one of the money quantities listed in the lesson. The teacher then says the Kuna money unit. The student repeats the money unit after the teacher. This exercise should be repeated several times.

7.4 Grammar

b) Ton- ‗fifty cents‘
Ton- is used to describe units of fifty cents. The most common use of the prefix ton- is in the description of an item which costs fifty cents, tongwen. Very occasionally other number stems are added to the prefix ton- and are used to describe values which are multiples of fifty cents. The numeral phrase is formed by ton- + basic number stem.

Examples

1. tongwen

‗fifty cents (one fifty-cent unit)‘

Rarely used forms include:

2. tonbo 3. tonpá 4. tonbake

‗one dollar (two fifty-cent units)‘ ‗one dollar, fifty (three fifty-cent units)‘ ‗two dollars (four fifty-cent units)‘

2) Money unit terms used to describe quantities of one dollar or more
Two terms used by the Kuna in the Darién to describe money valued at more than one dollar are karta ‗dollar bill‘ and olmani- ‗gold sovereign‘.

Karta ‗dollar bill‘ is the word used to describe dollar bills in Kuna. It actually means ‗paper/book‘. The form used to describe the denomination of a dollar bill or the price of an item is karta + ka- (or mata-32) +
basic number stem.

Although either ka- or mata- may be used in the numeral phrase, ka- is more common. The word karta is usually used to describe denominations of money valued at less than ten dollars. However, this is not always the case. When the term karta is used to describe denominations of twenty or more, the Group I prefixes, ka- and mata- are not usually used.

Examples

1. karta kagwen

‗one dollar‘33

or

karta matagwen

2. karta kabo

‗two dollars‘

or

karta matabo

3. karta katulabo

‗forty dollars‘

or

karta matatulabo

or

karta tulabo

Olmani- ‗gold sovereign dollar bills‘ is another money unit prefix. The form used to describe the denomination of a bill or the price of an item is olmani- + basic number stem.

This prefix is usually used to describe denominations of more than ten dollars, although occasionally one dollar amounts are described by this prefix.

32 ka- and mata- are Group I shape prefixes (see 5.4.1.3). 33 Sometimes the loan word balboa or dólar is used in the place of karta. If an item was purchased in Colombia, the word peso might be used.

3) Complex amounts in money phrases
The description of a price may require one, two or three of the money unit categories, mani ‗five-cent unit‘, ton- ‗fifty-cent unit‘, and/or karta/olmani- ‗dollar bills‘. The conjunction eg ‗and/in addition to‘ is used to join the parts of a complex money phrase.

7.4 Grammar

79

Example

karta

kapá

eg

dollars

three

and

‗three dollars and seventy-five cents‘

tongwen

eg

fifty-cents and

maniatal five-nickels

Eg ‗and‘ may be omitted from the number phrase. Following are suggestions for the inclusion or omission of eg ‗and‘ in the complex money phrase.

Use eg ‗and‘ with complex dollar quantities. If the dollar quantity is a number from 11–19 or not a multiple of ten, eg ‗and‘ is used before the unit of cents.

Examples

1. karta katulagwen kakabo eg tongwen

‗$22.50‘

2. karta kaambe kakapá eg maniatal

‗$13.25‘

3. karta tulagwen tongwen

‗$20.50‘

4. karta katulagwen kakaambe eg maninerkwa ‗$30.30‘

5. karta tulapá tongwen

‗$60.50‘

Use eg ‗and‘ in a three-category money phrase. A money phrase which includes three categories of money units (mani-, ton- and karta/olmani-) separates the mani- from the ton- category by the use of eg ‗and‘.

Examples

1. karta kabo, tongwen eg manipá

‗$2.65‘

2. karta katulapá kakabake tongwen eg manibo ‗$64.60‘

Eg ‗and‘ is seldom used in a two-part money phrase. A money phrase which includes only two categories of money units (mani- + ton- or karta + ton- or karta + mani-) tends not to use the conjunction eg ‗and‘.

Examples

1. karta kabo, tongwen

‗$2.50‘

2. tongwen manibake

‗$ .70‘

Use eg ‗and‘ in the case of hesitancy. Eg ‗and‘ is used in a money phrase in which the speaker hesitates as he tries to recall the particular quantity. In this circumstance, eg ‗and‘ may be used between any of the parts of the money phrase.

Examples 1. karta kagwen eg ... manibo 2. karta tulagwen eg ... tongwen eg manipá 3. tongwen eg ... maniatal

‗$2.10/$2.00 and ... 10¢‘ ‗$20.65/$20.00 and ... 65¢' ‗75¢/50¢ and ... 25¢‘

4) Unit price phrase
In buying and selling, a useful expression is the cost of a single item, the unit price. The unit price phrase in Kuna is expressed by saying the appropriate number prefix + -gwen ‗one‘ + the cost of the item.

Examples

1. ka- + -gwen, manibo

kagwen, manibo

‗one for 10¢‘

2. ko- + -gwen, karta kabo

kogwen, karta kabo

‗one length for $2.00‘

It is common to use out-of-culture measurement units (see 7.4.1.1) in describing unit prices.

Examples 1. yartagwen, karta kabo eg tongwen 2. liberatal, karta kagwen

‗one yard for $2.50‘ ‗five pounds for $1.00‘

7.4.1.4 Group IV. Time-related prefixes
Units of time such as days, weeks, and years are described by time-related prefixes. The description of months and hours is somewhat different from the construction of other time units.

1) Days, weeks, and years
Days, weeks, and years are described by the use of time-related prefixes iba- ‗day‘, tummi- ‗week‘, and pirka- ‗year‘. Time-related prefixes attach to any basic number stem to form a time-related number: time-related prefix + basic number stem.

Examples 1. ibanerkwa 2. tummibo 3. pirkaambe

‗six days‘ ‗two weeks‘ ‗ten years‘

Exercise 15. Time-related prefix substitution frame drill
The teacher says the frame and the student repeats it. The teacher selects a word from the list below and says it. The student then substitutes the word in the frame.

2) Months
The time-related number phrase used to describe months differs from other time-related number phrases and parallels the number phrases used for Group I and Group II number prefixes (see 5.4.1.3). The Kuna word for ―month‖ is ni. Ni ‗month‘ is a concrete noun which comes from the word ni ‗moon‘. Since Kunas personalize the word ni ‗moon/month‘, the Group I number prefix wal-/wala- is used in the number phrase. The time-related number phrase for month is formed by ni + (wal- + basic number stem).

Examples 1. ni walpá 2. ni walanerkwa

‗three months‘ ‗six months‘

Exercise 16. Time-related prefix substitution frame drill
The teacher says the frame and the student repeats it. The teacher selects a basic number stem from the list below. The student substitutes the selected basic number stem into the frame.

3) Hours
Hours in a day may be referred to by time words formed from the time-related prefix wachil- ‗o‘clock‘ or by the use of a specific time word.

Specific hours may be described by a time-related number which is formed by adding a basic number stem to the time-related prefix wachil- ‗o‘clock‘: wachil- + basic number stem. This description of time is closely associated with the actual time on a clock.

Examples

1. wachilpá

‗three o‘clock‘

2. wachilkugle

‗seven o‘clock‘

Half hours are described by using the time-related number eg ‗and‘ + abal ‗half‘.

Example wachilbo eg abal

‗two-thirty o‘clock‘

Irregular times tend to be described with a combination of Kuna and Spanish loan words. A Kuna time-related number describes the hour. Minutes are described by either using the Spanish loan word minuto as a prefix to a basic number stem, or by using the basic number stem alone.

Examples

1. wachilbo minutoambe kakaatal

‗2:15‘

2. wachilbo tulagwen kakaatal

‗2:25‘

3. wachilpá minutoatal

‗3:05‘

4. wachilbake tulabo kakaatal

‗4:45‘

Irregular time-related phrases for times past the half hour can be shortened somewhat by using a phrase: (minuto- + basic number stem) + napi ‗short of‘ + (wachil- + basic number stem + kugal ‗to become‘).

Examples 1. minutoatal napi wachilbo kugal 2. minutoambe kakaatal napi wachilpá kugal

‗five minutes short of two o‘clock/1:55‘ ‗fifteen minutes short of three o‘clock/2:45‘

Exercise 18. Time-related prefix changed frame drill
The teacher says Phrase 1 and the student repeats it. The teacher and the student repeat Phrase 1 in unison. The same is done for the succeeding sentences.

7.4.2 Time words
Kunas often describe time by the use of time words which parallel a general time of day rather than a specific hour on the clock. Such words tend to describe time in relation to the sun in a similar way to the English words ―noon‖, ―afternoon‖, and ―mid-morning‖. Some examples of the more common time words are listed here and should be memorized. Other time words are listed in Appendix D. The time words are used at the beginning of a sentence as described in Lesson 3.4.2.2.

Following is a listing of the common time words:

1. oipos 2. wakur 3. yoroku 4. chedo 5. neggabgwen 6. mutik 7. ibgin

‗dawn‘ ‗morning‘ ‗noon‘ ‗evening‘ ‗midnight‘ ‗night‘ ‗day‘

7.4.3 Quantity-related questions (Ex. 20)
Quantity-related questions are the questions one uses to learn the quantity of an item which is being spoken of or asked for. Quantity-related questions can be asked by using the general term melu ‗How much?‘ or by the use of a quantity-related question number phrase, using the suffix -bigwa.

84

Buying and Selling

7.4.3.1 Melu „How much?‟
Melu ‗How much?‘ is a question word which is used in order to question the quantity of an item which is being requested or spoken of. It is a general term and can be used with all classes of items.

Examples 1. ¿Melu pei? 2. ¿Nuzhade, melu napi?

‗How many (do you want)?‘ ‗How many eggs are you short?‘

7.4.3.2 -bigwa „How many?‟
A quantity-related question number is formed by using the suffix -bigwa. The suffix -bigwa is added to the number prefix which applies to the item being discussed: (¿number prefix + -bigwa?).

Examples 1. ¿Masde, walabigwa? 2. ¿Ibabigwa peine? 3. ¿Kwabigwa nalas nika? 4. ¿Karta, kabigwa nika? 5. ¿Tagarde, kukbigwa pei? 6. ¿Wachilbigwa?

‗How many plantains (are there)?‘ ‗How many days are you going to stay?‘ ‗How many oranges do you have?‘ ‗How much money do you have?‘ ‗How many bundles of thatch do you want?‘ ‗What time is it?‘

Exercise 20. Time-related prefix stimulus response drill
The teacher gives the stimulus in the form of a question. The student responds using the correct form of the numeral.

Example Teacher: ¿Ibabigwa megne?

Student: Ibabake megne.

1. ¿Ibabigwa megne?

‗How many days are you going to stay?‘

2. ¿Tummibigwa megne?

‗How many weeks are you going to stay?‘

3. ¿Ni walabigwa megne?

‗How many months are you going to stay?‘

4. ¿Pirkabigwa megne?

‗How many years are you going to stay?‘

5. ¿Wachilbigwa megne?

‗How many hours are you going to stay?‘

7.4.3.3 Igi „How much (money)?‟
Igi ‗How much?‘ is a question word which is used to find out how much an item costs. The quantity-related question phrase is formed by adding the word mani ‗money‘ after the word igi ‗How much?‘: igi + mani.

Examples 1. ¿Kartade, igi mani? 2. ¿Masde, walaatal, igi mani?

‗How much is the book?‘ ‗How much are five plantains?‘

8.2 Pronunciation and Intonation
It is important to be aware of the correct intonation pattern used at different times throughout a Kuna conversation.
8.2.1 Response by repetition One form of acknowledging or responding to what has been said is to repeat the information (usually in summary form). Response by repetition has a special intonation pattern such as the pattern heard in Dialogue 8.1, utterance 13.
8.2.2 Yielding-the-floor response (Ex. 1–4) There is a particular intonation pattern which signals, ―I have no more to say on that subject, you may change the subject now.‖ (see Dialogue 8.1, utterance 15). By means of this intonation signal:
You will know when you can start talking without appearing to be impolite by interrupting. You will be able to indicate to your listener when he may start talking without the possible embarrassment of interrupting you.
Exercise 1. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 8.1 by humming the intonation patterns. Pay special attention to the intonation pattern of repetition response (utterance 13) and the yielding-the-floor response (utterance 15).

Exercise 2. Pronunciation drill
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 8.1, formulating the individual sounds as closely as possible without 1) slowing down, or 2) losing the intonation pattern.
Exercise 3. Dialogue drill
Dramatize Dialogue 8.1 with two students playing the roles. The teacher should check for 1) correct intonation patterns, 2) correct pronunciation, and 3) Kuna-like gestures.
Exercise 4. Problem drill
Drill the problem sentences, sounds, and gestures encountered in Exercise 3 above.

8.3 Culture
You already know how important it is to exchange greetings when you encounter a Kuna in or around the village. Failure to greet people you pass in a Kuna village in the Darién indicates lack of acceptance or displeasure.
You will certainly experience times, however, when you will want to do more than just greet the person. Perhaps you will wish to establish an acquaintance or start a conversation. In such situations the use of questions is very helpful. Questions concerning the person‘s family (Are you married? Do you have brothers/sisters? Do you have children?) are acceptable. Questions concerning birthplace, what he is doing, where he is going or where he lives are also acceptable and are very good conversation openers.
You must be careful to avoid certain areas of conversation which a person would find threatening to his people or himself. For instance, detailed questioning about tribal ceremonies and customs should be withheld until you are sure you have established mutual respect with the person.

8.4 Grammar: Location
Every event or object can be described as being located in a certain place. A person may speak of an object as being in a general area, such as, ―in the woods‖, or he may speak of the object as being in a specific area in the woods such as, ―under the tree (in the big woods)‖. Whether the person chooses to speak of the general location (broad setting) or the specific location (narrow setting) is dependent on how the speaker views the object (speaker‘s viewpoint) or what he thinks the listener needs to know about the object.

8.4.1 Locative suffixes (Ex. 5–7)
This distinction between broad and narrow settings in Kuna is a very important one because a different suffix is used with the noun. For a broad setting, -bal/-pal is attached to the noun; for a narrow setting, -gin/-kin occurs.

8.4.1.1 Broad setting
The general area in which an action takes place is called the broad setting. For example, a person may say he left a deer in the forest. He does not specify exactly where in the forest the deer was left, but refers to the general (broad) setting, the forest. A broad setting in Kuna is indicated by adding the suffix -bal/-pal to the word which refers to location.

Examples 1. Sagla koe chapurbal ebes. 2. Tibal nad.

‗The chief left the deer in the forest.‘ ‗He went to (the general area of) the river.‘

8.4.1.2 Narrow setting
A specific area within a larger (broad) setting is called the narrow setting. With reference to the example of the man who left a deer in the forest, the man could have said he left the deer under the cedar tree in the forest. The cedar tree is the narrow, specific setting within the broad setting. A narrow setting in Kuna is indicated by adding -gin/-kin to the word which refers to location.

Example Nan neggin chi.

‗Mother is at the house.‘

From the viewpoint of the speaker, the house is a specific area within the broad setting of the village.

Exercise 5. Location (broad setting) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Examples Teacher: Machi yannu chapurbal ebes.

Student: Machi yannu chapurbal ebes.

Teacher: Machi yannu igalbal ebes.

Student: Machi yannu igalbal ebes.

1. Machi yannu chapurbal ebes.

‗The boy left the peccary in the jungle.‘

2. Machi yannu igalbal ebes.

‗The boy left the peccary on the trail.‘

3. Machi yannu tuppal ebes.

‗The boy left the peccary on the peninsula.‘

4. Machi yannu kullubal ebes.

‗The boy left the peccary on the bank.‘

Exercise 6. Narrow setting location frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Examples Teacher: Machi eswal neggin ebes.

Student: Machi eswal neggin ebes.

Teacher: Machi eswal akwagin ebes.

Student: Machi eswal akwagin ebes.

1. Machi eswal neggin ebes.

‗The boy left his fishing spear at home‘

2. Machi eswal akwagin ebes.

‗The boy left his fishing spear on the stone.‘

3. Machi eswal ulgin ebes.

‗The boy left his fishing spear in the canoe.‘

4. Machi eswal mesagin ebes.

‗The boy left his fishing spear on the table.‘

5. Machi eswal kukualedgin ebes.

‗The boy left his fishing spear in the airplane.‘

8.4.1.3 Distinction of -bal/-pal versus -gin/-kin
In many cases, the choice of -bal/-pal versus -gin/-kin depends upon the viewpoint of the speaker in a particular situation. For example, if the speaker is talking about the chief being in Panama and the viewpoint of the speaker is that the chief is somewhere in the broad setting of Panama, -bal/-pal will be used.

Example

Sagla Panamabal mai.

‗The chief is (somewhere) in Panama.‘

If, however, the viewpoint of the speaker is that the chief is in Panama as opposed to Colón or some other town in the Republic of Panama (i.e., he is pinpointing a location in the Republic), the suffix -gin/-kin is used.

Example Sagla Panamagin mai.

‗The chief is at Panama.‘

8.4.2 Locative phrases (Ex. 8) Certain geographical features (rivers, mountains, sea) may be incorporated into locative phrases. These phrases may be used to refer to a broad or narrow setting by the addition of the locative suffix.
8.4.2.1 Aspects of topographical features Description of location becomes more precise when a speaker refers to certain aspects of a topographical area such as a river, mountain or sea instead of simply referring to the feature itself.
8.4.2.2 Formation of locative phrases The locative phrase is formed by adding a word specifying an aspect of the topographical feature to the topographical feature itself. It is followed by a locative suffix: topographical feature + (aspect of feature + locative suffix -bal/-pal or -gin/-kin).

Examples 1. Eswal Pay tukbal ebes. 2. Eswal Inaganya wirzhobal ebes.

‗(He) left the spear at the source of the Paya River.‘ ‗(He) left the spear at the Inaganya stretch of the river.‘

8.4.3 Adverbs of location (Ex 9–11)
Some locative concepts are communicated by the use of an adverb of location instead of by the addition of a locative suffix to a noun.

Adverbs of location are used to define one location with reference to another location (reference point). In Spanish and English, another location is referred to by using a preposition before the noun which serves as its reference point: atras de la casa ‗behind the house‘ or abajo de la mesa ‗below the table‘. In Kuna, an adverb of location follows the noun which serves as its reference point.

Examples

1. neg cholbal

‗behind the house‘

2. kan ulpal

‗under the bench‘

In the list of examples of adverbs of location below, it may be noted that some of the adverbs incorporate a locative suffix (-bal/-pal or -gin/-kin) and some do not. The form of adverbs of location is fixed and needs to be learned.

8.4.3.1 Adverbs of location which usually occur with stated reference point

1a. nikpa b. ulpal35

‗above‘ ‗below‘

2a. cholbal

8.4.3.2 Locative adverbs
These words differ from the above which usually occur without a stated reference point in that one does not usually express their reference point by means of a noun. When the point of reference is intrinsic to the adverb, e.g., ulak ‗deep (in the jungle)‘ or when it is assumed from the context, e.g., panna ‗far (from the place I was talking about)‘. The following adverbs of location may be used without stating the reference point.

9.2 Pronunciation: Tracking and Mimicry (Ex. 1–3)
One of the most useful tools for learning the language is a device called ―tracking.‖ Tracking is instantaneously mimicking a speaker. As the speaker starts to talk you mimic everything he says, keeping two or three syllables behind him all the time. You should concentrate mainly on the rhythm and pitch patterns as you track, approximating the consonant and vowel sounds as well as you can without losing speed.36
Obviously, you have to be discrete in using this tracking to learn the language in a live situation. ―Live‖ tracking, tracking actual conversation of your Kuna friends, is best. It is probably better to tell your Kuna friends what you are doing and why you are tracking their speech. Track in a very subdued voice. If there is objection to it, stop at once and restrict your tracking to willing friends or tapes.
Tracking tapes is also useful. If you track the same text (story or conversation) over and over it will help you master the patterns. You should try to track different types of conversations, stories and speech styles since each has its own characteristic pattern. Pitch, rhythm, speed, intensity, crescendo and decrescendo, range of tone, and other more subtle features blend until each type of talking has its own distinctive ―tune‖ or set of ―tunes.‖
Types of intonation include: question-answer, travelogue, folktale, description, explanation, teaching, exhorting, procedural explanation, argument, etc. You should track one type at a time until the patterns are learned.
Exercise 1. Tracking drill
Track the teacher as he says Dialogue 9.1. Be sure to keep within two or three syllables behind him at all times. The exercise should be repeated several times.
Exercise 2. Intonation drill
Dramatize the above Dialogue 9.1 with two students playing the roles of the nurse and the mother. The teacher will be listening and checking for 1) correct intonation patterns, 2) correct pronunciation, and 3) correct gestures.
Exercise 3. Intonation drill
Drill the problem sentences, sounds, and gestures encountered in Exercise 2 above.
9.3 Culture
The concepts of the origin of sickness, the treatment of the sick and the philosophy of medicine vary from culture to culture. Kuna tradition says that all sickness is from God‘s house and it is usually sent to someone as a punishment for misdeeds done by either the sick person or his family.

36 Healey, Alan. 1975. Language Learner's Field Guide. SIL, Papua New Guinea.

104

Basic Health/Medical Discussion

People who are very ill remain in their hammocks. Generally speaking, the wife or the mother of the sick person caters to his/her needs. Should both adults of a household be sick, the female children may help with their care. Mothers of the sick people also help. If neither adult has parents, and the children are unable to help, the responsibility does not naturally rest on any nonfamily member.
Medicine is usually dispensed by an ina tule ‗medicine man/shaman‘ who uses a variety of jungle herbs in conjunction with chants, burning incense, and sometimes wooden dolls to treat illnesses. (The ina tule never uses his skills to cause illness or death.) If there is no ina tule and one of the family members knows the appropriate jungle herb, he may administer it.
Medicine is considered to fall into three categories of strength: 1) the least potent, a poultice or ointment for external use, 2) the next most effective, a potion to be ingested, and 3) the most potent, a solution in which to bathe.
The sick may eat/drink what they prefer. If a food produces a bitter taste, it is considered contraindicated for the sick person during that particular disease. With certain herbal medicines, the patient may not eat or drink certain things; with others, he cannot bathe. When a Kuna receives medicine from an outsider he will often ask, ―May I eat/drink/bathe when I take this?‖
As barriers of communication and geography are broken down by means of radio and airplane, Kuna people are becoming more exposed to western medicine and medical facilities. In Panama today, many Kuna villages have small government-run clinics administered by trained local (often Kuna) medical auxiliaries. Serious cases may be flown to the provincial capitals or Panama City in government or commercial planes.

9.4 Grammar
Adjectives
Adjectives in Kuna, as in Spanish and English, are modifiers of a person or object and are used in conjunction with the noun in order to describe it more fully. Most Kuna adjectives are part of a noun phrase and convey a concept similar to the English/Spanish adjectival concept. Since some aspects of negation of adjectives and of Kuna color are unique, they are described apart from the general discussion on adjectives. The formation of attributive and existence sentences is also unique.

9.4.1 Word order of a noun phrase (Ex. 4–5) A noun phrase may consist of a noun, adjective and suffix, or of a noun modifying another noun.

9.4.1.1 Position of adjective in noun phrase In Kuna, unlike English, the adjective is placed after the noun.

Example Karpa tummad chi.

‗A large basket is (sitting) there.‘

9.4.1.2 Position of suffixes Up to this point, suffixes which are used in conjunction with a noun have always been attached to the noun.

Examples

1. neggin

‗in the house‘

2. ulgin

‗in the canoe‘

3. ¿Masde, igi mani? ‗The plantains, how much are they?‘

However, when the noun is modified by an adjective (e.g., ‗small‘, ‗red‘), the noun plus the adjective is considered as one unit (a noun phrase) in Kuna, and the suffix is added to the end of the noun phrase: noun + (adjective + suffix).

Examples 1. neg totogin 2. ul tummadgin

‗in the little house‘ ‗in the big canoe‘

9.4 Grammar

105

9.4.1.3 Noun modified by another noun
One noun may be used to modify another noun when it is necessary to talk about a specific part of a whole object. In this case, the (whole) object precedes the part of the object.

Examples

1. kallin nono

‗chicken head‘

2. ti nak

‗river mouth‘

Sometimes one noun is used to modify the meaning of the other noun. In this case the modifying noun comes first.

Examples 1. ormaked neg 2. ulmol ul 3. nono kal

‗meeting house‘ ‗sail boat‘ ‗skull bone‘

Exercise 4. Noun phrase varied substitution drill
The teacher says the frame and then a word from the list below. The student repeats the frame, inserting the adjective said by the teacher.

Examples Teacher: Machi ul tummad takcha.

Teacher: pin

Student: Machi ul pin takcha.

Teacher: Machi ul pin takcha.

Teacher: olobi

Student: Machi ul olobi takcha.

Frame

Machi ul ____ takcha.

‗The boy saw ____ canoe.‘

1. tummad

‗big‘

2. toto

‗small‘

3. pin

‗new‘

4. chered

‗old‘

5. olobi

‗empty‘

6. ena

‗full‘

7. nued

‗good‘

8. istar

‗bad‘

9. karki

‗expensive‘

10. muis

‗inexpensive‘

Exercise 5. Noun phrase suffix drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 in which the suffix is attached to the noun. The teacher then says the adjective. The student responds by inserting the adjective with the proper suffix into the sentence. The drill should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Es ulgin mai.

Teacher: toto

Student: Es ul totogin mai.

1a. Es ulgin mai.

‗The machete is in the canoe.‘

b. toto

‗small‘

2a. Es mesagin mai.

‗The machete is on the table.‘

b. kinnid

‗red‘

3a. Pundin nad.

‗The girl (on the one hand) went.‘

b. tummad

‗big‘

106

Basic Health/Medical Discussion

4a. Machidin pes. b. toto 5a. Machi yalbal nad. b. tummad

‗The boy (on the other hand) stayed.‘ ‗little‘ ‗The boy went to the mountain.‘ ‗big‘

9.4.1.4 Limitation of the noun phrase In general, a Kuna noun phrase may contain only one adjective. (A means of modifying a noun with more than one adjective is discussed in 9.4.4.3) There is, however, an exception. Occasionally, a noun and adjective are so closely associated in the mind of the speaker that they are considered one concept. Take, for example, the English words ―pink eye.‖ Although the phrase ―pink eye‖ is made up of two words, actually only one idea, a type of disease, is communicated.
The Kuna words tule tummad ‗leader‘ are an example of two words conveying one concept. A noun phrase which contains two words but one concept may be further modified by a number.
Example Tule tummad walpá nad. ‗The three leaders went.‘

9.4.2 Negation of adjectives (Ex. 6)
Although most negated adjectives function as do negated adjectives in English and Spanish, there is an idiomatic use of the negated adjective which is unique in Kuna (discussed below in 2). With few exceptions, the negation of an adjective varies according to whether the adjective ends in a vowel or a consonant.

9.4.2.1 Formation of negated adjectives Negated adjectives are formed by the use of the negative suffix: -chuli/-zhuli/-juli.

1) Negation of adjectives ending in a consonant
Adjectives that end in a consonant are negated by use of the negative forms -chuli/-zhuli following the adjective.

Examples 1a. chered b. cheredzhuli 2a. nued b. nuedzhuli

‗old‘ ‗not old‘ ‗good‘ ‗not good‘

2) Negation of adjectives ending in a vowel
Adjectives that end in a vowel are negated by the addition of -juli to the adjective.

Examples 1a. kollo b. kollojuli 2a. toto b. totojuli

‗ripe‘ ‗not ripe‘ ‗small‘ ‗not small‘

3) Exception in negated adjective formation
Two common exceptions in the formation of negated adjectives ending in a consonant involve the words tummad ‗big‘ and muis ‗cheap‘. In the case of the former, the consonant is dropped and the negative suffix -juli is added to the adjective. In the case of the latter, s + ch becomes d.

Examples 1a. tummad/tummadi b. tummajuli

‗big‘ ‗not big‘

9.4 Grammar

107

2a. muis b. muiduli

‗inexpensive‘ ‗not inexpensive‘

9.4.2.2 Common significance of negated adjectives
The most common meaning of a negated adjective is similar to the meaning of the negated adjective in English/Spanish.

Examples

1a. istar

‗bad‘

b. istarchuli

‗not bad‘

2a. olobi

‗empty‘

b. olobijuli

‗not empty‘

When it has this meaning, the first syllable of the negative suffix tends to be stressed.

Example olobijúli

‗not empty‘

9.4.2.3 Idiomatic use of negated adjectives
Sometimes the use of a negated adjective does more than simply negate an attribute. When a person chooses to use the negated form of certain adjectives in preference to an existing antonym, a very intense antithesis is communicated. In this case, the use of the negated adjective completely eliminates any characteristic of the concept negated.

Examples

1. iche

‗a little‘

2. ichejuli

‗not a little (a lot)‘

In this construction, the syllable preceding the negative suffix tends to be stressed.

Example ichéjuli

‗not a little (a lot)‘

The intensification of antithesis is a phenomenon which occurs only with certain adjectives. Some adjectives that are used to intensify antithesis are in the following list.

Examples
1. totojuli 2. purwijuli 3. tutujuli 4. tinnajuli 5. karkijuli 6. muiduli 7. ichejuli 8. tikajuli

Direct Translation ‗not small‘ ‗not tiny‘ ‗not soft‘ ‗not dry‘ ‗not expensive‘ ‗not cheap‘ ‗not a little‘ ‗not nearby‘

Idiomatic Significance ‗big‘ ‗large‘ ‗hard‘ ‗damp/wet‘ ‗inexpensive‘ ‗expensive‘ ‗a lot‘ ‗far away‘

Exercise 6. Negated adjective drill
The teacher says Sentence 1. The student responds by repeating the modified noun with the negated form of the adjective and omitting the verb used in Sentence 1. The succeeding sentences are drilled in a similar fashion.

Examples Teacher: Ul toto nai.

Student: Ul totojuli.

Teacher: Win purwi pukwa.

Student: Win purwijuli.

1. Ul toto nai.

‗A small boat is (there).‘

2. Win purwi pukwa.

‗Tiny beads are (sitting) (there).‘

108

3. Neg tika chi. 4. Mol karki pakcha. 5. Ochi tutu kunnai. 6. Sabured tinna nai.

‗The house is (sitting) nearby.‘ ‗I bought expensive cloth.‘ ‗I am eating a soft candy.‘ ‗The sabured is (suspended) dry.‘

9.4.3 Colors (Ex. 7–10)
Color plays a very important role in Kuna culture and the Kuna concept of color varies considerably from the English/Spanish view. Therefore, a brief overview of the Kuna color system is given here for the language learner.37

Truly beautiful colors from a Kuna standpoint are colors which are classified as ―pure‖ colors. Each of the five ―pure‖ colors has a name:

1. kinnid

‗red‘

2. kollogwad

‗yellow‘

3. arrad

‗blue‘

4. chibu

‗white‘

5. chichid

‗black‘

All other colors are inferior and less highly valued. The five pure colors comprise the base points of a two-way

color distinction; spectral colors and shades of intensity.

9.4.3.1 Spectral colors
Spectral colors are those colors which occur on a color spectrum. The primary colors on the spectrum have specific names, others are given coined names.

1) Primary color names
The primary colors, in the order in which they are listed below, comprise the base and mid-points of the Kuna color spectrum. They are all pure colors and, therefore, highly valued, but red is the most appealing of all:

1. kinnid 2. kollogwad38
3. arrad

‗red‘ ‗yellow‘ ‗blue‘

2) Coined terms for color
Secondary colors between the base and mid-points on the spectrum, that is, those such as orange, green, and violet, do not have specific names, and are often referred to by coined terms that may vary from one speaker to another. The coined tem is derived from the name of a familiar object of similar color plus a color suffix -gid.

Examples 1. kwili apchalgid 2. chapkalegid

‗the color of parakeet feathers (lime green)‘ ‗the color of a leaf (green)‘

37 A more-detailed discussion of Kuna color perspective is found in ―Spectral colors and intensity in Paya Kuna color terminology‖, Wilma Forster, forthcoming.
38 Although kollogwad ‗yellow‘ is a coined term derived from kollo ‗ripe‘ plus -gwad, it usually occurs in this form, but sometimes in a given context a yellow object may be referred to simply as kollo ‗yellow‘. All Kunas use this term for ―yellow‖ and treat it as a pure color. In phrases such as kollo chibugwad ‗whitened yellow‘ note that -gwad is attached to the modifier rather than to kollo.

9.4 Grammar

109

9.4.3.2 Shades of intensity
The pure colors white and black serve as the reference points for indicating intensity of all the spectral colors. Lighter or darker colors can be referred to by the addition of all degrees of shades ranging from white through various shades of gray to black. Unlike English/Spanish, the degrees of shade intensity are assigned specific names.

Examples 1. chibugwad 2. allulugwad 3. purrugwad 4. kuturrugwad 5. chichigwad

‗whitish‘ ‗grayish white‘ ‗grayish‘ ‗grayish black‘ ‗blackish‘

9.4.3.3 Interpretation of color
As shown in the preceding paragraphs, Kunas refer to the color of an item which is interpreted as black, white, primary or secondary, by a specific name or by a coined tem. The colors of other items, such as maroon, steel blue, or pastels which are not intrinsic to a color spectral chart, are interpreted in terms of shade of intensity. Such colors may be named only for the specific shade of intensity and the presence of a spectral color may be ignored in the naming. On the other hand, the color may be referred to by modifying the shade of intensity with the word for the appropriate spectral color.
For example, a pastel pink may be referred to as chibugwad ‗whitish‘, kinnid chibugwad ‗whitish red‘, or islub chibugwad ‗the whitened color of wild plum‘. Another example is navy blue. Navy may be referred to as kuturreged ‗grayish black‘, arrad kuturreged ‗blackish blue‘, or purrin kuturreged ‗the grayish-black color of a blue bird‘.

9.4.3.4 Equivalent color suffix
Many colors do not fit easily into the two-way system of color distinctions: spectral and shades of intensity. Kunas refer to colors which are similar to their view of a ―pure‖ color, or like another familiar object, or in the general area of a shade of intensity by using an equivalent suffix attached to the color term. Equivalent suffixes include:

-gid(i)/-kid(i)

‗the kind of‘

-gwad(i)/-kwad(i) ‗has the quality/characteristic of‘ -tiki/-diki39‗on the side of/leans toward‘

-jaled(i)/-chaled(i)/-zhaled(i) ‗at the point of becoming‘

-yob(i) ‗like‘

-ged(i)/-ked(i) ‗being ____‘ -takleged(i)/-dageleged(i)* ‗____ looking‘

Examples

1. pukwagid

‗a kind of ñampi (purple)‘

2. kinnigwad

‗has the quality of red‘

3. arraddiki

‗on the side of a blue (color)‘

4. kollodikigwad*

‗leaning toward the characteristic of yellow‘

5. chibujaled

‗at the point of becoming white‘

6. arradzhaled

‗at the point of becoming blue‘

7. chiayob

‗chocolate-like‘

39 Intervocalically these forms begin with t, however, they begin with a d following lenis consonants (same=*).

‗being grayed‘ ‗red looking‘

9.4.3.5 Color questions
In addition to content questions discussed in Section 4.4.3, there is a color question. A color question is used to inquire about the color of an object and is formed by the use of the word ¿Igid? ‗What color (is it)?‘

Examples 1. ¿Molde, igid? 2. ¿Ulde, igid? 3. ¿Mol igid?

‗The mola, what color (is it)?‘ ‗The canoe, what color (is it)?‘ ‗What color cloth?‘

Exercise 7. Pure color drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it. The student repeats Sentence 1, changing to the -ne ‗going to ...‘ form. The student then repeats Sentence 1, changing to the -cha ‗completed aspect‘ form. The teacher says Sentence 2, etc.

Example Teacher: An mol kinnid pakpi.

Student: An mol kinnid pakpi.

Student: An mol kinnid pakne.

Student: An mol kinnid pakcha.

1. An mol kinnid pakpi.

‗I want to buy red cloth.‘

2. An mol kollo pakpi.

‗I want to buy yellow cloth.‘

3. An mol arrad pakpi.

‗I want to buy blue/green cloth.‘

4. An mol chibu pakpi.

‗I want to buy white cloth.‘

5. An mol chichid pakpi.

‗I want to buy black cloth.‘

Exercise 8. Equivalent color suffix drill
The teacher says the shade of Color Suffix 1 below. Then the teacher says the colors A–E one by one. The student adds Suffix 1 to each of the colors said by the teacher. The teacher says the shade of Color Suffix 2. Then the teacher says the colors A–E one by one. The student adds Suffix 2 to each of the colors said by the teacher, etc.

Examples Teacher: -gwad Teacher: chibu Student: chibugwad Teacher: chichid Student: chichigwad Teacher: kinnid Student: kinnigwad Teacher: -takleged Teacher: chibu Student: chibutakleged Teacher: chichid Student: chichitakleged
1. -gwad 2. -takleged 3. -yob

A. chibu B. chichid C. kinnid

The teacher replies to the student by inserting the word used modified by one of the colors A–E. This exercise may be repeated with the role of teacher and student reversed.

Example Teacher: An mol nika.

Student: ¿Mol igid?

Teacher: An mol kinnid nika.

Exercise 10. Shade of intensity naming drill
Each student should obtain a color sample chart from a local paint dealer. The student should write the names of ten of the colors on the chart. The color names assigned to paint samples should subsequently be discussed in class.

9.4.4 Attributive sentence (Ex. 11–14)
The Kuna formation of an attributive sentence differs from the Spanish/English equivalent, el está chiquito ‗he is small‘ in that only the noun and adjective are used; the verb (ser/estar ‗to be‘) is omitted.

Example Ul toto.

‗The canoe (is) small.‘

9.4.4.1 Intonation of the attributive sentence
The intonation pattern of an attributive sentence differs from that of a transitive or intransitive statement. There is a pause between the noun and the adjective. The pitch of the final syllable of the noun is raised, and the pitch of the final syllable of the adjective is lowered.

Exercise 11. Attributive frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times. The intonation is the crucial part of this drill.

Examples Teacher: Machi orojuli.

Student: Machi orojuli.

Teacher: Kukualed totojuli.

Student: Kukualed totojuli.

1. Machi orojuli.

‗The boy is very tall.‘

2. Kukualed totojuli.

‗The plane is large.‘

3. Mimmi ye.

‗The baby is sick.‘

4. Akwa chellele.

‗The rock is hard.‘

5. Tule chered.

‗The Kuna (person) is old.‘

112

Basic Health/Medical Discussion

Exercise 12. Attributive sentence drill
The teacher gives the stimulus in the form of a noun phrase. The student replies in the form of an attributive sentence.

Example Teacher: An win purwi pei.

Student: Win purwi.

1. An win purwi pei.

‗I want small beads.‘

2. An ina kakpi kobzha.

‗I drank bitter medicine.‘

3. An wawadun kollo kucha.

‗I ate ripe bananas.‘

4. An mol karki pakcha.

‗I bought expensive cloth.‘

5. An machi orojul takcha.

‗I saw a very tall boy.‘

9.4.4.2 Establishment of attributive sentence topic
If it is necessary to establish the topic (see Appendix E.1) of an attributive sentence, the suffix -de/-te is added to the noun.

Example Machide orojuli.

‗The boy is very tall.‘

Exercise 13. Topic establishing frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times. The student should concentrate on the attributive sentence intonation pattern while doing this drill.

Examples Teacher: Machide orojuli

Student: Machide orojuli.

Teacher: Kukualedde totojuli.

Student: Kukualedde totojuli.

1. Machide orojuli.

‗The boy is very tall.‘

2. Kukualedde totojuli.

‗The plane is large.‘

3. Mimmide ye.

‗The baby is sick.‘

4. Akwade chellele.

‗The rock is hard.‘

5. Tulede cheredi.

‗The person (Kuna) is old.‘

9.4.4.3 Use of attributive sentence with noun phrase
As is mentioned in this lesson (see 9.4.1), a noun phrase may contain only one adjective. A noun may be modified with two adjectives by incorporating a noun phrase into an attributive sentence.

Example

1. Mol kinnid karki.

‗The red cloth is expensive.‘

2. Mol karki kinnid.

‗The expensive cloth is red.‘

As may be seen in the above example, one adjective follows the noun and the one selected as attribute or stated adjective follows the first adjective. In this type of attributive sentence, intonation is vital to communication. The pause between the two adjectives is very important.

Exercise 14. Noun phrase in an attributive sentence frame drill:
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it. This exercise should be repeated several times. Pay special attention to the intonation.

Example Teacher: Mol kinnid karki. Student: Mol kinnid karki.
1. Mol kinnid karki. 2. Akan tummad karki.

‗The red cloth is expensive.‘ ‗The big axe is expensive.‘

9.4 Grammar

113

3. Ul pin karki. 4. Ina arrad ochi. 5. Es toto nued.

‗The new canoe is expensive.‘ ‗The blue medicine is sweet.‘ ‗The little knife is nice.‘

9.4.5 Useful expressions for personal needs
It is important to be able to use two common expressions for personal needs and to be able to determine by questioning, how a person feels. Although they are expressed by an adjective, a noun is used in Kuna for ―hungry‖ and ―thirsty‖ and, frequently, ―sick‖ is expressed by a noun.

9.4.5.1 Hunger and thirst Only one word, ukul/ukulu is used to describe both hunger and thirst in Kuna.

Example An ukul nika.

‗I am hungry/thirsty.‘ (lit.: ‗I have hunger/thirst.‘)

9.4.5.2 Sickness
Various Kuna words refer to being sick, however; the most common are the adjective ye ‗sick‘ and the noun poni ‗sickness‘. The term poni also means ‗problem‘.

Examples 1. An ye. 2. An poni nika.

‗I am sick.‘ ‗I have (a) sickness/problem.‘

9.4.5.3 General health question
There are two common questions that may be used to refer to the general state of a person‘s health or well being.

Examples 1. ¿Ibi nika? 2. ¿Igi ito?

‗What is the matter?/What (disease) do you have?‘ ‗How do you feel?‘

9.4.6 Suffix of excess -rba41
An expression which parallels the English construction ‗(one) who ____ excessively/in excess‘ is conveyed by adding the suffix -rba to the long form of the verb stem.

Examples 1. We tule kal nikarba. 2. We tule kwallu nikarba. 3. We tule mas kunnerba. 4. We tule ua chwaerba.

‗That person is excessively (extremely) strong.‘ ‗That person is excessively fat.‘ ‗That person is a glutton.‘ (lit.: ‗He eats excessively.‘) ‗That person is a fanatic fisherman.‘ (lit.: ‗He fishes excessively.‘)

9.4.7 Existence sentence (Ex. 15)
An existence sentence parallels the Spanish/English construction, Hay elefantes. ‗There are elephants‘. It confirms or negates the existence of something. The Kuna existence clause is formed by stating the noun which exists, followed by the verb nika ‗to have‘. Generally speaking, nika is used in the same sense of a person/animal owning or possessing something. In the case of possession, an owner, and sometimes the object owned, are named with the verb.

41 -rba is actually derivational suffix -r ‗adjectivizer‘ (used with a verb) plus -ba ‗adjective intensifier‘. For example, yer ‗fine/good‘ and yerba ‗very good‘.

114

Basic Health/Medical Discussion

Examples

1. An nika.

‗I have (it).‘

2. An mani nika.

‗I have money.‘

In the case of an existence sentence, only the object which exists occurs with the verb nika ‗to have‘. Usually the context makes the meaning of an existence sentence clear.

Example Mani nika.

‗There is money.‘

Exercise 15. Existence sentence listing drill
Track the teacher as he says the sentences below. The teacher says the whole utterance and the student repeats it.

1. Koe nika, yannu nika, chule nika; tegine ‗There are deer, peccaries, pacas, and jaguars in the

achu parpad nika, chapurbal.

2. Kwinub nika, tiur nika, tola nika; tegine arki ‗There are sabalos, sabalettas, catfish and huacucos in

nika, tigin.

the river.‘

3. Mas nika, mam nika, moe nika; tegine aswe ‗There are plantains, manioc, squash and avocados in

nika, choneggin.

the kitchen.‘

10 GROUPING OBJECTS, PEOPLE, OR ACTIONS

10.1 Dialogue
Grouping of objects, people and actions is a very important aspect of conversation; several illustrations of it occur in the following dialogue.

1. Old man

¿Machi, pia ne?

(calling out):

The young man approaches the older man.

‗Young man, where are (you) going?‘

2. Young man: 3. Old man: 4. Young man:
5. Old man: 6. Young man: 7. Old man: 8. Young man: 9. Old man: 10. Young man: 11. Old man: 12. Young man: 13. Old man: 14. Young man:
15. Old man: 16. Young man: 17. Old man: The young man leaves.

Pukurbal ne. Mmmm. ¿Toa ne? Anni, Ricardo, Enrique; walapá ne. ¿Ricardo nemo? Eye, nemo. Aaa. ¿Inkwa noniko? Pane. Ajáj. ¿Sagladin wis? Eye, wiji. Nabirde. ¿Pe akwati pako? Eye. An peimo. Nabiri. An galongwen pega pako. Nuedi. An nebi, tada. Eye.

‗(I‘m) going to Pucuru.‘ ‗Oh! Who is going?‘ ‗Richard, Henry and I, (three of us) are going to go.‘
‗Richard too?‘ ‗Yes, he is going too.‘ ‗Oh! When will you return?‘ ‗Tomorrow.‘ ‗Uh huh! Does the chief know?‘ ‗Yes, (he) knows.‘ ‗Fine. Will you buy kerosene, then?‘ ‗Yes.‘ ‗I want (some) too.‘ ‗Okay. I will buy a gallon for you.‘
‗Thank you.‘ ‗I need to go, grandfather.‘ ‗Okay.‘

10.2 Pronunciation (Ex. 1–3)
Exercise 1. Tracking the dialogue
Track the teacher as he says Dialogue 10.1 Be sure to keep within two or three syllables behind him at all times. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Exercise 2. Dramatizing the dialogue
Dramatize Dialogue 10.1 with two students playing the roles. The teacher will be listening and checking for 1) correct intonation patterns, 2) correct pronunciation, and 3) correct gestures. The teacher should explain and demonstrate any gestures which would help the drama be more natural. Students should incorporate such gestures into the role-playing exercise.
Exercise 3. Drill of problem areas
Drill the sentences and sounds and gestures from Exercise 2 which the students found difficult or unnatural.

10.3 Culture
A Kuna is expected to ask for permission from the chief, in order to go on a trip. Permission is usually requested at a town meeting. If, however, the necessity for the trip is urgent, the permission may be given at any time. In requesting permission for the trip, the person is expected to give the destination and purpose of the trip, and the length of time he expects to be away from the village.
When there is a message to be sent, the chief asks someone to hand-carry the message. The chief may only request, he cannot demand, that someone take the message.
A Kuna, generally, does not travel alone. He travels with one or more companions. This aspect of the culture is an important one to you, especially if you are requesting that a job be done in another area, or if you are requesting a guide. A Kuna guide expects a companion to go with him, in order that he does not need to return from your destination alone. Both the guide and the companion are given wages.

10.4 Grammar

10.4.1 Verb tense-aspect (future) (Ex. 4–7)
An action that will occur at a future time is viewed as either occurring at an unspecific ―sometime‖ in the future, or at a specific time. Actions which occur at an unspecific time in the future use the future suffix -o attached to the verb stem (or the verb stem with any of the appropriate suffixes listed in Section 10.4.5). Actions that occur at a specific time use the immediate future aspect suffix -ne (see 3.4.2).

10.4.1.1 Future suffix When the time of the future action is unspecific, (―sometime‖), the future suffix -o43 is added to the verb stem or the verb stem with any of the appropriate suffixes (see 10.4.5).

Examples 1. An nao. 2. An kabi kobo.

‗I will go (sometime).‘ ‗I will drink coffee (sometime).‘

Exercise 4. Future suffix frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: An nao.

Student: An nao.

1. An nao.

‗I will go.‘

2. An kabo.

‗I will sleep.‘

3. An kobo.

‗I will drink.‘

4. An poo.

‗I will cry.‘

5. An purko.

‗I will die.‘

Exercise 5. Future suffix drill
The teacher says the verb stem and the student adds the future aspect suffix to the verb stem.

Example Teacher: eli

Student: elio

1. eli 2. aptake44

‗to clean‘ ‗to wait‘

43 The long form of this suffix is -oe. 44 See Appendix G.

118

Grouping Objects, People, or Actions

3. chi 4. tu

‗to be (sitting)‘ ‗to cook‘

10.4.1.2 Immediate future suffix in contrast with the future suffix
In referring to actions which will take place in the future it is important that you understand the situations in which the immediate future suffix -ne is indicated versus the situations in which the future suffix -o is indicated.

When the time of a future action is specified, the immediate future suffix -ne is added to the verb. The time may be specified, for example, pan ‗tomorrow‘ or ibaboje ‗in two days‘, or it may be understood to refer to the time the speaker is speaking.

Examples

1. Yoroku, an mas kunne.

‗At noon, I am going to eat.‘

2. Nan mas tune.

‗Mother is going to cook.‘

(The use of the immediate future suffix -ne indicates that the time refers to the time of the utterance, i.e., ―now‖.)

3. Nan mas tuo.

‗Mother is going to cook.‘

(The use of the future suffix indicates that the time is unspecific, i.e., ―sometime‖.)

When a time word is used it usually means that the action will take place at a specific time in the future. However, occasionally a person wishes to communicate that ―sometime‖ during a stated period of time, an action will take place. In this case, although the time is specified, the future suffix -o is added. This construction is very rare.

Examples 1. Pane an kabi kobo. 2. Chedo an mas tuo.

‗Tomorrow (sometime) I will drink coffee.‘ ‗This evening (sometime) I will cook plantains.‘

10.4.1.3 Future of positional verbs
The future of positional verbs is formed by adding the future suffix -o to the short form of the positional verb. Thus, when nai, mai, ti, etc., refer to a position or state rather than an action, they do not occur with -ne ‗immediate future‘.

Examples 1. An webal maio. 2. Eswal ilagin kwichio. 3. Pirkagwenche pe ampak tio.

‗I will be there.‘ ‗The spear will be standing by the wall.‘ ‗In a year‘s time, you will be (go about) with me.‘

Exercise 6. Immediate future suffix review drill
Review the discussion of the immediate future suffix in Section 3.4.2. Do as many of the exercises as are necessary to reinforce the use of -ne, paying special attention to the need for a specific time reference.

Exercise 7. Immediate future versus future suffix drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says the time word and the student makes a sentence using the time word and changing the verb of Sentence 1 to a verb which uses the immediate future suffix. Sentence 2 is drilled in a similar manner.

10.4.2 Including an additional participant in an action (Ex. 8–9)

10.4.2.1 Participants viewed individually You may wish to refer to a participant performing an action with others, yet wish to view his participation separately from the participation of the others.
In English, one way of doing this is to name the new participant, the action, and the word ―too‖ or ―also‖ in a separate sentence. For example, ―John went. Peter went, too.‖ Or it can be expressed in a sentence such as, ―John went, and Peter also.‖
1) Reasons for viewing participants individually
There are several reasons for viewing participants individually.
a) Afterthought One of the most common reasons for viewing a participant in an action individually is the need for an afterthought. That is to say, you may start out by saying, ―John went.‖ Then you remember about Peter and add as an afterthought, ―Peter went too.‖
b) Separate roles A more important reason for viewing a participant in an action individually is that you want your hearer to keep sight of the different roles of the characters. An example of this is found in the story, Little Red Riding Hood: ―Little Red Riding Hood went on to grandmother‘s house. The wolf went, too.‖
In this example, there is a desire to keep the role of the heroine separate from the role of the villain.
c) Individual actions Another reason for viewing the participants of an action separately is that, for some reason, it is important to emphasize that the added participant also participated in the action. This may be accomplished in English by use of the word ―both‖ or ―all.‖ For example, ―John and Mary both went.‖ or ―Peter, John and Mary all went.‖

45 Ne, when used as the verb stem, means ‗going to go‘; when it is suffixed to another stem it means ‗going to ___‘.

120

Grouping Objects, People, or Actions

2) Including an additional participant construction
In Kuna, to refer to an additional individual participant who also performed the action, a separate sentence is used. That sentence restates the participant, and the action, and adds the suffix -mo to the verb referring to the action.

Example Juan nad. Pedro nanmo.46

‗John went. Peter went too.‘

a) Including an additional participant in an attributive sentence In the case of an attributive sentence, where no verb is expressed, the suffix -mo attaches to the attribute.

Example Pedro orojuli. Juan orojulmo.

‗Peter is tall. John is tall too.‘

b) Including an additional participant in a conversational exchange
In conversation, if you wish to include somebody else in the action to which the previous speaker just referred, repeat the verb he used and add -mo to it.

Examples 1. John: 2. Mary:

An ne.

‗I am going to go.‘

An nemo. ‗I am going to go, too.‘

10.4.2.2 Participants viewed as a group At times, it is necessary to group the different participants together and treat them as if they had acted as a unit. For example, ―John and Mary went.‖
There are at least two constructions for viewing participants as a group. Reference to participants as a group usually occurs in answer to a question or in making a statement.

1) Answer to a question
In Kuna, when an answer to a question includes a group of participants, the construction is handled by giving the name of one participant, the name of the other participant, the number of participants, and the verb: participant + participant + number of participants + verb.

Example Juan, María; walbo nad.

‗John, Mary; two went. (John and Mary went.)‘

2) Statement
If, however, you were merely stating that John and Mary went, you would use a generic term to include the people in the group, a verb, the name of a participant, the name of another participant, the number of people and a verb: generic term + verb; name of participant, name of other participant; number of participants + verb.

The generic term in this construction may be tulemal ‗people‘, amal ‗they‘, or the number which represents the participants such as walbo ‗two people‘.

Examples 1. Tulemal nade; Juan, María; walbo nade.
2. Amal nade; Juan, María; walbo nade. 3. Walbo nade; Juan, María; walbo nade.

‗People went; John, Mary; two went. (John and Mary went.)‘ ‗They went; John, Mary; two went. (John and Mary went.)‘ ‗Two went; John, Mary; two went. (John and Mary went.)‘

46 d becomes n before m.

10.4 Grammar

121

Exercise 8. -mo frame drill
In the following exercise, treat the participants as individuals, and include them in the same action. The teacher says Sentence 1. The teacher then names another participant to be added to the same action. The student responds by including both participants as individuals in the same action.

Example Teacher: Ome mol makne.

Teacher: pun

Student: Ome mol makne. Pun mol maknemo.

1a. Ome mol makne.

‗The woman is going to sew a blouse.‘

b. pun

‗girl‘

2a. Tad immal amine.

‗The elder is going to hunt (something).‘

b. machi

‗boy‘

3a. Sagla ua chwane.

‗The chief is going to fish.‘

b. machi

‗boy‘

4a. Machered mas kunne.

‗The man is going to eat.‘

b. ome

‗woman‘

Exercise 9. Viewing participants as a group drill
In the following exercise, treat the participants as a group and include them in the same action. The teacher says Sentence 1, then gives another participant to be added to the same action. The student responds by including both participants as individuals in the same action.

Example Teacher: Ome mol makne.

Teacher: pun Student: Ome , puna;47 walbo mol makne.

1a. Ome mol makne.

‗The woman is going to sew a blouse.‘

b. pun

‗girl‘

2a. Tad immal amine.

‗The elder is going to hunt (something).‘

b. machi

‗boy‘

3a. Sagla ua chwane.

‗The chief is going to fish.‘

b. machi

‗boy‘

4a. Machered mas kunne.

‗The man is going to eat food.‘

b. ome

‗woman‘

10.4.3 Associating one action with another action

10.4.3.1 Associating two different actions or repeating the same action
Two different, but approximately simultaneous actions, may be brought together by adding the suffix -bal/-pal to the second verb. The English equivalent of this construction is ―too‖ or ―also.‖

Example

Machi mas kunne. Kabi komnebal.

‗The boy is going to eat food. (He) is going to drink coffee too.‘

The suffix -bal can also be added to a verb in order to refer to an action which is repeated. The English

equivalent to this construction is the word ―again.‖

47 This construction uses a listing pattern, and the long form of the word is used (see 5.4.2).

122

Grouping Objects, People, or Actions

Examples 1. Machi atas. Mas kunnebal. 2. Machi nadbal.

‗The boy awakened. (He) is going to eat again.‘ ‗The boy went again.‘

10.4.3.2 Associating different actions which occur in a time sequence
If one action does not take place until the other action is at least started, the two actions are joined by the conjunction tegin ‗then‘.

Examples 1. Machi mas kunne. Tegin ua chwane. 2. Pab chapur kugne. Tegin aros tigne.

‗The boy is going to eat. Then he is going fishing.‘
‗Father is going to burn fields. Then he is going to plant rice.‘

10.4.4 Repetition of an attribute (state) (Ex. 10–11)
In an attributive sentence, if the state referred to by the attribute is repeated, the suffix -bal/-pal is attached to the attribute (adjective).

Example Mimmi yebal.

‗The baby is sick again.‘

Exercise 10. Repetitive action frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: An mas kunnebal.

Student: An mas kunnebal.

1. An mas kunnebal.

‗I am going to eat food again.‘

2. An ob tignebal.

‗I am going to plant corn again.‘

3. An ua tunebal.

‗I am going to cook fish again.‘

4. An mas kuchabal.

‗I ate food again.‘

5. An ob tigzhabal.

‗I planted corn again.‘

6. An ua tusbal.

‗I cooked fish again.‘

7. An mas kumpalo.

‗I will eat food again.‘

8. An ob tigbalo.

‗I will plant corn again.‘

9. An ua tubalo.

‗I will cook fish again.‘

10. An palu nikpal.

‗I have salt again.‘

Exercise 11. Stimulus response drill
The teacher gives the stimulus in the form of a statement. The student responds using the -bal/-pal ‗again‘ form.

Example Teacher: Machi ul chomne.

Student: Machi ul chomnebal.

1. Machi ul chomne.

‗The boy is going to make a canoe.‘

2. Ome mol makcha.

‗The woman sewed a blouse.‘

3. Wag ostigid nika.

‗The outsider has sugar.‘

4. Machi aswe chus.

‗The boy fetched an avocado.‘

5. Pun mu kolne.

‗The girl is going to call grandmother.‘

6. Sagla koe mecha.

‗The chief killed a deer.‘

10.4.5 Order of suffixes following the verb (Ex. 12–13)
It is important to recognize that suffixes occur in a specific order following the verb stem. To make the order of suffixes easier to remember, suffixes are grouped below and the groups are numbered in the order in which they appear following the verb stem. Group I comes directly after the verb stem, Group II follows Group I, etc:48 verb + Group I49 + Group II + Group III + ...

Group I - immediate future suffix -ne (see 3.4.2 and 10.4.1), completive aspect suffix -che/-zhe/-je (see 4.4.1), present progressive (see 6.4.2) and desiderative -bi/-pi (see 2.4.2). (See also Appendix F for alternate order of -bi/-pi.)

Group II - group marker suffix -mal (see 8.4.3.1)

Group III - -bal/-pal ‗again‘ (see 10.4.3 and 10.4.4)

Group IV - -mo ‗too‘ (see 10.4.2.1)

Group V - future suffix -o (see 10.4.1.1 and 10.4.1.2)

Examples

1. Verb + Group I + Group III

Ome mol pakchabal.

‗The woman bought cloth again.‘

2. Verb + Group III + Group IV

Juan nebalmo.

‗John is going to go again too.‘

3a. Verb + Group I + Group III + Group IV

An mol maknebalmo.

‗I am going to sew again too.‘

b. Pan an mas kunnebalmo.

‗Tomorrow I am going to eat plantains again too.‘

4. Verb + Group III + Group V

Machi tagbalo.

‗The boy will come again.‘

5. Verb + Group IV + Group V

An mas kunmoo.

‗I will eat again (sometime).‘

6. Verb + Group I + Group II + Group III

Machergandin yannu aminebalmal.

‗The men are (all) going to go hunting peccary again.‘

7. Verb + Group II + Group III + Group IV

Machimaldina nemalbalmo.

‗The boys are (all) going to go again too.‘

Exercise 12. Grouping of suffixes
The most common grouping of suffixes is the grouping of Groups I, III, and IV. For that reason, we will drill these groups in the following exercise.

The student says Sentence a.

Tad cho chikne.

‗The grandfather is going to cut firewood.‘

Add Sentence b saying that the participant b is also going to perform the action of Sentence a.

Tad cho chikne. Machi cho chiknemo.

‗The grandfather is going to cut firewood. The boy is going to cut firewood, too.‘

Construct Sentence c which says that participant b is going to repeat his action.

Machi cho chiknebal.

‗The boy is going to cut firewood again.‘

Repeat Sentences a and b, inserting Sentence d, which says that participant a is going to repeat his action, then adding Sentence c, modified to say that participant b is going to repeat his action, also.

48 See Appendix M, for a list of all the verb suffixes treated in this grammar. 49 Groups I and V are mutually exclusive: one or the other may occur, but both may not occur in a given verb.

124

Grouping Objects, People, or Actions

Tad cho chikne. Machi cho chiknemo. Tad ‗Grandfather is going to cut firewood. The boy is going to

cho chiknebal. Machi cho chiknebalmo.

cut firewood also. The grandfather is going to cut firewood again. The boy is going to cut firewood again too.‘

1a. Tad cho chikne.

‗The elder is going to cut firewood.‘

b. machi

‗boy‘

c. chikne

‗cut‘

d. tad

‗elder/grandfather (indicating respect rather than kinship)‘

2a. Mu kachi chobzha.

‗Grandmother made a hammock.‘

b. amma

‗aunt‘

c. chobzha

‗made‘

d. mu

‗grandmother‘

3a. Pun ua tubi.

‗The girl wants to cook fish.‘

b. ome

‗woman‘

c. tubi

‗wants to cook‘

d. pun

‗girl‘

Exercise 13. -bal/-mo/-din selection drill
Consider the following sentences as a continuous story, but with many of the connectives missing. Fill the blank spaces with the suffix -bal, -mo, or -din where appropriate, i.e., not every word will need to have a suffix.

Example Student: Sae sagla koe mecha.

Machidin koe mechamo.

Kujal machi koe mechabal.

1. Sae sagla koe mecha.

‗Yesterday the chief killed a deer.‘

2. Machi____ koe mecha____.

‗As for the boy, he also killed a deer.‘

3. Kujal machi____ koe mecha____.

‗Later, the boy killed a deer again.‘

4. Sagla____ koe mecha____.

‗The chief killed a deer again too.‘

5. Ome____ mol makcha____.

‗The woman sewed a mola.‘

6. Pun____ mol makcha____.

‗As for the girl, she also sewed a mola.‘

7. Machi____ toto____ ye____.

‗The little boy is sick.‘

8. Mimmi____ ye____.

‗As for the little girl, she is sick too.‘

9. Immisdin, mimmi ye____.

‗Today, the little girl is sick again.‘

10.4.6 Vocative The vocative has no special form in Kuna.50 The use of the vocative closely parallels its use in English.

10.4.6.1 Vocative sentence initial
The vocative occurs at the beginning of the sentence if the speaker wants to call the attention of the person to whom he wishes to speak.

Example ¿Machi, pia ne?

‗Young fellow, where are you going?‘

10.4.6.2 Vocative sentence final
The vocative occurs at the end of the sentence if it is to confirm that what was said was directed to a certain person.

50 Nanu is an exception; it is an alternative long form for the word nana ‗mother‘, which is used only as a vocative to express very intense emotion.

10.4 Grammar

125

Example An ne, tada.

‗I am going, sir.‘

Long and short forms of words may be used as a vocative. Long forms usually indicate intense emotion such as fear, frustration, or anger.

Example ¡Paba, an tobe!

‗Father, I‘m frightened!‘

When employing a vocative, it is more common to use the role, status, or kinship term for a person, than his proper name.

Example Yai, an ne.

‗Older brother, I am going.‘

10.4.7 Indirect object (Ex. 14)
The indirect object in Kuna functions in approximately the same way that it does in English. For example, ―I gave the ball to the boy‖ specifies the person to whom the ball was given as the boy (indirect object).

In Kuna, the indirect object usually occurs after the subject and before the direct object and verb in transitive sentences, or before a verb of ―saying.‖ It is marked by the addition of the suffix -ga/-ka to the noun, proper name or pronoun.

Examples

1. An pega mol ukcha.

‗I gave the blouse to you.‘

2. An machiga chogzha.

‗I said (it) to the boy.‘

If, however, the indirect object is in focus, it occurs after the verb.

Examples 1. An mol ukcha, pega. 2. An chogzha, machiga.

‗I gave the cloth to you.‘ ‗(I said (it) to the boy. (I told the boy.)‘

Exercise 14. Indirect object substitution frame drill
The teacher repeats the frame. The teacher selects a word from the list below that can be substituted in the frame and says it. The student then substitutes the word in the correct place in the frame.

Example Teacher: An pega chegar ukcha.

Teacher: ai

Student: An aiga chegar ukcha.

Frame An ____-ga/-ka chegar ukcha. ‗I gave matches to ____.‘

1. pe

‗you‘

2. pab

‗father‘

3. nan

‗mother‘

4. mu

‗grandmother/respected older lady‘

5. tad

‗grandfather/respected older man‘

6. ai

‗friend‘

10.4.8 Affected (interested) object
A common usage of the suffix -ga/-ka is in a situation that affects the present speaker in a similar way to which it affected the original speaker. For example, when the original speaker says things are going well with him, the present speaker may say, ―It is going well with me, too.‖

Example Nuedmoga.

‗It is going well with me, too.‘

If the effect is to occur in the future, the -moga becomes -mogo.

Example Nuedmogo.

‗It will go well with me, too.‘

10.4.9 Habitual aspect51 (Ex. 15–16)
Certain events that we speak of happen regularly; they are habits, or customary. ―Tigers eat deer.‖ is an example of an habitual action. The event of a tiger eating deer is not a one-time event, but rather something that happens all the time, habitually. In English, the present tense of the verb is used to describe habitual actions. In Kuna, the short form of the verb stem is used alone without any suffix.

Example Achu parpad koe kun.

‗Tigers eat (habitually) deer.‘

Exercise 15. Habitual aspect frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Tule ua kun. Student: Tule ua kun.
1. Tule ua kun. 2. An ina che. 3. An mol pak. 4. An nugal unke. 5. An ome mol mak.

‗Kunas eat fish.‘ ‗I practice medicine.‘ ‗I (always) buy blouses.‘ ‗I (always) pull teeth.‘ ‗My wife (always) sews blouses.‘

Exercise 16. Habitual aspect drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student changes it to the habitual aspect form of the verb and adds the word pane-pane ‗everyday‘.52

Example Teacher: Machi ua kucha.

Student: Machi pane-pane ua kun.

1. Machi ua kucha.

‗The boy ate the fish.‘

2. Tad ua chwas.

‗The elder caught fish.‘

3. Pun mol enukcha.

‗The girl washed the clothes.‘

4. Mu mol makne.

‗The old lady is going to sew a blouse.‘

5. Ome mas tus.

‗The woman cooked food.‘

10.4.10 Adverbs (Ex. 17–18)
Adverbs in Kuna, as in English, modify the verb; but their position in the sentence is different from English word order. In Kuna, they occur after the subject and before the indirect or direct object: subject + adverb + indirect object + direct object + verb.

Subtle nuances of meaning are achieved by changing this basic word order and are discussed in later lessons.

Example Pab pirkin machi pilal.

‗The father loves the boy very much.‘

Exercise 17. Adverbial word order frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc.

51 Other uses of the habitual aspect are discussed in Section 12.4.1.2 and 19.4.9 52 In this grammar all reduplicated adverbs are written with a hyphen.

11 CONVERSATION CONTINUANCE

11.1 Dialogue
One of the main goals in speaking Kuna is to be able to maintain a conversation. The following dialogue gives some examples of ways to do so, considering yourself as the outsider or visitor in a Kuna village.

Traveller returns after a visit to the city.

1. Visitor:

¿Kep noni?

‗Have you just arrived?‘

2. Traveller: Eye.

‗Yes.‘

3. Visitor:

¿Pe nued arpi?

‗Did you have a good trip?‘

4. Traveller: Nueddo.

‗(Yes) it was fine.‘

5. Visitor:

Ajáj. ¿Pe urpade?

‗Oh! (What about) your younger brother?‘

6. Traveller: Nonimo.

‗He is back too.‘

7. Visitor:

Mmmm. ¿Pe kinki pakcha? ‗Mmmm. Did you buy a (hunting) rifle?‘

8. Traveller: Pakchado. Aptagwel.

‗Yes, I bought (one). Wait a minute.‘

The traveller gets up and gets out his new hunting rifle to show his friend.

9. Visitor (inspecting the rifle):
10. Traveller:
11. Visitor:
He gives the gun back.

Ma-a-achi. Kinki nued. ¿Igi manijun?
Karta tula atal ilabo. Ai-yai-yai. Mani tummad.

‗Wow! It‘s a good gun. How much did it cost?‘
‗$200.00‘ ‗Yikes! That‘s a lot of money.‘

12. Visitor:

¿Pia pe pakcha?

13. Traveller: Chinnogin.

14. Visitor:

A-a-a-a.

The visitor then goes on to ask about the trip itself.

‗Where did you buy it?‘ ‗From the Chinaman.‘ ‗Oh!‘

11.2 Pronunciation: Intonation of Conversation Sustainers (Ex. 1–3)
Conversation sustainers are comments or acknowledgements made by the listener in response to the speaker. They communicate to the speaker that the listener is taking in what is being said and that the speaker should keep talking. These sustainers tend to be short, often a single word or sound. English uses such conversation sustainers as, ‗Oh! Is that so!‘, ‗Really!‘, and ‗Mmmm!‘ Conversation sustainers have a characteristic long-drawn-out intonation pattern.
Exercise 1. Dialogue intonation drill
Mimic the teacher as he says Dialogue 11.1. Great care should be taken to draw out the conversation sustainers to their proper length.
Exercise 2. Dialogue 11.1 dramatization
Dramatize Dialogue 11.1 with two students playing the different roles. The teacher assists the student by encouraging correct pronunciation of words and appropriate use of gestures and facial expressions.
Exercise 3. Review
Discuss and drill any difficulties experienced in Exercises 1 and 2 above.

Conversation Continuance

11.3 Culture
Kuna people love to hear all the details of a trip. The recounting of a trip requires certain compulsory ―ingredients.‖ First, you must tell the situation which gave rise to the trip. This is followed by mentioning one by one each person of any consequence who accompanied you. After the people are listed, the number of people in the party (including the unnamed people, usually children) is stated.
You must then refer to the point of origin of the trip and the time of day that you departed on your journey. Not everyone owns a watch and consequently a general, rather than a specific time is adequate. The weather and trail conditions are not usually mentioned.
Most of the trails radiating out from the village have certain recognized ―checkpoints.‖ It is necessary to tell the approximate time you arrived at and departed from each of these points. It is also necessary to state what, if any, refreshments you had at the ―checkpoint.‖ Rivers of any size are always considered checkpoints. The river crossing is described in detail. Any wildlife spotted or shot in the jungle which would have been good for food is always mentioned. Where possible, the sighting of wildlife is related to known landmarks. Unusual dangers encountered are also described. Fallen trees do not usually elicit comment, except where a windstorm has uprooted many trees and the trail is blocked for over fifty yards or so.
Other people met on the trail and the purpose of their trip are mentioned. Often a speaker merely surmises their reason for travelling. As in the case of people travelling with the speaker, all significant people passed on the trail are listed by name, role or description. At the end of the list, the total number in the party (including unlisted people) is given. Details such as getting wet, blisters, and other minor mishaps are not usually mentioned.
None of the recognized ―checkpoints‖ can be omitted. In territory unfamiliar to the listener, the narrator can choose his own ―checkpoints.‖
Arrival at the destination lets your listener know you are nearing the end of the story. The time of arrival at the destination is very important to the listener. All the people expected to be at the destination are mentioned as being present/absent and well/ill. It is important to state where you stayed, how long you remained there and when you started back. The return journey may be described in great detail just as the outward journey was described; or only the arrival time at home need be mentioned. A yielding-the-floor expression tells the audience the story is over.
11.4 Grammar
An analysis of Kuna conversation reveals that a conversation may be generally divided into several parts. The ability to carry on a conversation and keep it going is a very important aspect of language learning. As you learn to carry on longer and longer conversations with the Kuna people, your understanding of the language and of the people themselves will increase dramatically.
You will usually find that your early attempts at making conversation result in fairly short dialogues. This may become frustrating. To help you begin using the art of conversation, plan ahead! Before going to visit, think out a topic of conversation and plan the words you will use. Some insight into various elements of Kuna conversation will help you plan a conversation and help you use your knowledge of the language.
A Kuna conversation is generally made up of several elements. Greetings are exchanged before any topic is discussed and then a topic must be established. Once a conversation is underway, the Kuna people use various sounds, words, phrases, and intonation to indicate whether the speaker wishes to keep talking on the same topic (sustaining the topic), keep talking but change the topic (holding the floor), allow someone else to speak about the topic (yielding the floor), or that he has finished speaking (waiving the floor). It is important to leave the room, thus, ending conversation, by using an appropriate farewell. In summary, elements of a Kuna conversation include:
1. Greeting 2. Establishment of topic 3. Sustaining the topic 4. Holding the floor

11.4 Grammar

131

5. Yielding the floor 6. Waiving the floor 7. Farewell

11.4.1 Greeting
Many greetings are used in Kuna. Two important factors in selecting the form of a greeting are your status/role in the Kuna society, in relation to the person to whom you are speaking, and the situation in which the greeting is given.

11.4.1.1 Relative status
As an outsider, your greetings will be more formal than greetings between Kunas, who have a more intimate relationship (family members or close friends), would be. Formality is not so much a matter of the form of greeting selected as the way one enters a house, or otherwise shows the proper respect.

11.4.1.2 Situation
The greeting will vary according to whether or not this is the first contact of the day, or whether one of the parties has been away on a trip, or just away to his field. Some greetings can be used for more than one situation.

11.4.1.3 Greetings used in the village

1) Arrival greeting
It is common for people to announce their arrival at a place (a house or another location) by saying the following:

Anná.

‗Hello/I‘ve come.‘

2) Successive arrival greeting
Subsequent arrivals at the same location are announced by saying the following:

An pemalzhe tanibal.

‗I‘ve come (back) again to you (all).‘

3) First greeting of the day
The greeting for the first encounter for the day (usually used only in the morning) is the following:

¿Ig oipos?

‗How are you this morning? (How did you greet the dawn?)‘

4) General greeting
A general greeting that may be used at any time of the day (whether it is your first encounter with the person or not) is the following:

¿Igi kude? ¿Tegidde?

‗How are (things)?‘ ‗What‘s new?/What‘s happening?‘

5) Greeting from a passerby
When you are walking through the village, it is customary to call out to the houses you pass using such greetings as the following:

¿Pemalde? ¿Pukwamal? ¿Pemaldega?

‗(How are) you (all)?‘ ‗Are you there?‘ ‗(How is it) with you (all)?‘

132

Conversation Continuance

6) Greeting to a passerby
People in a house often call to a passerby in greetings using such expressions as the following:

¿Pia ne?

‗Where are you going?‘

¿Pia ti?

‗Where have you been?‘

A person returning from his field, or from fishing/hunting may be greeted with the following:

¿Kep tani?

‗Are you just now (for the first time) getting back?‘

11.4.1.4 Greeting exchanges used as a traveller returns from a trip
The greeting exchange with a person just returning from a trip varies according to whether the traveller is greeting the villager, the villager is greeting the traveller, or the traveller is already at home and receiving callers.

Examples

Traveller greets a villager:

1. Traveller:

¿Pemal pukwade?

2. Villager:

Pukwamala.

Villager greets a traveller:

3. Villager:

¿Tani?

4. Traveller:

Eye.

Traveller at home receiving callers:

5. Caller:

¿Noni?

6. Traveller:

Eye.

‗You who are here, how are you?‘ ‗We are here, and we are fine.‘
‗You‘ve come?‘ ‗Yes.‘
‗You‘ve arrived?‘ ‗Yes.‘

11.4.2 Establishment of topic (Ex. 4)
The topic of a conversation must be established. It is usually established by a question as discussed in Section 4.4.3.2. If the topic of the conversation is not implicit in the situation, the person who begins the conversation must clearly set the topic or other people involved in the conversation will not know what is being discussed. A topic-establishing question uses a specific intonation pattern, order of sentence, and also the long form of the topic. Such suffixes as -din/-tin, -de/-te may be used to establish a topic, as discussed in Lesson III.D.5.
Exercise 4. Review
Review the use of topic-establishing questions in Section 4.4.3.2 and the use of topic-establishing suffixes -din/-tin and -de/-te in 3.4.5 and Appendix E.

11.4.3 Sustaining the topic
In Kuna, as in most languages, a listener encourages a speaker to keep talking by interjecting appropriate short comments or sounds when the speaker pauses. If such conversation sustainers are not forthcoming, the speaker assumes his listener is bored and he stops talking. It is vital for a language learner to learn to control conversation sustainers. In general, they are short, easy-to-learn expressions, and since the language learner may find he has difficulty adding information to a conversation, he will find the use of one or more of the several categories of conversation sustainers invaluable in keeping people talking.

11.4.3.1 Neutral conversation sustainers
Neutral conversation sustainers have a general, nonspecific meaning. They can be inserted ―correctly‖ almost anywhere in a conversation.

1) Mmmm
Mmmm signals ‗I‘m listening/I‘m registering what you said.‘ By varying the intonation to a sustained, high pitch, the meaning may become more specific, for example, ―Is that so!‖

11.4 Grammar

133

In early stages of language learning, Mmmm is a most useful conversation sustainer. When you don‘t really know what is being said, the neutral form of Mmmm should be used at the place you think is the end of the information unit, for example: ―The man went to town.‖ Mmmm. ―He bought a gun.‖
2) Aaaa
Aaaa means ‗I‘m assimilating the information you are telling me.‘ It may be used when you are being told something, such as the symptoms of a sickness or the news that someone has arrived in town.
3) Ajáj
Ajáj may be used to indicate ‗I‘ve grasped the information and am basically accepting/agreeing with it.‘
4) Napíra
Napíra ‗very well‘, is stronger agreement and is often used at each stage of unfolding plans, proposals, etc.
11.4.3.2 Conversation sustainers which convey strong emotional overtones Conversational sustainers which convey strong emotional overtones are not neutral and show fairly strong sentiment on the part of the listener.
1) Aaiii
Aaiii denotes sympathy towards the person in distress about whom the speaker is talking. The distress is usually that of physical pain or heartbreak.
2) Aajo
Aajo also denotes sympathy, but the distress here is usually loss or damage to physical property or a setback or frustration in plans.
11.4.3.3 Conversation sustainers that convey surprise Astonishment or amazement at what has been said is conveyed by these conversation sustainers.
1) Maa-chi
Maa-chi ‗Wow!‘ (lit.: ―Boy!‖) is a drawn-out expression of the word machi ‗boy‘. It is used to respond to the description of any event or thing of unusual nature, for example, a huge fish, a narrow escape.
2) Chunna
Chunna ‗Really!‘ parallels the English usage fairly closely.
11.4.3.4 Negative conversation sustainer responses Sometimes a conversation sustainer is a negative response.
1) Chuli
Chuli ‗no‘ is used in disagreement and/or denial.
2) Jáj
Jáj is made by a quick contraction of the diaphragm and expresses displeasure or disgust. It is used to show strong disagreement with what is being said.
11.4.3.5 Question words used as conversation sustainers Question words, such as toa ‗Who?‘, ibi ‗What?‘, inkwa ‗When?‘, igi ‗How?‘ , and pia ‗Where?‘ are interjected at various points in the speaker‘s conversation to show interest and to encourage the speaker to go into more detail.

134

Conversation Continuance

11.4.3.6 Confirmation questions used as conversation sustainers
Often a listener will echo a confirmation question back at the speaker. Confirmation questions are a useful sustainer when the speaker is indulging in graphic descriptions. These are discussed in Section 4.4.3.3.

11.4.3.7 Echoing (repeating) used as conversation sustainers
Echoing or repeating the last phrase or an emphasized word or phrase is very common and is used extensively. The listener repeats the emphasized phrase verbatim with a questioning intonation. Observe and copy the intonation of this echo.

11.4.4 Holding the floor
There are times when a speaker has to stop speaking and pause to think, remember, or recollect, but he still wants to continue to speak. As in other languages, Kuna has several words that signal this ―I want to hold the floor‖ expression.

11.4.4.1 General holding-the-floor expressions
1) Iwen
¿Iwen? ‗Who/What was it?‘ is used during a pause in conversation when you need to remember something, but you plan to continue speaking. When you cannot remember who, what, where (iwengin or iwenbal), etc., you just say iwen and that indicates that you plan to continue speaking. If you say, ―Iwen ... iwen ... iwen ...‖, the listener is usually prompted to help you and give you the word or idea you have forgotten.
2) Te
Te ‗then/and‘ is used when you hesitate or get stuck between sentences. A long drawn-out Teee can give you quite a bit of time to collect your thoughts.

11.4.4.2 Limited holding-the-floor expressions
1) Tegine
Tegine ‗and‘ is used to list things or people (see 5.4.2). The use of tegine ‗and‘ indicates that your list is still not complete.
2) Eg
Eg ‗and/in addition to‘ is used in hesitating as you count money (see 7.4.1.3). It can also be used to hold-the-floor, for example, when you say, ―In addition (eg) ...‖

11.4.5 Yielding-the-floor
There are times in the conversation when a change of speaker is permitted. By using a yielding-the-floor expression, the speaker indicates it is now polite for someone else to speak. At other times, an interjection by another speaker is an interruption. As in any other language, Kuna has ways of signalling the accepted times to change speakers.

11.4.5.1 Yielding-the-floor questions
One of the most common signals and one which clearly signals that the floor is now free for another speaker, is the use of a question.

One situation, however, in which a question does not indicate a yielding of the floor is the case of rhetorical questions used for rebuke. The speaker does not want the listener to answer a rhetorical question. This type of question is clearly marked by jaj which is added to the end of the question.

Example Angry father to his son:
¿Pe es chapurbal ebes? ¿Jaj?

‗You left the machete in the jungle, didn‘t you!‘

11.4 Grammar

135

11.4.5.2 Yielding-the-floor expressions

a) Mmmm
Mmmm is said with a long drawn-out sound and a final low pitch which signals that the speaker has now finished what he wants to say and the floor is open.

b) Teobi
Teobi ‗that‘s all (thus only)‘ is used by the speaker at the end of an account of a trip or incident that has happened. The expected response to teobi is Ajáj, Aaaa, or Mmmm.

c) Teob ito
Teob ito ‗thus (it was), you understand‘ is a variation of teobi ‗that‘s all‘. The speaker says, ―This is the way it was‖ to make sure the listener heard and understood his comments. The expected response to teob ito is Ajáj and/or another yielding-the-floor expression.

d) Teje
If the speaker views what he has told you as being selected from a larger corpus (body) of information, he will often close with teje ‗thus far (to there)‘. The expected response would be ajáj, or another yielding-the-floor expression.

e) Ajáj
Ajáj ‗agreement‘ is often used to terminate an answer to a question, as though the speaker was saying, ―That‘s my answer and I agree with it.‖ The expected response is ajáj or another yielding-the-floor expression.

f) Pitogwa
Pitogwa ‗Listen/Heed!‘ is used at the end of a speech or exhortation. The expected response would be yerba ‗good‘ with a final quickly raised pitch which leaves the floor open.

g) Pitomalgo
Pitomalgo ‗let‘s all listen to/heed (this)‘ is also used at the end of a speech, or exhortation. The expected response to this is yerba ‗good‘ with a final quickly raised pitch which leaves the floor open.

h) Pela Pela ‗finished‘ is used to terminate a meeting, discussion, work party, etc. The expected response is ajáj or napíra.

Although there are other more complex endings, they usually contain at least one of the above.

Examples Speaker:
1. Teje unila an chogdo. 2. Egdin bal chummakedbal nikchul. 3. Teob ito. Listener: 4. Ajáj. Mmmm.

‗To here, is all I say.‘ ‗I have nothing further to say.‘ ‗That‘s it/thus it was, you hear/understand.‘
‗Oh! Mmmm. (floor is open for anyone to speak).‘

11.4.6 Waiving the floor
Often a speaker is speaking to a group of people, but one of the people is the real object of his comments or the listeners have a known order of rank which dictates who may take the floor first. If on the speaker‘s yielding-the-floor, the main person spoken to or the status person wishes to leave the floor ―free,‖ he may do so by using the the waiving-the-floor expression.

136

Conversation Continuance

11.4.6.1 Yerba
Yerba ‗good‘ is used to express approval of a formal speech, exhortation, etc., and is usually made by the person of highest status in the group and chorused by the rest of the listeners.

11.4.6.2 Other waiving-the-floor expressions All other waiving-the-floor expressions are based on the long Mmmm.
1) Mmmm
The elongated Mmmm response by the listener is his waiver of the right to the floor.
2) Teobi, mmmm
Teobi, mmmm ‗so that is how it was, oh!‘ is used in response to a teob conclusion. The teobi is said echo fashion.
3) Ajáj, mmmm
Ajáj, mmmm ‗agreement‘ is used with closures other than teob.

11.4.7 Farewell (Ex. 5–14)
When all the topics of the conversation have been handled and it is time for people to take their leave, farewells are said. Generally speaking, the person leaving nods farewell or points a finger in farewell to all people present in order of decreasing social status.

11.4.7.1 General farewell
Nade ‗goodbye‘ may be used on all occasions. It is used regardless of whether this is the last planned contact of the day or not.

11.4.7.2 Farewell with intended return the same day
1) Kujal
Kujal ‗later‘ is used when the person expects to see the person he is leaving again that day.
2) Negwelo
Negwelo ‗I‘m going for a little while‘ implies an immediate return.

11.4.7.3 Farewell with intended return the following day
1) Panmalo/panmal
Panmalo/panmal ‗until tomorrow‘ is used as the last expected farewell of the day.
2) Panzhe
Panzhe ‗that‘ll be all until tomorrow‘ is used as the last farewell of the day when something has been left incomplete because of time, weariness or some other reason. The intention is to continue the activity or conversation the following day.

11.4.7.4 Farewell until sometime in the future
In the case of farewell until some future date, -che/-je/-zhe ‗until‘ is added to the time word which represents the time that is expected to elapse before the next meeting.

Examples Ibabakeje. Yolzhe.

‗Until four days‘ time‘ ‗Until summer.‘

11.4 Grammar

137

11.4.7.5 Intent to leave
Some farewells indicate that the speaker is intending to leave the location of the conversation. These farewells may or may not be followed by farewell terms, kujal, panmal, etc.

Examples Ne. Nebi.

‗I‘m about to go.‘ ‗I want (need) to leave.‘

11.4.7.6 Response to farewells (Ex. 5–14) All farewells are responded to by one of two words: Eye. ‗Yes.‘ or Ajáj. ‗agreement‘.

12 EVENT TIME-COMMUNICATION

12.1 Dialogue
In almost every Kuna conversation, it is important to communicate the time at which events took place. Ways of doing so are illustrated in This dialogue:

The men are in a town meeting discussing when to thatch a house. Pedro speaks:

1. Nabirté. 2. Immis an chowal amidi. 3. Pandin, an aros tigne. 4. Achuldin, an ua makne, nakwal. 5. Ibapaje, anmal nabir neg makel. 6. Teob an chog. Juan speaks:

‗Well then.‘ ‗Today I looked for firewood.‘ ‗Tomorrow, I‘m going to plant rice.‘ ‗The day after tomorrow, I‘m going to spear fish upriver.‘ ‗In three days‘ time we can thatch the house.‘ ‗That‘s what I say.‘

7. Nabirté. 8. Immis an immal amidi. 9. Wis mecha: koe walgwen, tegin chigli
kwagwendo. 10. Pandin, an tagar chwane. 11. Kukpo ampa napi, takcha. 12. Tummigwengus an yegus. 13. Immis kep wisgad. 14. Ibapaje nabir neg makel. 15. Itos. Ajáj. The chief speaks (in summary):

‗Well now.‘ ‗Today I went hunting.‘ ‗I killed something (a little): a deer and a wild turkey.‘
‗Tomorrow, I‘m going to collect wild banana leaves.‘ ‗I still lack two bundles, you see.‘ ‗(This is because) a week ago I got sick.‘ ‗Today I‘m feeling better for the first time.‘ ‗It will be fine to thatch the house in three days‘ time.‘ ‗That‘s all.‘

16. Itosmal. 17. Ibapaje neg makne. All the men speak (in chorus):

‗Listen, all of you.‘ ‗In three days‘ time we‘ll thatch the house.‘

18. Yerba.

‗Fine.‘

12.2 Pronunciation (Ex. 1–3)
The goals of this section are to master the intonation patterns of sentences which contrast with each other. For example, in English a speaker may contrast events on two different days, ―Today I ... Tomorrow I ...‖ using a changed intonation pattern to emphasize the contrast of activities. On the other hand, in Kuna the contrastive suffix -din/-tin is used to contrast clauses, phrases, and words, and a characteristic intonation pattern accompanies these utterances. These characteristic intonation patterns and change of pitch which occur with -din/-tin are drilled in this section.
Exercise 1. Tracking the dialogue
Track the teacher as he says Dialogue 12.1. Be sure to keep within two or three syllables behind him at all times. Repeat this exercise several times.

141

142

Event Time-Communication

Exercise 2. Dramatizing the dialogue
Dramatize Dialogue 12.1, with the student playing the role. The teacher is to check for:
1. correct intonation patterns, 2. correct pronunciation, and 3. correct gestures. Kuna hand gestures are usually made with the wrist muscles relaxed; an English speaker, in contrast, has his wrist muscles tensed when he makes hand gestures.
Exercise 3. Drill of problem areas
Drill the problem sounds, sentences and gestures encountered in Exercise 2.
12.3 CULTURE
The Kuna culture has a highly developed democratic system. Any adult man or woman has the right to speak at length on any subject in a town meeting. The protocol of town meetings is quite rigid and it is helpful for the outsider to be aware of certain rules which Kunas observe in their meetings.
The order in which people speak is strictly adhered to. The order is: village leaders in order of status, older men (tadgana), younger men (machimala), male outsiders, older women, younger women, female outsiders.
Before the meeting, you are expected to advise the chief, who calls the meeting, of any subject you wish to have discussed. At that time, you must also discuss any questions the chief might have concerning the subject you wish discussed.
Normally, the chief will call on you, the outsider, to speak when your item on the agenda is reached. Once you have presented your case, it is not polite to interrupt another speaker who is speaking to your subject. If you feel you need to answer a certain objection or correct a misunderstanding, you may ask the chief for permission to speak again before further discussion takes place.
At the close of the discussion, the chief will announce to you the official acceptance or rejection of your proposal/request. It is not proper for you, as an outsider, to speak on any subject which does not directly involve you or the people you represent. Visiting Kunas from outside the community have the same rule imposed upon them.
If you wish to be excused from a meeting which you are expected to attend, you must inform the chief or the chowal ibed deputy. He is the person who officially notified you of the time and place of the meeting.
12.4 Grammar
12.4.1 Time-setting Establishing the time or setting of an event is very important. Temporal expressions may relate an event to the time the speaker is speaking. Such expressions serve the same purpose as the English time words ―yesterday‖ or ―tomorrow.‖ They may also relate the time of an event to another event. English examples of this type of construction include the first clause, i.e., subordinate sentence, of a sentence which begins, ‗When...‘, for example, ―When Judy came, Mary set the table.‖ Another example is, ―When the sun shines, I will go swimming.‖ Time expressions (word/phrase/subordinate sentence) usually53 occur at the beginning of the sentence in Kuna.
12.4.1.1 Relating the event to the present (Ex. 4–11) In this section, we deal with relating the time an event takes place with the present, the time that the speaker is speaking, i.e., whether the time reference is past, present, or future.
53 Time expressions occasionally occur after the subject or at the end of the sentence, as discussed in 12.4.1.a.3, both in b) and c).

12.4 Grammar

143

1) Past time reference
When the event to which the speaker is referring happened before the time of his speech, it has a past time reference. The past time reference can be expressed by the use of (simple) adverbs of time, or by the formation of complex time words. In independent simple sentences, the completive suffix -cha/-zha/-s/-ja usually occurs on verbs with a past time reference.

a) Use of (simple) adverbs of time
In Kuna, adverbs of time can be used to express time periods from the immediate past, immis-immis ‗just now‘ to asto ‗the day before yesterday‘; or they can be used to express more general past, times such as mutik ‗at night‘.

Examples 1. Immis-immis an chunkal chikcha. 2. Sae an mol makcha. 3. Asto an ua chwanad.

‗Just now I cut my hand.‘ ‗Yesterday I sewed a blouse.‘ ‗The day before yesterday I went fishing.‘

b) Forming complex time words
Specific concepts that are further into the past than ―the day before yesterday‖ are formed by attaching an adverb of time (iba ‗day‘, tummi ‗week‘, ni ‗month‘, pirka ‗year‘) to a number suffix and the suffix -gus/-kus:54 adverb of time + number suffix + -gus/-kus.

Examples 1. iba day 2. pirka year

+ pá three + gwen one

+ -gus = ibapagus + -gus = pirkagwengus

‗three days ago‘ ‗one year ago‘

Exercise 4. Time setting in the past frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several tines.

Example Teacher: Sae an karpa chobzha.

Student: Sae an karpa chobzha.

1. Sae an karpa chobzha. 2. Sae an noni.55

‗Yesterday, I made a basket.‘ ‗Yesterday, I arrived.‘

3. Sae an koe mecha.

‗Yesterday, I killed a deer.‘

4. Asto an karpa chobzha.

‗Day before yesterday, I made a basket.‘

5. Asto an noni.

‗Day before yesterday, I arrived.‘

6. Asto an koe mecha.

‗Day before yesterday, I killed a deer.‘

7. Wakur an karpa chobzha.

‗In the morning, I made a basket.‘

8. Wakur an noni.

‗In the morning, I arrived.‘

9. Wakur an koe mecha.

‗In the morning, I killed a deer.‘

10. Mutik an kabis.

‗At night, I slept.‘

Exercise 5. Complex past time word frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

54 -gus follows lenis consonants and vowels, -kus follows fortis consonants (see 7.4.1.4.). 55 noni ‗arrived‘ includes inherently the completive aspect.

144

Event Time-Communication

Example Teacher: Ibapagus an karpa chobzha.

Student: Ibapagus an karpa chobzha.

1. Ibapagus an karpa chobzha.

‗Three days ago, I made a basket.‘

2. Ibabakegus an karpa chobzha.

‗Four days ago, I made a basket.‘

3. Ibaatalgus an karpa chobzha.

10. Pirkabogus an karpa chobzha.

‗Two years ago, I made a basket.‘

Exercise 6. Time setting in the past, stimulus-response drill
The teacher asks the question and the student replies. The teacher repeats the question and the student replies with an earlier setting. This drill may be repeated using other questions listed below.

Examples Teacher: ¿Inkwa noni?

Student: Immis. ‗today‘

Teacher: ¿Inkwa noni?

Student: Sae.

‗yesterday‘

Teacher: ¿Inkwa noni?

Student: Asto.

‗day before yesterday‘

Teacher: ¿Inkwa noni?

Student: Ibapagus. ‗three days ago‘

The teacher should tell the student when to change from iba ‗day‘ to tummi ‗week‘ or to ni ‗month‘ or pirka ‗year‘.

1. ¿Inkwa noni? 2. ¿Inkwa nade? 3. ¿Inkwa chobzha?

‗When did (you) arrive?‘ ‗When did (you) leave (here)?‘ ‗When did (you) make (it)?‘

2) Future time reference
When the event to which the speaker is referring will take place after the time of his speech, it has a future time reference. The future time reference may be expressed by the use of adverbs of time, or by the formation of complex future time words.

a) Use of adverbs of time In Kuna, temporal adverbs are used to express time in the immediate future, immis-immis ‗just now‘56 kujal ‗later‘, and as far into the future as achul ‗day after tomorrow‘ or they may be used to express more general future times such as ibegwenche ‗until some day‘.

Examples 1. Kujal an mas kunne. 2. Pan an mol makne. 3. Achul machi ua chwane.

‗Later, I am going to eat.‘ ‗Tomorrow, I am going to sew a blouse.‘ ‗The day after tomorrow the boy is going to go fishing.‘

56 The word immis-immis ‗just now‘ may refer to either past or future events, depending upon the form of the verb.

12.4 Grammar

145

b) Forming complex future time words
Time concepts that are further in the future than ―the day after tomorrow‖ may be expressed by attaching an adverb of time (iba ‗day‘, tummi ‗week‘, ni ‗month‘, or pirka ‗year‘), a number suffix and the suffix -che/-zhe/-je:57 adverb of time + number suffix + -che/-zhe/-je:

Examples 1. iba day 2. tummi week 3. pirka year

+ nerkwa six + pabak eight + atal five

+ -je = ibanerkwaje + -che = tummipabakche + -zhe = pirkaatalzhe

‗in six days‘ ‗in eight weeks‘ ‗in five years‘

Exercise 7. Time setting in future frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Exercise 8. Time setting in the future stimulus-response drill
The teacher asks the question and the student replies. The teacher repeats the question and the student replies with a later setting. This drill may be repeated using other questions listed below.

Examples Teacher: ¿Inkwa ne?

Student: Ampayo. ‗Not yet.‘

Teacher: ¿Inkwa ne?

Student: Pan.

Teacher: ¿Inkwa ne?

Student: Achul. ‗Day after tomorrow.‘

Teacher: ¿Inkwa ne?

Student: Ibapaje. ‗In three days‘ time.‘

The teacher should tell the student when to change from iba ‗day‘, to tummi ‗week‘, or to ni ‗month‘, or pirka

‗year‘.

1. ¿Inkwa ne? 2. ¿Inkwa immal amine? 3. ¿Inkwa ul chomne?

3) Position of time expressions in a sentence
Time expressions (word/phrase/clause) usually occur at the beginning of a sentence. They may, however, occur after the subject of the sentence or at the end of the sentence.

Examples 1. Mutik an ne. 2. Antin mutik ne. 3. An ne, mutik.

‗Tonight, I am going to go.‘ ‗I am going to go tonight.‘ ‗I am going to go -- tonight!‘

a) Time expressions at the beginning of a sentence
As discussed in Section 12.4, a time expression most commonly occurs at the beginning of a sentence. This sentence initial position is indicated in certain situations.

Setting
When you wish to orient your listener as to ―when‖ an event took place or will take place, the time expression occurs at the beginning of the sentence.

Example Sae an karpa chobzha.

‗Yesterday I made a basket.‘

Connectives
If you choose to organize your story chronologically, thus, developing the story around the time certain events happened/will happen, time expressions become the ―glue‖ that holds the story together. The time expression is the connective which joins one thought or sentence to the former one. If the time expression is a connective, it occurs at the beginning of the sentence.

Example Martesgin59 anmal noni. Pangin anmal immal aminade.

‗Tuesday we arrived. The next day we went hunting (animals).‘

58 b becomes m before n, for example: chob + -ne = chomne ‗going to make‘. 59 Days of the week are Spanish loan words. Tummi ‗Sunday‘ is a Kuna term whose primary meaning is ‗week‘.

Answers to questions
Time expressions used to answer time-related questions such as: ¿Inkwa? ‗When?‘ occur at the beginning of the sentence.

Examples 1. ¿Inkwa pe ne? 2. Pan an ne.

‗When are you going?‘ ‗I am going tomorrow.‘

Topic When the time expression is the topic of the conversation, it occurs at the beginning of the sentence.

Examples 1. Pan an ne.
2. Ai yegualil an ina che.

‗Tomorrow I am going (referring to what the person plans to do tomorrow).‘
‗When a friend becomes sick, I give him his medicine.‘

Contrast of time of distinct events
Occasionally, a situation arises in that an event that happened (will happen) in one time period is contrasted with what happened (will happen) in another time period. When the time of distinct events are contrasted, the time expressions occur at the beginning of the two sentences describing the events.

Example
Pandin an aros tigne. Achuldin an ua makne.

‗Tomorrow, I‘m going to plant rice. The day after tomorrow (on the other hand), I‘m going to spear fish.‘

b) Time expressions used after the subject
If a time expression is used as an adverb to limit the scope of the action by stating when it took place (or will take place), the time expression occurs after the subject of the sentence. This parallels the time expression occurring after the verb in English, ―I will go at 3 o‘clock.‖

Example Antin pan ne.

‗I am going tomorrow.‘

If there is more than one adverbial expression occurring after the subject, the time expression occurs immediately following the subject. This word order is different from English word order.

Example Antin pan negzhe ne.

‗I am going home tomorrow.‘

Exercise 10. Time frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: An pan negzhe ne. Student: An pan negzhe ne.
1. An pan negzhe ne. 2. An sae akan pakcha. 3. Sagla immis noni. 4. An achul ob tigne. 5. Machi asto kueye- kueye koe mecha.

‗I am going home tomorrow.‘ ‗I bought an axe yesterday.‘ ‗The chief arrived today/just now.‘ ‗I am going to plant corn day after tomorrow.‘ ‗The boy quickly killed the deer the day before yesterday.‘

Exercise 11. Time expression substitution drill
The teacher says the frame and selects a time expression. The student then inserts the time expression in the correct form of the frame.

c) Time expressions at the end of a sentence
Occasionally a time expression occurs at the end of a sentence in the postpredicate position (see 17.4) The time expression in this position is being emphasized by the speaker.

Example Machi nakwal ua makne, pane.

‗The boy is going to spear fish upriver tomorrow.‘

12.4.1.2 Relating an event to another event (Ex. 12–26)
As indicated (see 7.4.1.4), the time of an event may be referred to by an exact time, for example, wachilbo ‗two o‘clock‘. It may also be referred to by using an adverb of time, sae ‗yesterday‘, or a complex time word ibabakegus ‗four days ago‘ (see 7.4.1.4). Another way of referring to the time of an event (Event A) is by referring to the time of another event (Event B), that is known to the listener. That other event (Event B), may be referred to by use of a time-reference suffix or time conjunction, or by means of prior condition suffixes.

1) Time-reference suffix
The time-reference suffix is used to relate the time of one event which happened in the past to the time of another.
For instance, the listener knows the time at which Event B took place. He does not know the time at which Event A occurred. By telling the listener that, ―at the same time as Event B took place, Event A also took place,‖ the speaker may establish the time of Event A. Relating the times of past events parallels the English construction, ―at the time that/when....‖
The speaker may refer to the time of Event A either by adding the time-reference suffix -un to the verb of Event B; by use of the time-reference conjunction teun ‗at the time that all that happened‘, which refers to the series of actions that together comprise Event B (see 7.4.1.1) by the use of the time-reference suffix -tu/-du ‗before‘; or by use of a time-reference conjunction cholbal ‗after‘ or iktual ‗before‘.

a) Time-reference suffix -un ‗at the time when‘
The speaker may refer to Event B with a short phrase such as, ‗the house burned‘, and then add the suffix -un60 to the verb in order to say, ‗at the time when the house burned‘.

Examples 1. An neg kummajun61 an mani pega ukcha. 2. An mol makchaun tub kinnid periangus.

‗At the time that I burned my fields, I gave you the money.‘
‗At the time that she was sewing a blouse, she lost her thread.‘

60 The time-reference suffix -un is followed by a pause before the utterance is continued. Because the pause is intrinsic in
the suffix -un punctuation by a comma is not necessary. 61 The completed aspect -s becomes -j before the suffix -un.

12.4 Grammar

149

Exercise 12. Time-reference suffix frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, and on through the following sentences through Sentence 5. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: An neg kummajun machi anka chogzha.

Student: An neg kummajun machi anka chogzha.

1. An neg kummajun machi anka chogzha. ‗At the time that I burned the field, the boy told me.‘

2. An nugal unkenaiun machi anka chogzha. ‗At the time that I pulled teeth, the boy told me.‘

3. An mas kuchaun machi anka chogzha.

‗At the time that I ate, the boy told me.‘

4. An karpa chobzhaun machi anka chogzha. ‗At the time that I made the basket, the boy told me.‘

5. An maiun machi anka chogzha.

‗At the time that I was (at home), the boy told me.‘

Exercise 13. Time-reference suffix drill
The teacher says the sentence. The student changes the sentence by adding the time-reference suffix -un to the verb and adding, An nad. ‗I went.‘ This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Machi mas kucha.

Student: Machi mas kuchaun an nad.

1. Machi mas kucha.

‗The boy ate the food.‘

2. Ome mol makcha.

‗The woman sewed the blouse.‘

3. Machi tulub pakcha.

‗The boy bought the lobster.‘

4. Machi ul chobzha.

‗The boy made the canoe.‘

5. Wag kallin pakcha.

‗The outsider bought the chicken.‘

Exercise 14. Time-reference suffix drill
Repeat Exercise 14 with the student providing an appropriate main clause, that is instead of the An nad. ‗I went.‘ suggested in the above exercise.

b) Time-reference conjunction teun ‗at the time when that was happening‘
The times of contemporary events may be related by the use of the time-reference conjunction teun ‗at the time all that happened‘. Teun is a compound word comprised of the back reference te ‗all of that‘ and -un ‗at the time that‘. Teun basically sums up all the isolated incidents of Event B. That is to say, often the speaker wants to give several pieces of information about Event B in a series of sentences. The speaker may then summarize all the events relating to Event B with the back reference te ‗all of that‘ and add the suffix -un to form the time-reference conjunction teun ‗at the time all that was happening‘.

Example

Teun an chule takcha.

‗At the time when all that was happening, I saw a paca.‘

The following examples will help clarify the use of teun.

Examples

The man saw a paca at the time when he was planting rice. The speaker could summarize Event B by, ‗I was planting rice‘,

1a. An aros tignaiun an chule takcha.

‗At the time when I was planting rice, I saw a paca.‘

Or the speaker could give several parts to Event B and then summarize them by using the time-reference conjunction teun.

b. An aros ya chenai.

‗I was making holes for the rice.‘

c. Nuskandin aka todonai. d. An omedin62 aros tignai.

‗The children were playing around.‘ ‗My wife was planting the rice.‘

62 For a discussion of an as a possessive pronoun, see Lesson 13.4.2.1.

Exercise 15. Paragraph intonation drill
The teacher reads Examples 1b-e, 2b-e, 3b-e, 4b-f, and 5b-g above. The student must pay special attention to the intonation patterns of the paragraphs.

12.4 Grammar

151

c) Time-reference suffix -du/-tu ‗before‘ and cholbal ‗after‘
The time one event happened/will happen may be established by saying that it happened before/after some other known event. This is achieved by adding the suffix -tu/-du ‗before‘ to the verb or by adding the word cholbal ‗after‘ following the verb. This construction functions in the same way as -un ‗at the time that‘ (see 12.4.1.2.1-a).

Examples 1. An yo mas kunneddu, sagla noni. 2. An mas kunchad cholbal, sagla noni.

‗I had not yet eaten (when/before) the chief arrived.‘ ‗After I had eaten, the chief arrived.‘

If the two events differ only as to who is involved, but the actions are the same, then reference is made by adding -du/-tu ‗before‘ or cholbal ‗after‘ to the people doing the action.

Examples 1. An pedu ne. 2. An pe cholbal ne.

‗I‘m going to go on ahead of you.‘ ‗I‘m going to go after you.‘

Exercise 16. Time-reference conjunction drill
The teacher reads the following questions to the student and the student replies to the questions by using ―b‖ part of the situational examples with the time-reference conjunction teun (see 12.4.1.2.1b).

Example Teacher: ¿Chulede, inkwa pe takcha?

‗When did you see the paca?‘

Student: An aros ya chenai.

‗I was making holes for the rice.‘

Student: Nuskandin aka todonai. ‗The children were playing around.‘

Student: An omedin aros tignai. ‗My wife was planting the rice.‘

Student: Teun an chule takcha. ‗At the time when all that was going on, I saw the paca.‘

1. ¿Chulede, inkwa pe takcha? 2. ¿Tubde, inkwa pe perianzhas?63

‗When did you see the paca?‘ ‗When did you lose the thread?‘

3. ¿Yabede, inkwa pe perianzhas?

‗When did you lose the key?‘

4. ¿Ulde, inkwa wag aturchas?

‗When did the outsider steal the canoe?‘

5. ¿Apade, inkwa pe takcha?

‗When did you see the boa?‘

d) Time-reference conjunctions cholbal ‗after‘ and iktual ‗before‘
There are two other time-reference conjunctions which occur frequently. Their function is basically the same as that of teun. They refer, however, to a period of time either preceding or subsequent to the main event.

Examples 1. Te iktual, an mol pakcha. 2. Te cholbal, María negzhe nad.

‗Before all that happened, I bought a blouse.‘ ‗After all that happened, Mary went home.‘

2) Prior conditions
The concept of a prior condition is widely used in Kuna. The time that an event (Event A) took place/will take place is established by relating it to the time of another event (Event B). In this case, the agent of Event A cannot, or has chosen not to act, until the prior condition of Event B has taken place. This parallels the English construction, ―When the taxi comes, Paul will leave.‖ (In other words, Paul, the agent in Event A, will not, or has chosen not to go, until Event B, the taxi‘s arrival, takes place.)
Kunas are very sensitive as to the sense in which Event B is a prior condition for Event A. They make a distinction between conditions that the speaker imposes which would otherwise not affect the performance

63 Note the distinction between periangus ‗(become) lost‘ and perianchus ‗lost (misplaced)‘.

152

Event Time-Communication

of Event A in the least (―independent prior conditions‖), and those that in some sense are vitally tied to the performance of Event A (―dependent prior conditions‖).
The difference between these two types of prior conditions is very subtle, and we will attempt to explain the difference by contrasting examples. In its simplest form, it is the difference between saying, ―When the taxi comes, Paul will leave the house (e.g., on foot).‖ and ―When the taxi comes, Paul will leave the house (in it).‖
In Sentence 1, Paul could as easily have picked some other time to leave the house, e.g., ―At 3:45 p.m., Paul will leave.‖ (Paul‘s leaving is independent of the taxi coming, but Paul has chosen to wait until the taxi comes before leaving.)
In Sentence 2, however, Paul cannot possibly leave in the taxi until the taxi is there. (Paul‘s leaving is dependent on the taxi‘s coming because, for some reason, Paul cannot go by any other means.)
Now consider some more subtle examples:
Examples 1. ―When I arrived home, I ate some food.‖ The above condition can be considered in two ways:

Independent prior condition: ―I was carrying some food with me, but I arbitrarily decided not to eat it until I arrived home.‖
Dependent prior condition: ―My arriving home was a necessary precondition to my eating the food (e.g., that is where the food was).‖ 2. ―When you go to eat, I will read my book.‖ The above condition can be considered in two ways:

Independent prior condition: ―I will arbitrarily set the time when I start reading as the time you go to eat. I could as easily have said, ‗In twenty minutes, I will read my book.‘‖
Dependent prior condition: ―You came here to talk to me, so it would be inappropriate/rude/absurd to read my book just now. I‘ll wait until you go to eat before I read my book.‖ 3. ―When you are ready to sleep, take this medicine.‖ The above condition can be considered in two ways:

Independent prior condition: ―I am thinking of the time you are going to sleep as a convenient time to take the medicine.‖ Or you could say, ―There is no special time in which you need to take this medicine, but when you go to sleep would be as good a time as any.‖
Dependent prior condition: ―In some sense, it is important to the taking of this medicine that you be ready to go to sleep (e.g., maybe it is a sleeping pill and would not help you at another time of day).‖
Kunas use different suffixes to express the subtle difference between dependent prior conditions and independent prior conditions, so it is important that you are aware of this difference.

a) Independent prior condition
In the independent prior condition construction, Event A could normally take place at any time, for it really has no logical connection at all with Event B. Event A is independent of the performance of Event B. However, the speaker chooses to define the time at which Event A happened or will happen, by relating it to the performance of Event B. When the condition for Event B to take place is viewed as being independent of the performance of Event A, the suffix -dgin is added to the Event B verb.

Examples 1. An kukaledgin kukunaidgin ‗When I (will) am flying in the plane,

mas kunne. I am going to eat.‘

← → Event B

← → Event A

12.4 Grammar

153

In the example above, we are to understand that, theoretically, ―I‖ could have eaten at any time. However, ―I‖ have chosen to eat at the specific time that ―I‖ am in the plane.

2. Mas kunnoedgin ‗When you eat your food,

iti ina kobo. take that medicine.‘

← → Event B

← → Event A

From the example above, we are to understand that the particular medicine is the kind that may be taken at any time, however, mealtime is as good a time as any to take it.

The independent prior condition may be used to refer to past or future situations. Although a verb tense-aspect suffix may be used in both Event A and Event B clauses, the time frame (future or past) of Event B is signalled by Event B.

Event A immediate future aspect/completive aspect verb) occurring with Event B (completive aspect/positional verb)
When the Event A verb is either immediate future aspect or completed aspect, the Event B verb may be a completive aspect ( -cha/-zha/-ja) or one of the positional (chi, mai, nai, kwichi, un) verbs. The aspect of the Event A verb indicates whether the Event B verb is to be interpreted in the future or in the past.

Examples

1. An mas kuchadgin, an machi takne.

‗When I will have (finished) eaten, I‘m going to see the boy.‘

2. An mas kuchadgin, an machi takcha.

‗When I had (finished) eating I saw the boy.‘

In the examples above, both Event B verbs are completive aspect. Because, in Example 1 the Event A verb

is immediate future aspect (―I‘m going to see‖), a listener knows that the Event B should be interpreted in

the future sense of a completive aspect verb, i.e., ―When I (will) have finished eating, I‘m going to see the boy.‖

In Example 2. the Event A verb is (past) completive aspect. The listener knows that the Event B verb is to be interpreted in a past framework, i.e., ―When I (had) finished eating, I saw the boy.‖

The interpretation of the past or future significance of positional Event B verbs is also signalled by the aspect of the Event A verb.

Examples

1a. An mas kunaidgin, an machi takne.

‗When I (will be) am (actively involved in) eating, I am going to see the boy.‘

b. An mas kunaidgin, an machi takcha.

‗When I was (actively involved in) eating, I saw the boy.‘

2a. María mas kunchidgin, Luis machi takne. ‗When Mary is (will be) eating, Louis is going to see the boy.‘

b. María mas kunchidgin, Luis machi takcha. ‗When Mary was (sitting) eating, Louis saw the boy.‘

3a. José kachigin kammaidgin, an machi takne. ‗When Joseph is (will be) sleeping in the hammock, I am going to see the boy.‘

b. José kachigin kammaidgin, an machi takcha.

‗When Joseph was sleeping in the hammock, I saw the boy.‘

4a. Anmal mas kumpukwadgin, machi noniko. ‗When we (will be) are eating, the boy will arrive.‘

b. Anmal mas kumpukwadgin, machi noni. ‗When we were (sitting) eating, the boy arrived.‘

5a. Anmal mas kunchadgin, an ne.

‗When we (will) have eaten, I am going to go.‘

b. Anmal mas kuchadgin, an nade.

‗When we had eaten, I went.‘

Event A (immediate future aspect) occurring with Event B (immediate future aspect)

If Event A will take place when the Event B activity is imminent, the immediate future aspect suffix -ne is used in both Event A and Event B clauses.

154

Event Time-Communication

Examples

1. An nan taknedgin, Pedro cho chikne.

‗When I am going to go and see my mother, Peter is going to go cut firewood.‘

2. Marla mas tunedgin, an omne.

‗When Mary is going to cook, I am going to bathe.‘

Event A (future aspect) occurring with Event B (future aspect)

If Event A will take place at some unspecified time (―sometime‖) in the future when the Event B activity will take place, both events use the future aspect verb suffix -o/-oe. The independent prior condition suffix -dgin is added to the long form of the future aspect suffix -oe.

Examples

1. Mas kunnoedgin, iti ina kobo.

‗(Sometime later) when he is (will be) eating, (he) will take the medicine.‘

2. An ol pakoedgin, an mol tako.

‗(Sometime later) when I will buy a nose ring, I will look at cloth.‘

Event A (habitual/completive aspect verb) occurring with Event B (gerundive verb form)

Habitual activity in Event A is usually indicated by the gerundive form (see XVIII.D.3) of the Event A verb. Occasionally, however, the completed aspect suffix in the Event A clause occurs with the gerundive form of the Event B verb.

Examples 1. An immal amiedgin, an koe tak. 2. Cho chikedgin, Pablo machi takcha.

‗On hunting animals, deer are seen.‘ ‗On cutting wood, Paul saw a boy.‘

Exercise 17. Independent prior condition frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Mas kunchidgin an machiga chogzha.

Student: Mas kunchidgin an machiga chogzha.

1. Mas kunchidgin an machiga chogzha.

‗While (I was) eating (some) food, I told the boy.‘

2. An kukualedgin kukunaidgin an mas kunne. ‗While I am (will be) flying in the airplane, I‘m going

to eat (some) food.‘

3. Mas eminaidgin an chikles.

‗While (I was) weeding the plantain (palms), I cut (myself).‘

4. Sagla chogchadgin an nad.

‗When the chief had spoken, I left.‘

5. Mol pakchadgin an nad.

‗When I had bought the mola, I left.‘

6. Mas kunnedgin an nad.

‗When (he) went to eat, I left.‘

Exercise 18. Independent prior condition drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student changes the sentence to a subordinate sentence with -dgin and adds the independent sentence An ne. ‗I‘m going to go.‘ This exercise should be repeated substituting An nad. ‗I went.‘ for An ne. ‗I‘m going to go.‘

b) Dependent prior condition On occasion, the performance of Event A is dependent on Event B happening for its fulfillment.
Examples 1. ―When the taxi comes, Paul will leave (in it).‖ 2. ―When I have finished the mola, I will sell it to you.‖ In Example 1, for some reason, it is essential that Paul leave in the taxi. Because he must leave in the taxi, he cannot leave until the taxi arrives. That is to say, Paul‘s leaving (Event A) is dependent on the arrival of the taxi (Event B) for it to be able to happen.

12.4 Grammar

155

In Example 2, presumably, it is necessary to finish the mola before you can sell it. Hence the fulfillment of Event A is dependent on the completion of Event B.

Kunas not only distinguish between independent and dependent prior conditions, they also use different suffixes for past or future dependent conditions.

Future dependent prior condition
When the future Event A is dependent on Event B for its fulfillment, the future dependent prior condition suffix -l is added to the Event B verb. The Event B verb uses the completive aspect or immediate future aspect form. The completive suffix -s becomes -ja before the future dependent prior condition suffix -l. The Event A verb uses the immediate future aspect or future aspect form of the verb or the command form (see 15.4.1).

1. Kukualed tanikil ‗When the plane comes,

an ne. I‘m going (in it).‘

← → Event B

← → Event A

From the above example, we are to understand that ―I‖ for some reason must go in the plane. Therefore it is necessary that the plane come (Event B) before I may leave (Event A). That is to say, ―my‖ leaving is dependent on the arrival of the plane.

2. Pe igal emijal ‗When you have cleared the trail,

an ne. I will go.‘

← → Event B

← → Event A

From the above example, we are to understand that for some reason (possibly the trail at the moment is so overgrown that travel is impossible), the trail must be cleared (Event B) before ―I‖ may travel (Event A). That is to say, ―my‖ leaving (Event A) is dependent on the clearing of the trail (Event B).

Exercise 19. Future dependent prior condition frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc.

Example Teacher: Pe kamnel ina pel kobo.

Student: Pe kamnel ina pel kobo.

1. Pe kamnel ina pel kobo.

‗When you are going to go to sleep, drink all of the medicine.‘

2. Pe mas kunnel an karta apchone. ‗When you are going to eat (food), I‘m going to read a book.‘

3. Pe mas kuchal an karta apchone. ‗When you have eaten (food), I‘m going to read a book.‘

4. Kukualed tanikil an ne.

‗When the airplane comes, I‘m going to go.‘

5. Pe immal aminel an nemo.

‗When you go hunting, I‘m going to go too.‘

Exercise 20. Future dependent prior condition frame drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student changes it into a sentence which contains a future dependent prior conditional clause and adds the main clause an ne ‗I‘m going to go‘. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Pe mas kucha.

Student: Pe mas kuchal an ne.

1. Pe mas kucha.

‗You ate food.‘

2. Pe mol makne.

‗You are going to sew a blouse.‘

3. Pe ua tune.

‗You are going to cook fish.‘

4. Pe ul chobzha.

‗You made the canoe.‘

5. Wag kallin pakcha.

‗The outsider bought the chicken.‘

Event Time-Communication

Exercise 21. Future dependent prior condition spontaneous frame drill.
Repeat Exercise 21, but use an independent sentence other than an ne ‗I‘m going to go‘.

Exercise 22. Completive aspect -s to -ja drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student changes it into a sentence with a future dependent prior conditional clause adding a main clause an ne ‗I‘m going to go‘.

Example Teacher: Pe ua tus.

Student: Pe ua tujal an ne.

1. Pe ua tus.

‗You cooked the fish.‘

2. Ti nos.

‗The river rose.‘

3. Yannu nas.

‗The peccaries passed by.‘

4. Pe ob chus.

‗You fetched the corn.‘

5. Pe mol ches.

‗You took the blouse.‘

Past dependent prior condition

When the past Event A was dependent on Event B for its fulfillment, the past dependent prior condition suffix -gu/-ku is added to the Event B verb. -gu is used following lenis consonants and vowels, and -ku is used following fortis consonants. The completive suffix (-cha/-zha/-ja/-s) may precede -gu/-ku. Event A verb uses the completive aspect form.

Examples 1. An negzhe nonigu ‗When I arrived home,

an mas kucha. I ate some food.‘

← → Event B

← → Event A

From the above example, we are to understand that for some reason, ―I‖ did not eat until I got home (possibly ―I‖ had no food on the trip). That is to say, ―my‖ eating (Event A) was dependent on my arrival home (Event B).

2. An kinki elisgu ‗When I had cleaned the gun,

an immal aminad. I went hunting.‘

← → Event B

← → Event A

From the above example, we are to understand that for some reason (possibly the gun cannot shoot anymore until it is cleaned), ―I‖ cannot go hunting until the gun is cleaned. That is to say, ―my‖ going hunting (Event A) is dependent on ―my‖ cleaning the gun (Event B).

Exercise 23. Past dependent prior condition frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc.

Examples Teacher: An mas kuchagu an nadbal.

Student: An mas kuchagu an nadbal.

1. An mas kuchagu an nadbal.

‗Having eaten the food, I left.‘

2. An mol makchagu an wagga ukcha.

‗Having sewed the blouse, I sold (it) to the outsider.‘

3. An mas tusgu an machiga ukcha.

13 COMMUNICATING COMMUNITY TOGETHERNESS

13.1 Dialogue
An important feature of Kuna culture is that of working together as a community. The following dialogue (primarily a monologue) by the chief is an explanation of a workday.

Chief (showing a visitor how Kunas work together as a community):

1. Immis, Pay tolganmal pel pistagin arpanani.
2. Machergandin pista eminani; esgin.

3. Omegandin turwa minani; chowalgin.

4. 5.
6.
7. 8. Visitor:

Machimaldin ya enzhenani e palagin. Machimal pimaladdin tikalbal ya akinani; ti ariogal. Punamaldin neggin pukua; purwigan takpukmal. Teob, anmal pel puge-puge arpanani. Teob, igal nued, takcha.

‗Today, all Payaites (those who live in Paya) are working on the airstrip.‘ ‗The men are cutting (cleaning) the airstrip with machetes.‘ ‗The women are raking off the cuttings with (long) sticks.‘ ‗The boys are filling holes with their shovels.‘ ‗Other boys are digging a canal on the side for drainage.‘
‗The girls are at home,looking after the little ones.‘
‗That‘s the way we work together.‘ ‗It (this way) is a good custom, (you) see.‘

9. Ajáj. ‗That‘s right!‘

13.2 Pronunciation (Ex. 1–2)
The overall intonation pattern of the chief‘s speech in the above dialogue is important. There are three parts to the speech:
1. Assertion or statement (Sentence 1) 2. Examples or details (Sentences 2–6) 3. Summary or evaluation (Sentences 7–8). This overall pattern of giving information is very common. It is essential that the overall intonation pattern be mastered.
Exercise 1. Tracking drill
Track the teacher as he says Dialogue 13.1. Repeat the exercise until the intonation pattern is mastered.
Exercise 2. Dialogue memorization drill
Memorize Dialogue 13.1, using the correct intonation pattern. The teacher will check the intonation. The student should correct errors by repeating Exercise 1. Any attempt to repeat sentences in isolation will change the intonation pattern and thwart the purpose of these exercises.
13.3 Culture
Community work is an important feature of Kuna culture. Projects such as keeping the town free of weeds and leaves, the trails clear, the river free of debris, and building the school are the work of the entire community. The community also works on certain projects for individuals, such as house building and roof thatching.

159

160

Communicating Community Togetherness

In community projects, each member is expected to contribute as he is able. The bulk of heavy work is carried by the young men. The boys contribute within their limits of experience and endurance. The old men give advice and work within the physical limitations of their age. Since each individual is expected to work to his full capacity, everyone is considered to be fully productive. This attitude towards productivity is important for outsiders to understand. Practically, it means that each worker who is working on a work party for an outsider should receive the same remuneration, whether he is a young man who has done heavy work all day, or an old man who has only given advice and passed an occasional tool to the working men. Because each has worked to his individual capacity, each deserves the same wage. (Small boys, however, are sometimes paid less.)
Sickness or an urgent need to supply the family with food are valid excuses for not being present in a work party. The chief or his designate in charge of a project must be informed of the proposed absence in advance. On the day following his return from a trip, a person is excused from community and family work responsibilities. Visitors to the village are not obligated to help in community work parties, although they may stand on the sidelines and watch the activities. Villagers who have been excused from the work party may go to the location of the work project and chat or watch progress.

13.4 Grammar

13.4.1 Male/female distinction
Although gender is not marked in Kuna, if there is a need to indicate male or female, the word ome ‗woman/female‘ or the word machered ‗man/male‘ precedes the word to be modified. That is, gender is indicated in the form of a possessive construction as in 13.4.2 below. People, animals, birds, fish, reptiles, and certain plants that have separate male and female counterparts may be described in this way.

Examples 1. tule ome 2. kallin machered 3. chigli ome 4. kwarkwad ome

‗woman‘ ‗rooster‘ ‗wild turkey hen‘ ‗female papaya tree‘

13.4.2 Possessives (Ex. 3–5)
The concept of possession in Kuna is expressed by using the name of the possessor or a pronoun which refers to him, with or without a possessive suffix.

13.4.2.1 Pronoun of noun referring to the possessor without possessive suffix
When possession is expressed by the name of the possessor, the possessor or a pronoun without a possessive suffix, the possessed item follows.

Examples 1. An achu neggin mai. 2. Pab achu neggin mai. 3. Pedro achu neggin mai.

‗My dog is at home.‘ ‗Father’s dog is at home.‘ ‗Peter’s dog is at home.‘

Exercise 3. Possessive substitution drill
The teacher says the sentence and selects a word from the list and says it. The student substitutes the selected word in the frame.

Example
Frame 1. an 2. pe

Teacher: An pega an mol ukcha. Teacher: nan Student: An pega nan mol ukcha. An pega ____ mol ukcha. ‗I gave you ____‘s clothes.‘
‗I/my‘ ‗you/your‘

13.4 Grammar

161

3. a 4. nan 5. Pedro 6. e

‗that/one‘s‘ ‗mother/mother‘s‘ ‗Peter/Peter‘s‘ ‗his/her/its/their‘

13.4.2.2 Possessive suffix -gad/-kad in an equative sentence
Possession in an equative sentence is expressed by saying the object possessed, followed by the noun or pronoun that refers to the possessor to which the possessive suffix -gad/-kad is attached.

Examples

1. Achu ankad.

‗The dog is mine.‘

2. Achu pabgad.

‗The dog is father’s.‘

3. Neg kallingad.

‗The house is the chicken’s.‘

If ownership is being emphasized the long form of the suffix is used.

Example Achu Pedrogadi.

‗The dog is Peter‘s.‘

13.4.2.3 Possessive pronoun with a possessive suffix
A possessive phrase paralleling the English construction ―____ of mine/yours/his/its‖ can be formed by stating the object possessed, followed by the noun or pronoun that refers to the possessor to which the possessive suffix -gad/-kad is attached.64

Examples 1. Es ankad neggin mai. 2. An karta Pedrogad takcha.

‗A machete of mine is in the house.‘ ‗I saw the book of Peter’s.‘

13.4.2.4 Possessive questions Questions of possession are formed by adding the possessive suffix -gad/-kad to a question word.

Examples 1. ¿Toagad? 2. ¿Ibigad?

‗Whose (is it)?‘ ‗To what (does it belong?‘

13.4.2.5 Extended use of -gad/-kad -gad/-kad is used in the sense of ‗made of some type of material‘.

Examples 1. chowalgad 2. ezhagad

‗wooden‘ ‗made of iron‘

Exercise 4. -gadi/-kadi drill
The teacher asks the question and the student answers the question, selecting an answer from the list below.

Example Teacher: ¿Achude, toagadi?

Student: Angadi.

Answers

1. an

‗I‘

2. mu

‗older respected lady‘

64 The variation in word order in which the possessive -gad/-kad form precedes the noun indicates that the focus is on the possessive word. For example, Ankad ul cheles. ‗(It was) my canoe that was washed away.‘ but Ul ankad cheles. ‗My canoe was washed away.‘

5. ¿Toagad esmed, itide?

‗Whose pot is this?‘

13.4.3 Concept of pluralization (Ex. 6–18) In Kuna, there is not necessarily anything in a noun or in most verbs which would tell you whether it is singular or plural. Generally speaking, you understand that a noun/verb is singular or plural from the context of the sentence or from the situation.
In the case of nouns, however, there are two suffixes, -gan(a)/-kan(a) and -mal(a), which are added in certain situations to indicate that the speaker is referring to more than one individual.
Positional verbs have a plural form and the suffix -mal(a) may be added to a verb to indicate that ―everyone‖ is included in an action.

13.4.3.1 Inclusion markers
There are two suffixes in Kuna which are used to indicate that various individual nouns are being associated. The suffix -gan(a)/-kan is used for a class of nouns, whereas -mal tends to parallel the English construction ―a group of....‖
1) Status class marker -gan(a)/-kan(a)65
Several individuals who have reached a certain status in life or degree of accomplishment may be classified by the addition of the suffix -gan(a)/-kan(a) to the noun which refers to the status of the individual person. The status class marker -gan/-kan refers almost exclusively to people.66 Only certain words which refer to people may be used with the suffix -gan/-kan. (See the list below.)

65 -gan(a) follows lenis consonants and vowels. -kan(a) follows fortis consonants. 66 See 13.4.3.1–7).

13.4 Grammar

163

The use of -gan/-kan does not parallel the use of the English plural. It is closer to the English construction ―a class of ...‖ because of the manner in which it refers only to a general class of people who have achieved a certain social prestige in Kuna society. The English example of the difference between ―women‖ and ―THE women‖ may help to make the use of -gan/-kan clear. ―Women‖ refers to all women, whereas ―THE women‖ refers to a special class of women who may be singled out for their particular specialty or social status. ―THE women‖ closely parallels the Kuna construction formed by the use of -gan/-kan.

Examples

1. omegan

‗women‘

Omegan are all the women who have reached the stage or class where they are considered ―women‖.

2. tulegan

‗people/Kuna who have a specialty‘

Tulegan is not used to include all Kuna people. It is used only to refer to those who are recognized as

having sufficient knowledge in a field to be considered experts. They are generally accepted as being proficient in one or more areas: medicine, history, culture, music, etc.

People who are literate and write letters on their own account would not be considered ―tulegana.‖ Those who read letters to, or write letters for the town would be considered ―tulegana.‖

An interesting use of the status class marker -gan/-kan is with the word tol ‗inhabitant‘. The word tolgan ‗inhabitants‘ may be added to the name of a town to indicate that these people have the status of being inhabitants of the town.

Example Pay tolgan

‗inhabitants of Paya‘

a) Words that take -gan/-gana

1. tule

‗people/Kunas who have a speciality‘ ‗inhabitants‘ ‗chiefs, important ones‘ ‗elders/forefathers‘ ‗old experienced men/(lit.: old ones)‘ ‗matrons/old respected women‘ ‗men‘ ‗parents (of one particular child)‘ ‗women‘ ‗mothers/parents‘ ‗children‘ ‗little ones (children)‘ ‗grandchildren/descendants‘

b) Words that cannot take -gan/-gana

1. machi69

‗boy/young man/son‘

2. puna**

‗girl/young woman/daughter‘

3. waga

‗outsider‘

67 Memorize these irregular forms of the -kan/-kana constructions (also *). 68 purwi ‗a very small object‘ always uses the suffix -gan/-gana when it refers to children. 69 The forms machigan ‗young man‘ and punagan ‗young woman‘ are no longer in use; however, occasionally the long forms machigana ‗young men‘ and punagana ‗young women‘ are heard at town meetings. They are used to give instructions to those who are at the stage of being youths (e.g., Machigana chogo. ‗Instruct the young men.‘) (also *).

Exercise 6. Status class suffix -gan/-kan frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Tummagan noni. Student: Tummagan noni.
1. Tummagan noni. 2. Tadgan teob chogzha. 3. Nuskan tanimo. 4. Machergan arpane. 5. Omegan neg turwine.

‗The big ones (chiefs) arrived.‘ ‗The elders said this.‘ ‗The children are coming too.‘ ‗The men are going to work.‘ ‗The women are going to sweep the village.‘

Exercise 7. Status class suffix -gan/-kan substitute frame drill
The teacher repeats the frame and selects any word from the list below and says it. The student then substitutes the word in the frame.

Examples Teacher: Tulegan noni.

Teacher: pab

Student: Pabgan noni.

Teacher: Pabgan noni.

Teacher: machered

Student: Machergan noni.

Frame ____ noni.

‗The ____ arrived.‘

1. tule

‗person/Kuna‘

2. tummad

‗the big one (chief)‘

3. tol

‗inhabitant‘

4. tad

‗grandfather‘

2) Group marker -mal(a)
The suffix -mal(a) added to a noun groups several individuals (people or things). This construction parallels the English construction ―a group of ...‖ and may be used with nouns referring to people, animals, birds or things. As in English, the grouping of individual people/things by use of the -mal(a) construction is not a permanent grouping, but for some reason the members included in the group are associated in a particular situation.

Examples

1. machimal

‗group of boys‘

This is used for a ―group of boys‖ in contrast to ―(all the) boys.‖

2. yannumal

‗(a herd of) peccaries‘

A group can be referred to by their spokesman + -mal.

Example

Pedromal

‗Peter and the others (i.e., Peter and those included with him)‘

When the suffix -mal(a) is used with certain classes of people, an idiomatic derogatory meaning is communicated.

13.4 Grammar

165

Example

Pabmal keg pega chunmake.

(In annoyance): ‗Your parents haven‘t taught you (any manners).‘

Other words which have a derogatory connotation70 when used in conjunction with -mal(a) are:

1a. ome b. omemal 2a. nan b. nanmal 3a. nanzhel b. nanzhelmal 4a. pabzhel b. pabzhelmal

‗woman‘ ‗women‘ ‗mother‘ ‗mothers‘ ‗grandma‘ ‗grandmothers‘ ‗grandfather‘ ‗grandfathers‘

Exercise 8. Group marker -mal(a) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times as a group and with individual students.

Example Teacher: Tulemal noni. Student: Tulemal noni.
1. Tulemal noni. 2. Wagmal kallin pakcha. 3. Machimal tagar chwas. 4. Punamal madun ogobzha; tulemalga.
5. Tulemal nos.

‗(A group of) Kunas arrived.‘ ‗(A group of) outsiders bought a chicken.‘ ‗(A group of) young men gathered thatch.‘ ‗(A group of) girls gave chicha to (a group of) people to drink.‘ ‗(A group of) people have stopped (left off working).‘

Exercise 9. Group marker -mal(a) drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it, changing the subject to the -mal(a) form.

Example Teacher: Tule noni. Student: Tulemal noni.
1. Tule noni. 2. Machi yannu amine. 3. Achu mutik kolmas. 4. An nade. 5. Chikwi ob mas.

‗People arrived.‘ ‗The young man is going to hunt peccary.‘ ‗The dog barked (last) night.‘ ‗I left.‘ ‗The bird (ate) pecked the corn.‘

3) Position of inclusion markers
The suffixes -mal(a) and -gan/-kan attach to the noun stem. All other noun suffixes follow these suffixes.

4) Use of -gan/-kan versus -mal
Any of the words which take -gan/-kan can also take -mal(a). The question arises, ―When do I choose -gan/-kan and when do I choose -mal(a)?‖

a) -gan/-kan is used to refer to a class of people who are proficient in a certain area, or who have reached a particular social status.

Example Machergan ormanemal.

‗The men are going to meet.‘

70 When the words omemal ‗female‘ and machermal ‗male‘ are used to refer to the sex of animals and/or birds, they do not have a derogatory connotation. For example, yannu omemal ‗peccary sows‘ and kallin machermal ‗roosters‘.

166

Communicating Community Togetherness

―Machergan‖ refers to people who have the social prestige of being men. -gan/-kan is generally used only for people. It groups a class of people together, rather than describing a temporary grouping.

b) -mal(a) is used to refer to a group of people or things as a unit. These people or things are grouped on a temporary basis for some reason or another and parallels the English construction, ―a group of ...‖

Examples 1. Tulegan noni. 2. Tulemal noni.

‗People (who are specialists in a field) arrived.‘ ‗(A group of) people arrived.‘

Exercise 10. -mal(a) versus -gan/-kan selective choice drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student adds the suffix -mal(a) or -gan/-kan to the subject of the sentence, as the sense of the sentence requires.

Example Teacher: Machered noni. Student: Machergan noni.
1. Machered noni. 2. Tule noni. 3. Ome turwa mine. 4. Achu chule kas. 5. Machi yannu amine.

‗The man arrived.‘ ‗The Kuna person arrived.‘ ‗The woman is throwing out the rubbish.‘ ‗The dog caught a paca.‘ ‗The boy is going to hunt peccary.‘

5) Use of -mal(a) with -gan/-kan
Sometimes it is necessary to speak of a group of people who have a certain status, skill, or class. To form this construction, you add the short form of -gan/-kan to the noun stem and then add -mal(a): noun + -gan/-kan + -mal(a).

Example

Pay tolganmal pistagin arpananimal.

‗(A group of) Paya inhabitants are working on the airstrip.‘

In this case, the phrase Pay tolganmal refers to a group of people who qualify in the class of inhabitants of Paya.

6) Use of -mal with -mal(a)
Occasionally, it is necessary to say, ―a group of groups.‖ This construction is formed by adding the short form of -mal to the noun stem and then repeating -mal(a).

Examples 1. Tulemalmal pukwa.
2. Immalmalmal webal kagan mamal. Example 2 above is a very rare construction.

‗Small groups of people from among the (larger) group of people were sitting around.‘ or ‗Small clusters of people (from among the larger group) were sitting around.‘
‗Clusters of animals are grazing over there.‘

Exercise 11. -ganmal/-kanmal frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Pay tolganmal pistogin arpananimal.

Student: Pay tolganmal pistagin arpananimal.

1. Pay tolganmal pistagin arpananimal.

‗A group of Paya inhabitants are all working on the airstrip.‘

2. Macherganmal kullubal taim takcha.

‗A group of men saw the alligator on the bank.‘

3. Nuskanmal escuela magarbal tedomanimal. ‗A group of children are playing outside the school.‘

13.4 Grammar

167

7) Use of -gan/-kan with species of animals and plants
In rare cases, the suffix -gan/-kan is used with words other than71 those which refer to people. This construction is usually associated with the concept of location, and may be rendered in English by ―among the ____‖

Examples

1. yannugan

‗a place where peccaries gather‘

2. nagwalgan

‗a place with many stands of hiraca reeds‘

Because this construction refers to a location, it may be used with the locative suffixes -gin/-kin and -bal: noun + -gan/-kan + -bal or -gin/-kin.

Examples 1. An es ebes masgangin. 2. An es iges yannuganbal. 3. Chugangin koe chu kwa ma.

‗I left the machete among the plantains.‘ ‗I forgot my machete where the peccaries were.‘ ‗Deer eat igarón seeds among the igarón.‘

13.4.3.2 Plural verb forms
Verb forms in Kuna generally do not indicate whether the subject is singular or plural. However, there are two exceptions: 1) positional (―to be‖) verbs have both a singular and a plural form, and 2) the inclusive marker -mal(a) may be attached to a verb to indicate that the subject is plural.

1) Positional (“to be”) verbs
The following five positional (―to be‖) verbs (of Section 6.4.1) have distinct singular and plural forms. The appropriate singular or plural forms are used also when the verbs function as present progressive suffixes.

Examples

Singular

Plural

1. mai

mami

‗to lie down‘

2. nai

nani

‗to hang/do actively‘

3. chi

pukwa

‗to sit/do passively‘

4. kwichi 5. un

pukwa unmal72

‗to stand‘ ‗to be ―on all fours‖‘

When the subject of these positional verbs is singular, the singular form of the verb is used. The plural form of the verbs is used when appropriate, even if the subject does not include the suffixes -gan/-kan or -mal(a).

Examples 1. Tule arpanani. 2. Tulemal arpanani. 3. Tulegan arpanani.

‗The people are working.‘ ‗The group of people are working.‘ ‗Its people (who are specialists) are working.‘

Exercise 12. nani/mami/pukwa frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

71 For example, kagan ‗foliage‘. 72 Note that the pluralization of the positional verb un ‗on all fours‘ is formed by the addition of the group marker –mal(a).

168

Communicating Community Togetherness

Example Teacher: Nuskan kammami.

Student: Nuskan kammami.

1. Nuskan kammami.

‗The children are sleeping.‘

2. Yegusmalad kachigin mami.

‗The sick ones are lying in hammocks.‘

3. Chigli pukwa.

‗Wild turkeys are there.‘

4. Mol mesagin pukwa.

‗The clothes are on the table.‘

5. Eswal magarbal pukwa.

‗The spears are standing outside.‘

6. Tulemal arpanani.

‗The group of people are working.‘

7. Nuskan todonani.

‗The children are playing.‘

Exercise 13. nani/mami/pukwa substitution drill
The teacher says the sentence in the singular and the student repeats it, changing it to the plural form.

Example Teacher: Tule arpanai. Student: Tule arpanani.
1. Tule arpanai. 2. Yannu chowal mali kunnai. 3. Karpa chi. 4. Mol neggin chi. 5. Es mesa ulpal mai. 6. Mimmi kammai. 7. Eswal wegin kwichi. 8. Chia tuppal kwichi.

‗The person/Kuna is working.‘ ‗The peccary is eating a root.‘ ‗The basket is (there).‘ ‗The cloth is at home.‘ ‗The machete is under the table.‘ ‗The baby is sleeping.‘ ‗The spear is standing there.‘ ‗The cocoa tree is on the peninsula.‘

2) Use of group marker -mal with verbs
When -mal is added to the verb, it indicates that the whole group to which the subject refers performed the action of the verb at the same time, i.e., all the members are included in the action.

Example

Tule nanmal.

‗The people all left (at the same time).‘

This does not have the same meaning as Tule pel nade. ‗All the people left (at various times).‘ Rather, it indicates that the whole group performed the action of the verb at the same time.

Exercise 14. Group marker -mal with verb frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Tulemal arpananimal.

Student: Tulemal arpananimal.

1. Tulemal arpananimal.

‗The people are all working.‘

2. Nuskan todonanimal.

‗The children are all playing.‘

3. Machimal nanmal.

‗The boys all went.‘

4. Machergan ormapukmal.

‗The men are all in a meeting.‘

5. Wagi ob masmal.

‗The parrots all ate the corn.‘

Note the suffix order, that -mal inclusive occurs after the aspect markers -ne, -cha, -nani, etc., but before -bal ‗again‘ or -mo ‗too‘. It is in Group II.

Example Machimal mas kuchamalbal.

‗The boys all ate food again.‘

Exercise 15. Group marker -mal with verb drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it using the -mal form.

13.4 Grammar

13.4.4 Verb ku ‘to happen/become’
The use of the verb ku ‗to happen/become‘ parallels the English construction, ―(An event) happened.‖ Various verbal suffixes may be added to ku to give shades of meaning.

Examples

1. ¿Igi kude?

‗What has happened?‘

2. ¿Igi kunani?

‗What is (things are) happening?‘

3. ¿Igi kudi?

‗How did you behave/react/respond?‘

4. ¿Igi kus?

‗How did it happen?‘

5. ¿Igi an kuo?

‗What will happen to me (externally)?‘

6. ¿Igi ankin kuo?

‗What will happen to me (internally)?‘

7. Teob kus.

‗That is what happened.‘

The verb ku may be used as a suffix -ku/-gu which attaches to an adjective or to another verb in order to form a construction paralleling the English construction, ―to become...‖.

Examples

1. An yegus.

‗I became sick.‘

2. Mol tinkus.

‗The clothes became dry.‘

3. An es amigual.

‗I came to be (became) looking for the machete.‘

The discussion of -ku/-gu as a past dependent prior condition is found in Section 12.4.1.2.2-B.

Example Neg omosgu, tulemal pukwa.

‗When I arrived at the place, the people were there.‘

13.4.5 Conjunctions
There are only a few commonly used conjunctions in Kuna. In general speech or storytelling, a conjunction or a subordinate clause (see 12.4.2.1b) is used at the beginning of almost every sentence. Several common conjunctions are discussed. Many of them are based on te ‗then‘.

13.4.5.1 Sequential conjunction tegin(e) „and then‟
Tegin(e) ‗and then‘ is used to indicate either temporal sequence (one action following another) or logical sequence (one idea following another).

Examples

1. Tegin sagla immal aminad.

‗Then the chief went hunting.‘

2. Tegin sagla us abingus.

‗Then (he) met an agouti.‘

3. Tegin ilgwen imas.

‗Then (he) shot once.‘

4. Mecha.

‗(He) killed (it).‘

In the above examples, the speaker viewed the events of the sequence as following one after another in a time sequence. Each separate event began with the word tegin ‗then‘. The speaker viewed the shooting, Tegin ilgwen imas, and the killing in the last sentence Mecha, as a single main action, not as a sequence of actions and, therefore, did not use the conjunction tegin.

The speaker could have chosen to consider the two last actions imas ‗shot‘ and mecha ‗killed‘ as separate and used the conjunction in the last sentence.

Examples 1. Tegin sagla immal aminad. 2. Tegin sagla us abingus. 3. Tegin ilgwen imas.

‗Then the chief went hunting.‘ ‗Then (he) met an agouti.‘ ‗Then (he) shot once.‘

13.4 Grammar

171

4. Tegin tar mecha.

‗Then (he) killed it.‘

Tegine, the long form of tegin, tends to be used in adding onto something already said such as in listing.73

Example An immal pakcha; aros, palu, tegine kwallu.

‗I bought some things, rice, salt, and oil.‘

13.4.5.2 Variations of tegin(e)

1) tegin kep
Tegin kep ‗then only/only after that‘ is used to make the present event a clear sequel to the previous event, that is to say, only after the one event happened did the actor continue with the sequence.

Examples 1. Antin wis mas kucha. 2. Tegin keb an nadbal.

‗I had a (little) bite to eat.‘ ‗Only then did I go on again.‘

2) tegin and tebal
Tegin ‗that is where‘ and tebal ‗that is where‘ may be used as locatives to refer back to a narrow or broad setting (see 8.4.1) in adverbial clauses of location.

Examples

1. Machi sae koe mechadgin, tegin an es onos. ‗At the place where the boy killed the deer, is where (the exact spot) I found the machete.‘

2. Pukur igalbal, tebal an ti.

‗Along the Pucuru trail, that is (more or less) where I was.‘

3) tegidgin
The conjunction, tegidgin ‗at the same time‘ is used to indicate simultaneous action.

Examples

1. Tegin koe tigin arkwasgu, tegidgin an imas. ‗Then as the deer fell into the water, at that moment, I fired.‘

2a. Sagladin, anche ekichis.

‗The chief asked me.‘

b. Tegidgin an nega chogal.

‗At that precise moment, I told (the chief) himself.‘

13.4.5.3 Change-of-direction marker tenal
Tenal ‗but‘ marks a change in the direction that a sequence of events or ideas are taking or it may mark an unexpected outcome or response. Thus, it may be used when the expected result is not achieved. It may also be used to modify a general statement. Tenal ‗but‘ is not used to contrast or indicate one thing as opposite from another. The contrastive construction uses the suffix -din/-tin (see Appendix E.4).

Examples
1. Pedro Panamaje nebi tenal adin igal ma nikchul.
2. An immal paknade, tenal an kwen immal pakchajul.
3a. Koedin igalgin un. b. Tenal antin kwen imachul. c. Antin pala saté.

‗Peter wants to go to Panama but he does not have permission.‘ ‗I went to buy (some) things but I did not buy anything.‘ ‗The deer was standing on the trail.‘ ‗But I did not shoot.‘ ‗I had no bullet.‘

73 See Section 5.4.2.

172

Communicating Community Togetherness

13.4.5.4 Change-of-topic marker te choggudin(a)
Te choggudin(a) ‗then I have something else to say‘ is frequently used in long teaching discourses to mark a shift from one topic to another.

Examples
1. ...Nuskandin e pabgandin atakenab. 2. Te choggudina Pab Tummaddin anmalga
igal ebes...

‗...Children ought to respect their parents.‘
‗Then I have something else to say: the Big Father left us our traditions...‘

13.4.5.5 Result conjunction tegil
Certain situations lead to or make possible a subsequent action. The conjunction tegil ‗so (then)‘ may come before or after the subsequent action to relate the action to the preceding one.

Examples

1. Tegil an ne.

‗So then I am going to go (now).‘

2. An ne tegil.

‗I am going to go then.‘

This construction differs from the assertive (emphatic) construction formed by the addition of the suffix -do/-to (see Appendix E.6).

Example An nedo.

‗I am going to go.‘

It also differs from the consequential action formed by the addition of the consequential suffix -chun/-zhun/-jun to the verb (see 19.4.5).

Example An nejun.

‗Consequently, I am going to go.‘

13.4.5.6 Concessive conjunction yabli
In order to express the concept that in spite of what has/will happen, an event has/will take(n) place, the adverb yabli ‗in spite of/even though/nevertheless‘ is used. It usually occurs before the subject in a concessive clause although it may occur after it in the adverbial position in a simple sentence. Yabli may also be used to express the English concept, ―whether...‖ or ―whether ... happens, still ... (is going to happen).‖

Examples

1. Yabli an neelen, antin machi pentachulin. ‗Even though I were to go, I wouldn‘t help the boy.‘

2. Antin yabli nad.

‗I went nevertheless.‘

3. Yabli an chunma, yabli an yakir pes, tulemal an kwen ibzhachulmal.

‗Whether I talked (or) whether I remained silent, still nobody believed me.‘

Yabli ‗nevertheless‘ is used following tenal ‗but‘ when the event is not expected to occur because of the adverse circumstances.

Example Ti winai, tenal yabli an nad. ‗It was raining but nevertheless, I went.‘

13.4.5.7 Explanation introducer immidin Immidin ‗now/now then‘ is used to introduce an explanation.

Example Immidin pedin wis antin nejuli.

‗Now (to explain) you know I am not going.‘

13.4.5.8 Reason-result construction with ulgin One event may take place because of another. The reason for action adverb ulgin may be used in a clause of reason, or to initiate a sentence which is the result of a previous sentence.
The reason clause is marked by using the nominalizer suffix -d/-t with the verb, followed by the word ulgin. This clause may occur in either the adverbial or postpredicate position.

13.4 Grammar

173

Examples
1. Jaime pe chogzhad ulgin nad. ‗Jim left/went because of what you said.‘ 2. Jaime nad, pe chogzhad ulgin. ‗Jim left/went because of what you said.‘ Sometimes the reason is given in one sentence and is followed by a sentence which gives the resultant action. This second sentence is introduced by either a ulgin ‗because of that‘ or te ulgin ‗because of that very thing‘.

Examples
1a. Antin ye. b. A ulgin an arpachuli.74 2a. Pe chogzha. b. Te ulgin an nejuli.

‗I am sick.‘ ‗Because of that, I did not work.‘ ‗You told (it).‘ ‗Because of that very thing, I am not going to go.‘

1) Extended use of ulgin
Ulgin ‗because of‘ is also used to express the fault of someone or conversely, in a good sense, ‗by virtue of (someone)‘.

Examples 1. Motordin pe ulgin iskus. 2. An pe ulgin abonoles.

‗(It was) your fault that the outboard motor broke.‘ ‗I was rescued by/because of you.‘

2) Other similar constructions
There are two other words which contrast with ulgin in some constructions: anal ‗in the place of‘ and nuggin ‗by/in the authority of/name of‘. The three are contrasted in the following sentences.

Examples

1. An poni nikad ulgin purkwene.75

‗I am going to die because of the disease I have.‘

2. Pedro an anal neg kweburga immal paknao. ‗Peter will go in my place to buy things for the town.‘

3. Antin sagla nuggin immal imako.

‗I will do it by the authority of the chief.‘

13.4.5.9 Cause-effect construction ulal
One event may be caused by another. This differs from reason in that the reason may have prompted or influenced the course of action, but it did not actually cause it or bring it about. Cause is marked by ulal ‗the cause of‘. It almost always occurs together with the appropriate demonstrative a or te. The cause sentence occurs first. The next sentence is introduced by a ulal ‗that is why/the cause of‘ or te ulal ‗that is exactly why/the cause of‘.

Examples 1a. Telefono iskus. b. A ulal keg an pebak chunma. 2a. Pedin wis chapidin akangin aglas. b. Te ulal pe anka akan pid pakenab.

‗The telephone is out of order.‘ ‗That is why I can‘t talk with you.‘ ‗You know (that) the tree fell on the axe. That’s exactly why you have to buy me another one.‘

13.4.5.10 Logical outcome
An event may be anticipated and a certain cause of action embarked on accordingly. In expressing this idea, the anticipated situation is given in one sentence. The subsequent action embarked on is introduced by al ‗this leads/led to‘.

Examples 1. Pedro pe yartakojob. 2. Al an iktual pega chogdani.

‗Peter says he is going to deceive/cheat you.‘ ‗This led me to come and tell you beforehand.‘

74 arpas ‗worked‘ + chuli ‗not‘ = arpachuli ‗did not work‘. 75 For verb ending in -kwe, see Appendix H.

‗Did you kill (it)?‘ ‗(Yes), I killed it. Then we saw a bushmaster (snake) on the trail.‘ ‗Really!‘ ‗Yes. But my brother-in-law killed it with a machete.‘ ‗Yikes!‘ ‗That‘s what happened to me!‘ ‗A-hah!‘

14.2 Pronunciation (Ex. 1–4)
Visiting is the heart of social interaction. Concentrate on sounding natural by drilling and redrilling conversational patterns such as those found in Dialogue 14.1. Note the difference between a formal, laryngealized, nothing-much-happened, disclaiming response (see 16.4.3) intonation and a relaxed, more intimate, and common intonation.
Exercise 1. Tracking
Track the teacher as he says Dialogue 14.1. Be sure to keep within two or three syllables behind him at all times. Repeat this exercise several times, concentrating on the common intonation pattern.
Exercise 2. Dramatizing the dialogue
Dramatize Dialogue 14.1 with the student playing the role. The teacher is to check for:
1. correct common intonation patterns, 2. correct pronunciation, and 3. correct gestures.

76 A common feature of Kuna is the repetition of the subject. This is similar to the English construction, ―As for me, I went to the jungle.‖

14.3 Culture
Often during the course of a conversation your host‘s wife will bring a drink of madun ‗chicha‘. Madun is a very tasty drink made from boiled, ripe plantains and sugar cane juice. It is often flavored with chocolate. You should take the bowl offered to you. Sometimes you will go visiting just after you have eaten a meal. It is polite to decline the drink, or drink only part of it as you explain to your hostess that you are very sorry, but you have just eaten.
As you drink the madun, your hostess, or the lady who brought you the drink, will stand on the sidelines. It is customary to drink the full bowl down without a pause. When you finish, hold the bowl away from you slightly. This gesture will indicate to the hostess that you are done and that she may take your cup. It would be impolite for her to leave you holding an empty cup/bowl. The lady will take it back to the kitchen, wash it, and serve the next person.
As you give the bowl back it is appropriate to signal your appreciation with nuedi ‗thank you/good‘ or even a simple ajáj ‗(acknowledgement)‘. If the woman fails to notice that you are holding out the bowl to be taken, you may say murruk ‗bowl‘ to draw her attention to it.
Correct etiquette dictates that the male visitors be served first, starting with the most important man present. If there is no clear difference in social status, older men are served first in order of decreasing age. If status or age differences are unclear, you may start at one end of the room and go around offering the various people in attendance a drink. The host is served after the men visitors have been served. Boys are served next, then the women, and finally the girls.
When guests are served a meal, they are allowed to eat alone. The hostess hovers in the sidelines to be available to cater to any needs which may arise. The host does not eat with the guests. Conversation during meals is minimal.

14.4 Grammar

14.4.1 Inceptive aspect -al(i) (Ex. 5–6)
The inceptive aspect -al(i) is suffixed to verbs to refer to the beginning/starting of an action. It parallels the English construction ―began to ...‖

Examples 1. Mimmi poal. 2. Ti wial.

‗The baby began to cry.‘ ‗It began to rain.‘

Exercise 5. Inceptive aspect -al(i) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc.

Example Teacher: Mimmi poal. Student: Mimmi poal.
1. Mimmi poal. 2. Ti wial. 3. Ome pato mas tual. 4. Ti noal.

‗The baby began to cry.‘ ‗It began to rain.‘ ‗The woman has already started to cook the food.‘ ‗The river is starting to rise.‘

14.4 Grammar

5. Machergan pato neg emial.

‗The men have already begun to clean the town.‘

Exercise 6. Inceptive aspect -al stimulus response drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student replies using the -al form of the verb in the frame.

Example Teacher: ¿Ome ampayo mas tu?

Student: Chuli. Ome pato mas tual.

Frame Chuli.____ pato ____-al.

1. ¿Ome ampayo mas tu?

‗Is the woman not cooking the food yet?‘

2. ¿Ti ampayo no?

‗Is the river not rising yet?‘

3. ¿Tad ampayo neg chob?

‗Is the elder not building (his) house yet?‘

4. ¿Mu ampayo upchan mag?

‗Is the grandmother not dyeing the cotton yet?‘

5. ¿Machi ampayo igal emi?

‗Is the boy not clearing the trail yet?‘

14.4.2 Preparatory aspect –chogal/-zhogal/-jogal (Ex. 7–8)
If the action is about to begin rather than actually starting, the suffix -chog/-zhog/-jog is inserted before -al(i). The preparatory aspect parallels the English construction ―about to ...‖, ―ready to ...‖ etc.

Examples 1. Antin pato nejogal. 2. Tad karpa chobzhogal. 3. Ome mol chikchogal.

‗I‘m already about to go.‘ ‗Grandfather is about to make a basket.‘ ‗The woman is about to cut cloth.‘

Exercise 7. Preparatory aspect frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc.

Example Teacher: Antin pato nejogal.

Student: Antin pato nejogal.

Example Teacher: Ome mol pakchogal.

Teacher: chik

Student: Ome mol chikchogal.

Frame Ome mol ____-chogal.

‗The woman is about to ____ the blouse.‘

1. pak

‗buy‘

2. nerma

‗write/draw a design‘

14.4.3 Habitual aspect condition (Ex. 9–10)
Some events happen habitually (―all the time‖), but only under certain conditions, for example, ―When it rains, the roof always leaks.‖ That is to say, the roof does not always leak, but every time, or whenever it rains, the roof leaks. To form this construction, Kunas add the suffix -alil77 to the conditional verb. In the case of this habitual aspect condition, the main Event A (the roof leaks) habitually happens whenever Event B (rain) occurs.

Example Ai yegualil, an ina che.

‗Whenever (my) friend is sick, I administer medicine.‘

Exercise 9. Habitual aspect condition frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Ai yegualil, an ina che. Student: Ai yegualil, an ina che.
1. Ai yegualil, an ina che. 2. Ti wialil, an wartiku. 3. Neg kwebur emialil, pel arpa. 4. An abarmakalil, pirkin anwimake. 5. Ome ua tualil an ua kun.

‗Whenever (my) friend gets sick, I administer medicine.‘ ‗When it rains, I get wet.‘ ‗Whenever the town is cleaned, everyone works.‘ ‗When I run, I perspire a lot.‘ ‗When the woman cooks fish, I eat it.‘

Exercise 10. Habitual aspect condition drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student changes it into an -alil (customary condition) form and adds the independent sentence an ina che ‗I do medicine‘.

Example Teacher: Ai yegus.

Student: Ai yegualil, an ina che.

Frame ____-alil an ina che.

1. Ai yegus.

‗(A) friend is sick.‘

2. Nuskan aglas.

‗Children tripped (and fell).‘

3. Pe kummas.

‗You were burnt.‘

4. Nuskan chikleja.

‗The children were cut.‘

5. Machi ugene.

‗The boy is going to have a fever.‘

14.4.4 Response to the habitual aspect condition (Ex. 11)
In the most common use of the habitual aspect condition, the actor in the independent clause habitually responds to the situation presented by the condition. This parallels the English construction, ―Whenever ..., I (always)....‖
Some other responses to the habitual aspect condition occur with irregularity (―seldom/usually‖) and some responses occur with regularity (―every time/every other time‖).

14.4.4.1 Irregular response to habitual aspect condition
When the response to the habitual aspect condition is irregular, an appropriate adverb is used to modify the verb in the independent sentence. Appropriate adverbs include: tigujal ‗usually‘, impagin ‗often‘ and impakwa ‗seldom/rarely‘.

77 -alil is made up of the inceptive aspect -ali plus the prior conditional suffix -l (see 12.4.1.b).

14.4 Grammar

179

Examples 1. An ai yegualil, an tigujal ina che.
2. An ai yegualil, an impagin ina che. 3. An ai yegualil, an impakwa ina che.

‗When my friend gets sick, I usually administer medicine.‘
‗When my friend gets sick, I often administer medicine.‘
‗When my friend gets sick, I occasionally administer medicine.‘

14.4.4.2 Regular response to habitual aspect condition (Ex. 11)
When the response to the habitual aspect condition is regular, the nominalized form of the verb stem in the conditional clause is followed by the appropriate adverbs. The shape of the adverb (with the exception of ―every time‖) varies according to the appropriate number stem used. For example, ilbal ‗every time‘, il-ilbogin ‗every second (other) time‘, and il-ilpagin ‗every third time‘.

Examples 1. An ai yegued ilbal, an ina che.
2. An machi uged il-ilbogin, nono pirpirma.

‗Every time my friend gets sick, I administer medicine.‘
‗Every other time my son has a fever, he gets dizzy (lit.: his head wanders).‘

Exercise 11. Habitual aspect condition drill
The teacher selects a sentence below and says it. The student substitutes the sentence in the frame.

Example Teacher: Machered mas emis.

Student: Machered mas emijad ilbal, adin ukul nika.

Frame ____-d ilbal, adin ukul nika. ‗Every time ____, he/she is hungry/thirsty.‘

1. Machered mas emis.

‗The man cleared the plantains.‘

2. Machi ua makti.

‗The boy speared fish.‘

3. Pun mas tus.

‗The girl cooked food.‘

4. Ome neg turwis.

‗The woman swept the house.‘

5. Tad neg chobzha.

‗The elder built/worked on a house.‘

14.4.5 Conditional with –le (Ex. 12)
A conditional sentence parallels the English construction ―If..., then....‖ It is constructed by adding the suffix -le to the long form of the verb stem or to the suffixed verb in the conditional clause. This construction is used when the speaker is uncertain whether or not a condition will be fulfilled.

Examples
1. An mol pakele, an pega uko.
2. Anmal yannu makmalale, anmal wis chan pega ukmogo.78

‗If I buy cloth, I‘ll give (it) to you.‘
‗If we shoot a peccary, we will give you a little meat, too.‘

Exercise 12. Conditional -le frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc.

Example Teacher: An mol pakele, an mol kinnid pako.

Student: An mol pakele, an mol kinnid pako.

1. An mol pakele, an mol kinnid pako.

‗If I buy cloth, I‘ll buy red (cloth).‘

2. An ul ukele, an ul toto uko.

‗If I sell a canoe, I‘ll sell the small one.‘

78 The indirect object pega occurs after the direct object chan in this example, in order to focus more attention on the one receiving the meat than on the meat itself.

180

3. An mas tuele, an aros tuo. 4. An mas kunnele, an arri chan kunno. 5. Pe chapurbal neele, an bebak nao.

‗If I cook (food), I‘ll cook rice.‘ ‗If I eat (food), I‘ll eat iguana meat.‘ ‗If you go to the jungle, I‘ll go with you.‘

14.4.6 Purpose suffix -gal/-kal (Ex. 13–15)
The purposive suffix -gal/-kal is added to the verb stem of a purpose clause in order to express the purpose for the action of the independent sentence. It may also be added to certain verbs to form a noun which serves as the tool with which to perform the action of the verb.
There are three types of purpose clauses; a straightforward explanation of the purpose of the action in the main clause, a reference to the event that it is hoped will be precipitated by the action in the main clause, and a reference to the event which it is hoped will be prevented by the action in the main clause.

14.4.6.1 Purpose clause - explanation of action
One type of purpose clause is formed by adding the purposive suffix -gal/-kal to the verb (stem) of the (purpose) clause. This type of purpose construction is used to give a straightforward explanation of the purpose or desired goal of the action in the independent sentence. It parallels the English construction, ―He went shopping to buy shoes.‖ In this construction, the focus is on the independent sentence. The speaker wishes to express one main idea, but adds the purpose construction to give additional background information. Hence, the purpose clause does not advance the listener to the next step in the story/explanation/argument, but rather gives the motive for the main action.

Although a purpose clause may occur in the adverbial position in a sentence, it usually occurs at the end of a sentence in the postpredicate position (see 17.4.1).

Examples

1. Machimal ya akinai, ti ariogal.

‗The boys are digging a ditch (hole), to let the water flow (out).‘

2a. Nandin mol makcha, manigin ukegal.

‗Mother sewed a blouse to sell for money.‘

b. Nandin manigin ukegal mol makcha.

‗Mother sewed the blouse to sell it for money.‘

When the subject and/or object of the purpose clause is the same as that of the independent sentence, it is not repeated in the purpose clause.

Example

An mol pakcha, nanga ukegal.

‗I bought cloth (for me) to give (it) to Mother.‘

However, if the subject of the main clause becomes the indirect object of the purpose clause, it must be repeated with the suffix -ga/-ka.

Example An ina pakcha, nan anka madu chobgal. ‗I bought yeast, for Mother to make bread for me.‘

14.4.6.2 Purpose clause - event precipitated by action of independent sentence Another type of purpose clause expresses the event which, it is hoped, will be precipitated by the action in the independent sentence. This clause begins with meke ‗in order that‘ and the purposive suffix -gal/-kal is added to the verb.
The purpose clause marked by meke ‗in order to‘ focusses more attention on the purpose than on the main action. It expresses the desired outcome or result (as yet unfulfilled) of the main action. It is part of the mainline information and advances the story/explanation/argument another step in the logical progression.
The meke form of a purpose clause almost always occurs in the postpredicate position. Even though the subject may be the same in both clauses, it must be stated in both clauses.

14.4 Grammar

181

Examples

1. Antin pe pabga mani palmine, meke adin ‗I am going to send money to your father, in order

Panamaje taggal.

that he will come to Panama.‘

2. Antin immis mani amine, meke an pan nabir immal pakegal.

‗I am going to get money today, so that I can buy (some) things tomorrow.‘

In order to understand the change of focus given by the use of the word meke, contrast Example 1 above with the following sentence, in which the purpose of sending money is explained, rather than focussing on the goal of having your father come to Panama.

Example
Antin pe pabga mani palmine, adin Panamaje taggal.

‗I am going to send money to your father, to/for him to come to Panama.‘

14.4.6.3 Purpose clause - event prevented by independent sentence action
This third type of purpose clause expresses the event which, it is hoped, will be averted/prevented by the action in the independent sentence. This clause begins with the adverb melle ‗don‘t‘ and the purposive suffix -gal/-kal is added to the verb. This parallels the English construction ―in order not to....‖

Example Pe anka chogo, melle an igegal.

‗You tell me, in order that I will not forget.‘

Exercise 13. Purposive suffix -gal/-kal frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Sagla mani ukcha, ob pakegal.

Student: Sagla mani ukcha, ob pakegal.

1. Sagla mani ukcha, ob pakegal.

‗The chief gave (me) money in order to buy corn.‘

2. An ne, immal pakegal.

‗I am going, in order to buy something.‘

3. Machimal ya kinai, ti ariogal.

‗The boys are digging a ditch, in order for the water to

flow (away).‘

4. An akan amine, tad ul chobgal.

‗I am going to look for an axe in order for grandfather to make a canoe.‘

5. An kal palmis, nudagal.

‗I sent the radio, in order to repair it.‘

Exercise 14. Purposive suffix -gal/-kal drill
The teacher reads the pair of sentences. The student makes the second sentence into a purpose clause by using -gal/-kal.

Example Teacher: Machi kinki pakcha.

Teacher: Machi immal amine

Student: Machi kinki pakcha, immal aminegal.

1a. Machi kinki pakcha.

‗The young man bought a gun.‘

b. Machi immal amine.

‗The young man is going to go hunting.‘

2a. Ome mol makcha.

‗The woman sewed a blouse.‘

b. Ome mol ukne.

‗The woman is going to sell the blouse.‘

3a. Tad koe mecha.

‗The elder killed a deer.‘

b. Tad koe kunne.

‗The elder is going to eat the deer.‘

4a. Tule tagar chwas.

‗The people gathered thatch.‘

182

Social Interaction

Exercise 15. Purposive suffix -gal/-kal with meke or melle
The teacher says the sentence and then says either meke or melle. The student uses the frame to make a sentence incorporating the sentence said by the teacher as a purpose clause.

Example Teacher: An ne.

Teacher: melle

Student: Pe anka chogo, melle an negal.

Frame Pe anka chogo: meke/melle ____-gal. ‗Please tell me so that I will/won‘t ____.‘

1. An ne.

‗I am going.‘

2. Machi e urpa pentas.

‗The boy helped his younger brother.‘

3. An pega mol ukcha.

‗I sold the blouse for you.‘

4. An mas kunne.

‗I am going to eat.‘

5. An machi odurtas.

‗I punished the boy.‘

14.4.6.4 Noun of purpose (implement)
An implement or tool used in performing a certain task or action may be referred to by adding the suffix -gal/-kal to the verb stem that describes the action itself.

Examples

1a. turwi

‗to sweep‘

b. turwigal

‗broom‘

2a. igmu

‗to burrow‘

b. igmugal

‗(type of) hoe (for burrowing in the earth) (Spanish: coa)‘

This device for naming implements cannot be used for all implements. Some forms are unacceptable, and some are never used. It is very useful, however, in describing a tool foreign to the culture.

14.4.7 Accompaniment suffix -bak/-pak (Ex. 16–19)
In English, the preposition ―with‖ is used to refer to accompaniment. For example, ―I ate fish with (accompanied by) my wife.‖ or ―I ate fish with (accompanied by) rice.‖ In Kuna, the concept of accompaniment is rendered by the suffix -bak/-pak attached to the noun. The -bak/-pak form of a word occurs in the same place in a sentence as an adverb.

Examples

1. An arozbak ua kucha.

‗I ate fish with rice.‘

2. An omebak ua kucha.

‗I ate fish with my wife.‘

If an adverb also occurs, one could say: subject + adverb + accompaniment + object + verb.

Example

An kueye-kueye arosbak ua kucha.

‗I quickly ate the fish with (my) rice.‘

However, because of information overload (see Section 17), the preferred construction is: subject + adverb + object + verb + accompaniment.

Example

An kueye-kueye ua kucha, arosbak.

‗I quickly ate the fish with my rice.‘

-bak/-pak may also be used to associate the subject or object of the sentence with another person.

Examples 1. An saglabak ai nued. 2. Pablo saglabak aichulid. 3. Pedro saglabak istargad.

‗I am a good friend of the chief.‘ ‗Paul is an enemy of the chief.‘ ‗Peter is opposed to the chief.‘

14.4 Grammar

183

However, note the following exception in an equative sentence.

4. Juan saglabakad.

‗John is an ally/companion of the chief.‘

Kinship terms are not stated this way, but rather with possessive phrases (see 13.4.2).

Examples

1. Pablo Juan urpa. 2. Pablo Juan e79 urpa.

‗Paul is John‘s younger brother.‘ ‗Paul is younger brother to John.‘

In a transitive sentence, the accompaniment element is potentially ambiguous, i.e., it might not be clear whether the additional person is accompanying the subject or the object. Thus, in a sentence such as Juan Pedrobak machi sakis. ‗John with Peter boy hit.‘ one might wonder whether John and Peter hit the boy, or John hit the boy and Peter. The ambiguity is normally avoided by a pause after the subject (indicated by a comma) or by adding the topic marker -din/-tin after the subject.

Examples 1. Juan, Pedrobak machi sakis. 2. Juan Pedrobak, machi sakis. 3. Juandin Pedrobak machi sakis. 4. Juan Pedrobakdin machi sakis.

‗John hit the boy and Peter.‘ ‗John and Peter hit the boy.‘ ‗As for John, (he) hit the boy and Peter.‘ ‗As for John and Peter, (they) hit the boy.‘

Exercise 16. Accompaniment frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Machi pabbak immal aminai.

Student: Machi pabbak immal aminai.

1. Machi pabbak immal aminai.

‗The boy is hunting (something) with (his) father.‘

2. Pun nanbak ti chune.

‗The girl is going to fetch water with (her) mother.‘

3. Tad machibak ul chomne.

‗The elder is going to make a canoe with the boy.‘

4. An arosbak ua kucha.

‗I ate fish with rice.‘

5. Sagla Pedrobak machi palmis.

‗The chief sent the boy with Peter.‘

‗I ate meat with rice.‘ ‗I cut the meat with a knife.‘ ‗I am going to hunt peccary with father.‘ ‗I am going to split firewood with an axe.‘ ‗I am going to fry fish with oil.‘ ‗I ate fish with the boy.‘

14.4.8 Instrument and means (Ex. 20–24)
The description of an action may be modified by referring to the implement or instrument used to perform the action, for example, ―with a hammer‖ or ―with a machete.‖ An action also may be described in terms of the means used to perform it, such as ―by sea‖ or ―by air.‖ The implement/instrument and the means use different suffixes; the specific suffix -gin/-kin and the general suffix -bal/-pal, respectively. These are additional uses of the specific and general locative suffixes -gin/-kin and -bal/-pal of Section 8.4.1.

14.4.8.1 Instrument suffix -gin/-kin
An object such as an implement or tool is often used to carry out an action. This tool is called the instrument. In English, the instrument occurs with the preposition ―with‖, the same preposition as used to indicate accompaniment (see 14.4.7). For example, ―I ate rice with (by means of) a fork.‖ and ―I ate rice with (accompanied by) my wife.‖ In Kuna, however, the instrument is marked by the suffix -gin/-kin added to the noun, or to the last member of the instrumental noun phrase (see 9.4.1.2). The instrument is placed in the adverbial position or just after it.

Examples

1. Machi eswalgin nakpe mecha.

‗The boy killed the snake with a spear.‘

2. Machi es tummadgin nakpe mecha.

‗The boy killed the snake with a big machete.‘

3. Machi kueye-kueye eswalgin nakpe mecha. ‗The boy quickly killed the snake with a spear.‘

In some cases, the use of the instrument suffix -gin/-kin parallels more closely the English construction ―by ____‖ or ―for ____.‖ Vehicles of transportation and the medium of exchange/purchase are generally considered as instruments.

Examples 1. Machi ulgin ne. 2. Juan kukualedgin noni. 3. An manigin es pakcha.

‗The boy is going by (in a) car.‘ ‗John arrived by (in the) plane.‘ ‗I bought the machete with (for) money.‘

Exercise 20. Instrument frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: An esgin mas chikcha. Student: An esgin mas chikcha.
1. An esgin mas chikcha. 2. An akangin chowal chikcha. 3. An eswalgin ua makcha. 4. An ikogin iko unnus. 5. Machi kuchargin aros kucha.

‗I cut the plantains with a machete.‘ ‗I cut the log with an axe.‘ ‗I speared the fish with a fishing spear.‘ ‗I pulled out the thorn with a needle.‘ ‗The boy ate the rice with a spoon.‘

Exercise 21. Instrument substitution drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it adding the instrument in each case.

Example Teacher: An mas chikcha.

Student: An esgin mas chikcha.

Instrument: es

‗machete‘

1a. An mas chikcha.

‗I cut plantains.‘

b. An neg emine.

‗I am going to clean the town.‘

c. An tagar chwas.

‗I gathered thatch.‘

Instrument: kinki

‗gun‘

2a. An koe mecha.

‗I killed a deer.‘

b. An ua makcha.

‗I speared a fish.‘

c. Machi yannu makne.

‗The boy is going to kill a peccary.‘

Exercise 22. Instrument substitution drill
The teacher says the frame and selects an instrument from the list below. The student repeats the sentence substituting the selected instrument in the frame.

Example Teacher: Machi eswalgin ua makcha.

Teacher: es

Student: Machi esgin ua makcha.

Frame Machi ____-gin ua makcha. ‗The boy speared a fish with a ____.‘

1. es

‗machete‘

2. chowal

‗pole/stick of wood‘

3. aktigal

‗pole for poling a canoe‘

4. kinki

‗gun‘

5. eswal

‗spear‘

6. cherwal

‗pole (used for house rafters)‘

14.4.8.2 Means suffix -bal/-pal
The description of an action may be modified by referring to the method used to perform the action. In this case, the method refers to one means of doing an action as opposed to any other means. For example, a person may arrive ―by plane‖ as opposed to ―by car‖ or ―by ship‖. The means usually parallels the English construction ―by (means of) ____‖ and is formed by adding -bal/-pal80 to the instrument noun.

80 An exception for using -bal/-pal for means is the word nagap ‗by/on foot‘.

186

Social Interaction

Examples 1. Pedro igalbal noni. 2. María tibal nad.

‗Peter arrived by trail.‘ ‗Mary went by river.‘

14.4.8.3 Use of -gin/-kin versus -bal/-pal
The use of the instrument versus the means suffix indicates whether the speaker is focussing on the specific instrument which is doing the action, for example, an airplane, or whether he is focussing on one means of accomplishing an action instead of another.

Examples

1a. kukualedgin

‗in a plane‘

b. kukualedbal

‗by air/by plane‘

2a. choulgin

‗in a ship‘

b. choulbal

‗by ship‘

Things sent with people use the means suffix -bal/-pal.

Examples 1. Mani Pedrobal noni. 2. An pebal immalmal palmine.

‗The money arrived with Peter.‘ ‗I am going to send the things with you.‘

Exercise 23. -bal/-pal versus -gin/-kin selection drill
The student reads the sentence supplying the missing suffix -bal/-pal or -gin/-kin.

Example Student: Pedro igalbal noni. 1. Pedro igal____ noni. 2. Mani an____ noni. 3. Sagla choul____ karta palmis. 4. Tad termal____ nad. 5. Chulub ul____ noni. 6. Antin nag____ ne. 7. An korreo____ peje karta palmine. 8. An Luis____ immalmal palmine. 9. Saglagan igal____ nanmal. 10. Tad kukualed____ nad.

‗Peter arrived by trail.‘ ‗The money arrived with me.‘ ‗The chief sent the letter by boat.‘ ‗The elder went by sea.‘ ‗The police arrived by canoe.‘ ‗I am going by foot.‘ ‗I am going to send you a letter by mail.‘ ‗I am going to send the things with Louis.‘ ‗The chiefs went by trail.‘ ‗The elder left by plane.‘

14.4.8.4 Other uses of -bal/-pal and -gin/-kin
The specific and general instrument suffixes may be used to indicate ―source of‖ with nominalized adverbs. They are also used in discussing an object of conversation and the object of faith and trust.

1) Source
The source from which something is obtained is also marked by -gin/-kin and -bal/-pal, depending on whether it is specific or general, respectively. This parallels the English construction ―(to get) from....‖

Examples 1. An pabgin mani amis. 2. An chapurbal tub amis.

‗I got the money from father.‘ ‗I got the vine from the jungle.‘

2) Nominalized adverbs with instrument and means suffixes
In general, both in Kuna and English an adverb modifies an action. For example, ―The boy pulled the nail out forcefully.‖ In Kuna, however, adverbs may also be used as instrument or means. This construction is

14.4 Grammar

187

formed by adding the nominalizing suffix -d81 to the long form of the adverb and adding the instrument or means suffix.
An adverbial instrument is formed with the suffix -gin/-kin. This instrument is used to describe the manner in which an action is carried out in a particular situation. For example, a child may forcefully grab a toy from his brother. He could have taken the toy gently, but he did not, he did it by force.

A general adverbial instrument or means is formed by using the suffix -bal/-pal attached to the nominalized long form of the adverb. This instrument is used to describe the manner in which an action must be done because of the situation. For example, a nail may be so firmly fixed in a board that it is necessary to use force in order to remove it. The nail cannot be removed in any other way.

Examples

1a. Machi kantik immal imas.

‗The boy did something forcefully (destructively).‘

b. Machi e urpagin kantikidgin eskoro amis. ‗The boy grabbed the nail by force from his younger brother.‘

c. Machi kantikidbal alamanai eskoro unkegal.82

‗The boy strived with (all his) might in order to pull out the nail.‘

2a. Machi pinna immal imas.

‗The boy did it gently/slowly.‘

b. Machi e urpagin pinnagwadgin eskoro amis. ‗The boy took the nail with care from his little brother.‘

c. An pinnagwadbal Pablobak chunmas, melle ‗I talked soothingly with Paul, so that he wouldn‘t be

ampak urwegal.

angry with me.‘

3a. Pedro otukal immal imas.

‗Peter did it secretly.‘

b. Pedro otukaledgin immal imas.

‗Peter did it by stealth.‘

c. Jaime otukaledbal immal aturchas.

‗Jim stole it with the utmost secrecy.‘

Exercise 24. Adverbs -gin/-kin and -bal/-pal drill
The student reads the sentence adding the necessary suffix (if any) in the indicated position.

Example Student: Nan kantik kolnai. Student: Pab tadgin akan amis.
1. Nan kantik____ kolnai. 2. Pab tad____ akan amis. 3. Sagla pe____ chunmas. 4. An sagla____ ibzhe. 5. Machi e urpa____ kantik____ eswal amis.
6. Pedro otukal____ nad. 7. Pedro chapur____ nagwal amis. 8. Puna, e nan____ ibzhe. 9. Antin pinna____ nanga chogo. 10. Wag otukal____ kallin aturchas.

‗Mother is calling loudly.‘ ‗Father got the axe from the elder.‘ ‗The chief talked about you.‘ ‗I believe what the chief says.‘ ‗The boy took the spear by force from his younger brother.‘ ‗Peter went secretly.‘ ‗Peter got the reeds in the jungle.‘ ‗The girl trusts her mother.‘ ‗I‘ll tell mother gently.‘ ‗The outsider stole the chicken with the utmost secrecy.‘

3) Object of trust
In Kuna, there is a distinction made between trusting or believing a person and trusting or believing what a person says.

81 See 18.4.1. 82 See 14.4.6 for purpose clauses.

188

Social Interaction

Examples

1. An pegin ibzhe.

‗I believe in you.‘

2. An Pab Tummadgin ibzhe.

‗I believe in God.‘

3. An pebal ibzhe.

‗I believe in what you say.‘

4. An Pab Tummadbal ibzhe.

‗I believe in what God has said.‘

Although the term ―to obey‖ sounds almost identical to ―to believe what (you) say‖, the construction is actually quite different.

Examples 1. An pe palli ibzhe. 2. An pebal ibzhe.

‗I obey you.‘ ‗I believe in what you say.‘

14.4.9 Speaking verbs (Ex. 25) There are four commonly used speaking verbs:

1. chog 2. chunma 3. ekis 4. kol

‗to say/tell‘ ‗to talk‘ ‗to ask‘ ‗to call (to)‘

14.4.9.1 Indirect object of speaking verbs
The indirect object (the person addressed) of each of the speaking verbs listed above uses different suffixes so that the specific suffix used with each speaking verb must be memorized:

1. ____-ga/-ka chog 2. ____-bak/-pak chunma 3. ____-zhe/-che/-je ekis 4. ____-zhe/-che/-je kol Examples
1a. Sagla anka chogzha. b. An pega chogo. 2a. An pabbak chunmas. b. Sagla ambak chunmane. 3a. An tadzhe ekichis. b. Pedro saglaje ekisbi. 4a. Ome punzhe kocha.83 b. An peje kolo.

‗to say to (someone)‘ ‗to talk with (someone)‘ ‗to ask of (someone)‘ ‗to call to (someone at a distance)‘
‗The chief told (said to) me.‘ ‗I‘ll tell (say to) you.‘ ‗I talked with father.‘ ‗The chief is going to talk with me.‘ ‗I asked the elder.‘ ‗Peter wants to ask the chief.‘ ‗The woman called (to) the girl.‘ ‗I‘ll call (to) you.‘

Exercise 25. Speaking verb indirect object selection drill
The teacher says the sentence and then selects another speaking verb and says it. The student repeats the sentence changing the verb and giving the correct form of the indirect object. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example

Teacher: An machiga chogzha. Teacher: chunmas Student: An machibak chunmas.

83 kol becomes kocha in the completed aspect.

‗I told the boy.‘ ‗I‘ll call you.‘ ‗The boy is going to ask the chief.‘ ‗The woman called the girl.‘ ‗Mother talked with auntie.‘

14.4.9.2 Subject matter of speaking verbs When the subject matter of a speaking verb85 involves a person or the things a person said, the specific or general instrument suffixes are used.

The specific instrument suffix -gin/-kin is attached to the pronoun or name of the person being talked about and around whom the conversation revolves.

Examples

1. Anmal pegin chunmas.

‗We talked about you.‘

2. Sagla nangin chunmas.

‗The chief talked about Mother.‘

3. María Silviagin chunmas.

‗Mary talked about Silvia.‘

The general instrument suffix -bal/-pal is used to refer to what a person talked about rather than talking about the person. The suffix is attached to the name or pronominal reference to the person.

Example Anmal pebal chunmas.

‗We talked about what you said.‘

Word order dictates that the subject matter of the conversation comes after the person spoken to and before the verb.

Examples

1. An saglabak pegin chunmas.

‗I talked to the chief about you.‘

2. An tummadga pebal chogzha.

‗I told the leader what you had said.‘

Some further examples may help to clarify the use of a person as an indirect object, as the topic of conversation or as the one who said something.

Examples The speaker reports the person to the chief, probably for allegedly bad behavior:

1a. An saglaga pe chogzha.

‗I told the chief on you.‘

The speaker tells the chief details about a person or the details about an incident involving a person:

b. An saglaga pegin chogzha. The speaker tells the chief what the person said:

‗I told the chief about you.‘

c. An saglaga pebal chogzha.
2a. An saglaje pe ekichis.

‗I told the chief what you said.‘
‗I asked the chief your whereabouts. (lit.: I asked the chief for you.)‘

84 The completed aspect of the verb kol ‗to call‘ is kocha. 85 See 14.4.7.

190

Social Interaction

b. An saglaje pegin ekichis. c. An saglaje pebal ekichis.

‗I asked the chief about you (in general, How are you?, etc.)‘
‗I asked the chief about what you said.‘

14.4.10 Direct speech
The clause with a verb of speaking, for example, ―He said,...,‖ almost always precedes the quotation (what is said).

Occasionally, the response to a question or proposal will precede the clause of speaking, as seen in the boy‘s response to the chief in the following example.

Example 1. Sagla machiga chogal: 2. --Pe negzhe nao. 3. --Nabir-- Nega chog. 4. --Pedrodin ampak nao.

‗The chief began to say to the boy,‘ ‗―Go home!‖‘ ‗―Fine!‖ the boy replied to him.‘ ‗―Peter will go with me.‖‘

14.4.11 Verbs of thinking
In Kuna, three different verbs are used which can be translated by the English verb, ―to think.‖ A difference is made between an opinion held, the process of thinking (cogitating) and surmise.

14.4.11.1 Opinion

The position/opinion of the speaker on a particular topic/situation is stated by using the habitual aspect of ―to think/say‖ followed by a direct or indirect quote, which is the stated position/opinion of the speaker.

Example Antin chog: ―Nabir.‖86

‗I think that is fine.‘

14.4.11.2 Process of thinking
The process of thinking is expressed by the verb pinzhe ‗to think (about)‘. The verb is preceded by the thought which is marked by the specific or general suffix -gin/-kin or -bal/-pal (see 14.4.8.1–4).

Example An nangin pinzheji.

‗I am just thinking about Mother.‘

14.4.11.3 Surmise
Surmise is expressed by the verb ebinzhe ‗to think/surmise‘. The content of the surmise is followed by the ebinzhe clause.

Example Pabdin pato Pukurgin omos, an ebinzhe.

‗I think Father would have already arrived in Pucuru (by now).‘

14.4.12 Exclusive noun suffix -bi/-pi (Ex. 26–27)
The use of the exclusive noun suffix -bi/-pi parallels the English construction ‗only (a certain thing)‘, such as found in the sentence, ―I eat only cooked plantains.‖ This exclusive construction is used only with the noun phrase and is achieved by adding -bi/-pi to the last word of the noun phrase, either a noun, an adjective, or a pronoun.

Examples 1. An chiglibi takcha. 2. Macherganbi ormanemal.

‗I saw only wild turkeys.‘ ‗Only the men are all going to the meeting.‘

86 Note that punctuation calls for no new paragraph for the content of a thought.

14.4 Grammar

191

3. Mol kinnidbi, an pei. 4. Yannu omemalbi an mecha. 5. Ampi koe takcha.

‗I want only red cloth.‘ ‗I killed only the wild sows.‘ ‗Only I saw the deer.‘

Exercise 26. Exclusive suffix -bi/-pi frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Chiglibi pukwa. Student: Chiglibi pukwa.
1. Chiglibi pukwa. 2. An nalu kinnidbi mecha. 3. Wagbi noni. 4. An palubi pakcha. 5. Macherganbi ormanemal.

‗Only wild turkeys are there.‘ ‗I killed only red macaw parrots.‘ ‗Only outsiders arrived.‘ ‗I bought only salt.‘ ‗Only the men are all going to meet.‘

Exercise 27. Exclusive suffix -bi/-pi drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it, using the exclusive suffix -bi/-pi form.

Example Teacher: Chigli pukwa. Student: Chiglibi pukwa.
1. Chigli pukwa. 2. Tule tupkin mai. 3. Machi nuzha ukcha. 4. Machi kan chobbi. 5. Wag kallin kumpi.

‗The wild turkeys are there.‘ ‗Kunas live on the island.‘ ‗The boy sold eggs.‘ ‗The boy wants to make stools.‘ ‗The outsider wants to eat chicken.‘

14.4.13 Exclusive action adverb unila ‘only’ (Ex. 28)
The exclusive action adverb unila ‗only‘ indicates that only the particular action mentioned in the sentence is carried out. The exclusive adverb is placed in the adverbial position in the sentence.

Example Antin unila murruk ebus. ‗I only/just touched the cup.‘ Contrast the above example with the following:

Example Antin murrukpi ebus.

‗I touched only/just the cup.‘

The first example illustrates the way the adverb excludes any other action. The person ―only touched‖ the cup, he did not move it or break it. The second example illustrates that it was ―only the cup‖ that was touched, not the saucer or the glass.

Exercise 28. Exclusive action versus exclusive noun phrase contrast drill
The teacher says the sentence and then says a word or phrase from the sentence, which is to be made exclusive. The student repeats the sentence adding the exclusive noun suffix -bi/-pi or the exclusive adverb unila ‗only‘ in the appropriate position. This exercise should be repeated as necessary.

Examples Teacher: An koe takcha.

Teacher: koe

Student: An koebi takcha.

Teacher: An koe takcha.

Teacher: takcha

Student: An unila koe takcha.

1. An koe takcha.

‗I saw a deer.‘

2. An chigli mecha.

‗I killed a wild turkey.‘

15 COMMANDS

15.1 Dialogue
The giving of orders and commands is important in every culture. Each culture has ―acceptable‖ ways to give a command, which may vary according to the situation or the relationship of the speaker to the listener.

1. Chief:

¡Machi, tag!

The boy comes to the chief.

‗Boy, come (here)!‘

2. Boy:

Ajáj.

3. Chief:

An pabbak chunmabi. Pabga chogo.

4. Boy:

Nabiri.

The boy goes off to find his father.

‗Yes.‘ ‗I want to talk to your father. (Go and) tell him.‘
‗Okay.‘

5. Boy:

Sagla chog: ―Tago.‖ Pebak chunmabijog.

‗The chief says to come. He wants to talk to you.‘

6. Father:

Ajáj.

‗Oh.‘

The father was holding a small child and puts him down. The mother speaks to the child.

7. Mother:

¡Nen!88

‗Come! (baby talk)‘

The child ignores the mother.

8. Mother:

¡Tage!

The child goes to the mother.

‗Come! (exasperated)‘

9. Father:

Sagla taknegwel.

‗(I‘m) going to go see the chief a minute.‘

10. Mother:

Eye.

‗Yes.‘

The father goes to see the chief. After formalities are exchanged, the conversation continues.

11. Chief:

Nabirde. An pei, pe wis an pentako. Anka ul tummad wis ololchao, itos.

12. Father:

¿Inkwa pe pei?

13. Chief:

Pan, wakur.

14. Father:

Nabiri.

15. Chief:

Ajáj.

The conversation proceeds to other topics.

‗Okay. I would like you to help me. Please lend me (your) big canoe.‘
‗When do you want (it)?‘ ‗Tomorrow morning.‘ ‗That‘s fine.‘ ‗Good.‘

15.2 Pronunciation

15.2.1 Intonation of commands (Ex.1–2)
The intonation pattern of commands is closely related to the emotional climate of the situation and to the force with which the speaker wishes to deliver the command. The more ―strong‖ the command, the more harsh and strident the intonation becomes.

88 nen ‗come‘ is a command form of the motion verb ne ‗to go‘ and is used only with young children. 193

194

Commands

Exercise 1. Intonation drill
Dramatize Dialogue 15 with the student playing different roles.
Exercise 2. Problem solving drill
Discuss and drill any problems encountered in Exercises 1 and 2 above.

15.2.2 Intonation of a sentence containing the reported speech suffix -chog/-zhog/-jog
In considering the intonation pattern of sentences using the reported speech suffix -chog/-zhog/-jog, it is important to note that the suffix is attached to the quote without any pause or break in the utterance. For example, note Sentence 5 in Dialogue 15.1.

15.3 Culture
The force with which you give a command in Kuna varies according to the relative status of the speaker to the hearer. This, in turn, is dependent on such criteria as age (elder to younger, younger to elder), social status (chief to one of his people, one of the people to their chief), and the respect the speaker owes the hearer. If you are in a position where you must give a command, and you are in doubt as to the force of command, you may politely use, it is best to use a polite, less forceful form.

15.4 Grammar

15.4.1 Commands: Direct/Polite (Ex. 3–21) As it has already been expressed, commands or requests vary in force. The relative force of the command is not only conveyed by intonation, as seen in Section B, but is also expressed by the grammatical structure chosen.
There are three degrees of forcefulness in Kuna commands: 1) polite command, 2) strong command, and 3) very polite command.
The three degrees of commands may be expressed in singular form or group form and each may be positive or negative.

15.4.1.1 Polite commands
Polite commands in Kuna are used when the speaker is directing an order to someone of equal status or where the difference in status is overlooked to assure compliance with the command. The polite form is also used when a situation is not urgent. It is the most common command form in Kuna and parallels the Spanish/English command, Hágame el favor de... ‗Please ...‘.

1) Verb form of a polite command
The polite command is formed by adding the suffix -o to the verb stem.89

Examples 1. Anka uko. 2. Anche tago.

‗Please give it to me.‘ ‗Please come to me.‘

2) Additional information in a polite command
Additional information, such as a phrase to clarify the purpose of an action or goal of a motion, is mandatory90 in a polite command. Or, a polite command may include a direct object, indirect object, or some other phrase. The subject is rarely stated. Word order of a polite command follows normal pattern; that is to say, the additional information always precedes the verb.

89 Although the verb of the polite command is the same as the verb form with the future aspect, the two meanings may generally be distinguished because no subject occurs in the polite command. 90 Very occasionally, no additional information is used with a polite command and the verb is used alone.

15.4.1.2 Strong commands
Strong commands in Kuna are used when the speaker is giving a command to someone of lower status or age than himself. In the case of a strong command, the speaker has the right to expect the hearer to comply with the command because of the relationship between the two parties. The strong command is also used in situations of anger, frustration or emergency when protocol tends to be brushed aside, due to the emotion of the moment.
Strong commands are formed by using one of two verb forms. Additional information (other than the verb) that is included in the command, varies according to the situation. When a command must be repeated, a repeated command suffix -ma is added to the verb.

1) Verb form in strong command
The short or the long form of a verb stem may be used in a strong command.

a) Short form of verb stem in strong command The short verb stem may be used as a strong command.

Examples 1. ¡Ne! 2. ¡Tag! 3. ¡Kun!

‗Go!‘ ‗Come!‘ ‗Eat!‘

b) Long form of the verb stem in a strong command
The long form of a verb stem may also be used in a strong command. The two forms are used interchangeably; however, the long form is preferred in situations where the speaker is:

1. Angry or exasperated. 2. Repeating the command because of non-compliance. 3. Some distance away from the person he/she is addressing.

Examples

1. ¡Ne!91

‗Go!‘

2. ¡Tage!

‗Come!‘

3. ¡Kunne! ‗Eat!‘

Note the situations in the following examples:

91 ne is a contracted form of nee which rarely, if ever, occurs in isolation.

15.4 Grammar

197

Examples A mother speaks angrily to her child.

1. ¡Tage!

‗Co-o-o-ome!‘

A father speaks to his child.

2a. ¡Tag!

‗Come!‘

The child makes no move to comply with the command, so the father speaks again.

b. ¡Tage!

‗Co-o-o-ome!‘

The chief calls to a boy in the distance.

3. Machi, ¡Tage!

‗(Hey) Boy, come!‘

2) Additional information included in a strong command
In contrast to the polite command, a strong command is usually comprised of only a verb. It keeps additional elements to a minimum. Additional information may be used to intensify the command or to clarify a certain aspect of the command.

a) Intensification of strong command
When a speaker wishes to make a certain aspect of command more forceful, that aspect is added to the command in the normal word order. That is to say, it precedes the verb. When the subject of the command is made more forceful, the vocative92 form is used. It may be either the long or short form.

Examples 1. ¡Machi, tage! 2. Negzhe ne. 3. Machi, negzhe ne.

‗Boy, come!‘ ‗Go home.‘ ‗Boy, go home.‘

b) Clarification in strong command
Should a certain aspect of the command be ambiguous in a situation, the ambiguity may be clarified by stating the aspect in a postpredicate position after the verb (see 17.4.1).

Examples 1. ¡Ne, negzhe! 2. ¡Tage, machi! 3. ¡Cheddago, ina!

‗Go home!‘ ‗Come, boy/son!‘ ‗Bring it, the medicine!‘

Exercise 7. Strong command frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

7. ¡Meg! 8. ¡Kueye!

‗Lie down!‘ ‗(To a dog) Shoo! Scat! (lit.: quickly).‘

c) Repeated command suffix -ma93
When a speaker realizes that a strong command he has given is not heeded, he may repeat the identical command adding the repeated command suffix -ma to the verb for emphasis. The repeated command suffix -ma parallels the English phrase, ―I told you to ...!‖

Examples Mother speaks to her child.

1. ¡Kwisku!

‗Stand up!‘

The child does not respond and the mother speaks again.

2. ¡Kwiskuma!

‗(I told you to) stand up!‘

Exercise 10. Repeated command suffix -ma frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: ¡Kwiskuma!

Student: ¡Kwiskuma!

1. ¡Kwiskuma!

‗Stand up, I said!‘

2. ¡Mellema!

‗Don‘t (do it), I said!‘

3. ¡Kobma!

‗Drink it, I said!‘

4. ¡Chuma!

‗Take it, I said!‘

5. ¡Chogma!

‗Tell (me), I said!‘

Exercise 11. Stimulus response drill with repeated command suffix -ma
The teacher selects and gives a command from the list below and the student rephrases the command using the -ma form.

Example Teacher: ¡Kwisku!

Student: ¡Kwiskuma!

1. ¡Kwisku! ‗Stand up!‘

2. ¡Kob!

‗Drink!‘

3. ¡Chu!

‗Fetch (it)!‘

4. ¡Chog!

‗Say (it)!‘

5. ¡Kun!

‗Eat!‘

6. ¡Chig!

‗Sit down!‘

d) Respectful form of strong commands
A respectful attitude can be maintained when using a strong command form by adding the suffix -ra to the long form of the strong command (long form of the verb stem).

Example ¡Togera!

‗Do come in!‘

93 -ma is an intensifier suffix and may be added to the end of other verb forms (following all other suffixes) to intensify the action. Experience will help you to understand situations in which the suffix -ma is appropriate. It is not a common suffix.

200

Commands

15.4.1.3 Very polite commands
A very polite command in Kuna is an even more polite form than the polite command. The speaker still expects the action to be carried out, but phrases the command in a most courteous, tactful, polite manner. The very polite command also tends to be used to coax a friend into doing something.

1) Verb form of a very polite command
A very polite command may be formed in one of three ways:

a) Insert the suffix -gwel/-kwel between the verb stem and the future aspect suffix -o of the polite command form. No subject is used. In the case of the verb ne ‗to go‘, the request command form is negwelo, that is to say, the polite command form of the verb, nao, is not used in this construction.

Examples

1. An pentakkwelo.

‗I would like you to be so kind as to help me.‘

2. Anche taggwelo.

‗I would like you to be so kind as to come to me.‘

b) Use the future aspect form of the verb preceded by the word wis ‗a little‘. In this case (as in future statements), the subject is included. The intonation pattern of a command is used.

Example Pe wis an pentako.

‗I would like you to be so kind as to help me.‘

c) Use both the word wis ‗a little‘ and the suffix -gwel/-kwel with the future aspect of the verb. That is to say, wis precedes the verb and the suffix -gwel/-kwel is inserted before the future aspect suffix -o in the verb. The subject is included.

Example Pe wis an pentakkwelo.

‗I would like you to be so kind as to help me.‘

2) Additional information stated in the request
As stated above, a subject must be used when the word wis ‗a little‘ is used in the request command. The subject precedes wis and the rest of the very polite command follows normal word order. Wis can be repeated before the verb to make the request very polite: vocative + subject + wis + indirect object + direct object + verb ( + -gwel/-kwel) ( + -o).

Example Pedro, pe wis anka ina (wis) ukkwelo.

‗Peter, I would like it if you would give me the medicine.‘

3) Questioning request
When the speaker is not sure whether or not the listener can meet a request, he uses a questioning request. This construction is formed by using the word wis ‗a little‘ with the suffix -ji following the future suffix. A question intonation pattern is used (see 3.2.3). The use of -ji expects a positive (yes) answer.

Example ¿An wis pentakoji?

‗Would you be so kind as to help me?‘

Exercise 12. wis very polite command frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Pedro, pe wis an pentako.

Student: Pedro, pe wis an pentako.

1. Pedro, pe wis an pentako.

‗Peter, I would like you to please help me.‘

2. Nestor, pe wis negzhe nao.

‗Nestor, I would like you to please go home.‘

3. Amma, pe wis nanbak nao.

‗Aunt, I would like you to please go with Mother.‘

4. Luis, pe wis anche tago.

‗Louis, I would like you to please come to me.‘

Example Teacher: Pedro, pe wis an pentakkwelo.

Student: Pedro, pe wis an pentakkwelo.

1. Pedro, pe wis an pentakkwelo.

‗Peter, I would like you to please help me.‘

2. Nestor, pe wis negzhe negwelo.

‗Nestor, I would like you to please go home.‘

3. Amma, pe wis nanbak negwelo.

4. Luis, pe wis anche taggwelo.

‗Louis, I would like you to please come to me.‘

5. María, pe wis anka tub ukgwelo.

‗Mary, I would like you to please give me some thread.‘

Exercise 15. Command selection drill
The teacher selects and says a situation from those listed below. The student replies, selecting the correct command form of the verb tag ‗to come‘.

Example Teacher: You want a child some distance away to come. Student: ¡Tage!
1. You want a child some distance away to come. 2. You want the chief to come over to you. 3. You want a friend to come. 4. You want someone to come urgently. 5. You want to coax a reluctant friend to come.

15.4.1.4 Indirect command
The word meke ‗to let/allow‘ is used in an indirect command that parallels the English construction, ―Let him/her/it do ____‖ or ―Allow him/her/it to do ____.‖ Meke ‗to let/allow‘ follows a vocative (if used) and comes at the beginning of a direct command construction to form an indirect command.

Examples 1. Pedro, meke chi. 2. Puna, meke (machi) tago.

‗Peter, leave it (alone).‘ ‗Daughter, let (the boy) come.‘

Exercise 16. Indirect command drill
The teacher says the command and the student replies, using the meke form as in the frame.

Example

Teacher: Tago. Student: Meke machi tago.

202

3. Nao.

‗Please go.‘

4. An wis pentako. ‗Would (you) please help me.‘

5. Chig.

‗Sit down.‘

15.4.1.5 Commands to groups Any of the three types of commands may be used to direct one or more people. Generally speaking, it is not necessary to use the group suffix, in spite of the fact that you are speaking to a group. If, however, the group is to act as a unit, then the suffix -mal must be attached to the verb.
There are three types of situations which determine the form of the command used when you speak to a group.

1) Command form when each group marker acts as an individual.
If the speaker is addressing a command to a group of people and he expects each person to act as an individual, he uses a command form with no group suffix. Strong, polite and request commands may be used in this way.

Examples Strong command
1. ¡Ne! Polite command
2. ¡Nao! Request command
3. ¡Negwelo!

‗(Each one of you) go!‘ ‗(Each one of you) please go!‘ ‗(Each one of you) be so kind as to go!‘

2) Exclusive command form
If the speaker is addressing a command to a group of people and he expects the group to act as a unit, but does not expect to do the command himself, -mal is attached to both the vocative and the verb. The vocative is said with the same intonation pattern and is followed by a brief pause, just as the vocative in statements (see 10.4.6).

Examples 1. ¡Pemal, negzhe nemal! 2. Pemal, anche tagmalo. 3. Pemal, wis negwelmalo. 4. Pemal, wis negzhe nemalo.

‗(You all) go home!‘ ‗(You all) please come to me.‘ ‗(You all) (would you be so kind as to) go.‘ ‗(You all) (would you be so kind as to) go home.‘

3) Inclusive (hortatory) command form

If the speaker is addressing a command to a group of people whom he expects to act as a unit, and he includes himself in the action to be done, the suffix -mal is added to the verb. The subject is not stated. The polite command is the preferred form for inclusive or hortatory commands, although the strong command form does occur.

Examples 1. ¡Nemal! 2. Nemalo. 3. Wis negwelmalo.

‗Let‘s go!‘ ‗Please, let‘s go.‘ ‗I would like you to be so kind as to go (with me).‘

15.4 Grammar

203

Exercise 17. Exclusive strong command frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: ¡Pemal, negzhe nemal!

1. ¡Pemal, negzhe nemal!

‗You (all), go home!‘

2. ¡Pemal, saglaga chogmal!

‗You (all), tell the chief!‘

3. ¡Pemal, ormanegzhe chedmal! ‗You (all), take (them) to the meeting house!‘

4. ¡Pemal, aknirmal!

‗You (all), move back!‘

5. ¡Pemal, saglaga itomal!

‗You (all), listen to the chief!‘

Exercise 18. Inclusive strong command form
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: ¡Nemal! Student: ¡Nemal!
1. ¡Nemal! 2. ¡Aknirmal! 3. ¡Saglaga itomal! 4. ¡Ormaked negzhe chedmal! 5. ¡Neg elimal!

‗Let‘s go!‘ ‗Let‘s get out of the way!‘ ‗Let‘s listen to the chief!‘ ‗Let‘s take (them) to the meeting house!‘ ‗Let‘s clean the town!‘

Exercise 19. Inclusive polite command frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Nemalo.

Student: Nemalo.

1. Nemalo.

‗Let‘s go.‘

2. Aptamalo.

3. Arbamalo.

‗Let‘s work.‘

4. Itomalo.

‗Let‘s listen.‘

5. Aknirmalo.

‗Let‘s get out of the way.‘

15.4.1.6 Negative commands
In Kuna, negative commands are given by either the use of a negative command word or by using melle ‗don‘t‘ before any command form.

1) Negative command words
There are several words in Kuna which may be used in isolation and which are strong negative commands. These negative command words are used in the same situations as their English/Spanish counterparts.

Examples 1. ¡Melle! 2. ¡Mellema! 3. ¡Kusma! 4. ¡Ogus!

‗Don‘t!‘ ‗Don‘t, I said!‘ ‗Stop it!‘ ‗That‘s enough!‘

2) Negative commands
Any command may be made negative by placing the word melle ‗don‘t‘ before the command.

204

15.4.2 Negatives (Ex. 22–30)
The basic and most common negative word in Kuna is chul/chuli ‗no‘ (see 3.4.1.). This word may also be used as a negative suffix -chul/-zhul/-jul94 attached to certain words, phrases or sentences. There are also other negative words which are used in certain situations.

15.4.2.1 Basic negative word chuli „no‟ The basic negative word chuli/chul ‗no‘ may be used alone as a negative exclamation, or it may be used within a sentence. Chuli/chul ‗no‘ is used to respond negatively to a question asked, or a statement made to negate a fact or action mentioned in the/a previous sentence, or to negate a certain adverb or adjective used in a/the previous sentence.

When used alone, the basic negative word chuli ‗no‘ may occur in one of three forms:
a) Chul ‗no‘ Chul ‗no‘ is the most common form of the basic negative word. It is used in response to a question which requires a negative answer. In other words, it is used to deny that the action in the question is going to take place.

94 -chul follows fortis consonants, -zhul follows lenis consonants, and -jul follows vowels.

205

Examples 1. ¿Pe ne? 2. Chul.

‗Are you going?‘ ‗No.‘

b) Chuli ‗no‘
Chuli ‗no‘ is a more emphatic form of the basic negative word and is used as a more emphatic denial in response to the same situations for which you would reply with chul ‗no‘.

Examples 1. ¿Pedro Pucurche ne? 2. ¡Chuli!

‗Is Peter going to Pucuro?‘ ‗No!‘

c) Chula ‗no‘
Chula ‗no‘ is a very rare form of the basic negative word. It is used in reference to an action of the past and parallels the English construction, ―never, not a chance.‖ It is often used as a response to consistent teasing or persistent accusation and gives the response the flavor of ―not only is that not true, it never was true either!‖

Examples 1. ¡An akande, pedin tar chus! 2. ¡Chula!

‗You took my axe!‘ ‗No (I did nothing of the kind)!‘

2) Basic negative word used in a sentence
Any form of the basic negative word chul/chuli/chula ‗no‘ may be used in a sentence to deny that an adverb or adjective used in the/a previous sentence is valid. In this construction, the sentence is reiterated. The subject must be emphasized by the addition of the topic marking suffix -din/-tin or by the use of the demonstrative adjective we ‗that‘. A form of the word chul/chuli/chula is used at the end of the sentence to negate the adjective/adverb.

Examples 1. Uade, totó. 2. Uadin, toto chul.95 or We ua, toto chul.

‗The fish is small.‘ ‗The fish is not small.‘
‗That fish is not small.‘

Exercise 22. Chul ‗no‘ denial stimulus-response drill
The teacher selects a sentence and says it. The student replies denying the statement.

Examples Teacher: Uade, totó.

Student: Uadin, toto chul.

1. Uade, totó.

‗That fish is small.‘

2. Molde, muis.

‗That cloth is cheap.‘

3. Manide, unni.

‗That money is enough.‘

4. Akande, nued.

‗That axe is good.‘

5. Ulde, tummad.

‗That canoe is big.‘

15.4.2.2 Basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i)
The basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhuli/-jul(i) may be added to certain words in order to negate the word itself or it may be used to negate an entire sentence.

95 This construction is the negation of the adjective and does not carry the antithetic connotation of the suffixed word (see 9.4.2.3).

206

Commands

1) Basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) „no‟ negating a word
As discussed in Section 9.4.2, the negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) may be used to negate specific words such as adjectives or adverbs. The basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) is added to an adjective to give a negative answer to a question, to intensify antithesis or to provide an antonym for an adjective which does not have an antonym.

Examples 1. totojuli 2. kakpijuli 3. tikalbal becomes tikajul

‗not small (emphatic: large)‘ ‗not at all bitter (sweet)‘ ‗nearby‘
‗not near (far)‘

2) Basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) „no‟ negating a sentence
A Kuna sentence is negated by adding the basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) ‗no‘ to the verb.96 The long form has a more emphatic connotation than the short. The suffix is attached to the verb stem or immediately following the aspect suffix, for example, the desiderative suffix -bi/-pi (see 2.4.2.1).

Examples 1. An immal pakchul. 2. An mol peichuli.97 3. An mol peichul. 4. An nan takchajul. 5. Anmal yannu gwen takchajulmal. 6. An nebijul.

‗I did not buy a thing.‘ ‗I do not want cloth.‘ ‗I do not want cloth.‘ ‗I did not see Mother.‘ ‗We did not see a single peccary.‘ ‗I don’t want to go.‘

Exercise 23. -chul/-zhul/-jul negation of sentence frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise is repeated several times.

Example Teacher: An nejul. Student: An nejul.
1. An nejul. 2. An mas kuchajul. 3. An mol pakchajul. 4. An tub peichul. 5. An nebijul.

‗I am not going to go.‘ ‗I didn‘t eat (any) food.‘ ‗I didn‘t buy cloth.‘ ‗I don‘t want thread.‘ ‗I don‘t want to go.‘

Exercise 24. -chul/-zhul/-jul negation of sentence stimulus response drill
The teacher selects a sentence from those listed below. The student responds by giving the negative form of the sentence.

Example Teacher: An ne. Student: An nejul.
1. An ne. 2. Machi ua chwas. 3. Tad es pakpi.

‗I‘m going to go.‘ ‗The boy caught a fish.‘ ‗The elder wants to buy a machete.‘

96 After the dipthongs ai, ei, and oi, -chul(i) occurs rather than -jul(i). In fact, the -ch form of any suffix having an alternate beginning in ch would occur after these diphthongs. 97 The verb stem pei ‗to want to have (something)‘ expresses a desiderative state (see 2.4.2.2).

15.4 Grammar

207

4. An mani pei.

‗I want money.‘

5. An karpa chobcha.

‗I made a basket.‘

Note that s + ch/j = ch, for example, chwas + -jul = chwachul.

15.4.2.3 Other negative words Several other words used in a sentence give the sentence a negative meaning.

1) Negative command melle „don‟t‟
The negative command melle ‗don‘t‘ is discussed in Section 15.4.1.6.

2) Negative desiderative action yapa „don‟t want to‟
As has been mentioned (see 15.4.2.2.2, Example 6), a desiderative action may be negated by adding the basic negative suffix -chul/-zhul/-jul to the verb. The desiderative action may also be negated by use of an adverb yapa ‗don‘t want to‘ in the adverbial position after the subject and before the object, if there is one. The adverb yapa ‗don‘t want to‘ has a stronger negative connotation than does the desiderative action suffix -bi/-pi and -chul/-jul.

Example An yapa mol pak.

‗I don‘t want to buy cloth.‘

Exercise 25. Yapa negative desiderative action frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: An yapa ne. Student: An yapa ne.
1. An yapa ne. 2. An yapa mantur kun. 3. An yapa mol pak. 4. An yapa ina kop. 5. An yapa wartiku.

‗I don‘t want to go.‘ ‗I don‘t want to eat roasted plantain.‘ ‗I don‘t want to buy cloth.‘ ‗I don‘t want to take (drink) the medicine.‘ ‗I don‘t want to get wet.‘

Exercise 26. Yapa negative desiderative action stimulus response drill
The teacher selects a sentence and says it. The student responds using the negative form with yapa.

Example Teacher: An nebi. Student: An yapa ne.
1. An nebi. 2. An ua kumpi. 3. An saglabak chunmabi. 4. An ul nudabi. 5. An chagla chikpi.

‗I want to go.‘ ‗I want to eat fish.‘ ‗I want to talk to the chief.‘ ‗I want to repair the canoe.‘ ‗I want to have my hair cut.‘

3) Negative adverb yo „not yet‟
The negative adverb yo ‗not yet‘ or ‗before he/she/it (had) ...‘ is used as an adverb in a subordinate sentence. Yo ‗not yet‘ is when the action in the independent sentence precedes that of the subordinate sentence. That is to say, Kuna negates an action by using yo ‗not yet‘ to indicate the concept that before something happened, the action in the independent sentence took place.
Example An yo nadgu, an mas kucha. ‗Before I left, I ate (some) food.‘
Exercise 27. Yo ‗not yet‘ stimulus response drill
The teacher gives the sentence. The student responds using the yo form of the subordinate sentence.

208

Commands

Example Teacher: Machi nadgu an mas kucha.

Student: Machi yo nadgu an mas kucha.

1. Machi nadgu an mas kucha.

‗When the boy left, I ate (some) food.‘

2. Pun mol pakchagu an nad.

‗When the girl bought cloth, I left.‘

3. Kukualed nonigu machi pistabal arpi.

4. An tian omosgu an yannu takcha.

‗When I reached the stream, I saw the peccaries.‘

5. An nadel an mol pako.

‗When I leave, I will buy cloth.‘

4) Negative adverb ampa „still‟
The adverb ampa ‗still‘ may be used to compound with the adverb yo ‗not yet‘ to form the negative expression ampayo ‗still not‘. It may also be used in conjunction with the word owed ‗away/delayed‘ to form the negative expression ampa owed ‗still delayed‘. Ampayo and ampa owed may be used to indicate that an action has still not happened. It may be used in answer to the question, ―Are you ready?‖

Examples 1. Andin ampayo mas kun. 2a. ¿Pedin pato ogus? b. Ampayo. 3a. ¿Pabde mai? b. Ampa owed.

‗I still have not eaten.‘ ‗Are you all ready?‘ ‗Not yet.‘ ‗Is father home?‘ ‗He is still delayed.‘

Exercise 28. Ampayo ‗not yet‘ negative adverb stimulus response drill
The teacher selects a question and asks it. The student replies using the ampayo ‗not yet‘ negative adverb.

16.2 Pronunciation (Ex. 1–4)
As you do the following exercises, concentrate on using correct intonation patterns. You will find that your audience will really appreciate hearing all the details of any trip you make, no matter how brief the trip was. Retelling the events of even a short jaunt into the jungle will provide excellent language practice. Work hard on the intonation patterns in the following exercises so that you will be able to recount your trips in traditional Kuna style. Your audience will be thrilled.
Exercise 1. Tracking
Track the teacher and his assistant (if available) as they say Dialogue 16.1. Concentrate on the overall intonation patterns of the entire speech and responses.
Exercise 2. Dialogue dramatization
Dramatize Dialogue 16.1 with two students playing the roles of Traveler and Villager.
Exercise 3. Problem solving exercise
Discuss and drill any problems encountered in Exercise 2 above.
Exercise 4. Tracking
Listen to tapes of travel stories and track them, in order to thoroughly master the intonation patterns.

16.3 Culture
Kunas divide the pirka ‗year‘ into two seasons: yol(a) ‗dry season/summer‘ and tigin ‗wet/rainy season‘. It may also be divided into twelve months, each of which has a name:

ni wilub 1. Yol ni 2. Arri ni 3. Neg kummaked ni 4. Ob maked ni 5. Nus maked ni 6. Mazhal ni keped 7. Mazhal ni chobalid 8. Chua ni 9. Tulgab ni 10. Kig ni 11. Ina ni 12. Yol omojad ni The phases of the moon are:

‘calendar’ ‗January (lit.: sunny moon)‘ ‗February (lit.: iguana moon)‘ ‗March (lit.: burning field moon)‘ ‗April (lit.: corn planting moon)‘ ‗May (lit.: caterpiller-laden moon)‘ ‗June (lit.: first white cane moon)‘ ‗July (lit.: latter white cane moon)‘ ‗August (lit.: fruit moon)‘ ‗September (lit.: tree with light yellow flower moon)‘ ‗October (lit.: a species of vine with a white flower moon)‘ ‗November (lit.: tree with red flower moon)‘ ‗December (lit.: summer-has-arrived moon)‘

Retelling Detailed Accounts

1. ni toto

‗new moon‘

2. ni yoroku

‗first quarter‘

3. ni tarno

‗full moon‘

4. ni yoroku tenal tarnochik ‗last quarter‘

These phases are carefully noted because they affect the timing of certain activities, for example, insect damage to thatch yet to be gathered is more extensive when the moon is full, so thatch tends to be gathered at times other than full moon.

The only day of the week to have a special name is tummi ‗Sunday‘.

Spanish influence has resulted in the use of Kuna names for the following national holidays:

1. Pab purkwijad ibe 2. Pab mimmilejad ibe 3. Yol aktejid

‗Good Friday (lit.: the day of God‘s death)‘ ‗Christmas (lit.: the days of God‘s birth)‘ ‗New Year (lit.: the falling of summer)‘

16.4 Grammar

16.4.1 Motion verbs (Ex. 5–13)
One of the most useful sets of verbs in any language is the motion verbs. Two aspects important to the discussion of motion verbs are the reference point and the scope of the movement. Reference point will be discussed as it relates to the motion verbs ne ‗to go‘ and tag ‗to come‘. Other motion verbs are described as directional and non-directional verbs in the discussion of scope of the movement.

16.4.1.1 Reference point of motion Motion verbs deal with leaving one location and approaching another. Ne ‗to go‘ implies that a location is left, and tag ‗to come‘ implies that a location is being approached. The location referred to by the motion verb is the reference point of motion.
In certain circumstances, the Kuna view of the reference point is different from the English view. The Kuna viewpoint varies from being used in conversation to being used in narration.

1) Reference point of speaker in conversation
In discussing the Kuna view of the reference point, it is important to be aware of two types of use in conversation. This use may involve motion on the part of one of the speakers, or it may involve motion of a third party.

a) Conversation involving motion of one of the speakers
In conversation, if one of the speakers is involved in the motion being discussed, the speaker must always adopt his present location as the reference point. He views the motion as either approaching or departing from his present location. The original speaker‘s location is his reference point, and the replying speaker‘s location is his reference point.

As in English, when the motion is moving away from both speakers, they use a form of the verb ne ‗to go‘. Following are some examples of present situations:

Example

Speaker 1 wants Speaker 2 to come to him.

1. ¡Tage! 2. Eye. Natab.

‗Come!‘ ‗Okay. I am coming (lit.: I am going.).‘100

100 Some of the English translations of the situations are awkward due to the fact that the English concept of reference point in that situation is different from the Kuna one.

In the light of his own (Speaker 1) location, he sees the motion as approaching his reference point (Speaker 1‘s location). He, therefore, uses a form of the motion verb tag ‗to come‘. Speaker 2, on the other hand, perceives the motion in light of his own reference point (location), and sees the motion as leaving or going from the reference point. Speaker 2, therefore, responds with a form of the verb ne ‗to go‘.

Example

Speaker 1 wants to go to Speaker 2.

1. Apta. An peje natab.

‗Wait. I‘m going to you.‘

2. Tago, tegil.

‗Come then.‘

In this situation, Speaker 1 views the motion as leaving his reference point and uses a form of the verb ne ‗to go‘. Speaker 2, on the other hand, views the motion as approaching his reference point and uses a form of the verb tag ‗to come‘.

Example

Speaker 1 wants Speaker 2 to go to Location X.

1. Pe nao.

‗Go away.‘

2. Eye, an natab.

‗Okay, I am going.‘

In this situation, both Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 view the direction of motion as being away from their own reference point. In this case, both Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 use a form of the motion verb ne ‗to go‘.

Following are some examples of future situations:

Example

In his own house, Speaker 1 asks Speaker 2 to come again the next day.

1. Pan, pe tagbalo. ‗Tomorrow, come again.‘

2. An tanibal.

‗I‘ll come again.‘

In this situation, Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 both view the future motion as approaching his present location and both speakers use a form of the motion verb tag/tani ‗to come‘.

Example

At Speaker 2‘s house, Speaker 1 asks Speaker 2 to come to his (Speaker 1) house the following day.

1. Pe pan anche nao.

‗Tomorrow go to me.‘

2. Eye, peje ne tegil.

‗Yes, I will go to you then.‘

In this situation, both Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 view the future motion as moving away from their present location. Both Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 use a form of the verb ne ‗to go‘.

Example

At the house of Speaker 1 or Speaker 2, Speaker 1 asks Speaker 2 to go to Location X.

1. Pe pan saglaje nao.

‗Tomorrow go to the chief.‘

2. Nabir. An pan ne tegil.

‗Okay. Tomorrow I‘ll go then.‘

Again, in this situation Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 view the motion as being away from their present position and use a form of the verb ne ‗to go‘.

b) Conversation involving motion of a third party
A third party may be discussed in conversation. In the case of the third party, either leaving or approaching one of the speakers, the speaker adopts his own reference point as the reference point of motion. The case of the third party going to a location other than one of the speakers‘ locations, is considered a third person narrative and is discussed in section 16.4.1.1 in 2. of this lesson. Following is an example of motion involving a third party:

Example

Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 are talking (from a distance) and a person approaches Speaker 1.

1. Carlos anche tani.

‗Charles is coming to me.‘

2. Eye, peje natap.

‗Yes, (he) is going to you.‘

Example

Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 are talking (from a distance) and a person approaches Speaker 2.

1. Carlos peje ne.

‗Charles is going to you.‘

2. Eye, anche tani.

‗Yes, (he) is coming to me.‘

If, on the other hand, the person is approaching the location where Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 are (standing), both Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 use a form of the verb ―to come‖. This is similar to the English construction.

Example

Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 are talking and a person approaches the general location where Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 are (standing).

1. Carlos anmalzhe tani.

‗Charles is coming toward us.‘

2. Eye, anmalzhe tani.

‗Yes, (he) is coming toward us.‘

2) Reference point in narrative
The perception of reference point of motion in the case of a narrative is somewhat different from the reference point in conversation. The material presented in the narrative may involve relating a tale from the past or predicting an event in the future.
For purposes of this discussion, a narrative may be considered to be composed of various parts, much like the scenes of a play. There is an introduction, then various scenes, and finally, a conclusion.
In discussing the view of reference point of motion in narrative, it is important to consider both third and first person narrative.

a) Reference point in first person narrative
In the case of a first person narrative, as with English and Spanish, the reference point of the introduction and conclusion are always the present location of the speaker. However, as in English/Spanish, but differing from the situation of a Kuna conversation in which the reference point is fixed, the reference point of the various scenes in the play vary according to the speaker‘s choice. They are not necessarily influenced by the speaker‘s present position. He may choose a reference point of the intermediate scenes according to the scene he wishes to highlight. Following are some situational examples:
Example
Speaker 1 is in the city, telling of his trip from the village.
While narrating the story of his trip, Speaker 1 views the introduction and conclusion of the narration in light of his present location and, therefore, refers to having left from the village and come to the city (his present location).
The reference point of the motion verbs in the other scenes reflects the speaker‘s interpretation of events which happened along the way. He may, for example, choose as a reference point Dog River. Speaker 1 may talk about leaving or approaching Dog River. The reference point within the scenes of the story are not related to the speaker‘s present position, but vary according to his choice of reference point.
Example
Speaker 1 is back in the village telling of a trip he made to the city.
Again, as with English and Spanish, the reference point of motion of the introduction and conclusion is related to the present location of the speaker. The reference points of the intermediate scenes are determined by the choice of the speaker.

b) Reference point of third person narrative
In the case of third person narrative (the speaker is not involved in the motion), the reference point for the introduction, conclusion and intermediate scenes of the narrative may be the present location of the third party or it may be another location which the speaker considers to be the reference point of the scene.

16.4 Grammar

217

It should be noted that in the case of a conversation in which the speakers are talking about a third party,101 the situation is basically a third person narrative in which the speaker is not involved in the motion. In this case, the speaker chooses the location of the third party at the time of the beginning of the motion as the reference point.

Example

Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 are talking about a person moving to Location X.

1. Carlos X-che ne.

‗Charles is going to X.‘

2. Eye, Carlos X-che ne.

‗Yes, Charles is going to X.‘

As in English and Spanish, the reference point of motion of Charles is considered by Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 to be Charles‘ present location. Speaker 1‘s form of the verb ne ‗to go‘ is used to indicate that Charles is departing from the reference point.

16.4.1.2 Forms of ne ‘to go’ and tag ‘to come’

16.4.1.3 Scope of movement It is helpful to divide the motion involved in a roundtrip journey into stages or phases:
Phase 1 - departure from a point of origin Phase 2 - movement from point of origin towards a destination Phase 3 - arrival at the destination or a major intermediate point Phase 4 - leaving on the return journey Phase 5 - returning from the destination Phase 6 - arriving back at the original point of departure. These phases of motion are referred to as the scope of movement. The narration of every journey involves some or all of these phases, sometimes various activities are related, also which tools place during a phase, especially phase 2 and phase 5, are at the destination before starting the return journey.
Languages differ in the phases of motion included in each motion verb, i.e., in the scope of movement encompassed by certain verbs.
Verbs whose scope of movement includes only Phases 1 through 3 or Phases 4 through 6 are called uni-directional verbs. Verbs whose scope includes Phases 1 through 6 are called bi-directional. Some motion verbs, termed nondirectional, do not indicate a direction of motion.
1) Uni-directional verbs
Most Kuna motion verbs are uni-directional, i.e., they involve only one direction of movement. As previously noted, in order to understand the use of specific motion verbs, it is necessary to consider both the reference point of the motion and the scope.

16.4 Grammar

221

a) Uni-directional motion verbs with origin/destination reference point

ne
Ne ‗to go‘ is a uni-directional verb which indicates movement away from the reference point. In English, the scope of the verb ‗to go‘ includes only Phases 1 and 2. Take, for example, the English sentence, ―He went to town and bought some salt.‖ The ―went‖ of the example tells the English speaker that the person not only left his point of origin, but that he also arrived at the destination and was able to ―buy salt‖. If this sentence were to be used in a Kuna situation, the verb ne ‗to go‘ would indicate that the person had left his place of origin and journeyed away from it. Another verb would need to be used to indicate that the person arrived at his destination. Spanish tends to use a second verb for Phase 3 as well, El fue al pueblo. Al llegar allá ... ‗He went to the village. On arriving there...‘

Example Sagla Pukurbal nad.

‗The chief went to Pucuru.‘

Nad includes Phase 1 (left point of origin) and Phase 2 (moved towards destination point).

tag
Tag ‗to come‘ is a uni-directional verb which indicates movement towards a reference point. It can refer to Phase 5, return motion towards the point of origin. Other verbs must be used in Kuna to indicate leaving the destination point on the return trip and also for arrival back at the point of origin.

Example Anche tago.

‗Come to me.‘

al
Al ‗to come away from‘ is a uni-directional verb which indicates return movement from the reference point by leaving the destination on the return trip. Al usually only refers to Phase 4, although affixed forms such as albal can occur in Phase 5.

Example Pedro Yabis akar al.

‗Peter came away from Yavisa.‘

omo
Omo ‗to arrive‘ is a uni-directional verb which refers to arrival at/approach to the reference point, destination (other than the point of origin), or an important intermediate point. It refers only to Phase 3.

Example Luis Panamaje omos.

‗Louis arrived at Panama.‘

noni
Noni ‗to arrive (from somewhere else)‘ is a uni-directional verb which refers to arrival at the reference point of the speaker. It may be used to refer to Phase 6 in a round-trip story that arrives back at the speaker‘s location.

Example Tummagan noni.

‗The chiefs arrived.‘

The following summary of these uni-directional verbs of motion may help clarify their use:

Phase 1 and 2 Phase 3 Phase 4 Phase 5 Phase 6

Sagla nad. Sagla Pukurche omos. Sagla Pukur akar al. Sagla tani. Sagla noni.

‗The chief left.‘ ‗The chief arrived at Pucuru.‘ ‗The chief came away from Pucuru.‘ ‗The chief is coming.‘ ‗The chief arrived (here).‘

b) Uni-directional motion verb with actor as reference point
Some uni-directional motion verbs take as their reference point the present location of the actor, whereas in English, the reference point of those verbs may be the other person involved in the motion (conversation).

222

Retelling Detailed Accounts

tog
Tog ‗to enter‘ is a uni-directional verb which refers to going from the outside to the inside. That is to say, the present location of the actor is the reference point. The use of toge ‗enter‘ parallels the English use of the word ―enter‖. It does not imply the directional concept of motion found in the alternative English expressions ―come in‖ or ―go in,‖ which use a location other than that of the actor as the reference point.

no
No ‗to exit‘ is a uni-directional verb which refers to going from the inside to the outside. The present location of the actor is the reference point. The use of no parallels the English use of the word ―exit.‖ It does not imply the directional concept of motion found in the alternative English expressions ―go out‖ or ―come out.‖

Other uni-directional verbs

Other uni-directional verbs which use the present location of the actor as their reference point are:

1. chu 2. chei 3. nakwe 4. akte

‗fetch/take‘ ‗bring/take (away)‘ ‗go up/come up/ascend‘ ‗go down/come down/descend‘

c) Motion verbs arkwa ‗to fall‘ and agla ‗to fall over‘
The Kuna use of the verbs arkwa ‗to fall‘ and agla ‗to fall (over)‘ encompasses two aspects of the English word ―to fall.‖

arkwa
Arkwa ‗to fall‘ is used when a free fall is involved. That is to say, the whole person/object lands in a lower position than it originally had.

Example An arkwas.

‗I fell (out of a tree/down a river bank).‘

agla
Agla ‗to fall (over/down)/stumble‘ is used when a person or thing topples over and lands in a position on the same level as it was originally.

Example An aglas.

‗I fell (stumbled) (over a stone on the ground).‘

2) Bi-directional verbs
Some verbs are bi-directional and indicate travel to and from a destination. Arpi ‗to go and return‘ is a common bi-directional verb. Arpi may be used to describe a situation where the motion goes from a reference point, to another point and back to the reference point. It may also be used to describe a motion which involves leaving a location, going to a reference point, and returning to the original location.

Examples

The reference point is the speaker‘s location, and the actor went from the reference point and returned to it.

1. Sagla Pukurbal arpi.

‗The chief went to Pucuru (from here) and returned (here). The chief has been to Pucuru.‘

The reference point is the speaker‘s location. The actor came from somewhere else to the reference point and returned to the point of origin.

2. Sagla pato itije arpi.

‗The chief has been (here) already (and returned to the point of origin).‘

3) Non-directional verbs
As with English and Spanish, Kuna has many motion verbs which do not imply direction, such as abarma ‗to run‘, tomoma ‗to swim‘ and nane ‗to walk‘.

16.4 Grammar

223

Example Mimmi pipirma.

‗The baby is wandering around.‘

4) Scope of movement illustrated in Dialogue 16.1
The use of the appropriate verb for each stage of a journey is shown in the following breakdown of Dialogue 16.1.
Sentences 1–5 summarize the trip and, therefore, the bidirectional verb arpi occurs.
In Sentence 6, nad occurs as the narration of the story begins.
Omos appears in Sentence 8, where the traveller reaches an important intermediate point.
In Sentence 12b, nad appears again as the journey continues; and in Sentence 16, it is reduplicated (Phase 2) as he goes on and on.
In Sentence 22a, nad marks leaving (Phase 1) a second intermediate point and in Sentence 22b, omo indicates arrival at the destination (Phase 3).
Sentences 23 through 25 describe movement and other activities within the area of the destination.
As he leaves on the return journey, nad appears first in Sentence 36 and is followed in Sentence 40 by al (Phase 4).
Albal ‗come away from again‘ occurs in Sentence 42 to indicate Phase 5 and algu and alchun in Sentences 52 and 54 to indicate the continuation of Phase 5.
In Sentence 56, as he arrives back at the original point of departure (Phase 6), noni appears and is followed by arpi to signal the completion of the round trip.

16.4.2 Adverbs of duration of stay
There are two adverbs which indicate the duration of stay at a particular location: meg ‗to stay‘ and pirkal ‗not to stay (go/come and return right away)‘.

Example

Airplane pilot speaks to chief.

1. An pirkal tani.

‗I‘ve come (but not to stay).‘

or

2. An meg tani.

‗I‘ve come (to overnight).‘

16.4.3 Goal of motion (Ex. 14–17)
Except for non-directional verbs, motion is always towards some location, i.e., goal of the motion, and away from a source, i.e., point of origin. However, in any given sentence the goal and/or source may be implied. Furthermore, they may be either a general area or direction, or a specific point in a general area. That is, they may be either general or specific.

16.4.3.1 General area goal
If the motion is towards a general area, for example, the jungle versus a specific tree in the jungle, the general goal suffix -bal/-pal is added to the noun. This is the same as the locative suffix for a broad setting described in Section 8.4.1.1).

Example Sagla chapurbal nad.

‗The chief went to the jungle.‘

In the speaker‘s view, the jungle represents a general area, rather than a specific point.

224

Retelling Detailed Accounts

16.4.3.2 Specific goal
If the motion is towards what is viewed as a specific point within a general setting, such as a home within a town, the specific goal suffix -che/-zhe/-je103 is added to the noun.

Example Sagla negzhe nad.

‗The chief went home.‘

The suffix -che/-zhe/-je is also used in the sense of ‗as far as‘.

Example An sagla negzhe arpi.

‗I went as far as the chief‘s house./I went to the chief‘s house.‘

16.4.3.3 General direction words
Sometimes a general direction word, rather than a general or specific area is used as the goal of motion. These general direction words do not use the goal suffixes -bal/-pal or -che/-zhe/-je. Some general direction words include:

1. nakwal 2. teal 3. opakal 4. nuechik 5. chapilechik 6. tad nakwechik 7. tad arkwanechik

‗up (river)‘ ‗down (river)‘ ‗across (the river)‘ ‗right-hand side‘ ‗left-hand side‘ ‗east‘ ‗west‘

Exercise 14. General goal suffix -bal/-pal frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: An chapurbal ne. Student: An chapurbal ne.
1. An chapurbal ne. 2. An tibal ti. 3. Machi Pukurbal nad. 4. Tad Pay tukpal ne. 5. Ome Panamabal ne.

‗I‘m going to go to the jungle.‘ ‗I‘ve come from the river.‘ ‗The boy went to Pucuru.‘ ‗The elder is going to the head of the Paya River.‘ ‗The woman is going to go to Panama.‘

Exercise 15. General goal suffix -bal/-pal frame drill
The teacher asks the question and the student replies using the -bal/-pal suffix to state the goal of motion.

Example Teacher: ¿Pia ne?

Student: Chapurbal ne.

1. chapur

‗jungle‘

2. ti

‗river‘

3. Pukur

‗Pucuru‘

4. igal

‗trail‘

5. Panama

‗Panama‘

Exercise 16. Specific goal suffix -che/-zhe/-je frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

103 -che follows fortis consonants, -zhe follows lenis consonants, and -je follows vowels.

16.4 Grammar

Example Teacher: An negzhe nad. Student: An negzhe nad.
1. An negzhe nad. 2. An Paluje arpi. 3. An tije ne. 4. An ti nakche ti. 5. An yal pirche ne.

‗I went home.‘ ‗I went (and came back) as far as Palu.‘ ‗I am going to go as far as the river.‘ ‗I‘ve been as far as the mouth of the river.‘ ‗I am going to the top of the hill.‘

Exercise 17. Specific goal suffix -che/-zhe/-je drill
The teacher asks the question and the student replies using the -che/-zhe/-je specific goal suffix to describe the goal of motion.

Example Teacher: ¿Piaje arpi?

Student: Negzhe arpi.

1. neg

‗house‘

2. ti

‗river‘

3. yal pir

‗top of the hill‘

4. Pukur

‗Pucuru‘

5. ti tuk

‗headwaters of the river‘

16.4.4 Source of motion (Ex. 18–19)
The location at which a motion originates is called the source of motion. The source of motion is described by using the source of motion word akar ‗from‘ following the locative word without a locative suffix.

Example Machi Pukur akar noni. ‗The boy arrived from Pucuru.‘
If a person has a choice of going via Route X or via Route Y when travelling from Point A to Point B, the way he chooses is the path of motion and is marked by the suffix -chik/-zhik ‗via‘.

Example Sagla Pukurzhik noni.

‗The chief arrived via Pucuru.‘

Exercise 18. Source of motion akar ‗from‘ frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: An neg akar tani. Student: An neg akar tani.
1. An neg akar tani. 2. An ti akar tani. 3. An nakwal akar tani. 4. An Panama akar tani. 5. An Pukur akar tani.

Exercise 19. Source of motion akar ‗from‘ frame drill
The teacher asks the question and the student replies using the word akar ‗from‘ following the locative word.

Example Teacher: ¿Pia akar tani?

Student: Chapur akar tani.

Frame ¿Pia akar tani?

1. chapur

‗jungle‘

2. ti

‗river‘

3. teal

‗downriver‘

4. Panama

‗Panama‘

Retelling Detailed Accounts

16.4.5 Other action verbs with verbs of motion (Ex. 20) Another action may accompany or follow a motion.

16.4.5.1 Action accompanying motion
An action which occurs at the same time as a motion parallels such English constructions as, ―He came singing.‖ or ―She left skipping.‖ In Kuna, these are formed by the reduplicated short form of the action verb stem followed by the appropriate form of a motion verb.

Examples 1. Nubi ichoma-ichoma nade. 2. Puna nama-nama noni.

‗The rabbit went jumping (away).‘ ‗The girl arrived singing.‘

16.4.5.2 Another action following motion
When another action is subsequent to/or the purpose of a motion, the short form of the action verb stem is followed by the appropriate motion verb which is attached to it.

Examples 1. Machered ua chwanade. 2. An mol paktani. 3. An mol pakti.

‗The man went to fish.‘ ‗I came to buy cloth.‘ ‗I have been to buy cloth.‘

Exercise 20. Action verbs with verbs of motion
The teacher says the sentence. The student selects one of the suggested action verbs and uses it in a duplicated form in a sentence to indicate that the action and the motion occur concurrently. This exercise should be repeated with the student adding the action verb to the verb of motion to indicate that the action follows the verb.

Examples Teacher: An nade.

Student: An nama-nama nade.

Teacher: An nade.

Student: An namanade.

17 TELLING STORIES

17.1 Dialogue
Relating personal experiences and stories plays an important role in Kuna social life.

A man in the city is telling about the events which transpired during his trip to town. He speaks to the audience:

1. Antin Pay akar nos, al.

‗I left Paya, I came away.‘

2. Anmal walpá, ante tegin chulubde tegin ‗There were three of us, myself, a policeman, and an

wag walgwenbal, yal okpinal tani.

outsider who came from Colombia (lit.: the other side of

the mountain).‘

3. Adin chog, ede IRHEgin arpa, Panamagin.

‗The outsider said that he worked for IRHE in Panama.‘

4. Pel ukles anmal walpá.

‗There were three of us all told.‘

5. Tegin anmal nos Pay akar wachilpabakkin.

‗We left Paya at eight o‘clock.‘

6. Anmal kep pela-pela almal, Pay akar; limiteje, wachilbakebakkin nonimal.

‗We left Paya and travelled fast; we arrived at the boundary at nine o‘clock.‘

7. Tegin immal kwen takchajulgus; igalbal.

‗We didn‘t see anything (wildlife) along the way.‘

8. Kep limitegin wis ampa ampagusmalbal ‗We stayed at the boundary for a little while, about five

icheal, minuto atal.

minutes.‘

9. Kep tegin nanmalbal, Tapaliche.

‗Then only did we go on again, to the Tapalis River.‘

10. Igalbal immal kwen takchajulgusbal. ‗We didn‘t see anything on the trail again.‘

11. Anmal Tapalis omosmalgu wachilambe ‗When we arrived at Tapalis it was half past ten.‘ eg abal.

12. Degin wis ampagusmalbal, wis tibi kobzhamalbal.

‗We stayed there awhile again, and again we drank a little water.‘

The traveller then went on to tell of the remainder of his trip.

17.2 Pronunciation

17.2.1 Story-telling intonation (Ex. 1–3) A fascinating tale may be turned into a dull account simply because of a flat, unexpressive intonation pattern. Learning good story-telling intonation patterns is very difficult under classroom conditions. Your success in mastering the art of story-telling will depend on applying yourself to mimicking. Take every possible opportunity to track or silently mimic people as you sit listening to them tell stories.
Exercise 1. Tracking
Track the teacher as he says Dialogue 17.1.
Exercise 2. Dialogue dramatization
The student should dramatize Dialogue 17.1 to the class. Pay special attention to the pauses and the crescendos.
Exercise 3. Problem-solving drill
Discuss and drill any problems encountered in Exercises 1 and 2 above.

228

17.2 Pronunciation

229

17.2.2 Good story-telling style There are several phonological features which mark good story-telling style.

17.2.2.1 Pauses
Extra long pauses are used by a good storyteller 1) to dramatize the change of scene (―stage‖), and 2) to create suspense.

17.2.2.2 Onomatopoetic words
Many Kuna people are superb storytellers. A good storyteller sprinkles onomatopoetic expressions throughout the story; birds trill, motors roar, bees buzz. For example, the sound of the flapping wings of a bird may be described as: mer-mer-mer-mer-mer-mer...

Two common onomatopoetic expressions are toas and mok. Toas is used to dramatize shots (in a hunting story) or a banging sound. Mok is used to dramatize a collision between objects.

Onomatopoetic words are used at climactic points in the relating of stories or exciting events.

Examples 1a. Yannu anche abarmanoni. b. Toas, an imas. 2a. Ai korkidin olligin e nugal yoles. b. ¡Motok! Mer-mer-mer-mer pes. c. Keg kuku; kales, ai korkide.

‗The peccary came charging towards me.‘ ‗Bang! I shot (it).‘ ‗Friend pelican‘s beak slammed into the mud.‘ ‗Thud! (His wings went) whir-whir-whir-whir.‘ ‗He could not fly; friend pelican was stuck fast.‘

17.2.2.3 Stress switch
An action may be dramatized and intensified by a change of stress. This intensification is achieved by changing a lenis consonant to fortis, and stressing the final syllable of the emphasized word.

Examples 1. Purkwis. 2. chibu 3. Nade.

‗It died.‘ ‗white‘ ‗He went.‘

becomes becomes becomes

Purkwís. chipú Naté.

‗It dropped dead.‘ ‗snow-white‘ ‗He took off/disappeared.‘

17.2.2.4 Rapid repetition in an undertone
Sometimes a verb is repeated very rapidly several times in a row, in almost an undertone, and then it fades away to virtual silence.

Example Nade-nade-nade-nade...
Rapid repetition is used in two ways:

‗He went on and on and on and on (until)...‘

1. to skim over uninteresting episodes to the next point of interest, and 2. to build suspense before an unexpected dramatic incident.

17.2.2.5 Interjections
Interjections by the narrator indicate his personal sentiments or emotional attitude toward the situation and help to set the stage for the story.

Examples 1. ai-yai-yai 2. máchi 3. chuli-chuli-chuli 4. mantur

‗(reflects great distress)‘ ‗(reflects surprise/disbelief)‘ ‗(reflects shock/disagreement)‘ ‗(reflects surprise/disbelief)‘

230

Telling Stories

17.3 Culture
Kuna culture prescribes a listener‘s code of etiquette. As a language learner, you will undoubtedly have many opportunities to hear fascinating tales from your Kuna friends. A person listening to a story is expected to interject appropriate responses, conversation sustainers (see XI.D.3.), in order to assure the storyteller of your continuing interest.
In meetings, if the speaker has exceeded the time due him according to his status, he is ―talked down‖. The older men start talking to each other getting louder and louder until the speaker is drowned out. Occasionally this happens if nobody agrees with the speaker. Even then, normally he has a fair hearing and only gets ―talked down‖ when he starts to reiterate what he has already said.

17.4 Grammar
In this lesson, we discuss the postpredicate position in the sentence. In Kuna, information which is to be highlighted or which is to be made more clear, is placed at the end of a sentence. Thus, a sentence can comprise either a simple sentence or a simple sentence followed by a postpredicate element. Any one element of a given sentence may appear in this position.
The postpredicate element is usually separated from the main part of the sentence by a semi-colon in writing; in speaking, there is a slight pause before it. This element is said with a different intonation pattern than the pattern used in the main sentence.

17.4.1 Uses of postpredicate position (Ex. 4)
The postpredicate position is used for highlighting or emphasis, for redistribution of information in order to avoid information overload, or for clarifying.

17.4.1.1 Highlighting or emphasis
Information which the speaker feels needs further emphasis or highlighting may be placed in the postpredicate position. For example, we will examine the following sentence.

Example

Machi nakwal chule amine, mutik.

‗The boy is going to hunt paca upriver tonight.‘

In English and Spanish, the speaker may emphasize one element of a sentence by putting a heavy stress on the word to be emphasized as it is spoken. In Kuna, emphasis may be placed on any of the words in the sentence by placing that word after the predicate. In the example, the word mutik ‗tonight‘ is emphasized.

17.4.1.2 Information overload
Kuna places a limit on the number of elements that can be placed in one sentence, including the number of adjectives or adverbs modifying a given element. An item of information which exceeds the limit of pieces of information permitted in a Kuna sentence, i.e., the information overload, may be placed in the postpredicate position. If the information overload exceeds one item, the information should be distributed between two or more sentences.
A chronic error made by people learning to speak Kuna is that of trying to place all the information relative to a situation into one sentence. A similar situation arises in English and Spanish when a speaker strings many clauses, adjectives, or adverbs together without pausing or changing emphasis. In either case, the listener becomes confused and does not understand the sentence.
1) Element overload
In general, Kuna is limited to three or four elements in a single sentence. The essential information is put in the simple sentence and the most important item of the secondary information is put in the postpredicate position.

17.4 Grammar

231

Examine the following example. The English sentence contains five items of information which are usually too many for a simple sentence in Kuna. One item may be put in the postpredicate position or two sentences may be used.

Example

1

2

3

4

5

The boy is going to give

the cloth to the woman

tonight.

The essential information, that is the basic elements (―the boy is going to give the cloth‖), should be placed in the simple sentence. The speaker must choose the item of more importance to him from the two remaining items (―tonight‖ and ―to the woman‖). The more important item is placed in the postpredicate position, the other item is placed in the simple sentence. Following are two examples of how the sample English sentence could be rendered in Kuna.

Example 1 Machi The boy
Example 5 Mutik tonight

4 omega to the woman
1 machi the boy

3 mol cloth
3 mol cloth

2 ukne; is going to give
2 ukne; is going to give

5 mutik. tonight
4 omega. to the woman

2) Modifier overload104
In most cases in Kuna, only one modifier of a noun or verb may be used in the simple sentence. Two adjectives or adverbs used to modify a single element are treated as modifier overload and one of them is placed in the postpredicate position.

Examples A big black canoe arrived.
1. Ul tummad noni; ul chichidi. 2. Ul chichid noni; ul tummad.

‗A big canoe arrived; a black canoe.‘ ‗A black canoe arrived; a big canoe.‘

17.4.1.3 Clarifying
The postpredicate position may be used to clarify the statement in the simple sentence. Clarification is achieved by stating additional information which will help to avoid ambiguity, an afterthought, or additional information after the speaker has hesitated.

1) Avoiding ambiguity
Sometimes a speaker, in the process of saying a sentence, will realize that his meaning has been obscure, and he will add a word following the predicate to avoid ambiguity or to clarify the intended meaning.
Example An ul pei; ul kinnigwad. ‗I want the canoe; the red canoe.‘

2) Afterthought
Occasionally, a speaker will add information in this position as an afterthought. Such a thought is sometimes added to forestall an expected objection by the listener, by clarifying the intended meaning.

Example Kujal, an pe pennuko ... chedo, itos.

‗Later I will pay you back; ... (pause) ... this afternoon, you understand.‘

104 See 9.4.4.3.

232

Telling Stories

3) Hesitancy
At other times, the postpredicate position is used to fill in information after the speaker pauses because he has momentarily forgotten or omitted an item. In such instances, a generic (non-specific) term may occur in the main sentence and a specific term after the predicate.

Example 1. ¿Toa nad? 2. ... Iwen nad; ... m-mmm Pedro.

‗Who went?‘ ‗(Thinking) So-n-so went; ... m-mmm Peter.‘

Exercise 4. Postpredicate position intonation drill
Stage 1 - Mimicking

The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student hums the tune; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student hums the tune, etc.

Stage 2 - Tracking

The student tracks the teacher as he says Sentence 1; the student tracks the teacher as he says Sentence 2, etc.

Stage 3 - Frame drill

The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc.

Example Teacher: Tule noni; tule walapá.

Student: Tule noni; tule walapá.

1. Tule noni; tule walapá.

‗Three people arrived.‘

2. Machi ne; immal amine.

‗The boy is going to hunt.‘

3. Ul noni; ul tummadi.

‗The big canoe arrived.‘

4. Anka chogbalo; pinna.

‗Tell me again slowly.‘

5. Machi mol ukcha; nanga.

‗The boy gave the cloth to (his) mother.‘

17.4.2 Guidelines for placing elements in the postpredicate position (Ex. 5–28)
For purposes of discussion, the elements of the simple sentence are divided into two classes: basic and peripheral. Basic elements are the subject, the direct object (in transitive sentences), and the predicate. All other elements of the simple sentence are peripheral: indirect object; locative, goal and time words and phrases; and adjectives and adverbs.105
The guidelines for placing both peripheral and basic elements in the postpredicate position are similar. Those for placing peripheral elements there tend to be more general, however, and are, therefore, dealt with before the more specific ones for basic elements. If the same guideline applies to a basic element, it is included in this section. Guidelines specific to basic elements are discussed in Lesson XVIII.D.5. When a peripheral element is to be placed in the postpredicate position for purposes of highlighting or clarifying, it may be handled in one of four ways.

17.4.2.1 Peripheral element omitted in the main clause and unexpanded in the postpredicate position
The preferred way to highlight any peripheral element is to omit it entirely from the simple sentence and place it after the predicate in the form it would have appeared in the simple sentence. This is, of course, the only option apart from adding another sentence for including an element which would result in information overload.

105 It could be argued that locative and goal words and phrases are basic elements of sentences with motion or positional verbs and that the indirect object is a basic element with a ditransitive verb. However, we have chosen to treat as peripheral any nominal element in which a suffix indicates its function. By this criterion, only subject and object, and possibly vocative, are basic nominal elements.

17.4 Grammar

Examples Indirect object:
1. An mol ukcha; nanga. Time word:
2. An ne; mutik. Locative word:
3. Koe un; chapurbal. Goal word:
4. An ne; negzhe. Adverb:
5. Machi ne; kueye-kueye.

‗I gave the cloth to Mother.‘ ‗I am going tonight.‘ ‗A deer is in the jungle.‘ ‗I am going to go home.‘ ‗The boy is going to go quickly.‘

Exercise 5. Postpredicate position (peripheral element omission) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: An mol ukne; nanga. Student: An mol ukne; nanga.
1. An mol ukne; nanga. 2. An ne; negzhe. 3. Machi immal amine; chapurbal. 4. Tule noni; Pukur akar. 5. An cho chikne; akangin.

‗I am going to give the cloth to Mother.‘ ‗I‘m going to go home.‘ ‗The boy is going hunting in the jungle.‘ ‗The people have arrived from Pucuru.‘ ‗I am going to cut firewood with an axe.‘

Exercise 6. Postpredicate position (peripheral element omission) transform drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it moving the peripheral element from the simple sentence to the postpredicate position.

Example Teacher: An nanga mol ukcha. Student: An mol ukcha; nanga.
1. An nanga mol ukcha. 2. Machi negzhe nad. 3. Ozhi igalgin pukwa. 4. Machergan kullubal arpanani. 5. Kukualed Panama akar tani. 6. Machi ulgin nad. 7. Machi opakal aros tigne. 8. Sagla sae arpi. 9. Ome ankin mol pakcha. 10. Machi pabbak immal amine.

‗I gave Mother the cloth.‘ ‗The boy went home.‘ ‗The pineapples are in the path.‘ ‗The men are working on the (river) bank.‘ ‗The plane is coming from Panama.‘ ‗The boy went by canoe.‘ ‗The boy is going to plant rice across (the river).‘ ‗The chief went (and came back) yesterday.‘ ‗The woman bought the cloth from me.‘ ‗The boy is going hunting with (his) father.‘

Telling Stories

Examples

1. Machi nanga ua ukcha; nanga.106

‗The boy gave Mother the fish.‘

2. Machi Panamabal ne; Panamabal.

‗The boy is going to go to Panama.‘

Similarly, when a peripheral element is modified by an adjective, the noun, adjective and suffix may all be

repeated in the postpredicate position.

Examples
1. Tad machi tummadga es ukcha; machi tummadga.
2. Ome choneg tummadzhe nad; choneg tummadzhe.

‗The elder gave the machete to the big boy.‘ ‗The woman went to the big cookhouse.‘

Exercise 7. Postpredicate position (peripheral element repetition) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Ome macheredga ua tus; macheredga.

Student: Ome macheredga ua tus; macheredga.

1. Ome macheredga ua tus; macheredga.

‗The woman cooked fish for (her) husband.‘

2. Machi chapurbal arpi; chapurbal.

‗The boy has been to the jungle.‘

3. Wag teal akar tani; teal akar.

‗The outsider has come from downriver.‘

4. Machi aktegalgin ua makcha; aktegalgin.

‗The boy speared the fish with his punt.‘

5. Mu negzhe nad; negzhe.

‗The old lady went home.‘

Exercise 8. Postpredicate position (peripheral element repetition) drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it adding the peripheral element in the postpredicate position.

Example Teacher: Machi nanga ua ukcha.

Student: Machi nanga ua ukcha; nanga.

1. Machi nanga ua ukcha.

‗The boy gave (his) mother the fish.‘

2. Machi igalbal koe takcha.

‗The boy saw a deer on the trail.‘

3. Kukualed Panama akar tani.

‗The plane is coming from Panama.‘

4. Machi yal pirzhe nad.

‗The boy went to the top of the hill.‘

5. Machi esgin mas chikcha.

‗The boy cut the plantains with a machete.‘

Likewise, the subject may be restated, either in the long or short form. When the sentence is an assertion about

the identity of the subject, one of the topic marking suffixes -din/-tin or -de/-te tends to be attached, as in

Sentences 3 and 4 of Exercise 9.

Examples 1. Pab ye; paba. 2. Nan mas chikti; nan.

‗Father is sick.‘ ‗Mother cut plantains.‘

Exercise 9. Postpredicate position (subject repeated) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

106 The distinction between sentences 1 and 2 below is very slight:

1. Machi ua ukcha; nanga.

‗The boy gave the fish to Mother.‘

2. Machi nanga ua ukcha; nanga. ‗The boy gave Mother the fish.‘

Sentence 2 places a somewhat stronger emphasis on the indirect object than does Sentence 1.

Example Teacher: Kukualed nade; kukualed. Student: Kukualed nade; kukualed.
1. Kukualed nade; kukualed. 2. Pab ye; pab. 3. Mude, kachi chomnai; mude. 4. Omedin mas tunai; omedin. 5. Urpa ina kobdani; urpa.

‗The airplane left (went).‘ ‗Father is sick.‘ ‗The old lady is making a hammock.‘ ‗The woman (on the other hand) is cooking food.‘ ‗The younger sister/brother has come to drink medicine.‘

Exercise 10. Postpredicate position (subject repeated) drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it repeating the subject in the postpredicate position. The teacher then repeats the correct answer after the student. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Wag nade.

Student: Wag nade; waga.

Teacher: Wag nade; waga.

1. Wag nade.

‗The outsider left.‘

2. Pab anka es ukcha.

‗Father gave me the machete.‘

3. Machi ob chunad.

‗The boy went to fetch corn.‘

4. Nandin chi.

‗Mother (on the other hand) is at home.‘

5. Yannu nas.

‗The peccaries passed by.‘

Similarly, either the long or short form of the direct object may be used in the postpredicate position, but the use of the long form in the main part of the sentence occurs only when an adult is speaking to a very small child.

Examples 1. An ob chune; ob. 2. An ob chune; oba. 3. An oba chune; oba.

‗I am going to fetch corn.‘ ‗I am going to fetch corn.‘ ‗I am going to fetch corn (baby talk).‘

Exercise 11. Postpredicate position (object repetition) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: An ob chune; ob. Student: An ob chune; ob.
1. An ob chune; ob. 2. Machi arri amine; arri. 3. An arki makne; arki. 4. Tad ul chobzha; ulu. 5. Ome mol makcha; mola.

‗I am going to fetch corn.‘ ‗The boy is going to hunt iguana.‘ ‗I am going to spear huacuco.‘ ‗The elder made a canoe.‘ ‗The woman sewed a blouse.‘

Exercise 12. Postpredicate position (object repetition) drill

17.4.2.3 Element stated in unexpanded or expanded form in the simple sentence and in an expanded form in the postpredicate position

1) Element modified by one adjective or a more specific term
A peripheral element may occur in unmodified form, but with any required suffix, in the simple sentence and be repeated in the postpredicate position followed by an adjective to which the suffix is attached, or it may be repeated and followed by a more specific term, as in Sentence 4 of Exercise 13.

Exercise 13. Postpredicate position (peripheral element expanded) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Pab machiga es ukcha; machi tummadga.

Student: Pab machiga es ukcha; machi tummadga.

1. Pab machiga es ukcha; machi tummadga. ‗Father gave the boy a machete; to the big boy.‘

2. Machi ulgin nad; ul arradgin.

‗The boy went by canoe; in the blue canoe.‘

3. Machi esgin neg emis; es pingin.

‗The boy cleaned the field with a machete; a new machete.‘

4. Sagla sae arpi; sae wakur.

‗The chief went yesterday; yesterday morning.‘

Exercise 14. Postpredicate position (peripheral element expanded) drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it, expanding the peripheral element in the postpredicate position by using one of the suggested expansions below.

Example Teacher: Nan punga mol ukcha.

Student: Nan punga mol ukcha; pun tummadga.

Expansion

1. tummad

‗big‘

2. arrad

‗blue‘

3. aluminyogad

‗aluminum‘

Statement

1. Nan punga mol ukcha.

‗Mother gave the girl cloth.‘

2. Tad kukualedgin noni.

‗The elder arrived by plane.‘

3. Ua pormogin pukwa.

‗The fish are in the pot.‘

4. Machi negzhe immal pelene.

‗The boy is going to carry the thing to the house.‘

5. Ome neg akar tani.

‗The woman is coming from the house.‘

The subject likewise, may be highlighted by stating it in an unexpanded form in the simple sentence and in an expanded form in the postpredicate position. The expanded form of the subject after the predicate includes: subject accompanied by an adjective (long or short form) which is modified by an adverb; subject accompanied by a duplicated adjective (long or short form); or subject accompanied by a second

adjective.

Example

Ul noni; ul tummad.

‗A big canoe arrived. (lit.: the canoe arrived; the big canoe).‘

When the adjective in the postpredicate position is a numeral, the subject may be omitted if the number prefix unambiguously refers to it (see Sections 5.4 and 7.4). The long or short form of the numeral prefix may be used.

Examples 1. Tule noni; tule walapá. 2. Tule noni; walapá. 3. Tule noni; walpá.

‗Three people arrived.‘ ‗Three people arrived.‘ ‗Three people arrived.‘

Exercise 15. Postpredicate position (subject expansion) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Ul noni; ul tummadi. Student: Ul noni; ul tummadi.
1. Ul noni; ul tummadi. 2. Koe wakis; koe chapinni. 3. Wag nad; waga chowidi. 4. Wagi ob mas; wagi ichejuli. 5. Chapi kullubal kwichi; chapi tummadi.

‗The big canoe arrived.‘ ‗The young deer escaped.‘ ‗The tall outsider left.‘ ‗Many parrots ate the corn.‘ ‗A big tree grows on the (river) bank.‘

Exercise 16. Postpredicate position (subject expansion) drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it, expanding the subject by using one of the suggested expansions below.

Example Teacher: Ul noni.

Student: Ul noni; ul tummad.

Expansion

1. tummad

‗big‘

2. arrad

‗blue‘

3. nued

‗good‘

Statement

1. Ul noni.

‗The canoe arrived.‘

2. Tud neg tikalbal nis.

‗The flower grew beside the house.‘

3. Kukualed aktes.

‗The plane landed.‘

4. Motor nakwis.

‗The outboard canoe went/came upriver.‘

5. Chikwi purkwis.

‗The bird died.‘

Similarly, the direct object may be stated in an unexpanded form in the simple sentence and in an expanded form in the postpredicate position in order to highlight or clarify it. The adjective which modifies the direct object and occurs in the postpredicate position may occur in its long or short form. If two forms exist for that particular adjective, the long form is more descriptive.

Example
Machi ul pakcha; ul tummadi. ‗The boy bought a big canoe.‘ The speaker of this example wishes you to realize that the canoe purchased was a big canoe. The emphasis is on the description of the canoe.

The short form of an adjective which has a long/short form is used to classify the noun it modifies. It gives a similar connotation as the English phrase, ―one of the items classified as the ____ (big, fat, little, etc.) ones.‖

Example
Machi ul pakcha; ul tummad. ‗The boy bought a canoe, one of the big ones.‘ The speaker of this example wishes you to realize that the canoe purchased was one of the big ones. The emphasis is on the group to which/from which the object belongs/was chosen.

The difference in meaning between sentences using the long and short form of a certain adjective is very slight; however, it is helpful to be aware of this shade of meaning.

1. chered

‗old‘

2. nugal nikad ‗sharp‘

3. iskujaled ‗broken‘

2) Element modified by two adjectives
In English, any noun may be modified by two adjectives. In Kuna, if an element is to be modified by two adjectives, both modifiers do not occur in the simple sentence (see 17.4.1.2). The speaker must determine which adjective is more important to him. The element and the less important adjective to which the appropriate suffix is attached are placed in the simple sentence. Then the element and the more important adjective to which the appropriate suffix is attached are placed in the postverbal position, further modifying the element without information overload.

Examples

1. Sagla ul tummadgin nade; ul kinnidgin. ‗The chief went in a big red canoe.‘

The speaker chose to emphasize kinnid ‗red‘ rather than tummad ‗big‘.

2. Tad ul tummad pakcha; ul kinnid.

‗The elder bought a big red canoe.‘

3. Tad ul tummad pakcha; ul kinnidi.

‗The elder bought a big canoe; a red (one).‘

17.4 Grammar

239

Exercise 19. Postpredicate position (second adjective with element) drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it, using a second adjective (from the suggested ones in the list below) in the postpredicate position.

Example Teacher: Ul tummad noni.

Student: Ul tummad noni; ul kinnidi.

Expansion

1. kinnid

‗red‘

2. chellele

‗hard‘

3. nued

‗good‘

Statement

1. Ul tummad noni.

‗A big canoe arrived.‘

2. Machi ob ichejul chus.

‗The boy fetched lots of corn.‘

3. Sagla kabaston chowid chobzha.

‗The chief made a long baton.‘

4. Ome mol toto makcha.

‗The woman made a small blouse.‘

5. Nap chunnad pistagin nai.

‗There is real soil on the airstrip.‘

In some cases, one or two adjectives are needed to specifically classify a generic term, thus in a sense,

becoming part of the actual name of the element. In this case, the long form of the adjective is descriptive and the short form is a classification of the object.

Example

1. achu

‗carnivorous animal‘

2. achu parpad

‗spotted carnivorous animal (ocelot)‘

3. achu parpad tummad

‗large spotted carnivorous animal (either a jaguar or a big ocelot)‘

Example

1. Machi achu parpad mecha; achu tummad.

‗The boy killed a jaguar (class of animal).‘

2. Machi achu parpad mecha; achu tummadi. ‗The boy killed a big ocelot.‘

Exercise 20. Postpredicate position (second adjective with direct object) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Tad ul tummad pakcha; ul kinnidi.

Student: Tad ul tummad pakcha; ul kinnidi.

1. Tad ul tummad pakcha; ul kinnidi.

‗The elder bought a big red canoe.‘

2. Ome mol kinnid pakcha; mol nuedi.

‗The woman bought good red cloth.‘

3. Ome mas ichejul tus; mas nugu kullegedi.

‗The woman cooked lots of delicious food.‘

4. Machi wag chowid takcha; wag istara.

‗The boy saw a tall, wicked outsider.‘

5. Machi achu parpad mecha; achu tummadi.

‗The boy killed a large (spotted) jaguar.‘

3) Element modified by a modified adjective
Occasionally, the adjective which describes an element is itself modified by an adverb such as yer ‗very‘ or pezhe ‗too‘. Or sometimes the attribute of the adjective is enhanced (intensified) by repetition. An element thus modified appears in the simple sentence with the unmodified adjective and the appropriate suffix (if any) and then in the postpredicate position it is repeated and followed by the adjective modifier (adverb or repeated adjective), the adjective and the appropriate suffix. Modified adjectives tend to occur only in the postpredicate position.

Examples 1. Sagla ul totogin nade; ul yer totogin.

‗The chief left in a very small canoe.‘

240

Telling Stories

2. Sagla ul tummadgin nade; ul tummad-tummadgin.
3. Ul tummad noni; ul yer tunkus.
4. Ul tummad noni; ul tummad-tummad.

‗The chief left in a really big canoe.‘
‗A very big canoe arrived. (lit. the big canoe arrived, the very grown one).‘ ‗The very big canoe arrived. (lit.: the big canoe arrived, the big, big canoe).‘

Exercise 21. Postpredicate position (repeated adjective with direct object) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Tad ul tummad chobzha; ul tummad-tummad.

Student: Tad ul tummad chobzha; ul tummad-tummad.

1. Tad ul tummad chobzha; ul tummad-tummad.

‗The elder made a really big canoe.‘

2. Ome mol kinnid pakcha; mol kinnid-kinnid. ‗The woman bought a pure red piece of cloth.‘

3. Machi karpa toto chobzha; karpa toto-toto. ‗The boy made a really small basket.‘

4. Wag wawadun kollo pakpi; wawadun

‗The outsider wanted to buy really ripe bananas.‘

kollo-kollo.

5. Wag kullubal ul nungus ebes; ul nungus-nungus.

‗The outsider left a very rotten canoe on the (river) bank.‘

An adjective is normally only modified by an adverb when it has been mentioned by a previous speaker and the present speaker wishes to intensify and/or clarify the attribute of the adjective. For example, a speaker may say, ―Did he make a big canoe?‖ The reply may intensify the adjective by saying, ―He made a very big canoe.‖ or ―He made a big canoe, a very big one.‖

Long and short forms of the modified adjectives and the evaluation classification suffix -gwa/-kwa may be used where applicable (see 18.4.5.2 and also for cases in which just the modified adjective may occur in the postpredicate position).

Examples Adjective modified by an adverb
1. Tad ul tummad chobzha; ul yer tummad. 2. Tad ul toto chobzha; yer toto. 3. Tad ul toto chobzha; yer totogwad.
Examples Adjective modified by duplication
1. Tad ul tummad chobzha; ul tummad-tummad.
2. Tad ul tummad chobzha; ul tummad-tummadi.
3. Tad ul tummad chobzha; tummad-tummad.
4. Tad ul toto chobzha; toto-totogwadi.

‗The elder made a very big canoe.‘ ‗The elder made (in my opinion) a very small canoe.‘ ‗The elder made (in my opinion) (one of the) very small canoe(s).‘
‗The elder made a very big canoe.‘
‗The elder made (one of the) very big canoe(s).‘
‗The elder made (in my opinion) a very big canoe.‘
‗The elder made (in my opinion) (one of the) very small canoe(s).‘

Exercise 22. Postpredicate position (modified adjective with direct object) response drill
The teacher says the question and the student answers it using a modified direct object in the main clause and an adjective modified by an adverb in the postpredicate position.

17.4 Grammar

Example Teacher: ¿Tad ul tummad chobzha?

Student: Eye. Tad ul tummad chobzha; ul yer tummad.

Adverb

1. yer

‗very (good)‘

2. pezhe

‗very (bad)‘

Question

1. ¿Tad ul tummad chobzha?

‗Did the outsider sell the broken motor?‘

17.4.2.4 Element stated in a non-specific form in the simple sentence and in a specific form in the postpredicate position
Occasionally, when the term for an element is momentarily forgotten, a non-specific (generic) term with the appropriate suffix occurs in the simple sentence and the specific term and suffix occur after the predicate. Such generic terms as immal ‗thing/animal‘ tule ‗people‘ and iwen ‗what‘s-his-name/what-you-call-it‘ are often thus used. In such a case, however, the preferred construction is to omit a peripheral element from the simple sentence and include it only in the postpredicate position.

Exercise 23. Postpredicate position (peripheral element specific term) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: An iwenga mol pakcha; Pedroga.

Student: An iwenga mol pakcha; Pedroga.

1. An iwenga mol pakcha; Pedroga.

‗I bought cloth for what‘s-his-name, Peter.‘

2. An tuleje ekisne; saglaje.

‗I am going to ask a Kuna, the chief.‘

3. An iwengin es onos; ulgin.

‗I found the machete, m-mmm, in the canoe.‘

4. Wag iwen akar tani; Pukur akar.

‗The outsider came from m-mmm, from Pucuru.‘

5. Ua iwengin pukwa; mesagin.

‗The fish is on the ... on the table.‘

In the case of the subject, the generic-specific construction is sometimes deliberately used to withhold information and thus highlight it after the predicate. Either the long or short form (if available) may be used for the subject when it occurs after the predicate.

Examples 1. Immal noni; nu. 2. Iwen noni; Pablo. 3. Tulemal arpi; Pay tolgan.

‗A dove arrived (lit.: something arrived, a dove).‘
‗Paul arrived (lit.: someone arrived, Paul).‘
‗The people from Paya went and came back (lit.: some people went and came back, the Paya inhabitants).‘

Exercise 24. Postpredicate position (subject specific) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Immal noni; chule. Student: Immal noni; chule.
1. Immal noni; chule. 2. Chikwi pistagin pukwa; taki-taki.

‗Something arrived, a paca.‘
‗Birds are on the airstrip, gallito del agua (species of bird).‘

‗The fish won‘t bite, the sabalos.‘ ‗The people have already left, the boys.‘ ‗People have arrived, chiefs.‘

Exercise 25. Postpredicate position (subject specific) substitution drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student selects an appropriate specific subject from the list below and puts it in the postpredicate position of the sentence.

Example Teacher: Tule ormapukwa.

Student: Tule ormapukwa; macherganbi.

Subject

1. macherganbi

‗only the men‘

2. omegan

‗the women/girls‘

3. punamal

‗the young women/girls‘

4. nuskan

‗the children‘

Statement

1. Tule ormapukwa.

‗The people are discussing (in a meeting).‘

2. Tule neg turwinai.

‗The people are sweeping the town.‘

3. Tule mol enuknai.

‗The people are washing clothing.‘

4. Tule turtanai.

‗The people are learning.‘

Exercise 26. Postpredicate position (subject generic) drill
The teacher gives the sentence and the student substitutes a generic subject in the main part of the sentence and moves the specific subject to the postpredicate position.

Example Teacher: Chule noni.

Student: Immal noni; chule.

Subject

1. immal

‗things/animal‘

2. tule

‗person/people‘

3. iwen

‗what‘s-its-name‘

Statement

1. Chule noni.

‗The paca arrived.‘

2. Nuskan todonani.

‗The children are playing.‘

3. Machergan arpanani.

‗The men are working.‘

4. María mol enuknai.

‗Mary is washing clothes.‘

5. Chigli namanai.

‗The wild turkey is calling (singing).‘

6. Yannu nas.

‗The peccary passed by.‘

Similarly, a direct object may be highlighted by stating it in a generic term in the simple sentence and stating a specific term in the postpredicate position. Such a generic term as immal ‗animal‘ may be used. The long or short form of the specific noun may be used where applicable. The short form of the specific term refers to a

class of objects whereas the long form refers to an animal within the class.

In many cases, however, the specific form of the object is not withheld because of a desire to emphasize the object, but rather the generic form accompanied by a verb may convey a single concept. One such phrase is immal pak meaning ‗to shop‘ rather than ‗to buy something‘; similarly immal amine means ‗to hunt‘ rather than ‗to look for something‘. In sentences using the generic term and accompanying verb to convey a single concept, the purpose of the postpredicate position is clarification.

Concentrate on improving the intonation of a sentence in which an element is in postpredicate position. Remember to pay special attention to timing. Pauses and accelerated sections should be carefully drilled.
Exercise 1. Mimicking
Mimic the teacher as he says Dialogue 18.1. Pay special attention to the postpredicate position and the pause preceding it.
Exercise 2. Dramatizing dialogue
Dramatize Dialogue 18.1. First the teacher and a student should take the roles and then two students should take the roles.
Exercise 3. Problem solving drill
Discuss and drill problems in Exercises 1 and 2.
18.3 Culture
Kuna culture and tradition are taught to the people of all ages as the chiefs chant or relate traditional beliefs and code of ethics at town meetings held in the ormaked neg ‗meeting house‘. At the town meetings an outsider
245

246

Situational Explanation

may start to develop an appreciation for the Kuna system of values. Town meetings not only give the language learner an opportunity to hear the language spoken, thus reinforcing intonation patterns, but the teachings in the meetings also help the outsider to understand the way Kunas view situations and how they interpret life in general.
In the home, the child is taught the responsibilities and practical skills of a Kuna way of life. Children learn to help at an early age and parents start to entrust children with jobs and responsibilities commensurate with their ages. They start by carrying simple messages or little things to other family members or relatives. Later they deliver messages throughout the village. Simple chores like throwing out the garbage or washing dishes start the children in the chores of running a house.
The girls learn from their mothers and older female relatives to care for the smaller children. They help in the preparation of food, peeling plantains or cleaning fish. The girls also go out with the women to plant or harvest crops or gather kindling wood.
As the boys grow older, they accompany their fathers or older male relatives to the fields where they learn all that is involved in the cultivation of crops. Trips to the jungle teach them about hunting and the habits of wildlife. A conscientious father uses trips to teach about jungle resources, building supplies, tools, medicines or other needs of everyday life. River trips teach canoe handling and fishing techniques.
In the home, boys learn the art of making tools, baskets, and musical instruments (flutes and rattles).
Because much of the teaching is by practical example and situational explanation, the language learner should avail himself of any invitation to watch, learn and appreciate the various skills.

18.4 Grammar

18.4.1 Nominalization (Ex. 4–5) Verbs may be nominalized by the addition of the suffix -d.

Examples 1a. kob b. kobed 2a. namake b. namaked 3a. Sagla tulemal namaked wis.

‗to drink‘ ‗a drink/something to drink‘ ‗to sing/chant‘ ‗a song/chant/something sung or chanted‘ ‗The chief knows the Kuna chants.‘

18.4.1.1 Use of nominalized forms
A nominalized form of a verb may be used as a noun. The examples above parallel the English construction, ―something to (verb).‖ It may also be used to refer to a person/animal who is doing the verb which is used. This parallels the English construction, ―the person/animal who is (verb)-ing.‖

Examples

1. kukualed onaned

‗pilot (lit.: the person who is causing the airplane to go)‘

2. arpamalad

‗workers (lit.: the people who are working)‘

3. immal taked

‗manager (lit.: the person who is watching (it))‘

4. achu neg taked

‗watch dog‘

A nominalized verb may also be used in a construction which parallels the English relative clause in the sentence, ―The boy who cut his hand, is the one I saw.‖ In the Kuna phrase chunkal chiked ‗who cut his hand‘, the nominalized form of the verb chik ‗to cut‘ is used as a relative clause.

Examples 1. Machi chiklejad nad. 2. Machi nono kochad arpanai.

‗The boy who had been cut went.‘ ‗The boy who hit his head is working.‘

18.4 Grammar

247

18.4.1.2 Addition of suffixes to nominalized verb form Any noun suffixes may be added to the nominalized verb form.

Examples 1. An ul nudajadgin nad. 2. An tule sae nonikidbak nad.

‗I went in the canoe which had been repaired.‘ ‗I went with the person who arrived yesterday.‘

Exercise 4. Nominalization suffix -d frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise may be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Machi esgin chiklejad noni. Student: Machi esgin chiklejad noni.
1. Machi esgin chiklejad noni. 2. ¿Pe immal uked nika?
3. Mas nugu kulleged an pakcha.
4. An tule nonikidbak nad. 5. Pe chogchadyob an imas.

‗The boy who was cut with a machete arrived.‘ ‗Do you have things to sell? (Do you have something which is to sell?)‘ ‗I bought delicious food. (I bought food which tastes good.)‘ ‗I went with the one who arrived.‘ ‗I did it as you said. (I did it like that which you said.)‘

Exercise 5. Nominalization suffix -d substitution drill
The teacher selects one of the phrases below and says it. The student substitutes the -d form of the phrase in the frame. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: ua kuchamala

Student: An ua kuchamalad takcha.

Frame An ____ takcha.

‗I saw the one who/which ____.‘

1. ua kuchamala

‗(they) ate fish‘

2. motor onane

‗causes the outboard to run‘

3. immal uk

‗sell something‘

4. ul pakcha 5. immal aturchas108 6. ti nos108

‗bought a canoe‘ ‗stole something‘ ‗river rose‘

18.4.2 Positional verb of motion (Ex. 6)
In Lesson 6, the positional verbs mai ‗to be (lying)‘, chi ‗to be (sitting)‘, nai ‗to be (hanging)‘, kwichi ‗to be (standing)‘, and un ‗to be (on all fours)‘ are discussed. These five verbs all refer to a stationary position. When a position involves movement, the positional verb ti ‗to have been (somewhere)‘ is used.109

Example Chapurbal an ti.

‗I have been to the jungle.‘

Exercise 6. Positional verb of motion ti ‗to have been (somewhere)‘ stimulus response drill
The teacher asks Question 1 and the student replies using the positional verb of motion ti ‗to have been (somewhere)‘.

108 The suffix -d always attaches on to the long form of the previous suffix, e.g., aturchas/aturchaja becomes aturchajad and nos/noja becomes nojad.
109 The positional verb ti ‗to have been (somewhere)‘ is used in the past; tio ‗to be (going to be somewhere)‘ in the future; and ta ‗to (go about doing habitually)‘ in an habitual sense.

248

Situational Explanation

Example Teacher: ¿Pe chapurbal ne?

Student: Chuli. An pato chapurbal ti.

Frame Chuli. An pato ____ ti.

‗No. I have already been to the ____.‘

1. ¿Pe chapurbal ne?

‗Are you going to go to the jungle?‘

2. ¿Pe negzhe ne?

‗Are you going to go home?‘

3. ¿Pe tibal ne?

‗Are you going to go to the river?‘

4. ¿Pe mas kunne?

‗Are you going to eat (some) food?‘

5. ¿Pe immal amine?

‗Are you going to go hunting?‘

18.4.3 Gerundial verb form (Ex. 7)
The gerund in English is formed by adding the ending -ing to the verb stem, whereas in Kuna it is composed of the long form of the verb stem, that is to say, the verb stem which has the -e. There is no tense aspect suffix in the Kuna gerund.

The gerund is able to act like a noun, for example, ―The doing of it is difficult.‖ In Kuna, as in English, the gerund focuses on the type of action, versus the doing of the action. Take for example the two phrases, ―to plant rice‖ and ―rice planting‖. The first phrase tends to focus on the doing of the action, whereas the second phrase tends to focus on the act itself.

Examples

1. An cho chike.

‗I have been firewood cutting.‘

but

2. An cho chikti.

‗I have been to cut firewood.‘

Following are illustrations of the lack of time aspect suffix:

Examples 1a. ¿Pia pe ne? b. Mas chike. 2a. ¿Ibi chenai? b. Mas chike. 3a. ¿Pia pe ti? b. Mas chike.

‗Where are you going?‘ ‗Plantain cutting.‘ ‗What are you doing?‘ ‗Plantain cutting.‘ ‗Where have you been?‘ ‗Plantain cutting.‘

Exercise 7. Gerund stimulus-response drill
The teacher asks one of the three questions listed below and then selects one of the verbs listed below and says it. The student replies to the teacher‘s question using the gerund, i.e., -e form of the verb in the frame. This exercise should be repeated several times, changing the frame to some other suitable one.

Example Teacher: ¿Pia pe ne?

Teacher: chik

Student: Mas chike.

Frame Mas ____-e.

‗Plantain ____-ing.‘

Questions

1. ¿Pia pe ne?

‗Where are you going?‘

2. ¿Pia pe ti?

‗Where have you been?‘

3. ¿Ibi chenai?

‗What are you doing?‘

Verbs

1. chik

‗to cut‘

2. pak

‗to buy‘

3. uk

‗to sell/give‘

4. met

‗to throw out‘

5. tig 6. tak 7. tu 8. kun 9. enuk 10. chu

‗to plant‘ ‗to see‘ ‗to cook‘ ‗to eat‘ ‗to wash‘ ‗to fetch/take‘

18.4.4 Qualitative suffix -gwa/-kwa
The qualitative suffix -gwa/-kwa is used to identify/describe an object by its nature/quality and parallels the English construction ‗a ____ one‘. This suffix may be added to some nouns and many adjectives; one must learn which forms are acceptable and which are not, since there are no general rules.

Examples

1. We omegwa e mimmi akwe.

‗A female (one) cares for the young.‘

2. Machi orokwagwa.

‗The boy is (a) short (one).‘

The suffix -d(i) may be added to the -gwa/-kwa form of a word and has the effect of the definite English article ―the‖.

Examples 1. Antin omegwad(i) pakcha. 2. Pe anka es orokwagwad(i) uko.

‗I bought the female (of a pair).‘ ‗Please give me the short machete.‘

18.4.5 Postpredicate position of basic elements (Ex. 8–20)
In Lesson XVII, general guidelines for using the postpredicate position were discussed. In this lesson, guidelines specific to the basic elements of the sentence -- subject, direct object, and predicate -- are discussed.

18.4.5.1 Subject may be omitted in the simple sentence and unexpanded in the postpredicate position
If the subject is omitted in the main clause, a very rare occurrence, it is stated in the postpredicate position accompanied by one of the topic marking suffixes: -de/-te or -din/-tin (see Appendix E, 1 and 4).

1) Subject omitted from simple sentence and stated in postpredicate position in answer to question
One situation in which the subject is omitted in the main part of the sentence and stated in the postpredicate position is in answer to a question. If the replier wishes to emphasize the subject as he replies to a question, he may do so by omitting it in the main part of the sentence and stating it, accompanied by the suffix -din/-tin, in the postpredicate position.

Examples 1a. ¿Pia pe ne? b. Chapurbal ne; antin. 2a. ¿Piade? b. Nad; Luisdin.

‗Where are you going?‘ ‗I am going to the jungle.‘ ‗Where (is he)?‘ ‗Louis, went.‘

2) Subject omitted from simple sentence and stated in postpredicate position in storytelling
Another situation in which the subject is omitted from the main part of the sentence, but occurs in the postpredicate position is in the midst of the narration of a story or a tale of activities. This situation is dictated by the rules of storytelling and discourse structure. In a story, when the subject is omitted in the main part of the sentence and stated in the postpredicate position, it is accompanied by the topic marking suffix -de/-te (see Appendix E).

Situational Explanation

Examples

On a peccary hunt, the hunters had tried to head off the animals and to arrive at another point before the animals did. On their arrival at the expected meeting place, they discover...

1. Pato nas; yannude.

‗The peccaries have already gone by.‘

2. Mutik, nakwal chule amine, machide.

‗Tonight the boy is going to hunt paca upriver.‘

18.4.5.2 Direct object stated in main clause, and only adjective stated in the postpredicate position
When the speaker wishes to highlight/clarify an evaluation of a direct object, only the direct object is stated in the main clause and only the adjective is stated in the postpredicate position. In other words, when the speaker wishes to give his opinion of the object, its relative size, quantity or relative weight, etc., only the adjective occurs in the postpredicate position. All adjectives are not of an evaluatory nature. Those which are not evaluatory (e.g., colors) may not occur alone in the postpredicate position.
If the evaluatory adjective is descriptive, the short form is used, and the stress changes to the last syllable of the adjective. Derived adjectives do not change their stress.

Examples

1. Tad ul chobzha; totó.

‗The grandfather made the canoe (what in my opinion is) small.‘

2. Antin mol pakcha; tatár.

‗I bought a flimsy (piece of) cloth.‘

3. Tad ul chobzha; ul yer tummad. ‗The elder made a very big canoe.‘

4. Machi koe makcha; kallagwa. ‗The boy killed a (in my opinion) thin deer.‘

When a speaker highlights an object and evaluates it in terms of the class of similar objects to which it belongs, the suffix -gwa/-kwa is added to the adjective. Some adjectives may not take the suffix, e.g., tummad ‗big‘.

Examples 1. Tad ul chobzha; totogwa.
2. Machi koe makcha; kallagwa.

‗The elder made (what in my opinion is) a (one of the) small (ones) canoe.‘
‗The boy shot (what in my opinion is) (one of the) small deer.‘

Exercise 8. Postpredicate position (object evaluation) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Tad ul chobzha; totó. Student: Tad ul chobzha; totó.
1. Tad ul chobzha; totó. 2. Machi koe makcha; kallagwad. 3. Machi karpa chobzha; túmmad.110 4. Tad yannu mecha; kwallu nikarba. 5. Machi ua makcha; ichejul.

‗The elder made the canoe (in my opinion) small.‘ ‗The boy shot (in my opinion) a thin deer.‘ ‗The boy made (in my opinion) a large basket.‘ ‗The elder killed (in my opinion) a fat peccary.‘ ‗The boy caught (in my opinion) lots of fish.‘

Exercise 9. Postpredicate position (object evaluation) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

110 The intense form of tummad ‗big‘ is túmmad. Heavy stress and an elongated mm signals the emphatic form.

18.4.5.3 Postpredicate position of expansion of predicate The predicate may be highlighted/clarified in one of the following ways:

252

Situational Explanation

1) Predicate may be stated in the minimum form of a motion verb in the simple sentence and in an expanded form in the postpredicate position
The predicate may be stated in the minimum form of a motion verb (see 16.4.1), ne ‗to go‘ or tag ‗to come‘ in the main part of the sentence and expanded by either stating the object and other verb suffixed by a motion verb or by stating the object and the gerundial form of another motion verb.

The predicate cannot be omitted from the main part of the sentence and occur only in the postpredicate position of the sentence. Furthermore, this is the only situation in which the direct object is omitted from the main part of the sentence. This construction emphasizes the purpose of the motion.

Examples 1. Machi ne; immal amine. 2. Machi ne; immal amie.

‗The boy is going to hunt (something).‘ ‗The boy is going to go hunting (something).‘

Exercise 12. Postpredicate position (predicate expansion) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Machi nad; immal aminad.

Student: Machi nad; immal aminad.

1. Machi nad; immal aminad.

‗The boy went to hunt.‘

2. Ome ne; mol pakne.

‗The woman is going to buy cloth.‘

3. Tad nad; aros taknad.

‗The elder went to look after (his) rice.‘

4. 0me tani; mol maktani.

‗The woman is coming to sew a blouse.‘

5. Pab nad; mas chiknad.

‗Father went to cut plantains.‘

Exercise 13. Postpredicate position (predicate expansion) drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it, expanding the predicate in the postpredicate position by selecting one of the suggested expansions below.

Example Teacher: Machi ne.

Student: Machi ne; ina komne.

Expansion

1. mas kun

‗to eat food‘

2. immal pak

‗to buy something/to shop‘

3. ina kob

‗to take/drink medicine‘

Statement

1. Machi ne.

‗The boy is going to go.‘

2. Ome tani.

‗The woman is coming.‘

3. Tad ti.

‗The leader has been (somewhere).‘

4. Mu nad.

‗The old lady went.‘

Exercise 14. Postpredicate position (gerund) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Machi ti; mas chike. Student: Machi ti; mas chike.
1. Machi ti; mas chike. 2. Pun nad; mol make. 3. Ome tani; mas kunne.

‗The boy has been cutting plantains.‘ ‗The girl went to sew a blouse (lit.: blouse sewing).‘ ‗The woman is coming to eat (lit.: food eating).‘

18.4 Grammar

253

4. Tad ne; karta nermake. 5. Machi arpi; ina kobe.

‗The elder is going to go to write a letter (lit.: letter writing).‘
‗The boy went (and returned) to take medicine (lit.: medicine drinking).‘

Exercise 15. Postpredicate position (gerund) transform drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it, expanding the predicate by using the gerundial form of the verb from the suggested list below in the postpredicate position.

Example Teacher: Machi ne.

Student: Machi ne; mas chike.

Expansion

1. mas chik

‗to cut plantains‘

2. mas kun

‗to eat plantains‘

3. mol mak

‗to sew a blouse‘

Statement

1. Machi ne.

‗The boy is going to go.‘

‗The woman went.‘

3. Pun ti.

‗The girl has been (somewhere).‘

4. Mu tani.

‗The older woman is coming.‘

2) Predicate may be highlighted/clarified by stating the verb in the main clause and by stating an adverb or goal of action with or without the verb in the postpredicate position
The predicate may be highlighted/clarified by stating any verb in the main clause and by stating only an adverb in the postpredicate position. It may also be clarified by stating an adverb or goal of motion and repeating the verb in the postpredicate position. Note carefully that verbs which occur in the main clause using -bal/-pal or -mo cannot be highlighted/clarified in this way.

Examples 1. Machi ne; kueye-kueye ne. 2. Machi nade; negzhe nade. 3. Pab ye; ichejul ye. 4. Tad arpanai; pinna- pinna arpanai.

‗The boy is going to go quickly.‘ ‗The boy went home.‘ ‗Father is very sick.‘ ‗The elder is working very slowly.‘

Exercise 16. Postpredicate position (predicate adverbial expansion) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Exercise 18. Postpredicate position (predicate adverbial expansion) drill
Do Exercise 17, repeating the predicate in the postpredicate position.

Example

Teacher: Machi ne. Student: Machi ne; kueye ne.

3) Predicate may be stated in a generic form in the main clause and in a specific form in the postpredicate position
The predicate may be stated in a generic form accompanied by the generic form of the direct object in the main clause, and then stated in a specific form accompanied by the specific form of the direct object in the highlighting/clarifying position. In using this form of the predicate, you must be extremely careful to select a generic form of the verb which is compatible with the specific form of the verb. For example, you cannot use che ‗to do‘ in the main clause with the verb kun ‗to eat‘ in the postpredicate position.

The form of the verb in the postpredicate position may be either the same as the form of the generic verb, or it may be in the gerundial form.

Examples 1. Ome immal chene; mol makne. or 2. Ome immal chene; mol make.

‗The woman is going to sew a blouse.‘ ‗The woman is (in the act of) sewing a blouse.‘

Situational Explanation

19 KUNA SPEECH TYPES

19.1 Monologue
Kuna leaders regularly call the people together in the meeting house. There they make speeches, giving instructions to their people about their traditions and way of life.

The chief is speaking to the people in the meeting house.

1. Immisde an pemalga chunmane; tulemal nued nanemal.
2. Nuekwá tiil, ¿ip nuedchulchi? 3. Anmal pel napíra tiil ip nueganbi. 4. Tule nanga ip choge nikchulil, saglagan
ip choge nikchul. 5. Kwendin yoskudago; immal aturchedi,
immal chikedi, yosku nanedi, anmal kwen peichuli.
6. Napíra tiil ip nuedi. 7. Te choggudin nue itomal. The chief goes on with his speech.

‗Now I‘m going to talk to you (about) people behaving well.‘
‗When (we) walk well, it is a good thing, is it not?‘
‗When we all behave correctly, everything (is) well.‘
‗When people have nothing to say against me, the leaders have nothing to say (against me).‘
‗Some (people) will come (to the place where they) err, such as stealing something, cutting something (which belongs to another), or behaving badly, we don‘t want any of that.‘
‗When walking correctly, it is good.‘
‗Then I say, listen well, ...‘

19.2 Pronunciation (Ex. 1–4)
Each type (genre) of speech (discourse) has its own intonation pattern. Monologue 19.1 is an example of a teaching type of speech.
Exercise 1. Intonation drill
Hum the intonation patterns of Monologue 19.1 as the teacher says the monologue.
Exercise 2. Mimicking drill
Mimic the teacher as he says Monologue 19.1. Try to keep pace with the teacher as he says the monologue and mimic the intonation patterns to the best of your ability.
Exercise 3. Intonation of teaching speech
Practice the intonation pattern of Sentence 5 of Monologue 19.1 until this teaching intonation pattern is mastered.
Exercise 4. Problem solving drill
Discuss and drill any problem areas of intonation in Exercises 1 through 3 above.

19.3 Culture
There are four levels of language in Kuna speech:

1. colloquial speech

(informal speech)

2. chunmaked

‗(formal speech)‘

3. namaked

‗(chants)‘

4. kolmaked

‗(shouting chants)‘

The kolmaked is used exclusively in certain ceremonies.

257

258

Kuna Speech Types

Traditionally, Kuna chiefs have chanted the instructions and insights into the culture which they have given their people in meetings. The chants (namaked) are couched in archaic and figurative language which is difficult for the majority of the people to understand. One person, the arkal, is appointed to the task of repeating the chief‘s chant in more understandable, though formal, language (chunmaked), so that the people will understand what was being taught.
In some areas, chanting is dying out. In these areas the leaders talk directly to the people.

19.4 Grammar

19.4.1 Obligation (Ex. 5–6)
Obligation parallels the English construction, ―ought to ...‖ or ―have to ...‖. This concept is expressed by adding the obligatory suffix -nab to the long form of the verb stem.

Example Nuskan e pabgan atakenab.

‗Children ought to respect their parents.‘

Exercise 5. Obligation frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise may be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: Ome mas tuenab. Student: Ome mas tuenab.
1. Ome mas tuenab. 2. An nenab. 3. Pe an pennukenab. 4. Nuskan e pabgan atakenab. 5. Pe anka chogenab.

‗The woman has to cook the food.‘ ‗I have/ought to go.‘ ‗You have to pay me.‘ ‗Children ought to respect their parents.‘ ‗You need to tell me.‘

Exercise 6. Obligation stimulus response drill
The teacher asks the question and the student replies using the obligation -nab form.

Example Teacher: ¿Pe ne? Student: Antin nenab.
1. ¿Pe ne? 2. ¿Pe kai chune? 3. ¿Pe saglaga chogo? 4. ¿Pe neg chomne? 5. ¿Pe ina too?

‗Are you going?‘ ‗Are you going to fetch sugar cane?‘ ‗Will you tell the chief?‘ ‗Are you going to build a house?‘ ‗Will you take (swallow) the medicine (pills)?‘

19.4.2 Non-obligatory expressions Several adverbial expressions may be used to indicate that an action was done without obligation or duress.

19.4.2.1 an/pe/a itoleged „my/your/his/hers/its own desire (lit.: feeling)‟

Example Machi a itoleged nad.

‗The boy went of his own desire.‘

19.4.2.2 pinche „just (without duress or purpose)‟
When used to refer to an action executed without duress it is generally said with a disclaimer intonation (see 6.2.2).

19.4 Grammar

259

Example Machi pinche yogal pakcha. ‗The boy just bought the shirt (on a whim).‘

19.4.2.3 naga/aga tukin „of my/one‟s own free will‟ naga/aga tukin ‗of my/one‘s own free will‘ is further discussed in Section 20.4.6.2.

Example Punadin aga tukin mol ukcha.

‗The girl sold the blouse herself (of her own volition).‘

19.4.3 Futility
An event or action may be perceived as being done in vain. This concept of futility is expressed by the adverb pinche ‗in vain/for nothing‘ which, in this usage, normally occurs at the beginning of the sentence.

Examples

1. Pinche an ti.

‗I went for nothing.‘

2. Pinche an ul chobzha.

‗I might as well have not made the canoe.‘

However, when used as an adverb of futility, pinche occasionally occurs in the adverbial position.

Example Antin pinche mani amidi. ‗I went in vain for the money.‘
Pinche can also mean ‗just (for no reason/purpose)‘. Intonation, context and word order provide clues to which meaning it has.

19.4.3.1 Intonation clue
A disclaimer intonation (see 6.2.2) indicates ―just (without real purpose)‖ whereas a frustrated intonation indicates the sense of ―in vain‖.

19.4.3.2 Contextual clue
If the speaker has indicated that some purpose gave rise to the action, the word pinche would have an ―in vain‖ connotation. If you surmise from the context that the action had no specific purpose, the connotation of pinche is ―just (for no reason/purpose)‖.

19.4.3.3 Word order clue When pinche occurs at the beginning of a sentence, it invariably means ―in vain‖.

19.4.4 Ability (Ex. 7–9)
Expressions which deal with a person‘s ability to carry out an action parallel the English expression, ―to be able to....‖ In Kuna, various words are used to describe innate ability, capacity to perform, and an acquired skill.

19.4.4.1 Ability in the five senses (innate ability)
The five basic senses are described in Kuna by two verbs: tak ‗to see‘ (atak ‗to look at‘) and ito ‗to hear/feel/taste/smell‘. The ability to use the senses is expressed by the use of the verb mag ‗to be able to‘ which usually precedes the verb of sense.

Examples

1. Machi toto mag take.

‗The little boy is able to see.‘

2. Machi mag atak.

‗The boy is able to look at (things).‘

3. Punadin mag ito.

‗The girl can hear/feel/smell/taste.‘

Conversely, innate inability to use the senses is expressed by aku ‗to be unable to‘.

Examples 1. Punadin aku immal tak. 2. Machidin aku ito.

‗The girl is blind (unable to see anything).‘
‗The boy doesn‘t understand/hear (lit.: unable to understand/hear). The boy is deaf.‘

260

Kuna Speech Types

19.4.4.2 Capacity to perform an action
One may have the capacity to perform an action, but actually carrying it out may depend on the desire of the actor. To express the capacity to perform an action, the adverb nabir ‗to be able‘ is used before the action verb. Conversely, the adverb keg ‗to be unable to‘ indicates that the actor has the capacity to perform the action but for some reason he is unable to do so in a given situation.

Examples

1. Mimmi nabir nane.

‗The little girl can walk.‘

2. Machi keg pe pentako.

‗The boy will be unable to help you.‘

Nabir ‗to be able to‘ and keg ‗to be unable to‘ are also used referring to permission: nabir ‗to be allowed/permitted to‘ or keg ‗to not be allowed/pemitted to‘.

Examples 1. Machergandin nabir we tak. 2. Omegandin keg we tak; izhe.

‗The men are allowed to look at that.‘ ‗The women are not allowed to look at that (it is forbidden).‘

19.4.4.3 Learned ability
Where knowledge is a prerequisite for performance, the verb wis ‗to know how to‘ is used. Conversely, wichul ‗to not know how to‘ is used to indicate lack of knowledge. Wis/wichul(i) may be used alone or together with a verb specifying the skill. The short form of the verb stem specifying the skill is used.

Examples 1a. ¿Punadin wis mas tu? b. ¿Wis, (adin)? 2a. ¿Machidin wis tomoma? b. Wichul. 3. Taddin wis neg chob. 4. Machidin wichul kammu ogol.

‗Does the girl know how to cook?‘ ‗(She) knows.‘ ‗Does the boy know how to swim?‘ ‗(He) does not know how.‘ ‗The elder knows how to build a house.‘ ‗The boy doesn’t know how to play the flute.‘

Exercise 7. Ability frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise may be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: An tule kaka mag ito.

Student: An tule kaka mag ito.

1. An tule kaka mag ito.

‗I can understand Kuna.‘

2. Machi chikwi mag take.

‗The boy can recognize the bird.‘

3. Pabzhel aku ito.

‗Grandfather can‘t hear.‘

4. Wag aku atak.

‗The outsider is blind (unable to look).‘

5. Mimmi nabir nane.

‗The baby girl can walk.‘

6. Machergan nabir immal tak.

‗Men are allowed to see it.‘

7. Machi keg pe pentako.

‗The boy won‘t be able to help you.‘

8. Puna keg mol uko.

‗The girl can‘t sell the blouse.‘

9. Puna wis mas tu.

‗The girl knows (how) to cook.‘

10. Kil wis kammu ogol.

‗Uncle knows (how) to play the flutes.‘

11. Antin wichul motor onane.

‗I don‘t know (how) to operate the outboard motor.‘

12. Pedro wichul ul chob.

‗Peter doesn‘t know (how) to make a canoe.‘

Exercise 8. Ability stimulus response drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student replies using mag, aku, nabir, or keg as the situation requires.

19.4 Grammar

261

Example Teacher: Machi itos. Student: Machi aku itos.
1. Machi itos. 2. Machimal puna takne. 3. Tule ua kun. 4. Wag challi mejo. 5. Ome wag kaka ito.

‗The boy understood.‘ ‗The boys are going to see the girl.‘ ‗People eat fish.‘ ‗The outsider will kill the woodpecker.‘ ‗The woman understands Spanish.‘

Exercise 9. ‗(Don‘t) know how to‘ stimulus response drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student replies using wis/wichul

Example Teacher: Tad ul chobzha. Student: Tad wis ul chob.
1. Tad ul chobzha. 2. Machi kammu ogolne. 3. Puna mol nermas. 4. Pab karpa chobzha. 5. Nan kachi chobo.

‗The elder made a canoe.‘ ‗The boy is going to play the flutes.‘ ‗The girl drew the design on the blouse.‘ ‗Father made a basket.‘ ‗Mother will make a hammock.‘

19.4.5 Consequence of action (Ex. 10–11)
Certain actions or events result in succeeding event(s) as a consequence of the situation which they bring about. The succeeding event is introduced in English by the phrase ―and consequently‖. Generally speaking, in Kuna, the first event is stated in one sentence and the consequential event is stated in the next sentence which begins with the conjunction tegin ‗and then‘. The consequential suffix -chun/-zhun/-jun111 is added to the verb.

Examples 1. Sagla maichuli. 2. Tegin antin kannan negzhe nadzhun.

‗The chief was not home.‘ ‗Consequently I went back home.‘

Exercise 10. -chun/-zhun/-jun frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc. This exercise may be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: An nadzhun. Student: An nadzhun.
1. An nadzhun. 2. Wagi ob machun. 3. Ome upchan purenaichun. 4. An karta nermanejun. 5. An mas kunnejun.

‗So I left.‘ ‗So the parrots ate the corn.‘ ‗So the woman is spinning the cotton.‘ ‗So I‘m going to write a letter.‘ ‗So I‘m going to eat (some) food.‘

Exercise 11. -chun/-zhun/-jun substitution frame drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it substituting it in the frame.

Example Teacher: An kannan nadbal.

Student: An yannu mecha. Tegin an kannan nadbalchun.

Frame An yannu mecha. Tegin ____-chun. ‗I killed a peccary. So then ____.‘

1. An kannan nadbal.

‗I went back again.‘

2. An negzhe yannu ches.

‗I carried the peccary home.‘

111 The final n of the consequential suffix is a fortis consonant nn written as n by convention.

262

Kuna Speech Types

3. An yannu pid makchabal. 4. An pega chan uktani 5. An chapurbal yannu ebes.

‗I shot another peccary too.‘ ‗I‘m bringing you meat.‘ ‗I left the peccary in the jungle.‘

19.4.6 Causative (Ex. 12)
A causative action is one which the subject causes someone else to perform; it parallels the English construction ―to cause (someone) to‖. In Kuna, the causative is formed by adding the causative prefix o- to the verb stem. Most, although not all, verbs may use the causative prefix. Certain related concepts which in English are expressed by two separate verbs, are expressed in Kuna by the verb and by the verb plus the causative prefix.

Examples
1a. turta b. odurta112 2a. kun b. okun 3a. kob b. ogob113 4a. Kallen oge. b. Kallen okin.

‗to learn‘ ‗to teach (lit.: to cause to learn)‘ ‗to eat‘ ‗to feed (lit.: to cause to eat)‘ ‗to drink‘ ‗to give a drink (lit.: to cause to drink)‘ ‗Light the lamp./Switch on the light.‘ ‗Put out the lamp./Switch off the light.‘

Exercise 12. o- substitution frame drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it using the causative o- form in the frame.

Example Teacher: An ti kobo.

Student: An machi ti ogobo.

Frame An machi ____ o-____.

‗I ____ cause the boy to ____.‘

1. An ti kobo.

‗I‘ll drink water.‘

2. An ua kucha.

‗I ate fish.‘

3. An turtane.

‗I‘m going to learn.‘

4. An tomomanai.

‗I am swimming.‘

5. An nane.

‗I walk.‘

19.4.7 Causative commands
The formation of commands which cause another person to do an action varies according to the type of verb used.

19.4.7.1 Intrinsically causative verbs Verbs which are intrinsically causative may be used in causative commands without affixation.

Example Anche machi palmidago.

‗Send the boy to me (lit.: make the boy come to me).‘

19.4.7.2 Verbs with a causative form Verbs with a causative form (see 19.4.6) may also be used in a causative command.

112 t initial becomes lenis d in odurta ‗to teach‘. 113 k initial becomes lenis g in ogob ‗to cause to drink‘.

19.4 Grammar

263

Example Machi ina ogobo.

‗Make the boy drink the medicine.‘

19.4.7.3 Verb ima „to make‟ in causative command
If a verb is not intrinsically causative and has no causative form, the imperative form of the verb ima ‗to make‘ is used. The purpose suffix -gal/-kal is added to the verb which is to be carried out. The action verb plus -gal/-kal is followed by the actor and subsequently by imako ‗make‘.

Example

(Pe) neg chobgal machi imako.

‗(You) make the boy build the house.‘

Note the difference in word order. In this example, machi, the one caused to do the action, precedes ―to make‖ while the object of building occurs in the normal order for a direct object. On the other hand, in the example for Exercise 12, machi occurs in the normal order for an indirect object but without the suffix -ga/-ka.

19.4.7.4 Prevention of causative action
To prevent an action from being caused, the word melle ‗do not‘ is used to begin the causative command sentence.

Examples 1. Melle machi palmidago. 2. Melle machi ina ogobo. 3. Melle neg chobgal machi imako.

‗Don‘t send the boy.‘ ‗Don‘t make the boy drink the medicine.‘ ‗Don‘t make the boy build the house.‘

19.4.8 Impersonal passive suffix -le/-lle (Ex. 13)
The impersonal passive construction in which the actor (agent) is not named parallels the English construction as in, ―The boy was cut‖. It is formed by adding the passive suffix -le/-lle to the short form of the verb stem. -le/lle precedes such verbal suffixes as -cha/-zha/-ja and -ne and -al. The lenis consonant -le follows a lenis consonant or a vowel. The fortis consonant -lle follows a fortis consonant but is written as a single -le by convention. It is important to note the difference between -le/-lle ‗impersonal passive‘ and the conditional suffix -le ‗if‘ which attaches to the long form of the verb stem or preceding suffix and occurs after aspect and most other verbal suffixes. Because the conditional suffix attaches to the long form of the verb (i.e., follows a vowel) a fortis form does not occur.
Example
Machimal chiklesmalbalile, an pe odurtako. ‗If the boys are cut again, I will punish you.‘ In this example, the first -le is the passive suffix, and the second is the conditional suffix.

19.4.8.1 Passive suffix -le/-lle with completed aspect -s The short form of the completed aspect -s often occurs with the passive suffix -le/-lle.

Examples 1. Machi chikles. 2. Koe makles.

‗The boy was/is cut.‘ ‗The deer was/is shot.‘

19.4.8.2 Pseudo-passive The passive suffix -le/-lle may be used alone with a verb stem or it may occur with the suffix -ge to form a pseudo-passive in which no specific event is referred to.
1) Passive suffix -le/-lle used alone
The passive suffix -le/-lle when used alone with the verb stem denotes the habitual aspect of a passive concept.

‗That is good (when) eaten.‘

2) Passive suffix -le/-lle used with -ge
The combination suffix -lege/-llege denotes quality.

Examples 1. We nugu kullege. 2. We mol nugu taklege.

‗That is good eating.‘ ‗That blouse is good looking.‘

Exercise 13. Passive -le frame drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it using the passive form -le.

Example Teacher: Mas tunai. Student: Mas tulenai.
1. Mas tunai. 2. Teob chog. 3. We kartagin nabir nerma. 4. Pato ukcha. 5. Esgin chikcha.

‗(I‘m) cooking food.‘ ‗That‘s what (he) says.‘ ‗You can write on that paper.‘ ‗(He‘s) already sold (it).‘ ‗(He) cut (it) with a machete.‘

19.4.9 Habitual behavior aspect
People have habitual patterns of behavior, doing certain actions frequently or with some degree of regularity. This habitual behavior is expressed by the addition of the suffix -da/-ta ‗behave habitually‘ to the verb stem.

Examples

1. An ua kunta.

‗I often/regularly eat fish.‘

2. An igeta.

‗I often/regularly forget.‘

This construction differs from the habitual aspect (see 10.4.9) in that it implies that an action is done with regularity, whereas the habitual aspect (without -da/-ta) refers to an act which is done and implies that there are other similar acts which are not done.

Example Antin ua kun, tenal an apa chan kunchul.

‗I (do) eat fish but I don‘t eat boa meat.‘

19.4.10 Past progressive suffix -ap ‘has/have been ____ing’ (Ex. 14)
An action may be viewed as past progressive, i.e., as having been in progress but now terminated, as illustrated by the English sentence, ―I have been swimming (said after one has left the water)‖. In the past progressive, the focus is on the activity and contrasts with a construction in which the focus is on the motion (going/coming) as illustrated by the sentence, An obti. ‗I have been to bathe.‘ (see 18.4.2). The past progressive is marked by the suffix -ap attached to the shortened verb stem.

Examples

1. An obap.

‗I have been bathing.‘

2. Ome mas chuap.

‗The woman has been fetching plantains.‘

3. An tulemalzhe ekisap.

‗I have been asking people.‘

An irregular occurrence of the past progressive suffix -ap is nagap ‗on foot‘ (see 14.4.8.2 note).

114 The verb kun/kunne ‗to eat‘ is irregular. Its short form ends in a fortis consonant which is written as a single consonant by convention. With the addition of the passive suffix -le/-lle the fortis suffix is used and the nn drops off to become kulle. Similarly, with the addition of the completive aspect -cha, kun/kunne ‗to eat‘ becomes kucha.

19.4 Grammar

265

When the past progressive suffix is added to the past form of the motion verb ne ‗to go‘, the resultant form natab115 ‗in the process of going/on (my) way‘ indicates that motion has already been initiated. The suffix -ap
does not occur with the motion verb tag ‗to come‘.

Example

A man is travelling from Paya to Pucuru. On the trail, someone asks where he is going.

1. Inquirer: ¿Pia ne?

‗Where are you going?‘

2. Traveller: Pukurche natab. ‗I am on my way to Pucuru.‘

Exercise 14. Past progressive -ap drill
The teacher asks the question and the student replies using the -ap form in the frame.

Example Teacher: ¿Pe ampak kallin pakne?

Student: Chuli. An pato kallin pakap.

Frame Chuli. An pato ____-ap. ‗No, I have already been ____.‘

1. ¿Pe ampak kallin pakne? 2. ¿Pe tibal omne?116

‗Are you going with me to buy chickens?‘ ‗Are you going to bathe at the river?‘

3. ¿Pe mas chikne?

‗Are you going to cut plantains?‘

4. ¿Pe tagar chwane?

‗Are you going to gather thatch?‘

5. ¿Pe ua makne?

‗Are you going to spear fish?‘

19.4.11 Naming
Even though there are cultural restrictions on eliciting and calling people by their Kuna name (see Section 4.3), you as an outsider will be asked your name. The noun/verb nuga ‗name/to name‘ is used to elicit or declare a name, to name a person or object, or to do something under someone‘s authority (―in the name of‖).

Examples 1. ¿Igi pe nuga? 2. Antin nug Pablo. 3. Antin, an machi Pedro nugzhas. 4. An sagla nuggin pega chog.

‗What is your name? (lit.: How are you named?)‘ ‗My name is Paul. (lit.: I am named Paul.)‘ ‗I called/named my son Peter.‘ ‗I tell you in the name of (under the authority of) the chief.‘

19.4.11.1 Other naming expressions
When a person is named or appointed to a position, the position to which he is appointed is stated as an indirect object, the name of the appointee is stated, followed by the verb odo ‗to cause to enter/appoint‘.

Example Tulemal saglaga Juan odos. ‗The people appointed John as chief.‘
When one person substitutes for another, the substitute is named first, followed by the name of the one substituted for, the adverb anal ‗instead of‘, the position treated as indirect object and the verb pei ‗to remain‘.

Example Pedro, Pablo anal tummadga pes.

‗Peter remained (was left) in charge in Paul‘s place.‘

19.4.11.2 ¿Igi pimal? „What do we/they call it?‟ This expression is used to ascertain the correct term/way of saying something, i.e., to elicit new language data.

115 Irregular. 116 The b of ob ‗to bathe‘ becomes m before the n, omne ‗to go to bathe‘.

266

Kuna Speech Types

19.4.11.3 ¿Wede igi nug? „What is its name?/What is it called?‟
This expression is used to identify the kind (species) of a plant, animal, bird, or fish. It is used to identify the creature, not to ascertain the correct way to say something.

19.4.12 Comparison (Ex. 15)
The comparison of people/objects/actions may be made on the basis of their similarities or their differences. Various constructions are used according to the qualities being compared.

19.4.12.1 Contrast
Contrast of one person/object with another or of the actions of two people is handled by adding the topic-establishing suffix -din/-tin to each of the items to be contrasted. Often the conjunction tenal ‗but‘ is used to join the two sentences of comparison.

Example Pedin ne. (Tenal) antin peine.

‗You (on one hand) are going. (But) I (on the other hand) am staying.‘

19.4.12.2 Difference
When two people/objects are different but only one is mentioned overtly, the adverb akal ‗different‘ is used. It may be used in stative and non-stative sentences; it may be repeated to indicate ―all different kinds‖ as in akal-akal ‗all different kinds‘.

Examples 1. Itidin wis akal. 2. We yannudin akal. 3. Immalmal akal-akal chapurbal nika.
4. Ome mol akal-akal nika.

‗This one is slightly different.‘ ‗That peccary is different.‘ ‗There are all different kinds of animals in the jungle.‘ ‗The woman has all different kinds of cloth.‘

19.4.12.3 Similarity
The adverb yopí ‗the same‘ is used to describe a person/object which remains unchanged. It may be used alone without naming the person/object when the reference is obvious from the context.

Examples

1. Wedin yopí takle.

‗That looks (exactly) the same.‘

2. Ampa yopí.

‗(It is) still the same.‘

The suffix forms -yob(i) ‗like‘ or -yopí ‗exactly like‘ may be added to the noun or pronoun to which a person or object is being compared.

Examples 1. Pe machi peyopí takle. 2. Pedin tuleyob chunma.

‗Your son looks exactly like you.‘ ‗You speak like (a) Kuna.‘

19.4.12.4 Same size comparison
A person/thing may be said to be the same size as another by adding the suffix -un ‗as big/little as‘ to the person/thing to which the subject is compared.

Examples 1. Pedrodin e pabun. 2. Maríadin e nanun kudani.

‗Peter is as big as his father.‘ ‗Mary is getting as big as (her) mother.‘

19.5 Vocabulary

267

19.4.12.5 Degrees of comparison
In English, degrees of comparison are made by comparing one person/thing to another by means of an adjective. Two persons/things may be compared by using the suffix -er or the word ―more‖ attached to the adjective (e.g., ―bigger‖). A comparison may be made between three or more people/objects by adding the suffix -est or the word ―most‖ to the adjective (e.g., ―biggest‖).

In Kuna, degrees of comparison are made by using the word pul ‗more/most‘ which precedes the attribute (adjective) being compared. The person/object compared occurs first in the sentence, with or without the topic-establishing suffix -din/-tin. The person/object with whom/which it is compared is accompanied by the indirect object suffix -ga/-ka which, in this instance, parallels English ―than.‖ Or, as in Example 3 below, the person/object with whom/which it is compared may be omitted.

Examples

1. Antin chowid.

‗I am tall.‘

2. Antin pega pul chowid.

‗I am taller than you.‘

3. Antin pul chowid.

‗I am the tallest.‘

4. Antin egmalga pul chowid.

‗I am taller than the rest.‘

The word pul ‗more/most‘ may be used also to modify the objects in a sentence expressing possession.

Example An pega pul mani nika.

‗I have more money than you.‘

Exercise 15. Comparison drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student compares the subject of the sentence to Peter, substituting the correct form of the sentence in the frame.

Example Teacher: Pablo chowid.

Student: Pablo Pedroga pul chowid.

Frame ____ Pedroga pul ____.

1. Pablo chowid.

‗Paul is tall.‘

2. Machi kalla.

‗The boy is thin.‘

3. Tad chered.

‗The elder is old.‘

4. Tule mani nika.

20.2 Pronunciation (Ex. 1–4)
The purpose of this section is to help the student enhance his storytelling style. What can be accomplished in class in this area is limited, however, features of style can be pointed out and discussed. Practice outside the classroom is essential.
Note the intonation features of the introduction to the story. Note how to build suspense by pausing at intervals. Practice the drama of the climax and the wind-down of the story.
Exercise 1. Tracking drill
Track the teacher as he tells the folktale, keeping within two or three syllables at all times.
Exercise 2. Tracking drill
Track the teacher as he tells other short folktales. Try to pick out features which you will be able to practice incorporating into your own storytelling.
Exercise 3. Oral reading of folktales
Students should take turns reading the folktale consecutively in order to practice correct intonation and gestures.
Exercise 4. Problem drill
The teacher should discuss and demonstrate any portions of the folktale which the students found particularly difficult to master.
20.3 Culture
Although there is much that is universal in the environment of human beings anywhere in the world, there is much that is different, and even similar phenomena may be perceived differently. Hence, culture has a different set of criteria for classifying the various phenomena in its inanimate and animate surroundings. The Kuna classification of the universe varies from both English and Spanish classifications.
The universe is divided into three parts: neg nikpa ‗heavens (lit.: world above)‘, napa ‗the earth‘, and neg ulpalid ‗nether world (lit.: world below)‘. Both neg nikpa and neg ulpalid are considered to have eight levels. Birds and planes are said to fly nappali ‗near the earth‘ or neg magadbal ‗in the sky‘. The concept of underground is expressed by nap ulak ‗below the ground‘. Within napa ‗the earth‘ both inanimate and animate objects are referred to by the generic term immal ‗things‘. This term is also used as the generic term for inanimate things, whereas the generic term for animate beings is a modified form: tulad immal; plant life is referred to as pulgan ina. Animate creatures, tulad immal, are divided into tule ‗people‘ and immal tul ‗non-human living things‘.
Tule ‗people‘ are sub-divided into two main groups: tule ‗people‘, which refers primarily to the Kunas themselves and secondarily, to other Indian groups; and wag(a) ‗outsiders‘.
Wag(a) ‗outsiders‘ are again sub-divided into three groups; wag(a) ‗Latins, including southern Europeans‘, merki ‗North Americans and northern Europeans‘, and igles ‗West Indians‘.
Immal tul ‗non-human life‘ is divided into three groups: immal (tul)119 tigined ‗water creatures‘, immal (tul) napkined ‗land creatures‘, and immal (tul) kukualed ‗flying creatures‘.
It is the sub-divisions under the immal tulad that vary most from English/Spanish divisions. Reptiles are classified according to where they spend their time. Consequently, taim ‗alligator‘ and tin ‗caiman‘ are

119 tul may be stated or omitted.

272

Classifications

classified as immal tigined ‗water creatures‘, whereas nakpe ‗snake‘ is classified as immal napkined ‗land creature‘.

ua ‗fish‘ are classified as immal tigined ‗water creatures‘; in the generic sense ua covers fish and crustaceans such as tulub ‗lobster‘, pusku ‗shrimp‘, and poi ‗snails‘. ua ‗fish‘ may be divided into termal ua ‗sea fish‘ and tiwal ua ‗river fish‘. Another classification is: ua tutud ‗soft fish‘, i.e., fish with skin and scales, and ua chelled ‗hard fish‘, i.e., fish with hard shells such as the arki ‗huacuco‘.

Non-food items tend to be divided into generic classifications such as chikwi ‗small birds‘ or achu ‗carnivorous animals (generic)‘.120 Within these classifications, many of the animals have specific names such as kwili
‗parakeet‘ or achu parpat ‗jaguar‘.

Edible creatures, on the other hand, tend to be referred to by specific, rather than generic terms, e.g., koe ‗deer‘ and chigli ‗wild turkey‘.

Insects are usually referred to as immal ‗things‘ or by a specific name if one exists, e.g., kenu ‗ticks‘ and kwi ‗mosquitos‘. They are not subdivided into flying/land/water classifications. Plants are classified as chapi ‗trees‘, tub ‗vines‘ or kagan ‗shrubs and smaller plants‘.

Inanimate things may be divided on the basis of what they are made of, what they are used for, or their usual location.

Examples

1a. immal ezhagad

‗things of iron/steel‘

b. immal napkad

‗things of earthenware‘

c. immal olgad

‗things of gold‘

2a. immal chobgaled

‗things to make things with (tools)‘

b. immal tugaled

‗things to cook with‘

Another way of classifying all immal is by whether or not they are immal chapurbalid ‗things from the jungle‘ or not. This term refers primarily to jungle fauna, but also may refer to jungle flora.

120 Where a word in Kuna has both specific and generic meanings, the specific sense is the one which a Kuna speaker generally thinks of first, for example, achu ‗dog‘.

20.4 Grammar
20.4.1 Pronouns Although there is a brief discussion of pronouns in Lesson I, there are several other pronominal forms not yet mentioned and other aspects of pronominal usage important for the language learner.
20.4.1.1 Third-person pronouns Third-person pronouns are used to refer to people or objects, and the rules for using each of the different third-person forms are quite different from English or Spanish.
1) Topical third-person pronoun
When the third-person pronoun refers to the topic of conversation, the specific pronoun is determined by its function in the sentence.
273

274

Classifications

a) Topical subject When the topic of conversation is the subject of the sentence, ad(e) ‗he/she/it‘ or amal(a) ‗they‘ is used.

Examples 1. ¿Ade pia nad? 2. Amal pato nanmal.

‗Where did he go?‘ ‗They‘ve already left.‘

b) Topical non-subject
When the topic of conversation is not the subject of the sentence, the third-person pronoun tar is used plus the appropriate suffix if one is required.

Example An targa chogzha.

‗I said to him.‘

2) Non-topical third-person pronoun
When the subject is not the topic, it is possible to leave out the pronouns which refer to the subject. Elsewhere in the sentence a non-topic element may be referred to by a pronoun.

a) Non-subject, non-topic in the first-person narrative
In first-person narrative, the third-person pronoun ne accompanied by the appropriate suffix is used everywhere in the subject position.

Examples 1. An ne mecha. 2. An nega chog.

‗I killed it.‘ ‗I said to him.‘

b) Non-subject, non-topic in third-person narrative In third-person narrative, the pronoun te is used to refer to the direct object.

Examples

1. Pablo te mecha.

‗Paul killed it (that same one).‘

2. An te ukcha.

‗I sold it (that same one).‘

In the case of the indirect object, the indirect object suffix -ga occurs alone without an accompanying pronoun.

Example Luis ga chogal.

‗Louis began to say to him.‘

3) Continuity of paragraph topic
The topic of a conversation (discourse) tends to occur as the subject of the sentences throughout the paragraphs that make up the conversation. Sometimes, however, the topic of the conversation becomes the direct or indirect object of a sentence. In English, the passive voice is used to indicate that the topic in that particular sentence is not the actor, ―John was hit by a car.‖

In Kuna, when the topic of the conversation becomes the direct/indirect object of one of the sentences, it is placed in the first position of the sentence and there is a slight pause before the remainder of the utterance is said. The third person pronoun tar accompanied by the appropriate suffix occurs in the object position.

Example Juan, achu tar kucha.

‗John was bitten by the dog.‘

When the topic of a paragraph is not the topic of the conversation nor the subject in a given sentence, it is placed at the beginning of the sentence followed by a slight pause; there is no pronoun in the object/indirect object position.

20.4 Grammar

275

Example Anita, achu kucha.

‗Anita was bitten by the dog.‘

20.4.1.2 Pronominal reference
In Kuna, a third-person pronoun can only be used once or twice before the noun to which the pronoun refers must be repeated. Where ambiguity could arise, the noun is preceded by te ‗that same‘ to ensure that the listener realizes the reference is to the same person/object as before.

Example Ome noni. Te omedina, Luis e nan itos.

‗A woman arrived. That same woman (is) Louis‘ mother (you) understand.‘

20.4.1.3 Subject in indirect speech
In indirect speech, the person being quoted is referred to by the pronoun ede or e plus the appropriate suffix. The suffix -chog/-zhog/-jog attaches to the verb which describes the action of the person under discussion (see 15.4.3).

Examples 1. Ede nejog. 2. Sagla chog Pedro, ede ne(jog).

‗(He) said (that) he is going.‘ ‗The chief said that Peter was going.‘

20.4.2 First-person exclusive subject pronoun The first-person exclusive pronoun nan121 is used by the speaker to refer to himself and those accompanying him in an action, but to exclude the people/person to whom he is speaking. When the addressee is included, the suffix -mal is added to the first-person pronoun an.

Examples 1. Nanmal pato mas kucha. 2. Anmal pato mas kucha.

‗We (not you) already ate the food.‘ ‗We (including you) already ate the food.‘

20.4.3 Demonstratives
Demonstratives are used to point out a person/thing to whom/which the speaker is referring, in a manner similar to the English demonstratives ―this‖ and ―that.‖

In Kuna, they may be used in isolation as pronouns or as adjectives preceding the noun to which they refer; or they may be suffixed and function as adverbs. They have a restricted use in discourse situations.

There are four demonstrative pronouns in Kuna: iti, we, a and te. Iti ‗this‘ and we ‗that‘ are used to refer to people/things that are within seeing distance of the speaker (in the speaker‘s presence), a ‗that‘ refers to a person/thing outside the speaker‘s setting (presence), and te ‗that same‘ is used to reinforce a back reference and confirm that the same person/object is being referred to as was previously mentioned.

The demonstratives frequently occur at the beginning of a sentence, since the item they refer to is often topic.

Examples 1. Iti (mol) an pakne. 2. We (mol) an pakchul. 3. A (tule) odurtalegenab. 4. ... ¿Ibi nika tede?
5. Pe iti uko.

‗I am going to buy this (blouse) (which is right here).‘ ‗I won‘t buy that (blouse) (over there).‘ ‗That person (who is not here) should be punished.‘ ‗... What‘s wrong with that (person about whom we have been talking)?‘ ‗Sell this.‘

121 The final n of nan is fortis nn but is written as a single letter by convention (see 2.2.3.4 footnote 8).

276

Classifications

20.4.3.1 Demonstrative adjectives
A demonstrative used as an adjective precedes the noun to which it refers. Often this person/item is not only topic, but is also being singled out or contrasted with another. In this case, the noun is suffixed with the topic marker -tin/-din (see Appendix E).

Examples 1. Iti moldin nued. 2. We esdin nugal nika. 3. Pe we tulega chogo.

‗This blouse (is) good.‘ ‗This machete (is) sharp.‘ ‗Tell that person (over there).‘

20.4.3.2 Demonstrative adverbs
The locative suffixes -gin/-kin and -bal/-pal (see Section 8.4) may be attached to any of the demonstrative pronouns to give the connotation of a narrow or broad setting adverb.

Examples 1. Es itigin mellemai. 2. Es wegin mellemai. 3. Es webal mellemai.

‗The machete is (lying around) right here.‘ ‗The machete is (lying around) right over there.‘ ‗The machete is (lying around) somewhere over there.‘

20.4.3.3 Forward and backward reference to demonstration The suffix -ob122 may be added to the demonstrative pronouns we ‗that‘ and te ‗that same‘ to express a concept similar to the English ―like that‖ or ―in that manner‖.

Weob ‗like this‘ is used to refer forward to what is going to be said or demonstrated, or to what has just been demonstrated. Teob ‗like that‘ is used to refer backwards to what was said.

Examples 1. Weob be imako. 2. Teob be imako.

‗Do it like this.‘ ‗Do it like that (as I told you).‘

20.4.3.4 Specific use of we and a in discourse
During a conversation or speech, that is to say, in discourse and in a written text, the demonstrative pronoun we ‗that‘ is used as an adjective before the noun plus suffix -din/-tin to refer to the topic under discussion. Non-topic people/things are referred to by the demonstrative pronoun a ‗that‘ before the noun. Te ‗that same‘ is used to refer to a previously mentioned non-topic item where ambiguity might arise from the use of several successive third-person pronouns. In such cases, the listener might understand the speaker to be introducing other actors/objects into the story.

Examples 1. We tuledin, tule nued. 2a. Machidin yannu takcha. b. A yannudin igalgin mellemai. c. Te yannudin purkwis, takcha.

‗That person (about whom we are speaking) is a good person.‘ ‗The boy saw a peccary.‘ ‗That peccary was sprawled out on the trail.‘ ‗That same peccary was dead, (you) see.‘

20.4.4 Indefinite and indeterminate pronouns

20.4.4.1 Indefinite pronouns
The third-person pronoun amal ‗they‘ (see 1.4.2 and 8 4.3) may be used to refer to unknown or unspecified people.

122 -ob(i) is a contracted form of -yob(i) ‗like‘ (see 19.4.12.3).

20.4 Grammar

277

Examples 1. ¿Toa chogzha? 2. Amal.

‗Who said (it)?‘ ‗They (unspecified) (did).‘

20.4.4.2 Indeterminate pronouns
In Paya Kuna, there are several universal or indeterminate pronominal forms. Meke toa tule ‗anyone‘ refers to all the people.

Example

Meke toa tule nabir kukualedgin tog.

‗Anybody may go into the (any) airplane.‘

Meke ibi tule ‗anyone (of a certain group)‘ refers to anyone from among a certain group.

Example

Meke ibi tule nabir togo.

‗Any (of them) may go in.‘

Another universal or indeterminate pronominal form is meke igi ‗however/in whatever way‘.

Example

Meke igi pe chobbiel, ampa tutujul.

‗Whatever way you might want to make it, it is still difficult.‘

Another universal or indeterminate pronominal form is meke pia ‗wherever‘.

Example

Meke pia an nao, an kwen tobzhul.

‗Wherever I go, I‘m not at all afraid.‘

Another universal or indeterminate pronominal form is meke inkwa ‗whenever‘.

Example Meke inkwa pe anche kolo.

‗Call me anytime.‘

20.4.5 Reference to group members Several words may be used to refer to one/various/all members of a group.

a. walgwen ‗a/one‘ is used to refer to a single person/thing who/which is part of a larger group.

Examples

1. Tule walgwen mai.

‗There was (lived) a person.‘

2. Tule walgwen noni.

‗A/one person arrived.‘

b. walgwenna ‗alone‘ refers to one person to the exclusion of others.

Example

Tule walgwenna noni.

‗The person arrived alone. (One lone person arrived.)‘

c. te ‗that same‘ (see 20.4.3) is used to refer to the same person(s)/thing(s) which was/were referred to previously.

Example

Te tule kannan nadbal.

‗That (same) person went back again.‘

d. wal-walgwen ‗some‘ is used to refer to some people/things from a group.

Example

Tule wal-walgwen yapa ne.

‗Some people don‘t want to go.‘

e. pid (pimalad) ‗another (others)‘ is used to describe others, not necessarily all others, from a group.

Examples 1. Tule pid noni. 2. Tule pimalad pes.

‗Another person arrived.‘ ‗(Still) others remained (behind).‘

278

Classifications

f. kwentin ... kwentin ‗some ... ; some ...‘ is used to contrast one sub-group with another sub-group.

Example

Kwentin ua kumpi; kwentin chuga.

‗Some (a group) want to eat fish; some (want to eat)

crab.‘

g. kwentin ... piddin/pimaladdin123 ‗some ... others ...‘ is usually used in a situation of a more marked contrast

between two parts of a group than is referred to by kwentin ... kwentin ‗some ... ; some ...‘.

Example

Kwentin ua kumpi tenal pimaladdin chul.

‗Some want to eat fish while others don‘t.‘

h. egmal ‗the rest/remainder‘ refers to the balance of the group.

Example Egmaldin kallin chan kumpi. ‗The rest want to eat chicken (meat).‘
i. pel/pel kwapa ‗all‘ refers to the entire group.

Example

Pel kwapa kabe kobzha.

‗Everyone/all drank coffee.‘

j. pelchal ‗almost all‘ includes all but a few of a group.

Example

Tule pelchal pukwa.

‗Almost everyone was there.‘

k. sate ‗nobody/nothing‘ excludes the entire group.

Example

Tule sate pe pentagal.

‗There is nobody to help you.‘

l. nikchulchal ‗almost no one/none‘ excludes all but a few from the group.

Example

Tule nikchulchal mani

‗Almost no people have money. (Almost no one has money.)‘

Another way of excluding the entire group is with the expression nikchul ‗not one‘.

Example Tule kwen nikchul pe pentagal.

‗There is not a single person to help you.‘

20.4.6 Reflexive pronouns
In Kuna, as in English, reflexive pronouns are used to indicate that an actor is doing an action to himself/herself/itself. Reflexive pronouns are also used in a construction which indicates volition. There are two reflexive pronouns: naga ‗myself‘ and aga ‗yourself/himself/herself/itself‘ and these follow the noun or pronoun referring to the subject of the sentence.

Examples 1. Antin naga chikcha. 2. ¿Pedin aga chikcha? 3. Machi aga chikcha.

‗I cut myself.‘ ‗Did you cut yourself?‘ ‗The boy cut himself.‘

20.4.6.1 Group marker with reflexive pronoun
When a reflexive pronoun is used to refer to a group of people/things who are doing the action to themselves, the group marker -mal (see 13.4.3) is added to the noun or pronoun which refers to the participants. It is also added to the verb.

123 kwentin, piddin and pimaladdin are formed by adding the topic-establishing suffix -din/-tin to an indefinite pronoun stem.

20.4 Grammar

279

Examples

1. Anmal naga pezhe chikchamal.

‗We (including you) cut ourselves badly.‘

2. Nanmal naga chikchamal.

‗We (excluding you) cut ourselves.‘

3. ¿Pemal aga chikchamal?

‗Did you (plural) cut yourselves?‘

4. Machimal aga chikchamal.

‗The boys cut themselves.‘

When the people in the group are acting reciprocally, i.e., doing the action to each other, the actors are stated with the group marker -mal. The third-person reflexive pronoun is followed by the repeated third-person pronoun which has the group marker -mal. The verb also has the group marker -mal added.

Examples

1. ¿Pemal aga emal-emal chikchamal?

‗Did you cut each other?‘

2. Machimal aga emal-emal chikchamal.

‗The boys cut each other.‘

3. Tulemal aga emal-emal chogalmal pede ‗The people said among themselves that you were a

tule nued.

good person.‘

When there are two actors acting one toward the other, the third-person reflexive pronoun is used. It is followed by the second participant in the action to which the accompaniment suffix -bak/-pak has been added. The group marker suffix -mal is added to the verb.

Example Pun aga machibak sakismal. ‗The girl and boy hit each other.‘

20.4.6.2 Volition
The Kuna construction which parallels the English phrase, ―of his own volition,‖ is expressed by using the appropriate reflexive pronoun followed by tukin (see 20.4.8).

Examples 1. An naga tukin nad. 2. Machi aga tukin es pakcha.

‗I went myself (of my own free will).‘ ‗The boy bought the machete himself (of his own volition).‘

20.4.7 Affirmation

20.4.7.1 Contrastive affirmation
A speaker may affirm one idea/action in contrast with another. For example, in the case of ―the youth doesn‘t know how to make a canoe, but the elder does,‖ the (village) elder‘s skill is affirmed in contrast to the youth‘s lack of experience. This concept is expressed in Kuna by the contrastive affirmation suffix -diji/-tiji.

Example Machi wichul ul chob tenal taddiji.

‗The youth doesn‘t know how to make a canoe but the elder does.‘

20.4.7.2 Emphatic affirmation
In English, a speaker may affirm that it was indeed the subject who did the action by stressing a reflexive pronoun which refers to the actor or he may affirm the carrying out of the verb by stressing the verb itself. The verb may also be affirmed by the use of an adverb such as ―really, truly, indeed.‖

In Kuna, the subject may be affirmed by adding the affirmation suffix -d(e)/-t(e) to the first-person and second-person pronoun subject and -de/-te to nouns referring to all other subjects. It may also be affirmed by the use of the adverb chunnad ‗(it was) really (I/you/he/we/they)‘.

Examples 1. Annid takcha. 2. ¿Ped takcha? 3. Machide takcha. 4. Ade takcha.

‗I saw (it) myself.‘ ‗Did you see (it) yourself?‘ ‗The boy saw it himself.‘ ‗He saw (it) himself.‘

280

Classifications

5. An chunnad takcha.

‗(It was) really I (who) saw (it).‘

The action may be affirmed by adding the affirmation suffix -de/-te to the verb or by using the adverb

chunchunnad ‗really/actually‘.

Examples 1. Anid takchade. 2. ¿Pe takchade? 3. An chunchunnad takcha.

‗I myself saw (it).‘ ‗You saw (it)?‘ ‗I really saw (it).‘

20.4.8 Contrary-to-fact (Ex. 5)
To this point in the discussion of Kuna grammar, most situations have been likely to come to pass or did, indeed, happen. There are times, however, when one needs to use expressions which parallel the English construction ‗had ... happened (although it did not)‘ or ‗I wish ... had happened (but it didn‘t)‘. Such situations are called condition contrary-to-fact or hypothetical situations. An example of an English contrary-to-fact sentence is, ―Had I gone, I would have gotten wet.‖ This is contrary-to-fact because the person did not go and did not get wet.
In Kuna, a condition contrary-to-fact sentence is formed by adding the contrary-to-fact suffix -n to the verbs in both the conditional and main clauses of a conditional sentence (see 14.4.5). Various shades of meaning are indicated by the use of different aspects and tenses in the main and subordinate clauses.
Many contrary-to-fact constructions are rare. For the purpose of this discussion, general principles are given to guide in the construction of contrary-to-fact expressions, and some of the more commonly-used constructions are listed by way of example.124

20.4.8.1 General principles used in construction of more common contrary-to-fact sentences

1) Conditional clause:

Main clause:

long form of completive aspect + -le + -n

completive aspect + -n

Examples

1. Pedro karpa ogujalen,

tazhi takchajulin.

‗If Peter had finished making the basket,

he would not have seen the possom.‘

2. An nadelen,

an wartikujan.

‗If I had gone,

I would have gotten wet.‘

3. Mas kuchalen,

imme itojan.

‗If he had eaten,

he would have felt full.‘

4. Machi eswal tub nikujalen,

ua chwajan.

‗If the boy had had fish line,

he would have gone fishing.‘

5. An Payche arpiilen,

Luis takchan.

‗If I had arrived at Paya,

I would have seen Louis.‘

2) Conditional clause:

Main clause:

long form of verb stem + -le + -n

long form of future + -n

Examples

1. Yannu takelen,

machi tar mejoen.

‗If he were to see a peccary,

the boy would kill it.‘

2. An neelen,

an wartikuoen.

‗If I were to go,

I would get wet.‘

124 Appendix L.

20.4 Grammar

281

3. An motor pin nikalen, ‗If I were to have a new motor,
3) Conditional clause:
long form of present progressive + -le + -n Examples
1. Pedro mas kunchiilen, ‗If Peter had remained (continued) eating,
2. Machi toto kammaiilen, ‗If the little boy had remained sleeping,
4) Conditional clause:
long form of stative verb + -le + -n Examples
1. José eswal nikalen, ‗If Joseph had a spear,
2. Mol webal naiilen, ‗If the blouse were hanging there,
5) Conditional clause:
long form (nee) of immediate future + -le + -n Examples
1. An mas kunneelen, ‗If (I) were going to eat,
2. An mol pakneelen, ‗If I were going to buy cloth,
6) Conditional clause:
long form of completive aspect + -le + -n Example
An ua pakchalen, ‗Were I to buy fish,

an Panamaje naoen I would go to Panama.‘
Main clause:
completive aspect + -n
kukualed takchajulin. he would not have seen the plane.‘ tadbak nadzhulin he would not have gone with Grandfather.‘
Main clause:
immediate future + -n
ua maknen he would go to spear fish.‘ wartikunen. it would get wet.‘
Main clause:
future (long form) + -n
naga mas chedoen. I would have brought food for myself.‘ an pega pakmogoen. I would have bought (some) for you, as well.‘
Main clause:
long form of future + -n
an pega ukoen. I would give you (some).‘

Exercise 5. Contrary-to-fact -n stimulus response drill

The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it changing it to a contrary-to-fact situation. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Example Teacher: An nel,125 an wartikuo.

Student: An neelen, an wartikuoen.

1. An nel, an wartikuo.

‗When I go I will get wet.‘

2. An ua pakchal, an pega uko.

‗When I have bought fish, I will give you (some).‘

3. An mol pakel, an mol kinnid pako.

‗When I buy cloth, I will buy red cloth.‘

4. Machi ua chwanel, pe nabir nao.

‗When the boy goes fishing, you may go.‘

5. María tub nikal, mol makne.

‗When Mary has thread, she is going to sew a blouse.‘

20.4.8.2 Polite contradiction
In Kuna, a polite contradiction of a statement parallels the English construction, ―If that had been true/so, (this) would have been fine/okay.‖

125 nel is a contracted form of the long form of nele.

282

Classifications

Example Nabiriddin126 nabirin.

‗It would be fine, if that were so.‘ (Lit.: ‗Were it fine, it would be fine.‘)

20.4.8.3 Wishing (optative)
The English concept of wishing is expressed in Kuna by the use of a contrary-to-fact conditional clause accompanied by the adverb nabirin ‗it would be good‘ in the main clause. This construction basically parallels the English expression ―It would be nice to/for ...‖ or ―I wish for/to ...‖. As in English, the Kuna optative construction is used in situations which are much less likely to materialize than are situations which employ the desiderative suffix -bi/-pi ‗to want to ...‘ (see Section 2.4.2).

Examples

1. An motor pin nikalen, nabirin.

‗I wish I had a new motor. (Lit.: If I were to have a new motor, it would be good.)‘

2. An motor pin nikujalen, nabirin.

‗I wish I had had a new motor. (Lit.: If I had had a new motor, it would have been good.)‘

3. An mas kuchalen, nabirin.

‗I wish had eaten. (Lit.: If I had eaten it would have been nice.)‘

The optative construction is also used to wish something for someone else and parallels the English construction, ―May you....‖

Examples 1. Pe nugujalen, nabirin. 2. Pab Tummad be nugu takelen, nabirin.

‗May you get well.‘
‗May God bless you. (Lit.: It would be well if God would look well on you.)‘

20.4.8.4 “Almost, but not quite”
An event which almost transpired, but did not, is described by using the immediate future suffix -ne followed by the contrary-to-fact suffix -n.

Examples 1. Machi iche napi purkwenen. 2. Mu aglenen.

‗The boy almost died.‘ ‗The old woman almost fell.‘

20.4.9 Past perfect aspect suffix -n
The past perfect aspect parallels the English construction, ―he had previously finished eating,‖ in contrast to the completive aspect which parallels, ―he finished eating.‖ The past perfect is formed by adding the suffix -n after the completive suffix. This -n should be distinguished carefully from the one occurring in contrary-to-fact constructions (see 20.4.8).

Example

Amal iktual pato mas kuchan.

‗They had already eaten beforehand.‘

Note that with the positional verbs nai, mai, ti, etc., the perfective form with -n means that the position has since terminated. In the case of the suffix form -nai, -di/-ti, etc., the action in progress has since terminated.

Examples 1. ¿Pia pe tin? 2. Pabdin main. 3. An mas kunnain.

‗Where had you been?‘ ‗Father had been home.‘ ‗I had been eating.‘

126 In this irregular case, the final n of nabirin becomes d before the suffix -din.

20.4 Grammar

283

20.4.10 Probability/possibility Events, actions, and people/things may be described in terms of probabilities or possibilities.

If an event is probably true/going to happen, the suffix -chulchi/-julchi ‗Is it not?‘ is added to the verb of the main sentence.

Examples

1. ¿Pe nejulchi?

‗You are going, are you not?‘

2. ¿Pabdin nadchulchi?

‗Father went, did he not?‘

When an action or noun (phrase) is described as a probability, the suffix -dewa/-tewa127 is added to the verb or

noun (phrase).

Examples

1. ¿Pe anka immal chedodewa?

‗Will you probably bring something for me?‘

2. An manigin uknedewa.

‗I‘m probably going to sell (it) for money.‘

3. An mol pakne; kinniddewa.

‗I‘m going to buy cloth; probably red cloth.‘

If something is a possibility and by no means certain, the suffix -dowa/-towa ‗possibly‘ is added to the appropriate verb or noun (phrase).

Examples

1. ¿Pe mol paknedowa?

‗Are you perhaps/possibly going to buy blouses?‘

2. An Pedro panamabal takodowa.

‗I will perhaps see Peter in Panama.‘

3. An wichi toa sagla palmine; Pedrodowa.

‗I don‘t know whom the chief is going to send, Peter perhaps.‘

The suffix -wa is also added to question words to indicate possibility.

Examples 1. ¿Pia? 2. ¿Inkwa? 3. ¿Ibi? 4. ¿Piawa? 5. ¿Inkwawa? 6. ¿Ibiwa?

‗Where?‘ ‗When?‘ ‗What?‘ ‗Where could it (possibly) be?‘ ‗When could it (possibly) happen?‘ ‗What‘s wrong? (Lit.: What possibly?)‘

20.4.11 Alternatives
The stating of alternatives in Kuna is complex: both of the alternatives are stated. Several ways are used to express alternatives.

20.4.11.1 Alternatives in postpredicate position
A main sentence, either a statement or question, which gives rise to the alternatives is stated with the probability/possibility suffix -dewa/-tewa attached to the verb. The two alternatives with the suffix -dewa/-tewa ‗perhaps‘ attached to each one, are stated in the postpredicate position. When the alternative is more remote the suffix -dowa/-towa is used.

Examples
1. Antin wichul inkwa tanidewa; pandewa (o)128 achuldewa.

‗I do not know when (he) is coming perhaps; perhaps tomorrow (or) perhaps the day after tomorrow.‘

127 The suffix -dibe/-tibe ‗perhaps‘ is used rarely in the Paya Kuna dialect although it is common in the San Blas dialect. It is limited to already hypothetical situations. For example, ¿Ibi an immal kaotibeye? ‗How could I perhaps catch something?‘ (see #13 of Section 20.1).
128 The Spanish o ‗or‘ has been borrowed into the language and is used often between alternatives.

2. An wichul; Pedro tanidowa (o) chuldowa. ‗I don‘t know; Peter is coming perhaps or not (perhaps)‘

20.4.11.2 Chulil
The adverb chulil ‗if not‘ may be used to express an alternative. In this case, two sentences are used; the first gives one alternative, the second begins with chulil and provides the other alternative.

Example Sagla pan noniko. Chulil, achul.

‗The chief will arrive tomorrow. If not, then the day after tomorrow.‘

20.4.11.3 Alternative choice
When a speaker is deciding on a choice of two actions or people, the choice is indicated by two questions; the first poses the choice involved with or without -dewa/-tewa, the second states the two alternatives each accompanied by -dewa/-tewa ‗perhaps‘.

Examples 1a. ¿Igi an chao? b. ¿An naodewa (o) chuldewa? 2a. ¿Toa an palmine(dewa)? b. ¿Pedrodewa (o) Pablodewa? 3a. ¿Mol igid an pako? b. Antin mol kinnid paknedewa (o) mol kollogwaddewa.

‗What shall I do?‘ ‗I should go perhaps or not perhaps?‘ ‗Whom should I send (perhaps)?‘ ‗Peter perhaps or Paul perhaps?‘ ‗What color (of) cloth will I buy?‘ ‗I will buy red cloth perhaps or yellow perhaps.‘

20.4.12 Types of text There are several types of text, each of which is used in a different setting and deals with different areas of types of speech.
20.4.12.1 Narrative text A narrative text relates events and stories of everyday life.
20.4.12.2 Explanatory text This type of text involves explanations and descriptions of situations or things. It is used to explain various aspects of the culture or tradition.
20.4.12.3 Argumentative text This type of text differs from the explanatory text in that it portrays pros and cons, and there is an attempt to convince the audience of accepting what is being proposed.
20.4.12.4 Hortatory text Hortatory texts are used in teaching and exhortation and not only involve the do‘s and don‘ts of everyday life, but also talk about the consequences of actions, good and bad.
20.4.12.5 Procedural text Procedural texts are step by step how-to-do-it instructions. Each type of text has its own characteristics. Recognizing the different types will help in separating the different ―rules‖ governing each type of text.

20.4.13 Discourse markers
It is not long before an outsider notices that in formal speech and to a lesser extent, in everyday speech, there is a handful of words which literally pepper the Kuna discourse. These words are discourse markers and are difficult for outsiders to understand and control. The purpose of this section is to help the student at least be aware of these forms and their function.

20.4.13.1 Function of discourse markers129 Some markers indicate the attitude of the speaker towards his audience and include: -ye, -do, -a, jaj, and -chulchi.
Other markers indicate how the speaker is relating what he is saying to his audience and include: itos, takcha, takenye, chogeye, takenchogye, chogchundo, and itoleye.

20.4.13.2 Distribution of discourse markers
Discourse markers are inserted at the end of a thought which usually coincides with the end of a sentence. The speaker may also insert them just prior to the postpredicate position or at the end of each of several coordinate clauses.

Examples

1. Pe wis an pentakoye.

‗Oh please, help me.‘

2. Koe nad takenye, immal aminad takenye. ‗Deer went (you) see, hunting animals (you) see.‘

3. Omegan immal taked nai takenye, immal ‗The women who looked after things were there (you)

echiknaichun takenye.

see, (and) they cut up the meat (you) see.‘

See also sentences 37 and 38 in section A of this lesson.

20.4.13.3 Specific markers

1) -ye
The marker -ye ‗supplicatory/non-authoritative‘ has the effect of making the speaker ―talk-up‖ to his listener. The clearest example of the use of -ye is when someone is pleading for something, or talking to someone of much higher rank or status (see 20.1, Sentence 12).

Example Pe wis an pentakoye.

‗Oh please, please help me.‘

This -ye marker is used in storytelling and usually occurs as part of another discourse marker, e.g.,. takenye ‗appeal for credibility‘. In this sense, there is still an element of a plea to the listener (see takenye in 8 below).

2) -do/-to
The marker -do/-to ‗assertion‘ has been discussed in Appendix E, 5 and 6. However, it retains its assertive flavor when used as part of other discourse markers, e.g., chogchundo (see 20.1, Sentence 6).

Example Tadgan maidgin teob kuschogchundo.

‗That‘s what happened when the ancestors were alive.‘

3) -a
The tone of the marker -a ‗explanatory‘ is more neutral and there is no assertion or defensiveness. It is often used in teaching situations (see 20.1, Sentence 2).

129 It is difficult to ascribe a specific meaning to the discourse markers.

286

Classifications

Example An wis igal onakwia.

‗(Explaining) I‘m going to tell you a story.‘

4) jáj
Although jáj ‗challenge‘ is often used to make a real question (one that expects an answer) into a rhetorical question (one that doesn‘t expect an answer), in a wider sense, it is used to challenge the listener to dispute or contradict what he has said.

Example ¿Inkwa pe takcha, jáj?

‗When did you see (it), (go on tell me)?‘

5) -chulchi/-zhulchi/-julchi
When the speaker feels that the audience is in agreement with him, the appeal for agreement is a mere formality and the point will be willingly conceded, the suffix -chulchi/-zhulchi/-julchi ‗Isn‘t that so?‘ is used (see Monologue 19.1, Sentence 2).

Example Teun Pedro maimojulchi.

‗At that time Peter was home, wasn‘t he? (Everybody knows he was.)‘

6) itos
The marker itos ‗(you) understand‘ is used to mark explanatory comments of background or additional information (see Dialogue 15.1, Sentence 11).
Example An pega ochi ukmogo itos. ‗I‘ll give you a candy too, (you understand).‘

7) takcha/taikcha
The marker takcha/taikcha ‗you understand‘ is also used to appeal/ask for understanding. However, takcha is used with mainline information such as the main points of an argument, or an important explanation on which the outcome of the story is dependent (see Section 20.1, Sentence 5).

Example
An pega mani uko, anka immal pakegal , takcha.

‗I‘ll give you some money, see, to buy me something.‘

8) takenye
The marker takenye ‗appeal for credibility‘ is used when the speaker is appealing for the believing support of the listener(s). It is used extensively in storytelling and in narrating of personal or reported experiences (see 20.1, Sentence 17).
Example Teun achu mai takenye. ‗At that time tiger was living/at home (you) see.‘

9) takenchogye
The marker takenchogye ‗(appeal) for credibility of what was said‘ has the same meaning as takenye except that it relates to what was said instead of what happened (see 20.1, Sentence 20).

Example Koe chogal: --An ne tegil, takenchogye.

‗Deer said, ―I‘m going then,‖ (you understand that he said it).‘

10) chogeye
The marker chogeye ‗it is said‘ is used when the speaker disclaims any responsibility for what is said. It is usually assumed to be fiction (see 20.1, Sentence 4).

20.5 Vocabulary

287

Example Koe mai chogeye.

‗Once upon a time, deer was living/at home.‘

11) chogchundo
The expression chogchundo ‗it is said and it is supposed to be true‘ is used when the speaker is claiming what he said to be true but at the same time he is not accepting the responsibility for what is being said.

Example Tadgan maidgin teob kuschogchundo.

‗That‘s what happened when the ancestors were alive. (They say it is true.)‘

12) itoleye
The speaker is advising his listener that the statement itoleye ‗it is understood‘ is surmise on the part of someone other than himself (see 20.1, Sentence 30).

Example Koe untar immal mecha itoleye.

‗Deer killed many creatures (it is) understood.‘

APPENDIX A: LONG AND SHORT WORD FORMS
In Kuna, many words and suffixes (though not all) have long and short forms. That is to say, certain words or suffixes occur in various specific situations with the final vowel and in others it is deleted, without altering the meaning of the word or suffix. The use of the short form of words/suffixes is more common, while the use of the long form is more restricted. The number of words/suffixes which have both long and short forms varies according to the class of word; these are listed in Section 1 below. General rules for predicting which words/suffixes have a long or short form are given in Section 2, and rules governing the use of the long form are given in Section 3.

1. Number Of Long/Short Forms In The Different Word Classes

a. Verb stems

all have long/short forms

b. Nouns

many have long/short forms

c. Conjunctions

most have long/short forms

d. Suffixes

most have long/short forms

e. Adjectives

few have long/short forms

f. Adverbs

few have long/short forms

g. Pronouns

few have long/short forms

2. Prediction of words which have a long/short form
Research to date has failed to reveal hard and fast rules for determining words with both long and short forms, with the exception of verb stems which all have long and short forms. In the final analysis, it is necessary simply to learn the words that have two forms and the words which do not. Some general rules will guide you in predicting which words are likely to have two forms.

Rule 1: All verb stems may be shortened.

Examples

1. ono(e)

‗to find‘

2. eli(e)

‗to clean‘

Rule 2: A word cannot end in a consonant cluster.130 If dropping the final vowel would cause the word to end in

a consonant cluster, the final vowel may not be dropped. That is to say, the word has no short form. This rule is

true without exception.

Examples

1. arki

‗huacuco (species of fish)‘

2. chigli

‗turkey‘

Rule 3: Most three-syllable words have a short form

Examples

1. apchala apchal

‗fur/feather‘

2. tatara

tatar

‗thin/flimsy‘

Rule 4: If a fortis consonant precedes the final vowel, the final vowel is not usually dropped, i.e., such words generally do not have a short form.

Examples 1. mata

‗lake‘

130 Double or triple-letter symbols for a single sound (ch, ll, mm, nn, rr, ss, and zh) and the labialized consonants (chw, dw, gw, kw, mw, tw, and zhw) are not considered to be consonant clusters.
288

Appenxix A

289

2. amma

‗aunt‘

3. achu

‗dog‘

There are, however, exceptions:

4. napa 5. punnu

nap pun131

‗earth‘ ‗tail‘

6. anni

an131

‗I‘

Rule 5: In most cases a noun with a lenis final consonant has a short form.

Examples

1. ana

an

2. mola

mol

Exceptions to this rule include:

‗branch‘ ‗blouse‘

3. tola

‗catfish‘

4. moli

‗tapir‘

Some nouns of this type, which potentially have long and short forms, have two distinct, but often related,

meanings. Often a long form is reserved to indicate the less commonly used sense of the word, and the short

form the more common sense.

Examples

1. ulu

‗canoe/box (cupboard, suitcase)‘

ul

‗canoe‘

ulu

‗box/cupboard/suitcase‘

2. naba

‗domestic/wild gourd tree‘

nab

‗domestic gourd tree‘

naba

‗wild gourd tree‘

3. ezha

‗machete/iron‘

es

‗machete‘

ezha

‗iron‘

If the short form of two words would be identical, thus resulting in ambiguity, the more common word has both

long and short forms and the other word is not shortened.

Examples

1. mola

mol

‗blouse/cloth‘

2. moli

--

‗tapir‘

Rule 6: Words ending in two vowels have no short form except in the case of verb stems.

Examples 1. chia 2. koe

‗cocoa‘ ‗deer‘

3. Use of the long form versus the short form
The long, rather than the short, forms of words are used only in certain contexts that are discussed below. Otherwise, the short form occurs. With few exceptions, suffixes are added to the short form of words or other suffixes.

131 nn is written n word final by convention.

290

Long and Short Word Forms

Examples neg(a) + -gin(e) = neggin(e) ‗in the house‘ nebal(i) + -mo = nebalmo ‗to go again also‘

a. Long forms The long forms of words are used in the following contexts.

1) Emphasis
The main use of the long form is for emphasis in various situations. In the case of a suffixed word, the long form of the final suffix is used.

Examples 1. Nana. 2. ¡Tummagana!

‗MOTHER‘ ‗The chiefs!‘

2) Topic establishing The long form of a word is used to establish the topic of a question or statement.

Examples
1. ¿Paba, pia nad? 2. Antina, an132 ne.

‗Where did father go?‘ ‗I am going.‘

3) Emphatic answers Emphatic, single word answers to questions occur in the long form.

Examples 1. ¿Toa koe makcha? Anni. 2. ¿Pedin machi takcha? ¡Chuli!

‗Who shot the deer?‘ ‗I did.‘ ‗Did you see the boy?‘ ‗No!‘

4) Attribute of attributive or equative sentence If the attribute of an attributive or equative sentence is emphasized, the long form is used (see 9.4.4).

Examples 1. 2. (People looking at photographs):

Ul tummadi. Wedin paba.

‗The canoe is big.‘ ‗That‘s Father.‘

5) Vocative
The emphatic, long form of the vocative is used when the person is at a distance, or when the speaker is exasperated.

Examples 1. ¡Nana! 2. ¡Punu!

‗Mo-o-other!‘ ‗Dau-au-aughter!‘

6) Clarification
The long form of a word is used to clarify a situation and to prevent ambiguity concerning which item is under discussion (see 17.4.2.3).

132 When the topic is established with the suffix -din(a) (see Appendix E), the unsuffixed noun or pronoun is often repeated in the main body of the sentence.

Appenxix A

291

Example An ul pakcha, ul tummadi.

‗I bought a canoe, the big canoe.‘

7) Listing
In general, for each item in a list the long form is used, except for the last item where the short form occurs if such exists (see 5.4.2).

Example Antin immal pakcha: mola, iko, tegine tub.

‗I bought some things: cloth, needles, and thread.‘

8) Hesitation
When a person hesitates, in order to recall a forgotten word or name, the long form of the word is used (see 17.4.1.3 and 17.4.2.4).

Example Antin iwen takcha, iwenna ... Pedro.

‗I saw what‘s-his-name, ah-ah-ah ... Peter.‘

APPENDIX E: TOPICS OF CONVERSATION

1. Establishing the topic
The suffix -de/-te is used to establish or set the topic of a conversation. When a situation is obvious, two people can start talking about it without setting the topic of the conversation. For example, if a person arrives limping, the other person is likely to ask, ―What happened?‖ He does not need to say something like, ―Concerning your limping, ...‖ in order to get the conversation focused on the person‘s sore leg. The situation makes the nature of the opening question obvious. Often, however, a person wishes to start talking about something that is not obvious, or about a topic which has not been mentioned earlier in the conversation. Possibly he wishes to ask about someone who is not present. The person who is starting to talk about a new topic adds the suffix -de/-te to the item or name of the person which is now in focus.

Examples

1. ¿Pedrode, pia nad?

‗And concerning Peter, where did he go?‘

2. ¿Masde, igi mani?

‗And concerning plantains, how much are they?‘

A common use of -de is in the greeting, tegidde ‗So what‘s new with you?‘ In this case, the topic is changed to

the person who is arriving.

The affected object suffix -ga/-ka (see 10.4.8) may be added to the -de/-te form when appropriate.

Example Antega, an weli.

‗As for me, I‘m happy.‘

2. Progression of topic
In conversation, a speaker generally moves from one aspect (stage) of a subject to another. For example, in selling, the salesman and buyer might first discuss the price. Once the price has been settled, he will move on to discuss the time the goods are to be delivered. The suffix -de/-te serves to mark the point at which the conversation progresses from one point to the next point (stage). The speaker often marks the end of one stage of the conversation by saying nabirde ‗okay‘. Nabirde ‗okay‘ is formed by adding the topic marker -de/-te to the word nabir ‗fine‘. It is similar to the English expression, ―Fine. Now then about the ...‖. That is to say, -de/-te is used to indicate that one part (stage) of the topic (price) has been handled, and we are now ready to discuss the next part of the arrangement (time of delivery of the goods).

3. Allegation
The suffix -de/-te may be used as an allegation, but it may not be used as an affirmation.

Examples 1. Wag an es aturchasde. 2. Wag an es aturchado.

‗The outsider stole (allegation) my machete.‘ ‗The outsider did steal (affirmation) my machete.‘

4. Complete change of topic
The suffix -din/-tin is used to indicate a complete change of topic, for example, when the subject is changed from palu ‗salt‘ to ostigiddin ‗sugar‘ in Dialogue 7.1, sentence 7. The use of -din/-tin is discussed in Section 3.4.5.

5. Conclusion
The suffix -do/-to indicates the conclusion (resolution) of a conversation and is equivalent to the English expression, ―Let‘s go, then.‖ or to the Spanish expression, ―Vamos pues.‖

295

296

Topics of Conversation

Example Nemaldo.

‗Let‘s go, then.‘

6. Affirmation
The suffix -do/-to is also used to affirm something.

Example An wichuldo.

‗I do not know.‘

7. Word order
The normal word order in Kuna is subject + object + predicate.

Example Omedin we mol pakcha. ‗The woman bought that blouse.‘
―The woman‖ in the above example is not only the subject of the sentence, but also the topic of the conversation as indicated by the topic-establishing suffix -din.

In another situation, it might be the blouse which is under discussion, and the speaker merely comments on the fact that the woman bought it. In that case, the topic of conversation is the blouse and a Kuna speaker would change the word order of the sentence by putting the topic (the blouse) first; i.e., topic (object) + subject + predicate.

The topic is always first in a Kuna sentence (following any setting or conjunction), and usually occurs with a topic-establishing suffix -din/-tin.

Example

We moldin, ome pakcha.

‗That blouse was bought by the woman. (Lit.: As for the blouse, the woman bought (it).)‘

In summary, it may be said that when the subject of the sentence is not the topic of conversation, the normal word order is rearranged and the topic is positioned at the beginning of the main part of the sentence.

APPENDIX F: FURTHER NOTES ON -BAL/-PAL
When the suffix - bal/-pal is used in conjunction with the desiderative suffix -bi/-pi, the order of the suffixes varies according to the significance of the utterance. That is to say, the order of suffixes varies according to the focus of the desire.

1. Desire to repeat an action

In order to express a desire to repeat an action, the suffix -bal/-pal precedes the desiderative -bi/-pi.

Example Machi mas kunpalbi.

‗The boy wants to eat again.‘

2. Repeated desire

When it is the desire which is repeated, rather than the action, the desiderative -bi/-pi precedes -bal/-pal.

Example Machi mas kumpibal.

‗The boy again wants to eat.‘

3. Use of -bal/-pal in repeated incident
Occasionally, it is necessary to repeat an entire incident. In this case, each repeated verb in the incident uses the -bal/-pal suffix.

Examples Incident 1
1a. Tule immal takcha. b. Tegine immal makcha. Incident 2 2a. Kujal tule immal takchabal. b. Tegine makchabal.

‗The man saw an animal.‘ ‗And (he) shot it.‘
‗Later, the man saw the animal again.‘ ‗And again (he) shot it.‘

APPENDIX G: IRREGULAR VERBS WITH LONG FORM -KE

The long form of most verb stems is achieved by the addition of -e to the shortened verb stem, for example, pak(e) ‗to buy‘ and no(e) ‗to rise‘. Short verb stems which end in -ma or -ta133 are lengthened by the addition of -ke.

Examples

1. abarma(ke)

‗to run‘

2. nerma(ke)

‗to write‘

3. ima(ke)

‗to do‘

4. apta(ke)

‗to wait‘

5. penta(ke)

‗to help‘

When other suffixes are added, -k is retained in some cases and dropped along with e in other cases.

Examples

1. imako

‗will do‘

2. aptako

‗will wait‘

3. nermakal

‗begin to write‘

4. abarmakal

‗begin to run‘

5. aptakal

‗begin to wait‘

6. nermas

‗wrote‘

7. pentas

‗helped‘

8. ¡Nerma!

‗Write!‘

With the present progressive, there is a difference in meaning between the long form, which seems to indicate ―on a continuing basis,‖ and the short form, which simply means the action is in progress.

Example

1. An pe pentanai.

‗I am helping you.‘

2. ¿Pe Pedro pentaknai?

‗Are you helping Peter (from day to day)?‘

APPENDIX H: IRREGULAR VERBS WHICH END IN -KWE

Verbs that end in -kwe are not completely regular.

Examples

1. nakwe

‗to go up/overcome‘

2. onakwe ‗to lift up‘

3. purkwe ‗to die‘

4. akwe

‗to provide for‘

In the future polite command, the -kwe becomes -k and -o is added.

Examples

1. nako

‗will go up‘

2. purko

‗will die‘

In the inceptive aspect, past progressive, completive and passive forms -kwe becomes -kwi. A general rule is that if the action is viewed as at least partially realized, the -kwi form is used, except in the case of the present progressive where the -kwe form is kept.

Examples

1. nakwial

‗begin to climb/go up‘

2. akwiap

‗was providing for‘

3. purkwis

‗died/dead‘

4. onakwiles

‗lifted up‘

APPENDIX K: ORDERING OF STORY INTRODUCTIONS
In Kuna, the introduction to a story or the relating of an event is presented in a set order: topical information, identificational information, descriptive information, evaluatory information and summary information. The story introduction must be presented in the pre-determined order in order, to ensure that the listener will understand the nature of the story.

1. Topical information
The first item of information given in the introduction to a story is the topic in which the bare topic (person/thing/action) is introduced.

2. Identificational information
The second item of information given in the introduction to the story is information which will identify the specific person/thing/action mentioned as the topic.

3. Descriptive information
Any elaboration or description of the topic (person/thing/action) is given next.

4. Evaluatory information
Any evaluation of the topic (person/thing/action) is given as the fourth item.

5. Summary information
A summary statement of some sort is then needed to summarize and warn the listener that the introduction is finished and that the story proper is about to begin.

Example

Immal noni. Chule noni; taikcha. Chule, yer tunku. Chule nabir kunned. Ad noni.

Topical information

1. Immal noni.

‗An animal arrived.‘

Identificational information

2. Chule noni, takcha.

‗It was a capybara, you see.‘

Descriptive information

3. Chule, yer tunku.

‗The capybara was very big.‘

Evaluatory information

4. Chule nabir kunned.

‗It would be good to eat.‘

APPENDIX N: LANGUAGE LEARNING
A. Learning Outside the Classroom
The lessons in this grammar were designed mainly for classroom use. For the student who is learning the language living among the people, or for those who wish extra or further study of the language, the questions arise:
1. ―How do I learn outside of the classroom?‖ 2. ―How do I go beyond the information in these lessons?‖ (The learner will inevitably find that he wants to
know much more on some topics.) This appendix is an attempt to answer these questions.
1. Goal of language learning The ultimate goal of language learning is to be completely bilingual; to be able to say anything you want to express with all the nuances of meaning and shades of emotion with as much facility as you can in your first language (mother tongue). Although few people really achieve this goal, it is something for which we should all aim. However, for our encouragement along the way, there are various stages (levels) of achievement. The following is one scheme:
Stage 1: When you are able to greet people and say goodbye. Stage 2: When you are also able to exchange pleasantries. Stage 3: When you are able to parrot fixed phrases, dealing with essential needs such as food, shelter, a guide,
directions, basic buying and selling. Stage 4: When you are able to communicate effectively in the specialized areas where you have most contact
such as medical, trade, teaching or work projects. Stage 5: When you are able to communicate, generally, in all common aspects of everyday life with a limited
number of verb aspects (tenses). Stage 6: When you are able to control reasonably well most normal grammatical relationships such as
cause-effect, time, location, condition, purpose, ability, possibility and motion verbs. Stage 7: When you are fluent in any non-abstract area up through Stage 6 and reasonably control focus and
emphasis. Stage 8: When you are able to talk about the abstract, present an argument, use figures of speech, etc. Stage 9: When you are able to discuss emotions, values ,and able to discuss life from the Kuna philosophical
viewpoint. Goal: Absolute bilingualism.
2. Problem of adult language learning A child will learn three or four languages without difficulty. Any new sound, word or grammatical construction gets added to his repertoire. It will take him a while to separate out the systems of each language entirely. This he will do provided he is exposed to environments where only one system is present. (Otherwise, he fails and this leads to the formation of a Creole.)
By adulthood, however, the limited repertoire of sounds, words and grammatical systems of the mother tongue has become so habitual (automatic) that they have formed almost a closed system. It takes will power, determination and effort to learn new distinctions, new patterns, and new words. Adults do not enjoy repeating, repeating and repeating things. But this is what it takes for the new sounds, words, and grammatical patterns to become automatic. This is the only way to become fluent.
Now, there are ways of making the repetition more palatable, e.g., It is much better to ―become fluent‖ in a prepared conversation by visiting a dozen homes and saying it in each home, than saying it to yourself twelve times at your desk. (Besides, hopefully, the people you visit will correct you.)
307

308

Language Learning

3. Speaking a language In order to speak a language, you have to ―think‖ that language. You need to ―see‖ in that language and you need to ―visualize‖ in that language. You should never translate into that language from the mother tongue or bridge language. To illustrate this, when you see:
Figure 9.

you think ulu, not ―canoe‖. When you visualize:

Figure 10.

you think An immal amine, not ―I‘m going to hunt.‖ You should never translate ―I‖ as ani, ―am going to‖ as -ne, or ―hunt‖ as ami, because often you will end up with a mismatch, such as An (omitted) amine in which immal ‗thing, animal‘ has been omitted. It is also very difficult to translate quickly enough.
4. Translation Where you have to translate/interpret for someone else, then you proceed:
Figure 11.

An immal amine.

→

→ ‗I‘m going hunting.‘

→ → And, thus, we have: words visualize words, but not: → An immal amine I thing going to look for → (i.e., not: words words).

B. Steps in Learning136
In order to really learn something in Kuna, you have to go through five steps in the learning process.

1. Awareness
First, you need to be made aware of the existence of a particular sound, word, grammatical construction or intonation pattern and its meaning. Yon have to learn to ―hear‖ (recognize) it in a particular context. For example, you find out (become aware) that toa means ―who‖ and start to ―hear‖ (recognize) it when it is used in an amplificatory question (see Section 4.4.3.1).

Example ¿Toa nade?

‗Who went?‘

2. Reproduction
Then, you have to learn to reproduce (say) automatically the same particular sound, word, grammatical construction, or intonation pattern in that particular context. For example, you practice using toa ‗who‘ in amplificatory questions until you can do so without even thinking about it.

3. Variation
Next, you learn to modify (vary) what you have just learned in section 2 above, in the same context. For example, you discover that by adding -ga to toa ‗who‘ (modifying it), you get toaga ‗to, for whom‘. Also, you discover that by adding -bak to toa ‗who‘ (another modification), you get toabak ‗with whom‘ which you can now use in the same context (amplificatory questions).

Examples 1. ¿Toa ob chus? 2. ¿Toaga ob chus? 3. ¿Toabak ob chus?

‗Who fetched the corn?‘ ‗For whom did (he) fetch the corn?‘ ‗With whom did (he) fetch the corn?‘

4. Limited Control
Then you learn to control what you have learned in other limited contexts. For example, you move from controlling toa ‗who‘ only in amplificatory questions, to controlling toa ‗who‘ in topic questions and confirmation questions though all in the limited context of questions.

Examples 1. ¿Toa koe makcha? 2. ¿Koede, toa tar makcha? 3. ¿Toa makcha?

‗Who killed the deer?‘ ‗Who killed the deer?‘ ‗Who (did you say) killed (the deer)?‘

5. Complete control
Finally, you learn to control what you are learning in any context and use it automatically whenever you need it to communicate what you want to say. For example, you learn to use toa elsewhere in the language.

Example Meke toa tule tani.

‗Let anybody come.‘

C. What You Have To Do To Succeed
Robert Gunn (personal communication) suggests there are three essential requirements for success: 1) speak the language, 2) keep others talking, and 3) plan your contacts.

1. Speak the language Speak Kuna, only Kuna, all the time in the presence of Kunas.

136 Larson, Donald N. and Smalley, William A. (1972). Becoming Bilingual, A Guide To Language Learning. New Canaan, Connecticut. Practical Anthropology, pp. 147–150.

310

Language Learning

a. Reason This forces you to do several things:
1. Use what you know of the language. 2. Expand the areas of language that you need most. 3. Decrease the use of the national language, which helps you to start ―thinking‖ in Kuna. 4. Usage helps the words and patterns you employ to become more automatic.
b. Problem Speaking only Kuna will increase cultural stress.137 It is important to note that cultural stress is different from culture shock inasmuch as it affects everybody who lives in a culture other than their own. The frustration of trying to communicate in a language you do not control increases your stress load. This is especially true in the early days but will decrease as your ability to speak Kuna increases. In addition, moving around in a minefield of unknown cultural booby traps in the form of gestures, attitudes and nuances of spoken clues, is also very stressful. You should be aware of how to recognize and deal with this problem. There is much written on this subject which would be of help. In light of this problem. the rule of ―speak Kuna and only Kuna‖ should be modified.
For instance, depending upon your intended length of stay, stress tolerance, etc., ―only Kuna‖ might have to be modified to ―only Kuna for X number of hours per day.‖ Preferably you should state when this should be, e.g., 12:00 noon - 8:00 p.m. (the busy visiting time). It will take discipline even to do this, but the effort will be worth it. Cultural relaxation, such as light reading or music is good after the end of the designated period for speaking.
c. Setting the limit on speaking only Kuna There are three ways in which you can limit (modify) the rule of ―speak only Kuna, always.‖ Again, you need to remember that you are looking for the minimum number of exceptions to this rule that will allow you to work and live within your limitations (of your stress load, etc.).
1) Time You should set what portion of the day you will relax the rule of speaking Kuna only, e.g., after 8:00 p.m. By this time most visitors are gone. If there are still some around, you don‘t have to force yourself to keep speaking Kuna if you get ―stuck.‖
Relaxing the rule does not mean that you revert to Spanish completely, but means that you allow yourself to indulge in using a Spanish sentence here or there, or to express a point you aren‘t yet able to do in Kuna.
2) Geographic location You may decide to make exceptions on the basis of physical location. For example, you may decide that if you visit a Kuna, you will only speak Kuna. If he visits you, there may be times when you will allow him to address you in Spanish.
3) Situation You need to list the situations under which you will allow yourself to relax the rule of speaking only Kuna. For example, a reasonable exception would be during an emergency—medical or otherwise. You need to decide what your rules are going to be in the presence of a Kuna, plus a person who doesn‘t understand only Kuna.

137 For further discussion of this problem read "Stress producing factors in cultural adjustment" by Wayne T. Dye (1974) Missiology 2 (1):61–77.

Appenxix N

311

d. The necessity of setting a limit to the exceptions You are human, and unless you set a limit to your ―exceptions,‖ you will find that you start to use the language less and less. It is hard to speak Kuna all the time and experience the frustration of not being able to communicate properly, but this ―forcing‖ of yourself to speak it will make you use what you know and ―dig‖ for what you don‘t know. Therefore, adhere rigidly to your limits!
2. Keep others talking In learning Kuna, an important part of the process is ―listen, listen, listen.‖
a. Reason This is useful in several ways:
1. Hearing the language in its natural context gives good reliable correlation between the situation and the appropriate intonation, grammar and vocabulary.
2. You increase your ability to divide up a torrent of speech into meaningful pieces so that you understand what is being said.
3. You increase your ability to visualize the situation under discussion without having to go through some intermediate language.
4. Constantly hearing the intonation and grammatical patterns tends to reinforce them in your own mind. 5. Hearing a word used in different contexts helps define the area of meaning of a word, e.g., neg is found to
mean ―house or building.‖ It is also used to refer to the ―village‖ (as opposed to the surrounding countryside) or a ―field.‖ It is also used as a ―place‖ in general.
b. Problem The problem is that in Kuna, like most languages, you have to show your interest in what is being said by responding in the appropriate way, or the person will feel that you aren‘t interested and stop talking. In Kuna, this is done by so-called conversation sustainers such as mmmm, ajáj, or repeating the last important phrase of what was being said. These conversation sustainers should be used right from the beginning, starting with the more simple neutral ones such as mmmm and injecting them at random until you can distinguish the appropriate places to use them.
3. Plan your contacts We have probably all, at some time or another, experienced the embarrassment of being with somebody, either in or outside of our own culture, when neither we nor they knew what to say. The memory of the heavy and embarrassing silence tends to stay with one a long while.
The way to avoid this is to plan your contact with the other person. If the person comes to see you, run through your prepared conversation and allow him to say what he wants to say. As soon as the conversation shows signs of winding down, you should be ready with some planned activity such as looking at a magazine or photos with him or having him watch you make something.
When you visit another person, have a conversation prepared, even if it is only two or three exchanges to start with. Once you have said what you prepared and the conversation shows signs of slowing down, say goodbye and leave right away. The people you visit might think your visit short, but that is better than the embarrassment (to them) of a long silence.
D. Techniques
1. Listening Kuna culture offers tremendous opportunities for listening. The culturally acceptable loudness level (norm) for Kuna is loud; i.e., it is much more culturally acceptable to speak in a clear, loud voice than in English. To talk in subdued tones would indicate that possibly you are trying to hide from others what you are saying. That would mean, by implication, you are not speaking well of others.

312

Language Learning

a. Opportunities
1) Visiting Visiting can be used for listening (hearing the language) practice.
a) Visiting others As you make your round of visiting each day (Kunas appreciate a daily visit), follow one of the other men (or women) from house to house. This is quite acceptable and affords you the opportunity of hearing the same person relate the same content (the day‘s activities) to house after house. Then, the next day, follow someone else.
When someone has arrived from a trip, go and visit him and stay around as he relates his trip over and over again to a succession of visitors.
b) Visitors to your house After normal courtesies have been extended, often the visitor will visit or talk with only one member of your family. The inactive member can then listen and get in hearing practice without having to worry about replying, e.g., the husband listens as the wife takes care of medical needs. Or the wife listens as the man talks with her husband.
If your visitors have been given photos or magazines to look at, you can listen as they discuss it among themselves.
2) Meetings The village meetings give a great opportunity for listening. The temptation is to switch off when you can‘t understand. However, by concentrating, you can learn much of teaching style and patterns. You can learn discussion patterns too. Occasionally, if a problem arises with somebody violating the law and customs of the people, you can hear accusations, denials and counter-accusations and authoritative judicial announcements as the chief acts as judge.
You cannot concentrate for hours on end. Nobody can. So, when you feel your concentration slipping, ―switch off‖ the speaker and relax your mind. After a break of about five minutes, ―switch on‖ again and start listening. Stretching your legs and a breath of fresh air can help too. You will notice it is quite cultural to excuse yourself from the meeting for a couple of minutes.
3) Work parties Kunas are a community-oriented society and as such, often work together doing house-building, town clean-up, etc. By taking part in these, you can obtain excellent opportunities for listening.
It is quite cultural to be present at a work party and not lift a finger to help, if you are not one of those assigned to the job. If, however, the whole community is involved, it is better to join in as you can.
b. Methods
1) Tracking The most profitable way is to track the speaker. This device is fully discussed in Section 9.2.
2) Active listening A less profitable way is to listen actively. Sometimes it‘s just not wise to track the speaker, so this is the best you can do. Think about what you are hearing. Don‘t only pay attention to the content (or meaning) of what is being said, but also to the way it is said. Sometimes you should concentrate on everything that is being said. Other times you should select a particular feature and zero in on that, e.g., where a listener inserts a conversation sustainer, or if there is some pattern to how one of them is used.

Appenxix N

313

3) Passive listening
This is just listening to what is being said, without thinking about the intonation, grammatical construction used, etc. This does not mean that you have ―switched off‖ the speaker. It means that you listen to the speaker, like you listen to English, to hear what he is saying.

c. Noting the setting
This is as important as the tracking or listening itself. It‘s no use knowing patterns of intonation, grammar, etc., if you don‘t know when to use them. So, whenever you are listening, notice the following:
1. What incident triggered what the speaker is saying? Was it a question? Was it an allegation? Was it what happened? Was it what the speaker had failed to do?
2. What is the speaker‘s emotional attitude? Is he happy, sad, angry, afraid or doubtful? Is he defensive, aggressive, involved, neutral or trying to disassociate himself from something?
3. What is the relative status between the speaker and the listener? Is the speaker of higher or lower status? Is the difference in status being ignored or even reversed?
4. Is the speaker using his authority or trying to manipulate someone? Is he only pleading? 5. Is he serious or speaking in jest?

d. Gestures Note the accompanying gestures and facial expressions.

2. Expanding your knowledge of Kuna
It is helpful if you can use Kuna as soon as possible to further your knowledge of the language. In order to do this, there are certain expressions that need to be memorized right away.

a. Language learning expressions

1) Speaking Kuna 1. An wichul tule kakpal chunma. 2. An wis itos, iche. 3. Anni turtabi, tule kakpal. 4. Anka tule kakabal chunma. 5. Anka tule kakbalbi chunma. 6. Melle anka wag kakbal chunma.

‗I don‘t know how to speak Kuna.‘ ‗I only understand a little.‘ ‗I want to learn Kuna.‘ ‗Please speak to me in Kuna.‘ ‗Please speak to me only in Kuna.‘ ‗Don‘t speak Spanish to me.‘

2) Elicitation 7. ¿Ibi wede? 8. ¿Itide, ibi? 9. ¿Igi pemal ... pimal, pe kakbal? 10. ¿Igi chogle, wede? 11. ¿Ibi chenai?

‗What is that?‘ ‗What is this?‘ ‗How do you say ... in your language?‘ ‗What does that mean?‘ ‗What are/is (you/he) doing?‘

3) Other expressions useful in elicitation The ―wh‖ question words, e.g., who, what, where, when, how are discussed in Lesson IV.

12. ¿Ibi chomnai? 13. ¿Ibi imanai? 14. ¿Igi takle? 15. ¿Igi kullege? 16. ¿Igi koblege?

‗What are/is (you/he) making?‘ ‗What are (you) doing?‘ ‗What does it look like?‘ ‗What does it taste like (eating)?‘ ‗What does it taste like (drinking)?‘

314

17. ¿Pia ne? 18. ¿Pia ti?
4) Repetition 19. An itojul. 20. ¿Ibi chogzha, wede? 21. An igija. 22. Kannan anka chogbalo. 23. Pinna anka wis choggwelo.
5) Accuracy 24. Anka chogo, an nojal. 25. Pedin anka chogo. 26. ¿Inikigwa?

‗Where are you going?‘ ‗Where have you been?‘
‗I don‘t understand.‘ ‗What did he say?‘ ‗I forget.‘ ‗Please repeat it for me.‘ ‗Please say it slowly for me.‘
‗Tell me when I make a mistake.‘ ‗You say it to me.‘ ‗Correct (the same?)?‘

b. Eliciting information138

1) Questions
This is the most common and easiest way of getting information, whether in a formal language session or a casual contact. However, you need to follow up on your first question: e.g., if you saw a pig and asked, ¿Ibi wede? ‗What is that?‘ then if feasible, you should follow it up with a whole string of questions, such as:

2. ¿Ibi kun?

‗What does it eat?‘

3. ¿Pia mai?

‗Where does it live?‘

4. ¿Toagad?

‗Whose is it?‘

5. ¿Ibi chenai?

‗What is it doing?‘

6. ¿Igi talde, igi pe ebinzhe?

‗What do you think, how does it look?‘

This type of questioning will do several things for you:

1. It may produce new vocabulary.
2. It will reinforce old vocabulary.
3. It will help you determine the usage of words. You will discover that chickens don‘t kun ‗eat‘ food but that they ma ‗peck‘ food.
4. It will help you build up vocabulary according to topic (according to semantic field). This means that you will become familiar with many of the words associated with ―pigs‖ in the above example. That means that the next time you are out on a walk, you will not only be able to comment ¡Pe take, china! ‗Look, pigs!‘ but you will be able also to comment on their size, color, activity, likes and dislikes, what they taste like, etc.
5. By using the new word in several questions, you will learn it.

2) Error technique
The idea here is to use a totally wrong word in the place of the item you wish to know. Hopefully, you will be corrected and, thus, supplied with the word, e.g., if you saw a guacamayo parrot flying overhead and you wanted to know what it‘s called, you say, ―Look at that pig up there!‖ The person will invariably reply, ―That‘s not a chin ‗pig‘, that‘s a nalu ‗guacamayo parrot‘.‖ Or, ―He‘s cooking in the river‖ would

bring a reply of, ―No, (he‘s) tommomanai ‗swimming‘.‖ You can use anything that doesn‘t make sense in the situation.
3) Observation You can expand your knowledge of the language by observing what is said in a given situation. However, this is fairly risky as your interpretation of the situation may be completely erroneous. However, it is very useful in checking information elicited previously, especially that gathered in formal, artificial situations.
4) Use of pictures By looking at pictures with a Kuna visitor, either photos or magazines, you can glean valuable insights into Kuna. One good method is to discuss what you are looking at in a magazine with your visitor as a planned activity during his visit.
5) Use of texts Increased fluency and naturalness can be acquired by memorizing short texts. A text may be a conversation (dialogue) between two people or a single person (monologue) telling of an event or expressing an opinion on a subject.
The language learner will find it very helpful to use a short text that deals with his surroundings or situation and to visiting throughout the village using the memorized text with the people he meets. He should write out the text he plans to use. He may develop it from a short conversation that he has heard/recorded. He should read the text aloud to a close Kuna friend who is willing to check it for accuracy before it is memorized.
The following guidelines in text making may prove helpful:
1. The text should be short! Early texts for the purpose of memorization should be no more than three or four exchanges. After some degree of fluency is achieved, the texts may be lengthened.
2. The subject matter should be relevant to your situation. 3. The text should be as natural as possible. The ideal source is a type of spontaneous conversation
between two people. 4. Intonation should always be learned first. Individual sounds, meanings of words or grammatical
constructions are secondary. 5. After the text has been mastered and used several times in a natural situation, the language learner
should start substituting other vocabulary items, a few at a time, making sure the intonation pattern and speed are maintained. 6. Once substitution has been mastered, try jotting down several pieces of information about a single subject. Organize the information into a single text. Be sure to check the text you develop with a Kuna friend who is willing to check your text for naturalness and accuracy. 7. Use one text type at a time (see Section 20.4.12).
3. Speaking Kuna Speak, speak, speak! Use every opportunity you can. Work hard to control the conversation signals and sustainers in Section 11.2.
a. Correcting It is important that the people correct you all the time. Now this is hard to do.
1) From your viewpoint
a) Pride It is hard for anyone to be constantly corrected. It‘s humiliating. But you have to put your pride in your pocket and take correction.

316

Language Learning

b) Discouragement Constant correction can be discouraging. However, if you realize and accept the fact that anyone (and that includes you) has to be corrected many times before he can reasonably expect to be able to control a grammatical construction, then there is no need for discouragement. If the rate of correction is dropping for the same construction, then progress is being made and that is nice to know.
c) Being corrected when you are right Sometimes you will be corrected when you are sure you are right. Don‘t argue with the person correcting you. Make the correction. Most of the time, there is some factor you have either forgotten about or don‘t yet know exists. For instance, if the word order suddenly changes, it is probably because of a change of focus or emphasis, or the need to keep track of the ―theme‖ or ―topic‖ of the paragraph. Remember, Kunas speak the language correctly, even though they may not be able to adequately explain it (even as we cannot always adequately explain what is happening in English).
2) From their viewpoint 1. They don‘t wish to embarrass or discourage you. 2. They get tired of correcting the same thing. 3. They forget that you really want them to correct you. So, you need to constantly remind your friends to
help you by correcting you.
b. Try to make full use of your knowledge 1. Consciously try to make use of your full repertoire of grammatical constructions. 2. Try to make full use of your vocabulary on a given topic. 3. As you progress in the language, try to be more expressive. Try to bring out the emphasis and focus you
want to get across to your listener. Learn to be more graphic in your description of exciting events.
c. Keep going If you start to speak on something and you run into trouble, e.g., you‘ve forgotten a vocabulary item, you run into a situation where you don‘t know what the grammatical structure is, don‘t give up without a fight. Try one or several of the following:
1. Try to receive prompting by using iwen ... iwen (see Section 11.4.4.1). 2. Admit to a poor memory: ¡Aai! An igija. ‗Oh dear! I forget.‘ 3. Try the error technique (see Appendix N). 4. Try a descriptive phrase or sentence instead of a word. 5. Try dramatization, if practical. Above all, be able to laugh at yourself and at your mistakes. It is much more fun that way, and besides, you will provide a lot of local entertainment.
d. Evaluate yourself Think about your trouble spots. These may be areas where you get ―stuck‖ or even areas where you are constantly corrected. This is a good indication that here is an area that you need a lot, yet don‘t control. It makes good sense to make such an area the next one that you find out about and learn.
4. Planning If you are going to learn Kuna, it takes discipline and planning. This involves not only your study program, but also your living program. If you don‘t keep mentally and physically fit, your learning ability will be impaired.
a. Living Long extended periods of exposure to culture stress tend to be cumulative. Although you may ―stick it out,‖ productivity drops and it would be far more profitable to go ―out‖ a week or two and then be fresh again.

The endurance of the family is based on the tolerance of the weaker member. This is often the wife, because the stress load of the wife is much greater than that of the husband. She has to carry dual roles of family and work. Then, in addition, the effect of living in a different culture is a far greater stress in her carrying out her role as wife and mother, than on the husband in his role as bread-winner and family man.
Desire, or willingness, to live among people of a different culture does not enable one to escape most of the pressures of culture stress. Excessive stress often results in one or more of a vast selection of physical disorders. In summary: Deal with culture stress, or it will deal with you!
b. Time In setting up your daily or weekly schedule, be flexible enough to avoid frustration and disciplined enough to achieve success. Try to fit your daily schedule to the cultural pattern of the people. For instance, have your time for visiting in the late afternoon and your time for study and planning in the morning when the people are away in their fields. Any daily schedule should include:
1) Time with the people Time spent in visiting is not only good for your relationship with the people, but can be valuable language-learning time.
2) Study time Time needs to be set aside for memorization, processing information, planning and preparing for ―talking‖ on your visits.
3) Other work time This includes teaching and medical programs, etc.
4) Family time There is a real need, because of demands by the people, to guard against neglecting the family. Here, you can use the Kuna cultural pattern to good effect. For instance, you can have family fun on your own at the river, swimming and playing (it is cultural to respect a family‘s privacy). You can also have family time by extending the time it takes to eat your meals (it is cultural to leave and stay away while people are eating).
5) Your “own” time You (husband or wife) need time to be on your own for quiet reflection, etc.
6) Living time Living away from the city takes more time for chores, maintenance, etc. This fact has to be recognized and planned for.
The above list is not in order of importance or priority. All the items need to be included. None can be left out.
c. Planning your contacts with people Plan what the contact is going to be: a visit, or work party, or meeting, etc. Based on the type of contact, think of what opportunities there are likely to be for hearing or speaking or learning in Kuna. In view of the opportunities that are likely to be available, think of what learning devices you will be able to use:
1) Hearing 1. Tracking 2. Active listening 3. Passive listening
2) Talking 4. Conversing and speaking

318

Language Learning

3) Investigating 5. Questioning 6. Recording and writing what is said. Having decided which learning devices you will probably be able to use, in addition to the general use of tracking, talking, etc., think of what special features of the intonation, sounds, and grammar you need to concentrate on.
In view of what features you want to concentrate on, think of what topics you think it would be helpful to steer the discussion or conversation towards, if given the opportunity.
Assuming that you have an opportunity to steer the conversation, think through how you will achieve this.
Now that you have decided what you need to do, write it down and familiarize yourself with it.
Then think through the whole contact, writing down what you need by way of greeting; establishing topic; your contribution by way of conversation; some of the ―sustainers‖ you will probably need and closures.
Plan what you intend to do when the conversation winds down. If it is a planned activity, make sure all the necessary preparations are made.
Plan your exit.
d. Plan your investigation of Kuna In planning further investigation of Kuna, there are several factors to be taken into account:
1) Need If you have a situation in which you can‘t express yourself correctly, cropping up several times in a row, then this is the logical area to investigate next. For instance, if you have difficulty in expressing when an incident will/did take place, then it would be good to investigate time phrases and clauses.
2) Variations Try to systematically work through the variations of what you have discovered under #1 above. For instance, after having discovered how to say: ―Yesterday, I....,‖ systematically think through ―tomorrow,‖ ―day before yesterday,‖ ―day after tomorrow,‖ ―three days ago,‖ ―in three days‘ time,‖ ―last week,‖ ―next week,‖ etc., and try to find out the forms for these.
3) Relationships After dealing with pressing problems, work through a list of universal grammatical relationships139 and see which ones you can handle. Next, make a list of what would appear to be the most useful for you to use. Then use this as a basis for your investigation.
e. Process Plan for the following stages in investigation:
1. gather data 2. hypothesize (guess what the grammar rule is) 3. check your hypothesis

139 Some books dealing with grammatical universals from which you can extract a list: Beekman, John & Callow, John (1974). Translating the Word of God. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan Publishing House. Chafe, Wallace L. (1970). Meaning and the structure of Language. Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press. Grimes, Joseph E. (1975).

4. if wrong, form a new hypothesis and check again 5. if correct, write up the rule 6. learn the rule 7. use and practice the construction
5. Gathering and processing information There are several books which adequately deal with this subject and it is beyond my purpose here to deal extensively with this subject. However, there are two cardinal rules worth repeating:
a. Write it down When you gather information (language data), write it down. Otherwise, you (in common with humankind) will forget it.
b. Filing The information written down must be filed in such a way as you can readily ―find‖ it.
c. Rate Don’t gather information faster than you can digest (process) it, or it will drown you. For example, don‘t sit down and gather 100 new words. Just take 5–10 new words, write them down, check their meaning, learn them and use them. Then, and only then, gather another 5–10 new words or one grammatical device and assimilate that.
