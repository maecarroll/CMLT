Abstract
The Panará language is spoken by a very small group on the border of the Mato Gosso and Pará states of Brazil. Panará has been reported to be similar to both Kayapó and Canela languages. As with many other language groups of the Amazon Basin, there are a multitude of factors that potentially threaten the maintenance of these languages. This research identified evidence of the linguistic uniqueness of Panará and factors that are serving to help maintain the use of the language.
1. Introduction
Field data for this study was collected in Brazil by Stan Anonby between January 25th and February 14th, 2007. Sociolinguistic information was gathered on the Panará language (also known as Kreen-Akarore [kre]1). Data was also collected from the Canela [ram] and Kayapó [txu] language groups for the purpose of linguistic comparison with Panará.
This research had several goals: 1. to determine the degree of similarity between the Canela, Kayapó, and Panará languages; 2. to determine whether literacy materials developed in Canela or Kayapó could be used or adapted for speakers of Panará; 3. to ascertain the vitality of the Panará language; 4. to measure levels of bilingualism in Portuguese among the Panará; 5. and to gather information that will help to assess the need and viability of a language development program for the Panará.
Data was collected at three primary events and locations. On the first leg of the trip, Stan visited Barra do Corda, in Maranhão state, to gather Canela language materials. The majority of the information was collected mainly at a Kayapó gathering where two Panará were visiting. This meeting took place in São Felix, in the state of Pará. Later, Stan was able to visit Nasepoti village in the Panará indigenous territory. David Holbrook assisted with analysis and writing of this report.
2. The Panará Reserve
The Panará Reserve is located in central Brazil, on the border between the states of Pará and Mato Grosso. The reserve covers 495,000 hectares and is a northeastern portion of the traditional land previously occupied by the tribe. They presently live in the region around the upper Iriri River (known as the Nesapoti river in Panará). The area Stan visited is home to many Brazilian indigenous people speaking various languages. The reserve is northwest of the Xingu Park and east of the Cuiabá – Santarem highway (BR 163) (see figure 1).

Nespoti, the lone Panará village, is a five-hour truck ride from Guarantã, a town to the southwest. There is a landing strip in the village, and the trip by air takes about one hour. Guarantã is the Panará’s main shopping town. Colider, several hours drive south of Guarantã, is the town they visit for their health needs.
The Canela and Kayapó are both larger language groups who live around the Panará.
3. Previous research on Panará
Interest in the Panará was high, even before contact, because of the reputation they had as fierce, giant Indians. Adrian Cowell (1973) has written an interesting account of the Villa Boas brothers’ attempt to make initial contact in the early 1970s. Ricardo Arnt (1996, 1998a-j), Roberto Geraldo Baruzzi (1977, 2001), and others have written articles about the culture and/or history of this group. Luciana Gonçalves Dourado (1990, 1995, 2000, 2001) has described some aspects of the language and linguistics. Stephan Schwartzman (1987, 1992, 1995, 1996, 1997) wrote a PhD dissertation about the Panará while they were in the Xingu Park. Schwartzman still works with the Panará and has published a few articles about them since his dissertation. Elizabeth Ewart (2000, 2003) also wrote her dissertation on this group. Both Ewart’s and Schwartzman’s dissertations relate mainly to cultural aspects.
The Panará language is classified as part of the Ge language family. The Ethnologue, Raymond Gordon, Jr. (2005) classifies it as Macro-Ge, Ge-Kaingang, Ge, Northwest. Kayapó and Canela are also classified in the same group. The famed Brazilian linguist Darcy Ribeiro (cited in Janice H. Hopper, 1967:141) stated Panará is not a dialect of Kayapó, but that it is possibly closer to Canela.

4. Language relationships

There has been language development for both Kayapó and Canela. Due to reports of similarity between these speech varieties, the relationships need to be studied. Understanding these relationships may help determine if it would be possible for the Panará to share or adapt written material from Kayapó or Canela.

One method used to investigate the relationship between these varieties was to collect a basic vocabulary list. The list used is known as the Swadesh-Rowe wordlist. Data was collected from each of the speech varieties of Canela. The indigenous people who provided these wordlists were literate or semi-literate. They initially wrote the words down. The Kayapó and Canela used their existing and well-established orthographies when they wrote the words. There is no established, agreed-upon orthography for Panará. It appeared as though the Panará were writing the words in an alphabet they were adapting from Portuguese. As one would expect, they were not consistent. Some phonemes was transcribed with several different symbols.

Due to differences between the Canela and Kayapó orthographies, and the inconsistency of the Panará transcription, it was necessary to transcribe the wordlists phonetically. The wordlists were elicited orally and audio recordings were made. The wordlist can be found in the appendix to this report.

A simple comparison of these phonetic transcriptions was done using a scale scoring of 0 to 3. A score of 3 meant the words were identical phonetically. A score of 2 meant that the words had the same number of phonemes, but there was one minor difference, or, at most two (in cases where the differences were the result of the same phonetic difference occurring twice). A score of 1 meant that the words had a different number of phonemes, but the general phonetic shape (order of phonemes) and similarity was maintained. A score of 0 indicated significant difference in either phonetic shape and/or number of phonemes.

There were a total of 220 words collected in all three languages. The Panará–Canela comparison yielded the following results:

0) Different words 1) Somewhat similar words 2) Very similar words 3) Identical words

Of the 220 words collected in all three languages, 158 of the Canela words had a score of 0 when compared to Panará (72%) and 168 of the Kayapó words had a score of 0 when compared to Panará (77%). Only seven Canela words scored 3 (identical) and only five Kayapó words scored 3. Panará shares at most 28% of similar words with Canela. Panará shares at most 23% of similar words with Kayapó. The results of the comparison indicated that it would not be possible to share materials from either Kayapó or Canela. It also showed that it is unlikely that materials will be easily adaptable from Kayapó or Canela.

In order to measure comprehension between the languages, Recorded Text Tests (RTTs) were attempted. The testing methodology Stan Anonby tried to follow is described in Eugene H. Casad (1974), and further discussed in F. Blair (1990). The development of a RTT takes time and testing to ensure accuracy. The attempt to develop a RTT with Canela was only marginally successful. The methodology requires that a locally recorded text is tested with people for whom the speech is meant to represent. This is called a hometown test. The testing of the Canela text resulted in poor hometown test scores. Similar problems were encountered in attempts to make a RTT for Kayapó. Due to a lack of time, it was not possible to try to improve the tests. Thus, some simple stories were recorded and played for the Panará. The Panará only understood one word of the Kayapó text, and one Portuguese loan word in the Canela text.
5. Panará history and lifestyle2
5.1 History
The following information on Panará history and lifestyle is presented to lay a foundation for understanding factors influencing Panará identity and the maintenance of their language. This information is largely compiled from the Socioambiental web site (Ricardo Arnt et al. 1998a-i).
The Panará are believed to be descendents of the great Southern Kayapó tribe. The large tribal lands included parts of modern-day Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Goiás, Mato Grosso, and São Paulo states. The Southern Kayapó were known as a ferocious people because they took no prisoners in battle.
In the 1700s, miners began traveling between the states of São Paulo and Goiás. Their route went right through the middle of the Southern Kayapó territory. For their safety, miners hired gunmen to drive the Indians away. By the 1800s, the Southern Kayapó were nearly extinct in these areas. Many of the survivors fled west and north into the rainforest of northern Mato Grosso state. These survivors became the Panará.
In 1967, the Kayapó, armed with guns, attacked the Panará, who suffered heavy losses (Cowell 1973:98). By 1972, the Cuiabá-Santarém highway was also pushing through their territory. In 1973, responding to these threats, the Villas Boas brothers contacted the Panará.
Shortly after this, the first epidemic occurred. By 1975, the Panará numbered only seventy-nine individuals, a drastic reduction from the estimated 350 to 600 prior to contact. At that point, the survivors were transferred to the Xingu Park. The area where they had lived was opened up to colonization and mining.
The Panará did not integrate well into the Xingu Park. Attempts to get them to share villages with various other tribes failed. They never settled in happily with the other groups, and altogether, they shifted village sites seven times within the Xingu. The Panará were first settled in the Kayabí [kyz] village of Prepuri, then they were moved to the Kayapó [txu] village of Kretire. After that, they were moved to a Suyá [suy] village. (Ricardo Arnt et. al. 1998g).
2 The information on Panará history is compiled primarily from the Socioambiental web site (Arnt et al. 1998).

8
The Panará began the process of moving back to their land in 1995. By September 1996, there were seventy-five individuals living in their new village of Nesapoti. They have remained there until today, and the village’s population has increased to 250 people.
5.1.1 The impact of contact
For the Panará, the first impact of contact was disease. In the first three years of contact, over 85% of them died. By the time they were transferred to Xingu Park, the Panará were sick, discouraged, and disoriented. They came into contact with other Indians, and different cultures, during their time in the Xingu Park as well.
Although the Panará’s sojourn in the Xingu was traumatic, they eventually adapted to the ecosystem and social networks of the Park. Some took husbands or wives from other indigenous peoples (mostly Kayapó). There are children of marriages with other groups, whose speech often shows non- Panará characteristics.
Even though very few Panará continue to live in other villages, the influence of the Xingu indigenous groups remains. One change is that the adult women now wear long hair with fringes, the style of the Suyá. Their hairstyle before was a cropped haircut with two parallel lines running on top of their heads. Their body painting, feather decorating, and music have all assimilated aspects of the culture of other groups in the Xingu Park, mainly the Kayapó (Arnt et al. 1998f). They also adopted some new skills from other groups with whom they had came into contact. Among these were canoe building, fishing with hook and line, hunting with guns, and the cultivation of new crops.
Today, the Kayapó travel through Nesapoti, the Panará village, on their way to town, and often stop for long visits. The Panará also continue to interact with Xingu Indians on shopping trips to Guarantã. Other places where they have contact with other indigenous groups include Cuiabá and Colider. It is in these cities (primarily Colider) where the Panará’s go for health care.
Since 2003, there has been one Panará family living in the town of Guarantã. The head of the home has three wives, one whom is non-indigenous. It would seem obvious that this family unit is adapting their lifestyle and language and becoming more mainstream Brazilian. This home has become a meeting place for people from Nesapoti who are visiting town. The Panará also come into contact with ordinary Brazilians in a variety of contexts, including logging conflicts, hospital visits, and shopping trips.
There are presently three Panará children who are boarding to the south of Nesapoti in the small town of União do Norte. There, they attend a school on a Terena Indian reserve (Paul Kang, 2009, personal communication). These Terenas are monolingual in Portuguese, so it can be assumed that the Panará children are learning the national language.
Since contact, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and Fundação Nacional do Indio (FUNAI, the government’s indigenous affairs bureau) have had a large impact on the Panará. The Panará primary interaction with Portuguese speakers began with employees of FUNAI and NGOs. Specifically, the Panará told us that anthropologist Stephan Schwartzman had done a lot of work for them, and continues to be a resource. The Insitituto Socioambiental (ISA), an NGO, appears to have some influence on Panará affairs.

5.2 Lifestyle
In spite of the dislocation, catastrophic losses of tribal members, and influence from other tribal groups, the Panará still maintain many traditional customs which separate their identity from other groups. This section will include information on housing, marriage, kinship customs, food, and economic activity.
The Panará village is organized in a circle. Dwellings are positioned around the outside of the circle and there is a men’s lodge or house in the center (Ricardo Arnt et al. 1998c). each of the houses are associated with one of the four clans. The clan dwellings are located adjacent to each other. Thus, all the houses of one clan are on one side of the circular village. Across the circle are the dwellings of another clan. Wives are sought from the clan that lives across from you , not from the clan to the left or right. After marriage, a man moves into his wife’s dwelling, but still remains a member of his birth clan.
Boys live with their parents until adolescence. Once they reach the age of twelve or thirteen, they move to the men’s house. After a few years there, they begin to have relationships with girls. The boys gradually integrate into the dwelling of their future wives and start their own family. A couple is considered married after the birth of their first child.
The kinship system is strongly matrilineal. According to the Instutite Socioambiental web site, “Women do not simply belong [sic.] to the clans; they effectively are the masters of the lodges where they live with their husbands, their daughters and their daughters’ husbands, and children until they, too, will commence their own family life (Ricardo Arnt et al. 1998b).”
The Panará get their food from various sources. Besides hunting and fishing, they grow corn, potatoes, yams, cassava, squash, melons, several species of banana and peanuts. They also gather Brazil nuts, cashews, cocoa, papaya and honey (Elizabeth J. Ewart 2000:328 and (Ricardo Arnt et al. 1998d). The exchange of food is done both on a daily basis and as part of their ceremonial life (Elizabeth J. Ewart 2000:315).
One reason the Panará remained so separate may have been their different religious beliefs. For instance, they believe that their dead ancestors, who live underground, breed animals and give them to those above the ground to raise and slaughter (Ricardo Arnt et al. 1998a). Thus, the scarcity of game in the Xingu Park may have meant the dead were no longer offering animals to them. This may have been one of the reasons why they were so keen to leave the Park. They were not able to practice their religion fully in the Xingu.
The Panará Stan Anonby interviewed indicated that there were a number of means to make cash in Nesapoti village. These included driving the tractor or pickup truck, working in health care, handicrafts, recording songs for an NGO project, Projeto Pequi, and Projeto Castanha (NGO projects connected with local fruit and nuts). Another source of cash income comes from retirement funds. It appears they are rather reliant on these sources of outside help.

6. Bilingualism and sociolinguistic vitality
Through the years of contact with the Xingu tribes, many Panará gained a knowledge of Kayabi, Suya, and particularly, Kayapó. It would be expected that new words were borrowed along with the new technology. Today, they appear to be able to converse with the Kayapó that travel through Nesapoti on their way to Guarantã. As we see in section 6, this interchange can not be based on similarity between the languages.
As described in section 1, Stan Anonby interacted primarily with two Panará men at a Kayapó gathering in São Felix, in the state of Pará. One was seventeen year old, his parents were both Panará, and he was raised in Nesapoti. His friend was twenty years old, but only his father was Panará. His mother is Kayapó and he is more dominant in Kayapó. He told me that he does not speak Panará, and his friend agreed. However, his speech seemed to be a mix of Kayapó and Panará. The younger man had clearly learned some Kayapó. He was able to participate in conversations with other Kayapó, but it was obviously a struggle for him.
Their time in the Xingu Park brought the Panará into frequent contact with Portuguese speakers, such as officials and medical personnel. They have had more contact with Portuguese speakers in recent years. Some Panará have learned to speak Portuguese, and nearly all understand some of the national language (Ricardo Arnt et al. 1998g). Only a few men, however, speak Portuguese with fluency. Because of this, our communication was limited at times.
Even though the Panará are a small group, language vitality remains strong. This is due to a number of factors. It is likely that their isolation and fairly recent contact have played a large part in the maintenance of the Panará language. Their strong identity and culture has also helped, as has their desire to return to their traditional land. Other positive factors are that almost all speakers live in a single village and most don’t speak Portuguese well. Since there is only one village, there are no reported dialect differences. Thus, as the Panará population rapidly increases, the number of speakers of the language increases at the same pace.
It has been my observation that indigenous people usually have not thought about the correlation between education and sociolinguistic vitality. In fact, in communities like the Panará, where the language is strong, the concept of language loss is rarely expressed. It has been my observation that highly-educated communities generally have lower sociolinguistic vitality. So far, the impact of education on Panará does not appear to have drastically changed their lifestyle or language.
Unlike some other groups in this area of Brazil, gardens still play an important role in social life of the Panará. The exchange of food is done both on a daily basis and as part of their ceremonial life (Elizabeth J. Ewart 2000:315). The main economic activities of the Panará remain farming, hunting, and fishing. They grow corn, potatoes, yams, bananas, cassava, squash, and peanuts. In addition, they gather Brazilian nuts and other wild fruits, honey, and nuts (Arnt et al. 1998e). As long as these remain the staples of the economy, their sociolinguistic vitality should remain strong.
Outside influences are making inroads, however. Most houses in Nesapoti have television and other electronic equipment. There are projects, mostly sponsored by NGOs, aimed at helping to

11
provide the Panará with access to the Brazilian national cash economy. The Panará realize that knowledge of Portuguese is helpful in earning money.
Presently, the Panará do not have so much involvement with the greater Brazilian society so as to endanger their language. Their culture and economy remains mostly traditional. However, there are signs that they may be taking steps toward the Brazilian society and economy. For a small tribe like the Panará, those steps often bode poorly for the language.
7. Language development
There has been no official literary development for this language group. The Panará write their language, but there is no set orthography. While in São Felix, one of the Panará expressed interested in language development. He requested Stan Anonby write the Panará chiefs to seek permission for SIL to begin work with the Panará. In October 2007, one of the chiefs gave permission for SIL to learn their language.
There is a school in the village that goes up to grade three, and will soon be expanded to include grade four. Most children begin school at age six. As most schools on Brazilian reserves, the school is ostensibly bilingual. How much space is given to the indigenous language varies from school to school. It depends on how much literature is developed and how many indigenous teachers there are. According to interviews conducted in the village, there are five teachers, only two of which are Panará.
8. Conclusion
Panará is indeed a unique language, and not a dialect of Kayapó or Canela. Both the Kayapó and the Panará considered their respective languages distinct. The wordlists also provide clear evidence that over 70% of the Panará words are different from their neighbours’ languages. Furthermore, when Kayapó and Canela texts were played, the Panará’s comprehension was negligible. Although the Panará had been exposed to Kayapó, they were only able to communicate with considerable difficulty. So there doesn’t seem to be much bilingualism. Literature and literacy materials from Kayapó or Canela would not be useable by the Panará, not even adaptable.
It appears that there are a few individuals who may be fairly proficient in Portuguese. However, among others, such as those interviewed for this study, bilingualism in Portuguese is low enough that our communication was difficult at times. There may be increasing influence of Portuguese on the children who attend school, but that is purely speculative at this point.
Since the 1700’s, the Panará have battled with the Brazilians and other indigenous people. Outside influence was kept at bay until the 1970’s, when peaceful contact was finally established. The Panará’s warlike ways may have been the primary factor in keeping their unique culture, religion, and language. They were not able to assimilate into any of the other tribes in the Xingu Park. No doubt their unique language and culture played a part in keeping them separate.
In 1995, the Panará moved to their own village, Nesapoti. Today, they have even less contact with other indigenous groups than in the previous decades. Thus, the chance that their language

12
will converge into another one seems lower today. In the foreseeable future, Panará is likely to remain a strong, unique language.
Although Panará is a small language group, at this point it appears to be maintaining its vitality. As a unique language, it would need separate development to create its own literature. If they want this development, there are good grounds for providing support to their efforts and desires.
