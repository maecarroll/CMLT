Summary
This thesis is a grammar of Yine (also known as Piro), an Arawak language spoken by about 4000 people, most of whom live in the Cusco, Ucayali and Madre de Dios provinces of Peru. The description is based primarily on data gathered in the village of Diamante over a total of 11 months between 2003 and 2006. The thesis consists of 13 chapters. The ﬁrst chapter serves as an introduction to the language and its speakers, providing a overview of the language and its typological proﬁle, and is followed by a description of its phonological system in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 presents the closed word classes, and in Chapter 4 the structure and grammatical status of adjectives are addressed. Chapters 5 to 7 are centred around the class of nouns, presenting their lexical subcategories and morphological structure before treating the structure and organization of the noun phrase and, ﬁnally, the means by which they are derived from other word classes. In Chapter 8 the discussion moves to the verb , its structure and the morphology unique to verbal predicates. Both verbal and nonverbal predicates are treated in Chapter 9, with a focus on their morphological structure and the categories expressed in bound predicate morphology. The roles expressed by the predicate’s core arguments, and the manipulation of those roles, are treated in Chapter 10. Chapter 11 to 13 deal with syntactic organization. The basic structure of the declarative clause is described in Chapter 11, and negation, politeness, and non-declarative clause types including interrogatives, exclamatives, and imperative strategies are described in Chapter 12. Finally, Chapter 13 discusses the relationships and strategies involved when linking more than one clause together in a single sentence.

Acknowledgements
My foremost thanks go to the people of Diamante, who generously and respectfully incorporated me into their daily lives and shared with me their beautiful, fascinating language. I am especially grateful to my primary consultants: Juan, Dedith, Nora, Consuela, Santos, Rosa, Irene, Norma, Maria, Albertina, Victor, Maria Belen and Irma, who told me their stories, unfailingly worked through hours of tedious transcription, and answered my often-strange questions. More than that, they brought me into their families, sharing their homes, friendship and hard-won food with me. Thanks also to Hilda for providing a place to stay when I ﬁrst arrived; to Mariluz and Antonio, Sonia and Tomas, Maria Belen, and Albertina for continued accommodations; and, especially, to Victor and those who helped him build a house for me.
The daunting ﬁrst trips into the ﬁeld were very much smoothed by Marianne van Vlaardingen and the staff at Pantiacolla Tours: thank you for the transportation, information and kindness. Lara Foy was very helpful during my initial stay, when my Spanish left even more to be desired than it does now. Finally, Minna Opas gave me invaluable help ﬁnding consultants and sharing her knowledge of the Yine and her experiences in Diamante.
I would like to thank Sasha Aikhenvald for her enthusiastic supervision and for her famous record-time reading and comments on early chapter drafts. Heartfelt thanks also to Randy LaPolla and Simon Overall for taking over the task of supervising me, and for their ever-patient and insightful answers, discussions, and comments.
A doctorate can be a bumpy road and we need emotional and social support just as much as intellectual training. Sheena Van Der Mark was a constant, selﬂess friend who helped me through every difﬁcult time. I cannot express how much her friendship has meant to me. Steve Peters helped me stay sane during an insane time. Siew-Peng Condon went above and beyond more times than I even know. I could not have ﬁnished

this grammar without her help, support, and genuine, much-valued care for me. My sincere gratitude also to Roger Wales and Tim Brown, and so many others at La Trobe who made it possible for me to resume my studies after a hiatus.
The RCLT is an amazing place to work on a grammar and to learn about an incredible range of languages. It was inspiring to work with such an intelligent, generous, and supportive group of people. In addition to those I have already mentioned, I owe a special thanks to Stephen Morey, Tonya Stebbins, Roberto Zariquey-Biondi, Yvonne Treis, Seino von Breugel, Stefan Dienst, Carola Emkow, David Fleck, Rosemary Beam de Azcona, Gerd Jendraschek, and so many others for giving me such excellent examples of how to be a linguist and a ﬁeldworker. Roberto and Yvonne even took it a step further, making sure I didn’t starve during those times when everything took a back seat to writing.
I could not have done this research without the ﬁnancial assistance I was given. My studies and living expenses were funded by the International Postgraduate Research Scholarship and the La Trobe University Postraduate Research Scholarship, and the RCLT provided for my ﬁeld expenses.
Finally, to my family. You never wavered in your support, encouragement and love; you tolerated the months at a time when I was off the grid, and the years when I was on the other side of the world; you always believed in me. I love you all more than I can say. And to Michaela: you were like a sister, and you left us too soon. I miss you.

1 Introduction
This thesis presents a description of Yine, an Arawak language spoken primarily in Peru on the south-western edge of the Amazon basin. Figure 1.11 illustrates the location of Yine communities in Peru, situated in the departments of Cusco, Ucayali, Madre de Dios, and Loreto.
Figure 1.1: Map of Yine communities
1The map was compiled based on the following sources: Instituto del Bien Comun (Sistema de Informacin sobre Comunidades Nativas de la Amazona Peruana, en convenio con organizaciones indgenas y con la colaboracin de AIDESEP, ACPC, CEDIA y PETT. Lima, May 2009); and the Federacion Nativa del R´ıo Madre de Dios y Aﬂuentes, (http://fenamad.org.pe/sig.htm)

The principal territory of the Yine is in the Ucayali Department and lies along the Urubamba River upstream (south) from its conﬂuence with the Tambo to form the Ucayali River. There are several communities in this area (see the larger inset in Figure 1.1) and the Yine population is greatest here. In Madre de Dios, the largest Yine community is Diamante on the Alto Madre de Dios River; other communities are Isla de Los Valles at the conﬂuence of the Manu and Madre de Dios, and further east on the Las Piedras River are Monte Salvado and Puerto Nuevo (see the smaller inset in Figure 1.1). In the Department of Loreto, the communities of Libertad and Isolaya lie on the banks of the Cushabatay River near its conﬂuence with the Ucayali.
Estimates of the number of Yine speakers vary from 2500-5000 depending on the source. The Ethnologue states an ethnic population of between 4000 and 5000, with the number of speakers estimated at around 4000 (Lewis 2009), though numbers as high as 5000 ethnic Yine in the Urubamba area alone have been cited elsewhere (see Salazar 2008:34).
1.1 Autodenomination
In the linguistic and anthropological literature, Yine is commonly known as Piro (e.g. Matteson 1965, Wise 2008, Gow 1991), a name that appears to have its source in a Panoan word for a particular species of catﬁsh (Megalodoras sp.; cf. Smith Bisso 2003:140); other terms that have been used include Chontaquiro, Contaquiro, Pira, Pirro, Simiranch, Simirinche, and Chichineri (Lewis 2009). In Brazil and Bolivia, the Manchinere2 speak a language very similar to Yine, but the relationship between the two varieties has not been established.
The shift to the ethnonym Yine (their own word for ‘people’) has occurred relatively recently. It is to some extent artiﬁcial as an ethnonym, since in the language the word yine does not identify a single ethnic group, and the people have not been completely
2Also known as Manchineri, Manitene´re, Manitener´ı, Maxine´ri (Lewis 2009).

unanimous in embracing it for this reason (cf. Gow 1991, Opas 2008:2). Nonetheless, it has become established as standard within the linguistic literature (e.g. Sebastia´n 2006, Sebastia´n and Marlett 2008, Lewis 2009) and in other ﬁelds (e.g. Smith Bisso 2003, Opas 2008) as well as in the political sphere. In this grammar, I use Yine to refer to both the ethnic group and their language (the Yine word for the latter being yiner1 tokan1 [yine-l1 tokan1] [people-3SGM speech.of] ‘Yine person’s speech’).
The word yine itself is linguistically interesting. It is, to my knowledge, the only inherently plural lexeme in the language, meaning ‘people’ or ‘human beings’.3 To identify a single person, the sufﬁx -l1 ‘SGM’ or -lo ‘SGF’ is added: i.e. yiner1 ‘man’; yinero ‘woman’.4 These sufﬁxes function otherwise in the language as gender agreement markers (see Chapter 4) and as nominalizers (see Chapter 7) and have this singulative function only with the word yine in my corpus.
1.2 Linguistic proﬁle
1.2.1 Genetic afﬁliation
Yine is a member of the Arawak language family, one of the largest families in South America. The history, genetic relationships, and general characteristics of the Arawak family are treated in detail in various works in the literature (see especially Tovar 1986, Payne 1991, and Aikhenvald 1999); here I will brieﬂy summarize some key points.
The family was ﬁrst identiﬁed and named Maipuran in 1783 by Father Fillipo Salvadore Gilij. Just over a century later, it was renamed Arawak, and was referred to by this name until the mid- to late 20th century, when ongoing work on the family unfortunately resulted in confusion and even controversy about what its name should be.
3Gow (2000:49) analyzes yine as bimorphemic, composed of a root yi- and the regular plural sufﬁx -ne. There is no evidence that, at least in the current language, the word is compositional – there is no otherwise identiﬁable root yi – but given the word’s inherent plurality and the fact that -ne is the regular plural sufﬁx in the language, the possibility of a historically compositional source is worth investigating. However, as Gow notes in his footnote 4, the -ne portion of yine is included in cognate forms such as Campa -shane- (cf. Payne 1991). This weakens the plausibility of yine being historically bimorphemic.
4The lateral /l/ surfaces as a ﬂap /R/ following certain vowels, including /e/; see §2.3.4.

Noble (1965) and Matteson (1972) tentatively proposed a macro-family that included Arawak and, among others, Arawa and Harakmbut languages. This classiﬁcation used the term “Arawakan” to refer to the larger grouping, one branch of which was the “Maipuran” family. However, the methodology used in these studies did not conform to accepted comparative practice, and the postulated larger “Arawakan” family has since been discredited.
Once the putative relationships were rejected, a complication arose when referring to the group of languages that were uncontroversially accepted as forming a genetic group. It became necessary to clarify whether one was assuming the larger grouping or the smaller one. Three solutions are currently in use. Many linguists continue the use of the name “Maipuran”, not as a branch of the defunct “Arawakan” but as the name of the accepted family itself. Others, particularly in South America and Australia, use the name “Arawak” for the same thing. Finally, the name “Arawakan” continues to be in use, but now refers to the accepted group while rejecting the discredited relationships; this usage follows Kaufman (1990)’s convention for distinguishing, via the sufﬁx -an, between the family and one of its members. The intention is not to impart credibility to the defunct grouping, but to avoid potential confusion between the Arawak(an) family and the Arawak (Lokono) language. In this grammar, I follow the South American tradition and use the term “Arawak”.
Although the set of languages belonging to the Arawak language family is generally agreed upon, their internal organization is the subject of ongoing research and much work remains to be done. Languages that are now uncontroversially considered to be members of this family are represented in Figure 1.1, according to the current understanding of the internal relationships. The organization presented here is largely adopted from Danielsen (2007 ﬁg.1.1), an adaptation of Aikhenvald (1999) incorporating work by Facundes (2002); there is some inﬂuence from Payne (1991) and Lewis (2009) as well. Yine’s direct genetic line is indicated in bold type.

It is generally accepted that Yine’s closest linguistic relative is Apurina˜, a language spoken along the Purus River in Brazil (see Facundes 2000, 2002 for further detail). Yine has also been cited as the closest relative of In˜apari, a language whose membership to the Arawak family was established in Valenzuela (1991). In˜apari, once believed to be extinct, is maintained by a handful of speakers in the Madre de Dios Department near Puerto Maldonado (Parker 1999). It has been named as the language of the Mascho-Piro (cf. Stiglich 1908), a group living in voluntary isolation in Madre de Dios, but Parker identiﬁes them as distinct based on his ﬁeld notes on the two languages (Parker 1999 fn. 2). A comparative study in Facundes (2002) offers tentative support for a subgrouping within the Purus branch that includes Apurina˜, Yine, and In˜apari; but the relationships to this (putative) subgrouping of Mashco-Piro and the language of the Manchinere remain to be determined.
Culturally, the Yine have much more in common with other Arawak groups in the Urubamba/Ucayali region, especially the Campa, Matsiguenga and Yanesha, as well as with the Panoan-speaking Shipibo-Conibo than they do with their closest linguistic relatives. This has received a considerable amount of attention in the anthropological literature (see, for example, the studies in Hill and Santos-Granero 2002), but its linguistic consequences have not received a dedicated study of their own. The impact on the Yine language (and vice versa) of the sustained contact and close cultural ties with these other groups is a research topic that would greatly enrich our understanding of these languages.
1.2.2 Varieties of Yine
Very little information is available on dialectal variation within the Yine language. Sebastia´n (2006:2) provides an informal list of four Spanish words, comparing their equivalents in the Urubamba, Cushabatay, and Brazilian speech varieties. Though the examples are few and not intended as a systematic comparison, they are indicative that both phonological and lexical differences exist. I am also aware of some minor
6

differences between the Urubamba variety and that spoken in Madre de Dios. Again, these differences have not been systematically studied, but informal conversations with people in Diamante suggest that they involve both phonological and morphological variation as well as lexical differences.
To my knowledge, there have been no studies done on the Yine spoken in the communities along the Cushabatay and Las Piedras rivers. Although I conducted my ﬁeldwork in Diamante, I can contribute very little about the Madre de Dios variety for the reasons outlined in §1.3.2 below; the description in this grammar is based on data collected with speakers from the Urubamba river communities. Much further work is needed to determine the extent and nature of variation in the Yine language. A corpus including data from the Madre de Dios and Loreto regions would in particular provide valuable insight into the Yine language and its relationship to other Arawak languages.
1.2.3 Linguistic proﬁle
This section provides a typological proﬁle of Yine as an Arawak language. The principal works consulted for information about general Arawak characteristics are Payne (1991), Aikhenvald (1999), and Wise (1986).
Yine’s phonological system is fairly typical of Arawak languages, with a few notable departures. There are sixteen consonants, with the liquids /l/ and /R/ showing only a marginal contrast and limited distribution, and ﬁve vowels, including the high central unrounded /1/. Length and nasality are not contrastive. Syllable structure is (C)(C)CV with a possible allowance for nasal consonants in the coda. The lack of a phonological coda position is a typical Arawak feature, but the availability of very complex onsets, where clusters of up to three consonants of (almost) any combination are permitted, is highly unusual for the family. Yine’s stress system is, tentatively, bidirectional: primary stress is anchored to the penultimate syllable and secondary stresses are assigned from left to right; but there is considerable variation in the latter and the system requires further study. Stress assignment not quantity or quality sensitive.

Open word classes include nouns, verbs, and (by derivation) adjectives. The latter share many properties with nouns and few with verbs, but can be identiﬁed as a distinct word class. Nouns are lexically marked for alienable versus inalienable possession, a distinction which has morphological and syntactic consequences. The class of inalienable nouns includes kinship terms, body parts, some objects, and classiﬁcatory roots that characterize their possessors according to properties like size, shape, or consistency. Secondary possession of inalienable nouns is productive and marked using the morphology of possessed alienable nouns. Grammatical gender distinguishes masculine versus feminine gender for all but a subset of inalienable nouns. There is one number-marking sufﬁx, expressing plural, which is obligatory for human referents but optional otherwise.
There are nine nominalizing sufﬁxes. Nominalization is very productive and prevalent; it also serves as a relativization strategy as the language lacks a dedicated relative clause construction. Attributive and privative preﬁxes, common to many Arawak languages, derive adjectives from other parts of speech. Verbs can be derived using one of several formative sufﬁxes, the most common being another typical Arawak sufﬁx -ta, which has little if any semantic content.
The overall morphological proﬁle of Yine is typical of Arawak languages. It is polysynthetic, agglutinating, head-marking, and almost entirely sufﬁxing with only a handful of preﬁxes. There is no case marking, but oblique participants in the clause must have one of three sufﬁxes marking them as such.
Predicates have the extensive range of morphology expected of southern Arawak languages. Up to two arguments may be indexed on the predicate. Argument indexing is, generally speaking (see §3.2.2), in complementary distribution with overt NP arguments when the latter precede the predicate, and obligatory otherwise. On verbal predicates, subjects are indexed with a pronominal preﬁx and objects with a sufﬁx. Predicates may also be headed by most other word classes, including nouns, pronouns, adjectives and adverbs. With all non-verbal predicates, only the subject may be in-
8

dexed, via a pronominal sufﬁx drawn from a paradigm almost identical to that marking the object of a transitive verbal predicate. This word-class based split-intransitivity marking is unusual in Arawak languages, which typically split based over active versus stative verbs, but it is not unique to Yine. Incorporation of nouns and certain adverbs is productive and pervasive. Incorporated nouns must be possessed (whether alienably or inalienably), and their possessor must be expressed as a core argument in the clause.
There is a large set of valency manipulating morphology, including two causatives, an applicative, two passives, two reciprocals and an associative marker. Noun incorporation also functions to rearrange valency and is often valency-increasing because of the requirement that the possessor be a core argument. Multiple valency-manipulating devices may co-occur in a single predicate, with semantic consequences that are not well understood. Predicate morphology also expresses motion, syntactic and temporal/conditional subordination, and a number of aspect, mood and aktionsart distinctions, but does not encode tense.
Constituent order is very ﬂuid both in the clause, between the predicate and its arguments, and in the noun phrase, between the head and its modiﬁers. While Yine is often cited as an SOV language (cf. Lewis 2009), I have not found clear evidence for this or any other “basic” constituent order in my research; the order seems to be sensitive to pragmatic rather than syntactic factors and the question of a basic order, if any, remains open.
1.3 This work in context
1.3.1 Previous work
Aside from a few wordlists (Izaquirre 1927: 1775 words, Carrasco 1901: 170 words), the ﬁrst major linguistic work on Yine was done by the SIL missionary linguist Esther Matteson, who worked with the Yine beginning in the late 1940’s, and in 1965 published her PhD dissertation, a grammar (cast in the tagmemics framework) and small
9

dictionary (Matteson 1965). This grammar is the data source for most subsequent work on the Yine language, including the phonological studies in Lin (1987, 1992, 1997) and Parker (1989) and for typological surveys of Amazonian and Arawak(an) languages.5. In addition to the grammar, Matteson also produced several other linguistic and anthropological studies, including a grammar sketch in Matteson (1951), papers on Yine phonology and morphology (Matteson 1954; Matteson and Pike 1958), and an analyzed text (Matteson 1955),
The second major primary work on Yine is the Diccionario Piro (Wise 2008), developed in collaboration with a team of Yine speakers and originally published in 1986. It was revised for a second edition published in 2008.
Additionally, a set of bilingual educational materials have been produced by SIL in conjunction with the Peruvian Ministry of Education.6 A bilingual education program for primary school has been in effect in the Urubamba region since the 1960’s and is available through high school in Miaria; other communities, including Diamante, offer Spanish education through high school. There is no bilingual education in the Madre de Dios Department nor, to my knowledge, in Loreto.
1.3.2 Fieldwork setting
All of my ﬁeldwork was conducted in Diamante, in the Department of Madre de Dios (see the smaller inset in Figure 1.1). The data was collected over the course of two ﬁeldwork trips, the ﬁrst from October 2003 to July 2004 and the second from November 2005 to February 2006. The ﬁrst trip was divided into three stays lasting approximately 2-3 months, each followed by 2 to 3 weeks in Cusco where I replenished ﬁeldwork supplies, backed up my data, and worked on analysis.
5An important exception is the very recent work by the Yine native speaker and teacher Rittma Urqu`ıa Sebastian (Sebastia´n 2006, Sebastia´n and Marlett 2008), who, in addition to short reports on the phonology and sociolinguistic situation, has begun a new Yine-Spanish dictionary with an extract online at http://www.lengamer.org/publicaciones/diccionarios/Dic Prelim Yine.pdf.
6The Yine-language materials are available on the SIL website at the address http://www.ethnologue.com/show language.asp?code=pib.

The community of Diamante lies just upstream from the mouth of the Manu River, which serves as the entrance to the touristic zone of the Manu Biosphere Reserve, and the only air strip in the area is in Yine territory. Except for in the height of the wet season (January through March), there is a steady ﬂow of tour groups passing through the area, and many tours include a visit to Diamante. The Yine have considerable contact with tourists, researchers, medical workers, and others who either pass through the area or make use of the air strip, in addition to the already long-established contact with lumber and oil workers and gold prospectors. This steady contact provides a motivation for ﬂuency in useful contact languages, particularly Spanish, and interest in learning English has been frequently voiced in the community, though when lessons are offered they are rarely taken advantage of.
In Diamante, Yine and Spanish are both consistently used in daily life. Schooling and Catholic church activities are in Spanish, while Protestant church activities are in Yine. The consultants with whom I was able to work consistently are all bilingual, but were most comfortable speaking Yine. All of my main consultants spent the majority of their lives, and received their education, in the Urubamba area. I had more difﬁculty than I anticipated being able to work with speakers of the local dialect. This was perhaps due, at least in part, to language attitudes: the local dialect was held in lower prestige and the Urubamba variety was viewed as “correct” Yine – better for presenting to a recently-arrived linguist. While I do have a few recorded texts narrated by native Diamantinos, their transcription was problematic and they have not been properly analysed. Frequently, the recorded versions were altered to Urubamba Yine during transcription, or I was told that the recording was mistaken.7 Thus, although my ﬁeldwork was conducted in Madre de Dios, this grammar is representative of the
7In one instance, for example, I recorded and transcribed a short (about 3 min.) narrative with a young woman who had spent her whole life in Diamante. I was struck by how she consistently pronounced the word for ‘his wife’ as rhan1nro [r-hn1nro] [3-wife.of], with the r-allomorph of the 3sg masculine possessor preﬁx (the appearance of the a is an irregular, but expected, property of this word). As §3.2.1 describes, the zero-allomorph of this preﬁx is expected before consonant-initial stems, including those beginning with h: i.e. [Ø-]han1nro. When I inquired about the r-initial form with other consultants, I was told that it was incorrect and that no one speaks like that.
11

Urubamba/Ucayali dialect, and a study of the differences between the two dialects remains to be done.
1.3.3 Fieldwork methodology
The primary source of data for this grammar consists of audio recordings, totalling about 15 hours of speech recorded from ﬁfteen different speakers, both male and female, ranging in age from sixteen to about seventy; most were between thirty and ﬁfty. The bulk of the corpus consists of traditional and personal narratives, with some procedural texts and a few short conversations. The recordings were transcribed into the standard Yine orthography (see §1.4), glossed, and translated with the help of these speakers and four other consultants; conversion into IPA for presentation in this grammar was done myself. The audio corpus is supplemented by ﬁeld notes, and targeted elicitations were also conducted in order to ﬁll in paradigms and gather information about morpheme meaning, order, and co-occurrence possibilities; but formal, systematic elicitation sessions make up a relatively small proportion of the data I collected. As a result, the examples in this grammar are primarily drawn out of narratives and while they represent unprompted speech, they do not always provide for detailed illustrations in every desirable case; nor do they establish the boundaries of grammaticality. Further work on the language can help to ﬁll the gaps left by this particular methodology.
Nearly all of the examples in this thesis come from my recorded texts, and are cited according to a shorthand abbreviation of the text name and the line within the text where the example is found (e.g. “Pts3” for the third sentence in the story of the p1tsot1 ‘electric eel’). Examples taken from elsewhere in my ﬁeld notes are cited with the notebook label (A-E or a-h) and page number. Some examples are taken, after conﬁrmation with my consultants, from the Yine-Spanish dictionary and cited as such with DP (Diccionario Piro). In general, I have avoided repeating examples from Matteson’s work or from the SIL materials unless they bear directly on the discussion at hand, as this grammar is intended to be a description of the language as I encountered
12

it and based on data that I personally recorded. Where they occur, Matteson’s examples are cited as EM along with the page number in Matteson (1965).

1.4 Orthography

The current standard orthography for Yine differs only slightly from that used in Mat-

teson (1965): they are identical for the vowels, and in the consonants they differ only

in the representation of the palatal, palatoalveolar, and laryngeal consonants. The sys-

tem employed in this grammar differs slightly from both of these, as I follow a broad

IPA transcription rather than an orthographic convention in presenting the examples. A

comparison of the three systems is presented in Table 1.2, organized according to the

conventional alphabetical order. Parentheses indicate the ofﬁcal IPA equivalent where

it differs from the symbols used in this grammar.

2 Phonology and Phonetics
This chapter provides an overview of the Yine phonological system, addressing the phoneme inventory in §2.1, syllable structure in §2.2, morphophonological processes in §2.3, stress in §2.4, and intonation contours in §2.5.
There are a few noteworthy aspects of Yine phonology. Like a number of Amazonian languages, Yine’s phoneme inventory includes a nasalized laryngeal continuant; in Yine, the nasality can be demonstrated to be a distinctive feature of the nasal itself. As such, it embodied what Matisoff (1975) calls “rhinoglottophilia” – the somewhat surprising connection between laryngeal articulations and nasality. Syllable structure is also unusual, particularly for an Arawak language, in allowing an almost unconstrained combination of up to three consonants in onset position, but lacking codas at an underlying level. The stress system in Yine is problematic. It has been described as bidirectional in previous works on the language, but new data exempliﬁed in §2.4 casts doubt on that analysis.
Examples throughout this grammar are given in a broad (phonemic) IPA transcription, with the exception of the palatal glide which I write with the Americanist symbol /y/ rather than IPA /j/. In the current chapter, further phonetic detail is occasionally useful; in such examples I enclose the example in square brackets [ ] following standard IPA practice.
2.1 Phoneme Inventory
The Yine phoneme inventory consists of 5 vowels and 16 consonants. 15

2.1.1 Vowels
The ﬁve vowel phonemes are /i, e, a, o, 1/. There are no diphthongs, and length and nasality are not phonemic.
Figure 2.1 below provides F2 vs F1 scatterplots for one male and one female speaker, with ten tokens of each vowel, to show the distribution of the vowels over the acoustic space. These measurements were taken from stressed, unnasalized vowels. Unstressed vowels show essentially the same distribution, somewhat more centralized but without any signiﬁcant reduction.

b. wale ‘3SGM’ wala ‘3SGF’

e. p1myo ‘your hand’ pamyo ‘ﬁve’

b. hikneka ‘(to) master’ hiknoka ‘(to) throw out’

/i/ vs. /1/ /e/ vs. /o/

Allophonic nasalization of vowels occurs following m, n, and h, and never spreads beyond the syllable. Because it is predictable and exceptionless, I will not mark it in transcriptions unless it is immediately relevant to the discussion. Nasalization triggered by the laryngeal continuant is treated in detail in §2.1.2.3.

2.1.2 Consonants

Yine has 16 consonant phonemes, listed in Table 2.1, which are distributed over six places of articulation and seven manners of articulation. Voicing is not contrastive in any series.

2.1.2.1 Obstsruents
All Yine obstruents are voiceless and unaspirated. The stop series contrasts four places of articulation: bilabial /p/, apical-alveolar /t/, palatal /c/, and velar /k/. On a purely phonetic level, these often undergo partial voicing lenition between vowels in natural or rapid speech.
The palatal stop /c/ varies freely between [c] and [cc¸], a variation which is reﬂected in how the segment is characterized in the literature: it is analyzed as a palatalized
17

stop /tj/ in Matteson (1954) and Wise (2008), and as a palatal affricate /tc¸/ in Matteson (1965) and Sebastia´n and Marlett (2008). It is analyzed here as a palatal stop because it frequently surfaces with very little frication in the release. While it is common for palatal stops to have a highly fricated release (Ladefoged and Maddieson 1996:30-1), it is not common for affricates to lack such frication. Additionally, like the other stops (but unlike the affricates), /c/ optionally undergoes some degree of voicing lenition between vowels.
The fricatives and affricates do not undergo voicing lenition.1 Fricatives contrast three places of articulation: apical alveolar /s/, laminal postalveolar /S/, and palatal /c¸/. Both affricates are coronal: apical alveolar /ts/ and laminal postalveolar /tS/.
The obstruents all exhibit some restrictions on their distribution before certain vowels in native lexical roots.

• the apical obstruents /s, ts/ do not occur before the high front vowel /i/ (exception: -stsi ‘side of’ has /ts/ before /i/); /t/ does so only across morpheme boundaries
• all non-apical obstruents /S, Ù, c, c¸, k/ are unattested before the high central vowel /1/
• c¸ does not occur before any non-front vowel /a, o, 1/

Given the highly restricted distribution, the status of these segments as distinct phonemes is naturally in question. Their phonemic status can be afﬁrmed by the following minimal and near-minimal pairs.

(3) a. salwata ‘walk around’ Salewata ‘make a nest’

/s/ vs. /S/

1The laryngeal continuant h is exceptional, if analyzed as a fricative, as it may surface with a degree of voicing; see §2.1.2.3.
18

b. pika ‘be afraid’ pica ‘you (sg.)’
c. sero- ‘red’ c¸er1 ‘horseﬂy’

/k/ vs. /c/ /s/ vs. /c¸/

(4) a. hitoko ‘inside of’ hiÙoÙo ‘rough’
b. hita ‘1SG’ hitsa ‘its thread’
c. Sic¸i ‘corn’ Ùic¸i ‘earth, land’
d. sern1 ‘color’ tsern1 ‘size’

/t/ vs. /Ù/ /t/ vs. /ts/ /S/ vs. /Ù/ /s/ vs. /ts/

2.1.2.2 Nasals
There are two nasal stops, bilabial /m/ and alveolar /n/, and a laryngeal continuant that I also categorize as a nasal phoneme. This categorization based on the segment’s allophonic realizations, which all preserve nasality; the details are provided in the next section.
The place contrast in nasal consonants is illustrated in (5). The contrast between non-nasal stops and nasal stops is illustrated in (6).
(5) a. m1mata ‘not know’ n1mata ‘I know’
b. neta ‘I see’ heta ‘you (pl) see; to see’

(6) a. m1mata ‘not know’ p1mata ‘you (sg) know’
b. napoka ‘I arrive’ tapoka ‘she arrives’
19

2.1.2.3 /h˜ /
The laryngeal h shows a high degree of variation in its phonetic realization depending on its segmental environment. Its behavior is strikingly different from the other phonemes in the language, which show very little allophonic variation and never surface with a major place of articulation other than the one they are speciﬁed for.
Nasalization is of direct relevance to the analysis of h, so it will be indicated in transcriptions in this section. Throughout the rest of this grammar, it is not shown because it is fully predictable and there is no nasal/oral contrast in laryngeals.
Before a vowel, h is realized as a voiceless laryngeal continuant with both nasal and oral (but primarily nasal) airﬂow. Between vowels, it surfaces with a variable amount of voicing. In sequences of two consonants (CC sequences), h is relatively unaffected if it is the second consonant, surfacing as it would in any hV context. It is only when h precedes another consonant that its surface realization shows signiﬁcant variation. The allophony of h in hC sequences is described in detail throughout the remainder of this section.
As a general pattern, before any consonant C2 h assimilates to the place and (buccal) continuancy of C2, but surfaces with the opposite voicing value; that is, if C2 is voiceless h will be voiced and if C2 is voiced h will be voiceless or partially voiced. Since (aside from h) all voiceless phonemes are obstruents in Yine and all voiced phonemes are sonorants, this amounts to the same thing as saying that h is voiced before obstruents and voiceless before sonorants.
Where C2 = Non-nasal stop: h surfaces as a homorganic voiced nasal stop.2
(7) [ Ùiyampot1ta ] Ùiyaha-pot1-ta cry-INTNS-VCL ‘He was sobbing.’ (MyI178)
2The vowel deletion that creates the hC cluster in these and many other examples is addressed in §2.3.1.
20

(8) [ t1c¸hayentapl1 ] t-hic¸ha-yehi-ta-pa-l1 3SGF-search.for-VICIN-VCL-ELV-3SGM ‘She went to search in his area.’
(9) [ çiwR1saNkaka ] c¸iwR1-sahi-kaka thread-ball.of-DISTR ‘each ball of thread’ (MyI178)
Where C2 = Fricative: h surfaces as a voiced nasal continuant, usually more glide- than fricative-like: there is little if any frication and its quality is transitional between the preceding vowel and the fricative. The vowel following the fricative is not nasalized in this situation.
(10) [ raj˜c¸ita ] r-hahc¸ita 3-ask.for ‘He asks for (something).’ (MyI178)
Where C2 = Nasal, Liquid or Glide: Before a sonorant consonant, as before a vowel, h surfaces as a nasalized laryngeal continuant; it is usually voiceless but may have some degree of voicing. A release burst or intrusive vowel (see §2.2.3 below) can often be detected between the h and the sonorant.
This is one of the few situations where there may be no discernible nasality in the environment of h. However, there is evidence that the lack of nasality is due to the lack of a salient host rather than the loss or absence of the nasal feature. This evidence comes from two sources. First, if there is an intrusive vowel, that vowel has a nasal quality, as in (11) and (12):
21

(11) [ sah(@˜)maneta ] sahi-mane-ta paint-body.of-VCL ‘paint one’s body’
(12) [ h˜o˜h˜ (@˜)R1 ] hohr1 unchala ‘(type of bird)’
Second, a glide following h often has a clearly perceptible nasal quality:
(13) [ h˜ y˜opr1h˜a˜nno ] h-yopr1ha-n1-no 2PL-cut.fringe-ANTIC-1SG ‘(You pl) cut a fridge (on) me.’ (Hetn53)
Where C2 = h: There is a unique pattern of allophony when h occurs adjacent to another h. In this situation, the second h is unaffected, but the ﬁrst h, while always voiced and nasal, varies widely in its degree of supralaryngeal constriction. It may surface: - with a vowel-like articulation matching that of the preceding vowel, as in (14):
(14) [ h˜˜iyaa˜h˜˜imni ] hiyaho-hima-ni then-QUOT-IMP.DECL ‘then, reportedly’ wap211
- with a small degree of closure similar to that of a velar approximant (15):
(15) [ yopr1î˜ himata ] Ø-yopR1ha-hima-ta 3-cut.fringe-QUOT-VCL ‘He cut (her) fringe.’ (hetn71)
22

- or with a very closed, stop-like articulation approaching to or equal to that of [N] as in (16). It is not unusual for there to be a discernible intra-cluster release (transcribed with [ _ ]) between the two h’s (17), particularly in emphatic speech.3
(16) [ serostaN_h˜a˜ta´: ] sero-sta-ha-ta´: red-chest.of-liquid.of-EXCL ‘(such) a blood red chest!’ (MyI166)

(17) [ ÙiyaN_h˜˜imanatatkana´: ] Ø-Ùiyaha-hima-na-ta-na-tka-na+´: 3-cry-QUOT-DUR-VCL-CMPV-PFV-3PL-EXCL
‘He was crying for such a long time, reportedly.’ (MyI177)

It can be noted that depending on what segment class it precedes, h is variably voiced and exhibits varying degrees of buccal constriction at various places of articulation. The only consistent feature is nasality. Furthermore, it can trigger allophonic nasalization on the following segment, always if it is a vowel and sometimes if it is a glide. Because h’s allophones are always nasalized, and because h triggers a change of nasality in its environment, I conclude, following Huffman (1993:307), that the feature [+nasal] is part of its phonemic representation.
3The lengthening and high pitch of the ﬁnal vowel in these examples is characteristic of certain exclamative constructions; see §2.5.3 below.
23

2.1.2.4 Liquids
The liquids /l/ and /R/ exhibit only a marginal contrast and the distinction between them carries a very low functional load. Minimal or near-minimal pairs, like those in (18), can be found, and illustrate their individual phonemic status:
(18) a. -pRo ‘disc-shaped object of’ -plo ‘belly button of’
b. -pRa ‘domestic animal of’ -pla ‘crop of, maw of’
c. kopR1ta ‘(to) cross (e.g. a bridge)’ kopl1 ‘chigoe ﬂea’
d. kamR1ta ‘to work’ kamla ‘termite’
However, the contrast between the lateral and rhotic is neutralized to /R/ following the vowels /i/, /e/, and /1/; and following /n/, the segment surfaces as a voiced alveolar stop [d]. This neutralization has a signiﬁcant impact in the morphology because of the relatively large number of sufﬁxes that begin with /l/; see §2.3.4 below.
The liquids are also the only class of consonants that are restricted in their distribution within the phonological or grammatical word. Setting aside obvious loanwords (such as lapi ‘pen, pencil’ from Spanish lapiz), the lateral never occurs word-initially, and the rhotic only does so as a 3SGM / 3PL pronominal preﬁx. Neither is attested root-initially, but afﬁxes beginning with both are attested.
2.1.2.5 Approximants
There are two approximants, both of which are voiced. The palatal /y/ has a vocalic allophone [i] when it appears between two consonants, which happens only in morphological concatenation; this is described in §2.3.3 below.
The labial-velar glide /w/ surfaces as [w] in most environments, and has the allophones [Bﬂ] and [î]. The former, with little discernible velar quality and with spread lips, occurs before or between the front vowels /i/ or /e/:
24

(19) a. wica [Bﬂica] ‘2PL’ b. kawini [kaBﬂini] ‘when he bathes’ c. kewe [keBﬂe] ‘dog’ d. hewi [h˜e˜Bﬂi] ‘here’
Between two low vowels /a/, /w/ may be pronounced with little or no labial articulation, but retaining the velar articulation; i.e. [î]. This pronunciation seems to be in free variation with [w] and is very common in speech of a relaxed pace or register.
(20) a. hawa [h˜aîa] ‘and’ b. hoyeÙnokawa [hoyeÙnokaîa] ‘morning’
The palatal glide is not attested before /1/, but appears in all other environments.
(21) a. [yimaka] ‘teach’ [yawo] ‘sloth’ [yeÙno] ‘night’
b. [kayi] ‘afternoon’ [p1yo] ‘ray’ [hiyeka] ‘curassow’
2.2 Syllable structure
2.2.1 Syllable template
The syllable template in Yine is (C)(C)CV(N). In lexical roots, the minimal syllable is CV, and the maximal syllable is CCV. This holds for both root-initial and root-medial position. In grammatical words, an additional onset consonant may be added to the onset during morphonological concatenation. There is little evidence for phonologically licensed coda consonants in the language, though some data indicates that nasal codas are permissible.
25

All words (phonological or grammatical) are vowel-ﬁnal, and insofar as it can be determined, word-internal CC sequences are syllabiﬁed into onset position. My principle basis for this claim comes from my experience transcribing Yine texts, during which my consultants would spontaneously break long words into more manageable chunks and repeat them slowly, distinctly, and often for me. Almost without exception, the units thus dictated to me were of the shape (C)CV, and did not necessarily match up with morpheme boundaries. For example, a word like kowÙohatatnakna ‘they are ﬁshing again’, with the morphological structure of (22a), would be syllabiﬁed as (22b); similarly for sac¸r1khimatkanaktatkana ‘they were completely surrounded everywhere, reportedly’ in (23).
(22) a. Ø-kowÙohata-tnak(a)-na b. ko.wÙo.ha.ta.tna.kna
(23) a. Ø-sac¸r1k(a)-hima-t(a)-ka-na-kta-tka-na b. sa.c¸R1.khi.ma.tka.na.kta.tka.na
The nasal stops were the most consistent exceptions to this open-syllable dictation. They were often (but inconsistently) treated as ambisyllabic, both closing the preceding syllable and opening the next: r1pteka-m-ta-tnaka [r1.pte.kam.mta.tna.ka] ‘he gave a start again’. They were never treated as only codas.
Words beginning with three consonants in sequence are very common. They arise whenever a Class 2 pronominal preﬁx is attached to a CC-initial stem; for example nmÙira-te [1SG-spider.monkey-PSSD] ‘my spider monkey’; p-knoya-te ‘your tortoise’.4 All three consonants are pronounced and there are no phonological processes that apply to reduce or change such clusters when they arise.5
4These are elicited forms. A more natural way to express ownership of an animal in Yine employs the periphrastic possessive construction described in §5.2.3: e.g. no-pra mÙira [1SGPSSR-pet.of spider.monkey] ‘my pet/domesticated spider monkey’.
5The laryngeal h, which is employed as the 2PL preﬁx, is the only exception. When attached to a stem beginning with a consonant, h assimilates according to the pattern described in §2.1.2.3 above.
26

Triconsonant clusters are only attested word-initially, with nasals again being exceptional. Word-internally, vowel deletion that is normally obligatory at the boundary before certain sufﬁxes is blocked if it would create a -CCC- sequence; this is described and exempliﬁed in §2.3.1 below (see example (29) in particular). If the ﬁrst consonant is a nasal, however, vowel deletion at least optionally applies even where it results in -CCC-. This is well-attested with /m/, and less so with /n/, but the extent to which it occurs has not been fully explored to date. Examples are given in (24).
(24) a. rethimamtkanna r-heta-hima-m-ta-ka-na-na 3-see-QUOT-NONDUR-VCL-PASS-CMPV-3PL ‘They were seen / caught sight of.’ (Mshk80)
b. ricamtna r-hica-m-ta-na 3-be-VCL-3PL ‘They were (like that) for a while.’ (PkN50)
c. n1nkyanro n-hinka-ya-na-lo 1SG-shoot-APPL-CMPV-3SGF ‘I shot it there.’ (Caz29)
2.2.2 Phonotactics
Consonant clusters in Yine show enough range in attested combinations, both wordinitially and word-internally, to suggest that there are no sonority-based restrictions imposed on them. The monomorphemic words in (25) provide illustrative examples.
(25) a. c¸piro ‘lizard’ b. mÙira ‘spider monkey’ c. nso ‘genipa’ d. -tpali‘thigh of’
27

However, there are a few apparently banned clusters. Sequences of identical consonants are not attested, nor are affricate-only clusters; and of the possible coronal obstruent combinations only st and SÙ occur with any frequency:
(26) a. histaka ‘(to) cut’ -stono ‘cylindrical object of; trunk of (body or tree)’
b. SaSÙoka ‘ﬂex, bend without breaking’ -SÙeha ‘curly object (hair) of’
Coronal obstruents freely cluster with non-coronals.
(27) a. -sp1 ‘lip of’ hiSpaka ‘exit, emerge’ tspata ‘guava’ kapÙo- ‘strong’
b. -skita ‘V-intersection of’ haSkata ‘bite’ tkaÙi ‘sun’ -tski ‘pelvis of’ Ùkot1 ‘squirrel monkey’
2.2.3 Intra-cluster release / intrusive vowel
A very salient feature of Yine consonant clusters is the prevalence of an audible interval between the release of the ﬁrst consonant (C1) and the closure of the second consonant (C2). The duration and quality of this interval varies considerably; it is never obligatory and does not occur if C1 is a fricative. Based on a preliminary scan of tokens, there does seem to be a limited degree of predictability: if C1 and C2 are both stops (and therefore voiceless), the interval consists of little more than a release burst; and if one of the consonants is a sonorant (and therefore voiced), it is typically voiced and may have a duration approaching that of a full vowel. The quality of the interval, however, does not seem to be predictable. The range of variation in how these intervals are realized, their optionality, and the (apparent) inﬂuence of the immediate phonological environment all suggest that they do not have a phonological origin and are purely
28

phonetic. Hall (2006) draws a distinction between epenthetic vowels, which have a phonological reality, and intrusive vowels, which do not. The vowel-like intervals in Yine can be identiﬁed as intrusive vowels; but this term is not suitable for situations where there is only a release burst. Since it is not ideal to use two distinct terms for the realizations of essentially the same phenomenon, I use “intra-cluster release” as a cover term for both the intrusive vowel and the release burst.
2.3 Morphophonology
2.3.1 Boundary vowel deletion
A process of vowel deletion occurs at two levels in Yine: at the boundary between a stem and a sufﬁx, where it is obligatory with certain sufﬁxes; and at the boundary between two grammatical words, where it is always optional.
2.3.1.1 Word-internal vowel deletion
A subset of Yine sufﬁxes trigger the deletion of the ﬁnal vowel in the stem to which they attach. This deletion is obligatory with the relevant sufﬁxes, and incorrect retention of the vowel renders the word unintelligible. Whether a sufﬁx triggers boundary vowel deletion or not is lexically speciﬁed. It cannot be predicted based on grammatical function: for example, while four of the possessed status sufﬁxes trigger vowel deletion, one (-te) does not. Nor is it determined by phonological form: the applicative sufﬁx -ya triggers deletion, but the homophonous oblique marker does not. The only sufﬁxes that predictably do not trigger vowel deletion are those that begin with two consonants: e.g. -yma ‘comitative’, -tka ‘perfective’, -mn1 ‘in series’, etc. These are banned from triggering apocope because if they did it would derive a triconsonant cluster.6
6The extent to which nasal stops are exceptional with all of these sufﬁxes requires further research.
29

(28) a. netl1 ‘I see him.’ n-heta-l1 1SG-see-3SGM

d. nSimne n-Sima-ne 1SG-ﬁsh-PSSD
‘my ﬁsh’

(pronominal sufﬁx) (internal aspect) (frustrative) (possessed)

Vowel deletion is blocked if it would result in a sequence of three consonants:

(29) a. netatkal1 n-heta-tka-l1 1SG-see-PFV-3SGM
‘I saw him.’

* netatkl1

n-hinka-c¸e-ta-ya-na-l1

1SG-shoot-FREQ-VCL-APPL-CMPV-3SGM

‘I kept shooting it there.’

The elative sufﬁx -pa is exceptional in that it triggers the deletion of the penultimate stem vowel rather than the ﬁnal one.

(30) a. rethimtapanr1na r-heta-hima-ta-pa-na-l1-na 3-see-QUOT-VCL-ELV-CMPV-3SGM-3PL
‘They went to see it, reportedly.’ (Oso39)

‘He went to shoot (a spider monkey)’ (Nwd47)
c. r1tkapanro r-hitaka-pa-n1-lo 3-put-ELV-ANTIC-3SGF
‘He went to place it.’

As with the other vowel-deleting sufﬁxes, deletion triggered by -pa is blocked if it would create a triconsonant cluster:

(31) a. nsalwatapa n-salwata-pa 1SG-walk.around-ELV
‘I went for a walk.’
b. hic¸hapatka hic¸ha-pa-tka search.for-ELV-PFV
‘to go to search now’

*nsalwtapa *hc¸hapatka

2.3.1.2 Word-boundary vowel deletion
Boundary vowel deletion may also occur across grammatical word boundaries within a prosodic phrase. At this boundary, vowel deletion is optional, being more common in naturally-paced or rapid speech, and generally avoided in careful speech. The examples in (32)-(35) illustrate this, indicating the word boundary with a hyphen (the hyphen will be omitted elsewhere in the grammar); in each case, the deleted vowel could be retained with no change in meaning.

2.3.2 Cluster repair
Consonant clusters, including those that are not attested morpheme-internally, are often derived during word-formation due to boundary vowel deletion. Most of these derived clusters are well-tolerated and surface unchanged, but some do not. Those involving the laryngeal nasal were described in §2.1.2.3 above; this section describes the process of C1 deletion plus compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel, which is obligatory with sequences of stops, affricates or liquids with the same place of articulation (36), optional with identical approximants (37) (and with hh as described above), and unattested with identical nasal stops (38). Data regarding fricatives is not available. Note that this process only applies word-internally: word-initial clusters surface unchanged, as with pp in (38).

optional non-occurring

2.3.3 Vowel mutation before -ya: /a/ > [i]
The applicative sufﬁx -ya (but not the homophonous oblique sufﬁx) is among those that trigger deletion of the preceding vowel. If -ya is followed by a sufﬁx that likewise triggers deletion, -ya is realized as -i.
33

(39) hawla nÙanicika hawla n-Ùanica-ya-ka there 1SG-invite-APPL-PASS ‘I am invited over there.’
If apocope is blocked at the boundary between a verb stem and the applicative sufﬁx -ya (because it would yield -CCC-), stem-ﬁnal /a/ mutates to [i].
(40) a. ramha ‘he is lost’ ramhiya ‘he is lost there’
b. r1c¸ha ‘he is searching’ r1c¸hiya ‘he is searching there’
c. r1mka ‘he is sleeping’ r1mkiya ‘he is sleeping there’
Further research is needed to determine whether this vowel mutation also occurs with vowels other than /a/. It is extremely rare for a verb stem to end in a vowel other than /a/, and examples where such a stem is both sufﬁxed with -ya and blocks apocope are not available in my corpus.
2.3.4 Rhotacization of -l-
When any sufﬁx beginning with l attaches to a stem ending in i, e, 1, or n, the lateral surfaces as [R].
The examples in (41) illustrate the alternation between the l-initial and r-initial allomorphs, as conditioned by the preceding vowel. The lateral occurs following the low vowels /a, o/ (41a,b), and the rhotic occurs following the high vowels /i, e, 1 / (41c-e).
(41) a. klata-l1 ‘white-SGM’ klata-lo ‘white-SGF’
b. sepro-l1 ‘crazy-SGM’ sepro-lo ‘crazy-SGF’

d. kihle-r1 ‘good-SGM’ kihle-ro ‘good-SGF’
e. kSinikan1-r1 ‘intelligent-SGM’ kSinikan1-ro ‘intelligent-SGF’
The examples in (42) illustrate how the alveolar nasal triggers the same allomorphy. Additionally, a comparison of (42b) and (42c) reveals that rhotacization applies after apocope, since the quality of the deleted vowel is irrelevant.

(42) pnika ‘you eat’
a. pnikl1 p-nika-l1 2SG-eat-3SGM ‘you eat it (masc.)’

pniklo p-nika-lo 2SG-eat-3SGF ‘you eat it (fem.)’

p-nika-na-lo

2SG-eat-CMPV-3SGM 2SG-eat-CMPV-3SGF

‘you ate it (masc.) all’ ‘you ate it (fem.) all’

The sequences il, el, nl are all unattested in my corpus;thus, rhotacization in these morphemes can be considered part of a more general phonotactic constraint at work in the language. The surface variation triggered by the attachment of pronominal preﬁxes, on the other hand, is strictly morphophonological. It involves changes that are not observed elsewhere in the language (consonant suppletion and vowel mutation) as described in the next section.

2.3.5 Preﬁx-conditioned allomorphy
As described in Chapter 3, all Class 1 pronominal preﬁxes except for 2PL trigger a special allomorphy when they attach to a stem beginning with h: the pronominal preﬁx replaces the h and, if the vowel following h is i, vowel mutation is triggered as well
35

such that the i surfaces as 1. This allomorphy is described in detail in §3.2.1.1.7 Rather than repeating the description here, I will brieﬂy illustrate the pattern and address the exceptional behavior of the 2PL preﬁx hi-.
(43) himka ‘sleep’ n1mka ‘I sleep’ r1mka ‘he sleeps’ himka ‘you (pl) sleep’
The fact that i does not mutate in the 2PL form, for which the pronominal preﬁx is h-, suggests a phonological motivation for the change where it does occur. An obvious candidate for an explanation would be a prohibition against the sequence -h1-, along the lines of the CV phonotactic restrictions noted in §2.1.2.1 above. The examples in (44) illustrate that there does not seem to be such a restriction at work here – but it must be noted that these, and derivationally related forms, represent all of the instances in which -h1- is attested in my corpus. Their rarity is consistent with perhaps a past phonological restriction, but it cannot be said that -h1- sequences are banned in the current language.

2.4 Stress
This section presents the stress system of Yine as I currently understand it; however, the description here is tentative and is only intended as preliminary.
Stress assignment in Yine is not quantity (or quality) sensitive, and it is never contrastive. The most consistent aspect of stress in Yine is in the placement of primary
7The same mutation occurs with the associative preﬁx him- and with privative m-, but not with the attributive preﬁx k-; see §4.3.1.
36

stress, which always falls on the penultimate syllable (setting aside the exclamative construction described in §2.5.3 below). Secondary prominences frequently occur on the ﬁrst syllable and on alternating syllables from left to right, excepting the syllable adjacent to the primary stress. Data illustrating this pattern is given in (45); this data is consistent with the analysis in Matteson (1965) and is the source of Yine’s reputation as having a bidirectional stress system.
(45) a. ra"watka ‘He was there.’ b. ­rawa"tkana ‘They were there.’ (Dil19) c. ­raniika"tkana ‘They were carried’ (Dil17) d. ­rawa­nata"tkana ‘They were living there.’ (Dil18) e. ­r1kSi­khimc¸ena"tl1na ‘They kept ﬁnding it, reportedly.’ (Yam48) f. ­rica­nan1­mtana"tkana ‘They went along (hungry) for a long time.’ (Dil5) g. ­sac¸r1­khima­tkanakta"tkana “They were completely surrounded everywhere, reportedly. (Mshk53)’ h. ­numla­laSye­hitanna"tkayi ‘I will untie the rope near you. (Gav13)’
The pattern illustrated in the above examples is very well-attested in my corpus, but it is not exceptionless. While primary stress is entirely predictable, secondary stresses show considerable variation. The data in (46) provide exceptions to the generalization that secondary stress alternates from the left edge rightwards. In (46a-b), it appears to alternate from the right edge, with a (secondary) prominence anchored to the left edge; and in (46c-e), the prominences do not follow the alternating-syllables pattern observed in (45). These examples, like those in (45), are all representative of patterns well-attested in my data.
(46) a. ­hiyoli­kachri"tnaka ‘A hunting one again (does something)’ (Gua8) b. ­ranika­natka"l1na ‘They carried him off’ (Hmn75) c. ­ricana­n1mtana"tkana ‘They went along doing/being (thus) for a little while’ (Dil5) d. ­tomkahhi­mamtana"tkana ‘She followed them for a while, reportedly’ (Gua27)
37

e. ­r1ta­hhimata­natka"lona ‘They gave her (a lot of) food/drink, reportedly’ (Wap36)
The data in (47) provide counterexamples to the generalization that secondary stress always falls on the ﬁrst syllable. In these, it falls on the second syllable.
(47) a. hi­yahhima"tkani ‘then it was, reportedly, (that) ... ’ (Gua27) b. sa­t1mn1na"n1ka ‘each and every one’ (Nwd14) c. re­tamka­ta"tkana ‘They tried to see’ (Wap25) d. Ùi­nakte­nan1"mtatka ‘he went along crying out in tears’ (Nwd93)
I have not found clear examples where neither of the ﬁrst two syllables is prominent (to my ear). Such an example is given in Sebastia´n and Marlett (2008), however: /tapa­l1Sakan­wathimanan1mtana"tnaka/. In fact, as this word exempliﬁes, the transcriptions throughout Sebastia´n and Marlett (particularly in the transcribed text) are suggestive of even further departure from Matteson’s bidirectional stress rules than I have described. As Sebastia´n is herself a linguistically trained native Yine speaker, her annotations have a considerable advantage over my own English-biased ones, and they underscore the need for further work to be done on the Yine stress system (if it is a “stress” system at all). Phonetic studies targeting the acoustic correlates of prominence in Yine would be especially beneﬁcial.
2.5 Intonation
The basic intonation patterns in Yine are the following: the neutral contour, which may be subdivided into smaller phrases marked off with a non-ﬁnal boundary tone; the exclamative contour, which may span over a clause or only over an adjective; and the interrogative contour used with basic polar questions.
38

2.5.1 Neutral contour
The neutral intonation contour is used with declarative clauses and with all interrogatives other than basic polar questions (cf. §2.5.4 below). This contour is characterized by level pitch gradually lowering until the last two syllables of the phrase; on the penultimate syllable there is a pitch accent, and this is followed by a sharp pitch drop on the last syllable.
2.5.2 Non-ﬁnal boundary tone
In cases where two clauses are intended to be inferentially linked, a distinct intonation contour occurs at the boundary. This non-ﬁnal contour is characterized by a sustained high pitch over the last two syllables of the ﬁrst clause, and occurs at the boundary of both subordinate and non-subordinate clauses.
2.5.3 Exclamative intonation
There are two types of exclamative intonation. Basic exclamative clauses, including those introduced with the interrogative particle (see §12.4), are characterized by an exaggerated declarative contour. Exclamative utterances that include a sense of surprise or wonder, including those in which the mirative enclitic is used (see §12.4) have a distinct contour. This contour is what I label here as the exclamative contour, and is characterized by high pitch and optional lengthening on the ﬁnal syllable of the domain. The degree of lengthening can be freely manipulated by the speaker, but regardless of how long or short the vowel is, the high pitch is strictly obligatory.
There are two syntactic domains over which the exclamative contour is attested: the clause, and the adjective in the periphrastic exclamative adjective construction (see §4.3.4). Because this is such a distinctive contour in Yine, it is illustrated with pitch traces in the traces below.
The trace in (48) illustrates a clausal exclamative intonation contour. As the trace 39

shows, the overall contour begins low and is relatively ﬂat until the ﬁnal syllable, when it rises sharply. In this case, the edge of the contour corresponds with the end of the clause.

‘He ﬂew a bit further again.’ (MyI85)

When focused on the adjective, the exclamative contour is embedded within the basic contour of the containing clause. This is illustrated in (49), where the sharp rise and sustained high pitch, corresponding to the end of the exclamative adjective, is followed by a typical declarative contour on the predicate richimata.

2.5.4 Interrogative
In most cases, questions have the same intonation as the declarative clause, but they may optionally have a rising intonation contour. This is most common with – in fact typical of – basic polar questions, which are distinguished from statements only by intonation (see §12.3.1.1). The interrogative contour is characterized by a sloping rise in pitch over the ﬁnal two syllables of the clause.

3 Closed Classes
This chapter presents and illustrates the closed word classes that are not treated in other chapters: articles §3.1, pronouns §3.2, demonstratives §3.3, adverbs §3.4, and numerals and quantiﬁers §3.5. As noted in §3.6 and §3.7, interrogative words and clause linkers are discussed elsewhere in the grammar.
Finally, in §3.8 I brieﬂy present two sets of particles – adverbial and evidential – whose grammatical status is not certain, but which are not directly treated elsewhere.

There are three articles in Yine. Two are distinguished by speciﬁcity and are mutually exclusive: the speciﬁc article sat1, and the nonspeciﬁc article pa. Both of these may also be used as quantiﬁers. The third (and most frequently occurring) article, wa, is characterized by referentiality, and can cooccur with either sat1 or pa.

3.1.1 sat1 ‘speciﬁc’
The article sat1 (masc.) / sato (fem.) identiﬁes a speciﬁc entity from a set and introduces it into the discourse.

QUOT 3-climb-3PL

‘They climbed a (certain) tree.’ (Mch18)

3.1.2 pa ‘nonspeciﬁc’
The article pa is nonspeciﬁc referent marker. A noun determined by pa occurs in its possessed form: if alienable, it must have the ‘possessed’ sufﬁx (52); if inalienable, it does not have the ‘unpossessed’ sufﬁx (53).
(52) a. pa kanawate ‘a canoe’ (kanawa-te [canoe-PSSD])
b. pa Ùic¸ne ‘some other country; someone (else)’s country’ (Ùic¸i-ne [land-PSSD])
(53) a. pa Ùrac¸i ‘a fragment’ (Ùrac¸i ‘fragment of’)
b. pa tsa ‘a cord’ (tsa ‘cord, line of’)
Pa is combined with the abstract noun hican1 ‘thing, being’, derived from the verb hica ‘be/do’ with the property nominalizer, to form a phrase that corresponds in meaning to an indeﬁnite noun: i.e. pa hican1 ‘something’.
3.1.3 wa ‘referential’
The article wa is deﬁned in terms of referentiality rather than deﬁniteness for two reasons: it can cooccur with pa or sat1; and it has certain anaphoric properties.
First, it can be used with either of the indeﬁnite articles. This is most common with the speciﬁc article sat1, where the two serve to introduce a new participant into the discourse, as in (54), or with an anaphoric function to refer to a relatively new participant whose identity or import has not yet been revealed, as in (56) below.
42

mt1r1 ]NP:O

now 1SG-tell-ANTIC-3SGM [ REF SPEC+MASC small+MASC ]

‘Now I will tell (about) the/a certain boy.’ (Paj1)

The examples in (55) and (56) are uttered a few sentences apart in the same narrative. In (55), the main character is out ﬁshing when a man (sat1 yiner1) suddenly appears on the beach near him. This man asks what he is doing and he answers. Shortly thereafter the stranger is referred to again, this time with both the referential and the speciﬁc articles (56).

there/thus say-3SGM [ REF SPEC+MASC stand-SUBJ.NOM+MSG ]

‘The one standing (on the beach) said . . . .’ (YineYami.083)

The fact that sat1 and wa can cooccur indicates that they do not represent opposing values of a single feature. The same is true of wa and pa, which do not cooccur very often in my corpus but, as the examples in (57) illustrate, are not restricted from doing so. The contrast in speciﬁcity between wa and sat1 is also highlighted in these examples.

(57) a. wa sat1 hohne ‘the one day’ b. wa pa hohne ‘some other day.’ (g51)

(58) a. wa sat1 tsapane ‘someone else’s bag, a certain man’s bag’ b. wa pa tsapane ‘someone’s bag.’ (g55)
43

Secondly, wa can, in restricted circumstances, occur alone in an NP; examples are given in (59)-(60) below. Its function when doing so is not well understood, but it appears to have anaphoric properties, serving to maintain the pragmatically active status of a given participant across phrases or clauses. It does not itself express any nominal features like gender or number that are known to impart a referential sense in Yine (cf. Chapter 7 for discussion); nor does it alternate with pronominal afﬁxes on the predicate. These facts indicate that wa is not a pronoun.
Just before the example in (59) the narrator has described how her husband killed a game bird and she cooked it. Then, with the people who live there, she eats it (where ‘it’ is expressed via wa). Here, wa represents the extended argument of the predicate (see §10.1.3 regarding extended arguments).

(59) wa n1mnikna wane hac¸ene

[ wa ]NP:E n-him-nika-na

wane hac¸e-ne

[ REF ] 1SG-ASSOC-eat-3PL there/thus dweller-PL

‘I ate this/it with the ones who live there.’ (Hws.017)

The consecutive clauses in (60) represent a very common use of wa, where it functions like a relativizer. Here, there are two nonverbal identity clauses, both of which refer to the same entity. The reference to this entity is continued into the second clause via wa, which is co-referential with the subject-indexing pronominal sufﬁx on the second predicate. The most natural translation is the one given in the example; one closer to the Yine structure would be ‘It was me; the one you were talking to is me’.1 The morphological structure of nonverbal predicates is described in Chapter 9, and the relationships they express in §11.5.

(60) hitakatkani wa pÙinanrono

[ hita-ka-tka-ni ]

[ wa p-Ùina-n1-lo-no ]

[ 1SG-ASSRT-PFV-IMP.DECL ] [ REF 2SG-say-ANTIC-SGF-1SG ]

‘It was me (who) you were talking to.’ (Wap11)

1This translation misleadingly implies that the pronoun is the predicate head in the second clause, which it is not. A more literal translation of that clause would be ‘the I am the one you talked to’, which makes no sense in English.

44

For the role of wa in focussing negative scope onto a nominal argument in the clause, see §12.1.2.

3.2 Pronouns
Yine has a small set of independent personal pronouns, presented in Table 3.1. They distinguish three persons, two numbers, and in 3rd singular, two grammatical genders. Gender is neutralized in 3rd plural. There is no inclusive/exclusive distinction, no case or role marking, and no special reﬂexive or reciprocal forms. Possessive pronouns are derived; see §3.2.3 below.

hita wica

2nd

pica pica

3rd masc wale wanna 3rd fem wala

Table 3.1: Personal pronouns

In addition to the independent pronouns, which are relatively rare in my corpus, Yine has a system of bound pronominal morphology, both preﬁxal and sufﬁxal, which it employs to index possessors of nouns and core arguments of predicates. The pronominal afﬁxes are described in §3.2.1. The bound and free pronominals are in semicomplementary distribution; this is treated in detail in §3.2.2.

3.2.1 Pronominal afﬁxes
The form and function of the pronominal afﬁxes is discussed in Chapter 5 (possessors) and Chapter 9 (arguments). The purpose of this section is to provide a uniﬁed summary of their distribution.
45

3.2.1.1 Pronominal preﬁxes
Pronominal preﬁxes index the subject of a verbal predicate and the possessor of a noun. There are three preﬁx classes, provided in Table 3.2. Class 1 and 2 appear on both verbs and nouns, while the Class 3 preﬁxes are only used to index the possessor of inalienable nouns; the details of their distribution are treated below. Note that 3PL marking requires the combination of two afﬁxes, with the sufﬁx -na in a discontinuous dependency relationship with the 3rd person masculine preﬁx. The sufﬁx is the same in all the preﬁx classes, and is also used – without the preﬁx – for 3PL objects of transitive verbs.

hi- . . . -na

Class 1 Class 1 preﬁxes are used with stems that begin with the consonant h, which the preﬁx consonant replaces. The stem may be a verb, in which case the preﬁx indexes the subject, or an alienable or kinship noun, in which case it indexes the possessor. If the stem-initial h is followed by the vowel i, the i mutates to 1. This is an obligatory process, but one that is restricted to the morphological boundary between a preﬁx and a hi-initial stem. Vowels other than i are not affected.
Note that the 2PL preﬁx is exceptional in that it does not trigger vowel mutation. As discussed in §2.3.5, it is hypothesized that this reﬂects a phonological constraint no longer active in the current language.
The distribution of the Class 1 preﬁxes is summarized as follows. An example of the 1SG and 3SG forms is provided for each attested environment; these together are
46

sufﬁcient to identify the preﬁx class for any given stem. Any word class that is not mentioned in a particular environment has been purposely omitted: it is not attested in that environment.
• verbs and kinship terms; stem begins with hi, i > 1
eg. verb: himata ‘know’: n1mata, r1mata eg. kin term: hir1 ‘father of’: n1r1, r1r1
• verbs, kinship terms, non-kin inalienables, and alienable nouns; stem begins with h followed by vowel other than i
eg. verb: heta ‘see’: neta, reta eg. kin term: hac¸iro ‘grandmother of’: nac¸iro, rac¸iro eg. other inal: -hayic¸i ‘spine of’: nayic¸i, rayic¸i eg. alienable: hepÙi ‘axe’: nepÙite, repÙite
Class 2 The Class 2 preﬁx paradigm is used with stems that begin with a consonant other than h. With these, the pronominal preﬁx does not replace the initial consonant of the stem. This paradigm differs from Class 1 only in the 3rd person masculine/plural preﬁx, which is r- in Class 1 and Ø- in Class 2. The Class 2 preﬁxes are not attested on non-kin inalienables, which instead take the Class 3 forms if they do no begin with h.
• verbs, alienable nouns, and kinship terms; stem does not begin with h
eg. verb: satoka ‘return’: nsatoka, satoka eg. alienable: kanawa ‘cedar, canoe’: nkanawate, kanawate eg. kin term: -palikler1 ‘nephew of’: npalikler1, palikler1
47

Class 3 The Class 3 preﬁxes are used only with inalienable nouns, and only with those whose stem does not begin with h. Most of the nouns that take Class 3 are non-kin inalienables, but there are also a few kinship terms that do.
• inalienable nouns; stem does not begin with h
eg. non-kin inal: -yhale ‘eye of’: noyhale, hiyhale eg. kin term: -mole ‘kinsman of’: nomole, himole

3.2.1.2 Pronominal sufﬁxes

The distribution of the pronominal sufﬁxes depends entirely on the word class heading the predicate to which they are sufﬁxed. This distribution is summarized in Table 3.3. Regarding the allomorphs in the 3SGM and 3SGF forms, see §2.3.4. For examples illustrating the pronominal sufﬁxes, see Chapter 9.

SG PL Predicate head

-ni -la/-ra

V, N, Adj, Adv V, N, Adj, Adv
V, Adj, Adv
N, Pron, Adv

Table 3.3: Pronominal sufﬁxes: summary

In Chapter 9, I divide the pronominal sufﬁxes into two paradigms: the O paradigm, which indexes the object of a transitive verb; and the NVS paradigm, which indexes the subject of a nonverbal predicate. The impersonal sufﬁxes are only available with the latter. As I note in §9.1.2, this division is done for expository purposes, and is reﬂected in the glosses.
Note that the 3SGM and 3SGF sufﬁxes are identical in form to the gender agreement sufﬁxes and with the product/object nominalizing sufﬁxes. However, only the pronominal sufﬁxes express plurality with -na; the others mark it with the nominal plural sufﬁx
48

-ne. Because of this distinction, the gender/number agreement sufﬁxes and the nominalizers are analysed as identical (and glossed as SGM), with the pronominal sufﬁxes being distinct (and glossed as 3SGM).
3.2.2 Distribution of bound pronominals
Pronominal afﬁxes are in semi-complementary distribution with independent co-referential NPs, including those expressed via a personal pronoun. The degree to which they tend to cooccur depends on the word class of the head.
On nouns On nouns, independent possessors are in full complementary distribution with the pronominal preﬁxes. This is the case for both alienable (61) and inalienable (62) nouns.
(61) sawli ‘machete’ a. hita sawlite hita sawli-te 1SG machete-PSSD ‘my machete’ b. nsawlite n-sawli-te 1SG-machete-PSSD ‘my machete’
(62) -tpali ‘thigh of’ a. hita tpali hita tpali 1SG thigh.of ‘my thigh’ b. notpali no-tpali 1SG-thigh.of ‘my thigh’
49

On nonverbal predicates Pronominal indexing is always marked on nonverbal predicates, regardless of the relative order of the predicate and independent argument; (63)(65) illustrate their obligatory speciﬁcation.

(63) hewni nopc¸i

hewi-ni

‘That woman was one who was hungry for a long time.’ (Nwd117)

On verbal predicates The distribution is a bit more complicated with the pronominal afﬁxes on a verbal predicate. With these, the only time pronominal indexing is optional is when there is an independent coreferential NP preceding the predicate in the clause. In this situation, the pronominal afﬁxes are not marked on the predicate unless an emphatic sense is intended.
(66) a. hita histakyi hita histaka-yi 1SG cut-2SG ‘I cut you.’

b. pica n1stakyi pica n-histaka-yi 2SG 1SG-cut-2SG ‘I cut you.’
If, however, the NP follows the predicate (or if there is no independent argument at
all) pronominal indexing is obligatory.

3.2.3 Possessive pronouns

Possessive pronouns in Yine are derived from personal pronouns using the property nominalizing sufﬁx -n1. They are presented in Table 3.4.

Examples of the possessive pronouns are extremely limited in my corpus, so I can offer little discussion here. Studies of their distribution – for example, must they always occur as predicate heads? – and the types of possessive relationships encoded with these pronouns are topics for future research. The examples in (70) and (71) were encountered in elicitation, and though semantically odd are well-formed; (72) provides an example from a narrative. The possessive pronouns seem to express an abstract close relationship between two entities, rather than one of ownership.

3.3 Demonstratives
Nominal demonstratives in Yine distinguish three degrees of spatial proximity to the speaker (the position of the addressee is not relevant); each has masculine singular, feminine singular, and plural forms.
Some observations can be made about the forms of the demonstratives. The initial consonant t- can be identiﬁed as a formative in all singular forms; -c¸ra is present in all of the distal forms as well as the remote plural; -ka distinguishes the remote from
52

the proximal in the non-plural forms. The gender theme vowels 1 ‘masculine’ and o ‘feminine’ can also be identiﬁed. The proximal series is irregular. There is no obvious gender vowel; the ﬁrst consonant can be identiﬁed as a number formative, but the remainder is not formally like any of the other series. This irregularity can plausibly be attributed to the obscuring effects of phonological change: in Apurina˜, one of Yine’s closest relatives, the cognate forms are more transparent: 1-ye ‘prox. masc.’, o-ye ‘prox.fem.’ (Facundes 2000:356). However, this analysis is only hypothetical until more comparative work has been done.
All of these demonstratives are regularly used as determiners or as pronouns. The examples in (73)-(75) illustrate that they may occur with a noun (and a numeral).

‘I found her (in that place) far away.’ (Nwd.076)

The demonstratives are primarily deictic. The proximal series is used anaphorically in my texts only when accompanied by the referential article wa, as in (79)-(81). In each of these examples, the demonstrative is being used to refer back to an established referent rather than to point one out.
In (79), the subject NP refers back to the mythical character who has been the topic of the narrative.

The anaphoric function is not attested with the distal and remote series. Instead, the 3rd person pronouns are used, in which case these too may be accompanied by wa (82)-(83) (but need not be, as pronouns can always be anaphoric).

3.4 Adverbs
Yine has a closed class of adverbs providing locational, temporal, manner, and epistemic modiﬁcation in the clause. The purpose of this section is to present and illustrate the adverbs that I have encountered in my research, organized according to their semantic type. The lists provided in the subsections below are as complete as I am currently able to make them; undoubtedly they can be expanded on further research, but based on my corpus the set of adverb roots in Yine is very small. Prominent among them is the polysemous adverb wane, which conﬂates location and manner, and is also used for existential predicates.
Adverbs can be identiﬁed as a word class based on their ability to modify a predicate, their lack of inﬂectional morphology, and their distribution in the clause. There is no morphology that derives adverbs in Yine, and none that is unique to this class of words. This is not to say that adverbs are always morphologically simple. As modiﬁers, they may host ﬂoating clause-level sufﬁxes (see §9.5), and almost all are attested with the emphatic sufﬁx -ko (see §9.2.4). As predicate heads, adverbial roots may take any of the morphology available to nonverbal predicates (see Chapter 9), and adverbs are the only class of words that utilize the full range of non-verbal subject (NVS) markers; this is described in §9.1.2.2.
In the clause, adverbs may either precede the predicate and its arguments, or follow them (see §11.1), modifying the predicate in either position. A few adverbs are attested as noun modiﬁers within the NP, in which case they may be distinguished from adjectives in that they do not take agreement morphology.
56

3.4.1 Locational adverbs
The locational adverbs are listed in (84).
(84) hewi ‘here (deictic)’ hawla ‘(over) there (deictic)’ teno ‘high, deep’ how1ka ‘far’ mala ‘downriver’ hawaka ‘upriver’ wane2‘there, in that place ’
Hewi and hawla are deictic adverbs that express, respectively, proximity to and distance from the speaker. Although they are semantically opposing pairs, their frequency, distribution, and morphological possibilities are quite different. Hewi is attested modifying both predicates and nouns and as the head of a nonverbal predicate, as well as taking the emphatic sufﬁx -ko; but hawla is only used as a predicate modiﬁer and takes no morphology in my corpus.
The examples below illustrate how hewi may be used to modify either predicates (85)-(86) or nouns (87)-(89).
(85) hewi napokatka hewi n-hapoka-tka here 1SG-arrive-PFV ‘I arrived here.’ (Via38)
(86) hewi pmoletan1 hewi p-moleta-n1 here 2SG-gather-ANTIC ‘Gather (them) here.’ (WatE116)
When hewi appears as a modiﬁer in an NP, the NP in question typically also has the referential article wa, as in (87) and (88); or it may have a demonstrative, as in (89).
2polysemous; see also §3.4.3 and §3.4.4 for its manner and existential senses, respectively.
57

Examples where hewi modiﬁes a noun in an NP with no determiner element are not attested. Note, however, that there is no agreement morphology on the adverb.

In all of my textual examples, the distal adverb hawla ‘(over) there’ is morphologically simple and modiﬁes a predicate, as in (93) and (94). I have no examples of hawla modifying a noun, taking any morphology (including -ko), or heading a predicate. It is very likely that a study of conversational data would allow for a more enlightening discussion of hawla, but this must be left for future research. If it is the case that my data is in fact representative of hawla’s distribution, then it is signiﬁcantly different from the proximal adverb in this regard.

The remaining locational adverbs are non-deictic, including wane ‘there’ which refers to a place that has been established in the discourse. Though polysemous, wane has only a locational sense if it modiﬁes a predicate with locational semantics, whether these semantics are inherent, as with the locative verb hwa ‘be in a place’ in (95), or derived with the applicative -ya as in (96).

Teno expresses distance along the vertical plane, modifying a predicate in terms of either height (as in (97) and (98)), or depth (see (99) below).

Both teno and how1ka take obligatory agreement sufﬁxes, like adjectives, when functioning to modify a noun as in (102), and have the semantics of dimension adjectives rather than locational adverbs.

Teno is not attested as a predicate head in my corpus, but how1ka behaves like other adverbs in this function in taking both the personal (103a) and the impersonal (103b) 3rd person subject markers.

The adverbs mala ‘downriver, downstream’ and hawaka ‘upriver, upstream’ are interpreted relative to the ﬂow of the nearest (or most salient) river. They may either describe a static location, as in (104)-(105), or identify the direction in which the modiﬁed situation is occurring, as in (106).

3.4.2 Temporal adverbs
The Temporal adverbs are listed in (109), and see the Addendum at the end of this section for a discussion of their possible etymologies.

This adverb is not attested modifying a noun or as the head of a nonverbal predicate in my corpus.
Like cani, kapethohne has a vague sense. It may refer to the day before the utterance time, as in (114), but may also be used to refer to a time further back in the recent past, as in (115) below. (114) nsatokatka kapethohne
n-satoka-tka kapethohne 1SG-return-PFV yesterday ‘I came back yesterday.’ The use of kapethohne with an event many days in the past is illustrated by the excerpts in (115). These are drawn from a narrative in which a man expresses a wish that a frog he hears singing would become a woman; following this, he continues his work of hunting and storing up provisions. After many, many days, he returns to where he had heard the frog, and it is at this point that she, now a woman, tells him that she was the one he was speaking of kapethohne. The amount of time that has passed is not explicitly noted beyond hico hohne ‘many days’, but the description of repeated activities in the story suggests that it could have been several weeks or longer.

More work is needed to determine whether it may likewise refer to a day further into the future.
References to the day before yesterday and the day after tomorrow are both expressed phrasally using pn1te hohne ‘another day’ along with the temporal adverb, as

The non-deictic adverb root m1Ùi ‘just’ is illustrated in (119). This adverb occurs rarely in my corpus. In all tokens, it is morphologically simple and never heads a predicate.

M1Ùikawa ‘long ago’ is illustrated in (120)-(121), and m1Ùinan1 ‘ﬁrst(ly), before’ in (122)-(123) below. Regarding the possible etymology of these adverbs, see the addendum at the end of the current section.
M1Ùikawa is attested modifying a predicate (120) and modifying a noun (121).

My corpus does not contain examples of m1Ùinan1 or m1Ùikawa taking the emphatic sufﬁx or heading a predicate, but nor have these possibilities been explicitly ruled out.
ADDENDUM. While all of the temporal adverbs presented in this section exist as inseparable phonological and grammatical words in the current language, it is worth commenting on the forms of four of them: kapethohne ‘yesterday’, yeÙikawa ‘tomorrow’, m1Ùikawa ‘long ago’, and m1Ùinan1 ‘ﬁrst’. These show a clear morphological relationship to other temporal words in the language and are suggestive of a derivational origin, while their semantics are idiosyncratic enough to suggest lexicalization.
The noun hohne ‘day’ is readily identiﬁable as a component of kapethohne ‘yesterday, recently’, but kapet- does not appear elsewhere in my corpus and I cannot speculate on its possible semantics. The tentative etymologies of the other three forms are more complicated to explore, as follows (and summarized in (124) below). YeÙikawa ‘tomorrow’ and m1Ùikawa ‘long ago’ both contain the formative kawa, which they share with other temporal words including the noun hoyeÙnokawa ‘morning’. Following Matteson (1965:126) kawa may be glossed as ‘period of time following’. YeÙ- may
67

also be identiﬁed as a component of both hoyeÙnokawa ‘morning’ and another temporal noun, hoyeÙno ‘night’ (cf.(124)). Given Matteson’s gloss of kawa, yeÙ- appears to express a stretch of time during which it is dark; so, yeÙikawa is a time following a stretch of darkness. M1Ùikawa could be translated (very awkwardly) as a time following ‘before’. There is a similar awkwardness in attempting a literal translation of m1Ùinan1 ‘ﬁrstly’, composed of m1Ùi ‘just, before’ and the ‘extensive’ particle nan1 (see §3.8.2 below): i.e. during the time span preceding the modiﬁed event or state of affairs.
The etymologies offered here are summarized in (124), but note that further research is needed to explore their validity.

(124)

kapethohne ‘yesterday, recently’ kapet-? hohne ‘day’
yeÙikawa ‘tomorrow; period of time following darkness’ yeÙ(i)- ‘time of darkness’ -kawa ‘period of time following’
m1Ùikawa ‘long ago; ?period of time following (what was) before’ m1Ùi ‘just, before’ -kawa ‘period of time following’
m1Ùinan1 ‘ﬁrst(ly); distributed over previous time’ m1Ùi ‘just, before’ nan1 ‘EXTNS’

3.4.3 Manner adverbs
The manner adverbs are listed in (125).

(125)

wane3‘thus’ yihle ‘slowly’ teyaka ‘lightly, swiftly’ hiyampot1 ‘quickly, immediately’

As noted above, wane is used for manner as well as locational modiﬁcation. As a manner adverb, it has a very general sense, ‘thus, in this way’ (126).

1SG kill-3SGM REF 1SG-eat-ANTIC-SGM quickly

‘I kill my food quickly.’ (Oso17)

69

The form of hiyampot1 suggests that it is morphologically complex, a lexicalized combination of hiyaho ‘then, next, so’ and the adverbial particle pot1 ‘intensive’; the vowel elision and place assimilation of h to p follow the regular phonological rules of the language. There is no evidence that it is synchronically analysable, however: though both hiyaho and -pot1 exist in the current language, hiyampot1 itself is a single inseparable grammatical and phonological word.

3.4.4 Existential adverbs
There are two adverbs that are used to head existential predicates: wane4 ‘there is, there exists’; and its negative counterpart maleSa ‘there is not, there does not exist’. These are illustrated in (132)-(135) below. For further discussion, see also §11.5.3 on existence clauses.

3.4.5 Epistemic adverbs
Yine has three epistemic adverbs:

(136)

halikaka ‘certainly, indeed’ (strong commitment to truth of utterance) hal1kta ‘maybe’ (general commitment, open to re-evaluation) hiph1ta ‘apparently’ (some uncertainty, low commitment).

In the description below, I attempt to characterize the core meaning of each of these; however, my understanding of their range of uses is too limited to offer much in the way of discussion.
Halikaka ‘indeed’ expresses the highest degree of certainty. It is used when the speaker has either ﬁrst-hand knowledge of, or a high degree of conﬁdence in, the information presented in the sentence, as in (137)-(138); or with anticipated events over which the speaker has direct control, as in (139) and (140) below. It also serves to intensify an entire sentence.

(137) cani halikaka n1kSikatkal1 hico knoya cani halikaka n-hikSika-tka-l1 hico knoya now indeed 1SG-ﬁnd-PFV-3SGM much tortoise
‘Now I have really found a lot of tortoises.’ (Kno50)

wane-kl1

halikaka hima hi t-naÙiÙa-tka

there/thus-time.of indeed QUOT NEG 3SGF-be.hungry-PFV

‘At that time she indeed was not hungry (any more).’ (Nwd120)

The speaker in (139) is the chief of the village, and has the authority to order a time of communal work.
71

(139) cani halikaka wkamr1rewatan1tka cani halikaka w-kamr1rewata-n1-tka now indeed 1PL-work-ANTIC-PFV ‘Now indeed we will work.’ (BfM46)
In examples like (140), the use of halikaka has the illocutionary force of an oath.

(140) cani halikaka hi pa hohneko nsatokan1tka

cani halikaka hi pa

hohne-ko n-satoka-n1-tka

now indeed NEG NONSPEC day-EMPH 1SG-return-ANTIC-PFV

‘Now indeed I will never return again.’ (hetn87)

Hal1kta ‘maybe’ expresses a somewhat lower degree of commitment to the truth or accuracy of the utterance, in effect making an assertion while allowing for the possibility of being mistaken. It is used when the speaker is passing along general knowledge which he or she has not personally veriﬁed.

(141) pamyo knoya hal1kta pn1te pamyo knoya hal1kta pn1-te ﬁve tortoise maybe OTHER-PSSD
‘ﬁve tortoises, maybe more’ (Kno56)

hal1kta pn1-mn1 Ø-ya-tka-na maybe OTHER-SER 3-go-PFV-3PL

‘Then after they hatch, they go in all directions, as far as I know.’ (Kno70)

Hiph1ta ‘apparently’ expresses a low degree of commitment to or responsibility for the accuracy of the utterance. I have few textual examples of this adverb, and in all of them it heads a nonverbal predicate; (143) and (144) are typical examples. Further research is needed to address its function as a modiﬁer.

3.5 Numerals and quantiﬁers

3.5.1 Numerals

The current Yine numeral system is presented in Table 3.6. Only two numerals are morphologically simple, hepi ‘two’ and mapa ‘three’. Sat1pc¸e ‘one’ is the only numeral that distinguishes gender; it also has a clear morphological relationship to the indeﬁnite speciﬁc article sat1, along with the restrictive sufﬁx -pc¸e. The numerals paÙa ‘hundred’ and warahka ‘thousand’ are Quechua borrowings.

Ordinal numerals are phrasal, composed of the cardinal numeral or a quantiﬁed noun plus Ùininri (an action nominalization of the verb Ùina ‘say’): i.e. hepi Ùininri ‘second’, mapa Ùininri ‘third’, hepkocamkoc¸e Ùininri ‘fourth’, etc. This is the construction used to refer to the time of day (145), (146) or a certain amount of elapsed time, as in (147). Note the code-mixing in (146), where the numeral and quantiﬁed noun are Spanish, but are adapted to the Yine ordinal number construction. The use of Spanish numerals, unadapted to Yine phonology, is very common in my corpus even in the traditional narratives, where many of my consultants made a conscious effort to avoid code-mixing and would usually self-correct if they did.

3.5.2 Quantiﬁers
Yine has three quantiﬁers: hico ‘much, many’, psol1 ‘all/the entirety of’, and pec¸n1 ‘every, each’.
74

3.5.2.1 hico ‘a lot of’
Hico corresponds to either ‘much’ or ‘many’ in English depending on whether or not the noun it quantiﬁes is individuated (i.e. marked for number). It is not attested with mass nouns; for these, a sizeable quantity is expressed via modiﬁcation with the adjective tsr1 ‘big’ (e.g. tsr1 koya ‘a lot of manioc beer’).
Where the quantiﬁed noun has a human referent, hico is treated as a modiﬁer and as a rule must take the gender/number agreement sufﬁxes, as in (148)-(149).5 The example in (150) represents an exception to the rule. Here, the quantiﬁed noun is yine ‘(the Yine) people’ (as it is in (149)), but no agreement appears on the quantiﬁer. This is the only such example in my corpus, so a well-motivated explanation for it cannot be offered, but the fact that the quantiﬁed noun here refers to corpses, not living humans, seems likely to be a very relevant point.

‘There a lot of Yine died.’ (Fst30)

With non-human referents, no agreement morphology is used. Examples are pro-
vided in (151)-(153). Plural marking on the quantiﬁed noun is possible, but tends to be
5The feminine gender agreement sufﬁx is not attested, presumably because groups are treated morphologically as masculine for the purpose of agreement, and nouns quantiﬁed with hico are always plural.

3.5.2.2 psol1 ‘all of’; pec¸n1 ‘every’
The distinction between individuated nouns, those whose status as individuals is viewed as relevant in the context, versus non-individuated, whose status as individuals is not relevant, is more useful in characterizing the difference between the universal quantiﬁers than is the count-mass distinction. It is also more consistent with the Yine number system, which divides between nouns that usually take plural marking – i.e. highly animate count nouns – and those that cannot or usually do not – i.e. mass nouns and low-animacy count nouns.
There are two universal quantiﬁers. Both agree in gender with the noun they quantify, but only one, pec¸n1, can also agree in number.
Psol1 quantiﬁes over the entirety of a non-individuated group. It can be used with both noncount (154) and count (155) nouns, as long as the latter are taken as a uniﬁed
76

whole. It is not attested with animate or plural nouns. Internal morphology can be identiﬁed: the inalienable noun -pso ‘size of’ plus the nominalizing gender sufﬁx -l1, but it is analysed as monomorphemic here because of its distinct function in the grammar. The emphatic sufﬁx -ko is very frequently marked on psol1, but it is not obligatory and does not alter the quantiﬁer’s meaning.

Pec¸n1 quantiﬁes over a set of individuals, i.e. ‘every, each’, and thus is limited to use with individuated nouns. It agrees in number and gender with the head noun. If the quantiﬁed noun is plural, pec¸n1 quantiﬁes over individuals or types, as in (156). If it is singular, which it rarely is in my data, it quantiﬁes over a group of referents, each of which is characterized by the head noun, as in (157). Speakers varied whether they found it acceptable to use pec¸n1 with mass nouns; most did not.

3.6 Interrogatives
The interrogative words and phrases of Yine are presented and exempliﬁed in §12.3.
3.7 Clause linkers
The elements used to combine clauses, and the relationships thus expressed, are discussed and illustrated in Chapter 13.
3.8 Particles
There is a small set of words that do not ﬁt neatly into any word class and cannot be straightforwardly categorized as clitics or afﬁxes. They take no inﬂectional morphology of their own. Though it is not clear that they constitute a coherent word class, and their proper placement in the Yine grammatical system remains a task for future research, they are addressed together here because of general properties that they share. These properties are as follows.
78

The ‘adverbial particles’ have a somewhat limited distribution in the clause, occurring either independently in the left periphery, or as incorporants within the predicate. When incorporated, they are fully integrated into their host and form a single phonological word with them. With one exception (koca ‘also’) they all take the same position as an incorporated noun in a verbal predicate (i.e. stem-internal, see §8.2.2); on nonverbal predicates they appear between the stem and the mood/aspect morphology. When placed as independent words, they follow the element they modify. This frequently places them after the ﬁrst grammatical word in the clause and is reminiscent of a second-position clitic, but for none of them can their distribution be characterized as strictly second-position. Though they may stand as independent phonological words, and can be assigned their own primary stress, they are often phonologically bound, and boundary vowel deletion may occur between them and the preceding word. Because this deletion is optional, it can be identiﬁed as applying between grammatical words rather than between a stem and suﬁx. As phrase-ﬁnal elements, these particles often host phrasal sufﬁxes which operate on the discourse level (see §9.5 regarding these), and which do form a single grammatical and phonological word with their host.
There is some question of how best to write these particles, particularly in a way that can capture their status as words while still reﬂecting their optionally close phonological association with the element they modify. Here, I have adopted the following convention: the transcription line reﬂects the degree of phonological integration with the preceding word, including vowel deletion where applicable; and in the morpheme line the particle is written without a hyphen unless it is incorporated into the predicate (i.e. into the grammatical word). In the latter respect, the particles follow the same convention used for noun incorporants.
3.8.1 pot1 ‘intensiﬁer’
The particle pot1 expresses an intensiﬁcation of the meaning of the element it modiﬁes. In my corpus pot1 is attested modifying nouns (158), noun phrases (159), adjectives
79

(160), and temporal (161), locational (163), and manner (162) adverbs.

Pot1 also appears within both verbal (164)-(165) and nonverbal (166)-(167) predicates, where it takes scope over the event expressed in the clause. In verbal predicates,
80

as (164) and (165) illustrate, pot1 occurs inside the verb stem and is treated as an incorporant. In nonverbal predicates, pot1 is also integrated into the phonological and morphological structure of the predicate.

3.8.2 nan1 ‘extensive’
The particle nan1 indicates that the modiﬁed element is extended over space and/or time. It occurs within verbal and nonverbal predicates, and as a modiﬁer it is attested following adjectives, adverbs or quantiﬁers.
On verbal predicates, it can be translated as “to Verb intermittently or at times, or to go along Verbing.”

anteater trumpet-EXTNS-NONDUR-VCL 3SGMPSSR-mouth.of-OBL

‘The anteater trumpeted from time to time with its mouth.’ (Oso10)

The interpretation of -nan1 as a distribution over space seems to be the most natural, even with verbal predicates. For example, my consultants explained the sentence in (171) in terms of stopping to eat at one house after the other on the way home. This interpretation was explicitly preferred over one that involved, for example, spending a whole morning at someone’s house eating a bit now and then.

(171) nnikanan1mta n-nika-nan1-m-ta 1SG-eat-EXTNS-NONDUR-VCL ‘I went along eating here and there.’ (i2)
However, as the example in (172) illustrates, nan1 can express a purely temporal extension. Here, there is no movement from place to place involved: the action is carried out from time to time.

‘We add corn bit by bit again.’ (Mas24)

82

On nonverbal predicates, nan1 typically expresses a state or condition that held for some contextually-deﬁned time.

‘(During that time) there were no pots.’ (Fst1)

Outside the predicate, nan1 is attested modifying adjectives (175), adverbs (176), and quantiﬁers. In each case it contributes the same sense of extension over space or time as appropriate to the semantics of the element it modiﬁes.
In (175), nan1 expresses that tsr1 ‘big’ should include in its interpretation a sense of spatial extension, i.e. length.

In (176), similarly, nan1 contributes the sense that the participant’s hair reaches to a certain point; without nan1, this sentence would mean something closer to ‘her hair was right here’ – for example, it grew out of that spot in her back, rather than covering a space up to that point.

3.8.3 yaka ‘more’
The Diccionario Piro deﬁnes yaka as expressing a ‘condition or state’.6 In my research, I have found it to function as an augmentative adverbial particle comparable to English ‘(a bit) more’, so I will describe it as such here. To avoid confusion with the more common interpretation of the term ‘augmentative’ as a marker for increased size, I gloss this particle as MORE.
Yaka is not a common particle in my corpus; the examples below present all of its occurrences. If these examples are truly representative of its distribution, then it modiﬁes adverbs (178), demonstratives (179), (180) and verbs (182).

On predicates, yaka is integrated into the phonological and grammatical word of its host. (181) exempliﬁes it in an adjectival predicate, and in (182), its treatment as an incorporant in a verbal predicate is illustrated.

3.8.4 koca ‘additive’
The particle koca ‘also’ is an additive marker, signaling the inclusion of another participant in the current discourse context, or attributing another quality or action to an established participant. It has scope over the event, regardless of where it appears. Outside the predicate, it occurs as an independent phonological word; inside the predicate, it is phonologically bound. Unlike the other adverbial particles, koca appears at the end of the verb stem in a verbal predicate, rather than being treated as an incorporant within the stem (185).

3.8.5 Evidential particles
Yine has two evidential particles: hima ‘quotative’ and hetko ‘inferential’. They are obligatory in the appropriate context, and must appear at least once in the clause. There is a clear preference for them to appear following the ﬁrst grammatical word in the clause, as many of the examples throughout this grammar will attest; but they may follow any pre-predicate constituent. Examples where the quotative particle appears more than once in a single clause are abundant, but such repetition of the inferential particle is not attested in my corpus. Presumably, this can be attributed to a gap in my data, which consists largely of either traditional or personal narratives and is thus less conducive to inferential contexts than quotative ones.
The examples below illustrate the distribution of the evidential particle hima: in the left periphery of the clause (186)-(188), and incorporated into various predicate types (189)-(191).

Examples (195)-(198) provide a typical sampling of the inferential evidential hetko to show that it has the same potential positions as hima; but as noted earlier, examples of hetko are not numerous in my corpus and its repetition in a clause is not attested.

4 Adjectives
Adjectives in Yine comprise one of the three open word classes. While the number of simple, underived adjectival roots is relatively small compared to that of nouns and verbs, there are two preﬁxes that derive adjectives from other parts of speech. Because of the productivity of these preﬁxes, the adjective class can be considered open by derivation. The properties that distinguish adjectives from other parts of speech are presented in §4.1 below, followed by a summary of the semantics of adjective roots from a typological perspective in §4.2. Finally, in §4.3, the morphological structure of the Yine adjective is presented and exempliﬁed.
4.1 Adjectives as a word class
Although adjectives share many properties with nouns and some with verbs, they exhibit a unique set of properties of their own and constitute a distinct word class. The purpose of this section is to present a comparison between adjectives and the other two open classes, nouns and verbs.
4.1.1 Adjective versus noun
The line between the adjective and noun word classes is often very difﬁcult to discern, particularly in examples like (199) where an adjective appears as the sole representative of the object NP (see §6.4 regarding nounless NPs).
(199) pos1r1 neta [ pos1-l1 ]NP:O n-heta [ rotten-SGM ] 1SG-see ‘I see (something) rotten.’ (b102) 91

It is important to note that in order to have this noun-like behavior, an adjective root must be inﬂected for gender agreement, which has nominalizing properties in Yine (see Chapter 7). Thus, the example in (199) would be ungrammatical if the adjective form was only the root pos1 rather than pos1r1 with the gender agreement sufﬁx -l1.1 Nouns do not have the same restriction: bare (alienable) noun roots can and frequently do function freely in the syntax (200). A comparison of (199) with (200) highlights the clearest difference between adjectives and nouns in Yine: gender is an agreement category on adjectives, but an inherent category in nouns.

(200) kewe neta

[ kewe ]NP:O n-heta

[ dog ]

1SG-see

‘I see a dog.’ (b102)

Another situation where nouns and adjectives are very similar to each other is when they head a nonverbal predicate: nouns and adjectives take sufﬁxal subject marking, and verbs take preﬁxal markers. Where adjectives and nouns differ, however, is how they index 3rd person subjects: adjectives take the personal sufﬁxes, and nouns take the impersonal sufﬁxes (see §3.2.1.2).
It is worth pointing out that there are many instances where an adjective appears to be taking the impersonal subject markers; for example in (201). Again, however, gender marking is present on the adjective. Since this marking also functions as a nominalizer, this can be identiﬁed as a predicate headed by a de-adjectival noun.

(201) pos1rni wale

pos1-l1-ni

wale

rotten-SGM-IMP.DECL 3SGM

‘That’s a rotten thing.’

1Because gender agreement is also nominalizing, examples like (199) are structurally ambiguous. They could be analysed as nominalized adjectives, i.e. [ [ pos1-l1 ]N ]NP ; or as adjectives bearing agreement with an elided head noun, i.e. [ pos1-l1 ØN ]NP . The former is preferable because there is no independent need to postulate a null head noun; but regardless of the analysis, the requirement for gender marking is an essential difference between the class of adjectives and that of nouns in this language.

92

Finally, adjectives differ from nouns in that they cannot be possessed, and they are not incorporated into verbs.
We should note here that there are a few adjectives that are in fact indistinguishable from nouns; or rather, there are a few words with adjectival semantics that can function unchanged as either a noun or an adjective. All of these words contain a thematic gender vowel (cf. §5.1.1) that is identical to the vowel in the agreement sufﬁx: i.e. 1 for masculine, and o for feminine. Very common examples include tsr1, tsro ‘big (one) (m, f)’ and mt1r1, mt1ro ‘small (one) (m, f)’. These can be viewed as lexicalized nominalizations.
4.1.2 Adjective versus verb
Adjectives are more clearly distinct from verbs than from nouns. Most notably we ﬁnd that, although adjectives are verb-like in that they can head a(n intransitive) predicate, there is a clear difference in how the subject is marked. Like all non-verbal predicates, those headed by adjectives index the subject with a pronominal sufﬁx. All verbal predicates, on the other hand, index the subject with a pronominal preﬁx and the sufﬁx indexes the object.
4.1.3 Adjective versus both noun and verb
Adjectives also have some properties that make them distinct from both nouns and verbs. There are two productive derivational preﬁxes that create adjectives from nouns and verbs: k(a)- ‘attributive’ and m(a)- ‘privative’; on adjective roots these preﬁxes are not class-changing. Additionally, there are two formative preﬁxes that are exclusive to adjective roots: po-‘thoroughly’ and ho- ‘long’. Regarding k(a)- and m(a)-, see §4.3.1 below; regarding po- and ho-, see §4.3.2. Finally, there is a periphrastic emphatic construction that is not used with nouns or verbs, but only with adjective roots; this construction is described in §4.3.4 below.
93

Table 4.1 provides a summary of the properties that distinguish the adjective word class from those of nouns and verbs.

4.2 Adjectives by semantic type
The class of adjectives is too large to list in its entirety here, even if the list were to be limited to those adjectives that are most clearly underived lexemes. The purpose of this section is to illustrate the different semantic notions that are expressed by adjectives in Yine and provide common examples of each type. The discussion is organized according to semantic type, following Dixon (2006)’s typology of adjective notions.
Of the thirteen types of adjectival concepts delineated there, six are represented by (underived) adjectives in Yine: Dimension, Age, Value, Colour, Physical Property and Human Propensity. Not represented by adjectives are Speed, Difﬁculty, Similarity, Qualiﬁcation, Qantiﬁcation, Position and Cardinal Numerals; the word classes expressing these concepts are noted at the end of this section.
When citing the adjective roots here, I do so without the agreement sufﬁx; a hyphen is used to indicate that agreement is necessary for the adjective to modify a noun.
94

(202)

DIMENSION, AGE
tsr1/tsro ‘big, thick, wide; old, important; strong (m/f)’ mt1r1/mt1ro ‘small, young (m/f)’ mtser1- ‘thin, small, short, narrow’ tseyo- ‘small, slight’ hero- ‘new, fresh, recent; raw’

Many dimension concepts are expressed by inalienable nouns, especially of the classiﬁcatory subtype: e.g. -mta ‘ﬂat thing of’; -c¸e ‘stick-shaped thing of’ (see §5.1.2). Additionally, there are adverbial roots that, when inﬂected for gender agreement, function as adjectives with dimension semantics: how1ka ‘far’ (adv), how1ka- ‘distant, long’ (adj); teno ‘high (up)’ (adv), teno- ‘tall, high, deep’ (adj).

(203)

VALUE
kihle- ‘good, beautiful, right, proper’ m1hle- ‘bad, wrong, ugly’ hekt1- ‘ugly, evil’ pomre- ‘beautiful, well preserved’

An additional Value term is the adverb halikaka ‘truly’, with the corresponding agreement-taking adjective halikak- ‘true’.

(204)

COLOUR
ksac¸i- ‘black’ klata- ‘white’ sero- ‘red’ pole- ‘blue, green’ popni- ‘grey’ pwalo- light yellow, any light color; pale’ ksoli- ‘ash grey’ pholoka- ‘beige’

Many color terms in Yine are nouns whose referent has the colour in question, and it is likely that several of the terms in (204) have the same source; e.g. pole- ‘green’ vs. polero ‘parrot’; sero- ‘red’ vs. serolo ‘ripe plantain’. However, the true noun color terms can be distinguished from (lexicalized) adjectives in that the noun is frequently followed by pickal1t1 ‘one that is like’, a nominalization of the similative particle picka:
95

e.g. narahka pickal1t1 ‘orange’ (narahka from Spanish naranja); also tsotsota pickal1t1 ‘light green’ (tsotsota ‘green plantain’).

(205)

PHYSICAL PROPERTY
poÙwa- ‘sweet’ kata- ‘brilliant’ c¸hi- ‘greasy’ popÙi- ‘soft, weak’ poniko- ‘rich, ﬂavorful’ pokÙe- ‘silent’ c¸inan1- ‘full’ ph1c¸e- ‘clear, visible’ male- ‘empty’

(206)

HUMAN PROPENSITY
wamon1- ‘sad’ pomc¸i- ‘happy’ c¸mere- ‘eager, obedient’ sepro- ‘insane’

Most human propensity concepts are expressed by verbs; there are very few adjectives in this category beyond those listed in (206).

SPEED. Speed concepts are expressed by means of roots shared between adjectives and adverbs, where the uninﬂected root functions like an adverb but the same root, with an agreement sufﬁx, functions as an adjective: e.g. teyaka ‘lightly, rapidly’, teyaka‘light, quick’; yihle ‘slowly’, yihle- ‘slow’. DIFFICULTY. Difﬁculty concepts to tend be expressed by verbs in Yine, or by adjectives derived from verbs; eg. mhimat1- ‘easy’ (privative derivation of himata ‘to know’). SIMILARITY. Similarity concepts are not expressed by simple adjectives. For likeness, the similative adverbial particle picka ‘-like’ is employed following a noun: sotl1 picka [rock SIM] ‘rock-like’. Syntactically, these constructions are predicate adjectives, with the relationship between them and the subject of the clause mediated by the
96

auxiliary verb hica ‘be/do’: hahm1na picka r-hica wale [rock SIM 3-be/do 3SGM] ‘he was like a rock.’ QUALIFICATION, QUANTIFICATION. Both qualiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation concepts are expressed by word classes other than adjectives. Qualiﬁcation is usually done through adverbs, e.g. halikaka ‘indeed’. As noted in the presentation of Value adectives above, halikaka is one of the adverbs that can also be used adjectivally and take agreement.
Quantiﬁcation is carried out by quantiﬁers and numerals, e.g. pec¸n1 ‘every’, hico ‘a lot, much’ psol1 ‘all/the entirety of’. For a description of these see §3.5. POSITION. Most position concepts are expressed by inalienable nouns (e.g. hitoko ‘inside of’), and adverbs (e.g. hewi ‘here’, mala ‘downriver’), a few of which can function as adjectives if inﬂected for agreement (e.g. teno ‘high (up)’ as we saw earlier).

4.3 Morphological Structure of the Adjective

The morphological structure of adjectives is summarized in (207).

(207)

Attribution preﬁx Stem-formative preﬁx Root Agreement (§4.3.3) i. Gender ii. Number

(§4.3.1) (§4.3.2)
or Exclamative sufﬁx (§4.3.4)

4.3.1 Attribution preﬁxes
There are two mutually exclusive derivational preﬁxes that create adjectival stems: k(a)- ‘attributive’ (i.e. having the attribute expressed by the stem) and m(a)- ‘privative’ (i.e. lacking the attribute expressed by the stem). Both are used productively to derive adjectives from verbs and nouns, though they are most commonly used on inalienable
97

nouns. The resulting derivation obligatorily agrees in gender with the noun it modiﬁes, and in addition to the regular agreement sufﬁxes -l1/-lo there is a second set, -t1/-to, that is typically – but not exclusively – used with the privative forms; see §4.3.3 below.
As the examples below will illustrate, the attribution preﬁx attaches directly to an inalienable noun root (without a possessor preﬁx), but alienable nouns must have their ‘possessed’ sufﬁx speciﬁed (see §5.2.2.2), and verbs require either of their subordinating sufﬁxes -le or -ko to be attached (see §8.2.3.2 for discussion of these sufﬁxes). Deverbal derivations also frequently contain the ‘assertive’ sufﬁx -ka (cf. §9.2.4).
Each attribution preﬁx exhibits allomorphy conditioned by the stem to which it attaches. The allomorph with a, i.e. ka-/ma-, occurs with inalienable noun roots and with (most) h-initial roots of any word class (but note the exceptions where the h is retained in (212) below). Some examples are provided in (208)-(210):
(208) a. -mane ‘body of’ b. kamane- ‘having a body’ c. mamane- ‘incorporeal’
(209) a. -hap1 ‘bone of’ b. kahap1- ‘having bones’ c. mahap1- ‘boneless’
(210) a. -c¸i ‘small member of’ b. kac¸i- ‘fruiting’ c. mac¸i- ‘seedless’
The consonant-only allomorph, k- / m- is used with alienable noun stems beginning with consonants other than h (211), and also with a very few h-initial stems that retain the h when preﬁxed (212):2
2Due to a lack in my corpus, I cannot at this point conﬁrm that the privative versions of the examples in (212) would also have the consonant-only allomorph, or whether they would follow the pattern illustrated in (214) and begin with m1-.
98

(211) a. kÙayne- ‘having scabies’ (Ùayi ‘scabies’; -ne ‘possessed’)
b. kmasne- ‘having a gourd bowl’ (mas1 ‘gourd bowl’ -ne ‘possessed’)
c. mwaka- ‘extinct’ (hwa ‘be, do’ -ka ‘assertive’)
d. kwen1- ‘valuable’ mwen1- ‘cheap, free’ (wen1ta ’pay for (tr)’)
e. myayicka- ‘healthy’ (yayica ‘be ill’)
f. mnika- ‘fasting’ (nika ‘eat’)

(212) a. khan1nro- ‘having a wife’ (hn1nro ‘wife of’)3
b. khiwaka- ‘named, classiﬁed’ (hiwaka ‘name’)
c. khiwekle- ‘living, spiritual’ (hiweka ‘be alive’)
For most h-initial stems, the initial h is replaced by the privative or derivational
preﬁx:

(213)

kalicakle- ‘believing’ malicka- ‘unbelieving’ malicko- ‘unbelievable’
(halica ‘believe (tr)’); -ka ‘assertive’; -le ’subordinate’)

With the privative preﬁx only, if the stem begins with hi and the initial h is replaced by m-, the stem-internal i changes to 1, just as it does with the Class 1 pronominal preﬁxes (see §3.2.1.1). This change does not occur with the attributive preﬁx, as the pairs in (214) and (215) illustrate (hiÙko- has no attributive derivation, presumably for semantic reasons):
3The absence of a in the root, and its appearance in the possessed form, is an irregularity proper to this particular noun.
99

(214) a. kihle- ‘good’ b. m1hle- ‘bad’
(215) a. hiÙko- ‘strong’ b. m1Ùko- ‘weak’
The attribution preﬁxes can also derive attributive or privative adjectives from other adjective roots. (215) was one example set; others are provided in (216):
(216) a. wamon1- ‘sad’ kwamon1- ‘poor, unfortunate’
b. how1ka- ‘long, far’ mow1ka- ‘short’
c. pokyo- ‘ﬂexible’ mpokyo- ‘rigid’
However, it is not the case that all k- or m-initial adjectives are derived. There are a number of such roots that, although their semantics resemble those of attributive or privative adjectives, their morphology is not compositional. This is especially the case with k: common examples include ksac¸i- ‘black’, kata- ‘brilliant, ksolo- ‘goosebumped’, and kohne- ‘of good character’.
There are a small number of other m-initial adjectives that are not obviously derived forms; for example mt1r1 ’small’ and mtser1- ’thin’.
4.3.2 Formative preﬁxes
There are two commonly-occurring formatives found in adjectival stems: po- ‘thoroughly’ and ho- ‘long’, many of which share a recognizable base4 with another part of speech. However, the shared portion does not itself always constitute a true stem, as it does with the attribution preﬁxes described above. It is primarily for this reason
4By ‘base’ I mean a submorphemic element shared between lexical items which does not necessarily occur independently. Some bases may be formally identical to bound morphemes, but not all are.
100

that po- and ho- are analyzed not as true derivational preﬁxes, but rather as adjective formatives with some derivational properties.
Po- can be loosely translated as ‘having the property of [base] to a great extent or thoroughly’. The examples in (217) below illustrate this, in comparison with other related words.
(217) a. pohmi- ‘perforable’ (hihmita ‘be pierced’)
b. poSiype- ‘given to shuddering’ (hiSiypeta ‘shudder’)
c. poSpo- ‘easily peeled; easily frightened (hiSpoka ‘be peeled; be frightened’) (hiSpol1 ‘smallpox, disease that causes skin to peel’)
d. poc¸i- ‘having many seeds’ (-c¸i ‘seed, small member of’)
e. popowa- ‘clothed (person)’ (-powa ‘roll of’
Ho- has the same morphological behavior as po-, occuring in the pre-root position as a formative preﬁx and able to co-occur with an attribution preﬁx (see below). It is straightforwardly translatable as ‘long’:
(218) a. hoyhi- ‘long-toothed’ (-yhi ‘tooth of’)
b. hosta- ’long’ (-sta ‘chest of; width of’)
c. hoyaka- ‘durable, longlasting’ (yaka ‘more’)
d. hopetsa- ‘having long leg bones and muscles’ (-petsa ‘tendon of’)
101

These formatives are not incompatible with an attribution preﬁx; the two frequently co-occur as their semantics allow: e.g. moyaka- ‘fragile’, cf. (218c); mow1ka- ‘short’ vs. how1ka- ‘far’ (cf. (216) above); pohro- ‘weak; loosely attached’ vs. mpohro‘strong; half-attached’.
4.3.3 Agreement
An adjective must agree in gender with the noun it modiﬁes, or with its subject if the adjective is the predicate head. There are two sets of gender agreement sufﬁxes: the functionally unmarked set, -l1 (masculine) / -lo (feminine) and the ‘privative’ set -t1 (masculine) / -to (feminine). The only adjectives that do not mark gender agreement with these sufﬁxes are those that contain a thematic gender vowel (as was noted in §4.1.1 above). Both of these agreement sufﬁxes also function as nominalizers (see Chapter 7).
(219) c¸inan1ro paranta; hi pomenro [ c¸inan1-lo paranta ]CL [ hi pomeno-lo ]CL [ full-SGF plantain ] [ NEG skinny-SGF ] ‘The plantains are fat; (they are) not skinny.’ (DP)
(220) powral1 panÙi waneynina, powral1 kosina [ powra-l1 panÙi ]NP:E [ wane-ya-ni-na ]PRED [ clean-SGM house ] [ there/thus-APPL-AFFCT-3PL ] [ powra-l1 kosina ]NP(E) [ clean-SGM kitchen ] ‘They had a clean house, a clean kitchen.’ (C7)
Whether adjectives mark number agreement is not entirely clear. I have not encountered examples of number agreement occurring on adjective roots that do not also have gender agreement or a gender theme vowel. There are two ways to interpret this. It could be the case that number marking is a separate sufﬁx that follows gender agreement on the adjective stem, and only gender agreement is obligatory. Under
102

this analysis, (221) would be a single NP. The other possibility is that number is only marked once in an NP, on the head, and only occurs on nominalized adjectives. Under this analysis, (221) would be two juxtaposed NPs. Because there is no independent reason (such as phonological grouping) to choose the latter analysis, I have adopted the ﬁrst one, as the bracketing in (221) indicates: number agreement is marked separately from gender, and is optional.
(221) kewene ksac¸r1ne [ kewe-ne ksac¸i-ne ]NP [ dog-PL black-PL ] ‘black dogs’
The optionality of number agreement is illustrated in examples like (222):
(222) c¸ec¸ine mt1r1 [ c¸ec¸i-ne mt1r1 ]NP [ man-PL small+MASC ] ‘small men’ (Mshk117)
With privative-derived adjectives the gender agreement sufﬁx is almost always -t1 ‘privative masculine’ / -to ‘privative feminine’:
(223) a. mayhalet1 ‘blind (male)’ b. mayhaleto ‘blind (female)’

(224) waneyno mow1kat1 sawli

wane-ya-no

m-how1ka-t1

sawli

there/thus-loc/appl-1SG PRIV-long-PRIV+MASC machete

‘I have a short machete.’ (CVb)

However, while -t1/-to is strongly correlated with m-, it is not in a strict dependency relationship: there are several non-privative adjectives that take -t1 /-to (e.g. kayahol1t1 ’small-sized’, herot1 ’fresh, new’). Privative adjectives that take -l1 /-lo are not as common, and it is uncertain how productive this is.
103

Adjectives, then, obligatorily agree in gender with the head noun, and optionally in number. They do no mark person agreement, as (225) illustrates.
(225) pica seprolo hicyawaka pica sepro-lo hica-ya-waka 2SG crazy-SGF be/do-APPL-LOC.NOM ‘You’re being crazy.’ (feminine addressee) (C19)
4.3.4 Periphrastic exclamative construction
There is a special exclamative construction in Yine involving a predicate adjective where the auxiliary verb hica ‘be, do’, not the adjective, is the predicate head. In this construction, the adjective root has a distinctive intonation contour (cf. §2.5.3): its ﬁnal vowel is given a high pitch and is typically lengthened, and the primary stress shifts to the ﬁnal syllable. There is no agreement sufﬁx. While the high pitch and ﬁnal vowel lengthening are general properties of exclamative intonation, the construction with hica described here is unique to adjectives.
The entity which the adjective is modifying is the subject of hica and is indexed as such. The adjective also takes the sufﬁx -ta, which is in complementary distribution with the agreement sufﬁxes. While this sufﬁx is homophonous with the verb stemclosing sufﬁx -ta (see§8.2.4.1), it appears to function in this construction simply to host the exclamative phonology and does not verbalize the adjective.
The examples in (226)-(229) illustrate the exclamative adjective construction.
(226) powrata´ richimata! powra-ta´: r-hica-hima-ta clean-EXCL 3SGM-be/do-QUOT-VCL ‘It was so clean!’ (Gua10)
104

5 Nouns and Noun Morphology
Nouns constitute one of the three open word classes in Yine, the other two being verbs and – by derivation – adjectives. They can be distinguished from other word classes by their lexical, morphological and syntactic characteristics: they are lexically categorized for possessability and/or gender; they take possessive morphology and the plural sufﬁx -ne; they head a noun phrase; they can be incorporated (in their possessed form) into a verb stem; and when they head a predicate they take the impersonal subject markers for 3rd person referents. The noun phrase is discussed in Chapter 6, and noun incorporation is treated in §8.2.2. The purpose of the current chapter is to describe the lexical categories and morphological structure of the Yine noun. In §5.1, the alienable/inalienable distinction is presented along with gender in each noun subtype. The grammatical relevance of these categories will be addressed as relevant throughout the discussion of nominal morphology in §5.2, which presents the inﬂectional categories expressed on nouns and the order in which they appear relative to the nominal root.
5.1 Lexical distinctions: possessability and gender
The alienable/inalienable distinction is a central one in Yine. In addition to being a lexical category of noun roots, it has a signiﬁcant impact on morphological and syntactic operations, with implications for noun incorporation and agreement as well as gender assignment and number marking patterns. These implications are discussed as they arise in the appropriate sections in the grammar; in the current chapter, the implications for gender assignment, number marking and agreement ﬁgure prominently.
Gender cuts across the alienable/inalienable distinction, with both alienable and inalienable nouns having grammatical gender. However, possessability and gender are
107

not entirely independent of each other in Yine, as will be seen especially in the discussion of inalienable nouns in §5.1.3 below. For this reason, the current section is organized ﬁrst around possessability, beginning with alienable nouns in §5.1.1 followed by inalienable nouns in §5.1.2.
5.1.1 Alienable nouns
The majority of nouns in Yine are alienable. For these, being possessed – and specifying the possessor – is not a grammatical requirement. When they are possessed, they are obligatorily marked as such with one of ﬁve sufﬁxes dedicated to this purpose. The choice between the ﬁve sufﬁxes is to some extent predictable; this is discussed in detail in §5.2.2 below.
All alienable nouns are lexically speciﬁed as either masculine or feminine. For human and other sex-differentiable referents, grammatical gender is consistent with natural gender. For all other referents the basis of gender assignment is not as obvious, though certain tendencies can be observed: for example, abstract nouns strongly tend to be masculine, as do larger animals and snakes; reptiles, insects, small animals and birds tend to be feminine.
On most nouns gender is covert, and is revealed only through gender-sensitive agreement morphology, demonstratives, or anaphoric pronominal forms. Some nouns, however, have a phonological reﬂex of their gender such that masculine roots contain the vowel 1 and the feminine counterpart contains the vowel o. This is only true of highly animate nouns; some examples are given in (230)1- (233).
(230) makl1c¸i ‘boy, young man’ makloc¸i ‘girl, young woman’
1The -c¸i on makl1c¸i and makloc¸i may have a historical sources in the inalienable noun root -c¸i ‘small part of’, but there is no evidence that these are synchronically multimorphemic.
108

(231) mhenokl1 ‘male jaguar’ mhenoklo ‘female jaguar’
(232) hn1r1 ‘husband of’ hn1nro ‘wife of’
(233) tsr1 ‘big/old man’ tsro ‘big/old woman’
It is unlikely that it is a coincidence that the gender vowel is the same as that contained in the gender-agreement / nominalizing sufﬁxes -l1 (masc) and -lo (fem); rather, it suggests that the examples above may have a derivational origin. All of these examples are not, however, synchronically analysable words.
5.1.2 Inalienable nouns
Unlike alienable nouns, inalienable nouns are bound roots that form a single phonological word with their possessor, whether the latter be expressed by a free noun or a pronominal preﬁx.
In the absence of a possessor, the inalienable root must take the sufﬁx -Ùi,which appears in the same position in the noun template as the ‘possessed’ sufﬁx on alienable nouns (see §5.2.2) below.
Table 5.1 below presents a sampling of inalienable noun roots in Yine, showing their possessed (1SG where possible; otherwise 3SGM)2 and unpossessed forms (where available). This is not an exhaustive listing by any means: though closed, the set of inalienable nouns is quite large. Table 5.1 is organized into four major groupings: kinship term, parts of wholes and their extensions, geographical features, and spatial relations; inalienably possessed objects in the home and surroundings; and classiﬁcatory nouns. While primarily a conceptual grouping, each of these subtypes has a slightly different
2The possessor preﬁxes are discussed in §5.2.1.
109

morphosyntactic behavior, particularly with respect to gender agreement, as described in §5.1.3 below.
The semantically dependent nature of these nouns is reﬂected here and throughout this grammar in the translation of inalienables as “N of” (in glosses, “N.of”; cf. Facundes 2000).

5.1.3 Inalienable nouns and gender
This section describes how different types of inalienable noun roots behave with respect to gender, as revealed through gender agreement patterns. As will be seen, some inalienables appear to always have their own gender speciﬁcation; others appear to sometimes have their own gender speciﬁcation and sometimes rely on that of their possessor; and still others appear to never have their own gender speciﬁcation but rely entirely on that of their possessor.
The ability of an inalienable noun to control gender agreement appears to depend
110

largely on the extent to which it is conceptually and concretely differentiable from its possessor. The most differentiable are kinship terms and inalienably possessed objects; these are also the inalienable nouns that clearly have their own gender speciﬁcation, as illustrated in examples (234)-(235). With kinship terms, which have human referents, their grammatical gender is unsurprisingly the same as the natural gender of their referent.

Body parts and other parts of wholes are (by deﬁnition) inherently associated with their possessors and thus have a closer conceptual link to them; however, it is not impossible to view them as distinct concrete entities in their own right. This property of
111

being both a part of and distinct from their possessor is reﬂected in agreement patterns: with these, either the possessor or the noun itself can control agreement depending on which is the more prominent in the particular context. This is illustrated in the examples below:

(237) a. rakapSotno noc¸icic¸i r-hakapSota-no no-c¸icic¸i 3SGM-step.on-1SG 1SGPSSR-toe.of
‘He stepped on my toe.’ (h148)

3SGM-step.on-3SGM 1SGPSSR-toe.of

‘He stepped on my toe.’ (h148)

(Agreement with possessor) (Agreement with body part)

However, there is a signiﬁcant gap in these examples, at least in my corpus: while it can be treated as grammatically masculine, as with ‘toe’ in (12), the inalienable noun never triggers feminine agreement.Consider, for example, the sentence in (238). Here, the possessor is 1st person singular; not surprisingly, the 1SG object sufﬁx can be used to index it as in (237a). In this particular example, I myself am the possessor of the foot in question: in spite of the fact that I am female, only masculine gender is acceptable in the object marker, as in (237b), vs. (238).3

3SGM-step.on-3SGF 1SGPSSR-toe.of

That is, a body part noun can trigger either person agreement with the possessor,
or 3SG agreement, and if 3SG, only 3SGM is possible. From examples like this we can
make two useful observations. First, the ‘gender’ of the part noun is not the natural
gender of the possessor. 4 Second, the fact that it is only masculine agreement that is
3This is reminiscent of ‘external possession’ constructions where a highly affected possessor may be treated as a core argument of the predicate; cf. Payne and Barshi (1999).
4Yine does allow agreement with natural gender when 1st and 2nd person referents are involved. An example can be found in example (856) in §12.3.3.1: brieﬂy, in that example the form of a genderdistinguishing interrogative word expresses the gender of the addressee, though 2nd person pronouns do not distinguish gender in Yine.
112

acceptable supports the view that masculine gender is functionally unmarked in Yine. It is possible that all part nouns are lexically assigned masculine gender, but more likely it is the case that part nouns have no gender speciﬁcation at all and therefore the functionally unmarked gender form is used in marking agreement with them.
Finally, we come to classiﬁcatory nouns, which express the physical properties of their possessor and are, conceptually, inseparable from their possessor. These nouns never control agreement features: agreement with such nouns always expresses the gender of the possessor.

There is no a priori reason to assume, then, that classiﬁcatory nouns have a gender speciﬁcation; rather, they may be analysed as a subclass of noun roots that lack gender entirely, or could be said to ‘inherit’ the gender of their possessor.

5.2 Noun morphology

The structure of the Yine noun is summarized in (241), and its morphology is described in the indicated sections. The 3PL possessor sufﬁx is in parentheses because it properly belongs with the possessor preﬁxes, as it is dependent upon the 3(SGM) preﬁx; but it appears at the end of the inﬂected noun. For alienable nouns, the only obligatory element is the noun itself; even number inﬂection is optional for most alienable nouns (see §5.2.5 below). For inalienable nouns, the noun root and its possessor are both obligatory.5

The pronominal preﬁxes were presented and their distribution summarized in Table 3.2 in Chapter 3, but for more convenient reference they are repeated here in Table 5.2 below. (Note that 3PL possessor marking requires the sufﬁx -na, which co-occurs with the 3rd person (non-feminine-singular) preﬁx regardless of the preﬁx class).
There are two factors that are involved in the choice of possessor preﬁx: the subclass of noun (alienable, inalienable, or kin); and the phonological shape of the (beginning of the) stem. Neither of these factors is sufﬁcient in itself; rather, it is a com-

bination of the two that yields the best results for predicting the preﬁx class of a given noun.

5.2.1.1 Inalienable noun possessor preﬁxes: non-kin
Non-kin inalienable nouns are the most consistent in terms of their preﬁx class: nearly all of them take Class 3. Representative examples are given in (242)-(247); but note that kinship nouns are treated separately below.
(242) a. -myo ‘hand of’ b. nomyo ‘my hand’ c. himyo ‘his hand’

(243) a. -stsi ‘side of’ b. nostsi ‘my side, beside me’ c. histsi ‘his side, beside him’

(244) a. -pc¸i ‘house of’ b. nopc¸i ‘my house’ c. hipc¸i ‘his house’

(245) a. -hr1ko ‘quarters of’ b. nohr1ko ‘my quarters’ c. hihr1ko ‘his quarters’
115

(247) a. -twa ‘arc of’ b. hitwa ‘arc-shaped masculine thing’ c. totwa ‘arc-shaped feminine thing’
A very few inalienable nouns take Class 2 preﬁxes. These exceptions could plausibly be attributed to their phonology: the noun root in question conforms to the Class 2 proﬁle (see §3.2.1.1) in that it begins with h followed by a vowel other than i:
(248) a. -hac¸cihi ‘track, footprint of’ b. nac¸cihi ‘my footprint’ c. rac¸cihi ‘his footprint’
(249) a. -hec¸ha ‘scrotum of’ b. nec¸ha ‘my scrotum’ c. rec¸ha ‘his scrotum’
(250) a. -hayic¸i ‘spine of’ b. nayic¸i ‘my spine’ c. rayic¸i ‘his spine’

5.2.1.3 Alienable noun possessor preﬁxes
Alienable nouns take either the Class 1 or Class 2 possessor preﬁxes, with the choice between them being fully predictable based on the phonological form of the stem to which it attaches. That is, alienable noun stems beginning with h take Class 1; and stems beginning with any consonant other than h take Class 2.

5.2.2 Possessed status sufﬁxes
The possessed status sufﬁx is a marker of whether the noun is possessed or not. It is obligatory with alienable nouns that are possessed (hence the gloss ‘-PSSD’) and with inalienable nouns that are not possessed (hence ‘-UNPSSD’) – that is, when the expression of the possessor of the inalienable noun is suppressed. As indicated in (241), ‘possessed’ and ‘unpossessed’ are distinct sets, with one set (composed of ﬁve sufﬁxes) used for alienable possession and the other (with one sufﬁx only) used for inalienable non-possession. These sets will be addressed separately below, beginning with the unpossessed inalienable sufﬁx -Ùi.
5.2.2.1 -Ùi ‘unpossessed inalienable’
If the possessor of an inalienable noun is not expressed within the NP, the sufﬁx -Ùi is used to indicate that this is an unpossessed inalienable noun. In addition to suppressing the possessor speciﬁcation, -Ùi allows the inalienable noun to function as an independent word. Most of the subtypes of inalienable noun can be sufﬁxed with -Ùi:
118

kin terms (259); body parts (260); and inalienably possessed objects (261). However, -Ùi sufﬁxed classiﬁcatory nouns are not attested in my corpus.
(259) a. hinroÙi ‘mother of’ (cf. n1nro ‘my mother’)
b. meknatc¸irÙi ‘brother in law of (of female)’ (cf. nomeknatc¸ir1 ‘my b-in-law’)
(260) a. myoÙi ‘hand’ (cf. nomyo ‘my hand’)
b. hac¸cihÙi ‘track, footprint’ (cf. nac¸cihi ‘my footprint’)
(261) a. hr1kÙi ‘quarters’ (cf. nohr1ko ‘my quarters’)
The possessed and unpossessed forms of the root are irregular in a very small set of inalienables: e.g. panÙi ‘house (unpossessed)’ / nopc¸i ‘my house’; ÙiÙi ‘ﬁrewood’ / noÙima ‘my ﬁrewood’.
5.2.2.2 -te,-ne,-re,-e, -le: ‘possessed alienable’
In addition to the possessor preﬁx, possessed alienable nouns take a special sufﬁx identifying them as such. This ‘possessed’ sufﬁx occurs immediately following the noun stem and has ﬁve different forms: -te, -ne, -re, -e,6 and -le. The choice between these sufﬁxes is largely predictable based on a combination of semantic and morphological factors as described below. The four possessed sufﬁxes and the characteristics of the stem to which each attaches are brieﬂy summarized in Table 5.3. Note that the characteristics presented below only represent general tendencies, and it is likely that for many of the nouns the appropriate possessed sufﬁx is simply memorized. (The -te and
6Because of stem-ﬁnal vowel deletion, this surfaces as a change of the stem-ﬁnal vowel to e.
119

-ne classes are especially difﬁcult to characterize, while the other classess are more restrictive and have fewer exceptions.)7
Note that -te is the only ‘possessed’ sufﬁx that never triggers stem-ﬁnal vowel deletion (regarding which see §2.3.1).
-te residual class; most loanwords -ne human referents; high cultural relevance; utilized in important activities -re instrument nominalizations; a few others -e -l1 nominalizations; a few others -le -waka nominalizations; at least one other, optionally
Table 5.3: Possessed alienable noun sufﬁxes
-TE The -te class appears to be the functionally unmarked possessed sufﬁx class, involving nearly all loanwords as well as a wide variety of nouns that do not ﬁt the ‘proﬁle’ of the other classes (as described below); it is also the most common of the possessed sufﬁxes in my data. Examples of nouns that take -te are given in (262) below; they include animals (other than pets, cultivated plants and other important animates), plants, inanimates, and, as noted, most loanwords.
(Throughout the current section I will present examples with a 1sg possessor in order to keep the irrelevant morphology as unobtrusive as possible.)
(262) a. het1 ‘tree frog’; net1te ‘my tree frog’ b. mrici ‘peccary’; nmricite ‘my peccary’ c. hetlo ‘zapote’; netlote ‘my zapote’ d. c¸imeka ‘yucca’; nc¸imekate ‘my yucca’ e. kSana ‘herb’; nkSanate ‘my herb’ f. kamla ‘termite’; nkamlate ‘my termite’ g. kanawa ‘boat’; nkanawate ‘my boat’ h. riwi ‘shingles’; nriwite ‘my shingles’
7The examples in this section were obtained through the elicitation of noun paradigms.
120

i. rimiryo ‘cure’ (Sp. remedio); nrimiryote ‘my cure’ j. taso ‘bowl’ (Sp. tazon); ntasote ‘my bowl’
-NE The -ne class of nouns seems best characterized in semantic terms. These nouns typically have referents that are human8 or in some cases nonhuman animates (263). Inanimate members of this class typically refer to objects utilized in daily or ceremonial life (264), or natural entities with similar importance (265).
(263) a. s1co ‘woman’; ns1cne ‘my woman’ b. Sima ‘ﬁsh’; nSimne ‘my ﬁsh’
(264) a. mas1 ‘gourd bowl’; nmasne ‘my gourd bowl’ b. Ùalkat1 ‘basket’; nÙalkatne ‘my basket’ c. hisa ‘herb magic’; n1sane ‘my herb magic’ d. kowi ‘horn’; nkowne ‘my horn’ e. Ùal1 ‘ﬁshing net’; nÙalne ‘my ﬁshing net’
(265) a. hon1 ‘water’; nonne ‘my water’ b. Ùic¸i ‘land’; noÙic¸ne ‘my land, country’ c. taSi ‘white clay’; ntaSne ‘my white clay’ d. Sic¸i ‘corn’; nSic¸ne ‘my corn’
Other -ne nouns have no obvious semantic reason for being in this class:
(266) a. Ùayi ‘scabies’; nÙayne ‘my scabies’ b. tsomi ‘worm’; ntsomne ‘my worm’
8Not including kinship terms, which are inalienable.
121

-RE Nearly all of the nouns that take -re are instrument nominalizations, derived using the sufﬁx -pi (see §7.5). Typical examples are given in (267).
(267) a. heroyhipi ‘toothbrush’; neroyhipre ‘my toothbrush’ b. kowÙohapi ‘ﬁshing gear’; nkowÙohapre ‘my ﬁshing gear’ c. SiSyapi ‘clothes brush’; nSiSyapre ‘my clothes brush’ d. yonawapi ‘pencil’; nyonawapre ‘my pencil’
The examples in (268) below illustrate that the -pi need not be stem ﬁnal9.
(268) a. hatskopic¸e ‘stairs’; natskopic¸ere ‘my stairs’ b. holopic¸e ‘smoking rack’; nolopic¸ere ‘my smoking rack’ c. t1plapic¸e ‘bench’; nt1plapic¸ere ‘my bench’ d. sapripic¸e ‘shuttle’; nsapripic¸ere ‘my shuttle’
It is not the case, however, that all instrument nouns belong to this class. For example, (269) has instrumental semantics, but is not derived; it belongs to the -te class.
(269) sameta ‘polisher’; nsametate ‘my polisher’
The example in (270), on the other hand, is a -pi-derived instrument noun and therefore ‘should’ belong to the -re class; but it does not. Instead, it belongs to the -ne class – unsurprisingly, since it ﬁts the -ne-class semantics very nicely: a broom is an item that is important to daily life.
(270) sacripi ‘broom’; nsacripne ‘my broom’
Finally, I would like to draw attention to a few nouns that rather unexpectedly belong to the -re class (the ﬁrst two of which are examples of secondary possession; regarding this see §5.2.4 below):
9It is perhaps signiﬁcant that these are all compound nouns ending with the classiﬁcatory noun -c¸e ‘stick of, stalk of’. The signiﬁcance here might be with the properties of -c¸e, or of classiﬁcatory nouns in general. Unfortunately, I do not have the data to speculate further on this question.
122

(271) a. hiÙkehi ‘mashed green plantains’; n1Ùkehre ‘my mashed ...’ b. himsahi ‘pile of garbage’; n1msahre ‘my pile ...’ c. haShac¸i ‘clay jar’; naShac¸re ‘my clay jar’
These are not instrument nouns, but interestingly they do share one property with -pi nominalizations: they all end with a front vowel. Because this is an environment that is known to trigger an allophonic r10, we might reasonably hypothesize that the -re class is in fact entirely phonologically determined. However, this cannot be the case, since not all words that end in i or e take the -re sufﬁx. For example, Ùic¸i ‘land’, Sic¸i ‘corn’, and naÙi all take -ne; and more siginiﬁcantly, there is a large set of animal names that end with -pi11 yet take the -te sufﬁx. We can conclude, then, that the front vowel characterizes, but does not deﬁne, the -re class, and if phonology is involved at all it is less important than the presence of dedicated instrumental morphology. However, I will return to this question shortly, and take a more detailed – but very speculative – look at a possible phonological role in both this class and the -e class, linking them with the -le class.
-E The class of -e-sufﬁxing nouns are, like the -re class, nominalizations. Most of these are -l1 derivations12, as in the following examples:
(272) a. nepomle ‘my question’ (hepoml1 ‘question’; nepomhal1 ‘I ask him’)
b. n1nkakle ‘my story’ (hinkakl1 ‘story’; n1nkaka ‘I tell a story’)
c. nsac¸r1kle ‘my turn’ (sac¸r1kl1 ‘(a) turn’; nsac¸r1ka ‘I turn’)
d. nsapowle ‘my blanket’ (sapowl1 ‘blanket’; nsapowakl1 ‘I wrap him up’)
10Speciﬁcally, where l surfaces as r-see §2.3.4. 11The pi in this case comes from the classiﬁcatory noun -pi ‘long, thin, soft object’ commonly used, for example, to derive snake names from other words: e.g. mÙirapi ‘spider monkey snake’, cf. mÙira ‘spider monkey’; another example of this sort is protapi ‘dragonﬂy’. 12i.e. product/object nominalizations-see §7.1 for a full discussion.
123

e. nmeyiwle ‘my celebration’ (meyiwl1 ‘celebration’; meyiwata ‘I celebrate’)
There are, however, a few (synchronically) underived nouns in the -e class:
(273) a. nkahle ‘my clay’ kahli ‘clay’
b. nsotle ‘my rock’ sotl1 ‘rock’
c. nolote ‘roast meat’ holot1 ‘roast meat’
d. nc¸imapre ‘my roast plantain’ c¸imapro ‘roast plantain’
-LE Nouns derived with the location/manner nominalizer -waka, take -le as their marker of possessed status.
(274) a. nyopc¸ewakle ‘my port’ n-yopic¸e-waka-le 1SG-descend-FREQ-LOC.NOM-PSSD ‘my port’
b. yapaSawakle Ø-yapaSa-waka-le 3-roam-LOC.NOM-SUBD ‘his territory, the place where he roamed’ (Bfm4)
At least one underived noun, himsahi ‘pile of garbage’ can take either -le or -re when possessed: n1msahle, n1msahre ‘my pile of garbage.’
5.2.2.3 Phonological basis for -re and -e classes?
On purely phonological grounds, we might speculate that the -re and -e sufﬁxes are allomorphs of -le. The reasoning behind this speculation is as follows (and see Chapter 2 for more discussion of the processes mentioned here). First, -re could surface from a morpheme of the form -le because of the fact that r, but not l, may occur following the
124

front vowels in the Yine phonological system. Because all noun stems of the -re class end with a front vowel, a sufﬁx of the shape -le would always surface as -re. Thus it is possible to claim that the -re class is in fact an allomorph of -le.
Phonological facts could likewise allow for calling the -e class an allomorph of an original -le sufﬁx. Two aspects of the phonological system are relevant here. First, there is the widespread stem-ﬁnal vowel deletion (apocope), which would remove the 1 from the nominalizer -l1 and leave us with a stem ending in l. With the addition of a ‘possessed’ sufﬁx of the shape -le, an illicit cluster of identical segments is then created: lle. As discussed in §2.3.2, an illicit ll sequence is repaired by deleting one of the l’s: -lle is pronounced as -le. The end result, then, is an apparent change of 1 to e signalling the addition of the ‘possessed’ sufﬁx.
This phonological motivation for uniting -re and -e with -le is consistent with the current phonological system of Yine, and has the advantage of accounting for the phonological aspect involved in these two classes (but absent from the -te and -ne classes). However, it remains purely speculative. It is worth noting, in favor of the distinct-class analysis, that Proto-Arawak is supposed to have had -re and -e as separate markers of possessed nouns (Aikhenvald 1999:82; Payne 1991:378).

5.2.3 Periphrastic possession
Animals that are typically kept as pets are treated differently from other nouns with respect to their possessed forms. While it is possible to sufﬁx them with one of the above ‘possessed’ sufﬁxes (usually -te, e.g. kewe ‘dog’, nkewete ‘my dog’), a periphrastic construction is more commonly used. The construction involves the inalienable noun root -pra ‘young of, domestic animal of’:

(275) nopra kewe

no-pra

kewe

1SGPSSR-pet.of dog

‘my domesticated dog’

125

(276) nopra haxawripa

no-pra

haxawripa

1SGPSSR-pet.of chicken

‘my domesticated chicken’

A similar construction is available for cultivated plants, using the derived alienable noun hitakl1 ‘plant, crop’. The generic term is possessed in the usual way (as an unexceptional -e-class noun) and is followed in the same NP with the bare noun referring to the plant itself:

(277) n1takle kir1

n1-hitakl1-e

kir1

1SGPSSR-plant-PSSD peach.palm

’my peach palm plant’ (b98)

Again, the normal possession marking strategy is also possible with these nouns (e.g. nkir1te ‘my peach palm’), but the sense of cultivation is then lost.
These constructions, which are always optional, are reminiscent of the possessive generic classiﬁers found in some Yuman, Uto-Aztecan, and North Carib languages (Aikhenvald 2000:126ff). Within the Arawak family, generic classiﬁers are attested in Palikur in the description by Aikhenvald and Green (1998:460), where they are attributed to inﬂuence from Carib.

5.2.4 Secondary possession
Most inalienable nouns can be possessed by a ‘secondary’ possessor – an entity other than their inherent (‘primary’) possessor; only kinship terms cannot. In order to morphologically express secondary possession, the ‘possessed’ alienable sufﬁx is attached to the possessed inalienable noun stem; this is illustrated in examples (278)-(281) below.

126

(278) tomec¸ite to-mec¸i-te 3SGFPSSR-feather.of-PSSD
‘her feathers’ (possessor is, e.g., a woman) (EM:100)

(279) nc¸emate tpali

n-c¸ema-te

tpali

1SGPSSR-tapir-PSSD leg.of

‘my leg of a tapir’ (EM:100)

(280) noc¸ete no-c¸e-te 1SGPSSR-stick.of-PSSD ‘my stick-shaped thing’ (e.g. ‘my pen(cil)’) (g26)
The possessed sufﬁx may appear either on the primary possessor or at the end of
the possessed inalienable noun stem; both appear to be equally valid (in fact, the two options in example (281) occur seven sentences apart in the same narrative text13).
(281) a. nnaylotsate n-naylo-tsa-te 1sgPSSR-plastic-cord.of-PSSD ‘my plastic cord / cord of plastic’ (h80)
b. nnaylotetsa n-naylo-te-tsa 1sgPSSR-plastic-PSSD-cord.of ‘my plastic cord / cord of plastic’ (h80)

5.2.5 Plural number sufﬁx
Yine can be described as having a general (or unmarked) vs. plural number contrast on
nouns; that is, nouns are either unmarked for number, which can be interpreted as either
13After considerable discussion – prompted by a direct inquiry on my part about any difference between the two options – my consultants came to the agreement that naylotsate was a preferable form. It was also agreed that perhaps naylotetsa was more like something an older person would say, while younger speakers would more likely use naylotsate. These impressions were not brought to other speakers for conﬁrmation, however.
127

singular or plural, or explicitly marked as plural with the sufﬁx -ne. Explicit number marking is obligatory only for humans, and the likelihood of a given noun appearing with -ne seems to be tied to animacy: the more animate the referent, the more likely it will receive number marking. However, it is never impossible to pluralize a count noun with -ne.

(282)

c¸ec¸i-ne ‘men’ nomole-ne ‘my brethren’ kSiyoc¸r1-ne ‘caimans’ sotl1-ne ‘rocks’

Typically, the plural sufﬁx appears after the ‘possessed status’ sufﬁx. This is the order given in (241), and it can be seen in the examples below:

(283) ntsomitne n-tsomi-te-ne 1SG-worm-PSSD-PL
‘my worms’ (b47)

(284) nkapayotne n-kapayo-te-ne 1SG-papaya-PSSD-PL ‘my papayas’ (b89)
However, this order is not ﬁxed. Though rare, it is possible for their relative order to be reversed, as in (285).
(285) a. ntsetsetne n-tsetse-te-ne 1SG-cricket-PSSD-PL ‘my crickets’ (b43)
b. ntsetsnete n-tsetse-ne-te 1SG-cricket-PL-PSSD ‘my crickets’ (b43)
128

It is not clear at this point whether the ordering difference is grammatically signiﬁcant (perhaps as a reﬂection of the scope of the plural sufﬁx).
5.2.6 Third person plural possessor sufﬁx
As indicated in (241), the sufﬁx -na is used in conjunction with the 3rd singular (masculine) preﬁx to cross-reference a 3rd person plural possessor (unmarked for gender). The 3PL sufﬁx occurs at the end of the inﬂected noun, following not only the possessed status (286) and number (287) sufﬁxes, but also any phrase- or clause-level morphology that may be attached to the noun. The latter two categories are not selective for the word class of their host and therefore do not ﬁt into a description of noun morphology per se; they are described in §6.7 (phrasal) and §9.5 (clausal).
(286) kanawatna Ø-kanawa-te-na 3-boat-PSSD-3PL ‘their canoe(s)’ (Unc28)
(287) himolenna hi-mole-ne-na 3SGMPSSR-relative.of-PL-3PL ‘their relatives’ (Dil8)
Theoretically, there should be no restriction against a noun being marked with a possessed sufﬁx, a plural sufﬁx and a 3pl possessor sufﬁx, along the lines of kaSrenna (Ø-kaSri-e-ne-na [3SGMPSSR-arrow-PSSD-PL-3PL]) ‘the arrows of each/all of them’ – the equivalent of (287) for alienable nouns – but no such examples occur in my corpus. The rarity of such constructions is not surprising given that a noun root can be interpreted as plural without being overtly marked as such. The most common way of expressing plurality of both possessor and possessum in Yine is simply to use the 3PL possessor morphology, and leave the number of possessed objects unexpressed but implied (as in (286) above).

6 The Noun Phrase
This chapter examines the internal structure and organization of the Yine noun phrase (NP). The constituents of the NP are presented ﬁrst (§6.1), followed by a discussion of modiﬁers, their types, and their positioning in the phrase (§6.2). Prominently featured in this discussion is the observation that adjectives and other descriptive modiﬁers are able to precede or follow the head noun, and several possible factors in this choice are explored. The use of nominalizations as relative clause strategies is also addressed. The focus of the discussion then turns to the head noun itself. §6.3 examines the properties of NP heads in Yine and identiﬁes important differences between alienable and inalienable nouns in terms of their headship properties. Nounless and discontinuous NPs are addressed in §6.4 and §6.5, respectively, followed by a brief look at the structure of possessive NPs in §6.6. The chapter closes with a presentation of the phrasal sufﬁxes that are only attested in the NP in §6.7.
6.1 Noun Phrase Structure
The constituents of the Yine noun phrase are given in Table 6.1 below. The order in which they are listed reﬂects the order in which they occur; see §6.2 below for further discussion.
A Article B Demonstrative C Quantiﬁer, Numeral D Pre-head modiﬁer E Head noun F Post-head modiﬁer Table 6.1: Constituents of the Yine NP
131

With the probable exception of the modiﬁer positions, elements listed in the same position here are mutually exclusive and may occur only once. That is, a single NP may contain maximally one article; maximally one demonstrative; either a quantiﬁer or a numeral. It remains an open question as to what extent multiple adjectives are used to modify a single noun in the same modiﬁer position; this is discussed in §6.2.1 below.
There do not appear to be any cooccurrence restrictions between the positions given in Table 6.1. Though I have not encountered any examples where all six positions are ﬁlled, I have also not found any indication that it is grammatically impossible to do so. The examples presented in (288)-(290) below were selected to both illustrate the relative order and the co-occurrence of each of the positions. Taken together, they suggest that a fully-elaborated noun phrase would be grammatically permissable.
The positions represented in each example are indicated along the righthand margin.

Noun phrases in which the head noun is possessed constitute a special subclass of NP and are described in §6.6 below.
132

6.2 Modiﬁers and NP-internal word order

The term ‘modiﬁer’ is used in various ways in the literature. Here, I use it only to refer to descriptive modiﬁers, those that describe some property of the head noun. In Yine, the set of modiﬁers according to this deﬁnition includes adjectives, nouns, adverbs, NPs and nominalizations; and it excludes the article, demonstratives, numerals, and quantiﬁers. If I need to refer to the latter as a set, I will use the term ‘determiner element’. This line is not purely descriptive but also has a syntactic basis. Within the Yine NP, constituent order is ﬁxed (in the order given in Table 6.1) for the determiner elements, but ﬂexible for modiﬁers.
The remainder of this section explores the potential factors inﬂuencing the relative order between the modiﬁer(s) and the head noun. Different modiﬁers show different degrees of ﬂexibility in their positioning, though there is, overall, a bias towards prenominal modiﬁers in my corpus. Adjectives and NPs have the most ﬂuid positioning. Nouns are less ﬂuid, and there is a subset of modiﬁer nouns that occur almost exclusively in post-nominal position. Adverbial modiﬁers show little if any ﬂexibility in their positioning and are almost always pre-head.
The discussion in this section will focus on adjectives to simplify the presentation. Other modiﬁer types are discussed below.
Some typical examples of adjectives in the NP are provided in (291)-(292) below.

133

The morphological structure of the adjective, including the obligatory gender agreement morphology, is discussed in Chapter 4. As the above examples illustrate, there is no formal difference between a pre-head adjective and one that follows the head noun, but as we will see, there may be pragmatic differences involved.
Examples of attributive adjectives are relatively infrequent in my corpus. Two other descriptive strategies are more common: 1) the adjective occurs as the predicate head in a nonverbal clause (see §11.5); or 2) the adjective occurs in a nounless NP, where it is arguably nominalized and is itself the NP head; (cf. §6.4 below). The sample size on which the following discussion is based is therefore not very large, and the discussion is necessarily somewhat tentative and incomplete. Nonetheless, some observations can be made concerning the relative order of the head noun and its modiﬁer.
In (293) below, two sentences are given that are identical except in the modiﬁernoun word order. When presented these sentences in an elicitation context, my consultants found both to be fully acceptable; however, they agreed that the [Adj N] order in (293a) was preferable to the [N Adj] order in (293b). What speciﬁcally made it preferable was not certain, but we might hypothesize based on this judgment that in the absence of any established discourse context, the [Adj N] order is most neutral (I will discount this conclusion later).

(293) a. wale ksac¸ir1 kewe saplewc¸eta

[ wale ksac¸i-l1 kewe ]NP:VS Ø-saplewa-c¸e-ta

[ 3SGM black-SGM dog ]

‘That black dog is barking.’ (c58)

‘That black dog is barking’

[Adj-N] [N-Adj]

Overall, the data in my corpus could be taken to support the same conclusion. For example, in a survey of 50 texts, the most common adjective, tsr1/tsro ‘big (m/f)’, occurs as a modiﬁer 73 times; of these, it precedes the head noun 71 times and follows
134

it only twice. This kind of asymmetry could be consistent with an analysis in which the [Adj N] order is pragmatically unmarked. However, there is other data that points to the opposite conclusion. Consider, for example, the sentences in (294) and (295), both taken from the same narrative text. These sentences depict a conversational exchange between two speakers, and both modiﬁer-noun orders are used:
(294) hita kowÙohatan1. Sima tsro nkosetan1 [ hita kowÙohata-n1 ]CL [ 1SG ﬁsh.with.hook-ANTIC ] [ [ Sima tsro ]NP:O n-koseta-n1 ]CL [ [ ﬁsh big+FEM ] 1SG-pull-ANTIC ] ‘I will ﬁsh with a line. I will catch a big ﬁsh.’ (Yami56)

(295) hita chal1hatan1. mt1ro Sima nkashiÙan1 [ hita chal1hata-n1 ]CL [ 1SG ﬁsh.with.net-ANTIC ]

[ [ mt1ro

Sima ]NP:O n-kaSiÙa-n1 ]CL

[ [ small+FEM ﬁsh ]

1SG-grab-ANTIC ]

‘I will ﬁsh with a net. I will catch a small ﬁsh.’ (Yami60)

It is apparent that a contrast is being played up here, and that the two modiﬁer positions are being exploited to underscore the contrast. But if the pre-head position is pragmatically neutral it is surprising to ﬁnd that order in the second, contrastive, utterance rather in than the ﬁrst. It is perhaps important that there are two things being contrasted here: the style of ﬁshing, and the size of the ﬁsh expected to be caught. As a result, the role of modiﬁer-noun order in playing up the contrast is not entirely clear. There are, unfortunately, no other comparable, explicitly contrastive exchanges in my corpus to offer further insight. However, this particular example does suggest that, contrary to what was hypothesized earlier, it is the [Adj N] order that focuses on the modiﬁer, while the post-head modiﬁer is more neutral.
We can tie together these apparently contradictory conclusions if we substitute the notion of ‘prominence’ in place of ‘pragmatic neutrality’. In Chapter 11, I describe
135

how constituent order in the clause core is ﬂexible, and there is a tendency for new and/or prominent information to precede old, established, topical or otherwise less prominent information. The same strategy seems to be at work here in the NP.1
In (293a) above, the adjective is in an NP that is completely isolated from any particular context; thus, the information it provides is necessarily new (and, presumably, highly relevant because it was deliberately included). In (295), the adjective is under focus because it is involved in an explicit contrast. Both examples are consistent in suggesting that if the information provided by the adjective is relatively prominent (new, focused or salient in the discourse context), the adjective is more likely to precede the noun. The reverse tendency obtains if the adjective offers topical or established information, or if the noun itself is more prominent. In general, this hypothesis is supported by the patterns in my corpus: a background or established modiﬁer tends to be expressed in post-nominal adjectives, and new and/or salient information brought in via pre-nominal adjectives. This is the case in the examples in (296), where the woman’s pot is ﬁrst introduced (t1mate) and then identiﬁed as big (tsr1 himat1) with a pre-nominal adjective in (296a). When this pot is referred to again two sentences later, the same modiﬁer follows the noun (296b).

(296) a. hawa t1mate, tsr1 himat1 . . .

hawa [ t1-himat1-e ]NP

[ himat1 tsr1 ]NP:O

there/thus 3SGF-remove.lid-PFV [ pot big+MASC ]

‘Thus she took the lid off the big pot’ (Sns6)

The example in (297) below offers a different sort of support for the prominence hypothesis, and further suggests that it is the relative prominence between adjective and noun that affects their order. This example is taken from a narrative about the
1The word order parallels between clause and NP go beyond this: in both constructions word order is ﬂexible around the head and its closest syntactic neighbors, and more rigid in the periphery.
136

traditional ﬁestas of the Yine. Both the adjective (kapsal1 ‘strong’) and the noun (koya) receive their ﬁrst mention in this sentence. The narrator has just established what his ancestors ate during the ﬁesta and here is moving on to focus on what they drank, making the koya (manioc beer) more prominent at this point than the fact that it is strong.

(297) wanepn1te wa r1ranr1na koya kapsal1

[ koya

kapsa-l1 ]NP:O

[ manioc.beer strong-SGM ]

‘Next, they drank up strong manioc beer.’ (Fie12)

While all of the above examples do suggest that modiﬁer-noun ordering is sensitive to their relative prominence, it is also clear that other factors must be involved as well. Particularly suggestive is the fact that pre-nominal adjectives are, on the whole, more common than post-nominal ones in my corpus (as we saw with tsr1 in the survey mentioned earlier). We might attribute this at least partially to the fact that adjectives are not usually carried through the discourse as topical information, and thus are more likely to be new and therefore pre-nominal. However, it is worth considering what other factors might be at play, especially those that are attested in other Amazonian languages. For example, Aikhenvald (2003) describes how the topicality, deﬁniteness and speciﬁcity of the head noun all inﬂuence modiﬁer-noun order in Tariana (North Arawak); and Fleck (2003) discusses how intrinsic, enduring characteristics are treated differently from temporary or transitory ones in Matses (Panoan). Another typologically common factor is the distinction between restrictive and non-restrictive meaning.
A proper investigation of these (and other) possible contributors to modiﬁer positioning in the NP awaits further research, but there is some indication that if they do have an inﬂuence it is not an obligatory one. For example, we saw in (296) above that the same adjective describing the same noun in the same story can appear either before or after the head noun. If the intrinsic versus transitory nature of the adjective were
137

central in Yine, we would not expect such a thing to happen. Further study is certainly warranted on this issue.

6.2.1 NPs with multiple adjectives
Examples like (290) above, where more than one element modiﬁes a single noun, are not common in my text corpus. Adjective stacking – more than one adjective in the same modiﬁer position – is even more rare; in fact I do not have any spontaneous examples of it. The only indication I have that it may be possible is the example given in (298); however, it is quite likely that this sentence is a calque as it was offered as a translation of its Spanish counterpart. It may not be representative of natural Yine speech. Further research is needed to determine the extent to which adjective stacking is possible, how much it is used, and what restrictions might be placed on it.

[ REF small+MASC-AFFCT grey-SGM-AFFCT dog-AFFCT ]

‘The big black dog bit the small grey dog.’ (f35)

6.2.2 Nouns as modiﬁers
Nouns can be used in Yine to modify the NP head in a variety of ways. For example, they may express the material from which the head noun is made, as in (299):

(299) kac¸pa himat1 r1wlatapyanna

[ kac¸pa himatu ]NP:E r-hiwlata-pa-ya-na-na

[ clay pot ]

3-cook-ELV-APPL-CMPV-3PL ]

‘They used to cook in clay pots.’ (Fie3)

138

Or they may restrict the reference of the head noun to a particular subset of its normal reference, as in (300)-(302):

(300) wa tw1 het1nero s1co

wa tw1

het1nero

s1co

REF PROX.SGF tree.frog.person+FEM woman

‘that tree-frog woman (Hetn110)

(301) wa payri c¸ec¸i wa payri c¸ec¸i REF spaniard man
‘the male Spaniard’ (Jrn12)

(302) kamec¸ir1 hoShac¸er1 kamec¸ir1 hoSa-hac¸e-l1 wild.bird forest-dweller-SGM
‘game bird.’ (Unc17)

It is also common for locational nouns to act as modiﬁers:

(303) hewiko napokan1tnaka wa diamante pokÙi

hewi-ko n-hapoka-n1-tnaka

[ wa Diamante pokÙi ]NP:E

here-EMPH 1SG-arrive-ANTIC-REIT [ REF NAME village ]

‘I will return right here again (to) Diamante village.’ (Jrn34)

These locational modiﬁers are particularly common when the NP head is deverbal, and the modiﬁer represents the notional equivalent of the original verb’s locative argument:

(304) wa ksat1 t1nwataÙri hanikatkal1

[ wa ksat1 t1nwata-Ùri ]NP:E

Ø-hanika-tka-l1

[ REF beach stand-SUBJ.NOM+MSG ] 3-carry-PFV-3SGM

‘The one (masc.) standing on the beach carried him off.’ (Yam109)

139

With some deverbal nominalizations, the transitivity of the original verb is retained (see Chapter 7). When such nominalizations head an NP, the entity corresponding to the object of the original verb appears in one of the modiﬁer positions.

(305) nc¸emamtlo pec¸ri konac¸i nikanataÙro

n-c¸ema-m-ta-lo

[ pec¸ri

1SG-hear-NONDUR-VCL-3SGF [ agouti

[ huicungo.fruit eat-DUR-VCL-SUBJ.NOM+FSG ] ]

‘I heard a huicungo-fruit eating agouti.’ (Caz10)

6.2.2.1 Classifying modiﬁers

A small subset of nouns are used with a generic sense to indicate the sex, age group, or size of the head noun. The nouns used this way are listed in Table 6.2, and representative examples follow. (The question marks in the table are addressed in the discussion below).

Human

Table 6.2: Classifying modiﬁers

For all animate referents, including humans, the terms for ‘man’ and ‘ woman’ can be used to distinguish male and female sex:

(306) saplewc¸eta wa c¸ec¸i knoya Ø-saplewa-c¸e-ta [ wa c¸ec¸i knoya ]NP:VS 3-shout-FREQ-VCL [ REF man tortoise ] ‘The male tortoise(s) kept roaring.’ (Kno26)
140

(307) hiyahni wa Sic¸i hima tyoc¸inata mayl1 s1co

hiyaho-ni

wa Sic¸i hima t-yoc¸inata

then-IMP.DECL REF corn QUOT 3SGF-crush

[ mayl1

s1co ]NP:VS

[ black.vulture woman ]

‘Then the female black vulture crushed the corn, reportedly.’ (Myl2)

There is an obvious resemblance between (307), with a classifying modiﬁer, and the example in (300) above, with a regular noun modiﬁer; but they are syntactically different. The difference between them is apparent from their meaning: in (300), s1co is the head noun – the NP refers to a type of woman; but in (307), s1co is a modiﬁer and the NP refers to a type of black vulture.
The terms for ‘adolescent male’ and ‘adolescent female’ allow for human referents to be further classiﬁed according to their general age group.2

[ SPEC+MASC people+MSC-QUOT adolescent+MSC ] take.wife

‘A certain young man took a wife, reportedly.’ (Nwd3)

While the above nouns are restricted in use to modifying animate referents, whene ‘child of’ (an inalienable noun) can be used with inanimates to indicate that the referent is a particularly small representative of its class; it functions essentially as a diminutive.

2This usage does not extend to nonhuman animates in my corpus, but I suspect this is a gap in my data and not a true restriction in the language.
141

(310) waneyhiml1 sato platowhene

‘The little clay bowl was thus-sized’ (hetn44)

(312) baldewhene balde-whene bucket-child.of ‘small bucket’
The difference between the inalienable use of whene and the diminutive use is not obvious when the modiﬁed noun is animate. This is the reason for the question marks in Table 6.2: with a human or animate head noun whene could be interpreted as meaning either ‘young of’ (a regular inalienable noun) or ‘young’ (a modiﬁer). I do not have any examples of whene being clearly used in the diminutive sense with animates; but neither can I rule out this possibility.
The function of an augmentative is carried out by another inalienable noun, hitsr1ka (hitsroka fem.), which, as illustrated in (313)-(315) below, can be used with head nouns of any animacy.
(313) himn1 hitsr1ka niklokanatkal1 [ himn1 hitsr1ka ]NP:VS Ø-nikloka-na-tka-l1 [ snake giant.of+MSC ] 3-swallow-CMPV-PFV-3SGM ‘A giant snake swallowed him.’ (Hmn41)

‘A huge tree was there.’ (Tra36)

While there is no indication that hitsr1ka/hitsroka is synchronically analysable, its form suggests a possible morphological source consistent with its current meaning, namely hi-tsr1-ka [3SGMPSSR-big+MSC-ASSRT] ‘a truly big one of’ (similarly for the feminine counterpart).

Concord in [N N] noun phrases As noted in Chapter 5.1.1, a handful of nouns reveal their grammatical gender through the thematic vowels 1 (masculine) and o (feminine). When one of these nouns heads an NP, it becomes clear that gender concord is obligatory between the head and modiﬁer nouns:

[ s1co mhenoklo ]NP:NVS

3SGF-QUOT-GENZ-IMP.DECL [ woman jaguar+FEM ]

‘She was a female jaguar.’ (d51)

Number concord, on the other hand, is optional. This can be seen in (317), where two [N N] NPs with plural heads are conjoined: the ﬁrst conjunct, c¸ec¸ine makl1c¸ine, shows number concord and the second, s1co makloc¸ine does not.

(317) cani hewi r1Spakinitka c¸ec¸ine makl1c¸ine hawa s1co makloc¸ine cani hewi r-hiSpaka-ini-tka [ c¸ec¸i-ne makl1c¸i-ne ]NP now here 3-exist-TEMP-PFV [ man-PL adolescent+MSC-PL ]

‘Now let the young men and young women leave from here.’ (E90)

6.2.2.2 Nominalizations: relative clause strategy
It is described in §7 how nominalizations can function directly as core arguments in a clause. They can also be used to modify a noun in a way that is comparable to that of relative clauses in many languages. As there is no dedicated relativizing morphology, no gap in the relativization, and no unique relative clause structure in the language, these constructions are analysed here as relativization strategies rather than true relative clauses.
Relativizations can be organized in terms of the role that the modiﬁed noun is interpreted as having in the modifying constituent. This role in Yine is determined by the type of nominalization employed, and is limited to nominalizations that correspond to the subject, object, or locative argument of the verb stem. Like other modiﬁers, nominalizations may either follow the modiﬁed noun or precede it; however, the postnominal position is more common. It may be noted that the use of nominalizations as phrase-heading arguments is much more common in my corpus than their use as nominal modiﬁers.
Some typical examples of nominalizations as modiﬁers are provided in the sections below. For further description and illustration of these nominalizers, see Chapter 7.

Subject relativization Subject relativization strategies involve one of the nominalizers whose referent corresponds to the subject of the original verb: the syntactic subject with -Ùri, or the agent with -c¸er1. The former is illustrated in (318)-(319); the latter in (320)-(321)

6.2.3 Adverbs and location nouns as noun modiﬁers
A ﬁnal type of modiﬁer category in the NP consists of adverbs and locational nouns. While they are typically used where the head noun is deverbal, they can be used to modify underived nouns as well:

(329) wale n1nkakletyehitna wa hewi makloc¸ine wale n-hinkakleta-yehi-ta-na [ wa hewi makloc¸i-ne ]NP:O 3SGM 1SG-relate--VICIN-VCLPL [ REF here adolescent+FEM-PL ]
‘This I relate in the presence of the young women here.’ (Tra179) (lit. ‘the here young women’)

Locational adverbs and locational nouns are often difﬁcult to distinguish in Yine, both in their semantics and in their syntactic distribution. The functional overlap is especially clear when comparing examples like those in (330). In (330a), the noun hac¸ene is modiﬁed by the adverb wane; in (330b), by the adverb hewi and the noun Diamante.

(330) a. wane yoptotyaw1na wane hac¸ene

wane Ø-yoptota-ya-w1-na

[ wane

hac¸e-ne ]NP:VS

[ Diamante hac¸e-ne ]NP(O) [ NAME dweller-PL ]

‘We called out repeatedly to the people who live here, who live in Diamante.’ (lit. the here dwellers, Diamante dwellers) (HwS49)

Temporal adverbs, which offer aspectual information about the head noun, are most suited to deverbal heads (as in (331), (332)), but are (infrequently) attested with underived nouns as well (e.g. (333)).

(331) n1mnikna wa w1molene wa hac¸eryako hiSpakaÙine

n-him-nika-na

[ wa w-himole-ne ]NP:O

1SG-ASSOC-eat-3PL [ REF 1PL-kin-PL ]

[ wa hac¸erya-ko hiSpaka-Ùine ]NP(O) [ REF recently-EMPH exit-SUBJ.NOM+PL ]

‘I ate with our kinspeople, the recently converted.’ (HwS18)

[ wa m1Ùikawa hwa-c¸e-na-ta-Ùine-ni ]NP:NVS [ REF long.ago live-FREQ-DUR-VCL-SUBJ.NOM+PLPL-AFFCT ]
‘Nothing was lacking for those who lived long ago.’ (Fie55)

[ wa m1Ùikawa pirana ]NP:O

now 1SG-relate-ANTIC-3SGM [ REF long.ago story.of ]

’Now I will tell a story of long ago.’ (Twm1)

Manner adverbs are rare in the NP and only modify deverbal nouns in my corpus. The only one that occurs with any frequency is wane, which is polysemous for a manner or location reading. Because of this polysemy, wane depends on the semantics of the original verb root (and/or other contextual information) to disambiguate between
148

its manner and location senses. Compare for example the NPs in (334), each of which is headed by a nominalization of a verb meaning ‘be’. In (334a), wane is interpreted as a manner modiﬁer because the original verb is non-locative. In (334b), on the other hand, the verb root is locative, and wane can only have its location meaning.

(334) a. wa wane hicaÙri

6.3 Headship in the Noun Phrase
While there is some debate in the literature concerning an exact deﬁnition of the term ‘head’ (e.g. Zwicky 1985, Hudson 1987, Corbett et al. 1993) the following characteristics can be identiﬁed as diagnostic of headship in the Yine NP:
(335) a. SUFFICIENCY: the head alone can be a well-formed NP b. DETERMINANT OF REFERENCE: the head determines the reference of the NP c. CONTROL OF AGREEMENT: the head is the constituent with which other elements in the NP and/or clause must agree
As the discussion below will describe, alienable and inalienable nouns exhibit different properties when it comes to NP headship: while alienable nouns always qualify as heads, inalienable nouns share many headship properties with their possessor.

149

6.3.1 Sufﬁciency
‘Sufﬁciency’ is a slight adaptation of Zwicky’s obligatoriness criterion. Strictly speaking, there is no one element that is obligatorily present in every Yine NP, not even the noun (cf. §6.4 below). A more useful question is whether a given noun is sufﬁcient; that is, can a well-formed NP consist only of that noun? This better captures a crucial difference between alienable and inalienable nouns: the former are ‘sufﬁcient’; the latter are not.
An alienable noun root can, alone, constitute a well-formed NP as illustrated in (336).

(336) wane hima rica Sikene

wane hima r-hica

[ Sikene ]NP:NVS

there/thus QUOT 3SGM-be/do [ toucan ]

‘This is what the toucan did, reportedly.’ (Tuc3)

An inalienable noun root, on the other hand, is not sufﬁcient: it cannot occur in an NP without its possessor:

(337) a. sat1 panÙi moletatkal1na kolha sahi

sat1

pan-Ùi

moleta-tka-l1-na

SPEC+MASC house-UNPSSD group-PFV-3SGM-3PL

[ kolha sahi ]NP:O [ rubber ball.of ]

‘They gathered the balls of rubber into a house’ (137)

b. *sat1 panÙi moletatkal1na [ sahi ]

6.3.2 Determinant of reference
It is a property of NP heads that they determine the reference of the phrase as a whole. We encountered this criterion earlier, in §6.2.2.1, where we applied it in order to distinguish s1co as a classifying modiﬁer (in (307)) from s1co as the NP head (in (300)). In terms of determining reference, alienable and inalienable nouns essentially behave
150

the same way: both control the reference of the phrase containing them, and therefore both qualify as heads:

(338) renekanro r1r1 sawlite

r-heneka-na-lo

[ r-hir1

sawli-te ]NP:E

3-give-CMPV-3SGF [ 3-father.of machete-PSSD ]

‘He gave her his father’s machete.’

(339) sana sp1ta r1mkiya c¸ema [ sana sp1ta ]NP:O r-himka-ya c¸ema [ swidden lip.of ] 3-sleep-APPL tapir
‘The tapir was sleeping on the edge of the swidden.’ (Shj4)

6.3.3 Agreement
Within the NP, demonstratives, modiﬁers, and certain quantiﬁers (see §3) mark gender and (in some cases) number agreement with the head noun. If the NP is a core argument, the head is also indexed on the predicate (under the right distributional conditions: see §3.2.2).3
Alienable nouns always control agreement in the NP:

(340) a. tye sotl1

tye

sotl1

PROX.SGM rock

‘this rock’

b. *tw1 sotl1

tw1

sotl1

PROX.SGF rock

3It is always the same element that triggers agreement within the NP and is indexed on the predicate in Yine; the two domains never disagree.
151

(341) a. sato kanawa

sato

kanawa

SPEC+FEM canoe

‘a certain canoe’

b. *sat1 kanawa

sat1

kanawa

SPEC+MASC canoe

Agreement patterns with inalienable nouns were treated in detail in Chapter 5, where it was shown how the ability of an inalienable root (rather than its possessor) to corefer with pronominal indexing varies depending on its semantic type: kinship terms and owned objects always do, parts of wholes (including body parts) optionally do, and classiﬁcatory nouns never do; and where the inalienable root does not control agreement, it is its possessor that does.
Here again, then, we ﬁnd that while alienable nouns fully qualify as heads, only some inalienable nouns do; the rest either share the property with their possessors (as with part nouns) or hand it over to them completely (classiﬁcatory nouns).

6.3.4 Summary
Taken together, the above criteria indicate a continuum of headship among Yine nouns, summarized in Table 6.3. Alienable nouns fully qualify as heads, satisfying all three criteria. Inalienable nouns on the whole fail to satisfy the sufﬁciency criterion, and are divided with respect to the rest: kinship terms and inalienably possessed objects control both reference and agreement; part nouns control reference but either they or their possessor may control agreement; and classiﬁcatory nouns control reference but their possessor controls agreement.

6.4 NPs with no noun

NPs with no overt noun are very common in Yine discourse. Any of the constituents4 in Table 6.1 above can potentially be the sole overt element in a given NP, though the article wa can do so only under certain conditions as described below (see §3 for further discussion). Representative examples of nounless NPs are provided in (342)-(346).

6.4.1 Article-only NPs
As described in §3.1, the referential article wa can be anaphoric, capable of maintaining the pragmatically active status of a participant in the event. The NP in (342) above, for instance, appears in the following context:

(347) wane rica hiylaletlo wa Sima. wa nikanro wa p1tsot1

[ wane r-hica hiyla-le-ta-lo

[ wa Simai ]NP:O ]CL

[ there/thus 3-be/do kill-SUBD-VCL3SGF [ REF ﬁsh ] ]

[ [ wai ]NP:O Ø-nika-na-loi

[ wa p1tsot1 ]NP:VS ]CL

[ [ REF ] 3-eat-CMPV-3SGM [ REF electric.eel ] ]

‘Thus it kills the ﬁsh. This the electric eel eats.’ (Pts74)

Without the appropriate context, NPs consisting only of wa are ungrammatical. This restriction is not found with any other NP constituents.

6.4.2 Elided noun or nominalized head?
With NPs that have no overt lexical nominal, the question arises whether they are headed by an unrealized, elided noun, or whether one of the overt NP constituents is nominalized and functions as the head. This question is particularly relevant here because of the nominalizing properties of gender and number agreement (cf. §7.1). Where the sole member of an NP is an element that does not encode number or gender (e.g. the article or the quantiﬁer hico ‘much’), the NP in question must be headed by an elided noun, but where it is a quantiﬁer, demonstrative or modiﬁer that does bear gender/number morphology (e.g. the article sat1 ‘SPEC+MASC’ or the quantiﬁer pec¸n1 ‘every’), the analysis is not so straightforward. These could either involve an elided noun or a functional NP head. Here, I adopt the latter analysis because it is
154

simpler. Given the high frequency of NPs consisting only of a gender/number marked constituent, and given that gender/number morphology is productively nominalizing, positing a null head for each such NP introduces a level of complexity that is not independently required. Furthermore, it fails to capture the prominence that nominalization plays in the grammar of Yine.

6.5 Discontinuous NPs

It is not unusual to encounter examples like (348) in Yine discourse, where what is apparently a single NP is split over two clausal positions. Note that the examples presented here consist of a single intonation phrase.

(348) mapa nkamr1ta kaSri [ mapa ] n-kamr1ta [ kaSri ] [ three ] 1SG-make [ arrow ] ‘I make three arrows. (b97)
The example in (349) is another potential candidate for a split NP.

(349) satopc¸e hima hicetatka s1co

[ sato-pc¸e ]

hima hiceta-tka

[ SPEC+FEM-RESTR ] QUOT remain-PFV

[ s1co ] [ woman ]

‘Only one woman remained, reportedly.’ (TsN55)

However, because of two facts about the language it is not entirely clear that examples like these are true discontinuous NPs. First, it is very common for two or more juxtaposed NPs to co-occur within a clause, all coreferential and expressing elaborations or afterthoughts. And second, as we saw in the previous section, nearly all NP constituents can appear in the NP without an overt head. This leaves us with two possible analyses of (348): (350a), a discontinuous NP; or (350b), two juxtaposed NPs with the predicate intervening between them.
155

(350) a. [ mapa ]NP.O nkamr1ta [ kaSri ]NP.O’ i.e. ‘three I made arrows’
b. [ mapa Ø ]NP.O nkamr1ta [ kaSri ]NP.(O) i.e. ‘three (things) I made, arrows’
It is quite possible that both of these structures are available options, and I am uncertain how to distinguish between them (if it is even necessary to do so). For the moment, the question of whether true discontinous NPs are attested in Yine remains an open one.5

6.6 Possessive NPs

When a noun is possessed, the possessor can be expressed either via a pronominal preﬁx or by an independent noun phrase.

(351)

sawli ‘machete’ n-sawli-te ‘my machete hita sawli-te ‘my machete pimri-ne sawli-te [other-PL machete-PSSD] ‘others’ machete

(352) mec¸i ‘feather of’ t-mec¸i ‘her feather’ pakÙa mec¸i ‘hawk’s feather’
The morphology of possession is treated in Chapter 5; here, I will focus on NPs with an independent possessor in order to better illustrate the structure of possessive NPs. This discussion applies to both alienable and inalienable nouns.
Word order in the possessive NP is ﬁxed, with the possessor preceding the possessed noun (353).
5In LaPolla and Poa (2008), similar constructions in Chinese are analysed as NPs that have been split for pragmatic reasons, where one part of the NP is in focus and therefore precedes the verb while the other part is topical and follows the verb. A pragmatics-driven analysis like this – which favours the structure in (350b) – is worth pursuing for Yine in light of the evidence that relative prominence is central to the ordering of elements both in the NP and the clause.
156

(353) a. wala motorote wala motoro-te 3SGF motorised.boat-PSSD
‘her motorised canoe’
b. *motorote wala

The two elements are also strictly adjacent:

(354) a. *pica tsr1 motorote

pica tsr1

motoro-te

2SG big+MASC motorised.boat-PSSD

(intended: your big motorized canoe)

b. pica motorote tsr1; tsr1 pica motorote ‘your big motorized canoe’

In fact, possessive NPs rarely consist of more than the possessor and possessum, especially when the possessor is an independent word. When there is another constituent, it is usually just the article, as in (355):

Constructions like (356), with a numeral and independent possessor, are somewhat marginal,6 and are strongly dispreferred to paraphrases, like those in (356b) and (356c), that either code the possessor morphologically or distribute the possessor and other constituents over more than one NP. The extent to which this observation can be generalized to NP constituents other than numerals remains to be determined.

6The marginality is intensiﬁed to unacceptability if the order of the numeral and pronoun are reversed such that the numeral intervenes between the possessor and possessum. This indicates that the misordering the two elements is not the source of the marginality in (356).

6.7 Noun Phrase Sufﬁxes
There are a few bound morphemes that are attested only on NP constituents in my corpus, and, within that domain, may occur on more than one word class. The purpose of this section is to describe and exemplify these morphemes.
6.7.1 -kaka ‘distributive’
The sufﬁx -kaka is employed to express distributivity over space (e.g. (357)), kind (e.g. (358)), or individuated units of a substance (e.g. (359)).
(357) t1knokhahimatanatkal1 wa c¸iwr1sahkakni t-hiknokha-hima-ta-na-tka-l1 3SGF-throw.out-QUOT-VCL-CMPV-PFV-3SGM wa c¸iwr1sahi-kaka-ni REF ball.of.yarn-DISTR-AFFCT ‘She threw out the balls of yarn (and they were scattered).’ (Tra169)

3-ﬁnd-QUOT-VCL-3SGM-3PL REF rubber-DISTR

‘They discovered the (various units of) rubber.’ (... and formed them into spheres) (Mshk22)

Though they do not co-occur very frequently, the plural number and distributive sufﬁxes are not mutually exclusive on NP heads. This is consistent with Corbett’s (2000:115) claim that distributivity is not a number distinction, but only implies plurality by its nature.

The distributive sufﬁx is attested on nouns (e.g. hapha in (361)), adjectives (e.g. tsro in (362)), and quantiﬁers (e.g. sato in (363)). Its position reﬂects its intended scope.

6.7.2 Oblique role markers
There are three mutually exclusive nominal sufﬁxes that are obligatorily employed on oblique arguments in the clause: -yma ‘comitative, instrumental,’ -yehi ‘in the vicinity of’, and the multifunctional -ya ‘oblique’, which expresses a range of roles including location, means, source, goal, and reason.
-yma. The sufﬁx yma expresses a comitative (364)-(365) or instrumental (366) role.

-yehi. The sufﬁx -yehi marks a participant in whose immediate vicinity the situation takes place. It usually has a spatial sense (367)-(368), but can also be used with a temporal sense, as in (369).

-ya. The sufﬁx -ya marks a peripheral clause participant with a range of roles. Instrument (370) and location (371) are the most common, but source (372) and reason (373) are also attested. I have not encountered it with a benefactive or malefactive sense.

While the oblique sufﬁxes resemble postpositions in their function and semantics, there are two sources of evidence that an oblique-marked noun heads a noun phrase not a postpositional phrase: coordination and negation.
The example in (374) illustrates that an oblique-marked phrase can be conjoined to a non-oblique noun phrase using the coordinating conjunction hawa. Since coordination combines syntactically equivalent constituents, the oblique noun must likewise head a noun phrase.

(374) wane yopt1kapiranata wa sat1 makl1c¸i hawa knoc¸r1yma

wane Ø-yopt1ka-pirana-ta [ [ wa sat1

makl1c¸i ]NP

hawa [ knoc¸r1yma ]NP ]NP:VS and [ sparrowhawk-COM ] ]

‘Thus ﬁnishes the story of a certain young man and (with) the sparrowhawk.’ (Gvs27)

§12.1 describes how focusing negation on a nominal constituent requires the collocation of the negative particle hi with the article wa. This same construction is employed with oblique-marked phrases, suggesting they also are nominal:

(375) hi wa kanawayma r1s1rnatkana sino wa hahm1nayma hi wa kanawa-yma r-his1rna-tka-na NEG REF canoe-COM 3-go.upstreamtka-3PL

sino

wa hahm1na-yma

rather(Sp.) REF tree-COM

‘They didn’t go upriver in a canoe, but rather on a raft.’ (Unc58)

The oblique sufﬁxes all have a common function, are mutually exclusive, and appear in the same position in the NP, but morphologically they are a somewhat heterogeneous group. The ‘vicinity’ marker has morphological properties in common with
162

the adverbial particles (see §3.8), most notably that it can be incorporated into the verb stem (see §8.2.2). The other oblique sufﬁxes cannot do this. The general oblique sufﬁx has obvious formal and functional similarities to the applicative sufﬁx, also -ya, which is discussed in §8.2.5. They are treated as distinct, homophonous sufﬁxes here because their semantics are not identical: for example, the applicative -ya is frequently used to promote a benefactive or malefactive participant into the predicate core, but such roles are not expressed via the oblique -ya. Additionally, the applicative -ya may cooccur in a clause with an oblique-marked NP (as was the case in (375) above), but the oblique -ya cannot. Finally, the oblique marker does not trigger boundary vowel deletion (see §2.3.1), but the applicative sufﬁx does.
The oblique markers are phrasal sufﬁxes. They usually appear on the noun, but examples like (376)-(377) illustrate that they attach to the ﬁnal constituent of the NP: an adjective in (376), and the last member of a conjoined NP in (377).

‘He arrived where his mother, father, and kinspeople were.’ (Grilla.027n)

6.7.3 -pc¸e ‘restrictive’
The phrasal sufﬁx -pc¸e restricts the sense of its host to only and exactly what is explicitly said. It typically appears on a quantiﬁer (378) or quantiﬁed noun (379), but can serve to restrict the sense of non-quantiﬁed nouns as well (380)-(381).

‘That is all I (will) relate.’ (Het22)

6.7.4 -mn1 ‘in series’
The gloss of the sufﬁx -mn1, ‘in series’ is a very tentative one pending a better understanding of its semantics. In my corpus, this sufﬁx is found exclusively in the NP, usually on quantiﬁers or quantiﬁed nouns, or on the noun pn1 ‘other/far place’. It is also attested on at least one adjective (kihle- ‘good’) and the noun yine ‘people’.7
The examples in (382)-(386) provide a representative sample of -mn1 in my corpus. A typical translation of this sufﬁx was ‘all kinds of’ (todos tipos de) or ‘one after the other’. On an adjective or noun, as for example in (386)-(387), -mn1 seems to identify a particular instantiation of an abstract quality or category.
7I have not encountered -mn1 on verbs, but its translation in the Diccionario Piro, ‘gradual and transitory action, or objects passing in series’, suggests that this may be a gap in my data rather than a fact about its distribution.

7 Nominalization
This chapter presents nominalization in Yine. Nominalizations are deﬁned here as derived forms that can head an NP, as diagnosed minimally by their ability to act as a core argument of a predicate, take the article wa and/or a demonstrative, and head a nominal predicate. Other nominal properties, such as coding of gender, ability to take a nominal plural sufﬁx or possessive morphology, or to be modiﬁed with an adjective, are present in some nominalizations but not others. They are noted individually below wherever my data permits it. With deverbal nouns, the degree to which verbal properties are retained is also discussed, including the retention of verbal argument structure and taking adverbial modiﬁcation.
Several of the derived forms described below superﬁcially resemble adjectives more than they do nouns, especially those which morphologically express the gender and number of their referents. However, one diagnostic that clearly distinguishes nominal from adjectival stems is subject marking in the nonverbal predicate. As described in §9.1.2.2, 3rd person subjects are indexed on nominal predicates with the impersonal sufﬁxes -ni and -la, but on adjectival predicates with the personal sufﬁxes -l1, -lo and -na. All of the sufﬁxes described here derive stems that head a nominal, not adjectival, predicate according to this criterion.
Where a nominalizing sufﬁx encodes the gender and number of its referent, for the sake of convenience I will use the masculine singular form as citation form.
167

7.1 -l1 ‘product, object’
The sufﬁxes that mark gender and number agreement on adjectives, i.e. -l1 ‘SGM’, -lo ‘SGF’, -ne ‘PL’,1 also serve to derive a noun from an adjective or verb. On adjectival bases, their privative counterparts -t1 (masc), -to (fem) also nominalize. The derived noun corresponds to the product of the action denoted in a verbal stem, as in (388) and (389), or to an entity described by the attribute denoted in an adjectival stem, as in (390). When combined with the anticipatory sufﬁx -n1, -l1 nominalizes a predicate and the derived nominal corresponds to the object of the original predicate; see for example (391) and (393) below.
(388) a. haman1ta ‘be tired’ hamanr1 ‘fatigue’
b. yayica ‘be ill’ yayicl1 ‘illness’
c. hamha ‘disappear, be late’ hamhal1 ‘loss, delay’
d. halna ‘ﬂy’ halnal1 ‘ﬂight’
(389) a. halica ‘believe’ halicl1 ‘belief’
b. hal1ka ‘want, desire’ hal1kl1 ‘need, greeting’
c. c¸irha ‘to harvest (tr.)’ c¸irhal1 ‘(a) harvest, crop’
(390) a. kata- ‘luminous’ katalo ‘light, a lamp’
b. sero- ‘red’ serolo ‘something (fem) red; a ripe plantain’
c. pos1- ‘rotten’ pos1r1 ‘something (masc.) rotten’
1Plus their phonologically conditioned allmorphs: -r1 (SGM), -ro (SGF); see §2.3.4.
168

d. mtser1- ‘narrow’ mtser1t1 ‘someone/thing (masc.) thin’
Object nominalizations are obligatorily marked with the anticipatory sufﬁx -n1, and thus are often superﬁcially indistinguishable from a verbal predicate. Compare the nominalization in (391a) with the verbal predicate in (391b).
(391) a. wnikanr1 w-nika-n1-l1 1PL-eat-ANTIC-SGM ‘our food’
b. wnikanr1 w-nika-n1-l1 1PL-eat-ANTIC-3SGM ‘we will eat it’
They differ, however, in that clause-level mood/aspect morphology appears after the nominalizing sufﬁx on the derivation, but before the object indexing sufﬁx on the predicate, as illustrated with -tka ‘-PFV’ in (392a) vs. (392b).
(392) a. wnikanr1tka w-nika-n1-l1-tka 1PL-eat-ANTIC-SGM-PFV ‘our food (now)’
b. wnikan1tkal1 w-nika-n1-tka-l1 1PL-eat-ANTIC-PFV-3SGM ‘we will eat it now’
Also unlike verbal predicates, -l1 nominalizations can be pluralized with the nominal plural sufﬁx -ne as in (393) and (394) and function as arguments of the predicate (394), (395).
(393) r1nkac¸etan1nenatka wa r-hinka-c¸e-ta-n1-ne-na-tka REF 3-shoot-FREQ-VCL-ANTIC-PL-CMPV-PFV ‘the ones they had kept shooting’ (Mshk67)

Product nominalizations may be possessed, in which case they take the -e allomorph of the possessed sufﬁx.

(396) nyayicle ‘my illness’ namanre ‘my fatigue’ nal1kle ‘my esteem (for someone/thing)’
Object nominalizations, however, retain the transitivity of the source verb. The underlying subject is indexed with a pronominal preﬁx, and the nominalization itself corresponds to the underlying object.

7.2 -Ùri ‘subject’
The sufﬁx -Ùri is only deverbal and does not nominalize adjectives, adverbs, or other nouns. It derives a noun whose referent corresponds to the grammatical subject of the original verb. These subject nominalizations formally distinguish gender and number: -Ùri ‘masculine singular’, -Ùro ‘feminine singular’, -Ùine ‘plural’. They cannot take a pronominal preﬁx nor be possessed, and often function as modiﬁers in the NP. These properties make -Ùri nominalizations very similar to adjectives; however, they pattern as nouns, not adjectives, when they head a predicate. Digression: Before going on to the description of the subject nominalizer, a note on its form is in order. It bears an obvious resemblence to certain allomorphs of the agreement/product nominalizing sufﬁxes, and there are regular morphophonological rules in the language that can predict their surface forms from an underlying ÙV-l1 concatenation. For reasons of space, I will not provide the details here, but see §2.3 regarding the morphophonological processes active in the language. An important detail, however, is that the V in question must be i, so the putative bimorphemic action nominalizer would be Ùi-l1. The primary reason I have not analysed it this way here
2The closest way to render these nominalizations in English is with a relative clause or cleft, but it is important to note that such a translation does not accurately reﬂect the Yine construction.
171

is that to date I lack independent evidence of an appropriate -Ùi morpheme. There are two sufﬁxes with this form: the attenuative sufﬁx used to mark politeness (cf. §12.5.4) and the sufﬁx marking unpossessed status on inalienable nouns (cf. §5.2.2.1), but neither of them is an obvious candidate for the subject nominalizer. Analysing -Ùri as bimorphemic, then, would essentially amount to inventing a new morpheme solely for the purpose of having a tidy story for the similarity between the action nominalizer and the gender/number agreement / nominalizing sufﬁx -l1. To avoid doing that, I treat Ùri as monomorphemic. I do so tentatively, however, and the question of whether Ùri is synchronically complex remains open.3
Now to return to the discussion at hand. Simple examples of -Ùri nominalizations are provided in (400)-(402). As these examples illustrate, -Ùri nominalizations are not necessarily agentive but always correspond to the grammatical subject of the source verb.

(400)

haml1ta ‘smell’ haml1taÙri ‘one (masc.) who smells, catches scent’ haml1taÙro ‘one (fem.) who smells, catches scent’ haml1taÙine ‘ones who smell, catch scent’

(401)

yayica ‘be ill’ yayicaÙri ‘one (masc.) who is ill’ yayicaÙro ‘one (fem.) who is ill’ yayicaÙine ‘ones who are ill’

(402)

kamr1ta ‘do, make’ kamr1taÙri ‘one (masc.) who is doing, making’ kamr1taÙro ‘one (fem.) who is doing, making’ kamr1taÙine ‘ones who are doing, making’

3As will become apparent throughout this chapter, -Ùri is not the only nominalizer that invites a compositional analysis. Others are -c¸er1 (cf. -c¸e ‘-FREQ’); -l1r1, and -inri (cf. -ini ‘-TEMP’). I treat all of these as monomorphemic as well, partly to keep the analysis consistent across all sufﬁxes in question, and partly because their semantics are not always transparent; but the analysis is tentative for them as well.
172

The examples in (403)-(404) illustrate that -Ùri nominalizations can head NPs, taking a demonstrative (404) or article (404), and may function as a verbal argument.
(403) wane tÙiyahhimanatatka wala p1rataÙro wane t-Ùiyaha-hima-na-ta-tka there/thus 3SGF-cry-QUOT-DUR-VCL-PFV [ wala p1rata-Ùro ]NP:VS [ 3SGF raise.domestic.animal-SUBJ.NOM+FSG ] ‘The one who was raising animals was crying.’ (MyI93)

Subject nominalizations retain the argument structure of the corresponding verb. The nominalization itself corresponds to the subject; the corresponding O and/or E argument appears in one of the modiﬁer positions (i.e. immediately before or after the nominalization, cf. §6.1).
As (405) illustrates, the nominalizer attaches to the verb stem (rather than the root), which may have its own internal morphology. In this case, the verb powrata ‘to clean’ is causativized ﬁrst and then nominalized.
(405) pokÙi koca powratc¸icaÙri pokÙi koca powrata-c¸ica-Ùri village ADD clean-MAND-SUBJ.NOM+MSG ‘He was also one who ordered clean the village.’ (BfM61)
Example (411) below illustrates an adverbial modiﬁer (teno ‘high, deep’) of the nominalization hwaÙro ‘one (fem) who is, does.’ Another is provided in (406), where the locational noun hitokha ‘underwater’ modiﬁes yapaÙro ‘one (fem) who travels.’

(407) wa hac¸eryako hiSpakaÙine wa hac¸erya-ko hiSpaka-Ùine REF recently-EMPH leave-SUBJ.NOM+PL ‘those who had just recently left’ (Hws17)
In (408), the noun koya is the notional direct object of the -Ùri nominalization; similarly with konac¸i in (409).

The examples in (410)-(411) illustrate that a subject nominalization can head a nominal predicate. (411) also illustrates that a 3rd person subject is indexed with an impersonal sufﬁx (411).

Subject nominalizations are frequently used to modify other nouns; in this way they often function as subject relativization strategies (see §6.2.2.2 for examples and discussion).

7.3 -c¸er1 ‘agent’

The sufﬁx -c¸er1 derives a noun corresponding to the agent of the corresponding verb. While -Ùri expresses a grammatical role, -c¸er1 expresses a semantic one: a -c¸er1 nominal is always agentive and only attaches to transitive verbs. Some examples of agentive nominalizations are provided in (412)-(414) below. These nominalizations distinguish the gender or number of the referent through the form of the sufﬁx.4

(412)

kasp1ka ‘let go of’ kasp1kc¸er1 ‘releaser (masc)’ kasp1kc¸ero ‘releaser (fem)’ kasp1kc¸ene ‘releasers’

(413)

kamp1ka ‘hold (someone) in one’s arms’ kamp1kc¸er1 ‘godfather’ kamp1kc¸ero ‘godmother’ kamp1kc¸ene ‘godparents’

(414)

hanika ‘carry (tr.)’ hanikc¸er1 ‘one (masc.) who carries (someone) off’ hanikc¸ero ‘one (fem.) who carries (someone) off’ hanikc¸ene ‘ones who carry (someone) off’

4As with -Ùri, the form of the agent nominalizer is suggestive of a compositional origin. In this case, the internal aspect sufﬁx c¸e ‘frequentative’ plus the gender/number sufﬁx is an obvious candidate. However, this is not a frequentative nominalization; for example, while kasp1kc¸er1 may be paraphrased as ‘one who frequently releases (someone)’, it could just as easily refer to one who released someone just once. If there is a compositional source, then, the idiosyncratic semantics strongly suggest that it is not synchronic.

175

Agent nominalizations retain the transitivity of their verbal root, and (unlike -Ùri nominalizations) can morphologically express their notional object through bound pronominal afﬁxes. However, this is done quite differently from how it is on verbs. On verbs, the subject is indexed with a preﬁx and the object with a sufﬁx. On agent nominalizations, the referent indexed in the pronominal preﬁx corresponds to the object of the underived verb.
(415) a. tanikl1 t-hanika-l1 3SGF-carry-3SGM ‘She carries him’
b. ranikc¸ero r-hanika-c¸ero 3-carry-AG.NOM+FEM ‘she who carries him (somewhere); his carrier’

Agent nominalizations may head a noun phrase and function as a core argument in the clause, as illustrated in (418) and (419). Their semantic role in the clause is independent of their own semantics; that is, they may but need not ﬁll an agentive role in the event. In (418), for example, the -c¸er1 nominalization is the subject of a
176

transitive verb and is agentive; but in (419) it is not agentive. Rather, it is the subject of a nonverbal equational clause headed by the demonstrative nyi.

‘The ones who will kill us (our coming killers) are these.’ (Mshk51)

7.4 -l1r1 ‘passive subject’
The sufﬁx -l1r1 attaches to a passivized verb stem to derive a nominal whose referent corresponds to the passive subject, i.e. the erstwhile O, of the original verb. Like other participant nominalizations, it marks gender and number: -l1r1 ‘masculine singular’, -l1ro ‘feminine singular’, -l1ne ‘plural’. Masculine gender is most common; as the functionally unmarked gender it is used for most object referents (but not all, as (422) below illustrates).
(420) nika ‘eat’ nikka ‘eaten’ nikkal1r1 ‘food, provisions’
(421) hal1ka ‘want’ hal1kka ‘wanted, desired’ hal1kkal1r1 ‘necessity’
177

In (422), the nominalized verb has applicative morphology as well as passive. Here, the applicative promotes an instrument role to O; this promoted O, after passivization, is the referent of the -l1r1 nominalization.

(422) a. yanhatya yana-ha-ta-ya go-liquid.of-VCL-APPL ‘go by water using (something)’
b. yanhatikal1ro yana-ha-ta-ya-ka-l1ro go-liquid.of-VCL-APPL-PASS-PSUBJ.NOM+FEM ‘gasoline’ (something used for water travel)’
Examples (423)-(424) illustrate how a -l1r1 nominalization may head a core argu-
ment NP. In (423) it is the grammatical subject of the verb nikawna.

In (424) the patient nominalization functions as the object of the verb hira ‘drink’; it happens to be a cognate object here, but this is not a grammatical requirement.

The patient nominalization is very frequently used with the verb Ùina ‘say’ when identifying a name or appellation.5 This is illustrated in (425)-(426).

5With speech act verbs, the addressee, not the reported speech (or name), is the grammatical object.

7.5 -pi ‘instrument’
The sufﬁx -pi derives instrument nominals from verbs; that is, their referent is something used to carry out the action denoted by the verb. Some typical examples of -pi nominalizations are provided in (427) below.
(427) a. nika ‘eat’ nikapi ‘eating utensil’
b. c¸itota ‘dig’ c¸itopi ‘shovel’
c. kowÙohata ‘ﬁsh (with hook and line)’ kowÙohapi ‘ﬁshing gear’
d. t1plata ‘sit down’ t1plapi ‘bench, seat’
The instrumental semantics may be idiosyncratic.
(428) a. hanihata ‘obscure the eyes/vision’ hanihapi ‘mirror’
b. nikloka ‘swallow’ niklokapi ‘esophagus’
179

(429) a. nika ‘eat’
b. nikyapi nika-ya-pi eat-APPL-INSTR.NOM ‘gum(s)’
The nominalizing sufﬁx does not itself code gender; rather instrument nominalizations have lexically assigned grammatical gender like alienable nouns: e.g. c¸itopi ‘shovel’ (masculine); hanihapi ‘mirror’ (feminine).
Nouns derived with -pi are possessable (430), (431) and pluralizable with the nominal plural sufﬁx -ne (432).

They also take determiners and can serve as a core argument in the clause as in (433).

7.6 -n1 ‘property’
The sufﬁx -n1 derives an abstract noun that names a property, quality, or product related to the root lexeme; it may be used on adverbs (434), adjectives (435) and verbs (436), and is used to derive the possessive pronouns (437). Property nominalizations have masculine gender (the functionally unmarked gender in Yine), and are not pluralizable.
(434) a. teno ‘high, deep’ tenn1 ‘height, depth’
b. teyaknan1 ‘agile’ teyaknann1 ‘speed’
(435) a. sero- ‘red’ sern1 ‘color’
b. poniko ‘ﬂavourful’ ponikn1 ‘ﬂavour, taste’
(436) yoÙihata ‘dazzle’ yoÙihn1 ‘glory’
(437) hita ‘I’ hitan1 ‘mine’
Two of the most frequently used -n1 derivations have very idiosyncratic semantics:
(438) Ùina ‘say’ Ùinan1 ‘saying; reason, sake, blame’ 181

(439) hica ‘be, do’ hican1 ‘thing’
Property nominalizations do not take a possessed sufﬁx when possessed, only a preﬁx, and at least some take the unpossessed sufﬁx -Ùi in citation form. That is, they behave like derived inalienable nouns.
(440) tenn1Ùi ‘height, depth’ ntenn1 ‘my height’
(441) yoÙihn1Ùi ‘glory’ nyoÙihn1 ‘my glory’
7.7 -waka ‘location/manner’
The sufﬁx -waka derives both location and manner nominals from verbs and adverbs; typical examples are given in (442)-(446). In nearly every example in my corpus, including both location and manner nominalizations, -waka is accompanied by the applicative sufﬁx -ya. Words like yopc¸ewaka ‘port’ (442b) and tenowaka ‘high/deep place’ (444b) indicate that -ya is not an obligatory component of this nominalization, but I do not understand its role well enough to offer further comment here.
Examples (442)-(444) illustrate location derivations.
(442) a. yopika ‘descend’ b. yopc¸ewaka yopi-c¸e-waka descend-FREQ-LOC.NOM ‘port’
182

(444) teno ‘high, deep’ tenowaka ‘deep or high place’
Examples (442)-(444) illustrate manner derivations.
(445) a. hica ‘be, do’ b. hicc¸etyawaka hica-c¸e-ta-ya-waka be/do-FREQ-VCL-APPL-LOC.NOM ‘custom’
(446) a. hamha ‘be lost’ b. hamhikowaka hamha-ya-ko-waka be.lost-APPL-ANTIC.PASS-LOC.NOM ‘perdition’
In addition to being able to take an article and function as arguments, location/manner nominalizations may be possessed. As noted in §5.2.2.2, they take the -le allomorph of the possessed sufﬁx.
(447) t1wlac¸etikowakle t-hiwla-c¸e-ta-ya-ko-waka-le 3SGF-cook-FREQ-VCL-APPL-ANTIC.PASS-LOC.NOM-PSSD ‘her kitchen’
Deverbal -waka nominalizations retain the transitivity of the original verb. With transitive nominalizations, the entity indexed in the pronominal preﬁx corresponds to
183

the verbal subject, and the pronominal sufﬁx corresponds to the object. The nominalization itself corresponds to a locative argument which is treated as an extension to the core (cf. §10.1.3).

‘They went to see the place where he was, the place where he had been making his ﬁre.’ (Tra172)

In (449), the nominalization is derived from a passivized verb. The referent indexed in the pronominal preﬁx corresponds to the passive subject of the verb base.

Given their semantics, it is not surprising that -waka nominalizations have adverbial properties and are frequently used as location or manner modiﬁers. The manner nominalization in (450) is somewhat difﬁcult to paraphrase in English; it is comparable to ‘there exists for us (i.e. we have) our food that is being enough’ or more literally ‘we have our food enoughly’.

7.8 -men1 ‘cause’
The sufﬁx -men1 attaches to verb or adjective stems to derive a nominal that refers to something that causes the action or condition denoted by the root.
(453) a. haplita ‘vomit’ haplimen1 ‘emetic’
b. yayica ‘be ill’ yayicmen1 ‘infection’
c. haml1ta ‘smell’ haml1men1 ‘herb that makes dogs better hunters’
This sufﬁx is often used with attributive and privative adjectival stems.
(454) a. kapkakle- ‘having good aim’ kapkaklemen1 ‘that which makes one have good aim’
b. mwa- ‘not living’ mwamen1 ‘cause of dying’
185

In examples (455) and (456), -men1 nominalizations are juxtaposed with coreferential noun phrases and serve as elaborations of them, providing evidence that they are likewise NP heads.

(455) mwamen1 wa nomolenni hiylataÙro [ m-hwa-men1 ]NP [ PRIV-be(loc)-CAUS.NOM ]

hiylata-Ùro ]NP

[ REF 1SGPSSR-kin.of-PL-AFFCT kill-SUBJ.NOM+FSG ]

‘the cause of not living, my kins’ killer’ (Tra92)

In (456), there is a phrase-ﬁnal prosodic boundary after kSana, and the cause nominalization itself comprises an independent intonation unit with the same contour. This is indicative of an elaboration NP juxtaposed to the clause, rather than of a single NP with a nominalization modifying the head noun.

Cause nominalizations occur very rarely in my corpus, and there is not enough data at this point to offer a complete description of their nominal and non-nominal properties. Though it is likely, based on examples like (455) and (456) above, that they may occur alone as verbal arguments, it is not certain whether they may be possessed, and if so what morphology is used to express that, nor what type of modiﬁers they may take.

186

7.9 -inri ‘action’
The sufﬁx -inri derives a nominal that refers to the action expressed by the verb stem to which it attaches. The nominal status of the derivation is evident in that it may head a noun phrase and function as a core argument of a predicate, as illustrated in examples (457)-(458) below. However, they never head nonverbal predicates and cannot be possessed.
In (457), the inri nominalization is the object of the verb c¸ema ‘hear’, and as such is cross-referenced on the predicate with the object sufﬁx -l1.

(457) nc¸eml1 yahotkakinrina [ n-c¸ema-l1 ]PRED [ Ø-yahota-kaka-inri-na ]NP:O [ 1SG-hear-3SGM 3-ﬁght-RECIP-ACTN.NOM-3PL ]
‘I heard their ﬁghting.’ (Kno26)

In (458), there are two -inri nominals, n1yolikinri and nyinri, each heading one of the coordinated NPs that together function as the object of the transitive verb hinkakleta ‘relate, tell about’ (they are linked by the coordinator hawa ‘and’).6

(458) cani nyin1waka hinkakletanr1 n1yolikinri pirana hawa hoSa nyinri cani n-yin1waka hinkakleta-le-ta-n1-l1 now 1SG-begin relate-SUBD-VCL-ANTIC-3SGM

‘Now I will begin to tell the story of my hunting and my going into the forest’ (Caz1)

In (459), the -inri nominalization occurs with the article wa, which may only occur once in an NP (cf. §6.1). In this example, the two bracketed NPs are in apposition; the second, containing the nominalization, serves to elaborate on the infomation in the

‘This is how I found the tortoise(s), their battle.’ (Kno55)

Though an -inri nominalization may head an NP and potentially serve as an argument, it retains many verbal properties: plurality is marked with the 3PL argument sufﬁx -na; and it takes adverbial or location modiﬁers rather than adjectival ones. The argument structure of the corresponding verb is also retained. This is illustrated in example (460). Here, the reference to the anteater (s1wa) corresponds to the subject of the original verb, and the reference to the (poor/doomed) jaguars (mhenokl1nni) corresponds to its object. However, -inri nominalizations are strictly monovalent, and index only the underlying subject (in the pronominal preﬁx).

Action nominalizations play an important role in complementation in Yine. See Chapter 13 for discussion and further examples.

8 Verbs and Verb Morphology
The verb is the most heavily-inﬂected lexical category in Yine, and the most frequently occurring in my corpus. Most clauses are verbal (headed by a verbal predicate), and many consist only of a verb stem and its concomitant morphology. Nearly all of the verb-stem-internal morphology is not found on any other type of stem. A verbal predicate may be intransitive, (ambi)transitive or ditransitive and may take the full range of aspectual and modal sufﬁxes; contrast this with nonverbal predicates, which are only intransitive and take a subset of the morphology available to verbal predicates.
The verb stem and its morphology are the focus of this chapter. Verbal and other predicates, and their morphology, are discussed in Chapter 9.

8.1 The verb stem

A large number of Yine verbs contain one of several mutually exclusive formative sufﬁxes: the most common of these in my corpus are those given in (461).1 While a general meaning can often be discerned with each formative, there is also often a great deal of idiosyncracy and inconsistency as well; the glosses given in (461) and the discussion following remain tentative.

(461)

-ta ‘elsewhere stem-closure’ -ka ‘semelfactive, punctual’ -wna ‘inchoative, stative’

1To this list Matteson (1965:84) adds the following (where ‘V’indicates that the sufﬁx does not trigger vowel deletion): -Vta/-VÙa ‘stem formative’, -ha ‘cessation’, -Vwa- ‘intransitive’, -ta- ‘detailed action’ and -Vha- ‘to hunt, gather’. I do not have sufﬁcient data on these to be able to include most of them in my discussion; I have, however, re-analysed -Vwa- as an internal aspect marker, described in §8.2.3.3.
189

The formatives -ta and -ka are the most common and the most difﬁcult to deﬁne. They are often interchangeable without any change in meaning, as with the examples in (462).

(462)

haskaka, haskata (tr.) ‘bite (something), break (something) with teeth’ hiyahoka, hiyahota (tr.) ‘lower the price (of something)’ hiskaka, hiskata (intr.) ‘break, fall apart’

With other word pairs, however, -ta and -ka make a distinct contribution to the aktionsart. In (463), the -ta forms are reiterative in (463b,c) and the -ka forms are semelfactive, though this contrast does not as readily hold in (463a), but these pairs do give evidence that the formatives encode aspectual information to some extent.

(463) a. hiylaka ‘hit (someone/thing)’ hiylata ‘kill’
b. hic¸noka ‘lower the head to look’ hic¸nota ‘nod’
c. hic¸r1ka ‘fall, climb down’ hic¸r1ta ‘fall from high up, fall several times’
Verbs with the formative -wna are all intransitive often express the entrance into a new state. The minimal pairs in (464) illustrate the difference between -wna and other formatives.

(464) a. koc¸wawna ‘worry’ cf. koc¸waka ‘disturb, bother’
b. hahomawna ‘get a bit warmer’ cf. hahomaka ‘warm (something) up a bit’
c. kashric¸ewna ‘(be) change(d)’ cf. kashric¸eta ‘replace or transform’
d. salewna ‘suffer’ cf. saleta ‘harm, make suffer’
The examples in (465) illustrate the use of the formatives to derive verbs from other word classes.
190

(465) a. hicowna ‘get fat’ hico ‘much, many’ (quantiﬁer)
b. han1nrota ‘marry, take a wife’ hn1nro ‘wife of’ (kin noun)
c. hiÙkeka (intr.) ‘go silent’ poÙke- ‘silent’ (adjective)2
The stem formative has become lexicalized as part of the root in some cases but not in others. Whether it has or not becomes apparent when the stem-internal morphology described in §8.2 below is used on the verb: if the stem formative is part of the root, it will remain in the inﬂected version, as in (466)-(468).3
(466) a. tow1ta ‘command’ b. ttow1thimanan1mtl1 t-tow1ta-hima-nan1-m-ta-l1 3SGF-command-QUOT-EXTNS-NONDUR-VCL-3SGM ‘She went along ordering him’ (to kill the monkey they kept seeing) (Nwd32)
(467) a. hiylaka ‘hit’ b. t1ylakhimatl1 t-hiylaka-hima-ta-l1 3SGF-hit-QUOT-VCL-3SGM ‘She hit it, reportedly.’ (Pmm27)
(468) a. tsalewna ‘suffer’ b. tsalewnapothimatana t-salewna-pot1-hima-ta-na 3SGF-suffer-INTNS-QUOT-VCL-CMPV ‘She suffered very much, reportedly.’ (Nwd131)
2The po- in poÙke here is an adjective formative (see §4.3.2). Despite appearances, the verb and adjective in this example do share a common base.
3Note the co-occurrence of the stem-formative -ta and the stem-closing -ta in (466).
191

If, however, the formative is not part of the root, it will disappear in the inﬂected form and be replaced (following the inﬂections) with the functionally unmarked stem closure -ta (or one of the other stem closures, §8.2.4). This can be seen in the examples below:4
(469) a. hiylata ‘kill’ b. t1ylahimatanatkal1 t-hiyla-hima-ta-na-tka-l1 3SGF-kill-QUOT-VCL-CMPV-PFV-3SGM ‘She killed him, reportedly.’ (Tra57)
(470) a. himcika ‘go underwater’ b. r1mcimta r-himci-m-ta 3-go.underwater-NONDUR-VCL ‘He went under water for a little while.’
These stem formatives will appear (and disappear, at times) in many examples throughout this grammar. Unless it is relevant to the discussion at hand, I will not draw further attention to them. I will also not attempt to reﬂect detachable versus non-detachable stem closures in the morphological breakdown, as I do not have the knowledge to do so accurately and consistently. The convention I have adopted is to simply follow the surface form in each instance.
8.1.1 Complement-taking verbs
A small subset of verbs in Yine, listed in (471), can optionally take non-ﬁnite predicate complements, which are marked as subordinate with one of the sufﬁxes described in §8.2.3.2 below. The inter-clausal relations expressed with these predicates are discussed in §13.3.1, and numerous examples can be found there.
4I have not encountered any clear examples where -wna is separable from the root in this way.
192

(471)

hica ‘be, do’ hicpoko ‘do+manner (how to do)’ ya ‘go, walk, run’ heneka ‘give’ heta ‘see’ Ùina ‘say’ himata ‘know, know how’ yin1waka ‘begin’ yopt1ka ‘ﬁnish, end’ hali ‘be done with’ hama ‘be tired of’ nikawna ‘be ﬁnished’ himepe ‘repeat’ kasp1ka ‘let go of, release’ himkata ‘be able to, can’ hal1ka ‘want’

8.1.2 Transitivity
Transitivity is not a prominent feature of Yine verbs. Very few verb roots are strictly intransitive; somewhat more are strictly transitive; most are ambitransitive. See Chapter 10 for a discussion of transitivity and valency manipulation in the Yine clause.
8.2 Verb stem morphology
The verb stem is far more complex than the noun or adjective stem. In addition to a preﬁx position and ten sufﬁx positions, it can also contain incorporants representing four different non-verbal lexical categories. Strictly speaking, the root is the only obligatory element of the verbal word; however, the core arguments must also be expressed in the clause and this is usually done with the pronominal afﬁxes (see §9.1 for discussion of pronominal afﬁxes). In practice, the verb stem rarely consists of less than three morphemes and is often much longer.
The morphological structure of the verb stem is summarized in Table 8.1, and described in detail in §8.2.1-§8.2.6 below.

Table 8.1: Morphological structure of the verb stem

The relative order of post-root elements generally follows that in the above table, with incorporants appearing closest to the root and aspectual sufﬁxes following. However, there is some variability in the relative order of the incorporants, and between the incorporants and the Aspect1 and Aspect2 sufﬁxes. Sufﬁxes that belong to the same slot (row, in Table 8.1) are mutually exclusive.
Both stem-internal zones 1 and 2 require the obligatory speciﬁcation of a zone 3 (stem-closing) sufﬁx. That is, if there is an incorporant or any internal aspect or subordination sufﬁx on a verb stem, one of the sufﬁxes in zone 3 is always also used.
Note that the pronominal preﬁx appears on the predicate immediately preceding the associative preﬁx. The pronominal preﬁxes are treated in detail elsewhere in the grammar, as are the morphophonological operations that apply at their boundary with
194

the stem; see especially §3.2.1.1 and §9.1.1.
8.2.1 Associate preﬁx him-
The associate preﬁx is an applicative morpheme that introduces an ‘associate’ argument into the verb’s core argument frame: that is, one who is associated with the grammatical subject in carrying out the action denoted by the verb.5 There are several examples of this preﬁx in §10.7.2, where him-’s semantics and valency-manipulating effect are discussed. A few additional examples are given here in (474)-(476) below to illustrate what will be the focus of this section: the morphophonology of the associate preﬁx.
Like the pronominal preﬁxes (see §3.2.1.1), him- triggers a morphophonolical change when it attaches to a verb stems of a certain shape. If the stem begins with h, the associative preﬁx replaces it (472)-(473); and if the stem-initial h is followed by i, vowel mutation is also triggered such that i surfaces as 1 (474)-(475). Note that a him- derivation is just such a stem, and undergoes its own allomorphic change triggered by the pronominal preﬁx.

(473) n1merkanro n-him-herka-na-lo 1SG-ASSOC-wash-CMPV-3SGF ‘I washed with her.’
5In many Arawak languages there is a preﬁx that strongly resembles him- and is probably cognate with it: e.g. Baure i-/imo-, Ignaciano imi-/im-, and omi(n)- shared by Machiguenga, Nomatsiguenga, Caquinte, Asha´ninca, and Ashe´ninca (Wise 1990); these are described as causative or comitative preﬁxes. I use the term ‘associate’ here to distinguish him- from the comitative oblique marker -yma in Yine.

Stems beginning with a consonant other than h are not affected:
(476) n1mnikna n-him-nika-na 1SG-ASSOC-eat-3PL ‘I ate with them.’ (HwS24)
8.2.2 Stem-internal zone 1: Incorporants
The term “incorporation” is used here to refer to the combination of a non-verbal lexeme with a verb to form a new, complex verb stem. In Yine, the set of possible incorporants is somewhat eclectic, consisting of: possessed nouns (addressed shortly); evidential and adverbial particles; and one of the three oblique markers in the language (-yehi ‘in the vicinity of’). Morphologically, all of these elements are treated in the same way: the incorporant(s) appear immediately following the verb root, and the presence of an incorporant triggers the obligatory speciﬁcation of a verb-stem closing sufﬁx, usually the functionally unmarked -ta. The resulting stem takes all the normal verbal morphology. The sentences below provide typical examples of noun (477)(478), oblique marker (479), and particle (480)-(481) incorporation.6
6The presence of the possessed sufﬁx in (478), and my reasons for including a sense of possession in the free translation, will be apparent shortly.

‘I readied my shotgun as I went along.’

Any noun may be incorporated in Yine, whether inalienable or alienable, referential or non-referential, provided it is in its possessed morphological form. Thus, inalienable nouns are incorporated with no additional morphology (482), but alienable nouns are incorporated with their ‘possessed’ sufﬁx obligatorily attached (483).

197

(483) nawashakanawateta n-hawasha-kanawa-te-ta 1SG-be.burnt-canoe-PSSD-VCL ‘My canoe is burnt.’ (g45)
The possessor of the incorporated noun is not expressed in the incorporant itself, but its role is obligatorily assigned within in the core argument frame of the predicate: speciﬁcally, to the subject if the predicate is intransitive, and to the object if it is transitive.

(484) a. nkamhoparantateta n-kamho-paranta-te-ta 1SG-grate-plantain-PSSD-VCL

‘I’m grating his plantains.’ (f134)

(intr; VS = pssr) (tr; O = pssr)

Multiple incorporants are possible and quite common, but only one element of a given lexical (sub-)category may be incorporated at a time. For example, there may be one alienable and one inalienable incorporated noun (both refering to the same referent), as in (485); or a noun, oblique marker and evidential as in (486); but more than one evidential, or more than one adverbial particle, for example, cannot be incorporated into one verb stem.

198

Regarding the valency-manipulating effect of noun and oblique marker incorporation, see §10.8.
8.2.3 Stem-internal zone 2: Internal aspect and subordination
The stem-internal aspect sufﬁxes quite iconically express aspectual distinctions that concern the internal structure of the event (rather than concerning the endpoint of the whole event, as the clause-level aspect sufﬁxes do; see §9.3). These sufﬁxes are distributed over four distinct slots. All four slots may be represented in one verb, but co-members of the same slot are mutually exclusive; this is reﬂected in the structure of Table 8.1. Only one aspectual sufﬁx, -lewa, precedes the subordination markers (described in §8.2.3.2 below).
8.2.3.1 Aspect1: -lewa ‘characteristic action’
The sufﬁx -lewa indicates that the action denoted by the verb is a characteristic or occupational one for its subject. Several examples can be found in §10.6.4; another is given here in (487) for illustration.
(487) a. cani nyimaka cani n-yimaka now 1SG-teach ‘Now I am teaching.’ (Jm19)
b. cani nyimaklewata cani n-yimaka-lewa-ta now 1SG-teach-CHAR-VCL ‘Now I teach/am a teacher.’ (Jm19)
As described in §10.6.4, -lewa may also have an antipassive function and remove the O argument of a transitive or ambitransitive verb, but it is not always detransitivizing.
199

8.2.3.2 Subordination: -le, -ko
There are two sufﬁxes used to mark the subordinate status of a predicate complement. The sufﬁx -le, which marks an active non-ﬁnite complement predicate, is illustrated in (488)-(489):
(488) nal1ka nikatletl1 n-hal1ka nikata-le-ta-l1 1SG-want ﬁnish-SUBD-VCL-3SGM ‘I want to ﬁnish.’ (c82)

(489) hi n1mkata histakatsletl1 hi n-himkata histaka-tsa-le-ta-l1 NEG 1SG-be.able.to cut-cord.of-SUBD-VCL-3SGM ‘I couldn’t cut the line.’ (Pts41)
The only time -le is not used as the subordinating sufﬁx is in the analytic passive construction (described in §10.6.1.2). In this construction, the anticipatory passive sufﬁx -ko is used in place of -le; this use of -ko can be distinguished from its use in a main clause in that here it requires the speciﬁcation of a stem-closing sufﬁx.
Both -le and -ko are illustrated in example (490): the former signals the subordination of hiyolika ‘hunt’ to yimaka ‘teach’; and the latter forms the analytic passive of hinka ‘shoot’ in the second clause.

‘They taught us to hunt, how to shoot game animals.’ (how game animals are to be shot) (BfM13)

200

8.2.3.3 Aspect2: -c¸e ‘frequentative’, -sa ‘iterative’, -wa ‘continuous’
-c¸e ‘frequentative’ The sufﬁx -c¸e indicates that the action denoted by the verb occurs frequently over a period of time. Although it often yields a habitual reading, and is consistent with Dahl’s (1985:97) characterisation of habitual aspect as a “quantiﬁcation over a set of occasions which is given explicitly or by context,” I use the term ‘frequentative’ rather than ‘habitual’ as a gloss. This choice is based on my sense that frequency, rather than habituality, is more representative of the sufﬁx’s basic meaning.
The precise interpretation of -c¸e is sensitive to the semantic properties of the individual verb on which it is used, and on the length of time involved in the event. The examples below illustrate. In (491) and (492), -c¸e has a frequentative sense; in (493) that of a continual or habitual state; and in (494) and (495) that of a habitual activity:

there/thus QUOT 3-bathe-FREQ-VCL-3PL 3PL

‘They always bathed there, reportedly.’ (d48)

In my texts, -c¸e is frequently collocated with -na ’durative’ (described in §8.2.4 below) to indicate that the action is carried out regularly over a long period of time, but this is not a grammatical requirement. See (507) below for an example of -c¸e with the non-durative sufﬁx -m.
A few examples in my data indicate that -c¸e may be reduplicated to intensify its frequentative meaning.7 This is far from common in my corpus, and only occurs in negative clauses; the clearest example is given in (496) below. It seems unlikely that it should be barred from positive-polarity clauses, but I do not yet have any direct evidence that it is possible.

‘Her mother never, ever saw her.’ (Tsm7)

-sa ‘iterative’ The sufﬁx -sa is used to express iterativity, indicating that the action itself is characterized by repetition. The difference between the iterative and frequentative markings is one of density or degree: -sa is used when the action denoted by the verb is done with an unusually or unexpectedly high frequency within a relatively short period of time.

‘I gave them children’s clothes . . . and I distributed soap to them also.’ (HwS27)

-wa ‘continuous’ This is the least common of the internal aspect sufﬁxes in my corpus. It is used with events (either states or activities) that are ongoing and span the reference time.8 Examples of the continuous marker are given in (499)-(502).

‘He is bleeding.’ (DP)

(502) nÙinowatana n-Ùino-wa-ta-na 1SG-hurt-CONTIN-VCL-CMPV ‘I was in (a state of) pain.’ (Per8)
8However, the event may or may not be ongoing at the time of utterance; as with the other internal aspect markers, -wa does not provide information about the endpoint of the event or indicate that the event is incomplete. The sentence in (502) illustrates this with the co-occurrence of the continuous and completive sufﬁxes in the same predicate. To indicate that an event is ongoing at the time of utterance, the homophonous external aspect sufﬁx -wa ‘imperfective’ is used (§9.3).
203

8.2.3.4 Aspect3: -na ‘durative’, -m ‘non-durative’
-na ‘durative’ As its gloss indicates, -na is used to express that the action denoted by the verb is durative, lasting over a (usually long) period of time. This sufﬁx neither implies nor excludes an endpoint: -na can be used when the action denoted by the verb is currently in progress, as in (503), or explicitly marked as ﬁnished, as in (504a) where completive -na and perfective -tka sufﬁxes together indicate that completion point of the event has been reached (see §9.3).

-m ‘non-durative’ The sufﬁx -m is used to indicate that an event is a short-term or temporary one. It can usually be translated as ‘for a while’ in the sense of a time span having a foreseen, relatively close endpoint; but can also be used to contribute a punctual sense to an event (506). The term ‘delimitative’ could also be used to describe -m, but I use ‘non-durative’ here to capture the fact it stands in opposition to the durative -na: the two occur in the same slot in the verb stem and are mutually exclusive. The examples below illustrate the use and meaning of -m.

Example (507) is one of the few instances in my corpus where -m rather than -na is used with the frequentative sufﬁx. This example is taken from a story about a mythological hero, who did not need to carve or build a boat. He would cut down a tree, and a canoe (kanawa (fem.)) would always come out of it (t1Spakc¸emtya) fully formed.

8.2.4 Stem zone 3: stem-closure and causation
8.2.4.1 -ta ‘verb stem closure’
As noted earlier, stem-closing morphology is obligatory when the stem-internal zones 1 and/or 2 are ﬁlled. A verb stem can be closed in two ways. The most common way is with the functionally unmarked, semantically bleached stem closing sufﬁx -ta. We have encountered -ta many times already as it appears in all of the examples in §8.2.28.2.3 above. I will not provide more examples here, but note that regardless of how many stem-internal morphemes are present, -ta only appears once (after all of them).
The causative and obligative sufﬁxes presented in the following sections also serve as stem closures (see (513), (514) and (518) for example).
8.2.4.2 Causatives: -kaka ‘causative’; -c¸ica ‘mandative’
There are two causative sufﬁxes in Yine: -kaka, used with direct or forceful causation, and -c¸ica, used with commands or indirect causation. The distinction between these is illustrated in (510)-(511); further examples can be found in the description of causatives in §10.7.1.
(510) wale yonawkakanno wale yonawa-kaka-na-no 3SGM write-CAUS-CMPV-1SG ‘He made me write’ (e.g. by moving my hand for me) (f141)
(511) wale yonawc¸icanno wale yonawa-c¸ica-na-no 3SGM write-MAND-CMPV-1SG ‘He ordered me to write.’ (f141)
The example in (512) indicates that -kaka and -c¸ica are not mutually exclusive but may co-occur in the order given in Table 8.1 above. Such co-occurrence is extremely rare in my corpus and its effects are not well understood.9
9Presumably, in Yine as in other languages that allow this there are two acts of causation involved.
206

(512) nkamr1rewkakc¸iclo n-kamr1rewa-kaka-c¸ica-lo 1SG-work-CAUS-MAND-3SGF ‘I am making her work.’
Both of the causative sufﬁxes function as stem-closing sufﬁxes. This is illustrated in (513) and (514), where the presence of an incorporated noun (-myo) requires a stem closure and the causative (rather than -ta) serves this purpose.
(513) r1stakamyokakyi r-histaka-myo-kaka-yi 3-cut-hand.of-CAUS-2SG ‘He (physically) made you cut your hand.’ (h153)
(514) r1stakamyoc¸icyi r-histaka-myo-c¸ica-yi 3-cut-hand.of-MAND-2SG ‘He ordered you to cut your hand.’ (h151)
8.2.4.3 -ha ‘obligative’
The sufﬁx -ha encodes deontic modality, expressing an obligation to carry out the action denoted in the verb. The obligation can be externally imposed or internally motivated. As indicated in the translations, it often carries the sense that there will be undesirable consequences if the action is not done.
The obligative can be used to increase the force of a command, whether the latter is imperative (515a,b) or jussive (515c) – both of which are formed using the ‘anticipatory’ sufﬁx -n1.
The translation I have for (512) is not precise enough to determine this and the question must be further explored. However, in Matteson’s (1965:81) example, addressed here in (703), each causative sufﬁx is translated as a distinct act of causation.

8.2.5 Verbal sufﬁx zone 1: -ya ‘applicative’
The sufﬁx -ya is a multifunctional applicative, serving to bring a wide range of roles into the core argument frame of the predicate, including locations, sources, instruments, beneﬁciaries, maleﬁciaries, and reasons. See §10.7.3 for a more detailed discussion of the valency manipulating effect of -ya.
(519) a. nerka n-herka 1SG-wash ‘I’m washing/doing washing.’
b. nerkiya n-herka-ya 1SG-wash-APPL ‘I’m washing somewhere/with something/for someone.’ (c146)
The association of locations with -ya is most widely represented in my corpus, and often goes beyond what is traditionally viewed as valency manipulation, as it extends to adverbial locations as well as those expressed by noun phrases.
The examples in (520) and (521) illustrate how the use of -ya with adverbs parallels that of nominal locations.
(520) a. himka ‘sleep’ b. sanasp1ta r1mkiya c¸ema [ sana-sp1ta ]NP:E:LOC r-himka-ya c¸ema [ swidden-edge.of ] 3-sleep-APPL tapir ‘The tapir was sleeping at the edge of the swidden.’ (Shj4) c. wane w1mkiyatka [ wane ]ADV:LOC w-himka-ya-tka [ there/thus ] 1PL-sleep-APPL-PFV ‘We slept there.’ (Hws37)

When used with the ambiguous location/manner adverb wane ‘there, thus’, -ya disambiguates its sense in favour of the location.
Among nonverbal predicates, -ya occurs only on adverbial predicates headed by the location/manner adverb wane, and the combination forms a possessive predicate. This is also described in §11.5.4; further examples are provided in (522)-(524).

210

8.2.6 Verbal sufﬁx zone 2: voice and mood
8.2.6.1 Voice
Yine distinguishes actual versus anticipated status in its voice morphology, both for passives and reﬂexives. All voice morphology is mutually exclusive and appears only on verbal predicates. In this section I brieﬂy illustrate this morphology; passivization and reﬂexivization are treated in §10.6, and further examples and discussion can be found there.
Passive: -ka and -ko The sufﬁx used for real/actual and for unmarked passives is -ka, illustrated in (525)-(527).
(525) a. r1c¸halo r-hic¸ha-lo 3-search.for-3SGF ‘He is searching for her.’
b. t1c¸haka t-hic¸ha-ka 3SGF-search.for-PASS ‘She is being searched for.’ (c133)

‘Our kinspeople were all killed.’ (Mshk73)

Outside its use in the analytic passive construction (see §10.6.1.2), -ko is almost unattested on verbs in my corpus. The examples in (528)-(529) were presented to my
211

consultants in an elicitation setting and conﬁrmed to be acceptable and meaningful, but I have no textual examples to present.

(529) n1ylatko n-hiylata-ko 1SG-kill-ANTIC.PASS ‘I will be killed.’ (c133)
Reﬂexive: -na...wa; -ina...wa The reﬂexive, whether actual or anticipated, is composed with discontinuous sufﬁxes. The ﬁrst part of the sufﬁx appears here in zone 4 of the verb template, and distinguishes actual (-na) versus anticipated (-ina) reﬂexives. The second part for both -na and -ina is the sufﬁx -wa, which appears in the position of the pronominal sufﬁx. This is evident from a comparison of examples like (531), where -wa follows the perfective aspect sufﬁx; with (532), where it precedes the 3PL sufﬁx (see Table 9.1 regarding the positioning of afﬁxes on the predicate).

8.2.6.2 Mood
There are two mood sufﬁxes, -ini ‘temporal’ and -n1 ‘anticipatory’, that only occur on verbal predicates. These are described here.
-ini ‘temporal (/conditional)’ The sufﬁx -ini is used with temporal and conditional subordinate clauses and marks the event on which another – the one expressed in the main clause – is contingent. Typical examples are provided in (537) and (538) below; see §13.2.2 for further discussion. It is also used in main clauses for non-assertive commands and predictions, as in (539); see also §12.5.2.

-n1 ‘anticipatory’ Yine employs the sufﬁx -n1 for anticipated events, those that are expected to occur, or did occur, at some time after the established reference time (determined in context). It is also used to express commands, and with a second person subject -n1-marked events are ambiguous over future time and imperative senses.

8.3 On the status of the “verb stem”
As many of the examples in this chapter can attest, there does not seem to be any obvious break between what I have called the verb stem and what I will treat as the predicate in the next chapter. The line that I have drawn between ‘verbal’ and ‘predicate’ morphology is motivated not by any obvious boundary in the predicate structure, but rather according to the distribution of the morphology on each side of the line. What has been addressed here is morphology that is either unique to verbal predicates, or – in the case of the incorporants – has a unique morphosyntactic treatment on verbal predicates. The large set of morphology shared between verbal and nonverbal predicate types is the focus of the predicate chapter. The extent to which the distinction between the two represents a real grammatical unit remains an open question.
215

216

9 The Predicate
Setting aside zero-predicate clauses, which have a very restricted function (see §11.5.1), the predicate is the core of the Yine clause. It determines the number of core arguments that may be expressed (see §11.5.1) and, with subject indexing, is capable of standing as a complete, independent sentence. The deﬁnition of ‘predicate’ adopted here includes the predicate head and its concomitant morphology, and does not include an independent object or any other independent words. The purpose of this chapter is to describe and exemplify the morphology of the Yine predicates.
Morphologically, predicates in Yine may be broadly categorized as verbal (headed by a verb root) or non-verbal (headed by a noun, adjective, pronoun, quantiﬁer, or adverb root). In my corpus, the majority of predicates are verbal, and verbal predicates are also typically more morphologically complex; but the most notable difference between verbal and nonverbal predicates is in how the core arguments are indexed. This is described in §9.1. §9.2-9.3 describe the morphological structure of verbal, nominal, and adverbial predicates.
The morphological structure of the Yine predicate is summarized in Table 9.1.

217

9.1 Argument indexing on the predicate

9.1.1 Pronominal preﬁxes: verbal clause subject (VS)

Unlike possessor marking on nouns, subject marking on verbs only utilizes a subset of the pronominal preﬁx classes (see §3.2.1.1): Class 1 and Class 2. These are repeated here in Table 9.2 for convenience.1

Class 1sg 2sg 3sgm 3sgf 1pl 2pl 3pl

t- w- h- r- . . . -na

2

n- p- Ø- t- w- h- Ø- . . . -na

Table 9.2: Pronominal verbal subject preﬁxes

The choice between preﬁx classes on verbal predicates is predictable based on the phonological shape of the verb stem, as outlined below. CLASS 1. Class 1 is used with verbs beginning with h, which the pronominal preﬁx replaces. If the stem-initial h is followed by i, the i mutates to 1 with all preﬁxes except 2PL (regarding which see §2.3.5).2 Representative examples are given in (544)-(545):

(544)

himka ‘to sleep’ n1mka ‘I sleep’ p1mka ‘you (sg.) sleep’ r1mka ‘he sleeps’ t1mka ‘she sleeps’

w1mka ‘we sleep’ himka ‘you (pl.) sleep’ r1mkana ‘they sleep’

(545)

hiyolika ‘to hunt’ n1yolika ‘I hunt’ p1yolika ‘you (sg.) hunt’ r1yolika ‘he hunts’ t1yolika ‘she hunts’

w1yolika ‘we hunt’ hiyolika ‘you (pl.) hunt’ r1yolikna ‘they hunt’

1As with the possessor preﬁxes on nouns, 3PL argument marking requires the sufﬁx -na to co-occur with the 3sgm (“3-”) preﬁx. With verbs, plural -na appears as the last of the predicate sufﬁxes, following the O marker (see §9.1.2).
2The replacement of a stem-initial consonant, and the vowel mutation, are unique to preﬁxes; they are not general phonological processes in the language.
218

If the verb stem begins with h followed by a vowel other than i, no vowel mutation occurs, as illustrated in (546)-(547).

(546)

hansata ‘to dance’ nansata ‘I dance’ pansata ‘you (sg.) dance’ ransata ‘he dances’ tansata ‘she dances’

wansata ‘we dance’ hansata ‘you (pl.) dance’ ransatna ‘they dance’

(547)

heta ‘to see’ neta ‘I see’ peta ‘you (sg.) see’ reta ‘he sees’ teta ‘she sees’

weta ‘we see’ heta ‘you (pl.) see’ retna ‘they see’

CLASS 2. The Class 2 series, with the null allomorph in 3 singular masculine / plural, is used with verb stems beginning with a consonant other than h;3 this is exempliﬁed in (548) and (549).

(548)

salwata ‘I walk around’ nsalwata ‘I walk around’ psalwata ‘you (sg.) walk around’ salwata ‘he walks around’ tsalwata ‘she walks around’

wsalwata ‘we walk around’ hsalwata ‘you (pl.) walk around’ salwatna ‘they walk around’

(549)

koyw1ka ‘to make manioc beer’ nkoyw1ka ‘I make manioc beer’ pkoyw1ka ‘you (sg.) make manioc beer’ koyw1ka ‘he makes manioc beer’ tkoyw1ka ‘she makes manioc beer’

wkoyw1ka ‘we . . . ’ hkoyw1ka ‘you (pl.) . . . ’ koyw1kna ‘they . . . ’

3This is true even where the stem begins with a consonant that forms a licit cluster with the r of the pronominal preﬁx as with koywuka in (549): rk is a permissable cluster (e.g. herka ‘wash’). However, there are no word-initial rC clusters in Yine, so it is possible that the difference between preﬁx classes 1 and 2 is phonologically predictable and the two could be collapsed into one series.
219

9.1.2 Pronominal sufﬁxes

The pronominal sufﬁxes are used to index the object of a transitive verb (O) or the subject of a nonverbal predicate (NVS).
The O paradigm is presented in Table 9.3. Note that the sufﬁx marking 3PL for objects is the same as it is for subjects, i.e. -na, but only subjects have the preﬁx. The 3rd singular sufﬁxes show some phonologically conditioned allomorphy; this is described in §2.3.4 but may be quickly summarized here: the r forms are used following stems that end in n, i, e, or 1 underlyingly, and the l forms are used elsewhere.

Table 9.3: Pronominal sufﬁxes: O

The sufﬁxes that index the subject of a nonverbal predicate (NVS) are presented in Table 9.4. They are identical to the O sufﬁxes except that there are two additional sufﬁxes, -ni and -la. These sufﬁxes are impersonal and fused with mood, contrasting declarative (-ni) with non-declarative (-la), and are never used on verbal predicates. On nonverbal predicates, their use depends on the word class of the predicate head. This is described in detail in §9.1.2.2 below.

Table 9.4: Pronominal sufﬁxes: NVS

Despite the large overlap between the O and NVS series – the only difference being 220

the availability of the impersonal forms – I treat them as distinct sufﬁx paradigms in this grammar. This is done primarily for descriptive purposes, in order to more efﬁciently gloss the sufﬁx in a way that reﬂects its grammatical function.

9.1.2.1 Verbal clause object (O) The examples in (550)-(551) below illustrate the O sufﬁx paradigm. In (551), the anticipatory sufﬁx -n1 is added to show the allomorphy in the 3SG forms.

retanr1 ‘He will see him/it’ retanna ‘He will see them’

retanro ‘He will see her/it’

9.1.2.2 Nonverbal clause subject (NVS)
Nonverbal predicates can be divided into four types based on the pronominal sufﬁx(es) used to index their subjects: predicates headed by nouns or nominalizations take the 1st and 2nd person sufﬁxes, but all 3rd person referents are indexed with an impersonal sufﬁx; those headed by pronouns use the impersonal sufﬁxes for all persons and numbers; those headed by adjectives take 1st and 2nd person and use the gender/numbered sufﬁxes for 3rd person, but do not take the impersonal sufﬁxes; and those headed by adverbs use all of the NVS sufﬁxes, with the gender/numbered forms used for 3rd person subjects but not for impersonal subjects.
The distribution of NVS sufﬁxes over nonverbal predicate types is summarized in Table 9.5, and examples are provided in the discussion below.4
4The classiﬁcation of -ni and -la as ‘impersonal’ is based on their usage in adverbial predicates; this

Table 9.5: Distribution of NVS sufﬁxes

On nominal predicates The term “nominal predicate” covers predicates headed by a noun or any other potential NP head (nominalized adjective, quantiﬁer, verb, or predicate). The subject paradigm is illustrated in (552) using the noun kamÙi ‘demon’; textual examples illustrating nominalizations follow in (553)-(555).

(552)

kamÙi ‘demon’ kamÙino ‘I am a demon’ kamÙiyi ‘you (sg.) are a demon’ kamÙini ‘he/she/it is a demon’

kamÙiw1 ‘we are demons’ kamÙihi ‘you (pl.) are demons’ kamÙinni [kamÙi-ne ‘demons’] ‘they are demons’

Examples (553) and (554) are headed by pluralized nominalizations. In each case, the sufﬁx -l1 nominalizes the root (adjective and quantiﬁer, respectively) and the resulting nominal is pluralized with -ne; this is all nominal morphology. The remainder of the morphology, -nitkani, belongs to the predicate and will be described later in this chapter.

On adjectival predicates The subject markers on adjectival predicates are identical to the O markers on verbal predicates: in 3rd person, the gender/number sufﬁxes are used, and -ni is not.

If, however, the predicate is headed by a nominalized adjective – an adjective root marked for gender or number agreement – the subject marking follows that of nominal predicates and in the 3rd person only -ni is used. Compare (562) with (561) above; see also (553) above.

Impersonal subjects – those that do not have a referent – are indexed with -ni. It is because -ni contrasts with -l1/-lo/-na on adverbial predicates that it is analysed as an impersonal subject marker, in spite of its use to index personal referents on nominal and pronominal predicates.

9.2 Sufﬁx zone 1: motion and mood
9.2.1 -pa ‘elative’
The sufﬁx -pa expresses movement from one location, state, or temporal setting to another. On verbal predicates, its primary senses are elative (movement away from the deictic centre) and purposive; but it may also be used to mark a particular event as belonging to a way of life that does not hold at the reference time – for example, in telling about how things used to be done in the ancestors’ time.
The elative sense is the most common in my corpus and is used as the gloss. This sense is illustrated in (570)-(572).

As is common cross-linguistically, the elative marker often has a purposive sense, indicating that the action is carried out with a particular goal in mind. This is especially common in dependent clauses, as in (573)-(574) (see also §13.2.1):

(573) netinripnawa n-heta-inri-pa-na-wa 1SG-see-ACTN.NOM-ELV-REFL-REFL
‘in order to see myself.’ (d126)

But the purposive sense is also found in independent clauses, as in (575)-(576). Note that in each of these examples, the -pa marked predicate has a close semantic relationship to the one preceding it, which has also been provided in the example. This relationship is not grammatically expressed; there is nothing about either clause that prevents it from standing as a complete, independent sentence. However, there is a prosodic link between them: a non-ﬁnal intonation contour (see §2.5), suggesting that the purposive sense of -pa is favored only in events that are in some way contingent on another (whether or not that contingency is grammatically speciﬁed).

‘We can’t guide it to get it loose from the line.’ (Pts51)

On verbal predicates, -pa is almost always used with a spatial or purposive sense in my corpus. However, there are examples where a temporal meaning is clearly intended, like those in (577)-(578). These could be viewed as involving a metaphorical movement from a past situation to the current one.

On nonverbal predicates, however, the temporal sense is well-attested; in fact, the most common function of -pa on nonverbal predicates is to express change of state, condition, quality, location, etc.

9.2.2 -ni ‘affected’
The sufﬁx -ni indicates that an argument of the verb is or will be affected in a negative way within the course of events in the discourse. Typical examples are provided in (583)-(585). The affected argument may be any core argument: it is the intransitive subject in (583), the transitive subject in (584), and the object in (585).
In (583) the doomed participant is the subject, who is alive at this stage in the narrative, but later on will help bring about his own death.

Regarding the use of this sufﬁx outside the predicate, particularly in the noun phrase where it is more frequently placed, see §9.5.
9.2.3 -na ‘completive’
Bybee et al. (1994:54) deﬁne completive aspect as expressing that an action was done ‘thoroughly and to completion.’ This sense is encoded in Yine with the sufﬁx -na. It indicates that the action or situation denoted by the verb is already ﬁnished at the reference time, or was begun with the intention of bringing it to completion, or has been carried to a natural conclusion. This sufﬁx also carries some information about the speaker’s perspective of the event, often indicating that a task was large or that a lot of effort was needed to bring the event to completion.

(593) nerkapana n-herka-pa-na 1SG-wash-ELV-CMPV ‘I went to do laundry (ﬁnally/that had been piling up/which I’ve been putting off doing).’ (c150)
Although it is often used to express that an event occurred prior to the reference time, -na is not restricted to past time. In (594), for example, completive marking cooccurs with the anticipatory sufﬁx in a command; here, it expresses how the speaker wants the addressee to look at her closely and carefully.

9.2.4 -ka ‘assertive’, -ko ‘emphatic’
The sufﬁxes -ka and -ko are epistemic markers, asserting (-ka) and emphasizing (-ko) the reality of the proposition expressed in the clause from the speaker’s perspective. Matteson (1965)6 lists these as sufﬁxes that occur, rarely, on verbs. I have not found clear examples of either of them being used on verbal predicates in my corpus, but they are both common on nonverbal predicates (see examples (600)-(604) below) and on nonpredicate elements (see §9.5).
Matteson’s examples of -ka (599a) and -ko (599b, c) on verbal predicates, adapted to the glossing conventions in this grammar but with her translations, are provided in (599); I have not yet brought these to my consultants for discussion, so cannot offer any further comment on them at this point.
(599) a. nyatkaka n-ya-tka-ka 1SG-go-PFV-ASSRT ‘I’m going now.’
b. p1yolikiniko p-hiyolika-ini-ko 2SG-hunt-TEMP-EMPH ‘Just when you go hunting.’
c. papkapinikl1 p-hapkapa-ini-ko-l1 2SG-catch.up.to-TEMP-EMPH-3SGM ‘Just when you catch him.’ (EM:74)
Note that in (599a) the epistemic sufﬁx follows the external aspect sufﬁx. On p.71 Matteson notes that the relative order of these elements “varies freely”, but more commonly occur in the opposite order (i.e. -ka/-ko before -tka). My data shows only the order that Matteson identiﬁes as more common; I do not ﬁnd any variation. This is the order I have represented in the predicate morphology template in Table 9.1. However, as all of my examples of these sufﬁxes co-occurring involve nonverbal predicates, and
6Matteson glosses -ka as ‘afﬁrmative’.
234

Matteson’s examples all involve verbal predicates, there is the possibility that the order is affected by the word class of the predicate head.’
Examples from my own corpus of -ka are provided in (600)-(602), and of -ko in (603)-(604).

9.2.5 -maka ‘frustrative’
Frustrative modality, the expression of expectancy reversal (cf. Longacre 2007:385-6), is encoded in Yine with the sufﬁx -maka. Its marking in a clause typically indicates that the event denoted in the predicate failed to achieve its intended or hoped for result, or is desired but unlikely to occur, but in some cases (see for example (613) below) it acts to express a participant’s unwillingness to take part in the event.

In (609), the speaker expresses his (seemingly impossible) wish that the tree frog he is listening to were a human woman so he could marry her. Note that in this narrative, the tree frog does in fact transform into a woman, and she does marry him; frustrative marking does not indicate that the desired thing does not happen, but rather that it is viewed by the speaker as unlikely or impossible.

9.2.6 -kta ‘generalized’
The sufﬁx -kta contributes a generalizing sense to the event, expressing that the action was done randomly, in a general, indeﬁnite, aimless or wandering manner, or with an undeﬁned or indeﬁnite object. It may also be used if the manner in which something was done is unknown or unimportant.

In (613), the bird who is subject of the verb halna ‘ﬂy’ has been pressed to stay at a friend’s much longer than she wanted to. As the day wore on, she ﬁnally just tried to ﬂy off in whatever direction (and then go home).7

The use of -kta with an indeﬁnite object is illustrated in (614). Here, the speaker is introducing an addition to a previously told story, from which something had been left out and would now be told.

‘I missed out a story of how our ancestors used to live.’ (Fst33)

Of nonverbal predicates, the generalized sufﬁx is attested in my corpus of all predicate types except adverbial ones: for example, (615) illustrates it on an adjectiveheaded predicate; (616) on one headed by a quantiﬁer; there are further examples in (617)-(619) below. However, -kta is very frequently sufﬁxed to non-predicate adverbs, and there is certainly no obvious semantic restriction against a generalized adverb, so it is very likely that its absence from adverbial predicates is due to a gap in my data that will be readily ﬁlled upon further research.

7The frustrative sufﬁx in this example does not indicate an unsuccessful attempt, but has been used throughout the narrative to underscore the participant’s general unwillingness to be in the situation.

On noverbal predicates expressing identity relationships, -kta is often used when something previously unknown is (tentatively) identiﬁed. This is illustrated in (617)(619).

8“Mashco” is a (derogatory) name that has been applied, by the Yine and by others, to several different ethnic groups in the area. In this context the speaker is referring to members of the Amarakaeri ethnic group.

9.3 Sufﬁx zone 2: External aspect
Yine has three aspectual sufﬁxes that appear immediately before the pronominal sufﬁxes in the predicate. They do not provide any information about the internal structure of the event; this is done through the internal aspect markers described in §8.2.3. Nor do they encode any information about the time at which the event occurred. They are used to indicate whether the event should be viewed as a whole unit (perfective -tka), as ongoing (imperfective -wa), or as a repetition of another action (reiterative -tnaka). These three sufﬁxes are all mutually exclusive. Because of their position near the right edge of the predicate, I call these the “external” aspect markers.
9.3.1 -tka ‘perfective’
The sufﬁx -tka is the most common of all the predicate sufﬁxes in my corpus, and the least amenable to illustration with reasonably concise examples. A complete treatment of -tka deserves a dedicated study of its own, particularly regarding its role in discourse. Although it is optional (like all aspect and mood sufﬁxes), its use in discourse is extremely frequent. In my own research, I have found that its use is consistent with the discussions of “perfective” provided in Payne (1997:239) and Timberlake (2007:292): a -tka marked event is viewed in its entirety, independently of whatever internal structure may be expressed by verbal aspect markers or implied by mood morphology. It often functions to provide a reference point for other events in the narrative, establishing the sequence of events in the absence of tense morphology, or to express that a particular event has reached its end point, at least insofar as it is relevant in the discourse.
The scene in (620) describes a sequence of events within a narrative, with -tka signalling the close of each before the next.

A common narrative device in my corpus is the collation of two (or more) grammatically complete clauses within a single intonation unit, with rising pitch at the end of each clause and the predicate in each clause marked perfective. The effect is to imply a close link between the events, similar to that of addition coordination or temporal succession, but it is independent of these and may be used along with them in a string of text, as is the case in (623). In this example, I have divided the stretch of clauses into two groups on phonological grounds: each of (623a) and (623b) constitutes a prosodic phrase. Both phrases encompass multiple clauses, and there is a non-ﬁnal prosodic boundary, marked by a high pitch that coincides with the end of each clause. This intermediate boundary is reﬂected in the Yine sentences and in the translation with a comma, while a full stop indicates the coincidence of a clausal and prosodic boundary. The speciﬁcation of -tka in this excerpt helps to divide the scene into successive actions, and it interacts with, but is independent of, other morphological and phonological devices with a similar function.

9.3.2 -wa ‘imperfective’
Imperfective aspect is expressed in Yine with the sufﬁx -wa, which indicates that the event denoted by the predicate is ongoing and/or has not come to an end.
(630) ralnawa r-halna-wa 3-ﬂy-IMPFV ‘He is still ﬂying.’ ‘He continues ﬂying.’ (c119)

(631) hi hima r1nawa mhenokl1

hi hima r-hina-wa

mhenokl1

NEG QUOT 3-come-IMPFV jaguar

‘The jaguar has not come yet, reportedly.’ (Twm19)

The use of -wa on a transitive predicate is illustrated in (632) and (633). With (632b and c), my consultant offered two ways to express the imperfectivity: ﬁrst with -wa only marked on the predicate, then with both the predicate and the direct object marked with -wa. The latter strategy focuses the scope of the imperfective marking on the object, but does not change the propositional content of the utterance.

(632) a. netawal1 n-heta-wa-l1 1SG-see-IMPFV-3SGM

On nonverbal predicates, -wa expresses an ongoing state or condition. This is rare in my corpus, but does occur in spontaneous utterances like those in (634) (both taken from a narrative).
(634) a. hi wa tsr1nenan1waw1 hi wa tsr1-ne-nan1-wa-w1 NEG REF big+MASC-PL-EXTNS-IMPFV-1PL ‘We were not yet big/grown up.’
b. mt1r1newaw1 mt1r1-ne-wa-w1 small+MASC-PL-IMPFV-1PL ‘We were still small/young.’ (BfM72)
The imperfective sufﬁx is compatible with the completive sufﬁx -na. When used together, they indicate that the event denoted in the predicate has not yet reached some externally imposed point of completion. For example, (635) may be used when the addressee is in the process of washing a load of laundry; and (636) may be used when the speaker is full but needs to keep drinking out of politeness, or when they are being pressed to do something but want to ﬁnish drinking their manioc beer ﬁrst.
(635) perkanawa p-herka-na-wa 1SG-wash-CMPV-IMPFV ‘You are still washing (your load of clothes).’ (c147)
(636) n1ranawa n-hira-na-wa 1SG-drink-CMPV-IMPFV ‘I’m still drinking (up).’ (C121A)
246

Imperfective marking is often used in negated clauses as a strategy for expressing a temporal relationship between two events; see §13.2.2.

9.3.3 -tnaka ‘reiterative’
The sufﬁx -tnaka is used when the event described by the verb has occurred previously, usually recently, in some salient context. The subject is usually the same in both occurrences, and sometimes the object referent (if the verb is transitive) is the same, but there is no grammatical requirement for any shared participants.
The excerpts in (637)-(639) provide a typical illustration of the use of -tnaka within a narrative context, and in particular serve to illustrate how this sufﬁx expresses only that the action itself had been done before, possibly but not necessarily with the same participants. These excerpts are taken from a narrative in which the speaker describes a day of hunting in the forest. He establishes, in (637a), that he has gone into the forest, then recounts how he encounters various animals as he goes along. In (637b), he has just seen a tinamou, and decides to carry on again (nyatnaka) and go further.

‘I went on again further.’ (Caz8)

A few sentences later, he ﬁnds some collared peccaries and shoots one of them (638a). The others run off; he follows them and shoots another, this time using -tnaka on hinka ‘shoot’ (638b). In this case, the real-world object referent is clearly different from the ﬁrst one he shot, but they belong to the same category, so this is not a strong illustration of how the object may be excluded from a -tnaka reiteration (for a clearer example, see (641) below).

1SG-shoot-CMPV-REIT-3SGM SPEC+MASC-AFFCT

‘I shot one again.’ (Caz23)

The examples in (639) illustrate how -tnaka may be used on a predicate with no participants in common with the previous occurrence of the action. (639a) provides the ﬁrst mention of the action in question (has1ka ‘run’); in this case the subject is the group of collared peccaries featured in (638) above. In (639b), -tnaka is used but here, the subject is now the agoutis that the narrator has since come across.

(639) a. ras1kna pimrine r-has1ka-na pimri-ne 3-run-3PL other-PL

3-run-REIT-3PL agouti-3PL in.front.of-PSSD INTNS

‘Agoutis ran right in front.’ (Caz25) (i.e. Running happened again, agoutis ran right in front.)

The previous occurrence of the -tnaka-marked action need not have been explicitly stated; it may be simply implied within the discourse. For example, the sentence in (640) is taken from a story about the narrator’s recent trip back from the Urubamba area. In this case, she is describing the third day of river travel, and uses -tnaka on the verb hitspeha ‘set out’. She hasn’t used this verb before in the narrative, but it is obvious that she must have set out on two previous mornings as well.

248

The example in (641) represents a typical use of -tnaka where the salient context is non-linguistic. It is the opening sentence of a traditional narrative told to me by a consultant who had previously (a week earlier) told me a different traditional narrative. The reiterative sufﬁx expresses that the act of storytelling had been done in the same general context, but note that in this case the object is clearly different. Here, the narrator explicitly states the name of the story and uses -tnaka on the predicate, but she had not told this particular story to me before.

9.5 Addendum: “predicate” morphology outside the predicate

The primary focus of this chapter has been to present and illustrate the morphology that appears on the Yine predicate. This has involved a rather long list of morphemes, addressed as faithfully to their observed order of occurrence as possible. However, an important characteristic they all share, which has not yet been directly addressed, is that this morphology may also appear outside the predicate without changing the propositional value of the clause. This was seen in (632) above with the imperfective sufﬁx -wa; (644)-(646) below provide further illustration with, respectively, the motion sufﬁx -pa, two modal sufﬁxes -maka and -ni, and another aspectual sufﬁx -tnaka.

The ability of this morphology to “ﬂoat” within the clause while retaining scope over the entire event suggests that they have the status of clitics rather than afﬁxes. However, a further property that they share, and one which is not typical of clitics, is that they may redundantly co-occur in the same clause, as in (647)-(648). This cooccurrence does not contribute any new meaning to the clause and it does not serve
250

as a diagnostic of a separate nonverbal clause (as the pronominal sufﬁxes do). Rather, it reﬂects the fact that the element on which it appears is under focus.

‘They heard the shotgun going off.’ (Unc.041)

The expected behavior for ﬂoating clitics is that they appear once and only once in a construction. Redundant marking of clause-level morphology within a single clause, then, is strikingly non-clitic like (cf. Dixon 2009:222). In fact, it bears a closer (but still very loose) resemblance to agreement than to ﬂoating clitics – in this case reinforcing a participant’s importance in the event rather than a constituent’s syntactic relationship to another.
It is clear that not all bound morphology in Yine is alike. Some is selective for the word class of the host (and is described in the relevant chapters); some is not but is usually located on the predicate (and is described in this chapter), or may be attached to a focused constituent in the clause (as treated in this section). What is not clear, however, is whether the “clitic” vs. ‘afﬁx” distinction is the best way to characterize the difference. In order to avoid encoding an unmotivated distinction into the analysis, then, I have opted to represent all predicate morphology as afﬁxal.

10 Transitivity and Valency Manipulation
The purpose of this chapter is to present and illustrate the Yine system for expressing grammatical relations and its mechanisms for changing the valency of the clause.
10.1 Grammatical Relations
Before entering into the discussion of grammatical relations in Yine, it is useful to set out the terminology I am using in this grammar. This terminology largely follows Dixon and Aikhenvald (2000), but has been adapted with the intention of more closely capturing the Yine system, as described in the sections below.
In Yine, four types of non-oblique argument may be identiﬁed. Three of these – verbal subject (VS), nonverbal subject (NVS), object (O) – are considered core arguments because they are indexed on the predicate; the fourth is the extended object (E), analysed as an extension to the core. A ﬁfth type of argument is the oblique argument, which requires a sufﬁx marking its oblique status. The motivations for distinguishing these types are presented in the following discussion, and summarized in Table 10.1 on page 256 below.
10.1.1 Core arguments
Core arguments are those that are cross-referenced on the predicate and express syntactically deﬁned roles (subject, object); regarding the criterion of obligatoriness for core arguments, see §10.1.4 below. Among the core arguments, it is necessary to distinguish two types of subject: those of verbal predicates and those of non-verbal predicates. With verbal predicates the subject is indexed with a pronominal preﬁx: this is true with all verbs, whether active or stative, transitive or intransitive, agentive or
253

non-agentive. With non-verbal predicates, the subject is indexed with a pronominal sufﬁx.1 The Yine subject split is brieﬂy illustrated by comparing the verbal predicates in (649) with the nonverbal predicates in (650).2

(649) a. pyayica p-yayica 2SG-be.ill
‘You are ill’
b. pas1ka p-has1ka 2SG-run
‘You run’
c. pkatno p-kata-no 2SG-bathe-1SG
‘You bathe me’

VS-... VS-... VS-...-O

(650) a. ponikno poniko-no delicious-1SG
‘I am delicious’
b. hewno hewi-no here-1SG
‘I am here’

...-NVS ...-NVS

1The non-verbal subject paradigm is almost, but not entirely, identical to the paradigm used to index the object of a transitive verb. For a full discussion of the forms, paradigms, and distribution of the pronominal afﬁxes, see §3.2.1 and §9.1.
2It is common in Arawak languages to have a system of split intransitivity; typically, the subject of an active intransitive verb is indexed in one way, e.g. with a preﬁx, but the subject of a stative verb is indexed differently, e.g. with a sufﬁx (cf. Aikhenvald 1999). Baure (South Arawak, Bolivia), like Yine, bases the split on the word class of the predicate head (Danielsen 2007), and a similar phenomenon is mentioned in Aikhenvald and Green (1998469-70). Other patterns of split-S cross-reference marking in Arawak languages are discussed in Aikhenvald (1999:97-100).
254

10.1.2 Oblique arguments
Oblique arguments (or oblique participants) are those which are optional, express oblique semantic roles (instrumental, comitative, benefactive, etc.), are not indexed on the predicate, and must have an oblique marker sufﬁxed to them. Yine’s oblique markers are described in §6.7.2; several examples can be found there. Example (651) below serves to illustrate that oblique arguments are not indexed on the predicate. If they were, the 3SGM pronominal sufﬁx should be obligatory here with the comitative noun nhan1r1yma ‘with my husband’, since the latter follows the predicate (see §10.1.4 below), but in fact it is impossible.

(651) a. napokatka nhan1r1yma n-hapoka-tka nhan1r1-yma 1SG-arrive-PFV 1SG-husband.of-COM
‘I arrived with my husband.’

b. *napokatkal1 nhan1r1yma

n-hapoka-tka-l1

n-hn1r1-yma

1SG-arrive-PFV-3SGM 1SG-husband.of-COM

10.1.3 Extended arguments
Somewhere between core and oblique status lie the “extended” (E) arguments. These are non-subject arguments that express semantic rather than syntactic roles, are neither cross-referenced on the verb nor require an oblique marker, and are not available for passivization. The role expressed by the extended (E) argument depends on the nature of the predicate head. Verbs whose semantics inherently involve a location, such as hwa ‘be in a place,’ ya ‘go’, t1nwata ‘stand’, and hapoka ‘arrive’, may take a location expression as E, as in (652). With ditransitive verbs like heneka ‘give’ and yimaka ‘teach’, the assignment of roles to O and E is sensitive to animacy and discourse prominence, with the more animate/prominent of the two functioning as O, as in (653); see also §10.4 below.

10.1.4 Expression and obligatoriness of core arguments
Core (VS, NVS, and O) arguments may be expressed in the Yine clause via pronominal afﬁxes on the predicate and/or via independent phrases. On verbal predicates, these two expressions are in semi-complementary distribution: that is, they must co-occur
256

in some situations and do not typically co-occur in others. Their co-occurrence is tied in with both predicate type and constituent order in the clause. As described in §11.3, the relative order of the predicate and its independent arguments (if any) is very ﬂuid in Yine, driven by pragmatic rather than syntactic motivations. If, in a given verbal clause, there is an independent NP argument and it precedes the predicate, pronominal indexing is optional (and pragmatically marked); in all other situations it is obligatory. On nonverbal predicates, pronominal indexing is always obligatory.
Independent NPs are never obligatory in Yine. It is very common for pronominal afﬁxes to be the only overt expression of a core argument, as in (654):
(654) n1stakyi n-histaka-yi 1SG-cut-2SG ‘I cut you.’
However, it is not the case that every core argument must always have some overt expression in the clause.
While subjects are always obligatorily expressed, the obligatoriness of non-subject arguments is more difﬁcult to establish and less reliable as a criterion for core argument status. Most Yine verbs may occur either with or without an overt object, even those verbs that have been established as strictly transitive (e.g. kata ‘bathe someone’). As long as the object’s referent is pragmatically accessible, or if its referent is unknown or irrelevant (e.g. a verb uttered in citation), it may have no overt expression in the clause without compromising the grammaticality of the utterance.
Because of this optional expression of non-subjects, I will rely on semantic information for determining whether an argument is present in the clause: if, in context, a participant is understood to be present in the event, whether or not it has any overt expression, I consider it to be part of the predicate’s valency structure. However, for purposes of exposition, in this chapter I will use examples with overt argument expression to illustrate transitivity and valency manipulation in Yine.
257

The remainder of this section provides illustrations of intransitive, transitive and ditransitive clauses.

10.2 Intransitive clauses

Intransitive predicates have a single core argument and may be verbal or nonverbal. As noted above, the subjects of each are indexed differently on the predicate.

kihle-pot1-hima-lo

[ mt1ro ]NP:NVS

good-INTNS-QUOT-3SGF [ small+FEM ]

‘The girl was very beautiful, reportedly.’ (Tso6)

For nearly all intransitive predicates, the single argument is nominal, but for at least one nonverbal predicate head, hiph1ta ‘apparently’, it is clausal.

‘It seemeed a man carried her off.’ (Kme76)

A derivationally related verb, hiph1c¸ewna ‘appear, become present’ (-wna is an inchoative stem formative, see §8.1) is used when the subject is an NP.

(658) r1ph1c¸ewna sat1 yiner1

3-appear [ SPEC+MASC people-3SGM ]

‘A certain man appeared.’ (Yam75)

258

10.2.1 Intransitive with extended argument
As noted above, some intransitive verbs may take a locational E argument; this argument may be a locational noun (659) or adverb (660).
(659) hoSa hima yac¸enatnina hoSa hima Ø-ya-c¸e-na-ta-ni-na forest QUOT 3-go-FREQ-DUR-VCL-AFFCT-3PL ‘They kept going into the forest.’ (Hmn4)

(660) hewi napokatka hewi n-hapoka-tka here 1SG-arrive-PFV ‘I arrived here.’ (Via38)
Intransitive clauses with a non-location E argument are not attested in my corpus.

10.3 Transitive clauses

Only a verb may head a transitive predicate (though it is not the case that all transitive clauses are verbal - see §11.5.4). Transitive verbs take a VS and an O argument. The VS argument can be agentive (as in (661)-(663)), but need not be (as in (664) and (665)).

(665) ret1mhahimatl1na r-het1mha-hima-ta-l1-na 3-taste-QUOT-VCL-3SGM-3PL ‘They tasted it, reportedly.’ (Shj9)
Semantically, the O argument of a transitive verb can be a patient or theme (examples (666)-(668), also (661) and (664) above3), a goal (669) or a location (as in (670)).4 Location objects are rarely cross-referenced on the predicate5 and usually have the status of extended objects (see §10.4 below).

3The O in (664) may alternatively be analysed as a recipient, another role that can be cross-referenced with the pronominal sufﬁx without the need for applicative morphology or an oblique sufﬁx.
4The O arguments in (667) and (668) are not indexed on the predicate because they precede it in the clause; they would be indexed if the order were reversed. See §3.2.2 regarding the effect of word order on argument indexing.

‘He arrived at the community of Miaria .’ (Unc63)

10.4 Ditransitive clauses
In terms of pronominal indexing, there are no ditransitive predicates in Yine since there is only one object marking position on the predicate. There are, however, ditransitive clauses with three arguments (VS and two objects) which are either explicitly mentioned or recoverable from context.
With two objects in the clause and only one O position on the predicate, a choice must be made as to which of them will be indexed as O and which will have E status. Based on the (relatively rare) examples of ditransitive clauses in my text corpus, the selection in Yine seems to follow the nominal saliency hierarchy as given in (671) (cf. Silverstein 1976), with higher animates having priority over lower animates.
(671) 1st, 2nd person > 3rd person human > 3rd person animate > inanimate
Thus, recipients and animate patients typically have O status, while inanimate patients, themes and locations have E status.
261

(672) wale yimakw1na [ wale ]NP:E Ø-yimaka-w1-na [ 3SGM ] 3-teach-1PL-3PL
‘They taught us that (ﬁshing with a line).’ (BfM14)

(Orecip, Etheme)

(673) c¸ipal1 reneknona [ c¸ipal1 ]NP:E r-heneka-no-na [ sweet.potato ] 3-give-1SG-3PL
‘They gave me sweet potatoes.’ (HwS21)

(Orecip, Epatient)

(674) hi wa hipc¸i ranikanatkal1na

(Opatient, Eloc)

hi wa [ hi-pc¸i ]NP:E

r-hanika-na-tka-l1-na

NEG REF [ 3SGMPSSR-house.of ] 3-bring-CMPV-PFV-3SGM-3PL

‘They did not bring him to his house.’ (Hmn76)

The priority of 1st person over 3rd person is evident in (675), where the 1st person patient has O status and the 3rd person recipient is the (understood) E argument.6

(675) penekhohnenatanw1! p-heneka-hohne-na-ta-na-w1 2SG-give-day-DUR-VCL-CMPV-1PL ‘You’re always giving us [to him]!’ (h26)
The E status of the animate patient in (676) is particularly evident from the fact that it follows the verb and thus qualiﬁes for obligatory cross-referencing, yet it is the animate (3PL) recipient that is indexed as O.

(676) hi hima ral1ka henekletapanna wa c¸imeka hi hima r-hal1ka heneka-le-ta-pa-na-na NEG QUOT 3-want give-SUBD-VCL-ELV-CMPV-3PL
[ wa c¸imeka ]NP:E [ REF manioc ]
‘He (the tapir) did not want to give them the manioc, reportedly.’ (Shj32)

6In this example the 3rd person referent is left unmentioned, but it is easily accessible from context: this example is taken from a story about a woman who gives her daughters, one by one, to a man who then kills and eats them.
262

Given the general relevance of discourse prominence in grammatical relations in the language, it is likely that high animacy is just one type of prominence involved, and that given the right context a lower animate may have O status, but I have not encountered clear examples where this is the case.

10.5 Ambitransitivity
Ambitransitivity is very common in Yine: the majority of intransitive verbs are able take an object (patient, recipient, theme, location) without requiring any valencyincreasing morphology. Most of the ambitransitives are S=A, where the subject of the intransitive version corresponds to the subject of the transitive version (677).
(677) a. patskotan1 p-hatskota-n1 2SG-climb-ANTIC ‘Climb up!’ (V107)
b. patskotanr1 p-hatskota-n1-l1 2SG-climb-ANTIC-3SGM ‘Climb it!’ (V107)

(678) a. tyomhata t-yomhata 3SGF-provide.food
‘She is providing food.’ (DP)

b. tyomhatl1 t-yomhata-l1 3SGF-provide.food-3SGM

(transitive)

‘She is providing food for him/providing him with food.’ (DP)

263

(679) a. wane rica wa p1tsot1 wane r-hica wa p1tsot1 there/thus 3-be/do REF electric.eel
‘This is how the electric eel is/what the electric eel does.’ (‘Thus is/does the electric eel.)’ (Pts3)

b. waneko picka ricanro wa kopac¸ni

wane-ko

picka r-hica-na-lo

wa kopac¸i-ni

there/thus-EMPH SIM 3-be/do-CMPV-3SGF REF sardine-AFFCT

‘It [the eel] does the same thing to sardines (i.e. electrocutes rather than bites).’ (Pts61)

Less common, but still well-represented, are S=O ambitransitives, where the intransitive subject corresponds to the transitive object:

(680) a. r1patha r-hipatha 3-shed
‘It sheds (e.g. its skin)’ (DP)
b. r1pathal1 r-hipatha-l1 3-shed-3SGM
‘He peels/skins it’ (DP)

(681) a. r1phota r-hiphota 3-break.crack ‘It breaks with a cracking sound. (DP)
b. r1photl1 r-hiphota-l1 3-break.crack-3SGM ‘He breaks it with a cracking sound.’ (DP)
Unsurprisingly, the intransitive and transitive versions of the same verb root may have idiosyncratic sense differences and show evidence of being independent lexemes: e.g. c¸ema ‘hear’ vs. c¸em(a)-l1 ‘hear someone/thing, obey’; hapoka ‘arrive’ vs. hapok(a)-l1 ‘arrive at, bother, have sex with’; yahota ‘try’ vs. yahot(a)-l1 ‘ﬁght with someone’.
264

10.6 Valency decreasing constructions
Yine has three types of valency decreasing construction: two passivizing sufﬁxes; two reﬂexives (both discontinuous morphemes); and one reciprocal (which is homophonous with a causative sufﬁx). All of the detransitivizers occur only on transitive verbs. The morphology employed in these constructions is described in §8.2.6.
One of the passive sufﬁxes (the ‘anticipatory’ passive) has an additional use in an analytic passive construction, as described in §10.6.1.2 below.
10.6.1 Passive
10.6.1.1 Morphological passive
Passivization removes the A argument and places the erstwhile O in subject position. I have no spontaneous examples where the underlying A of a passive verb appears
in the clause as an oblique participant. My own composed sentences containing a passive verb and an oblique-marked NP were not accepted as well-formed, but were noted as something that second-language learners of Yine might say.
Some simple examples of the unmarked/real passive (682b) and the anticipated passive (682c) are given below, and a textual example is provided in (683). Further examples can be found in §8.2.6.1.
(682) a. n1ylatl1 n-hiylata-l1 1SG-kill-3SGM ‘I kill(ed) him.’
b. r1ylatka r-hiylata-ka 3-kill-PASS ‘He was killed.’
c. r1ylatko r-hiylata-ko 3-kill-ANTIC.PASS ‘He will be killed.’
265

(683) a. pa kata netl1 hita p1tsot1

pa kata n-heta-l1

hita p1tsot1

wa p1tsot1 REF electric.eel
‘When the water is clear, the/an electric eel is easily seen.’ (Pts8)

With a passivized ditransitive verb, the O of the transitive appears as the VS of the intransitive passive clause. I have not encountered any spontaneous examples of E promotion, and attempts to elicit such constructions were not successful.

‘They were always given a lot of work, reportedly.’ (Yami10)

10.6.1.2 Analytic passive construction
Yine has a special analytic passive construction, using the anticipatory passive sufﬁx -ko, which is employed to describe how something is done, or what is to be done.
In this construction, a complement-taking verb such as hica ‘be do’, as in (685) below, or himkata ‘be able to’ as in (686) takes a subordinate verb whose stem is marked with -ko rather than the usual subordinator -le.7
(685) wane rica kamr1tkota wane r-hica kamr1ta-ko-ta there/thus 3-be/do do-ANTIC.PASS-VCL ‘This is how it (manioc beer) is made.’ (Mas38)
7The form and position of -le in the verb stem is discussed in §8.2.3; its use as a subordinator is discussed in §13.3.1.
266

(686) hi wa r1mkata pinitkotana hi wa r-himkata pinita-ko-ta-na NEG REF 3-be.able.to cure-ANTIC.PASS-VCL-CMPV ‘It cannot be cured.’ (Chr4)
In addition to having the same position as the unmarked complementizer -le, -ko in this construction also triggers the obligatory closure of the verb stem with -ta – unlike the regular anticipatory passive in e.g. (682) above.
This analytic passive construction is unique to -ko. The regular passive -ka is not used in this construction.
10.6.2 Reﬂexive
As with passives, the reﬂexive morphology in Yine distinguishes realized versus anticipated events. Reﬂexive morphology is discontinuous: the ﬁrst part is the sufﬁx -na ‘reﬂexive’ (e.g. (687)) / -ina ‘anticipatory reﬂexive’ (e.g. (688)); the second part, -wa is the same for both reﬂexives and appears in the position of the pronominal sufﬁxes on the predicate stem. The fact that the reﬂexive morphemes are discontinuous can be seen here in ((687)), where the ‘perfective’ aspect marker -tka intervenes between them.
(687) t1patewatnatkawa tu-hipatewata-na-tka-wa 3SGF-be.embarrassed-REFL-PFV-REFL ‘She embarrassed herself.’ (Kme53)
Example ((688)) also illustrates that only transitive verbs can take the reﬂexive: the verb root here, kata ‘bathe, give bath to’ is strictly transitive and its intransitive counterpart kawa ‘bathe’ cannot be made reﬂexive. Reﬂexivization is always detransitivizing.
267

(688) a. pkatinwa p-kata-ina-wa 2SG-bathe(tr)-ANTIC.REFL-REFL ‘Bathe yourself.’
b. *pkawinwa p-kawa-ina-wa 2SG-bathe(intr)-ANTIC.REFL-REFL
In certain very limited situations, a reﬂexive predicate can have an object (but can-
not cross-reference it). Example (689) shows a reﬂexive with a resultative object (in
bold):

(689) yinero hima ticanatkawa wa yalat1nero

yine-lo

hima t-hica-na-tka-wa

wa yalat1nero

person-3SGF QUOT 3SGF-be/do-REFL-PFV-REFL REF cricket.woman

‘The cricket woman made herself into a human.’ (Gri18)

In ((690)), the object is a nominalization whose possessor is coreferential with the subject of the reﬂexive verb:

(690) wala tetnatkawa tsalewninri

wala t-heta-na-tka-wa

t-salewna-inri

3SGF 3SGF-see-REFL-PFV-REFL 3SGF-suffer-ACTN.NOM

‘She saw her own suffering; She saw herself (to be) suffering.’ (Nwd60)

10.6.3 Reciprocal
Reciprocals are a special case of detransitivizer in Yine: it is not clear that they have their own unique morphology. The reciprocal marker, -kaka, is homophonous with a causative marker (see §10.7.1 below), with which it shares the same position on the verb stem, and their co-occurrence is not attested.
The question of whether reciprocals and causatives are formed with the same morpheme, or whether they use homophonous but distinct sufﬁxes, is one that requires further research. Here, I adopt the homophony view, for two reasons – neither of which is
268

particularly strong. First, the two have opposite affects on valency, with the reciprocal being a detransitivizer and the causative transitivizing the predicate. The second reason is because of examples like (691), where the reciprocal meaning is clear. Additional reciprocal examples are given below in (692) and (693).
(691) r1ylakkakanna s1wayma hawa mhenokl1neyma r-hiylaka-kaka-na-na s1wa-yma hawa mhenokl1-ne-yma 3-ﬁght-RECIP-CMPV-3PL anteater-COM and jaguar-PL-COM ‘They fought each other, the anteater and the jaguars.’ (147)

10.6.4 -lewa ‘characteristic action’
The sufﬁx -lewa, which derives a verb meaning ‘to Verb permanently, characteristically or as an occupation’, has an antipassive-like function. It removes the O argument of a transitive verb, as in (694b), or demotes it to E, as in (695), but does not affect the argument structure of intransitive verbs (as in (696)). This sufﬁx is also discussed in §8.2.3.
(694) a. raSkatl1 r-haSkata-l1 3-bite-3SGM ‘He’s biting it.’ (DP) 269

10.7 Valency increasing constructions
There are six constructions which introduce an extra argument into the predicate core in Yine: two causative sufﬁxes, an associate preﬁx, a multifunctional applicative sufﬁx, and two types of incorporation (noun, oblique marker). Each of these is discussed in turn in this section.
10.7.1 Causatives
Causative morphology introduces a new VS argument and reassigns the original VS to O position. Yine distinguishes between two types of causation: direct or forceful causation via the sufﬁx -kaka and indirect, nonforceful or mandative (ordering) causation with the sufﬁx -c¸ica. Both intransitive ((697)-(698), also (700)) and transitive ((699); also (701)) verbs can be causativized.
270

(697) a. nalna n-halna 1SG-ﬂy
‘I’m ﬂying.’ (c141)
b. palnakakno p-halna-kaka-no 2SG-ﬂy-CAUS-1SG
‘You’re making me ﬂy.’ (c141)

(Causative)

(698) a. r1mata r-himata 3-know
‘He knows.’ (c141)
b. t1matkakanr1 t-himata-kaka-na-l1 3SGF-know-CAUS-CMPV-3SGM
‘She made him know/understand.’ (c141)

(Causative)

(699) a. nÙowh1tanro n-Ùowh1ta-na-lo 1SG-steal-CMPV-3SGF
‘I stole from her.’ (g36)
b. pica Ùowh1kakanno n1nron1 pica Ùowh1-kaka-na-no n-hinro-n1 2SG steal-CAUS-CMPV1-SG 1SG-mother.of-PROP.NOM
‘You made me steal my mother’s things.’ (g36)

(Causative)

The nonforceful/mandative causative is illustrated in the following examples.

(700) wa kSoter1 hima homkamtac¸iclo wa knoya wa kSoter1 hima homkamta-c¸ica-lo wa knoya REF deer QUOT chase-MAND-3SGF REF tortoise
‘The deer ordered the tortoise to chase (play chase).’ (d30)

(Mandative)

271

(701) wale powratc¸icanro wala p1t1

wale powra-c¸ica-na-lo

wala p1t1

3SGM clean-MAND-CMPV-3SGF 3SGF patio

‘He ordered her to clean her patio.’ (f141)

(Mandative)

Elicited data indicates that these sufﬁxes are not mutually exclusive. As shown in (702), they may occur together (-kaka always preceding c¸ica):

(702) nkamr1rewkakc¸iclo n-kamr1rewa-kaka-c¸ica-lo 1SG-work-CAUS-MAND-3SGF
‘I am making her work.’

I have not encountered spontaneous examples containing both causatives, and in my elicited data it is not clear what effect combining them has on the semantics of the clause. The following example from Matteson (1965) suggests that each causative is in fact its own event but that all arguments are shared between them.8

(703) r1m1nkakyehc¸iciko r-him-hina-kaka-yehi-c¸ica-ya-ko 3-ASSOC-come-CAUS-VICIN-MAND-APPL-ANTIC.PASS
‘He is to be commanded to be caused to come to someone with someone concerning something.’ (Matteson 1965:81)

10.7.2 Associate applicative him-
Yine has a single valency-manipulating preﬁx, him- (see also §8.2.1), which introduces an object argument whose role is that of an ‘associate’: a participant who co-operates with the grammatical subject in carrying out the action denoted by the verb, and is indexed as O.
8The example as quoted in (703) is broken down and glossed according to the conventions in this grammar. Matteson’s gloss (adapted to my version of the orthography) is as follows: r-hi-m1n-kaka-yehi-c¸ica-i-ko he-accompanitive-come-causative-postposition“to”-mandatory-“concerning”-anticipatory passive ‘He is to be commanded to be caused to come to someone with someone concerning something.’
272

The associate preﬁx can be used on stems of any transitivity. It transitivizes intransitive verbs:
(704) a. n1tsolh1watan1 n-hitsolh1wata-n1 1SG-laugh-ANTIC ‘I will laugh.’ (c154)
b. n1m1tsolh1watanro n-him-hitsolh1wata-n1-lo 1SG-ASSOC-laugh-ANTIC-3SGF ‘I will laugh with her’; ‘She and I will laugh together.’ (c154)
With (ambi)transitive verbs, the associate object is treated as O. If the original verb was transitive, the erstwhile O becomes an extended argument, as example (706) illustrates.
(705) a. terkanr1 t-herka-na-l1 3SGF-wash-CMPV-3SGM ‘She washed it.’ (c152)
b. t1merkanro t-him-herka-na-lo 3SGF-ASSOC-wash-CMPV-3SGF ‘She washed (something, e.g. clothes) with her.’ (c152)
(706) a. wala nnika wala n-nika 3SGF 1SG-eat ‘I eat this one.’
b. wala n1mnikna wala n-him-nika-na 3SGF 1PL-ASSOC-eat-3PL ‘I eat this one with them.’ (Hws22)
In the associate construction, the referents expressed as VS and O have essentially the same semantic role in the same event (but see below for discussion of an asymmetry between them). Spatio-temporal overlap between the actions of the subject and
273

associate is obligatory, and if there is a patient or theme, they act in concert on it. Thus, in (707), both participants arrive together, and in (708) both get drunk together. In (706b) above, they eat communally, sharing the same meal, and in (705b) above they are washing the same load of clothing.
(707) wa hewi n1mapokl1 wa hewi n-him-hapoka-l1 REF here 1SG-ASSOC-arrive-3SGM ‘I arrived there with him.’ (Jrn15)
(708) t1m1metanno t-him-himeta-n1-no 3SGF-ASSOC-be.drunk-ANTIC-1SG ‘I’m going to get drunk with her.’ (c152)
The example in (709) illustrates how closely the subject and associate cooperate in the event. This sentence is part of a woman’s story about visiting another Yine village, where she spent a few days with her son. When she tells about sleeping there, she at ﬁrst uses the associate applicative, n1m1mkamtyatkal1. Upon her daughter’s protest, she changed to the normal 1st plural inﬂection, w1mkamtyatka. The reason for the protest, I was told, was that in using him- the woman was implying that she and her son slept ‘together’, for example immediately next to each other or in contact with each other.
(709) wane [n1m1mkamtyatkal1 –] w1mkamtyatka wane [ n-him-himka-m-ta-ya-tka-l1 –] there/thus [ 1SG-ASSOC-sleep-NONDUR-VCL-APPL-PFV-3SGM –] w-himka-m-ta-ya-tka 1PL-sleep-NONDUR-VCL-APPL-PFV ‘There [I slept with him –] we slept.’ (Hws9)
Additionally, I found that in the absence of biasing factors like animacy inequality, context, pragmatics or cultural practices (e.g. in an elicitation setting) it was possible to interpret either the VS or the O as the associate (less direct controller) in the event.
274

The three translations given in (710), for example, were each offered by at least one consultant, and all were conﬁrmed as acceptable translations.

(710) t1m1c¸hanno t-him-hic¸ha-n1-no 3SGF-ASSOC-search-ANTIC-1SG ‘I will search with her’; ‘She will help me search’; ‘I will help her search.’
Nevertheless, although the subject and associate participants carry out the action together and display a near-equivalence in translation, there is evidence of an asymmetry between them in terms of their degree of control over the event, and this asymmetry can be exploited for pragmatic effect.
The sentence in (711), for example, is taken from a story about a woman who is kidnapped by a giant called C¸ ic¸iya. The giant takes her against her will and carries her off to live with him. In (711), the derived verb r1mwanatkalo itself simply means ‘he and she lived (there) together’ or ‘he lived (there) with her’; but it is clear from the storyline that she did not have the same control over that as the giant did.

wa C¸ ic¸iya

swamp edge.of 3-ASSOC-be(loc)-CMPV-PFV-3SGF REF NAME

‘C¸ ic¸iya was living with her at the edge of a swamp.’ (Kme32)

The subject and associate need not be equally animate. Example (712) illustrates the construction with an inanimate associate (their robes), as do (714) and (715) below (the game meat and the knife, respectively).

(712) wanna halpokotatkal1 . . . hikanopna r1mansatanr1pna wanna halpokota-tka-l1 . . . hi-kanopi-na 3PL prepare-PFV . . . 3SGMPSSR-robe-3PL
r-him-hansata-n1-l1-pa-na 3-ASSOC-dance-ANTIC-SGM-ELV-3PL
‘They prepared . . . their robes in order to dance with them.’ (C23)

275

Although inanimate associates are permissable, it is not possible for them to have an instrumental role in the event:9

(713) * SiSyapi n1merkanro shishapiASSOC n-him-herka-n1-lo scrub.brush 1SG-ASSOC-wash-ANTIC-3SGF
‘I will wash/do washing with a scrub brush.’

As (714)-(716) illustrate, associate constructions in Yine may have causative overtones, particularly – but not exclusively – when the associate is not capable of carrying out the action alone (as in (714) and (715)).

(714) hico nikÙinni r1mapoka

hico nikÙi-ne-ni

(716) n1mapokanyi n-him-hapoka-n1-yi 1SG-ASSOC-arrive-ANTIC-2SG ‘You will arrive with me; I will make you arrive with me.’
Typologically, as discussed in Shibatani and Pardeshi (2002), associate derivations represent an intermediate point between causatives and applicatives: like applicatives, they introduce a new object (cf. Valenzuela (2003)’s ‘associative applicative’, Peterson (2007)’s ‘comitative applicative’); like causatives, that object has a subject-like role in the event (like causatives, cf. Dixon (2000)’s ‘causative of involvement’, Shibatani and
9The semantically near-equivalent oblique marker -yma does, however, allow both comitative and instrumental readings, e.g. SiSyapi-yma n1merkanro ‘I will wash with her using a scrub brush.’
276

Pardeshi (2002)’s ‘sociative causative’). Morphology with a similar function to himhas been reported in many Amazonian languages and is argued to be an areal feature in Guillaume and Rose (2010).

10.7.3 -ya ‘locative/applicative’
Yine employs a multifunctional applicative sufﬁx -ya to promote a wide range of oblique roles into non-oblique status, that is, into O or E position in the predicate’s argument frame. It is always valency increasing on intransitive verbs, and may either increase or rearrange the valency of a transitive verb. The roles typically promoted by -ya include location (717)-(718),10 source (719)-(720), instrument (721), beneﬁciary (722), maleﬁciary (723), and reason (724). As (718) and (720) illustrate, a location adverbial may satisfy the role of introduced location or source.

(717) a. r1kSikna r-hikSika-na 3-ﬁnd-3PL
‘He found them.’

b. wa sat1 rapha r1kSikyana

b. hawla nal1kika hawla n-hal1ka-ya-ka there 1SG-want-APPL-PASS
‘I am wanted there.’ (E79)

10In (718), there are valency-increasing and valency-decreasing mechanisms – -ya ‘applicative’ and -ka ‘passive’, respectively – in the same clause. The co-occurrence of more than one valency manipulating sufﬁx on the same predicate is not at all unusual in Yine and is touched on again in the discussion of noun incorporation in §10.8.2.

‘The poor girls were very scared of him, thus because of that the girls were crying.’ (Tgn22)

The applicative sufﬁx can also be used to promote the secondary possessor11 of an incorporated noun into object position. Example (725a) is ungrammatical because the incorporated noun, -c¸e ‘stick shaped object of’ must have its possessor expressed as a core argument in the predicate (see §10.8.2 below and §8.2.2); but as it is not a body part and does not serve to classify a human, it cannot have a 1st person primary possessor (725b).

(725) a. *noc¸e no-c¸e 1SGPSSR-stick.shaped.object.of
b. *p1stakac¸etno p-histaka-c¸e-ta-no 2SG-cut-stick.shaped.object.of-VCL-1SG

11i.e. the non-inherent possessor of an inalienably possessed noun; see §5.2.4 regarding primary and secondary possessors.
279

It can, however, have a 1st person secondary possessor (726a), and this can be expressed in an incorporation construction if the applicative -ya is employed.
(726) a. noc¸ete no-c¸e-te 1SG-stick.shaped.object.of-PSSD ‘my stick-shaped thing (e.g. pencil)’
b. p1stakac¸etyano p-histaka-c¸e-ta-ya-no 2SG-break-stick.shaped.object.of-VCL-APPL-1SG ‘You broke my pencil.’ (g26)
10.8 Incorporation and valency manipulation
10.8.1 -yehi ‘vicinity’ oblique marker
As described in §6.7.2 and §8.2.2, -yehi ‘in the vicinity/house of, near’ is an oblique role-marking sufﬁx that can be incorporated into the verb stem. When incorporated, it has an applicative effect with its notional object indexed as O on the predicate. The original verb can be intransitive (as in (727)-(729)) or transitive (as in (730)).
(727) a. yatkana Ø-ya-tka-na 3-go-PFV-3PL ‘They went’
b. yayehitatkal1na Ø-ya-yehi-ta-tka-l1-na 3-go-VICIN-VCL-PFV-3SGM-3PL ‘They approached him’; ‘They went to where he was.’ (Hiy13)

10.8.2 Noun incorporation
In Yine, noun incorporation always involves a possessed noun (whether alienable or inalienable). When the noun is incorporated, its possessor is obligatorily expressed in the core argument frame of the predicate. However, this does not necessarily mean that a new argument is introduced; very often, the valency of the clause remains the same, but the roles expressed by the arguments are changed to accommodate the possessor. Speciﬁcally, the possessor becomes the S argument of an intransitive clause, as in (731) and (732); and it becomes the O argument of a transitive clause, as in (733) and (734). Thus, noun incorporation in Yine is not valency reducing as it is in many languages.

282

10.8.2.1 Incorporation and passives/reﬂexives
Passivization and reﬂexivization are fully compatible with noun incorporation, as the examples in (735) and (736)-(738), respectively, illustrate.
The passive subject refers to the possessor of the incorporated noun.

(735) a. n1stakyi n-histaka-yi 1SG-cut-2SG
‘I cut you.’ (g25)
b. p1stakkanotka p-histaka-kano-ta-ka 2SG-cut-arm.of-VCL-PASS

283

10.8.3 Grammatical relations with multiple incorporants
Both of the argument-manipulating incorporants – -yehi and a possessed noun – can be incorporated into the same verb. The result proves to be somewhat difﬁcult to translate into English, but the following examples provide some insight into what happens to the grammatical relations in the clause when this is done.
Example (739) presents the basic transitive verb:
(739) nhirkotlo n-hirkota-lo 1SG-care.for-3SGF ‘I’m taking care of it (e.g. a lizard).’ (g66)
Consider ﬁrst the example in (740), in which only a noun has been incorporated:12
(740) nhirkotac¸pirotetyi n-hirkota-c¸piro-te-ta-yi 1SG-care.for-lizard-PSSD-VCL-2SG ‘I’m taking care of your lizard.’ (g66)
When -yehi is incorporated as well, bringing with it the need to express its object, the following translation was given:
(741) nhirkotac¸pirotyehityi n-hirkota-c¸piro-te-yehi-ta-yi 1SG-care.for-lizard-PSSD-VICIN-VCL-2SG ‘I’m taking care of your (house/corral of) lizards.’ (g66)
On discussing the example further, my consultant offered a more explanatory translation: “I am taking care of your lizards, and they are in an enclosed space of their own, for example a little corral.” These translations suggest that the ‘applied object’ of -yehi is in fact the incorporated noun, the possessor of which is cross-referenced in O as required by Yine’s noun incorporation system. The O argument is not the one introduced
12This example, while perfectly grammatical, was quite amusing to my consultant, because ‘We don’t take lizards as pets’.
284

by -yehi: (741) does not mean ‘I am taking care of (someone’s, or your) lizards in your vicinity’. Nor is the sentence interpreted as having an unexpressed object of -yehi: for example, it does not translate as ‘I am taking care of your lizards in (someone else’s) vicinity’. Additionally, it was clearly the animals that were being cared for – not their (implied) quarters.
A similar example, conﬁrmed on a different occasion with a different speaker, is given in (742). It was given the same sort of interpretation as (741), with both incorporated elements again having their required grammatical roles satisﬁed within the same predicate. (742) nhir1kotats1nr1c¸ityehityi
n-hirkota-ts1nr1c¸i-te-yehi-ta-yi 1SG-care.for-parrot-PSSD-VICIN-VCL-2SG ‘I’m taking care of your (cage of) parrots (g90)

11 The Clause
The purpose of this chapter is to present the basic structure of the Yine clause. I ﬁrst present the clause constituents and their relative ordering, which applies to both verbal and nonverbal clauses. The special functions carried out by nonverbal clauses are discussed in §11.5.
11.1 Clause structure
For all verbal and most nonverbal clauses, only the predicate is strictly obligatory, as long as it bears pronominal markers indexing its core argument(s).1
Table 11.1 outlines the structure of the Yine clause.
Pre-core Sentence connective NP/adverb: time, manner, location Topicalized argument
Core Core or peripheral argument(s) (focused) Predicate Core or peripheral argument(s) (non-focused)
Post-core NP/adverb Table 11.1: Clause structure
§11.2 presents the pre-core constituents; their relative positioning is ﬁxed in the order given in Table 11.1; §11.3 addresses the clause core and describes the (highly variable) ordering of the predicate and its arguments; in §11.4 the option to place a clause-level modiﬁer after the core is addressed.
1Regarding the optionality of non-subject core arguments, see §10.1.4.
287

11.2 Pre-core constituents
Discourse connectives and topicalized arguments always occur in the pre-core periphery of the clause; clause-level modiﬁers typically do but are also attested in the postcore periphery.

11.2.1 Connective
The ﬁrst position in the clause is occupied by discourse connectives, sentence-linking words that provide cohesion at the discourse level. One of these, hiyaho, behaves morphologically like a nonverbal predicate head: in addition to optionally having clauselevel aspect and/or mood sufﬁxes, it obligatorily takes the impersonal pronominal sufﬁx -ni. It cannot have a referential subject or any kind of modiﬁer, is quite limited in its morphological complexity, and cannot stand as a complete sentence. Thus, it may be considered a defective predicate whose function is cohesive rather than structural, moving the narrative forward in a manner similar to, but less marked than, the English phrase ‘Then/so it was (that). . . ’.

(743) hiyahni mapa whenhimatkalo

hiyaho-ni

mapa whene-hima-tka-lo

then-IMP.DECL three young.of-QUOT-PFV-3SGF

‘So she had three children, reportedly.’ (hetn69)

(744) hiyahotnakni . . . hiyaho-tnaka-ni then-REIT-IMP.DECL
‘Then once again . . . ’ (DP)

(745) hiyahhimatkani panÙi rapokatka

hiyaho-hima-tka-ni

panÙi r-hapoka-tka

then-QUOT-PFV-IMP.DECL house 3-arrive-PFV

‘Then they arrived at the house.’ (Twm22)

288

The contrast coordinator seyo (see also §13.1.2) has the same defective-predicate structure when used as a discourse connective: seyni [seyo-ni] [but-IMP.DECL], and most naturally translates as ‘but, however’, as in (746).2

(746) seyni hima wale hi hima r1nkaklewatana seyni hima wale hi hima r-hinkaklewata-na but QUOT 3SGM NEG QUOT 3-relate-CMPV ‘But he would not tell.’ (Nwd33)
The other connectives, wanepn1te ‘next’ and maka ‘contrary to expectation’, frequently bear the clause-level aspect and/or modality sufﬁxes (cf. §9.5) but are not predicates. Examples of these are provided below.

(747) wanepn1thima wane yatnaka

wanepn1te hima wane Ø-ya-tnaka

QUOT there 3-go-REIT

‘Next, they went there again.’ (Gua8)

p1tsot1 n-koseta-na-tka

CNTREXP-GENZ electric.eel 1SG-catch-CMPV-PFV

‘But instead, I had caught an electric eel.’ (Pts33)

The co-ordinating conjunction hawa can also function as a discourse connective, as it does in (751) in §11.2.2. The difference between hawa and the connectives described above is that hawa can co-ordinate subclausal constituents, but the others cannot.

11.2.2 Topicalized NP
Topicalization in Yine involves moving the topicalized constituent to a clause-initial position, following only any discourse-level connectives in the sentence. The topicalized NP is set off from the remainder of the clause by a prosodic boundary (high pitch
2The same root with different inﬂections has the sense of ‘all, no more’: e.g. seyotkani [seyo-tka-ni] [but-PFV-IMP.DECL] ‘that is all now’; seyoka [seyo-ka] [but-ASSRT] ‘no more; the end’.

11.2.3 Clause-level modiﬁer
Clause-level modiﬁers provide information about the time, manner, or location of the event denoted in the predicate. More than one may co-occur in a single clause. The most common of these is the adverb wane, which is obligatory with the speech verb Ùina (752) and otherwise functions as a manner (753) or location (754) modiﬁer.

11.3 Clause core
The clause core consists of the predicate and its arguments. The relative order of predicate and arguments varies considerably under pragmatic and stylistic motivations, the details of which are not well understood; the following discussion attempts to describe the most common patterns.
It is also worth noting that two NPs do not occur in a single clause very frequently, and even less frequently do two core argument NPs occur together. There is a general tendency in Yine to introduce only one participant into the discourse at a time,3 and subsequent reference is typically carried out primarily by means of the pronominal afﬁxes on the predicate.
Both core and oblique arguments may either precede or follow the predicate, regardless of whether the clause is verbal or nonverbal. Thus, in intransitive clauses the subject may precede the predicate (758), (760), or follow it (759), (761). Placing an argument before the predicate has a slight focussing effect. The predicate-ﬁrst order is somewhat more common than argument-ﬁrst in verbal clauses; in nonverbal clauses it is very strongly preferred but not obligatory, as example (760) illustrates.

‘The snake-man ran (for a while).’ (Kok25)

3This tendency is found in many other languages as well and has been discussed in the literature; eg. Chafe (1987) proposes a constraint limiting the introduction of new concepts into the discourse to one per intonation unit, and Du Bois (1987), based on Sacapultec Maya data, proposes a constraint limiting the introduction of new arguments to one per clause.

Oblique arguments may likewise appear either before (762) or after (763) the predicate.

With transitive verbs, considering examples where both the subject and object are expressed with independent NPs, all possible constituent orders are attested.

VSO order is illustrated in (768) and is also found in (773) below.
(768) pa kata netl1 hita p1tsot1 pa kata [ n-heta-l1 ]PRED [ hita ]NP:VS [ p1tsot1 ]NP:O one time [ 1SG-see-3SGM ] [ 1SG ] [ electric.eel ] ‘Once I saw an electric eel.’ (Pts13)
Examples (769) and (770) are VOS:
(769) c¸imeka reneknona hita wa wanna s1cone [ c¸imeka ]NP:E [ r-heneka-no-na ]PRED [ hita ]NP:O [ manioc ] [ 3-give-1SG-3PL ] [ 1SG ] [ wa wanna s1co-ne ]NP:S [ REF 3PL woman-PL ] ‘Those women gave me manioc.’ (nHwS)
294

In (770), the relevant clause is subordinate (the main clause is omitted here). Constituent order is not signiﬁcantly different in subordinate versus main clauses, except that it is more common for core arguments to follow the predicate in subordinate clauses. This would follow if the pre-predicate position is focal, as subordinate clauses do not usually contain focal information.

(770) . . . hi ticpoko hikSikletlo wa Swamkalo nhan1nro

hi t-hicpoko

[ hikSika-le-ta-lo ]PRED

INTRG 3SGF-do(manner) [ ﬁnd-SUBD-VCL-3SGF ]

[ wa Swamkalo ]NP:O [ n-hn1nro ]NP:VS

[ REF spider ]

[ 1SG-wife.of ]

‘. . . how my wife found the spider.’ (wap43)

There are rare situations where the argument indexing system is unable to assist in identifying the grammatical roles of two independently expressed core arguments: if both arguments precede the predicate; or if both arguments are 3rd person plural. These are situations where we might expect to ﬁnd the constituent order to be more constrained, and this does in fact seem to be the case to some extent.
When an argument precedes the predicate, it is not (normally) indexed through pronominal afﬁxes. If both the subject and object appear before the predicate and neither one is indexed, this effectively removes argument indexing as a means of identifying their roles. This situation rarely arises in my corpus: (771) is the only unelicited example I have encountered. Here, the order is SOV.

(771) p1tsot1 kopac¸i nika [ p1tsot1 ]NP:VS [ kopac¸i ]NP:O [ nika ]PRED [ electric.eel ] [ sardine ] [ eat ] ‘The electric eel eats sardines.’ (Pts5)
With (771) both the textual context and real world knowledge make it clear what role each of the arguments is playing in the event. The example in (772) below, on the other hand, is representative of several examples I presented to my consultants in isolation. Here, there is no biasing context and the arguments have equal animacy. It
295

was generally agreed that sentences like (772) could be interpreted as either SOV or OSV, as indicated in the translation, but that SOV order was preferred.

(772) wala wale hic¸hanata

[ wala ]NP:S/O [ wale ]NP:O/S [ hic¸ha-na-ta ]PRED

[ 3SGF ]

[ 3SGM ] [ search.for-DUR-VCL ]

‘She is looking for him’ (preferred) or ‘He is looking for her.’

The second situation where pronominal indexing fails to disambiguate the arguments’ roles is when the pronominal indexing itself is ambiguous: that is, when both arguments are 3rd person plural as in example (773). Here again, both VSO and VOS interpretations are acceptable, but in this case there was not as strong a preference for one order over the other. (In context, the intended reading is the one given in the ﬁrst translation – the anteaters killed the jaguars).

(773) r1ylatanna s1wane mhenokl1ne [ r-hiyla-ta-na-na]PRED [ s1wa-ne]NP:S/O [ mhenokl1-ne]NP:O/S [ 3-kill-VCL-DUR-3PL ] [ anteater-PL ] [ jaguar-PL ] ‘The anteaters killed the jaguars’ or ‘The jaguars killed the anteaters.’
Overall, constituent order in the clause core is best described as pragmatically,
rather than syntactically, motivated. New and/or prominent participants appear ﬁrst,
while established or topical constituents follow the predicate.

11.4 Post-core modiﬁer
In very few examples in my corpus, a clause-level modiﬁer follows the predicate, as in (774) and (775).

296

(774) wickoca hiylatl1 wnikanr1 hiyampot1 wica koca hiylata-l1 w-nika-n1-r1 1PL ADD kill-3SGM 1-PL-eat-ANTIC-SGM

m1Ùikawa

‘They used to live there before.’ (Yam5)

Further research is needed to determine whether the post-core adverb position is open to the same range of phrase types as the pre-core modiﬁer position, and what effect the relative placement has on the meaning of the clause.

11.5 Nonverbal clauses
Yine does not have a copula verb. The relational function of such a verb in other languages is carried out instead by verbless clauses of two sorts: those with a zero predicate, consisting of two arguments in apposition; and those containing a non-verbal predicate, headed by an NP constituent or an adverb. In this section, I describe how Yine expresses copula-type relationships, organizing the discussion around the relational clause typology proposed in Dixon (2002).

297

11.5.1 Identity, Equation and Naming clauses
Identity clauses express a relationship in which the subject belongs to the class of items denoted by the predicate (cf. Payne 1997’s ‘proper inclusion’ clauses). In equation clauses, the subject and the predicate refer to the same entity. The predicate in a naming clause expresses the name of the subject. Each of these construction types are typically formed in Yine using predicates headed by an NP or any element that can be the sole member of an NP (cf. §6.4). Zero-predicate clauses may also be used to express an identity relationship between two NPs; see example (780) below. Aside from this, Yine does not exhibit any formal distinction between identity and equation clauses.
Typical examples of identity clauses are given in (777)-(780). In (777), the gender marking in the predicate head – i.e. -lo – agrees with the natural gender of the (2nd person) subject. The gender marking is hidden in (778) due to vowel elision, but in context this example has a female referent as well.
(777) yineropmakatkayi yine-lo-pa-maka-tka-yi human-SGF-ELV-FRUST-PFV-2SG ‘If (only) you would become a human woman.’ (hetn5)
(778) hi wa yinerni hi wa yine-lo-ni NEG REF human-SGF-IMP.DECL ‘She is not a human.’ (hetn78)
In (779), the subject is expressed only in the pronominal sufﬁx -ni. Although its referent is personal and animate, the impersonal subject marker is used because the predicate is headed by a noun; see §9.1.2.2.
(779) mÙiratkani mÙira-tka-ni spider.monkey-PFV-IMP.DECL ‘It was a spider monkey.’ (Mch30)
298

In (780), the same identity relationship is expressed twice in two consecutive clauses, ﬁrst with a zero-predicate clause (780a), then paraphrased with a nominal clause in (780b).

(780) a. wale kamÙi wale kamÙi 3SGM demon ‘That (one) is a demon.’
b. kamÙitkani kamÙitkani demon-PFV-IMP.DECL ‘It’s a demon.’ (hetn21-2)
Examples (781)-(783) illustrate equation clauses.
In (781), the speaker is explaining that what appears to be her hair is in fact part of
her face. There are two equation clauses in this example: the ﬁrst one stating that her
hair (the topicalized subject) is her face (the predicate), and the second one explaining
that it is not her hair.

(781) wale noc¸iw1 nohoc¸ni. hi wa noc¸iwni [ [ wale no-c¸iw1 ]NP:NVS [ no-hoc¸i-ni ]PRED ]CL [ [ 3SGM 1SGPSSR-hair.of ] [ 1SGPSSR-face.of-IMP.DECL ] ] [ hi wa no-c¸iw1-ni]CL [ NEG REF 1SGPSSR-hair.of-IMP.DECL ] ‘This my hair, it’s my face. It’s not my hair.’ (Hetn52)
The ﬁrst clause in (782) illustrates an equation clause headed by a pronoun. The
second clause – also an equation clause – is headed by a nominalized predicate, as is
example (783); this represents one of Yine’s relativization strategies (see §6.2.2.2).

Naming constructions also employ a nominal predicate head and are structurally like identity and equation clauses.

n-hiwaka-ni

Hwa

Example (785) also serves to illustrate the use of the non-declarative subject marker, here expressing a sense of uncertainty on the part of the speaker as to what the translation of sol1 (sunbittern) might be.

(785) klo hiwakla sol1?

klo

hiwaka-la

sol1

what+SGF name.of-IMP.NONDECL sol1

‘What might the sunbittern be called?’ (h151)

11.5.2 Attribution clauses
In attribution clauses, the predicate expresses an attribute of the subject. This relationship is expressed in Yine with a clause headed by an adjective or nominalized adjective predicate. Examples of adjectival attribution clauses are given in (786) and (787).

(786) kihleno hita hewiya

[ kihle-no]PRED [ hita]NP:NVS [ hewi-ya]NP:OBL

‘I am well here.’ (Jml2)

300

(787) c¸inan1pyi c¸inan1-pa-yi full-ELV-2SG ‘You will be full.’ (het15)
On adjectival predicates, 3rd person singular subject marking is homophonous with the gender agreement sufﬁxes: i.e. -l1 (masc), -lo (feminine). Thus, examples like (788) raise the question of whether the -l1 is an agreement marker – making this a zeropredicate clause – or a pronominal subject marker – making this an adjectival clause. The question can be resolved and the sufﬁx identiﬁed as pronominal by comparing (788) with (786) and (787) above: the latter do not have any agreement morphology, and the subject markers -no and -yi stand in opposition to the -l1 in (788).

kihle-pot1-hima-lo

Further examples of adjectival attribution clauses are given in (789) and (790).

hi wa ka-yhi-r1

Nominal predicates, including those headed by a nominalized adjective, take the impersonal subject marker -ni/-la in 3rd person. 1st and 2nd person take the regular NVS subject markers (e.g. (791)). Unlike the bare adjective roots in the above examples, adjectives bearing a gender/number sufﬁx are treated as nouns when they head a
301

predicate (see §7.1 for discussion of the nominalizing properties of gender and number agreement). An example illustrating the use of -ni as the 3rd person subject marker on nominalized adjectives is given in (792).

‘That one is (a) dangerous (one), the manatee.’ (svm6)

11.5.3 Existence clauses
Existence clauses consist of a subject and a predicate headed by the location/manner adverb wane. These constructions are frequently used with a presentational sense, to introduce participants into the discourse, as is the case in (793) and (794).

(793) waner1 sat1 c¸ec¸i

wane-l1 sat1

c¸ec¸i

there-3SGM SPEC+MASC man

‘There was a certain man.’ (Bfm60n)

(795) wanena nw1henene wane-na n-whene-ne there-3PL 1SG-child.of-PL ‘My children exist’; ‘I have children.’ (Gav34)
302

Existence clauses do not often have 1st or 2nd person subjects, but the widely used conventional greeting in (796) below illustrates that it is grammatically possible:
(796) waneyi? wane-yi there/thus-2SG ‘Are you there?’ (‘Do you exist?’)
The negative existential in Yine is formed using a distinct adverbial root, maleSa ‘not there’, which expresses absence or non-existence and, like its positive counterpart, is ambiguous for location versus existence.
(797) maleSna mt1r1ne maleSa-na mt1r1-ne not.there-3PL small.ones+masc-PL ‘There aren’t any children.’ / ‘The children are gone.’ (B117)

‘We also had no food (our food was not there.)’

303

11.5.4 Possession clauses
In possession clauses, the predicate mediates a relationship of possession between two entities. Yine employs four constructions to express this: an applicative derivation of the existence predicate; the existential predicate itself; a predicate headed by an attributive derivation; and a predicate headed by a possessive pronoun.
The ﬁrst of these, and the most common in my corpus, is formed by adding the applicative sufﬁx -ya to the existential predicate head which, as with existentials, is the adverb wane. In this construction, the possessor is treated as the core argument, indexed on the predicate with the NVS sufﬁx, and the possessum is treated as an extended (E) argument, neither indexed on the predicate nor marked as oblique.

A non-applicative existential predicate may also be used to express possession, as in (805). Here, the existence of a possessed thing is asserted, and its possessor is encoded through regular possessive morphology on the possessum. The possessum is the subject in this construction.

Another possession clause strategy employs an attributive derivation (see §4.3.1) as the predicate head. The subject is thus identiﬁed as one who possesses a certain attribute. Such clauses could be considered a special subtype of attribution clause.

(806) kapc¸ino ka-pc¸i-no ATTRIB-house.of-1SG

NEG REF [ ATTRIB-tooth.of-3SGM ] [ REF electric.eel ]

‘The electric eel does not have teeth.’ (Pts69)

Finally, possession-type meanings can be expressed using a clause headed by a possessive pronoun.4 Such clauses, exempliﬁed in ((808)), could be considered a special type of identity clause, in which the subject is identiﬁed as belonging to the set of

‘That clay is mine.’ (b79)

11.5.5 Location clauses
While adverb-based possession and existence clauses could both arguably be subsumed under location clauses (see especially (794) and (799) for suggestive examples), in this section I will brieﬂy address predicates headed by location words, as the latter have not been addressed in the preceding sections. First, demonstrative adverbs such as hewi frequently head nonverbal predicates that express the location of their subject:
(809) cani hewno hita cani hewi-no hita now here-1SG 1SG ‘Now I am here.’ (Jrn25)

(810) hewni nopc¸i

hewi-ni

no-pc¸i

here-IMP.DECL 1SGPSSR-house.of

‘Here is my house.’ (Hetn25)

Additionally, the interrogative hinaka ‘where’ can head a predicate questioning the location of the subject:

(811) Kmentsa, hinakatkayi? Kmentsa hinaka-tka-yi NAME where-PFV-2SG
‘Kmentsa, where are you now?’ (Kme62)

12 Sentence Types
The structure of the basic (declarative) clause was treated in Chapter 11. This chapter presents how other clause types are constructed in Yine. It begins with a discussion of negation, followed by a look at politeness in declarative clauses (§12.2), then moves on to discuss the various types of interrogative clause in §12.3. Exclamative clauses are addressed in §12.4, and the chapter closes with a look at how Yine, in the absence of dedicated imperative morphology, forms commands (§12.5).
12.1 Negation
The negation of basic declarative verbal main clauses (called ‘standard negation’ in Payne 1985) is expressed in Yine using the particle hi.1 This particle is homophonous with the particle used for interrogative and exclamative utterances; cf. §12.3 and §12.4 below.
Typical examples of clausal negation are provided in (812) and (813), with an intransitive and transitive verbal predicate, respectively. As these examples illustrate, the negative particle always precedes the predicate, and in some cases also the arguments of the predicate. In a negated clause negation, the predicate, and subject marking are the only obligatory grammatical elements. Aside from the presence of the negative particle, there is no difference between positive and negative polarity clauses.
(812) a. r1yoka r-hiyoka 3SGM-be.awake ‘He is awake.’
1Much of the description in this section is a slightly modiﬁed form of the sections in Hanson (to appear) that discuss the Yine negative particle.
307

b. hi r1yoka hi r-hiyoka NEG 3SGM-be.awake
‘He is not awake.’

(813) a. r1kSiklona r-hikSika-lo-na 3SGM-ﬁnd-3SGF-3PL
‘They found her.’
b. hi r1kSiklona hi r-hikSika-lo-na NEG 3SGM-ﬁnd-3SGF-3PL
‘They did not ﬁnd her.’

Formally, clauses negated with hi are identical to their positive counterparts, and do not exhibit any restrictions in their aspectual speciﬁcations. The sentences below illustrate negated clauses with perfective (814) and imperfective (815) aspect, and anticipatory mood (816) (also used for imperatives, see §12.5 below).

308

12.1.1 Negation of nonverbal clauses
Most types of nonverbal clauses are negated in the same way as verbal clauses. Examples (817) and (818) illustrate the negation of a clause headed by an adjective and an adverb, respectively.
(817) hi tsr1kni hi tsr1-ka-ni NEG big+MASC-ASSRT-IMP.DECL ‘It is not big.’ (Kch18)
(818) hi how1katkano hi how1ka-tka-no NEG far-PFV-1SG ‘I was not far now.’ (Kno42)
As with verbal predicates, nonverbal predicates retain their normal range of inﬂectional possibilities, a typical sampling of which can be seen in examples (819)-(821) with various mood and aspect markers.
(819) hi kihlenapyi hi kihle-na-pa-yi NEG good-CMPV-ELV-2SG ‘You will not be well.’ (Per9)
(820) hi tsrokakakni hi tsro-kaka-ka-ni NEG big+FEM-DISTR-ASSRT-IMP.DECL ‘Each of them was not big; none of them was big.’ (Hetn53)
(821) hi how1katkani hi how1ka-tka-ni NEG far-PFV-IMP.DECL ‘It wasn’t far now.’ (Caz42)
309

Predicates which are headed by a nominal (noun, pronoun, or nominalization) are exceptional, being negated with both the negative particle and the article wa, as described in the next section.
12.1.2 Collocation of hi with article: hi wa
To some extent, negation in Yine is sensitive to the word class being negated. Speciﬁcally, the distinction between referential (nominal) versus non-referential (non-nominal) elements is important. Predicates headed by non-referential word classes - verbs, adverbs, adjectives - are negated with the negative particle alone. With predicates headed by nouns, pronouns, or nominalizations, however, the negative particle is obligatorily accompanied by the article wa (described in §3.1.3).2 The two elements form a single, inseparable phonological word, but this is not necessarily evidence that they also form a single grammatical word. Any element that is not bimoraic (in Yine, this is equivalent to bisyllabic due to the lack of close syllables, contrastive vowel length, or diphthongs) is parsed into the preceding phonological word in connected speech.
As with other predicates in negated clauses, nominal predicates do not have restricted or modiﬁed morphological possibilies compared to their positive counterparts, though they in general are not typically very morphologically complex. Typical examples are provided in (822)-(824).
(822) hi wa noc¸iwni hi wa no-c¸iw1-ni NEG REF 1SGPSSR-hair.of-IMP.DECL ‘It is not my hair.’ (Hetn73)
(823) hi wa yinerni hi wa yine-lo-ni NEG REF people-SGF-IMP.DECL ‘She is not (a) human (woman).’ (Hetn105)
2Wa is a referential article marking discourse activation. Its use in collocation with the negative particle is consistent with its general usage in the language.
310

(824) hi wa wale hwapaÙrini hi wa wale hwapa-Ùri-ni NEG REF 3SGM bring-SUBJ.NOM+MSG-IMP.DECL ‘He didn’t bring him.’ (He is not the him bringer.) (MyI84)
Though obligatory with nominal predicates, hi wa is also very frequently used in non-nominal clauses, in a manner that is grammatically (but not pragmatically) indistinguishable from the use of hi alone. However, its use has a particular semantic/pragmatic effect, the details of which are not well understood and deserve a dedicated study of their own. It seems to have the same function as it does with nominal clauses, associating negation with a referential element in the clause. In the case of verbal clauses, this means an argument of the verb. This function of hi wa overlaps with Yine’s general strategy for associating negation with a particular clausal constituent (serving to manipulate negative scope), as described in §12.1.3 below.
The pair of sentences in (825) provide a sense of the difference between hi alone and hi wa in a clause: in the latter case, the O argument, indexed in the pronominal sufﬁx, is necessarily referential; in the former, not necessarily. One consultant explained the difference in the following way: in (825a), there is not necessarily anyone to see or look at; in (825b) there is someone, but the speaker hasn’t seen him – the inclusion of wa forces a referential interpretation of O.
(825) a. hi netl1 hi n-heta-l1 NEG 1SG-see-3SGM ‘I didn’t see it/him; I didn’t see anyone; I didn’t look.’
b. hi wa netl1 hi wa n-heta-l1 NEG REF 1SG-see-3SGM ‘I didn’t see it/him (a particular person).’
The particular grammatical role associated with negation through the use of hi wa is not restricted: as the examples below in this section and the next will illustrate, it may be the subject of an intransitive or transitive clause, the object of a transitive
311

clause, or an extended argument like a location. In each case, either context or explicit topicalization makes it clear which argument is under hi wa’s scope, but this clarity is not always evident. In the following examples, I use square brackets in the translation to indicate which element appears to be associated with negation in each case based on the discourse context.
In an intransitive clause like (826) (adjectival predicate) or (827) (verbal predicate), it is obvious that hi wa must be associating with the subject as this is the only nominal in the clause.

(826) hi wa kayhir1 wa p1tsot1

hi wa ka-yhi-l1

wa p1tsot1

NEG REF ATTRIB-tooth.of-SGM REF electric.eel

‘[The electric eel] does not have teeth (is not one having teeth).’ (Pts69)

(827) cani halikaka hi wa wpikan1tka cani halikaka hi wa w-pika-n1-tka now indeed NEG REF 1PL-be.afraid-ANTIC-PFV ‘Now, indeed, [we] will not be afraid.’ (Mshk121)
The scope of hi wa in (828) and (829) relies entirely on context to determine. The sentence in (828) is taken from a scene in a narrative where the speaker is urging her sisters-in-law not to cut her hair into a fringe. The reason, she explains, is that what appears to be her hair is in fact part of her face. Her objection, then, is not against having a fringe cut in general, nor against her sisters-in-law cutting one, but rather against having one cut on herself. Thus, hi wa here associates negation with the object, expressed in the 1SG pronominal sufﬁx -no.
(828) hi wa hyopr1hanno hi wa h-yopr1ha-n1-no NEG REF 2PL-cut.fringe-ANTIC-1SG ‘Do not cut [me] a fringe.’ (Hetn74)
312

The example in (829) is taken from a narrative in which the heroes are trying to kill a certain female jaguar; she hides away in a cave and they cannot reach her, so they do not kill her (though they have successfully killed other jaguars earlier in the story). Using hi wa here provides focus on the object argument.
(829) hi wa hima r1ylatlona hi wa hima r-hiylata-lo-na NEG REF QUOT 3SGM-kill-3SGF-3PL ‘They didn’t kill [her].’ (TsN64)
The surface form of the clause can be manipulated to clarify which argument is intended to be associated with the negation, whether through constituent order or through the choice to express an argument with an independent NP; it is in this way that the function of hi wa overlaps most with the general strategies in the language for combining negation and focus, described in the next section.
12.1.3 Negation and focus
Yine does not employ exclusively phonological means like stress or intonation to explicitly associate negation with a particular clausal element. Rather, this is done either by manipulating the constituent order in the sentence, or through topicalization. The strategies are the same whether hi is used alone or with the article as hi wa.
One strategy is to place the focussed element between the negative particle and the predicate, as with the quantiﬁed (elided) subject in (830), the direct object in (831) and (832), and the location object in (833). The negation, fronted argument, and predicate form a single intonation unit. As the continuing context indicates, given in parentheses following the translations of each sentence, this construction expresses contrastive focus.

Topicalization in Yine involves moving the topicalized element to clause-initial position, following only the sentence connectives (see §11.1), and it represents another strategy for negative focus. In this construction, the topicalised element appears at the beginning of the clause, before the negative particle, and is set off from the remainder of the clause by a prosodic boundary (high pitch on ﬁnal syllable, often followed by a pause). Examples of various topicalized arguments are provided in (840)-(845) below.

12.1.4 Repetition of hi in a sentence
The negative particle may be repeated within a single sentence, serving to express negative disjuction. As the following sentences exemplify, hi (or hi wa) precedes each element that it negates. While these examples appear to involve the disjunction of constituents rather than clauses, the fact that the reported evidential marker hima may be repeated along with the negative particle (as in (847)) provides evidence that the
316

disjunction is in fact at the clause level, with elided predicates. While hima may appear more than once in a clause in Yine, it always either precedes the predicate or is incorporated into it; it does not appear following the predicate.3

12.2 Politeness in declarative clauses
The force of a statement can be softened, or a statement made more polite, by adding the ‘attenuative’ sufﬁx -Ùi to the end of the predicate. This construction seems to be limited to 1st person subjects, but whether this is a grammatical or pragmatic restriction is not certain. The following examples illustrate regular versus attenuated declarative clauses, where (848b) is what I was taught to say as a more polite version of (848a):
3For a very restricted exception, see §12.5.5.

(Polite declarative)

‘I’m just going to look at the water.’ (‘I’ll be looking at the water; I’m going to be looking at the water.’)

12.3 Interrogative clauses
Although intonation is frequently an indicator of interrogative clauses across languages, in Yine a distinct intonation contour is consistently found only in basic polar questions, which lack interrogative morphology; see §12.3.1.1 below. With all other question types, the intonation usually matches that of a declarative clause. Rising intonation is optional, but not required. With the exception of the basic polar question, the interrogative clause is most reliably identiﬁed by the presence of a question word or particle at the beginning of the clause.
The methods of forming interrogatives described here are not sensitive to the type of predicate head: both verbal and non-verbal clauses are treated the same way.
12.3.1 Polar questions
There are two types of polar question in Yine: the basic polar question, which is marked only by intonation, and the conﬁrmation-type or ‘expected afﬁrmative’ polar question, which is introduced by the negative particle hi with the mirative enclitic =he, and has optional rising intonation. There are no shifts in constituent order involved in either type.
318

12.3.1.1 Basic polar questions
In the absence of one of the overt interrogative markers described below, intonation alone can signal a polar question. For example, when uttered with rising intonation the declarative clause t-apoka-tka (3SGF-arrive-PFV) ‘She has arrived’ becomes the question ‘Has she arrived?’. As noted above, this is the only situation where a distinct intonation contour is consistently found in Yine questions. Polar questions formed via intonation alone do not express or imply any expectations regarding the answer.

12.3.1.2 ‘Expected afﬁrmative’ polar questions
Polar questions that imply the expectation of an afﬁrmative answer are formed from negated clauses in Yine. In such questions, the mirative enclitic attaches to the negative particle itself rather than to the predicate (as it does in exclamative clauses, see §12.4 below). These questions tend to have a declarative contour, but rising intonation is optional. Example (849) illustrates an expected afﬁrmative question (along with its answer in (849b)) with a verbal clause; (850) illustrates that these questions can also be formed in nonverbal clauses.

b. wanena nw1henene wane-na n-whene-ne there-3PL 1SG-child.of-PL
‘I have children.’ (lit. ‘My children exist.’) (Gav34)

12.3.2 ‘Alternative’ questions
Alternative questions are formed by adding the ‘alternative’ particle waka and the negative noun hike ‘no’ to the clause expressing the afﬁrmative alternative.
(851) hihi waka hike? hihi waka hike yes or nothing ‘Yes or no?’

(852) hi n1mata r1nannehe waka hike

waka hike

NEG 1SG-know 3-come-ANTIC-3PL=INTRST=MIR or nothing

Table 12.1: Simple question terms in Yine

As their forms suggest, there are three basic question roots or themes involved: kl1, with pronominal and adjectival functions and which forms the base for kl1ner1; kat1, a pronominal question word reserved for human referents; and hi, the particle that serves polysemously as an interrogative and exclamative marker, and as an adverbial question term, as well as forming the base for both hir1 and hinaka.

12.3.3.1 kl1 ‘what, which’
Kl1 is an adjectival question word that inﬂects for gender and number in agreement with the noun it questions (see §4.3.3 for discussion on adjective agreement). Its paradigm consists of the forms kl1 (masc.sg), klo (fem.sg) and kna (plural). Like all adjectives,
321

kl1 can modify a noun (854) or itself stand in for the questioned noun phrase (855)(857).

The unusual gender agreement in (856) is worth noting. The feminine form of the question word is used here in agreement with the natural gender of the addressee; grammatical gender is not distinguished in 2nd person forms in the language. In this particular example, it is not possible for the question word to agree with the questioned noun, because hiwaka ‘name of’ belongs to the set of genderless inalienable nouns (cf. §5.1.2). Like all such nouns, hiwaka takes on the gender of its possessor; it is with this inherited gender that klo agrees in (856). The same is also true of -mec¸i in (854), which is also an inalienable noun with no inherent gender. In (854), however, the possessor of the feathers is not known, so a different strategy is needed for deciding on the form
322

of the interrogative. In this case, the form is masculine because this is the functionally unmarked gender in the language.

12.3.3.2 kl1ner1 ‘which, what’
Kl1ner1, a derived form of kl1, is a pronominal or adjectival question word with a more formal or emphatic sense than kl1.4 It is derived from kl1 using the ‘being/entity’ formative -ner1 (masc)/ -nero (fem).

12.3.3.3 kat1 ‘who’
Kat1 functions as an interrogative pronoun and questions a (usually) human referent. The ﬁnal vowel is thematic, expressing gender in the singular: kat1 ’masc.sg’; kato ’fem.sg’, and probably derives historically from an inﬂectional marker (see §5.1.1 for similar examples in nouns). The plural form, knane, is irregular and appears to have
4That kl1, the masculine form, is used here is a further indication that masculine is the functionally unmarked gender in Yine.
323

double plural marking (the plural agreement marker -na and the nominal pluralizer ne). Its close resemblance to kna, the plural of kl1 described above, suggests that there is a historical relationship between these two forms (with knane perhaps arising as a pluralization of kna), but further research would be needed to determine whether this is the case.

‘Who all arrived?’

12.3.3.4 hi ‘how’
The interrogative particle hi corresponds to ‘how’ or ‘what’ and operates on the clause level. As (864) illustrates, hi is also used to question direct speech.
(863) hi pickayi? hi picka-yi INTRG like-2SG ‘How are you?’ (‘How are you like?’)
(864) hi pÙinno? hi p-Ùina-no INTRG 2SG-say-1SG ‘What (lit. how) did you say to me?’ (Hetu33)
Five of the complex question terms in Yine are based on hi; see Table 12.2 below. 324

12.3.3.5 hir1 ‘which (one)’
Hir1 can function as an adjective or a pronoun; it inﬂects for number and gender with the forms hir1 (SGM), hiro (SGF) and hinna (plural). By their morphology, the singular forms appear to be -l1 object/property nominalizations of the question particle; this is consistent also with their meaning. The plural form is irregular, but bears a strong resemblance to the (also irregular) 3PL pronoun wanna; it is possible that both hinna and wanna have double plural marking (though not synchronically) similar to that hypothesized for knane above5.

5If this is the case, the order of the plural markers would be reversed here – e.g. hi-ne-na vs. k-na-ne. Deletion of the e in -ne is consistent with the regular apocope rules in the language; cf. §2.3.1.

Finally, there a question phrase hi hicpoko ‘how; in what manner’ – built on the verb hicpoko ‘do in a certain way’ – which marks the subject of the interrogative clause
6This -kl1 is quite distinct from the interrogative word.
327

in its pronominal preﬁx. Hicpoko is a complement-taking verb, requiring the lexical verb of the clause to be marked subordinate with either -le ‘subordinate’, as in (876) and (877), or with the anticipatory passive -ko, as in the indirect question in (878).

Hicpoko does not occur as a complement-taking verb outside of questions.7

12.3.5 Indeﬁnite pronouns
All of the basic interrogative words listed in Table12.1 above, with the exception of kl1, are made indeﬁnite using the ‘generalizing’ sufﬁx -kta; e.g. hinakakta ‘wherever’, hikta ‘however/in whatever manner’. For nominal question words, the indeﬁnite form also takes the emphatic marker -ko; e.g. kat1kokta ‘whoever (SGM)’, hinnakokta ‘whichever ones’, kl1ner1kokta ‘whatever (thing)’. Indeﬁnite interrogatives are especially common in indirect questions.
7It functions as a main verb in the derived form hicpokota ‘do in a certain manner’, which is an S=A ambitransitive verb.
328

With kl1 the indeﬁnite form is slightly different: kl1c¸ta (SGM), kloc¸ta (SGF), knac¸ta (PL); its meaning corresponds roughly to ‘what’s-it-called’ or ‘thing’. Kl1c¸ta is a noun and can take the article wa, which interrogative words cannot do. It often functions as a ﬁller, occupying the NP head position while the speaker searches for the appropriate noun (as in (879) below), but can also be used when an indeﬁnite noun is desired (as in (880) where it heads a nominal predicate). Unlike the indeﬁnite interrogatives, kl1c¸ta is not used as a subordinator.

12.3.6 Mirativity in questions
To express surprise, disbelief or dismay in all but one type of question (expected afﬁrmatives), the mirative enclitic =he is marked on the predicate or on the question word. The ‘interest’ enclitic =e is commonly used in this construction, but it is not obligatory. The mirative enclitic appears in examples (881) and (882) below.
(881) nhan1nro, hinakatkayihe? n-hn1nro hinaka-tka-yi=he 1SG-wife.of where-PFV-2SG=MIR ‘My wife, where have you gone?!’ (Tra54)

‘Where (on earth) have you been all this time, brother-in law?’ (PkN75)

12.4 Exclamative Clauses

The exclamative clause is introduced by the interrogative particle hi, and is typically marked with the mirative enclitic =he on the predicate. The latter is not obligatory, but when it is used in exclamative clauses (as opposed to interrogatives), it is pronounced with a high pitch (as in (884)) and optional vowel lengthening.8 If the mirative enclitic is not employed, the prosodic markers – high pitch and lengthening – are absent.

INTRG length.of-hair.of-EXTNS-QUOT-3SGF 3SGF treefrog.woman

‘How very beautiful, how long-haired that tree-frog woman was!’ (Hetn21)

8See also §2.5.3 regarding the exclamative intonation contour; and §4.3.4 regarding its use in the exclamative adjective construction.
330

In terms of their morphology, exclamative clauses look very much like interrogatives or negations. The exclamatives can be readily distinguished from the others by their prosody, however. Negations match, and interrogatives tend to match, the declarative contour; but exclamatives are distinct, as described in §2.5.
12.5 Commands
Yine has no dedicated imperative morphology or sentence structure, but makes use of aspect and mood morphology to create commands. Basic commands are formed using the ‘anticipatory’ sufﬁx -n1, which can be used with any person and number combination; these are discussed in §12.5.1. Indirect and desiderative commands utilize the temporal sufﬁx -ini and are discussed in §12.5.2. The negation of commands is addressed in §12.5.2, and §12.5.4 describes how the force of a command is reduced.
These imperative strategies cannot be used on non-verbal clauses, since the relevant morphology occurs only on verbal predicate heads (cf.§8.2.6.2). With verbal clauses, however, both the constituent order and the availability of inﬂectional categories (aspect, voice, modality) in these commands are the same as in the corresponding declaratives, though command clauses are typically much less morphologically complex. None of the constructions discussed in this section is unique to command clauses; one possible exception, the use of the evidential adverbial hima ‘reportedly’ in reported commands, is addressed in §12.5.5.
12.5.1 Basic commands
Basic commands are formally identical to future-event constructions; both are formed with the anticipatory sufﬁx -n1. This marker is fully compatible with all persons and numbers, so it is technically possible to direct a command at any person/number combination. Subjects are not dropped in imperative clauses, and their marking is identical to that found in declaratives. The command construction is therefore always ambiguous
331

between a future and imperative reading, and context is needed to supply the intended reading. Commands typically involve the exaggeration of the regular stress and intonation patterns in the clause (with greater exaggeration serving to increase the force of the command) but they do not have a distinct intonation pattern of their own.
The examples in (886)-(888) below, uttered sequentially within a narrative, provide illustration for commands directed at various person/number combinations: 1st person plural (886), 2nd singular (887) and 3rd singular (888).9 Although the translations provided here reﬂect the intended imperative reading, each of these could also be read as anticipatory declaratives. In all of these, the use of the perfective sufﬁx -tka expresses that the action is to be done right away.
(886) hayan1tka! ha-ya-n1-tka 1PL-go-ANTIC-PFV ‘Let’s go now!’ (E126.1)

(887) hi wa p1Sinikahan1tkal1 phan1r1

wale

there 3-go-OBLG-ANTIC-PFV 3SGM

‘Let him go away now.’ (E126.3)

The standard invitations to enter a house (889) and take a seat (890) further illustrate the imperative use of -n1:

9I do not have any clear examples of a 1st person singular command in my corpus, presumably because there are strong pragmatic pressures against addressing commands to oneself.
332

(889) patskotan1 p-hatskota-n1 2SG-climb-ANTIC ‘Come up.’
(890) pt1platan1 p-t1plata-n1 2SG-sit-ANTIC ‘Sit down.’
12.5.2 Indirect commands
Indirect, desiderative, and non-assertive commands are formed via the desubordination of a temporal/conditional clause: they involve the sufﬁxation of -ini to the predicate of an independent clause rather than a dependent one (see §13.2.2 and §8.2.6.2 for further discussion of -ini). This type of command construction is mostly used with non-second person in my corpus, but the example in (893) below illustrates how it may be used with a 2nd person referent.
(891) cani halikaka hewi r1Spakinitkana makl1c¸ine cani halikaka hewi r-hiSpaka-ini-tka-na makl1c¸i-ne now indeed here 3-exit-TEMP-PFV-3PL youth+SGM-PL ‘Now, indeed, let/have the boys leave from here.’ (E91)
(892) w1ylahinri w-hiyla-ha-ini-l1 1PL-kill-OBLG-TEMP-3SGM ‘Let’s kill him!’ (e64)
In (893), the -ini-marked predicate represents the continuation of instructions given by a shaman to the protagonist of the narrative. The anticipatory marker is used for the direct command in (893a), followed by the (non-subordinate) -ini clause in (893b), indicating the part of the instructions that is based on a prediction.

12.5.3 Negative commands / Prohibitives
There is no dedicated marker for prohibitives in the language. Commands are negated in the same way as statements, with the negative particle hi at the beginning of the clause. Example (887) above illustrates a prohibitive; additional ones are given below. (894) and (895) illustrate the negation of a command clause, and (896) and (897) show how, as with declarative clauses (see §12.1 above), in commands hi may be used with the article wa to associate negation with a particular referent (indicated with square brackets in the translation).

Like their positive counterparts, these examples all also admit a future reading in addition to the command one focused on here. This ambiguity arises because, as noted earlier, the ‘anticipatory’ sufﬁx -n1 is used for both future time and command constructions (see §8.2.6.2).
12.5.4 Polite commands / suggestions
As with statements (see §12.2 above), the force of a command can be reduced using the ‘attenuative’ sufﬁx -Ùi within the clause (i.e. either on the predicate or on any other phrase-heading constituent, as in (900), depending on the intended scope or focus). Examples of -Ùi in different types of command constructions are provided below. As the translations reﬂect, each of these sentences has the force more of a suggestion than a command.10
(898) hitaÙi p1ylatan1 hita-Ùi p-hiylata-n1 1SG-ATTEN 2SG-kill-ANTIC ‘(You should) kill me!’ (Srp18)
(899) wontapanr1Ùi w-honta-pa-n1-l1-Ùi 1PL-look-ELV-ANTIC-3SGM-ATTEN ‘Let’s go watch (TV).’
10Some background is perhaps in order for the sentence in (898). This sentence is taken from a story in which a man, wanting to kill a giant snake, is trying to lure it towards a trap. (898) is uttered to draw the snake towards him – without making it too angry.
335

(900) hewiÙi w1ramtinina hewi-Ùi w-hira-m-ta-ini-na here-ATTEN 1PL-drink-NONDUR-VCL-TEMP-CMPV
‘Let’s drink (it) up right here.’ (E125)

12.5.5 Reported commands
Reported commands, like reported statements, contain the evidential adverbial hima. I have very few examples of these in my corpus, the sentence given in (901) below being the clearest one. In this example, hima follows the command predicate. This construction is unusual for two reasons. First, it is the only situation where hima follows the predicate in a clause, rather than preceding it or being incorporated into it. Second, hima has the same emphatic stress and intonation that the command predicate has; this is worth noting because it is highly unusual for the evidential particle to be given phonological prominence in the clause. The main translation provided in (901) is intended to reﬂect the meaning the sentence clearly had in its context, but note that there is no inﬂection of any sort on hima; the alternative translation more closely reﬂects the typical sense of the evidential and the way it is normally translated in this grammar. The sentence was uttered after my invitation for a child to eat with me went unheard; the child’s sister then said more loudly:

(901) pnikan1 hima!

p-nika-n1

hima

2SG-eat-ANTIC QUOT

‘Eat, (she) said!’ (‘Eat, reportedly!’)

A proper discussion cannot be offered based on only one example; nonetheless, this example is suggestive that there are structural differences between reported statements and reported commands. In particular, I would like to point out that while (901) is a perfectly natural command, and represents a typologically common meaning for a reported evidential in a command (Aikhenvald 2004:250), it does not represent the
336

normal structure of a reported statement in Yine. Rather, the comparable declarative construction would place hima in the left periphery of the clause and/or as an incorporated element within the verb stem, as for example in (902): (902) pnikhimatan1
p-nika-hima-ta-n1 2SG-eat-QUOT-VCL-ANTIC ‘You will eat, reportedly.’
337

13 Clause Combining
This chapter describes the means by which clauses are linked into complex sentences in Yine, and the semantic relationships thus expressed.

13.1 Coordination
Coordination involves the linking of two clauses of equal syntactic status. Each clause could itself form a complete sentence on its own. The semantic relationships expressed via coordination in Yine are Addition, Contrast, Counterexpectation, Disjunction, Reason, and Result; each of these is described in the following subsections.
Any combination of verbal and/or nonverbal clauses may be linked through coordination, and there is no grammatical distinction made between same-subject and different-subject linked clauses.

13.1.1 Addition
The coordinating conjunction hawa can be used to link two or more clauses with an Addition relationship. It may or may not imply a temporal ordering between the two clauses; this is determined by context. Where a temporal sequence is expressed it is iconic, with the ﬁrst clause action preceding the second in time.
In (903), hawa is used to express related but temporally unordered events:

(903) s1cone kamr1tl1 wa koya hawa c¸ec¸ine nikÙi r1c¸hana

[ s1co-ne kamr1ta-l1 wa koya ]

hawa

[ woman-PL make-3SGM REF manioc.beer ] and

[ c¸ec¸i-ne nikÙi

r-hic¸ha-na ]

[ man-PL game.meat 3-search.for-3PL ]

‘The women made manioc beer and the men hunted game.’ (Fst44)

339

In (904) and (905), it links two clauses which together describe the same event:
(904) knoya wa s1co koseka hawa kaptotna c¸ec¸ine [ knoya wa s1co koseka ] hawa [ tortoise REF female lead ] and [ Ø-kaptota-na c¸ec¸i-ne ] [ 3-follow-3PL man-PL ] ‘The female tortoise leads and the males follow after.’ (Kno4)

(905) pimrine mala ya hawa pimrine hawaka ya

[ pimri-ne mala

ya ] hawa [ pimri-ne hawaka ya ]

‘Some went downriver and others went upriver.’ (Kch29)

The addition conjunction is compatible with a temporal sequence interpretation, with the clauses ordered iconically:

(906)

rethimatl1 wa wale yiner1

and [ 3SGM-see-QUOT-VCL-3SGM REF 3SGM people-3SGM ]

‘Then he drank piri piri1and began to be intoxicated, and he saw that man.’ (Hmn37)

In (907) there is an adversative relationship between the two hawa-linked clauses, and in (908) there is a contrast relationship. However, these interpretations arise from other clausal elements – here, frustrative modality and negative polarity, respectively.

There is a distinct coordinator used for contrast linking, as described in the next section.

13.1.2 Contrast
The Contrast coordinator, seyni, itself has the structure of a nonverbal clause, with a connective root seyo and the impersonal subject marker -ni; i.e. ‘but it is’. However, it is does not behave like a distinct clause in any obvious way: it is part of the same intonation unit as the clause it introduces, and does not occur as an independent or isolated clause anywhere in my corpus. It frequently appears sentence-initially to express contrast cohesion at the discourse level rather than the clause level, but unlike hawa, seyni does not link sub-clausal units.
Seyni may be used with an adversative sense, as in (909) and (910):

‘It is white-headed but (unlike the tapir which it resembles) it lives in the water.’ (Svm4)

or a concessive sense, as in (911):

‘We weren’t yet big then, but we knew (how to do) that work.’ (BfM72)

The Diccionario Piro has a subentry for seyni with a correlative concessive marker yahl1, as in (912):

(912) seyni . . . yahl1 . . . ‘although . . . nevertheless . . . ’2
but provides no textual example. I have not encountered this construction in my corpus, so can offer no further comment on it at this time.

13.1.3 Counterexpectation
The discourse linker maka is used in combination with the generalizing sufﬁx -kta (see §9.2.6) to express a relationship between two clauses, such that the second clause reveals that an explicit or implicit expectation in the ﬁrst clause was mistaken.

“I’ve killed a spider monkey just now’ he said, but (in fact) it was a lie.’ (Nwd44-5)

In (915), makakta introduces a clause revealing that what occurred in a dream was in fact true:

(915)

“Be sure to tie up a hammock for me” he said in her dream, but it was actually real.’ (PkN63-4)

343

13.1.4 Disjunction
There are a few examples, all provided below, of a disjunctive coordinator waka ‘or’ linking clauses in my corpus. In each example, waka links two clauses with opposite polarity values, and in each case the second clause is pro-clausal:

(916) hihe waneyyi waka hike?

[ hi=he wane-ya-yi ]

waka [ hike ]

[ NEG=MIR there/thus-APPL-2SG ] or [ no ]

‘Do you have it or not?’

(917) hihi waka hike? [ hihi ] waka [ hike ] [ yes ] or [ no ]
‘yes or no?’

(918) kihler1 waka hike? [ kihle-l1 ] waka [ hike ] [ good-3SGM ] or [ no ] ‘is it good or not?’ (f188)
All of these examples were obtained through direct elicitation and may in fact simply be calques of the Spanish ¿X o no? construction.
13.1.5 Reason
The morphologically complex linker hi rican13 ‘because’, introduces a clause that provides the reason, explanation, cause or motivation of the preceding clause. The Reason clause always follows the clause it modiﬁes. Although semantically dependent, Reason clauses are fully inﬂected clauses which, without hi rican1, could occur alone as a well-formed sentence.

[ 1-be.embarrassed-INTNS-VCL-ANTIC 1SG ]

‘Take care not to tell about me, because I will be embarrassed.’ (Wap44)

In (920), the Reason offers an explanation for the implicit warning in the preceding clause.

INTRG 3-be/do-PROP.NOM [ 3-be.alive ]

‘I wouldn’t (lit. won’t) do (that) to it, because it’s alive.’ (Pmm16)

There is no restriction against nonverbal predicates heading a Reason clause. For example, in (921), the Reason clause is headed by an attributive derivation of the adjective root yowiko- ‘strong’.

(921) wale hi n1mkata hiylaletl1 hi rican1 kyowikolni [ wale hi n-himkata hiyla-le-ta-l1 ] [ 3SGM NEG 1SG-be.able kill-SUBD-VCL-3SGM ]

‘Him I cannot kill, because he is strong.’ (Hmn53)

In (922), the Reason clause is headed by the possessive derivation of the pronoun hita ‘I’.

13.1.6 Result
As with Reason clauses, Result clauses are introduced with a complex connective, in this case wale Ùinan14 ‘for that reason, therefore’;5 in this situation the pronoun wale is anaphoric referring back to the preceding clause, in which the Result clause ﬁnds its own reason, cause or motivation.

13.2 Subordination
With subordination constructions, the linked clauses do not have equal syntactic status. They consist of a main (supporting) clause and one or more subordinate (dependent) clauses functioning to modify it. In Yine, subordination is used for Purpose, Temporal, Conditional, Location, and Manner relationships between clauses. These clauses cannot stand alone as independent sentences.

347

13.2.1 Purpose clauses
In a main clause, the predicate sufﬁx -pa (see § 9.2.1) expresses motion from the deictic centre, can have a temporal sense corresponding to past or future time, and often has purposive or intentional overtones. The same morpheme is used on action-nominalized subordinate predicates to express the purpose for which the action expressed in the main clause is done; this construction could be paraphrased in English as ‘towards being . . . ’, or ‘towards Verbing . . . ’.
Purpose clauses may have the same subject as the main clause (as in (927), (928)), or a different subject (as in (929)).

The verb hica may be employed to form a periphrastic Purpose construction as in
(930). This is only used with existence predicates in my corpus, headed by the adverb
wane.

‘Then the women, they also wanted there to be a lot of meat.’ (BfM17)

While Purpose clauses typically follow the matrix clause, it is possible for them to be centre-embedded:

(931) wale henekno wa napkakinripa wa knoc¸r1 [ wale heneka-no [ wa n-hapkaka-inri-pa ] [ 3SGM give-1SG [ REF 1SG-be.good.hunter-ACTN.NOM-ELV ]
wa knoc¸r1 ] REF hawk ]
‘He, the hawk, gave me to be a good hunter.’ (Gav25)

13.2.1.1 Negative purpose clauses
For negative purpose clauses, where the subordinate clause expresses something to be avoided, Yine employs a privative-derived predicate head (see §4.1.3) with the elative sufﬁx marked on it. The subordinate clause thus marked is linked to the purpose clause with the coordinating conjunction hawa.

13.2.2 Temporal and Conditional clauses
Yine employs the same subordinating sufﬁx -ini for both Temporal and Conditional clauses. The distinction between them is related to the likelihood of their occurring, with higher likelihood associated with a temporal sense and lower likelihood associated with a conditional sense. Thus events that are completed or begun at the reference time, or form part of the established context, are interpreted temporally unless additional clausal elements indicate a lesser certainty. Events that have not yet occurred are vague for the temporal and conditional senses, but are likewise often accompanied by additional clausal elements that indicate their degree of expectedness. In a similar way, the distinction between a Temporal clause expressing a point in time versus a time span at/during which the main clause action occurs relies on additional morphology and context.
In the absence of any aspectual or modality marking, -ini alone has a general temporal or generic conditional sense, representing a time at or during which, or a condition under which, a certain action (expressed in the main clause) naturally occurs. In this situation, the Temporal/Conditional clause typically precedes the main clause.

‘When it bites, only herbs are good for it.’ (Jix2)

It is not possible to directly sufﬁx -ini to a nonverbal predicate, so the verb hica ‘be/do’ is used with a copular function (as in (936)) and carries not only the Temporal morphology but also the subject cross-referencing and any other predicate morphology. As with the verbal Temporal/Conditional clauses above, these counterparts to a nonverbal main clause are vague between the generic condition or general time interpretations.

‘When/if the water is clear, the electric eel can be easily seen.’ (Pts8)

Multiple Temporal clauses may occur with a single supporting clause, as in (937). In this example the temporal adverbial wanekl1 ‘at that time’8 serves to reinforce the temporal linkage across the clauses.

‘So during that time, when she had left him behind, when another young man took her, at that time she truly was no longer hungry.’ (Nwd120)

By combining -ini with regular aspect, mood and directional morphology, more ﬁne-grained distinctions can be made concerning the relative timing of the temporal and main clause. These constructions show greater ﬂexibility in the relative order of the controlling and Temporal clauses, with the latter preceding, following, or being embedded in the main.

Prior action Morphology commonly used to express prior action on Temporal clauses includes the completive aspect sufﬁx -na, the perfective aspective sufﬁx -tka, and the elative/purposive sufﬁx -pa. Note that these morphemes do not provide tense distinctions; the temporal relationship is inferred from the information provided by aspectual morphology. They are not obligatory.
The completive sufﬁx -na indicates that the action expressed in the temporal clause was over before the one in the main clause occurred:

(938) hiyahni wa r1tnetininno psotsotaac¸imka nahyekan1na

[ hiyaho-ni

‘Then when it had shocked me, I nearly drowned.’ (Pts.019)

352

Perfective aspect (with -tka) is used to indicate that the Temporal action began before the action in the main clause, but does not specify whether it ﬁnished (i.e. point in time) or continues in overlap with the main clause (i.e. time span).
In example (939), -tka on the Temporal clause expresses a point in time prior to the main clause (with the result of its action extending into the time of the main clause):

(939) ruph1c¸ewnayehitinitkal1 wane Ùinr1 wa knoc¸r1 . . . [ r-hiph1c¸ewna-yehi-ta-ini-tka-l1 ] [ 3-appear-VICIN-VCL-TEMP-PFV-3SGM ] [ wane hima Ø-Ùina-l1 wa knoc¸r1 ] [ there/thus QUOT 3-say-3SGM REF sparrowhawk ] ‘When it appeared to him, the sparrowhawk said to him . . . ’ (Gavs7)
Example (940) similarly indicates a time span begun before the main clause action:

(940) wane nc¸emyana wa yahotkakinitkana [ wane n-c¸ema-ya-na ] [ there/thus 1SG-hear-APPL-3PL ] [ wa Ø-yahotakaka-ini-tka-na ] [ REF 3-ﬁght-TEMP-PFV-3PL ] ‘There, I heard them while they fought.’ (Kno23)
In example (941), the temporal clause, marked with -tka, expresses a point in time
that precedes the main clause action:

(941) wa hico ticinitka wa Sima hal1kta wane Ùinnitka n1rni . . .

[ wa hico t-hica-ini-tka

wa Sima ]

[ REF much 3SGF-be/do-TEMP-PFV REF ﬁsh ]

[ hal1kta wane Ø-Ùina-ni-tka n-hir1-ni ] [ probably there/thus 3-say-AFFCT-PFV 1SG-father.of-AFFCT ]

‘Then when the ﬁsh were abundant, (around then) my father said . . . ’ (BfM36)

Where the Temporal clause action precedes that of the main clause, but neither have occurred at the reference time, the elative sufﬁx -pa is used on the subordinate clause. Since the temporal clause by default precedes the main clause, the action in
353

the main clause is by inference also placed in future time, or after a change of state. Morphological marking of this is not obligatory.
In (942), the temporal clause is marked with -pa, but the main clause is not marked with -n1 (the modal sufﬁx used to mark anticipated events). In context, this sentence describes two events that (will) overlap temporally.

knoya ]

[ dead.wood 3SGF-search.for-PFV tortoise ]

‘When it should begin to lay its eggs, the tortoise searches for dead wood.’ (Kno58)

In (943), the main clause is marked with -n1. In context, this describes a scene in which the temporal clause will precede the main clause.

[ hita yohimata-n1-tka-yi ] [ 1SG hide-ANTIC-PFV-2PL ]

‘Now when we arrive at my mother’s, I will hide you.’ (Nwd83)

This is the same construction used for hypothetical conditional clauses (unreal conditionals that could possibly occur); see § 13.2.3 below.

Successive action To indicate that the action of the temporal clause follows that of the main clause, the imperfective aspect sufﬁx -wa is used on the temporal clause along with negative polarity to indicate that the subordinate action has not yet occurred at the reference time.

(Mshk76)
The equivalent semantic relationship can be expressed without Temporal marking
by using an incompletive-marked privative verb construction, with the negative auxil-
iary ma ‘not do’
(945) ma mapokan1wa wale tkamr1c¸enatatka [ Ø-ma m-hapoka-n1-wa ] [ 3-not.do PRIV-arrive-ANTIC-IMPFV ] [ wale t-kamr1-c¸e-na-ta-tka ] [ 3SGM 3SGF-make-FREQ-DUR-VCL-PFV ] ‘Before it came, she made them.’ (B112)
Speakers conﬁrmed that ma mapokan1wa is equivalent in meaning to hi rapokiniwa
‘when he/it has not yet arrived’, the latter being the same construction as was illustrated
in example (944) above.

13.2.3 Hypothetical conditionals
Hypothetical conditionals, which express a condition which has not occurred (is unreal) but could do so (is possible), bear the same morphology as future time temporal clauses, i.e. -ini plus -pa. As expected, interpretation of these constructions relies on context and inference to distinguish the intended sense.

13.2.4 Negative and Imaginary conditionals
Unreal conditionals that either have not occurred (negative conditionals) or are highly unlikely to occur (imaginary conditionals) are not expressed through subordination in Yine. For these types of conditionals, two clauses are juxtaposed and one or both clauses is/are marked with frustrative morphology.

13.2.4.1 Negative conditional
Example (948) illustrates a negative conditional. The conditional clause is headed by the negative auxiliary verb ma ‘not do; lack doing’, and often both it and the controlling clause have frustrative morphology in them (on the predicate or on a focused element). There is no overt linker between them, but phonologically the two clauses belong to a single intonation phrase.

‘If she hadn’t escaped, I would have eaten her.’ (Tra127)

13.2.4.2 Imaginary conditional
The sentence in (950) illustrates an imaginary conditional, with two apposed clauses united within a single intonation phrase. The (presumably) impossible nature of the condition expressed in the ﬁrst clause is expressed through the frustrative modality sufﬁx, -maka. The frustrative marker in the second clause, hosted by the focused object pronoun pica, expresses the speaker’s (seemingly) impossible desire to marry that particular referent – in this case, a tree frog he hears singing in his dream.

13.2.5 Location/Manner clauses
Both Location and Manner subordinate clauses are formed with the adverbializing sufﬁx -waka. The applicative -ya appears to be obligatory with these, but its function in this construction is not clear.
Examples (952)-(954) illustrate the use of -(ya)-waka to create a Manner adverbial clause:

(952) wanera pwanata pica seprolo hicyawaka

[ wane-la

p-hwanata pica ]

[ there/thus-IMP.NONDECL 2SG-live 2SG ]

‘There you are, acting like a crazy person!’ (Sen15)

The Location sense is far more common that the Manner sense in my corpus. Examples (955)-(957) provide typical illustrations; note that the same morphology is used as with the Manner clauses above.

13.3 Complementation
Yine employs three types of complementation, based on the morphological structure of the predicate heading the complement clause: non-ﬁnite complements, which are morphologically marked as subordinate and cannot take a subject marker (§13.3.1); paratactic complements, in which two potentionally independent clauses occur in apposition, one of which is a semantic argument of the other (§13.3.2); and nominalized
359

complements (§13.3.3). The terminology in this section is largely drawn from Noonan (2007).
13.3.1 Non-ﬁnite complements
As presented in §8.1.1, there is a subset of verbs in Yine that express aspectual and modal notions, as well as want-type desiderative senses. These verbs can take a non-ﬁnite complement clause as their notional object. The predicate heading this complement type must be verbal, takes a complementizing sufﬁx -le or the anticipatory passive -ko, and cannot take a pronominal preﬁx. This construction is typically used with same-subject complements, but different-subject complements may also be constructed this way with certain types of complement-taking predicate. With samesubject complements, the subject of both the controlling and the complement clause is marked only once, as a pronominal preﬁx on the controlling verb; all sufﬁxal morphology, including aspect, mood, and object and plural argument indexing, appears only on the complement predicate. The object marking may either express the object of the complement clause (with same-subject constructions), or the subject of the complement clause (with different-subject constructions).
This construction could also be analysed as a complex predicate in an auxiliation construction, rather than complementation. The fact that the pronominal preﬁxes and sufﬁxes frame the construction, and in fact a sufﬁxal 3PL marker on the second predicate could be used to index the subject of the main predicate, is evidence in favor of the complex predicate analysis against which I have no strong argument. However, at least one clause-level modiﬁer, the adverb wane, can intervene between them, as can the article wa, suggesting that there is a syntactic boundary between them. Additionally, there is some indication that this construction can be used with different-subject complementation, which is more expected of complementation than auxiliation. It is primarily because the two predicates are separable that I analyse these as complementation constructions, but further research is needed to determine whether this is the
360

analysis best suited to the structure.

13.3.1.1 Aspectual predicates
Aspectual predicates express phasal properties of an event, such as the beginning, repetition, or end of the action denoted by the complement predicate. They are exclusively same-subject. Examples (958)-(961) illustrate a range of aspectual notions expressed by this construction in Yine.

13.3.1.2 Ability/Permission
The verb himkata ‘be able to’ is a modal predicate expressing permission or ability. It takes a non-ﬁnite complement clause which is obligatorily same-subject.
(962) and (963) illustrate the permission sense of himkata.

13.3.1.3 Immediate perception - general/non-current
Predicates of immediate perception may take a non-ﬁnite complement, when they describe a perception that is not currently happening (cf. the participial constructions that express current perception, described in § 13.3.3.3 below).

‘Thus they thought to plant (crops) for food’ (Shj29)

13.3.1.4 Manner of being or doing
Yine employs the non-ﬁnite complementation construction to express the manner in which something is done. There are two controlling predicates used for this purpose: the (optionally) complement-taking verb hica ‘be, do’, and the manner predicate hicpoko in conjunction with the interrogative particle hi.
With hica, the complex sentence has the sense of summarizing how something happened, and is often used to close off a section of narrative describing a particular situation that has come to a close.

13.3.1.5 Non-ﬁnite desiderative predicates
The verb hal1ka ‘want’ may take a non-ﬁnite complement expressing the desired event. These constructions are most frequently same-subject in my corpus, but a few examples indicate that a different subject may be expressed through the pronominal sufﬁx on the complement. Hal1ka may also take a same-subject participial (see § 13.3.3.4 below); the difference between non-ﬁnite and participial complements is not clear, but may lie in the degree of perceived control the subject has over the realization of the desired event, or the perceived likelihood of it coming to be.

Frustrative morphology may accompany the non-ﬁnite complement to express deference of control over the desired event, as in (977).

13.3.2 Paratactic complementation
Paratactic complementation involves the juxtaposition of two ﬁnite, potentially independent clauses, with no marker of complementation between them, but they nevertheless form a semantic unit: the second clause functions as a semantic (though not syntactic) argument of the ﬁrst. Each clause has its own subject, whether or not they are coreferential.
Yine employs paratactic complementation with predicates of utterance, propositional attitude, and knowledge, as well as with desiderative predicates that are presented as statements with no implication made of their likelihood.
Speech reports can be considered a special type of paratactic complement, and are treated in § 13.3.2.2 below.

13.3.2.1 Propositional attitude and Knowledge predicates
In (978) the second clause is a semantic argument of the predicate halica ‘believe’. The object sufﬁx on the latter cross-references the believed participant, not the clause expressing the believed proposition.

(978) hi hima ralicl1na wa s1wa r1ylatyanna wa hepi mhenokl1nni

hi hima r-halica-l1-na

[ wa s1wa

3-kill-APPL-CMPV-3PL REF two jaguar-PL-AFFCT ]

‘They did not believe him (that) the anteater killed two jaguars’ (Oso28)

In (979), however, it is not as clear what the object sufﬁx marks. It may indicate a dummy object, with the second clause in apposition – i.e. ‘I expected it, I caught a
366

catﬁsh’ – or it may cross-reference the second clause itself. Since object marking is not strictly obligatory in Yine, it is not necessary to postulate a dummy object here, and the simpler analysis is that the sufﬁx indexes the second clause. Under this analysis, these attitude and knowledge predicates may take either direct objects (O), which are indexed in the pronominal sufﬁx as in (979), or extended arguments (E), which are not indexed, as in (978) above.
(979) hita kahwakl1 kayonalo nkoseta hita kahwaka-l1i [ kayonalo n-koseta ]i 1SG expect-3SGM [ doncella 1PL-catch ] ‘I expected (that) I had caught a doncella (catﬁsh sp.).’ (Pts32)
What is clear, however, is that the object sufﬁx does not cross-reference the subject of the second clause; that is, this is not an example of raising the dependent subject to object of the matrix clause. Consider example (980). The subject of the second clause is feminine, and if it were raised to object of kahwaka the object sufﬁx on the latter should be -lo. However, only masculine, not feminine, agreement is possible:
(980) a. wale kahwakl1 kihlero wa himole wale kahwaka-l1 kihle-lo wa himole 3SGM expect-3SGM good-3SGF REF kin ‘He is waiting/hoping for his sister to be well.’ (e28)
b. * wale kahwakloi kihlero wa himolei wale kahwaka-lo kihle-lo wa himole 3SGM expect-3SGF good-3SGF REF kin (cf. wale kahwaklo ‘he expected her’)
13.3.2.2 Speech reports
Verbs of saying, reporting, asking, etc. in Yine are ambitransitive. When transitive, they take the addressee, not the speech act, as their object. The speech act is simply adjoined to the clause containing the utterance, and is never indexed on the predicate. By far the most common speech report verb in my corpus is Ùina ‘say’, which may be
367

used with various types of reported speech, including statements (981)-(982), exclamations (983), and questions (984), also (986) and (987) below. Questions may also be introduced with another speech report verb, hepomha ‘ask’, either in apposition to Ùina as in (984) or alone as in (985).

13.3.3 Nominalized complements
Yine frequently makes use of the action nominalizer -inri as a complementation strategy. Since the nominalized clause is not itself a well-formed independent clause, these constructions may be analysed as true complements rather than juxtaposed clauses. The fact that they are sometimes, but not always, cross-referenced on the supporting predicate suggests that they may have either O or E status in the matrix clause.
Action nominalizations express relationships of knowledge, attitude, immediate perception, and desirability between clauses.
13.3.3.1 Knowledge predicates
Predicates of knowledge and the acquisition of knowledge may take either paratactic or nominalized complements. The semantic difference between the two is not clear, but it can be noted that action nominalizations are often used where the complement is the notional equivalent of a nonverbal clause (i.e. expresses identity, equation, etc – see §11.5). Since nonverbal predicates cannot be action nominalized, the verb hica
369

‘be/do’ is used, with a copular function, to host the relevant morphology. Examples (988)-(989) illustrate this use of nominalization with predicates of (the acquisition of) knowledge. The nominalization is treated as O and indexed in the predicate in (988), but not in (989), where it is treated as E.

13.3.3.2 Propositional attitude
A similar observation can be made about the propositional attitude constructions illustrated in (990) and (991), with the nominalization of hica expressing the notional equivalent of a nonverbal predicate. In both of these examples, the controlling verb, kahwaka, bears object marking indexing the nominalized complement.

13.3.3.3 Immediate perception - current
Where an immediate perception construction refers to an event that is ongoing at the reference time, it is common for the complementation to be expressed through the action nominalization (cf. non-current perception expressed with a non-ﬁnite complement, §13.3.1.3 above).

13.3.3.4 Action-nominalized desiderative predicates
Action-nominalized complements are employed with a desiderative predicate where the complementation is the notional equivalent of a nonverbal clause, as in (995)-(996), or in same-subject constructions where the desired event is viewed as unlikely or relies heavily on another for its realization (997)-(998). These constructions may be samesubject or different-subject.

‘They also wanted there to be a lot of meat’ (BfM17)

In (997), the subject of the desiderative predicate wants to ﬂy, but in context, in order to do so he requires a gift of magical clothing from a hawk.
