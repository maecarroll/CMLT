The Guapor√©-Mamor√© region as a linguistic area
Mily Crevels and Hein van der Voort
The Guapor√©-Mamor√© region is one of the world‚Äôs linguistically most diverse regions, with over 50 languages representing eight different stocks and 11 genetic isolates. In spite of the fact that these languages diverge enormously at the lexical level, they do seem to share a considerable number of structural features. Most of these languages are seriously endangered, but fortunately recent research initiatives have contributed to their documentation and led to new insights and data. This paper reviews the present research situation with regard to these languages and examines possible areal linguistic relationships in the Guapor√©Mamor√© region.
 Introduction
The Guapor√© and Mamor√© are two great rivers of the Southwestern Amazon region. The Guapor√© River forms the border between the Brazilian federal state of Rondonia and the Bolivian departments of Santa Cruz and Beni, where the river is called It√©nez. It winds slowly through endless forested and often flooded lowland in a northwesterly direction. At Puerto Avaroa on the Bolivian side and Surpresa on the Brazilian side, it turns north and flows into the Mamor√© River that descends from the Bolivian Andean highlands in the south. Shortly after Guayaramer√≠n/Guajar√°Mirim, the Mamor√© joins with the Beni River to form the Madeira River, which continues for roughly 1000 kilometers before it flows into the Amazon River close to Manaus.
The Guapor√© and Mamor√© rivers together drain a part of the tropical lowlands where traditionally over 50 different indigenous languages are spoken. Since these languages represent numerous language families and unclassified languages that may be isolates, it is one of the linguistically most diverse regions of South America. This linguistic diversity, which includes, besides languages from the Arawakan, Chapacuran, Jabutian, Nambikwaran, Panoan, Tacanan, and Tupian families no less than 11 unclassified languages, is highly threatened with extinction. The speakers‚Äô numbers have dwindled under the ecological, physical, social and Western cultural pressures of the national societies. Nowadays more than half of the languages have less than 50 speakers and one third has less than 10 speakers.

 Mily Crevels and Hein van der Voort
The existing classifications of the Guapor√©-Mamor√© languages are often based on thin evidence, since the languages in question lacked thorough professional documentation and description. Fortunately, the past decennium has seen a considerable increase in the number of linguists conducting fieldwork in the region, producing grammars and dictionaries of the different languages. Several initiatives (e.g., those of Muysken and of Wetzels in The Netherlands, and Moore in Brazil) have led to longterm descriptive projects on Guapor√©-Mamor√© languages, and from comparisons of the preliminary results it now becomes clear that our ideas about the relationships between the languages of the region have to be revised. It appears that, apart from new insights concerning certain genetic relationships, the accumulated data also point to relationships of linguistic diffusion. In the present chapter we will tentatively claim that the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region is a linguistic area in the traditional sense, possibly with several sub-areas.
The languages that will be mentioned in the following are numbered and listed in Table 2 below. The numbers in the list correspond to the numbers on Map 1, which provides the geographic location of those languages.
 Traditional cultures and habitat
The indigenous cultures on the right and left side of the Guapor√© are markedly different. The Guapor√© or It√©nez River forms a border between traditional indigenous cultural areas. The culture area on the Bolivian side is known as the Moxos or MoxoChiquito cultural complex (L√©vi-Strauss 1948, Denevan 1966, Crevels 2002). The culture area on the Brazilian side is often referred to as the Guapor√© cultural complex (L√©vi-Strauss 1948, Galv√£o 1960).
On the basis of material cultural traits, L√©vi-Strauss (1948) divides the Guapor√© cultural complex into two parts: the Chapacura area to the west of the Branco River and the Tup√≠ area to its East. In her comparative ethnohistorical work Maldi (1991: 225) suggests that certain Chapacura-speaking groups in Brazil originated from the disintegrated Jesuit missions on the Bolivian side. Furthermore, she defines a specific section of Levi-Strauss‚Äô Tup√≠ area as the Marico cultural complex of Rondonia. The Marico cultural complex includes not only cultures of Tup√≠-speaking peoples, but also of speakers of Jabutian languages and of isolated languages, and is characterized by a combination of the following traits:
L seminomadic swidden agriculture combined with hunting and gathering L relatively small egalitarian societies L territorial subgroups that often bear animal names L territorial subgroups could form alliances with others across linguistic borders L religion involves shamanism and hallucinogenic substances L material culture is characterized among others by the marico, a crochet carrying
net made of the fibres of specific palmtree leaves

The Guapor√©-Mamor√© region as a linguistic area 
L the local fermented alcoholic brew called chicha, which is a drink mainly based on maize, yam, manioc or fruits such as banana is mashed, fermented and sifted in a specific way (Caspar 1975: 45, Maldi 1991: 243)
In spite of the lack of genealogical relationships between many languages to the right of the Guapor√© River, the cultures of their speakers share many of the traits listed here. These cultural correspondences are probably to a large extent due to the frequent contacts and intermarriage between neighbouring groups. Such interethnic contacts were not just confined to directly connected river basins, but they also took place over land between groups on different headwaters. The headwaters of, for example, the Corumbiara, Branco and Mekens rivers are very close to each other and to those of the Pimenta Bueno River (see Map 1). The combination of cultural traditions and ecological circumstances under which the peoples of this region subsisted did not allow for populations much larger than several thousand individuals. Nevertheless, a number of the cultural traits listed above are also found in other regions.
Note that the Marico cultural complex as defined by Maldi does not match exactly with the eastern part of the Guapor√© cultural complex as defined by Galv√£o, whereas it corresponds more to L√©vi-Strauss‚Äô Tup√≠ culture area. The Nambikwara (D7C8?AM7H7D) were considered neither by L√©vi-Strauss nor Maldi to form part of a specific cultural complex. Galv√£o, however, did include the Nambikwara, who maintained trade relations with Marico culture groups, in the Guapor√© complex. Galv√£o also included the Parec√≠ (7H7M7A7D) and the Irantxe (KD9B7II?<?;:), whereas he excluded the Karo (JKF√≠H7C7H7C7), Gavi√£o and Suru√≠-Pait√©r (both JKF√≠CED:√ä) from the Guapor√© cultural complex.
The cultures to the left of the Guapor√© River, i.e. the Moxo-Chiquito area according to L√©vi-Strauss, which may be regarded as an intermediate area between Amazonian and Andean cultures, are characterized by:
L raised field agriculture, hunting, gathering and fishing L more stratified societies divided into large villages L religion based on a jaguar cult
Throughout this region thousands of artificial mounds were built, which along with hundreds of rectangular ponds and canals formed part of a complex cultivation and irrigation system. As pointed out by Erickson (2000a, 2000b), William Denevan‚Äôs 1961 discovery of the massive prehispanic earthworks over vast areas in Moxos led to a complete change in perspective regarding cultural development in the Amazon Basin. A traditional archaeological approach of the Amazon points out the environmental limitations to cultural development, predominance of simple societies (bands and tribes), and subsistence systems based on hunting, gathering, and fishing with some limited slash and burn agriculture (Steward and Faron 1959). The type of prehispanic raised field agriculture as documented in Denevan (1966), however, shows that

 Mily Crevels and Hein van der Voort
intensive agriculture was indeed possible and that large, dense populations were supported in these areas.
Even though the Guapor√© and Moxo-Chiquito culture areas are quite distinct, there is archaeological and historical evidence for exchange across the Guapor√© River. As an example, the rocker stones used to crush maize, which are encountered among the Karitiana (Storto p.c.) and in the oral traditions of Jabuti-speaking groups (van der Voort 2006), possibly originate from Bolivia, where they are encountered among, for example, the Itonama.
Finally, it is important to consider the Tapaj√≥s-Madeira cultural complex (Galv√£o 1960), also known as the Ji-Paran√°/Roosevelt cultural complex (Maldi 1991), which is located more to the northeast of the Marico cultural complex. There were contacts between groups on the headwaters of the Pimenta Bueno River and the Tup√≠Mond√™ speaking Cinta Larga, Suru√≠-Pait√©r and Zor√≥ peoples on the headwaters of the Roosevelt River, to the east (see Map 1). Table 1 lists the different culture areas discussed in the present section.

 History of contact and present situation
On the left side of the Guapor√© or It√©nez, i.e. the Bolivian side, contact with Western culture started in the sixteenth century when the first Spanish expeditions with explorers and conquistadors entered the Moxos area in search of El Dorado‚Äôs gold. They were immediately followed by the slavery expeditions from the Santa Cruz area that came in search of human work force. Although these expeditions usually did not stay on for a prolonged period in the Moxos area, they lasted long enough to contaminate the native populations with epidemic diseases and disturb the demographic balance by taking away young and strong men. By the end of the seventeenth century, the Jesuits, in search of souls, formed the third group to enter Moxos. The often very inhumane

ways, in which the local clergy and administrators who ruled the missions after the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767 treated the indigenous inhabitants of the missions, has been sufficiently illustrated in, among others, Alcide d‚ÄôOrbigny‚Äôs descriptions of his travels in Bolivia (1839). Mission culture came to an end when the rubber boom of the late nineteenth century brought white, criollo and mestizo settlers in sufficient numbers to overwhelm the indigenous culture ‚Äì in so far as it still existed. Although the natives remained, they became marginalized to the Westernized society that had developed in the core regions, in which fluency in Spanish, affluence, and light skin had become the main values. Obviously, four centuries of contact with Western culture have wiped out traditional cultures to a great extent, causing many of the languages to become obsolete or disappear in the process (cf. Crevels 2002).
Up to the 1990s the relationship between the indigenous groups and the Bolivian government was based on exclusion from mainstream society, and sometimes even resulted in extermination. In the early 1990s, however, this relationship changed. The State started to take the demands of the native groups into account. The 1990 and 1996 Indian marches held in support of territorial claims have led to the recognition of the fact that the struggle for territory lies at the base of all of the indigenous demands and should, therefore, be treated with priority. By the end of the millennium, Amazonian Bolivia had not only captured the attention of the State but also that of the civilian society. Within the context of the decentralization of the administration on the one hand, and the growing interest of NGOs on the other hand, the attention for regional and local indigenous problems has grown considerably. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen what will be the real impact of these developments in the long run.
The right side of the Guapor√©, i.e. the Brazilian side, was confronted with Western culture really only in the beginning of the twentieth century, with the rubber boom. In the 1940s the government planned to open up the Amazon region for settlers from the south and in the 1960s a highway was built that facilitated immigration on a relatively large scale. This has led to considerable population losses among the Indians and consequent loss of traditional cultures, although the memories of traditional culture are still vivid, and eyewitness accounts can still be recorded. The Brazilian side of the region is now deforested for about 50% and many of the traditional indigenous lands are occupied by ranchers. The Indians nowadays live mostly on indigenous reserves in the more remote parts of Rondonia. Even though these parts, including the reserves, are under external political and ecological pressure (the latter both internal due to overpopulation and external due to illegal invasions and destruction of the surrounding forest), the inhabitants have more possibilities to maintain their lifestyle on the reserves than in the slums of the local boomtowns. It is a fortunate development that the Brazilian Indians are becoming interested in protecting and revitalising their traditional cultures and languages. The Brazilian constitution reflects an enlightened view with regard to indigenous peoples, even if the local policies and actual circumstances do not always reflect this view.

 Overview of the languages of the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region
In the sixteenth century, when the Spaniards first arrived in what today is the Bolivian part of the region, the area was populated by some 400 groups or tribes with an estimated total of 350,000 individuals who spoke about 39 different languages, most of which belonged to the Arawakan family (Baptista Morales 1995: 71). Today only 22 languages are still spoken in this part of the region, of which three belong to the Arawakan family, one to the Chapacuran family, three are Panoan, five Tacanan and two Tupian, both belonging to the Tup√≠-Guaran√≠ subfamily. The unclassified languages of this part of the region are Leko, Moset√©n/Chimane, Yurakar√©, Canichana, Movima, Cayubaba, Itonama and Chiquitano (Bolivian lowland languages not mentioned here fall outside of the Guapor√©-Mamor√© basin or are extinct). Several of these languages only have a handful of speakers, and Canichana has most probably become extinct very recently. In Rondonia and adjacent parts, on the Brazilian side of the river, the majority of the languages (originally about 35) are still extant. There is one Panoan language, three or four Chapacuran languages, 16 Tupian languages that belong to six different subfamilies, four Nambikwaran languages, two Jabutian languages and Rikbakts√°, which probably belong to the Macro-Ge stock, and four unclassified languages: Aikan√£, Kano√™, Kwaza, and Irantxe. Consequently, the original linguistic diversity is still largely intact here, even though speaker numbers may be low.
Recently a number of language descriptions have become available; a fair number are on their way and are partly accessible through recent articles and personal communication with field linguists. Table 2 lists the languages of the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region with information about their classification, demographic data and speaker numbers. Furthermore, the table lists the comprehensive descriptive output of the researchers that have been working on the languages most recently. Demographic data and speaker numbers are adapted from Crevels and Adelaar (2000‚Äì2006). In several parts of Rondonia, traces have been found of existing populations that avoid contact, and it is not known which languages are spoken by them. In the table the unidentified language of one of these groups is listed, but probably there are more. Also one pidgin language is listed, that is used in the contact between the Kano√™ and Akuntsu of the Omer√© region. Traditionally these groups avoid each other, but due to attempts by surrounding landowners to exterminate them, they were forced to share the protection of a small island of forest and maintain some level of contact. Map 1 shows the probable geographical location of the Rondonian languages at the time of contact, which does not necessarily correspond completely to the present location due to decimation and displacement of many indigenous groups after contact with Western society. The location of the Bolivian languages coincides more or less with the original location at the time of contact, or with the Jesuit missions in which some of the groups were brought together in the seventeenth and eighteenth century. The concentration of different groups in the Jesuit missions resulted in the rapid loss of their tribal organization and linguistic and cultural differences. Nevertheless, nowadays most extant groups are still

to be found in the area where the Spaniards first contacted them. The numbers on Map 1 correspond with the languages listed in Table 2.

 The state of documentation
Early ethnographic explorers, such as Nordenski√∂ld (1915), expressed their concern about the state of documentation of the indigenous languages and cultures in the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region. In view of Western culture encroaching upon the native cultures, Nordenski√∂ld found that ethnographically interested persons should urgently take up research in the region. Many linguistic publications about the Bolivian side of the region are from this period, such as de Cr√©qui-Montfort and Rivet (1914a) on Movima, (1914b) on Canichana, (1914c, 1917‚Äì1920) on Cayubaba, and (1916, 1918) on Itonama. These publications present an analysis of certain grammatical aspects of the respective languages, based on earlier word lists and religious texts from the eighteenth and nineteenth century, of which the reliability is generally doubtful.
In the 1950s, after the devastating epidemics of the previous decades, BeckerDonner (1955) considered the majority of languages and cultures on the Brazilian side to be endangered, with Kano√™, with only a handful of speakers known to her, as a dramatic example. One of the reasons to publish her preliminary research based on incomplete data in her 1955 article was to alert the scientific community about the necessity of documentation. Nevertheless, this article continued to be one of the most important published sources on the cultures of the region and on the Kano√™ and Aikan√£ languages during the following decades.
In the 1960s more research was initiated on the Brazilian side by missionary linguists of the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), some of which led to thorough work, such as Kroeker (2001) on Nambikwara, and by the New Tribes Mission, which resulted in a description of Wari‚Äô (Everett and Kern 1997). Other researchers such as Price (1972, 1978) and, in the 1970s, Moore (1984) produced important work on Nambikwara culture and the Gavi√£o language, respectively.

The Guapor√©-Mamor√© region as a linguistic area 
In the Bolivian part of the region, the New Tribes Mission became active in 1942, only two years after its foundation. Today they still work with eight groups in Bolivia, six of which are located in the Guapor√©-Mamor√© area: Trinitario, Araona, Ese Ejja, Yuki, Chimane, and Yurakar√©. SIL researchers became active in the mid 1950s and stayed on until 1985. In this time span they worked on 18 languages in Bolivia, of which 13 pertain to the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region: Baure, Ignaciano, Ch√°cobo, Pacahuara, Araona, Cavine√±a, Ese Ejja, Tacana, Sirion√≥, Cayubaba, Chiquitano, Itonama, and Movima. Resulting publications include, among others, Key (1967, 1975) on Cayubaba, Camp and Liccardi (1967a,b) on Itonama, and Judy and Judy (1962, 1967) on Movima.
Finally, heightened awareness of the issue of endangered languages and subsequent increase of funding brought a considerable number of researchers to the region in the 1990s and at the beginning of the new millennium. The results of their work are now becoming available, such as Gabas (1999) on Karo, Storto (1999) on Karitiana, Galucio (2001) on Mekens, Telles (2002) on Lakond√™/Latund√™, van der Voort (2004) on Kwaza, Sakel (2004) on Moset√©n, Bacelar (2004) on Kano√™, Araujo (2004) on Saban√™, Guillaume (2004) on Cavine√±a, van Gijn (2006) on Yurakar√©, Haude (2006) on Movima, and Danielsen (2007) on Baure.
 Reconstructing the history and classification of the Guapor√©-Mamor√© languages
Table 2 reflects the genealogical classification of the Guapor√©-Mamor√© languages in so far as there is relatively sound evidence. Due to the scarcity of data at that time available, Greenberg‚Äôs (1987) attempt at classifying all languages of the Americas resulted in an at times premature classification of the languages of the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region. For example, the evidence for the relatedness of the Jabutian languages Arikap√∫ and Djeoromitxi is relatively sound, but the value of the claim that they belong to the Macro-Ge stock, which originates from Nimuendaj√∫ (2000), was not really substantiated. Only since recent field research has led to a completer documentation of the Jabutian languages, this ‚Äòmacro‚Äô classification can be confirmed (Ribeiro and van der Voort fc.). The new data furthermore confirm the suspicion of Caspar (1955) that Mashubi, which used to be considered an extinct third member of the Jabutian family, in reality, is the same language as Arikap√∫. Moreover, Chiquitano, spoken in the Bolivian lowlands in the Santa Cruz Department and considered an isolate until now, may be Macro-Ge (Adelaar p.c., Ribeiro p.c.).
Furthermore, the usual characterization in the literature of Aikan√£, Kano√™ and Kwaza as isolated languages is, in the absence of detailed evidence, worth just as much as the various proposals for their specific classification. In a recent article, van der Voort (2005b) made an attempt at the classification of these languages on the basis of new evidence, such as provided by Bacelar (2004). The data suggest that there is no conclusive proof for ancient genealogical relationships among these three languages. It seems equally likely that the languages are true isolates that underwent each other‚Äôs influence during many centuries.

The research by Telles (2002) has further completed the picture of the Nambikwaran family. Even though Latund√™ is absent in Lowe‚Äôs recent overview (1999), it is undeniably a member of the family and it belongs with Lakond√™ and Tawand√™ to one of the branches of Northern Nambikwaran. The Latund√™ were first contacted by Aikan√£ in 1975 and by Westerners in 1976. The question whether the Northern Nambikwaran languages, that include also Mamaind√™ and Nagarot√™, represent distinct languages or a dialect complex, has not yet been settled. In the present chapter we represent Northern Nambikwara only by Latund√™ and Lakond√™.
Furthermore, ongoing research by associates of the Museu Goeldi in Bel√©m is leading to improvements of the internal classification of the Tupian family, for example by inclusion of the language of the recently contacted (1995) Akuntsu in the Tup√≠Tupar√≠ subfamily. Together with a handful of Kano√™ this small group had been avoiding contact for decades, during which local ranchers committed several massacres against them. In 1995, however, personnel of FUNAI (Funda√ß√£o Nacional do √çndio, the Brazilian governmental department of indigenous affairs) succeeded in establishing permanent contact with them (dos Santos 1996, 2000). Furthermore, the vowel inventories of Karo and Purubor√° suggest that these languages could belong to the same subfamily (Galucio and Gabas Jr. 2002). Finally, there may still be speakers of the Arik√©m language, which belongs to the same subfamily as Karitiana.
When consulting older sources on Rondonia, it is useful to remember that the language of the Karipuna used to belong to the Panoan family. What happened to this group is not known; they may have become extinct due to epidemics following contact with the workers on the Madeira-Mamor√© railway. It is possible that the present Tup√≠-Guaran√≠ speaking Karipuna represent a group that immigrated from Amazonas recently.
Other groups of the region also have become extinct in historical times, or have moved away, destination unknown. One such group is Palmella. Their language represented the only Cariban language of the region and the southernmost Cariban language of the family. The Palmellas were probably brought from the Guianas to Bolivia by Westerners, and are supposed to have moved to the right side of the Guapor√© River after the Jesuit mission San Miguel on the Baures River was burned by the Portuguese in 1762. Word lists were recorded by Fonseca (1880‚Äì81), Nordenski√∂ld (n.d.), and Becker-Donner (1956), who met them at Pedras Negras in Brazil, located close to the mouth of the Colorado River, but nothing else is known about the fate of this group. In present-day sociological sources (e.g., Ricardo 1991) the name Paumelenhos is sometimes found for an ethnic group on the right side of the S√£o Miguel River. Apparently there is no contact with this group and their ethnicity and language remain unknown.
There are several other uncontacted groups in the south of Rondonia, about the languages of which nothing is known. One of these groups that avoid contact numbers approximately 100 members, and their material culture is characterized by exceptionally long bows (Ricardo 1991: 447). That is probably the reason why some have speculated that the language belongs to the Tup√≠-Guaran√≠ family (dos Santos 2000). The Bolivian Sirion√≥ (JKF√≠=K7H7D√≠) also have exceptionally long bows and on Nimuendaj√∫‚Äôs map (1981) some Sirion√≥ pockets are located close to the Guapor√© River.

The Guapor√©-Mamor√© region as a linguistic area 
In 1996, the rancher Dalafini in the municipality of Chupinguaia, Southeastern Rondonia, ordered his men to open fire on the members of an uncontacted group on the land he claimed. Hereafter a bulldozer attempted to extinguish the traces of the wrecked village to destroy evidence. Ever since, FUNAI personnel have been attempting to establish contact, but the sole surviving member of the group does not allow them to come close. It is not known what language the man speaks, but the material culture of his original group differs to some extent from the traditional peoples of the region (dos Santos 1998, 2000). This group is not listed in Table 2.
It is said that at the time of the Spanish conquest in the sixteenth century the Toromona, supposedly a Tacanan group led by the mythical cacique Tarona, formed an extremely effective barrier against the incursion of the Westerners into the southern part of Amazonia. The genocide that went hand in hand with the rubber boom (1880‚Äì1914) wiped the uncontacted Toromona from the official registers. Until today it still has not become clear whether the group perished during the rubber boom or retreated to inaccessible parts of the forest. Rumours have it that there is a mysterious group roaming through the forest to the south of the Araona territory at Puerto Araona (Iturralde Province, La Paz Department). Whether it actually concerns the ‚Äòphantom‚Äô Toromona or another group continues to be a mystery.
The last speakers of Itonama vividly recall the day that the Chori (Sirion√≥) came out of the forest to seek protection in the village of Magdalena against the aggressive Yanaigua. This must have been around 1930‚Äì35. Contrary to the Sirion√≥, the Yanaigua had small bows. It remains unknown what has happened to this uncontacted group since then. Some rumours have it that there is an uncontacted Tup√≠Guaran√≠ group called ‚ÄúYanaigua‚Äù living on the Guarayos Forest Reserve, between the R√≠o Grande and upper San Miguel, but this location is almost 1,000 kilometers to the south of Magdalena. Apart from the Toromona and Yanaigua, it is said that there is yet another nomadic group of Yuki (JKF√≠=K7H7D√≠) of about 14 persons that still remains uncontacted.
Finally, the Panoan languages are all closely related, but the internal classification of the family has not been completely settled yet. Following evidence published by, among others, Key (1968, 1979) and Girard (1971), the Panoan languages are nowadays often lumped together with the Tacanan languages (cf. Kaufman 1990, Adelaar with Muysken 2004). Some linguists, however, still show some reticence towards the Pano-Tacanan classification. Loos (1999), for example, states that the lexical and grammatical similarities between these two families might be explained by areal diffusion as well. Fabre (2005) argues that the numerous lexical correspondences between Panoan and Tacanan may point at an old areal contact situation, which seems to be corroborated by the much more subtle morphological correspondences that, according to Fabre, would have a more solid explanation based on areal relations than on genetic ones. Adelaar with Muysken (2004: 419) do mention that certain morphological changes attested by Girard (1971) might be induced by contact between Panoan and Tacanan. If the correspondences between these two families are indeed based on an

 Mily Crevels and Hein van der Voort
earlier contact situation, there is all the more reason to postulate similar cases of areal diffusion within the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region.
As far as the classification and comparison of the unclassified languages on the Bolivian side of the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region goes, we are still in an initial phase. It appears that although these languages diverge dramatically at the lexical level, they share a fair amount of structural features. Table 3, in which 14 core lexical items are given for 11 Bolivian and seven Rondonian languages from the area, gives an impression to what extent these languages diverge lexically. The only possible similarity found in the 11 Bolivian languages is the word for ‚Äòwater‚Äô in Baure (7H7M7A7D) and Yuki (JKF√≠ =K7H7D√≠). Obviously, there are some similarities between the Tupian subbranches, such as the words for ‚Äòfirewood‚Äô, and ‚Äòmaize‚Äô in Yuki (JKF√≠=K7H7D√≠) and Mekens (JKF√≠JKF7H√≠). The word for ‚Äòmaize‚Äô seems to have spread anyhow in Rondonia, just as the words for ‚Äòstar‚Äô and ‚Äòchicha‚Äô. Furthermore, Kwaza (KD9B7II?<?;:) seems to have a word for ‚Äòmoon‚Äô that is similar to the Mekens form. Note that the orthography of the word forms in Table 3 was homogenized, conforming to the IPA standard, with the exception of y¬Ø (IPA [j]). The smileys indicate that we have not been able to find the relevant item.
In spite of the fact that, for instance, the unclassified languages Cayubaba and Itonama, and Arawakan Baure do not share any lexical items, they do share a considerable number of grammatical ‚Äòmacro‚Äô features, such as, V-initial, head marking, alienable/inalienable distinction, lack of a grammaticalized gender system, verbal number, etc. These languages are geographically adjacent, but, as will be shown in Section 3.2, most of the relevant features are also found throughout the entire Guapor√©-Mamor√© region.
 Grammatical and areal characteristics
The Amazonian languages tend to share certain specific characteristics, a number of which have been summed up in Derbyshire (1987), Payne (1990: 214), Dixon and Aikhenvald (1999: 8‚Äì10), and Campbell (1997: 349‚Äì351). Since the Amazonian languages belong to different unrelated families, this suggests that these characteristics define Amazonia as a linguistic area. This area contains a well-known subarea, the Vaup√©s region of the Northwestern Amazon (Aikhenvald 2002, Sorensen 1967). As suggested by Crevels and van der Voort (2002, 2006), the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region may harbor one or more linguistic areas as well. There are, for instance, several lexical, phonological and grammatical phenomena that point to areal diffusion in Southeastern Rondonia (van der Voort 2005b). Likewise, Table 4 in Section 3.2 shows us a considerable amount of shared grammatical features between unrelated languages in the Moxos area. In order to explore the full scope of the relations observed in the whole region, it is necessary to consider the basic grammatical characteristics of the languages in question. With respect to the possible genetic relationships of the many

The Guapor√©-Mamor√© region as a linguistic area 

 Mily Crevels and Hein van der Voort
unclassified languages of the region, such areal linguistic research is indispensable, since shared features that cannot be explained by diffusion may be candidates for genetic retention.
 Criteria for the extent of the area
Since the extent of the suspected linguistic area under discussion is not yet known, the delimitation of the area of research is still provisional. Various criteria have been used for inclusion of certain languages, the geographic definition being the basic one for now: the Amazonian lowlands as drained by the Guapor√© and Mamor√© river systems.
As an additional, political criterion, we have aimed for a complete coverage of Rondonia, also including languages such as, for example, Kaxarar√≠, Karitiana and Karo, spoken in the upper Madeira basin. Furthermore, the geographical criterion is not completely logical, since many indigenous societies live traditionally on the headwaters of tributaries of the Guapor√© and Mamor√© rivers, rather than close to these main arteries. Therefore, much contact took place not only between groups on the uppermost headwaters of proximate river subsystems, but also between groups on headwaters of different major river systems, such as lower Madeira tributary rivers and the Juruna-Tapaj√≥s and Paraguay rivers (cf. Section 1.1). In this respect, it would be difficult to defend the exclusion of, for example, Enaw√™-Naw√™ (7H7M7A7D), Parec√≠ (7H7M7A7D), Rikbakts√° (C79HE=;) and Irantxe (KD9B7II?<?;:), whereas the Nambikwaran languages would be included.
Another important criterion is linguistic: as pointed out at the end of Section 2.2, certain similarities between languages that are not clearly due to genetic relationships are found throughout big parts of the region. This indicates that such similarities are not just the result of a particular history of contact between two languages, but that diffusion of a wider range has been going on for a long time. However, the true range of the linguistic area still has to be established. In the future, supporting linguistic criteria for the area may be envisioned and certain languages or regions probably will have to be included and others excluded with more compelling reason. In view of the distinction between areal traits and genetic correspondences, the study of all nearby unclassified languages is necessary. Therefore the Chiquitano language is included here, despite its southern location.
Finally, an important criterion is cultural: independent linguistic and archaeological information has confirmed the fact that earlier contacts existed between the ethnic groups pertaining to the three cultural areas described above; the Guapor√©, the Moxos and the Tapaj√≥s-Madeira areas.
 Defining features
The genetic linguistic diversity of the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region is enormous when compared to many other regions of the world. Especially the number of possibly

The Guapor√©-Mamor√© region as a linguistic area 
isolated languages is high. The region probably represents a ‚Äúresidual zone‚Äù, in Nichols‚Äô (1992) terms, or, in other words, a region in which linguistic diversity has been accumulating as languages were pushed aside by those of politically and economically powerful populations in adjacent linguistically homogenous ‚Äúspread zones‚Äù. When the distribution of language families and isolates is shown in different colors on a map (e.g., Nimuendaj√∫ 1981, Queixalos and Renault-Lescure 2000), the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region comes across as a focal region of prehistoric population movements. However, from the available linguistic material many similarities between the languages come to the fore. These similarities cross at least ten genetic linguistic borders, the borders of the three culture areas Moxos, Guapor√© and Tapaj√≥s-Madeira and the geographical border of the Guapor√© River itself. They include features such as minimal shared vocabulary, complex verbal morphology, evidentials, directionals, inclusive/exclusive distinction (cf. Crevels and Muysken 2005), and, surprisingly, lack of classifiers. The similarities may be phonological, grammatical, morphological or, sporadically, lexical in nature. The phonological similarities include, for example, nasal harmony. Grammatical similarities concern, for example:
L a high incidence of prefixes L evidentials L directionals L verbal number L lack of nominal number L lack of classifiers L inclusive/exclusive distinction
At the morphological level we find similar forms for grammatical categories. Note that at this point we have included forms from the Bolivian highland languages Uru (KHK-9>?F7O7D) and Aymara (7OC7H7D) as well:
L locative case A7D-ni; AM7 -na; 7?A -n—î; 7OC -na L applicative derivation A7D -ta- or -to-; AM7 -ta-; B7A -ka; A7H -ta-; CEI -tya-

‚Äòpowder‚Äô, ‚Äòporridge‚Äô, AM7/7?A/D7C/I78 -su ‚Äòbone‚Äô.
Some of these categories may rather characterize subareas than the entire region. Similar forms are also found at the lexical level.

A number of these correspondences do not belong to the general Amazonian features as listed in Payne (1990) and Dixon and Aikhenvald (1999). Several of these correspondences may be specific for the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region, and suggest the existence of a linguistic area, with possible subareas. Consider, for example, the semantically empty noun-formative root in combination with a bound root or classifier in examples (1) and (2), respectively:

(1) Kano√™ (KD9B7II?<?;:; Bacelar 2004: 130) i-kuta √ò-head ‚Äò(its) head‚Äô
(2) Cavine√±a (J797D7D; Guillaume 2004: 72) e-watÔÉæi=hu √ò-9B<:foot-BE9 ‚Äò(it bit me) on the foot‚Äô

The same element is also found in this function in Ese Ejja (J797D7D), Kwaza (KD 9B7II?<?;:) and Latund√™ (D7C8?AM7H7D). Movima (KD9B7II?<?;:) has a dummy element -i- as well, but its behavior differs somewhat from the above examples. It occurs as a suffix with both verbal and certain nominal lexemes and as a prefix with specific person elements (Haude 2006: 61ff.).
The applicative element -ta- could be yet another example of grammatical correspondences across the region:

(3) Kwaza (KD9B7II?<?;:; van der Voort 2004: 359)

Similar forms with the same function also occur in Kano√™ (KD9B7II?<?;:), Karo (JKF?H7C7H7C7), Lakond√™/Latund√™ (D7C8?AM7H7D) and have been attested in a wider region as well (cf. Wise 2002).
Certain linguistic correspondences among the Guapor√©-Mamor√© languages were noticed by earlier researchers who tried to provide genetic linguistic explanation or suggested language contact explanations. For example, Becker-Donner (1955) suggests that the unclassified Kano√™ language is distantly related to Tupian. One could

The Guapor√©-Mamor√© region as a linguistic area 
of course hypothesize that the independent development of a language, given enough time, could lead to the invisibility of its genetic relationships with other languages. However, the general typological and lexical differences between Kano√™ and Tupian are very big, whereas the observed correspondences are so close that they don‚Äôt justify the necessary time depth in case they are really genetically related. Subsequently, Price (1972) supposed that Kano√™ could be a creolized variant of Nambikwaran, but there is not even circumstantial evidence for this. If creolization were the only explanation for the linguistic correspondences across the region, then one is forced to assume that many adstrate languages have become extinct without even their names ever having been recorded ‚Äì note that of certain known names of extinct groups, as mentioned in e.g., Caspar (1975: 6‚Äì10), it is impossible to tell whether they refer to people speaking extinct languages or extant languages. As pointed out in Section 3, Crevels and van der Voort (2002, 2006) suggested that certain close correspondences call for an areal linguistic explanation. Indeed, the native peoples of the region must have coexisted and intermarried during thousands of years while maintaining their native languages, and until this day multilingualism is not uncommon among the Indians of Rondonia.
As pointed out above, the usual characterization in the literature of Aikan√£, Kano√™ and Kwaza as isolated languages is worth just as much as the various proposals for their specific classification: since there were only a few word lists, all claims were based on very thin evidence. Van der Voort (2005b) made an attempt at the classification of the ‚Äòisolated‚Äô languages of Rondonia on the basis of new and comprehensive data collections and descriptive analyses of a number of languages. The evidence presented in the article suggests that genetic relationships among these three languages could be possible, be it that they must be more ancient than those that define the Tupian family for example.
The impression one gathers for the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region is that speakers of the languages under discussion have been in contact with one another for many centuries, leading to the emergence of a Sprachbund. Especially the similarity of both the forms and the structures of classifier systems, the empty noun-formative root and the applicative morpheme suggest this. The cultural and linguistic characteristics of the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region may be quite different from those of the Vaup√©s region of Northern Amazonia as described by Sorensen (1967) and Aikhenvald (2002), and of other areas (cf. Aikhenvald and Dixon eds. 2001). As an example of a cultural difference with the Vaup√©s region, no traditions of obligatory linguistic exogamy have been reported in the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region. As an example of a linguistic phenomenon, diffusion of bound grammatical morphemes can be observed in the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region (e.g., the applicative marker and certain classifiers), whereas Aikhenvald and Dixon (2001: 2) suggest that borrowing of grammatical categories, rather than forms, would be more likely to occur.
It is also possible that the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region presents us with a linguistic puzzle which combines both areal and genetic relationships in an inseparable kind of

 Mily Crevels and Hein van der Voort
‚Äòmesh‚Äô, similar to the one described by Fortescue (2003) for the Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages of Siberia.
As already pointed out in Section 2.2, in an attempt to corroborate our claims about the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region as a linguistic area, we checked the presence or absence of a number of grammatical ‚Äòmacro‚Äô features in 24 languages of the area, or more specifically, in 14 Bolivian and 10 Rondonian languages. We included the Bolivian highland languages Quechua, Aymara and Uru as control languages. Although some features may seem dependent on each other, we generally tried to select structural features that are not too strongly correlated. Thus, one might be sceptical about, for instance, the correlation between feature 18 ‚Äòpossession marked on possessum‚Äô and feature 5 ‚Äòhead marking‚Äô. However, there are dependent-marking languages like Moset√©n (KD9B7II?<?;:), Cavine√±a (J797D7D),Ch√°cobo (F7DE7D),and Karitiana (JKF√≠7H?A√©C) that rather mark the possessum instead of the possessor. Reversely, head-marking languages like Kwaza (KD9B7II?<?;:), Mekens (JKF√≠JKF7H√≠), and Kano√™ (KD9B7II?<?;:) mark the possessor rather than the possessum. The results of our survey are listed in Table 4. Note that the categories are listed in the form of binary features, even though the results often represent strong statistical tendencies rather than absolute values. The smileys indicate that we have not yet been able to establish whether the particular feature is present in the language or not, either for lack of data or because we have not been able to interpret the data sufficiently.
The question now is what we can deduce from Table 4 with respect to the status of the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region as a possible linguistic area. At first sight, many of the tested features seem to be typically Amazonian, but then it appears that the Guapor√©-Mamor√© languages do not comply with a number of these features. Most of the sample languages (66.7%) indeed show a relatively high degree of synthesis and an even higher percentage (75%) are head-marking languages. However, whereas Amazonian languages, for instance, are generally considered to have elaborated classifier and/or gender systems, only three (12.5%) out of the 24 sample languages have a grammaticalized gender system: Wari‚Äô (9>7F79KH7D), Movima and Moset√©n (both KD9B7II?<?;:).Furthermore, only eight (33.3%) of the sample languages have classifiers, notably three Bolivian and five Rondonian languages. Another typical Amazonian feature is the asymmetrical morphology of many languages, or, in other words, Amazonian languages tend to have more suffix positions or slots than prefix positions. However, 11 (45.8%) out of the 24 Guapor√©-Mamor√© languages have a fairly symmetrical morphology in which prefix and suffix positions are relatively balanced.
When looking at features, which have not been labelled as typically Amazonian yet, we see that the Guapor√©-Mamor√© languages show a high incidence of evidentials (at least 79.2%), verbal number (at least 70.8%), directionals (at least 66.7%), inclusive/ exclusive distinction (66.7%), and alienable/inalienable distinction (at least 54.2%). The frequency of the inclusive/exclusive distinction in the Guapor√©-Mamor√© languages we sampled is higher than the 57% in Crevels and Muysken‚Äôs (2005) central-western

South-American sample and the 46% of the worldwide distribution sampled by Siewierska and Bakker (2005).
Taking into account the spread of the features within Rondonia and Bolivia separately, we must conclude that some features are more salient on the Rondonian side and others on the Bolivian side. Nominal number, for example, seems to be a typical Bolivian feature, occurring in 12 (85.9%) of the 14 Bolivian sample languages and in only one (10%) of the ten Rondonian languages. Classifier systems seem to be more common in the Rondonian (50%) than in the Bolivian languages (21.4%). Futhermore, we see that at least eight out of the ten Rondonian languages (80%) exhibit verbal number, whereas at least nine out of the 14 Bolivian languages score a slightly lower percentage (64.3%) on this feature. It is possible that this outcome may be slightly biased because of the inclusion of the highland languages Quechua, Aymara and Uru. Disregarding these three languages, the percentage of Bolivian languages exhibiting verbal number increases considerably to 81.8% (nine out of eleven languages).
The overall picture that emerges from Table 4 suggests that the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region is a linguistic area with two distinct subareas.
 Conclusion
The great diversity of languages in the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region must have accumulated during many centuries. As Nichols (1992: 22), in the context of prehistoric population movements, points out, ‚Äúresidual zones‚Äù are not necessarily explained as areas of refuge under the pressure of populations from other regions. They are more likely regions that have attracted populations for certain reasons. In the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region, the attracting factors could have been fertile lands and fishing grounds. Then again, in historic times (from the seventeenth century onwards) Rondonia did actually function as an area of refuge. As Leonel (1995) has shown on the basis of historical documents from the seventeenth century onwards, populations from the lower Madeira region through time migrated south and drove the existing populations even further south, and formed part of a push-chain mechanism that may have been created ultimately by the encroachment of Western civilization from the northeast, channeled through the Amazon River and its tributaries. Furthermore, Arawakan groups arrived at a later stage in the Bolivian lowlands than the traditional savanna groups Canichana, Cayubaba, Movima and Itonama. The Arawakan groups may have had an intermediary role in the trade relations between the Bolivian lowlands and the Andean highlands (cf. M√©traux 1942, Denevan 1966, Hornborg 2005).
The distribution of formal and functional similarities across genetic linguistic boundaries indicates that the Guapor√©-Mamor√© region is a linguistic area. Athough a small number of linguistic features show the clustering of certain languages in geographic subregions, the overall picture is that of a single linguistic area.

The Guapor√©-Mamor√© region as a linguistic area 
In the absence of abundant detailed historical documents, thorough archaeological reconstructions of the entire region and complete descriptions of all languages and cultures involved, our ideas about the historical context of the Guapor√©-Mamor√© languages will remain somewhat speculative. The complex linguistic setting of the Guapor√©Mamor√© region makes it impossible anyway to paint its long term development with a large brush. The only way to know more seems to be by studying every particular aspect of this complex setting, both from linguistic viewpoints as well as from anthropological, archaeological and historical perspectives. The case of the Jabutian languages, which show a clear connection with geographically quite remote languages may serve as an illustration of the importance of historical linguistics in all of this. Fortunately, the longterm interdisciplinary study that is required in order to arrive at a more general picture has started already a century ago with the likes of Nordenski√∂ld.
