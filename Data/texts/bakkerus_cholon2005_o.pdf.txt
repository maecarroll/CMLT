Acknowledgements
This book has been achieved thanks to the assistance of a number of institutions, and the support of many people.
I am greatly indebted to the Netherlands Foundation for the Advancement of Tropical Studies (WOTRO) and to the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) for their financial support. WOTRO granted me a travelling scholarship which gave me the opportunity to be put in contact with Cholón descendants and to record some Cholón lexical items and expressions. NWO awarded me a replacement grant enabling me to take a sabbatical year for the elaboration of this book and to carry out research in several libraries in the USA. I am equally indebted to Research School of Asian, African, and American Studies (CNWS) for their hospitality and for the many facilities provided during the sabbatical year, such as a quiet, well-equipped place to work; and to the Leiden University Centre for Linguistics (LUCL), which generously defrayed the costs of the printing of this book, and facilitated and helped with editing. I also owe special thanks to the Phonetics Laboratory of Leiden University for the assistance provided with regard to the analysis of the recordings made in Peru.
Many thanks are owed to the people in Peru who received me so friendly and who willingly gave me all kind of information: Sr. Reynaldo Bao Ritchle, mayor of Juanjui; Sr. Wilson León Bazán, librarian; Sra. Cirila Cabrera Avila, my guide in Tingo María and Monzón; Prof. Dr. Luís Jaime Cisneros, professor at the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú; Sr. Guillermo Pahuelo Storko; Sr. Wilson Pérez Iglesias; Dr. Víctor Antonio Rodríguez Suy Suy; Sr. Silverio Rodríguez De la Matta; Sr. Alberto Ruíz Tuesta, my guide in Juanjui and surroundings; Dr. Gustavo Solís Fonseca, director of the Centro de Investigación de Lingüística Aplicada of the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos; Dr. David John Weber; Dr. Mary Ruth Wise; Sra. Martha Pérez Valderrama and her daughter Karina Angulo Pérez; and, most of all, Sra. Aurelia Gutiérrez Cerquera and Mr. José Santos Chappa Ponce, who tried as hard as they could to remember the language once spoken by their grandparents and who kindly shared their knowledge of this language with me.
With thankfulness and pleasure I recall the many signs of interest and the many pieces of advice given during congresses, workshops and talks, or during informal discussions held after these meetings, by those concerned with indigenous languages all over the world. Their expressions of concern and valuable instructions formed a source of inspiration.
I am most grateful to my friends and my beloved family, my children Varja and Arvid in particular, for their deep-rooted conviction in my capacities, and for their sympathy and empathy. Their faith and encouragements meant a lot to me. It helped me, in moments of despair, not to abandon, but to continue. Most thanks I owe to Halewijn Alexander, who most actively assisted me. The moments in which I was mentally absent and in which he had to share my attention with this book were countless. I thank him for his practical assistance, his understanding and his moral support.

1. Introduction The main purpose of this book is to give a description of the Cholón language as represented in the Arte de la Lengua Cholona, an eighteenth century grammar written by a Franciscan friar, named Pedro de la Mata. This grammar can be consulted in the British Library (Manuscripts Department, Shelfmark: Additional 25322) in London (United Kingdom). Nowadays, the Cholón language is probably extinct. It was spoken in the Huallaga Valley (department of San Martín and Huánuco) in northern Peru. Cholón formed a small language family together with the neighbouring language Híbito. So far, no wider relationship has been established. In 1996 I visited the valley of the Huallaga River, in order to look for possible surviving speakers of Cholón and Híbito (Alexander-Bakkerus, 1998). There had been reports that in that area, especially in the town of Juanjui and surroundings, Cholón was still used by a very small number of speakers. However, the descendants living in that sector of the river only remembered a few lexical items and expressions from the language of their grandparents. According to my spokesmen, Cholón was no longer spoken in that area. In the higher part of the valley, in the region of Tocache and Monzón, the Cholón language also seems to be extinct.
1.1. Linguistic data Besides Pedro de la Mata’s Arte de la Lengua Cholona and the lexical items and expressions recorded in the Huallaga Valley in 1996, we have few other data of Cholón at our disposal. In the seventeenth century, a Franciscan priest, Fray Francisco Gutiérrez de Porres, wrote a grammar and a vocabulary of the Cholón language called Arte y Vocabulario de la Lengua Cholona. According to Amich ([1854] 1975), he also trans-lated the Christian Doctrine, the Shorter and Longer Catechism, several chants, hymns, prayers, and some religious books into Cholón. Fray Joseph de Araujo, another Franciscan priest, did the same for Híbito (see section 3.1 below). However, the works of both priests are untraceable as yet. In the eighteenth century, Martínez Compañón ([1783] 1978, II: fol. IV) made a word list of Cholón. This list contains 43 lexical items. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Julio Tello, a Peruvian archaeologist and anthropologist, transcribed the first 45 folios of Pedro de la Mata’s grammar. This transcription was published in a magazine called Inca (Tello, 1923). Tessmann (1930: 547, 458-459) gathered 31 words in Cholón and 33 words in Híbito, respectively. He mentions that Cholón, which he transcribes as Tscholón, is autodenominated Seeptsá. Loukotka (1949, 1968) and Greenberg (1987) also published some Cholón data. However, the words given by Loukotka are taken from Martínez Compañón, and Greenberg’s data are based on the information given by Tello, Tessmann and Loukotka. The word lists of Martínez Compañón, Tessmann and Loukotka, and the data of Greenberg can be found in Appendix 7, as well as the words and expressions recorded by me in Juanjui and in Valle. Torero (2002:160-201) and Muysken (2004:460-75) devote a chapter to Cholón in their book. The Peruvian linguist Sofia Latorre is reported to have recorded Cholón materials with the last remaining speakers. These have not

22
been published so far, however. Pedro de la Mata’s grammar is thus the only extensive available source of information about the language. Therefore, the present description of Cholón will mainly be based on the material provided by this grammar.
1.2. Affiliation and classifications Cholón or Seeptsá has been classified in a small language family together with Híbito (alternatively Chíbito, Hívito, Ibito, Jíbito, Xévito, Xíbito, Zíbito). Nevertheless, there has been some confusion and disagreement about the affiliation of both languages. This uncertainty is reflected in Steward’s Handbook of South American Indians (HSAI), (1948-1950). In Volume III (1948:507) of the HSAI, Hibitoan and Cholonan are men-tioned as different isolated families. This is repeated later (1948:600, 601) where Híbito is called a language isolate. In Volume VI (1950:192), on the other hand, Mason says that the majority of scholars, amongst whom Chamberlain (1913a), Jijón y Caamaño (1941-43) and Beuchat & Rivet (1909), support the view that Cholón and Híbito are related to each other; but that this view is not shared by Brinton (1891), Loukotka (1935) and Tessmann (1930). These three authors consider Cholón and Híbito as genetically unrelated languages. It is furthermore said that Jijón y Caamaño places the Cholón family in his macroChibchan phylum; that Loukotka and Tessmann believe Híbito to be mixed with Pano; and that the latter believes Cholón to be mixed with Quechua. In the following paragraphs we will discuss these claims in more detail.
In his book Reise in Chile, Peru und auf dem Amazonstrome [...] (1836, II: 320-337) Pöppig claims that the Híbito speak a language that is completely distinct from the lan-guage spoken by the Cholón. As already stated, this is also the opinion of Brinton (1891:288). However, in the chapter about the Arawak stock (1891:243) he notes that the "[...] Cholones are by some classed with the Campas [...]". In contradistinction to what is declared in the HSAI, namely that Loukotka (1935) believes Cholón and Híbito not to be related, in an article dating from 1949 about some unknown languages of South-America, Loukotka treats Cholón and Híbito together in one section, as he does with other clusters of related languages, as if they belong to one and the same family, although he does not explicitly say so. Later on, in his Classification of South American Indian Languages (CSAIL), Loukotka (1968:155) actually treats Cholón and Híbito as being related. He classifies them in one stock, Cholona, which he ranges in his North Central Division of the Tropical Forest Languages. He considers the languages as nearly extinct and observes that most of the Cholón speak Quechua. In the section "South American Indian Languages" of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (EB), Suárez (1978:107) also speaks of a Cholonan family composed of Cholón or Seeptsá and Híbito, supposed to be extinct. Tovar (1984:184-185) claims that Cholón and Híbito are two unrelated languages and he has his doubts about their affinity with other languages. He remarks that Jijón y Caamaño (1941-43)only includes Cholón into the Chibchan phylum, that Loukotka believes Híbito to be related to Pano, and that Beuchat & Rivet and Loukotka also include both languages into the Chibchan phylum in the book that

23
they wrote together. However, in his CSAIL, Loukotka neither classfies Cholón and Híbito under his Chibcha stock, nor under his Pano stock. According to the HSAI, both Loukotka and Tessmann do consider Híbito to be mixed with Pano, though not related. Greenberg (1987:383) also distinguishes a Cholonan family composed of Cholón and Híbito. In his classification Cholonan belongs to the Northern Group of the Andean stock of his Amerind family. (He includes Leko, a Bolivian language, in this group. On the basis of lexical data, this is not confirmed by Simon van de Kerke - personal communication -, who is working on this language). In the classification of Kaufman (1990), Cholonan, consisting of Cholón and Híbito, is an isolate language family, and Cholón and Híbito are part of the languages of his Andes region. Kaufman observes that Suárez and Swadesh consider them to be related as well, and that the latter considers Cholonan to be part of the macro-Paesan stock. Torero (1986:533) ranks among the linguists who assume that Cholón and Híbito are unrelated. The SIL (www.sil.orp/lla/peru_lg.html, 1996: 2) regards both languages as unclassified. The opinion that Cholón and Híbito are unrelated languages is refuted by Muysken (2004:461-75) on the basis of lexical correspondences between both languages. In addition, he points at the list containing the names of Cholón and Híbito settlements in the Arte de la Lengua Cholona, which may indicate that the grammar could be used not only in the Cholón-speaking villages, but also in the Híbito-speaking villages. In support of Muysken’s evidence the following argument can be adduced. At the end of his grammar, Pedro de la Mata declares that he has used the data of both Fray Francisco Gutiérrez de Porres and of Fray Joseph de Araujo: “[...] las he puesto del mismo modo que las usaron los V.V.P.P. Fr. Francisco Gutierres de Porres y Fr. Joseph de Araujo. It is therefore possible that de la Mata’s Arte is composed of Cholón (Gutierres’ material) and of Híbito (Araujo’s material). Probably, he could do so because the languages looked alike and both people could understand each other.
Table 1.1 lists the opinions about the relationship between Cholón and Híbito and the classifications of both languages. In this table the names are arranged in alphabetical order. The possible affinity between Cholón and Arawak (Campa) found in Brinton’s treatise about The American Race has been put in parenthesis, because Brinton does not mention the source of this information. The classification of Cholonan as a member of the Chibcha family, which Tovar ascribes to Loukotka, is also in parentheses, because Loukotka does not mention it in his article "Sur quelques langues inconnues de l’Amérique du Sud" from 1949, nor in his classification of 1968. He could have ad-vanced it in an earlier publication. In the overview below the following abbreviations are employed: A: Amerindian; Chb: Chibchan; P: Pano, C: Campa; H: Híbito; Q: Quechua; Ch: Cholón, mP: macroPaesan.

1.3. Structure of the book Before turning to the Cholón language we shall look at the people, their culture, and the ethnohistory of the Cholón (chapter 2). In this ethnohistorical sketch we shall also discuss the demographic development of the ethnic group (and of the Híbito) in the past, and our contact with the descendants. In chapter 3 the manuscript containing Pedro de la Mata’s description of Cholón will be examined. We shall look, among other things, at the outward appearance of the manuscript and at the way the language has been de-scribed. In the chapters 4 - 12 the Cholón language itself is described. As already stated, the description is primarily based on the data provided by de la Mata’s Arte de la Len-gua Cholona (ALC). Chapter 4 contains a description of the sounds. For this description, a thorough analysis of the symbols employed in the ALC for the transcription of Cholón is made, and the relation between the orthography developed by Pedro de la Mata for Cholón and its possible sound structure is examined. This work of interpretation was necessary because of the use in the ALC of a non-standardized spelling, according to which several symbols could refer to one sound, and, vice versa, different sounds could be represented by one symbol. Chapter 5 primarily deals with morphonological processes in the language. In this chapter attention is also payed to the syllable structure. In chapter 6 nominal structures are examined, and in chapter 7 the verbal complex. Chapter 8 treats the adverbs found in de ALC; chapter 9 the interjections; and chapter 10 the discourse markers. They are followed by a discussion about negation (chapter 11) and complex sentences (chapter 12). A lexicon closes our analysis of the language as described by de la Mata. The examples which appear in the chapters 4 - 12 are followed by a number in parentheses. This number corresponds with the number of the page or folio of the ALC on which the Cholón

25

form at issue occurs. The appendices contain maps (Appendix 1); a copy of the first

and the last folios of the manuscript Arte de la Lengua Cholona (Appendix 2); a

survey the Cholón forms and examples encountered in the ALC (Appendix 3);

2. The Cholón people
2.1. Sources Although various authors have reported on the Cholón, information about this group remains fragmented (Pöppig 1836, II:320-337; Amich OFM [1854] 1975:83-86; Herndon & Gibbon 1853-54:136-159; Brinton 1891:288-289; Izaguirre 1922-1929, VI, XII; Tessmann 1930:456-458; Tovar 1966:81; Bonavía 1990:248-261; The Handbook of South American Indians 1948-1950, III, VI, Steward, ed.). The information given by Pöppig, Herndon & Gibbon, and Bonavía is first hand. Pöppig and Herndon & Gibbon have traveled in the Huallaga Valley, where they got in touch, amongst others, with the Cholón and the Híbito. Bonavía is an archaeologist who in 1966 participated in an expedition to the archaeological site of Pajatén (supposed to be an ancient centre of the Cholón or the Híbito). Amich mainly got his information from the reports and journals that Franciscan priests wrote during their voyages. These reports and diaries are kept in the archives and the library of the convent Colegio de Santa Rosa de Ocopa, an important Franciscan centre, founded in 1732 near Huancayo (Peru). From Ocopa missionaries were sent all over Peru in order to christianize Indians, to man mission stations and to discover new portages and new areas. The data of Brinton are based on the books of Pöppig and Amich. Izaguirre also drew on the archives and the library of Ocopa, on Amich and on other sources. Volume VI of Izaguirre’s work relates the voyages made by Father Manuel Sobreviela and Fray Francisco Álvarez de Villanueva, and contains the diaries of both priests (pp. 79-267). Volume XII contains, among other things, a section devoted to the Cholón and Híbito, called ‘De los Cholones e Hibitos que más tarde figuran en esta misma región del Alto Huallaga. Epoca de su aparición histórica, 1671' (pp. 389-394). Tessman refers primarily to a certain J.W. Harmston, a scholar who did not publish his data, and to Herndon.
Section 2.2 and 2.3 will present a synopsis of the anthropological data found in the sources mentioned above, supplemented with the information obtained by the present author in the Huallaga Valley. In section 2.2 we shall briefly focus on the physical appearance of the Cholón and on their way of life. In section 2.3 we shall focus on the way they lived. We shall also compare them with the Híbito, because their lives were closely interwoven with those of the Híbito by intermarriage and cohabitation. Section 2.4 will give a survey of the Cholón language communities and will report on our visit to the Cholón descendants in the valley of the river Huallaga. For the information about the communities and the demographic data, the same sources as those mentioned above have been consulted, with the exception of Tovar and Bonavía. In addition Fabre (1994:291, 289), Loukotka (1949:65-66, 1968:155), Suárez (1976:107), Solís Foseca (1987:A1 47/4), Tauro (1987, II:677 and Wise (1985:208) have been consulted. The places named in this section can be looked up in Map II - IV in Appendix 1. On Map II the habitats of the Híbito and the Cholón are indicated (Izaguirre 1922, VI:99). Map III is from Martínez Compañón’s Truxillo del Perú ([1783] 1978, I). It shows the conversiones (‘missions’) of Guailillas or Huaylillas with the village of Caxamarquilla or Cajamarquilla

28
(modern Bolívar) (see section 2.3.4 and 2.4.1): the missions of Jesús de Pajatén and Jesús de Monte Sión for the Híbito people, and the missions of San Buenaventura del Valle and Pisano or Pampa Hermosa, where the Cholón were brought together. Map IV shows the basin of the Huallaga River embedded between the Cordillera Central and the Cordillera Oriental. Map IV has been made by Father Manuel de Sobreviela on the occasion of his trip through the Huallaga Valley in 1790. It contains some rectifications made in 1830 by Amédée Chaumette des Fossés, consul of France in Peru (see also section 3.2).
Names wich are characteristic for the region, non-established names, local names for animals, plants and drinks, and foreign words are written in italics.
2.2. Main features of the Cholón According to the description given by Pöppig, Amich and Izaguirre, the Cholón man is strong and well-proportioned. He has a brown skin and black hair, and is “by far the largest and finest-looking of the aborigines” (Herndon 1853-54:138). His height (six feet:1,80 meter) makes him conspicuous (Herndon 1853-54:151). With his aquiline nose and his prominent cheekbones he resembled the North American Indian (Pöppig 1836, II:321). Round 1830, the life expectancy of the Cholón was 40 years (Pöppig 1836, II:322). The Cholón woman has a stocky figure and is less attractive. That is why the Cholón men preferred the Híbito women who were reported to be neat (Amich [1975] 1854:85), slender and good-looking. Mrs. A. Gutiérrez and Mr. J. Chapa, the Cholón descendants to whom I have spoken during my stay in the Huallaga Valley, told me that Cholón men often married Híbito girls.
The Cholón also seem to have used body painting. However, the sources contradict each other to some extent concerning this practice and the names of the colours. Tovar (1966:81) remarks that the Cholón painted their faces and their body with jagua and achiote. Herndon (1853-54:138) reports that the Cholón only painted their arms and legs with a dark blue juice obtained from the huitoc, a nutlike fruit; and that it were the Híbito who painted their faces with huitoc as well as with achote [cf. Tovar’s achiote], from which a red colour is extracted. The fact that the Híbito painted their faces blue and red, colours obtained from huitoc and achote, respectively, is also mentioned in the HSAI. In addition, Steward (1948, III:521) writes: “Seemingly all the tribes of Perú and Ecuador stain their teeth black by chewing certain herbs and ashes, which produces a stain that lasts several days (Chantre y Herrera, 1901:63) [...] All tribes formerly painted their faces and bodies, often as much for protection against insects as for ornamentation [...]. Chagua juice [cf. Tovar’s term jagua] was used to allay itching”.
About their clothing, Amich ([1854] 1975:85), Steward (1948, III:520) and Izaguirre (1922-29, XII:392) mention that in the seventeenth century the Cholón and Híbito country dwellers, men as well as women, were clad in cusmas or cushmas. These cusmas were single pieces of woven cotton with a slit for the head. They were of a mosslike (Amich [1854] 1975:85) or brown colour and their length varied from above the knees till down to the ankles. On festive occasions and in the cities, the men wore pants, and the women long dresses and shawls or capes which

29
were procured by trade (Izaguirre 1922-29, XII:392). According to Amich ([1854] 1975:85), pants and shawls were made of baize, and the shirts worn on Sunday of linen. Izaguirre furthermore observes that the Cholón wore neither socks, nor shoes, and that the use of garments, such as pants and capes, was introduced when the mission had gained some influence. According to Steward (1948, III:520) in native times “a complete lack of wearing apparel was not common [...] though many tribes used only some genital cover”. However, Steward and Métraux (1948:603) state that the Cholón and the Híbito people probably grew and wove cotton already in native times. Furthermore, the ornaments of the Montaña tribes consisted of beads, feathers, necklaces, arm and leg bands.
As regards their character, the Cholón people are reported to be cheerful, goodtempered, sober (Herndon & Gibbon 1853-54:137-138), cooperative, kind and reliable (Izaguirre 1922-29, VI:97-98, XII:392). Izaguirre (1922-29, XII:393) remarks in addition that they did not have a thievish nature and that they were neither ambitious, nor greedy. There vices were lazyness (Herndon & Gibbon 185354:150; Izaguirre 1922-29, XII:393; Pöppig 1836, II:325; Tovar 1966:81) and the fact that they liked drinking (Izaguirre 1922-29, XII:393; Pöppig 1836, II:325; Tovar 1966:81). Under the influence of drink they would become aggressive (Pöppig 1836, II:327). Pöppig (1836, II:325) and Tovar (1966:81) furthermore bring forward that the Cholón are claimed to tend to a dissolute life style, to be proud, suspicious and, contradictory to what Izaguirre reports, to be unreliable. The Híbito are claimed to be less drawn into colonial civilization than the Cholón (Herndon & Gibbon 1853-54:150). Tessmann says that they were wild (1930:458). They led a secluded life, and did not tolerate any outsiders in their neighbourhood. Chapa (personal communication) also referred to the Híbito as the aucas ‘the enemies’ or jíbaros ‘the ferocious people’.
2.3. Habitat and living conditions The region in which the Cholón and the Híbito lived (and in which their descendants still live) belongs to the zone called the Montaña (HSAI:507) . It is a rough, hilly area in which many rapid streams flow, and it is covered with impenetrable wilderness and rain forests. On the lower slopes, up to an altitude of 1500 metres, the forests are tropical. Mesothermal forests appear on the intermediate slopes at an altitude of some 2000 - 2600 metres. The Montaña is separated from the high mountains of the Andes by the so-called Ceja (‘ridge’) de la Montaña (2600 3000 metres). This ridge is a rugged, precipitous, cloud-buried, rainy strip where the nights are cold. It is possible that the ancestors of the Cholón and the Híbito used to live in the Ceja, in a region called Pajatén or Abiseo, today a national park in which the ruins of an ancient city are situated. In the book Abiseo. Patrimonio Mundial en Emergencia (1996:95-98) written by Adrián Mendoza Ocampo, it is said that the people from Pajatén spoke Cholón. Amich ([1854] 1975:84) remarks that, amongst the Indians who inhabited this region, the Cholón and the Híbito predominated and that in 1676 the Franciscan friars Father Juan de Campos, Juan Martínez and Jerónimo Caballero christianized many Indians of the Híbito tribe. Bonavía

30
(1990:249), referring to Raimondi (1876:210-211), also mentions Father Juan de Campos. According to the former source, Juan de Campos had run a concession together with the Híbito people. According to Raimondi, Father Juan de Campos and both other priests were well received not only by the Híbito, but also by the Cholón.
2.3.1. Housing The ruins of the archaeological site of Abiseo are situated at an average altitude of 2.800 metres. They consist, among other things, of relics of big, round houses built on terraces. The walls of these houses were made of stone and adorned with geometric, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figures. The roofs were coniform and made of vegetable material. In the time of the colonial period (1630-1830) and the national period (1830-present), the Cholón and Híbito who were not housed in missions, villages and cities, lived in huts. These huts were rectangular. They had an open front, reed walls and a thick palm roof, which lasted three rainy seasons (Pöppig 1836, II: 326). According to Izaguirre, however, the walls were made of stakes attached by lianas. The dwelling only sheltered one family. Cholón families were small and consisted of a father, a mother and one or two childeren. They lived in isolation or with a few related families in a community of at most three or four huts, widely separated from each other: some 100 yards to a few miles (Herndon & Gibbon). (The absence of big family houses and the rectangular shape of the dwellings seem to be in contradiction with the ruins of the big, round houses found in the archeological site of Abiseo. The HSAI observes that some Tacanan and Arawakan houses were round). These dwellings were not furnished. The Cholón had no stools, beds, nor platforms like some other tribes of the Montaña region. They slept on mats made of palm leaves. The Híbito seemed to have mosquito nets rigged on canoes. For the preparation of the meals, the Cholón women had kitchenware at their disposal, which consisted of calabashes, and of large cooking pots, jars and bowls of earthenware. The pottery was rather rough, and sometimes it was painted red and decorated with simple, crude, white geometric figures. Animals were cooked in their skin. To carry their goods the Cholón and the Híbito used baskets made by themselves. The Cholón also made carrying nets and pouches for small objects.
2.3.2. Fishing and hunting Isolated family groups used to move frequently, leading a somewhat nomadic existence. For their living the Cholón fished, hunted, gathered wild fruits, honey and cotton, cultivated some crops, and traded. To catch fish they used poison and spears. The HSAI mentions that fish lines were made at the end of the eighteenth century. Izaguirre also mentions the use of fyke nets. For hunting (and warfare) the Cholón used blowguns, bows and poisoned arrows, spears, traps, and clubs. They hunted armadillos, capibaras or river hogs, deer, land turtles, monkeys, peccaries or wild hogs, pumas, snakes and all kinds of birds (such as cormorants, wild ducks, a great variety of parrots, wild turkeys and toucans). However, the killing of armadillos,

31
capibaras, snakes and black and yellow birds with poisoned arrows appeared to be forbidden. It would namely spoil the hunting poison. According to the HSAI this was also the case when hawks and vultures were killed. Deer was also forbidden game for the Cholón, because it was believed to be a reincarnated soul. The HSAI furthermore mentions that to kill a snake with a blowgun would make the blowgun crooked, and that the hunt on ant-eaters, caimans and iguanas was not allowed either. Killing a caiman with a rifle would ruin the rifle. For their protection and for the safeguard of the hunting, Cholón hunters carried small nets or pouches with all sorts of herbs, and amulets: stones or pits carved with glyphs.
2.3.3. Farming The Church encouraged farming and stimulated the Indians to settle down, and in the late eighteenth century farming and fishing were the most important sources of food. The fields on which the Cholón cultivated their crops were obtained by slashing and burning a piece of jungle. (The HSAI observes that after the clearing of the ground the Híbito had a celebration in which much chicha or masato, an alcoholic beverage, was involved, and which was accompanied by dance and the music of drums and fifes of reed. The Cholón also employed these instruments to make music. Other musical instruments were bone flutes, horns, jingles and trumpets (Herndon & Gibbon, 1853-54, Izaguirre, 1922-29). With the arrival of the missionaries many new plants (bananas, rice and sugarcane, for instance) were introduced. The Cholón people grew fruits (avocados, bananas, chirimoyas, figs, guavas, oranges, papayas, pineapples), spices (cinnamon, ginger, laurel, pepper, vanilla), trees (acacia, palm, cinchona), vegetables (beans, maize, pumpkins, sachapapas or potatoes of the woods, yam or sweat potatoes, yucca or sweet manioc), and other crops, such as, coca, cocoa, coffee, cotton, indigo, peanuts, rice, sarsaparilla, sugarcane and tobacco. It was Father Francisco Álvarez de Villanueva (see section 2.1) who noticed the existence of cinnamon trees in the neighbourhood of Santa María del Valle, a village situated near Huánuco (Map II). As regards the other trees, palm trees were very useful. They provided the Cholón with food, wax, wood, and with material for the manufacturing of all sorts of objects. The chonta palm was employed for the manufacturing of blowguns, bows, clubs and spears; from the leaves mats were woven. Baskets and textiles (besides cotton) were made from the fibres of the chambira palm. Herndon & Gibbon report that in Lupuna and the surrounding area almost every woman was engaged in spinning cotton and that a huge amount of balls of cotton-thread was produced. The HSAI furthermore mentions that cotton was woven on a belt loom or horizontal loom. With respect to the other crops, maize was primarily cultivated for the preparation of chicha. It appears that chicha could also be made from bananas and from fruits of the chonta palm (HSAI). Traditionally, the Cholón drank masato which was made from yucca. They fermented it by chewing some mash and by spitting it back into the brew. Sarsaparilla was used as a purgative. The HSAI also mentions that the Cholón were reputed to be powerful curers and that they used ‘cyperus’ as a curative. According to Pöppig they knew and practised all kinds of cures and treatments. Amich writes

32
that, in case of an epidemic, a smallpox epidemic for instance, the Cholón retired to the mountains where they led a secluded life. In addition to the cultivation of crops, the Cholón kept chickens, a few guinea pigs, and some pigs.
2.3.4. Trade The missionaries also encouraged the Cholón and the Híbito to trade. To facilitate the trade (and to concentrate both people in surveyable regions) the missionaries tried to persuade the Cholón and the Híbito to move to accessible and navigable places, notwithstanding the fact that it required a lot of skill to navigate the Huallaga and its affluents because of the rapids and the gravel banks. In addition, after a rainfall the waters are swirling, tempestuous and contain many objects, such as treestumps. However, Herndon & Gibbon, the HSAI and Izaguirre agree that the Cholón mastered the waters in the valley of the river Huallaga, that they had a thorough command of navigation, and that they were excellent boatsmen and pilots. It is obvious that, since time immemorial, the Cholón have navigated the rivers, transporting goods or people. It appears that the Cholón used to gather salt from the salt hills situated on the opposite side, the Amazonian side1 of the Huallaga River. Salt was one of the articles which the Cholón exchanged in the highlands for metal tools and other merchandise. According to Brinton, the Chuncho and the Cholón were said to have been the possessors of the Cerro de Sal, the Salt Mountain (see Map IV). Salt hills were also encountered near Pilluana, Tocache and Uchiza (Herndon & Gibbon). Besides the places mentioned by Herndon & Gibbon, Pöppig mentions other salt regions: Cachiyacu, Chipurana, RíoMaría San Miguel, Sapuosa and Yurayacu, for example; and he remarks that the whole valley is in fact a bed of rock salt which crops out here and there and which is sometimes covered with mould, sand and red sandstone (I myself saw a salt hill near Sión). The word cachi (< Quechua ‘salt’) in the names of places and rivers, and the indications salinas ‘saltmines’ or ‘saltpans’ and tierras salitrosas ‘saline soils’ on Map IV also suggest the presence of salt. The Cholón transported the salt by canoe and on rafts made of balsa. The HSAI observes that salt was also extracted in a place called Callana Hacu (HSAI, III:602). However, the name of Callana Hacu does not occur on the maps. It is possible that Callanayacu ‘Callana River’, near Chasuta, was meant by this name. The fact that the Cholón people extracted salt on the other side of the river suggests that they did not confine themselves to the left side of the Huallaga River and that their habitat possibly extended as far as the Ucayali Basin (see section 3).
Coca leaves were another important product that the Cholón people had traded from time immemorial. Izaguirre calls the Huallaga Valley the región clásica of coca, the region in which coca has traditionally been cultivated. Distance was and
1 According to Herndon and Gibbon, this is the Infidel side where the Cashibo live; Izaguirre writes that the Cashibo, Conibo, Setebo and Shipibo lived in that region, and that they spoke pano which was the lingua franca of the Montaña; Pöppig remarks that it were the Chuncho who lived there. This could mean that the term of Chuncho was the generic name for the tribes living in that area, and that Chuncho was synonymous to Infidel (see also section 3).

33
still is measured by cocadas ‘the effectiveness of a mouthful of coca leaves’. The effectiveness of chewed coca leaves is 35 - 40 minutes, viz. a walking distance of three kilometres in the open field. Working hours are also regulated by cocadas: every two hours, workers take a break of a quarter of an hour to chew some coca leaves. In days of old, people from the villages of Valle and Sión, and the surrounding areas used to undertake a trip of eight days to the high mountains, to the village of Cajamarquilla, in order to exchange coca leaves for garments and iron tools. The coca leaves were transported in long baskets which could contain three arrobas, some 33 kilogrammes (one arroba equals eleven kilogrammes approximately).
Besides salt and coca, the Cholón traded other products, such as salted fish, feathers and bees’ wax. In the mission period, the plants cultivated on the instigation of the missionaries were added to the traditional trading products. The HSAI mentions the trade of candles, copaiba oil, copal resin, feathered hats, fish lines (cf. section 2.2.2), laurel wax, manioc meal, peanut oil and woven pouches. Father Francisco Álvarez de Villanueva writes in his diary that he saw a canoe loaded, among other things, with cocoa powder, coffee beans, cinnamon, wax and gold dust from the river Napo. He also remarks that gold and silver have furthermore been found in Cajamarquilla. It appeared that in this place pieces of gold showed up after a downpour.
2.4. Cholón and Híbito territories Cholón and Híbito were spoken in a vast area. As can be seen on Map II and Map IV, the region of Cholón-speakers and of Híbito-speakers reached from the Huallaga River to the Marañon River and, longitudinally, from Tingo María to Juanjui. The Híbito were found in the northern part of the area, alongside the river Huayabamba and its affluents; the Cholón in the zone south of the Híbito area. However, it is not unlikely that their habitat also extended to the other side of the river, the side where the gentiles or unbelievers lived and where they used to extract salt which they subsequently exchanged for other goods in the high mountains (see section 2.2.4). It is very well possible that groups of Cholón who were unwilling to submit to the law of the Church (and of the Spaniards) had fled to the other side of the river, to this Infidel side (cf. ibid. Note 1). According to the HSAI, the Indians of the Montaña resented being brought into the missions by force and being required to observe Spanish customs. “The ban on polygamy was especially intolerable” (Steward, 1948:512). There was also much insubordination and desertion. In addition, they used to move away or to withdraw into inaccessible areas, whenever a contagious disease was rife.
Anyhow, in the Huallaga Valley and the surrounding mountains, concentrations of speakers have been observed in several places through the ages. In section 2.4.1 we shall see that the different sources are not always in agreement concerning the concentrations of Cholón and Híbito, and their number of speakers. Section 2.4.2 will report on my findings in the Huallaga Valley. G. Solís Fonseca, director of the CILA (Centro de Investigación de Lingüística Aplicada) of the San

34
Marcos University in Lima mentioned in 1987 that there were one or two Cholón speakers in the neighbourhood of Sión, a village situated on the left bank of the Huallaga River. These speakers appear to have been the consultants of Sofía Latorre. In the summer of 1996, I made a trip to this region to search for speakers of Cholón (and, if possible, of Híbito).
2.4.1. Habitat and speakers Schjellerup (1990: 236-247) mentions that the Inca conquest of the Ceja started from the northeast, and that round 1473 they had reached, for instance, the Bombonaje River, an affluent of the Jelache, a tributary of the Huayabamba River (see Map II). The discovery of a stele and some stone structures show in addition that there had been a flourishing culture in the region before the arrival of the Inca. According to Amich, however, the first peaceful contact with the Híbito took place about 1670, when a cowherd from the province of Cajamarquilla (Pataz, Map III) penetrated into their territory (Amich [1845] 1975: 84). After this encounter two Jesuits from Quito, a priest and a secular cleric, successively entered the territory. Their enter-prise to convert the people failed and they retraced their footsteps. In 1676 three Franciscan friars, Father Juan Campos and two lay brothers, Juan Martínez and Jerónimo Caballero, succeeded in their attempt to christian-ize the Híbito, and they baptized many of them. Shortly afterwards, two other Franciscan priests, Fray José Araujo (Joseph de Araujo, according to Pedro de la Mata) and Fray Francisco Gutiérrez (Gutierres) de Porres, founded the village of Jesús de Ochanache and of San Buenaventura de Apisonchuc, respectively. In Jesús de Ochanache were gath-ered the Híbito, and in San Buenaventura de Apisonchuc the Cholón. Both Joseph de Araujo and Francisco Gutiérrez wrote a grammar, an arte, and a vocabulary of the language spoken in their villages (see chapter 3). After their death difficulties arose between the Híbito and the Cholón, who apparently were living together in the missions, and the Church decided to separate them. Four villages were founded, two for each group. The Híbito people were housed in Jesús de Pajatén and in Jesús de Monte Sión; the Cholón people in San Buenaventura del Valle and in San Buenaventura de Pisano or Pampa Hermosa (Map III). Amich furthermore observes that in 1767 there were 4800 persons living in these missions, and that afterwards their number increased very much. However, according to Steward, the missions in the Huallaga-Ucayali area declined after 1767. In that year an uprising took place (the first revolt occurred in 1742, six years before friar Pedro de la Mata wrote his arte) and the Jesuits were expelled from the area. And, in Steward’s words (1948:512), "Their missions were either secularized or taken over by the Franciscans in the capacity of curates, which greatly handicapped them". This caused the decay of the mis-sions.
Pedro de la Mata wrote his Arte de la Lengua Cholona in 1748 in Trujillo. In 1772 a copy of this grammar was made by Fray Gerónimo Clota in the mission of San Buenaventura del Valle. In this manuscript the names of the villages of Huaylillas, Pizana (Pisano), Pucala and Soledad are encountered. Apparently, these were the villages or missions with which the people from Valle were in close contact.

35

Pizana or Pisano was a Cholón mission, as we have seen. Possibly, Huaylillas, Pucala and Soledad were also Cholón villages. At the end of the manuscript are noted the names of settlements of which the inhabitants had not yet been converted. The list of Cholón villages, some of which have Spanish names as well, is as follows:

Apizoncho Xuñante Utchinaman Chalamuy Chillancuy

‘Pacaya’ ‘Palma Real’ ‘Junta de Tigres’

Xenquiman Jallipñatch Itziuat Zalcot Jopeyte

‘Yervas’ ‘Cerro de Palo Fuerte’
‘RíoMaría Negro’ ‘Tierra como Sangre’

The list of Híbito settlements consist of the following names:

Ochañache Chillonya Putonya Ziumich Juanjui

‘Arbol’ ‘Arbol’ ‘Palmas’

Of the villages figuring on these lists, only Apizoncho, Zalcot and Juanjui can be found on a map. Apizoncho appears as the name of a river on Map II and IV. Zalcot, Yanayacu in Quechua, also appears on both maps. Juanjui can be found on Map II.
The missions in the valley of the Huallaga, the "conversiones de Huaylillas" or "Guaylillas", belonging to the diocese of Trujillo, came under the supervision of the College of Santa Rosa of Ocopa after the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767. The guardian of this convent, Fray Manuel de Sobreviela, made a tour of the Huallaga region in 1787. A year after, Fray Francisco Álvarez de Villanueva also visited the region. (cf. section 2.1). During his round trip Villanueva decided to relocate a number of villages, Pajatén, Valle, Sión, and the former Jesuit missions Playa Grande and Chicoplaya near the Monzón River (Map II and IV), from the inland to the riverside. Thus, Pachiza was founded for the indigenous people of Pajatén, and Tocache for those of Pampa Hermosa. He also decreed that on Wednesdays and on Fridays the instruction of the christian doctrine should be given in Spanish, and that all the children should learn to read Spanish. In his diary, Sobreviela declares that the villages of Pajatén, Valle, Sión, Pampa Hermosa, Playa Grande and Chicoplaya contained 1597 souls, of which 376 were living in Valle and 84 in Chicoplaya. According to Izaguirre there was a concentration of Cholón people in the neighbourhood of Monzón at that time; and according to a certain Father Gabriel Sala (Izaguirre, 1924, VI:501), there were 138 Cholón inhabitants around Chicoplaya. Other Híbito or Cholón zones named in the reports of Sobreviela and Villanueva are Palma Real (cf. Pedro de la Mata’s Utchinaman), the river Pisan or Mixiollo, Buldibuyo, Jucusbamba, Parcoy (a mining place), Soledad (also

36
mentioned in Pedro de la Mata’s grammar, see above), Tayabamba and Uchiza. In addition, the village of Lupuna is mentioned by Izaguirre as being a Híbito settlement. He also gives an overview of the villages and of the number of Indian inhabitants made by Sobreviela in 1791 (p. 497). According to this list or "Estado del Colegio de Ocopa y de todas sus misiones del Peru y Chiloe, sus hospicios, distancias, pueblos y almas", Pampa Hermosa has 246 inhabitants, Uchisa 100, Sion 205, Valle 372, Pajatén 358, Jucusbamba 28, Pachisa 100, Playa Grande 204 and Chicoplaya 110. Concerning Pampa Hermosa, Valle and Pajatén, the HSAI gives deviant figures: 205, 378 and 325 respectively. According to the census of Mainas, carried out in 1814 (Izaguirre, 1924, XII:371), Pachiza, Pajatén and Jalopachi together had 3004 inhabitants, Valle de Apichoncho 277, Sión 204, Balsayacu 85, Tocachi 185, Uchiza 250, Playa Grande 170 and Chicoplaya 200. The total amounts to 4375 inhabitants, which means a considerable growth compared with Sobreviela’s figure (1723 souls). The population of the villages probably increased, due to the arrival of mestizos, Spaniards and other natives (Conibo, for instance, cf. HSAI, III: 600 and VI: 192, respectively). Presumably, not the entire population spoke Cholón or Híbito, the more so since after Sobreviela’s decree in 1787 the children had to read Spanish, and the religious doctrine was taught in Spanish.
In the HSAI, VI:192, the Híbito language is said to have become extinct about 1825, and the Híbito reportedly mixed with the Conibo. Pöppig observes that in 1836 there were 288 Cholón families in the missions of Pachiza, Sión, Tocache, Uchiza, Chicoplaya and Playa Grande, and that the total number of inhabitants amounted to 900 or 1000 souls. The fact that Pöppig notes that Pachiza and Sión, which previously were the habitat of the Híbito, are considered to be Cholón settlements arrests the attention. Herndon & Gibbon declare that the district of Tocache (Tocache, Lamasillo, Isonga and Pizana) housed 500 Híbito and the district of Tingo María 188 Cholón. Strikingly, the former Cholón missions of Tocache and Pizana (Pisano or Pampa Hermosa), had become Híbito villages. For the district of Pachiza Herndon & Gibbon give the following numbers of married couples: Pachiza 80, Valle 80, Huicunga 30, Sión 30, Achiras 16, Lupuna 15, Shepti 12, Bijoa 4, Challuayacu 3. The total number of persons was estimated at 1350: five per family. Tessmann, citing J.W. Harmston, notes that the Híbito are living in the woods behind the Bombonaje River. These Híbito seem to have populated the Pajatén area. In his book, Tessmann also gives a list of Híbito and Cholón words. The Híbito words are from an old man and two women from Pachiza. The Cholón words were given to him by an old man who was also living in Pachiza. Tessmann furthermore states that the regions populated by the Cholón are the regions around Huánuco and Tingo María, and the zone south of Pachiza between the rivers Huayabamba and Valle or more to the south. Loukotka calls Cholón and Híbito nearly extinct languages. He reports that Cholón is spoken by a few people near Uchiza on the Huallaga River, and Híbito on the Huamo River. In the section about the South American Indian languages of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1976/1984: 107, fifteenth edition), the Cholonan family is held to be extinct by Suárez. This is repeated in the next edition (Volume 22, p. 792). In her paper "Languages of

37

Lowland Peru: History and Current Status", Wise states that Cholón as well as Híbito are extinct. Tauro mentions that the Cholón already spoke Quechua in the sixteenth century. Their descendants are living in the department of Huánuco and in San Pedro de Chonta on the Uchiza River. Concerning the number of habitants of each habitat he gives the following data:

Huánuco:

1940 1961 1972 1981

835 habitants 1091 habitants 4040 habitants 4961 habitants

S.P. de Chonta: 1940 1961 1972 1981

184 habitants 120 habitants 188 habitants 175 habitants

Fabre locates both the Cholón and the Híbito in the neighbourhood of Sión. He notes that the latter seem to be extinct and that there were one or two speakers of Cholón in 1986. He got this information from Solís. These speakers apparently were the consultants of Sofía Latorre.
The different places in which Cholón and Híbito were located, together with the number of indigenous people and the names of the sources of information are shown in Table 1.2 below. The villages of which the inhabitants have been counted, but of which the number of habitants has not been given, are marked with a plus sign. In this table, the sources of information are chronologically ordered. The data of Father Gabriel Sala concerning Chicoplaya (138 inhabitants), and the deviant figures mentioned in the HSAI regarding the villages of Pampa Hermosa, Valle and Pajatén have been left out. The data of Tauro are also omitted. He remarks that in the sixteenth century the Cholón spoke Quechua, although “elements of an own language still survive”. This remark implies that the Cholón had already made contacts with the Quechua speakers before the arrival of the missionaries in 1676. From Schjellerup’s article we know that the Inca infiltrated the Ceja. It is therefore possible that the inhabitants of the places mentioned by Tauro, except for one or two people, are speakers of Quechua and Spanish.

As we have seen, there is some confusion concerning the habitat and the language area of the Cholón and the Híbito. Pisana and Tocache, known as Cholón missions, are regarded as Híbito settlements by Herndon & Gibbon. The Híbito villages of Pachiza and Sión are said to have had a Cholón population by Pöppig. This is repeated by Tessman and by Fabre, according to whom Cholón was also spoken in Pachiza (Tessmann) and in Sión (Fabre). And the people from Juanjui believe that Pajatén, which is generally regarded as the cradle of the Híbito, had been populated by the Cholón. The confusion about the habitat of both people is presumably caused by the fact that the Franciscans had gathered the Cholón and the Híbito together in the same mission, and that they have amalgated by intermarriage. By this cohabitation and amalgation the distinction between Cholón and Híbito settlements and, thus, between the Cholón and the Híbito identity may have become less outspoken. The fact that their languages were disappearing to make way for Quechua and Spanish may have contributed to this loss of distinctivity.
About the moment of disappearance of the languages, of Híbito particularly, there is some disagreement. The HSAI informs that around 1825 Híbito is no longer spoken. It appears however that the language was spoken until the 1960s. Pöppig

39
mentions in 1836 that the Híbito differ from the Cholón in their tongue. In his book Die Indianer Nordost-Perus from 1930, Tessmann still reports on speakers of Híbito. In 1854 Herndon & Gibbon report on 500 Híbito speakers in the Tocache district. In 1968, Loukotka calls Híbito a nearly extinct language. Finally, in 1976, the Encyclopaedia Britannica says that Híbito is no longer spoken. This is also assumed by Wise (1985) and by Fabre (1994), who believes that, today, the Híbito speak San Martín Quechua or Spanish. The language indeed seems to be extinct. With respect to the disappearance of Cholón, the Encyclopaedia Britannica considers Cholón as an extinct language in 1976. This is also what Wise notes in 1985. Solís, however, mentions two speakers in 1987, which is repeated by Fabre. Nowadays, one of these speakers is dead, whereas the other one appears to be a descendant who does not speak Cholón (see section 2.4.2).
2.4.2. Descendants As already stated, in the summer of 1996 a journey was made by the author to the valley of the Huallaga to search for possible speakers of Cholón and Híbito. In Pachiza, a meet-ing was arranged with Mrs. Natividad Grández del Castillo, a Híbito woman of 90 years old. However, the old lady did not remember the language of her youth. I was told that another Híbito lady, Mrs. Juliana Chispa, had already died some forty years earlier. In Juanjui I met Mrs. Aurelia Gutiérrez Cerquera, a Cholón descendant of 76 years old. Her niece, the late Mrs. Victoria Cerquera Ojeda (who had died in 1993), was one of the consultants of Sofía Latorre. Mrs. Gutiérrez knew some Quechua and four or five Híbito words. The second consultant, Mr. José Santos Chapa Ponce (70 years in 1996), lives in Valle. Mrs. Gutiérrez and Mr. Chapa consider Sión as the habitat of the Híbito. Neither Mrs. Gutiérrez nor Mr. Chapa could speak Cholón, but they remembered a few words and expressions (some 150 items). Their grandparents spoke Cholón. The inhabitants of Juanjui claim Cholón to be the language of the ancient Pajatén people. The de-scendants living in the Lower Huallaga region seem to have dissociated themselves from the way their grandfathers had lived, and to have adapted themselves to a mestizo way of life. The people I met in Juanjui, Sión and environs were living in brick houses furnished with beds, chairs, tables, audio and video equipment.
In the Upper Huallaga area, in a small town on the Monzón River, named Cachicoto, the public relations official of the town, Guillermo Pahuelo Storko, informed me that once in a while some people to whom he referred as Cholón descend from the mountains, from Chavín and its vicinity for example, to sell and barter their food (salted fish) on the market that is held on Sundays before the church. On these occasions these people speak Spanish. However, they master another language. This is probably Quechua, although either Cholón or a mixed dialect can not be excluded as possibilities.
It is possible that there is still a small number of Cholón speakers left. They may be living in the remote, mountainous areas west and east of the river Huallaga. The original territory of the Cholón is so extensive and it has so many impassable, impenetrable areas, of which some are still uncharted, that the presence of Cholón

40
speakers could remain unnoticed. It is also probable that there are speakers of Cholón living in less remote and more accessible areas or in villages, who refuse to speak the idioma ‘language’, because they are ashamed of it, and because they are afraid to be considered as primitives and savages, if they would speak it. Furthermore, it is not impossible that there are still de-scendants who speak a mixed dialect with Cholón elements.

3. The Arte de la Lengua Cholona, a colonial grammar
3.1. Introduction As already stated, Cholón is possibly no longer spoken in the region of the Middle Hua-llaga, and Fray Pedro de la Mata’s Arte de la Lengua Cholona appears to be the only extensive source of information about the language. In this chapter the codex containing Pedro de la Mata’s grammar and the grammar itself will be discussed. Section 3.2 will be dedicated to the manuscript and its composition, and in section 3.3 we shall focus on the composition of the language description.
In order to gain an impression of the text written by Pedro de la Mata and of the handwriting of Gerónimo Clota, the missionary who copied Pedro de la Mata’s grammar, a photocopy of the beginning and of the end of the Arte de la Lengua Cholona are added in Appendix 2. The copy of the first page of the grammar (fol. 6 according to the numbering of the British Library, see section 2.2) shows that Pedro de la Mata began his grammar with a paragraph about sounds. This is a classical beginning, as we shall see in section 3.3. The photocopy of the last two pages (pp. 248 and 249, viz. fol. 131 verso and 132 recto according to the numbering of the British Library) presents, among other things, the dates of the manuscript and its copy, together with the name of the author, Pedro de la Mata, and the signature of the copyist, Gerónimo Clota. Underneath Gerónimo Clota’s signature we find the names of Cholón and Híbito settlements which were not yet christianized.
3.2. The manuscript In the following section we shall pay attention to the history and the characteristics of the codex known as Arte de la Lengua Cholona (section 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, respectively), and to the transcribers responsible for the transcription of Cholón and the different hands encountered in the Arte (section 3.2.3).
3.2.1. History The present Arte de la Lengua Cholona appears to be a faithful copy of the Arte de la Lengua Cholona written by Pedro de la Mata. The manuscript is namely signed by Fray Gerónimo Clota, who declares that he completed the copy in the village of San Buenaventura del Valle on February 19th of the year 1772. San Buenaventura del Valle was a Franciscan mission situated on the left bank of the Huallaga River (see also chapter 2). Gerónimo Clota designates a certain Fray Pedro de la Mata as the author of the grammar. According to him Pedro de la Mata finished his Arte de la Lengua Cholona in Truxillo (Trujillo), a city situated on the north coast of Peru, on October 24th, 1748. Clota’s copy was brought to France, to Paris, by Amédée Chaumette des Fossés, consul general of France in Peru in 1830 (cf. chapter 2.1). Parts of Chaumette des Fossés’ library were successively sold by auction after his death. At an auction held in Paris in 1842, baron Pierre Leopold van Alstein, professor of linguistics at the University of Ghent (Belgium), bought a number of books of Chaumette des Fossés’ library, including the Arte de la Lengua Cholona. When professor van Alstein died, his library was also put up for auc-tion. The sale

42

took place at van Alstein’s house in May 1863. A London librarian, B.M. Quaritch, purchased a part of the manuscripts for the British Library, amongst which Fray Pedro de la Mata’s Arte de la Lengua Cholona. The volume was catalogued by the British Library on July 11th, 1863, under the number Additional Ms. 25,322.

3.2.2. Characteristics The codex Additional Ms. 25,322, which contains Fray Pedro de la Mata’s grammar, is a small in octavo. It is a brown, morocco-bound volume with red marbled end leaves. The manuscript is on paper. The volume owes its outward appearance to the British Library which bound and numbered it anew. Originally, the folios of the manuscript were numbered by Fray Gerónimo Clota. He started numbering the pages after the folios containing the table of contents. According to his numbering, the manuscript comprised 249 pages. However, the numbers 243 and 244 are omitted, and the text of page 242 continues without lacunae on page 245. On the other hand, there are two folios which have not been numbered by Gerónimo Clota and which must have been written by him afterwards. They were inserted between page 236 and 237, although the content of both folios does not match with the content of these pages (nor with that of pages 242 and 245). Gerónimo Clota’s numeration was barred by the British Library and has been replaced by a numbering in pencil. According to this numbering the manuscript has 132 folios (1 recto and verso - 132 recto, cf. the copies appended). The British Library also numbered the folios which contain the table of contents, so that Gerónimo Clota’s page 1 corresponds to folio 6 recto in the numbering of the British Library. In the volume bound by the British Library, folio 61 recto and verso is a paper leaf of a more recent date. It obviously was not part of Clota’s manuscript and must have been added later. It contains four lines written in an unidentified language, accompanied by a translation in French. The fact that they had been translated into French suggests that it was Chaumette des Fossés who copied or transcribed the lines. They read as follows:

Sho-de-ga-chu Seet-se-be Mong-shong-shan Hee-la’h-deh

la main sanglante ‘the bleeding hand’ le soleil du midi ‘the midday sun’ le cypres incliné ‘the arched cypress’ la pure fontaine ‘the pure fountain’

3.2.3. Hands and transcribers The transcription of the Cholón language can be attributed to at least three persons: the Franciscan friars Pedro de la Mata and Gerónimo Clota, and a later transcriber. At least two hands can be distinguished in the Arte: first, the hand of Gerónimo Clota, the copyist of Pedro de la Mata’s grammar; second, that of the later transcriber. In his copy Gerónimo Clota clearly indicates Pedro de la Mata as the author of the Arte de la Lengua Cholona. It is therefore likely that we owe the transcription of the Cholón data primarily to Pedro de la Mata. In the last paragraph of the grammar, Pedro de la Mata refers to his predecessors, Fray Joseph de Araujo

43
and Fray Francisco Gutiérrez de Porres, who “converted and baptized many Cholón and Híbito, and who, with apostolic zeal, initiated them into the Mysteries of the Holy Faith”. Concerning the notation of what he calls guturaciones ‘gutturalizations’ or ‘guttural sounds’ (see also section 4.1), Pedro de la Mata states that he transcribed these sounds the same way as Araujo and Gutierres used to, so that both priests can be held responsible for the rendering of de la Mata’s guttural. (It can not be excluded that Pedro de la Mata, for his part, copied parts of the artes made by Araujo and Gutiérrez [see Introduction, Linguistic data], when he composed his own arte). In the Arte de la Lengua Cholona, a number of symbols employed to transcribe Cholón sounds and a number of Cholón words have been rectified or replaced. The handwriting of most of the replacements and, in the majority of cases, the colour of the ink are similar to the handwriting of the copy and to the ink used. Since it is Gerónimo Clota who wrote the copy, these rectifications were apparently his work. Gerónimo Clota can therefore be considered as the second transcriber of the Cholón language described in the ALC. In some cases, the handwriting is the same, but the colour of the ink is different. In those cases, the difference may be due to fading or to the fact that it concerns a later rectification for which Gerónimo Clota used another sort of ink. The handwriting of a small number of replacements and the handwriting of the list of non-converted Cholón and Híbito villages added at the end of the grammar differs from the handwriting of Gerónimo Clota. The colour of the ink also differs. These replacements and the list of villages are clearly from another hand, viz. a third, anonymous, transcriber. However, it is not sure whether the handwriting of all these replacements and of the added list are from one and the same person. It is also possible that the list of non-converted settlements and part of the replacements are from different hands. For convenience sake, all the later replacements, rectifications and additions of which the handwriting differs from that of Gerónimo Clota are tentatively ascribed to the second hand, viz. the third transcriber.
3.3. The description of Cholón The Arte de la Lengua Cholona is an eighteenth-century grammar and is typically a product of its time. It has some characteristics in common with other colonial grammars, such as the use of an inconsistent orthography, of a certain register and of a specific grammatical model. These characteristics have repercussions for the description of the language (Alexander-Bakkerus, 2000). In the following sections we shall glance at the spelling employed for the transcription of Cholón, at the register used (which is the result of the purpose for which the grammar had been composed), and at the model according to which the language is described.

44
3.3.1. Spelling In the eighteenth century orthography was not standardized yet, so that words could be written in different ways. A sound could thus be represented by different graphemes or symbols, and, vice versa, one symbol could refer to different sounds. This makes the interpretation of symbols employed for the transcription of the language difficult. In Pedro de la Mata’s Arte de la Lengua Cholona, for example, the third person singular beneficiary is indicated by the forms ha, sa, or xa; the ablative case alternates between the forms -ge, -he, -je; and the word for ‘to speak’ is transcribed as hilan, jilan, silan, xilan. At first sight, the symbols g, h, j, s, x seem to refer to the same sound. After a thorough analysis it appears that the graphemes h and j indeed symbolize the same sound, if they occur in initial position; that this sound is also represented by the symbol g before i and e; and that the symbols s and x refer to different sounds that are not relevantly distinctive from each other. Furthermore, to represent a so-called ‘guttural’, viz. a velar nasal, several symbols are used, amongst which the symbol ñ. However, this symbol is bivalent and is also employed to represent a palatal nasal. (For the analysis and the values of the consonant symbols mentioned above, see chapter 4).
An additional consequence of the fact that the orthography was not regulated yet is that two separate words could be written as a single word, whereas a word consisting of two morphemes could be written as two words. For instance, according to Pedro de la Mata, the optative preterite of the verb ‘to be’ is alternatively written as cotte moc cot, cottemoc cot or cotte moccot ‘he wished to be’. On further consideration, the second option, cottemoc cot, appears to be the most appropriate transcription for the expression ‘he wished to be’. The morpheme moc ‘wished’ can, in fact, be analyzed as a nominal suffix, and it is only in cottemoc cot that it is indeed represented as a suffix. In this form moc is suffixed to a nominalized form (the infinitive) of the verb cotan ‘to be’. In the other options, cotte moc cot and cotte moccot, the suffix moc is represented as a detached morpheme and as a prefix, respectively.
3.3.2. Purpose and register Most of the colonial grammars or artes were written by priests or missionaries. In order to be able to preach the Word of God and to make as many converts as possible in a certain region, they had to learn the language of the people living in that area. A grammar of the language was thus a great help - not only for them, but also for later generations of missionaries - when they had to translate Bible verses, prayers, hymns, and when they had to write a sermon. The artes of Franciscan friars were primarily written for missionary purposes. When a priest was transferred, his grammar together with all his notes, translations and sermons was left behind for his successor. Being of domestical use, the material of the book was sometimes unordered. For instance, in the Arte de la Lengua Cholona the section about verbos compuestos ‘compound verbs’ occurs twice, and that of the transiciones ‘transitions’ (fol. 83 recto - 89 verso) is completed elsewhere (fol. 125 recto - 126 recto). Another characteristic which Pedro de la Mata’s grammar has in common

45

with many other artes is the language register which is used in the examples. Since the grammar was written with the objective to preach the Gospel, the register of the phrases which illustrate all kinds of grammatical facts is predominantly religious and the tone is often moralistic (the spelling of the following example is the one as proposed in chapter 4):

mi Pedro me-kt-aõ, ko ta nyan-te a-n-iglesia-wo-kt-aõ 2s Pedro 2sS-be-IA this stone face-AD 1sP-REL-church-VB-F-IA ‘You are Peter, [and] on this stone I shall build my church.’

kol o…o ixiwah ø-kot-aõ, utsa-wa kol i-mit-aõ

death big bad

3sS-be-IA sin-TO death 3sA-3sO.exceed-IA

‘It is better to die, than to sin.’ (literally: ‘Death is a great evil, but sin exceeds it.’)

3.3.3. Tradition and model From time immemorial men have thought about language and its structure, and our grammars are built on the works of earlier generations of philosophers. Many linguistic concepts which we use today were already common property in classical antiquity. Plato, for instance, observed that time can be segmented into past, present and future (Quilis, 1980: 32). According to Aristotle, Protagoras distinguished masculine from feminine and inanimate (Quilis, 1980: 27). Aristotle introduced, amongst other things, the concepts of subject and predicate (Van Peursen, 1958: 82). He also introduced categories like substance, quantity, quality, possession, situation, action and subjection (Störig, 1988: 167). In his Technè ‘art’, Dionysius the Thracian, +/- 200-100 B.C. (Lallot, 1989: 40-65) distinguished seven vowels: a, e, ‘, i, o, Ç, u; five moods: indicative, imperative, optative, conjunctive, infinitive, and divided the sentence into eight constituents: noun, pronoun, verb, participle, article, preposition, adverb, conjunction. In addition, he gives the complete conjugation of a verb. Latin philosophers such as Varro, 116- 26 B.C. (Collart, 1954), Donatus, +/- 350 A.D. (Keil, 1864, IV: 353-402), Priscian, +/- 600 A.D. (Keil, 1855-59, II-III) adopted Aristotle’s philosophical observation about time consisting of past, present and future, and crystallized these notions into tenses, subdividing the past into praeteritum perfectum, imperfectum and plus-quamperfectum. Like Dionysius the Thracian, they also distinguished five moods and eight partes orationis ‘parts of the sentence’ including the interjection but excluding the article. The works in question of the philosophers mentioned above, except for Dionysius’ Technè, are purely theoretical. In the books concerned the writers philosophize about grammatical questions; they do not give paradigms. (Dionysius was the first theoretician who gave a paradigm as an illustration). This is because language teaching was not the aim; their writings were not meant to be used as grammars. Rather, their first objective was to teach poetics and poetic diction. The second objective was to teach the reader to value poetry. As a consequence, these works have a specific structure. Since knowledge of the structure of the language was a pre-requisite for poetic diction, the philosophers began the book with a

46
dissertation about voice and sounds or ‘elements’. The chapter about voice and elements was followed by chapters in which the syllable, the word and the sentence were successively discussed. The last part of the book, the largest part, was devoted to prosody and to poetry itself. In this part, fragments of works of great poets were shown in order to illustrate the beauty and supremacy of the art of poetry. The same objectives and the same ordering (voice/ sounds - syllables - words - sentences prosody/ poetry) are encountered in the first non-Latin grammar: the Gramática de la Lengua Castellana written by Antonio de Nebrija in the year of 1492. However, besides the ambition to teach and promote Spanish poetry, Nebrija also sought to teach the Spanish language to those who did not have Spanish as their mother tongue. He wrote the last book of his grammar (Book V) “for those who want to learn Spanish”. Therefore, Nebrija gives, among other things, a thorough analysis of the Spanish vowels and consonants, an adapted version of the current spelling, several nominal paradigms, and the conjugation of a verb (like Dionysius did in his Technè), casu quo the verb amar ‘to love’. The Spanish noun and verb are still treated, partly, after the Latin model. Nebrija declines the Spanish noun and attributes to it the same cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, vocative) as Latin has - he does the same with the adjectives, the pronouns and the relatives -, and, as far as the verb is concerned, he also distinguishes five moods (indicative, imperative, optative, subjunctive, infinitive) and five tenses (see below).
However, this Latin model, consisting of a nominal declension with six cases and according to which each mood and each tense has its own paradigm, is not valid for Spanish. The Spanish noun has no case endings (the genitive and the dative, for instance, are formed by means of a preposition), and no distinct paradigms for the optative and the subjunctive. The forms of the optative and the subjunctive appear to be the same, on the understanding that the optative present, imperfect and future correspond to the subjunctive imperfect, pluperfect and present, respectively; and that the optative is expressed by means of the words o si ‘oh if’ (optative present and imperfect) and ojalá ‘I hope’ (future) preceding the forms, whereas the forms of the subjunctive are preceded by the word como ‘if’.
Nevertheless, Nebrija’s Gramática de la Lengua Castellana undeniably marks a new era in which a grammar was no longer considered as a book of art (in the Middle Ages, grammar belonged to the seven artes liberales ‘liberal arts’: grammar, rhetoric, dialectics, geometry, arithmetics, astronomy and music) written for the benefit of poetry, but as a book written for the benefit of language teaching. The reputation of Nebrija as an innovator is not only based on the fact that he wrote the first non-Latin grammar and the first book with the object to teach a language, but also on the fact that he introduced new perceptions and new elements into his language description (see the adapted orthography, for instance). Another innovation is that Nebrija classifies the gerund, the infinitive and the participle in one mood, the infinitive mood, consisting of three forms: a gerund, a nombre participial infinitivo ‘infinitive participle noun’ and a participle. Since the participle belongs to the eight parts of the sentence, Nebrija considers the gerund and his infinitive participle noun also as parts of the sentence. In Spanish he then

47
distinguishes ten partes orationis instead of eight: noun, pronoun, article, verb, participle, gerund, nombre participial infinitivo ‘infinitive participle noun’, preposition, adverb, conjunction. Furthermore, Nebrija is the first linguist who explicitly points out that Latin has actually two future tenses (Quilis, 1980: 40): a futurum imperfectum and perfectum, versus languages such as Spanish which have only one. Another improvement is that Nebrija preferably uses a non-Latin terminology in his description of Spanish. He designates the tenses by Spanish names and employs the terms no acabado ‘not finished’ and acabado ‘finished’ to indicate the concepts ‘imperfect’ and ‘perfect’, respectively. Nebrija thus distinguishes the following tenses: presente ‘present’, passado no acabado ‘imperfect’, passado acabado ‘perfect’, passado más que acabado ‘pluperfect’, venidero ‘future’. In addition to the past tenses of the indicative, optative and subjunctive, Nebrija also gives alternative paradigms which express the same notions por rodeo ‘by a roundabout way’ and/or en otra manera ‘in another way’. The forms of these paradigms are usually composite forms consisting of a finite form of the auxiliary ser ‘to be’ or haber ‘to have’ followed by the past participle of a verb. For instance, for the perfect tense of the indicative, a paradigm which begins with the form amé ‘I loved’, Nebrija gives two alternative paradigms: first, el mesmo tiempo, por rodeo ‘the same tense, by a roundabout way’ beginning with the form e amado ‘I have loved’; second, el mesmo tiempo, por rodeo en otra manera ‘the same tense, by a roundabout way in another way’ which begins with the form ove amado ‘I have loved’.
Traces of this long tradition of language description are found in the Arte de la Lengua Cholona. Pedro de la Mata also opens his grammar with sounds and he also ends with prosody. In the first paragraph of the ALC de la Mata talks, among other things, about unfamiliar sounds and at the end of the grammar there is a remark about stress. Traditionally, he distinguishes five moods and five tenses and declines the noun as a Latin noun producing a paradigm with six cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, vocative). In addition, Pedro de la Mata often uses the Latin terminology, for instance, to designate the tenses: praesens, imperfectum, perfectum, plus quam perfectum, futurum. Like the Latin grammarians Pedro de la Mata distinguishes in Cholón: (a) eight parts of the sentence: noun, pronoun, verb, participle, postposition, adverb, interjection, conjunction (since Cholón has no prepositions - directives, locatives and the like are suffixed to a noun or a nominal form - Pedro de la Mata replaced the preposition with the postposition); (b) a gerund and a participle which are not considered as separate parts of the sentence; (c) four gerund cases: genitive, dative, accusative and ablative; (d) supines I and II; (e) two indicative future tenses: imperfect and perfect. It is understandable that de la Mata recurs to Latin and to the Latin paradigms in his description of Cholón. As a priest, he was familiar with Latin and the Latin grammar. He was probably also influenced by Nebrija. In an article about colonial

48
grammars of indigenous Colombian languages, Christine Dümmler (1997: 413-432) remarks that these grammars are based on Nebrija’s Introductiones Latinae from 1481; and that the writers of the colonial grammars analyzed by her had taken Nebrija’s description of Latin as a model in order to describe the Amerindian language. In the introduction of their textedition of the Introductiones Latinae from 1488, a bilingual Latin - Spanish grammar, Esparza and Calvo (1996: xxiv) remark that Nebrija himself makes a distinction between an “orden natural de la gramática” ‘natural order of grammar’, which is used to describe the own language, and an “orden de la doctrina” ‘doctrinaire order’, which is used for the description of a foreign langauge. The former order starts with a complete explanation of the ‘letters’ (sounds) followed by that of syllables, words and the parts of the sentence in order to end with a discussion about belles-lettres. The latter starts with a short overview of the ‘letters’, syllables and parts of the sentence, and ends with paradigms illustrating the declension and conjugation of words and verbs. On page xxiii Esparza and Calvo show that this is indeed the order which Nebrija employs when he - in Book V of his Gramática de la Lengua Castellana - teaches Spanish to non-Spanish speakers. As we have seen, this order is more or less followed by Pedro de la Mata. However, conversely to what Nebrija prescribes, he does not end with paradigms. Paradigms are found in different sections, and de la Mata ends with some observations about structure of the sentence, accent, pronunciation and orthography. The influence of Nebrija’s Gramática de la Lengua Castellana is mainly noticeable in the fact that, like Nebrija, de la Mata also adds alternative paradigms to the five tenses, representing them in otra manera ‘another way’; and that he also uses the words o si ‘oh if’ and ojalá ‘I hope’ to form an optative. Pedro de la Mata furthermore distinguishes a permissive, a prohibitative and a dubitative. As a consequence, his conjugation of a verb presents a large amount of paradigms (36) and forms (219, including a participle form and 2 gerund forms which do not occur in a paradigm, but appear as independent forms). Table 3.2 gives an overview of Pedro de la Mata’s arrangement of the verb. It gives evidence of the profusion of paradigms (and forms) distinguished by de la Mata.
As already stated, in his description of the Cholón language de la Mata sometimes uses Latin as a model. At first sight, this may obscure the grammatical facts. For example, in Pedro de la Mata’s declension of the noun appear a nominative in -tup and in -a/-va, a genitive in -ilou, an accusative and an ablative in -te. The fact that -tup, -a/-va, -ilou, -te occur as endings in the declension of a noun may suggest that these elements are case endings, which they are not. The element -tup appears to be an agent marker consisting of adessive -tu + ablative -(a)p; and -a/-va a topic marker. The form ilou is a verbal form consisting of a third person singular marker i, an object marker -l- and the perfect of ‘to do’ -ou: i-l-ou ‘he made it’. The suffix -te functions as a locative ‘at’, ‘in’ and as a directive ‘to(wards)’. It is used after objects; after persons occurs the suffix -tu.
With regard to the verb, the Latin model does not satisfy either. For instance, Pedro de la Mata mentions an imperfect and a perfect tense. However, both Latin tenses are represented by the same paradigm, so that we may conclude that there is

49

no distinction between imperfect and perfect in Cholón. In addition, de la Mata’s conjugation presents an overlap of tenses and forms, so that some Latin moods or tenses can be omitted. The preterite imperfect/perfect of the indicative, for instance, has the same verbal forms as the preterite of the participle; the imperative future and the infinitive present also have the same forms; the same holds for the infinitive future and the participle future which present the same paradigm; the permissive and the optative also have a paradigm in common; the first person plural of the imperative corresponds to the first person plural of the infinitive present; and the third person singular and plural of the imperative are similar to those of the permissive/optative paradigm. In chapter 7 we shall further analyze Pedro de la Mata’s ‘moods’ and ‘tenses’.
A summary of the table of contents, as they have been written in 1772 by Gerónimo Clota, the transcriber of Pedro de la Mata’s grammar, are given below in Table 3.1. Table 3.2 contains an overview of Pedro de la Mata’s conjugation of the verb.

4. Sounds and symbols
4.1. Introduction In this chapter we propose a reconstruction of the Cholón sound system on the basis of the data presented by Pedro de la Mata. For this purpose, we shall first consider de la Mata’s observations concerning the use of certain symbols and the sounds represented by these symbols. Then we shall examine the full inventory of symbols found in the ALC, as well as their use. In section 4.2 the vowel symbols will be discussed, and in section 4.3 the consonant symbols.
The orthography or notation employed to transcribe the Cholón language can be ascribed to Pedro de la Mata. Gerónimo Clota, the transcriber of the ALC, and a later hand (see 3.2.3) are responsable for a number of replacements. In the analysis of the use of the symbols, we will look at their distribution and at their distinctivity in relation to other symbols. The many replacements of symbols that are found in the text will also be scrutinized. When necessary, reference will be made to the spoken data recorded in Peru in the summer of 1996 (see 2.4.2) in order to justify an interpretation.
On the basis of the analysis and the interpretation of the symbols used in the ALC, it will be possible to establish an inventory of sounds and a tentative representation of the language’s sound system. Subsequently, a practical spelling will be proposed (section 4.7). This spelling will facilitate the presentation and the analysis of the grammatical facts of the language (chapters 5 - 10).
4.1.1. Pedro de la Mata’s observations on the symbols In book I, paragraph 1 (fol. 1), de la Mata provides us with information about some of the symbols which he employs to represent Cholón sounds. Not all symbols used in the ALC are discussed here. The remarks concern those symbols which obviously have a different function in the transcription of Cholón with regard to their use in the representation of Spanish: symbols that are not necessary for the interpretation of Cholón, symbols with a language-specific interpretation, and symbols representing a phenomenon referred to as “guturacion” (henceforth ‘gutturalization’).
In the initial paragraph, de la Mata indicates the symbols that are not “pronounced” in Cholón: “B, D, F, y la R”2. This statement can be interpreted to the effect that the sounds these symbols normally represent in Spanish are not found in the Cholón language. Notwithstanding this, the symbols b, d, f and r do occur in loan words (section 4.4), and the symbol b is encountered in a few Cholón words as well (see section 4.3.2).
Furthermore, Pedro de la Mata lists symbols that represent non-Spanish sounds. To this category belong the vowel symbols e and o, and the consonant
2 “No se pronuncia en esta lengua las letras B, D, F, y la R, [...]” ‘In this language, the letters B, D, F and R, [...] are not pronounced’.

52

symbols g, h, and j. Concerning the vowel symbols e and o, he writes: “La E la pronuncian entre E y Y, esto es, que es ni E claro, ni Y. La O la pronuncian entre O y U”3. This remark seems to indicate that the vowels corresponding to the symbols e and o, as they are used in the transcription of Cholón, possibly had a higher or a more closed articulation than in Spanish. Regarding the consonant symbols g, h, j, Pedro de la Mata remarks: “La G en el principio de los nombres, y verbos unas veces la pronuncian como g4 y otras como C. La J la pronuncian como los estrangeros. La G antes de E, y de la I la pronuncian tan suave como J. La H â veces como J y â veces apenas se percibe”5. The symbols e, o, g, h, and j have been singled out, because their values do not coincide with those of the corresponding symbols in Spanish (cf. section 4.2.5 and 4.3.10).
Finally, Pedro de la Mata mentions a phenomenon that he designates by the name of gutturalization. He states that it can be used with any of the five vowels a, e, i, o, u: “Usan guturacion [...] con todas sinco A E I O U”6. In continuation, he provides the reader with five examples of gutturalization followed by each of these vowels:

ng~aan (1)

‘he makes me’

(a)

ng~uech (2)

‘his mother’

(e)

ng~ix (3)

‘something dry’

(i)

milongoque (4) ‘you would have made it’ (o)

ng~uch (5)

‘his father’

(u)

We shall see in section 4.3.11 that there is a strong evidence that de la Mata’s gutturalized sound represents a velar nasal7.

3 ‘E is pronounced between E and I, i.e. it is neither a clear E, nor I. O is pronounced between O and U’.
4 In the citations, de la Mata’s use of capitals and small letters has been maintained, although the difference between capitals and small letters does not seem to be relevant. For the discussion of the relevance of this distinction see section 4.3.10.
5 ‘At the beginning of nouns and verbs, G is sometimes pronounced as g, and sometimes as C. J is pronounced as the foreigners do. G before E and I is pronounced as softly as J. H sometimesas as J, and sometimes it is hardly perceived’.
6 ‘Gutturalization is used with all five A E I O U’
7 At the end of the ALC, in a paragraph named “Dela orthografia”, Pedro de la Mata refers to his opening statement about the pronunciation of gutturalizations, and he writes: “La orthografia de esta lengua es la que esta puesta en todas las declinaciones, conjugaciones, oraciones y exemplos hasta aqui escritos y quanto â las [...] guturaciones, como no ay letras con que expresarlas, las he puesto del mismo modo que usaron los V.V.P.P. Fr. Francisco Gutierres de Porres y Fr. Joseph de Araujo” ‘The orthography of this language is the one used in all the declinations, conjugations, phrases and examples written till now, and concerning the [...] gutturalizations, since there are no letters to express them, I wrote them in the same way as the Venerable Fathers, Fr. Francisco Gutierres de Porres and Fr. Joseph de Araujo, used to do’ (cf. the copy of the last page

53
4.1.1.1. Evaluation The introductory paragraph brings to light the difficulties de la Mata encountered in his endeavours to transcribe the unfamiliar sounds of Cholón. Notwithstanding his efforts, the description of these sounds remains unclear on certain points. For instance, the observations that a sound is “neither a clear E, nor I” and that a sound is “pronounced between O and U” do not explain how these sounds must be articulated. Also ambiguous remains the clarification of the use of the symbols g, h and j (Alexander-Bakkerus, 2005, in press). According to Pedro de la Mata, the symbol g in initial position can symbolize two sounds: a sound that can be represented by the symbol g and another sound that can be symbolized by the grapheme c. At the same time, the symbol g is equivalent to j before the symbols e and i. It can furthermore have the same value as the symbol h, because h is sometimes equivalent to j. About the symbol j de la Mata says that it is “pronounced” as foreigners would pronounce it and that it represents a ‘soft’ sound. The symbol h also appears to be plurivalent: sometimes it is equivalent to j, and sometimes ‘it is hardly perceived’. These apparently contradictory statements can be summarized as follows:
#g = g = g/_e, i = j = soft = foreign = sometimes h #g = sometimes c h = sometimes j h = sometimes almost ø
Pedro de la Mata does not define the context in which the symbols g and h are equivalent to g and j, respectively, nor the conditions under which g is equivalent to the symbol c and the conditions under which h is hardly perceived. He also fails to indicate the language and the native country of the foreigners by whom j is “pronounced” in the indicated way. Finally, he does not explain what he means by a ‘soft’ sound.
As for de la Mata’s observation that there are no letters to represent the ‘guttural’ (Sp. ‘gutural’) sound (see note 6 in section 4.1.1), it does not say anything about the phonetic nature of the phenomenon in question. It does not clarify what he means by gutturalization, nor how the corresponding sound should be pronounced.
In the explanation, the symbols e, o, c, g, h, j which Pedro de la Mata employs as reference material obviously have the same value as in Spanish. However, examples of Spanish lexical items containing the symbols that represent the sounds the author has in mind are missing. Another omission, is the fact that no attention is payed to the glottal stop, which must have been present. The data collected in the Huallaga valley (Appendix 7) reveal a frequent occurrence of the glottal stop in 20th century Cholón. Possibly, no observations were made about this phenomenon, because it was not distinctive. There is some evidence that the glottal stop was
of the ALC in Appendix 2).

symbolized in the ALC either by a circumflex accent (section 4.5), by a word-final h or j (section 4.3.10), by a syllable-final c (see section 4.3.3), or by vowel collision (see ma ‘not’, section 11.1).

4.1.2. Symbols employed

As we have seen in section 3.2.3, three different individuals participated in the

transcription of Cholón in the ALC. They used the following symbols of the Latin

alphabet: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, x, y, z. The symbol k

only appears twice in the ALC (see section 4.3.3), where it is used as an equivalent

of the digraph qu. In some positions the symbols v and y are notational variants of u

and i, respectively (cf. section 4.2.4 and 4.2.3). Besides these symbols, the

transcribers also used a number of diacritical marks (section 4.5), namely, a

circumflex accent, a grave accent, an acute accent, and a tilde. The circumflex

accent appears to be a notational variant of the tilde, when it appears above the

symbols g and n. In addition to combinations occur: cc, ch, chch,

the basic g~(u), g^(u),

symbols ~g, hu,

jjl,isltle,dlllal,bomvg~e,

the following mm, nc, ñ, n^,

ng(u), ng~(u), ng^(u), ng~n^, ñg(u), n^g(u), n^g~, ññ, n^n^, pp, qu, ss, tt, tz, yy. The bi-

segmental symbol or digraph hu employed as a notational variant of the symbols b,

u, v is not to be confused with the sequence -hu which consists of two elements: a

consonant symbol h + a vowel symbol u, see cot-hu-â ‘being’, section 4.3.2. The

digraph nc occurs only twice in the ALC. It is employed in the lexical items nenc

‘hand’ (see section 4.3.11) and oncxa ‘deep well’ (see chapter 5, section 3).

Some of the basic and complex symbols mentioned above are symbols

occurring in replacements. In the text of the ALC, a number of symbols have been

modified systematically by the intervention of Gerónimo Clota himself (same

handwriting, same colour of ink) and by the later hand. The modifications generally

consist in superscript replacements of barred symbols. In a few cases, the

modifications are written beneath the line. The replacement of symbols does not

occur consistently, so that a number of words present alternative spellings. Now

they appear in their original, unchanged spelling, now in the altered orthography.

The symbols that can be subject to replacement are the symbols: e, o, ch, h, s/ss, x, and the symbols which have been employed to represent a ‘guttural’ sound: g, g~, n,

ng, n^. These symbols and their replacements are represented in the table below.

The substitution of the symbol tz/z for ch occurs consistently. Another type of modification that occurs frequently is the replacement of consonant symbols by their doubled counterparts. These modifications may concern both simple consonant symbols and complex ones, as is shown in the table below.

In some cases, the substitutions can lead to ambiguity. For instance, the replacement of ng~/ng by ñ/n^, indicating a ‘guttural’ sound, may give rise to misinterpretations, because elsewhere, the grapheme ñ/n^ is employed to indicate a palatal nasal. In other cases, the substitutions clarify the notation. For example, the replacement of the suffix -he ‘benefactive’ by -ge after a morpheme ending in Vc is useful, because the symbol sequence Vche (Vc$ + -he ‘benefactive’) may wrongly be interpreted as [V…e], whereas, in this case, it should be read as [Vkhe] or [Vkxe]. The replacement of Vche by Vcge avoids such misreading.

4.1.3. Conclusion In the ALC the language in which Cholón is described, the metalanguage, is Spanish. The symbols used for the metalanguage are also used for Cholón, the object language. Since the symbols of the object language are similar to those of the metalanguage, there is reason to believe that the former are employed in the same way as the latter. Therefore, the symbols employed for the transcription of Cholón except for e, o, g, h, j, which are explicitly mentioned as having a deviant use - must refer to similar sounds as the corresponding symbols in the metalanguage. However, since there is no adequate account of the use of the symbols, nor of that of the diacritics, it is not possible to obtain absolute certainty on this matter. On the basis of occasional sound specifications and the general framework of the spelling employed, a tentative interpretation of the sounds represented can be made.
4.2. Vowel symbols
4.2.1. Introduction Although Pedro de la Mata mentions the existence of the five vowels a, e, i, o, u, he uses six different graphemes to represent them. The grapheme y must be added to the symbols listed above. As is usual in coeval Spanish texts, y may appear as a notational variant of i. The alternative use of both graphemes is positionally determined and will be treated in section 4.2.3. (In section 4.2.2 the symbol a will be analyzed). Attention will furthermore be paid to the symbol u, which, apart from its usual vowel function, is used as a notational variant of the consonant symbol v in certain positions. The value of the grapheme u will be examined in section 4.2.4. In section 4.2.5 we will discuss the symbols e and o, and the problematic character of the sounds symbolized by these graphemes. In section 4.2.6 a survey of the vowel symbols and their possible value will be given, as well as a tentative vowel system. Combinations of two like vowel symbols, and combinations of a vowel symbol + i/y or u/v (possibly representing diphthongs), will be treated in section 4.2.7 and 4.2.8, respectively.
In the analysis of the vowel symbols a, e, i/y, o, u, we shall, amongst other things, look at their distribution and, on the basis of minimal pairs, at their distinctivity. In most word forms, vowel symbols are separated by one or two consonant symbols (see 5.3). However, sequences of two and even three vowel symbols have also been encountered in the ALC. Along with these vowel sequences, we shall examine the sequences consisting of a vowel symbol + a consonant symbol, and vice versa, that can co-occur in a syllable. As already stated, consonant symbols can consist of one or more elements. Appendix 4.1 shows that the vowel symbols a, e, i/y, o, u may occur before and after the following consonant symbols: b/hu/u/v, c/k/qu, ch, g (non-‘guttural’), g/h/j, i/y, l, ll (non-doubled), m (nonguttural), n (non-guttural), ñ/n^ (non-‘guttural’), p, s/z, t, tz, x, and ng~(u)/m/n representing a ‘guttural’ sound (represented also by the symbols g/g~/g^/~g/mg~/ng/ng~/ng^/ng~n^/ñ/n^/ñg/n^g/n^g~/nc). It should be noticed, that (i) a, e, i, o, u are never found before b/hu/v, they are found before u instead;

57

(ii) a, e, i, o, u never occur before k/qu, they do occur before c instead; (iii) i, o, u are not encountered before g (equal to h/j), but they are encountered before h/j, as are a and e; (iv a, e, i, o, u do not appear before g (non-‘guttural’ and not equal to h/j); (v) a does not occur before ñ/n^ (non-‘guttural’); (vi) a, e, i, o, u are never found before ng~, they are found before m/n instead; (vii) a, o, i are not encountered after b, and e, i, o, u not after hu, the five vowel symbols a, e, i, o, u are however encountered after u/v; (viii) a, o, u do not occur after g (equal to h/j), they do occur after h/j, and only e and i are found after g (equal to h/j); (ix) only a occurs after g (non-‘guttural’ and not equal to h/j); (x) a, o, u do not occur after k/qu, but they do occur after c; (xi) e and i are not found after c, but after k/qu; (xii) the vowel symbols a, e, i, o, u are not encountered after m/n representing a ‘guttural’ sound, but after ng~(u). The sequences Vb/hu/v, ig, og, ug, Vk/qu, añ/n^, ba, bi, bo, hue, hui, huo, huu, go, gu, ka, ko, ku, qua, quo, quu, Vng~, m/nV have not been encountered within a syllable. Table 4.2.1 will show the occurrence of the vowel symbols a, e, i, o, u with regard to the consonant symbols b/hu/u/v, c/k/qu, g/h/j, g (non-‘guttural’, not equal to h/j), ng~(u)/m/n (‘guttural’), ñ/n^ (non-‘guttural’).

The occurrence is marked by a plus sign, the non-occurrence by a minus sign, the terms ‘guttural’, non‘guttural’ and ‘g equal to h/j’ are indicated by the symbols g, n-g and g=h/j, respectively.

4.2.2. Symbol a Since Pedro de la Mata gives no comments on the use of the symbol a, it is probable that the sound represented by this symbol was not problematic. Therefore, it may be assumed that his symbol a had the same value as in Spanish and that the sound represented by it did not deviate from Spanish [a].
The symbol a can occur before the symbols i, e, o, u, and after the symbols i, e, u:

main (3155) maecqui (2186) aoitzan (1006) micolehauch (1785) tonlian (654) ayteaj! (2195) cothuâ (1588)

(ma-in) (m-a-ec-qui) (a-o-itz-an) (mi-cole-ha-uch) (a-ton-li-an) (ayte-aj) (cot-hu-â)

‘not yet’ ‘Give me!’ ‘I am made’ ‘your (p) lover’ ‘I sit down’ ‘Be quiet!’ ‘being’

In these examples and in the following instances of vowel sequences (sections 4.2.3 - 4.2.5), the successions of vowel symbols are all intersected by a morpheme boundary (cf. the forms in parentheses).
Regarding the occurrence of the vowel symbol a + a consonant symbol within a syllable, a has been found to occur before and after the consonant symbols or a variant/equivalent of the consonant symbols named in section 4.2.1, except before the symbol ñ/n^ (non-‘guttural’), cf. section 4.2.1. No other restrictions concerning the occurrence of a before and after a consonant symbol have been found but for the restrictions mentioned in section 4.2.1. In the example cothuâ ‘being’, the form huâ consists of two syllables and the following morphemes: hu ‘nominalization suffix’ + a ‘topic marker’. The symbol sequence hua, however, can also refer to one syllable. If this is the case, hu is a notational variant of u/v representing the bilabial approximant [w] (see the example llahuan ‘he goes’ in Appendix 4.1).
The minimal pairs below show that the symbol a is used distinctively.

Table 4.3: Minimal pairs with the vowel symbol a

a : i: yap a : e: atpan a : o: pan a : u: pac

‘wild pig’ : ‘I walk’ : ‘mother’ : ‘eight’ :

yip ‘house’ atpen ‘I let walk’ pon ‘group’ (classifier) puc ‘digestible’ (classifier)

4.2.3 Symbol i/y In order to symbolize the high front vowel, Pedro de la Mata uses not only the grapheme i, but also the symbol y. The latter either appears syllable-initially, or syllable-finally after another vowel symbol. In these positions it is used as a notational variant of i:

59

i ~ y : into (2521) ~ ynto (2428) : iel-lo (1452) ~ yel-lo (1452) : eitza (2794) ~ aycha (1420)

‘how’, ‘what’, ‘where’ ‘together’, ‘in pairs’ ‘meat’

In a later section (fol. 10), de la Mata specifies: “la Y [...], si hiere en la letra que le sigue, es ypsylon ô consonante [...], pero si no hiere, es I vocal”8. From the exam-ples it can be deduced that both i and y may symbolize a consonant, a palatal approximant or glide [y], if they appear before a vowel symbol in syllable-initial position, or after a vowel symbol in syllable-final position. When occurring syllable-initially before a consonant symbol, the symbols i and y represent a vowel; i also symbolizes a vowel in other positions: between two consonant symbols and syllable-finally after a consonant symbol. A special case is the final i occurring after a syllable-final consonant symbol in ‘preterite’ forms. In such forms, the grapheme i, may represent a sequence consisting of a high front vowel and a palatal glide (see the paragraph after Table 4.4 and see section 4.2.7.3).
When functioning as a vowel symbol, the grapheme i/y probably had the same value as Spanish [i]. In the sequences of vowel symbols encountered in the Arte, i can occur before the symbols e, a, o and after the symbols e, a, o, u. See the examples main ‘not yet’ and atonlian ‘I sit down’ in section 4.2.2 above, and the examples below:

mienan (2076) mioitzan (1007) g~oliyêinco (1465) hayuilou (22)

(mi-e-n-an) ‘you gave yourself’ (mi-o-itz-an) ‘you are made’ (g~oliy-ê-inco) ‘he who had died’ (hayu-i-lou) ‘the man’s’, ‘of the man’

With respect to the consonant symbols, in a syllable, the vowel symbol i/y can occur before and after all the consonant symbols mentioned in section 4.2.1 (see the examples in Appendix 4.1), except before the consonant symbols b/hu/v and k/qu (see the restrictions in the same section).
Table 4.4 gives evidence that the vowel symbol i/y is employed distinctively.

Table 4.4: Minimal pairs with the vowel symbol i

i : e: zip ‘his house’ :

i : a: yip ‘house’ :

i : o: qui- ‘we’

:

i : u: jil ‘word’ :

zep ‘meat’ yap ‘wild pig’ co ‘there’ jul ‘pine cone’

In a number of ‘preterite’ forms, ‘preterite’ is indicated by a postconsonantal i:

8 ‘Y [...], if it ‘hits’ the letter that follows, is an upsilon or consonant [...], but if it does not ‘hit’, it is a vowel’.

60

aacntg~io(l2li9(66)91)

((aa--cntg~-oi)ll-i)

‘I was’, ‘I have been’ ‘I loved him/her/it’, ‘I have loved him/her/it’

Here i is likely to represent a sequence [iy] instead of just the high vowel [i]. In the ‘pluperfect’ forms, which consist of a ‘preterite’ form + the suffix e/que, ‘preterite’ is namely indicated by the symbols iy and followed by e. The graphemes iy presumably symbolize a sequence of a high front vowel [i] + a palatal glide [y]:

actiye (302) (a-ct-iy-e) ‘I had been’.

If ‘preterite’ would have ended in a vowel [i], it would have been followed by que, not by e. The former is namely used postvocalically, and the latter postconsonantally:

maning~g~oolllilyieha(6q9u7e)(701)

((ma-in-n~g~goolll-li-yi--eh)a-que)

‘I had loved him/her/it’ ‘You (p) have loved him/ her/ it’

Pedro de la Mata says also about ‘preterite’ and ‘pluperfect’ (fol. 24): “[...] el preterito perfecto ê imperfecto se terminan en ay, ey, i l. yí, oy, ou. [...] El preterito plusquamperfecto se forma del preterito perfecto, añadiendole, si acaba en y ye, y si en v ve”9. According to this statement, a final glide is characteristic for ‘preterite’. The last symbol of de la Mata’s ‘preterite endings’ ay, ey, oy, ou may represent a glide: y a palatal glide [y] and u a bilabial glide [w]. In the remark about ‘pluperfect’, the ‘preterite’ ending is again indicated by means of the symbols (y and v), which assumedly represent the glides [y] and [w], respectively (for the value and equivalence of the symbols u and v, see section 4.2.4). Since a final glide is so typical for the ‘preterite’, the third ‘preterite’ending mentioned by de la Mata, i or yi, may therefore be interpreted as [y] or [iy], respectively: [y] after a stem-final vowel (here i) and [iy] after a stem-final consonant: cf.

a(c)quii (1868) acti (296)

(a-(c)qui-i) [akiy] ‘I became’, ‘I was’ (a-ct-i) [aktiy] ‘I was’

4.2.4. Symbol u Like the grapheme i, u may be plurivalent and symbolize two sounds. Whenever u constitutes the nucleus of a syllable, it has vocalic status and may be equivalent to Spanish [u]. In syllable-initial and in syllable-final position, before or after a vowel symbol, it has a consonantal status, and may symbolize a bilabial glide [w]. The use of u as a consonant symbol will be analyzed in section 4.3.2.

9 ‘[...] the preterite perfect and the preterite imperfect end in ay, ey, i or yí, oy, ou. [...] The preterite pluperfect is formed by adding ye to the preterite perfect, if it ends in y, and ve, if it ends in v’.

61

The same restriction as in the case of the final i of an ii sequence - where the final i, although occurring after a vowel symbol, does not necessarily represent a glide - has to be made regarding the final u of a uu combination. It is not sure whether u symbolizes a glide in this position (cf. section 4.2.7.5).
In structures composed of vowel symbols, the symbol u can appear before the symbols i, a, o, and after the symbols e and a:

hayuilou (22) cothuâ (1588) cupul(l)uongo (1074) acoleuch (1062) micolehauch (1785)

(hayu-i-lou)

‘the man’s’, ‘of the man’

(cot-hu-â)

‘being’

(cu-pul(l)u-o-ngo) ‘abominable’

(a-cole-uch)

‘my lover’

(mi-cole-ha-uch) ‘your (p) lover’

The following minimal pairs show that the vowel symbol u represents a distinctive sound.

Table 4.5: Minimal pairs with the vowel symbol u

u : i: jul ‘pine cone’

: jil ‘word’

u : e: lu ‘intestines’, ‘inside’

: le ‘teeth’

u : a: puc ‘digestible’ (classifier) : pac ‘eight’

u : o: -chu ‘negative’, ‘diminutive’ : -cho ‘already’

4.2.5. Symbols e and o The interpretation of the symbols e and o is problematic, because the observations made by Pedro de la Mata about the value of these symbols are not straightforward. Furthermore, although a number of lexical items in the Arte give evidence that e and o are both distinctive, in other cases they appear to be equivalent to i and u, respectively. For the interpretation of the symbols e and o we will review the remarks of de la Mata on these symbols in combination with data extracted from later sources, viz. the word lists of Martínez Compañón, Tessmann, Mrs. Gutiérrez and Mr. Santos Chapa (see chapter 1).

4.2.5.1. Symbol e In the first paragraph of the ALC, Pedro de la Mata remarks that “E has to be pronounced between E and I”, and that it is neither a “clear E nor I”. It may have referred to [w] (an intermediate sound between the vowels [e] and [i]), to [e] (the open counterpart of [e]), or, possibly, to an unrounded central vowel [c].
In the data of Martínez Compañón (MC) and Tessmann (T), the sound or sounds de la Mata’s e presumably refers to are transcribed in various ways. The following notations are found:

62
MC: e, ee, e~ T: e, ‘, e, eI
Martínez Compañón gives no justification of the spelling he uses. As in Spanish, his symbol e may have represented a mid front unrounded vowel. It may have represented a close [e] in open syllables, and an open [e] in closed syllables. At first sight, the double ee could symbolize a long vowel and the tilde nasalization. However, if we compare the words in which the symbols ee and e~ occur with the same words transcribed by Tessmann or recorded from Aurelia Gutiérrez and José Santos Chapa (see Table 4.6), both these interpretations seem unlikely.
The sound represented by double ee in Martínez Compañón’s lexical items peel ‘moon’ and mees-ñgup ‘tree’ is transcribed as e or as e by Tessmann in the forms pel ‘moon’ and meš ‘stick’, respectively. In these transcriptions the vowel does not appear to be long. Tessmann indicates length by means of a macron. Vice versa, a long e in the transcription of Tessmann is not transcribed as a double e by Martínez Compañón. For instance, in the transcription of Tessmann, the lexical item p‘y ‘earth’ has a long e, and Aurelia Gutiérrez also pronounced the word [pe:ykuta§] ‘peccary’ with a long mid vowel, whereas in the transcription of Martínez Compañón length is not indicated. In Martínez Compañón’s word list, the form -pey (< lluspey ‘earth’) is written with a single e. Martínez Compañón would probably have written the form -pey with a double e, if his double e did represent a long vowel. Like Pedro de la Mata, Martínez Compañón obviously did not distinguish long vowels in his transcription, and his single e may have stood for a long vowel as well. So his doubling of e presumably does not indicate length. The sequence ee may, however, have indicated that the vowel had a close articulation in a closed syllable, instead of the expected open articulation, or, on the contrary, it may have designated an open articulation. Martínez Compañón’s ee in the lexical items peel ‘moon’ and mees-ñgup ‘tree’ may then stand for a close-mid front unrounded [e] or an open-mid front unrounded [e]. The latter hypothesis could be true for the lexical item mees-ñgup ‘tree’, because, according to the transcription of Tessmann, the Cholón word for ‘tree’, meš, was pronounced with an open-mid front unrounded [e] (see the discussion about Tessmann’s e below).
Regarding Martínez Compañón’s tilde on the symbol e in the lexical item ve~t ‘fire’, we may note the following. Pedro de la Mata transcribes the word for ‘fire’ as et and Tessmann transcribes it as utmÇ. In both transcriptions, an indication of nasalization is missing. Nasalization is also missing in the word [u:t] ‘fire’, as pronounced by Aurelia Gutiérrez and José Santos Chapa. I therefore assume that the tilde does not symbolize nasalization. Martínez Compañón may have employed the diacritic in order to indicate a centralized articulation. A mid central vowel could very well serve as an intermediary between the mid front articulation suggested by Martínez Compañón’s e without the tilde and the high back articulation expressed by Tessmann’s u in his word for ‘fire’: utmÇ, and by Aurelia Gutiérrez’s and José Santos Chapa’s [u] in their expression for ‘fire’: [u:t]. So if Martínez Compañón’s

63
basic symbol e represented a mid front unrounded vowel [e] or [e], his symbol e~ with a tilde may have represented a mid central unrounded vowel [c].
Tessmann does not explain the value of his symbols. He followed the practice of contemporary German phoneticians in his transcriptions. His basic symbol e without diacritics may thus represent a mid front vowel [e]. Tessmann only explains the use of his diacritics. He states that length is indicated by a macron, width by an underline, brevity by a superscript breve, nasalization by a tilde, and that he uses an arch underneath the vowel to designate that the vowel is “nur gehaucht” (‘only aspirated’). Stress is marked by an acute accent. For modern readers, the terms ‘width’ or ‘wide’, and “nur gehaucht” (‘only aspirated’) are ambiguous.
The former qualification, ‘wide’, is synonymous to ‘open’. German predecessors of Tessmann, phoneticians like C.R. Lepsius and E. Sievers made a distinction between narrow vowels and wide vowels. Lepsius (in Kemp, [1863] 1981: 48) also used an underline to indicate that the vowel concerned had a ‘broad open’ articulation. He gave the following words as examples of the sound represented by his underlined e. In these examples length is represented by a macron, and brevity by a breve. E.g.:
e~ French être, German Bär  English head, French nette, German fett
In his Grundzüge der Phonetik, Sievers states that ‘wide’ is synonymous to ‘open’ (1893: 93). On page 96, he presents the vowel table of Bell (1865) to which he adds Sweet’s description of the vowels (1877) and Storm’s symbols (1892). In this table, the vowel e is designated as being unrounded, and Sievers gives the following instances of the sound which is described as a ‘wide mid-front’ e by Sweet, and which Sievers himself transcribes as e2 (the narrow counterpart is marked by a superscript 1, as e1) : Danish træ, German Männer, English men.
From the observations made by Lepsius and Sievers and from the examples given it can be deduced that, in German linguistic literature of that period, a wide e stood for an open-mid front unrounded [e]. Tessmann’s symbol e is therefore likely to represent an open-mid front unrounded [e], and his lexical item meš tree’ should thus be read as [me•].
The meaning of the term ‘only aspirated’ is open to various interpretations. It may for instance mean that the vowel was only slightly pronounced or ‘whispered’. Such a vowel, a vowel with an arch underneath, is found in Tessmann’s lexical item melieIs ‘canoe’. In this word, the symbol eI thus stands for an ‘only aspirated’ sound, or it may stand for a slightly pronounced, ‘whispered’ [e]. The same lexical item melieIs ‘canoe’ is transcribed as mellus by Pedro de la Mata. In his transcription, Tessmann’s eI appears as u, which probably symbolizes a high back vowel [u]. The vowel represented by Tessmann’s symbol eI could thus be an intermediate vowel between the mid front unrounded vowel symbolized by Tessmanns’s basic symbol e and de la Mata’s supposed high back vowel [u]. This centralized vowel could be a mid central unrounded [c] or schwa, because a schwa is a very short vowel which

64
could be designated as being ‘sligthly pronounced’ or ‘whispered’. Lepsius also uses the term ‘aspirated’. In his terminology, ‘aspirated’ possibly means ‘unvoiced’ (Kemp, 1981: 66*). He distinguishes two ‘unvoiced’, ‘only whispered’ vowels in Rumanian, 0 and ß. (Kemp, [1863] 1981: 168). In his transcription, the ‘whispered’ articulation is marked by a superscript breve. Sievers also mentions an ‘unvoiced’ vowel which is otherwise designated by the terms ‘indefinite’ and ‘murmured’. According to Sievers, the ‘unvoiced’, ‘indefinite’, ‘murmured’ vowel is a shwa [c] (Sievers, 1893: 103). Later, on page 140, he mentions the phenomenon of a “leisen Hauch” (‘slight aspiration’) and remarks that vowels can have a “leise gehauchter Einsatz” (‘lightly aspirated onset’), which, for instance, can be heard in the transition between two vowels and in diphthongs. And he transcribes the rising diphthong [ye] as ieI, as i followed by e with an arch underneath (!).
Therefore, Tessmann’s sequence ieI in the word melieIs is likely to represent a rising diphthong. The ‘only aspirated’ vowel symbolized by his eI may be an ‘unvoiced’, ‘only whispered’ vowel, as observed by Lepsius in Rumanian. This ‘unvoiced’, ‘only whispered’ vowel may also be Sievers ‘unvoiced’, ‘indefinite’, ‘murmured’ vowel [c] or schwa. Tessmann thus distinguishes a mid front vowel [e] that could be articulated with length, with width (as [e] presumably), or with ‘aspiration’ (as [c] possibly).
In our field data recorded in 1996 in Peru, an open-high front vowel [w], instead of close-mid [e], is frequently heard. Since [w] is the intermediate vowel between the vowels [i] and [e], this would confirm the observation of Pedro de la Mata, according to whom the sound corresponding to his symbol e is “pronounced between e and i”. In a closed syllable Mrs. Gutiérrez and Mr. Santos Chapa also pronounced an open-mid [e]. A close-mid [e] could be heard in an open syllable , in the word [cwlefwa] ‘legs’ for instance. A long vowel was perceived in the words [pe:ykuta§] ‘peccary’ and [se:ykutak] ‘peccary’, and a schwa in the expression [m]ntc kilaktw®] ‘let’s go to the forest’.
The different transcriptions of same lexical items in Table 4.6 give evidence that the vowel de la Mata’s symbol e is referring to could be pronounced in several ways. According to my interpretation of the spellings of Martínez Compañón and Tessmann, it could be pronounced as a front [e], [e:], [e], [e:], and probably as a central [b] (MC, T). Mrs. Gutiérrez and Mr. Santos Chapa pronounced the vowel corresponding to the grapheme e as an open-high [w]. This vowel was also realized as a close-mid [e], as an open-mid [e] and as a mid central [c]. The vowel [e] could be pronounced with length as well. Therefore, it is probable that de la Mata’s symbol e was plurivalent and that it could have had the following articulations: [w], [w:], [e], [e:], [c].
In Table 4.6, different transcriptions of the same words given by de la Mata, Martínez Compañón and Tessmann will be shown. They are followed by the transcription of words pronounced by Aurelia Gutiérrez and José Santos Chapa. In Table 4.7 the symbols used by de la Mata, Martínez Compañón and Tessmann and their possible value are represented together with the vowels as pronounced by the Cholón descendants in the Huallaga valley. Since the central vowel derivable from

65

the transcription of Tessmann and recorded in the speech of Aurelia Gutiérrez and José Santos Chapa is a mid central [c], it is plausible that the central vowel which, assumedly, was represented by de la Mata’s symbol e and Martínez Compañón’s e~ was also a mid central [c].

4.2.5.1.1. Positions and use According to the data of de la Mata, the symbol e can occur before the symbols i, a, u and after i, a, o:

~goliyêinco (1465) (g~ol-i-yê-inco) ayteaj! (2195) (ayte-aj) acoleuch (1783) (a-cole-uch) mienan (2076) (mi-e-n-an) aenan (2076) (a-e-n-an) apoectehe (2796) (a-po-ec-te-he)

‘he who had died’ ‘Be quiet!’ ‘my lover’ ‘you gave yourself’ ‘I gave myself’ ‘that I shall give them’

In the sequences composed of a vowel symbol and a consonant symbol within one syllable, the symbol e can occur before and after the consonant symbols named in the Introduction, except before and after those mentioned in the restrictions in section 4.2.1 (cf. the examples in Appendix 4.1).
In addition, the following minimal pairs are found showing that the symbol e has a distinctive use.

67

Table 4.8: Minimal pairs with e

e ø i: e ø a: e ø o: e ø u:

zep ‘meat’ ø zip ‘his house’

atpen ‘I let walk’ ø atpan ‘I walk’

nem ‘day’

ø nom ‘something’

le ‘teeth’ ø lu ‘intestines’, ‘inside’

Regarding the distinctive character of the symbol e, although this symbol appears to be distinctive in the ALC and to be in oppostion to the symbol i, in the following case the opposition between the sounds symbolized by both symbols seems to have been neutralized: the lexical item ento ‘how’, ‘what’, ‘where’, also written as into.

4.2.5.2. Symbol o About the symbol o Pedro de la Mata states that it is “pronounced between o and u”, presumably as something between [o] and [u], for instance, [], a vowel heard in the speech of Mrs. Gutiérrez and Mr. Santos Chapa. However, de la Mata’s o could also have meant another rounded vowel, such as an open-mid back rounded []], or a close-mid centralized rounded [i], a rounded schwa. An open-mid back rounded []] was also pronounced by Aurelia Gutiérrez and José Santos Chapa; a rounded schwa was assumedly represented in the transcriptions of Martínez Compañón and Tessmann.
In the word lists of Martínez Companón (MC) and Tessmann (T) we find the following transcriptions that can be related to the sound(s) symbolized by Pedro de la Mata’s grapheme o:

MC: o, õ T: o, Ç, Ç, ö-

The basic symbol o employed in the transcription of Martínez Compañón possibly had the same value as the corresponding symbol in Spanish. It may have represented a close-mid back rounded [o] if occurring in an open syllable, and an open-mid back rounded []] in a closed syllable (cf. Table 4.9). This would be in accordance with the data collected in the Huallaga valley. José Santos Chapa, for example, also pronounced a close-mid back rounded [o] in an open syllable and an open-mid back rounded []] in a closed syllable.
Concerning Martínez Compañón’s symbol õ, the sound that is transcribed as õ in the lexical item quõt ‘water’ is unlikely to be a nasalized sound, because this same lexical item is transcribed as kö- ta by Tessmann and is pronounced as [k]t] by Mrs. Gutiérrez and Mr. Santos Chapa, without nasalization. However, just as in the case of the lexical item ve~t ‘fire’ (section 4.2.5.1) where the tilde presumably indicates that the front unrounded vowel was centralized, in this case, the tilde could

68
also indicate that the sound was centralized10. As in the case of ve~t where a mid central vowel would function as an intermediary between a front vowel and a back vowel, in this case, a mid central vowel could also very well function as an intermediate between Tessmann’s front vowel symbolized by ö without the superscript breve (see below) and Mrs. Gutiérrez’ and Mr. Santos Chapa’s back vowels [o] and []]. Since Martínez Compañón’s symbol o without a tilde may represent a mid back rounded vowel, and since the tilde may refer to a short centralized variant (cf. e~ with a tilde above which probably represents a short mid central unrounded vowel, a schwa), Martínez Compañón’s õ with the tilde may symbolize a short mid centralized rounded vowel, [i], a rounded counterpart of the schwa. It may also represent a less centralized, fronted back vowel [], the intermediate sound which is possibly symbolized by Mata’s o.
Tessmann’s plain symbol o probably symbolizes a close-back rounded [o]. Tessmann furthermore distinguishes a long mid back vowel [o:] transcribed as Ç, a long open mid back vowel []:] transcribed as Ç, and a vowel transcribed as ö- . The superscript breve indicates that the vowel is briefly pronounced, the underline that the vowel has an open articulation. According to Kemp’s analysis of the transcription used by Lepsius, the symbol ö may represent an open-mid front rounded [œ], Kemp (1981: 73*). (Sievers also describes the symbol ö, in the German word Völker ‘people’ for example, as an open-mid front rounded vowel). Therefore, Tessmann’s symbol ö- is likely to represent a short open-mid front rounded [œ]. Since his front rounded ö without the superscript breve corresponds to Gutiérrez’ and Chapa’s back rounded []] (which is assumedly also symbolized by de la Mata’s o), his ö- with the superscript breve may symbolize an intermediate rounded vowel. The short articulation may thus stand for an intermediate, schwalike (short and neither front nor back) articulation with rounded lips. Tessmann’s briefly pronounced [œ] may then be a close-mid central rounded [i]. It is a short vowel and a rounded counterpart of the schwa (cf. Rietveld & Van Heuven’s remark, 1997: 70, that the difference between a close-mid front vowel and the schwa is just a matter of lip rounding).
As has been noticed, Aurelia Gutiérrez and José Santos Chapa pronounced a close-mid back rounded [o] in an open syllable and an open-mid back rounded []] in a closed syllable. The vowel [] has been recorded in an open stressed syllabe. This may be the intermediate sound to which Pedro de la Mata is referring when he says that o is “pronounced between o and u”. A long close-mid back rounded vowel was pronounced in the word [camyo:h] ‘red monkey’, as in Table 4.9.
10 In Greek the tilde was used to indicate a lingering or falling tone, which was the result of the contraction of two sounds. We may not exclude the possibility that Martínez Compañón also employed the tilde to indicate length + tone, or a transition of two sounds. He may have used the tilde in the lexical items ve~t ‘fire’ and quõt ‘water’ as a linking mark in order to connect the vowel symbols e~ and õ with the preceding symbols v and u, respectively. The symbols v and u may have stand for [u], and the lexical items v~et and quõt may be read as [uwct] and [kuwit], respectively.

Regarding the different notations of the words given by Martínez Compañón, Tessmann, Aurelia Gutiérrez and José Santos Chapa, de la Mata’s symbol o, which assumedly represents an open-high back [], may represent other articulations as well; the more so since the sound represented by this symbol is described as an ‘inbetween’ sound by Pedro de la Mata. His symbol o probably represented the same sounds as those symbolized by Martínez Compañón’s graphemes o and õ, and Tessmann’s o, Ç, Ç, ö- , and as those observed in the speech of Aurelia Gutiérrez and José Santos Chapa. According to my interpretation of his transcription, Martínez Compañón may have observed the following sounds: [o], [o:], []], []:], [i], []. Tessmann noticed the vowels [o], [o:], []], and a short [œ], probably, [i]. An openhigh [], a close-mid [o], a long close-mid [o:] and an open-mid []] were heard in the utterances of Aurelia Gutiérrez and José Santos Chapa. Since Pedro de la Mata does not distinguish length, I suppose his o to symbolize the following vowels: open-high back []/[:], open-mid back []]/ []:], and a mid central rounded [i]. Mata’s symbol o is unlikely to represent a close-mid back [o], because he notes that o is “pronounced” differently. He would not have said so, if his o would symbolize Spanish [o].
Table 4.10 presents a survey of the symbols employed by Martínez Compañón and Tessmann which assumedly correspond to the symbol o in the ALC, and of the corresponding vowels pronounced by Aurelia Gutiérrez and José Santos Chapa.

4.2.5.2.1 Positions and use The symbol o can appear before the symbols i and e, and after i, a, u. E.g.

aoitzan (1006) mipoecqui (1454) mioitzan (1007) cupul(l)uongo (1074)

(a-o-itz-an)

‘I am made’

(mi-po-ecqu-i) ‘give them’

(mi-o-itz-an)

‘you are made’

(cu-pul(l)u-o-ngo) ‘abominable’

The following table furthermore shows that the symbol o is employed distinctively.

Table 4.11: Minimal pairs with o

o ø i: o ø e: o ø a: o ø u:

co- ‘here’ ø moc ‘oh, if’ ø pon ‘group’ ø -cho ‘already’ ø

qui- ‘we’ mec ‘all’ pan ‘mother’ -chu ‘negative’, ‘diminutive’

Notwithstanding the fact that de la Mata’s material give evidence that the symbol o is distinctive from the symbol u, it seems that in one case the distinction is neutralized and that a fluctuation of o and u is possible. This is the case of the agentive marker -uch, which is also written as -och.

4.2.6. Evaluation: tables and diagrams Table 4.12 shows the positions which the vowel symbols can take with respect to each other, when they occur in a cluster. Table 4.13 presents the positions of a vowel symbol occurring within a syllable in a sequence with consonant symbols. Furthermore, a survey is given showing the tentative values of the vowel symbols employed by de la Mata (Table 4.14). The distinctive vowels presumed is presented in table 4.15.

In Table 4.12 the sequences of two similar vowel symbols, sequences like ii, ee, aa, oo, uu, have been omitted. These are treated in section 4.2.7. In Table 4.13 the positions of the vowel symbols are represented before and after a consonant symbol in the same syllable. The positions of the vowel symbols before (b) an adjacent consonant symbol are given first; the second row indicates their occurrence after (a) a consonant symbol. In the diagram, the notational variants - but for k/qu - are treated separately in order to show that their distribution does not always coincide. The symbol n^, the notational variant of ñ, has been left out, as well the symbols g and ñ that do not represent a ‘guttural’ sound. This sound is represented by the complex symbol ng~(u). The symbol g stands for both ‘g non-guttural’ and ‘g equal to h/j’ (cf. Table 4.2.1). Examples of the positions that vowel symbols can take with regard to consonant symbols within a syllable are found in Appendix 4.1.

Since length is not systematically indicated, de la Mata’s vowel symbols may have represented long vowels. According to Pedro de la Mata, the duration of the vowels is not relevant. However, there are indications that he may have noticed length (see section 4.2.7).

4.2.7. Sequences of similar vowel symbols With respect to the length of the syllables, Pedro de la Mata observes that “en esta lengua no ay dimension de sylabas breves ô largas”11 (ALC, fol. 247). Nonetheless, sequences of same vowel symbols are found in the ALC. These sequences may have represented long vowels, because the doubling of a vowel symbol could be a method to designate length.
However, other readings are also possible. If the vowel symbols are divided by a morpheme boundary, they may have symbolized a sequence of separately pronounced vowels, a vowel sequence with an intervening glide [y] or [w], or a vowel sequence interrupted by a glottal closure [?]. The sequences ii and uu may furthermore have represented the falling diphthongs [iy] and [uw], respectively, with a palatal central approximant [y] or a bilabial central approximant [w]. Occasionally, the ii sequence may also have represented a consonant-vowel combination [yi]. Schematically: 1: a long vowel: [V:]; 2a: a bi-syllabic structure: [VV]; 2b: a bi-syllabic structure with an intervening glide [VyV] or [VwV]; 2c: a bi-syllabic structure with an intermediate glottal stop: [V?V]; 3: a falling diphthong: [Vy/w];

12 ‘in this language there is no mesure is short syllables or long syllables’

73

4: a consonant-vowel sequence: [y/wV] (given the overall structure of the language we prefer not to use the term ‘rising diphthong’).

4.2.7.1. aa sequences Sequences of aa have been found in the following cases: I the first person singular forms of the verbs am(o) ‘(to) put into one’s mouth’,
‘(to) eat’ and an ‘(to) come’; II the forms in an of the verb (o) ‘(to) do’, ‘(to) make’, ‘(to) tell’ preceded by an
object marker a ‘1s’ or another prefix ending in a; III maall ‘nothing more’ which consists of the intensifier ma ‘very’ + the suffix
-all ‘only’, ‘nothing else’; IV -ochaauam ‘the (variety of) fruit?’ (ochaau ‘(variety of) fruit’ + -am ‘question
marker’); V - alluaanco ‘I who go’; analiuaam ‘How many species?’; maacsaquianco ‘he
who rejoices’. In the first three cases the aa sequence is divided by a morpheme boundary. Furthermore, the circumflex accent in the verbal form âamoctan ‘I shall eat’ seems to indicate that the circumflexed vowel was pronounced separately. Therefore, there is reason to believe that, in these cases, the aa sequences symbolize either a ‘vowelglottal stop-vowel’ [a?a] sequence, or a ‘vowel-vowel’ [aa] sequence. Examples of cases I - III are

I (1) II (3)

â-amo-ct-an (1512) 1sS-eat-F-IA ‘I shall eat’
ng~-a-ø-an (2948) 3sA-1sO-make-IA ‘he makes me’

(2) a-an-an (2333) 1sS-come-IA ‘I come’
(4) a-m-a-ø-an (2728) 1sS-2sO-APL-do/say-IA ‘I do something for you’, ‘I tell you’

III (5)

ma-all (2672) INT-RST ‘nothing more’

In the form ochaauam (case 4), which occurs only once in the Arte, the aa sequence is not divided by a morpheme boundary and may therefore symbolize a long vowel. However, the possibility to interpret it as a [VV] or a [V?V] combination can not be excluded. It could also be a mistake: cf. analiuaam/analiuuam below.

IV (6)

ochaau-am (1410) variety of fruit-QM ‘[as for] the (variety of) fruit?’

74

In the three remaining items (case 5), aa possibly represents a long vowel, because both segments belong to a same morpheme, and because the elements aanco, (u)aa and maac are normally spelled with one a: cf. actanco ‘I who am’; annaliuuam ‘How many colours?’; macsaictan ‘he rejoices’. The doubling of a could therefore indicate length. However, it could also be a mistake, since there is no other evidence for long [a:] in the ALC.

V (7)

a-llu-aan-co (1189) 1sS-go-IA-DEM ‘I who go’

(8) ana-liu-aam (1424) how.many-CL:multiform/coloured-QM ‘How many species?’

(9) ø-maacsa-qui-an-co (1634) 3sS-happiness-be/become-IA-DE ‘he who rejoices’

And thus, if the aa sequence is divided by a morpheme boundary, it may symbolize an [aa] or [a?a] sequence; in other circumstances, it may represent a long
vowel [a:].

4.2.7.2. ee sequences A sequence of two e is found in the words:

(10) che-e-n-an (2076) 3pS-give-RFL-IA ‘they give themselves’

(11) me-etzo-lam (1503) 2sS-steal-FN1 ‘your stealing’

(12) me-etzo-u-ynco (2007) 2sS-steal-PST-DEM ‘you who stole’

(13) eey, heey (2863) yes ‘yes’

(14) ñeetz (2990) 3sPOS-mother ‘someone’s mother’

The ee sequence is unlikely to represent a long vowel in the first three forms. In these words the combination is divided by a morpheme boundary, and what is more, the prefixes che- ‘they’ and me- ‘you’ are person markers that have assimilated with the vowel e of the stems -e- ‘give’ and -etz- ‘steal’. Their neutral form is chi- and mi- respectively. The underlying structure of the ee sequence is thus an i-e sequence, presenting two different vowels. Intersected by a morpheme boundary, and fundamentally consisting of two non-similar vowels, the ee sequence in the forms cheenan, meetzolam and meetzouynco may be interpreted as an uninterrupted [ww] vowel sequence, as a sequence with an intervening glide: [wyw], or as a sequence interrupted by a glottal stop: [w?w].

75

As far as the words eey/heey and ñeetz are concerned, they are alternatively spelled with one e, as jey (3595) and ng~uech (4), respectively. By doubling the
vowel, the author of the ALC, or its transcriber, may indeed have intended to
express length. A pronunciation as eey ‘yes’ (long mid front vowel + palatal glide)
was observed in the spoken data gathered in the Huallaga valley. Mr. José Santos Chapa and Mrs. Aurelia Gutiérrez, namely, pronounced the word [sg:ykuta?] ~ [sg:ykutak] ‘peccary’ with a long mid front vowel followed by the palatal glide [y].
The ee cluster may thus symbolize the sequences [ww], [wyw], [w?w], if it is divided by a morpheme boundary, and a long vowel [w:], [g:], or [e:], if the segments belong to one morpheme.

4.2.7.3. ii sequences The combination ii may be interpreted as [i:], [iy], [yi], [ii], [iyi] or [i?i]. It has been found in I - the verb piip(o) ‘(to) work’; II - several forms of the verb yip(o) ‘(to) make a house’; III - the word quiimejjuch ‘our teacher’; IV - the forms a(c)quii or a(c)quiî, atonliiye, atzachiitan and cotiinco, verbal forms, which - according to Pedro de la Mata - represent a preterite, a pluperfect (preterite + a pluperfect ending), a future and a past participle, respectively.

I (15) chi-piip-an (66) (also written chi-piyp-an) 3pS-work-IA ‘they work’

(16) meip-an (2867) 3sS.work-IA ‘he works’

(17) piip-o (1183, 1575, 2874) work-FN2 ‘supine’

(18) piip-pacna (1575) work-NE.NOM ‘negation’

(19) piip-te-ge (2783) work-INF-BEN ‘gerund’

The orthography of chi-piyp-an could favour the phonetic interpretation of ii as a falling diphthong [iy]. However, this would give the stem a CVCC shape which would coincide with a syllable in a form such as piip-te-ge: *[piyp$tw$hw/xw]. In Cholón a cluster of two consonants in a same syllable was not normally allowed, so that the reading of ii as a falling diphthong is unlikely. (Clusters of two consonant symbols in one syllable have only been encountered in one lexical item and in three verb forms, cf. section 4.3). This restriction is also in conflict with the phonetic interpretation of ii as a CV sequence [yi], because, in that case, the CCVC stem would also coincide with a syllable containing a combination of two consonants not separated by a syllable boundary. The form meip-an gives evidence that the ii sequence of the other forms of the verb does not represent one long vowel, but two

76

distinct vowels that can dissimilate. If we pass over the possibility to interpret the ii
combination - in the verb piip(o) - as a long vowel, a falling diphthong or a CV
combination, what remains is the reading of ii as a ‘vowel-vowel’, a ‘vowel-glidevowel’ or a ‘vowel-glottal stop-vowel’ sequence, as [ii], [iyi] or [i?i], respectively. Accordingly, the ei sequence in meipan ‘he works’ may be read as [wi], [wyi] or [w?i]. In the case of piip(o) there is still the possibility of another reading. The ii sequence
may be interpreted as a ‘vowel-glide’ sequence [iy] which, in order to avoid a
cluster of two consonants ([yp]) within a syllable, was followed by a shwa. The form piip(o) may then be read as [piycp(o)].

II (20) mi-ip-ø-an (1886) 2sS-house-VB-IA ‘you make your house’

(21) qui-ip-ø-an (1886) 1pS-house-VB-IA ‘we make our house’

(22) mi-iep-o-u-ja-n (1886)

(23) iip-o-c (1889)

2S-house-VB-PST-IA

house-VB-IMP

‘you (p) make your (p) house’

‘Make a house!’

The ii sequence in the first two words may have been composed of the final i of the person marker mi + the stem vowel i with the suppression of the initial glide of yipan. However, according to the other data in the ALC, consonant suppression does not occur in Cholón. It is rather the stem vowel that is elided (cf. me-kt-an < *mekot-an in section 5.4.2, a section about vowel suppression). Presumably, this is what has occurred in both forms. Obviously, the stem vowel i of the verb yip(o) has been elided, and the second element of the sequence ii should probably be interpreted as a palatal glide, the initial y of yip-an. The sequence could therefore represent a falling diphthong [iy], divided by a morpheme boundary. The sequence could furthermore represent a ‘vowel-palatal glide-vowel’ sequence [iyi] composed of i (the ending of the person marker) + yi (the first two elements of yip-an), giving us [miypaõ]/[miyipaõ] and [kiypaõ]/[kiyipaõ]. The form miiepoujan occurs only once in the ALC. The second grapheme of the ii sequence in this form apparently symbolizes the initial palatal glide of yip-an. The word miiepoujan should therefore be read as [miywp]whaõ] or [miywp]wxaõ]. (The reading of miiepoujan as [miycp]whan] or [miycp]wxan] should not be excluded either). The imperative form iipoc is regularly composed from the morphemes iip ‘house’+ (o) ‘(to) make’ + the imperative ending c, and can be read as [yip]k]. In both forms, miiepoujan as well as iipoc, the ii sequence may thus be interpreted as a CV combination.

III (24) qui-imejj-uch (81) 1pA-teach-AG ‘our teacher’

It has been derived from the verb yam-e(h) ‘(to) teach’, which has an initial glide. In the form quiimejjuch, the stem vowel a has been suppressed (cf. yip-an above). The

77

double ii is presumably a combination of the ending i of the person prefix qui + the initial glide of the verb yam-e(h). Therefore, the second segment of the sequence ii is assumedly a palatal glide, and the sequence could be interpreted as a falling diphthong [iy], of which the elements belong to different morphemes.

IV (25) a(c)quii (1868)/a(c)quiî (247) 1sS-be/became-PST ‘I was’, ‘I became’

(a-(c)qui-i/î)

(26) atonliiye (676) 1sS-sit.down/stay-PST-ANT ‘I had sat down’, ‘I had stayed’

(a-tonli-iy-e)

(27) cotiinco (1458) 3sS-be-PST-DEM ‘he who was’

(ø-cot-i-inco)

(28) azchiitan (254) 1sA-3sO-SE-F-IA ‘I shall see him/her/it’

(a-zch-ii-t-an)

In the first four forms, the ii sequence is divided by a morpheme boundary, and the second element of the ii cluster represents the ‘preterite’ ending. Since the ‘preterite’ending i may be interpreted as a glide [y], when occurring after a vowel symbol, and as a falling diphthong [iy], when occurring after a consonant symbol (see section 4.2.3), the cluster ii may represent a diphthong [iy] in the words a(c)quii and atonliiye, and a ‘diphthong-vowel’ sequence [iyi] in the cotiinco. If this is correct, the words a(c)quii, atonliiye and cotiinco may be read as [akiy], [at]õliyyw] and [kotiyinko], respectively. By contrast, the circumflex accent on the final i in the form a(c)quiî may have indicated a glottal stop. If so, the iî cluster may have represented a ‘vowel-glottal stop-diphthong’ sequence, so that a(c)quiî may be read as [aki?iy]. The word azchiitan is a first person singular future form of the verb yach(o)/yatz(o)/yax(o) ‘(to) see’. The future is formed by means of the suffix -(k)t(e): -kt(e) after a vowel symbol and -t(e) after a consonant symbol. Since -t(e) appears after a consonant symbol, the last symbol of the ii-sequence must represent a consonant, viz. a palatal glide, and the sequence as a whole may be interpreted as a falling diphthong [iy].
Regarding the analysis of the cases in which the ii sequence appears, I assume that the cluster, occurring in a stem, could symbolize a sequence of two high vowels with or without an intermediate glide or glottal stop: [ii], [iyi] or [i?i], rather than a long vowel. As a boundary cluster, produced by the prefixation of a person marker, it may also represent a falling diphthong [iy]. In initial position, not intersected by a morpheme boundary, the ii cluster can be interpreted as a CV sequence [yi]. When occurring after a verb stem, whether or not intersected by a morpheme boundary, it

78
assumedly represents a falling diphthong. In a form, such as, cotiinco the cluster ii possibly symbolizes a VCV sequence [iyi]. When the second element of the cluster is accentuated by a circumflex, it may even represent a VCVC sequence [i?iy].

4.2.7.4. oo sequences The sequence oo has been encountered in verbal forms composed of the stem o ‘(to) do’, ‘(to) make’ preceded by the person marker mo- or po- ‘them’ (see chapter 5 and 7):

(29) i-mo-o-ng~o (1515) 3sA-3pO-make-FN2 ‘he has to make them’

qui-po-o-ng~o (2495) 1pA-3pO-make-FN2 ‘we have to make them’

In these forms the sequence is divided by a morpheme boundary, and the sequence
oo probably does not symbolize a long vowel, but has to be interpreted as a vowelvowel sequence [], as a vowel-glide-vowel sequence [w], or as a vowel-glottal stop-vowel sequence [?].
The oo combination may represent a long vowel in the following paradigm,
where it is not intersected by a morpheme boundary:

(30) mi-tzooz (143) (replacement of michooh) 2sPOS-guinea.pig ‘your guinea pig’

(31) qui- zooz (143) (replacement of quichooh) 1pPOS-guinea.pig ‘our guinea pig’

(32) y-tzooz (143) (replacement of ychooh) 3pPOS-guinea.pig ‘their guinea pig’

In favour of the assumption that double oo could represent a long vowel, there is first the fact that [o:] has been attested in the utterances of José Santos Chapa. He pronounced the word for ‘red monkey’ as […amyo:h], with a long vowel. In this word, the articulation of a long vowel has assumedly been favoured by the following glottal fricative. Such pronunciation could possibly have been symbolized by the sequence ooh in the forms michooh, quichooh and ychooh. A second argument would be the fact that the other elements of the paradigm are spelled with one o (oo may thus have symbolized o + length):

79

(33) yotz (143) (absolute form) guinea.pig ‘guinea pig’

(34) a-tzotz (143) 1sPOS-guinea.pig ‘my guinea pig’

(35) zotz (143) 3sPOS.guinea pig ‘his guinea pig’

(36) mi-zotz-ja (143) 2POS-guinea.pig-PL ‘your (p) guinea pig’

In the paradigm mi-tzooz, qui-zooz, y-tzooz, double o may stand for [:] ~ [o:].
When intersected by a morpheme boundary, the sequence oo may stand for the sequences [], [w] and [?].

4.2.7.5. uu sequences A combination of two u not intersected by a morpheme boundary has only been encountered in two interjections:

(37) uchuu! (2935) (38) uñuu! (2945)

‘How warm!’ ‘How praiseworthy!’

In these exclamations, the uu combination may have symbolized a long vowel or a falling diphthong [uw] (cf. section 4.2.3). The interjection uchuu is elsewhere namely written as uchu, with a single final u; and uñuu had originally also been written with a single final u as uñu. The later hand has added the symbol u to uñu. The added final u may have indicated a bilabial approximant [w]. The later hand may also have amplified the exclamation with an additional symbol u in order to indicate that the vowel was long or stressed. (A long back vowel [u:] was heard in the word [u:t] ‘fire’ as pronounced by Mr. Santos Chapa). However, the doubling of the last symbol in order to indicate that the vowel is stressed does not seem plausible, because in Cholón the last syllable was normally stressed, or, as Pedro de la Mata observes, “[...] no tiene mas [acentos] que uno en la ultima siylaba, assi en nombres como en verbos”12. Therefore, a final syllable does not need to be marked as such. The interjection acu! ‘exclamation of affection’, for example, also ends in a stressed high back vowel and is written with a single u, which is not doubled. The double uu in the expressions uchuu! and uñuu! may thus be read as a diphthong [uw] or as a long high back vowel [u:].

13 “[...] there is only one accent, on the last syllable, in nouns as well as in verbs”.

80

4.2.7.6. Conclusion A sequence of two similar vowels may indicate that the vowel is long ([V:]). This can be the case when the sequence is not divided by a morpheme boundary. In the spoken data, explicitly long vowels have been noticed too. It concerns the vowels [g:], [o:] and [u:]. If the vowels of the sequences belong to different morphemes, they may have been pronounced separately as two successive vowels: [VV], as two vowels with an intermediate glide: [Vy/wV], or as a sequence interrupted by a glottal stop: [V?V].
An ii sequence is unlikely to represent a long vowel, even when not intersected by a morpheme boundary. It may, however, have represented a rising diphthong [yi] and a falling diphthong [iy]. In ‘preterite’ forms, the ii cluster, divided by a morpheme boundary, may also represent a [VyV] sequence (cf. cotiinco [kotiyinko]), and a [V?Vy] sequence when the final element of the cluster is circumflexed. The uu combination, which only appears in two lexical items in which it is not intersected by a morpheme boundary, could symbolize a long vowel or a falling diphthong [Vw].
In table 4.16, the possible readings of the sequences examined above are put together. The possible reading of a iî cluster, with a circumflexed final i, is not listed in this table. Sequences that are divided by a morpheme boundary are separated by a hyphen.

4.2.8. Diphthongs In the data of Pedro de la Mata, sequences composed of a vowel followed by i, y or u are frequently attested. In some of these combinations, the elements i, y and u may be considered as glides, and the sequences can be interpreted as falling diphthongs. In this way, the following falling diphthongs can be assumed. (In the phonetic representation of the diphthongs, the symbol e occurring in a closed syllable and the symbols o before the palatal glide y are valued as [g] and []], respectively, in accordance with the diphthongs as pronounced by Aurelia Gutiérrez and José Santos Chapa).

(39) [iw] liu (1896) (40) [iy] aquii (1868) (41) [ew] leu (1907) (42) [ey] pey (1399) (43) [ay] ayte! (2194) (44) [ow] oulum (1637) (45) []y] aloy (963) (46) [uy] atzui (976)

‘painting’ ‘I became’, ‘I was’ ‘worm’ ‘earth’ ‘Quiet!’ ‘snake’ ‘I wet’ ‘I anointed’

The sequence au appears in borrowings from Quechua only, and may well have been

(47) [aw]: allau! (2938) ‘How painful!’ auca (2821) ‘enemy’

If we leave out the diphthong [aw] - which occurs in Quechua loan words -, and the double uu - which occurs only twice in an interjection and which may designate a long vowel as well -, it appears that among the vocalic elements of the diphthongs, only [i], [g] and []] are followed by both a bilabial and a palatal glide. This is illustrated by the diagram below.

There is evidence in the ALC, that some of the diphthongs observed occur in minimal pairs (see Table 4.18).

82

Table 4.18: Minimal pairs with falling diphthongs

liu ‘painting’ : leu ‘worm’ liu ‘painting’ : lou ‘something made’ ney ‘firewood’ : nai ‘someone’s backside’ ay ‘backside’ : oy! ‘exclamation of concession’

It comes as no surprise that no minimal pairs have been found with the ‘borrowed’ diphthong [aw], nor with the sequences ii and uu. The table below shows the falling diphthongs which, according to data in the Arte, are relevant.

Table 4.19: Tentative falling diphthongs

[iw] [ew], [ey] []w], []y] [ay]

In addition, in the words recorded in the area, the following diphthongs were attested: [ey], [ay], []y], [iw], [ew]/[ew], [ow]:

(48) [se:ykuta?]/[se:ykutak] (49) [ay] (50) []y] (51) [kitiw] (52) [alkusew]/[alkusew] (53) [how]

‘peccary’ ‘exclamation to frighten someone’ ‘exclamation to confirm something’ ‘ear’ ‘a variety of fish’ ‘tigre’

The grammar contains many combinations of a vowel symbol + a consonant symbol in which the first symbol can be interpreted as a central approximant [y] or [w]. Although such [yV] and [wV] successions can be interpreted as rising diphthongs, it is more convenient, given the overall structure of the language, to interpret these sequences not as a rising diphthong - an on-glide + vowel cluster -, but just as a succession of a consonant and a vowel.
In syllable-initial position before a vowel symbol, u is often a substitute for the grapheme v:

(54) llavi (2467) ~ llaui (79) ‘he went’ (55) illven (905) ~ alluen (905) ‘I went’ ~ ‘they went’ (56) -va (1853) ~ -ua (1630) ‘topic marker’ (57) -voch (2373) ~ -uoch (1042) ‘verbalizer -vo/-uo + factivizer -(e)ch’ (58) -vuch (1445) ~ -uuch (1444) ‘agentive’

Being alternatively employed in this position, the graphemes v and u apparently refer to the same sound. The sound they are referring to can not be a voiced bilabial

83

fricative, because, according to de la Mata this sound does not occur in Cholón (fol. 1): “No se pronuncia en esta lengua [...] F [...] ni fuerte, ni suave”13. They presumably symbolize a bilabial glide [w].
The grapheme u is also encountered in syllable-final position preceded by a vowel symbol. In this position it has a consonantal status and is possibly employed as a notational variant of v. The consonant symbol v, namely, does never appear syllable-finally after a vowel symbol, only u is found in this position (cf. Appendix 4.1). Since the symbol u has a consonantal status when it appears in this position and since it occurs in complementary distribution with v, it assumedly also represents a bilabial glide [w].

4.3. Consonant symbols

4.3.1. Introduction The symbols employed by the author and the transcriber(s) of the ALC may consist of one basic symbol, or may be composed of more than one element, including the circumflex accent, which is alternatively used as a tilde, and the tilde itself. The consonant symbols which have been used for the transcription of Cholón and the sections in which they are analyzed are shown in the following survey:

symbols b (in non-borrowed words), hu, u/v c, qu, k ch, tz/z i/y l, ll (non-doubled) m, n, ñ/n^ (non-‘guttural’), and nc p, t s/z, x g (non-‘guttural’), h, j g (‘guttural’), g~(u)/g^(u), ~g, mg~, ng, ng~(u)/ng^(u), ng~n^, ñ/n^ (‘guttural’), ñg(u)/n^g(u), n^g~ doubled symbols: cc, chch, jj/gh/gj/hg/hj/jg/jh, ll, llll, mm, nn, ññ/n^n^, pp, ss/zz, tt, uu/uv, xx, yy symbols restricted to loan words: b, d, f, r

section 4.3.2 4.3.3 4.3.4 4.3.5 4.3.6 4.3.7 4.3.8 4.3.9 4.3.10 4.3.11
4.3.12
4.4

The doubled consonant symbols are mostly found as replacements of single (non-doubled) symbols. The symbols gh, gj, hg, hj, jg, jh are used instead of gg, hh, or jj. To indicate doubled u or v the sequences uu and uv are employed. The

14 ‘In this language, F, whether strong or soft, is not pronounced’.

84

sequence, uv, is never the result of a replacement, because neither one of the two symbols is found as a replacement of another.
Apart from the tilde and the circumflex accent, the author and the transcriber(s) of the ALC also employed an acute accent and a grave accent. The use of the diacritics will be discussed in section 4.5.
In the analysis of the consonant symbols we shall look, among other things, at alternative spellings and at their position with regard to the vowel symbols. Examples of these positions are given in Appendix 4.1. In this analysis, for so far as the mid vowels are concerned, the transcription of Pedro de la Mata will be followed. The mid vowels are represented by [e] and [o], respectively, disregarding the possible variations described in section 4.2.5. A survey of the symbols and their value is given in section 4.6.1 and 4.6.2. In section 4.6.3 non-distinctive sounds are sorted out and a table of hypothetical phonemes is presented. After the discussion, in section 4.7, a modern interpretative spelling will be introduced.

4.3.2. The symbols b, hu, u/v The grapheme b usually occurs in Spanish loan words (cf. section 4.4), where it supposedly stands for a ‘softly pronounced’ voiced bilabial fricative [β] (see de la Mata’s remark below) or a ‘strongly pronounced’ voiced bilabial stop [b] (ibid.). In the transcriptions of originally Cholón words, it only appears in the words g~olebuch ‘lover’, and bem ‘sweet potato’. In these transcriptions b can not stand for [β], nor for [b], because, according to Pedro de la Mata, Cholón has no voiced bilabial fricative nor stop (fol. 1): “No se pronuncian en esta lengua las letras B, [...] ni fuerte, ni suave”14 (cf. section 4.1).
The word g~olebuch is written elsewhere as g~oleuuch and colevuch. In these words the graphemes u and v alternate with b. Below, we shall see that the symbol u/v may be interpreted as a bilabial approximant [w] when it appears before or after a vowel symbol in a syllable. Since in the case of g~olebuch the grapheme b alternates with both u and v before the vowel symbol u, it may be interpreted as a bilabial approximant [w] in this position. The word g~olebuch should therefore be read as [õolewu…], and bem, on the analogy of g~olebuch, as [wem].
In Spanish, the grapheme hu, when appearing syllable-initially before a vowel symbol, has the value of a bilabial glide [w]. In the ALC the symbol hu may also represent the bilabial glide [w] when it occurs in syllable-initially before a vowel symbol. In this position it appears only before the symbol a (N.B., this sequence is not to be confounded with the complementizeng suffix -hu, [hu], cf. section 4.2.2). The combination hua has been found in the following forms:

(59) ol i-l-o-u-hua-m

co-â (96)

who 3sA-3sO-make-PST-TOP-QM this-TOP

‘Whose is this?’

15 ‘In this language, the letters B. [...] are not pronounced, neither strongly, nor softly’.

85

(60) ø-llahu-an (904) 3sS-go-IA ‘he goes’

(61) i-llahu-an (904) 3pS-go-IA ‘they go’

(62) hualiu (1031) strength/ beauty ‘strong/beautiful’

In the word i-lou-hua-m-co-â, the morpheme hua is a topic marker which is alternatively spelled as va or ua. The preterite and pluperfect of llahu-an are llav-i and llau-i-yê, respectively. These spellings show that hu can be replaced by u and v which symbolize a bilabial glide or approximant [w] (see below). Since it is replaceable by u and v, the digraph hu has presumably the same value as u and v, and may thus symbolize a bilabial sound [w] as well. This could also hold for the sequence hu in the lexical item hualiu, which should probably be read as [waliw]. Since hualiu is the only lexical item that begins with the sequence hua [wa], this lexical item is likely to be a loan word. It may have been borrowed from Spanish vale ‘good’ , ‘o.k.’ or from Quechua baliq ‘very’, ‘considerable’ (Willem Adelaar, personal communication).
Concerning the symbol u, in section 4.2.4 we have already noticed that it has a consonantal status, whenever it occurs before or after a vowel symbol in a syllable. In syllable-initial position before a vowel symbol, u is often a substitute for the grapheme v:

(63) llavi (905)

~ llaui (78)

‘he went’

(64) illven (905) ~ alluen (905) ‘they went’ ~ ‘I went’

(65) -va (6)

~ -ua (77)

‘topic marker’

(66) -vo-ch (2097) ~ -uo-ch (1042) ‘verbalizer-factitive’

(67) -vuch (1782) ~ -uuch (1444) ‘agentive’

Being employed alternatively in this position, the graphemes u and v apparently refer to the same sound. The sound they refer to can not be a voiced labiodental [v], because, according to de la Mata this sound does not occur in Cholón (fol. 1): “No se pronuncia en esta lengua [...] F [...] ni fuerte, ni suave”15. They presumably symbolize a bilabial approximant [w]. The symbol u is also encountered in syllablefinal position preceded by a vowel symbol. In this position it constitutes the sole option, because v never appears syllable-finally (cf. Appendix 4.1). Since, in this position, the symbol u has a consonantal status and occurs in complementary distribution with v, it must also have represented a bilabial approximant or glide [w] (see 4.2.8).

16 ‘In this language, F, whether strong or soft , is not pronounced’.

86

The examples above show that both u and v can occur before the vowel symbols i, e, a, o, u; the examples in Appendix 4.1 give evidence that only u appears after these vowel symbols.
The following minimal pair shows that u/v/hu, symbolizing a bilabial glide [w], is distinctive from h:

(68) ll(a)u (2072) ‘(to) go’ : llah (2072) ‘(to) bring’

No other minimal pairs with u/v/hu - showing a semantic contrast between the sound symbolized by these symbols and those symbolized by other graphemes - have been found.

4.3.3. The symbols c, qu, k As in Spanish, the grapheme c is plurivalent. Before the front vowel symbols, it presumably has the value of a sibilant [s]. Elsewhere the symbol c refers to a velar stop [k]. In the transcriptions of Cholón, c does not occur before i, and it occurs only twice before e:

(69) a-m-pic-e-n (1173) 1sA-2sO-ask-PST-IA ‘I asked you’

(70) mi-chace-n-lê (2969) 2sS-joke-IA-QM ‘Are you joking?’

The former verb - p(i)s ‘(to) buy/ ask’, m(i)s ‘(to) buy/ ask something’ - is usually written with s or z, as in amsan ‘I buy it’ (3022) or imzan (3025) ‘he buys’, representing a sibilant (see section 4.3.9). In the form pice-n, the symbol c can be interpreted as a sibilant [s] as well. By analogy with pic-en, the grapheme c before e in the form mi-chace-n-lê can also be interpreted as [s].
The symbol c furthermore appears syllable-initially before a, o, u, as well as syllable-finally. In these positions it may be equivalent to [k]:

(71) c-a- (558) ‘1pO-AP’ (72) co (1292) ‘here’, ‘this’

(73) oc (1268) ‘I’, ‘me’ (74) cu- (109) ‘our’

The symbol c of the first person plural marker c- or cu- is replaced by qu, before the graphemes i and e:

(75) qui-quill (117) 1pPOS-wall ‘our wall’

(76) que-chesmiñ (120) 1pPOS-cedar ‘our cedar’

(77) cu-pul (141) 1pPOS-son ‘our son’

87

The examples show that the symbols c and qu are equivalent and symbolize the velar occlusive [k], because they are used in complementary distribution: qu before the vowel symbols i and e, c elsewhere.
In addition, in ki-tzmehj-o ‘our having to be taught’ and in kennà ‘stars’ the symbol k has been used instead of qu. The prefix ki ‘1p’ in ki-tzmehj-o is normally written as qui with qu instead of k. The item kennà was transcribed as que-nac by Martínez Compañón. The graphemes c, qu and k may thus refer to [k], whereas c is bivalent. When occurring before e, it can also refer to [s].
In syllable-final position, the symbol c could also have represented a glottal stop. The word micothaclamge ‘so that you (p) are’, for instance, may be read as [mikotha?lamhe] (see also section 7.3.2).
For pairs illustrating the distinctive character of [s], symbolized by c/_ e, s or z, see section 4.3.9. With regard to the velar stop [k], symbolized by the graphemes c/qu and k, the following examples show that it is distinct from the velar nasal [õ] symbolized by ng~ (cf. section 4.3.11), as well as from other stops, i.c. the bilabial and the alveolar stop, symbolized by the graphemes p, t, respectively.
(78) cot (114) ‘water’ : ng~ot (114) ‘his water’ (79) -c-a- (558) ‘1pO-AP’ : -p-a- (560) ‘3pO-AP’ (80) co (1292) ‘this (one) : to (1231) ‘(to) do’

4.3.4. The symbol ch The symbol ch is an ambiguous symbol. In most of the lexical items it remains unmodified, e.g. cham ‘chain’ (see section 4.3.4.1), whereas in a number of forms it has been crossed out and replaced by both tz and z: chap ‘his wild pig’ > tzap, zap; or by the symbol z only: ypchok ‘six’ > ypzok; and in some cases it alternates with the symbols s and x: ich- ~ is-/ix- ‘three’ (see section 4.3.4.2).
4.3.4.1. The symbol ch without replacement (henceforth ch-) In a number of roots and morphemes, Pedro de la Mata’s symbol ch has never been found replaced by the symbols tz and z, nor alternating with the symbols s and x. There is no compelling reason to assign to it any other value than that of Spanish ch, representing an unvoiced palatal affricate […].

(81) chi- (13) ‘they’

(82) checho (1249) ‘silver’

(83) -(a)ch (1316) ‘reportative’

The symbol in question may occur before and after the vowel symbols a, e, i, o and
u (see Appendix 4.1). The palatal affricate symbolized by ch is distinctive with regard to the supposed alveo-dental affricate represented by ts (see section below)
and to palatals represented by other symbols:

88

(84) chi- ‘they’ chan ‘(to) attach’

: tsi ‘rain’ : lyan ‘go’ : ñan ‘sleep’ : yan ‘give’

4.3.4.2. The symbol ch with replacement (henceforth ch+) The symbol ch has on many occasions been barred and replaced by both the symbol tz and the symbol z. This replacement mainly occurs in the relational forms which have ch in initial position and which have been derived from an absolute form with initial y (see section 5.5). The replacement ch > tz/z futhermore occurs in borrowings (cf. eitza ‘meat’ < Q aycha) and in some 20 other lexical items (e.g. the word chipiou ‘a (variety of) fruit’, see below). The substitution of z for ch mostly takes place in syllable-initial position and between vowel symbols; tz as a replacement of the symbol ch generally appears between vowel symbols and syllable-finally:

(85) $ch- > $z-: chipiou > zipiou (121) ‘a (variety of) fruit’ (86) -ch- > -z-: michipiou > mizipiou (121) ‘your (variety of) fruit’ (87) -ch- > -tz-: ichipiou > itzipiou (121) ‘their (variety of) fruit’ (88) -ch$ > -tz$:michmen > mitzmen (944) ‘you teach’
In a number of cases, the symbol ch+ is only replaced by z:

(89) chel > zel (1082) ‘numeral classifier for big objects and quadrupeds’, ‘numeral classifier for one human being’
(90) ypchoc > ypzok (1087) ‘six’

However, many forms may also occur with their original ch; in those cases the symbol ch has not been crossed out and replaced by tz/z (or by z), e.g.,

(91) $ch-: chipiou (121) 3sPOS-fruit ‘his fruit’
(93) -ch$: ychmen (944) 3sA-3sO.know-CAU-IA ‘he teaches’

(92) -ch-: mi-chipiou-ha (121) 2POS-fruit-PL ‘your (p) fruit’

(94) an-chel

xê (7)

one-CL:truncal hair

‘one humain hair’

(95) ypchocc-o ypchocc-o (1137) six-DIS six-DIS ‘in sixes’

89

Occasionally, the symbol ch+ alternates with the symbols s and x, which represent the sibilants [s] and [š], respectively (see section 4.3.9):

(96) ich- (94) ~ is-/ ix- (1084/1094) ‘three’

(97) -che (94) ~ -xe (1095)

‘numeral classifier for round objects’

The sound corresponding to ch+ may have been identical to the one corresponding to ch-, because both can be represented by the same symbol. Therefore, if ch- represented an unvoiced palatal affricate […], ch+ may have had that value too. However, the fact that ch+ was regularly barred and replaced by other
symbols also shows that the transcriber was insecure about the representation of the
sound in question, and that it may have differed from the one symbolized by its counterpart ch-. At the same time, the sound represented by ch+ must have borne resemblance with that represented by tz and z, because ch+ is interchangeable with tz
and z. In section 4.3.4.3 we shall see that both tz and z may well refer to an unvoiced alveolar affricate [ts]. This sound only differs from a palatal affricate by its place of
articulation: alveolar versus palatal. It will furthermore appear that the symbol z may
also have represented an unvoiced alveolar [s]. In addition, the ch ~ s alternation in the example ich- ~ is- ‘three’ shows that the sound represented by the symbol ch+
could be replaced with [s]. In either case, the difference between the sounds symbolized by ch+ and by z or s is not only a matter of palatality, but also of the presence of an obstruent element: [ts] > [s].
The fact that palatal […] is interchangeable with alveolar [ts] is in line with the
alveolar/palatal equivalence observed in the liquids and the sibilants. The alveolar lateral [l] may optionally be articulated as a palatal [ly] in syllable-final position (cf.
section 4.3.6), and the alveolar fricative [s] as a palatal fricative [š] (cf. the example
is [is] ~ ix [iš] ‘three’ above and see section 4.3.9). The equivalence between the
palatal and the alveolar articulation of the affricate, the lateral and the fricative in
question may be due to
(i) dialect variation: the consultants of Pedro de la Mata (responsible for the original
symbols) and those of Geronímo Clota (who may have been responsible for the
replacing symbols) could have spoken different dialects;
(ii) idiolectal variation: different speakers with different pronunciations (cf. the
alveolar and palatal articulation of the sibilants in section 4.3.9);
(iii) a sound change in progress, which consisted in depalatalization: + palatal >
- palatal (i.c. alveolar).
The last hypothesis, the possibility of a sound change in progress, may also hold for the sound to which the symbol ch- (see section 4.3.4.1) referred. The different use of the symbols ch- and ch+ makes it likely to assume that ch- and ch+ referred to different sounds. It is conceivable that the sound symbolized by ch- had a retracted articulation and that ch- symbolized a retroflex [^c] which was shifting into a palatal […]; the symbol ch+ possibly represented a palatal affricate […] which was losing its palatal articulation and was changing into an alveolar affricate [ts]. An
analogous development occurred in Ancash Quechua. Quechua originally

90

distinguished retroflex [^c] from palatal […]. The latter changed into affricate [ts], whereby the apical : palatal opposition was removed. Since the place occupied by palatal […] became free, retroflex [^c] could shift into palatal […], replacing the former retroflex : palatal opposition with a palatal : alveolar opposition (Torero, 1964).
With respect to the positions of the symbol ch+ before and after a vowel
symbol, see the positions of the symbol tz in Appendix 4.1. With regard to the sound symbolized by ch+, there appears to have been no distinctive contrast with those
represented by the symbols tz, z and s. The examples above suggest that the symbols ch+, tz, z and s were interchangeable. Assuming that Gerónimo Clota and the later
hand saw the phonemic distinctions in Cholón, the sounds symbolized by these
graphemes, as a consequence, must have been interchangeable as well. Not sur-
prisingly, no semantic oppositions based on the palatal affricate sound symbolized by ch+ and [ts]/[s], respectively [ts] and [s], have been found. On the other hand, it appeared that the symbol ch+ represented a sound which was semantically
distinctive from the palatal glide [y]. Lexical items beginning with a palatal glide
[y], symbolized by i/y (see section 4.3.5), namely, have a relational form which begins with the symbol ch+, tz or z (see section 2.5). The distinction: absolute form : relational form is thus represented by the opposition: i/y : ch/tz/z:

(98) yip ‘house’ : -chip/-tzip/-zip ‘somebody’s house’

4.3.4.3. The symbols tz and z as substitutes for ch As has been stated, the symbol ch has often been replaced by the symbols tz and z in all relevant contexts. For example, in the paradigm of the lexical item zaluch ‘an Ethiopian black person’, ‘a black man’ (Sp ‘negro etíope’ in the ALC) the forms which have originally been written with ch are written with tz and z; and in the paradigm of the lexical item zipiou ‘a variety of fruit and its tree’ the forms are alternatively written with ch, tz and z:

(99) azaluch (119) ‘my black man’

mizaluch (119) ‘your black man’

zaluch (119)

‘his black man’

quitzaluch (119) ‘our black man’

mitzaluchja (119) ‘your black man’

ytzaluch (119) ‘their black man’

azipiou (121) ‘my fruit’ mizipiou (121) ‘your fruit’ chipiou (121) ‘his fruit’ quichipiou (121) ‘our fruit’ michipiouha (121) ‘your fruit’ ytzipiou (121) ‘their fruit’

The sound represented by the digraph tz apparently represents a consonant which consists of two sounds: a first sound represented by the grapheme t, an unvoiced alveolar occlusive [t], a second sound represented by the grapheme z, an unvoiced alveolar fricative [s]. Since both [t] and [s] are unvoiced alveolar consonants, the digraph tz is likely to symbolize an unvoiced alveolar consonant as well, probably an unvoiced alveolar affricate [ts].
The symbol z may have represented different sounds. In the case discussed here the symbol z may have had the same value as the digraph tz, because it was

91
interchangeable with it, namely, [ts]. In section 4.3.9, however, we shall see that z was also used as a notational variant of s, symbolizing [s]. The symbol z may also have represented this sound when it was employed as a substitute for the symbol ch+. This assumption seems plausible, if we consider the fact that the affricate sound represented by the symbol ch+ could be replaced by fricative [s] (cf. the example ich- ~ is- ‘three’ in section 4.3.4.2), and that the former, the affricate sound, was not relevantly distinctive from [s]. As a consequence, since the palatal affricate symbolized by ch+ not only fluctuated with [s], but with [ts] as well, we may assume that [ts] also fluctuated with [s]. The more so since both sounds, [ts] and [s], did not form minimal pairs (see section 4.3.4.2). As a matter of fact, Mr. José Santos Chapa Ponce (see chapter 1), pronounced the word for ‘bat’ in two ways: with affricate [ts] and with fricative [s], as [katsik] and as [kasik], respectively. The [ts] ~ [s] fluctuation gives evidence that fricative [s] can function as an allophone of [ts]. It is therefore possible that the symbol z used in the ALC, by analogy with the affricate ~ sibilant fluctuation observed in the speech of Chapa, also represented a sibilant [s] when it alternated with the symbol tz.
Concerning the use of the symbol z, we should furthermore mention that this symbol can also replace the symbol h, when employed as an alternative for tz. In the words mitzooz, quizooz and ytzooz - replacements of the forms michooh, quichooh and ychooh ‘my, our and their guinea pig’, respectively -, the final z is employed as a substitute for the symbol h. In the 17th century Quechua manuscript of Huarochiri (Adelaar, 1988) the symbol h is often found instead of ch in syllable-final position, e.g., ahca [a…ka] ‘many’, ychah [i…a…] ‘maybe’, pihca [pi…qa] ‘five’. It is therefore possible that -ooh should be read as [o:…]. (The sequence of double o in the endings -ooh and -ooz, appears to indicate length, notwithstanding the fact that de la Mata states that no distinction is made between short and long syllables, i.e. between long and short vowels, cf. section 4.2.1).
As far as the positions of tz/z are concerned, the symbol tz and its equivalent can appear before and after the vowel symbols i, e, a, o, u (see Appendix 4.1). In this appendix the symbol tz also stands for the alternative symbol z). The affricate [ts] symbolized by tz and z, and its possible counterpart, the sibilant [s] symbolized by z, are relevantly distinctive from the palatal glide [y] (cf. section 4.3.4.2). The distinctive character of these sounds with regard to palatal [y] is also illustrated by the following oppositions:
(100) atzuch (144) ‘my alfalfa’ : zuch (144) ‘his alfalfa’ : yuch (144) ‘alfalfa’

92

4.3.5. The symbol i/y In the ALC, the graphemes i and y are notational variants (section 4.2.2). As we have seen, i and y can refer to a consonant, viz. a palatal approximant or glide [y], when in syllable initial position followed by a vowel symbol, and when in syllable final position preceded by a vowel symbol. The symbol i/y can thus appear before and after a vowel symbol, for examples see Appendix 4.1.
The minimal pairs below show that the palatal sound symbolized by the grapheme i/y, can be relevantly distinguished from other palatal sounds symbolized by other graphemes. The last pair shows that the sound represented by the symbol i/y is distinctive from the sound symbolized by the grapheme h, which may represent a glottal fricative [h] (cf. section 4.3.10.2):

(101) yan (211) ‘give’ (102) yach (186) ‘(to)see’

: chan (1744) ‘(to) attach’ : ñan (80) ‘sleep’ : hach (1681) ‘field’

4.3.6. The symbols l, ll In view of Spanish practice, we may assume that the grapheme l refers to an alveolar lateral sound [l] and that ll refers to a palatal lateral sound [ly]. Both graphemes can appear before and after a vowel symbol (cf. Appendix 4.1).
The forms below show that the sound symbolized by l is relevantly distinctive from other alveolars, and from its palatal counterpart ll (if ll occurs in initial position):

(103) (104)

lu (1039) ‘interior’ lan (2671) ‘(to) do/make something’

: llu (133) ‘peacock’ : nan (2165) ‘reflexive verb end-
ing’ : tan (308) ‘future’

When the symbol ll occurs in initial and in final position, it obviously represents a palatal lateral sound. However, when appearing between vowel symbols, it can also symbolize a sequence of two non-palatal liquids. For example, the Cholón word alec ‘ten’ is sometimes written as allec. In this item, the symbol ll does not represent a palatal lateral [ly], but rather a sequence of two same nonpalatal liquids. For the interpretation of doubled consonants occurring between two vowel symbols, see section 4.3.12. Sometimes the two segments of the sequence are divided by a hyphen (often introduced afterwards). This sequence has also been encountered word-finally:

(105) al-lec (1109) ‘ten’ (106) jul-l (1603) ‘pine cone’

93

By separating the two elements, and by presenting them as two distinct symbols, the transcriber apparently intended to avoid the reading of ll as a palatal [ly], and wanted it to be interpreted as the representation of two alveolar liquids.
In the lexical item jul-l, the hyphen has been introduced in a sequence of two same liquids in final position. This could mean that the originally palatal articulation of the lateral ll was changed into an alveolar articulation. This is obviously true for the lexical items el ‘cassava’ and colol ‘almond’, ‘kernel’, of which the last symbol, the grapheme l, represents an alveolar lateral. Like the item jul-l, they had originally been written with a final ll sequence, apparently representing a palatal lateral. A hyphen had been introduced in the sequence, which, at first, produced the forms el-l and colol-l, respectively. Then the final l has been barred, giving evidence that the ll sequence which has been derived from ll should indeed be read as [l] and not as [ly].
However, in the case of jul-l, where the final liquid has not been crossed out, the representation of two liquids separated by a hyphen: l-l, can also mean that both articulations, palatal as well as alveolar, were possible in final position. This would be analogous to the optional alveolar ~ palatal articulation of the affricates [ts] and […] (section 4.3.4.2), and of the fricatives [s] and [š] (section 4.3.10).
The fact that in the lexical items colol and el palatal [ly] was changed into alveolar [l] and that both articulations were possible as far as the word jul-l is concerned, may indicate that a change from palatal into non-palatal was in progress (see section 4.3.3 and 4.3.9).

4.3.7. The symbols m, n, ñ/n^ (non-‘guttural’), and nc The symbols m, n, ñ/n^ and nc refer to nasal sounds: m symbolizes a bilabial nasal, n an alveolar nasal, ñ/n^ a palatal nasal, and nc a velar nasal. (N.B., ñ/n^ may also have represented a velar nasal [õ], see section 4.3.11). Appendix 4.1 illustrates the fact that m, n and ñ/n^ can occur before and after vowel symbols.
The graphemes m, n, ñ/n^ are not only formally different, they also create minimal pairs:

(107) man (2009) ‘sow’ : nan (342) ‘come’ : ñan/n^an (80) ‘sleep’.

They can contrast with other graphemes, symbolizing sounds that assumedly have the same point of articulation:

(108) (109)
(110)

bilabial: m : p: alveolar: n : l:
: t: palatal: ñ/n^ : ch:
: y: : ll:

ma (1226) ‘intensifier’ nan (414) ‘go’ lu (1039) ‘interior’ ñan (80) ‘sleep’
ñu (54) ‘daughter’

: pa (139) ‘father’ : lan (2038) ‘do/make it’ : -tu (17) ‘adessive’ : chan (1744) ‘(to) attach’ : yan (2521) ‘give’ : llu (133) ‘peacock’

94

Despite the fact that the symbols m and n normally refer to sounds that are relevantly distinctive, a number of lexical items present m ~ n fluctuation in wordfinal position. For example, the following lexical items are alternatively written with final m or n:

(111) (112) (113)

pullem (60) ~ pullen (53)

‘corresponding consort’

pum (2440) ~ pun (1973, 1811) ‘dust’, ‘flour’

xum (1449) ~ xun (1107)

‘accumulations’ (classifier)

It seems as if in these cases the opposition between m and n has been neutralized. There are reasons to assume that these symbols, when occurring syllable-finally, do not necessarily refer to a bilabial and an alveolar nasal, respectively, but that they can also refer to another nasal, viz. the velar nasal [õ]. The lexical item nen ‘hand’, for instance, is also spelled as nenc. The symbol combination nc indicates that the sound represented by it had been a nasal (indicated by the symbol n) + a velar (indicated by c [k], see section 4.3.3) point of articulation (see also section 4.3.11). Thus, the sound represented by the symbol n in final position was not an alveolar nasal but rather a velar nasal [õ], the sound for which Pedro de la Mata had no unequivocal symbol and which he designated by the term of ‘guttural’ (cf. section 4.3.11). (Compare the nc sequence in the lexical item oncxa ‘deep well’, which was originally spelled as onsa. Presumably, the symbol n has been replaced by the digraph nc in order to indicate that the sound in question was a velar nasal [õ]). In order to represent this sound in a prevocalic position de la Mata employed, among others, the symbols mg~, g~(u), ng, ng~(u), ñg(u). These symbols are encountered in the words listed below, which have been derived from lexical items that end in m or in n and that are followed by a suffix:

chan (1103) ‘bundled’ (classifier) > chag~ + am (1433) ‘bundled + question

pan (140) ‘mother’ pon (1106) ‘group’ (classifier)

marker’ > pang~ + a (1341) ‘mother + topic marker’ > pong~ + am (1442) ‘troop + question marker’

xum/ xun (1449/1107) ‘accumulations’ (classifier)

> xumg~ + am (1448) ‘heap + question marker’

axung~ + all (2490) ‘together’, ‘one heap only’

chan (1744) ‘(to) attach’

> mipochg~u + i (1744) ‘you attached them’

ton (507) ‘he has/is’

> tog~u + i (513) ‘he had/was’

> tong~u + iye (519) ‘he has had/had been’

> tong~ + in (1181) ‘he is still [at home]’

aton (782) ‘I have’

> atñgu + i (647) ‘I had’

pan (588) ‘negative verb ending’ > llacpang + in (1180) ‘he does not go yet’

> miquipang + in (2836) ‘you are not yet’

The appearance of a symbol representing a ‘guttural’, assumedly a velar nasal [õ], as a substitute for a final m or n indicates that these graphemes in final position may

95
have represented a velar nasal rather than a bilabial or an alveolar nasal, respectively. On the analogy of the lexical item xum/xun ‘heap’, where both m and n are employed to indicate a velar nasal in final position, the m/n-ending in the items pullem/pullen ‘corresponding consort’ and in pum/pun ‘dust’, ‘flour’ may have had the same function. In these four cases, the symbols m and n may thus be equivalent and represent a velar nasal [õ]. On the analogy of the verb forms chan, ton and pan above, where n is used to indicate a velar nasal, we may assume that in verb forms ending in n, this symbol may have represented a velar nasal everywhere. The symbol n allmost certainly also symbolizes a velar nasal, when it occurs before the symbol c/qu representing a velar stop [k]. In the lexical items inco ‘this’ and jonques ‘something old’, for example, the symbol n may have represented a velar nasal [õ]. As could be verified, for most of the cases, n in final position was used to symbolize the velar nasal sound. This may mean that n in final position was either bivalent representing both an alveolar nasal [n] and a velar nasal [õ] - or, more likely, univalent, representing only a velar nasal [õ]. (Even when the symbol n in final position should be bivalent, the sounds [n] and [õ] represented by it obviously were not distinctive in this position. Note that a velar nasal is also the usual word-final allophone of /n/ in Quechua).
The symbol m is also found in final position in many other lexical items (see Appendix 4.1) in which it does not alternate with n and so obviously does not represent velar nasal [õ], but bilabial [m]. In addition, the sound [m] is relevantly distinctive from [õ]. The following minimal pair gives evidence that there is a semantic contrast between both consonants:
(114) nem [nem] (1186) ‘day’ : nen [neõ] (73) ‘hand’
Like the symbols m and n, the grapheme ñ/n^ also has two values. It generally symbolizes a palatal nasal [ny], and occasionally (in the words ñeech ‘his mother’ and ñix ‘something dry’, for example) the velar nasal [õ]; see section 4.3.11.
4.3.8. The symbols p, t I will assume that p refers to a bilabial stop [p], and t to an alveolar stop [t]. It appears that these symbols can occur before and after a vowel symbol; for examples see Appendix 4.1. The minimal pairs below give evidence that the symbols p and t represent distinctive sounds. The minimal pairs furthermore show that p is in opposition with m, and that t is distinctive with regard to other alveolars:

96

(115) (116)
(117) (118) (119)

p : t: pa (139) ‘father’

: ta (1906) ‘stone’

p/t : ch: pan (462)/tan (308)

‘negative/future verb : chan (1744) (to) attach’

form’

: c: pan/tan (see above)

: can (868) ‘causative verb form’

p : m: pa (139 ‘father’

: ma (1226) ‘much’

t : l: ta (1906) ‘stone’

: lan (2038) ‘to do/make some-

thing’

t : n: tan (308) ‘future ending’ : nan (342) ‘(to) go’

4.3.9. The symbols s/z and x The symbol s refers to an unvoiced alveo-dental sibilant [s] in Hispano-American Spanish, and we may venture the conclusion that the symbol s in the transcription of Cholón also referred to that sound. The symbol z is bivalent. In section 4.3.4.3 we have seen that z is often employed as a replacement of the symbol ch; that, in these cases, z is equivalent to tz, and may represent an alveolar affricate [ts]. However, in a number of cases, z func-tions as a notational variant of s. The lexical item m(i)s ‘(to) ask/buy something’ (with s), for example, is alternatively written as m(i)z (with z). In such cases, the symbol z has obviously the same value as s, and, since s assumedly symbolizes an unvoiced sibilant [s] (see above), the symbol z may also represent an unvoiced sibilant [s].
A sibilant sound can be represented by the symbol x as well, in which case fluctuation with s is also possible. For instance, the verb s(i)l ‘(to) say something’ and the person marker sa ‘3s’ have an alternative spelling with x: cf. x(i)l and xa, respectively, which could indicate that the symbol x is equivalent to s. However, this is not likely. The symbol x is often used by a later hand to replace the characters s or ss, and, vice versa, x is often replaced by s or z:

(120) (121) (122) (123) (124) (125) (126)

original sipnall sax onsa imsseposan chexmiñ maxou amxi

replacement > xipnall (1189) > xax (125) > oncxa (2463) > imxeposan (2227) > chesmiñ (120) > masou (2181) > amzi (68)

‘quickly’ ‘armadillo’ ‘deep well’ ‘It (the wind) is blowing at you’. ‘cedar’ ‘he was born’ ‘I bought’

The fact that the replacement of s or ss by x, and of x by s or z took place afterwards, suggests that x was not just an alternative symbol for s/z. The difference in notation may symbolize a difference in articulation. Probably, the grapheme s/z symbolizes an alveolar articulation [s], whereas x symbolizes a palatal sound [š]. In the modern data, for instance, the word for ‘armadillo’ and the exhortation ‘drink!’ were pronounced as [šaš] and as [šixya], respectively, with a palatal fricative; and they

97

were spelled as xax and as xih in the ALC. In these forms, analogous to the spoken data, the symbol x possibly represents a palatal fricative [š].
The replacements may refer to a dialectal difference between the consultants of Pedro de la Mata and those of Gerónimo Clota or his reviser. More likely, however, the many replacements back and forth - s, ss > x and x > s, z - show the hesitation of the transcriber about the representation of the fricative sound. This hesitation could be the result of variation between speakers, between an alveolar and a palatal pronunciation. It is therefore possible, that in Cholón both pronunciations were acceptable. This is probably why the forms s(i)l and sa could also be spelled with x.
In a number of cases the symbol x never alternates with s, ss or z. The word muxac ‘sun’, for instance, never appear as *musac/mussac/muzac. We may assume that in these cases the symbol x also refers to an unvoiced palatal sibilant [š].
The examples in Appendix 4.1 show that the graphemes s/z and x can appear before and after a vowel symbol. In the Arte, no items have been found of which minimal pairs could be made showing that the symbols s, z and x are distinctively used with regard to each other. This is not surprising, given the fact that s and z are interchangeable, and that the symbol x has often been replaced by both. The following examples give evidence that the alveolar and palatal fricative sounds [s] and [š], represented by s/z and x, respectively, are relevantly distinctive from other alveolar and palatal sounds:

(127)

sa/xa ‘3s’

: pa (139) ‘father’ : ta (1906) ‘stone’ : c-a (558) ‘1p appicative’ : -la (696) ‘3p’ : -na (2838) ‘negation’ : ñan (80) ‘sleep’ : yan (2521) ‘give’

4.3.10. The symbols g (non-‘guttural’), h and j The consonant symbols g (non-‘guttural’), h and j are problematic, because de la Mata’s commentaries about these symbols (see section 4.1) are not straightforward. According to Pedro de la Mata, the symbols g and h, each refer to two different sounds, but he does not specify what sounds. In addition, the graphemes g, h and j now and then appear to be equivalent and to refer to a “soft” (“suave”) sound that can be represented by the symbol j, but the explanation of what is meant by a “soft” j is missing. Furthermore, the symbol j can also represent a “foreign” (“como los estrangeros”) sound of unknown character. Because of these incertainties, the exact value of these symbols can not be recovered. The use of the symbols g, h and j, when they alternate, appears to be positionally determined.

98

4.3.10.1. The symbol g (non-‘guttural’) According to Pedro de la Mata, the grapheme G (capital) in syllable-initial position represents two different sounds that can be symbolized by the graphemes g (lower case) and C (capital), respectively. In his explanations, de la Mata normally employs a capital to indicate a sound. In the observation above, however, de la Mata uses lower case. He makes a distinction, first, between lower case g and capital G, and, second, between lower case g and capital C. In the first case, lower case g apparently refers to one particular sound only, whereas the capital stands for a plurivalent symbol. Later on, in his explanation about the sound represented by g, he employs the capital again, nullifying the distinction between the univalent lower case and the plurivalent capital. In the second case, by opposing lower case g to capital C, he maybe wanted to put into strong relief that the sounds represented by both graphemes are fundamentally different, and that the sound symbolized by C is not just a variant of g.
About the non-‘guttural’ sound symbolized by g Pedro de la Mata states that g before e and i is “pronounced” as a soft j; that j is “pronounced” as foreigners would do it; and that h sometimes is equivalent to j. This means that his symbol g has the same value as j, when it occurs before the symbols e and i; that the sound represented is soft and may resemble a foreign sound/foreignly pronounced; and that this sound can also be symbolized by the grapheme h (cf. the equation #g/_e,i = j = soft = foreign = sometimes h in section 4.1.1.4).
In the transcription of Cholón, g (non-‘guttural’) normally appears syllableinitially. It may also appear syllable-finally after the vowel symbols a and e: agllem ‘my friend’, choyeg! ‘Let him cry!’. In syllable-initial position, it generally occurs before the vowel symbol e and occasionally before i:

(128) -ge (15) (129) allgi (2652)

‘dative case’ ‘something sweet’

The equivalence of symbol g before e and i with the symbols h and j is shown by the fact that the forms -ge ‘benefactive’ and allgi ‘something sweet’ are alternatively written with h and j, as -he/-je and allhi, respectively. In addition we find -gllem ‘friend’ ~ -hllem and final -g/-h/-j ‘imperative’ (cf. Appendix 4.1).
The symbol g/_ e,i and the alternative symbol j may represent a similar sound as the corresponding symbols in Spanish, because they are used in the same way as in Spanish. In the Spanish text, the symbol g before e and i, and the symbol j are also equivalent, e.g., muger ~ mujer ‘woman’, representing velar fricative [x]. Since Pedro de la Mata says that the sound symbolized by g/_e, i, and by j, is pronounced “softly” and “foreignlike”, they may represent a velar fricative [x] articulated with less friction. However, given the fact that it can also be symbolized by the grapheme h, which in a number of languages represents a glottal fricative [h], the symbols g/_e,i, and j may also have represented a glottal fricative [h]. In addition, (i) the glottal fricative [h] can be described as being a soft sound;

99

(ii) it does not occur in Spanish, but in foreign languages, such as English and German, and can therefore be designated as a foreign sound; (iii) in Quechua /h/ may be pronounced as [h] (and as [x] pronounced with less friction).
With respect to the second sound represented by the symbol g, Pedro de la Mata observes that it is “pronounced as C”. Since the first sound is the sound that is represented by g before the vowel symbols e, i, the second sound should be the sound that is represented by g before the other vowel symbols: a, o, u. In Spanish, g before a, o, u, (and before or after a consonant symbol within a syllable) symbolizes a voiced velar stop [g], and there is little reason to assume that, in the transcription of Cholón, g before a, o, u should not have the same value. Pedro de la Mata probably chose the grapheme c to indicate the sound at issue, because c before a, o, u also symbolizes a velar stop, and because the difference between c/_ a, o, u and g/_ a, o, u is only a matter of voicing. The consonant symbolized by the former is unvoiced, whereas the consonant symbolized by the latter is voiced. A possible reason why de la Mata, in his explanation, employed the grapheme c to designate [g] is that the grapheme c was used in Latin to symbolize both a voiced velar stop and a voiceless velar stop. In this way, the abbreviation C. stands for the Latin name Gaius. As a friar who had studied Latin, Pedro de la Mata may have been familiar with this.
In the transcriptions of Cholón, the symbol g representing [g] has only been encountered in one lexical item: pangala ‘turkey of the forest’. In this item it occurs before the vowel symbol a. It has not been found before o,u, nor before or after a consonant symbol in one syllable, where it may also symbolize a voiced velar stop like in Spanish. The grapheme g symbolizing [g] usually appears in loan words:

(130) (131) (132) (133) (134)

castigan (1631) domingo (1575) alguacil (400) iglesia (2815) gratia (2859)

‘to punish’ ‘sunday’ ‘police officer’ ‘church’ ‘grace’

(The symbol g may furthermore represent a ‘guttural’ sound, the velar nasal [õ], see section 4.3.1 and 4.3.11).

4.3.10.2. The symbol h Pedro de a Mata observes about the symbol h, that it is now and then “pronounced” as j, and that it is sometimes hardly perceived. Unfortunately, de la Mata neglects to mention the conditions under which the symbols h and j refer to a same sound, and under which the grapheme h refers to almost ø.
In the Arte, the symbol h is used as a notational variant of j, and is found before and after the vowel symbols a, e, i, o, u (cf. Appendix 4.1). The following minimal pairs show that the symbol is distinctively used.

100

(135)
(136) (137) (138)

-he (15) ‘benefactive’
hil (2203) ‘word’ llahan (2072) ‘bring’ hachan (1243) ‘make a field’

: -te (16) ‘adessive’, ‘directive’ : -le (279) ‘interrogation marker’ : sil (1127) ‘his word’ : llahuan (1814) ‘go’ : y(a)ch (1521) ‘(to) see’

As a distinctive symbol, h may represent a glottal fricative [h] or a velar fricative [x], sounds that are similar to the ones represented by the g/_e,i and by the symbol j: see section 4.3.10.1.
In exclamations, the symbol h can alternate with ø, if it occurs in syllable final position after the vowel symbol a, and in syllable initial position before e:

(139) (140) (141)

heey, jey, eey (2863-61)

‘yes’

inchamma, inchammah (1352, 2719)

‘What’s the matter?’

-jina, -jinah, -jayya, -jayah (2187, 2463, 2228, 2463) ‘I don’t know!’

In such cases, the symbol h probably represents the second sound symbolized by h, the one described as “apenas se percibe” ‘hardly perceived’. Alternating with ø in syllable initial position, h may thus symbolize a glottal fricative [h] that is ‘hardly perceived’. The term ‘hardly perceived’ can mean that the glottal fricative is weakly articulated and thus sometimes is not written down. If the h ~ ø alternation appears syllable-finally, the sound symbolized by h may also be a weakly articulated glottal fricative [h] which is optionally pronounced, or, rather, a glottal catch [?]. The recordings made in the Huallaga valley show that the glottal catch is not an unfrequent sound, and that it is often pronounced syllable-finally or at the end of a word.

4.3.10.3. The symbol j About the symbol j Pedro de la Mata remarks that it has the same value as the symbol g/_ e,i, and sometimes as the symbol h; and that it represents a soft, foreign, sound. With regard to the use of the symbol j, in the sections 4.3.10.1 and 4.3.10.2 we have seen that j, h, and g/_ e,i are interchangeable. This can also be deduced from the examples in Appendix 4.1. (In a small number of words, such as jañan ‘cherish’, jayya ‘I do not know’ and jill ‘mosquito’, the h ~ j alternation does not occur, but these words occur only once in the ALC).

4.3.11. Pedro de la Mata’s ‘guttural’ According to the ALC, the phenomenon called “guturación” or ‘gutturalization’ consists of a consonant, a ‘guttural’, followed by a vowel. For the representation of this sound the symbols g, ~g, g~, g^, mg~, ng, ng~, ng^, ng~n^, ñ, n^, ñg, n^g, n^g~ are used. The symbols g, g~, ng, ng~ occur most frequently, whereas ~g, ng~n^, n^g~, mg~ appear only once. In his discussion of gutturalization Pedro de la Mata generally uses the symbol ng~(u).

101
The designation ‘guttural’ indicates that this sound was probably pronounced at the back of the oral cavity, as a velar or uvular. In the representations of this ‘guttural’ we also find the indication of nasality: the consonant symbol n and the tilde ~ (or its notational variant the circumflex accent). Because of the combination ‘nasality’ + ‘uvular or velar articulation’, the most likely candidates are: - a prenasalized velar stop [õg], - a uvular nasal [N], - a velar nasal [õ]. The fact that g~ alternates with ñ and n^ suggests that the segment in question was not a stop, but rather a resonant. The option of prenasalized velar stop is, therefore, less plausible.
Grammatically, the forms g/g~/g^/~g/ng/ng~/ng^/ng~n^/ñ/n^/ñg/n^g/n^g~ represent a third person singular agent, object or possessive marker. Such forms are derived from nouns and verbs which begin with an unvoiced velar stop [k] symbolized by c and qu (section 4.3.3):
(142) cot (114) ‘water’ ng~ot (114) ‘his water’
The suppletive third person forms ng~uch ‘his father’ and ng~uetz/ñeetz ‘his mother’ have the symbols ng~ and ñ, symbolizing a same nasal sound, in initial position. They correspond to the formally unrelated, unmarked nouns pa ‘father’ and pan ‘mother’. They may have been derived from nouns corresponding to Híbito cotc ‘father’ and queec ‘mother’, respectively (Martínez Compañón, 1783). Given the connection with the velar stop, I assume that the ‘guttural’ had the same point of articulation and that it may have coincided with velar nasal [õ].
Apparently, the author of the ALC found it difficult to symbolize a velar nasal, because in Spanish [õ] is only a distributional variant of [n]. It occurs in combination with [x], [g] or [k] (e.g., ángel, angustia, banco), but never word-initially or before a vowel as in Cholón. As it is in complementary distribution with [n] and has no independent status or phonemic value of itself, it requires no distinctive symbol in Spanish. When Pedro de la Mata had to symbolize his ‘guttural’ nasal in word initial position or before a vowel, he preferred the sequence ng to nc or nqu in order to indicate that the sound in question was not an unvoiced stop. The use of superscript tilde was meant to underscore the reading of g as [nasal]. His symbol ng~ could therefore be read as ‘nasal homorganic to [g]’.
Concerning its position in a syllable: syllable-initially, the symbol ng~ can appear before the vowel symbols a, e, i, o, u. Syllable-finally, it only appears after the symbol i (see Appendix 4.1). However, after other vowel symbols the velar nasal may have been symbolized by m, n or nc: cf. the lexical items pan ‘mother’, nenc ‘hand’, pon ‘group’, xum ‘accumulation’ in section 4.3.7. Regarding the distinctive nature of the sound symbolized, we have seen that the velar nasal sound [õ] can be semantically distinguished from the velar stop [k]: cf. [õot] ‘his water’ :

102

[kot] ‘water’ above and in section 4.3.3, and from the bilabial nasal [m]: cf. [neõ] ‘hand’ : [nem] ‘day’ (section 4.3.7).

4.3.12. Sequences of same consonant symbols In most cases, double consonant symbols are the result of a textual replacement. Many words containing a double consonant symbol were originally written with a single consonant symbol. This symbol is duplicated by a superscript double:

(143) (144) (145) (146) (147) (148) (149) (150) (151)

apon + p superscript atuj + t superscript achan + ch superscript acotan + c superscript ang~uisiñ + s superscript alec + l superscript ylami + m superscript manap + n superscript coñap + ñ superscript

> appon (1106) ‘one herd/flock/troop’ > attuj (1098) ‘one joint/articulation’ > achchan (1435) ‘one heap or pile’ > accotan (555) ‘I have’ > ang~uissiñ (240) ‘I cheat/decieve/betray’ > allec (1142) ‘ten’ > ylammi (87) ‘he killed someone’ > mannap (1219) ‘from’, ‘between’, ‘more’ > coññap (1384) ‘this size’

This double is unlikely to have been introduced just to facilitate the split of a word into evenly balanced syllables.
Words containing double consonant symbols that are not the result of a superscript double are found as well. In these cases, a sequence of same consonant symbols seems to have an analytic function. It marks a dividing line between different morphemes:

(152) yxxê (1360) ‘three round (things)’ < yx-xê ‘three-roundness’ <*yx-che

However, in the examples above - apon ... coñap -, the superscript double does not mark a morpheme boundary.
In one case Pedro de la Mata seems to make a distinction between single t and double t. In the paradigm of the verb c(o)t ‘(to) be’ the neutral forms are written with single t, whereas the future tense forms in cottan, the imperative micotti, the ‘gerund’ cotto + derived forms are written with double t. These forms are never alternatively spelled with single t, and, with the exception of only one future tense form (cotan > cottan ‘he will be’), the double consonant symbol is never the result of a superscript double. In the forms with cottan, the tt sequences are intersected by a morpheme boundary. These forms, namely, consist of a verb root ending in t: cot + the future tense marker -(k)t(e). In this case, the appearance of double t is obviously due to an analytic spelling. However, this can not be true for the forms micotti and cotto, because in such forms the double consonant symbol is not intersected by a morpheme boundary. The words micotti and cotto are composed of the verb root cot + an imperative ending -i and a ‘gerund’ ending -o, respectively. Analytically spoken, they should have been written with single t. Furthermore, it should be noticed that the form cotte ‘infinitive’ and its derivatives are sometimes

103

written with single t, whereas they should be spelled with double t. The word cotte, namely, consists of a root cot + the ending -(k)te ‘infinitive’. This seems to indicate that in the paradigm of the verb c(o)t ‘(to) be’ the symbols t and tt are interchangeable and that the latter is not distinctive from its single counterpart.
In the following example, the superscript symbol does not form a sequence of two identical consonant symbols:

(153) a-che + t superscript > atche (1095) ‘one round thing’

Word internal gemination seems to underlie the doubling of the consonant symbols, as well as the consonant symbol combinations in words such as atche ‘one round thing’. Partial and complete gemination may occur at the transition from the penultimate to the ultimate syllable, and is possibly connected with prosody and duration. Presumably, the consonant symbolized as a geminate - or, in the case of atche as [t…] -, was pronounced sustainedly, and perceived as a long consonant.
Another example of a superscript symbol which does not form a sequence of two indentical consonant symbols - but which may be a case of assimilation - is found in the following word:

(154)

que-tng~~uti-i-te: t deleted + c superscript >
que-cnguti-i-ø-te (19) 1pS-be.seated-PST-NOM-AD ‘where we were’

The substitution of the symbol c for t is rather strange, because the form is derived from a verb with an initial t: tong~ ‘(to) be seated’. Velar sssimilation with the contiguous consonant is possibly the reason why [t] is replaced by [k] symbolized by c: [tõ] > [kõ].
The status of double l - whether it is the result of a superscript double or not in intervocalic position remains problematic. In word-initial or word-final position, it equals Spanish ll, and probably symbolizes a palatal lateral [ly]. Intervocalically, however, the double consonant can be interpreted either as a geminate [l] or as [ly] (cf. section 4.3.6). As an additional complication, some lexical items, originally spelled with double l, have a superscript geminate. This superscript quadruples the lateral consonant symbol and produces a rather perplexing spelling: e.g. olle ‘saliva’ + superscript ll > olllle. It occurs more than fifty times in the manuscript, and concerns the following lexical items.

104

Table 4.20: The combination of ll + superscript ll

callan c(o)ll illaca (< llaca ‘coloured object’) (a)-llahan (a)-llahuan llaullu (< llu ‘peacock’) mellus olle quimjollo ulluc yammollan

‘order’ ‘(to) love’ ‘their coloured object’ ‘(I) bring’ ‘(I) become’, ‘(I) go’ ‘go’ ‘their peacock’ ‘canoe’ ‘saliva’ ‘we reach’ ‘spear’ ‘(to) leave behind’

The superscript symbol leaves no other interpretation than that of a geminate palatal
for llll. Therefore, I suppose the double l in the cases listed above to be univalent and to stand for [ly], Spanish ll. In other cases, however, the interpretation of double l, is uncertain. It may either refer to palatal lateral [ly], or to a geminate alveolar
lateral.

4.4. The transcription of loan words Pedro de la Mata begins his ALC with the statement that, in the Cholón language, ‘the letters B, D, R, F [...] are not pronounced, neither strongly, nor softly’ (see section 4.1.1.1). Evidently, in his days the Spanish sounds [β]/[b], [d], [r], [f] - the soft and strong sounds represented by the symbols B, D, R, and F, respectively, - did not belong to the Cholón sound system. These consonants usually appear in borrowings from Spanish or Quechua:

(155) (156)

Sp baptismo 9984) domingo (793) fiesta (1575)
Que rasu/lasu (1198/2201)

‘baptism’ ‘sunday’ ‘feast’ ‘hail’, ‘snow’.

The interpretation of the symbols utilized in the loan words presents no difficulties. They must, in general, have had the same value as the corresponding symbols in Spanish or in Quechua.
This means that the symbols b and v are equivalent, both representing a bilabial fricative [β] or a voiced bilabial stop [b], a sound which, according to de la Mata, did not exist in Cholón. Possibly, the Spanish sounds [β] and [b] had been adapted to Cholón and changed into [w], at least in a number of cases. As has been observed in section 4.3.2, the lexical item bem ‘sweet potato’ should be read as [wem], and the Spanish loan word vaca ‘cow’, transcribed as baca in the ALC, was pronounced as [waga] by José Santos Chapa.

105

Regarding the other symbols used in the transcription of borrowings: - the symbol h assumedly is equivalent to ø or to [h]. Originally, in Spanish the glottal fricative [h] was pronounced. As a notational variant of j it has the same value as j and as g/_ e and i, and symbolizes an unvoiced velar fricative [x] or glottal [h]; - the symbol qu corresponds to [k]. In the word quatrotemporas ‘Ember day’, however, the sequence qu corresponds to [kw]; - in the sequence gua in the word alguacil ‘police officer’, u also symbolizes a voiced bilabial approximant [w]; - the symbol x, when used as a notational variant of j, may represent an unvoiced velar fricative [x] (cf. Truxillo > Trujillo). Otherwise it may symbolize an unvoiced palatal sibilant [š]. The lexical item vexa ‘sheep’ may thus have been pronounced as [weša]; compare old Spanish [oβeša] and Tarma Quechua [u:ša] ‘sheep’ (Adelaar, 1977: 489).
In the examples below, the borrowings in Cholón (Ch) are followed by the translation in Spanish (Sp) given by Pedro de la Mata, or by the Quechua word the lexical item is borrowed from. The instances show, amongst other things, that no distinction is made between the symbols b and v, between cu and qu, and between s and z. (The word camayoc ‘holder of a certain position/post’ is a borrowing from Quechua). E.g.:

(157)

Ch

Sp

baca camayoc (1155) baquero

‘cowherd’

vexa camayoc (1154) pastor de obejas ‘shepherd’

quatrotemporas (2793) cuatrotemporas ‘Ember day’

vigilia (2793)

vigilia

‘vigil’

resan qui/ (1738)

rezar

‘(to) pray’

rezan qui (1638) (qui ‘to be’, ‘to become’, ‘to do’)

(158)

Ch

Que

lasumuillan (2201)

rasu ‘snow’

(muillan ‘fall down’, ‘bury’)

rasumuilli (1198)

utza/uza (1204/1222) hu…a

‘(to) hail’
‘It hailed’. ‘fault’, ‘guilt’, ‘sin’

The examples above indicate that foreign words could undergo some changes when they were borrowed, and that sounds that did not belong to the sound system of Cholón were adapted. We have already seen that the Spanish sounds [β] and [b] were changed into [w]. Other phonetic adaptations are depalatalization and lateralization. The word for ‘guilt’ shows that palatal […], represented by the symbol ch, has been depalatalized and changed into [ts]. The borrowing lasumuillan ‘to hail’ shows that the non-native vibrant [r] of Quechua rasu ‘snow’ was replaced by the more familiar lateral [l].

106

For the morphonological changes that may occur when non-native words are adapted to Cholón, see section 5.6. Appendix 5 lists the loan words encountered in the ALC.

4.5. The use of the diacritics

In the ALC diacritics are not infrequent; the following diacritics occur: circumflex

accents, acute accents, grave accents, and tildes. In the Spanish text, the circumflex accent in the digraph n^ indicates that the nasal in question is palatal [ny]. Usually,

the Spanish preposition â ‘to’, as well as the conjunctions ê ‘and’ and ô ‘or’, are

also written with a circumflex accent. In these cases, the circumflex accent

apparently indicates that the preposition a, and the conjunctions e and o are

independent forms which are neither part of the preceding, nor of the following

word, and that they should be pronounced separately. In a small number of cases

these forms are written without an accent. Stress is not indicated in the Spanish text.

In the transcription of Cholón, both the circumflex accent and the tilde are alternatively employed to indicate a palatal nasal [ny] and a velar nasal [õ]. The palatal nasal [ny] can thus be symbolized by n^ , as well as by ñ; the velar nasal [õ] can for instance be symbolized by the digraphs g^ , g~, ng^ , ng~, ñ, n^, n^ g, and ñg.

Although used indifferently, these diacritics tend to have a different distribution.

The circumflex accent more often appears above the symbol n and the tilde above

the symbol g. n^ , rather than

As a by ñ;

consequence, the palatal nasal [ny] the velar nasal [õ] is represented by

itshseysmymbobloizlsed~gbayndthne~gd,irgartahpehr

than by g^ and ng^.

The circumflex accent can furthermore be used as a stress marker, as can the

stroke which now and then occurs above the vowel symbol i. (However, in most

cases, a stroke above the symbol i replaces the dot and has no particular

significance). In his paragraph about the accent, de la Mata mentions that in Cholón

stress is word-final, and he gives the following examples:

(159) (160) (161) (162)

mallâ (2979) llín (2980) llêz (2982) patôx (2981)

‘something raw’ ‘something green’ ‘alfalfa’ ‘remnant’, ‘residue’

In one of the first paragraphs - book I, paragraph 5 -, the word llû ‘his peacock’ is also spelled with a circumflex accent. Apparently, stress is marked by a circumflex accent above the vowel symbols a, e, o and u, and by a stroke or acute accent above the vowel symbol i.
The circumflex accent may also have indicated that the vowel must be pronounced separately (see the remarks above about the use of this diacritic in the transcription of Spanish). In that case the vowel may have been separated from the neighbouring vowel by a glottal stop (cf. âamoctan [a?amoktan] ‘I shall eat’, section 4.2.7.1). (The glottal stop might also have been represented by the symbol c, which

107
otherwise represents the velar stop [k], see section 4.3.3; and by the symbol h, see section 4.3.10.2).
Occasionally, a grave accent may have the function of a stress mark: in the lexical items mallà ‘something raw’ and quexùm ‘nose’, for instance. However, the colour of the ink of this accent differs from that of the other stress marks. As it occurs rarely in the ALC, this was obviously neither de la Mata’s, nor Clota’s habitual way of marking stress, and it may have been added by the later hand (see chapter 2).
4.6. Concluding remarks On the basis of the information compiled in the previous sections it will be possible, first, to give an overview of the consonant symbols employed in the ALC together with their most likely values (section 4.6.1, Table 4.21). Secondly, an inventory of the attested consonants will be presented (section 4.6.2, Table 4.22). Within limitations, it will also be possible to establish which distinctions are relevant and which are not. Some of the distinctions, such as the oppositions between the alveodental and the palatal sibilants, are not contrastive; the oppositions involving sounds borrowed from Spanish and Quechua, viz. the voiced stops [b] and [d] and the vibrant [r], vis-à-vis their unvoiced counterparts [p] and [t] and the lateral [l], respectively, are only contrastive in loan. By sorting out the non-relevant distinctions, a chart of tentative consonant phonemes can be presented (Table 4.23). Thirdly, an unambiguous and more consistent spelling of all the symbols used in the Cholón transcriptions will be proposed (section 4.7, Table 4.24). The orthography of the borrowings will remain unaltered.
4.6.1. The consonant symbols and their most likely values The chart below, Table 4.21, presents a survey of the symbols used by Pedro de la Mata in his transcription of Cholón and in loan words. The plurivalence of some symbols, notably, of those symbolizing friction, becomes clearly evident. The symbols, alphabetically arranged, are accompanied by their most likely phonetic value. The double consonant symbols cc, chch, gh/gj/hg/hj/jg/jh/jj, ll, llll, mm, nn, ññ/n^n^, pp, ss/zz, tt, uv, xx and yy may have the value of geminated consonants: [kk], [……], [hh]/[xx], [ll], [lyly], [mm], [nn], [nyny], [pp], [ss], [tt], [ww], [šš] and [yy], respectively. These symbols and values have been left out in the overview below.

4.6.2. Inventory of consonants A survey of the Cholón consonants is given in the table below. In this chart, the consonants [β/b], [d], [f] and [r], occurring in Spanish and Quechua loan words, are included, as is the hypothetical glottal stop [?] represented by the circumflex accent, cf. section 4.2.7.1, and possibly by the symbol h in final position after a, cf. section 4.3.10 (or by the symbol c, cf. section 4.3.3). The borrowed consonants are in square brackets in order to distinguish them from the Cholón consonants.

4.6.3. Distinctive and non-distinctive differences The sounds [p], [t], [k], [ts], […], [s]/[š], [x]/[h], [m], [n], [ny], [õ], [l], [ly], [w], [y] represent distinctive units. However, a sound represented by a single consonant symbol is not distinctive in relation to the sound represented by its double counterpart. No minimal pairs have been found involving the unvoiced stops [p], [t] and [k] and their voiced pendants [β]/[b], [d], and [g], respectively. Regarding the stops [β]/[b] and [d], this is not surprising, because, as has been noticed, these voiced stops occur in loan words, and do not belong to the original Cholón sound system. The symbol g, representing a voiced velar [g], appears only once in a native lexical item, pangala ‘forest turkey’. This word could also be a borrowing, possibly from a neighbouring language. Like the obstruents [β]/[b] and [d], the consonants [f] and [r] only appear in borrowings; no minimal pairs involving [f] and [r] have been found either.
As regards bilabial [w], symbolized by b/hu/u/v, it appears to have a low functional load. Syllable-finally, it is symbolized by the grapheme u, and represents the bilabial off-glide in a falling diphthong (with respect to minimal pairs involving diphthongs see section 4.2.8). In syllable-initial position [w] is represented by the symbols b/hu/u/v; in this position it is infrequent. It is found in the lexical items bem

110
[wem] ‘sweet potato’, vey ‘firewood’, hualiu [waliw] ‘something beautiful’, ‘strong’, which may be a loan word (see section 4.3.2); in the paradigm of the verb llau [lyaw] ‘(to) go’; and in the following suffixes: -buch [wu…] ‘agentive marker’, also written as -uuch or -vuch ; -va/-ua [wa] ‘topic marker’ -ua; -w(o)/-u(o) [w(o)] ‘verbalizer’. In internal position the bilabial sound [w] symbolized as b/u/v is mainly found between a stem ending in a vowel and a suffix beginning with a vowel (the suffixes mentioned above occur as -uch, -a, -(o), respectively, when used after a consonant-final stem); its function seems to be that of a euphonic element meant to avoid a hiatus bewteen two vowels. The initial [w] of vey ‘firewood’ also appears to fill up a gap before a vowel. In the paradigm in question the absolute form vey corresponds with a possessed or relational form ney ‘someone’s firewood’. An epenthetic n usually appears in the paradigm of a lexical item of which the absolute form begins with a vowel (cf. el ‘cassava’ > anel ‘my cassava’, section 5.5). This means that the absolute form vey has a status somewhat equivalent to forms with initial e. If we compare Martínez Compañón’s transcription of the word for ‘fire’ v~et with Pedro de la Mata’s et ‘fire’, we notice that the bilabial sound [w] represented by the symbol v in Martínez Compañón’s transcription - also alternates with ø. In the case of vey ‘firewood’ and v~et ‘fire’, the occurrence of bilabial [w] thus appears to be non-functional.
The functional load of the affricate […] is high. In section 4.3.4 we have seen that this sound is represented by the symbol ch and that, in fact, two cases must be distinguished: 1 - ch- which is never replaced by another symbol; it is univalent, because it refers
to one sound only, and is relevantly distinctive from other stops and palatals (cf. section 4.3.4.1); 2 - ch+ which is regularly replaced by the symbols tz and z; it is plurivalent, because it also refers to the consonants [ts] and [s] otherwise symbolized by tz and z, respectively; as a result it is not distinctive from [ts] and [s], but it is distinctive from palatal y. (ch+, tz and z mark the relational forms of lexical items of which the absolute form begins with y). The difference in use, value and distinctiveness of ch- and ch+ suggests that they refer to different sounds: […]1 and […]2, respectively. The former may have had a retracted articulation (see section 4.3.4.2), the latter had the alveolar affricate [ts] and the alveolar sibilant [s] as alternatives. In the tentative phoneme chart represented Table 4.23, the former affricate, […]1, is represented by palatal …; the latter affricate, […]2, by the alveolar affricate ts.
The symbol z is also used ambiguously. First, the symbol z is employed as a replacement of the symbol ch+. In this function, a, it alternates with the symbol tz; b, it is not interchangeable with the symbol x representing [š]; c, it not only refers to the affricate [ts], but may also refer to the sibilant [s]; d, it symbolizes a sound which is relevantly distinctive from palatal [y] only (see
section 4.3.4.3); e, it symbolizes a sound which is an allophone of [ts];

111

f, it is represented by the consonant ts in table below. Second, the symbol z is used as a notational variant of the symbol s. Functioning as a variant of s, a, it does not alternate with tz; b, it is interchangeable with the symbol x representing [š]; c, it only symbolizes the sibilant [s]; d, it symbolizes a sound which is relevantly distinctive from other alveolar and
palatal sounds (see section 4.3.9); e, it symbolizes a sound which is an allophone of [š]; f, it is represented by the consonant s in the table below.
As for the palatal fricative [š] mentioned above, we have seen that it is an allophone or a free variant of the alveolar fricative [s], represented by the symbols s and z (see also section 1.3.9). This explains the [s] ~ [š] alternation in the prefix is[is]- ~ ix- [iš]- ‘three’ (see section 4.3.4).
Reconsidering the observations above, the following consonants are proposed as possible phonemes: [p], [t], [k], [ts], […], [s], [x], [m], [n], [ny], [õ], [l], [ly], [w], [y]. The consonants [š] and [h] do not figure in the table below, because they are considered as allophones of [s] and [x], respectively.

4.7. A practical spelling In order to clearly present and analyze the grammatical facts of Cholón, the following symbols are introduced as substitutes for the graphemes used in the ALC. In this spelling, de la Mata’s vowel symbols a, e, i, o, u are maintained. Symbols representing borrowed sounds - b, d, f, r - have not been included in the survey below. The doubled symbols which may represent geminated consonants have also been omitted (cf.section 4.6.1).

5. Morphonology

5.1. Introduction In this chapter we will look at sounds within the framework of the word, as interrelated parts of a morphonological entity. In this entity, vowels can undergo processes such as harmonization and suppression (Alexander-Bakkerus, 2002). The latter is linked to the syllable structure of the words. Consonants can alternate in stem-initial position, and , when the stem begins with a vowel, consonant insertion may take place. There are also two possible cases of consonant dissimilation and one possible case of consonant assimilation.
In section 5.2 attention will be paid to the structure of syllables, and in section 5.3 to consonant clusters. In section 5.4.1 we shall look at vowel harmony, and in section 5.4.2 at vowel suppression. Stem alternation and the insertion of a steminitial consonant will be analyzed in section 5.5. The cases of consonant dissimilation and assimilation are treated in section 5.6. In section 5.7 the morphonological processes that occur in loan words will be discussed. In Appendix 4.2 boundary clusters are listed together with the words in which they occur.
The Cholón examples are normally written in the spelling introduced in section 4.6.2, Table 12. When necessary, forms are written in the orthography employed by Pedro de la Mata and his copyists. Such forms are put in angled brackets: < >. Spanish loan words are written in the orthography in which they are encountered in the Arte.

5.2. Syllable structure Cholón syllables have the following canonical structure: (C)V(C). A syllable may thus consist of a vowel (V), a vowel and a consonant (VC or CV) or a vowel and two consonants (CVC). According to our interpretation of the ALC, these four types of syllables can figure word-initially:

(1) a$lan (2138)

‘I do/make something’

(2) aly$hi (1033)

‘something sweet’

(3) …e$…o (2034)

‘silver’

(4) kuly$ha (2977) ‘life’

Syllables figuring in the middle of a word generally have an initial consonant, although medial syllables of the V type have been observed in the ALC:

(5) a$a$man (2054) ‘I eat’

As for a form such as <atupiajtan> ‘I shall walk again’, it is not sure whether it contains a medial syllable of the VC or the CVC type: it can be read as a$tu$pi$ah$tan, as a$tu$pi$yah$tan, or as a$tup$yah$tan. Final syllables also tend to be consonant-initial, but syllables consisting of a vowel or a VC sequence, such as $e and $in in the words ma$e ‘falsely’ and ma$in ‘not yet’occasionally occur in

114

word-final position. The words <mae> and <main> may, respectively, be interpreted as ma$e and ma$in, as ma$?e and ma$?in, and as ma$ye and ma$yin. However, since the syllables ma, e, in refer to dif-ferent morphemes (‘not’/ ‘negation’, ‘yes’/ ‘true’, ‘yet’, respectively), the latter reading is less plausible. The fact that the syllables refer to different morphemes makes a reasonable case for one of the former readings. Mono-segmental words have not been found in the material collected. Monosyllabic words consist of two or three segments:

(6) oy (2939) (7) pa (139) (8) paõ (140)

‘yes’ ‘father’ ‘mother’

The maximum number of syllables per word found in the ALC appears to be eight: mi$me$nyo$ha$ki$ah$te$ke/mi$me$nyo$ha$ki$yah$te$ke <mimeñohaquiahteque > ‘that you (p) wanted it again’.
In word forms a pattern of regularly alternating consonants and vowels is preferred. This is illustrated by the fact that suffixes may have consonant-initial and vowel-initial allomorphs which are affixed to vowel-final and consonant-final stems, respectively. For instance, the topic marker -a and the verbalizer -(o) have allomorphs with initial w, when they are suffixed to a form ending in a vowel (see also 5.3); and the suffix -ly ‘only’, ‘nothing else but’ has an allomorph -aly after a final consonant. In addition, the suffix -ny ‘as’, ‘like’ has -miny as allomorph, when suffixed to a word ending in a consonant. Not all suffixes exhibit this type of alternation, however.

(9) Luis (78) ‘Luis’ Pedro (79) ‘Pedro’

> Luis-a (79) ‘as for Luis’ > Pedro-wa (78) ‘as for Pedro’

(10) yip (1550) ‘house’ pana (2012) ‘road’

> a-yip-aõ (1550) ‘I make a house’ > a-mna-w-aõ (2013) ‘I make my road’

(11) …e…o (2034) ‘silver’

> …e…o-ly (1173) ‘only silver’

wem (1174) ‘sweet potato’ > wem-aly (1174) ‘only sweet potato’

(12) ko (1292) ‘this’ ets (2328) ‘thief’

> ko-ny (2493) ‘like this’ > ets-miny (2328) ‘like a thief’

5.3. Consonant clusters Clustering of consonants within one syllable hardly ever occurs in Cholón. The avoid-ance of consonant clusters within a syllable is most convincingly illustrated by the way Spanish words were adapted to Cholón. In the following example, the Spanish ‘muta cum liquida’ sequence is broken up by the insertion of a copy vowel (see anaptyxis, section 5.7):

115
(13) Sp plátano ‘banana’ > palantu (1454) ‘banana’
We have only found two examples of a sequence of two consonants in the same syllable: the verb form maksayktaõ <macsaictan > ‘he shall rejoice’ and the verb stem šayš/ šay… <xaix/ xaich> ‘(to) whip’. Elsewhere, the verb ‘to rejoice’ is transcribed as <maacsaquian> maaksakian/maaksakiyan, a form which does not contain the cluster <ic> yk. It is possible that the <ic> sequence in the word <macsaictan> was a slip of the pen and that the transcriber intended to write *<macsactan>. It is also possible that the word <macsaictan> should be interpreted as maksayiktaõ or maksa?iktaõ. The verb stem šayš/ šay… is obviously a case of onomatopoeia. However, the possibility of interpreting this stem as šayiš/ šayi… or ša§iš/ ša§i… can not be excluded.
Consonant clusters mainly appear at syllable boundaries (cf. the cluster tsm <tzm> in the example ets-miny <etzmiñ> ‘like a thief’). Examples of words containing sequences of two consonants divided by a syllable boundary are shown in Appendix 4.2. In the inventory of boundary clusters the doubled consonants which are the result of a replacement (written in superscript) have been left out. Possibly, these consonants were doubled in order to indicate that the consonant concerned was either pronounced sustainedly as a geminate consonant, or was otherwise perceived as long. Since they may have referred to length, these doubled consonants are not considered here as boundary clusters.
The contrast between the obstruents s, š and ts - symbolized in the Arte by <s>/<z>, <x> and <tz>/<z>, respectively - is not distinctive. <s>, <x>, <tz> and <z> do not normally occur together in a boundary cluster: *<stz/ztz>, *<sx>. However, in the ortho-graphy used in the Arte, clusters such as <zx>, <xs>, <xz>, <tzs> and <tzz> have been encountered. In the paradigm of the lexical item yušam <yuxam> ‘armadillo’, the rela-tional forms are spelled as <tuzxam> with a <zx> sequence. Combinations represented by the symbols <xs> and <xz> have been found in the words kilišso kilišso <quilixsô quilixsô> ‘in sevens’ and kilištsel <quilixzel> ‘seven’ (+ the classifier tsel ‘truncal object’). A tss sequence, symbolized by the graphemes <tzs> and <tzz>, has been found in the verbal forms atsitssiyaõ <atzitzsian> ‘I return’and metsitssiyay <metzitzziay> ‘you returned’. These sequences of obstruents - the sequences sš <zx>, šs <xs/xz> and tss <tzs/tzz> - may indicate that the consonants s <s/z>, š <x>, and ts <tz> were pronounced sustainedly, viz. that they were long. This may very well have been the case for the form kilišso, because the endings in -o, described by Pedro de la Mata as gerund or supine endings, are generally preceded by a double consonant, e.g. kotto <cotto> ‘having to be’, aton…ehho <atonchejjo> ‘my having to roam’. It is certainly true for -tsitssiyay <tzitzziay>, which is alternatively spelled as -<chichchiay> with double <ch>. Above we have seen that the doubling of a consonant may have designated length. Thus the clusters <zx>, <xs/xz> and <tzs/tzz> - in view of the likely possibility that they represent a double consonant -have also been excluded from the inventory of boundary clusters in Appendix 4.2.

116
The only clusters of nasal consonants encountered are the clusters mn <mn> and nm <nm> (and double m <m> and n <n>). The nym <ñm> sequence found in the form sinymilowhaõ <siñmilouhan> ‘you (p) wasted’ has not been taken into account, because this form consists of two words: a noun siny ‘waste’ and a verbal form milowhaõ ‘you (p) did’, so that the sounds ny <ñ> and m <m> are separated by a word boundary.
Conversely, the expression mahaly liw <mahall liu> ‘many different things’, written in two words, must be analyzed as one form consisting of a word indicating quantity (mahaly) + a classifier (liw). In the Arte, classifiers are generally suffixed to the quantifier: cf. alliw <alliu>’one different, coloured thing’, mahalypok <mahallpoc> ‘many times’. Therefore, de la Matas separated forms <mahall liu> are to be interpreted as mahalyliw, and the sequence lyl <lll> is interpreted as a boundary cluster.
The positions which the boundary segments can take with regard to each other are represented in Table 5.1. In this outline the occurrence of one of the consonants of the vertical axis before a consonant of the horizontal axis is indicated by a plus sign, the non-occurrence by a minus sign. Note, only attested boundary clusters are represented (also in Appendix 4.2). Non-attested, but possibly viable clusters have been omitted, as a result of which Table 5.1 (and the Appendix) is not necessarily exhaustive. For instance, according to Table 5.1, ly occurs in seven boundary clusters. In these clusters it is preceded by the segments p, s, n, õ, l, y. However, the case marker -lyak-pat ‘because of’can be suffixed to any noun, and, since nouns may end in any segment mentioned in Table 5.1, the boundary clusters tly, kly, tsly, …ly, šly, mly, nyly, lyly, wly may very well have occurred.

5.4. Vowel harmony and suppression in non-borrowed forms Vowel harmony and vowel suppression are frequent phenomena in Cholón. The vowel i of a personal reference prefix can either be assimilated or suppressed. A stem vowel can also be suppressed. A prefix consisting of only one vowel can not be subject to suppres-sion, nor are the third person plural marker …i- and the third person object marker po-/ mo-. (These prefixes are treated in section 6.2 and 7.6).

5.4.1. Vowel harmony Vowel harmony in Cholón is a case of non-contact assimilation or distant assimilation, also known as metaphony (Lass, 1984: 171). This harmony is regressive, so that the vowel of a personal reference prefix harmonizes with the vowel of a nominal or a verbal stem. Harmonization of the vowel i of a nominal prefix with a stem vowel takes place when the stem contains the vowels e or u:

(14) mi-kily (117) 2sPOS-wall ‘your wall’

mi-šaš (125) 2sPOS-armadillo ‘your armadillo’

mi-kot (114) 2sPOS-water ‘your water’

118

(15) me-lyes (130) 2sPOS-yucca ‘your yucca’

(16) mu-pul (141) 2sPOS-son ‘your son’

However, the vowel i does not harmonize with the vowel e of a nominal stem when the stem begins with k, p, m or y. There is only one example of a noun with a kinitial e-stem:

(17) mi-kešum (118) 2sPOS-nose ‘your nose’

Nouns with a p-initial, m-initial or y-initial e-stem are normally derived from a verb:
(18) mi-penyo-wu… (1065) < peny(o) ‘(to) want’ 2sO-want-AG ‘your lover’
(19) mi-meny (1059) < peny(o) ‘(to) want’ 2sPOS-wish ‘your wish’

(20) mi-ye-lam (2965) < y(e) ‘(to) sleep’ 2sS-sleep-FN1 ‘your bed’

The examples show that nouns with a p-initial and m-initial e-stem have been derived from the same verb. This is due to the fact that initial p of a verb stem alternates with m (see section 5.5). The reason for the non-assimilation of the vowel i of the prefix with the stem vowel e of a derived noun may be that the prefix at issue is counted as verbal. The vowel i of a verbal prefix does not normally harmonize with a stem vowel e. It only harmonizes with an u stem:

(21) mi-ših-ia-õ (955) 2sS-drink-RE-IA ‘you drink again’

(22) mi-meny-aõ (807) 2sA-3sO.want-IA ‘you want him/her/it’

(23) mi-ø-lyah-aõ (917) 2sA-3sO-bring-IA ‘you bring something’

(24) mi-ø-lo-õ (962) 2sA-3sO-wet-IA ‘you wet something’

(25) mu-ø-lyup-aõ (1926) 2sA-3sO-eat-IA ‘you eat something’

119

In one example, in the form ku-layam ‘we doubt’, ku instead of ki is found before a verbal a stem; in three examples and in the paradigm of the verbs n-eštek-w(o) ‘(to) make one’s clothes’ and n-eštek-(o) ‘(to) cloth’, derived from the noun eštek ‘cloth’, the vowel i harmonizes with a verbal e-stem:

(26) …e-e-n-aõ (2076) 3pS-give-RFL-IA ‘they give themselves’

(27) e-õl-eh-aõ (2059) 3sA-3sO.die-CAU-IA ‘he let him die’, ‘he kills him’

(28) e-šepos-aõ (2229) 3pS-blow-IA ‘they blow’

(29) me-n-eštek-w-aõ (2015) 2sS-REL-cloth-VB-IA ‘you make your clothes’

(30) me-ø-n-eštek-ø-aõ (2064) 2sA-3sO-REL-cloth-VB-IA ‘you cloth him/her/it’

Furthermore, in two examples the vowel e instead of u is encountered before an u stem, and in one example e is encountered before an i stem:

(31) ke-ø-lusay-pakna ø-kot-aõ (2806) 1pA-3sO-pity-NE.NOM 3sS-be-IA ‘He does not deserve to be pitied by us’.

(32) …e-puly-iy (1414) 3pS-fall-PST ‘they fell’

(33) me-tsits-ia-y (2445) 2sS-come-RE-PST ‘you return’

(The stem <-tzitzia-> of the last word is a replacement of <-cheichia->, which has e in-stead of i as a stem vowel. Maybe this is why we find me- instead of mi- before the stem <-tzitzia->). The vowel e instead of i is also encountered (a) before an elided o-stem:

(34) me-kt-aõ (291) < *mi-kot-aõ 2sS-be-IA ‘you are/have’

(b) once before an elided a-stem:
(35) ke-lyw-ey (2887) <*ke-lyaw-ey 1sS-go-PST ‘we went’

(c) four times before the stem t(a)/ to ‘(to) do’:

120

(36) e-t-ta-õ (2119)

(37) ke-t-ta-õ (2119)

3sA-3sB-do-IA

1pA-3sB-do-IA

‘he does in behalf of him/her/it’

‘we do in behalf of him/her/it’

(38) me-ø-t-iy-ha-õ (2119) 2A-3sO-do-PST-PL-IA ‘you (p) do it’

(39) mu…an ke-t-to-kt-aõ (2131) prayer 1pA-3sB-do-F-IA ‘We shall pray for someone’.

The person marker po- is employed to indicate a third person object. This is possibly why the vowel o can not be copied in vowel harmony. Prefixes of the type C-a- are discussed in chapter 7.6.3. They represent an indirect object, indicating that the person is affected by the action. Vowel assimilation has also been found steminternally in loan words. In those cases, the inserted vowel harmonizes with the following stem vowel, see section 5.7.
An interesting case of vowel assimilation is found in the following verb forms: ø-pokot-te-ke and ø-pokot-o-ke, meaning ‘that it was’. According to Pedro de la Mata both are optative forms of pak(o)t ‘(to) be (there)’. In the forms ø-pokot-te-ke and ø-pokot-o-ke, an original, non-inserted vowel a is harmonized with the following stem vowel o. The ALC contains two more examples of verb stems with two vowels of which the second vowel is o and in which harmonization of the preceding vowel with o takes place. In the first example it is the vowel e which harmonizes with o, in the second example the vowel u assimilates with o:
(40) mi-ponyo-w-la (406) < mi-penyo-w-la 2sO-love-PST-3pA ‘they (p) loved you’

(41) ø-lopoh-ø (2171) < lupo(h) ‘(to) do/make’ 3sO-do/make-IMP ‘Do it!’ ‘Make it!’

The form l-u-pul-e-nap found once in the ALC, also presents an interesting case of vowel assimilation. The form stands for

(42) l-o-pul-e-nap (2174) 3sO-do-stop-SE-SEQ ‘after having stopped doing it’

121

Regularly, the stem vowel of a main verb does not assimilate with the stem vowel of a bound verb. In the form ø-l-u-pul-e-nap, however, the stem vowel of the main verb (o) ‘(to) do/make’ does harmonize with that of the bound verb pul ‘(to) stop’.

5.4.2. Vowel suppression Another commonly occurring process, besides assimilation, is vowel suppression. In the word

(43) me-kt-aõ (291) < *mi-kot-aõ 2sS-be-IA ‘you are’

for example, the vowel o has been suppressed. This is only possible when there is no threat of a consonantal clash within a same syllable, and when resyllabification can occur. In a form consisting of three syllables or more, the vowel of the second syllable is often suppressed whenever the syllable structure permits it. In a noun + verb compound, the vowel of the second and the fourth syllable can be suppressed. Examples include:

(44) *a-tsala > a-tsla (148) 1sPOS-wife ‘my wife’

(45) *a-lyaw-aõ > a-lyw-aõ (904) 1sS-go-IA ‘I go’

(46) *a-makuplew > a-mkuplew (135) 1sPOS-passion.fruit ‘my passion fruit’

(47) *a-mana-ya…-aõ > a-mna-y…-aõ (1895) 1sS-road-see-IA ‘I watch the road’

When a verb form is preceded by two person markers, the vowel -i of the second person marker is thus suppressed. However, when the second person marker is a ‘1s’, it is the vowel -i of the first person marker which is suppressed:

(48) a-m-koly-aõ (1646) 1sA-2sO-love-IA ‘I love you’
(50) m-a-kole-ki (1698) 2sA-1sO-love-IMP ‘Love me!’

(49) a-m-a-pahat-iy (1728) 1sA-2sO-APL-bring-PST ‘I brought for you’

122

Remember that the vowel o of the person prefix po-/mo- is never suppressed (cf. the re-mark in the previous section):
(51) mi-po-koly-aõ (2914) 2sA-3pO-love-IA ‘you love them’

5.5. Stem alternation A number of nouns make a distinction between an absolute form - the free form that can for instance appear as a lemma in a dictionary - and a relational form16. The relational form appears in the possessive paradigm of a noun, where it occurs after a prefixed person marker or in the zero-marked third person singular form.
Nouns that distinguish between an absolute and a relational form are those of which the stem begins with a vowel or with one of the following consonants: p, k, h, y. The vowel-initial nouns take an epenthetic n in their relational forms: #V > nV/$_:

(52) el (125) ‘cassava’ > a-n-el ‘my cassava’

me-n-el ‘your cassava’

ø-n-el ‘his/her/its cassava’

ke-n-el ‘our cassava’

me-n-el-ha ‘your (p) cassava’

e-n-el

‘their cassava’

Borrowings from Quechua and Spanish which have a vowel in initial position also take an epenthetic n in their relational forms:

(53) utsa (3547) ‘sin’

< Q hucha: ø-n-utsa (2892) ‘his/her/its sin’ a-n-utsa (1626) ‘my sin’

(54) anima (1490) ‘soul’ < Sp anima: ø-n-anima (1204) ‘his/her/its soul’

ki-n-anima (1204) ‘our soul’

Verbs derived from nouns which in their absolute form have a vowel in initial position are derived from the relational form, so that the stem of these verbs also begins with an epenthetic n:

(55) eštek (2014)

‘cloth’

a-n-eštek-w-aõ (2015) ‘I make clothes’

16 Guarani also has nouns that distinguish an absolute form from a relational form. These nouns also have a stem-initial alternation. They generally have t in initial position in the absolute form, r in a relational form (a form preceded by a determiner), and h in the relational third person singular form. E.g. tera name’, che-rera my name’, hera his name’ (Adelaar, 9 6: 5).

123

The p-initial, k-initial, y-initial and h-initial nouns alter the beginning of their stem. This alternation occurs as follows:
#p > m/$_: nouns with a stem-initial bilabial stop p change p into nasal m in their relational forms:

(56) pana (138) ‘road’ a-mna ‘my road’ mi-mna ‘your road’ ø-mana ‘his road’

ki-mna mi-mna-ha …i-mna

‘our road’ ‘your (p) road’ ‘their road’

The nouns pa ‘father’, paõ ‘mother’, pul ‘son’and pulu… ‘husband’ are exceptional.
They keep initial p in all forms but for the third person singular form. Third person singular of pa and paõ is derived from different stems: it is ø-õu… ‘his father’ instead of *ø-ma and ø-õets’his mother’ instead of *ø-maõ, respectively. In the case of pul ‘son’ and pulu… ‘husband’ (possibly < pul-u… ‘son maker’) only third person
singular has a regular rela-tional form with m in initial position: ø-mul ‘his son’; ø-mulu… ‘her husband’, respectively.
#k > õ/$_: nouns with the stop k in initial position have only one relational
form, which is also the third person singular form. In this form, velar k changes into the velar nasal õ: see the example kot ‘water’ > ø-õot ‘his water’in section 4.3.3 and 4.3.11. This k > õ substitution may also explain the deviant forms ø-õu… ‘his father’ and ø-õe… ‘his mother’ in the paradigm of pa ‘father’ and paõ ‘mother’, respectively. The lexical items pa ‘father’ and paõ ‘mother’ may be newly introduced forms, whereas the deviant forms ø-õu… ‘his father’ and ø-õets ‘his mother’ may reflect absolute forms in disuse with a velar k in initial position: *ku… and *ke…, respectively. On the other hand, instead of being inherited elements, the deviant forms ø-õu… and ø-õets could also be borrowings from Híbito. In Híbito the
words for ‘father’ and ‘mother’ have been recorded as cotc and queec, respectively
(Martínez Compañón, 1783). We may venture to interpret these Híbito words as kots/kuts and kets/kets (cf. chapter 4, section 4.2.5), respectively. They do have the stem-initial k which in Cholón regularly changes into õ in the third person singular
form. While adopting these forms, Cholón could have changed the final segment of both *ø-õots/ø-õuts and*ø-õets/ø-õets into palatal … (see also section 4.3.11, footnote
3) or it may reflect a previous phase of Híbito.
#h > s/$_: nouns which begin with a velar or glottal fricative h (see section
4.3.10.2), have a relational third person singular form which begins with fricative s:

(57) hil (1126) ‘word’ > ø-sil (1184) ‘his word’
#y > ts/$_: nouns which begin with a central approximant y alter this consonant into affricate ts (<ch> ~ <tz> ~ <z>, see section 4.3.4.3) in their relational forms. It appears that <tz> and <z> are not systematically distributed. However, third person singular forms beginning with the symbol <tz> have not been found. They always have <z> (or <ch>) in initial position:

124

(58) yap (142) ‘wild pig’

a-tsap

<a-zap>

mi-tsap <mi-zap>

ø-tsap

<zap>

ki-tsap <ki-chap>

mi-tsap-ha <mi-zap-ha>

i-tsap

<y-zap>

‘my wild pig’ ‘your wild pig’ ‘his wild pig’ ‘our wild pig’ ‘your (p) wild pig’ ‘their wild pig’

(59) yu… (144) ‘alfalfa’

a-tsu…

<a-tzuch>

‘my alfalfa’

mu-tsu… <mu-tzuch> ‘your alfalfa’

ø-tsu…

<zuch>

‘his alfalfa’

ku-tsu… <ku-zuch>

‘our alfalfa’

mu-tsu…-ha <mu-zuch-ha> ‘your (p) alfalfa’

u-tsu…

<u-tzuch>

‘their alfalfa’

The derived noun ye-lam ‘bed’, mi-ye-lam ‘your bed’ in section 5.4.1, however, shows that initial y of an absolute form does not always change into ts in a relational form. The fact that in this case absolute y does not alternate with relational ts is probably because ye-lam is derived from an intransitive verb. Stem-initial p, k, h, and y of transitive verbs do change into m, õ, s, ts, respectively, in order to indicate that the object is a third person singular (see hereafter).
#y >t/$_: Pedro de la Mata gives only one example of a noun with y in initial posi-tion that modifies this central approximant into t in its relational forms. This is the lexical item yušam ‘armadillo’, which occurs as tusšam <tuzxam> in its relational forms. Since Mrs. Gutiérrez and Mr. Chappa pronounced the word for ‘armadillo’ as [tušam], the word is represented as tušam in the relational forms listed below:

(60) a-tušam (145)

‘my armadillo’

mu-tušam (145) ‘your armadillo’

ø-tušam (145)

‘his armadillo’

ku-tušam (145)

‘our armadillo’

mu-tušam-ha (145) ‘your (p) armadillo’

u-tušam (145)

‘their armadillo’

As already noticed in the discussion in section 5.4.1 about derived nouns with a
p-initial or a m-initial stem and in the discussion above about the non-substitution of ts for initial y in the word mi-ye-lam ‘your bed’, intransitive and transitive stems alternate in the same way as nominal stems do, namely, #p > -m, #k > -õ, #h > -s, #y > -ts. Initial m, õ, s, ts then indicate that the subject or the direct object, respectively,
is a third person singular:

125

(61) õ-a-po-õ (205) 3sA-1sO-burn-IA ‘he (the sun) burns me’

i-mo-õ (205) 3sA-3sO.burn-IA ‘he burns him’

a-penyo-its-aõ (991) 1sS-want-PAS-IA ‘I am wanted’

menyo-its-aõ (1018) 3sS.want-PAS-IA ‘he is wanted’

(62) a-po-koly-aõ (2913) 1sA-3pO-love-IA I love them’

a-õoly-aõ (685) 1sA-3sO.love-IA ‘I love him’

õole-its-aõ (997) 3sS.love-PAS-IA ‘he is loved’

(63) a-p-hina-õ (2066) 1sA-1sB-hear-IA ‘I hear for myself’

a-sina-õ (1741) 1sA-3sO.hear-IA ‘I hear him’

(64) a-yoy-aõ (2060) 1sS-cry-IA ‘I cry’

a-tsoy-e-õ (2061) 1sA-3sO.cry-CAU-IA ‘I cause him to cry’

In two consecutive examples with the verb y(a)…/ y(a)š ‘(to) see’, -t instead of -ts is found (cf. absolute yušam > relational tušam above):

(65) mi-taš-t-aõ (1602) 2sA-3sO.see-F-IA ‘you will see it’

mi-taš-te (1603) 2sA-3sO.see-F ‘you will see it’

The alternated stem-initial consonants may be the result of a merger of an originally prefixed nasal (N) (cf. the prefix n- before a vowel-initial nominal stem):

N + #p N + #k N + #h N + #y

> #m > #õ
> #s > #ts, t

The prefixed nasal may be a dental-alveolar nasal n indicating ‘nominal relational form’ or a velar nasal õ indicating ‘third person singular object’ (see also section 7.6.3).
If we compare the cases of stem alternation with those of non-harmonization of the vowel i of a person prefix with a stem vowel e (see section 5.4.1), and with those

126

of the use of the person marker …i-‘3p’ instead of i-‘3p’ before certain consonants (see section 6.4.1), it appears that all three phenomena (stem alternation, nonharmonization of i with e, and the use of …i- instead of i-) have to do with the nature of a stem-initial consonant. Stem alternation takes place when the stem begins with p, k, h, y, as we have seen; the vowel i of a person marker does not harmonize with a stem vowel e when the stem begins with p/m, k, y; the person marker …i- is employed when the stem begins with p/m, k, h, when it concerns a nominal stem and with p/m, k, h, y, V, when it concerns a verbal stem. It is possible that nonassimilation of i with e also occurs before a stem-initial h but such cases have not been attested. An h-initial nominal stem followed by e has not been encountered in the ALC.

5.6. Consonant dissimilation and assimilation Consonant dissimilation and assimilation hardly ever occur in the ALC. They are found in only one case each. The prefix p-/m-, a person marker indicating that the beneficiary is the subject itself, is found in six verb forms. In four forms, before a stem-initial con-tinuant and lateral, the form p- is found, and in two forms, before a stem-initial stop, m- is encountered. In one of both forms, p- has presumably changed into a nasal in order to distinguish itself from the following stop:
(66) ki-m-koly-aõ (2068) < *…i-p-koly-aõ 1pS-1pB/REC-love-IA we love ourselves (reciprocally)’
cf. ki-p-hina-õ (2067) 1pS-1pB/REC-hear-IA ‘we hear ourselves (reciprocally)’

In the second form, on the other hand, p- may have changed into m- by assimilation with the following bilabial nasal:

(67) …i-m-meny-aõ (2069) < *…i-p-meny-aõ 3pS-3pB/REC-want-IA ‘they want themselves (reciprocally)’

a-p-yalp-aõ (2070) 1sA-1sB-gather-IA ‘I gather for myself’

The reflexive/reciprocal form …i-m-meny-aõ above has a transitive stem -meny‘3sO.want’ instead of an intransitive stem -peny- ‘want’ (stem-initial p changes into m, when the object is a third person singular, see section 5.5). This is irregular because reflexive and reciprocal forms are intransitive. Since the change from #p into m can not be the result of a merger of p and an underlying third person singular direct object õ, it may be the result of assimilation of p with the preceding benefactive person marker m-.

127

5.7. Morphonological processes in loan words Most of the loan words were adopted without major modifications. The lexical items of this category belong primarily to the semantic fields of authority, liturgy and Gospel. A few names of formerly unknown animals were also adopted without alterations:

(68) alcalde (468) (69) alguacil (400) (70) cruz (987) (71) hostia (1968) (72) Jesus (1457) (73) virgen (201) (74) elefante (1253) (75) mula (2316)

‘mayor’ ‘police officer’ ‘cross’ ‘Eucharist’ ‘Jesus’ ‘virgin’ ‘elephant’ ‘donkey’

A number of borrowings were adapted to the pronunciation and the word structure of Cholón. In addition to depalatalization and lateralization (see section 4.4), loan words belonging to this category also went through other formal processes, such as: - devoicing or fortition, - cluster simplification by the insertion of a vowel (anaptyxis) (cf. Sp plátano > palantu: pl > pal, section 5.3), - internal deletion or syncope, - transposition of segments or metathesis:

(76) Sp padre ‘father’: - devoicing: padre > *patri - anaptyxis: *patri > *patiri - lateralization: *patiri > patili (2787)

(77) Sp plátano ‘banana’:

- anaptyxis: plátano

> *palatanu

- syncope: *palatanu > *palatnu

- metathesis: *palatnu > palantu (1454)

The examples give evidence that - following the general pattern - in the case of anaptyxis the inserted vowel is a copy harmonizing with the following vowel. They also show that the Spanish mid-vowels [e] and [o] in final position were highered when they were adapted to Cholón: e > i and o > u.
The following examples of loan words were given by Mrs. Aurelia Gutiérrez and Mr. José Santos Chappa. In these borrowings, besides the processes of adaptation, vowel harmony and the highering of e and o, other phenomena can be observed, such as: - voicing - loss of a final element or apocope:

128
(78) Sp plátano ‘banana’ > palantu (see above) - syncope: palantu > [pantu]
(79) Sp compadre ‘friend’: padre > patili (see above) - voicing: *kumpatili > *kumbatili - apocope: *kumbatili > [kumbati]

129
6. Nominal morphosyntax
6.1. Introduction Alongside verbs, nouns constitute the principal word class in Cholón. In this chapter we will discuss nominal inflection and derivation (section 6.2 - 6.4), nominal subclasses (section 6.5 - 6.10), as well as derived nouns (section 6.11) and different nominal constructions (section 6.12). Cholón nouns can take both prefixes and suffixes. Possessive person markers (section 6.2) are prefixed, except for the pluralizing element -ha of the second person, which is suffixed. Possessive person markers function as bound, possessive pronouns. The collective marker is also prefixed (section 6.3). The anteriority marker -(k)e (section 6.4.1) and case markers (section 6.4.2 - 6.4.4) are suffixed, as are the affixes mentioned in section section 6.4.5. Numeral classifiers (section 6.10.2) are also suffixed.
Although the class of nouns was most probably an open word class, it comprises several subclasses which are closed and limited in size. Thus, the language had a set of seven emphatic pronouns (ok, mi, pi, sa, ki-ha, mi-na-ha, …iha, section 6.5) and, parallel to it, a set of seven periphrastic possessive pronouns (see section 6.6). It also had the following nominal determiners: four demonstratives (ko, iõko, pe, into-õko, section 6.7), five question words or interrogative stems (ana, in…a, into, into-õko, ol, section 6.8), and six indefinite pronouns (alum, an-tsel, in…a, mek, nyanmak, ol, section 6.9). Cholón furthermore had a set of numerals (section 6.10).
To prevent misunderstandings, the term ‘pronoun’ will only be used to designate the free, emphatic elements of the pronominal category. The pronominal affixes of a noun or a nominalized form are indicated by the term ‘(possessive) person marker/ prefix’.
6.2. Possessive markers Possessive markers are nominal prefixes which indicate the possessor of the object designated by the noun to which they are prefixed. The use of possessive person prefixes regularly leads to nasal epenthesis and stem alternation. Nasal epenthesis occurs when the stem of the noun begins with a vowel and stem alternation when the stem begins with one of the consonants p, k, h, y (see section 5.5). Table 6.1 shows the possessive person markers. In this table the person markers appear in their neutral form, which is either i or ends in -i where variation occurs. As we have seen in section 5.4.1, this vowel i can assimilate to the stem vowels e and u. The vowel a- of the first person singular marker remains unchanged.

The examples below show that a stem initial k and h change into õ and s, respectively, when the possessor is a third person singular:

(10) õolol (113) (11) sil (1184)

‘his kernel’ ‘his word’

< kolol ‘kernel’ < hil ‘word’

131

The second person singular is special in that the possessive form is specified for gender: mi for masculine and pi for feminine: e.g.:

(12) mi-ktsok (1275) 2smPOS-box ‘your (m) box, case, chest’

< katsok ‘box’, ‘case’, ‘chest’

(13) pi-ktsok (1277) 2sfPOS-box ‘your (f) box, case, chest’

The gender distinction is restricted to the singular. In the plural, the possessed noun takes the prefix mi- in combination with a suffix -ha. So the marker for second person plural is discontinuous: mi- ... -ha:

(14) mi-kešum-ha (118) 2POS-nose-PL ‘your (p) nose(s)’

< kešum ‘nose’

Third person singular lacks a special marker; however, the relational stem - which may or may not differ from the absolute form (cf. section 5.5) - is used, so that third person singular is either indicated indirectly by stem modification, or not at all:

(15) ø-šaš ‘his armadillo’ (125)

< šaš ‘armadillo’ (aquatic) (no

change)

(16) ø-n-olye ‘his saliva’ (108)

< olye ‘saliva’ (n-insertion)

(17) ø-makuplyew ‘his passion fruit’ (135) < pakuplyew ‘passion fruit’ (p > m)

(18) ø-õily ‘his wall’, ‘his fence’ (117)

< kily ‘wall’, ‘fence’ (k > õ)

(19) ø-tušam ‘his armadillo’ (145)

< yušam ‘armadillo’ (terrestrial)

(20) ø-tsots ‘his guinea pig’ (143)

(y > t) < yots ‘guinea pig’ (y > ts)

(21) ø-so ‘his blood’ (1204)

< ho ‘blood’ (h > s)

The possessive third person plural is either designated by a prefix i- (with vowel harmony, e-, u-), or by a prefix …i- (with vowel harmony, …u-). The vocalic prefix i-,
e-, u- appears before a relational stem beginning with an alveolar or a palatal consonant (…, t, ts, s, š, n, ny, l, ly): e.g.:

(22) e-…esminy (120) 3pPOS-cedar ‘their cedar’

(no stem modification)

132

(23) i-tsip (47) 3pPOS-house ‘their house’

< yip : y > ts

(24) i-šaš (125)

(no stem modification)

3pPOS-armadillo

‘their armadillo’

(25) e-n-el (106)

< el : n-insertion

3pPOS-REL-cassava

‘their cassava’

(26) u-nyu (154) 3pPOS-daughter ‘their daughter’

(no stem modification)

(27) i-lyolyo (132)

(no stem modification)

3pPOS-tintinnabulum

‘their tintinnabulum’

The possessive person marker …i- or …u- occurs before relational stems with an initial bilabial (p- and m-) or velar (k- and h-): e.g.:

(28) …i-paõ (140) 3pPOS-mother ‘their mother’

(no stem modification)

(29) …u-myup (137) 3pPOS-bridge ‘their bridge’

< puyup : p > m

(30) …i-kama (111) 3pPOS-illness ‘their illness’

(no stem modification)

(31) …i-ha… ( 112) 3pPOS-field ‘their fields’

(no stem modification)

In the data the form …e- ‘3p’ is not attested before a nominal stem, but it does occur as a verbal prefix (see section 5.4.1 and chapter 7).

133

6.3. Collective marker A collective is indicated by means of the morpheme pa-, prefixed to nouns:

(32) pa-lew

ušuš i-lyaw-aõ (1979)

COL-caterpillar butterfly 3pS-become-IA

‘Caterpillars become butterflies’.

Cf. lew

ušuš ø-lyaw-aõ (1975)

caterpillar butterfly 3sS-become-IA

‘The caterpillar becomes a butterfly”.

(33) maha-ly pa-mo p-a-tsa…-iy (1677) INT-RST COL-fruit 2sfA-1sO.APL-3sO.see-PST ‘You (f) saw a lot of fruits for me’.

Cf. mo-ke-ly (1164) fruit-ANT-RST ‘full of fruit’

6.4. Suffixes Nouns, pronouns, demonstratives and question words can be followed by different types of suffixes, such as, a nominal past marker, case markers and discourse markers. The nominal past marker, case markers and special combinations of case markers are analyzed in section 6.4.1, 6.4.2, and 6.4.3, respectively. Section 6.4.4 contains three overviews: a table showing the occurrence of case markers and combinations of case markers after nouns, pronouns and demonstratives; a table concerning the combinability of case markers with each other; and a table presenting a canonical order of case markers. Other suffixes, restrictive -(a)ly, diminutive -…u, plural marker -lol, adjectivizer -(k)o, indefinite marker -pit and natural pair marker -pulyeõ, are discussed in section 6.4.5. (Suffixes which can be translated as an adverb are treated in chapter 8, together with adverbs. Discourse markers are treated in chapter 10). As a rule, no more than three suffixes can be attached to nouns, pronouns, and demonstratives. Only the interrogative stem into can be followed by four suffixes. In this section, mainly examples with nouns, pronouns and demonstratives are given. Question words are treated in section 6.8.

6.4.1. Anteriority marker -(k)e The suffix -(k)e ‘from’, ‘of’ (-e after consonants, -ke after vowels) indicates ‘anteriority’, ‘past’, viz. origin, the point of departure, a former location, or a closed, bygone period. It can be attached to verb forms (see section 7.4.3) and to nominal stems. When -(k)e is attached to nominal stems, it expresses belonging, provenance, or material, and it can function as a nominal past marker, indicating a ‘former state’. The nominal anteriority marker -(k)e is found after nouns, pronouns and demonstratives:

134

(34) kapi-ke (156) present.day-ANT ‘today’s’

(35) ampal-e (155) yesterday-ANT ‘yesterday’s’, ‘something of the old days’

(36) a-pa

õol-iy

ø-kot-aõ-ko-man-ap,

1sPOS-father 3sS.die-PST 3sS-be-IA-DEM-INES-ABL

ok-e a-kl-iy a-kot-te-he

a-menyo-õo (2784)

1s-ANT 1sS-die-PST 1sS-be-INF-BEN 1sA-3sO.want-FN2

‘I would prefer to be dead, than that my father has died’.

(37) ko-ke õap-ø (2593) this-ANT 3sO.take-IMP ‘Take from this!’

It can also occur after the indefinite pronoun mek ‘all’, when this pronoun refers to inanimate objects:

(38) mek-e, mek-liw-e

õap-ø (157)

all-ANT all-CL:multiform/coloured-ANT 3sO.take/receive-IMP

‘Take/receive all sorts of things!’

Expressions referring to material are formed, when -(k)e is suffixed to a noun designating a material (English ‘made of’):

(39) …e…o-ke (152) silver-ANT ‘silver’, ‘made of silver’

(40) me…-e (2277) tree/wood-ANT ‘wooden’, ‘made of wood’

(41) ta-ke (2276) stone-ANT ‘stone’, ‘made of stone’

The following phrase is a good example of nominal past. It can only be used when Luis and Juana are deceased:
(42) Luis-e, Juana-ke u-nyu (154) Luis-ANT Juana-ANT 3pPOS-daughter ‘the late Luis’ and the late Juana’s daughter’

When the suffix -(k)e appears after a place name or a noun designating a locality, it is often preceded by the adessive case marker -te ‘at’, ‘in’:

135

(43) España-te-ke a-kt-aõ (2280) Spain-AD-ANT 1sS-be-IA ‘I am from Spain’.

(44) ko-te-ke

a-kt-aõ (2283)

here-AD-ANT 1sS-be-IA

‘I am from here’.

(45) Lima-te-ke (2279) Lima-AD-ANT ‘from Lima’

The following example shows that -(k)e is synonymous with ablative -(a)p, when occurring after personal adessive -tu ‘at someone’s place’:

(46) ow-tu-p/ow-tu-ke (2271) distance-AD-ABL/distance-AD-ANT ‘from (a)far’

6.4.2. Case markers Cholón has the following suffixes that can function as case markers: ablative -(a)p, benefactive -he, terminative -le, inessive -man, comparative -(mi)ny, perlative -nake, prolative -nayme, comitative -nik, instrumental -pat, allative -pi, and the adessives -te and -tu. All case markers but for -nake, -nayme and -nik have been found in combinations with other case markers. Frequent combinations with specialized meanings are -lyak-pat, -lyak-te-p, -man-ap, -pat-le, -te-p, -tu-p and -tu-p-e. These combinations are analyzed in section 6.4.3. For other combinations involving case markers, see section 6.4.5.

6.4.2.1. Ablative -(a)p The ablative case marker -(a)p ‘after’, ‘from’, ‘of’ usually occurs after another suffix. The form -ap is used after a consonant, -p after a vowel. There are only a few expressions where the forms -ap and -p occur not preceded by another suffix: e.g.:

(47) liman-ap (1728) mountain-ABL ‘from the mountains’

(48) iõko-p-aly (2752) that-ABL-RST ‘constantly’

(49) pe-p

nyan (2416)

yonder-ABL face

‘on the other side’

Only once the suffix -(a)p was encountered after a pronoun:

136

(50) into-õko-pit mu…aõ a-l-o-kt-aõ-iõko, sa-p-sim

which-DEM-COR kiss

1sA-3sO-do-F-IA-DEM 3s-ABL-EMP

ø-kot-aõ, mi-tsap-ha-ki (1474)

3sS-be-IA 2A-3sO.catch-PL-IMP

‘And he whom I shall give a kiss, from him it is, catch him!’

6.4.2.2. Benefactive -he The suffix -he ‘for’, ‘for the benefit of’ is found after nouns and pronouns:

(51) hayu-he (23) man-BEN ‘for the man’

(52) ok-he (159) 1s-BEN ‘for me’

(53) Dios-he a-lu-pakt-aõ (164) Dios-BEN 1sS-interior-be-IA ‘I think of God’.

(54) ki-ha-he mu…an ki-pa

to-ki (168)

1p-PL-BEN prayer 1pPOS-father do-IMP

‘Pray for us!’

Benefactive -he is also used to express a need. A compliment in -he + the verb k(o)t ‘(to) be’ expresses a ‘need for’:

(55) ka…-he a-kt-aõ (165) maize-BEN 1sS-be-IA ‘I have a need for maize’.

(56) mi-he a-kot-p-aõ (166) 2s-BEN 1sS-be-NE-IA ‘I do not need you’.

6.4.2.3. Terminative -le The suffix -le ‘until’ indicates a movement up to a certain point. It often occurs with the instrumental case marker -pat (see terminative -pat-le, section 6.4.3.2). It does not occur with other suffixes. In combinations with other suffixes the derived form pat-le is preferred. This derived form -pat-le can be used after nouns, pronouns and demonstratives, whereas the use of -le is restricted to nouns:
(57) liman-le (2244) mountain-TERM ‘until the mountains’, ‘up to the mountains’

137

6.4.2.4. Inessive -man The suffix -man indicates location within a given space. It can be attached to nouns and pronouns:

(58) iglesia-man (2395) church-INES ‘in the church’

(59) mi-na-ha-man (2396) 2-CON-PL-INES ‘in your (p) midst’

(60) ø-nyan-man-aly (2290) 3sPOS-face-INES-RST ‘in someone’s presence only’, ‘face to someone only’

Inessive -man is often followed by the ablative case marker -(a)p (see -man-ap, section 6.4.3.6). It can futhermore be followed by the non-personal adessive case marker -te ‘at’, ‘in’:

(61) ok a-nyan-man-te (2287) 1s 1sPOS-face-INES-AD ‘in my presence’, ‘face to me’

6.4.2.5. Comparative -(mi)ny The suffix -(mi)ny functions as a comparative case marker ‘as’, ‘like’, ‘according
to’. Both allomorphs occur after demonstratives:

(62) ko-ny (2598) this.one-CMP ‘like this one’

(63) ko-miny (2597) this.one-CMP ‘like this one’

(64) iõko-ny (2747) that.one-CMP ‘like that one’

(65) iõko-miny (994) that.one-CMP ‘like that one’

(66) pe-ny (2738) that.one.yonder-CMP ‘like that one yonder’

The form -ny can be followed bij the ablative case marker -(a)p and the allative case marker -pi:

(67) ko-ny-ap (2528) this-CMP-ABL ‘of this size’

(68) ko-ny-pi (2408) here-CMP-AL ‘to here’

138

Everywhere else the form -miny is the only one possible. It can be attached to nouns and pronouns:

(69) lyaksa suku-miny (2327) lightness bird-CMP ‘light as a bird’

(70) ets-miny ay-te-…u

mits-aõ (2328)

thief-CMP background/backside-AD-DIM 3sS.come-IA

‘He comes quietly as a thief’.

(71) ki-ha-miny (2495) 1p-PL-CMP ‘like us’

6.4.2.6. Perlative -nake The suffix -nake means ‘by the agency of’, ‘by means of’, ‘through’, ‘via’. It can indicate, (i), a cause or source of action; (2) a substituted item (instead) or a pretext. When -nake indicates a cause or source of action, it is found after nouns and pronouns:

(72) mi-hil-nake a-yey-la-õ (2385) 2sPOS-word-PER 1sO-laugh-3pA-IA ‘Because of your words, they laugh at me’.

(73) mi-nake a-lu-po-y-la-õ (2386) 2s-PER 1sO-interior-burn-SE-3pA-IA ‘Because of you, they abhor me’.

When -nake indicates a substituted item or a pretext it is attached to nouns, and can be translated as ‘instead (of)’:

(74) ki-ha-wa ki-l-o-pakna-ke,

mi-nake mi-l-ø-õ (2383)

1p-PL-TOP 1pA-3sO-do-NE.NOM-ANT 2s-PER 2sA-3sO-do-IA

‘What we could not do, you do’.

(75) fierro

kot-nake sinta-pit, ø-n-eštek-pit

i-ms-aõ (2382)

iron.tools being-PER ribbon-IND 3sPOS-REL-cloth-IND 3sA-3sO.buy-IA

‘Instead of iron tools, he buys clothes and ribbons’.

139

6.4.2.7. Prolative -nayme The suffix -nayme ‘by’, ‘through’, ‘via’ was probably derived from the noun ay ‘back(side)’, which has a relational form n-ay: as in mi-n-ay-ha ‘your (p) back’. It is encountered after nouns and pronouns (and after the interrogative stem into ‘where’, ‘which location’, ‘which’, see section 6.8.3):

(76) pana-nayme Soledad-te ki-ante-kte-he, Huaylillas-nayme road-PRO Soledad-AD 1pS-arrive-INF-BEN Huaylillas-PRO ki-paly-aõ (2304) 1pS-pass-IA ‘To arrive at Soledad by road, we pass through Huaylillas’.
(77) liman-nayme a-tsits-ia-õ (2446) mountain-PRO 1sS-go-RE-IA ‘I return through the mountains’.

(78) ko-nayme (2605) here-PRO ‘through here’
(80) into-nayme me-tsits-ia-y (2445) where-PRO 2sS-go-RE-PST ‘Through where did you return?’

(79) pe-nayme (2606) there-PRO ‘through there’

6.4.2.8. Comitative -nik The case marker -nik ‘with’, ‘in the company of’, derived from the noun nek ‘company’, appears after nouns and pronouns: e.g.:

(81) hayu-nik (32)

(82) sa-nik (214)

man-COM

3s-COM

‘with/in the company of the man’

‘with him’

(83) ki-ha-nik (216) 1p-PL-COM ‘with us’

The suffix -nik can also be used to designate an internal or external characteristic feature (‘provided with’): e.g.:

(84) …ul-nik (1160) snot-COM ‘snotty’

(85) nyansik-nik (1042) effort-COM ‘laborious’

140

(86) šeš-nik (1043) scabies-COM ‘scabby’

It can furthermore function as an instrumental ‘with’: e.g.:
(87) in…a lyuhlam-nik-am (2811) thing objective-COM-QM ‘With what objective?’

6.4.2.9. Instrumental -pat The suffix -pat ‘with (the help of)’, ‘by (means of)’ indicates the instrument or means by which an action takes place, or the reason why something happens. It usually appears after nouns and pronouns:
(88) me…-pat i-ø-lowts-iy (30) stick-INS 3sS-3sO-hit-PST ‘He hit him with a stick’.

(89) in…a-pat-am m-a-lu-po-õ (189) what-INS-QM 2sA-1sO-interior-burn-IA ‘Why do you hate me?’.

(90) mi-pat a-luyum-aõ (188) 2s-INS 1sS-suffer/be.ill-IA ‘Because of you I suffer/am ill’.

The form -pat is only twice found after a demonstrative, namely, after ko ‘this’. In these examples, however, ko occurs after an imperfective aspect form and functions as a relativizer ‘this one which/who’:

(91) pana išiwah ø-pakt-aõ-ko-pat ma nyansik-pat road bad 3sS-be-IA-DEM-INS INT effort-INS mi-pahat-iy-ha me-kt-iy-ha-õ (320) 2S-descend-PST-PL 2S-be-SE-PL-IA ‘Since the road is bad, you (p) have descended with great effort’. (lit.: ‘You have descended with great effort, because of the road which is bad’).

(92) ke…wak a-kt-aõ-ko(-lyak)-pat, a-hlyem

mi-kot-p-aõ (411)

poor 1sS-be-IA-DEM(-NF)-INS 1sPOS-friend 2sS-be-NE-IA

‘Since I am poor, you are not my friend’.

Instrumental -pat, when suffixed to the noun tu ‘direction’, also means ‘in’. The combination tu-pat can be translated as ‘against’, ‘for’, ‘of’, ‘to(wards)’:

141

(93) ø-tu-pat

mahak mi-o-no-ki(222)

3sPOS-direction-INS guard 2sS-do-RFL-IMP

‘Be on your guard against him!’

(94) Dios ø-tu-pat

mi-ø-…ikno-ki (221)

God 3sPOS-direction-INS 2sS-3sO-fear-IMP

‘Fear God!’

(95) ku-tu-pat

u-n-utsa

l-o-w-la-õ-ko-lol (220)

1pPOS-direction-INS 3pPOS-REL-sin 3sO-do-SE-3pA-IA-DEM-PL

‘those who commit a sin against us’

The suffix -pat is often found in combination with the form -lyak- (see the example a-kt-aõ-ko(-lyak)-pat ‘because I am’ above). This form may be a nominalized form of the verb lya/ly(a)w ‘(to) go’: -lya + -k ‘nominalizer’. According to de la Mata’s ‘declination of the noun’ (fol. 3), -pat and -lyak-pat are synonyms. However, -lyak-
pat indicates the reason why something happens, so that its meaning is more causal
than instrumental, and it is found after nouns, pronouns and demonstratives,
whereas -pat mainly occurs after nouns and pronouns:

(96) in…a-lyak-pat-am m-a-lu-po-õ (189) what-NF-INS-QM 2sA-1sO-interior-burn-IA ‘Why do you hate me?’

(97) mi mi-lyak-pat (2368)

(98) ko-lyak-pat (2602)

2s 2s-NF-INS

this-NF-INS

‘you, because of your agency’

‘because of this’

6.4.2.10. Allative -pi The suffix -pi ‘to’ expresses a movement towards a goal or location. It is not found after a personal pronoun: e.g.:

(99) teh-pi (2412) height/upper.course-AL ‘to the upper course’

(100)

ampe-pi (2411) bottom/lower.reaches-AL ‘to the bottom/lower reaches’

(101)

pe am-pi (2410) yonder place-AL ‘to yonder’

(102)

ko-pi (2409) here-AL ‘to here’

Allative -pi can also express a movement towards a certain moment or time, when suffixed to ana ‘when’:

142

(103) (105)

ana-pi-…o-m (2485) when-AL-already-QM ‘When?’

(104)

ana-pi-m mi-lya-kt-aõ (1971) when-AL-QM 2sS-go-F-IA ‘When will you go?’

ana-pi-…in (2482) when-AL-NE ‘I do not know when’.

The ending -pi can be followed by the ablative case marker -(a)p. The meaning of the combination is that of an ablative. This sequence -pi-p can then be preceded by the non-personal adessive case marker -te:

(106)

Pisana-pi-p (2451) Pisana-AL-ABL ‘from Pisana’

(107)

Pucala-te-pi-p (2452) Pucara-AD-AL-ABL ‘from Pucara’

Cf. the form Lima-te-ke ‘from Lima’, section 6.4.1, where the nominal past marker (k)e, which is synonymous with ablative -(a)p, is also preceded by the non-personal adessive case marker -te when occurring after a place name or a noun designating a locality.

6.4.2.11. Non-personal adessive -te The suffix -te ‘at’, ‘in’, indicating location, occurs after nouns and demonstratives. (After personal pronouns the suffix -tu is found, see section 6.4.2.12 below).

(108)

ki-tsip-te

ke-tõ-aõ (173)

1pPOS-home-AD 1pS-sit/stay-IA

‘We are at home’.

(109)

Dios-te amehe-na a-ki-aõ (178) God-AD truth-QUOT 1sS-speak-IA ‘I say: “The thruth is in God”/“I believe in God”’.

(110)

ko-te (175) this-AD ‘here’

The suffix -te may also function as a directional ‘into’, ‘to’, especially when occurring with a motion verb:

(111)

putam-te a-lyw-aõ (174) village-AD 1sS-go-IA ‘I go to the village’.

143

6.4.2.12. Personal adessive -tu The suffix -tu ‘at’, a derivation of the noun tu ‘direction’ (cf. ø-tu 3sPOS-direction ‘his/her/its direction’), is attached to nouns and pronouns. It indicates that the location is someone’s house or place (cf. section 6.4.1):

(112)

Pedro-tu ki-toõ-t-aõ (184) Pedro-AD 1pS-sit/stay-F-IA ‘We shall stay at Pedro’s’.

(113)

sa-tu (219) 3s-AD ‘at his house’

Like -te it can also function as a directive ‘to someone’s house’ when it occurs with verbs which express a motion:

(114)

Juan-tu a-lyw-aõ (183) Juan-AD 1sS-go-IA ‘I go to Juan’s’.

(115)

a-pa-tu

mi-pa-ha-tu-pit

a-moh-n-aõ (2331)

1sPOS-father-AD 2POS-father-PL-AD-COR 1sS-go.up-RFL-IA

‘I go up to my father’s and to your (p) father’s house’.

6.4.3. Fixed combinations The case markers -(a)p ‘ablative’, -le ‘terminative’, -man ‘inessive’, -pat ‘instrumental’, -te ‘non-personal adessive’, -tu ‘(personal) adessive’ frequently occur together in fixed combinations. Non-personal adessive -te + ablative -(a)p, and instrumental -pat also occur in combination with the suffix -lyak. The combinations thus formed are -lyak-pat ‘causal’; -lyak-te-p ‘instrumental’; -man-ap ‘ablative’; -pat-le ‘terminative’; -te-p ‘instrumental’, ‘elative’; -tu-p ‘agent, ‘focus’, ‘source’, ‘from someone’s house or place’, ‘at’; -tu-p-e ‘provenance’.

6.4.3.1. Suffix combination -man-ap ‘ablative’ Inessive -man often occurs together with ablative -(a)p. The ending -man-ap, indicating primarily posteriority, can be translated as ‘after’, ‘as’, ‘from’, ‘in the quality of’. It can be attached to nouns, pronouns and demonstratives:

(116)

6.4.3.2. Suffix combination -pat-le ‘terminative’ The form -pat-le contains the instrumental case marker -pat (see section 6.4.2.9) and the terminative case marker -le (see section 6.4.2.3). Unlike the terminative case marker -le, which is only used after nouns and which does not normally occur with other suffixes, -pat-le can be used after nouns, pronouns and demonstratives, and does occur with other suffixes:

Like terminative -le, the suffix combination -pat-le, meaning ‘as far as’, ‘to’, ‘until’, indicates a limit of space (see the examples above). However, it can also mean ‘for’, ‘(with)in’, ‘until’ and indicate a limit of time, when suffixed to a temporal indicator:

6.4.3.3. Suffix combination -te-p ‘instrumental’, ‘elative’ The ending -te-p ‘by’ is composed of adessive -te and ablative -(a)p. As an instrumental, it indicates the source of action. It can also function as an elative ‘from’. This case marker combination can be attached to nouns, pronouns and demonstratives, including the demonstrative ko functioning as a relativizer ‘this one which/who’ (see -pat, section 6.4.2.9):

Like -pat, -te-p is often preceded by -lyak-, assumedly a nominalized verb form consisting of a stem lya + a nominalizer -k (see lyak-pat, section 6.4.2.9). According to de la Mata, -lyak-te-p is synonymous with -te-p (and with -pat and -lyak-pat). Both -te-p and -lyak-te-p are instrumentals and indicate the source of an action.
However, -te-p can also indicate a ‘motion from’ and it can be suffixed to nouns,

146

pronouns and demonstratives, whereas -lyak-te-p can not be used in that way and is mainly suffixed to nouns:

(132)

nun-lol-lyak-te-p (44) man-PL-NF-AD-ABL ‘by the men’

6.4.3.4. Suffix combination -tu-p ‘agent’, ‘focus’; ‘source’; ‘from someone’s house or place’; ‘at’
The ending -tu-p is a combination of personal adessive -tu and ablative -p. This suffix combination is multifunctional. It is considered to be a nominative or agent marker by Pedro de la Mata. It appears, however, that the ending -tu-p mostly functions as a focus marker (see section 6.4.3.4.1). Furthermore, -tu-p can indicate an oblique case, rather than a ‘nominative’, namely, when it occurs with the meaning ‘because of’, ‘by/through the agency of’ and indicates a source or agent (section 6.4.3.4.2); in a few cases, -tu-p also means ‘from (someone’s) house or place’ (see section 6.4.3.4.3), or ‘at’ in temporal expressions (see section 6.4.3.4.4).

6.4.3.4.1. Suffix combination -tu-p ‘agent’, ‘focus’ According to de la Mata the suffix -tu-p is an agent marker17, and he gives the
following example:

(133)

Juan-tu-p Pedro i-ø-lam-iy (87) Juan-AD-ABL Pedro 3sA-3sO-kill-PST ‘Juan killed Pedro’.

The ending occurs after nouns and pronouns:

mi-tu-p m-a-hia-õ (1647) 2s-AD-ABL 2sA-1sO-wait.for-IA ‘You, you wait for me’.

The suffix -tu-p is also translated as ‘self’, ‘in fact’:

(138)

Dios-tu-p hayu i-tsm-e-y (1307) God-AD-ABL man 3sA-3sO.know-CAU-PST ‘God himself/in fact created the man’.

(139)

ok-tu-p (2340) 1s-AD-ABL ‘I myself’

The use of a specific ending -tu-p to mark the agent is optional. In most cases, the agent can be recognized by its position, or because it is indicated in the verb form. At the syntactic level, Cholón has SOV order, and, in the verb form, person markers indicating the agent usually precede those indicating the object. The ending -tu-p occurs in thirty-four sentences as a ‘nominative’ or ‘agent’ marker: fourteen simple sentences and twenty-two compound sentences. In compound sentences, -tu-p can occur only once. The clause in which -tu-p then occurs may be the main clause (see the second example: Dios-tu-p yam mo-o-w) or a subordinate clause (see the third example: fiscal-tu-p-a… i-k-šayš-t-aõ-a). However, in two cases the use of an agent marker is necessary: (i) when a first person plural marker ki- occurs together with a second person marker -m-. In a verb form, namely, ki- always precedes the second person marker, no matter whether ki- is the agent or the object. In the clause mi-tu-p ki-m-koly-aõ ‘you love us’ (fourth example), for instance, the word ki-m-koly-aõ by itself would be glossed as: 1pA-2sO-love-IA ‘we love you’; viz. first person plural would be considered the agent and second person plural the object. Therefore, in this clause, the pronoun + -tu-p is obligatory, and can not be omitted; (ii) in the following clause in which the agent follows the object:

148

(140)

melyus-pit insoney-tu-p i-ø-nyantuõ-šipe-y (781) boat-COR gulf-AD-ABL 3sA-3sO-cover-nearly.do-PST ‘and the gulf nearly covered the boat’

In the other thirty-two examples the agent regularly precedes the object, so that the use of -tu-p to mark an agent is redundant. The suffix -tu-p may there be used to mark a focus. In the following compound sentence (a variant of the previous example melyus-pit insoney-tu-p i-ø-nyantuõ-šipe-y ‘and the gulf nearly covered the boat’), for instance, the focus of the sentence, not the emphasis, is indicated by -tup. Emphasis is indicated by means of the suffix -sim:

(141)

ko-sim-a

an-tsel

ki-ø-nano-õo

o…o kas mek

here-EMP-TOP one-CL:truncal 1pA-3sO-fear-FN2 big wind all kot-man ø-tapa…i-iy, insoney-tu-p melyus ø-nyantuõ-la-kt-e… (779)

water-INES 3sS-rise-PST gulf-AD-ABL boat 3sO-cover-3pA-F-FAC

‘Look here, a big frightful wind rose in the sea, the gulfs were about to

cover the boat’.

In the example below -tu-p marks the agent argument as contrastively focussed:

(142)

mek-tu-p …i-hil-hu, ko-ly sil-p-aõ (2662) all-AD-ABL 3pS-speak-SR this-RST 3sS.speak-NE-IA ‘Since all are speaking, only this one does not speak’.

6.4.3.4.2. Suffix combination -tu-p ‘source’ The ALC contains one example of a reflexive verb with a -tu-p argument indicating ‘source’ or ‘agency’. The ending -tu-p can then be translated as ‘because of’, ‘by/through the agency of’:

(143)

Dios-tu-p i-…ikn-aõ (2830) God-AD-ABL 3pS-be.afraid/be.frightened-IA ‘They are afraid/frightened because of/by the agency of God’. ‘They fear God’.

149

6.4.3.4.3. Suffix combination -tu-p ‘from (someone’s) house or place’ In the following example, -tu-p, suffixed to a noun, indicates ‘from (someone’s) house or place’ (cf. personal adessive -tu ‘at someone’s house or place’, section 6.4.2.12). Normally, when -tu-p means ‘from (someone’s) house or place’, it is suffixed to a pronoun and followed by the nominal past marker -(k)e (see the suffix combination -tu-p-e, section 6.4.3.5 below):

(144)

a-pa-tu-p

a-an-aõ (2333)

1sPOS-father-AD-ABL 1sS-come-IA

‘I come from my father’s house’.

6.4.3.4. Suffix combination -tu-p in temporal expressions When -tu-p is found after demonstrative iõko ‘that’, followed by the word nyalok
‘time’, it means ‘at’. In this case, adessive -tu has a temporal use:

(145)

iõko-tu-p nyalok (2786) that-AD-ABL time ‘at that time’, ‘then’

(146)

iõko-tu-p nyalok-aly (2886) that-AD-ABL time-RST ‘at that same time’

6.4.3.5. Suffix combination -tu-p-e ‘provenance’ The suffix combination -tu-p-e consists of the following case markers: personal adessive -tu, ablative -(a)p and nominal past marker -(k)e. It usually occurs after pronouns. In this combination, -tu-p means ‘provenance from someone’s house or place’ (see also section 6.4.2.12 and 6.4.3.4). The form -tu-p-e has a deictic function and is translated as ‘those from’ and as a possessive pronoun ‘mine’, ‘yours’, etc. when it occurs together with a pronoun:

(147)

ow-tu-p-e (2588) distance-AD-ABL-ANT ‘those from a distant place’, ‘those from afar’

6.4.4. Overviews Table 6.2 presents an overview of the case markers and suffix combinations -he, -le, -lyak-pat, -lyak-te-p, -man, -man-ap, -(mi)ny, -nake, -(a)p, -nayme, -nik, -te-p, -pat, -pat-le, -pi, -te, -tu, -tu-p, -tu-p-e and their occurrence after nouns, pronouns and demonstratives. Since -tu-p occurs only once after a demonstrative, and since -tu-p-e has only once been found after a noun, the plus signs of -tu-p and -tu-p-e for demonstratives and nouns, respectively, are in parentheses. In Table 6.4 an overview is given of the mutual combinability of the case markers -(a)p, -he, -le, man, -(mi)ny, -pat, -pi, -te, -tu, analyzed in section 6.4.2.1 - 6.4.2.12. Perlative -nake ‘by (the agency of)’, ‘by means of’, ‘instead of’, ‘through’; prolative -nayme ‘by’, ‘through’, ‘via’ and comitative -nik are not listed in this table, because they are never followed by a case marker. (Fixed suffix combinations, but for the combination -pat-le ‘terminative’, which can be followed by the case marker -he, are never followed by a case marker either). It appears that the ablative case marker -(a)p is most frequently found in combinations with other case markers. Table 6.4 gives an overview of a canonical order of the case markers which can occur together.

6.4.5. Other suffixes Other suffixes, besides discourse markers (see chapter 10), found after nouns, pronouns and demonstratives, are restrictive -(a)ly, diminutive -…u, plural marker -lol, adjectivizer -(k)o, indefinite -pit and natural pair marker -pulyeõ. The suffixes -(a)ly and -pit always occur word-finally (see Table 6.6, section 6.4.5.7). The suffix -pulyeõ has a limited use.
6.4.5.1. Restrictive -(a)ly18 The suffix -(a)ly functions as a restrictive ‘nothing else but’, ‘only’. It is encountered after nouns and demonstratives. The suffix -(a)ly is then often preceded by case markers: -(a)p ‘ablative’, -man ‘inessive’, -nik ‘comitative’, -pat ‘instrumental’, -pat-le ‘terminative’, -pi ‘allative’, -te ‘adessive’. It has never been encountered before a case marker. The form -ly usually occurs after a vowel, -aly after a consonant.

-kapokaly is not explained. It presumably consists of an element kapok and the suffix -aly. The combination kapok-aly has been found as a suffix after the noun wem
‘sweet potato’ and after the case marker -man ‘in’:

6.4.5.3. Plural marker -lol The suffix -lol is employed as a plural marker. It is suffixed to nouns, pronouns and demonstratives, and it can be followed by the same suffixes as those attached to nouns, pronouns and demonstratives:

(176) (178) (180) (182)
(183)

yamkuila nun-lol-he (1038) diligence man-PL-BEN ‘for the diligent men’

6.4.5.4. Adjectivizer -(k)o The morpheme -(k)o is encountered after the nouns nun ‘man’ and ila ‘woman’ (nun-o ‘male’, ila-ko ‘female’), after cardinal numbers, and after the suffixes -(mi)ny-ap in the forms ko-ny-ap-o ‘of this size’ and -miny-ap-o ‘as’, ‘like’. The form -o occurs postconsonantally, -ko postvocalically. The function of the suffix is unclear. Pedro de la Mata remarks that -(k)o is employed as a distributive when it is suffixed to a cardinal number. For example:

(184) iš-ta (1094) ‘three’ > iš-ta-ko iš-ta-ko ‘in/of threes’

155

(185) pak (1094) ‘eight’ > pak-o pak-o ‘in/of eights’

De la Mata does not mention the function of the suffix in the other cases. However,
in all the above-mentioned cases, forms ending in -(k)o function as attributive adjuncts. The suffix -(k)o is therefore likely to be an adjectivizer20.
The combination -miny-ap-o (comparative-ablative-adjectivizer) has only been found in the following example, where it is used as an alternative for -miny:

(186)

atelypa …e-miny-ap-o

rasu muly-iy (1198)

chicken egg-CMP-ABL-ADJ hail 3sS.fall-PST

‘Hailstones as big as chicken’s eggs came down’.

(187)

atelypa …e-miny rasu muly-iy (1198) chicken egg-CMP hail 3sS.fall-PST ‘Hailstones as big as chicken’s eggs came down’.

6.4.5.5. Indefinite -pit The suffix -pit functions, (i), as an indefinite marker ‘(wh ...)ever’, and, (ii), as a coordinating sentential marker ‘and’, ‘too’21 (see section 10.6 and 12.1). When -pit functions as an indefinite marker, it can be attached to nouns and pronouns. Examples in which -pit is used as an indefinite marker are

(188)

in…a-pit (1338) what-IND ‘whatever’

(189)

ol-pit (1337) who-IND ‘whoever’

(190)

into mek in…a ø-m-a-kot-aõ,

what-IND

2sO-leave-3pA-F-IA

‘All the things you have, they all will leave you’.

Indefinite -pit has been found after the case markers -man ‘inessive’, -pi ‘allative’, -te ‘adessive’; the nominal past marker -(k)e; and after diminutive -…u:

(191)

into-te-ke-pit (2538) where-AD-ANT-IND ‘from wheresoever’

21 Compare Mochica, where a suffix -o ~ -yo functions as an adjectivizer (Adelaar, 2004: 333-34).
22
The use -pit is similar to Quechua -pas ‘(wh ...)ever’, ‘too’.

6.4.5.6. Natural pair marker -pulyeõ The suffix -pulyeõ (60) ‘pair’ is attached to basic kin terms: ‘father’, ‘mother’, ‘son’,
‘daughter’, ‘husband’, ‘wife’. When these lexical items make a distinction between an absolute form and a relational form, -pulyeõ is suffixed to the relational or third
person singular possessive form. It indicates a pair which is formed by the family
member in question + its counterpart:

(196)

õu…-pulyeõ (51) 3sPOS.father-pair ‘father and son’

(197)

mul-pulyeõ (52) 3sPOS.son-pair ‘son and father’

6.4.5.7. Overview Table 6.5 below shows the combinability of the suffixes -(a)ly ‘restrictive’, -…u ‘diminutive’, -lol ‘plural marker’, -(k)o ‘adjectivizer’, -pit ‘indefinite marker’, -pulyeõ ‘natural pair marker’ with nouns, pronouns and demonstratives. It appears that all suffixes occur after nouns; that only -pit can occur after a pronoun; and that -(a)ly, -…u, -lol also appear after a demonstrative. Table 6.6 shows the combinability of the suffixes analyzed in section 6.4.5.1 - 6.4.5.6 with case markers. It appears that -(a)ly, -…u, -(k)o and -pit can be suffixed to a case marker; that only -…u and -lol have been found before a case marker; and that -pulyeõ is neither found before nor after a case marker. The case markers which can be suffixed to diminutive -…u and plural marker -lol are not specified in the table below. The case markers which occur after restrictive -(a)ly, diminutive -…u, adjectivizer -(k)o and indefinite -pit, on the other hand, are mentioned in Table 6.6. Table 6.6 furthermore shows that the suffix -(a)ly is easily combinable with other suffixes, followed by -pit. The former has been found after seven different case markers and after one suffix combination, the latter has been encountered after four different case markers.

6.5. Personal pronouns For personal reference, Cholón disposes of free, non-affixed pronouns in addition to the bound person markers discussed in section 6.2. The paradigm of these pronouns is given in Table 6.6.

Table 6.6. Personal pronouns

singular

plural

1

ok

2m

mi

2f

pi

3

sa

ki-ha mi-na-ha mi-na-ha …i-ha

The paradigm shows that the second person singular has distinct forms for masculine and feminine (cf. section 6.2), and that plural is marked by the suffix -ha. In the case of the second person plural form mi-na-ha, the plural marker is suffixed to mi by means of a linking element -na-.

6.6. Periphrastic possessive pronouns Pedro de la Mata observes that possessive pronouns are formed by means of the particle <lou> or <ilou>/<ylou> (“lou, declinandola con sus posessivos, sifnifica lo que meus, mea, meum”, fol. 8), and he gives the following paradigm:

<oc alou> (1282)

‘mine’

<mimilou> (1283)

‘yours’

<sa ilou> (1284)

‘his’, ‘hers’

<quiha quilou> (1285) ‘ours’

<mimilouha> (1286) ‘yours’ (p)

(also: <minahamimilouha> or <minajamilouha>)

<chiha loula> (1287) ‘theirs’

According to de la Mata, <mimilouha> is the most common second person plural form. What we see here is not just the attachment of a ‘particle <lou>’ to the independent pronoun. In addition to the vowel <i>-/<y>-, already noted by de la Mata, other elements are involved. The interposed and postponed elements are in fact the verbal agent markers a- ‘1sA’, mi- ‘2sA’, i- ‘3sA’, ki- ‘1pA’, mi ... ha ‘2pA’, la ‘3pA’. The form to which they are attached, -low, looks like a transitive (3rd person singular object) preterite of the indicative of the verb -(o) ‘to do’, ‘to make’, ‘to say’ (l-o-w-ø ‘3sO-do/make-PST-NOM’). Cholón uses this construction to express pronominal possession, because it has no equivalents for the terms ‘mine’, ‘yours’, ‘his’, etc. Neither does it have a verb with the meaning ‘to possess’. Therefore, the concept of ‘to possess’ has to be rendered in a different way. Table 6.7 presents the

159

paradigm of the periphrastically constructed possessive pronouns in the revised spelling:

Table 6.7. Periphrastic possessive pronouns

singular 1 ok a-low 2 mi mi-low 3 sa i-low

plural ki-ha ki-low mi mi-low-ha …i-ha low-la

The second person singular form mi mi-low is obviously the masculine form. A second person singular feminine *pi pi-low does not occur in the ALC.

The use of a periphrastic possessive pronoun is shown in the following example:

(201)

ok a-low

õ-a-lyah-aõ (98)

1s 1sPOS-possession 3sA-1sO.APL-take.away-IA

‘He takes away what is mine’.

6.7. Demonstratives Cholón has four demonstratives: ko ‘(the one) here’, ‘this’; iõko ‘(the one) there’, ‘that’; pe ‘(the one) yonder’; and into-õko ‘that one there’. The deictics ko, iõko, pe can refer to an item or to a place. Deictic into-õko only refers to items. The demonstratives ko, iõko and into-õko are also used as relative pronouns with the meaning ‘this one who’, ‘that one who’ and ‘that one which/who/whom’,
respectively (for relative clauses, see chapter 10).

160

6.7.1. Demonstratives ko, iõko, pe In Cholón three degrees of distance are distinguished. The forms employed to designate persons and objects situated in a deictic space are:

ko ‘this (one)’, ‘here’
iõko ‘that (one)’, ‘there’ pe ‘that one yonder’, ‘yonder’22

These demonstratives are used attributively as well as independently. Attributive demonstratives are located before the noun.

(202)

ko putam-te-ke (2284) this village-AD-ANT ‘from this village’

(attributively used demonstrative)

(203)

ko ok a-low (1298) (independently used demonstrative) this 1s 1sPOS-possession ‘This is mine’.

Independent demonstratives usually occur with suffixes, such as a variety of case markers. When a demonstrative is followed by a locative case marker, it indicates a location (see also the examples in section 6.4.2):

(204)

ko-ke (2592) here-ANT ‘from here’

(205)

ko-te-ke (2589) here-AD-ANT ‘from here’

(206)

ko-te-p

pe-pat-le (2594)

here-AD-ABL yonder-INS-TERM

‘from here till yonder’

(207) (209)

ko-pi nom (2595) here-AL bit ‘a (little) bit nearby’
iõko-te (176) there-AD ‘there’

(208)

ko-te (175) here-AD ‘here’

(210)

pe-te (177) yonder-AD ‘yonder’

3 There is a striking resemblance with demonstratives in Tupi-Guaraní (e.g. Guaraní ko ‘this’ and pe ‘that’)

161

To form expressions of time, the demonstrative iõko is used in combination with the suffixes -(a)p (see iõko-p-aly ‘constantly’, section 6.4.2.1); -…ot ‘then’, ‘thus’; -na < ana ‘when’ (cf. the example iõko-na-pi ‘then’ and iõko-na-pi-ly ‘just at that very moment’ in section 6.4.5.1); and with the word nyalok which is only found together
with iõko in a few expressions (cf. iõko-tu-p nyalok ‘at that time’ in section 6.4.3.4):

(211)

iõko-…ot (2746) that-then ‘that then’

(212)

iõko-na-pi-p (2750) that-when-AL-ABL ‘from then’

(213)

iõko nyalok (2734) that time ‘that time’, ‘then’

(214)

iõko nyalok-te (2735) that time-AD ‘at that time’

(215)

iõko-tu-p nyalok-aly (2886) that-AD-ABL time-RST ‘at that time only’, ‘then immediately’

6.7.2. Demonstrative pronoun into-õko The pronoun into-õko (1645) ‘that one there’ is composed of two elements: the interrogative stem into ‘where’, ‘which’ and the pronominal suffix -õko ‘that one’. The latter must be a reduced form of the demonstrative pronoun iõko ‘the one
there’, ‘that one’, because they have the same form and the same meaning. The pronoun into-õko can be used independently, and be followed by the adessive case
marker -te ‘at’ and the indefinite determiner -pit ‘(wh ...)ever’:

(216)

into-õko-te-pit

ø-lya-khe (1345)

where/which-DEM-AD-IND 3sS-go-PERM

‘Let him go to no matter where, to no matter whom’.

(217)

into-õko-pit (1336) which-DEM-IND ‘whatever/whoever/whichever’

Before nouns, it can also be used as a modifier:

(218)

into-õko ø-tsip-te-m

ø-nye-kt-aõ (1343)

which-DEM 3sPOS-house-AD-QM 3sS-sleep-F-IA

‘In which of the houses will he sleep?’

Since the former element, into, is an interrogative stem (see section 6.8.3), the word into-õko can also function as an interrogative pronoun ‘which?’ (see section 6.8.4).

162

6.8. Question words Cholón has five stems which often appear in interrogative noun phrases and are normally followed by other elements, such as, case markers. These interrogative stems are ana ‘when’, ‘how many’; in…a ‘what’; into ‘where’, ‘which’; into-õko ‘which’; and ol ‘who’ (section 6.8.1 - 6.8.5, respectively). Through addition of case markers and the indefinite pronoun mek ‘all’, ana and into can express concepts of quantity, time, manner and space. Other concepts, such as cause, instrument and purpose, are expressed by means of the noun in…a in combination with case markers (see Conclusion, section 6.8.6).

6.8.1. Interrogative stem ana The stem ana (1721) ‘when’, ‘how many’ is often found in interrogative noun phrases with the question marker -(a)m. Only in one instance ana has been found as a question word in a clause without a question marker:

(219)

ana-pimok-nik

mi-tsip-a (1440)

how.many-CL:space-COM 2sPOS-house-TOP

‘As for your house, how many rooms [has it]?’

The interrogative stem ana always occurs with other elements: nouns, numeral
classifiers (see the example above), case markers or other suffixes. When ana is not followed by a suffix, it may have had an alternative form anak (possibly ana?)23:

(220)

anak

…aõ-am candela-wa (1433)

how.many bundle-QM candle-TOP

‘As for candles, how many bundles are there?’

The question marker -(a)m is attached to the elements that follow the stem:

(221)

ana-pat-le-m (2507) when-INS-TERM-QM ‘Until when?’

(222)

ana-tuh-am(1421) how.many-CL:detachable-QM ‘How many joints?’

Thus the concepts expressed by ana are those of time and quantity. The idea of time is expressed when ana is followed by (1) a noun designating a period of time, such as, mol ‘day’, pel ‘month’, piliw ‘year’:

24 It occurs as <annac> in Pedro de la Mata’s spelling, final <c> may be read as [§] or [k], see section 4.3.3.

163

(223)

ana

mol-pat-le-he-m

mi-lyw-aõ (2256)

how.many day-INS-TERM-BEN-QM 2sS-go.away-IA

‘For how many days will you go away?’

(224)

ana

pel-te-m (2265)

how.many month-AD-QM

‘After/In how many months?’

(225)

ana

piliw-te-m (2266)

how.many year-AD-QM

‘After/In how many years?’

(2) the following case markers: terminative -pat-le (see also section 6.4.3.2), allative -pi (cf. section 6.4.2.10), and adessive -te ‘at’, ‘in’:

(226)

ana-te-pit (2491) when-AD-IND ‘whenever’ (also: ‘in whatever quantity’)

The examples ana-pi-…in ‘I do not know when’, ana-pi-…o-m ‘when?’ and ana-pi-m mi-lya-kt-aõ ‘When will you go?’ in section 6.4.2.10, and the examples below give
evidence that the form ana-pi ‘when-AL’ refers to time in the future:

(227)

ana-pi-he-m (2876) when-AL-BEN-QM ‘For when?’

(238)

ana-pi-pit (2483) when-AL-IND ‘Whenever’.

(239)

ana-pi-m ko-te mi-toõ-t-aõ (2478) when-AL-QM here-AD 2sS-be-F-IA ‘When will you be here?’

The sequence ana-pi ‘when’ can be used as a suffix. It then occurs as -na-pi:

(230)

iõko-na-pi (2486) that-when-AL ‘then’, ‘when’

(231)

mi-kot-o-na-pi (2479) 2sS-be-FN2-when-AL ‘when you are’

The concept of quantity can be expressed when ana is followed by the case marker te, for instance in ana-te-pit ‘in whatever quantity’ above. It is particularly unambiguous when ana is followed by (1) the indefinite pronoun mek:

(232)

ana

6.8.2. Interrogative in…a The indefinite pronoun in…a ‘(some)thing’ can be employed as a question word to ask for things: ‘what (thing)?’. In this function it is generally followed by the question marker -(a)m although this is not necessary:

(248)

in…a-…ot (2866) what-then ‘What then?’

(249)

in…a-m ki-l-o-kt-aõ (2845) what-QM 1sA-3sO-do-F-IA ‘What shall we do?’

(250)

in…a-m Francisco liw i-s…-aõ (2850) what-QM Francisco book 3sA-3sO.see-IA ‘What does Francisco read?’

When interrogative in…a is followed by a case marker, the use of question marker -(a)m is necessary:

(251)

in…a-he-m (161) what-BEN-QM ‘Why?’

(252)

in…a-te-m (2902) what-AD-QM ‘What for?’

166

The question word in…a-m ‘what?’ may be followed by the interjection ah! ‘vocative’ and by the person markers ma ‘vocative 2s masculine’ and pa ‘vocative 2s feminine’:

(253)

in…a-m-ah (2719) what-QM-EX ‘What is the matter?’

(254)

in…a-m-ma (1352) what-QM-2smVO ‘What do you say, man?’. ‘What do you want, man?’

(255)

in…a-m-pa (1353) what-QM-2sfVO ‘What do you say, woman?’. ‘What do you want, woman?’

The noun which most frequently occurs after the question word in…a ‘what?’ is yu ‘kind’, ‘species’, ‘type’, ‘variety’:

(256)

in…a yu-am i-m-o-w (2727) thing kind-QM 3sA-2sO-do-PST ‘What did he do to you?’

(257)

in…a yu

caballu-m iõko-wa (1396)

thing species horse-QM the.one.there-TOP

‘As for the one there, what species of horse is it?’

In the following example, the noun in…a does not function as a question word, although it occurs in a clause with the disjunctive question marker -le ‘or?’. This is because the question does not concern the noun in…a ‘(some)thing’, but rather the verbal form ø-kot-p-aõ ‘he/she/it is not’:

(258)

in…a

ø-kot-p-aõ-le (2722)

something 3sS-be-NE-IA-QM

‘Isn’t there any news?’

6.8.3. Interrogative stem into The interrogative stem into refers to a location: ‘where’, ‘which location’, ‘which’; e.g.

(259) into? (2428) ‘What is the matter with him, where is he?’

Interrogative into can be followed by several elements, such as, case markers. No more than four suffixes were found attached to the stem into:

167

(260)

into-ny-a-he-m

mu-n-utsa-lyak-pat-le

a-šaiš-la-õo (2855)

which-CMP-?-BEN-QM 2sPOS-REL-fault-NF-INS-QM 1sO-whip-3pA-FN2

‘What? Through your fault, I am to be whipped by them?’

Elements which can appear after into are perlative -nayme ‘through’, ‘via’ and nonpersonal adessive -te ‘at’, ‘in’ + the combinations -te-ke ‘from’, -te-p ‘from’ and -tepi ‘to’:

(261)

into-nayme-m (2431) where-PRO-QM ‘Through where?’

(262)

into-te-m (2467) where-AD-QM ‘Where?’

(263)

into-te (2430) where-AD ‘in there’

(264)

into-te-ke-pit (2537) where-AD-ANT-IND ‘from anywhere’

(265) (267)

into-te-p-am

mi-n-aõ (2438)

where-AD-ABL-QM 2sS-come-IA

‘Where do you come from?’

(266)

into-te-pi-m

mi-lyw-aõ (2447) (268)

where-AD-AL-QM 2sS-go-IA

‘Where do you go to?’

into-te-p (22429) where-AD-ABL ‘from there’
into-te-pi (2432) where-AD-AL ‘to there’

However, the elements most frequently encountered after interrogative into are the indefinite pronoun mek ‘all’, the comparative case marker -ny ‘like’, and the demonstra-tive/relativizer -õko (see section 6.7.2). With the indefinite pronoun mek
the concept of ‘quantity’ is expressed. E.g.:

(269)

into mek-am (1364) which all-QM ‘how much?’

(270)

into mek (1427) which all ‘so much’, ‘that much’

(271)

into mek-nik (2518) which all-COM ‘so much more’

cf.

into mek ni-…u-nik (1380)

which all bit-DIM-COM

‘the more’

(272)

into mek-pit (1379) which all-IND ‘no matter how many/much’

(273)

into mek-pok (2514) which all-CL:repeatable ‘that many times’

(274)

into mek-te nom (1377) which all-AD bit ‘so much less’

168

(275)

into mek m-a-y-aõ,

into mek-aly a-m-e-kt-aõ (2521)

which all 2sA-1sO-give-IA which all-RST 1sA-2sO-give-F-IA

‘As much as you give me, that much I shall give you’.

The concept of manner is expressed by the suffix -ny . The derived form into-ny means ‘how’:

(276)

into-ny-am (2907) which-CMP-QM ‘How?’

(277)

into-ny-am

me-kt-aõ/ into-ny-am

mi-ki-aõ (2540)

which-CMP-QM 2sS-be-IA/ which-CMP-QM 2sS-be-IA

‘How do you do?’

(278)

into-ny-am

i-m-o-w (2524)

which-CMP-QM 3sA-2sO-do-PST

‘What did he do to you?’

(279)

into-ny ki-l-o-pakna

ø-kot-aõ (390)

which-CMP 1pA-3sO-do-NE.NOM 3sS-be-IA

‘We can not do anything’.

(280)

into-ny-ap-am (1383) which-CMP-ABL-QM ‘Of which size?’

(281)

into-ny-pit-hin-ah (2463) which-CMP-IND-maybe-EX ‘I do not know anything!’

(282)

into-ny-…in (2531) where/which-CMP-NE ‘I do not know how’. ‘I do not know where’.

Time can be expressed when into-ny is followed by the suffix -…o ‘already’:

(283)

into-ny-…o-m

ø-pakt-aõ (2541)

which-CMP-already-QM 3sS-be-IA

‘What time is it?’

The instance into-ny ki-l-o-pakna ø-kot-aõ above shows that the concept of ‘nothing’ can be expressed by means of a negative verb form (cf. in…a, section 6.8.3 and ol, section 6.8.5).

169

6.8.4. Interrogative demonstrative pronoun into-õko Interrogative into-õko(-m) ‘which?’ refers both to humans and non-humans, whereas its counterpart, the interrogative pronoun ol ‘who?’ (see section 6.8.5), only refers to humans. Like the counterpart ol ‘who?’, interrogative into-õko(-m) can be followed by the plural marker lol when it is used to ask for people:

(284)

into-õko(-m) (1342) which-DEM(-QM) ‘Which?’

(285) into-õko(-m) ø-lya-kt-aõ (1343) which-DEM(-QM) 3sS-go-F-IA ‘Which one will go?’

(286)

into-õko-lol-am (1360) which-DEM-PL-QM ‘Which persons?’.

6.8.5. Interrogative pronoun ol The stem ol ‘who’ primarily functions as an interrogative pronoun, and it can be followed by the question marker -(a)m:

(287)

ol(-am) (1339) who(-QM) ‘Who?’

(288)

ol(-am) mi-ps-aõ (1340) who-QM 2sS-come-IA ‘Who is coming?’

(289)

ol i-l-o-w-ø(-am) (1289) who 3sA-3sO-make-PST-NOM(-QM) ‘Whose?’

(290)

ol i-l-o-w-ø-am

ko-wa (96)

who 3sA-3sO-make-PST-NOM-QM this-TOP

‘To whom does this belong?’

To indicate plural the interrogative pronoun ol is followed by the plural marker -lol:

(291) (292)

ol-lol-am (1359) who-PL-QM ‘Who?’, ‘Which persons?’

a-paõ-a

ol-am a-šot-a

ol-lol-am

1sPOS-mother-TOP who-QM 1sPOS-brother-TOP who-PL-QM

…e-kt-aõ (1351)

3pS-be-IA

‘Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?’.

The concept of ‘nobody’ is obtained by adding a negation marker (cf. into, section 6.8.3 and in…a, section 6.8.3). This suffix is attached to a verb of which ol

170

‘somebody’ is the subject (a negative verb form of which ol is the object has not been found):

(293)

mi-pot-iy-man-ap, ol-pit ø-moh-p-aõ (203) 2sS-come-PST-INES-ABL who-IND 3sS-come.up-NE-IA ‘After you came, nobody has come up’.

6.8.6. Conclusion The words ana, in…a, into, into-õko, ol belong together insofar that all five can be used as interrogatives. However, the interrogative stem ana is normally followed by -(a)m when used in questions. It has only once been encountered without a question marker while functioning as an interrogative. The stems ana and into have some points in common: (i), both stand apart in that the presence of one or more additional elements is required (ana is normally followed by nouns, by the indefinite pronoun mek ‘all’, by numeral classifiers, or by case markers; into is followed by the indefinite pronoun mek ‘all’, or by case markers); (ii), they can not directly be followed by the discourse markers -(a)m ‘question marker’, -…in ‘I don’t know’ and the indefinite marker -pit ‘(wh ...)ever’, which, on the other hand, can directly be attached to in…a, into-õko and ol without the interposition of another element. In the case of ana and into, the question marker (a)m occurs after one of the elements mentioned in point (i); the discourse marker …in and the indefinite marker -pit occur after some case markers (see the examples ana-pi-…in, ana-pi-pit, ana-te-pit, into-te-ke-pit, into-ny-…in in section 6.8.1for ana and 6.8.3 for into).
The group ana, in…a, into, into-õko, ol can thus be divided into two parts: bound and free. The bound stems ana and into on the one hand, and the free stems in…a, into-õko and ol on the other. In some points, however, the words ana and into differ from each other: (1) into may be used as a question word without the occurrence of the question marker -(a)m, which is rarely the case with ana; (2) ana refers to human beings as well as to objects, whereas into refers to places and objects. As far as the reference to human beings and objects of the words in…a, into-õko and ol is concerned, in…a only refers to objects, into-õko both to persons and objects, and ol only to persons. The difference in reference to humans and non-humans is shown in Table 6.8.

non-humans + + + + -

As for the concepts ‘quantity’, ‘time’, ‘manner’, ‘space’, ‘cause’, ‘instrument’, ‘purpose’, we have seen that they can be expressed by the words ana, into and in…a by adding certain elements. The idea of quantity can be expressed by ana, in…a and into; the idea of time can be indicated by ana and into; the concept of space by into and into-nko (see the example into-õko-te-pit ‘no matter where’ in section 6.8.2); the concept of manner by into; and the notions of cause, instrument and purpose by in…a. Those concepts are indicated by means of the following elements: (a) ‘quantity’ by means of the element mek ‘all’ (ana mek, into mek), of nouns (ana
+several nouns), and of numeral classifiers (ana + several numeral classifiers);
(b) ‘time’ by means of nouns (ana + nouns indicating a period of time); of case markers (ana + -patle ‘until’, -pi ‘to’, -te ‘at’, ‘in’; and of the suffix -…o ‘already’ (intony-…o ‘what time’); (c) ‘manner’ by means of the suffix -ny ‘like’; (d) ‘space’ by means of the suffixes -nayme ‘through’, ‘via’ and -ny ‘like’; or of
spatialcase markers: -te ‘at’, ‘in’, -te-ke ‘from’, ‘of’, -te-pi ‘to’, -te-p ‘from’;
(e) ‘cause’, ‘instrument’ and ‘purpose’ by means of the case markers -he ‘for the benefit of’, ‘by’, -pat/-lyak-pat ‘with’, and -te ‘to’, respectively. The fact that ana, in…a, into, into-õko refer to different concepts as different elements are added to them, distinguishes them from ol. The word ol is an
independent pronoun and refers to a third person singular or plural. The group ana, in…a, into, into-õko, ol may thus again be split up into two parts: the words ana, in…a, into, into-õko referring to variable concepts against the pronoun ol referring exclusively to a ‘3s/p’.
Table 6.9 presents an overview of the above mentioned concepts expressed by ana, in…a, into, into-õko by mediation of added elements. The elements shown are the indefinite pronoun mek ‘all’, nouns (N), numeral classifiers (CL), case markers, and the suffix sequence -ny-…o (comparative ‘like’ + adverbial ‘already’).

6.9. Indefinite pronouns Cholón has the following indefinite pronouns:

alum an-tsel in…a
mek nyanmak
ol

‘other’, ‘some’ ‘one’, ‘another’ ‘(some)thing’ ‘all’ ‘each’ ‘who’

6.9.1. Indefinite pronoun alum The indefinite pronoun, alum, is used attributively:

(294)

quaresma alum nem-te-wa, [...] ay…a ø-lyup-la-pakna

Lent

other day-AD-TOP [...] meat 3sO-eat-3pA-NE.NOM

ø-kot-aõ (2793)

3sS-be-IA

‘As for the other days of Lent, [...] they are not allowed to eat meat’.

(295)

alum nem-te-a-…o,

eytsa ø-lyup-la-õo …e-kt-aõ (2794)

other day-AD-TOP-now meat 3sO-eat-3pA-FN2 3pS-be-IA

‘Now, as for the other days, they may eat meat’.

6.9.2. Indefinite pronoun an-tsel The word an-tsel primarily functions as a numeral ‘one’. It is composed of the following morphemes: the numeral an ‘one’ and the numeral classifier tsel ‘truncal object’ (for examples with numeral classifiers, see section 6.10.2). When an-tsel

173

functions as an indefinite pronoun, it is used independently, viz. not followed by a countable noun:

(296)

an-tsel-sim (1310) one-CL:truncal-EMP ‘It is another one’.

(297)

an-tsel

a-tsap-te-na

sepeh-he-nake, an-tsel

one-CL:truncal 1sA-3sO.catch-F-QUOT say-SIM-PER i-tsp-aõ (2387)

one-CL:truncal

3sA-3sO.catch-IA

‘Instead of catching one, he catches another one’.

(lit. ‘By saying: “I shall catch one”, he catches another one’).

6.9.3. Indefinite pronoun in…a The indefinite pronoun in…a ‘(some)thing’ is used for objects (cf. the pronoun ol ‘who’, which is used for persons). The indefinite pronoun in…a also functions as an interrogative stem (see section 6.8.2). When it does not function as an interrogative stem, it is often preceded by the indefinite pronoun mek ‘all’, indicating a ‘whole’ or a ‘plurality of things’:

(298)

mek in…a (1355) all thing ‘everything’, ‘the whole thing’, ‘all the things’

(299)

mek in…a Dios kamatsin ø-ki-aõ-ko (1866) all thing God command 3sS-speak-IA-DEM ‘God who commands everything’.

(300)

mek in…a …i-po-hina-y-e-ø-te (1473) all thing 3pA-3pO-hear-PST-ANT-NOM-AD ‘after/from all the things they had heard’

Plurality of things is also expressed by the reduplication of in…a. In addition, the reduplicated pronoun may be preceded by the indefinite pronoun mek, and it may be followed by the noun yu ‘kind’, ‘species’:

(301)

in…a in…a mi-po-y…-iy-ha-õ-ko (1471) thing thing 2A-3pO-see-SE-PL-IA-DEM ‘all the things you see’

(302)

mek in…a in…a (1361) all thing thing ‘all the things’

(303)

mek in…a in…a yu (1363) all thing thing kind ‘all kinds of things’

174

The following suffixes have been encountered after in…a: comitative -nik ‘with’, adessive -te ‘in’ (see the example in…a-te-pit mu… ‘Put it in something whatsoever!’ in section 6.4.5.5), and allative -pi ‘to’ when suffixed to -te:

(304)

ma-ma-ta

in…a-nik ø-kot-aõ (2697)

INT-INT-CL:firm/stony thing-COM 3sS-be-IA

‘He is rich, abundant in everything’.

(305)

in…a-te-pi ø-šoh-ø (3398)/ in…a-te-pi mi-ø-šoh-i (2736) thing-AD-AL 3sO-pour-IMP thing-AD-AL 2sA-3sO-pour-IMP ‘Pour it into something!’

The indefinite pronoun in…a can also be followed by the diminutive marker -…u. The form in…a-…u can be reduced to in…u ‘minimal thing’:

(306)

in…a-…u (1356) thing-DIM ‘something small’

(307) mek in…u

in…u-pit (1362)

all thing.DIM thing.DIM-IND

‘all possible minimal things’

The concept of ‘nothing’ is expressed by means of the word ma ‘nothing’ or by means of a negative verb form (cf. into, section 6.8.3 and ol, section 6.8.5):

(308) (310)

in…a(-…u)-pit ma (1351) thing(-DIM)-IND not ‘I have nothing’.

(309)

in…a a-sina-y-pits-o (2725) thing 1sA-3sO.hear-PST-NE-FN2 ‘I heard nothing’.

in…a ø-kot-p-aõ (2723) thing 3sS-be-NE-IA ‘There is nothing’. ‘Nothing matters’. ‘It doesn’t matter’.

6.9.4. Indefinite pronoun mek The indefinite pronoun mek ‘all’ can be employed both as a head and as a modifier. In the following examples the pronoun mek is used independently:

(311) (312)

mek mi-kol-ha-kt-aõ (49) all 2S-die-PL-F-IA ‘You (p) all will die’.
Dios neõ-te mek ke-tõ-aõ (2440) God hand-AD all 1pS-be-IA ‘We all are in the hands of God’.

175

The word mek can also appear after an attributive pronoun or demonstrative. Its function as a head is shown in the following examples:

(313)

mi ok mek me-kt-aõ (1373) 2s 1s all 2sS-be-IA ‘You are of my size’.

(314)

ko

mek (1368)

this.one.here all

‘all the ones here’

(316)

pe

mek (1368)

yonder all

‘all the ones yonder’

(315) (317)

iõko

mek (1368)

that.one.there all

‘all the ones there’

ko

mek-aly (2603)

this.one.here all-RST

‘all the ones here only’/’this is

all’

When mek is used as a modifier, it can occur before or after a noun:

(318)

mek angel-a/angel mek-a espiritu-ly …e-kt-aõ (2975) all angel-TOP/angel all-TOP spirit-RST 3pS-be-IA ‘As for all the angels, they are spirits only’.

6.9.5. Indefinite pronoun nyanmak The indefinite pronoun nyanmak is the opposite of mek: mek ‘all’ pluralizes, whereas nyanmak ‘each’, ‘every(one)’ individualizes. It is mainly employed attributively, and
it can occur before or after a noun:

(319)

nem nyanmak ki-am-aõ (1186) day every 1pS-eat-IA ‘We eat every day’.

(320)

nyanmak hayu

i-tsip-te

i-tsots

every Indian/man 3pPOS-house-AD 3pPOS-guinea.pig

ø-p-a-ha-kot-aõ (1187)

3sS-3pO-APL-PL-be.there-IA

‘Every Indian has guinea pigs in his house’.

When the noun with which nyanmak appears indicates a period of time, nyanmak occurs after this noun (see also the example nem nyanmak ‘every day’ above):

(321)

maha… nyanmak (2459) evening every ‘every evening’

(322)

semana nyanmak (2460) week every ‘every week’

176

(323)

pel nyanmak (2461) month every ‘every month’

In one example nyanmak is not used attributively. In this instance, the indefinite pronoun is preceded by a third person plural marker and followed by the distributive marker -(k)o:

(324)

i-nyanmak-o an-tsel

palantu mi-po-e-ki (1454)

3pPOS-each-DIS one-CL:truncal banana 2sA-3pO-give-IMP

‘Give one banana to each one of them!’

6.9.6. Indefinite pronoun ol The pronoun ol which is mainly used as an interrogative pronoun (see section 6.8.5) can also function as the indefinite pronoun ‘somebody/someone’, ‘who’:

(325)

ol-pit (1337) who-IND ‘whoever’, ‘anyone’, ‘everybody’

6.10. Numerals and classifiers Pedro de la Mata distinguished cardinal numbers, ordinal numbers and distributive numbers. The numbers ‘one’, ‘two’, ‘three’ always occur with classifiers; the numbers ‘four’ - ‘nine’ also appear with classifiers, but for one exception, viz. when they quantify human beings. The cardinal, ordinal and distributive numbers are treated in section 6.10.1; the classifiers in section 6.10.2.

177

6.10.1. Cardinal, ordinal and distributive numbers
The cardinal numbers ‘one’, ‘two’ and ‘three’ are indicated by the morphemes a(C), ip-, i…-/iš-/is-, respectively (i…- is found before classifiers whith an initial t, …, š, l; iš-before classifiers which begin with h or p; is- alternates with iš- before the
classifier ta ‘firm/stony object’, see also section 4.3.4 and 4.3.9). These morphemes
never appear independently; they are always followed by a classifier. The numeral a- ‘one’ occurs as an- in the word an-tsel ‘one man’ (< one-CL:truncal object) and an-…up ‘one book/cloth/knife (< one-CL: portable object); and as at- in the words at…e ‘one egg’ (< one-CL:round object), at-hil ‘one word’ (< one-CL:speech), at-kotmuly-aõ-ko ‘first’ (one-be-begin-IA-which), and at-waranga ‘one thousand’. The Cholón words for the numerals four - nine are as follows:

minyip
kiok iptsok

‘four’ ‘five’ ‘six’

kiliš
pak okony

‘seven’
‘eight’ ‘nine’24

These numerals are likewise followed by classifiers, except when indicating human beings. The concept of ‘ten(s)’ is indicated by the morpheme -lek. This morpheme is suffixed to the units. E.g.:

(326) (327) (328)

ip-lek (1110)
iš-lek (1111) minyip-lek (1112)

‘twenty’ ‘thirty’ ‘forty’

To express intervening numbers tens are followed by units:

(329)

a-lek an-tsel (1120) one-ten one-CL:truncal ‘eleven men’

(330)

a-lek ip-ta (1121) one-ten two-CL:firm/ stony ‘twelve men’

(331)

a-lek minyip (1119) one-ten four ‘fourteen men’

The intervening numbers can also be formed by means of the suffix -nik ‘with’ attached to the units:

(332)

a-lek iptsok-nik (1123) one-ten six-COM ‘sixteen’

25 The Cholón numerals for 6 to 9 are reminiscent of the respective Ayacucho Quechua numerals: iptsok ‘six’, A. Que. soqta; kiliš’seven’, A.Que. qan…is; pak ‘eight’, A. Que. pusaq; okony ‘eight’, A. Que. isqon.

178

The Cholón expressions for ‘one hundred’ and ‘one thousand’ are a-pi…ak and at-waranga, respectively25.
Ordinal numbers are formed by the interposition of the form ø-kot-muly-aõ-ko
‘the one here who/which is beginning’ between the numeral and the classifier. The form ø-kot-muly-aõ-ko contains two verb stems: kot ‘be’ and muly ‘start an action’ followed by imperfective aspect -aõ and the demonstrative/relativizer ko:

(333)

at-kot-muly-aõ-ko hil (1127) one-be-begin-IA-DEM word ‘the first command’

The interposition of the form ø-kot-muly-aõ-ko can be omitted. When this is the case, ordinal numbers are equal to cardinal numbers as regards their form:

(334)

at-hil (1126) one-CL:speech ‘one word’

(335)

at-hil

sil-aõ (1131)

one-CL:speech 3sO.say-IA

‘the first command’

It appears that numerals (followed by suffixed classifiers) are used as cardinal numbers and function as a determiner when they occur before a noun:

(336)

iš-ta

hayu atem-e

…i-paly-iy (1314)

three-CL:firm/stony man morning-ANT 3pS-pass-PST

‘Three men passed in the morning’.

They are used as ordinal numbers and function as an argument when they occur before a verb (see also the example at-hil ø-sil-aõ ‘the first command above):

(337)

i…-hil

ø-sil-aõ (1129)

three-CL:speech 3sS.say-IA

‘the third command’

The ordinal number ‘first’ may also be formed by means of the adverb ašman ‘before’, ‘first’, ‘rather’ + ø-kot-muly-aõ-ko ‘the one here who/which is beginning’:

(338)

ašman ø-kot-muly-aõ-ko (1127) first 3sS-be-begin-IA-DEM ‘the one who/which is first’, ‘the first one’

26 They are borrowings from Quechua pa…ak ‘hundred’ and waranqa ‘thousand’.

179

Distributive numbers are usually formed by means of reduplication of the numeral and the suffix -(k)o, attached to each reduplicated element. The form -o is found after a consonant, -ko after a vowel. The numeral ‘one’ occurs as il or yel when it is employed as a distributive. In this case, the numeral is not followed by a classifier and neither are the numerals ‘four’ and higher. They are immediately followed by the suffix -(k)o. The classifier which is suffixed to the numerals ‘two’ and ‘three’ when they are used as distributives is the classifier ta ‘firm/stony object’:

il-o, yel-o yel-o
ip-ta-ko ip-ta-ko
iš-ta-ko iš-ta-ko minyip-o minyip-o
kiok-o kiok-o iptsok-o iptsok-o
kiliš-o kiliš-o
pak-o pak-o okony-o okony-o
a-lek-o a-lek-o a-lek an-tsel-o a-lek an-tsel-o

‘one by one’, ‘in ones’ ‘two by two’, ‘in twos’ ‘three by three’, ‘in threes’ ‘four by four’, ‘in fours’ ‘five by five’, ‘in fives’ ‘six by six’, ‘in sixes’ ‘seven by seven’, ‘in sevens’ ‘eight by eight’, ‘in eights’ ‘nine by nine’, ‘in nines’ ‘ten by ten’, ‘in tens’ ‘eleven by eleven’, ‘in elevens’

6.10.2. Numeral classifiers Cholón has morphemes which can be suffixed to numerals (see 6.10.1) and to the interrogative stem ana (see section 6.8.1). These morphemes indicate a characteristic or property of the items quantified by the numeral or the interrogative stem, assigning the quantified items to different classes. This classification takes place on the basis of the shape or the property of the items involved (bundled, round, portable, etc.). According to Pedro de la Mata everything has to be classified when counted, so that Cholón has a multitude of such numeral classifiers. He gives fifteen paradigms to illustrate the use of classifiers with numerals. He also mentions the type of objects for which each classifier is used. The following paradigm is employed to count human beings:

an-tsel
ip-ta
iš-ta minyip

‘one man’ ‘two men’ ‘three men’ ‘four men’, etc.

The suffix tsel ‘truncal object’ is employed for the classification of one man, ta ‘firm/stony object’ is used for the classification of two and three men. No classifier intervenes when more than three men are counted. The classifiers appearing in the other paradigms + the items thus classified are shown in Table 6.10. The table furthermore presents the classes to which the objects are assigned.

180

Table 6.10. The numeral classifiers and the corresponding items mentioned by Pedro de la Mata, together with the classes indicated by the classifiers (objects which do not occur in the paradigms, but which are mentioned elsewhere in the ALC are in parentheses)

classes accumulations firm/stony objects (small) pieces detachable objects truncal objects

Spaces of time may also function as classifiers, although De la Mata does not label them as such. They are namely found after the numbers ‘one’, ‘two’ and ‘three’, which are not used independently, but are always accompanied by a classifier. The following words, indicating a space of time, are encountered after these numbers: mita ‘season’, mol ‘solar day’, nem ‘day’, pel ‘lunar month’, piliw ‘solar year’, and semana (< Sp semana) ‘week’:

(339)

at-mita (2558) one-CL:season ‘one season’

(340)

poho-pat at-mol-e (2261) morning-INS one-CL:day-ANT ‘the day after tomorrow’

(341)

ko-te-p

ip-nem-te (2569)

here-AD-ABL two-CL:day-AD

‘two days from now’

181

(342)

i…-pel-pat-le (2263) three-CL:month-INS-TERM ‘in/for three months’

(343)

a-piliw-pat-le (2995) one-CL:year-INS-TERM ‘in/for one year’

(344)

ip-semana-pat-le (2257) two-CL:week-INS-TERM in/for two weeks’

The use of a classifier depends on the angle from which the object is looked at, viz. on the property which is singled out. A dress, for example, may be considered as something portable, as something colourful or as something which contains air or space, depending on whether the speaker wants to accentuate the fact that the dress is something which can be worn, or whether it is the multicolouredness or the spaciousness of the garment which catches the eye of the speaker. In the first case the dress is classified into the category ‘portable things’ by the classifier …up, in the second case it is classified into the category ‘colourful things’ by the classifier liw, in the third case it is classified into the category ‘space’ by the classifier pimok:

(345)

ana-…up-am

me-n-eštek

ø-m-a-toõ (1415)

how.many-CL:portable-QM 2sPOS-REL-cloth 3sS-2sO-APL-be.there

‘How many dresses do you have?’

(346) (347)

ana-liw-am

me-n-eštek-a (1423)

how.many-CL:multiform-QM 2sPOS-REL-cloth-TOP

‘As for your dress, how many colours [does it have]?’

ana-pimok-am

me-n-eštek

me-mel-aõ (1439)

how.many-CL:space-QM 2sPOS-REL-cloth 2sA-3sO.see-IA

‘How many skirts do you see?’

The above-mentioned lexemes which function as numeral classifiers also occur as independent nouns. For instance, the lexemes …e, hil, liw, tsel, šuõ, ta also appear as nouns, in which case …e means ‘egg’, ‘grain’; hil means ‘word’; liw means ‘book’, ‘letter(s)’, ‘species’; šuõ means ‘heap’; ta means ‘stone’; tsel means ‘leg’, ‘foot’. We may assume that more lexemes, besides those mentioned in Table 6.10,
functioned both as a noun and as a numeral classifier. The more so since de la Mata
remarks that Cholón had many more of such class-indicating words, and that each
item, no matter which, had to be classified when counted.

182

6.11. Derived nouns Nouns can be derived from verb stems. First, a non-reduced (see section 7.3.1) verb stem (with an alternated stem initial consonant indicating a third person singular object) may function as a noun, referring to the event or its object:

kole/koly ‘(to) love’
k(o)t ‘(to) be’ peny(o) ‘(to) wish’
ših/š(i)k ‘(to) drink’

> õole (1061) ‘love’ > kot (1044) ‘being’, ‘essence’ > meny (1057) ‘wish’
> ših (1067) ‘drink’

Second, nouns may be formed by means of a verb stem and one of the following suffixes: 1, the suffixes -(w)u… ‘agentive’ and -(e)… ‘complementizer’; 2, the nominalizers -lam ‘future participle’ and -(õ)o ‘gerundive’. The former, those ending in -(w)u… and -(e)…, indicate a human being, viz. ‘the one who’. According to Pedro de la Mata, nouns in -(w)u… are derived from a ‘present participle’ in -(w)u…,
which he translates as a rela-tive clause:

kot-u… (432) ‘he/she who is’ > ‘a being’
õole-u… (749) ‘he/she who loves somebody/something’ > ‘a lover’ penyo-wu… (861) ‘he/she who wants’ > ‘a lover’

In the ALC, in only one sentence a form in -(w)u… is translated as a relative clause. In the other examples in which a form in -(w)u… occurs, this form is translated as a noun. The suffix -(w)u… occurs after non-reduced stems: -u… postconsonantally as well as postvocalically, -wu… only postvocalically. Examples:

a-kole-(w)u… (1062) mi-kole-u… (1063) kot-u… (1046) ašwa lamih-u… (1490) lyiteh-u… (1072) ay…a lyup-u… (1148) lusay-e-u… (1150)
palyow a-o-wu… (1779) kamatsin ki-wu… (1070) a-penyo-wu… (1064) mi-penyo-wu… (1065) pihih-u… (1158)
a-psawoh-u… (1776) ših-u… (1068)

‘my lover’ ‘your lover’ ‘a being’ ‘killer of fish’ ‘magistrate’ ‘eater of meat’ ‘mercyful or pious man’
‘my benefactor’ ‘ruler’ ‘my lover’ ‘your lover’ ‘tailor’ (?), ‘someone
‘my creator’ ‘drinker’

< kole/koly ‘(to) love’ < kole/koly ‘(to) love’ < k(o)t ‘(to) be’ < lam(a) ‘(to) kill’ < lyite(h) ‘(to) correct’ < lyup ‘(to) swallow down’ < lusa(y) ‘(to) pity’, ‘(to) have compassion’, ‘(to) be in distress’ < (o) ‘(to) do’, ‘(to) make’ < kamatsin ki ‘(to) rule’ < peny(o) ‘(to) want’
< *pihi(h) ‘(to) sew’ (?), ‘(to) be charged with a duty’ (?)charged with’ (?) < *psa(wo)h ‘(to) create’ < ših/š(i)k ‘(to) drink’

183

ki-šp-eh-u… (1187) ‘our Redeemer’ ašwa tsap-u… (1152) ‘catcher of fish’,

‘fisherman’

tup-u… (1151)

‘walker’

utsa-u… (1908)

‘sinner’

a-n-utsa-weh-u… (1181) ‘my judge’

ki-ym-eh-u… (1186) ‘our creator’

p-a-ym-eh-u… (421) ‘teacher’

< šp-e(h) ‘(to) liberate’ < y(a)p ‘(to) catch’
< t(u)p ‘(to) walk’ < utsa ‘a sin’ < utsa-we(h) ‘(to) judge’ < yam-e(h) ‘(to) let know’ < y(a)m-e(h) ‘(to) let know’, ‘(to) teach’

Forms in -(e)… are normally translated as present participles or subordinate clauses. Only one form in -(e)… is used as a noun:

tsamo-… (2974)

‘wisdom’

< tsam(o) ‘(to) know something’

The word tsamo-… can also be used as an adjective with the meaning ‘learned’ (39, 111). Another form in -(e)…, also derived from a verb stem in o, which is also translated as an adjective is the word

nyansik-wo-… (1041) ‘laborious’

< nyansik-w(o) ‘(to) work’

The nominalizer -lam, a future ‘participle’ ending, is suffixed to a non-reduced stem. It indicates that something has to be done or is going to happen. When -lam occurs in a nominal form, it can be translated as ‘future’:

(348)

kot-lam (1053) be-FN1 ‘(the fact of) being’, ‘future being’

(349)

a-kulyha a-kot-lam (1051) 1sPOS-life 1sS-be-FN1 ‘my existence’, ‘the future being of my life’

(350)

menyo-lam (1057) 3sO.want-FN1 ‘someone’s wish’, ‘someone’s future wishing’

(351)

õole-lam (1061) 3sO.love-FN1 ‘someone’s love’, ‘someone’s future loving’

(352)

a-ø-ših-lam (1067) 1sA-3sO-drink-FN1 ‘my drink’, ‘my future drinking’

The nominalizer -(õ)o is in fact a gerundive ending. It is also suffixed to a nonreduced stem and it indicates that something has to be done or can possibly be done. A nominalized form in -(õ)o can function both as an adjective (cf. forms in -(k)o in section 6.4.5.4) and as a noun, although it is more often encountered as an adjective. In such forms, the agent is always first person plural:

184

(353) (354) (355)

ki-ø-…ikno-õo (1076) 1pA-3sO-fear-FN2 ‘frightening’, ‘something frightening’
ku-ø-puluwo-õo (1074) 1pA-3sO-disgust-FN2 ‘abominable’, ‘something abominable’
ki-tsa…-o (1078) 1pA-3sO.see-FN2 ‘visible’, ‘something visible’

6.12. Nominal constructions In this section we will deal with the genitive construction (section 6.12.1); attributive or adjectival use of nouns (section 6.12.2); comparative constructions (section 6.12.3); and lexical gender and number assignment in section 6.12.4 and 6.12.5, respectively.

6.12.1. Genitive constructions In the sections 6.4.2.1 and 6.4.1 we have seen that a possessive relation can be expressed by means of the suffixes: -(a)p and -(te)-(k)e, respectively. For instance:

ablative -(a)p: nominal past -(k)e:

ow-tu-p (2588) ampal-e (2551) Lima-te-ke (2279) ta-ke (22769)

‘from afar’ ‘yesterday’s’ ‘from Lima’ ‘made of stone’

However, the more common method to express a possessive relation between two nouns is by juxtaposition. In that case the possessed head noun occupies the final position in the possessive phrase, takes its relational form (if any) and possessive personal reference markers (when possible).
Juxtaposition is used when the possessor is not pronominal. The possessor can be singular or plural. A possessive third person singular can not be overtly marked, but it can be inferred from the fact that the modified noun (for so far as it differs from the absolute form) takes its relational form, see section 5.5. Ex.:

(356)

šokot ø-lol (34) river 3sPOS-mouth ‘the river mouth’

(357) Pedro ø-n-eštek (150) Pedro 3sPOS-REL-cloth ‘Pedro’s cloth(es)’

185

(358)

Dios tsamo-…

ø-kot (2974)

Dios 3sS.know-FAC 3sPOS-being

‘God’s wisdom’

If the possessor is plural, the possessive relation is expressed by the possessive third person markers i- (or the copy vowels e- and u-) and …i- (or …u-) preceding the head noun in its relational form (cf. section 5.4):

(359)

hayu

i-tsip (1187) (tsip < yip ‘house’)

man/Indian 3pPOS-house

‘the houses of the Indians’

(360)

Luis-e Maria-ke …u-pul (2285) Luis-ANT María-ANT 3pPOS-child ‘the child(ren) of late Luis and María’

6.12.2. Adjectival use of nouns
It appears that Cholón has no separate class of adjectives, or as Pedro de la Mata stated: "[...] strictly speaking, there are no adjectives in this language"26. However,
we have seen that attributive expressions can be formed by means of the suffixes nik (section 6.4.2.8), -(k)o (section 6.4.5.4), -(e)… (section 6.10), and -(õ)o (section 6.10):

comitative -nik: šeš-nik (1043)
adjectivizer -(k)o: nun-o (235)
ila-ko (236) factivizer -(e)… tsamo-… (405) nominalizer -(õ)o ki-tsa…-o (1178)

‘scabby’ ‘male’ ‘female’ ‘learned’ ‘visible’

A nominalized form in -lam can be used to form an attributive:

(361)

mula lum-te ku-tup-lam pana (2316) mule top-AD 1pS-walk-FN2 road ‘a mulepath’.

In addition, instead of adjectives, Cholón employs nouns designating a quality or a property to modify another noun (see also the nouns ila ‘woman’ and nun ‘man’ in section 6.12.4). Such nouns are juxtaposed to the noun to be modified. To this category belong primarily those nouns denoting dimension (large : small), colour (light, white : dark, black), age (new : old) and value (good : bad). In a number of languages these words are adjectives that form a closed adjective class (see

27 “[...] en rigor de adjetivo no tiene ninguno esta lengua [...]” (fol. 88)

186

Schachter, 1985: 14-15, referring to Dixon 1977 and Welmers & Welmers 1969). In Cholón, the following nouns indicating dimension, colour, age and value can be mentioned, including also taste as a category:

dimension: o…o (1235)

kun…u (1254)

mos…u (1263)

colour: …e… (1389, 2621)

kisna (1846) lyaka (1400) lyin (2980) puly (1401) (tsi)tsal (1399)

age:

kes (1630)

value:

išiwah (1037) õunya (1032) palyow (405)

taste:

waliw (1031) alyhi (1033)

‘something large’, ‘large’ ‘something small’, ‘small’ ‘tinyness’, ‘tiny’ ‘clarity’, ‘whiteness’, ‘white’ ‘blueness’, ‘blue’ ‘something coloured’, ‘redness’, ‘red’ ‘greenness’, ‘green’ ‘yellowness’, ‘yellow’ ‘blackness’, ‘black’ ‘matureness’, ‘oldness’, ‘old’ ‘badness’, ‘bad’ ‘softness’, ‘nice’ ‘goodness’, ‘good’ ‘strength’, ‘something beautiful’, ‘beautiful’ ‘sweetness’, ‘happiness’, ‘sweet’

De la Mata explains that these lexical items are ‘almost adjective nouns’, because they do not indicate a substance, but a quality. The following examples show that these nouns can occur with a possessive person prefix, which confirms that they are not adjectives, but nouns. The examples furthermore show that the adjectival nouns išiwah ‘bad’ and palyow ‘good’ which designate a value make a distinction between an absolute form and a relational form (#V > #n-V, #p > #m, see section 5.5), when they occur with a prefixed possessive person marker. As yet, it is not clear why this is not the case with the noun o…o ‘greatness’. It has no relational form *n-o…o, as would be expected. Ex.:

(362) (364)
(365)

mi-o…o (2323) 2sPOS-greatness ‘your greatness’

(363)

a-n-išiwah (2323) 1sPOS-REL-badness ‘my badness’

lyaka (183) a-lyaka mi-lyaka lyaka ki-lyaka mi-lyaka-ha i-lyaka

‘something coloured’, ‘redness’, ‘red’: ‘my coloured thing’ ‘your (m) coloured thing’ ‘his/her coloured thing’ ‘our coloured thing’ ‘your (p) coloured thing’ ‘their coloured thing’

palyow (2642) ‘goods’, ‘advantage’, ‘good’:

a-malyow

‘my good(s)’, ‘my advantage’

187

mi-malyow malyow ki-malyow mi-malyow-ha …i-malyow

‘your (m) good(s)’, ‘your advantage’ ‘his/her good(s)’, ‘his/her advantage’ ‘our good(s)’, ‘our advantage’ ‘your (p) good(s)’, ‘your (p) advantage’ ‘their good(s)’, ‘their advantage’

Other examples of adjectival nouns mentioned by de la Mata in this same section are ay-te-…u ‘quiet’, ‘peace’ (literally ‘a little bit at the background’), ka…iw ‘a cripple’, on…aplya ‘talker’, šep ‘infertility’, yamkuyla ‘diligence’.
According to Pedro de la Mata, the modifier may precede or follow the modified element (“a veces se anteponen y â veces se posponen”, fol. 89). However, the modifier always precedes the modified noun when the latter has a suffixed case marker. Notwithstanding Pedro de la Mata’s remark that an adjectival noun may precede or follow the modified noun, it appears that, in addition to the cases in which the latter has a suffixed case marker (e.g. yamkuyla hayu-lol-he ‘for diligent men’), the adjectival noun normally precedes the latter:

(366)

o…o kas (779) great wind ‘a great wind’

(367) …e… kot (2621) white water ‘clear water’

(368)

išiwah hayu (1037) bad man ‘a bad man’

(369) ay-te-…u

hayu (1041)

background-AD-DIM man

‘a quiet man’, ‘a peaceful man’

When an adjectival noun indicating a dimension modifies another adjectival noun, it also appears preposed:

(370)

kol o…o išiwah ø-kot-aõ (2966) death great badness 3sS-be-IA ‘Death is a great evil’.

In his section about adjectival nouns, de la Mata gives only one example of a postponed modifying noun:

(371)

…el

ka…iw (1036)

foot/man cripple

‘someone with a lame foot’, ‘a cripple’

Another example of a postponed adjectival noun was given by José Santos Chappa:

(372) ges nun

:

old man

‘an old man’

hila ges woman old ‘an old woman’

188

The opposite order, *nun ges and *ges hila, was rejected, so that the phrases ges nun and hila ges appeared to be fixed expressions. Since the expression …el ka…iw is the only example given by de la Mata to illustrate that a modifier can be postponed, and since the expression *nun ges was not attested and hila ges appeared to be a fixed expression, we may assume that the construction ‘head + modifier’ was not productive. However, in his section about gender in Cholón, de la Mata shows that the nouns ila ‘femininity’ and nun ‘manliness’ can be postponed when they function as modifiers, in case hayu ‘human being’ is the head noun (see section 6.12.4).
Adjectival nouns are used predicatively when they appear with a discourse marker replacing a copula, such as the question marker -le ‘or?’, ‘is it?’ or the emphasis marker -sim ‘(look, yes) it is’:

(373)

tsal-le (1389) black-QM ‘Is it black?’

(374)

lolše-sim (1390) Spanish/Spaniard-EMP ‘It is Spanish/It is a Spaniard’; ‘They are Spanish/They are Spaniards’.

6.12.3. Comparison In the ALC degree of comparison is explained by means of the nouns o…o ‘bigness’, ‘big’, and kun…u ‘smallness’, ‘small’ or mos…u ‘something scanty/tiny’, ‘tiny’.
Cholón has no declination for degrees of comparison. The comparative is formed by a preposed ni-…u-nik ‘with a little bit’, consisting of the following elements: the noun ni ‘bit’, diminutive -…u and the comitative case marker -nik ‘with’, ‘in the company of’27. (The word ni-nik ‘a.bit-COM’, which is synonymous with ni-…u-nik
and which also means ‘more’, does not occur in comparisons). The superlative is
formed by a preposed element ma, an intensifier indicating a high degree. A superlative of mos…u is not given.

(375) o…o (1235) ‘great/large’

ni-…u-nik o…o (1257) bit-DIM-COM great/large ‘(a bit) greater/larger’

ma o…o (1257) INT great/large ‘very great/large’

(376) kun…u (1255) ‘small’

ni-…u-nik kun…u (1256) bit-DIM-COM small ‘(a bit) smaller’

ma kun…u (1256) INT small ‘very small’

28 Cf. Ayacucho Quechua: as-wan ‘more’: a.little.bit-with.

189

(377)

mos…u (1263) ‘scanty/tiny’
ni-…u-nik mos…u (1264) bit-DIM-COM scanty/tiny ‘(a bit) scantier/tinier’

A high degree is not only expressed by the intensifier ma, but also by the following related forms: maha-ly, ma-ma, ma-ma-ta, ma pa-te-p, pa-te-p, pa-te-p ma. According to the ALC, ma and pa-te-p are synonymous and are glossed as ‘many’, ‘much’ and ‘very’. The suffix -te-p marks an oblique case and functions as an elative and instrumental ‘from’, ‘by’ (see section 6.4.3.3). (The word pa-te-p seems to mean ‘by far’, ‘to a large extent’).

(378)

pa-te-p …i-ha…-aõ (1243) INT-AD-ABL 3pS-field.make-IA ‘They make many fields’.

(379) pa-te-p ma palyow (1246) INT-AD-ABL INT good ‘very, very good’

The form pa-te-p can also occur together with the expressions maha-ly and ma-mata. The forms maha-ly and ma-ma-ta are synonyms and designate ‘a large amount’ or ‘a large quantity’. In the former term, the element -ly is the restrictive suffix
‘only’, ‘nothing else but’ (see section 6.4.5.1). In the latter term, the element ta may
be identified with ta ‘rock’, ‘stone’. If so, it is suffixed to the intensifier ma and
functions as a classifier meaning ‘firm/stony object (see section 6.10.2)’:

(380)

maha-ly ay…a u-ø-lyup-aõ (1239) INT-RST meat 3sA-3sO-eat-IA ‘He eats much meat’.

(381)

(382)

ma-ma-ta

sak-nik (1242)

INT-INT-CL:firm/stony food-COM

‘with a lot of food’

Comparisons in which two objects are compared are formed by means of the case marker combination -man-ap ‘after’, ‘(starting) from’. In such constructions the object of reference or object of comparison (X) precedes the compared object (Y), and the case marker combination -man-ap is suffixed to the object of comparison: 1. ‘X-from ...er Y is’ 2. ‘X-from the ...est Y is’ The comparative degree in comparison 1 is formed by means of the word ni-…u-nik (see above), and the superlative in comparison 2 by means of an intensifier such as

190

ma, pa-te-p, or a combination of both. The word ni-…u-nik and the intensifiers are then followed by a noun indicating the property or quality compared.

(383)

‘You are the best of all women’.

No instances have been found of constructions consisting of kun…u or mos…u followed by a noun.

6.12.4. Gender indication Although de la Mata discusses categories of nominal gender, from a structural point of view gender distinctions do not play a role in Cholón, apart from the grammatical gender distinction found in the personal reference system (see section 6.2, 6.5, 6.6, and chapter 7). When necessary, gender can be indicated by means of a noun, for instance, to specify whether a human being, an animal or a plant is masculine or feminine, with the terms nun (301) ‘man’, ‘manliness’, and ila (302) ‘woman’, ‘femininity’. When these modifiers are used with a human being, they can precede or follow the modified noun; whith an animal or a plant, they follow the noun in question:

(385)

nun

hayu/

hayu

nun (225)

manliness human.being/ human.being manliness

‘a man’

(386) (387)

ila

hayu/

hayu

ila (226)

femininity human.being/ human.being femininity

‘woman’

ku…i nun (229) pig manliness ‘boar’

ku…i ila (230) pig femininity ‘sow’

(388)

papaya nun (233) papaya manliness ‘male papaya’

papaya ila (234) papaya femininity ‘female papaya’

The quality of ‘manliness’ with the connotation of ‘bigness’ can also be attributed to objects. José Santos Chappa called a large, big saucepan a …aplyoõ nun (pan

191

manliness). The terms nun and ila can be followed by adjectivizer -(k)o (see 6.4.5.4):

(389)

ulyukiow nun-o (235) partridge manliness-ADJ ‘male partridge’

ulyukiow ila-ko (236) partridge femininity-ADJ ‘female partridge’

In section 6.4.5.4 we have seen that a morpheme -(k)o is found as a distributive after cardinal numbers. In this case, occurring after the words nun and ila, the suffix -(k)o is likely to function as an adjectivizer.

6.12.5. Number The suffixes -ha and -lol are used to indicate pronominal (see section 6.2 and 6.5) and nominal (see section 6.4.5.3) plurality, respectively. In the latter case, indication of number is optional. Usually, an unmarked noun can be singular as well as plural and the numerical interpretation depends on the context:

(390) (391)

hayu (21) ‘a (native) man’, ‘an Indian’, ‘(native) men’, ‘Indians’

hayu-lol (777) man-PL ‘(native) men’, ‘Indians’

hayu i-tsip

pusim-pat ø-nyantum-iy-la …e-kt-aõ (47)

Indian 3pPOS-house straw-INS 3sO-cover-PST-3pA 3pS-be-IA

‘The houses of the Indians are covered with straw’.

Plural can also be indicated by means of the indefinite determiner mek ‘all’ (cf. section 6.9.4), by means of the reduplication of the indefinite pronoun in…a ‘(some)thing’ (cf. in…a section 6.9.3) and by means of a numeral (see section 6.10.1):

(392)

mek uõa (1461) all infant ‘all the infants’

(393)

mek in…a (11355) all thing ‘all the things’

(394)

in…a in…a (1361) thing thing ‘things’

(395)

ip-hil (1097) two-CL:speech ‘two words’

Plurality can furthermore be indicated by the intensifiers ma and pa-te-p, both designating a high degree, and the composites maha-ly, ma maha-ly, ma-ma-ta, ma
pa-te-p, pa-te-p ma (see section 6.12.3 above).

7. Verbal morphosyntax

7.1. Introduction At the beginning of his first chapter dealing with the verb Pedro de la Mata distinguishes several kinds of verbs: intransitive verbs ‘verbo substantivo’, transitive verbs ‘verbo activo’, passive verbs ‘verbo pasivo’, compound verbs ‘verbo compuesto’, simple verbs ‘verbo simple’, impersonal verbs ‘verbo impersonal’, neutral verbs ‘verbo neutro’ and defective verbs ‘verbo defectivo’. He explains that passive verbs and compound verbs are formed by means of an ‘auxiliary’. These ‘auxiliaries’ appear to be bound verbs (see 7.3.3.2) or derivational suffixes (see 7.3.4). Simple verbs are non-compound verbs. Impersonal verbs as well as neutral verbs have only an impersonal third person singular ‘it’ as subject. The two kinds of verbs are treated in section 7.5 and 7.6, respectively. De la Mata’s defective verbs may be analyzed as interjections (chapter 9).
According to Pedro de la Mata all Cholón verbs end in n, and the ‘present tense of the indicative’ always ends in an, en, in, on, or un. He gives the following examples (the division into morphemes is mine):

a-tp-a-õ (238) a-šk-e-õ (239) a-õisi-ny (240) a-ø-lu-po-õ (241) a-mu-õ (242)

‘I walk’ ‘I cause to drink’ ‘I cheat’ ‘I abhor someone/something’ ‘I taste something’/’I bring it to my mouth’

However, the vowel e of de la Mata’s ‘present tense’ ending -e-õ above appears to be a separate suffix with a number of different functions (see section 7.4.2.2); the form a-õisi-ny is the only ‘present tense’ form ending in a palatal nasal; and the vowels i, o and u of de la Mata’s endings -iny, -oõ and -uõ are part of the verb stem. The ‘present tense’ is thus likely to end in -(a)õ. This suffix, however, appears to indicate incompletive aspect rather than a present tense. The complex behaviour of incompletive -(a)õ is discussed in 7.4.1.
De la Mata furthermore remarks that the preterite (both ‘perfect’ and ‘imper-
fect’) ends in ay, ey, y/iy, oy, uy, or ow. (The ending y/iy was transcribed as <i/yi>
by de la Mata. For our interpretation of de la Mata’s transcription, see section 4.2.3).
This remark is accompanied with the following examples (the division into
morphemes again is mine):

194

a-sina-y (244) (< sinah ‘( to) hear’)

a-šk-e-y (245)

a-kt-iy (246)

kama a-ki-y (247)

a-ø-lu-po-y (248) (< lu-poh ‘(to) abhor’)

u-mu-y (249)

(< *muh ‘(to) taste/

bring to the mouth’)

‘I heard someone/something’ ‘I drank/ I caused to drink’ ‘I was’ ‘I was ill’ ‘I abhorred someone/something’ ‘he tasted’/ ‘he brought to his mouth’

An example with the ending ow is not given, but the examples above can be supplemented with the following form:

(1) a-l-o-w (2139) 1sA-3sO-do/make-PST ‘I did it’/’I made it’

The examples show that the preterite normally ends in -(i)y, but that it ends in -w
after verbs ending in o, such as the verb o ‘(to) do/make’ in the example above; -iy
is used after a consonantal stem and -y after a vocalic stem or a stem in h, which is
then lost; the vowels a, o, u belong to the verb stem, and the vowel e is a separate
suffix.
De la Mata also says that the simple future tense ends in <ctan>, <htan>,
<ptan>, <itan>. These ‘endings’ actually consist of three elements: 1: the stem
endings k/h/p/y, respectively; 2: the future marker -(k)t(e); 3: the incompletive aspect marker -(a)õ. De la Mata’s indications reflect the fact that the short ending -taõ is used after stems which end in a consonant (in p, t, …, k, ts, s, š, h, n, õ, w, y; stems ending in m have not been found), whereas -kt-aõ is found after stems ending in a vowel. The ending <itan> can also be interpreted as -(i)y-t-aõ, which then consist of the following elements: -(i)y ‘stem extension’, -t- ‘future’, -aõ ‘imperfective aspect’. The forms in -(i)y-t-aõ are less common. They only occur in the following cases: (i): the derived verbs k(o)loh-ia(h) ‘(to) finish again’ and patsa-kia(h) ‘(to) be busy
continuously’, which are formed by means of the derivational suffix -(k)ia(h) ‘reiterative’, have a future form in -y-t-aõ:

(2) a-l-o-kloh-ia-y-t-aõ (2178) 1sA-3sO-do-finish-RE-SE-F-IA ‘I shall finish doing it again’

(3) a-l-o-…

ø-patsa-kia-y-t-aõ (2179)

1sA-3sO-do-FAC 3sS-take.all.day-RE-SE-F-IA

‘I shall do it continuously’

195

Cf. a-l-o-kiah-t-aõ (2163) 1sA-3sO-do-RE-F-IA ‘I shall do it again’

a-l-o-pale-kiah-t-aõ (2177) 1sA-3sO-do-pace.up.and.down-RE-F-IA ‘I shall do it pacing up and down’

(ii): the future of ly(a)w/lya ‘(to) go (away)’ ends in -iy-t-aõ when the verb is used impersonally. The stem is then preceded by an applicative object:

(4) ø-k-a-lyaw-iy-t-aõ (1824) 3sS-1pO-APL-go.away-SE-F-IA ‘it will go away from us’

cf. ø-lya-kt-aõ (907) 3sS-go-F-IA ‘he/she/it will go’

(iii): verbs passivized with the derivational suffix its and the verb y(a)…/y(a)š ‘(to) see’ have an alternative future form in -iy-t-aõ:

(5) ki-kole-its-iy-t-aõ (1002) 1pS-love-PAS-SE-F-IA ‘we shall be loved’

cf. …i-kole-its-t-aõ (1002) 3pS-love-PAS-F-IA ‘they will be loved’

(6) a-penyo-its-iy-t-aõ (1022) 1sS-want-PAS-SE-F-IA ‘I shall be wanted’

(7) a-ts…-iy-t-aõ (254) 1sA-3sO.see-SE-F-IA ‘I shall see him/her/it’

cf. a-tsaš-t-aõ (254) 1sA-3sO.see-F-IA ‘I shall see him/her/it’

cf. a-mna-y…-t-aõ (2030) 1sS-way-see-F-IA ‘I shall watch the way’

Thereupon, Pedro de la Mata presents the conjugation of an intransitive verb, the verb k(o)t ‘(to) be’, and two transitive verbs: õole/õoly ‘to love someone/ something’ and meny(o) ‘(to) want someone/something’28. The conjugational
paradigms of these verbs are represented in Appendix 3.2. On the basis of these
conjugations, person markers, stems and endings can be distinguished. It appears
that a verb form can consist of a stem + several affixes: one or two person markers,

29 Actually, the verbs in question are kole/koly and peny(o). De la Mata oncludes the third person object marker which consists in nasalization of the initial consonant.

196
an applicative marker, bound stems, derivationals, an aspect marker, stem extension and past tense markers, future and imperative markers, nominalizers, subordinators, and case markers. Person markers are mostly prefixed; the applicative marker is also prefixed; the other affixes are suffixed. A form such as a-mna-y…-t-aõ ‘I shall watch the way’ above, which contains a nominal base, -mna-, as well as a verbal root, -y…-, shows that nouns can be incorporated into verbal stems. (The nominal base -mna- is a reduced relational form of pana ‘road’, ‘way’. The verbal root -y…-, < y(a)… ‘(to) see’, has also been reduced by vowel suppression. For vowel reduction or suppression, see section 5.4; and for relational forms, see section 5.5). (The example a-tsaš-t-aõ ‘I shall see him/her/it’ shows that the palatal occlusive articulation of the final segment of the non-reduced stem ya… changes into an alveo-dental fricative articulation before an alveo-dental stop. In only one example -a… does not change into aš before t:
(8) mi-tsa…-te (764) 2sA-3sO.see-F ‘you will see it’
However, when the stem is reduced, it keeps its final palatal occlusive articulation and -… then does not change into š before alveo-dental t, see the example a-mna-y…-t-aõ ‘I shall watch the way’).
Personal reference is analyzed in section 7.2; stems, bound verbs and derivational suffixes are examined in section 7.3; the remaining suffixes in 7.4. The analysis of suffixes is followed by sections about impersonal verbs, neutral verbs and verbs derived from nouns. A section about fixed expressions completes the chapter.
7.2. Personal reference In Cholón verb forms several affixes referring to persons and objects that play a role in the expressed event can be distinguished. These affixes or person markers may function as subject (S) of an intransitive verb form; agent (A) of a transitive verb form; direct or indirect object (O) (indirect objects are marked by the additional presence of an applicative marker); beneficiary (B) of a transitive verb form. (The distinction between subject, agent and object and the indications S ‘intransitive subject’, A ‘transitive subject’, and O ‘transitive object’ are taken from Dixon, 1994: 6. In our description, however, O may refer to a direct object as well as to an indirect object). Intransitive forms can be distinguished from transitive forms by the absence (intransitive) or presence (transitive) of a direct object and by the use of different third person markers. In an intransitive form, a third person singular subject is either not marked, or it is indicated by means of the prefix l- or by a modified stem, and a third person plural subject is indicated by means of the prefix (…)i-. In a transitive form, a third person singular subject is marked by means of the prefixes i- or õ-, and a third person plural agent is referred to by means of the suffix -la; cf. the following examples:

197

intransitive: (9) ø-kot-aõ (292)
3sS-be-IA ‘he is’

transitive: i-ø-šk-e-õ (953) 3sA-3sO-drink-CAU-IA ‘he causes him to drink’

(10) õol-aõ (2761) 3sS.die-IA ‘he dies’

õ-a-kole-khe (1699) 3sA-1sO-love-SIM ‘as he loves me’

(11) i-toõ (501) 3pS-be.(seated) ‘they are/ sit’
(12) …i-kole-its-aõ (1000) 3pS-love-PAS-IA ‘they are loved’

ø-lo-y-la-õ (962) 3sO-wet-SE-3pA-IA ‘they wet someone/something’

Reflexive verbs are treated as intransitives. For instance, the verb kole-n(o) ‘(to)
love oneself’, consisting of the stem kole ‘(to) love’ + the derivational suffix -n(o)
‘reflexive’ is intransitive. The third person singular subject is referred to by means of a modified stem-initial õ, and the third person plural subject is indicated by means of the prefix …i-. If the verb would have been transitive, (i) the stem-initial k of kole/ koly would have been changed into a stem-initial velar nasal õ indicating a third person singular object; (ii) this stem-inital õ would occur in combination with another person marker, viz. an agent marker; (iii) a third person singular agent
would have been marked by means of the prefix i-, and third person plural by means
of the suffix -la:

(13) õole-n-aõ (1526) 3sS.love-RFL-IA ‘he loves himself’

cf. i-õoly-aõ (687) 3sA-3sO.love-IA ‘he loves someone’

(14) ki-kole-n-aõ (1527) 1pS-love-RFL-IA ‘we love ourselves’

cf. ki-õoly-aõ (688) 1pA-3sO.love-IA ‘we love someone’

(15) …i-kole-n-aõ (1529) 3pS-love-RFL-IA ‘they love themselves’

cf. õoly-iy-la-õ (690) 3sO.love-SE-3pA-IA ‘they love someone’

The subject, agent, object and beneficiary markers are prefixed, but for -la ‘3pA’ and -ha ‘second person plural marker’. Two is the maximum number of person markers that can be affixed to a verb form, not including the second person plural

198

marker -ha and the applicative marker. Stems of intransitive verbs can be accompanied with one person marker, indicating the subject, or with an object marker accompanied by an applicative marker. In the latter case, the subject is always impersonal (a third person singular ‘it’) and therefore not marked on the verb:

(16) ke-tõ-aõ (508) 1pS-be.(seated)-IA ‘we are/ sit’

(17) ø-k-a-kot-aõ (558) 3sS-1pO-APL-be.there-IA ‘it is there for us’/’we have’

Stems of transitive verbs can be accompanied with two person markers: one referring to the agent and a second one referring to an object (whether or not followed by the applicative marker -a), or a beneficiary . The agent normally precedes the object and the beneficiary:
(18) a-m-koly-aõ (1646) 1sA-2sO-love-IA ‘I love you’

(19) mi-sak-ha i-m-a-pu…-iy-ha-õ (1692) 2POS-food-PL 3sA-2O-APL-put.down-SE-PL-IA ‘He puts down your (p) food for you (p)’.

(20) a-t-hil-aõ (2136) 1sA-3sB-speak-IA ‘I intercede [for someone]’ (lit. ‘I speak for someone’)

A reference to three arguments can be observed with stems with a modified steminitial consonant, such as tsa…/tsaš/taš ‘(to) see something’ < ya…/yaš ‘(to) see’. The modified stem-initial alveo-dental then designates a third person singular object:
(21) maha-ly pa-mo a-m-a-tsa…-aõ (1676) INT-RST COL-fruit 1sA-2sO-APL-3sO.see-IA ‘I see that you have a lot of fruits’. (lit. ‘I see a lot of fruits for you’).
(22) mi-nyanta-ha ki-m-a-tsa…-iy-ha (1680) 2POS-face-PL 1pA-2O-APL-3sO.see-PST-PL ‘We saw your (p) faces (for you)’.

The distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs does not seem to be clearcut in Cholón. The stem of an intransitive verb can be part of a transitive verb form, and vice versa. The stem tup ‘(to) walk’, for instance, usually belongs to an intransitive verb, in which case third person singular subject is not marked and third person plural is indicated by means of the prefix u- (< i-, see section 5.5 about

199

vowel harmony). On the other hand, the stem tup can also occur with the agent markers u- ‘3sA’ and -la ‘3pA’, in which case it is part of a transitive form ‘(to) cause to walk’:

(23) ø-tup-aõ (931) 3sS-walk-IA ‘he walks’

(24) u-ø-tp-aõ (2050) 3sA-3sO-walk-IA ‘he causes him/her/it to walk’

(25) u-tup-aõ (931) 3pS-walk-IA ‘they walk’

(26) ø-tup-iy-la-õ (2050) 3sO-walk-SE-3pA-IA ‘they cause him/her/it to walk’

The stem n-eštek-w(o) RF-cloth-VB (see also section 7.7) ‘(to) make someone’s clothes’, ‘(to) sew’ can also be both transitive and intransitive. In the incompletive aspect paradigm of this verb, an intransitive third person singular and a transitive third person plural form are encountered:

(27) ø-n-eštek-w-aõ (2015) 3sS-REL-cloth-VB-IA ‘he makes (his) cloth(es)’

(28) ø-n-eštek-wo-w-la-õ (2015) 3sO-REL-cloth-VB-SE-3pA-IA ‘they make someone’s cloth(es)’

The former has an intransitive form, because third person singular is not marked. If it were a transitive form, third person singular would have been indicated by means of the prefix e- ‘3sA’ (a harmonized i- ‘3sA’). The latter has a transitive form, because third person plural is marked by means of the agent marker -la ‘3pA’. Otherwise, third person plural would have been marked by means of the prefix e‘3pS’.
The markers a- ‘1s’, mi- ‘2sm’, pi- ‘2sf’, ø- ‘3s’, ki- ‘1p’, mi- ... -ha ‘2p’, (…)i‘3p’, which are used to indicate a possessor (see section 6.2), also indicate an argument: the first and second person markers a-, mi-, pi-, ki-, mi- ... -ha can refer to a subject, agent or object, and the third person markers ø- and (…)i- refer to a subject. (For harmonization and suppression of the vowel i of the person prefixes, see section 5.4.1 and 5.4.2, respectively):

(29) u-ø-lyup-aõ (1926) 3sA-3sO-eat-IA ‘he eats something’

(30) i-k-kole-khe (1713) 3sA-1pO-love-IMP ‘may he love us’

(31) m-a-kole-kte

mi-meny-aõ (1746)

2sA-1sO -love-INF 2sA-3sO.want-IA

‘You want to love me’.

200

As regards the position of the second element of the person marker mi- ... -ha, the plural marker -ha, we have noticed that -ha is directly suffixed to the nominal stem when mi- ... -ha functions as a possessive person marker (see section 6.2). When mi- ... -ha functions as an argument, -ha can not always directly be suffixed to a verb stem. In most forms, plural marker -ha is preceded by the stem extender and past tense markers -(i)y or -w, namely, in (i) incompletive aspect forms ending in -(a)õ:

(32) me-kt-iy-ha-õ (294) 2S-be-SE-PL-IA ‘you (p) are’

(33) mi-õoly-iy-ha-õ (689) 2A-3sO.love-SE-PL-IA ‘you (p) love him/her/it’

(ii) preterite forms (-ha can then be followed by the anteriority marker -(k)e) (section 6.4.1 and 7.4.3):

(37) mi-õoly-iy-ha (695) 2A-3sO.love-PST-PL ‘you (p) loved him/her/it’

(36) me-kt-iy-ha-ke (297) 2S-be-PST-PL-ANT ‘you (p) had been’
(38) mi-menyo-w-ha-ke (822) 2A-3sO.want-PST-PL-ANT ‘you (p) had wanted him/her/it’

(iii) three attested forms in -(e)… ‘factivizer’; ‘purposive subordinator’:

(40) me-tõ-iy-ha-… (544) 2S-be.(seated)-SE-PL-FAC/ 2S-be.(seated)-SE-PL-PURP ‘that you (p) are (seated)’/ ‘so that you (p) are (seated)’

‘that he/she/it goes away from you (p)’/ ‘so that he/she/it goes away from

When the plural marker -ha occurs with a derivational suffix or a bound stem, it regulary follows them. In the incompletive aspect forms in -(a)õ and in the preterite

201

forms, -ha is then also preceded by the stem extenders -(i)y and -w. Although examples of preterite forms in which plural marker -ha occurs with a bound verb have not been found, we may assume that in such forms -ha would also have been preceded by the suffix -(i)y/ -w. Examples of incompletive aspect second person plural forms:

(42) mi-menyo-ka-y-ha-õ (868) 2A-3sO.want-ICA-SE-PL-IA ‘you (p) cause him/her/it to want’
(43) mi-tsoy-e-y-ha-õ (1921)
2A-3sO.cry-CAU-SE-PL-IA ‘you (p)cause him/her/it to cry’

(44) mi-l-o-kol-iy-ha-õ (2168) 2A-3sO-do/make-finish-SE-PL-IA ‘you (p) finish doing/making it’

(45) mi-l-o-…upo-w-ha-õ (2169) 2A-3sO-do/make-do.tenderly-SE-PL-IA ‘you (p) tenderly do/make it’

Examples of preterite forms of preterite second person plural forms:

(46) mi-menyo-ka-y-ha (860)

(47)

2A-3sO.want-ICA-PST-PL

‘you (p) caused him/her/it to want’

mi-kole-its-iy-ha (1001) 2S-love-PAS-PST-PL ‘you (p) were loved’

However, when the plural marker -ha occurs in a derived verb form with the derivational suffix -(k)ia(h) ‘reiterative’, it precedes that suffix and is then not preceded by neither -(i)y nor -w:

(48) mi-menyo-ha-kia-õ (891) 2A-3sO.want-PL-RE-IA ‘you (p) want him/her/it again’

(49) mi-menyo-ha-kia-y (892) 2A-3sO.want-PL-RE-PST ‘you (p) wanted him/her/it again’

(50) mi-menyo-ha-kiah-t-aõ (893) 2A-3sO.want-PL-RE-F-IA ‘you (p) will want him/her/it again’

In summary, we may conclude that the plural marker -ha is always preceded by stem extension (by -(i)y or -w), except in combinations with -(k)ia(h). It should be observed, however, that not all possible combinations have been found in the ALC.

Subject, agent and object person markers are examined in more detail in the sections 7.2.1, 7.2.2 and 7.2.3, respectively. In addition to these person markers, de la Mata mentions the prefixes t- and p-/ m-, which indicate a beneficiary. These prefixes are treated in section 7.2.6.

7.2.1. Subject markers
In many aspects, the paradigm of the subject markers is similar to that of the
possessive person markers. It has a zero-marked third person singular and it also uses the forms …i- and i- to indicate a third person plural: …i- occurs before steminitial p, m, k, h, y, before a vowel, and before the reflexive beneficiary and
reciprocal marker m- (reflexive and reciprocal verbs are intransitive, see section 7.2); i- appears before initials of the alveo-dental range t, ts, s, n, l, including the palatalized counterparts …, š, ny, ly. Below, examples of subject marking (left column) are contrasted with examples of possessive marking (right column):

(51) a-kt-aõ (290) 1sS-be-IA ‘I was’

a-tsla (148) 1sPOS-wife ‘my wife’

(52) me-kt-iy (297) 2smS-be-PST ‘you (m) were’

mi-paõ (140) 2sPOS-mother ‘your (m) mother’

(53) pe-kt-iy (315) 2sfS-be-PST ‘you (f) were’
(54) ø-kot-iy (298) 3sS-be-PST ‘he was’

pu-pulu… (149) 2sfPOS-husband ‘your (f) husband’
ø-n-atelypa (102) 3sPOS-REL-chicken ‘his chicken’

(55) ke-kt-iy (299) 1pS-be-PST ‘we were’

ki-kot (114) 1pPOS-water ‘our water’

(56) me-kt-iy-ha (300) 2S-be-PST-PL ‘you (p) were’

me-n-el-ha (106) 2POS-REL-yucca-PL ‘your (p) yucca’

(57) …e-kt-iy (301) 3pS-be-PST ‘they were’

…i-mna (138 3pPOS-road ‘their road’

203

(58) …i-m-koly-aõ (64) 3pA-3pB/REC-love-IA ‘they love each other’
(59) i-toõ-iy (516) 3pS-be.(seated)-PST ‘they were (sitting)’

e-lyes (130) 3pPOS-alfalfa ‘their alfalfa’

However, there are some differences between the nominal possessor paradigm and the verbal subject paradigm: (1) In addition to the non-marked third person singular, there is a subject prefix lwhich has the same function. It is used when the verb stem begins with a vowel:

(60) l-am-aõ (2054) 3sS-eat-IA ‘he eats’

(61) l-e-n-aõ (2076) 3sS-give-RFL-IA ‘he gives himself’

(62) l-o-n-aõ (2167) 3sS-make-RFL-IA ‘he makes himself’.

(2) A third person singular subject can furthermore be referred to by means of a modified stem-initial m, õ, ts, s:

(63) menyo-its-aõ (1018) 3sS.want-PAS-IA ‘he is wanted’

cf. a-penyo-its-aõ (1016) 1sS-want-PAS-IA ‘I am wanted’

(64) õol-iy (2784) 3sS.die-PST ‘he died’
(65) tsoy-aõ (2060) 3sS.cry-IA ‘he cries’

cf. a-kl-iy (2784) 1sS-die-PST ‘I died’
cf. a-yoy-aõ (2060) 1sS-cry-IA ‘I cry’

(66) sil-aõ (1127) 3sS.speak-IA ‘he speaks’

cf. mi-hil-mulo-pe-…-ap (1621) 2sS-speak-begin-NE-FAC-ABL ‘before you begin to speak’

The modified consonants can be interpreted as the result of the merger of a nasal, indicating third person singular subject, and stem-initial p, k, y, h (see also section 5.5). Since both third person singular agent and object can be referred to by means

204

of the prefix õ(o) (see below), the nasal which underlies the modified initial consonant of an intransitive verb stem may have been a velar nasal as well:
*õ + #p > #m *õ + #k > #õ *õ + #y > #ts *õ + #h > #s

(3) another difference between the nominal possessor paradigm and the verbal subject paradigm is that third person plural marker …i- can appear before y and before a vowel when it is used as a subject marker, whereas it never occurs before y
nor before a vowel when it functions as a possessive marker. This is because (i) nouns which have y or a vowel in initial position change y into ts or take an
epenthetic n in their relational forms, respectively (see section 5.5); and (ii) i-, not …i-, occurs before ts and epenthetic n. Compare:

(67) …i-yoy-aõ (1917) 3pS-cry-IA ‘they cry’

i-tsip (47) 3pPOS-house ‘their hous(es)’

(68) …i-am-aõ (2054) 3pS-eat-IA ‘they eat’

i-n-atelypa (105) 3pPOS-REL-chicken ‘their chickens’

7.2.2. Agent markers
The first and second person affixes a-, mi-, pi-, ki-, mi- ... -ha, and the third person plural affix …i-, which are used to refer to a possessor or to a subject, can also be used to indicate an agent. However, the prefix …i- is only used as an agent marker when the object is a third person plural. Examples:

(69) a-õoly-aõ (685) 1sA-3sO.love-IA ‘I love him/her/it’

(70) mi-meny-aõ (807) 2smA-3sO.want-IA ‘you (m) want him/her/it’

(71) pi-l-o-w (2880) 2sfA-3sO-do-PST ‘you (f) did it’

(72) ki-õoly-aõ (688) 1pA-3sO.love-IA ‘we love him/her/it’

(73) mi-menyo-w-ha-õ (810) 2A-3sO.want-SE-PL-IA ‘you (p) want him/her/it’

(74) …i-po-hia-õ (1661) 3pA-3pO-wait.for-IA ‘they wait for them’

In addition, Cholón has two different prefixes to indicate a third person singular agent: i- and õ-, and one suffix to designate a third person plural agent: -la. The third person singular agent marker õ- is used when the object is a first person singular. It may also underlie the nasal initial of the prefix mo- ‘3sA.3pO’, which appears to be derived from *õ ‘3sA’+ po ‘3pO’ (cf. *õ + #p > #m, section 7.2.1):

(75) i-meny-aõ (808) 3sA-3sO.want-IA ‘he wants him/her/it’

(76) õ-a-kole-kte

i-meny-aõ (1748)

3sA-1sO-love-INF 3sA-3sO.want-IA

‘he wants to love me’

(77) õ-a-hia-õ (1648) 3sA-1sO-wait.for-IA ‘he waits for me’

(78) mo-koly-aõ (2151) 3sA.3pO-love-IA ‘he loves them’

The suffix -la ‘3pA’ is used when the object is not a third person plural. Like the plural marker -ha, third person plural marker -la is preceded by the stem extenders and preterite markers -(i)y and -w when occurring in incompletive aspect forms and preterite forms (see the remarks about the use of plural marker -ha in section 7.2.1). In the former, -la is then also followed by the incompletive aspect marker -(a)õ; in the latter, -la is also either not followed by any suffix, or followed by the anteriority marker -(k)e:

206

(79) õoly-iy-la-õ (690) 3sO.love-SE-3pA-IA ‘they love him/her/it’
(81) õoly-iy-la-ke (702) 3sO.love-PST-3pA-ANT ‘they had loved him/her/it’

(80) õoly-iy-la (696) 3sO.love-PST-3pA ‘they loved him/her/it’

Unlike plural marker -ha, which can be preceded by the stem extender -(i)y when followed by the factivizer -(e)…, the third person plural marker -la is never preceded by -(i)y when followed by the ending -(e)…. It is then always directly suffixed to the verb stem:

(82) õole-la-… (763) 3sO.love-3pA-FAC ‘that they love him/her/it’

(83) menyo-la-… (846) 3sO.want-3pA-FAC ‘that they want him/her/it’

In a derived verb form, -la ‘3pA’, like the plural marker -ha, occurs before the derivational suffix -(k)ia(h) ‘reiterative’ but after the derivational suffixes -(k)e(h) ‘causative’ and -ka(h) ‘causative’, which are then followed by stem extension (-(k)e-y, -ka-y). (It can not appear in a derived form with passivizer -its and reflexivizer -n(o), because such verb forms are considered to be intransitive, and the third person plural subject marker of intransitive verbs is regularly (…)i-):

(84) menyo-la-kia-õ (891) 3sO.want-3pA-RE-IA ‘they want him/her/it again’

(85) menyo-ka-y-la-õ (868) 3sO.want-ICA-SE-3pA-IA ‘they cause him/her/it to want’

(86) tsam-e-y-la-õ (944) 3sO.know-CAU-SE-3pA-IA ‘they cause to know it’/ ‘they teach it’

In forms composed with a bound verb, -la usually precedes the bound verb (the plural marker -ha normally follows the bound verb):

(87) l-o-la-lyuk-aõ (2173) 3sO-do-3pA-finish-IA ‘they finish doing it’

(88) l-o-la-pul-aõ (2174) 3sO-do-3pA-stop/interrupt-IA ‘they stop/interrupt doing it’

(89) l-o-la-mul-aõ (2172) 3sO-do-3pA-start-IA ‘they start doing it’

(90) õole-la-…up-aõ (2113) 3sO.love-3pA-do.tenderly-IA ‘they love him/her/it tenderly’

207

In two attested cases, -la follows the bound verb, which then undergoes stem extension:

(91) l-o-…upo-w-la-õ (2169) 3sO-do-do.tenderly-SE-3pA-IA ‘they do it tenderly’

(92) l-o-kol-iy-la-õ (2168) 3sO-do-finish-SE-3pA-IA ‘they finish doing it’

(*l-o-la-…up-aõ and *l-o-la-kol-aõ have not been encountered). When a derivational suffix is attached to a bound verb, -la regularly follows the derivational suffix, even when this suffix is -(k)ia(h) (see before):

(93) l-o-kloh-ia-y-la-õ (2168) 3sO-do-finish-RE-SE-3pA-IA ‘they finish doing it again’

When -ha and la- occur together in one verb form, the latter regularly precedes the former:

(94) mi-hia-y-la-ha-õ (1660) 2O-wait.for-SE-3pA-PL-IA ‘they wait for you (p)’

In two examples, …i- instead of -la is used. In one of them …i- occurs before a transitive stem with a modified initial consonant m indicating a third person singular object:
(95) …i-malyow-e-õ (2230) (< palyow-e(h) ‘(to) benefit’) 3pS-3sO.benefit-VB-IA ‘they benefit him/her/it’

In the other example, …i- occurs before a stem beginning with p (cf. …i- = 3pA, when followed by po- ‘3pO’):

(96) …i-ø-paso-lam-he (1581) 3pA-3sO-preach-FN1-BEN ‘in order that they preach it’

In the following table the agent markers are represented. (The exceptional use of …i- as an agent marker in …i-malyow-e-õ and …i-ø-paso-lam-he is disregarded).

7.2.3. Object markers The personal reference markers mentioned in 7.2.1 and 7.2.2, again except for the third person markers, are also used to indicate an object:

(97) m-a-kole-ki (1698) 2sA-1sO-love-IMP ‘Love me!’

(98) i-m-kole-khe (1700) 3sA-2smO-love-IMP ‘May he love you (m)!’

(99) i-p-kole-khe (1700) 3sA-2sfO-love-IMP ‘May he love you (f)!’

‘The downpour wet us’.

(101)

i-m-lo-y-ha (2219) 3sA-2O-wet-PST-PL ‘he wet you (p)’

A third person singular direct object can be referred to by means of a modified steminitial m, õ, ts, s, due to an underlying *õ ‘3sO’ (see section 7.2.1 and 7.2.2):

(102)

i-mo-õ (2223) 3sA-3sO.burn-IA ‘he burns/bites him/her/it’

(< po ‘(to) burn/bite’)

(103)

i-õoly-aõ (687) 3sA-3sO.love-IA ‘he loves him/her/it’

(< kole ‘(to) love’)

209

(104) (105)

a-sina-õ (1741) 2sA-3sO.hear-IA ‘I hear him/her/it’

(< hina ‘(to) hear’)

an-tsel

i-tsp-aõ (2481) (< yap ‘(to) catch/take’)

one-CL:truncal 3sA-3sO.catch-IA

‘He catches another one’.

A third person singular direct object can also be indicated by means of the prefixes l- and õo-. The former appears when the verb stem begins with a vowel:

(106)

a-l-ø-aõ (2138) 1sA-3sO-make-IA ‘I make it’

(107)

i-l-o-w (775) 3sA-3sO-make-PST ‘he made it’

The prefix õo- only occurs in a construction consisting of a transitive main verb + auxiliary k(o)t ‘(to) be’. The main verb appears as a subordinated form in -(k)he ‘simultaneity’ and is accompanied by the direct object prefix õo-. There is no agent marker. The auxiliary k(o)t is in the incompletive aspect form, and its subject functions as the agent of the predicate:

(108)

õo-kole-khe a-kt-aõ (1796) 3sO-love-SIM 1sS-be-IA ‘I am loving him’

(109)

õo-kole-khe …e-kt-aõ (1802) 3sO-love-SIM 3pS-be-IA ‘they are loving him’

In all other cases, third person singular object is not indicated, viz. it is zero-marked, and the existence of a third person singular object appears to be implied:

(110)

ø-lyup-iy-la-õ (1926) 3sO-eat-SE-3sA-IA ‘they eat something’

The third person plural direct object is indicated by p(o)-, realized as m- and pbefore an applicative marker (see Table 7.3 below), and as mo and po elsewhere. The form m(o)- is a nasalized form of p(o)-: *õ- ‘3sA’ + p(o)- ‘3pO’ > m(o)‘3sA.3pO’.

(111)

mo-lo-y (2220) 3sA.3pO-wet-PST ‘he wet them’

(112)

mi-po-koly-aõ (2916) 2sA-3pO-love-IA ‘you love them’

An interesting case is <incollan>, which, according to Pedro de la Mata, means ‘He loves us’: i-n-koly-aõ ‘3sA-1pO-love-IA’. The prefix -n- should then refer to a first
person plural, which would be anomalous. However, the form may be mistaken for

210

i-õoly-aõ: 3sA-3sO.love-IA ‘he loves him/her/it’. Another possibility would be that -k-k is automatically replaced by -õ-k).
In the following table the object markers are summarized.

7.2.4. Prefix order As stated before, in a verb form personal reference markers occur before the verb stem, and agent markers normally precede object markers: A-O-stem. However, when the agent is a second person and the object the first person plural, the latter precedes the former: 1pO-2A-stem(-SE)(-ha). This reversed order may cause ambiguity. For instance, the form

(113)

ki-m-koly-aõ (1664) 1pO-2sA-love-IA ‘you love us’

can also be interpreted as 1pA-2sO-love-IA ‘We love you’. In addition, the second person agent marker can be followed by the applicative marker -(h)a, which then relates to the first person plural object:

(114)

ki-sak ki-m-a-pu…-aõ (1689) 1pPOS-food 1pO-2sA-APL-put.down-IA ‘You put down our food [for us]’.

In the alternative case, the applicative marker (see section 7.2.5) is suffixed to the object marker, not to the subject or agent marker: S/A-O-APL-stem, so that the example above would be interpreted as 1pPOS-food 1pA-2sO-APL-put.down-IA ‘We put down our food [for you]’. When the context does not clearly bring forward that the second person is the agent and not the object, and that the first person plural is

211

the object and not the agent, the verb form can be preceded by a form consisting of a second person pronoun, mi or mi-na-ha, + the suffix combination -tu-p, functioning as an agent marker, in order to clarify that the second person is the agent:

(115)

mi-tu-p ki-m-koly-aõ (1664) 2s-AD-ABL 1pO-2sA-love-IA ‘You love us’.

(116)

mi-na-ha-tu-p

ki-ha…

ki-m-a-tsa…-iy-ha (1681)

2POS-CON-PL-AD-ABL 1pPOS-field 1pO-2A-APL-3sO.see-SE-PL

‘You (p) saw our fields [for us]’.

7.2.5. Applicative The first and second person object markers, the zero-marked third person singular object, the third person plural object marker p(o)-, and the second person subject or agent markers can be followed by the applicative marker -(h)a. The applicative forms which are obtained when -(h)a is attached to a person marker are as follows:

1s: a2sm: m(i)2sf: p(i)3s: ø1p: k(i)2p: m(i)- ... -ha 3p: p(o)-
m(o)-

+ -(h)a+ -(h)a+ -(h)a+ -(h)a+ -(h)a+ -(h)a+ -(h)a- > p-a- + PL -ha + -(h)a- > m-a- + PL -ha

> a> m-a> p-a> ha> k-a> m-a- ... -ha > p-a-ha > m-a-ha

Like mo-, m-a-ha is a nasalized form, the result of a merger of *õ ‘3sO’ + p-a-ha:

(117)

mu…aõ m-a-ha-tiki-aõ (2129) prayer 3sA.3pO-APL-PL-do-IA ‘he prays for them’

Applicative -(h)a occurs with intransitive as well as transitive stems. It is normally combined with an object marker, indicating that the event takes place to the benefit or to the detriment of the person involved:

(118)

ø-a-kot-aõ (555) 3sS-1sO.APL-be-IA ‘it is for me’/ ‘I have’

212

(119)

However, in the case of the inversion of second person subject or agent and first person plural object (see section 7.2.4) the applicative marker -(h)a, indicating that the event takes place to the benefit/detriment of the object, is then not suffixed to the object marker but to the subject or agent marker (see also the examples in section 7.2.4):

7.2.6. Person markers t- and p-/mIn addition to the form -ha ‘3sO.AP’ which indicates a third person singular indirect object, prejudiced person or beneficiary, Cholón also disposes of a third person singular beneficiary marker: t-. The difference between -ha and t- is that the former can indicate both a beneficiary and a non-beneficiary, and that it is anaphoric. It refers to a person which has been mentioned before. The latter, on the other hand, indicates a beneficiary only, and it is non-anaphoric:

(126)

a-t-hil-aõ (2136) 1sA-3sB-speak-IA ‘I intercede for him/her’

The person marker p-/m- also refers to a person who benefits from the event. A distinction between the applicative markers and the prefix p-/m- is that the latter is reflexive: it is used to indicate that the beneficiary is the subject itself. The prefix p/m- can also function as a reciprocal person marker when the subject is plural. De la Mata gives six examples. In five forms p-/m- refers to a first person, and in one, exceptional, form p-/m- refers to a third person plural. According to these examples, the form p- occurs before a verb stem which has h, y, ly in initial position; m- is used when the verb stem begins with k, or m (< *p). The nasalization of p- before k and *p may have resulted from dissimilation: p- is employed before a continuant and a lateral; m- before a stop and a nasal (see section 5.6). Examples:

(127) (129) (131)

a-p-hina-õ (2066) 1sS-1sB-hear-IA ‘I hear for myself’

(128)

…i-m-meny-aõ (2069) 3pS-3pREC-want-IA ‘they want each other’

This last form is exceptional because of the modified stem-initial consonant of the verb stem -meny-. Normally, it indicates a third person singular object, which is not
the case here, because the verb is reciprocal and reciprocal verbs are intransitive (see section 7.2). Regularly, the stem would have had p in initial position: -peny-.
For a possible explanation of the occurrence of initial m instead of p, see section 5.6.

214

7.2.7. Overview In the previous sections (7.2.1 - 7.2.6) we have seen that the person marker aoccurring in a verb form can indicate a subject, agent, direct object and applicative object; that m(i)-, p(i)-, k(i)-, m(i)- ... -ha are used to indicate a subject, agent and direct object; that they turn into an applicative object by means of the suffix -a; and that there are several forms to mark a third person subject, agent, object or beneficiary. Table 7.4 shows the third person markers indicating a subject, agent and object, including the zero-marked third person singular. In this overview, the prefix õ-, indicating a third person singular, also represents the underlying velar nasal of the modified stem-initials m, õ, ts, s. Since the form m(o)- ‘3pO’ equals p(o)‘3pO’ + an underlying õ- ‘3sS/A/O’, represented in the table, this form is not included.

7.3. Stems The stem of a verb can be simple, compound or derived. A compound stem is formed by means of an incorporated (pre-root) noun or bound (post-root) verb, a derived stem by means of a derivational suffix. Simple, compound and derived stems are either vocalic or consonantal: vocalic stems end in e, a or o, consonantal stems in a consonant. These stems can be followed by suffixes expressing aspect, tense, mood, subordination, etc. Simple stems are treated in section 7.3.1 and 7.3.2; compound stems in section 7.3.3; derived stems in section 7.3.4.
A majority of the stems can be reduced either by means of the omission of their last segment, or by means of vowel internal suppression: the vocalic stems and the stems in h can drop their ending, the other consonantal stems can suppress their stem vowel. Reduction occurs when the stem is followed by the incompletive aspect marker -(a)õ, the stem extension and past tense markers -(i)y and -e(y), or the derivational suffix -(k)e(h) ‘causativizer’. Regularly, the vowel of a consonantal stem is also suppressed when the stem is followed by the purposive subordinator -(e)…. (The suffix -(e)… can also function as a factivizer. When it is used as such it is attached to a non-reduced stem, see below and section 7.4.6.4).
Stems which are not reduced are the following:

215

(i) a ‘(to) do’, … ‘(to) give birth’, es ‘(to) enter’, luyum ‘(to) suffer’, lyup ‘(to) eat/swallow something’, puily ‘(to) fall’, šay…/šayš ‘(to) whip’, šepos ‘(to) blow’;
(ii) ki ‘(to) become’ or ending in ki: ayki ‘(to) stay’, haki ‘(to) think’, lusaki ‘(to)
pity’, tiki ‘(to) be(come)’; (iii) compound stems formed by means of the bound verbs -pits ‘(to) do while
passing by’ and -pul ‘(to) rest from’; (iv) derived stems formed by means of the suffix -its ‘passivizer’;
(v) stems with an impersonal use, but for pak(o)t ‘(there) is’.

7.3.1. Reducible stems In the preceding section we have seen that a number of simple stems are not liable to reduction. There may be more non-reducible stems. However, the available data of a great number of other verbs is not enough to decide whether the stem of these verbs is reducible or not. We have also seen that, regularly, the stem of an impersonal verb is not reduced. When the verbs k(o)t ‘(to) be’, ly(a)w/lya ‘(to) go (away)’ and t(o)õ ‘(to) be (seated)’ are used impersonally, their stem is kot, lyaw/lya and toõ, respectively.
On the basis of their morphological behaviour (the shape of their stems, the way they are reduced and the use of the suffixes -(a)õ ‘incompletive aspect marker’, -e(y) ‘stem extension and past tense marker’, -(i)y/-w ‘stem extension and past tense marker’, -(e)… ‘factivizer’, ‘purposive subordinator’, -(k)e(h) ‘causativizer’) verbs with a reducible stem can be divided into five classes: 1: verbs like k(o)t ‘(to) be’, with a consonantal stem other than h. They can be reduced by vowel suppression when the stem is preceded by a person marker indicating the subject and followed by the suffixes -(a)õ, -e(y), -(i)y, -(e)…, functioning as a purposive subordinator, or -(k)e(h). Verbs of this class have an intransitive stem which can be transitivized by means of causativizer -(k)e(h). The verb k(o)t ‘(to) be’ never occurs with causativizer -(k)e(h), but other verbs, such as t(u)p ‘(to) walk’, do. Examples:

(133)

ø-kot-aõ (292) 3sS-be-IA ‘he is’

(134)

ke-kt-e-õ (293) 1pS-be-PST-IA ‘we were’

(135)

me-kt-iy (297) 2sS-be-PST ‘you were’

(136)

a-kt-e… (423) 1sS-be-PURP ‘so that I am’

(137)

a-ø-tp-eh-t-aõ (934) 1sA-3sO-walk-CAU-F-IA ‘I shall cause him/her/it to walk’

2: verbs with a consonantal stem in h, e.g. hia(h) ‘(to) wait for’, pil…i(h) ‘(to) break’, lo(h) ‘(to) wet’ and tsu(h) ‘(to) anoint someone/something’. These verbs drop the

216

ending h before the incompletive aspect marker -(a)õ and stem extender -(i)y: *hiah-aõ > hia-õ, *hiah-iy > hia-y. Stem extender -e(y) does not occur with verbs of this class, and subordinator -(e)… is not directly suffixed to the verb stem, but to the future marker -(k)t(e). Class 2 verbs can be transitive as well as intransitive. An intransitive stem can be causativized by -(k)e(h) ‘causativizer’, a transitive stem by -ka(h) ‘indirect causativizer’. The latter suffix is regularly attached to a non-reduced stem. (Although preterite forms of verbs in i(h) have not been found, we may assume that they also drop h before -(i)y). Examples:

(138)

a-mil…i-õ (2859) 1sA-3sO.break-IA ‘I break him/her/it’

(139)

a-ø-lo-õ (962) 1sA-3sO-wet-IA ‘I wet it’

a-ø-lo-y (963) 1sA-3sO-wet-PST ‘I wet it’

(140)

a-ø-tsu-õ (974) 1sA-3sO-anoint-IA ‘I anoint him/her/it’

a-ø-tsu-y (976) 1sA-3sO-anoint-PST ‘I anointed him/her/it’

(141)

a-ø-loh-t-e… (966) 1sA-3sO-wet-F-PURP ‘so that I wet him/her/it’

(142)

a-hina-ke-õ (1582) 1sS-hear-CAU-IA ‘I cause to hear’

a-ø-tsuh-ka-õ (980) 1sA-3sO-anoint-ICA-IA ‘I cause him/her/it to anoint’

3: verbs like kol(e) ‘(to) love’ and pal(e) with a vocalic stem ending in e. This
ending is dropped when the stem is followed by the incompletive aspect marker -(a)õ and by the stem extenders -(i)y and -e(y); lateral l, the segment preceding the ending e, is then palatalized: *kole-(a)õ > koly-aõ; *kole-(i)y > koly-iy; *kole-e > koly-e. The suffix -(e)… ‘factivizer’ is suffixed to the non-reduced stem in e and -(e)…
‘purposive subordinator’ to future marker -(k)t(e). Verbs of class 3 are transitive,
and are causativized by means of the suffix -ka(h). Examples:

(143)

a-õoly-aõ (685) < õol(e) ‘(to) love someone/something’ 1sA-3sO.love-IA ‘I love him/her/it’

(144)

a-õoly-iy (691) 1sA-3sO.love-PST ‘I loved him/her/it’

(145)

a-õoly-e-õ (691) 1sA-3sO.love-PST-IA ‘I loved him/her/it’

217

(146) (148)

a-õole-… (758) 1sA-3sO.love-FAC ‘that I love him/her/it’
a-õole-ka-õ (867) 1sA-3sO.love-ICA-IA ‘I cause him/her/it to love’

(147)

a-õole-kt-e… (766) 1sA-3sO.love-F-PURP ‘so that I love him/her/it’

The verb e ‘(to) give’ also belongs to this class: e is also replaced by a palatal articulation and becomes y before -(a)õ. Forms of the verb e containing the stem extenders -e(y) (*a-l-y-e-õ) and -(i)y (*y-iy), viz. in past tense forms, or the ending -kt-e…, have not been encountered. Examples:

(149)

a-l-y-aõ (2004) 1sA-3sO-give-IA ‘I give something’

(150)

a-l-e-ka-õ (2075) 1sA-3sO-give-ICA-IA ‘I cause him/het/it to give’

(151)

a-l-e-…

ø-patsa-kia-õ (2100)

1sA-3sO-give-FAC 3sS-take.all.day-RE-IA

‘I continuously give it’.

4: verbs with a vocalic stem ending in a, such as lam(a) ‘(to) kill’ and pats(a) ‘(to) take all day’. They lose their vocalic ending before the stem extender -(i)y. Before -(a)õ their final vowel is merged with that of the suffix. They are neither encountered with the stem extender -e(y), nor with causativizer -(k)e(h). Factivizer -(e)… is attached to the non-reduced, vocalic stem. Subordinated forms in -e…/-(k)t-e… have not been found, possibly due to lack of data. Verbs belonging to class 4 can be transitive as well as intransitive. Transitive verbs are causativized by means of the suffix -ka(h). No cases of an intransitive verb in a that is causativized have been found. Examples:

(152)

a-ø-lama-õ (2057) 1sA-3sO-kill-IA ‘I kill him/her/it’

(153)

ø-lam-iy-la-õ (2057) 3sO-kill-SE-3pA-IA ‘they kill him/her/it’

(154)

a-ø-lama-ka-õ (2058) 1sA-3sO-kill-ICA-IA ‘I cause him/her/it to kill’

(155)

ø-patsa-õ (2094) 3sS-take.all.day-IA ‘it takes the whole day’

(156)

ø-pats-iy (2094) 3sS-take.all.day-PST ‘it took the whole day’

218

(157)

a-l-o-…

ø-patsa-… (2180)

1sA-3sO-do-FAC 3sS-take.all.day-FAC

‘that I do it all day long’

5: verbs like peny(o) ‘(to) want’ with a vocalic stem ending in o. The stem drops the ending o when followed by the incompletive aspect marker -(a)õ: *penyo-aõ > peny-aõ. The stem extenders and past tense markers -e(y) and -(i)y and causativizer -(k)e(h) do not occur with verbs of this class. The stems of verbs like peny(o) are
extended by means of the suffix -w. This extension marker is suffixed to the stem without omission of the final o. Nominalizer -(e)… is suffixed to the non-reduced stem in o and subordinator -(e)… to the future marker -(k)t(e). Verbs of this class are
transitive and, like those of class 3, they can be causativized by means of the
derivational suffix -ka(h) which is also added to a non-reduced stem. The verb (o)
‘(to) do/make’, which consists of only one segment, also belongs to this class. (This
verb can also function as a verbalizer, see section 7.7). Examples:

(158)

a-meny-aõ (806) < meny(o) ‘(to) want someone/something’ 1sA-3sO.want-IA ‘I want him/her/it’

(159)

õ-a-ø-aõ (1) 3sA-1sO-make-IA ‘he/she/it makes me’

(160)

a-l-o-w-e (2140) 1sA-3sO-do/make-PST-ANT ‘I had done/made him/her/ it’

(161) (162)

a-l-o-ka-õ (2162) 1sA-3sO-do/make-ICA-IA ‘I cause him/her/it to do/make’.
a-menyo-kah-t-aõ (874) 1sA-3sO.want-ICA-F-IA ‘I shall cause him/her/it to want’

For all five subclasses, it holds that the remaining suffixes (not treated above) occur only after a non-reduced stem:

(163) (164) (165) (166) (167) (168) (169)
(170)

mi-kot-i (321) a-õole-khe (723) a-ø-loh-hu (966) mi-ø-loh-te (966) a-kot-lam (431) kot-nap (427) ki-menyo-õo (863)
mi-penyo-wu… (1230)

‘Be!’ ‘May I love him/her/it (!)’ ‘(1s) wetting him/her/it’, ‘that I wet it’ ‘you shall wet it’ ‘(1s) having to be’, ‘that I have to be’ ‘(after) having (been)’, ‘because (it was)’ ‘(3s) having to be wanted by me’, ‘that he/she/it is having to be wanted by me’ ‘your lover’

219

(171) (172) (173) (174)

a-kole-its-aõ (995) a-tsuh-ia-õ (981) a-e-n-aõ (2082) a-kot-p-aõ (462)

‘I am loved’ ‘I anoint him/her/it again’ ‘I give myself’ ‘I am not’

Most of the Cholón verbs belong to class 5. The stems of the five classes of verbs and their characteristics are shown in the table below.

As regards the use of the subordinator and nominalizer -(e)…, we have seen that (i) verbs of class 1 have only one form in -(e)…, a form in which -(e)… ‘subordinator’ is suffixed to the reduced, consonantal stem; (ii) class 2 verbs have also only one form in -(e)…: a form in which subordinator -(e)… occurs after the future marker -(k)t(e); (iii) verbs of class 3 and 5 have two forms in -(e)…: a nominalized form in which -(e)… ‘factivizer’ is attached to the non-reduced, vocalic stem; and a subordinated form in which -(e)… ‘subordinator’ is suffixed to future marker -(k)t(e); (iv) verbs of class 4 have one form in -(e)…. In this form nominalizer -(e)… is also suffixed to the non-reduced, vocalic stem. De la Mata names the forms in -(e)… ‘subjunctives’, which he translates as ‘present participles’ or as subordinates clauses. According to his description, verbs of class 1
and 2 have a second ‘subjunctive’ in -hu, also translated as a ‘present participle’ or a
subordinate clause. The suffix -hu (in fact a subordinator + swith reference, viz. it
indicates that the subject of the form to which it is attached is other than that of the
main verb, see section 7.4.6.1) is attached to a non-reduced stem. Examples:

(175) (177)

mi-toõ-hu (541) 1sS-be.(seated)-SR ‘(1s) being.(seated)’, ‘that I am (seated)’

(176)

a-ø-loh-hu (966) 1sA-3sO-wet-SR ‘(1s) wetting it’, ‘that I wet it’

palyow mi-kot-hu, ok-pit palyow a-kot-t-aõ (399) good 2sS-be-SR 1s-also good 1sS-be-F-IA ‘When you are good, I shall also be good’. (literally: ‘You being good, me too, I shall be good’).

Verbs like ts(a)m(o) ‘(to) know/acknowledge/realize’ are hybrids. They have characteristics of a verb both of class 5 and class 1. Like a verb of class 5, ts(a)m(o)
e.a. have (i) a vocalic stem in o which is dropped before the suffix -(a)õ:

(178)

a-tsm-aõ (938) 1sA-3sO.know-IA ‘I know something’

cf.

a-tsmo-… (939)

1sA-3sO.know-FAC

‘that I know something’

cf. a-tsmo-lam-he (941) 1sA-3sO.know-FN1-BEN ‘that I have to know something’

cf.

a-tsmo-õo-ke (939)

1sA-3sO.know-FN2-ANT

‘that I would have known it’

(ii) an o-stem which is extended by means of the stem extender and past tense marker -w:

(179)

a-tsmo-w (939) 1sA-3sO.know-PST ‘I knew something’

(iii)a nominalized form in -(e)… and a subordinated form form in -kt-e…:

(180)

a-tsmo-… (939) 1sA-3sO.know-FAC ‘that I know something’

(181)

a-tsmo-kt-e… (939) 1sS-3sO.know-F-PURP ‘so that I know something’

221

However, they also behave like a verb of class 1. Like k(o)t ‘(to) be, ts(a)m(o) e.a. have (i) a consonantal stem which is reduced by means of suppression of the stem vowel (see the examples above); (ii) stem reduction does not take place when the stem is not preceded by a person prefix:

(182)

ø-tsam-aõ (938) 3sS-3sO.know-IA ‘he knows something’

cf. mi-tsm-aõ (938) 2sS-3sO.know-IA ‘you know something’

(iii) it can be causativized by means of the derivational suffix -(k)e(h), attached to the reduced consonantal stem:

(183)

i-tsm-e-õ (944) 3sA-3sO.know-CAU-IA ‘he causes to know it’/’he teaches it’

In addition, ts(a)m(o) has the following particularities: (i): a stem consisting of two parts: a consonantal part: ts(a)m, and a vocalic part: o; (ii): the consonantal part is not only reduced when it is followed by -(a)õ ‘incompletive aspect’ and -(k)e(h) ‘causative’, but also when it is followed by the
vocalic part o or by other suffixes;
(iii): although it looks like a transitive verb, it partly behaves like an intransitive verb. Like a transitive stem, it has a modified stem-initial consonant (ts < y: ts(a)m(o) < y(a)m ‘(to) know’), normally indicating a third person direct object (see
section 7.2.3), and it is causativized by means of the suffix -ka(h):

(184)

a-tsmo-ka-õ (942) 1sA-3sO.know-ICA-IA ‘I cause to know something’

On the other hand, like an intransitive verb, third person singular (subject or agent)
is not marked on the verb and third person plural is marked by means of i- (see the examples ø-tsam-aõ ‘he knows something’ and i-tsm-aõ ‘they know something’ above). In addition, ts(a)m(o) is also causativized by means of the suffix -(k)e(h),
which is usually limited to intransitive verbs. It then behaves as a regular transitive
verb: the modified stem-initial consonant then indicates a third person singular
object; third person singular agent is indicated by means of the prefix i- (see the example i-tsm-e-õ ‘He causes to know it’/’He teaches it’ above), and third person plural agent by means of the suffix -la:

(We may assume that the verb p(V)t(o) ‘(to) swim’, which only occurs once in the data, also belongs to the group of hybrids:

(188)

a-pto-kte-he (2900) 1sS-swim-INF-BEN ‘that I swim’).

7.3.2. Irregularities The following stems present some irregularities: 1: The verb (a)n(a)/nan ‘(to) come’ has three stems: a regular stem n(a), and two irregular stems: an and nan. The stem n(a), n before the past tense marker and stem extender -(i)y and na elsewhere, is used with the first and second person singular and plural, and with the third person plural. Examples:

(189)

a-na-õ (2451) 1sS-come-IA ‘I come’

(190)

a-n-iy (2886) 1sS-come-PST ‘I came’

(191)

mi-na-e-ha-õ (2813) 2S-come-SE-PL-IA ‘you (p) come’

(192)

mi-n-iy-ha-õ (422) 2S-come-SE-PL-IA ‘you (p) come’

(193)

…i-na-õ (785) 3pS-come-IA ‘they come’

(194)

…i-n-iy (1586) 3pS-come-PST ‘they came’

The stem an occurs after the first person plural marker a-. It is once found after the third person plural marker …i-:

(195)

a-an-aõ (2333) 1sS-come-IA ‘I come’

(196)

…i-an-nap (780) 3pS-come-SEQ ‘(after) they have come’

The stem nan is used in third person singular forms:

223

(197)

ø-nan-iy (2649) 3sS-come-PST ‘he came’

(198)

ø-nan-t-aõ (342) 3sS-come-F-IA ‘he will come’

2: The verb h(i)l ‘(to) say’, ‘(to) speak’ has a second stem: hila. This stem appears before the causativizer -(k)e(h). Regularly, this suffix is attached to a reduced stem (cf. hina < hinah ‘(to) hear’ below):

(199)

a-hila-ke-õ (1583) 1sS-speak-CAU-IA ‘I cause to speak’

(200)

opey-lol

mo-hina-ke-y

mo-hila-ke-y-pit (1584)

deaf-mutes-PL 3sA.3pO-hear-CAU-PST 3sA.3pO-speak-CAU-PST-COR

‘The deaf-mutes, he made them hear and speak’.

3: The verb hintsiw/ hintsi ‘(to) talk’ has a long stem in w and a reduced stem in a vowel (cf. ly(a)w/ lya, item 6 below). It occurs in three different verb forms in the data: in a past tense form in -(i)y, in a nominalized form in -(õ)o, and in a derived causative form. However, it is the long, non-reduced, stem which is used before the
suffixes -(i)y ‘past tense’ and -(k)e(h) ‘causativizer’, regularly attached to a reduced stem; and it is the short, reduced, stem which is used before future nominlizer -(õ)o, regularly attached to a non-reduced stem:

(201)

mi-hintsiw-iy (1328) 2sS-talk-PST ‘you talked’

(202)

a-hintsiw-e-ka-õ (2052) 1sS-talk-CAU-ICA-IA ‘I am joking’

(203)

a-hintsi-õo (1612) 1sS-talk-FN2 ‘that I talk’

4: The verbs lam(a) ‘(to) kill’ and t(a) ‘(to) do’ (class 4) also have a second stem: lamih and to, respectively. This second stem does not occur before a stem reducing suffix, such as -(a)õ ‘incompletive aspect marker’ and -(i)y ‘stem extender’. The stem lamih is found in the derived noun ašwa lamih-u… (fish kill-AG) ‘fisher’ (1423), the reflexive stem lamih-n(o) (kill-RFL) ‘(to) kill oneself’ (2139), and in the following example:

(204)

ašwa mi-po-lamih-te-he mi-lya-pe-kt-aõ …oti (2820) fish 2sA-3pO-kill-INF-BEN 2sS-go-NE-F-IA I.bet ‘I bet that you will not going to fish’.

224

The stem to- is only found in future tense forms with the benefactive marker t- or the applicative marker -(h)a:

(205)

mu…aõ ki-p-a-ha-to-kt-aõ (2130) prayer 1pS-3pO-APL-PL-do-F-IA ‘we shall pray for them’

cf. a-ø-ta-kt-aõ (2119) 1sA-3sO-do-F-IA ‘I shall do it’

(206)

mu…aõ ke-t-to-kt-aõ (2131) prayer 1pA-3sB-do-F-IA ‘we shall pray for him’

It should furthermore be noticed that t(a)/to is used in fixed expressions and in combina-tion with a noun, see section 7.8.

5: Two verbs have a stem in y: lusay ‘(to) be sad’ and maksay ‘(to) be happy’. The verb maksay is probably related to makhay ‘happiness’. Both verbs lose y before the derivational suffix -(k)ia(h) ‘reiterative’:

(207)

a-lusa-kia-õ (1568) 1sS-be.sad-RE-IA ‘I regret’

cf. m-a-lusay-ki (2323) 2sS-1sO.APL-be.sad-IMP ‘Pity me!’

(208)

ø-maksa-kian-ko (1634) 3sS-be.happy-RE-DEM ‘he who rejoices’

cf. ø-maksay-kt-aõ (1633) 3sS-be.happy-F-IA ‘he will rejoice’

6: The verb ly(a)w/lya ‘(to) go (away)’ also has two stems: ly(a)w and lya. It is not the short stem lya which occurs before the incompletive aspect marker -(a)õ and the stem extenders -e(y) and -(i)y, as might be expected, but the elongated stem, ly(a)w.
The latter form is then normally reduced by suppression of the stem vowel when preceded by a person marker and (i) followed by -(a)õ ‘incompletive aspect
marker’; (ii) by the stem extension and past tense markers -e(y) and -(i)y; (iii) the by purposive subordinator -(e)… (see the verbs of class 1):

(209) (210) (211) (212) (213) (214)

a-lyw-aõ ø-lyaw-aõ a-lyw-iy
ki-lyw-iy-e
mi-lyw-e-õ a-lyw-e…

‘I go’ (904) ‘he goes’ (9045) ‘I went’ (905) ‘we had gone’ (906) ‘you went’ (905) ‘so that I go’ (914)

The short stem lya is used before other suffixes, such as the imperative marker -(k)(i), the future marker -(k)t(e), and the nominalizers -(e)…, -lam, -(õ)o:

(215)

lya-k (909) go-IMP ‘Go!’

225

(216)

a-lya-kt-aõ (907) 1sS-go-F-IA ‘I shall go’

(217)

a-lya-kt-e… (914) 1sS-go-F-PURP ‘so that I go’

(218)

a-lya-… (913) 1sS-go-FAC ‘that I go’

(219)

a-lya-lam ø-kot-nap (916) 1sS-go-FN1 3sS-be-SEQ ‘because I have to go’

(220)

a-lya-õo-ke (911) 1sS-go-FN2-ANT ‘that I had to go’

The verb ly(a)w/lya thus has three forms ending in -(e)…:
(i) a subordinated form and a nominalized form in which -(e)… is directly preceded by a the stem ly(a)w- , see the examples a-lyw-e… above;
(ii) a subordinated form and a nominalized form in which -(e)… is directly preceded by the stem lya-, see the example a-lya-… above; (iii) a subordinated form in which -(e)… is preceded by the stem lya + future marker -(k)t(e) (see the example a-lyak-te-e… above). Unlike a verb of class 1, ly(a)w/lya thus does not have a ‘second subjunctive’ in -hu,
but like a verb of class 3 and 5, it has a second subordinated form in -(k)t-e…. The verb ly(a)w/lya ‘(to) go (away)’ can also function as an impersonal verb
when preceded by an applicative object (see section 7.2.3):

(221)

ø-a-lyaw-aõ (1815) 3sS-1sO.APL-go.way-IA ‘it goes away from me’

(222)

ø-m-a-lyaw-iy (1827) 3sS-2sO-APL-go.away-PST ‘it went away from you’

(223)

ø-a-lyaw-e… (1836) 3sS-1sO.APL-go.away-PURP ‘so that it goes away from me’

Before the imperative marker -(k)he, the future marker -(k)t(e), and the nominalizer -(k)te, the form lyaw-e(y), consisting of the stem lyaw + stem extender -e(y), is
encountered:

(224)

ø-k-a-lyaw-e-khe (1826) 3sS-1pO-APL-go.away-SE-IMP ‘May it go away from us!’

(225)

ø-m-a-lyaw-ey-ha-kte (1826) 3sS-2O-APL-go.away-SE-PL-F ‘it will go away from you (p)’

226

(226)

ø-p-a-ha-lyaw-e-kte-ke (1828) 3sS-3pO-APL-PL-go.away-SE-INF-ANT ‘that it had to go away from them’

Impersonal lya is only found before the nominalizers -(e)… and -(õ)o:

(227)

ø-a-lya-… (1835)

(228)

3sS-1sO.APL-go.away-FAC

‘that it goes away from me’

ø-a-lya-õo-ke (1827) 3sS-1sO.APL-go.away-FN2-ANT ‘that it had gone away from me’

When ly(a)w/lya is used impersonally, it thus also has two forms in -(e)…: a subordinated form (see the examples ø-a-lyaw-e… ‘so that it goes away from me’) and a nominalized form (see the example ø-a-lya-… ‘that it goes away from me’); and
it also has an irregular future form (see also section 7.1):

(229)

ø-ha-lyaw-iy-t-aõ (1824) 3sS-3sO.APL-go.away-SE-F-IA ‘it will go away from him’

(cf. hintsiw/ hintsi ‘(to) talk’above. However, in the case of hintsiw/ hintsi, the long stem in w is not reduced before -(i)y, nor before -(k)e(h)).

7: The verb lya(wo)h ‘(to) carry’, ‘(to) take away’ does not drop the ending h before the incompletive aspect marker -(a)õ and the stem extension and past tense marker -(i)y (cf. the verbs of class 2, which do). The stem is reduced by the suppression of the elements -wo:

(230) a-lyah-aõ (917) ‘I carry’. (231) a-lyah-iy (918) ‘I carried’

The non-reduced stem lyawoh is used before other suffixes, as is usual; and, like a verb of class 2, lya(wo)h has a ‘present participle’ or ‘subjunctive’ form in -hu and a
‘second subjunctive’ form in -(k)t-e…:

(232) (233) (234)
(235) (236)

a-lyawoh-t-aõ (919) lyawoh-he (927) a-lyawoh-lam (924)
a-lyawoh-hu (923) a-lyawoh-t-e… (923)

‘I shall carry’ ‘that he carries’ ‘(1s) having to carry’, ‘my future carrying’, ‘that I have to carry’ ‘that I carry’ ‘so that I carry’

8: The verb ‘(to) sow’ has an irregular stem: m(ih) instead of *mi(h). Regularly, consonantal stems in h are reduced by means of the suppression of the ending h (see class 2 verbs, which drop the ending h before the imperfective aspect marker -(a)õ,

227

the past tense marker -(i)y, and causativizer -(k)e(h)). However, the stem of this verb is reduced by means of the suppression of both the segment h and the preceding segment i before the imperfective aspect marker -(a)õ (past tense forms nor causative forms of m(ih) have not been found):

(237)

a-m-aõ (2007) 1sS-sow-IA ‘I sow’

(238)

mi-m-aõ (2962) 2sS-sow-IA ‘you sow’

(239)

a-mih-ia-õ (2008) 1sS-sow-RE-IA ‘I sow again’

9: The verbs ših ‘(to) drink’ and nyih ‘(to) take away’ have a second stem: š(i)k and ny(i)k, respectively. The vowel i of š(i)k is regularly suppressed when this stem is preceded by a person marker and followed by the incompletive aspect marker -(a)õ, the stem extension and past tense markers -(i)y and -e(y), and the causativizer
-(k)e(h). Before other suffixes the stem ših is used:

(240)

i-ø-šk-aõ (951) 3sA-3sO-drink-IA ‘he drinks it’

(241)

mi-ø-šk-iy-ha-õ (951) 2A-3sO-drink-SE-PL-IA ‘they drink it’

(242)

a-ø-šk-ey (952) 1sA-3sO-drink-PST ‘I drank it’

(243)

mi-ø-šk-e-õ (953) 2sA-3sO-drink-CAU-IA ‘you caused him/her/it to drink’

(244)

a-ø-ših-hu (965) 1sS-3sO-drink-SR ‘that I drink it’

(245)

a-ø-ših-t-e… (952) 1sA-3sO-drink-F-PURP ‘so that I drink it’

In the case of the verb nyih/ny(i)k ‘(to) take away’, only two forms have been encountered: one form with the reducible stem ny(i)k and another form with the nonreducible stem nyih. The former has been found in a first person incompletive aspect
form, the latter in an imperative form:

(246)

a-ø-nyk-aõ (2781) 1sA-3sO-take.away-IA ‘I take it away’

(247)

ø-nyih-ø (2782) 3sO-take.away-IMP ‘Take it away!’

By analogy with ših/š(i)k ‘(to) drink (something)’, it is likely that ny(i)k, the second stem of nyih, was also used before the stem extension and past tense markers -(i)y
and -e(y) and maybe also before the causativizer -(k)e(h). Since both verbs have a
consonantal stem which can be reduced by the suppression of the stem vowel before

228

the suffix -(a)õ (and, in the case of ših/ š(i)k, also before -(i)y and -(k)e(h)), and since ših/š(i)k (and, possibly, also nyih/ny(i)k) can be causativized by means of the
causativizer -(k)e(h), they behave like a verb of class 1. The main difference
between these two verbs and those of class 1, is that the former are transitive,
whereas the latter are intransitive. Furthermore, ših - unlike a class 1 verb, but like a verb of class 2 - has a form in -(k)t-e….

10: The derived verb ših-iah ‘(to) drink again’ has irregular second person plural and third person plural agent forms. In finite verb forms the plural marker -ha and the third person plural agent marker -la, regularly precede the derivational suffix -(k)ia(h) (see section 7.1 and 7.2.2, respectively). In nominalized or subordinated verb forms, however, -ha and -la follow this suffix:

(248)

mi-ø-ših-ha-kia-õ (955) 2A-3sO-drink-PL-RE-IA ‘you drink it again’

cf. mi-ø-ših-iah-ha-õo-ke (959) 2A-3sO-drink-RE-PL-FN2-ANT ‘that you (p) drank it again’

(249)

ø-ših-la-kia-y (956) 3sO-drink-3pA-RE-PST ‘they drank it again’

cf. ø-ših-iah-la-… (960) 3sO-drink-RE-3pA-FAC ‘that they drink it again’

(250)

ø-ših-la-kiah-t-aõ (957) 3sO-drink-3pA-RE-F-IA ‘they will drink it again’

cf. ø-ših-iah-la-kt-e… (960) 3sO-drink-RE-3pA-F-PURP ‘so that they will drink it again’

11: The stem of the verb t(o)õ ‘(to) be (seated)’, ‘(to) sit’ (class 1) is regularly reduced by means of vowel suppression when preceded by a person marker and followed by the incompletive aspect marker -(a)õ, the stem extension and past tense markers -e(y) and -(i)y, and the purposive subordinator -(e)…. However, third person singular and plural have irregular forms: (i): in the incompletive aspect form, third person singular and plural are not followed by the incompletive aspect marker -(a)õ; (ii): in the incompletive aspect form and in a past tense form in -(i)y, third person plural has a non-reduced stem:

(251)

a-tõ-aõ (505) ‘I am/sit’ ø-toõ (507) ‘he is/sits’ i-toõ (510) ‘they are/sit’

a-tõ-iy (511) ‘I was/sat’ i-toõ-iy (516) ‘they were/sat’ a-tõ-e… (515) ‘so that I am/sit’

When the verb toõ is used impersonally, it has not only just one stem, but it also lacks the ending -(a)õ in the incompletive aspect forms of first and third person singular and plural, and of second person singular:

229

(252)

ø-a-toõ (641) 3sS-1sO.APL-be ‘it is there for me’/ ‘there is for me’/ ‘I have’

(253) ø-m-a-toõ (642) 3sS-2sO-APL-be ‘there is for you’/ ‘you have’

(254)

ø-ha-toõ (643) 3sS-3sO.APL-be ‘there is for him’/ ‘he has’

(255) ø-k-a-toõ (644) 3sS-1pO-APL-be ‘there is for us’/ ‘we have’

(256)

ø-p-a-ha-toõ (646) 3sS-3pO-APL-PL-be ‘there is for them’/ ‘they have’

cf. ø-m-a-toõ-iy-ha-õ (945) 3sS-2O-APL-be-SE-PL-IA ‘there is for you (p)’/ ‘you (p) have’

12: Normally, the stem of the verb t(u)p ‘(to) walk’ is regularly reduced before the imperfective aspect marker -(a)õ, the stem extension and past tense marker -(i)y/-w and causativizer -(k)e(h) (cf. the stems of class 1 verbs). However, in the ALC two conjugations of this verb are encountered and in both conjugations occur some irregularities. In the first conjugation of t(u)p ‘(to) walk’ two irregular forms with non-reduced stems are found: one irregular form in the imperfective aspect paradigm, and another irregular form in the causative paradigm:

(257)

u-tup-aõ (931) 3pS-walk-IA ‘they walk’

(258)

u-ø-tup-e-õ (933) 3sA-3sO-walk-CAU-IA ‘he/she/it causes him/her/it to walk’

In the causative paradigm, we find a second u-ø-tup-e-õ form, indicating the third person plural ‘they cause him/her/it to walk’. This second form must be a slip of the pen. A third person plural agent is namely indicated by means of the suffix -la, and the correct form should therefore be ø-tup-e-y-la-õ ‘they cause him/her/it to walk’, as indicated in the second conjugation of t(u)p ‘(to) walk’.
In the second conjugation we find, on the other hand, the following irregular paradigm:

a-tup-aõ mu-tup-aõ u-tp-aõ ku-tup-aõ mu-tup-iy-ha-õ tup-iy-la-õ

‘I walk’ ‘you walk’ ‘he/she/it walks’ ‘we walk’ ‘you (p) walk’ ‘they walk’

This paradigm is irregular because

230

(i) first and second person singular and plural also have a non-reduced stem instead
of a reduced one;
(ii) third person singular and plural have the shape of transitive forms: the person prefix u- in u-tp-aõ and the person suffix -la in tup-iy-la-õ indicate, respectively, a third person singular agent and a third person plural agent. The regular intransitive counterparts of u-tp-aõ and tup-iy-la-õ would have been tup-aõ (1151), as encountered in the first conjugation, and *u-tp-aõ, respectively. In addition, t(u)p ‘(to) walk’ does not have a purposive form in -(e)… like the other class 1 verbs, but it does have a purposive form in -(k)t-e…, which the other verbs of this class lack:

(259)

a-tup-t-e… (932) 1sS-walk-F-PURP ‘so that I walk’

13: In his grammar, de la Mata presents two conjugations of the passive verb ‘(to)
be made’: a regular conjugation, occurring at the beginning of his grammar, in Book
1, fol. 85/86, and a second, irregular, conjugation in Book 3, fol. 189. In the former conjugation, the derived stem is regularly o-its ‘make-PAS’ (see the example above, and see the examples in section 7.3.4.1). In the latter, the stem lo-its instead of o-its
is encountered:

(260) (261) (262)

a-lo-its-aõ (2161) a-lo-its-iy (2161) a-lo-its-t-aõ (2161)

‘I am made’ ‘I was made’ ‘I shall be made’

In addition, the third person plural of the imperfective aspect has an active form, viz. it contains the third person plural agent marker -la, instead of …i- ‘pS’: lo-its-la-õ ‘they are made’, instead of …i-o-its-aõ. The third person singular, on the other hand, has the regular form: l-o-its-aõ. It is possible that in the non-regular forms the initial segment l- of the stem lo- was no longer considered as a grammatical element,
indicating a third person singular object, but rather as an inseparable part of the
(intransitive) stem. By contrast, the third person plural agent marker -la in the irregular third person plural passive form lo-its-la-õ seems to favour the interpretation of l- as an object marker. (The existence of competing forms for the
passive of (o) ‘(to) do’ leaves open the possibility that some of these forms may
have been constructed by the author).
14: Normally, the derivational suffix -ka(h) ‘indirect causativizer’ is suffixed to a non-reduced stem. However, three stems in h: lupoh-, pištoh-, tsm-eh, lose this
segment before -ka(h). The loss of h may have occurred on the analogy of the suffix
-(k)e(h) ‘causativizer’, which also causativizes and is attached to a reduced stem:

231

(263)

a-tsm-e-ka-õ (950) 1sA-3sO.know-CAU-ICA-IA ‘I cause to let know it’, ‘I cause to teach it’

1sPOS-name/honour 3sA-1sO-break/lose/nullify-ICA-IA

‘He causes me to lose my honour’.

15: Regularly, the future marker -(k)t(e) is attached to a non-reduced stem. In one example, it was found suffixed to the stem extender -w:

(266)

mi-špo-w-t-aõ (2949) 2sS-be.free-SE-F-IA ‘you will be free’

cf. mi-špo-kt-aõ (2849) 2sS-be.free-F-IA ‘you will be free’

16: In six forms an element k, and in one form an element h were found inserted after a or o. In these forms, k and h appear to have no grammatical function. Possibly, they may have represented a glottal stop (see section 4.3.3 and 4.3.10.2):

(267)

7.3.3. Compound stems There are two kinds of compound stems in Cholón: 1, compound stems consisting of a nominal stem and a verb stem (cf. the form a-mna-y…-aõ ‘I watch the way’ in section 7.1); 2, compound stems consisting of a verb stem and a bound stem:

(274)

i-l-o-…up-aõ (2169) 3sA-3sO-do-do.tenderly-IA ‘he does it tenderly’

7.3.3.1. Compound stems formed by means of a noun A compound stem can be formed by the incorporation of a nominal stem into the verb. The incorporated noun undergoes the same processes of vowel reduction and stem alternation as a free noun (see the form a-mna-y…-aõ < *a-pana-y…-aõ ‘I watch the way’). Nouns referring to body parts seem to be particularly suitable for compounding. They are found in most of the compound stems. Alongside the noun pana ‘road’ mentioned above, the following incorporated nouns have been found: lu ‘interior’, ‘intestines’:

(275)

šalya-maõ kuka pu…

ø-lu-kt-aõ (1196)

basket-INES coka accumulation 3sS-interior-be-IA

‘There is plenty of coca in the basket’.

(276)

alyhi a-lu-pakt-aõ (2653) sweet 1sS-interior-be-IA ‘I am sweet’.

(277)

m-a-lu-po-õ (190) 2sA-1sO-interior-burn-IA ‘you abhor me’

The compound lu-pak(o)t/lu-pok(o)t ‘be inside’ also means ‘(to) think’, ‘(to) remember’, ‘(to) advise’:

(278)

in…a-m mu/pu-lu-pakt-aõ.

Dios-he a-lu-pakt-aõ (163)

7.3.3.2. Compound stems formed by means of a bound verb Bound verbs occur in combination with other verb stems and are attached to the non-reduced form of the latter. Most bound stems are regularly reduced before the suffixes -(a)õ ‘incompletive aspect’ and -(i)y ‘stem extender’, ‘past tense marker’. Bound verbs do not occur with the stem extender -e(y); but they may be followed by a derivational suffix, such as -(k)ia(h) ‘reiterative’. In the examples given by Pedro de la Mata the following bound verbs occur in several semantic categories with the verb stem (o) ‘(to) do’: A. Movement: (1) -…e(h) ‘(to) wander’

(286)

a-l-o-…e-õ (2175) 1sA-3sO-do-wander-IA ‘I do it while wandering’

(287)

a-l-o-…eh-t-aõ (2175) 1sA-3sO-do-wander-F-IA ‘I shall do it while wandering’

The bound verb -…e(h) behaves like a verb of class 2: Vh > V/ _ -(a)õ, -(i)y. It is also found with the verbs t(o)õ ‘(to) be (seated)’ and ki ‘(to) do’:

234

(288)

a-toõ-…e-õ (653) 1sS-be-wander-IA ‘I am wandering’

(289)

…i-ki-…e-õ (2393) 3pS-be-wander-IA ‘they are walking’

2: -pale-kia(h) ‘pace up and down’

(290)

a-l-o-pale-kia-õ (2177) 1sA-3sO-pass.by-RE-IA ‘I do it while pacing up and down’

(291)

a-l-o-pale-kiah-t-aõ (2177) 1sA-3sO-do-pass.by-RE-F-IA ‘I shall do it while pacing up and down’

The stem -pale-kia(h) consists of a bound stem -pale ‘pass by’ and the derivational suffix -(k)ia(h) ‘reiterative’. It also occurs with other verbs, for instance, with the verb mu…e(h) ‘(to) fulfil’:

(292)

mu-mu…-eh-pale-kia-õ (2378) 2sA-3sO.put.down-CAU-pass.by-RE-IA ‘you fill up’

The verb pale ‘(to) pass by’ is also used as a non-bound verb. Its reduced stem is paly, and it belongs to class 2: cf. kole ‘(to) love’, reduced stem koly. When pale/paly
is used as a non-bound stem, it can be followed by the bound stem -pale-kia(h):

(293)

kas male-pale-kia-õ (2378) wind 3sO.pass.by-pass.by-RE-IA ‘The wind blows from all parts’.

When pale is used as a bound verb, it is always followed by -(k)ia(h).

3: -pits ‘(to) pass by’

(294)

a-l-o-pits-aõ (2176) 1sA-3sO-do-pass.by-IA ‘I do it while passing by’

(295)

a-l-o-pits-t-aõ (2176) 1sA-3sO-do-pass.by-IA ‘I shall do it while passing by’

The stem of -pits is never reduced. The bound verb -pits is also found with other verbs:

235

(296)

a-lya-pits-iy-pits-o (793) 1sS-go-pass.by-NE-NOM ‘I did not go’

(297)

a-ø-tuõ-pits-aõ (2087) 1sA-3sO-say-pass.by-IA ‘I say it to him while passing by’

(298)

a-tsa…-pits-aõ (2086) 1sA-3sO.see-pass.by-IA ‘I see it while passing by’

The verb pits ‘(to) pass by’ also occurs as a non-bound verb. It may then be followed by a bound verb. In the example below, pits is followed by its synonym pale:

(299)

tsi mits-pale-kiah-lam (2378) rain 3sS.pass.by-pass.by-RE-FN1 ‘that the rain will pour down from all sides’

B. Manner (1) -…up(o) ‘(to) do tenderly’

(300)

a-l-o-…up-aõ (2169) 1sA-3sO-do-do.tenderly-IA ‘I do it tenderly’

(301)

mi-l-o-…upo-kt-aõ (2169) 2sA-3sO-do-do.tenderly-F-IA ‘you will do it tenderly’

The bound verb -…up(o) behaves like a verb of class 5: o > ø/ _ -(a)õ. It also occurs with other verbs, such as, kole/koly ‘(to) love’ and peny(o) ‘(to) want’:

(302)

a-õole-…up-aõ (2109) 1sA-3sO.love-do.tenderly-IA ‘I love him/her/it tenderly’

(303)

a-menyo-…up-aõ (2110) 1sA-3sO.want-do.tenderly-IA ‘I want him/her/it tenderly’

C. Course of event (1) -k(o)l(oh) ‘(to) finish’

(304)

a-l-o-kol-aõ (2168) 1sA-3sO-do-finish-IA ‘I finish doing it’

(305)

a-l-o-kloh-t-aõ (2169) 1sA-3sO-do-finish-F-IA ‘I shall finish doing it’

The bound verb -k(o)l(oh) is irregular. Its stem is reduced by means of vowel suppression and, in addition to that, by means of the omission of the ending oh. The bound verb -k(o)l(oh) can also occur with the suffix -(k)ia(h): -k(o)loh-ia(h) ‘(to) finish a reiterative event’:

236

(306)

a-l-o-kloh-ia-õ (2178) 1sA-3sO-do/make-finish-RE-IA ‘I finish doing/making it again’

The bound verb -k(o)l(oh) is also found with other stems:

(307)

a-ø-ših-kol-aõ (2083) 1sA-3sO-drink-finish-IA ‘I finish drinking it’

(The stem k(o)l is used as a non-bound verb, meaning ‘(to) die’).

2: -lyuk(oh) ‘(to) have finished’

(308)

a-l-o-lyuk-aõ (2173) 1sA-3sO-do-have.finished-IA ‘I have finished doing it’

(309)

a-l-o-lyukoh-t-aõ (2173) 1sA-3sO-do-have.finished-F-IA ‘I shall have finished doing it’

Like -k(o)l(oh), -lyuk(oh) also drops the segments oh before -(a)õ and -(i)y. The stem -lyuk(oh) has not been found with other verbs, but it has been found functioning as a non-bound verb. In that case, the vowel u stead of the segment oh is suppressed when the stem is preceded by a person marker. (The suppressed stem vowel u is then copied by the vowel of the person marker):

(310)

ø-lyuk-aõ (2548) 3sS-have.finished-IA ‘It finishes’

(311)

ku-ø-ly koh-iy-nap (2549) 1pA-3sO-have.finished-SE-SEQ ‘after having finished it’

3: -mul(o) ‘(to) begin’, ‘(to) start’

(312)

a-l-o-mul-aõ (2172) 1sA-3sO-do-start-IA ‘I start doing it’

(313)

a-l-o-mulo-kt-aõ (2172) 1sA-3sO-do-start-F-IA ‘I shall start doing it’

The bound verb -mul(o) behaves like a verb of class 5: o > ø/ _ -(a)õ. It has also been found with other verbs:

(314)

tsi mahat-mulo-w (2549) (315) rain 3sS.fall.down-start-PST ‘The rain started to fall down’.

ø-seh-mul-aõ (2081) 3sS-grow-start-IA ‘it (seed) starts to grow’

237

4: -pul ‘(to) rest from’

(316)

a-l-o-pul-aõ (2174) 1sA-3sO-do-rest.from-IA ‘I rest from doing it’

(317)

a-l-o-pul-t-aõ (2174) 1sA-3sO-do-rest-F-IA ‘I shall rest from doing it’

The stem of -pul is never reduced. It has only been found with the verb (o) ‘(to) do’.

5: -šipe/*-šipeh ‘(to) break off’, ‘(to) nearly do’ A non-reduced stem of -šipe has not been found. It may be *-šipeh. The stem -šipe has not been found with the verb (o) ‘(to) do’. The following examples illustrate the use of -šipe/*-šipeh ‘(to) break off’/’(to) nearly do’ with other verb stems:

(318)

a-tsap-šipe-õ (2091) 1sA-3sO.catch-nearly.do-IA ‘I nearly catch him’

(319)

a-sinah-šipe-õ (2093) 1sA-3sO.hear-nearly.do-IA ‘I nearly hear him’

(320)

a-kol-šipe-y (2427) 1sS-die-nearly.do-PST ‘I nearly died’

7.3.4. Derived stems Derived stems are formed by means of the derivational suffixes -its ‘passive’; -ka(h) ‘indirect causative’; -(k)e(h) ‘direct causative’; -(k)ia(h) ‘reiterative’; -n(o) ‘reflexive’; -p(e) ‘negative’. (The use of negativizer -(p)e is treated in chapter 11 together with other negators, such as -…in, -mu, -nik). Regularly, the derivational suffixes are attached to a non-reduced stem. When the suffix -(k)e(h) is attached to the stem of a verb belonging to class 1 and class 2, it is attached to the reduced stem. It is not found after the stem of verbs belonging to one of the other classes.
The stem of a derived verb formed by means of the suffix -its is irreducible; that of a derived verb formed by means of one of the other derivational suffixes is reducible. Derived verbs composed with causativizer -(k)e(h), indirect causativizer -ka(h) and reiterative -(k)ia(h) behave like the verbs of class 2. They also have a consonantal stem in h, which is dropped before the suffixes -(a)õ ‘incompletive aspect marker’ and -(i)y ‘stem extender’, ‘past tense marker’. Reflexive verbs composed with the suffix -n(o) behave like the verbs of class 5: o is dropped before -(a)õ, and the stem is extended by means of the suffix -w ‘stem extender’, ‘past tense marker’, attached to a non-reduced stem. In section 7.3.4.1-7.3.4.5 we take a closer look at the derivational suffixes. In section 7.3.4.7 we go more closely into the passive voice.

238

7.3.4.1. Derivational suffix -its ‘passive’ A passive verb can be formed by means of the suffix -its. Passivizer -its is only used with transitive verbs. It turns the transitive verb into an intransitive verb, i.e. the agent of the transitive verb is suppressed and the direct object of the transitive verb becomes the subject of the passive verb:

(321)

a-õoly-aõ (685) 1sA-3sO.love-IA ‘I love him/her/it’

a-kole-its-aõ (995) 1sS-love-PAS-IA ‘I am loved’

(322)

i-l-ø-aõ (2138) 3sA-3sO-make-IA ‘he/she/it makes him/her/it’

l-o-its-aõ (1008) 3sS-make-PAS-IA ‘he/she/it is made’

(323)

menyo-w-la-õ (811) 3sO.want-SE-3pA-IA ‘they want him/her/it’

…i-penyo-its-aõ (1021) 3pS-want-PAS-IA ‘they (p) are wanted’

Derived stems with -its may have an alternative future form in which future marker -(k)t(e) is not directly suffixed to the non-reduced stem -its, but to the stem extender -(i)y (see also section 7.1). This has been found with the verbs kole/koly ‘(to) love’ and peny(o) ‘(to) want’, but it may have occurred with other verbs as well:
(i): first person singular and plural, and second and third person singular of the verb kole/koly ‘(to) love’;
(ii): first person singular - and possibly also first person plural and second and third person singular and plural (the data are missing) - of the verb peny(o) ‘(to) want’:

a-kole-its-iy-t-aõ (1002) mi-kole-its-iy-t-aõ (1002) õole-its-iy-t-aõ (1002) ki-kole-its-iy-t-aõ (1002) a-penyo-its-iy-t-aõ (1022)

‘I shall be loved’ ‘you will be loved’ ‘he/she/it is loved’ ‘we shall be loved’ ‘I shall be wanted’

Cf. mi-kole-its-iy-ha-kt-aõ (1002) …i-kole-its-t-aõ (1002) a-o-its-t-aõ (1013)

‘you (p) will be loved’ ‘they will be loved’ ‘I shall be made’

Verbs formed by means of the derivational suffix -its ‘passivizer’, have no forms in -e…/(k)t-e…, but they do have a form in -hu:

(324)

a-kole-its-hu (1005) 1sS-love-PAS-SR ‘that I am loved’

(325)

a-o-its-hu (1015) 1sS-make-PAS-SR ‘that I am made’

239

7.3.4.2. Derivational suffix -ka(h) ‘indirect causative’ The suffix -ka(h) causativizes transitive verbs. It does not occur with intransitive verbs:

(326)

a-l-o-kah-t-aõ (1941) 1sA-3sO-do-ICA-F-IA ‘I shall cause to do it’

(327)

a-tsuh-ka-õ (980) 1sA-3sO.anoint-ICA-IA ‘I cause to anoint him/her/it’

(328)

a-l-o-ka-y (2162) 1sA-3sO-do-ICA-PST ‘I caused to do it’

7.3.4.3. Derivational suffix -(k)e(h) ‘causative’ The derivational suffix -(k)e(h) primarily causativizes intransitive stems (see section 7.3.1, verbs of class 1). It can also causativize transitive stems. In section 7.3.1 we have seen that the suffix -(k)e(h) appears after the reduced stem of verbs of class 1 and 2. It also occurs with stems which are not liable to reduction, such as lyup ‘(to) eat something’. The form -e(h) is attached to a consonant; -ke(h) to a vowel:

(329)

mu-tp-iy-ha-õ (931) 2S-walk-SE-PL-IA ‘you (p) walk’

(330)

mu-ø-tp-e-y-ha-õ (933) 2A-3sO-walk-CAU-SE-PL-IA ‘you (p) cause him/her/it to walk’

(331) (333)

a-m-hinah-p-aõ (1742) 1sA-2sO-hear-NE-IA ‘I do not hear you’
a-ø-lyup-aõ (2048) 1sA-3sO-eat-IA ‘I eat something’

(332) (334)

a-ø-hina-ke-õ (1582) 1sA-3sO-hear-CAU-IA ‘I cause him/her/it to hear’
a-ø-lyup-e-y (1932) 1sA-3sO-eat-CAU-PST ‘I caused him/her/it to eat (some thing)’

In one case, -(k)e(h) is suffixed to the reduced stem of a verb of class 5:

(335)

a-am-aõ (2054) 1sS-eat-IA ‘I eat’

(336)

a-l-am-e-õ (2055) 1sA-3sO-eat-CAU-IA ‘I cause him/her/it to eat’

(337)

mi-amo-w-ha-õ (2054) 2S-eat-SE-PL-IA ‘you (p) eat’

(338)

mi-l-am-e-y-ha-õ (2055) 2A-3sO-eat-CAU-SE-PL-IA ‘you (p) cause him/her/it to eat’

240

(The verbs am(o) and lyup both mean ‘(to) eat’. However the former is intransitive, whereas the latter is transitive). In the following special case -(k)e(h) is suffixed to a non-reduced stem (see also section 7.3.2):

(339)

a-ø-hila-ke-õ (1583)

( < h(i)l ‘(to) speak’)

1sA-3sO-speak-CAU-IA

‘I cause him/her/it to speak’

Causativizer -(k)e(h) can be followed by the indirect causativizer -ka(h). When -(k)e(h) precedes -ka(h), the ending h can be dropped (cf. stems in ah and oh which can also lose h before indirect causativizer -ka(h), section 7.3.4.2):

(340)

a-tsm-e-ka-õ (950)

cf.

1sA-3sO.know-CAU-ICA-IA

‘I cause to know it’/ ‘I teach it’

a-tsm-eh-ia-õ (948) 1sA-3sO.know-CAU-RE-IA ‘I teach it again’

The direct causativizer -(k)e(h) can also be followed by a bound verb:

(341)

a-tsm-eh-koloh-nap-aly (2883) 1sA-3sO.know-CAU-finish-SEQ-RST ‘just after I had finished it’

The suffix -(k)e(h) can furthermore function as a verbalizer (see section 7.7).

7.3.4.4. Derivational suffix -(k)ia(h) ‘reiterative’ Reiterative verbs are formed by means of the suffix -(k)ia(h):

(342)

mi-l-o-kiah-i (2163) 2sA-3sO-do-RE-IMP ‘Do it again!’

(343)

a-ø-loh-ia-õ (970) 1sA-3sO-wet-RE-IA ‘I wet it again’

(344)

tsoyo-kia-õ (2002) 3sS.cry-RE-IA ‘he cries again’

241

7.3.4.5. Derivational suffix -n(o) ‘reflexive’ A reflexive verb can be formed by means of the suffix -n(o), attached to transitive stems. Reflexive verbs are intransitive:

(345)

a-o-no-… (2167) 1sS-make-RFL-FAC ‘that I make myself’

(346)

mi-o-no-k (2167) 2sS-make-RFL-IMP ‘Make yourself!’

(347)

a-yoketeh-no-w (2833) 1sS-revenge-RFL-PST ‘I revenged myself’

(348)

a-yoketeh-no-kt-aõ (2833) 1sS-revenge-RFL-F-IA ‘I shall revenge myself’

(349)

a-lu-poh-n-aõ (1720) 1sS-interior-burn-RFL-PST ‘I abhor myself’

(350)

a-n-eštek-o-n-aõ (2063) 1sS-REL-cloth-make-RFL-IA ‘I cloth myself’

7.3.4.6. Excursus on the passive voice In section 7.3.4.1 we saw that a passive voice can be obtained morphologically by means of the derivational suffix -its, attached to a non-reduced verb form. A passive voice can furthermore be formed syntactically by means of a preterite form and the auxiliary k(o)t ‘(to) be’:

(351)

a-m-koly-iy

me-kt-iy (984)

1sA-2sO-love-PST 2sS-be-PST

‘You were loved by me’. (lit. ‘I loved you, you were’).

(352)

crus-te lyawin l-o-w-la

ø-kot-e-õ,

cross-AD nail 3sO-do-PST-3pA 3sS-be-PST-IA

õol-e-õ,

mu-y-la-sim

ø-kot-e-õ (987)

3sS.die-PST-IA 3sO.bury-PST-3pA-EMP 3sS-be-PST-IA

‘He was nailed to the cross [by them], he died, [and] he was buried by

them’.

The difference between the use of -its and k(o)t is that when -its is used, the verb form becomes intransitive: the agent is dropped and the object of the active form becomes subject in the passive form. In a passive voice with k(o)t, the main verb remains transitive and the object becomes subject of the auxiliary, so that the object of the transitive verb corresponds to the subject of the auxiliary.

242

7.4. Inflexional suffixes As already stated, a verb stem can be followed by all kind of suffixes. Alongside bound verbs and derivational suffixes, treated in section 7.3.3.2 and 7.3.4, respectively, it can be followed by the incompletive marker -(a)õ; the stem extenders and past tense markers -(i)y/-w and -e(y); future marker -(k)t(e)-; imperative markers -(k)(i) and -(k)he; nominalizers (+ case markers); and subordinators (+ case markers). A verb form can also be followed by discourse markers or sentential suffixes (chapter 10).

7.4.1. Incompletive aspect marker -(a)õ In the first chapter about verbs Pedro de la Mata observes that <an> as well as <en>
are endings of the present tense of the indicative. The observation that the present tense of the indicative can end in eõ is in contradiction to what is shown in the conjugation of the verbs k(o)t ‘(to) be’ (class 1) and õole ‘(to) love’ (class 2). In these conjugations, eõ is not the ending of the present tense, but a preterite ending (‘preterito imperfecto y perfecto’). The alleged present indicative in eõ or, rather, in -õ (we have seen that de la Mata’s ending eõ should be interpreted as -e-õ) thus corresponds to a preterite indicative in the data. The correspondence between de la
Mata’s present indicative and his preterite can furthermore be observed when we
look at the second person plural form. Second person plural ‘present’ and second person plural ‘imperfect and perfect’ have the same ending in -õ:

(353)

‘present indicative’ me-kt-iy-ha-õ (294) 2S-be-SE-PL-IA ‘you (p) are’

‘imperfect and perfect indicative’ me-kt-iy-ha-õ (300) 2S-be-SE-PL-IA ‘you (p) were’

Apparently, when a verb form ends in -(a)õ it can express ‘present’ as well as ‘past tense’. This means that in Cholón there is no such dichotomy as ‘present tense’ versus ‘past tense’, but, rather, that of ‘imperfective or incompletive aspect’ (present or past tense) versus ‘perfective past tense or preterite’. Since the suffix -(a)õ is primarily used to express ‘present tense’, indicating that the event has not been finished or completed yet, it is likely to represent an incompletive aspect. The use of -(a)õ is also shown in the following examples (for more examples, see section 7.1 et seq.):

(354)

a-šk-aõ (951) 1sS-drink-IA ‘I drink’

(355)

a-tsm-e-õ (944) 1sA-3sO.know-CAU-IA ‘I cause to know it’/’I teach it’

(356)

a-ø-lo-õ (962) 1sA-3sO-wet-IA ‘I wet something’.

(357)

ø-lo-y-la-õ (962) 3SO-wet-SE-3pA-IA ‘They wet him/her/it’.

243

(357)

menyo-w-la-õ (811) 3sO.want-SE-3pA-IA ‘They want him/her/it’.

7.4.2. Stem extension and past tense markers Cholón has two groups of affixes which function both as a stem extender and as a past tense marker: -iy, -y, -e, -ey, -w. The main options -(i)y/-w and -e(y) are used under different circumstances. In some cases, however, -e(y) functions as a substitute for -(i)y/-w.

7.4.2.1. Stem extender and past tense marker -(i)y/-w The allomorphs of the stem extension and past tense marker -(i)y/-w, differ from each other in that -w is used after the non-reduced, vocalic stem in o of a verb of class 5 or a verb + -no- ‘reflexive’ (see section 7.3.4.5), the only verbal affix in -o-, whereas -(i)y occurs after the reduced stem of a verb of any other class (-iy after a consonant, -y after a vowel). When -(i)y is used after a derivational suffix, however, the derived stem is not reduced. The elements -(i)y and -w are used as stem extenders when they occur (i) before the second person plural marker -ha and third person plural agent marker -la, when -ha and la are followed by -(a)õ ‘incompletive aspect’:

(358)

mi-ø-lam-iy-ha-õ (1980) 2A-3sO-kill-SE-PL-IA ‘you (p) kill him/her/it’

(359)

ø-lam-iy-la-õ (2057) 3sO-kill-SE-3pA-IA ‘they kill him/her/it’

(360)

mi-menyo-w-ha-õ (810) 2A-3sO.want-SE-PL-IA ‘you (p) want him/her/it’

(361)

menyo-w-la-õ (811) 3sO.want-SE-3pA-IA ‘they want him/her/it’

(362)

mi-kole-its-iy-ha-õ (999) 2S-love-PAS-SE-PL-IA ‘you (p) are loved’

(363)

mi-menyo-ka-y-ha-õ (868) 2A-3sO.want-ICA-SE-PL-IA ‘you (p) cause him/her/it to want’

(364)

menyo-ka-y-la-õ (868) 3sO.want-ICA-SE-3pA-IA ‘they cause him/her/it to want’

It appears, however, that the forms me-kt-iy-ha-õ ‘you (p) are’ (385) and õoly-iy-la-õ ‘they love him/her/it’ (837), may also be translated as past tense forms, as ‘you (p) were (392)’ and ‘they loved him/her/it’ (844), respectively. The suffix -(i)y then also functions as a past tense marker.

244

(ii) before the second person plural marker -ha, when -ha occurs after a reduced stem of a verb of class 1 and it is followed by the purposive subordinator -(e)…:

(365)

me-kt-iy-ha-… (423) 2S-be-SE-PL-PURP ‘that you (p) are’

(366)

me-tõ-iy-ha-… (544) 2S-be.(seated)-SE-PL-PURP ‘that you (p) are (seated)’

(iii) before the negator -mu, when functioning as a prohibitive marker ‘(do) not’:

(367)

ah nyip-iy-mu-a (2941) INTJ touch-SE-NE-EX ‘Oh, do not touch it!’

(iv) before subordinator -(n)ap ‘after’:

(368)

išaki-pat ku-lykoh-iy-nap, tsi mahat-mulo-w (2549) job-INS 1pS-finish-SE-SEQ rain 3sS.come.down-begin-PST ‘After we had finished the job, it started raining’.

In all other cases, -(i)y/-w functions exclusively as a past tense marker:

(369)

a-õoly-iy (691) 1sA-3sO.love-PST ‘I loved him/her/it’

(370)

mi-õoly-iy-ha (695) 2A-3sO.love-PST-PL ‘you (p) loved him/her/it’

(371)

a-menyo-w (812) 1sA-3sO.want-PST ‘I wanted him/her/it’

(372)

menyo-w-la (817) 3sO.want-PST-3pA ‘they wanted him/her/it’

(373)

a-tsm-e-y (944)

(374)

1sA-3sO.know-CAU-PST

‘I caused to know it’/ ‘I taught it’

a-menyo-ka-y (869) 1sA-3sO.want-ICA-PST ‘I caused him/her/it to want’

(375)

a-ših-ia-y (955) 1sS-drink-RE-PST ‘I drank again’

(376)

baptizan ø-ki-y-mu ø-kot-aõ (2656) baptism 3sS-do-SE-NE 3sS-be-IA ‘He is without baptism’.

Past tense forms in -(i)y/-w can be followed by the copula (po)k(o)t ‘(to) be’ in order to construct a perfect tense: future perfect tense; perfect of the ‘optative’; perfect of the ‘infinitive’. Future perfect tense is formed by means of a past tense

245

form in -(i)y/-w and an imperfective aspect form of k(o)t. Both forms have the same subject:

(377) (378) (379)

me-kt-iy-ha me-kt-iy-ha-õ (318) 2S-be-PST-PL 2S-be-SE-PL-IA ‘you (p) will have been’

ki-õoly-iy

ke-kt-aõ (712)

1pA-3sO.love-PST 1pS-be-IA

‘we will have loved him/her/it’

mi-menyo-w

me-kt-aõ (831)

2sA-3sO.want-PST 2sS-be-IA

‘you will have wanted him/her/it’

Perfect of the ‘optative’ consists of a past tense form in -(i)y/-w followed by the impersonal third person singular verb forms ø-(po)kot-te-ke or ø-(po)kot-o-ke:

(380) (381) (382)

…e-kt-iy

ø-(po)kot-te-ke/ø-(po)kot-o-ke (382)

3pS-be-PST 3sS-be-INF-ANT/3sS-be- FN2-ANT

‘they wished they had been’, ‘if only they had been’

mi-õoly-iy

ø-(po)kot-te-ke/ø-(po)kot-o-ke (757)

2sA-3sO.love-PST 3sS-be-INF-ANT/3sS-be- FN2-ANT

‘You wished you had loved him/her/it’.

a-menyo-w

ø-(po)kot-te-ke/ø-(po)kot-o-ke (840)

1sA-3sO.want-PST 3sS-be-INF-ANT/3sS-be- FN2-ANT

‘I wished I had wanted him/her/it’.

(For the forms in -(k)te-ke and -(õ)o-ke, see section 7.4.6.2 and 7.4.6.4, respectively).

Perfect of the ‘infinitive’ is formed by means of a past tense form in -(i)y/-w followed by impersonal ø-kot-nap ‘because’, ‘for’ (for the explanation of ø-kot-nap ‘because’, ‘for’ see section 7.4.6.3):

(383)

a-kt-iy ø-kot-nap (428) 1sS-be-PST 3sS-be-SEQ ‘for I have been’

246

(384) (385)

a-õoly-iy

ø-kot-nap (789)

1sA-3sO.love-PST 3sS-be-SEQ

‘for I have loved him/her/it’

a-menyo-w

ø-kot-nap (858)

1sA-3sO.want-PST 3sS-be-SEQ

‘for I have wanted him/her/it’

Past tense forms in -(i)y/-w can furthermore be followed by a zero-nominalizer and function (i) as a ‘past participle’, translated as an agentive ‘the one who ...’:

(386)

ø-kot-iy-ø (433) 3sS-be-PST-NOM ‘the one who was’

(387)

mi-õoly-iy-ø (799) 2sA-3sO.love-PST-NOM ‘you who loved him/her/it’

(388)

a-menyo-w-ø (861) 1sA-3sO.want-PST-NOM ‘I who wanted him/her/it’

(ii) as a noun:

(389)

in…a-pat-am ki-kalyo-its-iy-ø-a

ku-mu…eh-t-aõ (2858)

what-INS-QM 1sS-order-PAS-PST-NOM-TOP 1pA-3sO.fulfil-F-IA

‘How shall we fulfil our obligation’.

(390)

a-l-o-w-ø (89) 1sA-3sO-make-PST-NOM ‘my making’ (< ‘(1s) made’ < ‘I have made it’)

Nominalized past tense forms can be followed by case markers (see section 7.4.7).

7.4.2.2. Stem extender and past tense marker -e(y) The suffix -e(y) primarily functions as a past tense marker. It is then suffixed to a reduced stem of a verb of class 1 and 2 and followed by the incompletive aspect marker -(a)õ:

(391)

ke-kt-e-õ (299) 1pS-be-PST-IA ‘we were’

(392)

ki-õoly-e-õ (694) 1pA-3sO.love-PST-IA ‘we loved him/her/it’

247

In four examples, -e(y) functions as a past tense marker, although it is not followed by the incompletive aspect marker -(a)õ. In these forms, -e(y) is used as a variant of -(i)y:

(393)

ma nyalok-aly ke-lyw-ey (2887) INT time-RST 1pS-go-PST ‘We went just at the same time’.

(394)

a-šk-ey (952) 1sS-drink-PST ‘I drank’

(395) (396)

angel-pit mo-šl-ey-na-…-he;

angel-COR 3sA.3pO-speak-PST-QUOT-REP-IS

…ik-no-w-mu-…-he-na

mo-hil-we-y (1587)

be.afraid-RFL-SE-NE-REP-IS-QUOT 3sA.3pO-word-VB-PST

‘and the angel said to them that they should not be afraid’

soldado-tu-p putam tsap-ey-la (2882) soldier-AD-ABL village 3sO.take-PST-3pA ‘The soldiers took the village’.

In the following attested form, -e(y) also replaces -(i)y. However, in this example it apparently functions as a stem extender, since it does not indicate a past tense:

(397)

ø-šik-ey-la-õ (951) 3sO-drink-SE-3pA-IA ‘they drink it’

In addition, an element -e- can be recognized in the ending -e-nap. Verb forms in -e-nap occur in temporal subordinate clauses. The ending -e-(n)ap indicates a previous event, a sequence, and can also be translated as ‘after’:

(398)

toõ-e-nap (550) be.(seated)-SE-SEQ ‘(after) having been.(seated)’

(399)

kalo… pey-te mu…-e-nap, mu-tup-i plate ground-AD 3sO.put-SE-SEQ 2sS-walk-IMP mi-neõ-pat paloõ …ih-ø (2824) 2sPOS-hand-INS door open-IMP ‘Put first the plate on the ground and open the door with both hands’.

(lit. After having put the plate on the ground, go and open the door with both hands’).

Elements -e- and -ey- are furthermore found in the following three cases:

248

1: in the impersonal paradigm of the verb lyaw ‘(to) go away from’ before the ending -khe ‘imperative’ (see section 7.4.5), the future marker -(k)t(e) (see section 7.4.4), and the nominalizer -(k)te ‘infinitive’ (see section 7.4.6.2):

(400)

ø-ha-lyaw-e-khe (1826)

(401)

3sS-3sO.APL-go.away-SE-IMP

‘May it go away from him/her/it!’

ø-m-a-lyaw-ey-ha-kte (1826) 3sS-2O-APL-go.away-SE-PL-F ‘May it go away from you (p)!’

(402)

ø-a-lyaw-e-kte (1837) 3sS-1sO.APL-go.away-SE-INF ‘that it goes away from me’

2: in one purposive form before the nominalizer -(k)te:

(403)

i-tsp-e-kte-he

ø-lyaw-iy (2388)

3sA-3sO.see-SE-INF-BEN 3sS-go.away-PST

‘He went away to see him’.

3: in three attested imperative forms before the imperative ending -k(i):

(404)

mu…-e-ki (2728) 3sO.put down-SE-IMP ‘Put it down!’

(405)

tsa…-e-k (258) 3sO.see-SE-IMP ‘Look at it!’

(406)

mi-ts…-e-ki (258) 2sA-3sO.see-SE-IMP ‘Look at it!’

7.4.3. Anteriority marker -(k)e We saw that -(k)e can indicate ‘past’ and be used as a nominal past marker, when suffixed to a nominal stem (section 6.3.1.3). The suffix -(k)e also indicates ‘past’, or, rather, ‘anteriority’, when it is attached to past tense forms in (i)y/-w, and nominalized forms in -(k)te ‘infinitive’ and -(õ)o ‘future nominalizer 2'. In the former case, -(k)e is used to form a pluperfect. The ending -(k)e can be replaced by -ate ‘then’, which can then also occur after the past tense marker -e(y):

(407)

a-õoly-iy-e (697) 1sA-3sO.love-PST-ANT ‘I had loved him/her/it’

(408)

a-õoly-ey-ate (697) 1sA-3sO.love-PST-then ‘I had loved him/her/it’

(409)

ke-kt-iy-e (305) 1pS-be-PST-ANT ‘we had been’

(410)

ke-kt-iy-ate (305) 1pS-be-PST-then ‘we had been’

249

(411)

menyo-w-la-ke (823) 3sO.want-PST-3pA-ANT ‘they had wanted him/her/it’

When the anteriority marker -(k)e occurs after -(i)y in a subordinated clause, it indicates that the event has taken place before another event, and it can often be translated as ‘after’:

(412)

ø-lyaw-iy-e-wa,

into-ny-am

ki-l-o-õo

ø-kot-aõ,

3sS-go-PST-ANT-TOP which-CMP-QM 1pA-3sO-do-FN2 3sS-be-IA

pe-ny-aly-…o

ø-kot-he (385)

that-CMP-RST-already 3sS-be-IMP

‘If he has gone, what can we do, let him be [a fugitive]’.

(413)

kasaran ø-ki-y-e,

õol-iy (872)

marriage 3sS-do-PST-ANT 3sS.die-PST

‘After having married, he died’.

(414)

õol-iy-e,

õinha-wo-w (873)

3sS.die-PST-ANT 3sS.life-VB-PST

‘After having died, he resuscitated’.

The anteriority marker -(k)e can also be suffixed to the nominalizers -(k)te ‘infinitive’ (section 7.4.6.2) and -(õ)o ‘future nominalizer 2' (section 7.4.6.4), in order to form an irrealis. The endings -(k)te-ke and -(õ)o-ke express a ‘future in the past’, viz. a wish or non-realized event. (For examples and further remarks, see the
sections 7.4.6.2 and 7.4.6.4, respectively).

7.4.4. Future marker -(k)t(e)
The ending -(k)t(e) indicates future. It is attached to a non-reduced stem. The form -(k)t- is used before the imperfective aspect marker -aõ in order to form a future tense and before subordinator -e… in order to indicate a purposive clause (see subordinator -(k)t-e… , section 7.4.6); the form -(k)te is used elsewhere. Forms with initial -t- occur after a consonant, those with initial -kt- after a vowel. Some
examples of the future tense are

(415) (416) (417) (418) (419)

mi-kot-t-aõ (309) mi-kot-ha-kt-aõ (312) mi-õole-kt-aõ (704) mi-menyo-kt-aõ (825) ø-loh-la-kt-aõ (964)

‘you will be’ ‘you (p) will be’ ‘you will love him/her/it’ ‘you will want him/her/it’ ‘they will wet him/her/it’

250

Future forms without the aspect marker are, for instance:

(420) ki-kot-te (330) (421) i-m-kole-kte (721)

‘we shall be’ ‘he will love you’

They are used to form (i) a first person plural of the imperative:

(422) (423) (424)

ki-kot-te (323)
ki-õole-kte (717) ki-menyo-kte (834)

‘Let us be!’ ‘May we love him/her/it!’ ‘May we want him/her/it!’

(ii) an optative mood or irrealis by means of the suffix -mok ‘hopefully’, ‘I wished’ and the verb form ø-kot ‘it is’. The suffix -mok can be attached to the future marker -(k)te or to a noun preceding the form in -(k)te. Impersonal ø-kot ‘it is’ always follows the form in -(k)te(-mok):

(425) (a) palyow-mok a-kot-te ø-kot (370) good-hopefully 1sS-be-F 3sS-be ‘I wished I had been good’.

(b) palyow a-kot-te-mok

ø-kot (370)

good 1sS-be-F-hopefully 3sS-be

‘I wished I had been good’.

(426) (a) Pedro-mok santo

ø-kot-te ø-kot (373)

Pedro-hopefully saint 3sS-be-F 3sS-be

‘If only Pedro had been a saint’.

(b) Pedro santo ø-kot-te-mok

ø-kot (373)

Pedro saint 3sS-be-F-hopefully 3sS-be

‘If only Pedro had been a saint’.

7.4.5. Imperative markers -(k)(i) and -(k)he The imperative (second person) is formed by means of a non-reduced stem + the ending -ø, -i, -k or -ki. Person marking can be omitted in a second person singular form; it is necessary in a second person plural form. The endings -ø, -i, -k, -ki are allomorphs; -ø or -i are used after a consonant, -k or -ki after a vowel:

(427) (428) (429) (430)

kot, mi-kot-i (321)
mi-kot-ha-k, mi-kot-ha-ki (324) õole-k, mi-õole-ki (715) mi-õole-ha-ki (718)

‘Be!’ ‘Be (p)!’ ‘Love him/her/it!’ ‘Love (p) him/her/it!’

251

(431) menyo-k, menyo-ki (832) (432) mi-menyo-ha-ki (835)

‘Want him/her/it!’ ‘Want (p) him/her/it!’

In section 7.4.4 we have seen that a first person plural imperative can be expressed by means of the future marker -(k)te. A first and third person imperative (‘permissive’ according to de la Mata) is formed by means of the ending -(k)he (The ending -(k)he may consist of an imperative ending -ø/-k and a benefactive element -he). It is suffixed to a non-reduced stem:

(433) (434) (435) (436) (437)

ø-kot-he (335) i-menyo-khe (833)
i-õole-khe (167) …i-kot-he (338) õole-la-khe (719)

‘Let him be’. ‘May he want him/her/it!’ ‘May we love him him/her/it’. ‘Let them be’. ‘May they love him/her/it!’

The imperative forms in -(k)he can be used to express a wish. If the verb in question is preceded by a noun (object or nominal predicate) the element -he may be attached to that preceding noun:

(438)

santo ki-kot-he (346) saint 1pS-be-IMP ‘I wished we were saints’.

(439)

santo-he ki-kot-ø (346) saint-BEN 1pS-be-IMP ‘I wished we were saints’.

(440)

Dios õole-la-khe (737) God 3sO.love-3pA-IMP ‘I wished they loved God’.

(441)

Dios-he õole-la-k (737) God-BEN 3sO.love-3pA-IMP ‘I wished they loved God’.

7.4.6. Nominalizers
In Cholón we can distinguish two kinds of nominalization:
(i): nominalization of the stem;
(ii): nominalization of finite forms. Stem nominalization takes place by means of the suffixes -(e)… (section
7.4.6.1), -(k)te (section 7.4.6.2), -lam (section 7.4.6.3), -(õ)o (section 7.4.6.4), and -(w)u… (section 7.4.6.5). They are regularly attached to a non-reduced stem. In the ALC most of these suffixes occur in nominal or non-finite forms: -(k)te is labeled ‘infinitive’, -lam ‘future of the infinitive’, -(õ)o ‘supine’, and -(w)u… ‘present participle’. The suffix -(e)… is used in constructions labeled ‘ablativus absolutus’ or ‘subjunctive’ by de la Mata, and translated as a present participle or as a subordinate clause. In section 6.10 we have seen that forms in -(e)…, -lam, -(õ)o, and -(w)u… can be used as nouns, and that forms in -(e)… and -(õ)o can also function as adjectives. Forms in -(e)…, -(k)te, -lam, and -(õ)o can furthermore indicate a subject clause, a direct object clause, an indirect complement, a nominal predicate, an attributive
extension of the direct object, a causal clause, and a relative clause. Nominalized

forms in -lam and -(õ)o can also function as a main predicate. All of the nominalizers mentioned can be followed by specific case markers.
Finite forms may be nominalized by means of a zero-nominalizer (see section 7.4.2.1 and 7.4.7); and by means of the deictics ko ‘this one’ and iõko ‘that one’ (section 7.4.6.6). These deictics can also be followed by specific case markers.
7.4.6.1. Nominalizer -(e)… ‘factivizer’ The suffix -(e)… can be used as a factivizer (‘the fact that ...’) in a subject or direct object clause; and it can be used to indicate an attributive extension of the direct object. In the latter case, -(e)… can also indicate ‘cause’. Nominalizer -(e)… (-… after a vowel and -e… after a consonant) is attached to the non-reduced stem of a verb of class 3, 4, 5 (see Table 7.6). (Verbs of class 1 and 2 have no nominalized forms in -(e)…, but they do have subordinated forms in -hu and -(k)t-e… instead, see also Table 7.6 and section 7.4.6). Ex.:

(442) (443) (444) (445) (446) (447)

a-õole-… (758)
mi-õole-ha-… (762)
õole-la-… (762) a-menyo-… (842) mi-menyo-ha-… (845) menyo-la-… (846)

‘(the fact) that I love him/her/it’ ‘(the fact) that you (p) love him/her/it ‘(the fact) that they love him/her/it’ ‘(the fact) that I want him/her/it’ ‘(the fact) that you (p) want him/her/it’ ‘(the fact) that they want him/her/it’

Forms in -(e)… function as subject clauses when the main verb is mas(o) ‘(to) take all night’ or pats(a) ‘(to) take all day’:

(448)

a-pšawo-… ø-patsa-õ (2095) 1sS-spin-FAC 3sS-take.all.day-IA ‘I spend the day spinning’. (‘The fact that I am spinning takes a whole day’).

(449)

a-lu-wo-…

ø-mas-aõ (2097)

1sS-interior-VB-FAC 3sS-take.all.night-IA

‘All night long I am sad’.

In the following example, the direct object of y(a)… ‘(to) see’ is a third person singular, so that the form mi-tsa… can be interpreted as ‘you see it’ or as ‘you see him’. In this case, the form in -(e)…, i-m-kole-… ‘(the fact) that he loves you’
functions as a direct object clause:

253

(450)

i-m-kaly-aõ-ko-ny

mi-l-o-ki,

i-m-kole-…

3sA-2sO-order-IA-DEM-CMP 2sA-3sO-do-IMP 3sA-2sO-love-FAC mi-tsa…-te (764)

2sA-3sO.see-F

‘Do as he orders you, [and] you will see that he loves you’.

When the form in -(e)… functions as an attributive extension of the direct object, the subject of the nominalized verb to which -(e)… is attached is co-referential with the object of the main verb, and the object of the main verb is the head of the form in -(e)…:

(451)

a-poõ-pat

i-lya-…

a-po-y…-iy (1443)

one-CL:group-INS 3pS-go-FAC 1sA-3pO-see-PST

‘I saw them going in a troop’.

In a similar construction, the nominalized verb in -(e)… can also indicate ‘cause’. Here again, the object of the main verb and the subject of the nominalized verb must be co-referential:

(452)

mitah-la-…

…i-po-šay…-aõ (2375)

3sO.miss-3pA-FAC 3pA-3pO-whip-IA

‘They whip them, because they miss it’.

The suffix -(e)… can be followed by the ablative case marker -(a)p meaning ‘after’ and preceded by the negation pe-. The suffix combination -pe-…-ap is translated as ‘before (that) ...’:

(453)

mi-lya-pe-…-ap, ko ašmaõ 2sS-go-NE-FAC-ABL this first ‘Before you go, do this first!’

mi-l-o-ki (2925) 2sA-3sO-do-IMP

a-kt-aõ (1621)

1sS-be-IA

‘Before you began to speak, I had already finished it’.

7.4.6.2. Nominalizer -(k)te ‘infinitive’ The suffix -(k)te is frequently used as a complementizer with the verb meny(o) ‘(to)
want’. The element -k is dropped after a consonant. Examples of nominalized forms in -(k)te occurring as a direct object of meny(o) are:

254

(455)

a-lya-kte a-meny-aõ (1605) 1sS-go-INF 1sA-3sO.want-IA ‘I want to go’.

The nominalizer -(k)te can be followed by the case marker -he ‘benefactive’; by the anteriority marker -(k)e; and by the case marker combination -man-ap, indicating a comparison.
The combination -(k)te-he indicates a purpose ‘for the sake of’, ‘in order to’:

(456)

m-a-lyemtsap-ap, mi-lya-kt-aõ (1806)

‘You will go, after having helped me to do this’.

ki-amo-kte-he-wa ki-piyp-o-ly (1183) 1pS-eat-INF-BEN-TOP 1pS-work-FN2-RST ‘We just have to work, so that we can eat’.

Forms in -(k)te-he are often found as the complement of a verb of motion:

(459)

a-mohna-õ (1811)

wheat meal 1sA-3sO.buy-INF-BEN 1sS-go.up-IA

‘I go to the mountains to buy wheatmeal (for you)’.

The form in -(k)te-he can furthermore be a complement of the verb meny(o) ‘(to) want’ or, occasionally, of other verbs of thinking. The subjects of the two verbs need not be identical:

255

(462) (463)

mi-lya-kte-he a-meny-aõ (1606) 2sS-go-INF-BEN 1sA-3sO.want-IA ‘I want you to go’.

1sS-interior-be-IA good-RST 2sS-go-INF-BEN

‘I think that you may very well go’.

The ending -(k)te-ke, described by de la Mata as an optative ending, is used to form an irrealis. It indicates in fact a ‘future in the past’, and it expresses a wish or an event that could or would take/have taken place:

(464) (465) (466)

inaham

Dios a-õole-kte-ke (738)

‘If you were good, I would want you’.

In section 6.11.3 we saw that a comparison can be formed by means of the suffix combination -man-ap, following a nominal stem. The sequence -man-ap is then translatable as ‘than’. A comparative clause can be formed when -man-ap is attached to a nominalized verb form in -(k)te. The suffix combination -man-ap, translated as ‘rather than’, ‘instead of’ can then be followed by the adverb ašmaõ ‘first’:

(467)

a-n-utsa

a-l-o-kte-man-ap,

ašmaõ a-kol-te

1sPOS-REL-sin 1sA-3sO-do-INF-INES-ABL first 1sS-die-INF a-meny-aõ (1625)

1sA-3sO.want-IA

‘I prefer to die rather than to sin’.

7.4.6.3. Nominalizer -lam ‘future nominalizer 1' According to Pedro de la Mata the ending -lam corresponds to the Latin ending ‘-rus’. In Latin, -turus is the ending of future of the infinitive or of the future participle, and it indicates that the event expressed by the verb is bound to take place. Forms in -lam are nominal forms referring to an event in the future or an obligation:

256

(468)

a-kot-lam (431, 1051) 1sS-be-FN1 ‘my future being’, ‘my having to be’, ‘that I shall be’

(469) (470)

a-õole-lam (791, 1061, 1768) 1sA-3sO.love-FN1 ‘my future loving of him/her/it’, ‘my having to love him/her/it’, ‘that I shall love him/her/it’
a-menyo-lam (859, 1057) 1sA-3sO.want-FN1 ‘my future wanting of him/her/it’, ‘my having to want him/her/it’, ‘that I shall want him/her/it’

Several types of clauses can be formed by means of a nominalized form in -lam: (i) the suffix -lam can be used to form a relative clause. The forms in -lam are then often left untranslated in the ALC. They can either precede or follow their heads:

(471)

ko lyup-maõ

ki-h…o-lam-a

konfesion-sim

this immersion-INES 1pS-be.submerged-FN1-TOP confession-EMP

ø-kot-aõ (1205)

3sS-be-IA

‘This bath is the [sacramental] confession’.

(lit. ‘This immersion in wich we are submerged is the confession’).

(472)

mula lum-te ku-tup-lam pana (2316) mule top-AD 1pS-walk-FN1 road ‘a mulepath’ (lit. ‘a road which we have to walk on a mule’)

(ii) the suffix -lam can also be used to form a direct object clause. The ALC only contains examples of this construction in which the main verb is in the imperative mood:

(473)

mi-l-o-lam, ohom-aly

l-o-k (1489)

2sA-3sO-do-FN1 without.pause-RST 3sO-do-IMP

‘Do quickly what you have to do!’

(474)

amehe-na a-ki-lam, a-ym-eh-ø (1491) truth-QUOT 1sS-say-FN1 1sO-know-CAU-IMP ‘Teach me what I have to believe’.

(iii): forms in -lam often occur in combination with the copula (pa)k(o)t ‘(to) be (there)’. Three types of clauses can then be distinguished:

257

(a) a subject clause of a main verb (pa)k(o)t ‘(to) be’. In this case, subject of the copula is an impersonal third person singular, while the subject of the form in -lam, meaning ‘obligation’, is another person:

(475)

poho at-mol-e

iglesia-te ki-lya-lam ø-pakt-aõ (1499)

morning one-CL:day-ANT curch-AD 1sS-go-FN1 3sS-be-IA

‘The day after tomorrow we have to go to church’.

(b) a subject clause of a subordinated verb k(o)t ‘(to) be’. In this construction, the subject of the copula is also an impersonal third person singular, while the subject of the form in -lam, meaning ‘obligation’, is co-referential with that of the main verb:

(476)

a-lya-lam ø-kot-nap a-nyan-šip-aõ (916) 1sS-go-FN1 3sS-be-SEQ 1sS-face-break.off-IA ‘Because I have to go, I hurry’.

(c) a nominal predicate. In this case, the copula k(o)t ‘(to) be’ is marked for person, and the subjects of the copula and the form in -lam are identical; -lam expresses ‘custom’, and, occasionally, ‘possibility’:

(477) (478) (479)

tesim i-sak

a-y-la-lam

…e-kt-aõ (408)

always 3pPOS-food 1sO-give-3pA-FN1 3pS-be-IA

‘They always give me their food’.

a-n-utsa

a-l-o-lam

a-kt-aõ (1502)

‘I am in the habit of sinning’.

ki-lya-lam ke-kt-aõ (1504) 1pS-go-FN1 1pS-be-IA ‘We can go’.

(iv) by omission of the copula (viz. of the form -k(o)t-aõ), forms in -lam can also function as the predicate of a main clause, equivalent to forms in -(a)õ ‘imperfective aspect’ or -(i)y/-w ‘past tense’. According to the context, such predicates may indicate an event in the present or in the past:

‘My father gave me permission to give alms to the poor’.

(v) nominalizer -lam can be followed by (a) the benefactive case marker -he. The combination -lam-he is equivalent to the suffix combination -(k)te-he (see the example above), viz. it also expresses a goal or purpose:

(482)

‘A Pharisee prayed Jesus to eat with him’.

(b) the case marker combinations -man-ap ‘from’ and -te-p ‘from’ in order to express ‘avoidance’:

(484)

7.4.6.4. Nominalizer -(õ)o ‘future nominalizer 2' The suffix -(õ)o is normally attached to a non-reduced stem: -o after a consonantfinal stem and -õo after a vowel-final stem. Pedro de la Mata says that the suffix -(õ)o is equivalent to the Latin ending ‘-dus’ (-ndus) of the ‘gerundive’. Forms in

259

-(õ)o refer to a possibility or an obligation and can be used attributively (see also section 6.10). Attributive adjuncts thus formed are marked for first person plural agent and third person object with transitive stems, or first person plural subject with intransitive stems:

(486)

ki-tsa…-o (1078) 1pA-3sO.see-FN2 lit.: ‘something to be seen by us’ > ‘something visible’
> ‘visible’

ø-pakt-aõ (1519)

1pS-eat-FN2 time-already 3sS-be-IA

‘It is already time for dinner’.

The nominalizer -(õ)o has much in common with -lam. Both suffixes can indicate ‘obligation’ and ‘possibility’, are often used in combination whith the copula (pa)k(o)t ‘(to) be’, and can function as an attributive adjunct (see the examples above). In addition, like the forms in -lam, those in -(õ)o can (i) indicate a subject clause when the copula is the main verb and the subject of the copula is an impersonal third person singular:

(489)

palyow ki-kot-o ø-kot-aõ (455) good 1pS-be-FN2 3sS-be-IA ‘We have to be good’.

(ii) Forms in -(õ)o can indicate a nominal predicate. In this sense there are two possibilities: (a) The subject of the copula and that of the form in -(õ)o may refer to the same person:

(490)

mek hayu ki-kol-o

ke-kt-aõ (1522)

all men 1pS-die-FN2 1pS-be-IA

‘All men are mortal’.

(b) The subject of the copula and the object of the form in -(õ)o may be coreferential. In this case the sentence has a passive interpretation (see also the remarks about the passive voice in section 7.3.4.6):

260

‘Prepare the clay today, so that we shall be able to loam the wall

tomorrow’. (lit. ‘Prepare the clay today, so that the wall can be loamed

by us tomorrow’).

A form in -(õ)o can then also express ‘dignified/worthy to be’:

(493)

ki-m-tesah-o

me-kt-aõ (1517)

1pA-2sO-thank-FN2 2sS-be-IA

‘You are dignified/worthy to be thanked by us’.

(iii) They can indicate a direct object clause:

(494)

…aplyoõ i-l-o-õo

tsam-aõ (1609)

pan

3sA-3sO-do-FN2 3sS.know-IA

‘He knows [how] to make pans’.

(iv) Forms in -(õ)o can be used as a main predicate (presumably by omission of the third person singular form -kot-aõ, see also -lam section 7.4.6.3). Such forms occur as a main predicate in exclamations and rhetorical questions:

(495)

1s-ANT 1sS-die-PST 1sS-be-INF-BEN 1sA-3sO.want-FN2

‘I would have preferred to have died myself than that my father had died’.

However, in the following example, the form in -(õ)o occurs in a clause which is apparently neither an exclamation nor a rhetorical question, although it may have to be interpreted as such:

(499)

a-m-a-ym-eh-o

a-kot-o (1520)

1sA-2sO-APL-know-CAU-FN2 1sS-be-FN2

‘I shall be able to teach you’.

Like the nominalizer -(k)te, future nominalizer -(õ)o can be followed by -(k)e ‘anteriority’ (see section 7.4.3). The combination -(õ)o-ke, like -(k)te-ke, occurs in de la Mata’s ‘optative’ paradigm. It also indicates that an event could or would take/have taken place, and it is also used to express a wish or a non-realized event. A form in -(õ)o-ke can function (a) as a main predicate:

(500)

inam palyow mi-kot-o-ke atih (354) hopefully good 2sS-be-FN2-ANT INTJ ‘Oh, I wished you were good!’

(b) as a subordinated predicate:

7.4.6.5. Nominalizer -(w)u… ‘agentive’ The suffix -(w)u… is an agentive marker: -u… occurs both after a consonant-final and a vowel-final stem, -wu… occurs only after a vowel-final stem. (It is possible that -u… after a vowel was in fact pronounced as -wu…). The suffix indicates the one who
performs an action:

kot-u… (432)
õole-u… (974) penyo-wu… (861)

‘the one who is’ ‘the one who loves him/her/it’ ‘the one who wants’

7.4.6.6. Deictics ko and iõko The demonstratives ko ‘this one’ and iõko ‘that one’ can be attached to a finite verb form and function as a nominalizer. The difference in use of -ko and -iõko is
illustrated in section 7.4.6.6.1 and 7.4.6.6.2, respectively.

30 No other instances of kel or õel ‘(to) look for’ have been found.

264

7.4.6.6.1. Nominalizer -ko Nominalizer -ko ‘this one’ is attached to a present tense form in -(a)õ ‘imperfective aspect’. Forms in -(a)õ-ko are analyzed as present participle forms in the ALC, and function as headless relative clauses ‘the one who ...’:

(518)

a-kt-aõ-ko (436) 1sS-be-IA-DEM ‘I who am’

Nominalized forms in -ko can be followed by (i) the causal case marker -(lyak-)pat:

(522)

pana išiwah ø-pakt-aõ-ko-pat ma nyansik-pat road bad 3sS-be-IA-DEM-INS INT difficulty-INS mi-pahat-iy-ha me-kt-iy-ha-õ (320) 2S-descend-PST-PL 2sS-be-SE-PL-IA ‘Because the road was bad, you (p) have descended with much difficulty’.

(ii) the ablative case marker -man-ap, meaning ‘(rather) than’, ‘instead of’:

‘I would have preferred to have died myself, rather than that my father had

died’.

(iii) the comparative case marker -(mi)ny. After the nominalizer -ko, the short form -ny is used:

7.4.6.6.2. Nominalizer -iõko The nominalizing deictic -iõko ‘that one’ is attached to a preterite form in -(i)y/-w, a ‘pluperfect’ in -(k)e and a future form in -(k)t-aõ. The forms in -(i)y-iõko/-w-iõko, -(k)e-iõko and -(k)t-aõ-iõko are analyzed by de la Mata as preterite, pluperfect and future participles, respectively, and, like those in -ko, they are also translated as headless relatives ‘the one who ...’. However, the forms in -iõko have an alternative form without this deictic. These alternative forms are apparently nominalized by
means of a zero-marker:

(527)

a-menyo-w-iõko (861) 1sA-3sO.want-PST-DEM ‘I who wanted him/her/it’

cf. a-menyo-w-ø (861) 1sA-3sO.want-PST-NOM ‘I who wanted him/her/it’

(528)

ø-kot-iy-e-iõko (434) 3sS-be-PST-ANT-DEM ‘he who had been’

cf. ø-kot-iy-e-ø (434) 3sS-be-PST-ANT-NOM ‘he who had been’

(529)

i-õole-kt-aõ-iõko (800) 3sA-3sO.love-F-IA-DEM ‘he who will love him/her/it’

cf. i-õole-kt-aõ-ø (800) 3sA-3sO.love-F-IA-NOM ‘he who will love him/her/it’

A future ‘participle’ or agentive can also be formed by means of a nominalized form in -lam, whether or not followed by the demonstrative -iõko:

(530) a-õole-lam-iõko (802)

cf.

1sA-3sO.love-FN1-DEM

‘I who shall love him/her/it’

a-õole-lam (802) 1sA-3sO.love-FN1 ‘I who shall love him/her/it’

Like -ko, -iõko can also be used as a relativizer and indicate a relative clause. The antecedent can be both (i) the subject:

266

(531)

mek sina-y-la-iõko

i-…ikn-eh-no-w (1464)

all 3sO.hear-PST-3pA-DEM 3pS-be.frightened-CAU-RFL-PST

‘Everyone who heard it was amazed’.

and (ii) the object:

(532)

kalis a-ø-ših-lam-iõko

mi-ø-ših-ha-õo-le

chalice 1sA-3sO-drink-FN1-DEM 2A-3sO-drink-PL-FN2-QM

me-kt-iy-ha-õ (1490)

2S-be-SE-PL-IA

‘Can you (p) drink the chalice which I have to drink?’

Forms without -iõko, viz. forms which are nominalized by means of a zero-marker or the suffix -lam (see section 7.4.6.3) can also indicate a relative clause. In the former case, the antecedent of the clause can then also be either the subject or the object; in the latter case, the antecedent is the object:

(533)

7.4.6.7. Overview
Table 7.7. presents a survey of the different phrase types formed by means of the stem nominalizers -(e)…, -(k)te, -lam -(õ)o, and the finite form nominalizers -ko and -iõko. In this table the following abbreviation is used: attr. ext. dir. obj. ‘attributive
extension of the direct object’. Table 7.8. presents a survey of the different types of clauses formed by means of -(e)…, -(k)te, -lam, -(õ)o, -ko when followed by the suffixes -he, -(k)e, -(lyak-)pat, -man-ap, -(mi)ny, -(n)ap, -pat-le, -te, -te-p, -tu-p and

267
-tu-p(-ham)-pit. Note, however, that the nominalizer -(e)… can only be followed by the case marker -(a)p/-nap, if preceded by the negator -p(e).

It appears that most (ten) of the fourteen phrase types mentioned in Table 7.7 and 7.8 can be formed by means of a nominalization in -(õ)o, whether or not followed by suffixes; that seven can be formed by means of a nominalization in -lam (+ suffixes); five by means of the nominalizer -(e)… (+ -(n)ap); four by means of -(k)te (+ suffixes); four by means of -ko (+ suffixes); and only one, a relative clause, by means of -ko and -iõko.

7.4.7. Subordinators The following suffixes and suffix combinations indicate subordination: -hu, -(k)he, -(n)ap, and -e… or -(k)t-e…, i.e. they indicate that the event expressed by the verb is related to another event, and that the verb at issue is subordinated to the verb expressing that other event. The relation indicated by these subordinators may be causal, concessive, consecutive, purposive and temporal. Regularly, -hu, -(k)he, -(n)ap and -e…/-(k)t-e… occur in the same slot as the nominalizers mentioned above, viz. they are also directly suffixed to the verb stem. However, -(n)ap can also be suffixed to the stem extension markers -(i)y/-w and -e(y) (see section 7.4.2.1 and 7.4.2.2, respectively).
Subordinators resemble nominalizers in that both are suffixed to a non-reduced stem (except for subordinator -(e)…, which is attached to a reduced stem) and that both can indicate a subordinate clause, except for nominalizer -(w)u…. They differ from each other in that, unlike some nominalized forms, subordinated forms cannot be used as a noun or adjective, nor as a main predicate. By contrast, the use of the subordinators -hu, -(k)he and -(n)ap, is explicitely associated with a change or nonchange of subject. Subordinator -e…/-(k)t-e… has a restricted use, as we shall see.

7.4.7.1. Subordinator -hu ‘different subjects’ The use of -hu always implies switch-reference (subjects of the subordinate clause and main clause are not identical). The semantic relation between the subordinate clause and the main clause is either causal, or temporal. The following sentences are examples of the use of -hu as a causal subordinator:

(536)

tsi mahat-te ø-pokot-hu, u…uah ø-pakt-aõ (416) rain 3sS.fall-F 3sS-be-SR warmth 3sS-be-IA ‘It is warm, because it will rain’.

In the following sentences -hu functions as a temporal subordinator ‘when’:

(537)

p-a-ym-eh-u…

mi-kot-hu, mi-nlyo

a-kt-iy (421)

3pO-APL-know-CAU-AG 2sS-be-SR 2sPOS-disciple 1sS-be-PST

‘When you were a teacher, I was your disciple’.

(538)

resaõ …i-ki-y-…o

ø-kot-hu, iglesia-te mi-n-iy-ha-õ (422)

prayer 3pS-say-PST-already 3sS-be-SR church-AD 2S-go-SE-PL-IA

‘You (p) go to church, when they have already said [their] prayers’.

Subordination in -hu is only found with verbs of class 1 and 2. For other classes (3, 4, 5) this function is suppleted by nominalized forms in -(e)… (see Table 7.6 and section 7.4.6.1). The suffix -hu must be preceded by a consonant, so that it can neither be suffixed to plural marker -ha, nor to the third person plural agent marker -la. After these suffixes an element -… is found instead of -hu. (De la Mata

269

puts them in one paradigm). Note, however, that, in combination with this element -…, the second person plural marker -ha occurs after the non-reduced stem of class 1 verbs and is not preceded by a stem extension marker:

(539) (540) (541)

a-kot-hu (392) mi-kot-hu (393) mi-kot-ha-… (396)

(*mi-kot-ha-hu)

‘as I am’ ‘as you are’ ‘as you (p) are’

(542) (543) (544)

i-ø-ših-iah-hu (960)

‘as he drinks it again’

ki-ø-ših-iah-hu (960)

‘as we drink it again’

ø-ših-iah-la-… (960) (*ø-ših-iah-la-hu) ‘as they drink it again’

(A form, such as me-kt-iy-ha-…, with a reduced class 1 verb stem + stem extension, followed by the plural marker -ha and the ending -…, has been attested. However, in those cases the reduced stem + stem extender + -ha-… indicate ‘purpose’ or ‘result’
(see section 7.4.7.4). Like the nominalized forms in -(e)…, forms in -hu
(i) can be followed by the verbs mas(o) ‘(to) take all night’ and pats(a) ‘(to) take all
day’:

(545)

(ii) have been encountered in the function of an attributive extension of the object with the verb y(a)…/y(a)š ‘(to) see’:

(548)

‘Give [him] pine cones, [and] you will see him die’.

270

7.4.7.2. Subordinator -(k)he ‘simultaneity’ The subordinator -(k)he indicates that the event expressed by the verb takes place simultaneously with the event expressed by the main verb. The semantic relation between both verbs can be (i) causal:

(549)

palyow kot-he, tsamo-… a-kot-t-aõ (405) good be-SIM know-FAC 1sS-be-F-IA ‘Because I am good, I shall be learned’.

(ii) temporal:

mi-amo-ki-na ki-khe (776)

1sPOS-company 2sS-eat-IMP-QUOT say-SIM

‘A Pharisee prayed Jesus saying: “Eat with me!”’

A form in -(k)he need not be marked for person when the subject of the stem to which -(k)he is suffixed is identical to that of the main verb (co-reference), see the examples above. When the subjects of the subordinated verb and main verb are not identical, the former is regularly marked for person:

(551)

palyow me-kt-e…, i-m-pas-aõ-sim,

mu-lu-poh-he-pits-o (425)

FN2

‘He advises you, so that you will be good, not to abhor you’.

In the following examples, the form in -(k)he is used together with a copula ‘(to) be’. It can then function (i) as a subject clause, when the subject of the copula is an impersonal third person subject:

(552)

‘It is better for you to enter into paradise weak and lame, than to be

thrown with both feet and both hands into the eternal fire’.

271

(ii) as a copula complement, when subjects of the copula and the form in -(k)he are identical:

(553)

ip-ta-pi

ay…a ø-lyup-he i-toõ (1315)

two-CL:firm/stony-AL meat 3sO-eat-SIM 3pS-be.INCOM

‘Both are eating meat’.

Subordinator -(k)he can be followed by the following case markers: (i) ablative -(a)/ -nap ‘after’:

7.4.7.3. Subordinator -(n)ap ‘sequential’ (‘after’) The suffix -(n)ap indicates ‘succession’, ‘sequence’, viz. that the event expressed by the subordinated verb takes place before another event (cf. -(k)e, see section 7.4.3). It can be translated as ‘after’. In forms in -(n)ap, personal reference can be omitted when the subject of the verb is identical to that of the main verb (cf. the forms in -(k)he, section 7.4.7.2, which behave similarly in this respect). The form -ap occurs after a stem in h and, once, after a stem in p; -nap occurs elswhere: e.g.:

273

The form is furthermore encountered after a non-reduced stem followed by the stem extension marker -e(y) (see section 7.4.2.2). We have not found a difference in meaning between -nap and -e-nap:

274

7.4.7.4. Subordinator -e…/-(k)t-e… ‘purpose’ The suffix -e…/-(k)t-e… is used to form a resultative or a purposive clause. When this suffix is used, the subject of the main verb and the subordinated verb are not coreferential. The form -e… is found after reduced verb stems of class 1; -(k)t-e… (which contains the future marker -(k)t(e)) is encountered after non-reduced verb stems of class 2, 3 and 5 (see Table 7.6). (The ending -(k)t-e… is not found with a class 4 verb stem. This may be attributed to a lack of data). The -e… forms occurring with class 1 verbs can refer both to a purpose and to a result:

7.4.8. Finite verb forms followed by case markers A number of case markers occur after present tense forms in -(a)õ ‘imperfective aspect’ or preterite forms in -(i)y/-w ‘past tense’. It may be argued that these forms are nominalized by means of a zero-marker (see section 7.4.2.1). This is supported by the fact that the demonstratives ko ‘this here’ and iõko ‘that there’ can occupy the slot of this putative zero-marker (see section 7.4.6.6). The case markers found after finite verb forms and their usual meanings are -(lyak-)pat ‘with’, ‘because of’, ‘by’; -(lyak-)te-p ‘by’, ‘through’; -man-ap ‘after’, ‘from’; -(mi)ny ‘as’, ‘like’; -te ‘at’, ‘in’.
In one special case, -(mi)ny is also found after a non-reduced stem. The markers mentioned above, occurring after nouns, pronouns or demonstratives, have already been analyzed in chapter six. It is clear, however, that the meaning of these case markers changes when they occur after finite verb forms. In most cases, a spatial meaning changes into a temporal one, and an instrumental into a causal one. The difference in interpretation between the nominal use and the verbal use of these

276

suffixes is shown in Table 7.10 below. In this table the following abbreviations
occur: CAU ‘causal’, CMP ‘comparative’, INS ‘instrumental’, SPA ‘spatial’, TEMP ‘temporal’. With the suffix combination -lyak-pat both the nominal and the verbal
interpretation are causal. Therefore, it is not shown in Table 7.10.

7.4.8.1. Case marker (-lyak)-pat ‘because’ In section 6.4.2.9 we have seen that the instrumental case marker -pat is often found in combination with the element -lyak-, and that -lyak-pat has a causal meaning. When instrumental -pat occurs after nominalized finite verb forms, it also has a causal meaning:

(576)

šalam me-kt-aõ-ø-pat a-m-lu-po-õ (190) weak 2sS-be-IA-NOM-INS 1sA-2sO-interior-burn-IA ‘I abhor you, because you are weak’.

Dios-tu-p yam

mo-o-w (777)

God-AD-ABL punishment 3sA.3pO-do-PST

‘Because the sins of men where that many, God punished them’.

The suffix sequence -lyak-pat, when occurring after nominalized finite verb forms, is synonymous with ø-kot-nap (see also section 7.4.6.3):

(578)

mita-y-la-ø-lyak-pat

…i-po-šay…-aõ (2374)

‘because they missed it’

277

7.4.8.2. Case marker (-lyak)-te-p ‘after’; ‘as’, ‘like’; ‘because’ The suffix sequence -te-p, a combination of the non-personal adessive case marker -te and the ablative case marker -(a)p, can have a temporal meaning when it is suffixed to a zero-nominalized finite verb form:

(580)

hayu a-kt-iy-ø-te-p (2633) man 1sS-become-PST-NOM-AD-ABL ‘after I became a man’

It can then also mean ‘as’ or ‘like’ and correlate two clauses:

(581)

kamatsiõ mi-ki-y-ø-te-p

order

2sS-do-PST-NOM-AD-ABL

‘We do it as you ordered’.

ki-l-ø-aõ (2360) 1pA-3sO-do-IA

The suffix combination -te-p can also have a causal meaning. It can then be preceded by -lyak (for an interpretation of the element -lyak, see section 6.4.2.9, 6.4.3.3, and section 7.4.8.1 above). The sequence (-lyak)-te-p can also occur after a nominalized form in -ko. In its causal reading (-lyak)-te-p is synonymous with (-lyak)-pat and ø-kot-nap:

(582)

ø-kot-nap (1763)

1sA-2sO-love-IA-DEM 3sS-be-SEQ

‘because I love you’

7.4.8.3. Case marker -man-ap ‘after’; ‘besides’; ‘than (in comparisons)’ The suffix combination -man-ap (consisting of inessive -man and ablative -(a)p, see section 6.4.2.1) can have a temporal meaning, indicating that the event takes place before another event (cf. -(k)e ‘after’, ‘anteriority’, ‘nominal past’, section 7.4.3; and -(n)ap ‘after’, ‘anteriority’, section 7.4.7.3), when occurring after nominalized forms in -(i)y:

278

(585)

mi-pot-iy-ø-man-ap,

ol-pit ø-moh-p-aõ (203)

2sS-come-PST-NOM-INES-ABL who-IND 3sS-go.up-NE-IA

‘After you came, nobody has come [up]’.

The inessive-ablative case marker combination -man-ap can then also mean ‘besides’:

(586)

owlum Martin i-tsah-iy-ø-man-ap

i-mo-õ (1637)

snake Martin 3sA-3sO.bite-PST-NOM-INES-ABL 3sA-3sO.burn-IA

‘The snake, besides having bitten Martin, is [also] giving him a fever’.

In section 7.4.6.2 and 7.4.6.4, respectively, we have seen that a comparative
clause is formed when -man-ap is suffixed to a nominalized verb form in -(k)te and (õ)o; and that the form in -man-ap is often used in combination with the adverb ašmaõ ‘first’. A comparative clause is also formed when -man-ap is suffixed to a zero-nominalized finite form in -(a)õ of the imperfective aspect or -(i)y/-w ‘past tense’:

(587)

Dios-tu-p hayu castigaõ mo-o-w-ø-man-ap, God-AD-ABL men punishment 3sA.3pO-do-PST-NOM-INES-ABL ašmaõ perdonaõ mo-o-w (1631) first forgiveness 3sA.3pO-do-PST ‘God rather forgave men than that he punished them’.

(588)

tsoyo-kt-aõ-ø-man-ap

ašmaõ ø-maksa-kt-aõ (1633)

3sS.cry-F-IA-NOM-INES-ABL first

3sS-rejoice-F-IA

‘He will rather rejoice than that he will cry’.

7.4.8.4. Case marker -(mi)ny ‘as’, ‘like’; ‘on the verge of’ As stated, the comparative case marker -(mi)ny can also be suffixed to a nominalized
finite verb form, retaining its comparative meaning. With these verb forms, the long form -miny is always found:

(589)

kamatsiõ mi-ki-y-ø-miny (2320) order 2sS-do-PST-NOM-CMP ‘as you ordered’

However, when the nominalized finite verb form + -miny is followed by the suffix -…o ‘already’, and the form in -miny-…o is used in combination with the verb forms kot-he and ø-kot-hu, the suffix sequence -miny-…o can have a temporal
connotation and be translated as ‘on the verge of’:

279

(590)

i-ø-…-aõ-ø-miny-…o

ø-kot-hu ku…i-wa,

3sA-3sO-pig-IA-NOM-CMP-already 3sS-be-SR pig-TOP

ki-ø-lam-iy (1560)

1pA-3sO-kill-PST

‘As for the pig, being on the verge of giving birth, we killed her’.

This construction is also found with non-reduced verb stems. Assumedly, the stem is then also nominalized by means of a zero-nominalizer:

(591)

õol-ø-miny-…o

kot-he, i-ø-…-ey (1559)

3sS.die-NOM-CMP-already be-SIM 3sA-3sO-pig-PST

‘Being on the verge of dying, she gave birth’.

7.4.8.5. Case marker -te ‘when’, ‘where’ When the impersonal adessive case marker -te is suffixed to a nominalized finite form, it can have temporal meaning: ‘(at the time) when’, alongside its spatial meaning: ‘in/at (the place where)’:

(592)

ki-y-iy-ø-te (180) 1pS-sleep-PST-NOM-AD ‘where we slept’

(593)

ki-lya-pits-iy-ø-te (182) 1pS-go-do.incidentally-PST-NOM-AD ‘when we incidentally left’

7.5. Impersonal verbs Pedro de la Mata gives only one example of what he calls an impersonal verb: pak(o)t/ pok(o)t ‘be (there)’. With this verb weather situations can be expressed:

(594)

mise ø-pakt-aõ (2196) cold 3sS-be-IA ‘It is cold’.

The ‘irrealis’ forms in -(k)te-ke and -(õ)o-ke (see section 7.4.6.2 and 7.4.6.4, respectively) of the verb k(o)t ‘(to) be’ also have an impersonal use. The verb k(o)t is then an alternative for impersonal pak(o)t/pok(o)t ‘be (there)’:

(595)

a-kt-iy ø-kot-te-ke/

ø-pokot-te-ke (377)

1sS-be-PST 3sO-be-INF-ANT/ 3sO-be-INF-ANT

‘that I had to be’

(596)

a-kt-iy ø-kot-o-ke/ 1sS-be-PST 3sS-be-FN2-ANT/ ‘that I had to be’

ø-pokot-o-ke (377) 3sS-be-FN2-ANT

280

7.6. Neutral verbs De la Mata says about his so-called neutral verbs ‘verbos neutros’ that they have no ‘pasión’, i.e. no direct object. In Mata’s conception, these neutral verbs appear to be intransitive verbs with an impersonal, zero-marked, third person singular subject, and an applicative object (see section 7.2.5 for the subject markers; and section 7.2.5 for the applicative markers):

(597)

ø-m-a-lyaw-aõ (1816) 3sS-2sO-APL-go-IA ‘it goes away on behalf of/from you’

(598)

ø-ha-tiki-aõ (1843) 3sS-3sO.APL-become/concern-IA ‘it concerns him’

(599)

ka… ø-m-a-pakt-aõ-le (276) maize 3sS-2sO-APL-be.there-IA-QM ‘Do you by any chance have maize?’

(600)

ø-k-a-toõ (285) 3sS-1pO-APL-be.there ‘it is there for us’/’we have’

7.7. Verbs derived from nouns Verbs can be derived from nouns by means of the suffix -(w)o/ -(w)e(h), meaning ‘(to) do’, ‘(to) make’. They then behave like verbs of class 5 (-o > -ø/_ -aõ) and class 2 (-eh > -e / _ -(a)õ, -y), respectively (see section 7.3.1). The forms -w(o) and we(h), normally found after a vowel, can also occur after a consonant. (The form -we(h) may be an amalgamation of the verbalizer -(w)o + causativizer -(k)e(h), which can also be used as a verbalizer, see below). The forms -o and -e(h), are only found after a consonant:

(601)

In one example verbalizer -(w)o is used as a verb meaning ‘(to) do’and translated as ‘(to) count’:

(609)

pe mek …e-kt-iy ø-kot-nap, into-ny ki-po-wo-pakna that all 3pS-be-PST 3sS-be-SEQ which-CMP 1pA-3pO-do-NE.NOM …e-kt-aõ (60) 3pS-be-IA ‘Since they were that many, they could not be counted [by us]’.

Causativizer -(k)e(h) can also function as a verbalizer. It forms a transitive verb, and it can function as an alternative for (o) ‘(to) do’. In the paradigm of the derived verb n-eštek-(o)/ n-eštek-eh ‘(to) clothe someone’, for instance, both (o) and -(k)e(h) are encountered:

(610)

a-ø-n-eštek-ø-aõ (2064) 1sA-3sO-REL-cloth-do-IA ‘I clothe him/her/it’

(611)

a-ø-n-eštek-eh-t-aõ (2064) 1sA-3sO-REL-cloth-VB-F-IA ‘I shall clothe him/her/it’

A reflexive verb ‘(to) clothe oneself’ is then regularly formed by means of the derivational suffix -n(o) ‘reflexive’:

(612)

a-n-eštek-o-n-aõ (2063) 1sS-REL-cloth-do-RFL-IA ‘I clothe myself’.

7.8. Fixed expressions In the ALC, much attention is payed to constructions consisting of a noun and a verb which together form a fixed or idiomatoc expression. Pedro de la Mata gives many examples of these. They are formed by means of the verbs ki ‘(to) be’, ‘(to) become’, k(o)t ‘(to) be’, ly(a)w ‘(to) become’, ‘(to) turn into’, t(a)/to ‘(to) do’, ‘(to) make’ and tiki ‘(to) become’. The verbs ki and k(o)t are copula; the verb ly(a)w, usually an intransitive verb meaning ‘(to) go away’ (see section 7.3), here also functions as a copula; the verb t(a)/ to sometimes functions as a verb with a direct object and an indirect object, i.e. a beneficiary; tiki is the impersonal counterpart of ki. The noun preceding k(o)t and t(a)/ to may be accompanied with a possessive

282

marker. When fixed expressions are formed by means of the verbs ki, ly(a)w and tiki the preceding noun or subject complement is never accompanied by a possessive marker:

(613) (615)

hulum a-ki-aõ (1862) fat(ness) 1sS-become-IA ‘I become fat’.
kes a-ki-aõ (1860) age 1sS-become-IA ‘I grow’.

u…uah a-ki-aõ (1857) warmth 1sS-be-IA ‘I am warm’.
hayu ø-ki-y (1961) man 3sS-become-PST ‘He became a man’.

When the idiomatic expression is formed by means of the copula k(o)t, noun and verb take the same person marker:

(623)

a-kulyha a-kt-aõ (1851) 1sPOS-life 1sS-be-IA ‘I live’.

(624)

õulyha ø-kot-aõ (1852) 3sPOS.lif 3sS-be-IA ‘He lives’.

(625)

kapak a-kulyha a-kt-aõ (1852) ruler 1sPOS-life 1sS-be-IA ‘I reign’.

In expressions with ly(a)w, like in those with ki, the copula complement is not marked for person:

(626)

pey a-lyw-aõ (1905) earth 1sS-become-IA ‘I become earth’.

‘With the words of the consecration, the host, which had been bread,

became the body of our father Jesus Christ’.

In compounds with t(a)/ t(o) ‘(to) do’, ‘(to) make’, t(a)/ t(o) can take the beneficiary prefix t- ‘3sB’ (see section 7.2.6) when it concerns a third person singular. The preceding noun does not take personal reference:

(634)

kes a-ta-õ (2117) age 1sA-make-IA ‘I breed/ bring up/ raise’.

(635)

kot a-ta-õ (2116) water 1sA-do-IA ‘I fetch water’.

(636)

mesa a-ta-õ (2115) table 1sA-do-IA ‘I lay the table’.

(637)

Dios mu…aõ a-t-ta-õ (2120) God prayer 1sA-3sB-do-IA ‘I pray to God for him’.

When the beneficiary concerns another person than a third person singular, t(a)/ t(o) is preceded by an applicative object. The preceding noun is again not marked for person:

284

(638) (639) (640)

mu…aõ ki-m-a-to-ha-kt-aõ (2132) prayer 1pA-2O-APL-do-PL-F-IA ‘We shall pray for you (p)’.
Dios mu…aõ a-m-a-ta-õ (2121) God prayer 1sA-2sO-APL-do-IA ‘I recommend you to God’.
Dios mu…aõ õ-a-ta-õ (2125) God prayer 3sA-1sO.APL-do-IA ‘He prays for me’.

When agent and beneficiary are the same person, the preceding noun takes personal reference. The possessive marker then corresponds to the agent marker:

(641)

a-n-eštek

a-ø-ta-õ (2118)

1sPOS-REL-cloth 1sA-3sO-do-IA

‘I make my clothes’.

(642)

a-yelam a-ø-ta-õ (2114) 1sPOS-bed 1sA-3sO-do-IA ‘I make my bed’.

In expressions formed with the verb tiki, the preceding noun is not accompanied by a possessive marker. The verb functions as an impersonal verb and the impersonal third person singular subject is not marked. The person markers which do occur with tiki indicate an indirect or applicative object: the person affected by the event. Examples:

(643)

a-tsla

kama ø-a-tiki-aõ (1841)

1sPOS-wife ill(ness) 3sS-1sO.APL-become-IA

(645)

ø-k-a-tiki-aõ (1844)

‘We colour’.

(646)

tsitsal ø-m-a-tiki-y-ha-õ (1845) black 3sS-2O-APL-become-SE-PL-IA ‘You (p) turn black’.

285

(647)

kisna ø-p-a-ha-tiki-aõ (1846) blue 3sS-3pO-APL-PL-become-IA ‘They turn blue’.

(648)

pulyaly ø-a-tiki-aõ (1847) yellow 3sS-1sO.APL-become-IA ‘I turn yellow’.

The noun mu…aõ ‘prayer’, which we have seen together with the verb t(a)/ t(o) ‘(to) do/make’, can also occur with tiki. When this is the case, tiki is synonymous with t(a)/ t(o) and also functions as a ditransitive verb. It is then used personally and can also be preceded by the beneficiary marker t-:

(649)

mu…aõ a-t-tiki-aõ (2134) prayer 1sA-3sB-do-IA ‘I pray/ intercede for someone’.

(650)

Dios mu…aõ a-m-a-tiki-y-ha-õ (2122) God prayer 1sA-2O-APL-do-SE-PL-IA ‘I recommend you (p) to God’.

(651)

8. Adverbs Cholón appears to have a small class of adverbs. Only 29 underived adverbs have been encountered in the ALC (see section 8.1). Other adverbs (section 8.2) are regularly de-rived by means of the restrictive case marker -(a)ly ‘only’, ‘nothing else but’ (see section 6.4.5.1). Adverbs occur before the verb phrase or clause-initially.

8.1. Underived adverbs The underived adverbs found in de la Mata’s data are the following:

1: ampek, empek ‘good’, ‘allright’:

(1) domingo-lol-te fiesta-lol-te-pit ki-piyip-pakna ke-kt-aõ,

sunday-PL-AD feast-PL-AD-COR 1pS-work-NE.NOM 1pS-be-IA

alum nem-te-a

ampek ki-piyip-o ke-kt-aõ (1575)

other day-AD-TOP allright 1pS-work-FN2 1pS-be-IA

‘On sundays and feasts we may not work, on the other days we may work’.

(2) liman-te

a-lya-õo-ke

mu-tu

a-an-aõ

mountain-AD 1sS-go-FN2-ANT 2sPOS-direction 1sS-come-IA

m-a-lu-pokot-te-he

empek-le a-lya-õo (2799)

2sA-1sO-interior-be-INF-BEN allright-QM 1sS-go-FN2

‘Since I want to go to the mountains, I come to you, so that you can advise

me if it is allright for me to go’.

2: ašmaõ ‘first. With this suffix a comparison can be formed. It then often correlates with -man-ap ‘than’ (see section 6.11.3):

(3) mi-lya-pe-…-ap ko ašmaõ mi-l-o-ki (2825)

2sS-go-NE-FAC-ABL this first

2sA-3sO-do-IMP

‘Before you go, do this first!’

(4) mi-man-ap ok ašmaõ a-mso-w (1627) 2s-INES-ABL 1s first 1sS-be.born-PST ‘I was born earlier than/ prior to you’. ‘I am older than you’.

(5) ašmaõ mi-he palyow ø-kot-aõ (1632) first 2s-BEN good 3sS-be-IA ‘This is better for you’.

288

3: atsiw ‘frequently’:

(6) [...] ma atsiw

kama ki-ki-õo

ke-kt-iy

[...] INT frequently disease 1pS-become-FN2 1pS-be-PST

kot-nap [...] (1204)

be-SQ [...]

‘because very frequently we contracted diseases’

4: hanap, henap ‘take care’, when followed by an imperative or by an exclamation marker:

(7) hanap mi-õole-k-nik (730) take.care 2sA-3sO.love-IMP-NE ‘Take care, do not love him!’

(8) henap-ah (2626) take.care-EX ‘Look out!’

(9) henap išiwah mi-kot-…in (339) take.care bad 2sS-be-NE ‘Beware, do not be bad!’

Elsewhere, henap means ‘by accident’ (hanap has not been found elsewhere). The
form henap can then be followed by the restrictive case marker and adverbalizer (a)ly, or by co-ordinator -pit ‘also’:

(10) henap-aly (2610) (11) henap-pit (2628)

‘by accident’ ‘by accident’

5: hapit ‘maybe’:

(12) hapit poho-pat Francisco ø-nan-t-aõ (32) maybe morning-INS Francisco 3sS-come-F-IA ‘Maybe Francisco will come tomorrow’.

The adverb hapit can also mean ‘beware’ and express a warning, when used before a negative imperative (cf. hanap and henap above). (-pit may be indentified as the coordinator):

(13) hapit mi-õole-…in (342) beware 2sA-3sO.love-NE ‘Beware, do not love him/her/it!’.

(14) hapit i-õole-k-nik (731) beware 3sA-3sO.love-IMP-NE ‘Beware, let him not love him/her/it’.

289

6: henat (2744) ‘then’, ‘in that case’ (examples are missing);

7: i(h)na ‘thus’30. The adverb i(h)na is equivalent to pe-ny ‘like that’:

(15) ihna (2738) ‘thus’

cf. pe-ny (2738) that-CMP ‘thus’

(16) ina-…-he (2710) thus-REP-IS ‘they say that [it is] thus’

pe-ny-a…-he (2711) that-CMP-REP-IS ‘they say that [it is] thus’

8: ina(ha)m ‘I wish’:
(17) inam palyow mi-kot-o-ke, atih (354) I.wish good 2sS-be-FN2-ANT alas ‘Alas, I wish you would have been good!’.
(18) inaham palyow a-kot-o-ke (352) I.wish good 1sS-be-FN2-ANT ‘I wish I would have been good’.
(19) inaham palyow a-kot-te-ke (352) I.wish good 1sS-be-INF-ANT ‘I wish I would have been good’.

9: ihna ‘quick’:

(20) ihna-…u (1087) quick-DIM ‘Hurry up’.

(21) ihna k-a-t-hil-u… (2707) quick 1pO-APL-3sB-speak-AG ‘Come on, lawyer!’

10: kapi ‘now’, ‘today’:
(22) kapi lya-k (2691) now go-IMP ‘Go now!’

31 Cf. Quechua hina ‘as’, ‘like’

290

11: lyem ‘still’:

(25) lyem sa…-aõ (1177) still 3sS.make/cultivate.a.field-IA ‘He is still making/cultivating a field’.

(27) ø-tsip-te

ma ø-pakt-aõ (489)

3sPOS-house not 3sS-be-IA

‘He is not at home’.

14: ma ‘high degree’. The morpheme ma is an intensifer indicating a high degree:

(28) ma hulap (1228) INT wide ‘very wide’

(29) ma pulkup (1233) INT midnight ‘in the midst of the night’

It is used to form a superlative (see section 6.11.3). A high degree is also expressed by means of the forms maha-ly, ma-ma, ma-ma-ta, ma pa-te-p and pa-te-p ma,
related to ma (see also section 6.11.3):

(30) maha-ly (1239)
INT-RST
‘a lot of’

19: patsanywetset (2623) ‘the other way round’ (examples are missing);

20: payam ‘almost’ is often found together with the suffix -…o ‘already’:

(37) payam-…o

‘I bet, you are not going off again in order to catch enemies’.

24: šipna ‘quick’, a synonym of ihna ‘quick’ above. De la Mata gives four examples
of the use of šipna. In these examples šipna is followed by the restrictive case marker and adverbalizer -(a)ly (see section 8.2). Examples:

(42) ma šipna-ly (2669) INT quick-RST ‘very quickly’

(43) šipna-ly ø-nan-t-aõ (2670) quick-RST 3sS-come-F-IA ‘He will come quickly’.

8.2. Adverbalizer -(a)ly Adverbs can be derived from noun stems by means of the restrictive case marker (a)ly ‘only’, ‘nothing else but’, functioning as an adverbalizer31:
(51) alyhi-aly (2646) sweetness-RST gently, softly

In addition, it can be suffixed to (i) a noun (phrase):

9. Interjections Pedro de la Mata mentions several interjections in his Arte. He also distinguishes a small number of ‘defective verbs’ which we may consider as interjections. The interjections mentioned by de la Mata can be divided into three categories: 1: interjections expressing a physical experience:

cold: heat: pain:

alew32 (2953)
u…u(u) (2935) alyaw33 (2938)

They occur clause-finally:

(1) anyiw,

ina-ham liman-te

a-moh-t-aõ, alew (1556)

INTJ:anticipation thus-CE mountain-AD 1sS-go.up-F-IA INTJ:cold

‘[Oh] What if I have to go up into the mountains? [Brrr!]’

(2) anyiw,

ina-ham ampe putam-maõ a-pat-t-aõ,

u…u (1557)

INTJ:anticipation thus-CE depth world-INES 1sS-descend-F-IA INTJ:heat

‘[Oh] What if I have to descend into the underworld? [Pfff!]’

(3) anyiw,

ina-ham a-šayš-la-kt-aõ alyaw (1558)

INTJ:anticipation thus-CE 1sO-whip-3pA-F-IA INTJ:pain

‘[Oh] What if they are going to whip me? [Ouch!]’

The expression alew can also be used as a noun meaning ‘cold’. It then occurs clause-initially:

(4) heey, alew-na a-ki-aõ (2955) INTJ cold-QUOT 1sS-be-IA ‘Yes, I am cold’.

2: interjections indicating a state of mind or feeling. They also usually occur clausefinally, but for anih, expressing ‘surprise’, and anyiw ‘anticipation’, which are found
clause-initially:

(5) anih

into-ny-am

a-ki-aõ (2779)

INTJ:surprise which-CMP-QM 1sS-be-IA

‘[Oh] What will befall me?’

33 Cf. Quechua alaláw ‘brrr!’ 34 Cf. Quechua ayáw, ayayáw ‘ouch!’

296

(6) anyiw

into-ny-am

a-ki-aõ (2779)

INTJ:anticipation which-CMP-QM 1sA-be-IA

‘[Oh] What will befall me?’

Interjections which are employed to express a certain feeling are aku (240): lovingness and pity (examples are missing);
anih ‘surprise’, see the example anih, into-ny-am a-ki-aõ ‘oh, what will befall me?’ a-bove. It can also be used to express ‘malicious pleasure’:

(7) anih,

empek (2933)

INTJ:malicious.pleasure good/right

‘Serves you right!’

anyiw: anticipation, when occurring clause-initially (see the examples above). It can then also be used to express ‘I wish’, ‘I desire’:

(8) a-amo-khe anyiw (2777) 1sS-eat-IMP I.wish ‘Oh, I wish to eat!’

(9) a-lya-khe anyiw (2778) 1sS-go-IMP I.wish ‘Oh, I wish to go!’

(10) tanta a-l-o-khe

anyiw-na

a-ki-aõ (2944)

bread 1sA-3sO-eat-IMP INTJ:desire-QUOT 1sA-say-IA

‘I want to eat bread!’ (lit.: ‘I say: “Yummy!. Let me eat bread!”).

aõ (2951): amazement (examples are missing);

atih: distress:

(11) inam

palyow mi-kot-o-ke, atih (354)

hopefully good 2sS-be-FN2-AN INTJ:distress

‘I whished you would have been good. [Ah!]’

i…a(ka)y (2937): disdain (examples are missing);

i…iey (2956) fear (examples are missing). (It may have been pronounced as [i…iyey];

i…i: horror:

(12) anyiw,

ina-ham mek ki-kol-t-aõ, i…i (1555)

INTJ:anticipation thus-CE all 1pS-die-F-IA INTJ:horror

‘[Oh!] What if we all have to die? [Ugh!]

297

(The form išiw ‘villain’, considered as an interjection by de la Mata, may be related to i…i):

(13) peh-…u-ah,

išiw (2950)

distance-DIM-EX villain

‘Go away, villain!’

The noun išiwah ‘badness’ is obviously related to išiw).

onew: anger (examples are missing). The form onew can also mean ‘harm’ and function as a noun:

(14) onew-ah õ-a-ø-aõ (2948) wrong-EX 3sA-1sO-do-IA ‘He harms me!’
unyuu (2945): admiration (examples are missing).

3: interjections motivated by or reacting to the situation. These interjections occur clause-initially, except for …oti ‘I bet!’. Situational interjections include

a(h) ‘O!’ ‘Hey!’: to hail someone; ‘Boo!’: to give someone a fright. This interjection can also occur as a suffix and be used as an exclamation marker (see also the word peh-…u-ah išiw ‘Go away, villain!’ above, and see section 10.2.1):

(15) ah, Dios (2930) O! God ‘O God!’

(16) ah, ø-nyip-iy-mu-ah (2941) boo! 3sO-touch-PST-NE-EX ‘Boo, do not touch it!’

aha ‘Aha!’, used when catching someone red-handed:

(17) aha, ampašleõ (2932) aha! scoundrel ‘Aha, scoundrel

…oti ‘I bet!’:
(18) ašwa mi-po-lamih-te-he mi-lya-pe-kt-aõ, …oti (2820) fish 2sA-3pO-kill-INF-BEN 2sS-go-NE-F-IA I bet! ‘You will not go out fishing, I bet!’

eey, heey, hey ‘yes!’:

298

(19) eey õol-t-an-na

a-haki-aõ (1596)

yes 3sS.die-F-IA-QUOT 1sS-think-IA

‘I think: “Yes, he will die’.

(20) ka… ø-m-a-pakt-aõ-le. heey, ø-a-pakt-aõ (276) maize 3sS-2sO-AP-be-IA-QM. Yes, 3sS-1sO.AP-be-IA ‘Do you have maize? Yes, I have’.

(21) hey, amehe (2861) yes, thruth ‘Yes, [it is] the truth’.

hay, haya (2188) ‘I do not know!’ (examples are missing);

ma ‘no!’:
(22) ma-na a-l-ø-aõ (1578) no-QUOT 1sA-3sO-do-IA ‘I say ‘no’ to him’.

oy (2939) ‘O.K.!’ (examples are missing).

De la Mata also distinguishes four ‘defective verbs’ of which apparently only one form is left. These four forms are used in a certain situation as an exclamation or exhortation, and we may consider them as situational interjections:

1: …im ‘please!’:

(23) …im mi-tanta (2184)

(24) …im mi-toõ-i (2189)

please! 2sPOS-bread

please! 2sS-sit.down-IMP

‘Please, give me (your) bread!’

‘Please, sit down!’

‘Please, take a seat!’

(25) …im mi-amo-ki (2190) please! 2sS-eat-IMP ‘Please, eat a little bit!’.

2: nyamo ‘come!’:

(26) nyamo ki-lya-kte(-ah) (2191) come 1pS-go-IMP(-EX) ‘Come, let us go!’.

299
3: akinah(-a) (2192) ‘wait!’ (examples are missing); 4: ahwiya-in (2193) ‘hang on!’ (examples are missing).

10. Discourse markers This chapter deals with affixes operating at the discourse or sentence level; they include co-ordination, direct or indirect speech, doubt, emphatic speech, exclamation, focus, manner, questions (conditional, disjunctive and wh-questions), reported speech, indica-tion of time, and topic. The discourse markers treated in this chapter are the speech markers -(a)…, -he, -na, the exclamation markers -a(h), -ham, -na, -nah, -nay, the question markers -(a)m, -le, -nam, -wam, the vocative markers -ey and -pey, emphasis marker -sim, and topic marker -wa; the sentential suffixes are the abverbial markers -ate, -…in, -…o, -…ot, -hin, -in, -mok, and co-ordinator -pit. They occur constituent-finally. A few of them may also be combined: exclamation marker -a(h) can be suffixed to question marker -(a)m and dubitative marker -hin, question marker -(a)m and dubitative marker -…in can be suffixed to temporal marker -…o, and topic marker -(w)a can be attached to emphasis marker -sim.

10.1. Speech markers According to the data, Cholón has three affixes that specify the type of speech: -(a)…, -he and -na. The speech marker -(a)… indicates reported speech, -he an indirect discourse, and -na a direct discourse.

10.1.1. Reportative -(a)… The ending -(a)… is a reported speech marker, which can be translated as ‘it is said that’, ‘they say that’. It occurs mainly after nominal stems. The form -… is found after vowels and -a… after consonants. The speech marker -(a)… is often followed by
-he (see paragraph 10.1.2) without a significant difference in meaning. The simple form -(a)… has been found:
(i) after personal pronouns:

(1) ok-a… (1317) 1s-REP ‘it is said that I’

(2) sa-… (1319) 3s-REP ‘it is said that he’

(3) ki-ha-… (1320) 1p-PL-REP ‘it is said that we’

(ii) after a noun + agentive marker -tu-p in the following example:

(4) fiscal-tu-p-a…

i-k-šayš-t-aõ-na,

Estevan

public.prosecutor-AD-ABL-REP 3sA-1pO-whip-F-IA-QUOT Estevan

ø-ki-aõ (1323)

3sS-say-IA

‘Estevan says that the public prosecutor will whip us’.

The combined form -(a)…-he has been found:

302

(i) after personal pronouns:

(5) ok-a…-he (1331) 1p-REP-IS ‘it is said that I’

(6) mi-…-he (1342) 2s-REP-IS ‘it is said that you’

(7) sa-…-he (1343) 3s-REP-IS ‘it is said that he’

(ii) after noun phrases containing a personal pronoun or a demonstrative:

‘The Marías came, saying that they too have seen angels which say that

that these are saying that Jesus is alive’).

(9) iõko-ny-a…-he (1325) that-CMP-REP-IS ‘it is said that [it is] like that’

(10) pe-ny-a…-he (1325) yonder-CMP-REP-IS ‘it is said that [it is] like that’

(iii) after adverbs:

(11) kun…u-aly-…o-…-he (1589)

(12) ni-…u-aly-…o-…-he (1589)

small-RST-already-REP-IS

303

(15) angel-pit mo-šl-ey-na-…-he,

‘and the angel said to them that they should not be afraid’

(lit. ‘And it is said that the angel spoke to them giving them the message

that they should not be afraid’).

10.1.2. Indirect speech marker -he The indirect discourse marker -he can be translated as ‘that’. It does not occur with nominal stems. It is only found after finite verb forms, and it can then also be followed by the quotative marker -na (cf.10.1.3):

(16) lu-pokot-ø

ø-ki-aõ (1323)

3sS-say-IA

‘Estevan says that the public prosecutor will whip us’.

10.1.3. Quotative -na
In most cases, the suffix -na indicates a direct citation. It regularly functions as such
when the word to which it is attached is followed by a verb of communication, e.g., ki ‘(to) do/tell’ and kale/kaly ‘(to) order’34:

35 Other elements with the shape -na are found after interrogative stems (10.3.3.) and in the pronoun mi-na-ha ‘2p’ (6.4).

i-õaly-aõ (1579)

door keeper 3sS-keep.watch-IMP-IS-QUOT 3sA-3sO.order-IA

‘He orders the gatekeeper to keep watch’.

For an example in which -na may refer to indirect speech rather than to direct speech see the following sentence:

(25) Maria-lol …i-n-iy,

…i-ha-sim-aly-a…-he angel

María-PL 3pS-come-PST 3p-PL-EMP-RST-REP-IS angel

…i-po-y…-iy-na

ki-khe (1586)

3pA-3pO-see-PST-QUOT say-SIM

‘The Marías - they were the ones, according to what is said - came, saying

that they had seen angels’.

In the examples above, the direct speech marker -na is suffixed to a verb form. It can also be suffixed to a word of another class, viz. a noun or an interjection:

(26) Dios-te amehe-na

a-ki-aõ (178)

God-AD truth/belief-QUOT 1sS-say-IA

‘I believe in God’. (lit.: ‘I say: “The truth [is] in God”’).

(27) ma-na a-l-ø-aõ (1576) not-QUOT 1sA-3sO-do/say-IA ‘I say ‘no’ to him’.

305
(28) alew-na mi-ki-aõ-le (2954) cold-QUOT 2sS-say-IA-QM ‘Are you cold?’. (lit.: ‘Do you say: “Brrrr”?’).
As stated, -na can be preceded by the endings -(a)…-he and -he, and it can also be follow-ed by -(a)…-he (for examples, see section 10.1.1 and 10.1.2).

10.2. Exclamation markers Cholón disposes of the following exclamation markers: -a(h), -ham, -nah, -nay. The suffix -(a)h is used to mark an exclamation in general; -ham, -nah and -nay have a specific use.

10.2.1. Exclamation marker -a(h) The exclamation marker -a(h) can be attached to noun phrases, verb forms, and adverbs: It appears that the two variants -a and -ah are interchangeable:

(29) in…a-m-ah (2719) thing-QM-EX ‘What [is the matter]!’
(31) ah ø-nyip-iy-mu-a (2941) INTJ 3sO-touch-SE-NE-EX ‘Oh, do not touch it!’

(30) ay-te-ah (2195) back-AD-EX ‘Quiet!’
(32) onew-ah a-l-ø-aõ (2947) harm-EX 1sA-3sO-do-IA ‘I molest him!’

10.2.2. Exclamation marker -ham The exclamation marker -ham indicates a hypothetical situation and can be translated as ‘what if’:

(33) ko-ham (2630) this.one-CE ‘What if [it is] this one!’

(34) õol-t-aõ-ham (2631) 3sS.die-F-IA-CE ‘What if he should die!’

(35) õol-o-ke-ham (2632) 3sS.die-FN2-ANT-CE ‘What if he had died!’

(36) anyiw

ina-ham a-šayš-la-kt-aõ, alaw (1558)

INTJ:anticipation thus-CE 1sO-whip-3pA-F-IA INTJ:pain

‘Oh, what if they are going to whip me? ouch!’

306

The exclamation marker -ham can be followed by the co-ordinating affix -pit ‘and’, ‘also’ (see section 12.3). In this combination, -ham loses its conditional meaning. The suffix combination -ham-pit is translated as ‘look (there)!’, ‘there!’:

(37) amehe-na mi-ki-pe-…-a

mi-tsaš-t-aõ-ham-pit (2774)

truth-QUOT 2sS-do-NE-FAC-TOP 2sA-3sO.see-F-IA-CE-COR

‘If you do not believe it, look, you will see it!’.

(38) ok-ham-pit (2775) 1s-CE-COR ‘There I am!’

10.2.3. Exclamation markers -nah and -nay The suffix -nah is used to attract someone’s attention. It has been found in the following expression:

(39) a-ya…-o-nah (2465) 1sO-see-FN2-EX ‘Look at me!’

The particle -nay is used to answer a negative question in the affirmative. Like -nah, it has been found in one expression only: into-nay ‘why not? of course’:

(40) awka mi-po-tsap-te-he,

seke mi-lya-pe-kt-aõ …oti.

enemy 2sA-3pO-catch-INF-BEN again 2sS-go-NE-F-IA I.bet into-nay, a-lya-kt-aõ (2822)

which-EX 1sS-go-F-IA

‘I bet you are not going again to catch enemies? ‘Why, of course, I shall go!’

10.3. Question markers The question markers in Cholón are as follows: -(a)m, -wam; -le; -na.

10.3.1. Question marker -(a)m, -wam A common form to mark a question is -(a)m. It appears after interrogative stems or noun phrases containing an interrogative stem (wh-questions). The form -m is only found after vowels; -am is the only one allowed after a consonant:

(41) in…a-m (1347) what-QM ‘What?’

(42) ol-(lol)-am (1339, 1360) who-(PL)-QM ‘Who (p)?’

307

(43) Pukala-te-wa in…a yu pey-am ø-pakt-aõ (1398) Pucara-AD-TOP what kind earth-QM 3sS-be.there-IA ‘As for Pucara, what kind of earth is there?’

(44) ana-tsel

‘How many trees?’

(45) into-ny-…o-m

ø-pakt-aõ (2541)

which-CMP-already-QM 3sS-be.there-IA

‘What time is it?’

The form -wam has been found in one example after the vowel u and is apparently a phonetic variant of -(a)m after a back vowel:
(46) in…a yu-wam (<ynchayuvam>) (2844) what kind-QM ‘What?’
cf. in…a yu caballu-m iõko-wa (1396) what kind horse-QM that-TOP ‘What kind of horse [is] it?’
Note also the examples in…a yu-am and in…a yu hayu-am below, which may represent the same element, although it does not contain <v>:
(47) in…a yu-am i-m-o-w (2727) what kind-QM 3sA-2sO-do-PST ‘What did he do to you?’
(48) in…a yu hayu-am iõko-a (1388) thing kind man-QM that-TOP ‘What kind of man [is] he?’

10.3.2. Question marker -le The question marker -le occurs after constituents that contain the focus of a question; this is usually the main verb or a noun phrase. Its presence indicates that the speaker asks for an affirmative or a negative answer:
(49) mu-n-utsa konfessan mi-ki-aõ-le (2862) 2sPOS-REL-sin confession 2sA-do-IA-QM ‘Do you confess your sins?’

308

(50) ku…i-le me-kt-aõ, el mi-l-a-õo-wa (2983) pig-QM 2sS-be-IA yucca 2sA-3sO-eat-FN2-TOP ‘Are you a pig that you eat yucca?’

mi-tpa…-iy-le (2888)

2sPOS-bed-AD-ABL-TOP morning-ANT-RST 2sS-get.up-PST-QM

‘Did you get up early from your bed?’

The suffix -le can also function as a disjunctive question marker ‘or?’. It then occurs on each of the alternatives that are presented:

(52) …e…-le, tsal-le (1389) white-QM black-QM ‘Is it white or black?’

(53) mi-le, ok-le ki-lya-kt-aõ (2502) 2s-QM 1s-QM 1pS-go-F-IA ‘You or me? [Which of us] will go?’

(54) katsan-pat mi-…ase-õ-le, amehe-ke-le mi-hl-aõ (2969) words-INS 2sA-play-IA-QM truth-ANT-QM 2sA-speak-IA ‘Are you joking, or do you say the truth?’

10.3.3. Question marker -na The question marker -na is mainly used in combination with the interrogative stem in…a ‘what’:

(55) in…a-na sil-a

ø-pakt-aõ (2724)

thing-QM 3sP.word-TOP 3sS-be.there-IA

‘What [kind of] news is there?’

what-QM 2sPOS-REL-fault-NF-INS-QM 1sO-whip-3pA-FN2

‘What, because of your fault they are going to whip me?’

Question marker -na can then be followed by the question marker -(a)m:

(57) in…a-na-m mi-mot-nik

me-kt-aõ (273)

what-QM-QM 2sPOS-name-COM 2sS-be-IA

‘What is your name?’

mi-meny-aõ (2730)

what kind-QM-QM 1sA-2sO-say-INF 2sA-3sO.want-IA

‘What do you want me to say?’

The question marker combination -na-m has also been found after the form ana-pi, consisting of the interrogative stem ana ‘when’ and the allative case marker -pi (cf. section 6.4.2.10 and 6.7.1):

(60) ana-pi-na-m (2876) when-AL-QM-QM ‘For when?’
(61) ana-pi-na-m mi-hlyem mi-sia-õ (2877) when-AL-QM-QM 2sPOS-friend 2sA-3sO.expect-IA ‘When do you expect your friend?’

10.4. Vocative markers -ey and -pey; -ma and -pa Vocative -ey, -pey is only found after personal names and nouns indicating a human being. The form -ey is used to hail male persons, -pey for female persons:

(62) Juan-ey (197) (63) Malia-pey (196) (64) hayu-ey (195) (65) ila-pey (194)

‘Hey Juan!’ ‘Hey María!’ ‘Hey man!’ ‘Hey woman!’

Alternative vocative endings are -ma (male) and -pa (female). They have only been found after the question word in…a-m ‘what?’:

(66) in…a-m-ma (1352) ‘Hey man, what is the matter?’ (67) in…a-m-pa (1353) ‘Hey woman, what is the matter?’

10.5. Emphasis marker -sim The emphasis marker sim is found after noun phrases and verb phrases. A noun followed by -sim can be used predicatively. Examples:
(68) lolše-sim (1389) Spanish-EMP ‘It/he/she/they is/are Spanish/Spaniards’.

‘He advises you so that you will be good, not that you should be abhorred’.

When the emphasis marker -sim is followed by the topic marker -(w)a, the deictic character of the former is accentuated by the latter. De la Mata translates the form sim-a as Veis! ‘Look!’:

(71) ko-sim-a (779) here-EMP-TOP ‘Look here!’

10.6. Topic marker -(w)a According to Pedro de la Mata, -(w)a is a nominative ending indicating the agent or subject of the clause. However, the suffix -(w)a appears to function as a topic marker. In the example below, for instance, the suffix -(w)a indicates a topic:

(72) mek-tu-p Dios-a ki-õole-õo

ø-kot-aõ (1567)

all-AD-ABL God-TOP 1pA-3sO.love-FN2 3sS-be-IA

‘We all have to love God’.

Topic marker -(w)a is not only used after nouns, it is also used after pronouns, demonstratives and the discourse marker -sim ‘emphasis’ (see 10.5):

(73) mi-man-ap ok ašmaõ a-mso-w

10.7. Adverbial markers -ate, -…in, -…o, -…ot, -hin, -in, -mok The sentential suffixes -ate, -…in, -…o, -…ot, -hin, -in and -mok have adverbial functions. Their use is as follows:

1: -ate ‘then’. This suffix is attached to a past tense form in -(i)y or -ey in order to form a pluperfect (cf. -(k)e ‘anteriority’, section 7.4.3):

(87) pe-kt-iy-ate (303) 2sfS-be-PST-then ‘you (f) were then’ ‘you had been’

(88) a-õoly-ey-ate (697) 1sA-3sO.love-PST-then ‘I then loved him/her/it’ ‘I had loved him/her/it’

2: -…in ‘maybe’ (cf. -…in ‘negator’, section 11.2) functions as a dubitative marker, (i) when it occurs in combination with a question word:

(89) in…a(-pit)-…in (2731) thing(-IND)-DUB ‘I do not know what it is’. ‘I do not know what you say’.

The suffix -ate has only been found after the past tense markers -(i)y and -ey; -…in has been found after nouns and verbs forms in -i(y)-…o; -…o has been encountered after nouns, verbs and after the adverb payam ‘almost’; -…ot has only been encountered after nominal stems; -in has been found after nouns, verbs and after the adverb ma ‘no’; and -mok occurs after nouns as well as after verbs. When -…o occurs after a nominal stem, it can be preceded by a case marker and by the suffix -(w)a

316
‘topic marker’; when -in occurs after nominal stems, it can also be preceded by a case marker. The sentential suffixes -…in ‘not’, -mu ‘do not’ and -nik ‘not’, which indicate a negation are treated in chapter 11.

10.8. Co-ordinator -pit The suffix -pit, meaning ‘and’, ‘also’, ‘or’, is used to co-ordinate constituents and clauses. (In section 6.4.4.5 we have seen that -pit can also function as an indefinite marker ‘wh ... ever’36). Co-ordinator -pit can also have a concessive interpretation and mean ‘although’. When -pit co-ordinates constituents it can occur after nouns, pronouns, nomininalized verb forms and noun phrases , and it can be attached to the last co-ordinated constituent, or to all of the co-ordinated constituents:

11. Negation This chapter contains an overview of the different devices used to indicate negation. Cholón has one adverb of negation: ma ‘not’ (see chapter 8). (In chapter 9 we have seen that ma can also be used as an interjection). However, the use of this adverb is restricted. In addition, the language disposes of the following negators: -…in, -mu, -na-pit, -nik, -p(e)-. The suffixes -…in, -mu and -nik can be used to form a negative imperative or prohibitive; the suffix combination -na-pit is only found in a few expressions; and -p(e)- is normally used to form a derived, negative verb.

11.1. Negator ma The adverb ma ‘not’ negates the verb pak(o)t ‘(to) be (there), and it is only found with a third person singular subject form of the present tense in -(a)õ ‘imperfective aspect’. The adverb is placed before this form:

(1) a-tsip-te

mol-maõ ma ø-pakt-aõ (2399)

1sPOS-house-AD ground-INES not 3sS-be-IA

‘He is not in the environment of my house’.

(4) ku-lu-wo-lam

‘We do not have to be sad’.

(5) ma ø-a-pakt-aõ (277) not 3sS-1sO.APL-be.there-IA ‘I have not’

The adverb ma furthermore occurs in the following expressions. The vowel
collision in these examples give evidence that ma was probably pronounced with a glottal stop as [ma§]:

(6) ma-in (2501)

[ma§in]

(7) ma-in-le (2501)

(8) ma-aly (2672)

[ma§aly]

‘not yet’ ‘not yet? ‘no more’

320
(9) ma-aly-…o (2673)

‘there is nothing left’

11.2. Negator -…in The suffix -…in ‘not’ is regularly suffixed to a non-reduced stem. It indicates a negative optative or exhortative:

(10) tsi-tu-p

õ-a-loh-…in-na

ki-khe, a-tsip-te

rain-AD-ABL 3sA-1sO-wet-NE-QUOT say-SIM 1sPOS-house-AD

1sS-stay-IA

‘I stay at home, so that the rain does not wet me’.

(lit. ‘Saying: “The rain does not wet me”, I stay at home’).

(11) ko kama-pat ki-kol-…in-he-wa in…a yu-wam ki-l-o-kt-aõ (2844) this illness-INS 1sS-die-NE-SIM-TOP what kind-QM 1pA-3sO-do-F-IA ‘What shall we do in order not to die of this infection?’

ki-l-o-kt-aõ (2845)

1pA-3sO-do-F-IA

‘What shall we do, so that this illness does not catch us?’

The suffix -…in can also negate an imperative. If the stem ends in a vowel the imperative marker -k can be added:

(13) henap išiwah mi-kot-ø-…in (339) beware bad 2sS-be-IMP-NE ‘Beware, do not be bad!’

(14) hapit mi-õole-ø-…in (730) beware 2sA-3sO.love-IMP-NE ‘Beware, do not love him/her/it’.

hapit i-õole-k-…in (731) beware 3sA-3sO.love-IMP-NE ‘Beware, let he/she/it not love him/her/it!’

(15) mi-lya-ø-…in (2506) 2sS-go-IMP-NE ‘Do not go!’

lya-k-…in-na i-õaly-aõ (1593) go-IMP-NE-QUOT 3sA-3sO.order-IA ‘He orders him not to go!’

321

11.3. Negator -mu The suffix -mu is always preceded by an extended stem in -(i)y/-w. Forms in -mu have no personal reference. They can be followed by a main verb. In this case, the subject of the form in -mu is the same as that of the main verb. A possible translation is ‘without ... ing’:

When the verb to which -mu is suffixed is a main verb, -mu functions as a prohibitive marker ‘do not’. The subject of the form in -mu is then a second person singular or plural:

(19) kot-iy-mu (481) be-SE-NE ‘Do not be!’

(20) l-o-w-mu (2504) 3sO-do-SE-NE Do not do it!’

‘and the angel spoke to them: “Do not be afraid!”.

11.4. Negator -naNegator -na- has been found in five nominal expressions in combination with the co-ordinator -pit; and in one nominalized verb form in combination with the case marker -pat ‘because’. In one nominal expression -pit is preceded by the benefactive case marker -he. The suffix combination -na(-he)-pit means ‘not even’ (three examples):

(22) kun…u-na-pit (2612) small-NE-COR ‘not even a little bit

(23) an-tsel-na-pit (2613) one-CL:truncal-NE-COR ‘not even one’

322

(24) na-he-pit (2838)
NEG-BEN-COR
‘not even’

In two examples the suffix combination -na-pit means ‘neither’, ‘nor’, and is used to co-ordinate two correlated, negative alternatives:

(25) maha-ly-na-pit, kun…u-na-pit (2674) INT-RST-NE-COR small-NE-COR ‘neither much, nor a little’

(26) kun…u-na-pit, maha-ly-na-pit (2675) small-NE-COR INT-RST-NE-COR ‘neither a little, nor much’

In the nominalized verb form -na- is followed by instrumental -pat ‘because’ (see section 7.4.8.1):

(27) Dios kamatsiõ ø-ki-y

sil

God order 3sS-do-PST 3sPOS.word

1sA-3sO.break-IA-NOM-NE-INS 3s grace-RST 1sA-3sO.be-CA-IA

‘Since I do not break the law of God, I maintain his grace’.

11.5. Negator -nik Negator -nik ‘not’ only occurs with transitive verbs. It is suffixed to the imperative marker -k, and is used to form a second person subject prohibitive:

(28) mi-õole-k-nik (729) 2sA-3sO.love-IMP-NE ‘Do not love him!’

(29) mi-l-o-k-nik (2160) 2sA-3sO-do-IMP-NE ‘Do not do it!’

11.6. The use of -…in, -mu, -nik A negative imperative or prohibitive can be formed by means of the suffixes -…in, -mu and -nik as we have seen in section 11.2, 11. 3 and 11.5, respectively. They differ from each other in that (i) -…in and -mu are used with both transitive and intransitive verbs, whereas -nik has only been found with transitive verbs; (ii) -…in and -nik are suffixed to imperative forms, whereas -mu is suffixed to the extended verb stem in -(i)y/-w; (iii) -…in occurs with a second or third person imperative and is optionally preceded by the imperative marker -k when used after a vocalic stem; the forms in -mu are not

323

marked for person; -nik occurs with second person singular imperative, is used with vocalic stems and is always preceded by the imperative marker -k; (iv) forms in -…in can indicate a second or third person singular prohibitive, forms in -mu a second person singular or plural prohibitive, and those in -nik a second person singular prohibitive.
The difference in meaning and use between the suffixes -…in, -mu and -nik is shown in the following table. In this table the abbreviations tr. and intr. stand for ‘transitive’ and ‘intransitive’, respectively.

11.7. Negator -p(e)Negator -p(e)- is a derivational suffix used to form a negative verb. Negative verbs formed by means of this suffix may show some special characteristics. Present tense in -(a)õ ‘incompletive aspect’, future in -(k)t-aõ, nominalizations in -(e)…, -(k)te and -lam, and subordination in -(k)he and -(n)ap are formed regularly. In these forms, -p(e)- is attached to a non-reduced stem and followed by the ending at issue:

(30) a-l-o-p-aõ (2160) (31) a-l-o-pe-kt-aõ (32) a-l-o-pe-… (33) a-l-o-pe-kte (34) a-l-o-pe-lam (35) a-l-o-pe-khe (36) a-l-o-pe-nap

‘I do not do/make it’ ‘I shall not do it’ ‘that I do not do it’ ‘that I do not do it’ ‘that I do not have to do it’ ‘as I do not do it’ ‘(after) (1s) not having done it’

In one example sentence, -p(e)- was found before the past tense marker -(i)y:

(37) iõko-te ø-toõ-pe-y-ate (2386) there-AD 3sS-be-NE-PST-then ‘He had not been there’.

Normally, the past tense is formed in a special way, namely, by means of the preterite form of the verb (with the past tense marker -(i)y/-w) + the ending -pits-o.

324

The latter may be analyzed as a negative stem consisting of -p(e)- ‘negation’, -its ‘passivizer’ and the nominalizing ending -(õ)o. Like -(õ)o, -pits-o can be followed
by the nominal past marker -(k)e, and by the suffix combination -tu-p-pit (-tu-p-pit is only used in combination with -(õ)o, see section 7.4.8.4). The forms in -pits-o-ke
indicate an unreal (hypothetical) situation; those in -tu-p-pit a concession:

(38) õol-iy-pits-o (125) 3sS.die-PST-NE-FN2 ‘he did not die’

(39) a-sina-y-pits-o (218) 1sA-3sO.hear-PST-NE-FN2 ‘I did not hear’

(40) alkalde a-kt-iy-pits-o-ke-wa,

mi-lyemtsap-la-pakna-ke (558)

mayor 1sS-be-PST-NE-FN2-ANT-TOP 2sO-help-3pA-NE.NOM-ANT

‘If I had not been mayor, they would not have helped you’.

(41) ok-nik mi-lya-kte-he mi-menyo-w-pits-o-tu-p-pit,

a-lyw-aõ (2841)

1p-TOP 2sPOS-company 1sS-go-IA

‘Although you did not want to go with me, I go with you’.

In one example negator -pits-o is used with a non-past meaning, the ending -w to which it is suffixed only functions as a stem extension marker:

(42) a-tsmo-w-pits-o

a-kt-aõ (2655)

1sA-3sO.know-SE-NE-FN2 1sS-be-IA

‘I do not know it’.

cf. a-kt-iy-pits-o

a-kt-aõ (466)

1sA-be-PST-NE-FN2 1sS-be-IA

‘I had not been’

The suffix -pits-o can be attached to a subordinated form in -(k)he ‘simultaneity’ to indicate negative subordination:

(43) kot-he-pits-o (469) be-SIM-NE-FN2 ‘as he is not’

(44) palyow me-kt-e…

i-m-pasa-õ-sim,

2sS-interior-burn-SIM-NE-FN2

‘He advises you, so that you will be good, not to abhor you’.

325

Negative verbs formed by means of the derivational suffix -(p)e do not have a negative imperative or prohibitive. A prohibitive is expressed by means of the suffixes -…in, -mu, -nik (see section 11.2, 11.3 and 11.5, respectively).
In addition, the negative derivational suffix -p(e)- is not used before the nominalizer -(õ)o. A form such as *pe-õo has not been encountered (-pits-o, see above, and -pakna, see below, are used instead). According to de la Mata, negative verbs have a ‘second supine’, viz. a nominalized form in -pakna. (This ending may be a combination of -p(e)-, an undentified element -ak- and a nominalizing element -na). The ending -pakna is regularly suffixed to a non-reduced stem. It expresses mainly ‘impossibility’ and is usually followed by the verb k(o)t ‘(to) be’:

(45) mi-kot-pakna me-kt-aõ (487) 2sS-be-NE.NOM 2sS-be-IA ‘you cannot be’

(46) ki-ø-…em-pakna

ø-kot-aõ (2809)

1pA-3sO-exile-NE.NOM 3sS-be-IA

‘He cannot be exiled’.

(47) pe mek …e-kt-iy ø-kot-nap, into-ny, ki-po-wo-pakna that all 3pS-be-PST 3sS-be-SEQ which-CMP 1pA-3pO-do-NE.NOM …e-kt-aõ (60) 3pS-be-IA ‘Since they were that many, they could not be counted’.

Sometimes a form in -pakna expresses ‘inadmissibility’:

(48) mi-ø-lyawoh-pakna me-kt-aõ mi-yelam-a (1574) 2sA-3sO-carry-NE.NOM 2sS-be-IA 2sPOS-bed-TOP ‘You may not carry your bed’.

(49) quaresma alum nem-te-wa, [...], ay…a ø-lyup-la-pakna

Lent

other day-AD-TOP [...] meat 3sO-eat-3pA-NE.NOM

ø-kot-aõ (2793)

3sS-be-IA

‘But on the other days of Lent, they should not eat meat’.

Occasionally, the modality of ‘unworthyness’ is expressed by means of -pakna:

(50) ke-ø-lusay-pakna ø-kot-aõ (2806) 1pA-3sO-pity-NE.NOM 3sS-be-IA ‘He does not deserve it that we pity him’.

326

In one example the form in -pakna is not followed by k(o)t ‘(to) be’, but by a verb with a similar meaning:

(51) into mek Pasco ø-kot-o-ke,

into-õko-pit misa

which all Easter 3sS-be-FN2-ANT which-DEM-IND Mass

i-sinah-pakna

ø-ayki-õo-le (2860)

3sA-3sO.attend-NE.NOM 3sS-be.there-FN2-QM

‘[Easter] being such a big feast, could there be anyone not attending Mass?’

Like -pits-o, -pakna can also be followed by the nominal past marker -(k)e, indicating an impossibility, and by the suffix combination -tu-p-pit, indicating a negative concession:

(52) iõko-te ø-toõ-pakna-ke/

ø-toõ-pits-o-ke,

there-AD 3sS-be-NE.NOM-ANT/ 3sS-be-PST-FN2-ANT

i-tspe-kte-he

ø-lyaw-iy (2388)

3sA-3sO.see-INF-BEN 3sS-go-PST

‘He could not be there/ he was not there, [and] he went to see him’.

(lit. ‘Although he was not there, he went to see him’).

(53) mi-l-o-pakna-tu-p-pit (2686) 2sA-3sO-do-NE.NOM-AD-ABL-COR ‘although you do not do it’

Forms in -pakna occur in subject clauses when the subject of k(o)t ‘(to) be’ (or ayki ‘there is’) is a third person singular referring to a third person singular object of the form in -pakna; and in nominal parts of the predicate when the subjects of the forms in -pakna and that of k(o)t are the same (cf. -(õ)o, section 7.4.7.4). In the former case, the clause is in the passive voice; in the latter case, it is in the active voice. (A construction consisting of a main verb + k(o)t ‘(to) be’ is passive, when the object of the main verb is subject of the copula, see section 7.3.4.6. The suffix -pakna itself is neutral with regard to voice):

(54) into-ny ki-l-o-pakna

ø-kot-aõ (390)

which-CMP 1pA-3sO-do-NE.NOM 3sS-be-IA

‘There is no remedy [for that]’. (< ‘It cannot be done by us’).

(55) a-kot-pakna a-kt-aõ (486) 1sS-be-NE.NOM 1sS-be-IA ‘I cannot be’

In three examples a form in -pakna functions as a main predicate (that is, occurring without the verb k(o)t ‘(to) be’). In these cases, a verb ‘(to) be’ is understood:

327

(56) into-ny ki-amo-pakna (1616) which-CMP 1pS-eat-NE.NOM ‘It is impossible to eat’.

(57) mi-…em-its-iy

mi-kot-t-an-na-wa ku-layam-pakna (2904)

2sS-exile-PAS-PST 2sS-be-F-IA-QUOT-TOP 1pS-doubt-NE.NOM

‘There can be no doubt that you will be exiled’.

(58) into-õko hayu-pit misa i-sinah-pakna-le (2860) which-DEM man-IND Mass 3sA-3sO.attend-NE.NOM-QM ‘Is there anyone not attending Mass?’
The suffixes -pits-o and -pakna are similar in that both can be followed by the suffixes -(k)e and -tu-p-pit. In spite of this similarity, they do differ from each other. As stated, (i), the former is usually suffixed to an extended stem and used mostly to form a past tense; whereas the latter is attached to a non-reduced stem, functions as a nominalizer and cannot be preceded neither by a stem extender, nor by any other suffix; (ii), forms in -pits-o are rarely followed by the verb k(o)t ‘(to) be’, those in -pakna are regularly followed by this copula; (iii), forms in -pits-o mainly function as main predicates. They only occur in a subordinate clause when -pits-o is preceded by the subordinator -(k)he (cf. the example mu-lu-poh-he-pits-o ‘not because you are abhorred’ above), or followed by the suffix sequence -ke-wa (see the example alcalde a-kt-iy-pits-o-ke-wa ‘if I had not been mayor’ above). Forms in -pakna, on the other hand, usually do not function as main predicates. In only three examples a form in -pakna is not followed by k(o)t ‘(to) be’ and is used as a main predicate (see the examples above).
The ending -pakna is parallel in use to -(õ)o and can be considered as its negative counterpart. Both suffixes are nominalizers which can be followed by the nominal past marker -(k)e and by the suffix combination -tu-p-pit. In addition, (i), forms in -pakna, like those in -(õ)o, often occur in combination with the copula k(o)t ‘(to) be’; and they can then indicate a subject clause or a nominal predicate; (ii), both forms in -(õ)o and in -pakna can occasionally function as main predicates; (iii), like -(õ)o, -pakna can express different modalities (see above), in positive (-(õ)o) and in negative (-pakna) interpretations:

-(õ)o obligation possibility worthyness

-pakna inadmissibility impossibilty unworthyness

However, there are also a few differences in the use of -(õ)o and -pakna:

328
(i), forms in -(õ)o can occur in an attributive extension of the subject and in object clauses (see section 7.4.7.7); (ii), -(õ)o is mainly used to express the modality of ‘obligation’, whereas -pakna is more often used to express ‘impossibilty’; (iii), unlike forms in -(õ)o, which can be used attributively as adjectives or independently as nouns, those in -pakna are only found as nominal complements of k(o)t ‘(to) be’ (unless the copula is left out).

12. Complex sentences In this chapter we return to the processes of co-ordination, correlation, subordination, and to nominal predicate + copula constructions. We have already talked about -pit as a co-ordinator of constituents in section 10.8, and about correlation marked by the suffix combination -na-pit in section11.4. Here we shall, amongst other things, pay attention to -pit as a co-ordinator of clauses (section 12.1), and to other correlators (section 12.2). Subordination has already been examined in chapter 7, where different types of clauses were analyzed, such as the attributive extension of a subject or object, avoidance clauses, causal clauses, object clauses, comparative clauses, concessive clauses, conditional clauses, contrastive clauses, locative clauses, purposive clauses, resultative clauses, subject clauses, and temporal clauses (see Table 7.8, 7.9 and 7.10). A survey of the clauses mentioned above is given in section 12.3, followed by an illustration of relative clauses (section 12.3.1) and a section about constructions containing a copula and a nominal predicate (section 12.4). A section about hypothetical clauses (section 12.5) closes the chapter.

12.1. Co-ordination Complements and clauses are coordinated by means of juxtaposition or by means of the co-ordinative suffix -pit ‘and’, ‘also’, ‘or’. Juxtaposition is discussed in section 12.1.1; in section 12.1.2, the use of -pit as a co-ordinator of clauses and as a concession marker is discussed (for other uses of -pit see section 10.5).

12.1.1. Juxtaposition As already stated, constituents and clauses can be coordinated by means of juxtaposition. The following sentence is an illustration of co-ordination of constituents by means of juxtaposition:

(1) Dios tsamo-…

‘God’s wisdom ordered the times, so that the sun shines at daytime [and]

the moon at night’.

An illustration of juxtaposition of clauses is given in the following sentences. In the
first sentence the clauses ‘Maria ... ki-khe’ and ‘ko-lol-a…he ... …i-ki-aõ’ are juxtaposed, in the second example the clauses ‘baptismo-te ... tsa…-he’ and ‘ki-nanima ... i-k-a-tsamoh-te-he’:

(lit. ‘Our God was not satisfied with the fact that mankind was reborn by

he ordered a vivifying medicine, to be made from the blood of our father

Jesus Christ [and] by submerging it, he would recognize all the blood of our

soul’).

12.1.2. Co-ordinator -pit In section 10.8 we have seen that -pit can be used to coordinate constituents. The suffix -pit, meaning ‘and’, ‘also’, ‘or’, can also coordinate clauses. When clauses are coordinated by means of -pit, it may occur in the first clause, the second clause, or in more consecutive clauses, and it can be suffixed to a verb form, a noun, or a pronoun:

In the following examples -pit means ‘also’:

(9) palyow mi-kot-hu, ok-pit palyow a-kot-t-aõ (399) good 2sS-be-SR 1s-COR good 1sS-be-F-IA ‘Since you are good, I shall also be good’.

‘At the same time that you came, Juan came also’.

When -pit is used to coordinate two clauses, it can also function as a disjunctive coordinator ‘or’, providing that it occurs in both clauses (cf. the use of -le as a disjunctive question marker ‘or?’, section 10.3.2):

Co-ordinator -pit can also be used to express ‘concession’ or ‘permission’, notably, when suffixed to an imperative or prohibitive:

(16) l-o-w-mu-pit (2678) 3sO-do-SE-NE-COR ‘Just do not do it!’

The following examples illustrate that -pit can also indicate ‘concession’ when suffixed to a subordinated form or a nominalized form, with the exception of a form in -(õ)o ‘future nominalizer 2'. (After nominalizer -(õ)o, the ending -tu-p(-ham)-pit is used in order to indicate ‘concession’, see section 7.4.5.4). Examples:
(17) išiwah ki-kot-hu-pit, palyow mi-kot-p-aõ (402) bad 1pS-be-SR-COR good 2sS-be-NE-IA ‘Even though we are bad, you are not good [either]’.

12.2. Correlation In section 7.4.8.2 we have seen that the suffix combination -te-p ‘as’, ‘like’ can correlate two clauses, and in section 11.4 that the suffix combination -na-pit is used to render the double negation ‘neither ... nor’. (The suffix sequence -na-pit is then

333

attached to both parts of the negation). In addition, correlative constructions can be
formed by means of the following elements: iõko mek ‘that much/many’; iõko-miny-aly ‘like that’, ‘so’, ‘likewise’; into mek(-aly) ‘as much/ many’, ‘that much/many (as)’; -(mi)ny ‘like’, ‘as’; and pe mek ‘that much/ many’. (For the discussion about the elements -(a)ly ‘restrictive’, ‘only’; into ‘which’; iõko ‘that one’; mek ‘all’; -(mi)ny ‘comparative’; and pe ‘that one yonder’, see section 6.4.5.1,
6.7.3, 6.6.1, 6.8.4, 6.4.2.4 and 6.6.1, respectively). According to our data, iõko-miny-aly correlates with -(mi)ny; iõko mek, into mek(-aly), and pe mek with into
mek:

The question word ana ‘how many’ can also be part of a correlation:

(24) ana-m

iõko-miny-aly l-o-k (419)

how.many-QM 2sS-say-IA-DEM-CMP that-CMP-RST 3sO-do-IMP

‘Do what you say!’ (lit.: ‘How much you say, do it likewise!’).

12.3. Subordination In the data presented by de la Mata we can distinguish several subordinate clauses, such as attributive extensions of the object, avoidance clauses, causal clauses, comparative clauses, concessive clauses, conditional clauses, consecutive clauses, direct object clauses, instrumental complement clauses, locative clauses, ‘not only ... but also’ clauses, purposive clauses, similarity clauses, subject clauses, and temporal clauses. The above-mentioned clauses (but for the conditional clauses, which are indicated by means of the topic marker -(w)a, see section 10.6), can be formed by means of a nominalized verb form, whether or not followed by case markers. They

334

can also be indicated by means of a subordinating affix on the verb. Some nominalizers and subordinators can indicate different types of clauses. For instance, a nominalized form in -(õ)o can indicate a direct object or a subject clause, and subordinator -(k)he can indicate a causal or a temporal clause. This is because the exact nature of a subordinative relation is not necessarily expressed by means of a particular nominalizer or subordinator, but rather by the context.
In chapter 7 we have seen that verb stems can be nominalized by means of the nominalizers -(e)… ‘factive’ (section 7.4.6.1), -(k)te ‘infinitive’ (section 7.4.6.2), -lam ‘future nominalizer 1' (section 7.4.6.3), -(õ)o ‘future nominalizer 2' (section 7.4.6.4) and -u… ‘agentive’(section 7.4.6.5); and finite forms by means of the deictics ko ‘this one’ and iõko ‘that one’ (section 7.4.7.6), or by a zero-nominalizer (section 7.4.2.1, 7.4.7.6 and 7.4.8). Nominalized forms can be followed by the following case markers and case marker or suffix combinations: -he ‘for (the benefit of)’; -lyak-pat ‘because’; -lyak-te-p ‘because’; -man-ap ‘after’, ‘besides/ not only/ on top of’, ‘than (comparison)’, ‘from (avoidance)’; -(mi)ny ‘as/like’, ‘on the verge of’; -((n)a)p ‘after’; -pat ‘because’; -pat-le ‘till’; -te ‘when’, ‘where’; -te-p ‘after’, ‘because’, ‘from (avoidance)’; -tu-p ‘for (cause)’; -tu-p(-ham)-pit ‘although’, ‘even though’, a suffix combination consisting of adessive -tu, ablative -p, and the coordinator -pit ‘also’. We have also seen that a verb stem can be subordinated by means of the subordinators -hu ‘switch-reference’ (section 7.4.7.1), -(k)he ‘simultaneity’ (section 7.4.7.2), -(n)ap ‘sequence’ (section 7.4.7.3), and -((k)t-)e… ‘resultative’, ‘purpose’ (section 7.4.7.4). Subordinated forms in -(k)he and -(n)ap can be followed by the case marker -nake, indicating a contrastive clause, and subordinator -(k)he can furthermore be followed by the case markers -pat ‘instrumental’ and -((n)a)p ‘after’. It appears that the different types of subordinate clauses mentioned above can be indicated by means of the following endings: (i) attributive extension of the object: -(e)…, -hu:

(73) kasalaõ mi-ki-pe-…-ap, mi-l-ø-aõ-ko marriage 2sS-do-NE-FAC-ABL 2sA-3sO-do-IA-DEM ‘Before you marry, look what you do’.

tsa…-ø (1635) 3sO.see-IMP

(b) -ø-miny-…o, consisting of a zero-nominalizer, the comparative case marker -(mi)ny and the adverb -…o ‘already’, when followed by kot-he/-hu ‘being’ (see also
section 7.4.7.5):

(74) me… ø-liš-ø-miny-…o

ø-kot-hu, tsamol-iy-la (1561)

‘They left the tree, which was on the verge of falling down’.

3sS-be-IA 1sPOS-REL-back 3sS-come-F-IA-DEM

‘The one who was before I was, that is the one who will come after me’.

(xvi) conditional. As stated in section 10.6, a condicional clause is formed by means of the topic marker -(w)a:

(76) palyow me-kt-iy-a,

ok-pit palyow a-kt-iy ø-kot-te-ke (384)

good 2sS-be-PST-TOP 1s-COR good 1sS-be-PST 3sS-be-INF-ANT

‘If you would have been good, I would also have been good’.

12.4. Relative clauses Relative clauses are formed by means of the future nominalizers -lam and -(õ)o, the nominalizing deictics -ko ‘this one’ and -iõko/-ø ‘that one’, the demonstrative -into-õko ‘which’ and the indefinite pronoun ol ‘who’. Forms in -lam and -(õ)o can be used attributively before (-lam as well as -(õ)o) or after a head (-lam). In the ALC headless relative clauses also occur. De la Mata analyzes them as ‘participles’. The
head of a relative clause can be the subject or object of the sentence.
As stated in section 7.4.5.3 attributive adjuncts or relative clauses formed by
means of nominalizer -lam may precede or follow the head:

(77) ko lyup-maõ

ki-h…o-lam-a

konfession-sim

this immersion-INES 1pS-be.submerged-FN1-TOP confession-EMP

ø-kot-aõ (1205)

3sS-be-IA

‘This immersion is the sacramental confession’. (lit. ‘This immersion in

which we are submerged is the sacramental confession’).

342

(78) ki-tsel-pat

ku-tup-lam pana (2317)

1pPOS-foot-INS 1pS-walk-FN1 road

‘a footpath’ (lit. ‘a road which we have to walk by our feet’)

Those formed by means of -(õ)o precede the head (see section 7.4.5.4):

(79) ko õosilyw-o

putam-te (2976)

this 3sS.go.round-FN2 world-AD

‘in this beautiful world’ (lit. ‘in this world which goes round’)

(80) u-k-kulyha-weh-o tsukiow (1204) 3sA-1pO-life-VB-FN2 medicin ‘a vivifying medicin’ (lit. ‘a medicin which gives life’)

Headless relative clauses can be formed by means of the nominalizing demonstratives -ko (see section 7.4.5.6.1) and -iõko (see section 7.4.5.6.2), and by means of -lam (see section 7.4.5.6.2). The presence of ko is required in present tense forms in -(a)õ; iõko is found optionally with verbs marked for past or future tense, and with nominalizer -lam:

(81) a-õoly-aõ-ko (795) 1sA-3sO.love-IA-DEM ‘I who love him/her/it’

(82) a-õoly-iy-iõko (6)98 1sA-3sO.love-PST-DEM ‘I who loved him/her/it’

a-õoly-iy-ø (798) 1sA-3sO.love-PST-NOM ‘I who loved him/her/it’

(83) a-õole-kt-an-iõko (801) 1sA-3sO.love-F-IA-DEM ‘I who shall love him/her/it’

a-õole-kt-aõ-ø (801) 1sA-3sO.love-F-IA-NOM ‘I who shall love him/her/it’

(84) a-õole-lam-iõko (802) 1sA-3sO.love-FN1-DEM ‘I who shall love him/her/it’

a-õole-lam (802) 1sA-3sO.love-FN1 ‘I who shall love him/her/it’

In relative clauses in -ko the head of the form in -ko is the subject:

(85) nonas-na ø-ki-aõ-ko

hakol l-o-its-t-aõ (1470)

glory-QUOT 3sS-speak-IA-DEM humble 3sS-do-PAS-F-IA

‘He who gloryfies himself will be humiliated’.

In relative clauses in -iõko the head can be either a subject or an object:

343

(86) pi-man-ap santo maso-kt-aõ-iõko (1466) 2sf-INES-ABL saint 3sS.be.born-F-IA-DEM ‘He who will originate from you [will be] a saint’. (lit. ‘The saint that will be born will be from you’).

‘Whoever I shall kiss, catch him, he is the one’.

(89) ko hil l-o-its-iy,

ki-tsaš-te (1463)

this word 3sS-make-PAS-PST 1pA-3sO.see-F

‘Let us see the word which was made’.

The head of a form in -lam(-iõko) is the object:

(90) mi-l-o-lam(-iõko)

šipna-ly mi-l-o-ki (1489)

2sA-3sO-do-FN1(-DEM) quick-RST 2sA-3sO-do-IMP

‘What you have to do, do it quickly’.

A relative clause of which the object is the antecedent, can also be expressed by a syntactic construction in which the demonstrative into-õko or the indefinite ol play the role of a relative pronoun:

(91) iõko nyalo ol/ into-õko

‘He saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following him (Jesus), [and] this one

rested on his chest at the Last Supper’.

344

12.5. Nominal predicate constructions Nominalized forms in -lam ‘future nominalizer 1', -(õ)o ‘future nominalizer 2' and -pakna ‘negative nominalizer’ (see the section 7.4.5.3, 7.4.5.4 and 11.7, respectively), can function as a nominal predicate when followed by a copula. In the case of -lam, the subjects of the form in -lam and the copula are then identical:

(92) a-lu-poh-lam

a-kt-aõ (1617)

1sS-interior-burn-FN1 1sS-be-IA

‘I used to abhor’.

In the case of -(õ)o and -pakna, the negative counterpart of -(õ)o, the subject of the copula can either be identical to or different from that of the nominalized form in (õ)o and -pakna. When the subjects are identical, the sentence is in the active voice:

(93) ašmaõ mi-lya-õo me-kt-aõ first 2sS-go-FN2 2sS-be-IA ‘You have to go first’.

mi-wa (1080) 2s-TOP

(94) mi-lyawoh-pakna me-kt-aõ 2sS-carry-NE.NOM 2sS-be-IA ‘You may not carry your bed’.

mi-yelam-a (1574) 2sPOS-bed-TOP

When the subject of the copula corresponds to the object of the form in -(õ)o or pakna, the sentence is passive:

(95) minyip-…e real

Juaõ mi-l-e-õo

four-CL:round quarter.of.a.peseta Juan 2sA-3sO-give-FN2

ø-kot-aõ (1516)

3sS-be-IA

‘You must give Juan four quarters of a peseta’.

(lit. ‘Juan is to be given four quarters of a peseta by you’).

(96) pe mek …e-kt-aõ-ko-lyak-pat, into-ny ki-po-wo-pakna that all 3sS-be-IA-DEM-NF-INS which-CMP 1pA-3pO-do-NE.NOM …e-kt-aõ (60) 3pS-be-IA ‘They were that many, that we could not count them’. (lit. ‘Because they were that many, they could not be done by us’).

345

12.6. Irrealis or hypothetical clauses
Irrealis or hypothetical clauses are formed by means of the anteriority and nominal
past marker -(k)e, attached to a nominalized form in -(k)te ‘infinitive’ (see section 7.4.5.2), -(õ)o ‘future nominalizer 2' (see section 7.4.5.4), or -pakna, the negative counterpart of -(õ)o (see section 11.7). We have seen that the endings -(k)te-ke, -(õ)o-ke, -pakna-ke express ‘future in the past’ and that they indicate that the event could or could not have taken place, or that it has not been realized:

(97) inaham palyow a-kot-te-ke/ a-kot-o-ke (352) I.wished good 1sS-be-INF-ANT/ 1sS-be-FN2-ANT ‘I wished I had been good’.

(98) a-kot-pits-o-ke (467) 1sS-be-NE-FN2-ANT ‘I would not have been’

(99) a-kot-pakna-ke (485) 1sS-be-NE.NOM-ANT ‘I would not have been’

(100)

mi-ha-wa mi-l-o-ha-pakna-ke,

ok-nake a-l-ø-aõ (2384)

2-PL-TOP 2A-3sO-do-PL-NE.NOM-ANT 1s-PER 1sA-3sO-do-IA

‘I do what you (p) have not been able to do’.

When a sentence contains two irrealis clauses, viz. when it contains two forms expressing a non-realized or hypothetical event, the form in -(õ)o-ke precedes the one in -(k)te-ke:

(101)

palyow mi-kot-o-ke-wa,

a-m-penyo-kte-ke (367)

good 2sS-be-FN2-ANT-TOP 1sA-2sO-want-INF-ANT

‘If you had been good, I would have wanted you’.

When both sentences are negative, the clause containing the form in -pits-o-ke precedes the clause with -pakna-ke:

(102)

yel ø-kot-iy-pits-o-ke-wa,

ay…a ki-mtih-pakna-ke (504)

salt 3sS-be-PST-NE-FN2-ANT-TOP meal 1pA-salt-NE.NOM-ANT

‘If there had not been salt, we could not salt the meat’.

13. Dictionary
13.1. Introduction The lexicon below (section 13.2) contains the nouns (N), demonstratives (DEM), numerals (NUM), numeral classifiers (CL), pronouns (PRON), indefinite pronouns (INDP), question words (QW), verbs, bound verbs (BV), adverbs (ADV), interjections (INTJ), derived items, such as attributives (ATT), and expressions found in the ALC. Some items have a second, alternative form. Alternative forms are separated by a slash: ampek/ empek ‘good’, ‘allright’. Items borrowed from Spanish or Quechua are respectively indicated by means of the abbreviations Sp and QUE, put in parentheses.
In the lexicon, nouns which make a distinction between an absolute form and a relational form are represented in their absolute form, i.e. in the form with a steminitial vowel or stem-initial k, p, h, y. Remember that nouns which begin with a vowel take n in their relational forms; stem-initial k and h change into õ and s, respectively, in the third person singular possessive form; and stem-initial p and y change into m and ts, respectively, in all the relational forms (see section 5.5). In chapter 5 we have also seen that nouns can be subject to vowel reduction (section 5.4.2) and that the vowel i of a person prefix harmonizes with the stem vowels e and u (section 5.4.1). In the ALC, a small number of nouns only occur in a reduced form, i.e. with a suppressed stem vowel. The identity of this vowel can not be discovered when the person prefix of the noun at issue is a first person singular a-, or when the person prefix does not have a copy vowel. Non-identifiable suppressed stem vowels are represented by means of a capital V, ‘vowel’, in parentheses: e.g. h(V)lyem ‘friend’.
As regards the verbs, we have seen in section 7.4.1 that a minority of stems retain their full shape under all circumstances. Most of the verb stems can be reduced by means of vowel suppression or consonant suppression: class 1 verbs have a consonantal stem with a suppressable internal vowel (cf. k(o)t ‘(to) be’); class 2 verbs have a stem with a suppressable final h (cf. lo(h) ‘(to) wet’); the stem of class 3 verbs ends in e, which can be reduced to a non-syllabic palatal sound (cf. kole/ koly ‘(to) love’); the stem of class 4 verbs have a suppressable final a (cf. pats(a) ‘(to) take all day’); class 5 verbs end in o, which is suppressed before the imperfective marker -(a)õ (cf. peny(o) ‘(to) want’). The suppressable elements of the verb stems are also put in parentheses (see the examples above). For a number of verbs, however, the available information is not sufficient, so that we can not decide whether the verb in question has a non-reducible stem, nor to which class it belongs. For instance, the verb ‘(to) cherish’ only occurs as ‘hanyaõ’ in the following form: ikhanyaõkolyak-pat ‘because he cherishes us’. It may indicate that in Cholón ‘(to) cherish’ is a transitive verb and that it has a non-reducible stem, so that it is obviously not a class 1 verb. However, the form hanyaõ could also be an imperfective aspect form which could be derived of hanya(h) (class 2); hane/ hany (class 3); hany(a) (class 4); hany(o) (class 5); hany (non-reducible stem). In the lexicon, a nonclassifiable verb is followed by the numbers of the verb classes to which the verb

348
may belong. Hybrids like y(a)m(o) ‘(to) know’(see section 7.3.1), which partly behave as a class 1 verb and partly as a class 5 verb, are indicated by means of the numbers 1 + 5. A non-reducible stem is indicated by means of the abbreviation ‘NR’ and irregular stems by means of the abbreviation ‘IR’ (see section ‘Irregularities’ 7.3.2, and section 7.3.3.2 for the irregular stems of bound verbs). The numbers of the possible verb classes and the abbreviations ‘NR’ and ‘IR’ are put in parentheses after the bare verb form, viz. the form stripped of its ending aõ, suffix -(i)y, nominalizers, or subordinators: e.g.: hany (2, 3, 4, 5, or NR) ‘(to) cherish’. Some verbs - class 3 verbs, for instance - have two stems. These stems are separated by a slash. Since the distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs is not clear-cut in Cholón (the stem of an intransitive verb can be part of a transitive verb form, and vice versa, see section 7.2), transitivity is not indicated in the lexicon.
As regards the derived items it should be noticed that not all the derived forms have been listed in this lexicon. Regularly derived verbs, adverbs and expressions with a usual meaning, viz. a meaning that can be expected, have not been listed, but those with unexpected meanings and those derived irregularly, have been included, as are the derived nouns and adjectives, which are few in number. The derived forms occur indented below the item from which they have been derived.
It should furthermore be noticed that the item kiši(h) ‘(to) cheat’ below has been derived from the irregular imperfective aspect form a-õisi-ny ‘I deceive’, ‘I cheat’, the only form of this verb found in de la Mata’s data, and, the only imperfective aspect form ending in a palatal nasal. Imperfective aspect forms regularly end in a velar nasal (see section 7.1). The verb p(V)nye(h) ‘(to) leave’ also only occurs in one form:
mi-pnyeh-la-kt-aõ (1366) 2sO-leave-3pA-F-IA ‘they will leave you’
The stem p(V)nye(h) may have been derived from a hybrid verb *p(V)ny(o), cf. ts(a)m(o) ‘(to) know’ (1 + 5) > ts(a)me(h) ‘(to) teach’ (2). Since the verb has a consonantal stem ending in h, we may assume that it behaves as a class 2 verb.

Appendices
1. Maps Appendix 1 includes the maps referred to in chapter 1 - 3, four in sum. They represent the following areas: Map I (Roswith Hartmann, 1987, XII, from Kauffmann Doig, 1982): Peru; Map II (Izaguirre, 1922, VI: 99): the valley of the Huallaga river, the habitat of the Cholón people. The Cholón habitat stretched out, longitudinally, from the town of Juanjui in the north until Santa María del Valle in the south, and, latitudinally, from the Huallaga river to the Marañón river and the eastern slopes of the Andes. In addition to Juanjui and Santa María del Valle, the towns of (San Buenaventura del) Valle, Sión, Tingo María, Cachicoto, Monzón and Huánuco can be found on this map. (All the above-mentioned places were visited by me during my quest for Cholón speakers in 1996). Names of other ethnic groups can also be found on this map, such as the Hívito, i.e. Híbito, and the Tinganese. According to most linguists, Híbito is related to Cholón (see section 1.2); according to Tessmann, Tinganese is another name for Cholón; Map III (Martínez Compañón, [1783] 1978, I): the former province of Pataz. The map shows the four missions where the Franciscans brought together the Cholón and Híbito people (see section 2.4.1): Jesus de Pajatén (Híbito), San Buenaventura del Valle (Cholón), Jesus de Monte Sion (Híbito) and Pisano or Pampa Hermosa (Cholón). The second mission, San Buenaventura del Valle, is the place where Gerónimo Clota copied de la Mata’s ALC (see section 3.1 and Appendix 2); Map IV: the valleys of the rivers Huallaga and Ucayali. This map was made by Father Sobreviela in 1790 and corrected by Amedée Chaumette des Fossés in 1830 (see section 2.1).

2. Folios Appendix 2 includes a copy of the beginning (folio 1) and the end (folios 248 and 249) of the ALC. We see that the ALC classically starts with some remarks about sounds (folio 1).
Folio 248 verso shows the name of the founder of the mission of San Buenaventura del Valle: Friar Francisco Gutiérrez de Porres, and that of the founder of the mission of Jesús de Ochanache: Friar Joseph de Araujo. It also shows the name of the author of the ALC (Friar Pedro de la Mata); the date on which de la Mata finished the ALC (October 21, 1748); and the name of the place where the ALC was written (Trujillo). Pedro de la Mata here states that the symbols which he used to represent the ‘gutural sounds’, viz. velar nasal, are the same as those used by Francisco Gutiérrez de Porres and Joseph de Araujo, and he praises both friars for the fact that they converted Cholones and Híbitos to the faith. This means that Francisco Gutiérrez de Porres and Joseph de Araujo spoke Cholón and Híbito, that they had already produced some writing in Cholón and Híbito, and that Pedro de la Mata made use of their work to write his grammar.
On folio 249 recto Friar Gerónimo Clota states that he copied the ALC in the village of San Buenaventura del Valle and that he finished the copy on February 19, 1772.

3. Overview of the Cholón forms and examples encountered in the ALC This appendix contains all the Cholón forms occurring in the ALC (Appendix 3.1), and an overview of de la Mata’s declination of the noun hayu ‘man’ and his conjugation of the verbs k(o)t ‘(to) be’, õole/õoly ‘(to) love someone/something’and meny(o) ‘(to) want someone/something’ (Appendix 3.2). The spelling employed in the ALC has not been altered. In Appendix 3.1, however, separate words which in the grammar are written as one single word are separated by a triangle (?); separately written elements and morphemes, on the other hand, which form one single word are joined together by means of a superscript circle (E); elements to omit have been put between round brackets, and those to insert between square brackets. Furthermore, abbreviated forms are written in full and the abbreviated elements have been underlined. An exception has been made for the names of the evangelists Ioan. (Ioannis ‘John’), Luc. (Lucas ‘Luke’), Marc., Marci. (Marcus ‘Mark’), Math. (Matthaeus ‘Matthew’) and the name of the Bible book Gen. (Genesis ‘Genesis’); for ecclesiastical forms of address such as Sta. (Santa ‘Saint’) and Sr. Ntro. (Señor Nuestro ‘Our Lord’); and for a few Latin abbreviations, such as C. (Caput ‘chapter’) and l (vel ‘or’). These abbreviations have been left as they are. Occasionally, the structure of a form has been indicated or explained. These indications and explanations have been added to the Spanish and Latin glosses. The contents and the theoretical part of a section have sometimes been summarized. These brief summaries have also been put between square brackets. They usually occur at the beginning of the section in question.

3.2. Declination of the noun hayu ‘man’ and conjugation of the verbs k(o)t ‘(to) be’, õole/õoly ‘(to) love someone/something’, and meny(o) ‘(to) want someone/something’
This appendix presents (i) a survey of de la Mata’s declination of the noun hayu ‘man’ (ALC, fol. 3):

nominativo: genitivo: dativo: acusativo: vocativo: ablativo:

hayu/ hayu-tup hayu i-l-o-w hayu-he hayu-te/ -tu hayu-ey/ -pey hayu-te nun-te-p hayu-pat/ -lyak-pat/ -lyak-te-p
-man-ap hayu-nik/ hayu nek

‘el hombre o gente’ ‘del hombre o de la gente’ ‘para el hombre o [para la gente] ‘al hombre’ ‘olá hombre, olá muger’ ‘en el hombre’ ‘ex viro’, ‘de varón o por obra de varón’, ‘por o por amor o por causa del hombre’ ‘ex/ de’ ‘de compañía con el hombre’

(ii) a survey of his conjugation of the verbs kot ‘(to) be’, õole ‘(to) love someone/ something’ and menyo ‘(to) want someone/something’. This survey is followed by an overview of the endings of the moods and tenses distinguished by de la Mata. For convenience sake, only the forms of second person singular and plural are represented in the survey of the conjugation of the verbs mentioned above. The paradigm of imperative, however, is represented in its entirety. The forms of ablative of gerund which are not marked for person are also listed in the survey. Present participle has an alternative form which ends in the agentive marker -(w)u…:

ø-kot-u…
ø-õole-u… ø-menyo-wu…

‘a being’, ‘the present person’ ‘lover’ ‘lover’

This form has not been listed, because it is not considered as a verb form, but as a derived noun (see section 6.10). The forms between square brackets are forms which do not occur in Pedro de la Mata’s conjugation of the verb in question, but which were constructed by analogy with the corresponding form of the verb below or above, or with that of another verb, for example, (o) ‘(to) do/make’:

4. Vowel positions and consonant clusters
This supplement contains Cholón words showing the occurrence of vowel symbols
before and after a consonant symbol in one syllable (Appendix 4.1). It also contains
an overview of consonantal boundary clusters (Appendix 4.2). As stated in Table
4.13, section 4.2.6, the vowel symbols occurring before and after a consonant
symbol are i, e, a, o, u. The consonant symbols and variants - separated from each other by a slash - are p, t, c/k/qu, tz, ch, s/z, x, g/h/j, m, n, ñ, ng~(u), l, ll, b/hu/u/v, i/y, representing the sounds [p], [t], [k], [ts], […], [s], [š], [x] or [h], [m], [n], [ny], [õ], [l], [ly], [w], [y], respectively.

4.1. Examples with vowel positions Table I below contains Cholón words with vowel symbols appearing before a consonant symbol. The occurrences of vowel symbols after a consonant symbol can be found in Table II. In these tables, only non-borrowed words have been used as examples, loan words have been left out. As regards the examples that have been bracketed and for further explanation, see the remarks after Table 12 in section 4.2.6.

Table I: The vowel symbols i, e, a, o, u, occurring before the consonant symbols p, t, c, tz, ch, s, z, x, g, h, j, m, n, ñ, ng~, l, ll, u, i, y within a syllable.

4.2. Overview of consonant clusters
This supplement presents an overview of consonantal boundary clusters found in the
data of de la Mata, together with a form in which they occur. As stated in section
5.3, this overview, since it only contains forms attested in the ALC, is not exhaustive. For instance, the clusters nyt and nyš, which do not occur in the ALC, and
which, therefore, do not figure in the survey below, can very well be constructed by combining the numeral okony + the numeral classifiers tuh ‘detachable object’ and šuõ ‘accumulation’, respectively.

7. Word lists Appendix 7 contains the word lists of Martínez Compañón (7.1) and Tessmann (7.2), the data of Greenberg (7.3), and the lists of words and expressions given by Mrs. Aurelia Gutiérrez Cerquera and Mr. José Santos Chapa Ponce (7.4). For the sake of completeness, the word list of Loukotka (7.5) has been added as well.
The transcription of Cholón in the lists of Martínez Compañón, Tessmann, Greenberg and Loukotka has been left unaltered. As regards the value of the symbols used to transcribe the utterances of Mrs. Gutiérrez and Mr. Chapa, see Table 4.24. In addition to those symbols, the following symbols have been used in the transcription of Mrs. Gutiérrez’ and Mr. Chapa’s words: j and §. The former symbolizes a voiced palatal plosive, the latter a glottal stop. Length is represented by means of the colon, nasalization by means of a tilde, and accent by means of an acute accent. Note that accent is only indicated when it is not word-final.

7.4. List of words and expressions given by Mrs. Gutiérrez and Mr. Chapa A large part of the words and expressions given by Mrs. Gutiérrez (7.4.1) and Mr. Chapa (7.4.2) were not elicited. Both Cholón descendants spoke freely, rambling from subject to subject. In the lists below their words have been ordered thematically and alphabetically. The Híbito words given by Mrs. Gutiérrez have also been listed. It should, furthermore, be noticed that Mrs. Gutiérrez’ and Mr. Chapa’s utterances show that a modifier can be preposed as well as postposed. The words ges ‘old’, mexlam/ mexlyam ‘female’ and šalam/ šalaõ ‘lazy’ can, for instance, occur in preposed position as well as in postposed position. The other modifiers are only used postpositionally. What is striking, when we compare the word lists of both speakers, is that Mrs. Gutiérrez and Mr. Chapa give a different meaning to the word …amyo. According to the former …amyo means ‘tiger’, according to latter it means a ‘red kind of monkey’.

Samenvatting
Het Cholón vormt samen met het Híbito een kleine taalfamilie die in het algemeen als geïsoleerd zijnde wordt beschouwd (hoofdstuk 1). Het Cholón werd in NoordPeru in de vallei van de Huallaga rivier gesproken. De Huallaga is een brede, snelstromende zijrivier van de Marañón (Amazone). Het taalgebied van de Cholones is tamelijk groot. Longitudinaal gezien strekt het zich uit vanaf de plaats Juanjui in het noorden tot aan het ongeveer 600 km. zuidelijker gelegen Huánuco; in de breedte strekt het zich uit vanaf de oostelijke hellingen van de Andes in het westen tot aan de Cordillera Oriental, die de grens vormt tussen de departementen San Martín en Loreto, in het oosten (hoofdstuk 2).
De enige bron van uitgebreide taalkundige informatie die van het Cholón overgeleverd is, is een grammatica uit de achttiende eeuw: de Arte de la lengua cholona (ALC) (hoofdstuk 3). De ALC werd in 1748 in Trujillo, een plaats aan de Noordperuaanse kust, geschreven door een franciscaner monnik, Pedro de la Mata genaamd. In 1772 werd de grammatica in de nederzetting San Buenaventura del Valle door Fray Gerónimo Clota getranscribeerd. Het manuscript ligt nu in de British Library in Londen. Aangezien de taal mogelijk uitgestorven is, is de huidige beschrijving van het Cholón gebaseerd op dit manuscript.
In hoofdstuk 4 wordt, na analyse van de in de ALC gebruikte spelling en van de opmerkingen over weergave en klanken, gepoogd het klanksysteem te reconstrueren. Hoofdstuk 5 behandelt de morfonologie. Hierin wordt onder andere aandacht besteed aan syllabestructuren en aan fenomenen zoals vocaalsuppressie en -harmonisatie en stam-initiële consonantveranderingen.
Nominale en verbale morfosyntaxis komen in de hoofdstukken 6 en 7 respectievelijk aan bod. Het Cholón is een agglutinerende taal. Nominale en verbale stammen kunnen voorafgegaan worden door persoonsprefixen en gevolgd worden door derivationele en /of casus markeerders. De taal maakt in de tweede persoon enkelvoud een onderscheid in geslacht: het prefix mi- wordt gebruikt wanneer de geadresseerde een man is en pi- wanneer het een vrouw betreft. Een bijzonder nominaal achtervoegsel is het suffix dat achter de termen ‘vader’, ‘moeder’, ‘dochter’, ‘zoon’ en ‘echtgenoot’ gevoegd wordt en dat ‘paar’ of de natuurlijke tegenhanger aangeeft: moeder-paar = moeder en dochter, vader-paar = vader en zoon, etc. Net zoals een aantal andere Zuidamerikaanse talen kent het Cholón suffixen die achter een hoeveelheidswoord geplaatst kunnen worden en aangeven tot welke klasse het getelde woord behoort. Zo’n classificerend element geeft onder meer de vorm (rond), de samenstelling (groep levende wezens) of een eigenschap (draagbaar) van het gekwantificeerde aan. Werkwoordstammen kunnen al dan niet reduceerbaar zijn. De gereduceerde stam wordt onder andere gevolgd door de markeerder van het incompletief aspect. Derivationele suffixen, nominalizeerders en subordinatoren komen achter de onverkorte stam. Door middel van bepaalde derivationele achtervoegsels kunnen onder andere ontkennende, passieve en reflexieve verba gevormd worden. Door middel van nominalisaties kunnen verschillende bijzinnen gevormd worden: causale bijzinnen, subject- en objectzinnen en temporele

532
bijzinnen. Bijzinnen kunnen ook gevormd worden door middel van een nulnominalizeerder gevolgd door een casus markeerder en door middel van een subordinator. Een subordinator kan tevens aangeven of het onderwerp van de hoofdzin en de bijzin naar dezelfde persoon verwijst of dat het om verschillende personen gaat (switch-reference).
Naast naamwoorden en werkwoorden, de twee belangrijkste woordcategorieën, kent het Cholón een gesloten categorie van adverbia (hoofdstuk 8) en interjecties (hoofdstuk 9). In hoofdstuk 10 worden de discours markeerders behandeld (vraagmarkeerders en uitroepmarkeerders bijvoorbeeld). Hoofdstuk 11 is gewijd aan de ontkenning. In hoofdstuk 12 wordt een overzicht gegeven van de verschillende bijzinnen. Het taalkundig gedeelte wordt afgesloten door een lexicon (hoofdstuk 13).
De appendices, die op het register en de bibliografie volgen, bevatten kaarten van het Cholóngebied en verschillende woordenlijsten, waaronder de lijsten met woorden en uitdrukkingen van Mevrouw A. Gutiérrez de Porres en Mijnheer J. Santos Chapa Ponce, afstammelingen van het Cholónvolk.

Curriculum vitae
Astrid Bakkerus werd op 4 november 1943 te Batu in Indonesië geboren. Samen met haar ouders emigreerde zij in 1955 naar Brazilië. In 1960 ging zij naar Nederland, waar zij de middelbare school afmaakte. In 1980 verwierf zij met een alleszins bevredigend resultaat het doctoraal diploma Franse taal- en letterkunde met Portugees als bijvak aan de Rijksuniversiteit Leiden en in 1996 met cum laude het doctoraal diploma Vergelijkende taalwetenschappen (Amerindische talen) eveneens aan de Rijksuniversiteit Leiden. Vanaf 1975 tot 2000 heeft zij Frans gedoceerd op verschillende middelbare scholen. Daarna heeft NT2-lessen (Nederlands als tweede taal) gegeven. Zij is nu als vrijwilligster werkzaam.
