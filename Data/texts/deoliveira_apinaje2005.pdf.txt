Title: THE LANGUAGE OF THE APINAJÉ PEOPLE OF CENTRAL BRAZIL

Approved: _______________________________________________ Spike Gildea

The dissertation is a preliminary grammatical description of the language spoken by the Apinajé, one of the Northern Jê peoples of Central Brazil. It discusses the core facts about Apinajé phonology, morphology and syntax from a functional-typlogical perspective, and provides three appendices: selected maps, a sample collection of texts and a preliminary dictionary. The phonological analysis proposes an alternative interpretation for the inventory of phonemes as compared to earlier analyses, pointing to phonemic distinctions not previously noted, which might lead to interesting findings regarding the historical development of the language. Apinajé morphemes are typically monosyllabic and the language makes ample use of function words for the expression of grammatical categories, properties that are characteristic of analytic languages. Nonetheless, Apinajé morphology is more complex than it might seem at first, especially with respect to the major lexical categories of the language: Nouns, Verbs and

v Postpositions. These word classes, especially Nouns and Verbs, are characterized morphologically by the presence of formatives, which are recurrent morphs that are either semantically empty or of elusive meaning, but which subcategorize words in formal or semantic terms. The categories of nonfiniteness, person, and syntactic constituency constitute the core of inflectional morphology, the last applying to nouns, postpositions, and verbs. Verbs are subcategorized morphosyntactically into transitives, intransitives and descriptives, displaying a split intransitivity system with respect to verbal personmarking. Word order is predominantly SOV. Syntactically complex constructions include verb serialization and clause subordination, with ergative case-marking a characteristic of subordinate clauses.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I wish to thank my advisor, Professor Spike Gildea, for his assistance in the preparation of this manuscript, as well as the members of my dissertation committee, for their thorough reading and excellent suggestions on a previous draft. My training in the doctoral program of the UO Linguistics Department was possible due to grants from the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq, Brazil) and the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, DCT number 55. Research on the Apinajé language was also sponsored in part by CNPq. I gratefully acknowledge both agencies for their financial support. I also acknowledge the Fundação Nacional do Índio (FUNAI) for assistance with the documentation needed for the research. My research on Apinajé would most certainly not have been possible without the support of the Apinajé community, for which I am most grateful. I especially wish to thank Amci Creuza de Souza Fernandes; Iré Rita Dias Laranja; Greri Júlia Estêvão Laranja and Ireptsi Maria Barbosa, in memoriam; and Kojkoti Iraci Dias, for their friendship, kindness, warmth, good humor, and enthusiastic interest in my research; this work is as much theirs as it is mine. I also wish to express my deepest appreciation for the festivals, rituals, great food and fresh air, during my stay in Apinajé country. Finally, I thank Marilita Neves de Jesus for taking such good care of us all. Many people have shared with me the good times and bad, during my time as a student. I am most thankful to all of these people, who will always be in my heart. I will not list your names here; you know who you are. Axé!

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION The purpose of this dissertation is to present a description of the language spoken by the Apinajé, one of the Northern Jê peoples of Central Brazil. The study is based on original data collected by the author in various trips to the field between October 1995 and August 2000, as well as in interviews with speakers of the language in the city of Goiânia, Goiás State, Brazil. Rather than a definite account of the language, this work is intended as the kernel of what will evolve into a more comprehensive grammar as further analysis is conducted; for the time being, my main goal is to lay out as many patterns as can possibly be distilled from the available data, regarding the phonology, morphology, lexicon, and syntax of the language. From a broader perspective, I hope this study will serve as an effective source for historical-comparative work aiming at the reconstruction of the Jê linguistic family, and thus constitute an additional piece for the better understanding of the Macro-Jê stock, a still hypothetical classification for a number of little-documented South American languages.
The dissertation discusses the principal facts about Apinajé and includes three appendices: selected maps, a sample collection of texts and a preliminary dictionary. The remainder of this chapter presents general information about the Apinajé people, including some details about their culture and social organization; geographical, historical, and demographic facts; observations about language contact situations and the

2
school system available in the communities; as well as details about the genetic affiliation and previous studies done on the language. Methodological considerations and information about the database for the study, as well as conventions used in the text, are also presented in this chapter.
Because most previous studies focus on the phonology of Apinajé, the core of my research project has been devoted primarily to the study of its grammar. Nonetheless, facts about its phonology and morphophonology were also captured during my time in and out of the field. These observations are presented in Chapter II, along with a discussion of previous literature on Apinajé phonology. Chapter III is an introduction to Apinajé morphology in which the relevant morphological units and categories are presented. Chapter IV presents the syntactic and morphosyntactic properties of phrases and simple clauses. Subordination, serialization and other kinds of complex constructions are discussed in Chapter V. Chapter VI is the concluding section; it summarizes the major facts about Apinajé discussed in this work, includes some language internal hypotheses about the development of certain forms and structures, and points to areas that deserve further investigation. Illustrative maps regarding the history and geographical distribution of the Apinajé are found in Appendix A. Appendix B provides three text samples: a traditional story, a personal experience narrative, and an instructional narrative. Appendix C, the Apinajé Dictionary, was created out of the material available the general database I started in 1995, in addition to the items I collected primarily my the lexicographical project. Appendix D is a list of abbreviations used in the glosses.

1. The Apinajé people A distinguishing feature of Jê groups is the contrast between their relatively simple technology and their highly elaborate social organization. Jê material culture is noted for basketry techniques, but it does not include, for example, hammocks, canoes or ceramics. Jê social organization, on the other hand, is characterized by an intricate system of moieties and men’s groups, rules of proper name transmission, and a relationship terminology that ignores the generational distinction principle (Da Matta 1982; Carneiro da Cunha 2004). According to Da Matta’s interpretation, the Apinajé universe is ruled by a principle of dualism whereby elements at all dimensions are placed in a relation of complementary opposition thus constituting necessary parts of a closed totality.
Apinajé cosmology, social and physical organization is permeated by this dualism, which is not as much hierarchical as it is dialectic. This may be observed in the Apinajé creation myth, according to which all things existing on Earth were created by Sun and Moon. Sun, the older character, is the initiator, the one who poses a particular, harmonic state of affairs. Moon, the younger character, is the antithetical element, the one who questions the order and brings chaos into the status quo. The result of this interaction is a thesis that justifies the dual aspect of all creation in both nature and culture. Thus, animals, colors, name sets, ceremonial roles, among other things, are divided in pairs which are directly associated with either one or the other mythical character; and the members of each pair stand in a kind of inalienable relationship, for the existence of one is only justifiable by the existence of the other (Text I, Appendix B).

4
Kolti and Kolre, the most relevant pair of moieties of Apinajé social organization, are associated to Sun and Moon, respectively. The village layout and, with it, the distribution of marriage groups and formal friends, is guided by this affiliation.
The village community is the political unit of the Apinajé and is also the physical representation of their social organization. An ideal Apinajé village is circular; it includes a central plaza, a periphery area where houses stand, and a clearing beyond the limits of the village. The plaza is the ceremonial area of the village; the periphery is the domestic realm, and the clearing represents the transition from the cultural to the natural world (Da Matta 1982: 35; Nimuendajú 1983: 15).
Ceremonial groups are determined by moiety affiliation. The specific ordering, direction, adornments, behaviors and roles adopted and performed in the rituals are discrete, complementary elements that are pre-established according to each moiety. The same is true of name sets. Proper names are transmitted by formal friends starting at birth. The inventory of names possessed by an individual indicates which moiety s/he belongs to.
In the domestic circle, houses consist of at least one nuclear family plus the uxorilocal1 extended family. Residential segments are formed through economic cooperation between the members of a family and their affines (i.e. those related to them by marriage), including those from an exogamous group (which is also determined by the Kolti/Kolre division). The residential segment is the locus of political power. A strong
1 That part of the family that resides in the wife’s home.

5
segment reflects the capacity of its leader to aggregate members (especially if he manages to keep his sons-in-law within his own household) and to maintain harmony within the group. The prestige of a segment leader determines the degree of political loyalty he can count on when competing for chieftaincy of the village (Da Matta 1982).
Apinajé political structure is straightforward and effective. It includes the chief, his assistants, and a counselor. The chief retains the executive power (articulates collective work of interest to the village as a whole, adjucates internal disputes, is expected to maintain harmony within the village through the power of oratory and persuasion), while the counselor has a more symbolic role and is in charge of representing and enforcing the traditions (articulates ceremonial groups for the realization of rituals; must be an expert in Apinajé tradition, which is why the position is typically occupied by an elderly man).
The structure of an Apinajé village can only contain a limited number of houses, since the clearing at the outskirts of the village is not meant for dwelling. Likewise, there must be a minimum number of houses to form a proper Apinajé village (Da Matta 1982). New villages are formed when political factions decide to establish a new community, whether for political reasons or not. Be that as it may, a village can only start with a steady residential segment.
1.1. Geographical and environmental considerations The Central Plateau is a vast area ranging from north to south of Brazil that includes the Araguaia and Tocantins basins. The Brazilian Central Plateau encompasses the States of

6
Minas Gerais, Goiás, Tocantins, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, and parts of the States of São Paulo, Paraná, Maranhão and Piauí (map 1). The biome characteristic of these areas is the cerrado, a savanna landscape typical of Brazil.2
The cerrado is characterized by hot, semi-humid weather consisting of rainy summers and dry winters; rainfall indices range from 32 to 64 inches a year. The soil is ancient, deep, and naturally poor in chemical nutrients. Cerrado vegetation is characterized by a herbaceous stratum that extends over continuous, mostly flat areas with a variable quantity of trees and shrubs, and by forest formations at river banks; it includes, in addition, patches of palm trees and wetlands. Both the herbaceous layer and the ligneous vegetation are characterized by the ability to sprout or rapidly recover after the dry season or forest fires, a morphology that may have been an adaptive development of the vegetation to survive frequent natural fires caused by lightning and other natural phenomena. The various possible combinations and densities of the basic elements found in the cerrado vegetation result in a wealth of different ecosystems which house one of the largest diversities in plant and animal species on the planet (Pivello 2004; Delitti and Pivello 2004).3
The Apinajé, like most Jê, are a cerrado people. Traditional Apinajé territory is the delta at the confluence of the Tocantins and Araguaia rivers, in the north, extending
2 Because they differ in various respects from the savannas of Africa, the term “cerrado” has been adopted in the literature to refer to these typically Brazilian ecosystems (e.g. Goodland 1971; Pivello 2004). Being the second largest biome of Brazil, the cerrado originally extended over about eighty-five percent of the Central Plateau, which represents about 1,5 to 2 million square kilometers or approximately twenty percent of the Brazilian territory (Delitti and Pivello 2004; Fonseca and Por 2004). 3 For that reason, the cerrado is one of the priority areas for the preservation of biodiversity on Earth (Delitti and Pivello 2004).

approximately to 6°30” latitude south (Nimuendajú 1983:1; map 3). In spite of the proximity to the main rivers, the Apinajé typically build their villages inland, close to small creeks. Their economy relies basically on crops, gathering and hunting, differently from other Macro-Jê, such as their Karajá neighbors, who typically live at the river banks and rely mostly on fishing.
Until the beginning of the twentieth century, the territory of the Apinajé was divided into three contiguous, politically defined areas, each with its main village and chief. These areas are associated, in the literature, with three distinct Apinajé groups: the Rõrkojoire, the Cocojoire, and the Krijobreire.4 Rõrkojoire territory extended from the Araguaia river to the Pecôbo (or Carreira de Pedra) river; Cocojoire territory followed from the Pecôbo river to the Grande creek; and Krijobreire territory extended from the Grande to the Curicaca creek (Ladeira 1983; A. Oliveira 1994; map 3). This original configuration was later modified due to accelerating contact with colonialists and, eventually, with the resulting dominant society.
At present, official Apinajé territory represents less than fifty percent of its original area. Such was the result of gradual occupation of the region by ranchers, small farmers and babaçu collectors, which eventually led the Apinajé to near oblivion vis-à-vis the Federal authorities in the early twentieth century. However, they resisted the occupation and finally had their land rights recognized by the federal government in the

early eighties. Currently, the Terra Indígena Apinajé is an area of 141.904 hectares that includes thirteen villages for a population of about 1,300 individuals (map 2). The land is legally reserved for the social, economic and cultural subsistence of the Apinajé, as guaranteed by the Brazilian Constitution of 1988.
1.2. History The contemporary history of the Apinajé is intertwined with the history of the foundation of Goiás State, which takes us back to the colonial history of Brazil as the background.
In the seventeenth century, the economy of Portugal depended largely on Brazilian agriculture for its sustainability. Sugar, cultivated throughout the northeastern area that is now the State of Bahia, was one of the most important marketing goods produced in Brazil. In the second half of the century, however, large-scale colonization of the Caribbean islands imposed fierce competition in the sugar market, resulting in the decrease of prices. In face of the recession, Portugal invested in tobacco as its new economic pillar in South America.
Tobacco became one of Portugal’s principal trading goods for investment and export revenue, as well as for the commerce of African slaves. Tobacco crops extended from the north of Bahia into other northeastern States, including Maranhão and Piauí. This led to an incipient occupation of the Central Plateau by colonial forces, consisting mostly of African slaves and European managers. Recession hit the Portuguese tobacco monopoly in the 1680’s, with the competition imposed by the tobacco crops of Virginia, in North America (Birmingham 1993).

9
In 1697, Brazilian explorers coming from São Paulo in search of Indian slaves and natural resources struck gold in the inlands (Birmingham 1993).5 The Bandeiras, as such expeditions were called, entered the Central Plateau through the Paranaíba basin, in the south.6 In 1727, Bartolomeu Bueno da Silva II and Manoel Campos Bicudo discovered the abundant gold deposits of the Mortes river, beginning an intense gold rush that would extend over the next fifty years (Ribeiro da Silva 1932: 48-9; A. Oliveira 1994). The discovery of gold was obviously welcomed by the crown, which lived on it ostentatiously for as long as the enterprise lasted.
Such progress in the gold industry served to stimulate the Brazilian economy as a whole: the agricultural (tobacco, sugar, cotton) and ranching activities found in the gold mining district a new marketing prospect. The same was true of the slave market (Birmingham 1993). The prosperity of the gold industry was thus the catalyst for the systematic population of the Brazilian Central Plateau by the colonial forces.
The first navigations along the courses of the Araguaia and the Tocantins occurred in the early seventeenth century, when Catholic missionaries based in Grão-Pará led expeditions starting at the mouths of both rivers in a twofold campaign of religious conversion and exploitation of natural resources (Nimuendajú 1983; Moraes Jardim 1915; Paternostro 1945). Fluvial expeditions started from the south as well. In 1673,
5 Other records indicate that the discovery of gold in the Tocantins basin occurred as early as 1592, with the Bandeira of Sebastião Marinho (Larousse 1977). 6 The Bandeiras had been exploring the Central Plateau since the late sixteenth century. One of the most well-known bandeirantes was Bartolomeu Bueno da Silva, the Anhangüera, notorious for capturing massive numbers of Indians slaves in the inlands, in the second half of the seventeenth century. He was the father of the second Anhangüera, the gold-seeker.

10
bandeirante Paschoal Paes de Araújo departed from the head of the Tocantins in search of Indian slaves. He navigated the Tocantins up to 4° latitude south and successfully captured the Guarajú (Ribeiro da Silva 1932).
It was not until the gold mining period that the full courses of the Araguaia and the Tocantins became better known to the newcomers, however. Perhaps the first members of the colonial enterprise to ever navigate the full courses of the rivers were African slaves who managed to escape from the gold mines in the south and the plantation fields in the north. Such parties eventually founded the quilombo7 of Pederneiras at the upper course of the Tocantins. The fluvial route soon became familiar to gold smugglers as well, who thus avoided paying taxes to the São Paulo administration. In addition, the finding of an ever-increasing number of gold deposits provoked the competition between northern and southern colonial forces for control over the mining district; these political factions also used the fluvial route in attempts at establishing their domain over the territory (Nimuendajú 1983; Birmingham 1993; A. Oliveira 1994).
Familiarity with the fluvial route and territory governance did not come easily for the colonialists, for they had to face the resistance of the many autochthonous populations of the region. That, added to the problems of runaway slaves and contraband, were key
7 Quilombos are communities formed originally by slaves who fled from the plantations or other work sites. Several of these communities have remained , specially in the eastern and northern regions of the country, and constitute part of contemporary Brazilian society (see the Maps page of the Instituto Socioambiental website at www.socioambiental.org).

11
factors for the establishment of military posts and colonialist settlements along the courses of Araguaia and the Tocantins (A. Oliveira 1994).
In 1748, the mining district acquired the status of Capitania Geral de Goyaz thus becoming administratively independent from São Paulo. The need for executive autonomy was a consequence of the district’s economic and population growth. By that time, a newly formed local population was emerging, resulting from the offspring of European men with African and Native women, since European women were not to be found in the “sertões” (Larousse 1977).
With the decline of gold-mining productivity in the second half of the eighteenth century, subsistence agriculture and cattle farming gave new character to the region. The importance of fluvial navigation for commercial purposes became highlighted and, in the following years, both Goyaz and Grão-Pará organized expeditions in order to assess the conditions for the fluvial transportation of goods (A. Oliveira 1994).
1.2.1. Contact The first recorded contact between the Apinajé and the colonialist forces was in 1740. Captain-General D. Luiz Mascarenhas was in charge of an operational expedition along the course of the Tocantins against contraband and slave flight. There he encountered the “Pinarés,” later described by him as “powerful and war-like” (Taunay 1950: 209-10; A. Oliveira 1994).8
8 Nimuendajú (1983:1) notes that nearly a century earlier, in 1658, Friar Manoel Nunes led an expedition starting from the mouth of the Tocantins that extended well into Apinajé country; however, Nunes makes no mention of the Apinajés in his reports.

12
The second recorded contact between the colonialists and the Apinajé occurred during the recession that followed from the gold crisis. An expedition for the assessment of commercial hauling through the Tocantins departed from Goyaz in 1774, under the command of Antônio Luiz Tavares Lisboa. At the Três Barras rapids, the explorers found themselves surrounded by an impressive number of Apinajé warriors – possibly the Cocojoire, considering the location (map 3). Lisboa (1774:890) notes that they “looked like organized regiments” at both margins of the river. The crew were attacked with arrows but managed to escape by dispersing the crowd with gunshots. The next day, warriors on land and in canoes chased them out of the area.
In 1783 the governor of Grão-Pará appointed Thomaz de Souza Villa Real to verify the prospects of fluvial connection between the Araguaia and the Tocantins through the Vermelho river (map 2). The expedition departed from Grão-Pará in 1791 following the course of the Tocantins, and continued on its mission through the Araguaia in the following year. Aware of the Apinajé presence in that area, the commander recruited Karajá escorts to join the crew (Villa Real 1891 [1783]; Nimuendajú 1983; A. Oliveira 1994).
Villa Real was the first explorer who attempted to establish the limits of Apinajé country. He points out, crucially, that Apinajé groups inhabited the inlands at both margins of the Araguaia at the time, probably a reference to the Rõrkojoire. Impressed by the industriousness of the people and the abundance of their crops, Villa Real realized that it would be to the best interest of the Capitania to stay on good terms with such

13
diligent people,9 who could then provide commercial expeditions with shelter and food during their extended journeys along the Araguaia and the Tocantins (Nimuendajú 1983:2).
The economic importance of the commercial enterprise justified further attempts to establish military bases in the region. In previous decades, the colonialist military campaign had been of little success due to the reaction of native populations. Among them, the Apinajé were well known for their resistance against the colonialist occupation. In 1779, the quilombo of Pederneiras was converted into a colonialist village that was dissolved a few years later due to frequent incursions by the Apinajé. In response to the hostilities, the military post of Alcobaça was established a few miles north of Pederneiras, in 1780, and the post of Arapary was created in 1791. Neither military facility lasted very long; thus in 1797 the Grão-Pará administration joined the resources of the two abandoned posts to create the fortress of São João das Duas Barras, which was also intended as shelter for commercial expeditions.
The presence of colonialists was apparently taken with moderate tolerance by the Apinajé that time around, until soldiers from the regiment were caught vandalizing their crops a few years later. The soldiers were killed. The regiment retaliated using heavy artillery to destroy one of the Apinajé villages. The Apinajé counter-attacked, with help from the women, killing most of the regiment (Pohl 1932 [1819]; Nimuendajú 1983:4).
Due to such confrontations, commercial endeavors along the Araguaia and the Tocantins were postponed until decades later.
9 That the Apinajé were hard working was also indicated by their frequent incursions against colonialists of

14
1.2.2. Socio-economic repercussions of intensified contact At the turn of the century, extensive cattle farming and the extraction of babaçú palm oil represented new economic prospects for the north of Goyaz. The ranching endeavor extended from the fertile lands of Bahia, in the northeast, to Piauí, up north, and well into the west, reaching the fields of Maranhão and the margins of the Tocantins river. The exploitation of babaçú (Orbignia speciosa) palm trees was common at various sites in the northern cerrado lands. Babaçú oil was not a relevant item for international trade, hence it only involved small groups of people, often nuclear families – in contrast to the massive contingents employed in the exploitation of latex and Brazil nuts in the Amazon.
With the success of both economic activities during the first quarter of the nineteenth century, migration into the area resumed and various colonial villages were founded. But because these activities required only a small work force, the nonindigenous presence in the area was not overwhelming to the Apinajé. The contact led to the inevitable involvement of the Apinajé with non-indigenous society: they established neighborly relations with the newcomers and eventually started participating in the local and national political settings, taking sides in disputes between local political authorities and even aiding in the expulsion of the Portuguese with the declaration of Brazilian Independence in 1822 (Nimuendajú 1983; A. Oliveira 1994).
The nineteenth century thus marks the beginning of intensified contact between the Apinajé and the national society and the progressive occupation of Apinajé territory,
Pederneiras in order to snatch their work tools (Nimuendajú 1983: 2).

15
which continued in the first half of the twentieth century. Despite its generally nonconflictive nature, the contact would prove detrimental to the Apinajé, as reflected in major population reduction, followed by complete disregard for their land rights on the part of well-established farmers.
The village of Santo Antônio das Três Barras was created as early as 1816 within Apinajé territory, especially close to one of the Apinajé villages. The proximity was such that some authors described the community as consisting of a majority of Apinajé people (120 to 150) and some (81) whites (Nimuendajú 1983:4). In 1817, an epidemic of smallpox caused the death of a number of Apinajés, who were still considered the most numerous people in the area despite interethnic conflicts, epidemics, and wars. At the time, the Apinajé population was estimated at around 4,200 individuals, distributed in four localities: Bom Jardim, Santo Antônio, Santo Antônio das Três Barras, and Araguaia (Nimuendajú 1983:5).
Santo Antônio das Três Barras was eventually incorporated to the village of São Pedro de Alcântara, on the other bank of the Tocantins river, and both evolved into present-day Carolina (map 4). After the dissolution of Santo Antônio, the village of Boa Vista was created and soon became the most important locus of interaction between the Apinajé and the national society. Boa Vista, which gave way to present-day Tocantinópolis, was founded in 1818 (map 4).10
In the mid-nineteenth century, the commercial importance of the fluvial routes became highlighted again, with leather being one of the most significant items for

16
commercial trade. Large numbers of Apinajés were employed as crewmembers on commercial ships, until a cholera epidemic advancing from Grão-Pará discouraged them from participating in the activity. By 1859, the Apinajé population had decreased by about fifty percent, to around 1,800 to 2,000 individuals (Nimuendajú 1983:6; A. Oliveira 1994).
Between 1862 and 1864, there was considerable improvement in infrastructural conditions both for production and transportation of goods. Goyaz, with the status of Província since the declaration of Brazilian Independence in 1822, implemented fluvial connections with São Paulo, Mato Grosso and Pará thus inaugurating steam boat navigation in the region. Roads and schools were built and the province began exporting grains. The first factories were established in 1870 and, in 1872, the census of Goiáz indicated 160,395 inhabitants. The population was already predominantly mixed, living in rural areas (Larousse 1977).
By the end of century, the territory of the Apinajé was being systematically occupied by small farmers, merchants and others, as they dramatically decreased in number. In 1882, the reported number of Apinajés was 1,362.
Local political conflicts in the Tocantinópolis area culminated in civil war during the period from 1892 to 1894; the result was considerable impoverishment and population reduction overall. Coudreaux (1897:209) estimated the total Apinajé population at 400 individuals in 1897 – less than ten percent of the original number – distributed in three villages; and by 1899, that number had decreased to 150 individuals
10 The town of Tocantinópolis was founded in 1840.

17
(Buscalioni 1901:25). The Apinajé population was thus reduced to less than 4% in a time frame of 83 years (between 1816 and 1899). In contrast, the non-Indian population of the province had increased to 255,284 inhabitants by 1900.
The Apinajé entered the twentieth century as a minority amidst the flourishing of the State of Goiás, established upon the proclamation of the Brazilian Republic in 1888. In 1909, the north, taking advantage of the distance from the central administration and the proximity with the Sates of Maranhão, Pará, Bahia and Piauí – incidentally, Jê Timbira territory –, resumed its separatist movements but with little success.
In face of intensified land disputes, in 1927, Chief José Dias Mãtyk took a trip to Rio de Janeiro representing the interests of the Krijobreire Apinajé of Bacaba. Mãtyk sought a solution on the part of the President – since he had not received proper attention from the State government – for whatever regarded the land rights of the Apinajé. Unfortunately, he fell ill in São Paulo and, unable to conclude his original plan, Mãtyk returned to the village. He did claim assistance from the SPI (Serviço de Proteção ao Índio), nevertheless.
Meanwhile pressure on Bacaba increased. Non-Indian presence proliferated in the area and local farmers spread the rumor that Chief Mãtyk had died on his way to Rio. The Krijobreire, left without its Chief and its land, was under pressure to disperse. But Chief Mãtyk returned to reunite the community before the dispersion took place.
Between the years 1928 and 1937, Curt Nimuendajú visited with the Apinajé on various occasions, and reported on the survival conditions of the people:

18
In 1928 I crossed the State of Maranhão and arrived at the Tocantins, where I spent two months with the Apinajé, visiting their four small villages and making my acquaintance with all. I also calculated their number at a total of 150. The economic and social decay of the tribe was manifest (...). In 1930 I spent one week with them, and two months in 1931. When I paid them another visit in 1932, staying for six weeks, I noticed another moral and economic relapse as a consequence of an epidemic of fevers, which left few hopes for the future. For that reason, it was with great satisfaction that, upon my return in 1937, I could observe that despite a smallpox epidemic in the previous year, the Apinajé people were recovering their strength and that their number had even increased to 160 individuals. In that year, I stayed with them for two months. (Nimuendajú 1983:6; translation mine).
By 1940, the non-Indian population of the State counted 826,414 inhabitants distributed
in 33 counties. Goiânia, the freshly built capital city of the State, was inaugurated in
1942.
1.2.3. Land rights and national development
An assistance post of the Serviço de Proteção ao Índio (the national bureau for
indigenous affairs at the time) was installed in Bacaba in 1944, conferring great political
importance to that village. This was the first governmental presence to address the land
rights situation in Apinajé territory – a much belated result of Chief Mãtyk’s initiative
seventeen years earlier. However, no definite solutions were imposed and, unable to stop
the invasion of the land, the SPI adopted a system of leasing as a palliative measure: non-
Indians were supposed to pay the Apinajé for use of the land. Due to the inefficient

19
management of the SPI, however, lease payment fell into oblivion and, by the 1950’s, former land leasers started selling their “land rights” to other sectors of the Tocantinópolis community. This practice set up the conditions for significant land rights disputes between the Apinajé and the counties of Tocantinópolis and Nazaré, later on.
The 1950’s were a decade of major transformations in the infrastructural and political makeup of Brazil. During the electoral campaign of 1955, future president Juscelino Kubistchek advocated the transference of the federal administration from Rio de Janeiro to the Central Plateau. In 1956, governor Pedro Ludovico Teixeira signed part of the Goiás territory over to the federal administration for the construction of Brasília, the new capital city of Brazil, inaugurated in 1960. This shift in the administrative life of the country propelled a new immigration wave to the interior. The population of Goiás increased to 1,954,862 and, by 1967, the number of counties in the State amounted to 222, with agriculture and extensive cattle farming at the heart of the regional economy (Larousse 1977).
The Apinajé population, which had reached a period of demographic stability in the 1940’s, enjoyed considerable demographic improvement starting in the second half of the century. In 1967, the total number was estimated at 253 people (Da Matta 1967).
Many governmental programs for national development were launched during the Brazilian military regime (1964-1984). Among them, those that claimed to promote the “development” of the Cerrado and the Amazon – environmental factors ignored – had an immediate impact on the life of the Apinajé.

20
Topography added to technological improvements made the Central Plateau an ideal region for cattle farming and agriculture, and therefore very attractive economically. Goiás was the largest-growing State in the country in the 1970’s, with a population of 2,997,570. The productivity of the agricultural industry fed the textile and food industries as well, thus expanding the regional economy (Larousse 1977).
The construction of the Transamazon Roadway was a landmark of the military regime. The project for this (unfinished) 5,600 kilometer long roadway, meant to connect the Brazilian northeast to the Amazon and thus promote the occupation of the rainforest, was launched by President Gen. Garrastazu Médici in 1970. The first segment of the road, inaugurated in 1972, was built inside Apinajé territory, in fact, crossing the village of São José (Krijobreire). By that time, the estimated number of Apinajés had increased to a total of 364 (Waller 1976).
In 1978, Gen. Lamarth de Araújo, president of FUNAI (formerly SPI), issued a document that established the official Apinajé area at 85,800 hectares, having the roadway as one of its limits. The proposed area excluded the Rõrkojoire territory and cut off part of the Krijobreire territory. For that reason, the decision was rejected by the Apinajé, who interrupted the demarcation process, thus triggering the reaction of local, well-established farmers.
The administrator of the local FUNAI post, partial to the farmers, pressed the Apinajé community to sign the document, arguing that the Apinajé could not “go against a determination of the President of Brazil.” The document was then signed. Fortunately

21
for the Apinajé, FUNAI discontinued that local office and transferred its businesses to the FUNAI unit of Araguaína, where the principal administrator noted the disadvantages the terms of the document brought to the Apinajé. The document was then nullified, and a counterproposal was offered for the demarcation of Apinajé territory that included the land beyond the limits imposed by the Transamazônica roadway (Ladeira 1983).
The Apinajé had their official territory (141,904 hectares) recognized by the federal government in 1985. The Apinajé population consisted of 565 individuals then (Ladeira and Azanha 2003). In that same year, the north of Goiás achieved its lifelong goal of becoming administratively independent from the south, thus developing into the State of Tocantins. Brazilian society in general began restructuring with the end of the military regime and, in 1988, the new Constitution of Brazil was issued. The Constitution of 1988 represented a considerable advance in the Brazilian policy for indigenous affairs. It recognized and protected the rights of autochthonous populations to their traditional cultures, languages, religions and land use.
By the 1990’s there was considerable increase in Apinajé population numbers. Data from the Centro de Trabalho Indigenista (CTI) indicate a population of 780 in 1993 11, and in 1997 data from FUNAI indicate an official number of 1,025 Apinajé individuals. Finally, FUNASA data indicate the official number of Apinajés at 1,262 in 2003. This population growth represents an average of ten percent per year, which is more than the average for the Brazilian population in general (Ladeira and Azanha 2003).
11 A. Oliveira (1994:2, 6) estimates a smaller number, 600 people in 1994; however, as he points out, that the census was incomplete as a result of the latent interethnic animosity related to land rights issues during the period in which the survey was conducted.

22
1.3. Apinajé society in the twenty-first century Currently, there are thirteen Apinajé villages, with São José (formerly Bacaba; Krijobreire leadership) and Mariazinha (Cocojoire leadership) being the largest and oldest ones, and the smaller villages having been derived from either one or the other.12 Thus, the villages of Cocalinho, Patizal, Buriti Comprido, Palmeiras, Prata, Cocal Grande and Serrinha have been founded by former members of the São José community, whereas Botica, Riachinho, Bonito and Brejão were founded by former dwellers of Mariazinha.
Except for the most recent settlements, namely, Brejão, Cocal Grande, Palmeiras, Prata, and Serrinha, all villages include a medical assistance facility provided by FUNASA, where a (non-Indian) staff person assists community members full time during weekdays. In order to receive routine medical assistance of this kind, dwellers of the younger settlements must take a trip to the nearest Apinajé village. As a complement to this more basic health service, a physician visits the villages every two weeks in order to provide more detailed medical examination. Patients suffering from serious illnesses are sent to urban centers for medical attention.
Another initiative taken by FUNASA has been the implementation of infrastructural conditions for water treatment as a preventive measure against the proliferation
12 The Rõrkojoire abandoned their villages at the Araguaia in the first half of the twentieth century. The village of São Paulo, at the margins of the Araguaia, was abandoned in 1920; the Apinajé were uneasy with the proximity with the Kayapó, and moved south to reunite with the Rõrkojoire of São Martinho. That village, in turn, existed until 1943, when an epidemic of fevers nearly decimated the population. Chief Mãtyk and the Krijobreire rescued the survivors, taking them to Bacaba. Some of the Rõrkojoire remained with the Krijobreire (Bacaba/São José) and others joined the Cocojoire (Mariazinha).

23
of parasitic and endemic tropical diseases. Treated water, supplied by artesian wells, is available in most villages, except for those founded in or after the year 2000 (i.e. Brejão, Buriti Comprido, Cocal Grande, Palmeiras, Prata, and Serrinha).
Electricity is available in São José, Mariazinha, Bonito, Botica, Cocalinho, Patizal, Prata, and Riachinho. This infra-structural benefit is provided for the most part by the county administration through the Mayor Office of Tocantinópolis, which is the nearest town and non-Indian administrative center. However, electricity in the villages of Cocalinho and Prata has been provided alternatively by the CTI, a non-governmental organization;13 in both villages, electricity is supplied by generators. The remaining, younger villages of Brejão, Buriti Comprido, Cocal Grande, Palmeiras, and Serrinha, do not have access to this benefit yet.
1.4. Language contact situation According to one speaker’s testimony, few Apinajé communities lease their land to small farmers nowadays. The communities of São José, Patizal and Palmeiras, for instance, no longer allow the presence of non-Indian workers on the land; it remains a common practice only in the villages of Mariazinha, Botica and Riachinho. Integration with the non-Indian population appears to be most systematic in the latter communities.
The same speaker estimates that half the population of Riachinho consists of nonIndians due to interethnic marriage; a large number of non-Indians appears to inhabit
13 The Centro de Trabalho Indigenista is an NGO that develops a variety of projects alongside indigenous communities all over the country; at the Bico do Papagaio region, in particular, they have worked more closely with the Apinajé and Timbira groups.

24
Mariazinha as well. He speculates that the high frequency of interethnic marriage in these villages must be due to the lack of eligible Apinajé partners, a speculation that may be justified by restrictions internal to the Apinajé marriage system. As a consequence of this integration, there seems to be an incipient effect on the use of Apinajé in those villages, such that Portuguese is beginning to conquer a greater space in those speaker communities.
In São José and other villages deriving from it, on the other hand, I have noted that the Apinajé language enjoys good health. It is the first language learned by young children, and the speaking community does not at all favor Portuguese in everyday use (despite their systematic exposure to Portuguese through radio, television and other media). Portuguese is used exclusively in interactions with Portuguese-speaking visitors.
Generally, adult Apinajé speakers have good knowledge of Portuguese and are prepared to use it whenever necessary. Although I have not met any adult monolingual Apinajé speakers in São José or Patizal, neither have I met any Apinajé individuals who cannot speak the native language.
From what I could observe, some elderly people, especially women, have very poor command of Portuguese, and children tend to stay monolingual in Apinajé until around the age of twelve. The young Apinajé start learning Portuguese systematically in the school environment, especially at around fourth grade, when the bilingual education system is adopted. Before that stage, monolingual education in Apinajé is applied.
1.5. The school system

25
The Constitution of 1988 guarantees the right of all autochthonous populations to differentiated, bilingual education. This recent development has resulted in more systematic governmental support for indigenous schools in Brazil, at least in regard to their infrastructural conditions.
School buildings exist in all Apinajé villages, except the youngest ones, which are still in the process of structuring themselves (namely, Brejão, Cocal Grande and Serrinha).14 The core of infrastructural conditions for the Apinajé school system is provided by the State of Tocantins, following the legislation enforced by the Brazilian Ministry of Education (MEC). Instructors, books, supplies, and food for the school community are all provided by the State.
The first initiatives in the production of didactic materials for the Apinajé were taken by missionaries of the Summer Institute of Linguistics. Missionary Patricia Ham was responsible for the elaboration of the Apinajé orthography in the 1960’s. That orthography is still currently in use. She also elaborated school books for Apinajé language teaching and helped organize various books of reading in Apinajé (many Apinajé individuals were involved in the latter project).
Other, not as fruitful, initiatives were taken by the University of Goiás and the University of Tocantins, in the early eighties and late nineties, respectively. On these occasions, a few reading books were also produced for Apinajé schools. In addition,
14 Dwellers of younger settlements must commute to the nearest Apinajé school in order to pursue their studies.

26
non-governmental organizations such as CTI have contributed to the development the Jê school system.
Apinajé schools are administered internally by members of the Apinajé community. The staff includes both Apinajé and non-Indian instructors and assistants.
2. The Apinajé language Although the term “Apinajé” and its variants15 have been employed in the literature to refer to the people and their language, the origin of the term is not known. It is likely that it was first used by outsiders, since the Apinajé themselves use the term paْi to refer to their own community, and the expression paْi kaper, to refer to their language. However, when speaking in Portuguese of themselves or their language, they occasionally employ the term Apinajé (or Pinajé [pina⎆zϯ]), as they have grown accustomed to its use in interethnic relations.
Other denominations found in reports from previous centuries include Afotigés, Uhitische, Utonsché, Otogé, and Aogé (Villa Real 1891 [1793], Pohl 1932, Marques 1870, Mattos 1875, cited in Nimuendajú 1983). Curt Nimuendajú suggests that the latter terms derive from the word ôd, ôdo ‘tip; corner’, and points out that the variants Hôti and Ahôtiyê used to be employed by the Eastern Timbira to refer to the Apinajé. He further speculates that the terms may have been a reference to the corner formed at the
15 This word is also spelled as “Apinayé” in the literature, as first introduced by Curt Nimuendajú. Variants of the term are Pinarés, Pinajés and Oupinagees.

27
confluence of the Tocantins and Araguaia Rivers in the north,16 traditional Apinajé territory (Nimuendajú 1983).17
2.1. Genetic affiliation Apinajé is classified as a Northern Jê language, along with Panará, Suyá, Kayapó, and Timbira. Other branches of the family are Central Jê, which includes the Akwe languages (Xavante and Xerente) and Southern Jê, consisting of Kaingáng and Xokléng. Most Jê languages are spoken in cerrado areas, with the exception of Kayapó and Suyá, spoken in rainforest areas (see e.g. Rodrigues 1986; 1999).
A brief examination of data from Apinajé, Suyá, Kayapó and Timbira may reveal the many differences (e.g. prenasalized stops, nominative case-marking in independent clauses) and similarities (e.g. simple morphology, SOV word order, ergative marking in subordinate clauses) existing among them. Panará, on the other hand, is dramatically distinct from the other languages of the branch. It displays a more polysynthetic morphological typology, with agent, patient and tense/aspect/modality (TAM) marking on the verb; ergative marking in independent clauses and SVO word order, among other things.18
16 The area is known in Brazil as “Bico do Papagaio” (‘the parrot’s beak’). 17 In an interview on this subject, an Apinajé speaker declared his total lack of familiarity with the latter terms. Most interesting in this case would be to check on the word for ‘tip, corner’ in any of the Timbira languages. 18 Data examined are from Alves (2002), Timbira Apanjekrá; Reis Silva (2003) and Salanova (2001), Mebengokre Kayapó; Santos (2004), Suyá; and Dourado (2001), Panará.

28
The Apinajé are considered, in the anthropological literature, a Western division of the Timbira, living west of the Tocantins. Eastern Timbira peoples are those distributed at various locations in the States of Maranhão and Tocantins, east of the river (Nimuendajú 1983; Da Matta 1982). In linguistic classifications, on the other hand, it is not uncommon for an Apinajé-Kayapó grouping to be contrasted with the Timbira dialectal cluster (Davis 1966; 1968). Be that as it may, the conclusion in both fields is that the Apinajé constitute an autonomous group and language, distinct from both Kayapó and Timbira.
2.2. Documentational material and previous studies The first records of the Apinajé language were short lists of words and clauses. The first known record was a 38-word list collected by a military man in São João das Duas Barras in the nineteenth century. The list, which according to Curt Nimuendajú’s assessment was poorly transcribed and contained some mistakes, was published in Castelnau (1844: 1850-51); in the same publication, Castelnau includes a list of 177 words collected by himself. Leal (1895: 125-29) reproduces Castelnau’s list with Portuguese orthography. Sampaio (1911) inadvertently collected 206 words and phrases in Apinajé, believing he was interviewing Krahô speakers. Snethlage (1926:187 ff.) includes 337 words and phrases, and Oliveira (1930) includes Apinajé data collected by the author in 1926 (Nimuendajú 1983:7).
Analyses of Apinajé language data were first produced in the sixties, when missionaries of the Summer Institute of Linguistics started linguistic work with the

29
ultimate goal of Bible translation. Most of that work followed the phonemic and tagmemic frameworks (Stout 1960; Ham 1961, 1962, 1965, 1967; Burgess and Ham 1968), with the exception of Callow (1962), which was grounded in Prosodic Theory. In contrast, work published in the seventies, such as Koopman (1976), Waller (1976) Ham, Waller and Koopman (1979), presented the data in a more descriptive – and user-friendly – manner.
More recent studies and publications on the language include Oliveira (1998, 2003) and Salanova (2001).
3. Methodological considerations and fieldwork conditions The present dissertation is deliberately a descriptive study. It has a functional and typological orientation, and includes some diachronic hypotheses for the interpretation of certain blurry domains. It is meant to serve as a useful source for readers interested in learning about the Apinajé language, researchers interested in typological studies, and linguists engaged in the study of Macro-Jê languages, especially in historicalcomparative studies for the reconstruction of Proto-Jê. For these reasons, I have deliberately avoided formal approaches to language, which sometimes obscure the explanation of the data and usually tend to become rapidly outdated.
In the remainder of this section, I comment on fieldwork conditions and on methodological strategies for data collection that I have applied during my research.
My initial interviews with Apinajé speakers occurred in Goiânia, Goiás State. I met Amci Creuza de Souza Fernandes and Dioro Aparecida Laranja in the second half of

30
1995. Dioro had brought her son to Goiânia for medical attention and they were staying at the Casa do Índio, a hostel unit provided by FUNAI for patients and their caregivers.
I had heard about Dioro’s party through the staff of the local FUNAI office, so I proceeded to visit with them at the Casa do Índio. We eventually made arrangements for a recorded interview at the Setor de Etnolingüística of the Museu Antropológico (University of Goiás) to take place a few days later. In that interview and others that followed we recorded word lists and short texts, which I used for preliminary phonological and grammatical analysis. Those meetings occurred in October 1995.
Two weeks later Amci and Dioro received me at the village of São José for a six week fieldwork session. I decided from the outset to work most directly with the women. I accompanied them in their daily tasks such that we had plenty to talk about during recording and interview sessions. I collected most personal experience narratives in that way. For a beginner in the study of the language, having been present at the events narrated allowed me to capture the semantic nuances of certain utterances more promptly than I would have otherwise.
My main consultants turned out to be Amci (Dirѐ) and Irϯ Rita Dias Laranja, who was introduced to me by Amci herself. Other major consultants I met in that first session were Kojkoti Iraci Dias (Dѐkrϯ) and Grϯri Júlia Estêvão (Dada, my adoptive mother), the daughter of late Velho Estêvão, former Chief of São José.
Besides contributing personal experience narratives to the database, Dѐkrϯ took it upon herself to teach me how to do things properly while in Apinajé country (see Text II,

31
Appendix B). Grϯri contributed a significant part of the traditional narratives in my database over the years. From her storytelling comes the version of the Apinajé creation myth found in Appendix B (Text I). Another version of the myth, as well as other traditional stories were provided by GrϯБo Júlia Corredor; recording sessions with GrϯБo started in 1999.
The interviews I conducted with male speakers were usually mediated by Amci and Irϯ, although in certain cases I made the arrangements with the speakers myself. That was the case with Daniel Laranja Rodrigues (Kiki), who contributed a procedural narrative as well as elicited data. Vaْme Miguel Fernandes provided a number of traditional stories, and Bogo Moisés Dias Roxo (Velho Moisés) contributed valuable information on animals, plants, and traditional weapons and crafts, which was used in the lexicographical project. Interviews with Vaْme started in 1997, and those with Bogo occurred in 2000.
In 2004, I also conducted interviews with a male speaker, who wishes to remain anonymous, about general information on the villages and the Apinajé school system; he also aided me in some follow up work on the phonology of the language.
The transcription and translation of most narratives were done with the assistance of Amci and Irϯ. They also contributed some texts of their own (testimonies and instructional narratives – see Text III, Appendix B) and the bulk of the elicited material

32
found in the database.19 Although these women are illiterate, their keen linguistic awareness and passionate interest in their native language and culture proved essential for the development of the project.
Besides the main consultants introduced above, other speakers — men, women, and children — contributed to the database either through scheduled interviews, informal conversations or in a more passive manner, as I took linguistic notes on the way they spoke with one another.
The database consists of about ten hours of recorded material and various books of elicited data. It includes some additional three hours of songs in Krikatí recorded live at the BҶrkape festival that took place in São José in mid 2000;20 those songs are permeated with conversations and ceremonial forms of speech in Apinajé. It was on that same occasion that I recorded a personal experience narrative by Irϯptsi Maria Barbosa,
Amci’s mother, who passed away in 2002. About six and a half hours of the recorded texts have been transcribed and
analyzed, with their transcriptions and analyses having undergone at least one round of revisions. The remainder of the recordings has not been transcribed yet.
Between 1995 and 2000, I worked with speakers in and out of the field, although I spent more time conducting my research in the indigenous land itself. The time I spent
19 Kojkoti (Dѐkrϯ) assisted in a few transcription sessions as well. 20 The festival celebrated the end of the mourning period for the passing of a certain Apinajé man. The Krikati singers had been specially invited for the occasion; I had the privilege of being recruited by the Apinajé organizers to document the event.

33
working with speakers out of the field probably adds up to some twenty days. On the other hand, I made four trips to the Apinajé area, staying in the field for a total of fourteen months. The main loci of my field research were the villages of São José and Patizal. It was not until 1999 that I had the opportunity to visit the remainder of the villages distributed in the reservation (a total of eight, at the time). I was accompanying a crew from FUNASA who had to visit all the villages on that same day. For me, the trip served better as a first pass to the locations of each village than as a suitable occasion for collecting reliable linguistic information. Other trips to those areas are still necessary before I am able to provide first-hand information on the sociolinguistic aspects of each village or on any linguistic variation among the Apinajé communities. For that reason, I will not speak of dialectal variations of Apinajé in this dissertation.
4. Transcription and other conventions used in the dissertation In Chapter II – Phonology, I will use symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet for the introduction of phonemes of the language and the transcription of the data in the illustrative examples.
Starting in Chapter III – Morphology, the transcription conventions employed in the remainder of the dissertation assumes, with the segmental analysis proposed, that prenasal consonants are part of the phoneme inventory of the language; therefore they are represented as such. Because each of the phonemes in question requires the use of two or more symbols for its representation, a different set of symbols is adopted for the sake of economy. Thus, the prenasal consonants /mb, nd, ْdЋ/ are represented thereafter as b, d,

34
j. Also for the sake of simplicity, the velar nasal consonant /֊/ is represented as g; the alveopalatal affricate /tЀ/ as c; and the alveolar flap /‫ש‬/ as r.
Another convention employed in this dissertation is that, for cross-referencing to sections belonging to a different chapter, I will include the number of the relevant chapter immediately before the section number, as in V.1.2, for “section 1.2 of chapter V”.

CHAPTER II
PHONOLOGY
0. Introduction The present chapter deals with the sound system of Apinajé. A phonetic description of contrastive segments and their respective variants is given in section 1; syllable patterns and phonotactic constraints are introduced in section 2; the stress system is discussed in section 3; and phonological rules are presented in section 4. Section 5 is a summary of relevant criteria for the definition of phonological word in Apinajé.
The analysis proposed here is based on perceptual and articulatory data; an acoustic survey is beyond the scope of this study.1 The corpus under analysis consists of elicited and spontaneous material, and data collected through observation of interactions among speakers (see I.3 above). It is important to note that the generalizations proposed here regard not only the phonology of the speech community in general, but also some mannerisms observed in the speech of some individuals. For the time being, such mannerisms are being treated simply as idiolects, but they may be indicators of more systematic, dialectal variations within the speech community. Since my research was
1 The data were recorded in analogue and digital media, at different times. The recording equipment used included a Marantz PMD 420 portable deck recorder, a Sony Professional WM-D6C walkman recorder, a Sony TCD-D 100 DAT walkman recorder, and a Sony ECM 959 external microphone. The fact that part of the corpus has been recorded in digital format will allow for eventual acoustic analysis of the data.

36
carried out in only two of the eight Apinajé villages existing at the time of field work, I will say nothing further about dialects of Apinajé in this dissertation.
1. Phonemic system According to my analysis, the phonemic inventory of Apinajé consists of seventeen consonants and seventeen vowels. The consonant system includes plain and prenasalized stops and affricates; fricatives, nasals, glides, and a flap. The vowel system consists of nasal and oral phonemes, including front, central, and back; high, mid and low vowels.
In an earlier treatment of the Apinajé phonemic system, Ham (1961) proposes an inventory of twelve consonants2 and seventeen vowels. Ham’s interpretation is quite accurate and coincides with my own for the most part. However, a point of divergence between the two analyses regards the status of prenasalized consonants. Ham analyzes them as allophones of nasal phonemes occurring before oral vowels. While this hypothesis appears to be correct at first, my data show that this is not exactly the case, since minimal pairs can be found that illustrate the contrast between nasal and prenasalized segments.
My own observations have been independently reinforced by the opinion of a native instructor from São José. According to that speaker, the interpretation of prenasalized stops as allophones has also had a problematic effect in the orthographic
2 /p, t, tЀ, k, Б, m, n, ْ, ֊, v, r, z/. Ham (1961) excludes the prenasalized and fricative phonemes /mb, nd, ْdЋ, s, f/ proposed here.

37
system of the language: learners are sometimes unable to identify the words they are reading because the relevant contrast is not properly expressed in writing.
Next, I illustrate the contrasts amongst Apinajé phonemes and give details about allophonic variations motivated by factors such as phonetic context and speech rate, as well as those cases of allophony which do not result from any apparent motivation – the so-called “free variation”.
1.1. Consonant phonemes In Apinajé, sonorant phonemes are voiced and obstruent phonemes are voiceless, with the exception of the prenasalized phonemes, which are fully voiced. The motivation for the predominant voiced character of prenasalized segments in the system is presumably the fact that these complex sounds consist of a nasal contour, and nasals in Apinajé are always voiced.
The consonant phoneme inventory of Apinajé is presented in table II.1. (Symbols used are from the International Phonetic Alphabet, following the orientation given in Pullum and Ladusaw (1986)).

The consonant phonemes of Apinajé are grouped here into three major classes. The class of plosives comprises stops and affricates (section 1.1.1.); the continuants include fricatives and nasals (section 1.1.2); and the approximants are the flap and glides (section 1.1.3). The contrast amongst Apinajé phonemes is illustrated in examples (1-7) (where “x” stands for “contrasted to”).

3 Although it is natural for vowels to become somewhat nasalized in the context of nasal consonants, I have not been able to perceive any degree of nasalization of oral vowel phonemes in this phonetic environment, reason why no nasalization is indicated in the phonetic transcription of such examples. The phonetic nasalization of oral vowels in nasal environments can certainly be captured in an acoustic analysis of the data; the results could then be compared to the quality of oral and nasal vowel phonemes in other

1.1.1. Plosive phonemes As a general rule, Apinajé plosives have voiced and voiceless allophones, with the voiceless counterparts appearing at the onset of stressed syllables, and the voiced ones occurring in more marginal positions, such as non-stressed syllables and coda position. Although this is the most frequent distributional pattern, it is possible on occasion to find alternation between voiced and voiceless allophones in less prominent positions as well. The conditions for the distribution of each phoneme’s variants are presented next.
Oral Stops. Apinajé stops are plain, unaspirated segments, generally produced in the very place of articulation by which the phoneme is described. (Prenasal phonemes, which

44
are obviously a phonetic combination of nasal and oral properties, and which comprise stops and one affricate, are not included here; they are discussed in a separate subsection, instead.) All stops may occupy syllable onset or coda (section 2), and may occur in initial, medial or final position in the word.
The bilabial stop /p/ is realized by the allophones [p] and [b]. The voiceless allophone [p] invariably occurs at the onset of stressed syllables (8).

(8) a. /pi/
b. /pok/ c. /p‫ש‬ѐ/ d. /p‫ש‬ek/ e. /kapa/ f. /pϯpϯk/ g. /katp‫ש‬ϯ/ h. /p‫ש‬õp‫ש‬õt/

‘kill’ ‘catch on fire’ ‘cover with leaves’ ‘tall’ ‘pull out; take out’ ‘drip repeatedly on the same spot’ ‘tie’ ‘shiver (of anxiety)’

The voiced and voiceless allophones alternate at syllable coda word finally and at the onset of unstressed syllables, though the voiced counterpart occurs more frequently in these contexts (9-10).

[p‫ש‬e⎆p‫ש‬ek] [b‫ש‬e⎆p‫ש‬ek]

‘plant; banana’ ‘see’ ‘quickly’

Word medially, the alternation between [p] and [b] in syllable coda partially depends on the quality of the following segment. The examples in (11) illustrate the occurrence of /p/ at syllable coda followed by a voiceless obstruent; the allophone [p] invariably occurs in this position.

[ap⎆ku] [ap⎆tЀet] [⎅apka⎆ti]

‘eat <INTR>’ ‘peba (armadillo sp.)’ ‘morning; tomorrow’

The data in (12-13), on the other hand, illustrate contexts where there may be a voicing alternation. The allophone [p] is preferred when followed by an obstruent belonging to a distinct lexical base, as shown by the compounds in (12).4 Note that alternations do occur in this context (12.c). When followed by a sonorant segment at morpheme boundary, the voiced allophone is preferred (13).

4 The symbol “=” is used here to indicate the boundary between the elements of a compound. It will also be used throughout the dissertation to indicate a clitic boundary.

‘fish trap’ ‘piabinha (fish sp.)’

In compounds formed with one of the clitics ti ‘AUG’ or ‫ש‬ϯ ‘DIM’, morphemespecific rules will apply; but the voiced allophone [b] is generally preferred in these contexts also (section 4).

‘bat (sp)’

b./ْdЋep=‫ש‬ϯ/

[ْdЋeb⎆‫ש‬ϯ]

‘bat (sp)’

Word finally, a transitional bilabial nasal [m] is inserted between a nasal vowel and /p/ at syllable coda. Notice that the bilabial stop may be realized as either voiced or voiceless, or it may be left unreleased due to its position in the word (15).

47

The alveolar stop /t/ comprises the allophones [t], [t], [֒], their voiced counterparts [d], [d] and [‫]م‬, and the alveolar flap [‫]ש‬. Voiceless allophones invariably occur at the onset of stressed syllables (16).

The voiced and voiceless series of allophones alternate word-finally as well. An additional factor to be considered in this environment is the occurrence of echo-vowels, which is somewhat related to the manner of articulation of the allophones. An echovowel is a reduced vowel inserted after a coda obstruent at word boundary (section 4.5). The phonetic quality of an echo-vowel is reminiscent of that of the vowel at the nucleus.

48
The presence of the echo-vowel favors the occurrence of voiced allophones. Retroflexed allophones [֒, ‫ ]م‬tend to occur in the context of non-coronal vowels6, and the alveolar flap [‫ ]ש‬in the context of coronal vowels (18).7

6 Coronal vowels are those produced in the coronal area, i.e. non-low front vowels. Non-coronal vowels are those produced elsewhere (Lahiri and Evers 1991; Clements 1985).

7 The following example illustrates one instance of the flap allophone in the context of a non-coronal

vowel. Here, the condition for this allophone to occur at syllable coda is presumably the nasality of the

vowel at the nucleus (the flap does not occur in the context of oral /o/, as demonstrated in (18.a)),

associated with the coronal properties of /‫ש‬/ at the onset.

Word-medially, the voiceless alveolar allophone [t] is preferred at syllable coda when followed by a voiceless obstruent (20). The voiced alveolar allophone [d] occurs before a sonorant, as illustrated by the compound in (21.a), compared with that in (21.b).

The velar stop /k/ comprises the allophones [k], [kj] and [g]. The voiceless allophones [k, kj] invariably occupy the onset of stressed syllables, whereas the voiced allophone [g] tends to occur at the onset of unstressed ones (22-23).

The occurrence of /k/ at syllable coda does not seem as frequent word medially when compared with other supralaryngeal stops. The data in (25) are compounds involving the diminutive clitic ‫ש‬ϯ; the allophone [g] is preferred when followed by the sonorant.

The glottal stop phoneme /Б/ occupies stressed syllable onsets, where it contrasts with the presence or absence of other segments (see (7) above). Other occurrences of [Б] are phonetic, particularly observable in careful speech and typically indicative of syllable boundaries involving obstruents.

Affricates. The palatal affricate /tЀ/ comprises the allophones [tЀ, t‫נ‬, dЋ, dѮ], though it is most often realized as alveopalatal [t‫נ‬, dѮ]. It may occupy syllable onset or coda. As with other plosives, voiceless allophones of /tЀ/ occur in stressed syllable onsets and voiced allophones in unstressed syllables (28).

In word medial and final positions, voice alternation is largely determined by the sonorant quality of the environment. In the context of nasals and glides word medially, the voiced allophones [dѮ, dЋ] may even occupy the onset of stressed syllables (29-30).

Word finally, voiced alternants are preferred in sonorant contexts as well. Notice the absence of sonorant consonants in example (31.a) and the presence of the voiceless allophones. Contrast with (31.b), where the word/syllable begins with a prenasalized consonant. The voice properties of the pre-nasal phoneme favor the occurrence of the voiced allophones [dЋ, dѮ]; so does the presence of echo-vowels (31.b-c).

Prenasalized Stops. The labial and coronal prenasal(ized) phonemes /mb, nd, ْdЋ/ are voiced complex segments consisting of homorganic nasal-obstruent contours. Their distribution is restricted to stressed syllable onset, word initially and medially. The prenasal stops contrast with nasal consonants before oral vowels, but they do not contrast before nasal vowels. In addition, there is no contrastive prenasalized velar stop, and the number of contrastive pairs for the series is rather small, amounting to only six or seven pairs in my database.
Under such restrictive conditions, one might be inclined to interpret such pairs merely as “exceptions.” Although this is an easy enough solution, it obscures a view of the problem from a broader, historical-comparative perspective. Many Jê languages display a contrast for obstruents not only in the nasal-oral dimension, but also in the voice-voiceless dimension. These dimensions may have – probably did – interact, historically, resulting in the obstruent inventories found in the languages nowadays. Exceptions such as the ones noted in Apinajé probably constitute important clues for this historical development.
As mentioned before, Ham (1961) considers prenasalized segments as allophones of nasal phonemes. In her analysis, /m, n, ْ/ display the allophones [mb, nd, ْdЋ] before oral vowels, since she does not take into consideration the few existing minimal pairs. As a final result, she concludes that there are just two series of phonemes: oral stops and nasal consonants.

54
The intention here is to propose an analysis alternative to Ham (1961), one that takes into consideration the existing contrastive pairs. I then propose three (not two) series of related phonemes – stops, nasals, and prenasal stops –, noting that the contrast between nasals and prenasal stops is observable only before nasal vowels, as illustrated by the following examples.

One initial hypothesis for the case of Apinajé obstruents would be that the prenasalized phoneme series is a recent development starting off from the nasal-oral contexts in which transitional segments are inserted, as seen with the velar nasal phoneme /֊/, where an oral velar transition [k, g] appears before oral vowels but not before nasal vowels (section 1.1.2, examples (37-38)). Obviously, this historical hypothesis needs to be tested through comparative analysis. This is a task that is beyond the scope of this dissertation, and therefore will be postponed.

55

1.1.2. Continuant phonemes Nasals. The labial and coronal nasal phonemes /m, n, ْ/ occur in syllable onset and coda, in word initial, medial and final positions.
The bilabial nasal /m/ may appear fully de-nasalized [b] in the context of nonfront mid oral vowels.

The velar nasal phoneme /֊/ is realized as [֊, ֊g]. Of restricted distribution, the velar nasal /֊/ occurs exclusively in stressed syllable onset. The allophone [֊g] occurs before oral vowels (37-38).8 In careful speech, the stop contour may be slightly devoiced (37).

8 Ham’s (1961) hypothesis holds true for this phoneme, with regard to the nasal/prenasal contrast.

Fricatives. The alveolar fricative /s/, realized as [s], has fairly restricted distribution in Apinajé, occurring mostly in proper names. A consultant has reported to me that many, though not all, of the proper names containing this phoneme come from the related language Xerente (Central Jê), and may have been incorporated into the Apinajé inventory of names by means of interethnic marriage. Some examples are S᭣t, Sipђc, Simika, SikwaБta (women’s names), Surirϯ, and Su֊gi (men’s names).9 This observation sounds plausible given the distributional restrictions of /s/.
The phoneme /s/ has been noted also in variations of an Apinajé kinship term: si ‘female.vocative’, sirϯ, sisi. Other than that, /s/ appears more often in words borrowed from Portuguese. In words other than Portuguese borrowings, the alveolar fricative /s/ occurs at syllable onset, in word initial and medial positions.

The labiodental fricative /f/ is a phoneme borrowed from Portuguese, whose occurrence in Apinajé is limited to loan words. In spite of that, /f/ is also subject to the voice alternation typical of Apinajé obstruents, especially in the context of sonorants (40.b).

1.1.3. Approximant phonemes Flap. The alveolar flap /‫ש‬/ is realized by the allophones [‫]ש‬, [‫]ײ‬, [և] and [l]. The phoneme may occupy syllable onset and coda, occurring in initial, medial and final positions in the word. The retroflex allophone [‫ ]ײ‬appears in syllable onset word medially, and in syllable coda word finally. At word boundary, there is fluctuation between the retroflexed flap and lateral allophones [‫ײ‬, և]. The retroflex flap is in free variation with its non-retroflex counterpart [‫]ש‬, which occurs in all other environments (41-42).

Glides. The palatal glide /j/ has the allophones [j], [z], [Ѯ] and [dЋ]. The allophone [j] occurs (a) in simplex onsets of unstressed syllables, immediately followed by a vowel; (b) in syllable codas, word-medially, followed by a consonant; and (c) in syllable codas at word-final position (44). The voiced alveolar fricative allophone [z] occurs in complex syllable onsets, occupying second position in a tautosyllabic consonant cluster (45). The voiced alveopalatal fricative allophone [Ѯ] occurs in simplex onsets of stressed syllables (46). Finally, the voiced palatal affricate allophone [dЋ] occurs in syllable codas at wordfinal position, immediately followed by a vowel-initial morpheme (47).

The inventory of Apinajé vowel phonemes proposed here differs from Ham (1961) in that (a) it includes the schwa /ђ/ as a distinctive segment and (b) it excludes the nasal central low vowel /ã/ present in Ham’s proposal, which I have not attested in my data. In other words, the present phoneme inventory includes four (not three) mid central vowels – three orals and one nasal; in addition to two high central vowels (oral and nasal), and one low central vowel.
From a typological viewpoint, the proliferation of contrastive vowels occurs most commonly in the front space of the vocal tract. Thus, if the analysis proposed here is correct, the occurrence of five central (oral) vowel phonemes is a typologically uncommon fact about Apinajé. However, the distinction between two of these midcentral phonemes, /Ҷ, ѩ/, is also attested in at least four other Northern Jê languages: Suyá, Tapayúna, Parkatejê, and Krahô.
Independent support for the segmental analysis proposed here comes from historical-comparative evidence as well. An ongoing study on the development of present-day vowel systems in Jê languages reveals a phonological correspondence of the Northern Jê mid-central vowels /Ҷ, ѩ/ to the mid-high and mid-low front vowels /e, ϯ/ of Central Jê languages, respectively (Oliveira and Ribeiro 2005).
As for the schwa /ђ/, so far its phonemic status in Apinajé seems to be attested by minimal and analogous pairs, as will be shown below. However, because of the typologically questionable existence of three contrastive mid-central vowels in any phonemic inventory, an eventual acoustic analysis might prove useful for an accurate

62
phonetic characterization of this segment in particular, such that it can be contrasted with the phonetic properties of the other two mid-central vowels /Ҷ, ѩ/ found in the language.
If the phonetic and phonemic distinctions amongst the three segments become further confirmed by an acoustic analysis, then the addition of the schwa /ђ/ to the phoneme inventory may have been a phonological innovation of Apinajé. One functional motivation for this diversification of contrastive vowels could be the fact that morphemes in Apinajé are monosyllabic, and phonemic distinctions help maintain semantic distinctions amongst morphemes by avoiding homophony.
The contrasts amongst vowel phonemes are illustrated in (50-56).

The nasal front mid vowel /e/ is realized by the allophones [ϯ, e] in free variation. The nasal back mid vowel /õ/ is realized as slightly lower than [õ] and slightly higher than [ѐ].

66
One instance of alternation between this allophone of /õ/ and higher counterparts [Ѩ, u] has been noted in the corpus. The alternation applies to one morpheme in particular, the indefinite determiner õ. The alternative realizations of this morpheme might be partially due to factors external to the phonological system, however. It appears that the indefinite article um [u] has been borrowed from Portuguese and phonologically adapted into Apinajé as /õ/. The high allomorphs could be a retention of the original shape of the borrowed morpheme.

The mid-low central phoneme /ѩ/ displays the allophones [ѩ, ‫׹‬, ђ]. There is free variation between the allophones [ѩ, ‫ ]׹‬in stressed position (57).

Nasality and voicing are analyzed as dynamic processes and are discussed in section 3.

2. Syllable structure

The phonological inventory of Apinajé includes open and closed syllables. Syllable onsets may be simplex or complex, consisting of up to three consonants. Complex syllable codas have been noted only in instances of transitional consonant insertion (section 1.1.); these are not being considered here as a distinctive syllable types, but rather as one derived by a phonetic process.
Syllable structures attested in Apinajé are V(C), CV(C), CCV(C), CCCV(C), illustrated in (60-63).

2.1. Phonotactic constraints The phonotactic constraints that organize the internal structure of syllables are as follows. Tautosyllabic clusters at complex-onset position may consist of up to three consonants, only one of which may be a plosive. Plosives occur exclusively at syllable margins, thus occupying first position in the cluster. Nasals and approximants, on the other hand, may co-occur in complex syllable onsets.
Plosive sounds that may appear in complex onsets are stops and affricates – both voiceless (labial, coronal, velar) and prenasal (labial and coronal). Nasal sounds that occur are labial and velar. Approximants are the labial and coronal flap and glides.
The inventory of segments found in tautosyllabic clusters is presented in Table II.3; their relative distribution is discussed below and presented schematically in (64-66).

All consonants obey a distributional restriction whereby each segment in a tautosyllabic sequence must be produced at a different place of articulation – labial, coronal or velar. An additional dimension of this requirement is that each segment in the sequence be produced with a different mode of articulation – plosive, nasal or approximant. Sequences of approximants are attested, but among the approximants, it is the flap that occurs closest to the nucleus. Possible tautosyllabic clusters are those listed in (64-66). There are no occurrences of clusters formed by a coronal nasal followed by the labiovelar glide (nw, ْw).

3. Stress system In Apinajé, stress falls invariably on the last syllable of the phonological word. Morphemes are typically short, such that it is common for monomorphemic words to be one-syllable long. Words that are two or more syllables long are likely to consist of one morpheme per syllable.
Stress is a necessary and sufficient property of the phonological word, and is indicative of its boundaries. However, the limits of a phonological word sometimes do not coincide with those of a grammatical word (see section III.2.2). In examples (72-74), stress falls predictably on the last syllable regardless of the word length. Some of these words contain affixes, but they constitute simple lexical bases in that they include only one root.

Compounds may be formed either (a) with a lexical base and one of the clitics rϯ, ti; (b) with two or more lexical bases and no clitics; or (c) with two or more lexical bases and one of the clitics (75-77). Every lexical base consists of at least one root and may include affixes as well.
Lexical bases bear stress, as do some of the clitics. Affixes do not bear stress and constitute phonological frame material for the placement of stress in the word. The clitics ti ‘AUG’ and ‫ש‬ϯ ‘DIM’ bear independent stress, which they display in compounds.

73
The data above illustrate that the original stress properties of the bases tend to be somewhat reflected in the derived word, even though primary stress falls on the last syllable of the compound. In (77.a), the elements of the compound are, respectively, a disyllabic and a monosyllabic base. Overall secondary stress falls on the last syllable of the first base. The items in (77.c-d) consist of all monosyllabic bases, amounting to four and five syllables, respectively. Every first and third syllables left-to-right take on stress; the word-final clitic always takes primary stress regardless of whether it is an odd or even syllable.

4. Phonological rules 4.1. Assimilation Nasal spreading. An important source of nasality in assimilation rules is the nasal vowel phoneme. The alveolar flap /‫ש‬/ is nasalized in syllables whose nucleus is occupied by a nasal vowel. Under these conditions, the flap phoneme may be realized as [‫ש‬, n] either in onset or coda position (78).

[a‫ש‬i⎆֊g‫ש‬ѐ] [ani⎆֊g‫ש‬ѐ]
[ga⎆pe‫ש‬e]

‘morning; daylight’ ‘talk’

Nasal spreading is also common in the context of prenasals at morpheme boundaries. The nasal quality of the prenasal affects the preceding consonant within a

74
heterosyllabic cluster. The affected consonant may be a sonorant or an obstruent. Examples (79.a-b) illustrate the nasalization of a bilabial stop at coda position; the original place of articulation is maintained. In both cases, the segments constitute a labial-coronal sequence.

[⎅‫ש‬ѐm⎆di] [ْdЋobm⎆dЋob]

‘dog.FEM’ ‘itch’

In (80), the affected consonant undergoes nasal assimilation, but it undergoes place dissimilation because both segments in the sequence are coronal sonorants (section 4.2). In the same environment, the coronal plosive assimilates the nasality of the coronal prenasal (80-81).

[mbҶm⎆dЋi] [tЀen⎆dЋi]

Oral spreading. Oral vowel phonemes create specific phonetic effects as well. The bilabial nasal /m/ may be fully de-nasalized in the context of non-front mid oral vowels. Example (82) shows that the consonant maintains its voice properties in spite of losing its nasal quality.

(82) /twђm/

The same process has not been attested among coronals in the same environment. Nonetheless, the oral quality of the vowel is preserved in these contexts too, as shown in (83).

Voicing. Plosives are voiced before sonorants at morpheme boundary. In (84), voiceless stops are affected respectively by a following flap and labial glide, in regressive assimilation.

(84) a./pѩt=kaђk=‫ש‬ϯ/ b. /mbҶt=w‫ש‬Ҷ=‫ש‬ϯ/ c. /֊‫ש‬ѐj=ti/

‘anteater (sp.)’ ‘moon’ ‘quandú (mammal, sp.)’

4.2. Dissimilation Coronal dissimilation. Apinajé imposes restrictions on sequences of coronal consonants. When both underlying segments are coronal, they must distinguish in major class terms (sonorant, obstruent) or in place terms (labial, coronal).
An underlying sequence of coronal obstruents yields a sonorant-obstruent sequence, after dissimilation (85). In an underlying sequence of sonorants, place

76
dissimilation applies, so that the surface effect is a labial-coronal sequence of sonorants (86).

Lateralization. The coronal flap /‫ש‬/ undergoes lateralization at morpheme boundary, when preceded by a coronal segment (87). This is one more type of coronal dissimilation, only it pertains exclusively to this segment.

‘see each other’ ‘cotia (rodent, sp.)’ ‘cashew (sp.)’ ‘piranha’ ‘round (DIM)’

4.3. Insertion Syllables containing a nasal vowel at the nucleus insert a transitional nasal before a plosive in word final position.

‘hammock’

77

b./pep/

[⎆pemp] [⎆pemb]

‘warrior’

A voiceless echo-consonant is inserted in final position, following an oral nucleus with a nasal coda. This is the reverse process of that illustrated in (88), involving a nasal nucleus and an oral coda. The reason one knows that the vowel in (89) is an oral phoneme is that, under the proper conditions, the echo-vowel is clearly perceptible word finally, betraying the nasal quality of the coda consonant. That is not the case with the examples in (88).

(89) /kuw᭣ kum/

[ku⎅v᭣⎆kump] [ku⎅v᭣⎆kumu]

‘smoke’

In the context of non-front mid oral vowels, the transitional glide [j] is inserted between the nucleus and a palatal nasal consonant at the coda.

[⎆tЀwђjْ] [⎆‫ש‬ѐjْ] [⎆mbzejْ]

4.4. Compensatory lengthening. Compensatory lengthening applies to a plosive-final lexical base when it is followed by a consonant-initial morpheme – that is, the plosive is deleted, being replaced by vowel lengthening. If the lexical base ends in glide or vowel, no lengthening applies (91-92).

‘rabbit’ ‘monkey’ ‘morissoca (insect, sp.)’

4.5. Prosodies Aspiration. Aspiration occurs between a syllable-final vowel and a stressed syllable beginning in voiceless obstruent. Vowels often involved in the process are the central low phoneme /a/ or the back high phoneme /u/. Aspiration often takes place at morpheme boundary, but within the same phonological word.

‘(one’s) back’ ‘kinship term’ ‘depart’ ‘riffle’

Echo-vowels. Closed syllables usually display an echo-vowel word finally. The echovowel is a phonetically reduced sound whose quality is reminiscent of that of the vowel at the nucleus. Words ending in the voiceless affricate /tЀ/ are an exception; the quality of the echo vowel in this case is reminiscent of the palatal quality of the consonant – it is [i].

The echo-vowel indicates the end of a phonological word. It occurs most often in content words, though there are instances of echo-vowels in function words too. The morphemes ket and kot, in (96), are a negative particle and a postposition, respectively.
The fact that these units are prominent within their respective constituents might be one reason why these function words – and not others – tend to display echo-vowels. Both particles and postpositions occur phrase-finally and thus have better chances of appearing in utterance-final position, the locus of echo-vowels.
An independent hypothesis for why ket and kot display a property characteristic of content words is that both, particle and postposition, must derive historically from content words – a verb and a noun, respectively (chapter III). The occurrence of echo-vowels may be one feature that indicates their diachronic origin.

80
5. Summary of properties of the phonological word Three prosodic properties characterize the phonological word: stress, echo-vowels and aspiration. Stress is predictable in Apinajé and indicates the end of a phonological word. Any putative phonological word must consist of at least one stress-bearing element. Aspiration is a process that applies only word-medially; it is also related to stress. Finally, echo-vowels also serve as an index of final word boundary. A more detailed discussion of the phonological word in Apinajé is provided in the next chapter, where this notion is contrasted to that of grammatical word.

81
CHAPTER III
MORPHOLOGY
0. Introduction For the unacquainted observer, Apinajé may appear as a morphologically plain language of the analytic kind, consisting of rather short words, and having much of its grammatical categories expressed by function words rather than bound morphemes. That impression is justified: Apinajé morphemes are monosyllabic indeed, and the grammatical categories found in the language are often expressed by function words that may or may not be phonologically dependent, or by syntactic constructions that often times employ a subset of these very function words.
However, Apinajé words are not necessarily monomorphemic – nor monosyllabic, for that matter. Words consisting of more than one syllable usually consist of as many morphemes; and Apinajé morphology is rather rich, especially in regard to content words. Thus, Apinajé may be typologically characterized as an agglutinating language of analytic spirit, with compounding and prefixation playing major roles in word formation. The predominance of prefixes over suffixes is reminiscent of the fact that Apinajé is a head final language: syntactically dependent elements serve as a diachronic source for phonologically dependent ones.

82
A set of morphs appearing in specific word classes do not constitute productive morphology, however. These are fossilized morphological debris that simply subcategorize words into morphological or semantic classes at the synchronic level (section 3.1). Bare-root counterparts can be found for some of these stems but not for others, which shows that despite their high frequency in the lexicon, these morphs are not part of a productive morphological system. Added to that, these morphs tend to be semantically empty or of elusive meaning. For these reasons, they are called “formatives” (and not “morphemes”) in the remainder of the text.
It appears that a large part of the Apinajé lexicon consists of words that include some type of formative in its morphological structure; most disyllabic verbs and nouns are like that (see Dictionary, Appendix C).
The morphological units of Apinajé are introduced in what follows. A phonological and grammatical characterization of the word, as well as the wordformation strategies available, are presented in section 2; section 3 deals with the various word classes of Apinajé, grouped here under two main subheadings: lexical categories and grammatical categories; and section 4 presents the inflectional and derivational morphology.
1. Morphological units 1.1. Roots Apinajé roots are monosyllabic, bear stress and may come in any of the syllable types available in the language, namely, V(C), CV(C), CCV(C) or CCCV(C). Some roots may

83

constitute words on their own, while others serve as the base for morphologically

complex stems, such as compounds and derived lexemes. Compounds consit of more

than one root (2.a), and may include derivational morphology as well (2.b). Derivational

morphemes may be clitics or affixes attaching to the root (3). Roots may also come

accompanied by formatives, constituting another kind of morphologically complex stem

(4).

1 Relational Prefixes (RP) are part of the inflectional system of Apinajé. These morphemes occur pervasively in vowel-initial nouns, verbs and postpositions of Apinajé. See details in section 4.1.2. below.

‘confine; dam; obstruct’ ‘wash soft or granulated O’ ‘blood; menstruate’ ‘stand in vertical position [PL.S]’ ‘wash firm O’ ‘throat’ ‘home’ ‘roll end over end; tumble’

1.2. Affixes Inflectional and derivational affixes are often monosyllabic morphemes whose structure is restricted to the V(C) and CV(C) syllable patterns. Certain inflectional affixes may consist of a single consonant, as is the case with relational prefixes and nonfiniteness suffixes (sections 4.1.2. and 4.1.3.). Affixes do not display any particular stress properties in Apinajé; they simply contribute segmental material to the phonological word, submitting to the overall stress rule applicable to that word. The verb pi ‘kill’ is inflected for person in (5). The finite form of the verb is shown in (a), and its nonfinite form in (b).

[a⎆pi‫]ש‬ [⎆pi‫]ש‬

‘kill you’ ‘kill it’

Formatives display the same structural properties as affixes, certainly because they too were affixes at an earlier stage in the development of the language. For instance, it is possible to identify personal prefixes that have been reanalyzed as part of some stems, which take productive inflectional morphology at the synchronic level (6).

1.3. Clitics Clitics may be of three kinds: positional clitics, phrasal clitics and word clitics, all of which display specific stress properties and, like the roots, may come in any of the syllable patterns available. Positional clitics occupy specific slots in the structure of the clause, and they usually encode grammatical categories that pertain to the proposition as a whole, such as mood, tense, aspect and the like (7). Few phrasal clitics indicate the initial boundary of a phrase; the tendency is for them to occur phrase finally (8). The same is true of word clitics, except that their structural domain is restricted to the (grammatical) word (9).2
2 As mentioned in footnote 3 of chapter II, throughout this dissertation I will use the symbol “=” to indicate clitic boundaries, but only in the case of word clitics. Positional (phrase and clause) clitics will be simply

Some phrase final clitics retain stress prominence in their domain (10). Some positional clitics retain stress prominence in a clitic sequence – that is true of the tense and aspect clitics vis-à-vis mood and pronominal clitics. Notice that the clause-initial
written as monosyllabic function words and separated by spaces, since they have broader syntactic scope

87
clitics in (11) form one phonological word, with stress falling on the last syllable of the sequence, that is, the past tense marker.

2. Word In any language, words can be characterized in terms of phonological and grammatical properties, which constitute independent criterial dimensions. One general definition of the phonological word is provided in Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) as follows:
A phonological word is a phonological unit larger than the syllable (in some languages it may minimally be just one syllable) which has at least one (and generally more than one) phonological defining property chosen from the following areas:
and occupy predictable positions in clauses and phrases.

88
(a) Segmental features – internal syllabic and segmental structure; phonetic realisations in terms of this; word boundary phenomena; pause phenomena.
(b) Prosodic features – stress (or accent) and/or tone assignment; prosodic features such as nasalization, retroflexion, vowel harmony.
(c) Phonological rules – some rules apply only within a phonological word; others (external sandhi rules) apply specifically across a word boundary.
Note that there is likely to be a close interaction between these types of features (Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002: 13).
The definitional criteria put forward by them are seen, admitedly, as types rather
than universal criteria, which may not apply to every language. In regard to the definition
of a grammatical word, however, they offer what they see as a set of universal criteria.
Their list is as follows:
A grammatical word consists of a number of grammatical elements which: (a) always occur together, rather than scattered through the clause (the criterion of cohesiveness); (b) occur in a fixed order; (c) have a conventionalized coherence and meaning. (...) (d) Morphological processes involved in the formation of words tend to be non-recursive. That is, one element will not appear twice in a word. (...) (e) There will be just one inflectional affix per word. (...) (f) A speaker may pause between words but not within a word. (...) (g) A word may constitute a complete utterance, all by itself (Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002:19-25).
The list certainly includes criteria that cannot be taken to the letter, or, as Dixon
and Aikhenvald put it, they must be “tempered by a number of caveats”. In the case of
Apinajé, at least two of those certainly do not apply, namely, criteria (d, e). As will be
seen, relational prefixes, for instance, can certainly appear more than once in a word
(section 3.1.2.4, example (63)). In addition, a relational prefix must necessarily co-occur

89
with a person prefix in the context of a vowel-initial stem; and both relational and person prefixes are inflectional morphemes in Apinajé.
Dixon and Aikhenvald call attention to the fact that a phonological word – or, the word as defined by its phonological properties – in a given language, may or may not coincide with a grammatical word in the same language. Thus, a grammatical word may consist of more than one phonological word or, likewise, a phonological word may consist of more than one grammatical word. In the first case, they cite the example of Yimas (Foley 1991: 86, cited in Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002), in which compounds (grammatical words) are composed of more than one phonological word (the participating nouns), in that they bear individual primary stresses. As an illustration of the second case, they cite examples of one positional clitic in Dyirbal (p. 27-28).
In Apinajé, as will be seen, a grammatical word may comprise more than one phonological word. The grammatical and phonological criteria for the delimitation of the word in Apinajé are addressed next.
2.1. Phonological word A phonological word is often one foot long and possibly two feet long. Stress is a necessary property of a phonological word. Segmental and prosodic criteria that help define the phonological word include those indicative of word initial and final boundaries, and word internal cohesion.
The flap lateralization phenomenon indicates the beginning of a phonological word (13). Certain sandhi rules applying exclusively across word boundaries, such as

90
glottal stop insertion between plosives and glide affricatization; and the pausal phenomenon of echo vowel insertion, are indicative of final boundary (14). Aspiration and voicelessness in the context of plosive consonants indicate word-internal cohesion, for these phenomena occur exclusively at affix-root boundaries (15).

Although it is typologically common for clitics to depend phonologically on a host, it is not impossible for clitics to form phonological words on their own (cf. Aikhenvald 2002: 58, 61). That is the case in Apinajé. As illustrated in (11), repeated here for convenience, certain combinations of clitics may form phonological words. The clitic sequence shown in the example constitutes a one-foot word. The plosive in the unstressed syllable onset is realized as voiced, as in any other word.

2.2. Grammatical word In Apinajé, a grammatical word must consist of at least one phonological word, but it can include more than one such unit. It may comprise one root (16.a), a combination of roots (16.b), a combination of root and affix (16.c), a combination of root and clitic(16.d), or a combination of root, affix and clitic (16e) (roots are in bold). Both roots and clitics may bear stress, thus constituting separate phonological words within the same grammatical word (16.e).

Clitics that are phonologically autonomous must occur in specific slots in the syntactic context; in this sense, they are syntactically bound (details in section 3.2.2).
The Apinajé grammatical word can be identified according to some of the criteria listed in Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19-25). First, the grammatical word is internally cohesive, both formally, since its components constitute a bound unit; and semantically, because that unit conveys a conventionalized meaning. Secondly, the component

92
morphemes of a grammatical word in Apinajé follow a particular order, with word clitics always occupying the outermost final position in the word, thus indicating the word final boundary, and person prefixes appearing in first position, when applicable, thus indicating the word-initial boundary. Thirdly, speakers generally utter the word without interruptions or pauses, except in case of hesitations, clarifications or factors of this sort, which are part of natural speech in any language. Finally, the Apinajé grammatical word can constitute a complete utterance by itself.
2.3. Word-formation strategies Mechanisms of word formation in Apinajé include affixation and compounding, and phonological strategies such as vowel alternation, reduplication, and suppletion. These are discussed in what follows.
2.3.1. Affixation Prefixes are more numerous than suffixes in Apinajé. Affixes encode inflectional and derivational categories; they have no stress properties but may participate in segmental alternations.
Inflectional prefixes express the categories of person and constituency; whereas suffixes encode nonfiniteness and the participle (section 4.1). Relational prefixes (indices of constituency) are single consonants mostly of palatal quality (17.a). Nonfiniteness suffixes are coronal consonants (17.b).

b. are-ْ õ-t ᭣-‫ש‬

‘lie’ ‘exterminate O; kill off O’ ‘many’
‘confide.NF’ ‘sleep.NF’ ‘sit.NF’

Derivational prefixes express various middle-voice meanings. “Middle voice” is taken here in a broad sense; under this heading are grouped semantic nuances such as ‘impersonal’, ‘patientive’, and ‘middle’, in a strict sense. Middle prefixes may detransitivize the bases to which they attach ((18); section 4.2).

‘round; spherical’ ‘enter [PL.S]’ ‘eat <INTR>’

< kѐt ‘swell’ < gje ‘place [PL.O] into deep recipient’ < ku ‘eat <TR>’

Formatives, the semantically empty morphs found recurrently in certain words, are prefixal (19).

‘fear; be afraid’ ‘abandon’ ‘spell <N>’ ‘smoke [meat]’

<ba ‘feel’ < rϯ ‘leave behind’

94

2.3.2. Vowel alternation Lexical counterparts are derived through vowel alternation. Although this is not a widespread morphological mechanism in Apinajé, some semantically related roots belonging to different lexical categories share all phonological characteristics but one vowel feature. In (20.a), the relevant feature is height; in (20.b) it is nasality.

Verb

‘squeeze juice out of O’ ‘take seeds out of [plant]’

As the examples show, the alternations result in word class change, a property common to derivational-type morphology. Although a decision about which root is the source of the derivation could be somewhat arbitrary in strictly phonological terms, the semantics of the resulting stems suggest that nouns are sources and verbs are derived.

2.3.3. Reduplication Reduplication is a strategy frequently used in the formation of descriptive verb stems (3.1.2). Verbs derived in this way often refer to such concepts as colors, (onomatopoeic) sounds, iterative, repetitive or progressive events, and events that depict fragmentation, as

95
‘shatter’. Only a few instances have been found of reduplication verbs that are not descriptive; these include krakra ‘shatter [TR]’ and kapreprek ‘spank’ (which is a transitive classificatory verb of the ka- class; section 3.1.2.2).
As a phonological strategy, reduplication reproduces the first foot right-to-left of the original stem. The fact that most closed syllables lose their coda under these conditions suggests that the preferred phonological structure of the derived item is a default iambic foot, that is ( ˇ ¯ ) (Hayes 1995: 62ff; 205).

Under the same conditions, the closed syllables of certain bases maintain their coda, but are subject to resyllabification or to phonological processes that affect the segments involved in the heterosyllabic consonant cluster (22).
3 Following Hayes (1995), the notation (. x) stands for an iambic foot; that is, a unit consisting of two syllables where prominence is placed on the last syllable in the sequence. The notation (x), seen below, stands for a foot formed by a single syllable.

Finally, reduplication verb stems may include classificatory formatives, such as ka- and õ-, or they may occur with word clitics such as the morphological causative ѐ. Under these conditions, the prefixes or enclitics are (re)parsed either into defective feet or into canonical iambic feet, after they take inflectional prefixes (Hayes 1995: 113; (24)).

One important point to notice is that, in some cases, the base for reduplication may not be found as a root elsewhere; in other words, some of these items, such as rϯrϯk

97
and tђtђk, only occur in their reduplicated forms, in the database. Such cases suggest that reduplication in Apinajé is more a lexicalized result than a fully productive process.
Another point is that the semantic relationship between reduplicated stems and their respective bases may be completely obscure, as illustrated by the verb preprek ‘be fast; rush’, based on the root prek ‘tall’ (but see kapreprek, section 3.1.2.2).
Although reduplication is more common in the formation of verbs, a few noun stems are also formed in this way. However, some of these stems may result from the conversion of reduplicated verbs into nouns (25.b), or are compounds that include reduplicated verbal stems (25.c).

2.3.4. Conversion

98
Conversion4, a change in the lexical category of a given lexeme without the use of overt morphology, is a common mechanism in the derivation of Noun-Verb counterparts, as well as transitive-intransitive-descriptive counterparts, among verbs; derivational morphology does not occur in this context. Illustrative examples are presented in (2627).

4 The phenomenon described here as conversion is sometimes referred to in the literature as functional shift or as zero derivation. As Bauer (1988) points out, however, the term “zero derivation” is not felicitous because it would imply a contrast between a pair of word forms based on the presence versus the absence of some distinctive morphological element between its members, which is not true in cases like these. Thus, the “zero morph” analysis would be more suitable when describing a paradigmatic contrast.

2.3.5. Suppletion Some postpositions display suppletive inflectional forms. The postposition pe ‘detrimental’, inflected for person in (28), is illustrative. A hypothesis for these suppletive forms is that, at an earlier historical stage, these postpositions must have taken the third person prefix ku-. Vowel harmony may have applied, affecting the quality of the prefix vowel, followed by deletion of the word final vowel. This hypothesis needs historical-comparative verification, however.

(28) ic-pe a-pe kep

‘from me’ ‘from you’ ‘from him’

< *ke-pe < *ku-pe

A subset of verbs display different forms depending on the number of participants in the events they describe. I do not analyze these cases as suppletion; these are actually pairs of semantically related but distinct verb stems (section 3.1.2.3).

2.3.6. Compounding A traditional debate about compounding is whether this is a strategy that belongs to the domain of syntax or to that of morphology (cf. e.g. Benveniste 1989 [1967; 1974]; Matthews 1993 [1974]; Bauer 1988). Authors that defend the syntax viewpoint (e.g.

100
Benveniste 1967) call attention to the fact that compounds display internal syntactic structuring, among other syntactic properties; whereas those that argue for the affiliation of compounds to the domain of morphology (e.g. Matthews 1993) point out that these complex elements name (rather than describe) entities, properties or events, and that they are learned as a single units, i.e. lexemes, by young speakers. The approach adopted here for the analysis of the Apinajé data is one which takes into consideration both views. I will seek to justify an analysis of compounds as morphologically complex lexical units by providing criteria that distinguish them from ordinary phrases, but I will also demonstrate the possible combinations of basic elements, and how these elements may form constituents within the compound itself.
Apinajé compounds consist of more than one putative phonological word, since they consist of more than one root. They also have an internal structural organization whereby the stress patterns of each putative phonological word must be combined, and thus constitute what I term here a phonological phrase. Compounds are phonological phrases that correspond to grammatical words. That they are words (not syntactic phrases) can be established on the grounds of internal cohesion and conventionalized meaning (Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002: 19), as well as prosodic properties and certain phonological processes.
For the most part, Apinajé compounds are not characterized by any obvious stress shifts, as compared to grammatical phrase patterns. However, the phonological phrase that results from compounding displays a particular, cohesive intonation pattern, that comes accompanied by a rearrangement of the overall stress pattern of the word. It can

101
be described, in the terms of Hayes (1995), as an iambic stress pattern, parsed from right to left, with final prominence, foot construction being iterative. These phonological properties of compounds are illustrated below, after their structural properties have been introduced.
Compound stems are verbs and nouns. In terms of internal structure, these grammatical words may involve nominal, verbal and postpositional bases, as well as clitics.

Noun-Noun Stems. Compounds consisting exclusively of nominal elements may include two roots or more, in a structure reminiscent of genitive constructions (29). When more than two roots are involved, they are correspondingly distributed into constituents. Relational prefixes and other relevant bound morphemes may occur (29.b).5

5 The occurrence of inflectional material is not a structural impediment in the analysis of compounds; it is not a typologically uncommon feature either, as may be noted from languages as diverse as Finnish, Icelandic, Turkish, and Portuguese (cf. e.g. Bauer 1988).

Noun-Clitic Stems. Clitics of degree – rϯ ‘DIM’ and ti ‘AUG’– are commonly found in compound nouns, where they may subcategorize the set of referents encoded by formally related words (30.a), or simply be a part of the stem (30.b).

Noun-Verb Stems. Compounds consisting of nominal and verbal elements usually include just two roots in a structure reminiscent of clausal predicates, with the nominal

103
element preceding the verbal one. Clitics of degree may occur, as usual. Some of the resulting stems are descriptive predicators (31).

Compound nouns also result from the noun-verb combination. Here, the verbal element involved is often a descriptive verb (32.a) or some nonfinite verb form (32.b).

Noun-Noun-Verb Stems. Compounds consisting of one verbal element and more than one nominal element may display distinct internal structuring. In (33.a), the phrase tϯ japje ‘long leg’ characterizes pu ‘bug’, as does the augmentative clitic ti. In (33.b), krat kђ ‘waist cover’ displays genitive organization, being modified by r᭣. The same overall stress rules apply regardless of internal structuring patterns, however.

Noun-Postposition-Noun Stem. Some compounds consist of a postpositional phrase-like construction which is subordinated to a nominal element. In this context, the group headed by the dative postposition indicates purpose.

3. Word classes The present section is about the content and function words of Apinajé: how they categorize and how this categorization is expressed in structural terms, among other things. The discussion is organized in terms of lexical categories and grammatical categories. Lexical categories include nouns, verbs, postpositions and adverbials – mostly open classes (section 3.1). Grammatical categories are pronouns and clitics that encode various grammatical meanings – words that consitute closed classes (section 3.2).
3.1. Lexical categories The categories Noun, Verb and Postposition share inflectional properties. The same set of person prefixes is employed in the expression of possession, grammatical relations, and postpositional objects. In rare instances, Nouns and Verbs may even display the same derivational morphology. The fluidity that exists among Nouns and Verbs is also noticeable in conversion, fairly common in the language. The similarities between each of these classes and Postpositions is indicative of the diachronic sources of postpositions. The same is partly true for adverbials, some of which may have verbal or nominal sources.
The morphological and semantic properties of the various lexical classes are introduced in what follows.

107
3.1.1. Nouns 3.1.1.1.Morphosyntactic classes Nouns in Apinajé are categorized morphosyntactically into alienable, inalienable and ambivalent according to the grammatical pattern employed in the expression of possession. Possession and constituency are the inflectional categories pertinent to nouns.

Inalienable Nouns. One pattern used in the expression of possession is the prefixation of person markers directly to the noun stem. Person prefixes indicate the possessor and the stem refers to the possessum. This pattern defines the set of inalienable nouns. Semantically, this set mostly includes terms for part-whole relations, such as kinship and body parts. The examples in (36) are illustrative.
In (36.b), a relational prefix occurs between the person prefix and a vowel-initial stem; this morpheme indicates that possessor and possessed elements form a constituent. (36.c) shows that person prefixes are in complementary distribution with a possessor noun phrase. Notice that the relational prefix applies in this context as well (section 4.1.2).

(36) a. a-krђ 2-head
a-bjeْ 2-husband
b. i-ْ-õБtѐ 1-RP-tongue

‘your head’ ‘your husband’ ‘my tongue

i-j-akrђm 1-RP-husband

c. di

c-uci

woman RP-spell

108 ‘my husband’ ‘the woman’s spell’

Alienable Nouns. Another pattern used in the expression of possession involves the genitive postposition õ, which immediately follows the possessor noun or takes a person prefix that refers to it.

(37) a-ْ-õ meõ 2-RP-GEN food
i-ْ-õ rѐp 1-RP-GEN dog
Irϯ ْ-õ prin N. RP-GEN pequi

‘your food’ ‘my dog’ ‘Iré’s pequis’

The genitive postposition serves as a grammatical mediator between possessor and possessed element, and takes relational marking; notice that the complementary distribution between person prefixes and possessor noun phrases also holds in this context, that is, possessor noun phrases and person prefixes do not co-occur.
This morphosyntactic pattern defines the set of alienable nouns, which include terms for natural phenomena and elements, social roles and positions, among others.

109
Ambivalent Nouns. Some nouns may follow either of the two patterns just introduced – prefixation or the postpositional genitive construction. This property defines the set of ambivalent nouns, which include terms for work tools, utensils, cultural items, among others. The choice for one or the other morphosyntactic pattern seems to be determined by extralinguistic factors, such as whether the possessor is the same person who made the possessed referent; personal preference for a given referent, among others. Apparently, the closer the involvement or interest on the part of the possessor for the possessed item, the more likely it is for the inalienable pattern to be used (38.a); otherwise, the alienable pattern applies (38.b).

(38) a. ic-kawђ 1-basket

b. i-ْ-õ

kawђ

1-RP-GEN basket

‘my basket’ ‘my basket’

3.1.1.2.Morpho-semantic classes Nouns have in common with Verbs and, to a lesser extent, Postpositions, stems that include the formatives õ- and i-. Presumably, these formatives are historically derived from nominal elements; -i is a third person prefix of limited occurrence, elsewhere in the language (section 4.1.1). The formative i- appears in Verbs and Postpositions. The formative õ appears in Verbs but not Postpositions.

110

Õ-Noun Stems. The semantics of the formative õ refers to ‘inner side’, combining the senses found among Verbs and Nouns. In Nouns, the formative seems to have a more specific meaning, especially among inalienable, body part nouns. Body part nouns constitute the majority of nouns formed with õ; here the formative refers to the ‘inner side of the body’. Other related meanings occur with other nouns of this class, including compounds.

(39) õkrϯ ‘throat’ õkrђ ‘forehead’ õБtѐ ‘tongue’ õkrϯpoj ‘voice’ õkrϯce ‘necklace’ õkw᭣ ‘home’

Inflected for 1st person: i-ْ-õkrϯ i-ْ-õkrђ i-ْ-õБtѐ i-ْ-õkrϯpoj i-ْ-õkrϯce i-ْ-õkw᭣

< krϯ ‘orifice’ < krђ ‘head’

I-Noun Stems. Stems with the formative i- are body part terms. This formative evolved from a third person prefix attached to a noun which eventually became reanalyzed as part of the noun stem. These are all inalienable nouns that take person and relational prefixes, as any member of the class.

(40) ibr᭣=kђ idϯ idwҶt
iju

‘hunting bag’ ‘cheeks’ ‘wrist’ ‘nose’

Inflected for 1st person: i-ْ-ibr᭣kђ i-ْ-idϯ i-ْ-idwҶt i-ْ-iju

111
3.1.1.3.Compound Nouns Compounding is a productive noun formation strategy (section 2.3.6). Compound noun stems necessarily involve noun roots; elements are organized either in a genitive construction-like structure or in a predicate-like strucuture. The augmentative and diminutive clitics occur word finally. Like all other nouns, they may be categorized as alienable, inalienable or ambivalent, depending on the preferred pattern of inflection (2930).
3.1.1.4.Derived Nouns Derivational morphology that creates deverbal nouns includes the phrasal clitics cђ ‘NMLZ.INSTR/LOC’ and cwђْ ‘NMLZ.AG’; the latter is employed in relativization, as a nominalizer of the dependent clause. Nouns derived by these clitics may be based on nonfinite verb stems or on more complex structures, comparable to the compound stems introduced above.
The nominalizer of instrument or location cђ is used with transitive, intransitive, and descriptive verbs. The absolutive argument of the base verb may be expressed as the possessor of the resulting noun (41.a); bases beginning in a vowel must take the relational prefix.

112

(41) a. ic-katѐr=cђ 1-get.out.NF=NMLZ.LOC
a-ْ-ipec=cђ 2-RP=make=NMLZ.INSTR
b. pok=cђ ignite=NMLZ.INSTR
atkat᭣=cђ cover=NMLZ.INSTR

‘my mother’ ‘your father’ ‘firing cap’ ‘loincloth’

The nominalizer cwђْ applies to transitive and intransitive verbs. Nouns derived by it designate agents regardless of the valency of the base verb; the accusative argument of a transitive base is usually present, and the agent is typically understood as referential/definite. There may be incorporation of the base-verb object into the newly formed lexeme (42.b).

The morpheme cwђْ is also employed in nominalizations involving the genitive postposition õ. The clitic encodes what would be the possessum in this genitive-like construction (43).

In all above cases, primary word stress falls on the nominalizer. One set of nouns includes prefixes that occur more productively in verbs, namely,
the middle prefixes (a-, aw-, am-; see section 3.1.2.4). When attached to verbs, these prefixes typically result in detransitivization of the base. A similar result holds with nouns, in that the valency of the noun may also be reduced: inalienable nouns become alienable after the derivation (44.a). There is one instance in which the opposite is true, with the derivation departing from an alienable noun (44.b). Other cases involve the use of verbal roots as bases, a role that may be performed by transitive, intransitive or descriptive verbs (44.c-d). Sequences of morphemes belonging to the “middle inventory,” such as aw- and am-, apply to these verbal bases for noun derivation.

Finally, the other derivational strategy commonly used in the formation of nouns is conversion, based either on finite or nonfinite verb forms ((26); section 2.3.4). Reduplication is employed as a marginal strategy in the formation of noun stems (25).

3.1.2. Verbs Apinajé verbs inflect for person, constituency and nonfiniteness. Like Nouns, Verbs are grouped into classes according to the inflectional patterns they follow. Unlike Nouns, Verbs also form subclasses according to the formatives that constitute part of their stems. This subclassification may result in purely morphological verb classes or it may result in morpho-semantic verb classes, depending on the semantic value of the formatives involved. In addition, Apinajé presents pairs of verb stems that are complementary with respect to the category of number, among other semantic properties.

115
3.1.2.1.Morphosyntactic classes Verbs fall into three major classes depending on the way they pattern for person inflection in main clauses. Bivalent and trivalent verbs inflect for person, with the person prefix encoding O. Some monovalent verbs inflect for person, with the prefix encoding S, while others do not inflect for person at all. Monovalent verbs belonging to the former set typically describe states; those belonging to the latter, activities and events. That is, the morphosyntactic split existing among monovalent verbs corresponds, by and large, to semantic classes as well.
The three major classes revealed by these inflectional patterns are those of transitive verbs (45.a), descriptive verbs (45.b) and intransitive verbs (45.c).6

6 Throughout this dissertation I will use the term descriptive verb to refer to “stative intransitive” or “unaccusative” verbs; and the term intransitive verb to refer to “active intransitive” or “unergative” verbs. By doing so, I will be following the traditional terminology of the South American literature on Macro-Jê languages.

116
The split intransitivity that characterizes the verbal system in main clauses is neutralized in dependent clauses, where verbs take on a nonfinite form. Under these conditions, verbs belonging to the class of intransitives also take person inflection, thus following the same pattern as descriptives (46.a-c).

Details about occurrence restrictions on person markers in finite and nonfinite verb forms are given in section 4.1.

3.1.2.2.Morpho-semantic classes Verb stems may also constitute morpho-semantic classes that correspond to the occurrence of formatives. Some formatives present fairly clear semantic content, while others are semantically empty. Recall that formatives are not any type of productive

117
derivational or inflectional morphology; instead, they are frozen forms that appear recurrently in lexical categories.
From a historical viewpoint, some formatives have evolved from third-person morphemes which have been reanalyzed as part of the stem; others must have evolved from nouns; while still others may have been derivational morphology at an earlier stage in the history of the language. These morpho-semantic verb classes and the formatives that motivate them are discussed next.

Ka- Verb Stems. The formative ka- appears in transitive and descriptive verb stems, with ka-transitives constituting the largest semantically transparent class in the database. To some extent, the formative ka- operates as an index of “classificatory stem,” in the sense that (transitive) verbs containing this formative always refer to physical contact or manipulation (47).

‘confine; dam; obstruct’ ‘chop [wood]’ ‘wash [soft or granulated O]’ ‘grind; pound’ ‘pull out’ ‘tear; rip’ ‘make marks on O; write on O’ ‘squeeze to extract liquid’ ‘capture with trap; entwine, entangle’ ‘sting; pierce’ ‘pinch’

‘sweep’ ‘spank’ ‘soothe’
‘hoe’ ‘cover’
‘break into pieces; shatter’
‘fasten’
‘pound’
‘gather; harvest’

It is also possible to recognize certain independent verb roots in these stems, such as kje ‘drag; pull’, o ‘suck’, re ‘cross [e.g. a river]’, and preprek ‘fast’. While the meanings found in the overall set are already a good indication of the semantic value of the formative ka-, the meanings of the related roots support the analysis of ‘physical contact or manipulation’ (48).

119
Transitive ka- stems constitute a morpho-semantic class. These verbs do not present any morphological or syntactic idiosyncrasies, behaving just like any other regular transitive verb.
In descriptive verbs, the formative ka- is less transparent semantically (49), even though it is easier to find independent roots related to these descriptives than to katransitives (50).

‘be skinny’ ‘bake; roast’ ‘be yellow’ ‘remain; stay behind’

kaБi kagrѐ karђr kaprҶ

‘be thinning [of hair]’ ‘be hot’ ‘be blond’ ‘be empty’

One observation about the set in (49) is that it includes a number of “hair-related” terms. It also seems, on the basis of the semantic content of the roots listed above, that ka- operates as an overt index of state or change-of-state in these cases. This hypothesis

120
seems to apply beyond kagrѐ ‘be(come) hot’, kaБi ‘be(come) thin’, and kapri ‘be(come) sad’ (which could possibly be explained in metaphorical terms: ka- ‘become’+ pri ‘short’), since some of these verbs already indicate state, as is the case with karђr ‘be blond’. In the case of kaprҶ, it seems it could relate to prђ in the following way: prђ focuses on the thing that has been left behind after everything else was gone, whereas kaprҶ focuses on the space left after everything else has gone (for vowel alternations in Apinajé see section 2.3.2). This is just a speculation, however; more systematic evidence must be sought in historical-comparative analyses.
Members of the descriptive ka- class constitute more of a morphological than a semantic class, in that they share the same formative ka- with transitives but with no transparent semantic value in common. In any case, ka-descriptives do not display any morphological idiosyncrasies.
Because of the remaining semantic content of the formative ka-, I would hypothesize that this formative must have evolved from a derivational morpheme.
U- Verb Stems. The class of verb stems taking the stem-initial formative u- may be divided into two subclasses on the basis of the relational prefix that they take, which may be either p- or c- (see section 4.1.2).

121

(51) a. ude uba
b. umce ujaprҶ

p-᭣-de p-᭣-ba
c-umce c-ujaprҶ

‘capture; seize; imprison’ ‘fear’
‘hold with both arms; hug’ ‘slander’

The first subclass to be examined is that taking the prefix p-. For certain members of this subclass, the formative u- displays its phonological variant ᭣-, which occurs in the context of the relational prefix (52.a). A second set takes the vowel ѐ in non-relational prefix contexts, while maintaining the u- intact with the prefix p- (52.b).

(52) a. ude uba urѩk utѩ uti
b. ѐmduj ѐbu

p-᭣-de p-᭣-ba p-᭣-rѩk p-᭣-tѩ p-᭣-ti
p-u-duj p-u-bu

‘capture; seize; imprison’ ‘fear’ ‘act like O; behave as O’ ‘help; assist’ ‘heavy’
‘bad; ugly’ ‘see’

Base roots present in some of the preceding stems are identifiable; these include de ‘take from’, ba ‘be scared’, duj ‘bad’. The semantic trait that unites these forms is unclear, especially because the base roots have meanings very similar to the derived ones. One property that is more systematic, which is actually a morphosyntactic one, is the tendency for these verbs to employ noncanonical argument marking (for patterns and details see section IV.3). That is true of the verbs ude, uba, urѩk, and utѩ, in (52). Two of

122
the remaining verbs are descriptives, and one is a canonical transitive. Thus, this set of uverbs constitutes more of a morphosyntactic than a semantic class.
The second subset of u-verbs takes the palatal relational prefix c- (53). In example (53.b), an anomalous alternation is noted for both the relational prefix and the formative u- itself: the formative is nasalized, and the relational prefix is the palatal nasalْ-. Verbs belonging in this class are transitives and descriptives; among them, urϯ requires noncanonical argument-marking.

ujwђ ukapi
ukrarkrѐ umce
umi upђm uprђrђ uwapo

b. urϯ

‘place [pl] O right-side up on flat surface’ ‘choose; select; meet for the first time’ ‘belch’ ‘hold with the arms; embrace’ ‘bury with hot stones so as to bake’ ‘deep’ ‘stubborn; uptight’ ‘serene; placid’
‘cease consideration of O; terminate an association with O’

This second subclass of u-verbs gives no better clues to its semantic ties than the first one. Only two separable roots have been identified for this set, namely, prђr ‘provoke; tease; annoy’ and rϯ ‘abandon; depart’. Based on the first root, prђr, one hypothesis would be that u- has a detransitivizing function, with a focus on the agent, and

123
that it must have evolved historically from a derivational morpheme. However, more synchronic and historical data would be necessary to refine and sustain this hypothesis.
From a historical perspective, there must have been two different sources for the present-day formative u-, and the different choices for relational prefixes reflect that. Another possibility is, conversely, that the present-day prefix p- evolved historically from a distinct source and became reanalyzed and standardized into one of the relational markers, while the formative u- was one and the same in either context. The fact that not all u- initial stems may take p- could be explained if the historical source of this pseudorelational prefix p- had been a derivational morpheme, in which case it would have been semi-productive, as is typical of derivational morphology.
Ku- Verb Stems. Ku- verbs constitute a morphological class only, since the semantics that unites verbs in this set is opaque. In general, though, the semantics characteristic of the ku- verb set seems to focus on movement or direct contact against a surface. For instance, in order to wash a firm object, such as a table or one’s body, one might think of rubbing a brush or soap against the surface of that object; in the seemingly more problematic case of kukwҶ ‘break hard-shelled nuts’, as compared with kakwҶ ‘dig; poke’, the action again affects the surface of the item being broken, and so on. Ku- verbs are mostly transitives (although there are a few exceptions), and they do not display any structural idiosyncrasies.

124

‘wash firm O’
‘peel’
‘roast [small food items, e.g. little fish]’
‘burn hair or skin [of game]’
‘remove scales or skin [from fish/game]’ ‘break into pieces’
‘inquire’ ‘rub some substance on a surface; massage’ ‘break hard-shelled nuts [e.g. coconut, babaçú, etc.]’
‘make a mistake; miss [a target]’ ‘touch; mess with’ ‘wrap; involve [usu. inanimate] O in leaves, cloth, or paper’ ‘beat; punch; break’ ‘deny; renegate’ ‘be sexually aroused; horny’
‘murky; dirty’
‘being left behind; stand and wait’

The examples in (55) show some ku- stems compared with other, semantically related classificatory stems of the ka- class.

(55) kuБõ ‘wash hard objects’ kuco ‘peel’ kugђ ‘burn hair or skin’ kuke ‘remove scales or skin’ kukwҶ ‘break hard-shell nuts’

kaБõ
kaco kagђ kake kakwҶ

‘wash soft objects’ ‘tear; rip’ ‘make marks’ ‘pinch’ ‘dig; poke’

The fact that there are ka- counterparts to some ku- verbs is worthy of notice, as it gives us some indication of the semantics of the class. A hypothesis about the formative ku- is that it may have started out as the third person prefix (section 4.1.1), which

125
eventually got reanalysed as part of the stem. If that is true, then the semantic value of the ku- stems would be the same as the very root that served as a base, whereas the kastem would change based on the addition of the meaning of ka- as a derivational morpheme.

I- Verb Stems. Verb stems belonging to this class do not display much semantic transparency. Base roots identified for these stems are grђgrђ ‘be green (reduplicated)’ and tђc ‘be hard; robust’. Verbs of the i- class include mostly descriptives and transitives, such that there is a preference for absolutive person marking on stems from this set.
Like the ku- formative discussed above, it is possible that the i- observed in these verbs may have started out as a third person prefix which became reanalyzed as part of the stem. Additionally, as with the õ- formative described above, this morphological pattern is also observable in a large number of nominal stems.

iprѐr irђ irѐt

‘cut O in strands or chunks [of meat]’ ‘watch from above’ [see ‘shore; bank’] ‘be weak; exhausted; fatigued’

Õ- Verb Stems. Õ-verbs constitute a fairly transparent semantic class. The morpheme õrefers to the inner side of the body, as may be seen in most examples of the set (57). The meaning of this classificatory morpheme becomes most obvious when it occurs with nouns, which form a much larger õ- class than verbs. These verbs, as well as the nouns, take the relational prefix ْ-. Of the verbs below, the first three are descriptive; the fourth is a transitive, and the last is an intransitive.

õjairi õpatpat õpok õptҶ

‘be sleepy’
‘vomit’
‘feel nauseous’ ‘gut O; rip O’ ‘tumble, roll end over end; throw oneself into water or on ground’

Pia- Verb Stems. Pia- verbs also have to do with the body, and make more sense if piais thought of as a nominal component. Of the base roots occurring with these verbs, at least two are clearly identifiable: o ‘suck’ and gri ‘be small’. It is possible that ђm is a nonfinite form of such a movement verb as ‘enter’ (in which case the meaning

127
‘embarrassed’ would call for a metaphorical interpretation), except that in that case, one would expect the relational prefix c-, which does not occur.
Piagri ‘give birth’ is coherent with the semantic analysis pia+gri ‘body/womb+be small’ (which is definitely the case as one gives birth!); this analysis is supported by the morphological pattern for person inflection as well as the classification of the verb as a descriptive. Piao is also coherent in both semantic and morphosyntactic terms: pia+o ‘body+suck’, from the perspective of the child, should not require person marking on the stem, since the body belongs to the mother. Accordingly, piao is an intransitive verb (section 3.1.2.1).

(58) piao
piagri piaђm

‘nurse (on mother’s breast)’ ‘give birth’ ‘be shy/embarrassed’

< Бo ‘drink; suck’ < gri ‘be small’ < ђm ‘stand.NF’ (?)

Krђ- Verb Stems. Krђ-verbs also include a nominal component. The morpheme krђ, which may mean ‘head’, also encodes the more general notions of ‘spherical object; nugget; chunk’. The verb stems in which it occurs, below, are verbs of cutting which imply that a chunk falls off in the process. Krђ-verbs form a semantic class and display no idiosyncratic behavior.

(59) krђБ᭣r krђБta

‘cut; trim [of hair]’ ‘cut off; chop off’

< ta ‘cut’

128
Verb stems belonging to this class seem more like instances of noun incorporation, since krђ is a full-fledged noun of Apinajé. And if this hypothesis is correct, it would suit õ- verbs and pia- verbs equally well; however, there are no occurrences of õ and pia as regular noun roots in the database.
The next possibility, then, is that õ- and pia- verbs must have evolved historically from a noun-incorporation structure, with the incorporated noun later becoming reanalyzed as a frozen part of the stem (and disappearing from the language, elsewhere). One problem with this hypothesis is that no traits of relational prefixes can be observed in õ-, pia- and krђ- stems whose roots begin in a vowel. Relational prefixes would certainly occur in this context, if noun incorporation had in fact applied.
3.1.2.3.Lexical pairs Plural Stems vs. NonPlural Stems. Apinajé displays verb pairs which encode basically the same semantics, but contrast in the number of the absolutive argument. The contrast seems to lie in a distinction between plural, on the one hand, and singular, dual, or mass absolutives (termed here “non-plural”), on the other. Both bivalent verbs and monovalent verbs may have such pairs; in the case of monovalents, each member of the pair may come from a distinct class – intransitive and descriptive. Most such monovalent verb

129
pairs consist of movement and position verbs (60). Transitive verb pairs include a broader range of meanings, from position manipulation to ingestion, to killing (61).

130
The pair ku/kre encodes an interesting distinction: here, the contrast is not so much in quantity, but whether the absolutive argument consumes a diversified meal, consisting of servings of different foods (ku); or whether the participant ingests food of a single kind, regardless of the quantity or number (kre). Additionally, there is an independent distinction between these two stems, with the possibility of kre indicating a more perfective action, ‘swallow’, in some contexts, whereas ku is unmarked for that distinction.
The items te/mõ contrast with bra in terms of absolutive number: bra typically refers to a large number of persons walking together, wandering. On the other hand, te ‘go’and mõ ‘go (wandering)’ also contrast, the former indicating straighforward displacement, and the latter indicating a more slow-paced, maybe wandering, motion. Both te and mõ may occur in the non-singular, the number category then being indicated by the particles wa and mϯ (section 3.2.2.5). However, the stem bra seems less flexible in this respect: apparently, it refers necessarily to a collective band.
3.1.2.4.Derived verbs Intransitive a(C)- Verb Stems. The inventory of Apinajé intransitive verbs includes a large number of stems beginning with the vowel a-, usually with a following consonant, as in at-, aБ-, ap-; or glide, as in the sequence aw-, which consists of the detransitivizing morpheme a- plus the formative u- (section 3.1.2.2). For convenience, I refer to these

131

collectivelly as “middle prefixes” (see section 2.3.1). These are often prefixed to transitive verb stems, although they may occasionally appear in descriptive stems, as will be seen. The prefixed forms vary slightly, but their distribution is not phonologically determined, as different prefixes may occur in the same environments. Instead, the differences in shape indicate distinct meanings, despite the fact that all of them derive intransitive stems.
Verbs derived with a- create anticausative counterparts to their simple transitive causative stems. Verbs derived with at- encode middle voice; and verbs derived with aБ-, ap-, and a-w-, have either generic or impersonal patient semantics.

‘smell O’ ‘choose O; select O’ ‘eat O’ ‘sow O; plant O’ ‘smoke O’ ‘buy O’ ‘tell O’

132
The segment sequence aw- seems to consist of two morphemes, which becomes obvious in the nonfinite forms of verbs (section 4.3.1) in which they occur: in such cases, the detransitivizing prefix a- is removed, the morph u- is retained and the stem then requires the relational prefix c- (63).

c-u-j-apro c-u-j-areْ

This two-morpheme analysis seems more appropriate as a historical hypothesis, however, with the nonfinite stem being actually a suppletive form, since it is not possible to especify what the semantic value or morphosyntactic function of u- would be, synchronically. Notice that it does not even display the same morphological behavior as that of stems beginning with the formative u- (section 3.1.2.2).
While it is true that the sequence aw- occurs mostly with transitive stems beginning in /a/, its distribution is not so limited. Aw- also appears on two consonantinitial bases: the descriptive stems kagrѐ ‘be hot’ and r᭣ ‘be long’. The other descriptive stem with which aw- occurs is akr᭣ ‘cold’. The semantics of aw- in these forms appears to conform to that observed in transitive stems, i.e. the patient — here the sole argument — takes generic or impersonal semantics. If, on the one hand, each morpheme a- and uhas its own particular function, on the other, they must occur in combination in order to

133
convey the meaning observed in the examples, the nonfinite formal changes notwithstanding.

Certain intransitive stems beginning in a- do not have a transitive or descriptive counterpart. However, in nonfinite forms, a- is replaced with pi-, which makes asegmentable and comparable to the forms introduced in (62-64). Some of these verbs may undergo vowel deletion and resyllabification in their nonfinite form ( see section 4.1.3. for further details).

Other intransitives that also lack a descriptive or transitive counterpart are verbs whose nonfinite forms retain the marker a-, instead of substituting for pi-. Deletion and resyllabification may apply here as well.

Descriptive a(C)- Verb Stems. Besides intransitives, some descriptive verbs also take the prefix a-. Their counterparts include intransitives and noncanonical monovalent verbs (section IV.2.3). One of the examples appears to have a noun root as its counterpart; in another example the shape of the prefix is ђ-, not a-, and the counterpart is a denominal transitive verb.

Resultative verbs. Resultative verbs are a subset of descriptives which derive from the nonfinite form of certain transitive verbs. Although nonfinite forms are productive, it seems that only some of these serve as bases for resultatives. In addition, morphology that would otherwise apply to specific formal classes of intransitives may occur in verbs outside that membership, for the purpose of resultative-verb formation (72).
In the examples below, (71.a) illustrates nonfinite formation with the consonant suffix, and (71.b) shows the replacement of aC- with pi-, along with suffixation. (71.c) is an instance of deletion, also common in nonfinite formation, although morphs that delete elsewhere are either aC-, iC-, or the first segment of verbs, and never a syllable of like /kat/. (71.d) is an instance of nonfinite formation with no change in the base.
In (72), on the other hand, the prefix pi- applies to verbs that do not begin in aC-, an uncommon fact elsewhere. One more anomaly, in comparing resultatives with other instances of nonfinite forms, is that a word-final -i attaches to some forms (71.a); this does not happen elsewhere.

Denominal Verb Stems. Nouns can serve as bases for the creation of transitive, intransitive, and descriptive verb stems. Common strategies for denominal verb formation are conversion, vowel alternation, and prefixation of a- (see section 2.3).

Compound Verb Stems. Descriptive and transitive verbs may be compound stems consisting of combinations of a verbal root and a nominal root, or a verbal root and a locative postposition (section 2.3).

139
Reduplication Verb Stems. Reduplication is frequently employed in the creation of descriptives (details in section 2.3).
3.1.3. Postpositions Postpositions constitute a (rather large) closed class in Apinajé. Postpositions occur postposed to their object noun phrase or, in the absence of an overt dependent noun phrase, they inflect for person in the same way as Verbs and Nouns. The set of person prefixes used is the same for all three lexical categories, as is the complementary distribution between prefixes and noun phrases.
The fact that Postposition is viewed here as a lexical category might seem at odds with the fact that postpositions are function words. However, even though a clear set of standard postpositions (monosyllabic, high frequency of use, with more grammatical than lexical meaning) does exist in the language, other members of this category seem more like postpositions-in-the-making, evolving from a class of nouns that I will term here “relator nouns.” For that reason, it is almost innaccurate to speak of postpositions in Apinajé as constituting a closed class; perhaps this might be best described as a “halfway open” class.
Relator nouns are lexemes whose semantics extend metaphorically into grammatical meanings related to space orientation and position. Typically, relator nouns are body part terms, or part-whole terms which pattern as inalienable nouns in languages that make this distinction (DeLancey 1997). This kind of diachronic development is

140 fairly common crosslinguistically. In Apinajé, it is possible to observe, at the synchronic level, hints of the grammaticalization of some nouns into postpositions, as will be seen.
Although there seems to exist a tendency for postpositions to evolve from nouns in Apinajé, there is at least one instance of a postposition having a verb as its diachronic source. That is the case of the instrumental postposition ѐ and the verb ѐ ‘do’ (Oliveira 1998).
The set of grammatical postpositions and some selected relator nouns are introduced in what follows.
Fully grammaticalized postpositions of Apinajé include the genitive õ, dative mђ, detrimentive pe, instrumental ѐ, associative me, locatives tar and ђ, inessive kamђ, allative wђr, ablative rum, positionals kot ‘after; behind’ and itep ‘near’, and similitive acwҶj. Morphologically complex stems are kamђ, itep, and acwҶj, which include the formatives ka-, i- and a-, respectively. The genitive postposition õ has the same shape as the formative õ- ‘inner side; core’ found in nouns and verbs.
Genitive õ. The genitive marker õ behaves very much like other postpositions of Apinajé.

Traditionally, the marker of alienable possession o has been analyzed in many Jê languages as the noun for ‘thing’ (cf. e.g. Ribeiro (2004) and references therein). Even though this may be true from a diachronic point of view, evidence indicates that synchronically this is not the case in Apinajé. This morpheme õ – not to be confused with the indefinite article õ – is limited in distribution to genitive constructions: it does not occur anywhere as an independent lexical item. In addition, there are other words that presently encode the meaning ‘thing’: bѐj ‘thing’ and kukre ‘belongings’ (76.a-b).

Dative mђ. The dative postposition mђ also indicates the benefactive and may operate as allative or locative, as is crosslinguistically common. Besides occurring with noun phrases, the dative postposition is also used as a subordinator in purpose clauses (section IV.2.2).

142
The third person form of this marker presents a morphological peculiarity, however. If the referent is expressed by a full noun phrase, then the postposition maintains its bare form and co-occurs with the noun, which is in consonance with the behavior of other postpositions (77.a). On the other hand, with a pronominal third person referent, the form is kђm (77.b).

b. iْ-mђ a-mђ kђm

‘to/for me’ ‘to/for you’ ‘to/for him/her’

Detrimentive pe. The detrimentive (often called malefactive) postposition pe basically indicates detriment to its object; another, more space-oriented meaning encoded by this postposition is the ablative.

(78) O:na kafϯ ic-pe ic-c-e

ђ atkapi

EXCL coffee 1-DTR 1-RP-fabric LOC spill

‘Dammit! The coffee spilled on my clothes [to my detriment].’

Like the dative, the detrimentive marker pe has a suppletive third person pronominal form, kep. These two postpositions are the only ones in my database that display this idiosyncrasy.

143

(79) ic-pe a-pe kep

‘from me; to my detriment’ ‘from you; to your detriment’ ‘from him/her; to his/her detriment’

Irregularities call for historical explanations. As shown in section 3.2.1, the third person prefix ku- occurs almost exclusively with verbs, indicating the accusative argument of transitives; but there is at least one instance of occurrence of ku- with a postposition, namely, the ablative rum. Given this precedent, it seems plausible to hypothesize that the third person pronominal forms of the dative and detrimentive may have started out as ku-mђ and ku-pe, respectively, at a stage in which ku- must have been more productively used with postpositions.8 Eventually, it must have fallen in disuse; the unusual but highly frequent forms kumђ and kupe underwent phonological modifications, presumably vowel harmony first (i.e. kђmђ, kepe) and word-final vowel deletion next, which led to the present-day forms.

Instrumental ѐ. The postposition ѐ indicates instrumental and, when taking human objects, has associative semantics. The relational prefix t- occurs with an overt noun phrase object and with personal prefixes. This morpheme is homophonous to the
8 It could also be that the postpositions rum, mђ and pe come historically from verbs.

144 morphological causative, and both may have had the same etymological source, the verb
ѐ ‘do’ (Oliveira 1998; sections 3.2.2.7 and IV.4.6.2).

Associative me. The associative me is not as frequent in the database as the instrumental ѐ, used for the same purpose. There appears to be a slight semantic distinction between the two, as witnessed by translations provided by the speakers: while ѐ means ‘with’, me means ‘along with; in addition to’. This may not be that significant a distinction, however; and it seems as though the former is gradually replacing the latter in terms of frequency of use, though this is just a speculative remark. Structurally, the associative postposition requires the presence of the dual marker wa in the clause (further syntactic details are in section IV.2.1).

Locative tar. Although it has semantic content typical of postpositions, the morpheme tar has distribution that is considerably more restricted than that of other postpositions. For that reason, the analysis of this morpheme as a member of this class is still tentative, until further evidence comes to light.
Tar occurs with the personal prefixes of first and second person, as well as with the morpheme mu, resulting in proximal and distal demonstratives, respectively. The
semantic contrasts between ictar [1-LOC], atar [2-LOC] and mutar [DEM.DST-LOC] lie basically in difference of deictic center (namely, first, second, and third persons), which is thus overtly expressed. Of the resulting forms, only the one with the second person prefix occurs as a pronoun (section 3.2.1).

Locative ђ. The locative ђ (which takes the relational prefix t-) occurs less frequently in noun phrases than it does in temporal expressions (section 3.1.4). This morpheme may also operate at the discourse level, serving as a grammatical connector of the events

146
expressed in discourse (section V.5); and it may occur in some of the postpositional expressions involving relator nouns, as will be seen.

Allative wђr. Unlike the postpositions just introduced, the allative wђr appears to occur

Ablative rum. The ablative rum is not as frequent as pe ‘detrimentive’, which may also express this notion. Like the allative wђr, the ablative is less flexible in its meaning and distribution than other postpositions, such that its semantics seems to be limited to the domain of space. Rum is the only postposition in my database that may take the third person prefix ku-; this may indicate that this postposition is more conservative than mђ ‘dative’or pe ‘detrimentive’, since here the person prefix has not crammed its way into the base stem (86).

Positionals kot and itep. The postpositions kot ‘behind; after’ and itep ‘near’ indicate relative position between referents. Of the two, the postposition itep resembles relator nouns due to its form, since the occurrence of the formative i- has been observed in a number of such nouns. The formative i- is also common in nouns other than these, most of which, crucially, refer to body parts (section 3.1.1.2; compare also with kutep, section V.5.2).

Similitive acwҶj. The postposition acwҶj ‘likewise; too’ is a category that pertains structurally to the noun phrase, being thus a counterpart of mђnen ‘also; likewise’, which is an adverbial element that operates at the clause level (section IV.2.3). This postposition takes the relational prefix j- and interacts with the switch-reference system of Apinajé in interesting ways.

Relator nouns. Apinajé makes extensive use of relator nouns to express more detailed nuances of space relations. Most of the instances found in the corpus also involve the use of postpositions, resulting in fixed, compound expressions where specific postpositions and relator nouns associate. The inventory of postpositions noted in these cases is broad, although it seems to exclude the associative me, the allative wђr, and the ablative rum.
The inventory of relator nouns found in the database includes those listed in (88). Notice the use of the postpositions ђ ‘locative’, kamђ ‘inside’, pe ‘detrimental/ablative’,

149
kot ‘after; behind’, as compared to the particle ri ‘demonstrative’, which has semantic content typical of postpositions, but does not display their morphological characteristics.

3.1.4. Adverbials The set of adverbials includes morphologically simple and complex items, and expressions carrying adverbial meaning or function. Adverbials constitute another one of those almost closed classes which nevertheless seems somewhat open and expansive, since adverbial meanings may come in phrases and other larger constituents. Some members of this class are temporal adverbs, location adverbs, intensifiers and a temporal negative adverbial, discussed here.
Adverbs are phonological/grammatical words that are characterized morphologically by lack of inflection. Their distribution in the sentence depends on the kind of adverbial function they perform. Temporal and location adverbs seem more

151
syntactically free than other adverbs. Intensifiers are positional clitics, as is the temporal negative adverbial. Some of these are introduced next.

Temporal Adverbs. The temporal adverbs jђ ‘yesterday’, jarђБђ ‘today’ and rђБђ ‘always’ are based on the morpheme ђ, which could be the locative postposition, only with its original semantics extended metaphorically into a temporal notion. If that is the case, it is possible that the glide-initial component of the first two stems is the definite article ja performing a demonstrative function (section 3.2.1). As for the component rђ, one could imagine it as the real temporal index in the stem, possibly meaning ‘now’.

Temporal Negative Adverbial. The expression a... ket=ne ‘never’ consists of the proclitic a, which could be translated as ‘ever’ but has not been observed elsewhere independently from this expression, and the negative enclitic ket=ne, which is a clause final clitic sequence. The two elements circumscribe the proposition being negated, often expressed as an embedded clause. For its distributional properties, this adverbial expression could be described as a “circumclitic.”

Intensifiers. Apinajé intensifiers serve primarily as modifiers of the predicate, but all of them also carry adjectival semantics, like descriptive verbs do, and may modify nouns as well. The distinguishing property between intensifiers and descriptives, apart from the primary functions each of them performs in the syntax of Apinajé, is the range of morphological categories they each take. While descriptives take person and relational prefixes, intensifiers take no inflectional morphology.
At the other end, at least one descriptive root has been observed to perform the function of an intensifier: the morpheme bϯc distinctively finds its way into the class of “true” intensifiers, albeit from a functional point of view. Under such circumstances, one

153
could think of this distribution of bϯc in terms of conversion – derivation from one class to another without the use of overt morphological marking.
Because of their semantics and (in part) their function, intensifiers would make good candidates for a closed class of adjectives, in Apinajé. The structural and functional properties of intensifiers are discussed in what follows.

The morpheme tђc has the basic lexical meanings of ‘be hard; tense, stiff, rigid; robust’. It may occur in predicate position (95.a), or modifying predicates, in which case it may itself be modified by the additional intensifier kumrϯc (95.b-c) The use of tђc with descriptive predicates implies a reading in which the predicator encodes a transitional or temporary condition or state (95.d), and in this respect it contrasts with ruْ ‘plenty; grand’and raci ‘large’.

This morpheme is transparently related to itђc ‘be strong’, which is a descriptive stem in all respects: it inflects for person, in which case it takes the relational prefix c-; and operates as a predicator, though it may be a noun modifier, as other descriptives. Both tђc and itђc display a high front echo-vowel, in agreement with the word final palatal consonant

It may occur as a noun modifier, and in compound noun stems, such as go rac ‘river’ (lit.: “water=large”) and kri rac ‘city’ (“sitting=large”). As a modifier of the predicate, it may be further modified by kumrϯc. Similarly to ruْ, and in contrast to tђjc, this marker usually modifies predicators which encode a permanent property (97.c), in addition to more eventive ones (97.d-e). Structurally, this morpheme never appears inflected or derived, in my database; it occurs only in its bare form.
One morphosyntactic property of raci that is worthy of notice is that, this morpheme modifies descriptive verbs derived with the morpheme -ji. In this respect, it contrasts with ruْ, which does not suit that purpose (97.b). Additionally, evidence

155
indicates that, if used with a transitive verb, this morpheme may refer to the quantity of the direct object (97.d-e), even though it appears syntactically as an intensifier of the verb.

The morpheme ruْ has the lexical meanings ‘plenty; grand; many [times]’. Like rac, which also has quantifying semantics, this morpheme also occurs in compounds, such as mϯõkrϯpoj ruْti, the name of a traditional festival (98.a). The use of ruْ also implies permanent reading to a property encoded in a descriptive predicate (98.b-c). On the other hand, with active or eventive verbs ruْ tends to imply repetitive action or frequency in the occurrence of a particular action or event (98.d).

156
This morpheme shares a phonological property with rac, in that it undergoes lateralization after coronal segments; it is pronounced as [luْ] (section II.4.2). However, ruْ does not display the stem-final alternation common to both raci and tђci; its form is invariant in this respect.
Also in contrast with rac, the morpheme ruْ does not occur with predicatos derived by -ji.

The morpheme bϯc is a descriptive verb (99.a). However, it may be used as an intensifier on occasion, especially as a modifier of other descriptive verbs. Its semantics in these contexts is ‘very; well’, which is reminiscent of its basic, descriptive semantics ‘good; pretty’. This verb may itself be modified by kumrϯc as well.

Of the set of intensifiers observed in the database, the morpheme kumrϯc is the intensifier with the most character, as it is the only one that can modify the others. Kumrϯc occurs postposed to the predicate it modifies (100).

Interestingly, this morpheme may occur with nouns as well, but not in an adjectival function. What it does in these contexts is to indicate the first referent in a

3.2. Grammatical categories 3.2.1. Pronouns The pronominal system of Apinajé includes person, demonstrative, indefinite and interrogative pronouns. These are introduced next.
Person Pronouns. Person pronouns are positional clitics. They occupy second position in a main clause, thus contrasting with person prefixes, which come attached to a stem. Person pronouns indicate the nominative argument of a sentence, whereas prefixes express the absolutive (section 4.1.1).

159
Person pronouns encode the first, second and third persons. The first person includes the hortative and plural inclusive distinctions (other number disctincitons are not expressed in the pronominal system as such; instead, they are encoded by number clitics; see section 3.2.2.5 below). There are two sets of person pronouns, one for the realis mode and the other for the irrealis. The same form of the pronoun is used for first person pronoun and first person plural inclusive, but with different syntactic distribution (Table III.1).

In pragmatically unmarked use, the pronoun participates in a clitic sequence that includes the mood marker in first position and possibly a tense/aspect clitic that carries stress in the group. Such sequences of clitics constitute phonological words (sections 1.3 and 2.1). Because the pronoun never bears stress in this context, plosives occurring in pronouns display voice alternation in the same way as unstressed syllables in other phonological words.

In pragmatically marked use, a token of the pronoun occurs outside the clitic sequence; in fact, it precedes the sequence clause initially. When the pronoun is thus placed under focus, it is stressed, and morpheme initial plosives are necessarily voiceless. Notice that only the realis form of pronouns participates in this strategy.

Although it is frequently true that the same pronoun is presented twice in the clause – once for focus and once as the nominative –, as shown in (104), that is not necessarily the case: the pronoun/referent in focus position may be distinct from that in nominative position (105).

Personal pronouns participate in the expression of mood, a category that is obligatorily expressed in the clause. First and second person pronouns take the suffix -j to indicate irrealis mood; thus, two series of speech-act-participant pronouns surface because of this distinction (106). The irrealis form of the pronoun typically co-occurs with the mood marker kѐt in the beginning of the sentence (sections 3.2.2.1 and IV.2.1). However, if the mood particle is omitted, the presence of the pronoun suffices to indicate the relevant category (106.b, d).

The third person pronoun ђm is easily omitted in realis contexts (107.a-b). In irrealis contexts, however, the third person is overtly and necessarily encoded by ja, which occurs immediately postposed to the irrealis marker kѐt (107.c). The presence of the irrealis morpheme is also mandatory in this case. The third person (demonstrative) pronoun ja is realized alternatively as [da] or [ra], the initial coronal segment resulting from assimilation to the coronal coda of the mood clitic kѐt (107).

Emphatic forms of personal pronouns. Non-hortative personal pronouns display emphatic forms. Emphatic first and second person pronouns include an oral open vowel

163
and the suffix -m in root-final position; the stem initial plosive is always voiceless, since the pronoun carries discourse stress. The emphatic third person pronoun is also realized with an open vowel. The inventory of emphatic personal pronouns as compared to their nonemphatic counterparts is listed in table III.2. The example in (108) is illustrative.

Indefinite pronouns. The indefinite pronouns ْђm ‘[someone; somewhere] else’ and mϯБõ ‘someone’, waБõ ‘someone’ have the alternating forms ْam and mϯБu, waБu respectively. The reason for the alternation between ْђm and ْam is not clear yet, although this form may be related diachronically to the third person pronoun ђm; but this is only a conjecture that needs to be confirmed with historical evidence.

164

The alternation between mϯБõ, waБõ and mϯБu, waБu appears to be phonetically motivated; these pronouns seem to result of a combination of the indefinite pronoun õ with each of the number markers mϯ and wa.
In addition to these two pronouns, the form mϯbѐj ‘something’ also consists of two morphemes, the plural/nonreferential marker mϯ plus bѐj ‘thing’. This form also serves as an interrogative pronoun, as will be seen.

Demonstrative pronouns. Demonstrative pronouns observed in the database are ja, muj, neْ, and stems formed with the deitic tar. The latter morpheme occurs in the demonstratives ictar ‘here’, atar ‘there.PRX’ and mutar ‘there.DST’. Although the morpheme tar is morphologically and semantically comparable to postpositions, in that it

165
takes person inflection and is deictic in nature, its distribution is restricted to the lexical items just presented; that is, tar does not occur productively as head of postpositional phrases. In addition, its semantic content is not transparent, if analyzed in isolation.
The word ja has the primary function of a definite article within a noun phrase; muj and atar are demonstratives that operate either as full pronouns or as determiners of the noun. The present section focuses on the pronominal role of these markers. For details about their function, distribution, and morphological properties within the noun phrase, see section IV.2.1. The forms ictar and mutar are used mostly as locatives and are not discussed here.
The semantic contrast between ja and muj is that the former operates as a proximal demonstrative pronoun, while the latter is a distal demonstrative. When in demonstrative function, ja is typically stressed; thus, the root-initial glide /j/ is realized as a voiced alveo-palatal fricative [z]. Ja does not seem to carry any specification as to a particular deictic center: it may indicate a referent close to both speaker and listener, away from both, or close to either one or the other. On the other hand, muj and atar do each refer to a particular deictic center.
The demonstrative muj ‘that’, which has the alternate form mu (apparently phonologically motivated), points to a referent away from listener and speaker. Atar ‘that [close to you]’ consists of the second person prefix a- and the deictic morpheme tar. The presence of the second person prefix is overt indication of the deictic center for this demonstrative.

166
The demonstrative morpheme neْ appears only in pronominal function in the database; it could be characterized semantically as a “medio-distal” demonstrative, and it does not seem to have any specifications for a particular deictic center.

Interrogative Pronouns. Interrogative pronouns introduce information questions. Most interrogative words noted in the database are either compounds that include verbal or postpositional roots, or they are morphologically complex in some other way. However, monomorphemic interrogative words do occur, as well as periphrastic expressions.
Monomorphemic interrogative words include bѐ, and its variant bѐj ‘what [is s.t.]’; and dѐ, with the variant dѐk ‘where [is s.t.]’. The former is homophonous with the word for ‘thing’, and the latter with the word for ‘eye’. These may optionally co-occur with other elements, thus highlighting a particular aspect of the question. In (107.c), for

167
instance, the pronoun bѐj co-occurs with the purpose marker kac᭣w, placing some emphasis on the reason for the event or action.

Among bimorphemic interrogative words are included the indefinite pronouns waБõ and mϯБõ, used also as interrogative pronouns. The occurrence of the dual marker in waБõ ‘who’ might suggest the meaning ‘which one’ for this pronoun; however, mϯБõ and waБõ ‘who’seem to share the same meaning; if there is any semantic difference, it is not an obvious one.

168
The bimorphemic interrogative pronoun taْmђ ‘how’ consists of the form taْ plus the dative postposition =mђ. It has not been possible to identify the specific meaning of the morph tђْ, as it seems to be unique to this word. It may be better analyzed as a formative, rather than as a full-fledged morpheme.

The other morphemes are ri ‘locative’ (a form related to ari ‘stay’), -᭣m ‘centrifugal motion’ and -᭣ْ ‘centripetal motion’. The latter two suffixes have been observed in other locative/directional bases as well, as illustrated by the pair akup-᭣m ‘return here (i.e. away from deictic center and back)’ and akup-᭣ْ ‘return there (i.e. towards deictic center and back)’.

Other interrogatives are expressions consisting of more than one word. The expression per apu ‘why’ consists of one clitic, per, which has been noted to occur on its

169
own in other environments, with epistemic semantic nuance, as in ‘it looks like [x]’. Other uses of the morpheme apu still remain to be identified. The expression may come accompanied by an extra interrogative pronoun, as illustrated in (115).

All these interrogative pronouns occur at the beginning of the clause, preceding the mood marker. Depending on the discourse context, however, they may themselves be preceded by conjunctions or other categories of that sort. Besides interrogative pronouns, which introduce information questions, there is a question clitic that introduces polarity questions in Apinajé; this morpheme is discussed in section IV.3.2.

3.2.2. Clitics Much of Apinajé grammatical categories is expressed by clitics – positional, phrasal, and word clitics. Some clitics bear stress while others are stress dependent; some clitics may form sequences or even serve as bases for morphologically complex stems. In the following subsections, some of the most frequently used positional, phrasal and word clitics of Apinajé are introduced.

170
3.2.2.1.Mood The distinction between realis and irrealis mood is overtly and obligatorily expressed in Apinajé propositions, thus subcategorizing verbal clauses into two morphosyntactic sets.

Realis. Realis clauses are introduced by the clause-initial clitic na, which indicates initial boundary thus serving as landmark for discourse-related operations, such as focus or cleft constructions. The realis domain includes present, past, and habitual propositions.
(116) Na ic-pe ku-bђ RLS 1-DTR 3.ACC-grab ‘He took it from me.’

Irrealis. Irrealis clauses are introduced by the clause-initial clitic kѐt which, like the realis marker, indicates initial boundary. The irrealis domain includes future, hypothetical, counterfactual and conditional propositions. The irrealis marker requires the use of the corresponding set of person pronouns (section 3.2.1).

3.2.2.2.Tense The positional clitic prϯ indicates past tense. It carries its own stress and heads a phonological word formed by a clitic sequence. In the clause, it follows a person pronoun, or precedes a nominative noun phrase.

3.2.2.4.Movement Movement verbs unspecified for direction, such as mõ, te, bra and so on, require the occurrence in the clause of a movement particle that specifies whether the motion is centripetal or centrifugal.9 This particle is the positional clitic ma, which occurs in the same general area of the clause as the other positional clitics.
(121) a. Na pa ra ma mõ. rls 1 pfv mov go ‘I’m going away.’
b. Na pa ra mõ. rls 1 asp go ‘I’ve come.’
3.2.2.5.Number The category of number comprises the singular, dual and plural distinctions, for nouns and verbs. Overt morphemes that express these categories are positional clitics – wa ‘dual’ and mϯ ‘plural’ – that occur preposed to nouns and verbs.
Number clitics most often modify person pronouns and person prefixes, occurring adjacent to the pronominal element they modify. They form a clitic sequence with
9 The terms centripetal and centrifugal correspond, respectively, to such terms as “venitive” and “andative”, or “cislocative” and “translocative”, used in the linguistic literature for the expression of movement/direction notions. The choice for centripetal and centrifugal to be employed throughout the dissertation follows the terminological tradition of South American literature on Macro-Jê languages.

person pronouns, occurring postposed to them, different from their distribution elsewhere. This is illustrated in (122) with the hortative first person pronoun.

(122) Mϯ a-kri

[pu mϯ] pa kri.

PL 2-sit.PL

HORT PL 1.INCL sit.PL

‘Have a seat, you all, let’s have a seat and gather.’

Only the plural clitic mϯ appears as a noun modifier; the dual clitic wa doesn’t. In this context, the clitic indicates the initial boundary of the noun phrase.

(123) mϯ di PL woman

jaja DEF.ART.RDPL

‘the women’

The plural marker mϯ may indicate nonreferentiality, on occasion, a fact that is better observed at the phrase (and discourse) level (section IV.2.1). The clitics mϯ ‘plural’ and wa ‘dual’ may also participate in compounding. For instance, they combine with the indefinite article õ to form the indefinite pronouns mϯБõ ‘someone’ and waБõ ‘someone’.

3.2.2.6.Reflexive and Reciprocal Reflexive and reciprocal markers are word proclitics. They have the same distribution as person prefixes in any of the lexical classes Noun, Verb and Postposition. Unlike person prefixes, however, reflexive and reciprocal clitics carry stress, thus forming a

174
phonological word on their own. Together with the stem, the clitics form what I have been calling a phonological phrase that is equivalent to a grammatical word.
Details about the occurrence of the reflexive and reciprocal clitics with each Verb, Noun and Postposition are given next.

Verbs. The nominative argument of a simple verbal clause controls reflexivization and reciprocity. One target of reflexivization is the direct object of a transitive clause. In this case, the reflexive marker amْi occupies the direct object position slot in the verb phrase, in which case the verb may take a relational prefix if vowel initial. Compare the examples (a-b) below.

(124) a. Kaprђnrϯ na ic-pe iБ-tu kakre.

RLS 1-DTR 1-belly scratch

‘The turtle scratched my belly [to my detriment].’

b. Pa na pa amْi kakre.

‘I’ve scratched myself.’

‘I body-painted you.’

b. Pa na pa amْi j-ok.

1 RLS 1

RFLX RP-body.paint

‘I body-painted my own self.’

175
The reciprocal marker has the same distribution in the verb phrase as the reflexive marker; likewise, it may target the accusative argument of a transitive clause. However, at least at the semantic level, the reciprocal marks both the subject relation, which controls the process, and the object relation, which is the target, since the reciprocal relation must include at least two referents.

(126) a. Ka na ka iْ-me

2 RLS 2

1-trip

‘You tripped me [caused me to fall].’

b. Pa na pa wa atpe=me

1 RLS 1

DU RCPR=trip

‘It was the two of us that tripped each other [caused each other to fall].’

In bitransitive clauses, an oblique participant may also be a target of either reflexivization and reciprocity.

Nouns. Apinajé exhibits instances of reflexive possession. In a transitive clause, the strategy applies when the argument directly affected in the event is a body part of the subject (127). Reflexive possession does not apply with other inalienable nouns, however, such as kinship terms (128).

(127) a. Kѐt paj amْi krђ ki IRLS 1.IRLS RFLX head hair ‘I’ll wash my hair.’

kaБõ. wash

b. Kѐt paj amni kuk IRLS 1.IRLS RFLX face ‘I’ll wash my face.’

kuБõ. wash

176

(128) Kѐt paj iБ-kra

tϯ kuБõ.

IRLS 1.IRLS 1-child

leg wash

‘I will wash my son’s legs.’

There are no examples of the reciprocal marker occurring with nouns, although it does not seem odd to imagine the use of atpe in a nominal context such as “They touched each other’s arms” and “We are each other’s bothers,” for instance. This hypothesis awaits verification.

Postpositions. As mentioned previously, oblique participants are targets of reflexivization controlled by the subject. In cases of oblique reflexivization, the reflexive pronoun attaches to the relevant postposition, which may occur with a relational prefix, as needed. Among all postpositions, the dative frequently allows for phonological truncation, being realized simply as a bilabial nasal consonant in word-final position. In this case, the stress of the reflexive clitic is the relevant one in the phonological word. Compare (129.a-b).

Reciprocity also targets obliques, as illustrated in (130), as well as the second argument of noncanonical verbs (section IV.3.3.2.). Notice that the number particle applies to the reciprocal marker in the same way as it does with other pronouns (131132).

3.2.2.7.Causative The morphological causative is expressed by the word proclitic ѐ, which attaches directly to the descriptive or intransitive verb stem. This clitic does not carry stress; it submits to the overall word stress.

3.2.2.9. Ergative Ergativity is a category expressed exclusively in the context of subordination in Apinajé. The ergative markers tϯ and kѐt are positional clitics that introduce the subordinated ergative clause; they indicate the initial boundary of the clause. The clitic tϯ is used with speech act participants and takes person marking; the clitic kѐt is used with third persons and does not take inflection (see chapter v).

The clitics of degree are word enclitics. They carry stress, which superposes to the stress of the word to which it attaches (section 2.3.6, example (30)).

3.2.2.11. Evidentiality The notion ‘hearsay information’ is expressed in Apinajé by the clitic cϯp (which apparently may take an echo-vowel, thus undergoing segmental alternation and being realized as cϯwϯ). This clitic is often introduced in the general positional clitic area where tense-aspect markers are found. But that is not necessarily so; this clitic has much freer distribution than any of the other clitics presented here.

4. Morphology 4.1. Inflectional categories
4.1.1. Person The category of person is expressed by roughly the same set of prefixes in three distinct lexical categories: Verbs, Nouns, and Postpositions. For that reason, person inflection is not the best criterion for delimiting parts-of-speech in Apinajé; syntactic facts must be taken into account also. Indeed, some of the strongest evidence for distinguishing

180
between Nouns and Verbs, and Postpositions comes from syntax (chapter IV; Oliveira 2003).

Person inflection occupies the most external morphological slot in a word. Person prefixes encode first, second, and third persons, that refer to the objects of Postpositions, the possessor in Nouns, and the absolutive arguments of Verbs. There are three third person prefixes: ku-, i- and Ø-. The zero prefix is the only one used with all three word classes. The prefix ku- occurs exclusively with transitive verbs (there is one instance of ku- with a postposition) and the prefix i-, very marginally, with nouns. The accusative prefix ku- has further distributional restrictions: it occurs exclusively with the finite form

181
of verbs, only in monosyllabic stems, and is employed when the accusative noun phrase is not contiguous to the verb, but elsewhere in the clause (section IV.2.3).
The nonfinite form of a verb performs a more nominal role in the syntax (section IV.2.1). The set of prefixes employed with nonfinite forms is reduced, as compared to that of finite verb forms, because only the third person zero prefix (not ku-) may occur.
The third person form i- does not occur very frequently. Although the occurrence of i- seems to coincide consistently with the absence of a dependent noun phrase contiguous to the head noun (137), Ø- may also appear in this context (138). It seems, then, that the use of i- is lexically, rather than phonologically or grammatically, motivated.

The prefixes i- and ku- are also found as formatives in stems from all three classes. There is a set each of noun, verb and postposition stems that include the formative i- (sections 3.1.1.2 and 3.1.2.2). The formative ku- does not seem to occur on postpositions, except – hypothetically – as the source of the suppletive forms found in some postposition paradigms. The distinction between person prefixes as productive morphology and i- and ku- as formatives resides in the fact that stems containing either of these formatives may be inflected for (any) person.
An accusative person prefix is in complementary distribution with its referent noun phrase, as seen above. The pattern with descriptives seems more like one of agreement, since both the prefix and an independent pronoun indicate the same referent in the clause (section IV.2.3); however, it is the prefix that actually encodes the argument of a descriptive: in casual speech, the independent pronoun may be omitted, but not the prefix (see chapter IV).
4.1.2. Relational Prefixes Relational prefixes constitute another morphological category common to Nouns,
Verbs, and Postpositions. These morphemes are overt indices of the constituency between a head and a dependent element. In formal terms, relational prefixes serve as linkers between a given root and some element that immediately attaches to it, including certain derivational morphemes (139.a), personal prefixes (139.b) or, at a more syntactic level, dependent noun phrases ((139.c); see section IV.1). The role of relational prefixes

183
is precisely to indicate this bond between units that belong together, either as constituents within a phrase, or as the component morphemes of a word, even compounds (139.d-e).

e. kupe=c-e non.Indian=RP-tie

‘go shopping <INTR>’ ‘my tongue’ ‘in the core of the forest’ ‘morissoca (insect, sp.)’ ‘fabric’

Historically, the occurrence of relational prefixes must have been phonologically motivated, with the proto-form having been a coronal – presumably palatal – segment (Davis 1966; Ribeiro 2004), whose reflexes in present-day Apinajé includes some six different forms. In addition to those, there are elements beginning in a bilabial stop that display distribution and function similar to those of relational prefixes; however, in addition to form, other idiosyncrasies indicate that these morphemes must have evolved historically from a distinct source.

184
Verbs. Relational prefixes occur in the finite forms of transitive and descriptive verbs, but only in the nonfinite forms of intransitive verbs, which do not take person marking in any other environment.
The inventories of relational prefixes for transitives and descriptives are very similar: they consist mostly of coronal segments, although both also include a few instances of the segment p- as applied to u-initial stems. The examples in (140) illustrate the range of relational prefixes observed in transitive and descriptive verbal stems.

The inventory of relational prefixes for intransitive verbs also includes coronal elements, but – crucially – only intransitive verbs display the form pi-, which applies to base stems beginning with a specific middle prefix. The set of relational prefixes observed in intransitive verbs is displayed in (141). Notice how distinct the pattern is from the other two sets: not only does pi- occur exclusively in this set, but it seems to be the preferred choice. The stem acquires a consonant-initial form, once pi- has been attached to it.

Perhaps the most conspicuous alternation involving relational prefixes is that resulting from the loss of a(C)- in stem initial position and its replacement with the formative pi-; resyllabification may apply, as demonstrated in (142.a). This state of affairs indicates that, even though pi- has a distribution similar to relational prefixes, it is not a member of this class, but rather a morphological component that serves to indicate a category pertaining to the class of intransitive verbs itself (reason why I consider it to be a the “pseudo-relational prefix”). The semantic value of this category is not clear, however.

To summarize, the distribution of other relational prefixes is as follows: j- occurs before /a, ѐ, o, i/; c-, before /u, i, Ҷ, ѩ, ђ, e, ѐ/; ْ-, before /õ, i, i/; t-, before /ѐ, ђ/; and p-, before /u, u, ѐ/ (142). The occurrence of the latter prefix, which may also have originated historically from a distinct source, coincides with vowel alternations in certain stems: a vowel /u/ is realized as /᭣/, in some stems, and as /ѐ/ in a few others (142.e). This steminitial u- is in fact a formative that occurs with a small set of stems, characterizing two morphological classes (section 3.1.2.2).

Nouns. The inventory of prefixes observed in nouns is similar to that of transitives and descriptives; however, here there is a preference for the nasal palatal segment ْ-, whereas in the other two samples the preference was for the palatal glide.

Postpositions. The set of relational prefixes used in postpositions is not based on a generous sample, since postpositions constitute a quasi-closed class. However, the examples below should suffice to illustrate the variations.

The examples above indicate that the variation in the form of prefixes results in part from the presence of formatives such as i-, u-, and õ-, found in each stem class.

4.1.3. Nonfiniteness Nonfiniteness is an inflectional category that pertains exclusively to verbs. Nonfinite verb forms are the most nominal form of verbs: they are required in subordination and similar syntactic contexts, as well as in various instances of nominalization.
Nonfinite verb forms are characteristically distinct from the base. The changes in form may be subcategorized into three patterns, to be introduced shortly. However, it is not uncommon for the nonfinite counterpart of a verb to remain unchanged. Descriptive verbs are the most stable in this respect, followed by transitive and intransitive verbs, respectively.

191
A base verb may end in a vowel or in a consonant. In the latter case, it is not uncommon for an echo vowel to occur after the word final coda. The quality of the echo vowel is typically the same as that of the nucleus of the syllable in question, except when the syllable nucleus is /a/: under these circumstances, the tendency is for the echo-vowel to surface as [i] provided it follows a flap; otherwise, no echo-vowel occurs (145). In any case, verb stems ending in a consonant do not undergo changes due to nonfinite status, except for the fact that the echo-vowel does not occur in the nonfinite form. Thus:

Verbs that do undergo alternations in their nonfinite forms may (a) have a consonant added in stem-final position; (b) have its syllables rearranged; or (c) undergo vowel or consonant alternations. It is possible for more than one of these patterns to apply at a time. In my database, intransitive verbs display these alternations relatively most frequently.
Suffixation is the most widespread of the three patterns. The consonant suffixes most commonly found are /ْ, n, r/, although /j, k/ also occur. Phonological motivations for the distribution of these variants are not obvious. The distribution appears to be lexically determined, instead. This pattern applies to transitive, intransitive, and to a very few descriptive stems.

Resyllabification involves deletion and applies mostly to intransitive verbs in the database. As illustrated in (147.a-b), the initial segment of the stem may be either replaced by a CV syllable or deleted. Words based on disyllabic stems lose the vowel of the penultimate syllable, and the result is a CVC.CV(C) pattern for the word (147.a). Monosyllabic stems simply lose the first segment of the base (147.c-d); word-final consonant insertion may apply and the result is a closed-syllable word (147.d). The nonfinite stem usually spans one foot consisting mostly of heavy syllables.

The last pattern of nonfinite verb stem formation consists of alternation in the vowel quality of the base. This pattern is perhaps the least productive of the three. In the examples below, there is a tendency for the nonfinite form to have a more centered or fronted vowel, but again, it appears that the resulting vowel is lexically determined.

4.2. Derivational categories Derivational categories may be expressed by affixes or clitics. Some of the most pervasive derivational categories in the database include detransitivization with the middle prefixes (section 3.1.2.4), causativization (section 3.2.2.7), verbalization and nominalization (section 3.1.1.4).

CHAPTER IV
SYNTAX
0. Introduction The structural and semantic properties of phrases and simple clauses, and the functional motivation behind possible construction options, constitute the subject of the present chapter. Section 1 introduces the relevant criteria for the establishment of constituency in Apinajé. Section 2 presents the morphosyntactic properties shared by the noun phrase, the postpositional phrase and the verb phrase, as well as those properties typical of each. Section 3 discusses the various clause types. Relevant clause-level grammatical distinctions, such as realis and irrealis mode, and the formal expression of speech-act distinctions, serve in part as the base for a structural subcategorization of simple clauses; for that reason, they are introduced first. Section 4 is a discussion of grammatical relations in terms of the morphological and syntactic properties that characterize such relations in Apinajé. Valency-changing operations, which affect not only the morphological composition of predicators but also the grammatical properties of the clause as a whole, are presented in section 5. Section 6 summarizes the findings imparted in this chapter and offers language-internal hypotheses about the historical development of some of the grammatical patterns observed.

197
1. Criteria for the establishment of constituency Phrasal and clausal constituency are detectable in Apinajé according to three types of criteria: prosodic, morphological, and distributional. By prosodic criteria I mean (a) the intonation contour that characterizes phrases and larger constituents as internally cohesive units, and (b) stress patterns characteristic of such combination of elements. Another phonological criterion that may help identify the boundaries of a constituent is the echo-vowel phenomenon, which is indicative of final boundary and must be followed by silence (sections II.4.5 and III.2.1). This criterion, although helpful, is not as specifically indicative of constituency, since it may delimit a word said at random, that is, one that is not necessarily in a constituency relation with some other element (a word uttered as a citation form, for instance).
The main morphological criterion to be considered is the use of relational prefixes (section III.4.1.2), which are precisely the overt grammatical marking of phrasal constituency in Jê (and other Macro-Jê) languages. Relational prefixes are common to noun, verb, and postpositional phrases, and indicate contiguity between the head of a phrase and its dependent. Such contiguity is one of the clues for the constituency relation between the elements, and a violation of this state of affairs has overt grammatical repercussions as well, such as the use of specific person prefixes for head marking (section 2.3). Even though the relational prefix strategy indicates the bond between twoword units, and thus would not seem as useful for larger units, it may reccur in sequences of more than two words thus indicating relevant constituency relations among the units that participate in the hierarchy (provided the elements involved are vowel-initial).

198
While relational prefixes are indicative of constituent internal cohesion, other morphological devices delimit the initial and final boundaries of certain types of (phrasal and clausal) constituents. These devices include (a) nonfiniteness suffixes, (b) ergative clitics, (c) nominalizers and (d) determiners, like the definite article ja. Most of these markers pertain to subordination, and the roles they perform in such contexts are discussed in chapter V. With respect to constituency, however, positional clitics (b-d) overtly set the boundaries for clausal constituents.
Distributional criteria include (a) the relative order of elements inside the constituent and (b) the distribution of the constituent in the sentence, along with (c) the distribution of overt indices of constituent internal cohesion and boundaries.
Prosodic, morphological and distributional criteria for the establishment of constituency are illustrated and discussed further in the following sections.
2. Phrase structure The different phrase types of Apinajé – verb, noun and postpositional – share at least two basic properties: they are head final and head marking (Nichols 1986). Relational prefixes and person prefixes attach to the phrase head, encoding contiguity and crossreference to the dependent element, respectively. The details specific to each phrase type are discussed next.

199
2.1. Noun phrase The expression of possession, noun modification, determination and quantification produce different effects in the structure of the noun phrase. Such differences are guided by the inherent morphosyntactic properties of the elements involved.

Genitive constructions. The structure of a genitive construction is determined by the subclass – alienable or inalienable – of the head noun (section III.3.1.1.1). Thus, a noun phrase headed by an inalienable noun is characterized structurally by juxtaposition (1.a-b) or, if person prefixes are involved, by prefixation on the head noun (1.c-d); in either case, a relational prefix occurs between a vowel-initial head and its dependent noun or person prefix.

(1) a. kuweْ=rϯ bird=DIM

j-ae RP-nest

b. boc bovine

j-ab᭣ RP-tail<long>

c. i-ْ-õkrϯ 1-RP-throat

d. a-j-abak 2-RP-ear

‘the bird’s nest’ ‘the cow’s tail ‘my throat’ ‘your ear’

On the other hand, when the head of a noun phrase is a member of the alienable class, the structure of the genitive construction involves the occurrence of a postpositional phrase headed by the genitive postposition õ, which requires the relational

200

prefix ْ- (2). The postpositional phrase encodes the genitive element and is dependent on the alienable noun that heads the higher structure; note that the alienable noun does not take any kind of prefix – relational or personal – despite the constituency relation it holds with the genitive postpositional phrase (2.c), as indicated by intonational, distributional and semantic factors.

(2) a. [i-ْ-õ] 1-RP-GEN

pi wood

b. [ifermer=ti

ْ-õ] kuw᭣

nurse<PORT>=AUG RP-GEN fire

c. [i-ْ-õ] 1-RP-GEN

apcet peba

‘my dry wood’ ‘the nurse’s lighter’ ‘my peba (armadillo, sp.)’

Besides the relational prefix strategy, phrase internal cohesion is indicated by the contiguity between the elements involved, which may not be interrupted by extraneous morphological material; the intonation pattern, with all elements encompassed under a single intonation contour; and phrasal stress, which falls on the last element of the phrase, that is, the head (3).

aБwђ request

201
Apinajé thus has both head marking and genitive marking noun phrases, with either option being determined by the morphosyntactic subcategory of the head noun. Both genitive constructions express possession.

Noun modification. Noun modification may be expressed by the juxtaposition of nouns, with the difference that no genitive marking needs to be involved. In (4), the phrases consist of all alienable nouns. The relative ordering of dependent and head elements is the opposite of the standard pattern in (4.b): the modifier follows the head noun. Examples such as this are exceptional; there are only two such cases in my database, both of which involve the word kupe ‘non-Indian’.1

(4) a. kupe foreign
b. kupe foreign

di woman
paْi Indian

‘foreign woman’ ‘Indian-like foreigner’

The function of noun modification may be performed by noun phrases involving inalienable nouns (5).

(5) apen

krђ

mangaba head

‘mangaba (latex plant, sp.) ball’

1 Another possibility is that there may have been some translation inadequacy for these two isolated cases.

202
Noun modification is also expressed by noun phrases consisting of a noun and a nonfinite verb form. In these cases, the nonfinite verb is the head of the noun phrase, which derives from a verbal predicate construction, whereas the other nominal involved serves as the modifier (6). That the nonfinite verb is part of a noun phrase is demonstrable by its distribution and its function in the clause: it is surrounded by a noun and the definite article ja, and it is an argument of the main predicator (6.b). Note that the relational prefix occurs, since the head of the noun phrase, ireْ, begins in a vowel; the pattern is comparable to that of the genitive construction introduced above.

Noun modification may also involve the presence of a descriptive verb in attributive function in the noun phrase, in a relative clause construction. In this case, the descriptive is the modifier element and follows the head noun (see details on relativization in section V.2). Notice one such complex noun phrase as the object of the instrumental postposition ѐ in (7.c).

Determiners. In phrases where the head noun co-occurs with a determiner, the head does not appear phrase finally, since determinants are positional clitics that necessarily follow the nominal element they refer to. Determiners include the definite articles ja ‘singular’ and je ‘collective’, and the indefinite article õ ‘some; a; one’ (8).2 Demonstrative pronouns also fall in this functional and distributional category, following the head noun (9).

‘some money’ ‘a deer’ ‘one peba (armadillo sp.)’
‘that water (river, creek)’ ‘this boy’

204
The indefinite marker õ may operate as a pronoun and thus head a noun phrase on its own. That is also true of the demonstratives and the singular definite article ja (10). The collective article je has not been noted in this function.

Plurality may be expressed with reduplication of the definite article, although the category of number is often expressed with quantifiers as well (11).

(11) me me

di jaja prirϯ jaja

‘the women’ ‘the kids’

2 The distinction between the indefinite determiner õ and the homonymous genitive postposition õ is noticeable, among other things, by the distribution of each: the determiner follows the head; the postposition is the head of a lower phrase but it precedes the head of the higher structure. 3 In this context, the indefinite article õ is pronounced as [õt]. It is not yet clear whether the reduced consonant at coda position is morphological material, the result of a phonological process, or merely a phonetic effect. Compared to that, there are instances in which the definite article ja in pronominal function is also pronounced as the more “extended” form [Ѯari]; under these circumstances, however, it usually has the more adverbial meaning ‘here’. Thus, the alternation in shape is justifiable as the result of a morphological process.

205
Quantifiers. The quantifiers wa ‘dual’ and me ‘plural’ are positional clitics too. Either one of them may co-occur with an overt head noun; unlike determiners, however, these clitics precede the head noun they modify (11-12).

(12) wa di me b᭣

‘(dual) women’ ‘(plural) men’

The dual and plural clitics are most frequently used with pronominal elements. Under these circumstances, their distribution will vary depending on whether the pronominal element is a prefix or a free pronoun. The quantifier clitics have the same distribution relative to person prefixes as they do with full nouns, that is, they precede them both (13). With free pronouns, the distribution of wa ‘dual’ and me ‘plural’ is the opposite: the clitics follow the pronoun (14).

206
It is important to note that, of quantifiers in general, only the plural and dual markers me and wa are positional clitics. Apart from these, other words that encode quantity in Apinajé are descriptive verbs, such as ѐБto ‘many’, or intransitive verbs, such as the numerals, and therefore do not pertain to the noun phrase.

Co-occurrence restrictions. Some determiners may co-occur within the same noun phrase. In my database, the only determiners that appear as such are the ones in (15) below, and only in the relative orders presented. The juxtaposition of determiners encodes specific semantic nuances in a more hierarchical than linear way, structurally. Here, determiners perform distinct functions within the same noun phrase, such that one member of the class heads the other. Consider the examples below, among them (6.b), repeated for convenience as (15.a).

207
In (15.a), the marker ja indicates definiteness and referentiality pertaining to the phrase ‘slice of meat/sliced meat’; the indefinite marker õ, in turn, encodes a (generic, non-specified) portion of that referent. Thus, the indefinite marker õ heads the definite noun phrase br᭣ ْireْ ja in a genitive construction, whereby it expresses the partitive category. The constituency relation is indicated here by the intonation pattern and the cohesive distribution of the elements with respect to one another and the verb.
The examples in (15.b-c) involve the definite marker ja and the distal demonstrative muj. Here, the definite article has a third person pronominal function and heads the phrase; and the distal demonstrative performs its regular function as a determiner of the head.
Morphosyntactically complex noun phrases. In the beginning of this section, I have pointed out that verbs may perform nominal functions within the noun phrase. The presence of verbal elements may result in higher complexity when we consider relative clauses. The structural properties of relativization involve basically the same mechanisms observed in the constructions introduced previously, but here further elements are involved as well. The syntactic and functional details about relativization and its impact on the organization of the sentence will be discussed further in chapter V. For now, I will concentrate on the structural makeup of such clauses in Apinajé, and how they fit in the noun phrase.

208
As a general rule in Apinajé, all kinds of subordination require that the relevant verb be in its nonfinite form (16). In nonfinite forms, it is the absolutive argument that is expressed; either with full noun occurring along with the verb (16.a-b) or with a person prefix attached to the verb (16.c).

If the subordinate verb is transitive, the ergative argument of the relative clause must be overtly marked as such (16.b-c). The ergative marker is a positional clitic and has the alternative forms tϯ and kѐt: the former is used with first and second person arguments, and takes person prefixes; kѐt refers to third person arguments, and takes no prefixes (see chapter VI for a diachronic hypothesis about the development of differences in the form of the ergative clitics).

209
The ergative marker indicates the initial boundary of the subordinate clause – and consequently, of the noun phrase. At the other end, the clausal boundary may coincide with the nonfinite verb form (16.a) or with a nominalizer clitic (16.b-c). However, as far as the noun phrase boundary is concerned, it is the definite article ja that usually seals it, in these circumstances (16.a-c).
Besides these overt boundary markers, these constituents may be identified also by their intonation contour and by their internal cohesion, or uninterruptability.
Noun phrase coordination. Three distinct strategies for noun phrase coordination have been noted in my database. The first involves the use of the conjunction ne; the next employs the associative morpheme me in conjunction with the dual marker wa; and the last strategy involves the expression (ne) kac᭣w, which translates approximately as ‘in addition to; along with’. The conjunction ne is also used for clausal coordination, in which context it performs the more specialized function of ‘same subject’ marker (see further details in section 4).
The examples in (17) illustrate the use of ne. The coordinate noun phrases are the arguments of the transitive verbs ѐbu ‘see’ and gõ ‘give’, and the intransitive te ‘go’. In (17.a), only the conjunction is used, whereas the dual marker co-occurs with it in (17.bc). In the latter examples, we notice two tokens of the realis marker na – once

210
introducing the coordinate noun phrases, and the second time introducing the clause as such. Here, the dual marker wa refers back to the noun phrase referents, which are somewhat emphasized in this type of construction.

Factors that may be of relevance for the double occurrence of the realis marker in this context are (a) that the arguments expressed by the coordinate noun phrases are A/S, and (b) that they are not encoded by pronouns. Were these arguments to be expressed as pronouns, the pattern for syntactically encoded emphasis on them would be the double occurrence of the pronoun itself; and had they been O arguments, the dual clitic could have been dispensed with, as in (17.a).
As pointed out earlier, the number clitics wa and mϯ generally precede the noun phrase they modify, follow the pronoun they modify, and precede the verb whose bound prefix they modify. In these conjunction examples, the first impulse might be to assume that they modify the preceding noun phrase, which would be structurally odd. However,

211
this is not the case: the realis clitic na marks the right boundary of the conjoined S/A noun phrase in (17.b-c), leaving wa to serve as a resumptive pronoun.
When a conjoined noun phrase is in O function, the resumptive pronoun slot is not available. In this case, wa can occur only as a modifier of the third person form of the verb (18.a), in which case the O noun phrase is not within the verb phrase, but stands as a preverbal adjunct. The attempt to force an analysis with wa as a post-NP modifier fails, as seen in (18.b): wa cannot be interpreted as the dual marker when it comes between the conjoined noun phrase and a transitive verb bearing a relational prefix (indicating contiguity with its O argument). Here, wa can only be interpreted as the homophonous noun ‘tooth’, and the conjoined noun phrase must be its possessor.

The same observations regarding the use of the realis and the dual markers are valid for the examples involving the expression (ne) kac᭣w, which has the same distribution in the noun phrase as the plain conjunction ne in the examples above. Notice that, here too, the dual marker may be dispensed with, when the coordinates constitute the O argument of the verb (19.d). The morpheme kac᭣w can also function as an inchoative marker in a different type of construction (section V.4).

The examples in (20) illustrate the use of the associative marker me, which follows the same general pattern noted above. One interesting fact about this morpheme is that it serves as the basis for the numeral ametkrut ‘two’. The use of ame as a numeral results in different distribution from its use as the associative (20.c). It appears as a common modifier of the coordinates, thus closing the higher noun phrase, which is again not contiguous to its predicator.

Notice that (20.a) is a counterexample to the analysis proposed here, that the coordination of S/A noun phrases must be mediated by the realis marker. The examples in (21), on the other hand, not only confirm the analysis, they also show that, without the realis marker, the clause is grammatically unacceptable, a fact that reinforces the idea that coordinate noun phrases in Apinajé are somewhat emphasized because of the very syntactic construction in which they appear. In face of the evidence, however, it appears that the analysis will have to be reajusted to include the possibility that position and movement intransitives may, in fact, allow for the lack of the realis marker. Further research will be necessary to clarify this point.

The strategies for noun phrase coordination presented in (17-21) all indicate that the referents performed actions, underwent changes-of-state or participated in events together, as a party. Another coordination strategy, one that employs the noun acwҶj

214
‘likewise’, indicates that the referents of each noun phrase performed the same actions, participated in the same events or underwent the same states, but they did so independently from one another. Further details about this construction are in section 2.3.

2.2. Postpositional phrase The structure of postpositional phrases is quite consistent regardless of the morphosyntactic properties of the noun phrases involved. Vowel-initial postpositions require relational prefixes, as usual. Objects of postpositions may be simplex noun phrases, coordinated noun phrases and nonfinite clauses (22-24).

Complex noun phrases, namely, those including relative clauses, may have postpositions but are not directly headed by the postposition; in these cases, a person

215
prefix or third person form of the postposition takes on the role of resumptive pro-form, instead (25).

Determiners. Of the determiners found in noun phrases, only demonstrative pronouns may replace the noun phrase headed by a postposition. Otherwise, in the absence of a full noun phrase, it is a person prefix or the reflexive or reciprocal clitics that attach to the postposition, serving as cross-reference markers (26).

Quantifiers. The plural and dual clitics may each co-occur with a postposition that is inflected for person. In this case, the quantifier clitic is actually modifying the (referent of the) person prefix attached to the postposition, and occurs preposed to it. Most postpositions take a zero prefix for third person; others have irregular third person forms (see diachronic hypothesis in section III.3.1.3). In these cases, the quantifier occurs preposed to the postposition itself (27).

Clausal objects. A few select postpositions may perform a more grammatical function when taking a clause as their objects. One such example is the dative postposition mђ, which may encode notions of future or purpose action as illustrated in (28).

Postpositional phrase coordination. The coordination of postpositional phrases seems more restricted in possibilities than plain noun phrase coordination. The conjunction used is the associative marker me. The examples in (29) show structural distinctions that have to do with whether one of the coordinates is a speech-act participant. If so, it will be expressed as a person prefix on the postposition, which results in non-contiguity between the (notional) coordinates, since the two nominal elements are separated by the

217
associative and the dual marker (29.a). That is not exactly what could be called coordination, though the combination of dual marker and first person prefix encodes first person exclusive, and the other participant is clearly indicated by the associative marker me. In (29.b), on the other hand, the two third person objects are expressed by overt noun phrases linked by the associative marker.

The unacceptable examples in (30) show that the presence of the dual marker wa is necessary, and that it mediates the relation between the coordinate noun phrases and the postposition that heads the higher phrase. In other words, there is no coordination of postpositional phrases as such; instead, there is either noun phrase or clause coordination (31).

2.3. Verb phrase Verbs phrases in Apinajé follow an absolutive pattern with regard to which argument cooccurs with the verb inside the phrase. That is predictable according to the morphosyntactic class of the predicator that heads the phrase – either (di)transitive or descriptive (32-34). Verb phrases headed by intransitive verbs do not include any type of noun phrase, in main clauses. In dependent clauses, they follow the same pattern as descriptives, that is, they have their S argument overtly expressed in the verb phrase (34).

Verb arguments may be expressed by full noun phrases within the verb phrase or by person prefixes; either way, vowel-initial predicators must take relational prefixes. Relational prefixes, as already mentioned, indicate distributional contiguity and syntactic constituency between the elements of the phrase. When such contiguity is breached, the relevant argument is understood as being under focus, as it occurs elsewhere in the clause. In the case of transitive, monosyllabic predicators, an argument under focus is replaced in the verb phrase by the third person accusative prefix ku-, which serves as a resumptive pronoun (35-36).

The other possibility is that the relevant noun phrase argument may occur elsewhere in the discourse, in which case the accusative prefix serves as an anaphoric pronoun. Note also that the zero third person prefix occurs, when distributional restrictions prevent the occurrence of ku-.

Verb phrase/clause coordination. Verb phrase coordination basically coincides with

clausal coordination. The strategies employed include the conjunctions ne and ْum,

which have the additional function of a switch reference system; or simply the juxtaposition of phrases. The distribution of these markers is also ruled by the contrast between speech-act and third person participants.

Ne indicates same subject (see discussion of grammatical relations in section 4)

and is used regardless of person distinctions (38.a-b). When there is switch in reference such that both referents are third person participants, the conjunction ْum is employed

(38.c). When there is switch of reference to a speech-act participant, however, there is

juxtaposition of clauses such that the second referent is introduced by a free pronoun

(38.d).

The noun acwђj ‘likewise’ is, structurally speaking, the head of a noun phrase, possessed by ic-kra in the examples below. Acwђj behaves morphosyntactically as an inalienable noun. It takes person prefixes and may be followed by determiners such as the definite marker ja. In other words, not only does it belong in the noun phrase, it heads it (38). The adverbial mђneْ ‘also’, on the other hand, is a sentence-level operator with rather flexible distribution in the clause, as will be seen later on.
Thus, the strategies presented in (39-40) are not exactly instances of noun phrase, but clausal coordination. Further details on this subject are in section (4).

3. Clause structure In what follows, the various types of main clause structure are introduced. It will be seen that some of the variation found in verbal clauses is due to the major distinction between the realis and irrealis mode, as well as to speech-act distinctions, especially the contrast between affirmative and negative sentences. Other differences in the structure of verbal clauses are due to the morphosyntactic nature of the predicators involved, namely, those that entail the standard pattern of argument marking already introduced (sections III.3.2.1. and III.4.1.1), as against those predicators that involve non-canonical patterns of argument marking.

224
3.1. Mode distinctions The realis and irrealis encompass all clause structure types in Apinajé. That is, clauses are either realis or irrealis, structurally. From a semantic and functional perspective, the realis mode includes past, present, habitual – negative, positive or interrogative – propositions. The irrealis mode comprises future, hypothetical, counterfactual, conditional, intentive – negative, positive, interrogative and some imperative – propositions. Speech act distinctions therefore do not interfere with mode distinctions, for the most part (except for one type of imperative, as will be seen below).
The realis mode is encoded by the positional clitic na. As a general rule, this marker indicates the clause initial boundary and is typically followed by a free pronoun, which encodes the nominative argument of the clause. Tense-aspect distinctions are expressed elsewhere in the clause, often by clitic sequences postposed to the nominative pronoun, or by clause final clitics, subordinators, or serial constructions (41).

The irrealis mode is encoded by the positional clitic kѐt. This clitic also indicates clause initial boundary and is obviously in complementary distribution with na (42).

b. kѐt ja wa prek ne wa bϯc ne. IRLS 3.IRLS DU tall CNJ DU pretty FCT ‘They will both grow up and be beautiful.’

The form of independent pronouns, which encode the nominative argument of the clause, is different in irrealis and realis clauses; except for this detail, other aspects of the clause are the same in either clause type.
Beyond this basic observation, it is also noticeable that kѐt has a more restricted distribution than na. The latter may occur in positions other than clause initially; in such circumstances, it is often syntactically associated to noun phrases, indicating either (a) that such noun phrases are in focus position – a function common also to the irrealis marker (43); or (b) stating the status of the noun phrase as the predicator (under focus) of the clause, as illustrated by an example of noun phrase coordination, repeated below as (44).

3.2. Speech-act distinctions The declarative, interrogative and imperative speech-acts correspond to morphological and structural distinctions in Apinajé. Declarative clauses have the structural properties of the types just introduced.
Polarity questions may be expressed with exactly the same kind of structure as simple declarative clauses, but with a distinct intonation pattern; or the question may be introduced by the positional clitic cђ (alternative form co, depending on the speaker), which co-occurs with the mode markers, but at absolute clause-initial position (45.a-b). Information questions are naturally introduced by interrogative pronouns, also at clause initial position (45.c-d).

227
d. ْ᭣ na wϯ õcwa? which RLS HRS sleepy ‘Which one is sleepy?’
There are two strategies for the expression of imperative constructions. One of them is the use of an irrealis clause whose nominative participant is the addressee of the command (46.a). This strategy is employed when the speaker is making a request or giving advice to the addressee. The other strategy is used in more direct commands, and that is reflected in the structure of the imperative construction (Haiman 1985; Givón 2001: 34-35). Here, no mode marker is employed. The proposition is expressed, instead, by the bare or inflected form of the verb, depending on its morphosyntactic class. This is the only construction type in which a transitive verb may display a nominative pattern of inflection (i.e., it takes the second person prefix, as one might expect of an imperative context (46.b)).

228
3.3. Verbal clauses Verbal clauses have a structure distinct from nominal ones, not only because they – obviously – are centered around verbal predicators, but especially because they involve an interesting combination of alignment patterns (cf. section 4).
In the present discussion, I will be employing the notation A, S, and O, proposed in Dixon (1979, 1994) and later expanded to include E, in Aikhenvald, Dixon and Onishi’s (2001) framework. The characterization proposed by Dixon for these symbols, as representing universal syntactic-semantic primitives, has been critiqued by other linguists. Some of the problems that have been pointed out include (a) inadequacies in the semantic characterization of these primitives; (b) the fact that their definition is based on a mixture of semantic and grammatical properties; and (c) that certain languages do not seem to follow these kinds of patterning, and therefore such primitives should not be regarded as universal (Mithun and Chafe 1999; Comrie 1978; 1989). Nonetheless, these symbols are amply used in the literature as a means to refer to core arguments of transitive and intransitive verbs.
Keeping in mind the problems raised in the literature regarding the theoretical implications carried by these symbols, in the present discussion I will use them more as useful mnemonic devices than as strict theoretical constructs. On the other hand, I will follow the typology proposed in Aikhenvald, Dixon and Onishi (2001) when laying out patterns of participant marking noted in Apinajé. Once these patterns have been laid out, I will propose a set of language internal criteria for identifying what relevant grammatical relations there are in Apinajé (section 4; cf. Dryer 1997).

229
3.3.1. Canonical predicates The major morphosyntactic classes of verbs, as seen in section III.3.1.2.1, are those that comprise (di)transitive verbs, intransitive verbs, and descriptive verbs. It should be noted from the start that, for each verb class, specific participants are understood as core arguments (A, S, O, E) because they are necessarily required by the verb. However, the core argument status of some of these participants may or may not be supported by a robust set of grammatical criteria in Apinajé, as will be seen in section 4.
Transitive and descriptive verbs are inflected for person according to an absolutive pattern. In the former class, person prefixes are pronominal, that is, they stand for the O argument itself; this is what is referred to here as “cross-referencing”. In the latter class, person prefixes agree with independent pronouns in the indexation of the sole argument of the verb, i.e. S.
Intransitive verbs do not take person inflection in simple clauses, and thus form a split intransitivity pattern along with descriptives, as both types are monovalent. The split between descriptives and intransitives corresponds in large part to the semantic distinction between states as against events and activities, but it is not guided by it. The sub-categorization is basically of a morphosyntactic nature (for a detailed discussion about descriptive verbs see Oliveira 2003).
Contrasting to bound person inflection, the use of independent pronouns follows a nominative pattern. Indeed, nominative free pronouns are nearly obligatory in any simple

230
clause. Pronouns express the pertinent (S/A) arguments of all intransitive, descriptive and transitive verbs.

(47) a. na ka prϯ tϯ mϯ

FCT

‘You’re sweating’

c.na ka ic-kake

RLS 2

1-scratch

‘You’ve scratched me.’

Thus, the structure of simple clauses in Apinajé betrays a combination of split intransitivity and nominative alignment patterns – all this relative to agreement and crossreferencing, however. It is only in the context of subordination that ergativity is overtly expressed by case markers (see chapter V). These patterns comprise the canonical marking of arguments in Apinajé verbal clauses.

3.3.2. Noncanonical predicates The typology of argument marking proposed in Onishi (2001) departs from the assumption that all languages include transitive and intransitive clauses, and that the core arguments of these clauses – A, S, O – will be expressed according to certain canonical patterns noticeable in that given language. Additionally, languages will also display a set of predicators that include what he terms “extensions to the core”, which he indicates

231
with the symbol E (which stands for “extended argument”, following Dixon 1994). The “core” plus “extensions” result in four clause types, displayed schematically below (from Onishi 2001: 2), in which core arguments may be marked in the most diverse ways, crosslinguistically.

(48)

Plain transitive

A

O

Extended transitive (ditransitive) A

O

E (or O)

Plain intransitive

S

Extended intransitive

S

E

The schematic representation in (48) defines possible clauses types according to the types of arguments that are obligatorily required in each. Thus, a plain transitive clause must include A and O; a ditransitive clause must include A, O and a third argument, which may be expressed morphosyntactically as an indirect object E or as a secondary object O; a plain intransitive has its single argument S; and an extended intransitive has two obligatory arguments: S plus another, E, which is typically expressed with oblique markers. Extended arguments differ from oblique participants or adjuncts in that they are obligatorily required by the verb.
The fact that some of these core arguments will be marked with adpositions or case-marking certainly makes it hard to decide whether the participant in question is in fact a core argument of the verb. Thus, as Onishi wisely points out, “both morphological and syntactic criteria [are necessary] to determine which arguments should be regarded as A, S, O and E” (p.2).

232
The noncanonical marking of core arguments is understood here, with Onishi (2001), as those patterns that deviate from the standard patterns of argument marking used in a given language. In the case of Apinajé, the canonical pattern is the use of free pronouns to indicate SA/SO/A (nominative pattern), and bound person markers to indicate SO/O (absolutive pattern). Noncanonical marking in Apinajé then involves the use of various postpositions for the expression of what appear to be core arguments, that is, participants that are obligatorily required by verbs.
In the remainder of this section, I will tentatively depart from the assumption that the patterns of Apinajé laid out here involve the noncanonical marking of core arguments; at this point, this assumption is based simply on (a) the frequency and consistency with which certain postpositions come associated with certain verbs; and (b) the fact that these combinations sometimes result in significantly distinct meanings from those of the base verbs, as if in a derivational relation. Supporting grammatical evidence is presented in section 4.
Noncanonical marking in Apinajé is noticeable with verbs of cognition, emotion, utterance, and sensation, among others. The patterns observed with these verbs all depart from the basic canonical patterns of argument marking and involve many sorts of postpositions – from locative, to dative, to instrumental to ergative. The semantic subcategorization of such predicators corresponds somewhat to the kinds of postpositions used, but not necessarily so.

233
Notionally monovalent non-canonical predicators. Most (notional) monovalent noncanonical predicators (and I say “predicators,” rather than “verbs,” because some of these are based on nouns4) have their sole participant marked with the dative postposition, although there is one verb, amْi kati ‘have fun; enjoy oneself’, which calls for the reflexive pronoun. Verbs belonging in this class encode sensations and emotions (49-50).

4 That the elements involved are nouns, and not simply the result of conversion of nouns into verbs, can be seen from morphological differences between the members of a pair, for instance, as in akr᭣ ‘be cold’ as compared to kr᭣ ‘cold (?)’; another example is t-ђ go [RP-LOC water] ‘sweat’, as against ђ ‘LOC’ and go ‘water’.

At a closer look, one could hypothesize that the predicator in these cases may be taking a zero third person marker, in which case the predicator could not be adequately descibed as monovalent. The difficulty with confirming this hypothesis is that, in some cases, a regular verb adopts an alternative form which is specific to this kind of predication. Take the example of mђ kr᭣ ‘feel cold’: elsewhere, the form of the predicator is akr᭣ ‘be.cold’, which may take person inflection, thus also employing the relational prefix j-. In the case of a zero third person form, the relational prefix would not occur; but the formative a- would not be lost either. Therefore, the best criteria for deciding whether these are mono- or bivalent predicators, and even whether the participants marked with postpositions are or are not core arguments, must come from syntax. For the time being, I will simply lay out the morphological patterns involved, and will postpone a discussion of the syntactic evidence until section 4.

235

Bivalent non-canonical predicators. Bivalent non-canonical predicators come in a variety of patterns. The primary difference between the patterns is whether A or O is noncanonically marked, and secondarily whether we should think of some of these as extended intransitives rather than noncanonical transitives. We begin with two clear cases of noncanonical A: some verbs require that the A be marked as a dative, others that it be marked as ergative.
The verbs that require a dative A include verbs of liking, disliking, refusal, fear, and desire. The latter three occur as complement-taking verbs as well, as may be seen in the examples. The clause begins with the nominative pronoun in first or second position, followed a bit later by a coreferential dative-marked A argument; the O follows the canonical pattern, either occurring as a noun phrase immediately adjacent to the verb, or indicated morphologically with bound pronouns ((51-52); O-NP’s are within brackets).

The ergative A pattern is found with three transitive verbs, which exceptionally occur in their nonfinite forms in main clauses (53). The A occurs once only, marked as ergative, and the O takes the canonical expression of the accusative argument (54). Predicators from this morphosyntactic class have cognition semantics, but the A argument is not a passive experiencer: there is often some deliberate involvement of the participant in the cognitive experience. The ergative marking on A then seems to encode this semantic nuance.

The motivation for these verbs to occur in their nonfinite forms is not clear yet; further data and analysis are still needed for a better understanding of the occurrence of nonfinite forms in what otherwise appear to be simple clauses (cf. section V.4).
The next set of patterns could be analyzed in two different ways: either they present a noncanonical O or they present formally intransitive predicates with an obligatory oblique argument (E) instead of an O. In favor of the former analysis is the obligatory nature of the second argument. In favor of the latter analysis is the fact that the putative A for some verbs follows the standard A/SA pattern (unmarked, clause-initial); but for other verbs, it follows the pattern for subjects of descriptives (clause-initial nominative pronoun, SO verbal prefix).
The verbs shown in (55) are based on intransitive stems, which take no person marking. Thus, both arguments of the predication must be marked outside the verb stem. For this set in particular, the A/SA argument is indicated with the nominative free pronoun,

238
and the O argument is marked with either the dative, instrumental, locative or inessive postpositions. These are mostly utterance verbs, in addition to one emotion verb.

The verb kamђ krak ‘shoot [at]’ is, in reality, a trivalent verb whose O argument, kuce ‘gun’, is often omitted; for that reason, the observable pattern for this verb resembles one of the noncanonical patterns – in fact, it may eventually become solidified in that way. Typically, with this verb the focus is on the target of the shooting, i.e. E: the fact that there was a weapon used is assumed, and thus left unsaid. The status of the weapon as the O argument of the verb is demonstrated in the examples below: in (57.a-b) the target is marked with the inessive postposition; in (57.c), it is marked directly on the verb.

The other pattern is illustrated in (58). The A/SO argument is marked by the nominative pronoun plus the SO prefix on the verb, while the O/E argument is marked with the dative postposition. This set includes verbs of utterance, deception and refusal. It also

240

includes the verbs for ‘find’, which are actually metaphorical extensions of a pair of movement-verb constructions in which the literal endpoint of the trajectory is the metaphorical O argument of the verbal expression.

3.4. Clauses with nominal predicates Clauses with nominal predicates involve either juxtaposition or copula constructions. The functional domain encoded by each construction type overlaps somewhat, such that proper inclusion (cf. Payne 1997) and equative predicates may be expressed by both types, whereas possessive predicates are expressed only by juxtaposition.
Juxtaposition constructions. A juxtaposition construction is one that does not include any type of verbal element, but rather consists of a noun phrase in predicate position plus its subject. Proper inclusion, equative, and possessive predicates are expressed by the same construction overall, although it will differ in a few structural details depending on the function of the nominal predication at hand. In what follows, I will address these differences, comparing the structure of each subtype of juxtaposition construction with that of descriptive predicates and verbal clauses.

3.4.1. Proper inclusion predicates Functionally, proper inclusion predicates indicate the membership of a given entity into a general class, as in “I am a teacher.” In Apinajé, a juxtaposition construction expressing

243
this kind of predication does not require the presence of a free pronoun for the expression of the subject. Here, the person prefix attached to the predicate noun is what indicates the subject, regardless of whether a pronoun also occurs. Should a pronoun be included in the clause, it would appear preceding the modality marker and agreeing with the prefix, as illustrated in the elicited examples presented below.

2

RLS

‘You’re a man.’

a-b᭣ 2-man

c. ja na Ø-wapѐ DEM RLS 3-knife ‘This is a knife.’

This construction type then differs structurally from verbal clauses and descriptive predicates because of the potential absence of the independent pronoun, and the reversed relative order of the mood marker and the pronoun when one occurs at all. In addition, it is specifically distinct from descriptive predicate constructions in that, even though pronominal prefixes refer to the subject in both, in the nominal predicate construction the prefix structurally encodes the subject, rather just than agreeing with it.

3.4.2. Equative predicates

244
Equative predicates functionally express a one-to-one identity relation between two specific, referential entities, as in “I am Sam” or “I am your sister.” A structural difference between the juxtaposition construction employed here and the one expressing proper inclusion is that here a personal prefix on the predicate noun indicates the possessor, and not the subject. The subject is encoded rather by a free pronoun, although its order relative to the mood marker remains reversed as compared to verbal clauses: the pronoun occurs clause-initially, and not in second position.

1

RLS 2-wife

‘I’m your wife.’

b. ka na iْ-bjeْ 2 RLS 1-husband ‘You’re my husband.’

Equative predicates by juxtaposition differ structurally from descriptive and verbal clauses primarily with respect to the relative order of the mood marker and the pronoun, and, specifically with respect to descriptives, because the prefix on the predicator is not coreferential with the subject of the clause.

3.4.3. Possessive predicates Possessive predicates (e.g. “I have a sister”) expressed by juxtaposition in Apinajé share some structural details with equative predicates, namely, the free pronoun must precede

245
the modality marker, but here it must be coreferential with the prefix on the predicate; these morphemes refer collectively to the possessor (66.a). If the coreferentiality condition is not met, then the construction will functionally constitute an equative nominal predicate (66.b).

1

RLS 1-knife

‘I have a knife.’

b. ja na ic-wapѐ DEM RLS 1-knife ‘That is my knife.’

It is evident that the construction in (66.a) is structurally identical to that expressing proper inclusion predicates introduced above (cf. (64)). Nonetheless, the interpretation here is one of possession because the nominal predicate has an inanimate, non-human referent. When asked whether one could get a proper inclusion interpretation out of example (66.a), as in “I am a knife,” consultants rejected the possibility and offered copula constructions, instead (67).

b. [pa na] ic-pe kuce 1 RLS 1-COP rifle ‘I am a rifle.’

246
Copula constructions. In the copula construction, subject marking is expressed by a person prefix attached to the copula pe, such that free pronouns are optional (67-68). This construction may express equative predication (68.a) as well as proper inclusion (68.b-c).

b. pa na ic-pe kupe 1 RLS 1-COP foreigner ‘I’m a foreigner.’
c. pa na ic-pe wajga 1 RLS 1-COP shaman ‘I’m a shaman.’

Noun phrases that occupy predicate position in copula constructions can be proper

nouns (68.a), alienable (68.b-c), or inalienable nouns (69). Prefixes attached to an

inalienable noun in predicate position refer to a possessor, which is non-coreferential

with the subject of the clause; compare (69.a-c) with (69.d).

In the case of coreferentiality between the subject and the possessor, as in a hypothetical example such as “I’m my own boss,” the possessor would probably be expressed by the reflexive marker amْi. In verbal clauses, at least, this morpheme is obligatorily present under such coreferentiality conditions (70).

3.5. Locative predicates Locative predicates follow the same pattern as verbal clauses, since they involve position verbs, which are typically intransitive. Thus, this clause type includes the mood marker, the subject nominal, the locative adverbial and a position verb, such as ca ‘stand’, ْ᭣ ‘sit’, or other, depending on the number of the absolutive argument (section III.3.1.2.3.)

248

3.6. Existential predicates Existential predicates are structurally similar to locative predicates, except that in these constructions the verb is dispensed with. The necessary elements are simply the location and the referent located, which typically comes accompanied by a quantifier or the existential negative amrakati in the predication.

CNJ DEM RLS farinha

raw=dry=DIM plenty

‘Around here there is a lot of farinha de puba and farinha seca.’

3.7. Negation Negation is another dimension whereby clauses can be subcategorized into structural types. Negation applies differently depending on the type of predicate being negated. Nominal predicates are negated with the clause-final clitic ket, verbal predicates with the clitic sequence ket=ne, whereas existential predicates can be negated either with ket or

249
the negative existential pronoun amrakati; apparently, some negated locative predicates (section 3.5) may function as negative existentials as well, except that these predicates are characterized by the use of positional verbs in predicate position which are, therefore, negated with ket=ne.
On the other hand, for any of these clause types, the expression of negation is not affected by the mode (realis or irrealis) or speech-act (declarative, interrogative, imperative) distinction of the clause.
The negation of juxtaposition nominal predicates, expressed by the simplex negative ket, is illustrated in (73). (There are no examples of negated copular predicates available in the database.) The examples (73.c-d) demonstrate that the complex negative marker is not preferred in this syntactic context.

The negation of descriptive verb predicates, illustrated in (80), presents some variation as to which form of the negative should be used. Most consultants tended to employ ket=ne for negation of descriptive predicates. However, at least one consultant showed preference for the use of the simplex negative morpheme ket in these contexts. As seen in the examples, the predicate of the clause type in (80.a) is unambiguously verbal; whereas in (80.b, c) the existential semantics of the constructions (ambiguous, in example (b)) might justify the preference for ket, since existential predicates categorize morphosyntactically with nominal predicates in Apinajé (section IV.3.5), and nominal predicates are negated with ket.

Whether the variation alluded to is a reflection of dialectal differences remains to be investigated in future research.
Finally, the adverbial notion of a temporal negative, ‘never’, involves the cooccurrence of the generic negative marker ket with what could be analyzed as a temporal component, a, glossed here as ‘ever’. Together, a...ket form what could be described structurally as a “circumclitic”. The temporal marker precedes the element under the scope of negation, and the negative marker ket follows it, occupying the constituent final position, as expected.

4. Grammatical relations Keenan (1976) proposes a set of criteria, which may apply to different languages to a greater or lesser extent, for a definition of Subject as a universal category. The idea of grammatical relations as a universal category has been questioned by Dryer (1997), who

254
points out that, while a set of criteria may be helpful to establish what similarities there
are amongst languages, these similarities do not explain why languages are the way they
are. Any similarities are, he claims, the reflexes of functional and cognitive processes
which themselves may be universal. Thus, it is not grammatical relations as such that are
universal. Each language displays its own relevant grammatical relations, which may or
may not coincide with the notions of “Subject” and “Object” as found in other languages.
In the analysis of Apinajé, I share Matthew Dryer’s view that the grammatical
relations of a language are specific to that language and may be defined according to
language internal criteria. In section 3.3 I have pointed out how distinct systems of
alignment interact in Apinajé. Thus, coding patterns and control properties relevant for
the establishment of grammatical relations in Apinajé include:
(82) Relevant criteria for the establishment of grammatical relations in Apinajé
(a) word order (b) person prefixes (c) independent pronouns (d) person inflection in imperative clauses (e) the use of reflexives (f) the occurrence of the realis marker in noun phrase coordination (g) switch-reference strategies (h) valency-changing operations (i) ergative marking in subordinate clauses (j) equi-deletion in complementation (k) coreferential deletion in coordination
The SOV word order (criterion (a)) is fairly rigid in Apinajé and serves as a useful
criterion of the identification of A and O. The use of person prefixes (b) reveals a split-

255
intransitive system in simple main clauses, and an absolutive pattern in nonfinite clauses. To go along with the absolutive pattern, criterion (i) reveals an ergative case-marking system that is conditioned by subordination environments. All other criteria (c-h; j-k) betray a nominative pattern and provide strong support for the grammatical relation Subject in Apinajé.
On the other hand, Direct Object is a less robust grammatical relation in the language. The O argument forms a tight constituent with the following verb, and if the O does not occur as a free form, then a personal prefix on the verb must index the person of O. In addition to this morphosyntactic pattern, the accusative prefix set contains a unique form, the prefix ku-, which is the one criterion that unquestionably identifies the Direct Object. Note that these criteria only identify the canonical O as Direct Object, leaving no syntactic or morphological evidence for the combination of the canonical O category with the many proposed noncanonical O arguments: these latter bear case-markers, cannot be indexed on the verb, and show no evidence of constituency with the V. As such, we push them to the next category, that of Indirect Object.
If Direct Object in Apinajé is not particularly robust, the evidence in favor of the grammatical relation Indirect Object is limited to a single criterion: obligatoriness. In the traditional ditransitive predicates, the third argument bears the dative case-marking, and in the various noncanonical verb types seen in section 3.3.2, the second argument bears one of four different case-markers, lexically determined by the verb. Thus, the category of Indirect Object could be defined as those obligatory arguments that otherwise have no morphological or syntactic patterns to unite them.

256
The criteria listed above for subjects are further discussed and illustrated in the next sections.

4.1. Person marking First, examples (83-84) illustrate the use of person prefixes. In finite verb forms O and some S are morphologically marked in the verbal stem (83). In nonfinite verb forms, all S and O participants are marked by prefixes (84).

257

c. ђm ic-c-ђm a-c-ђm

‘stand.NF’ ‘I stand.NF’ ‘you stand.NF’

The use of independent pronouns, which express the S and A arguments of verbs,

as well as the use of word order for the identification of A and O, are illustrated in section

3.3.

4.2. Imperatives In imperative clauses, bound person inflection also displays a nominative pattern, in what seems to be a unique occurrence of this pattern for person marking in Apinajé (85-87). In (85.a), the O argument of the verb is overtly expressed, forming a phrase with it. In (85.b), the O argument is not overtly mentioned, in which case, the verb inflects for A. This occurrence forms a nominative pattern with the person agreement marking of the descriptive predicates; combine (85.b) and (86.a-b), which contrast with the intransitive predicate in (87).

b. ْ᭣ sit ‘Have a seat!’

4.3. Reflexivization Reflexivization is controlled by the nominative argument of the clause (section III.3.2.2.6). Likewise, the occurrence of the realis marker in noun phrase coordination is required if the conjoined noun phrases refer to the S or (at least the) A argument of the clausal predicate, cf. (21), repeated here as (88).

4.4. Noun phrase coordination and the realis marker The double occurrence of the realis marker na in the context of noun phrase coordination is required when the conjoined noun phrases refer to S/A of the clause in which they occur.

4.5. Switch reference The switch reference system of Apinajé also operates according to a nominative pattern. The conjunctions ne and ْum serve as indices of same- and different-subjects, respectively, as illustrated in (38), repeated below as (90).

4.6. Valency-changing operations Other syntactic processes relevant to grammatical relations patterns are the valencychanging operations found in the language, namely, detransitivization and causativization. These are discussed next.

4.6.1. Detransitivization The middle prefixes occur as formatives in certain verbs. However, they are also productive in the derivation of intransitive verbs from transitives bases. The examples below are illustrative.
(91) a. kѐt paj amْi mђ mebѐj j-apro IRLS 1.IRLS RFLX DAT things RP-buy ‘I’ll buy something for myself.’

261
b.kѐt paj amْi mђ awjapro. IRLS 1.IRLS RFLX DAT go.shopping ‘I’ll do my shopping (for myself).’
Verbs derived with middle prefixes follow the intransitive morphosyntactic pattern, that is, are not inflected for person in simple main clauses but take a person prefix for S when in its nonfinite form.
4.6.2. Causativization The two main strategies for the expression of causativization in Apinajé are a periphrastic construction and a morphological construction, both involving the morpheme ѐ, translatable in both cases as ‘do’ – synchronically and diachronically, respectively.
Periphrastic causative. The periphrastic causative construction encodes indirect causation; in this context the construction ѐ ane expresses the cause, and a subsequent clause encodes the result. Unlike languages like English where the causative predicator takes an embeded complement clause, in the periphrastic causative construction of Apinajé, the clause encoding the resulting situation is not structurally an embedded complement, but rather a different-subject clause in a paratactic relation with the clause that expresses the causation ((92) see chapter V for other complex constructions).

‘You caused me to hit the dog’ (Lit.: “You did me thus, I hit the dog”) [i.e. I was

of hitting you].

1-dotted pretty

‘Why, then make me dotted just like her!’ (Lit.: “Do me thus as the others, I will

get nicely dotted.”) [i.e. burn me with hot stones].

In the constructions above, the two clauses are tightly bound into a single sentence: (i) a single modality morpheme occurs at the beginning of the utterance; (ii) no morphemes intervene between the two clauses involved (note that ѐ ane ‘do thus’ constitutes a single predicate); and (iii) the intonation pattern treats the two as a single unit. (The absence of a modality marker in (92.c) is due to the imperative speech act.) In addition, in the case of the periphrastic causatives in (92) the two clauses are linked by the fact that they share an argument: the object of ѐ ane ‘do thus’ is coreferential with the causee, which is expressed by the independent pronoun placed at the beginning of the result clause. Now consider the example in (93).

(93) na rѐp ri ic-t-ѐ ane ne pa amْi pe i-ْ-õ gwra kago kapi
RLS dog DEM 1-RP-do thus FCT 1 RFLX DTR 1-PSSR buriti juice spill ‘The dog caused me to spill my juice (i. e. it ran across my way, I tripped on it and dropped the bowl with the juice).’

263

Here we note the occurrence of the particle ne between the two clauses. The presence of the conjunction suggests that in (93) the clauses expressing cause and result are not as formally bound to each other as those in (92). On the other hand, both clauses fall under the scope of the same modality marker, which is confirmation that they still constitute a single sentence.
The structural differences observed in (92-93) correlate with slight semantic distinctions. In both (92-93) the causers are animate beings, except that in the former the causation may be understood as intentional whereas in the latter the causer is unaware of its acts. This nuance is motivated by the fact that the causer in (92) holds a higher degree of volition for it is a human (or human-like) being.
Finally, a third syntactic pattern may be noted in (94).

(94) ? i-j-apen ja na ri ic-t-ѐ ane na pa 1-RP-work DET RLS DEM 1-RP-do thus RLS 1 ‘My work is already making me tired.’

Here, a new token of the modality marker na in the second clause suggests that cause and result are expressed by two independent sentences. It should be pointed out, however, that my consultant considered the sentence (94) somewhat odd; such a construction could only be found in an elicitation situation. The reason for the oddity is probably the fact that the higher agent here is an event, and not a participant. A more

264
natural way for expressing a meaning similar to that of (94) would be with a different structure, involving the postposition kure ‘reason’. This is illustrated in (95) below.

In sum, the Apinajé periphrastic causative is characterized by the occurrence of ѐ ane as the causative predicator plus a subsequent clause encoding the result. The result clause is not a complement of ѐ ane but rather in a paratactic relation with it (literally: “you did me this way, I [V]”); in addition, the accusative argument of ѐ ane ‘do thus’ must be coreferential with the first argument of the result clause. Differences in the structure of a periphrastic causative correlate with the human-ness/volitionality of the causer: if that argument is not an inherently volitional being, the first clause is linked to the second one by the conjunction ne.

265
Morphological causative. The morphological causative is characterized by the occurrence of ѐ ‘causative’ preposed to the lexical verb of a clause. Even though stress patterns indicate that ѐ is not a prefix on the verb, the ѐ V complex may be regarded as a compound, since no intervening elements are allowed between the two morphemes. Accusative agreement is attached to ѐ. The examples of morphological causativization by means of ѐ found in my corpus apply only to monovalent verbs.

In the periphrastic causative, ѐ is the causative verb, which ultimately precedes the predicator encoding the result, but each of these verbs has its own valence frame. Moreover, in that context the same degree of relevance is attributed to both cause and result, and the focus is on the intentions of the causer. The morphological causative, in turn, encodes direct manipulation and consists of a single predicator whose valence has been increased by one, via by the morpheme ѐ preposed to the lexical verb. Functionally, the morphological causative is really about the result of a causal chain, and therefore it focuses on the effect on the causee. This functional distinction is the motivation for the juxtaposition that has yielded the ѐ V construction in Apinajé: what is in focus here is the fact that the causee is affected by the agent/causer; thus, the causee is expressed simply as the patient argument of the verb derived with the causative morphemeѐ.
In the morphological causative, the lexical verb then turns out to have the same distribution relative to ѐ as the manner adverb in a given clause; but that does not necessarily make an adverb out of it: the fact that the lexical verb shares an argument with ѐ and that the latter has a very generic meaning makes it easier for ѐ to become reinterpreted as belonging to a distinct category − a derivational morpheme, in the case at hand − than for the lexical verb to be reinterpreted as a manner adverb.

267
The establishment of the new function for ѐ as a morphological causative is effected by the generalization in the usage of the construction. The examples in (99), in which inanimate participants occupy the position of the erstwhile higher agent, illustrate this.

Criteria (h-j) for the establishment of Apinajé grammatical relations involve other complex constructions. Of these criteria, equi-deletion follows a nominative pattern while subordination requires ergative case-marking. In coordination, coreferential deletion varies according to whether the verbs involved are transitive or descriptive. Details on each construction are presented in chapter V.
The criteria proposed here are applied to noncanonical predicates in the next section.

268
4.7. Grammatical relations and noncanonical predicates in Apinajé In this section, I comment on the typology of grammatical relations with noncanonical marking predicates proposed in Onishi (2001), and compare those generalizations with what may be observed in Apinajé, once the relevant criteria are applied to the noncanonical predicates of the language.

4.7.1. Imperatives In his typology, Onishi (2001) points out that non-canonically marked A/S tend not to occur in languages where only second person A/S is allowed in imperative constructions, since they refer to non-controllers; but that they seem to occur marginally in this type of construction, in head marking languages.
In Apinajé, many noncanonical predicates can be found in the imperative of command; these are presented in (100-102) below.

2-RP-think.about

‘Remember me!’

4.7.2. Reflexivization Different types of noncanonically marked arguments may behave differently even within the same language, with respect to control over reflexives. In Hindi-Urdu, for instance, dative, genitive and locative arguments control reflexivization, but instrumentals do not (Onishi 2001).
In Apinajé, noncanonical predicates of the set presented in ((49) section 3.3.1) do not allow reflexivization (103), which means that these are really monovalent predicates, and not predicates that involve third-person impersonal verb forms.

(103)

* na pa * na pa * na pa

amْi=mђ amْi-mђ amْi=mђ

prђm ba kor

...and so on.

On the other hand, verbs from all other sets may participate in reflexivization, as illustrated in (104-106). In particular, note that both types of noncanonical subjects control coreference with the reflexive, the ergative A in (105.a) and the dative A in (105.b).

4.7.3. Coreferential deletion Onishi (2001) observes that languages with clear syntactic derivations have
constraints on many clause-linking devices; for instance, they may required that one of two coreferential arguments be deleted in such contexts (what Dixon 1994 terms “pivot conditions”). Languages in which semantic roles dominate the process typically lack these constraints, whereas languages with noncanonically marked arguments have an

271
intermediary status. In general, noncanonically marked A/S are more likely to control pivot constraints than to become targets of such constraints. Some languages allow predicates with non-canonically marked A/S to occur both in the main and the complement clause. In general, restrictions on the occurrence of predicates with noncanonically marked arguments are more likely to apply when they function as target of coreferential deletion in the complement clause.
In Apinajé, most, if not all complement-taking verbs are noncanonical predicates. There seems to be no restrictions as far as the occurrence of noncanonical predicates in complement positions either. Under coreferentiality conditions, all relevant arguments are marked with person prefixes on the verb and the postposition, as applicable. However, no independent pronouns occur in the subordinate clause, that is, there is A/S coreferential deletion. On the other hand, when there is no coreferentiality between A and/or S of both clauses, the occurrence of the ergative marker in the subordinate clause is obligatory.

4.8. Conclusions At this point, sufficient evidence has converged to argue for a convincing
grammatical category of Subject, a morphologically heterogeneous category that is united by syntactic behaviors. In future research, this category might become even stronger, as the database lacked examples of noncanonical predicates with noun phrase coordination, in sentences that engage the switch reference system, and in valency-changing derivations. In any of these, the noncanonical A arguments might share yet one more syntactic pattern with the canonical A.
In contrast, the search for syntactic properties that distinguish the categories of Direct Object and Indirect Object was unsuccessful, leaving a potentially interesting topic for future research.

CHAPTER V
COMPLEX CONSTRUCTIONS
0. Introduction The present chapter discusses those construction types that encompass more than one predicator within a single syntactic unit. Arguments are typically shared, but that may not necessarily be the case. In functional terms, what I will be discussing here are the domains of (a) complementation, understood, in the sense of Noonan (1985), as a complex structure involving a clause that serves as argument of a matrix verb; (b) relativization, a clause that serves as modifier of a head noun, thus belonging within a noun phrase; (c) adverbial clauses, those expressing contextual or circumstantial information that serves as a frame for the main event described by the matrix verb, that is, clauses that modify a verb phrase or clause; (d) constructions expressing aspectual meanings, such as the inchoative, the progressive, and the continuous; and (e) the comparative of superiority. Causative constructions, discussed in section IV.5.2, also constitute one type of complex construction in Apinajé, since they are expressed by the types of syntactic strategies described here.
In structural terms, these functional domains are expressed in Apinajé by means of subordination embedding, parataxis, and serialization. Many cases of complementation make use of embedding, while in others parataxis is used (Noonan

274
1985: 44; 55). The alternation between one type of construction and the other within this domain is determined by the syntactic properties of complement-taking verbs, which are, in general, of the non-canonical marking type. The alternation between subordination and parataxis is observable also among the different types of adverbial clauses, although parataxis is more frequently used.
On the other hand, relative clauses are always embedded inside the noun phrase. Certain properties commonly found in subordinating constructions, such as the use of the nonfinite form of verbs, are also necessarily employed in the expression the comparative of superiority and one type of inchoative construction. The structural properties observed in the latter cases, which are typologically less common, are crystallized and presumably result from the diachronic development of source biclausal constructions, in which the modern main verb was subordinate and the modern postverbal particle was the main verb. The original main verbs eventually became reanalyzed and grammaticalized as function words, which they still are in the synchronic stage of the language.
Serialization is a structural strategy often used for the expression of the progressive and continuous aspects, as well as the more adverbial manner nuance.
The discussion proposed here is intended to be broad enough that it will touch on the various structural strategies observed in the corpus for the expression of typologically common functional domains, but it is by no means intended as an exhaustive account of the inventory of complex predicates and constructions found in Apinajé. That is a task that requires continued analysis of the data already found and yet to be included in my database. For the time being, however, the present chapter should serve as a

275
representative sample. The formal properties of subordination, parataxis, and serialization in Apinajé are introduced briefly in the remainder of this section; subsequent sections elaborate on structure in further detail, along with the functional domains expressed by each structure.
Subordination in Apinajé requires that the relevant verb be inflected for nonfiniteness. The ergative case marker may or may not mark the A argument, depending on coreference conditions. In complementation, the distribution of a subordinate predicate is the same as that of the equivalent nominal. The matrix verb occurs in final position, postposed to the subordinated element.
Paratactic clauses are finite, displaying the very same structure as independent simple clauses. Parataxis may require the same-subject or different-subject switchreference markers, where pertinent, and it often involves morphemes from the TAM clitic inventory.
Serialization requires the nonfinite form of verbs when the (causative or instrumental morpheme) verb ѐ ‘do’ is involved. Otherwise, it is just the bare form of verbs that occur in a sequence; in this case, the verbs involved are usually from the class of intransitives (i.e. they take no inflection in their finite form). In Apinajé, serialization always involves either a movement verb or a position verb. Not all verbs belonging to each category are eligible for serial constructions expressing aspectual meanings, but only a selected few. When verbs from outside this inventory are used, the resulting overall meaning of the construction is more literal than grammatical, sometimes yielding awkward or jocose meanings.

276
General criteria used for deciding whether these clauses or predicators in a sequence all belong in a single complex syntactic unit are of three kinds: prosodic, morphological, and syntactic. From the prosodic point of view, the elements of each complex construction belong within a single sentential intonation contour. Morphologically, there is only one mode marker for the whole construction, such that all elements fall under its scope. In regard to syntax, boundary indices and the internally cohesive distribution of elements in the sentence are indicative of the internal coherence of serialization and embedding constructions, whereas switch reference and other markers are indicative of the internal coherence in the context of parataxis. Other, more specific criteria can be identified for each construction type, and will be introduced in what follows.
1. Complementation The examples of complementation existing in my database consist of clausal complements occupying positions other than that of a sentence subject. Additionally, the overwhelming majority of complement-taking predicators are of the noncanonical marking type, most often involving the use of the dative postposition mђ. These may be mere coincidences; however, there has been at least one instance in which I tried to elicit a sentence that included a clausal complement in subject position, and speakers offered paratactic clauses, instead.

277
As already mentioned, the use of subordination for the expression of complementation requires that the subordinate verb be in its nonfinite form. The subordinate clause occupies some position between the matrix verb, which occurs in final position, and the positional clitics normally occupying sentence-initial position. Since the complement-taking verbs noted all involve the use of a postposition for marking one of the core arguments (which could be either A or O, depending on the verb), it is often the case that the clausal complement will be immediately preceded by this case marker, when A is the noncanonically marked argument.
The examples in (1.a-d) illustrate the parallel distribution of clausal complements with that of an O noun phrase. The noun phrase in (1.a) occurs immediately preposed to the matrix verb (which therefore displays its relational prefix-equivalent form pubu) and postposed to the dative phrase that indicates the A argument of the verb in question.
In (1.b-c), the subordinate verbs are transitive and intransitive, respectively; the internal structure of the clausal complement thus reflects this difference in transitivity. Comparing (1.b) with (1.d), in which both subordinate verbs are transitive, it is possible to notice the presence of the ergative marker in the latter, but not in the former. The ergative case marker in (1.d) indicates that the A argument of the subordinate verb is not coreferential with that of the matrix. The subordinate A arguments is thus overtly expressed in the embedded clause.

In (2-3), one will notice that the inflectional pattern of the complement-taking verb is slightly different than that of (1). In (1), the matrix verb stem follows a transitive pattern of inflection, whereas in (2), the matrix verb follows a descriptive pattern of inflection. That is, in (2), the first argument of the matrix verb is indicated by both an independent pronoun (when it occurs) and the person prefix attached to the verb. In its turn, the dative marker attaches to the constituent that refers to the (noncanonically marked) O argument of the verb in question. When that constituent is a clausal complement, the dative marker follows the final boundary of the subordinate clause.

In (3.a), the main verb is intransitive and is here used with a locative postpositional phrase. In (3.b), the complement clause, which structurally takes the object position within the matrix, is marked by the dative. In (3.c), the matrix verb is a

279
bivalent verb of descriptive inflectional pattern with a non-canonically marked O argument. In (3.b), both the matrix and subordinate clauses share these morphosyntactic characteristics. Notice that in (3.d) the A argument of matrix and subordinate verbs are coreferential.

In contrast, the example in (4.a) presents a regular transitive verb with a dative oblique participant. In subordinate position (4.b), the clause requires the presence of the ergative marker, since it is now a subordinate clause whose A argument is not coreferential with that of the matrix verb.

The parataxis strategy is also employed for the expression of complementation, as already mentioned. In my database, complement-taking predicates that employ this strategy are utterance and manipulation predicators, as illustrated in (5). The presence of the switch reference marker ْum indicates that the A argument of the second clause is a third person, coreferential with the O argument of the first clause, ickra.

(The “say” part of the meaning is indicated by the dative postposition mђ combined with the predicator ane.) The possibility that the second clause is an imperative clause is disconfirmed by the intonational pattern of the sentence.

281
2. Relativization Relativization in Apinajé is necessarily expressed by means of subordination. Thus, other morphosyntactic properties internal to Apinajé relative clauses include the facts that the verb must occur in its nonfinite form and, if it is a transitive verb, the ergative case marker must occur on the first nominal constituent of the subordinate clause. Additionally, the definite marker ja must occur at the end boundary of the clause, being optionally preceded by the agent nominalizer cwђْ, which occurs most often (though not strictly) with verbs of action or activity. The order of elements remains basically the same as in simple clauses.
Relativization is carried out by means of both internal and external relative clauses (meaning “internally headed” and “externally headed,” as in the terminology and typology proposed in Keenan 1985, inter alia). The choice for one or the other strategy depends on the position being relativized. Positions that may be relativized are A, S, O and the dative/recipient (Keenan and Comrie 1977; Givón 2001b). When an external relative clause is employed, it will be of the postnominal type, as the RC will come postposed to the head noun.
Of the positions that may be relativized, S and O form verb phrase-internal absolutives and are thus grammatically required to occur in internally headed relative clauses; however, the head may occur externally if a third person resumptive pronoun is employed in the required position. The ergative A is always external to the RC, with the person prefix (or the suppletive form) of the ergative marker serving as a resumptive

282
pronoun. A relativized dative participant is external to the RC, with no need for a resumptive pronoun.
The examples in (6) illustrate these points. (6.a) shows the regular use of the verb are ‘tell’ in a simple clause, for comparison with the other constructions. In (6.b), the noun b᭣ ‘man’ is the understood head of the RC and occurs within the restrictive clause. That is so because b᭣ is the second argument of the verb are, and accordingly, it occurs immediately preposed to the verb, which takes the relational prefix; the same is true of di ‘woman’ in (6.c), the S argument of the verb ca ‘stand’. In (6.c-d), on the other hand, the relativized element di ‘woman’ is the A argument of are ‘tell’. The external relative strategy applies in this case, with the restrictive clause following the head noun. Notice in (6.d) the presence of the third person ergative marker kѐt inside the subordinate clause; the ergative case marker is coreferential with the external head noun and serves as a resumptive pronoun.

The examples in (7-9) further illustrate the point. In (8), the relativized element is the dative participant, which also occurs internally in the relative clause. Thus the instances in which externally headed relative clauses occur include mostly cases of ergative relativization, but are not limited to this. For instance, consider (9.b), where the second argument of the verb, mekђdϯcђ ‘medication’, appears in initial position in the sentence. Inside the relative clause, the subordinate verb appears without the relational prefix, since its object is not contiguous to it. Examples of this kind were not very frequent during elicitation sessions. It is possible that this fronting of the object of the RC is a pragmatic strategy for placing it under focus, in which case this construction would be more marked than those in which the relativized object occurs internal to the relative clause. It is also possible that this is all artefacts of elicitation; further (textual) examples are still needed for clarification of this point.

Strategies for case-recovery in Apinajé relativization are the use of resumptive pronouns, which are zero in many cases, but which may also come attached to the ergative marker (or expressed by its suppletive form, in the case of the third person). Otherwise, it is pragmatics that indicates which grammatical relation is being relativized.

285
3. Comparative of superiority The expression of the comparative of superiority in Apinajé is done by clausal
subordination to the predicator j-akrϯْ ‘more than’, which is apparently the nonfinite form of the verb akrϯ ‘pass straight by [sby]’. This is a rare instance of a nonfinite verb form operating as a main clause predicator; the nonfinite form could be analyzable as a participial form, perhaps, which would make it structurally and semantically equivalent to a descriptive predicator (in terms of person marking and adjectival semantics). And indeed, it inflects as a descriptive because all nonfinite forms take person marking and obey an absolutive pattern.
The comparative construction includes the ergative marker as an index of the matrix clause subject, which is the starting point of the comparison. The bound pronominal marker on the comparative predication jakrϯْ refers to the second element in the comparison, that against which the matrix subject is being compared. The subordinated clause refers to the property (or event) being compared and it takes instrumental case marking.

The subject of the subordinate instrumental clause is coreferential with that of the matrix. Within the subordinate predicate, the verb usually comes modified by an

286
intensifier, which highlights the “property” aspect of the compared element (e.g. ‘work hard’, ‘make-money well’).

Semantic ambiguity may arise with transitive instrumental subordinates, in that the scope of the comparison may either encompass the predication as a whole, or it may be restricted to the second argument of the subordinate verb. The ambiguity may be resolved by further clarification, e.g. an extra clause (12), or from the context.

4. Inchoative aspect: kac᭣w The morpheme kac᭣w, which may appear as a purpose marker in other circumstances, encodes the inchoative aspect when in predicate position, as illustrated in (13-14). Here, the form of the verb under its scope is nonfinite, and the distribution of the predication is similar to that of the clausal complements introduced above. The examples show that the use of this strategy for the expression of the inchoative applies to intransitive, descriptive, and transitive predicates alike, including non-canonical marking predicators.
Example (13) illustrates the use of the inchoative with an intransitive verb that includes a locative oblique participant.

The examples (14.a-c) show the use of the inchoative with non-canonical marking verbs of sensation and emotion. In (14.c), the verb in question is bivalent; however, no ergative marking is involved, as its first argument already takes a case marker, the dative mђ.

On the other hand, the examples in (15.a-b) involve plain transitive verbs. Under these conditions, the ergative case marking is required and it agrees with the clause-initial independent pronoun for the category of person. The same is true in (15.c), with the difference that here the predicator is a non-canonical utterance verb.

As may be seen from the examples, then, kaciw operates in a way similar to other subordinating predicators, even though it is not a verbal stem elsewhere. A languageinternal diachronic hypothesis is that this morpheme – which is actually a morphologically complex stem in that it includes the formative ka-, like other verbs – must have evolved from a verbal source and retained the syntactic property of a

289
subordinator, despite the absence of productive verbal morphology at the synchronic level.
5. Adverbial clauses In the present section I will discuss two types of adverbial clauses found in Apinajé, both of which involve the presence of specific morphemes, which indicate the syntactic relationship between the matrix and the adverbial clause.
5.1. Ri constructions The particle ri serves as an indicator of sequential relation between events, as described by clauses in a sentence. The particle appears in two kinds of constructions: the first translates as ‘SBJ will X, then SBJ will Y’; the second translates as ‘before SBJ X, SBJ will Y’.
In the first construction (‘SBJ will X, then SBJ will Y’), the particle ri is immediately postposed to the clause(s) describing the first event in the sequence; the clause expressing the second event occurs last in the sentence. In the examples below, the two events in sequence share the same subject, so the subject is mentioned only once at the beginning of the sentence.
Example (16.b) is more complex in that the first event of the sequence consists of two clauses – i.e. two minor events: the wait for the potatoes to cook, and the cooking of the potatoes. Within that domain, the subjects of the first and second events are distinct,

290
thus the different-subject third person conjunction occurs in the second clause. Although there is no structural evidence of subordination between the clauses expressing the first and second events, the ‘cook’ clause stands in a complement-type relation with the ‘wait’ clause, albeit semantically. For the purposes of the construction being described in the present section, those two clauses are taken here as if constituting a unit.

[Lit.: “At the conclusion of my waiting for my potatoes to cook, I’ll eat.”]

The second possibility (‘before SBJ X, SBJ will Y’) includes the negative marker ket. Here, the order of the clauses is reversed in the sentence: the first clause encodes the event that should happen last in the sequence; the particle ri occurs postposed to this clause and the negator ket modifies its predicate.

‘Before I bathe I will rub oil on my hair.’

[Lit.: “At my having not bathed, I will rub oil on my own hair.”]

Thus, the particle ri is always postposed to the first clause in the sequence; whether that clause indicates the initial or the final event of the sequence depends on the occurrence of the negative marker ket.
Some aspects in the overall structure of ri constructions which show that the rimarked clause is in fact structurally subordinate to that in sentence-final position are as follows. In examples (16.a) and (17.b), repeated as (18) below, the sentence-final clauses have the typical distribution of a main predicate, and the subject of each is that expressed by the nominative pronoun at the beginning of the whole complex sentence. As for the ri-marked elements, they have the distribution that a postpositional phrase would have, and they come marked with a postposed particle that, in other contexts, may function either as a demonstrative or a locative. An alternative semantic interpretation of the rimarked expressions in the examples below then could be, respectively, ‘at/upon/when [clause]’. Hence the alternative translations:

5.2. The postposition kutep The morpheme kutep marks a temporal adverbial construction, which consists of
clauses that encode simultaneous events. The clauses in question do not occur in a subordinating relation: they occur in a paratactic relation with one another and each has its own subject. That the clauses involved belong in the same sentence is indicated by the fact that they fall under the scope of the same mood marker; and by the intonation pattern of the utterance, which clearly includes them both.
The morpheme kutep is a postposition that indicates something like ‘in one’s stead’. Functionally, it clearly indicates the simultaneous relation between the events described in each clause. As to its distribution in the sentence, it occurs in the clause that serves as the ground event with respect to which the other, simultaneous event is located.
The person index occurring in kutep refers to the subject of the second, “figure” clause in the temporal relation, as expressed by agreement with the independent pronoun.

6. Progressive aspect Constructions involving the combination of movement or position verbs with the morpheme ѐ are widely employed for the expression of aspectual nuances. Among these, the progressive and the continuative are the most common. In constructions of this type, the ѐ V sequence follows the lexical verb of the clause, which appears in its nonfinite form.
Consider the examples in (20). In (a), the regular use of the verb t᭣ in a simple clause is illustrated. In (b-c), the lexical verbs of each clause co-occur with the sequence ѐ mõ ‘do go’ and ѐ nõ ‘do lie’, respectively. The lexical verb appears in its nonfinite form, as already mentioned, whereas the other two verbs appear without any sort of inflection whatsoever. Both examples (20.b-c) encode the progressive aspect.

EXCL DEM DEF.ART

‘That one is lying there crying.’

In examples (20) as well as (21-22), we notice the use of the verb mõ ‘go’ with lexical verbs of varied semantic nuances, such as ‘die’, ‘disappear’ and ‘mature’. This

294
fact demonstrates that the meaning of the movement verb is not literal, although it must be compatible with the semantics of the lexical verb to some extent. It indicates a metaphorical transition from a previous stage to a new one: from life to death, from appearance to disappearance, from green to ripe.

mature.NF do go

‘It’s getting ripe already.’

ѐ mõ do go

Compared to (20.b) and (21-22), it is possible to note that similar constructions involving position verbs focus more on the activity being performed, ‘cry’, ‘fasten’, ‘dance’ (23), rather than the result accomplished after the activity has been concluded.

(23) a. na pa kѐt=mђ

‘You are dancing.’

(I.e. ‘It is you who are dancing.’)

pi katprϯ wood fasten.NF
ca stand

ѐ ْ᭣ do sit

Not all movement verbs are eligible for appearing in this construction type, as they yield literal rather than grammatical meanings. Thus, the verb te ‘go’ in (24.a) indicates the actual movement of the participant as s/he fastens the wood sticks; that is,

295
there are two simultaneous actions going on. Comparatively, the examples in (24.b), involving the dative postposition mђ in place of the morpheme ѐ, indicates literal movement towards the locus of an action.

RLS 1

1-PR-GEN wood fasten DAT go

‘No, I’m headed that way to fasten my dry wood.’

Some alternative hypotheses are possible for the analysis of the morpheme ѐ in this context, since this marker appears in various positions with distinct meanings, in the grammar of the language. One hypothesis could be that ѐ is the instrumental postposition in the examples above, and that would even justify the nonfiniteness of the preceding verb; after all, in order for it to be the object of a postposition, it must be more nominal than verbal – and that is what nonfinite verb forms are, in Apinajé.
Another hypothesis is that the morpheme ѐ appearing in these contexts is the transitive verb ‘do’, which likewise could require a more nominal form of the lexical verb. According to this interpretation, the sequence of elements involved could be analyzed as a case of verb serialization, including the lexical verb, the verb ѐ, and the movement or position verb.

296
One morphological detail to keep in mind is the absence of a relational prefix in ѐ, which has analytical consequences for both hypotheses proposed, since both verb and postposition take relational prefixes in Apinajé.
In the analysis presented here, I opt for the transitive verb analysis, for at least two reasons: First, it is typologically common for serial verb constructions to encode aspectual meanings such as the ones noted here. Second, there is evidence leading to the conclusion that the instrumental postposition has evolved from the verb ѐ ‘do’ (Oliveira 1998).

297
CHAPTER VI
CONCLUDING REMARKS
In the previous chapters I have provided an overview of the core aspects of Apinajé grammar – its phonology, morphology, simple clause syntax, and complex constructions and predicates. Despite its preliminary character, the description presented here is intended as a fresh contribution to the study and documentation of Apinajé, especially because, for the first time, the morphology and syntax of the language are treated in detail and from a non-formalist perspective. The functional-typological approach adopted in the present study has made possible a richer and more fluid anaysis of the data, especially in regard to certain puzzling patterns, such as the association of subordinating morphology with certain domains of the grammar.
It has been noted, for instance, that the negative clitics not only require such morphology, but display a morphological make up that may be seen as evidence for a verbal diachronic origin, namely, the consonant k-, analyzed here as a reflex of the third person accusative prefix. Other factors that have been considered are its clause-final position and its possiblity of occurrence with the clitic ne. The presence of this clitic suggests an affinity of the form ket with the class of descriptive verbs, in that some of them often co-occur with the morpheme ne. These are simple observations, however, and need to be further investigated.

298
The morphosyntactic and distributional facts about the negative morphemes suggest that they may have all originated diachronically from verbal sources. At least in regard to the morpheme ket, a plausible hypothesis is that it must have started out as a monosyllabic negative predicator of tV structure, and that the kV- syllable is a reflex of the accusative prefix ku-, also noted in other function words, such as kumrϯc ‘INTS’ and
kѐt ‘3.ERG’, among others (see chapter IV). The hypothetical predicator *tV must have been responsible for the negation of the proposition described in the clause, thus requiring the nonfinite form of the subordinate verb; whereas the morpheme ku- could have operated as an anaphoric/resumptive pronoun, referring back to the negated proposition. Verbs do take noun phrases as arguments; and it is quite possible that the distribution of ku- was restricted to cases of propositional, not nominal, negation in a past stage of Apinajé.1 However, since the most frequent scope of negation is the proposition, the use of the *kVtV form may have become more standardized, leading to its reanalysis as the negative stem of Apinajé thus replacing other related forms elsewhere in the grammar. As far as phonological changes, one could speculate a path such as *kute > *kete > ket, for Apinajé, with vowel harmony and eventual deletion of the stem final vowel. In any case, it is no longer possible to speak of ket and ketne as true verbs in
1 In Kaingang (Southern Jê), one of the negative markers is indeed a monosyllabic morpheme beginning in /t/: tõ ‘NEG’ (Wiesemann 1986). However, in that language this form of the negative is employed in narrow scope negation, specifically, in the negation of nouns; sentential negation is expressed by a similar ket morpheme. (Thanks to Eduardo Ribeiro for calling my attention to this piece of data, in personal communication.)

299

Apinajé. These morphemes have now become positional clitics which do not display the full morphosyntactic behavior and semantic content of a lexical verb.
Other elements that may have involved the prefix ku- in earlier times include the ergative markers and the intensifier kumrϯc. While it seems plausible that the intensifier may have evolved from a verb, given its final position in the clause and the role it performs, as a modifier of the predicate, the same may not be said of the ergative markers.
The ergative markers tϯ and kѐt must have evolved from a nominal source. My claim is based on their distribution in the sentence and their function in present-day Apinajé syntax, as case markers of nominal elements. However, the possibility that the prefix ku- may have participated in the development of the suppletive third-person form of the ergative is also present here – a path that I propose for the other two postpositions that display suppletive forms, namely, the detrimentive and the dative, as well. The hypothesis is displayed schematically below:

(1)

*ku-mђ

> kђ-mђ > kђm ‘3.DAT’

*ku-pe

> ke-pe > kep ‘3.DTR’

*ku-tϯ

> kѐ-tϯ > kѐt ‘3.ERG’

The idea proposed in (1) is that all three postpositional markers may once have been used with the third person prefix ku. With the frequency of use, the vowels involved underwent certain phonological changes, such that non-low vowels ended up in full harmony, whereas in the environment of a low vowel, only partial asimilation took place,

300
such that the high back vowel became lowered. Eventually, all word-final vowels were lost, giving way to a heavy monosyllabic word.
In this vein, it is hoped that this description of Apinajé will serve as a basis for future historical and comparative work, which will allow the testing of the various internal reconstructions proposed here, and which will also allow the creation of new, fruitful comparative hypotheses for the reconstruction of the phonology and grammar of Proto-Jê.

prfx.pers. second person prefix. Grammar: Encodes the direct object of transitive verbs, the subject of descriptive verbs, and the object of postpositions. Phonology: allomorph ah– before voiceless obstruents; allomorph a– before pre-nasal and nasal consonants. advl.neg.cmp. never . Ex.: Na tϯ da wr᭣ ruْ ne dѐ ْum go ja a upђm ket ne. ‘It rains a
lot, but this creek has never been deep.’ See rђБђ ‘always’. v.tr. cut (deep, of skin and body parts; of wood). Ex. Pa na pa am¯i) jaˆk ¯um itkabro atkapi) ‘I cut myself and my blood spilled.’ Nonfinite form: aˆk (before consonants), aˆr (before vowels and consonants). Inflection pattern and relational prefix: O=j-aˆ. Related forms: u-j-aˆ ‘brocar’ (elderly). Grammatical restrictions: *Na pa ku-j-aˆ. *(?) Aw-j-aˆ. *Na ra aˆr ç te) ‘S/he went and cut as they went’; Na ra aˆr/ujaˆr ç mõ ‘S/he was cutting/was about to cut’. See kˆjt. prfx.der. detransitivizing prefix. Grammar: a. Occurs in a large group of intransitive verbs, some of which do not have a transitive counterpart characterized simply by the absence of this prefix. In such cases, the occurrence of the prefix appears to have been lexicalized, and the prefix might be better analysed as a formative in the stem, rather than a derivational prefix. b. The presence of this prefix in most verbs simply indicates intransitivity; there is a contrast between this and the prefix aw- in that the latter appears to encode the antipassive. See aw-. v.intr. scatter. Nonfinite form: S=pigrђْ. Ex.: Ja na mϯ pipѐ ketne; na mϯ ђm ajgrђ
ne mϯ ca. ‘These are not side by side; they have scattered around.’ Na mϯ di jaja
atpen tѐ pipѐ ѐ mõ akup᭣m pigrђْ pa. ‘The women go into pairs then they scatter back again (of a traditional dance).’ n.inal. head adornment. Inflectional pattern: PSSR=j-aБkђ. v.intr. select, choose a place (e.g. for planting a crop or building a village). See kapi, ukapi. n.al. hole.
n.dim. cashew (sp.), Port.: cajuí
n.aug. cashew (sp.), Port.: cajú
n.al.cmp. cashew patch
n.cmp. trap for birds, Lit. “jaó cage”. It is set up on the ground for catching birds that move around by walking; rice is commonly used as bait. n.inal. tail, of the long kind, as that of an armadillo or a cow. Relational prefix: j-abˆ.
Ex. Boc jab᭣ ‘the bull’s tail’. v.tr. 1. cling; hold on; remain close, resisting separation. 2. carry. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=j-abҶ. Nonfinite form: abҶْ. Grammar: This verb appears to
be a derived counterpart of the transitive verb bҶ. Intensifiers such as tђjc, rac and ruْ
have slightly different readings when used with each verb. Ex.: Na pa abҶْ tђjc ne. ‘I

n.cmp.aug. pirana (sp.), Lit.: big black pirana. v.intr. ponder; feel; meditate. Nonfinite form and relational prefix: S=j-aba. Grammar: This verb has a bivalent, noncanonically-marking counterpart in O=mђ A=j-aba. Ex.: Na mϯ kѐtmђ aba. ‘They are still podering/feeling.’ n.inal. ear. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: PSSR=j-abak. Alternate form: aba. n.inal.cmp. ear piercing. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: PSSR=j-abak kajwђr. (abak=kajwђr ‘ear=pierce.NF’) n.inal.cmp. inner ear. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: PSSR=j-abak krϯ. (abak=krϯ ‘ear=hole’) n.inal.cmp. earrings. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: PSSR=j=abakђmkђc. (aba-kђm-kђc ‘ear=3.DAT=frame’) n.inal.cmp. wood sticks used as adornments for the ears. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: PSSR=j=abakђmpi. (aba-kђm-pi ‘ear=3.DAT=wood.stick’) n.cmp.der.act. forgetful. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: EO=ѐ S-jabaketkatiji. Ex. Ce, pa na pa pe)r tE mebçj pit´) ç ijabaketkatiji‡ ‘Geez! I’m really
forgetfull of all things!’ (aba=ket=kati=ji ‘feel=NEG.EXST=recognize=NMLZ’) v.dscr.cmp. 1. stubborn; disrespectful. 2. deaf. 3. tease; mock or annoy playfully. Inflection pattern and relational prefix: S-j-abakrѐ. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: a. Used as a predicator but may also occur as a modifier within the noun phrase. In predicate position, uses clause-final particle ne. b. This verb has the counterpart ѐ abakrѐ. Ex.: Prirϯ ja na prϯ bϯc ne; tђ na ђbri ra abakrѐ ne. ‘This child used to be good, but now s/he is getting stubborn.’ MϯБõ kra ѐmdujti ne abakrѐti ja na iْõkw᭣ ijukri. ‘This ugly, disrespectful child lives near my home.’ Na mϯ abakrѐ ruْ ne. ‘They tease all the time.’ Na pa ijabakrѐ tђjc ne. ‘I tease a lot.’ (aba=krѐ ‘ear=spoiled’) See ѐ abrakrѐ. v.dscr. 1. think; be melancholic. 2. v.tr.noncan. remember; think about. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=j-abatper; OE=mђ S=j-abatper. Nonfinite form: same. Alternate form: abatpere. Ex.: Karõ na tϯ ictѐ ne pa kђm ijabatper. ‘The photos made me think about him.’ Na pa ijabatper. ‘I’m thinking.’ n.cmp.der.act. 1. reflective; pensive. 2. melancholic. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S-j-abatperji. Grammar: May occur as a predicator. Ex.: Abatperji ja na kri rac kђm pa. ‘The pensive one lives in town.’ Ka na ajabatperji. ‘You are pensive/melancholic.’ (abatper=ji ‘think=NMLZ’) Di muj na abatperji. ‘That woman is a pensive one.’ v.intr. 1. enter. Nonfinite form: S=cђr. Ex.: Acђ. ‘Come on in!’ Ma, pa iccђr ket ne. ‘No, I’m not coming in.’ Na pa ickrϯ mђ atѐ acђ. ‘I went into the house with you.’ Na pa pˆka kam´) icc‡ ‡´r ç mõ ‘I’m sinking into the dirt (lit.: ‘going into the dirt’).’ 2. v.tr.
enter. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=j-acђ. Nonfinite form: O=cђr. Ex.: Na pa ajacђ. ‘I brought you in.’ 3. v.tr. put on (of garnments, etc.). Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=j-acђ. Nonfinite form: O=cђr. Ex.: Na pa ice jacђ. ‘I put my clothes on.’ Na pa iْdѐmђkђc jacђ. ‘I put my eyeglasses on.’ Na pa icpakђ

jacђ. ‘I put my flip-flops on.’ Semantics: This verb root seems to contrast with agje in terms of number. Acђ is used when the absolutive argument is singular. See ѩr, agje. v.tr. 1. bury. 2. confine; incarcerate; arrest. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=j-acђ. Nonfinite form: O=acђn. Grammar: This verb has a derived intransitive counterpart in awjacђ. Ex.: Na mϯ kupedirϯ jaja kupip jacђ. ‘The kupe women buried the mat.’ Na pa pˆka kam´) ac‡´ ‘I buried it in the ground’. Na pa t᭣, ka ijacђ. ‘I died and you buried me.’ Na pa p᭣ka kamђ ajacђ. ‘I buried you in the ground.’ B᭣ ѐmduj cwђْ ja ata na prϯ mϯ ra acђ. ‘This bad man over there, he’s been arrested before.’ See awjacђ; ѐ acђ; cђ. b. There is a causativized version of this verb, ѐ acђ ‘sink’. Da na prϯ p᭣ka ja ѐ acђ. ‘The rain sunk the earth.’ n.aug. deer (sp.), the male specimen. Port: veado mateiro.
n.al.cmp.aug. snake (sp.), Port.: coral. v.tr. 1. place multiple objects upside down on a surface (e.g. on the ground or on a table). 2. place an object in horizontal position. 3. comb one’s hair. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=j=acwҶ. Nonfinite form: acwҶr. Semantics: One aspect in which this verb (and its counterpart i) contrasts with the pair ђm, ujwђ is that the former may refer to objects shaped in such way that would usually be conceived of as lying in horizontal position (e.g. forks and knives), whereas the latter often refer to those that could be thought of as “standing up” (e.g. bowls, plates, cups). On the other hand, the former pair may also refer to this same class of objects, but indicating that they lie upside down. Ex.: Na pa amْim iْõ kujϯ jacwҶ. ‘I’ve set my spoons down.’ Na pa amْim iْõ prat jacwҶ. ‘I’ve set my plates upside down.’ Akup᭣m iْmђ acwҶ. ‘Put them back for me, will you?’ Pa na pa kѐtmђ aki jacwҶr ѐ mõ ْum pђrti ma te. ‘I was still combing your hair and the truck left.’ Na ka tϯ ijabҶ pa tϯ gõr ђbri ka ijacwҶ. ‘You hold on to me, I sleep, and you put me to bed.’ n. likewise; similitive marker. Alternating form, –ac‡w´j´.
v.tr. 1. send. 2. invite; call. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=j-adѐ. Nonfinite form. Ex.: Pa na pa v´r ajadç ‘I sent you there.’ v.tr. squeeze. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=j-ade. Nonfinite form: same. Ex.: Na pa kѐtmђ iْõ cwҶ tѩm jade ne ѐ grђ. ‘I’m still squeezing my dough to dry it.’ n.al. the seed of the tiritica plant (see kaparϯ) used for making necklaces and other adonrments. Lexical restriction: *agђ Б᭣. The word Б᭣ is not appropriate because it refers to seeds that come from within fruits, shells or skins; that is not the case for the tiririca seed. v.tr. thresh; remove the seeds from the chaff (of rice). Nonfinite form, -g´)n. See agђ. n.al. 1. clay; mud. 2. starch; tapioca. v.intr. 1. enter. Nonfinite form and relational prefix: S=j-agje. 2. v.tr. thread pieces on a string (e.g. glassbeads); pull something through a whole. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=j-agje. Nonfinite form: agje. Ex.: Na pa mϯ agje. ‘We all went in.’ Iْmђ ken kwђ jagje. ‘Thread some beads for me.’ Iْmђpõْij᭣ u p᭣ pa amْi jabak kot agje. ‘Get me a little põ stem for me to hang on my ear.’ Semantics: This verb stem is used when the absolutive argument is plural. See gje; acђ. n.inal. saliva; drull . Relational prefix: ¯-ago v.intr. get damaged or impaired. Nonfinite form and relational prefix: S=j-agrђ.

Grammar: This verb seems to have a transitive counterpart: grђ. There is one example in the database that is indicative of this, but it is not to be confused with the verb grђ ‘dry’. Lexicon: This predicator may be simply an alternative use of the verb aْgrђ ‘scatter’. Ex.: Na ickrE krac‡ agr´ ‘The wall got damaged.’ Tђm na amْi grђ. ‘I got
damaged (i.e. it wasn’t me).’ See grђ; ajgrђ. n.dim. type of armadillo (Port.: rabo-de-couro). Lives in the rocky areas and is smaller in size, measuring about 20 cm as an adult. The female of the species typically has one offspring at a time, possibly two as it gets older. n.aug. type of armadillo (Port.: zumbi). Lives in the woods and is larger in size, measuring about 30 cm as an adult. The female of the species typically has one offspring at a time, possibly two as it gets older. n.al. (domestic) pig. n.al.dim. mammal (sp.), Port.: caititú.
n.inal. tail, of the short kind, as that of a deer or a cotia. Relational prefix: j-aj᭣. Ex. Kukenrϯ jaj᭣ ‘the cotia’s tail.’ v.tr. 1. grab (of mass nouns). Usually employs the quantifier kw´ to refer to the direct object. Ex. Na pa aroj kw´ jaj‡i ‘I got some rice.’ 2. take over, invade. Ex. Na go itpe i¯õrkwˆ jaji‡ . ‘The water took over my house (to my detriment).’ Non-finite form: aji‡ r. Inflection pattern and relational prefix: O=j-aji‡ . Grammatical restrictions: * Na ra aji‡ r ç te)/pa/bra; aji‡ r ç mõ. See pˆ, re, ta.
n.inal.der. hanger. (a-jor=cђ ‘INTR-hang.NF=INSTR.NMLZ’). See ajet, jo. v.intr. 1. lie on a surface above the ground (e.g. on the branch of a tree); be suspended. 2. be hanging. 3. reach; catch up with someone. Nonfinite form: S=jet. Grammar: a. Clause typically includes a postpositional phrase expressing the location in which S is suspended or from which it is hanging. If a location from which S is hanging is not specified in the clause, it may be expressed as kђc pe ‘from a [hanger]’. b. *ѐ ajet. Ex.: Mϯkarõ kawђrϯ ђ ajet. ‘The photograph is (suspended) in the basket.’ Na mϯkarõ ickawђrϯ ђ jet ketne. ‘The photograph is not (suspended) in my basket.’ Na ka ickawђrϯ ђ azet ket ne. ‘You are not (suspended) in my basket.’ Dѐ kђc pe ijet kete. P᭣kap na pa nõ. ‘I’m not hanging. I’m standing on the ground.’ Mϯ ajetcwђْ ‘one who stays suspended’. Pa na pa ђ ijet ѐ mõ. ‘I go reaching for the trees (using one tree to get to the next one).’ Na pa ra atђ ijet ѐ te. ‘You’re almost reaching/catching up with me.’ See jo. v.tr. cut. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=j-akђ. Nonfinite form: akђr. Ex. Na pa ak´r ket ne ‘I haven’t cut it.’ 2. v.dscr. cut; trimmed. Inflectional pattern and
relational prefix: j-akђ. Nonfinite form: akђr. Ex.: Co na krђБki na akђrti. ‘Your hair is all cut/trimmed.’ AkrђБki jakђr ja butrϯ. ‘Your haircut looks pretty.’ See krђБta; krђБ᭣r. 3. mix. Grammar: Form combined with the causative morpheme ѐ. Ex.: Paj amْimђ iْõ ѐ akђ ne kuw᭣ kamђ amْim ђm. ‘I’m going to to mix up my food and set it on the fire.’ See kђ. v.dscr. 1. round; spherical (e.g. of berries). 2. short in length (e.g. of garnments and shoes) or in duration. Sociolinguistic: The second sense of this word is used especially by speakers of younger generations. Speakers of older generations tend to use the term krђn, instead. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=j-akѐt. Nonfinite forms: same. Ex.: Ickabro jakçt rE ‘My period lasts a short period of time.’

n.der.act. a person characterized by the habit of talking; prattler. (akaper=ji ‘talk=AG.NMLZ’) v.dscr. spin; turn around. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=j-akec.
Grammar: This verb cannot take the detransitivizing morpheme aw-: *awjakec. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: This predicator has a bivalent counterpart in ѐ akec. Ex.: Ajakec! ‘Turn around/spin!’ n.der.act. stealer. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=j-akiْji. (akiْ=ji ‘steal.NF=AG.NMLZ’). v.tr.noncan. 1. yell at someone; swear at someone. 2. argue with someone. 3. call someone. Inflectional pattern: E=mђ akiri; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form and relational prefix: A=j-akjer. Ex.: Na me i¯m´) akjer ketne. ‘They are not calling
(upon) me.’ Na ka tϯ iْmђ ajakjer ѐ akri. ‘You keep arguing with me.’ Neْ na tϯ me kђm akjer ѐ kri ti. ‘That one keeps swearing/yelling at people.’ Kђm ajakje ketne. ‘Don’t call him!’ See ѐkure; ѐpre. v.tr. open a hole (e.g. in a wall made of palm leaves). Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=j-akje. Nonfinite form: akjen. Ex.: Pa na pa krϯ krac jakje. ‘I opened the hole (in the wall).’ Atђ iْmђ akje. ‘Open (it) for me.’ Akjen ketne. ‘Don’t open it!’ Na ickrϯ krac akje ne ca. ‘The wall is open (i.e. there’s a hole in it).’ Tђm na amْi jakje. ‘It opened itself (i.e. “I didn’t do it”). See atkje; ѐ atkje; kje. v.tr. smoke. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=j-ako. Nonfinite form: same; alternate form: akor. Related form: awjako/cujako. n.der.act. one who is known for smoking (cigarrettes) constantly. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=j-akoji. (ako=ji ‘smoke.NF=AG.NMLZ’) Ex.: Di muj cikar
jakoji. ‘That woman is a cigarrette smoker.’ See ako; ujako, ujakoji. v.dscr. be cold. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=j-akr᭣. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: a. In predicate position, the relational prefix does not show with a third person S, since the third person participant appears in subject position, and there is zero third person agreement marking. In attributive constructions, the verb does take a relational prefix with a third person participant, and that indicates both elements belong within a single noun phrase. b. This verb has a bivalent counterpart in ѐ akr᭣. c. This verb can take the detransitivizing morpheme aw-: awjakr᭣. Ex.: Na pa ra ijakr᭣ ѐ mõ. ‘I’m already cooling off (because the fever is gone).’ Na ra go akr᭣. ‘The water has already cooled off.’ Na ra rõr ᭣ twђm akr᭣. ‘The rõr fat has cooled off.’ Rõr ᭣ twђm jakr᭣ na uti. ‘The babaçú fat get thick when it cools off (the cold babaçú fat is thick).’ Kѐtmђ go jakr᭣ kete. ‘There’s no cold water yet.’ See mђ kr᭣. n.al. ice.

Phonology: In the context of an identical subsequent vowel, there is an epenthetic flap [r] that separates the two, as in icpikudѐr ѐ mõ. Grammar: This verb has a bivalent version, ѐ akudѐk. Ex.: Pa kѐt paj akudѐ. ‘I’m going to disappear.’ Ka na ka akudѐ. ‘You’re going to get lost.’ Pa kѐt paj icpikudѐ ketne. ‘I’m not going to get lost.’ Ka kѐt kaj apikudѐ ketne. ‘You’re not going to get lost.’ Na ka icpe apikudѐr ѐ mõ. ‘You’re disappearing from me.’ See ѐ akudѐ. v.intr. laugh. Nonfinite form and relational prefix: S=pi-kujar; alternate form: S=pikujari. Grammar: May occur with the locative postposition ђ, indicating EO. n. forest; thick wilderness. adv. back to; centripetal movement. Requires one of two referential suffixes: –ˆm and –ˆ¯: akupˆm ‘back to here’; akupˆ¯ ‘back to there’. v.intr. gather; get together and form a group (esp. of people). Nonfinite form: S=pikuprõ. Grammar: Occurs with the causative morpheme ѐ. Ex.: Kot paj mϯ akup᭣m akuprõ. ‘We’re getting together again.’ Na pa mϯ ra akup᭣m icpikuprõْ kac᭣w. ‘We are about to gather again.’ n.inal. mouth. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: PSSR=j=akwa. pro.pers. third person emphatic pronoun. num. two n.cmp. shade v.intr. 1. scream; utter inarticulately and loudly. Nonfinite form and relational prefix: S=j-amra. 2. v.tr.noncan. yell. Inflectional pattern: OE=mђ am᭣ra. Nonfinite form and relational prefix: OE=mђ A=j-amra. Ex.: Kѐt ka akudѐ ne amᳳra. ‘If you get lost, scream.’ Ajamra ketne. ‘Don’t yell!’ Na pa iْmђ ijamra prђm ne. ‘I feel like screaming.’ Na pa iْmђ ajamra prђm ketne. ‘I don’t want you to scream.’ v.intr. dream. Nonfinite form and relational prefix: S=p-imtir. Phonology: [pimdir] pro. reflexive marker. Grammar: May occur in a truncated form with the dative morpheme mђ, resulting in the form amْim. Idiom. Feel ill; suffer from disease. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: [amْiS c-ђ]O ba. Nonfinite form: amْi cђ bar. Grammar: The reflexive pronoun refers back to the S of cђ, whereas the predicate amْᳳ cђ is the O of the verb ba. (Amْi=c-ђ=ba ‘RFLX=RP-ill=feel’) See amْi kamђ abak. Idiom. Feel better; recover from disease. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: AmْiS kamђ S-j-abak. Nonfinite form: same. Ex. Na pa ra amْi kamђ ijabak ѐ mõ. ‘I’m feeling better.’ v.intr.noncan. play; enjoy onself. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: Although the reflexive marker occurs with this verb, the reflexive-verb root pair have become lexicalized as a single predicator. The word kati by itself means ‘waist’; there is no evidence for its use as a verb. In addition, the compound predicator may apparently have its valency increased by means of the morpheme ѐ, in ѐ amْi kati. Ex.: Na pa

form and relational prefix: S=j-apѐ. Grammar: a. The use of plural nouns may require the co-occurrence of the dual marker. Presumably, this peculiarity has to do with the semantics of the verb. b. This verb has a causative counterpart, ѐ apѐ. c. This verb allows for variation in nonfinite forms. It is possible that this variation is determined by the meaning of the verb in each use. Ex.: Akrecti ne Kenkutђ wa apѐ ne

marked with the postposition wђr.) Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=j-apoj. Nonfinite form: same. 3. v.tr.noncan. find something (pl). Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=mђ A=j-apoj. Nonfinite form: same. Phonology: In nonfinite position, especially preceding a vowel, the last consonant of the root is realized as the voiced alveolapalatal affricate [j], as in poj ѐ mõ. Semantics: The semantic contrast between this verb and katѐ has to do with the number of participants, katѐ being the singular and apoj the plural counterpart. Grammar: a. In the compound verb ‘wake up’, the verb roots alternate according to the number of the absolutive argument, thus: krђkatѐ ‘wake up (sg.)’ and krђapoj ‘wake up (pl)’. b. The same is true when the root is used with directional postpositions such as wђr ‘ALLT’ and mђ ‘DAT’. C. This verb cannot take the detransitivizing morpheme aw-: *awjapoj. Ex.: Na pa mϯ ijapoj. ‘We left.’ Na pa mϯ kђm ijapoj. ‘I found them.’ See katѐ. v.tr. make holes. Ex. pi) j‡ˆ rE na tE pi) japok ‘The termites make holes in in wood.’ Form with relational prefix, -japok. v.tr. slander someone. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=j-aprҶ.

Ex.: Na ijaprҶ. ‘That one slanders me.’ Na ka ijaprҶ. ‘You dishonor my name.’ Na pa ajaprҶ. ‘I gossip about you.’ Na ijaprҶ ѐ ca. ‘That one has been gossping about me.’ Muj na ijaprҶ ѐ ri pa. ‘That one has been gossiping about me.’ Paْi na kѐt atpen tѐ kaper prђm, ne kђm atpen kure ne kђm atpeْ ja prҶ prђmђ. ‘Panhi like to speak of each other, they get angry at one another then fight and slander one another.’ See ujaprҶ; ujaprҶji. v.tr. become satisfied; finish. Relational prefix: -japr´) v.tr. provoke; tease. Ex. ickra ja na amni icpr´) ne ‘My son is provoking me.’
v.tr. 1. bring; take. See ѐ mõ, ѐ te. 2. buy. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=j-apro. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: This verb can take the detransitivizing morpheme aw-: awjapro. advl.cmp behind. the last one in a line; the last thing to be done. n.inal. wing. v.tr. dig (of potatoes, etc.). Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=j-are. Nonfinite form: areْ. Related forms: areْ (detransitive form); areْi (participial resultative form). Ex.: Kwђr ja na pa ra areْ pa ‘The yucca, I’ve dug them all up.’ Kwђr ja na areْ pe ѐmduju ‘This yucca is hard to dig.’ Kѐt aْ᭣r tђ na pa are ‘It’s that way, but I’ve dug it nonetheless.’ Na ra areْi ‘They are all dug up.’ See re. v.dtr. 1. tell. 2. confide about oneself. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: EO=mђ O=j-are. Nonfinite form: areْ. Grammar: a. The transitivity pattern of this verb is the same for both senses. In the second sense, O is encoded by the reflexive pronoun, which is controlled by the subject. b. This verb can take the detransitivizing morpheme aw-: awjare. See awjare. v.dscr. 1. jump on or onto the ground; land. 2. dance in a festival. Nonfinite form and relational prefix: S=j-ari. Ex.: Te na ajari ne atѐ. ‘Jump and stand on the ground.’ Atѐjarѐrϯ ѐ na pa ijari ѐ ca. ‘I’m dancing with Atѐjarѐrϯ.’ Na akrђْapõpti ѐ grϯr ѐ ca mϯ ѐ ari ѐ ca. ‘They are singing and dancing to the akrђْapõpti.’ n.al. 1. sunshine; 2. daytime. Alternate form: anigrѐ. Ex.: Arigrѐ tђjc! ‘The sun is hot!/It’s too hot/bright!’ n.advl.cmp. at daytime (arigrѐ=Бђ ‘sunshine=LOC’).Ex.: Arigrѐ u Бђ ‘Some other day.’

Nonfinite form and infectional pattern: S=pi-tѐm. Grammar: a. This verb takes the clause-final particle ne. b. There appears to be free alternation between finite and nonfinite form when this predicator is modified by kac᭣w. Both forms were possible, according to speakers’ judgements; however, there was preference for the nonfinite form when the clause was realis, and for the finite form when the clause was irrealis. Ex.: Kѐt paj mϯ akup᭣m atѐm ne. ‘We’ll walk together again.’ Kѐt ja mϯ akup᭣m atѐm ne. ‘Those are going to wander around together again.’ Kѐt paj mϯ akup᭣m icpitѐm ketne. ‘We won’t be walking together anymore.’ Na pa mϯ akup᭣m icpitѐm kac᭣w. ‘We were about to walk together again.’ Kѐt paj mϯ akup᭣m atѐm kac᭣w. ‘We will gather again.’ See akuprõ; agrђ. n.al.dim. bird (sp.).

Nonfinite form and inflectional pattern: S=pikaje. Grammar: a. This verb does not have a transitive counterpart in kaje. b. There is evidence of free variation between pikaje and atkaje as nonfinite forms; in the latter case, it is not possible to tell from the examples what the inflectional pattern is. Ex.: Ka na ka icpe i¯õ kukrac‡ me) ¯um atkaje ‘You threw my bowl and it cracked.’ Pa kѐt paj ђbri iْõ

Ex. Pa na pa amْi) jaˆk ¯um ickabro atkapi) ‘I cut myself (accidentally) and my blood spilled/dripped.’ v.intr.der. 1. break into pieces; shatter. 2. crack; fissure. Nonfinite form and inflectional pattern:. Grammar: This verb does not have a participial counterpart in pithe same way as other verbs of breaking. Ex.: Na kѐp tem ne atkatϯ. ‘The glass fell and broke [it wasn’t me].’ Kѐp ja na ra ѐbu ْum ra atkatϯ. ‘I saw that glass and it was already broken.’ *Kop ja na pikatϯ. See katϯ.

prfx.infl. detransitivizing prefix. Grammar: Occurs mostly, though not exclusively, with verbs that begin in /a/ and take the relational prefix j-. This morpheme contrasts with the other detransitivizing prefix aC– in that it appears to encode the antipassive and other uses of this category. In this sense, it appears to be better characterized as an inflectional rather than derivational morpheme. See aC- ‘detransitivizer’. n.cmp. dust n.cmp. brejo v.intr.der. sow; plant.

Ex.: Na ra awjakrˆ ‘It is getting cold.’ Na ra awjakr᭣ ne. ‘[The weather] is already cool.’ v.intr. return. Nonfinite form and relational prefix: S=c-u-j-anђ. (Finite form: aw-janђ ‘INTRZ-RP-?’; nonfinite form: c-u-j-anђ ‘RP-INTRZ-RP-?). Grammar: a. This verb follows the same morphological patterns as other derived intransitive verbs belonging to the aw- class. However, there is no evidence for the existence of anђ as a verb on its own. It is possible that this form may have been monomorphemic once, but has become lexicalized through history. b. This predicator follows the same pattern as awjako in subordinate position, in that it does not employ the ergative marker kѐt/tϯ; instead, it occurs in constituency with the noun, evidence of which is the presence of the relational prefix in such contexts. Ex.: Di cujanђ cwђْ muj ja na inђ na. ‘That woman who has returned is my [formal] mother.’ See aw-. v.intr.der. shop; purchase items for a party or a festival. Nonfinite form and relational prefix: S=c-u-j-apro. (Finite form: aw-j-apro ‘INTRZ-RP-buy<TR>; c-u-j-apro ‘RPINTRZ-RP-buy.NF’). Ex.: Paْi ma tem cwђْ ja na ma ujapro ma te dѐm poj kac᭣w ђ b᭣t pubuْ ketne. ‘The person who went do the shopping doesn’t know what time s/he will come back.’ Di kѐt ujapro cwђْ ja na inђ na. ‘The woman who went to do the shopping is my [formal] mother.’ Kѐt kaj ma kri rac mђ te ne iْmђ awjapro. ‘[I want] you to go downtown and do some shopping for me.’ Na pa iْmђ ame ْum ma atem ne atϯ iْmђ acujapro prђm ne. ‘I want to send you downtown so you can do some shopping for me.’ Na pa ma kri rac mђ te ne ictϯ amْi mђ icujapro kac᭣w. ‘I [want / intend to] go downtown to do some shopping for myself.’ Na pa iْmђ kri rac mђ ictem ne ictϯ amْi mђ icujapro prђm ne. ‘I feel like going to town and do some shopping for myself.’ See apro. v.intr.der. tell stories.

n.inal. kinship term n.al.aug. rodent (sp.), Port.: capivara. v.intr. 1. go on foot; walk. 2. stroll. Nonfinite form: S=brar. Semantics: The semantic contrast between this verb as against mõ/te apparently has to do with the number of participants (bra being plural) as well as the specificity about going ‘on foot’ . Grammar: The root may cooccur with the directional/movement particle ma in the clause; the combination of particle and verb root means ‘go’. If the particle is absent in the clause, the verb root means ‘come’. v.tr. wake up. Inflectional pattern: O=bra; no relational prefix.

Prt.disc. index of hearsay information. Alternate form: ce. v.intr. stand in vertical position (of one or a pair of objects or people). Nonfinite form and inflectional pattern: S=cђm; alternating form: S=car. Semantics: The semantic contrast between this verb and kuБe appears to be that the former indicates movement towards standing position, whereas the latter indicates being in that position. However, only ca seems to occur in constructions that require position verbs, indicating, in this case, something already in standing position. This hypothesis is at odds with the morphological class of each verb and their correlation with descriptive and eventive notions. Another hypothesis is that the contrast may have to do with the number of participants, ca being the singular and kuБe the plural counterpart. A third hypothesis is that both verbs mean ‘be standing’, but with the semantics of kuБe focusing on the resultative aspect of getting up, and ca not having such connotation. Ex.: Pa na pa ca. ‘I’m standing (here).’ Kђtmђ ca. ‘Stand up (few people).’ Na ka va kђْmђ ca. ‘The two of you stood up.’ See kuБe. n.inal. strips of fiber extracted from palm leaves in general. v.tr.cmp. wait for.

(cw‡ ´=t√m ‘yucca.dough=raw’) cl. phrase-final clitic, nominalizer of agent. Grammar: This morpheme occurs in relative clauses indicating the relativized noun, which may be a subject or object. Structurally, it is placed at the end of the relative clause and is followed by the definite article ja, or another determiner. Its occurrence in this context appears to be optional. Ex.: B᭣ t᭣ cwђْ ja na prϯ kђm apen prђmђ. ‘The man who died enjoyed working.’ Di piagri ѐ nõ cwђْ muj na icprõ na. ‘That woman who is giving birth is my wife.’ Na grE¯õc‡w´jn kutђc kçkç ç c‡a ‘The singer is playing the maracá.’ B᭣ ra kengrђ cwђْ ja na grϯْõcwђْ ja. ‘This man who is tired is the singer.’ B᭣ ѐmduj cwђْ ja ata na prϯ mϯ ra acђ. ‘This bad man over there, he’s been arrested before.’ See ji. n.al.aug.fem. kinship relation term, vocative.

(da=a-cet ‘rain=dtrz-burn’). Alternate form: da acen. Grammar: The presence of the formative a- in this word makes it comparable to words such as amgrђ ‘drought; dry season’. In both cases, the base of the word is a descriptive verb. It might even be possible to include awjakr᭣ in the equation. Ex.: Da acet ka:pri. ‘It’s lightning a little.’ n.al.cmp. 1. thunder. 2. v.intr. thunder. (da=katõtõk ‘rain=?’) n.al.cmp. 1. rainy season; 2. v.intr. rain. adv.cmp. 1. at a certain time in the past. 2. for a long stretch of time. No inflection.

Nonfinite form, de. n.al. woman. n.inal. pelvis n.al.loan. owner (Port.: dono). v.dscr. bad; ugly; badly. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=p-uduj; alternate form: çmduj. Nonfinite form: same. Alternate form: puduju/ѐmduju; this form does not occur in nonfinite position. Grammar: This verb may occur with the clause-final clitic ne, which expresses temporary state or condition, in this context. Ex.: Ata na ѐmduju. ‘This one (over there) is bad.’ Ata na ђm ѐmduj tђjc kumrϯc. ‘That one is really mean!’ Na pa icpuduju. ‘I’m ugly/mean/sickly.’ Na pa icpuduj ne. ‘I look ugly/am being mean/am sick.’ Mϯ kadϯcђ duj ja mari ame. ‘This spoiled medication you may throw away.’ See ѐmduj. v.tr.noncan. tie; fasten. Inflectional pattern: OE=mђ e; no relational prefix. Grammar: a. One piece of evidence of the absence of a relational prefix for this verb is the ungrammatical form *aje (for “tie [it] up!”). b. When there is a beneficiary, the clause will contain two dative-marked nominals: one being the beneficiary and the other the dative-marked, extended O. c. This verb contrasts with prϯ, katprϯ in that it may have a participial reading with no change in form. Nonfinite form: same. Ex.: Kѐt paj pi mђ e. ‘I’ll fasten the lumber.’ Iْmђ iْõ boc mђ e. ‘Tie my cow for me, will you?’ Kђm e! ‘Tie it up!’ B᭣ pipђْ muj, na mϯ ra kђm e. ‘That drunk man, they’ve tied him up.’ B᭣ na ra kђm e ْ᭣. ‘The man is tied up, sitting.’ Pa na pa mϯ b᭣ jaja mђ e ѐ ca. ‘I’m taking care of tying up these men.’ Na pa mϯ kђm e pa. ‘I’ve tied them all up.’ Na mϯ ra pittђ mϯ kђm e pa. ‘They are all tied up.’ See kaprϯ; prϯ. n.al.cmp. fishing line.

v.intr. sing; dance. Nonfinite form: S=grϯr. Grammar: This verb cannot take the derivational morpheme ji: *grϯji. Ex.: Na pa iْgrϯr ѐ ca. ‘I’m dancing.’ K᭣j pu megrϯrpreprek kђm grϯ. ‘Let’s dance forró!’.

Grammar: In order to obtain a transitive version of ‘dry’, it is necessary to use the causative morpheme ѐ. The plain stem can only be used transitively with the specific meaning ‘roast farinha.’ Ex.: Na kupece grђ ѐ ajet. ‘The clothes are drying (hanging).’ Paj iْõkrђki ѐ grђ. ‘I’ll dry my hair.’ Kѐt paj iْõ cwᳳ grђ. ‘I will roast my farinha.’ Na pa kѐtmђ iْõ cwᳳ tѩm jade ne ѐ grђ. ‘I’m still squeezing my dough to dry it.’ Pa na icce õ grђ kete. ‘I have no dried clothes.’ Pa na pa arђm ђ ce grђ ijabђ. ‘I took my dried clothes off the clothesline.’ Na kѐtmђ icce grђ ѐ ajet. ‘My clothes are still up drying.’ v.tr. roast.

v.dscr. be or become angry. Inflectional pattern: S=gr᭣k. Grammar: This verb may occur with the innessive postposition kamђ in a noncanonical pattern of argument marking; in this case, the pattern is EO=kamђ S=gr᭣k. Ex.: Na ka ictѐ ne pa ѐmduj ne ْum ickamђ gr᭣k. ‘You made me treat her badly, now she’s angry at me.’ Ka ickamђ agr᭣k. ‘You got angry at me.’ n.cmp. jealous person n.al.der. one who can sing or dance; one who enjoys singing or dancing.

Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=c-i. Nonfinite form: ir. Grammar: Allows for third person accusative prefix ku-. Semantics: One aspect in which this verb (and its counterpart acwҶ contrasts with the pair ђm, ujwђ is that the former may refer to objects shaped in such way that would usually be conceived of as lying in horizontal position (e.g. forks and knives), whereas the latter often refer to those that could be thought of as “standing up” (e.g. bowls, plates, cups). On the other hand, the former pair may also refer to this same class of objects, but indicating that they lie upside down. Ex.: Na pa kuci ‘I’ve put it away.’ n.inal. bone. Inflectional pattern: PSSR=i; no relational prefix, apparently. Phonology: form alternates between ji and i. The former occurs after conosonant-final nouns and the latter after vowel-final nouns. v.dscr. thin; skinny. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=j-i. Nonfinite form: same. Also irϯ (i=rϯ).

Nonfinite form: same; alternate form: ikw᭣r. Semantics: This verb appears to contrast with nõ in terms of number. This root is used when the absolutive argument is plural. See nõ. Grammar: The verbs nõ ‘lie’ and ْ᭣

‘sit’ contrast with their respective counterparts ikw᭣ and kri in that the former seem to have a more flexible use, with respect to the number distinction of the absolutive, than

the latter. It is possible to find examples of mϯ nõ and mϯ ْ᭣, even though these verbs refer basically to singular and dual absolutives; but kri and ikw᭣ are often not found with singular absolutives. Ex.: Mϯ krarϯ jaja mϯ ikw᭣ ne. Mϯ piget jaja acwђj jaja, mϯ ђ ne ikw᭣. ‘The children were all lying (there). The elderly also, they were all ill and lying (there).’ Co na ka mϯ ari aْikw᭣. ‘Are you all lying there/resting? n.inal.der. place of rest; place for lying (ikw᭣=cђ ‘lie.NF=LOC.NMLZ’). n.inal. the top surface of any given body; tip.

(ipec=ji ‘make=ag.nmlz’) Ex.: kaw´ nipec‡ ji‡ ‘basket maker.’ Grammar: When ji is used with transitive verbs, the derived word may require the use of relational prefixes dependening on whether the verb root starts in a vowel. n.inal.der. father. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: PSSR=ْ-ipetcђ. (ipet=cђ ‘make.NF=INSTR.NMLZ’). n.inal. 1. the center of a particular space. 2. the midst (e.g. of a crowd). 3. the innermost area of a large location (e.g. a forest). Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: PSSR=n-ipok. Grammar: Due to its semantics, this noun is sometimes used similarly to a postposition; but its referential nature is also very clear. In cases of referential use, a postposition or demonstrative is likely to follow this noun, such that the integrity of the genitive construction (or, the NP) in which it occurs is maintained, thus avoiding any kind of structural ambiguity. Ex.: Pђr nipok ri. ‘The center of the forest.’ Pђr nipok. ‘In the middle of the forest.’ Kri rac nipok ri. ‘The downtown
area.’ Kri nipok. ‘In the middle of the village.’ Kapot nipok. ‘In the middle of the outdoors.’ Go nipok. ‘In the middle of the river.’ Arigrѐ nipok ri. ‘In the middle of the sunlight.’ [Notice the contrast in meaning between this ri-ending phrase and the ones above: it could be that in this phrase, the sense of the word is more one of ‘midst; being involved/engulfed by’, similarly to the next example.] MϯБ ipok ri. ‘In the middle of the crowd.’ *Na pa mϯБ ipok ca. Na pa mϯ ipok ri ca. ‘I’m standing in the middle of the crowd.’ Kѐt poj kapot nipok kot te. ‘We’re going to the center of the wilderness.’ Kri nipok kot te. ‘Go to the center of the kri.’ Pђr nipok kot te. ‘Go to the center of the woods.’ Go nipok kot te. ‘Go to the center of the creek.’ */?Kѐt puj kapot nipok ri wђr te. But Kѐt puj kapot nipok wђr te. ‘We’re going to the middle of the wilderness.’ Na wa ipok kђm ca. ‘The two of them are in the center.’ See kaec; ire. n.al.cmp. person from the inside; usually a reference to humorous, cheerful people.

It indicates that the referent is characterized by the event or state described by the verb, or that the referent constantly and/or enjoyably performs the action described by the verb. b. The derived form maintains the same inflectional pattern as the base verb. Ex.: Bis´nrE ja na prE tE ´) ickakeji ne. ‘This kitty

Inflectional pattern: O=mђ A=katѐ; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: mђ katѐr. Semantics: The semantic contrast between this verb and apoj apparently has to do with the number of participants, katѐ being the singular and apoj the plural counterpart. Grammar: a. In the compound verb ‘wake up’, the verb roots alternate according to the number of the absolutive argument, thus: krђkatѐ ‘wake up (sg.)’ and krђapoj ‘wake up (pl)’. b. The same is true when the root is used with directional postpositions such as wђr ‘ALLT’ and mђ ‘DAT’. Ex.: Na pa ickatѐ. ‘I left (the premises).’ Na pa uti ْipok ri kђm ickatѐ. ‘I found it out in the woods.’ Na pa kђm ickatѐ. ‘I found this thing.’ v.tr. 1. break into pieces; shatter. 2. break something open with a hard blow (e.g. a fruit with a hard shell, as a coconut or cupuaçú).

Phonology: katБpѐБrϯ n.inal. back v.tr. tie; fasten. Inflectional pattern: O=katprϯ; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: a. This verb is related to prϯ, which seems to be a participial form of
it. b. There are examples in which the form prϯ seems to occur as a nonfinite counterpart of katprϯ; in such cases, prϯ takes person inflection for object, and that contrasts with its use as a participial/resultative form. n.inal. back n.inal.cmp. backbone. v.tr. thresh; pound; crush. Nonfinite form, katw´r. n.amb.der. object used for pounding or crushing grains in. (der. ka/u) adv. more or less. n.amb. basket; one of the traditional designs of Apinajé basketry.

Ex.: Na pa ra ickengr´ ji‡ t´c‡ kumrEc‡ ‘I’ve been easily tiring, lately.’ psp. third person form of the detrimental postposition pe. cop. be; become. cop. third person form of the copula pe ‘be; become’. Grammar: The copula pe is used in nominal predicate constructions, especially those expressing equative predicates and true nominal predicates. It is not used in locative or possessive predicates. cl. negative marker; negative existential marker. Alternate form: kete. Grammar: a. This form is often used in nominal predicate constructions, although it is not restricted to it. b. This negative marker is used in clauses that indicate a habitual negative, or in a noun phrase that describes a negative property or habit of the head noun referent. Ex.: Ja na kom kete. ‘This person doesn’t drink.’ Ja na kѐt gwra kago ѐ kom kete.
‘This person won’t drink buriti juice.’ See ketne. cl.cmp. negative marker; factual negative marker. Grammar: a. This form is often used in verbal predicate constructions, although it is not restricted to it. b. This form is used in certain clauses expressing a nonhabitual negative. It contrasts with kete, in this respect. See ket. v.dscr. cheerful; happy; content. Inflectional pattern: S=ki. Nonfinite form: same.

v.tr. drag; pull. Inflectional pattern: O=kje; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: kjen. Grammar: Like other transitive verbs, this predicator may take the second person subject prefix in imperative clauses. However, this inflected form is not to be confused with the verb akje ‘open’. Ex.: Kri) pici‡ kam´) go kjen c‡´ ‘Only one of the
villages has water pipes (água encanada).’ Amnϯ akje! ‘Pull it over here.’ Kjen ketne. ‘Don’t pull it!’ n.inal.cmp. part of the thigh that meets the pelvic bones; the articulation of the thigh.

n.inal.der. afterbirth; placenta. (kra=cђ ‘one’s.child=LOC.NMLZ’) v.dtr.noncan. shoot (a gun). Inflectional pattern: EO=kamђ [kuce]O=krak. Lexicon: This verb is inherently transitive, but with an invariable O, the noun kuce ‘weapon’. This noun is often ommitted in clauses containing this verb, whereas the target is often overtly expressed, thus giving the impression that this is one of the many noncanonical verbs of Apinajé. v.tr. shatter; break into pieces (of things that are not necessarily long); smash. Inflectional pattern: O=krakra; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: same. Ex.: Na icpe ickukre krakra pa ‘Ele quebrou todas as minhas coisas (to my detriment).’ Na ictђ akwakrϯ krakra pa. ‘He smashed the door onto me.’ See atkra; pikra. n.inal.cmp. someone who is treated by one as one’s own child, although not related by blood or any formal kinship relation. (kra=purѐ ‘one’s child=alike’) Grammar: The form purѐ is related to the verb urѩk ‘be similar; be alike’. See kra, urѩk. n. beginning; starting point; an end. n.inal. 1. waist; 2. medial part of a long object (e.g. squash vines); 3. beginning. n.amb.cmp. pants (krat=k´ ‘leg=cover’) n.amb.cmp. long pants (krat=k´=rˆ ‘leg=cover=long’) v.tr. 1. eat food of one specific kind, regardless of the quantity. 2. swallow. Inflectional pattern: O=kre; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: krer) . Semantics: a. This verb contrasts with ku ‘eat’ in that the former refers to a single type of food, whereas the latter makes reference to a meal consisting of many different items. Thus, the notion of number plays a role in the contrast, although it is not controlled by the quantity of food as such but by the variety of the meal. Ex.: Na pa ra aroj kw´ kre)
‘I’ve eaten some rice, already.’ Pa kukre. ‘I’ve swallowed it (e.g. of a pill).’ Kupe
pђr᭣ kre cwђْ ja na ickrђmcwђ na. ‘This foreigner who ate pepper is my friend.’ See ku. n.al.cmp.aug. catterpilar (sp.), Port. taturana. (kre=kђ=ti ‘?=skin=AUG’) n.al.dim. bird (sp.), Port.: periquito (sp.) n.al.aug. bird (sp.), Port.: periquito (sp.)
v.dscr. 1. be seated. Inflectional pattern: S=kri; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form:
kri; alternate form S=krir. Semantics: The semantic contrast between this verb and ْ᭣ appears to be that the latter indicates movement towards sitting position, whereas the former indicates being in sitting position. However, only ْ᭣ seems to occur in constructions that require position verbs, indicating, in this case, something already in sitting position. This hypothesis is at odds with the morphological class of each verb and their correlation with descriptive and eventive notions. Another hypothesis is that the contrast may have to do with the number of participants, ْ᭣ being the singular and
kri the plural counterpart. A third hypothesis is that both verbs mean ‘be sitting’, but

kri)c´‡ kric‡ krikrit krit kro kru´ krw´ti ku

with the semantics of kri focusing on the resultative aspect of sitting down, and ْ᭣ not having such connotation. 2. v.tr. sit multiple people on a particular place. Inflectional pattern: O=kri; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: same. 3. n.al. village. Grammar: The verbs nõ ‘lie’ and ْ᭣ ‘sit’ contrast with their respective counterparts ikw᭣ and kri in that the former seem to have a more flexible use, with respect to the number distinction of the absolutive, than the latter. It is possible to find examples of mϯ nõ and mϯ ْ᭣, even though these verbs refer basically to singular and dual absolutives; but kri and ikw᭣ are often not found with singular absolutives. Ex.: Na pa ickri. ‘I stay seated [in a particular place]; I live [in a particular place].’ Pa na pa mϯ kђm ane ْum pipѐ ђ mϯ mϯ akri pa ka mϯ ْ᭣. ‘I told you guys to sit so you all be seated in the bench.’ Pipѐ ђ mϯ akri pa. ‘Sit on the bench.’ Mϯ dѐk᭣j mϯ akrђapoj ne kђْmђ akri. ‘Wake up, already, and get up (in sitting position).’ Neْ na tϯ mϯ kђm akjer ѐ kri ti. ‘That one always argues with others.’ K᭣j pu mϯ mõ kђْmђ mϯ kri. ‘Let’s lift them (such that they stay seated).’ See ْ᭣; ᭣r. n.al.cmp. seat.

Alternate form: kru. n.aug. fish (sp.), Port: traíra v.tr. eat, esp. a meal consisting of various kinds of food items. Inflectional pattern: O=ku; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: kur. Semantics: This verb contrasts with kre ‘eat’ in that the latter refers to a single type of food, whereas the former makes reference to a meal consisting of various food items. Thus, the notion of number plays a role in the contrast, although it is not controlled by the quantity of food as such but by the variety of the meal. Grammar: a. This verb has an intransitive counterpart formed by the accretion of the detransitivizing prefix aC-. b. The nonfinite form of the verb does not allow for the use of the accusative third person prefix ku-. c. When used in the context of this verb, the particle pa apparently refers back to the direct object, i.e. ‘all of OBJ’, rather than to the event/action described by the verb itself. Ex.: Kѐt paj kur pa. ‘I’ll eat all of it.’ Ata kur ket ne. ‘Don’t eat that.’ Na pa ra kuku. ‘I’ve already eaten it.’ Kaj kur pa. ‘Swallow them all (e.g. of various kinds of pills)’. See apku; kre. Prfx.pron. third person accusative marker. Grammar: a. This verb occurs overwhelmingly with monosyllabic verb roots. b. This prefix never occurs in nonfinite verb forms. c. It indexes the accusative argument of a finite transitive verb and the object of a postposition. v.dscr. stand in vertical position (of multiple objects or people). Nonfinite form and inflectional pattern: S-kuБe; no relational prefix. Semantics: The semantic contrast between this verb and ca appears to be that the latter indicates movement towards standing position, whereas the former indicates being in that position. However, only ca seems to occur in constructions that require position verbs, indicating, in this case, something already in standing position. This hypothesis is at odds with the

morphological class of each verb and their correlation with descriptive and eventive notions. Another hypothesis is that the contrast may have to do with the number of participants, ca being the singular and kuБe the plural counterpart. A third hypothesis

Inflectional pattern: O=me; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: The
use of this verb with the sense of ‘serve food’ contrasts with the verb re, with the same sense, in that the former requires the quantifier kwђ to determine meõ, whereas the latter occurs without the quantifier. One could describe the distinction also in terms of mass versus count objects. Ex.: Ka na ka i¯me) ‘You threw me.’ Te ne amْim meõ
kwђ me. ‘Go help yourself to the food.’ Me bra ne me amْim meõ kwђ me. ‘Go over there and help yourselves to some food.’ Mϯ kadϯcђ duj ja mari ame. ‘This spoiled medication you may throw away.’ See re, gje, ђ. v.tr. tie. Ex. me ick´ me ‘They tied me up.’ psp. Associative

Nonfinite form: S=mõ; alternate form: mõr. Semantics: The semantic contrast between this verb and te apparently has to do with the number of participants,
mõ being the plural and te the singular counterpart. Grammar: a. The root may cooccur with the directional/movement particle ma in the clause; the combination of particle and verb root means ‘go’. If the particle is absent in the clause, the verb root means ‘come’. See te, bra; ma. b. This root may be used with the morpheme ѐ in what appears to be a transitive verb compound, ‘bring/take’. c. This root may be used in Vѐ mõ (serial) constructions, basically expressing progressive or inchoative aspects;
it contrasts with te in this respect, in that the latter may not be used in many of these constructions. In such cases, mõ appears to have acquired a more grammaticalized meaning, whereas te is understood more literally, which makes its use inadequate. v.intr. dive. Nonfinite form and inflectional pattern: S=mrõ. Grammar: This verb cannot take the derivational morpheme -ji (*mrõmji), unless it is used as a transitive

Nonfinite form: S=nõr. Grammar: The verbs nõ ‘lie’ and ْ᭣ ‘sit’ contrast with their respective counterparts ikw᭣ and kri in that the former seem to have a more flexible use, with respect to the number distinction of the absolutive, than the latter. It is possible to find examples of mϯ nõ and mϯ ْ᭣, even though these verbs refer basically to singular and dual absolutives; but kri and ikw᭣ are often not found with singular absolutives. n.inal. 1. leaf. 2. bodily hair. Inflectional pattern: pssr=o; no relational prefix. Exx: kac´‡ t o ‘leaf from the cotton plant’; kabet o ‘jussara leaf’; iْiju o ‘the hair of my nose’. Phonology: apparently no glottal stop before o.

Nonfinite form: pϯn; alternative form: pϯْ. Grammar: The nonfinite form of this verb does not take the accusative third person prefix ku-. Ex.: Na pa ra kupϯ. ‘I’ve already drunk it.’ Na pa ickђdϯcђ pϯ. ‘I’ve drunk my medicine.’ Na paْi muj kagocҶti pϯn rac ne atpђ. ‘That person drank a lot of alcohol, s/he is drunk.’ Na pa kçtm´) atE a¯õ go kagrç pEjn ca‡ /´ ¯ˆ). ‘I’m still waiting for you to drink your tea.’ n.al. forest; the wilderness. v.tr. pick; get; hold.

Grammar: a. This verb apparently contrasts in number with ibϯc. b. The occurrence of the conclusive particle pa with this verb root indicates the end of the action; however, with its (presumably) plural counterpart ibϯc, the construction seems to be point to the entirety of the group of objects (i.e. “all of them”), rather than the conclusion of the action. Ex.: Na pa ra kupi. ‘I’ve killed it.’ Na pa kѐtmђ pir ketne. ‘I haven’t killed it yet.’ Na kѐtmђ icpir ketne. ‘They haven’t killed me yet.’ Na pa pir pa. ‘I’ve finished killing.’ See pi. n.al.cmp. seed (generic) used as material for body ornaments (e.g. necklaces, belts, etc.).

Grammar: This verb has a bivalent counterpart in ѐ piagri. Ex.: Na pa icpiagri. ‘I’m in labor.’ Na pa icpiagri ketne. ‘I’m not giving birth.’ Di piagri ѐ nõ cwђْ muj na icprõ na. ‘That woman who is giving birth is my wife.’ Di piagricwђْ muj na kra kђ t᭣k rϯ. ‘The woman who has given birth, her child is black.’ v.intr. nurse (on maternal breast). Nonfinite form: same; no inflection. Grammar: a. This verb has a bivalent counterpart in ѐ piao. b. Although this verb does not seem to take inflection in either form, it does require the occurrence of the ergative marker when in subordinate position. Compare with piagri, in that respect. Ex.: Na pa piao. ‘I’m nursing.’ Na pa piao ketne. ‘I’m not nursing.’ Prirϯ kѐt piao cwђْ ja na ickra ne. ‘This kid that’s nursing is my child.’ See Бo, kao; piagri. adv. 1. only 2. psp. only, p.ex. pa icpic‡ kavr´ ‘só eu catei’ n. fruit

Grammar: form related to the ambitransitive verb kaБek. Similar to the nonfinite form of aC- verbs, although atkaБek is a nonexistent verb in the language. The semantics and use of this form is adjectival, as in a resultative participial. Ex. Kukrac‡ pika/ek õ cw‡ ´jn ja na ka prE i¯m´) agõ ‘The broken bowl you gave to me.’ v.prtcpl. torn. Inflectional pattern: S=pikacoْ.. Grammar: related to the transitive verb

n.al.der. a conversationally playfull person; chaffer. Ex. Ka na apˆkeْji‡ ‘You’re a

transitive verb kuke ‘break into pieces’. Grammar: This is essentially a nonfinite form of the verb, even though it may occur in a regular finite position with no variation. The semantics and use of it is adjectival, as in a participial resultative. Ex.: Pipç na ra

Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: a. This form has the semantics of a participial resultative form, and follows a descriptive pattern of inflection. It is related to the verb katprϯ, which is a transitive counterpart it. b. There are examples in which the form prϯ seems to occur as a nonfinite counterpart of katprϯ. In such cases, prϯ takes person inflection for object, and that contrasts with its use as a participial/resultative form. Ex.: Kѐt paj akatprϯ. ‘I will tie you up.’ Iْmђ ickrϯkrac ѐ tђjc pa katprϯ. ‘Keep it steady against the wall for me (so that) I tie it up.’ Na pa mϯ katprϯ pa. ‘I tied them up.’ Na mϯ ra pittђ prϯ pa. ‘They are all tied up.’ Na b᭣ ra prϯ. ‘The man is tied up.’ Kѐt paj aprϯ ketne. ‘I will not tie you up.’ Kѐt kaj icprϯ ketne. ‘You will not tie me up.’ Kѐt paj prϯ ketne. ‘I will not tie her/him up.’ Icprϯ ketne. ‘Don’t tie me up.’ See katpre; e. cl. past tense n. 1. road; 2. footprints v.tr. cover with leaves.

Inflectional pattern: S=prek; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: same. Phonology: The final consonant of this verb is realized as a compensatory lengthening of the root vowel when it is followed by another consonant. If that consonant happens to be the coronal stop /t/, another effect is that the coronal will be realized as voiced. Ex.: B᭣ prekti muj na iْbjen ja. ‘That tall man is my husband.’ Pa na pa tϯ paْi prek kot icpa kete. ‘I don’t walk with tall people.’ Na b᭣ prek di. ‘The man is tall.’ adv. fast; quickly; 2. v.tr. rush. n.al.cmp. frog (sp.), Port.: sapo cururú.

v.tr. 1. leave; abandon. 2. allow. Inflectional pattern: O=rϯ; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: same. Phonology: The initial consonant of the verb is realized as the lateral alveolar approximant [l] in the context of a preceding coronal. Thus, /it-rϯ/ is produced [ilϯ]. Notice that there is no vowel length, which suggests the alternative hypothesis that it is the coronal vowel itself which is conditioning the alternation. Ex.: Mϯ pa jaja na pa mϯ prђ ne arik ْum mϯ kwђr jaja na m irϯ ne mϯ ma apec. ‘As for us, we were left behind and stayed, the others left us and went away.’ Kѐt ja irϯ. ‘S/he will leave me.’ Na ka irϯ. ‘You left me.’ Kѐt paj arϯ. ‘I will leave you.’ n.al. fruticferous palm tree, Port.: macaúba.

Semantics: The use of rac, as well as ruْ, seems to imply that the predicator being modified encodes a permanent property. Both these intensifiers contrast with tђjc in this respect, which is used with predicators encoding transitional or temporary conditions/states. Phonology: This morpheme is realized as [lac] if following a coronal sound — vowel or consonant. Grammar: a. This morpheme is used to modify verbs and nouns. There is no evidence

that it follows the inflectional pattern of descriptives. b. It may, in turn, be modified as well (e.g. by the morpheme kumrϯc). c. This intensifier is compatible with words derived by -ji, in contrast with the intensifier ruْ, which is not. d. There is evidence which indicates that, if used with a transitive verb, this morpheme may refer to the quantity of the direct object, rather than serve as an intensifier of the verb. Ex.: Go rac ‘river (water=large)’. Na ra iْmђ bϯc rac kumrϯc. ‘(Things) are really good for me.’ Ickengrђji rac ne. ‘I’m really easy to get tired.’ Na pa icpuduj rac ne. ‘I’m really ugly.’ Na bᳳn rac kumrϯc. ‘S/he carried lots of things.’ Na katpѐrϯ p᭣ rac kumrϯc. ‘S/he made a lot of money.’ Na pa jaraБђ abᳳn rac ne. ‘I carried you a lot.’ Na pa pђr ᭣ krђ ruْ kawrђ rac ne. ‘I harvested a lot of large peppers.’ See ruْ, tђjc, bϯc. n.al.aug.loan. radio, Port.: radio. v.tr. extrair, tirar, colher. Nonfinite form, –ren. Forma alternativa, re), re¯) . v.tr. 1. atravessar por dentro de um rio ou por uma superfície; 2. untar de ambos lados, p.ex. peixe na gordura. Nonfinite form, ren/rej. Ex. ict´) arej ket ne dç icu‡ p´m rac‡i ‘Não atravessem em mim não porque eu sou muito fundo (o ribeirão falando)’. v.tr. 1. throw (a ball), as in a game. 2. throw multiple, scattered things, or two things which do not form a pair. 3. help oneself to foods of various kinds. Inflectional pattern: O=re; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: The use of this
verb with the sense of ‘serve food’ contrasts with the verb me, with the same sense, in that the latter requires the quantifier kwђ to determine meõ, whereas the former occurs without the quantifier. One could describe the distinction also in terms of mass versus count objects. Ex.: Me ac‡w´j jaja apen kr´) ti re) ‘They are also going to play (with
the mangaba ball).’ Ma te ne amْim meõ re. ‘Go help yourself to the food.’ Me ma bra ne amْim meõ re. ‘Go and help yourselves to the food.’ See me, gje, ђ. v.tr. put away; release inside a closed area.

v.tr. see; visualize; look at. Inflectional pattern: O=rit; no relational prefix. Nonfinite

Phonology: The verb root may be realized as [lit] if the previous segment (i.e. the last segment of the preceding word) is a coronal sound – vowel or consonant. v.intr.evnt. agarrar-se a alguma coisa com o corpo encolhido. Nonfinite form, rõ¯ n. cupim v.intr.evnt. fall. n. planta do babaçu; o coco desta palmeira n.al.cmp. babaçú patch n.al.cmp. coconut patch v.dscr. 1. erode; collapse.

vowel or consonant. Semantics: The use of ruْ, as well as rac, seems to imply that the predicator being modified encodes a permanent property. Both these intensifiers contrast with tђjc in this respect, which is used with predicators encoding transitional or temporary conditions/states. Grammar: This intensifier is not compatible with words derived by -ji, and thus it contrasts with the intensifiers rac and tђjc, which are used in those cases. Ex.: Mϯõkrϯpoj ruْti ‘name of a traditional festival’ (mϯ=õkrϯpoj=ruْ=ti ‘INDF=voice=grand=AUG’).

v.tr. beat; abuse; beat up. Inflectional pattern: O=tak; no inflectional pattern. Nonfinite form: same. See tatak. psp.dem. there. Grammar: May take second person prefix a- and may occur with the third person demonstrative muj. In the first case, the resulting form is a proximal demonstrative with a second person as the deictic center, atar ‘over there (close to you)’. In the second case, the resulting form is a distal demonstrative, mujtar ‘over there (far away from us)’. There are no examples available in which tar occurs with a first person prefix. v.tr.rdpl.cmp. 1. hit repeatedly. 2. sprinkle something on a surface by tapping on it repeatedly. Inflectional pattern: O=tatak. Nonfinite form: same. n.al.aug. insect (sp.), Port.: carrapato. v.intr. come; go. Nonfinite form: S=tem. Semantics: The semantic contrast between
this verb and te apparently has to do with the number of participants, mõ being the
plural and te the singular counterpart. Grammar: a. The root may cooccur with the directional/movement particle ma in the clause; the combination of particle and verb root means ‘go’. If the particle is absent in the clause, the verb root means ‘come’.

Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=mђ A=ْ-᭣rϯ. Nonfinite form: same. Phonology: a. In the context of a following vowel, an epenthetic flap [r] separates the two, as in aْ᭣rϯr ѐ mõ. b. There is root-initial vowel alternation between [u, ᭣], such that [u] occurs in initial position (although it may fluctuate with [᭣], in this position) and [᭣] occurs systematically after the relational prefix. This process is observable in other verbs as well. Usage: This verb is used by older generation speakers with the sense desciberd in 2, whereas younger speakers tend to use the verb kaga, instead. Ex.: Na ka ra iْmђ aْ᭣rϯr ѐ mõ. ‘You’re already leaving me.’ Na kђm ickine tђ iْmђ urϯ. ‘He liked me but left me nonetheless.’ See kaga. v.dscr.der. ponder; wonder.

Comparar com –Zo‡ ‘cobrir’ e confirmar transcrição. n.? o lado de fora (?), p.ex. ickrE ujçpe (Explorar) v.tr. 1. place multiple objects right-side up on a surface (e.g. table, counter, or ground). 2. place multiple pots or pans of food on the fire so as to cook. 3. stick something into the ground, right-side up. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=c-ujwђ. Nonfinite form: ujwђْ.. Semantics: This verb (as well as its counterpart ђm) is used with reference to objects shaped in such a way that allow the speaker to conceive of them as “standing up”, such as plates or cups. Its use would be more problematic with objects such as forks and knives, for instance, since these kinds of objects are typically laid in horizontal position. Ex.: Kѐt paj amْim meõ kuw᭣ kamђ ujwђ. ‘I’m going to put my foods on the fire.’ Na pa ra amْim iْõ prat ne iْõ kѐpti cujwђ. ‘I’ve already set my plates and cups.’ Pa iْõ kѐp cujwђ ketne. ‘I’m not going to set my cups (e.g. at the table).’ K᭣j pu mõ kђْmђ mϯ ujwђ. ‘Let’s lift them (such that they stand right-side up).’ See ђm, acwђ. n.al.der. object on whose surface things are placed (standing up), e.g. a table or a counter.

Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=c-ujakoji. (u-j-ako=ji ‘INTRZ-RP-sleep.NF=AG.NMLZ’) Grammar: This noun has a counterpart which is derived from the transitive counterpart of the verb. Ex.: Di muj ujakoji. ‘That woman is a smoker.’ v.dscr.der. slander. inflectional pattern and relational prefix: c-u-j-aprᳳ. nonfinite

Forma contígua ao argumento, –pˆkrar krç. v.dscr.cmp. belch (with an offensive odor). Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=c-ukrarkrѐ; alternate form: S=p-᭣krarkrѐ. Grammar: The inflected form of this verb alternates between cukrarkrѐ and p᭣krarkrѐ. This may be a case of innovation in the making from one pattern to the other. It is possible that, for the basic form of the verb, presumably ukra, the use of one of the relational prefixes is steady, with no alternations. But this hypothesis needs to be verified in future research, as there are no occurrences of the basic verb stem in the database as it is. Ex.: Pa na pa icukrarkrѐ. ‘I’m burping.’ Na ka acukrarkrѐ. ‘You are burping.’ Neْ na ukrarkrѐ. ‘This one is burping.’ Na pa icp᭣krarkrѐ. ‘I am burping.’ Na ka ap᭣krarkrѐ. ‘You are burping.’ (ukrar=krѐ ‘belch=putrid’) n.inal.cmp. veia v.intr.evnt. secar; endurecer (de mel). v.tr. abraçar.

a água te leva’ c-upᳳm. v.dscr. deep. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=c-up´m. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: a. The transitive version of the verb is done by using the causative morpheme ѐ. b. The occurrence of the relational prefix in this descriptive does not seem to correspond to a difference between attributive and predicative positions, as is the case with jakr᭣ ‘cold’, for instance. Ex.: Na p᭣ka krϯ cupђm. ‘The whole on the ground is deep.’ Ict´) arej ket ne) dç icu‡ p´m raci‡ ‘Do not attempt to cross me because
I’m really deep (of a creek speaking).’ Da na prϯ go ja ѐ upђm. ‘The rain made the creek get deep.’ Na tϯ da wr᭣ ruْ ne dѐْum go ja a upђm ket ne. ‘It rains a lot but even so this creek never gets deep enough.’ v.dscr. stubborn; uptight. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=c-uprђrђ. Nonfinite form: uprђr. Ex.: Na pa icu‡ pr´)r´. ‘I’m stubborn.’
v.tr.noncan. 1. look or act like X. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: A-tϯ/kѐt O=p-᭣rѩk.

v.dscr. plant; sow. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=j-ђkrϯ. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: This verb has the transitive counterpart krϯ. Ex.: Na pa ra ij´krE pa. ‘I’ve already finished planting.’ Na ka ra ajђkrϯ pa. ‘You’ve already finished planting.’ Na ra muj ђkrϯ pa. ‘That one has finished planting.’ See krϯ. n.al.aug. bird (sp.), Port.: pavão.

Sim v.tr. 1. suck on a piece of fruit (e.g. mango); ingest juicy foods (e.g. honey). 2. drink the juice extracted from fruits or plants. Inflectional pattern: O=Бo; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: O=Бor. Semantics: This verb contrasts with its counterpart kao in that the latter refers specifically to the act of sucking the juice out of a fruit, e.g. an orange. Grammar: usually employs the quantifier kwᳳ when O is a mass noun. Ex.: Na pa manti Бo. ‘I ate the mangoes.’ Ma:di Бo tђjc ne. ‘I sucked the mango hard (until I got all the pulp off from it).’ See kao2, piao. n.inal. sperm. Inflectional pattern: PSSR=Бok.

Ex.: Pa na icѐpre. ‘I’m aggressive.’ Neْ na tϯ ѐprer ѐ kri. ‘The seated one is aggressive.’ n.al.der. the irritable one. n.al.der. one who gets angry easily; irritable. v.tr. 1. roast; grill (of larger chunks of food, e.g. meat, potatoes). Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=c-ђr. Nonfinite form: same. Ex.: Na pa iْõ br᭣ cђr ѐ ca. ‘I’m roasting my meat.’ Na pa kѐtmђ ђr ѐ ca. ‘I’m still roasting (it).’ Na grEri kr´)ˆrE c‡´n ne ç kuc‡wa t´jc‡ kumrEc‡ ‘Dada put the chicken to cook and now it smells good!’ Phonology: The basic form of the verb assimilates to the environment and is realized as [cђn], as it precedes the conjunction ne. 2. v.intr. roast; cook; grill. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=c-ђr. Ex.: ђw, na ra ´r´ ‘Yes, it is roasted.’ Na kѐtmђ ђr ѐ ca. ‘It’s still cooking.’ Na kѐtmђ meõ ђr ѐ ca. ‘The food is still cooking.’ Alternate finite forms: ђrђ. See kucot. v.dscr. enter. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=c-ѩr; alterate form: ѩrѩ. Nonfinite form: same. Semantics: It appears this verb does not participate in the number opposition that characterizes the verb pair acђ/agje, in which the former is the singular counterpart and the latter the plural one. Ex.: Na pa ra icѩrѩ. ‘I went in.’ Na tϯ ri akup᭣m ѩr p᭣rѩk. ‘Looks like it went in again.’ Ma, ata ra mϯ kapot ђ ca tђ na mϯ ra akup᭣m ѩr pa. ‘Well, they were all standing outside, but looks like they have all gone in now.’ See acђ, agje.

v.tr. cut off; remove; pick (of fruit). Inflectional pattern: O=᭣r; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: same. Ex.: Na pa ra iْõ pico ᭣r ‘I’ve already cut off my banana (bunch).’ Na pa iْõ pico ᭣r kaciw ‘I’m abou to get my bananas.’ Na pa iْõ pico ᭣r ѐ ca ‘I’m getting my bananas.’ v.tr. weave. Inflectional pattern: O=ᳳ; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: O=᭣r. Ex.: Na pa itkupip ᭣ ‘I wove my mat.’ Na pa itkupip ᭣r ѐ ْ᭣ ‘I’m weaving my mat.’ v.intr.evnt. come to a boil. Ex: Kѐt paj amْi mђ kuw᭣ kamђ meõ cђm, ْum ѐrѐt, ْum kao pa kukre. ‘I’m going to put my food on the fire, it will come to a boil, then it will be ready for me to it.’ n.inal. box. P.ex. me pri) m´) ´t aNõ me ç amni) kati ‘Give the box to the children for them to play with.’ conj. different subject, third person. intrj. yes v.tr. 1. place one object or a pair of objects of the same kind (e.g. a pair of sandals) into a deep recipient (e.g. a basket, a box, or a bag). 2. serve food (as a mass concept) in a deep container (e.g. a bowl). Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=c-ђ. Nonfinite form: ђr. Semantics: This verb contrasts with such others as me, re and gje on the basis of the category of number, among other details. Morphology: The verb ђ ‘serve’ is almost homophonous with the verb ђr ‘cook’, except that the former has a different finite form and a relational prefix, and the latter has the same form in both finite and nonfinite positions, and it has no relational prefix. Ex.: Na kѐtmђ meõ kwђ cђr ѐ ca. ‘She is still serving herself to some food.’ Te ne amْim meõ kwђ cђ ne ip᭣ amْim mebѐ ata kwђ re. ‘Go help yourself to some food, get yourself some of these things over there.’ Pa iْõ kѐp icђm ketne. ‘I’m not going to set my cup (e.g. at the table).’ See re, me, gje. v.tr.der. 1. race someone. 2. run after someone. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=t-ѐ A=krikrit. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: In this form, the morpheme ѐ takes a relational prefix. Ex.: Na pђrti brekrϯ ѐ krikrit ْum ubaj prõt. ‘The truck raced after the seriema and it ran out of fear.’ Ictѐ akrikrit ketne. ‘Don’t run after me.’ Na wa atpen tѐ krikrit. ‘The two of them are racing each other.’ Na ka wa atpen tѐ akrikrit ketne. ‘The two of you are not racing one another.’ See krikrit. v.intr. sit. Nonfinite form: S=ْ᭣r. Semantics: The semantic contrast between this verb and kri appears to be that the former indicates movement towards sitting position, whereas the latter indicates being in sitting position. However, only ْ᭣ seems to occur in constructions that require position verbs, indicating, in this case, something already in sitting position. This hypothesis is at odds with the morphological class of each verb and their correlation with descriptive and eventive notions. Another hypothesis is that the contrast may have to do with the number of participants, ْ᭣ being the singular and kri the plural counterpart. A third hypothesis is that both verbs mean ‘be sitting’, but with the semantics of kri focusing on the resultative aspect of sitting down, and ْ᭣ not having such connotation. Grammar: a. This verb is used in VѐV constructions, indicating progressive or continuative aspect. b. The verbs nõ ‘lie’ and ْ᭣ ‘sit’ contrast with their respective counterparts ikw᭣ and kri in that the former seem to have a more flexible use, with respect to the number distinction of the absolutive, than the latter. It

ˆ)r ѐkure ђm

421
is possible to find examples of mϯ nõ and mϯ ْ᭣, even though these verbs refer basically to singular and dual absolutives; but kri and ikw᭣ are often not found with singular absolutives. Ex.: Pipѐ ђ muj ђ ْ᭣. ‘Sit on that bench.’ See ᭣r, kri. v.tr. sit one person or two people on a particular place. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=ْ-᭣r. Nonfinite form: same. Ex.: Ja mu atõ pipѐ ђ ᭣r. ‘Sit your brother on that stool.’ Pipѐ ata ђ ᭣r ketnϯ dѐ pipѐ ata ѐmduju, ra pikukeْ. ‘Don’t sit him on this bench [near you] because it is bad, it is broken.’ Dѩ, pa ictϯ ђ aْ᭣r kete. ‘No, it wasn’t me who sat you on it.’ K᭣j pu mϯ mõ kђْmђ ᭣r. ‘Let’s go and lift her/the two of them (such that she/they stay seated).’ See ْ᭣, kri. v.dscr. 1. intolerant; feisty; quarrelsome. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=c=ѐkure. Nonfinite form: same. Ex.: Neْ na tϯ ѐkure ѐ kri. ‘That one is feisty.’ Pa na icѐkure. ‘I’m feisty.’ 2. v.tr.noncan. resent someone; be upset with someone. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: EO=kamђ S=c-ѐkure. Nonfinite form: same. Ex.: Na pa akamђ icѐkure. ‘I’m upset with you.’ See ѐ kure; kure. v.tr. 1. place one or a pair of objects right-side up on a surface (e.g. table, counter or ground). 2. place (a pot or pan of food) on the fire so as to cook. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=c-ђm. Nonfinite form: same. Semantics: This verb (as well as its counterpart ujwђ) is used with reference to objects shaped in such a way that allow the speaker to conceive of them as “standing up”, such as plates or cups. Its use would be more problematic with objects such as forks and knives, for instance, since these kinds of objects are typically laid in horizontal position. Ex.: Kѐt paj amْi mђ kuw᭣ kamђ meõ cђm, ْum ѐrѐt, ْum kao pa kukre. ‘I’m putting my food on the fire, then it will come to a boil and become ready for me to eat.’ Paj kçtm´) te) ne ri bra ne akupˆm te) ç: m´) amni)m goj k´m ´m ‘I’m going to go for a stroll, then I’ll come back and fix myself [some food] (lit.: “put something in the pan for myself”).’ Ja na kђm ђm kaga. ‘That one refuses to set it up.’ K᭣j pu kђْmђ ђm. ‘Let’s lift it (such that it stands rightside up).’ See ujwђ, i.
