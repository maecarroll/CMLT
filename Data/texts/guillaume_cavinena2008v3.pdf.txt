Preface
This book is a comprehensive grammatical description of the endangered Cavineña language (less than 1,200 speakers), spoken in the Amazonian rainforest of Lowland Bolivia, an area where the indigenous languages are virtually unknown. Cavineña belongs to the Tacanan family, comprising five languages, none of which has been the subject of an adequate descriptive grammar.
The book is a thoroughly revised version of my doctoral dissertation (Guillaume 2004). It is based mostly on the extensive fieldwork that I conducted in traditional Cavineña communities between 1996 and 2003. Cast in the functional-typological framework, and based on natural discourse data, the grammar presents a detailed and copiously exemplified account of most aspects of the language, building up from basic levels (phonetic and phonological) to higher levels (morphological and syntactic), and from brief descriptions of each level to a more comprehensive description of the same level in specific chapters.
The language contains a number of unusual features that will be of interest to typologist linguists, such as an unusual pitch accent system, a morphophonological rule that deletes case markers, an intricate predicate structure, a system of verbal suffixes expressing associated motion, a specific causative of involvement marker, a peculiar prefix e- that is attached to nouns that refer to body parts and a complex system of second position clitic pronouns.
The grammar will also be of interest to historical-comparative linguists, as for the first time one has sufficiently detailed grammatical information to make possible a reliable comparison with other languages with which Tacanan languages might be related, in particular the Panoan family, and to serve as input into hypotheses regarding the population history of this part of South America.

Acknowledgments
This book could not have been written without the support of many people and several institutions. My first and foremost debt goes to the Cavineña people, for their friendship, their hospitality and their serious commitment to helping me in every possible way in carrying out my work of documenting their language. Alfredo Tavo (from Puerto Cavinas), Emeranciano Sepa (from Misión Cavinas), Francisco Vaca (from Riberalta), Antonio Yubanera, Elio Tavo and Eli Mayo (from Galilea) were my main language consultants. They are to be thanked for the long and tedious hours spent day after day assisting me in the task of transcribing texts, explaining meanings and searching for additional examples. At the beginning of the project, Bonifacio Navi (from Baqueti), Juan Tavo (from San Miguel) and Gregorio Yubanera (from Buendestino) have contributed in recording word lists for the analysis of the Cavineña phonological system and a proposal for a revised alphabet. At more advances stages, others have contributed by recording texts (see full list in §1.8). Others would simply talk to me in Cavineña whenever we met, which I consider a great favour. The villagers of Galilea and Misión Cavinas, where I did my fieldwork, have always taken great care of my living conditions in their communities. They gave me a house to live and appointed various families to provide me with daily meals.
I started this project in 1996, thanks to Colette Grinevald, who welcomed me into her team of linguists revising the alphabets of the Bolivian lowland languages. She was the mentor I needed during my early years of linguistics and has been extremely helpful and supportive ever since.
I owe a great dept to a number of people and institutions for their financial help at various stages of the project: the Région Rhône-Alpes (France), the Graduate School of the University of Oregon (USA), Pieter Muysken and his Spinoza project at the University of Leiden (Netherlands), Bob Dixon and Sasha Aikhenvald from the Research Centre for Linguistic Typology (RCLT) at La Trobe University (Australia), and François Pellegrino from the Laboratoire Dynamique Du Langage of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) and the University of Lyon 2 (France).
My research in Bolivia could not have been possible without the logistic help form the following people and institutions: José Abiyuna from the Consejo Educativo Amazónico Pluriétnico (CEAM) in Santa Cruz, Carmén Lopez from the Programa de Formación en Educación Intercultural Bilingüe para los Países Andínos (PROEIB Andes) in Cochabamba, Eustaquio Ayala and Aureliano Tavo from the Central Indígena de la Región Amazónica de Bolivia (CIRABO) in Riberalta, and André Pardes from the Misión Evangélica Suiza in Riberalta.

x Acknowledgements
The present study has progressively developed at three distinct academic institutions, the Laboratoire Dynamique Du Langage of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) and the University of Lyon 2 in France, the Department of Linguistics of the University of Oregon in the USA, and the Research Centre for Linguistic Typology (RCLT) of the University of La Trobe in Australia. I owe a great dept to the scholars with whom I worked or met at these institutions, starting with Sasha Aikhenvald, whose commitment and genuine interest in helping me write this grammar was way beyond her duties as a Ph.D. supervisor. She has read and commented on every single chapter of this work, often more than once. Bob Dixon has been a major source of inspiration throughout this work. I am also thankful to all those who read through the whole draft of this grammar, or parts of it, and provided me with comments and ideas: Willem Adelaar, Andy Butcher, Hilary Chappell, Timothy Curnow, Christian DiCanio, Carola Emkow, Carol Genetti, Colette Grinevald, Andrew Ingram, Nicole Kruspe, and Hein Van der Voort. The dissertation was submitted in February 2004 (and passed in October 2004). The three examiners, Willem Adelaar, Nilson Gabas Junior, and John Hajek, provided numerous comments which have greatly enhanced the quality of this study. Alec Coupe deserves special thanks for his help in the task of writing in English. Adam Bowles, publication assistant at RCLT, has also been excellent in proofreading many of the chapters. My gratitude also goes to Siew Peng Condon, executive officer at RCLT, whose help went beyond her administrative duties, notably caring for our little boy Christophe during the last hectic weeks of writing the dissertation.
The revisions that I was able to make in order to turn my dissertation into the present book benefited from suggestions by Bernard Comrie (acting a reviewer for Mouton de Gruyter), Denis Creissels and Scott DeLancey, who have each read the whole manuscript. The revised grammar was then proofread by Christian DiCanio, Loretta O’Connor and Marc Peake. I’m also grateful to Natalia Cáceres, Caroline Imbert, Egidio Marsico, the Mouton de Gruyter editor Ursula Kleinhenz, and technical editor Monika Wendland, for helping me format the final manuscript.
Last but not least, my warmest thanks go to my wife, Kei, who went through the whole adventure with me, with all possible love and support.

Chapter 1 The language and its speakers
Cavineña is spoken by approximately 1,200 people who live in scattered communities in the Amazonian rainforests of northern Bolivia (South America). Cavineña belongs to the small Tacanan language family, together with Araona, Ese Ejja (or Ese Eja), Reyesano (or Maropa) and Tacana; see Map 1 for the location of Cavineña and its sister Tacanan languages. The language is named after the Franciscan mission Misión (Jesús de) Cavinas,1 where the Cavineñas were confined at the end of the 18th century, and where some Cavineñas still live today; see the location of Misión Cavinas in Map 2. The term “Cavineña” is also the auto-denomination of the ethnic group. Ethnic Cavineñas include Cavineña speakers as well as non-Cavineña speakers. In Spanish, which is the lingua franca of Bolivia, “Cavineña” alternates with “Cavineño”, according to rules of gender agreement (e.g., una Cavineña ‘a Cavineña woman’ vs. un Cavineño ‘a Cavineña man’). In this study I consistently use the term “Cavineña”, following the practice used in previous English research on the language.
1.1. Geography and demography
There are between 1,700 and 2,104 ethnic Cavineñas. The first figure comes from the socio-linguistic studies conducted by PROEIB Andes) (2000), the second from García Pérez (1998: 96). These figures correspond to people who identify themselves as Cavineña, but these are not necessarily speakers of the Cavineña language; it is my impression that probably not more than 1,200 of these people are fluent speakers of Cavineña.
Most Cavineñas still live in traditional communities. The main Cavineña communities are listed in Table 1.1. These are the most stable communities — new communities are regularly created while others frequently disappear — and those which I am most familiar with; see Map 2 for their location. The table also shows the size of the Cavineña population and the total population (i.e., including non-Cavineña people) for each community.
1 The origin of the term "Cavinas" is unknown. Interestingly, this term is very similar to “Caviña”, the name of one of the two moieties in the neighboring sister language Araona. The relation between the names remains to be investigated.

All the Cavineña communities, except Galilea and Mapajo/Santa Ana,3 live east of the Beni river which corresponds to the administrative department of Beni. Galilea and Mapajo/Santa Ana are located on the western side of the Beni river, in the Pando administrative department.
Some Cavineña families also live in non-Cavineña communities, i.e., communities which are not traditionally Cavineña and where Cavineñas are often not a majority. This happens in Puerto Cavinas, with 120 Cavineñas from a total population of 224, and neighboring Candelaria, with 97 Cavineñas from a total population of 268, two communities located on the Beni river. This is also the case in Australia, a community located on the dirt highway, with 44 Cavineñas from a total population of 231. See the location of these communities in Map 2. The total number of Cavineñas living in such communities is 331, according to García Pérez.
Some Cavineñas have emigrated to the regional towns of Riberalta and Guayaramerín. The towns have a Cavineña population of 110 and 38, respectively, out of a total population of over 60,000 for Riberalta and over 30,000 for Guayaramerín.4
The community of Mapajo/Santa Ana is located somewhere on the Bolivian side of the Abuna river (north of the Pando department, along the Brazilian

for 2001; Galilea, where I did 5 months of fieldwork in 2001, has probably at least 20
to 30 non-Cavineña people, consisting of families of teachers who, for the most part,
come from Riberalta. 3 The name Mapajo is given by García Pérez (1998) but I have also heard the name
Santa Ana used by several Cavineña native speakers to refer to the same community.

border). Cavineñas from this community (49 people) have no contact with the rest of the Cavineñas; many Cavineñas are not even aware of their existence. They are said to have been ‘sold’ by the missionaries of Misión Cavinas as labor workers in 1940 (see §1.4).

1.2. Sociolinguistic situation

Although Cavineña is still actively spoken, and even learned by some children, it is an endangered language. According to PROEIB Andes) estimates, there are 1,178 speakers (67.9 % of the total population). Their figures are reproduced in Table 1.2.

I basically agree with these figures, although I am suspicious of there still being any true monolingual speakers. All the Cavineñas whom I met, whether male or female, had at least a rudimentary knowledge of Spanish. Based upon my firsthand experience with two Cavineña communities (Galilea and Misión Cavinas) and the town of Riberalta, the preceding table deserves some comment. The degree of maintenance of the Cavineña language varies from community to community. There appears to be a correlation between language loss and proximity to the town of Riberalta. In Misión Cavinas and the nearby community of San Miguel, Cavineña is the main means of communication between almost everybody, including young children. These communities are some of the most remote areas where Cavineñas live. In Galilea, which is the closest community to Riberalta, Cavineña is still the main means of communication among most adults and elders. Cavineña is also still used between adolescents and adults, but not between adolescents themselves. As for most younger children (below the age of approximately 12) Cavineña is neither used nor understood. In Riberalta, Cavineña is no longer used.

1.3. Physical environment, subsistence and culture
In this section, I provide a brief overview of Cavineñas life in traditional communities. More information can be found in Camp and Liccardi (1980), García Pérez (1998) and Stahl (2003).
The Cavineña communities are located next to rivers (e.g., Buendestino, Baqueti), small streams (e.g., Misión Cavinas, San Miguel) or lakes (e.g., Galilea) in well chosen upland terrain that does not flood. The northern-most communities are surrounded by vast areas of thick jungle (e.g., Galilea). In the south, however, the jungle is mostly restricted to stretches of various widths along the banks of rivers or lakes. Between rivers and/or lakes are vast patches of pampa (savannah). The climate is tropical with temperatures hovering around 35o Celsius (95o Fahrenheit) during most of the year. The rainy season begins in October/November, and most of the areas around where the Cavineñas live become completely flooded until March/April. The dry season runs from April to October. That season is sometimes punctuated by atmospheric fluctuations brought by cold winds from the south — it is winter time in the southern hemisphere. These winds and fluctuations are called Sur ‘south’ in Spanish and Beni in Cavineña, a word which comes from the southern flowing Beni river. The temperature can suddenly drop from 35o Celsius to a low of (sometimes below) 15o Celsius (59o Fahrenheit). The wind and the cold can last as long as 2 weeks and can be extremely uncomfortable for the people, being used to hot weather, and lacking home insulation or warm clothing.
The Cavineñas’ main means of subsistence in the traditional communities are hunting, fishing, fruit collection and slash-and-burn cultivation of banana, manioc, rice and corn. They also raise chicken, ducks, and rarely cattle. Some Cavineña communities are involved in trading, usually exchanging brazil nuts for goods, such as oil, sugar, salt, soap, bullets, etc., brought from Riberalta by merchants on the river. Some Cavineña men are hired by logging companies.
Cavineñas have an extremely fine sense of humor. They seem to joke about everything, all day long, with extremely sonorous laughter — this is especially true of Galilea. They enjoy having fiestas where they drink incredible amounts of chicha, a fermented drink made of corn or manioc that they prepare themselves.
Cavineñas particularly enjoy giving nicknames. Every person in a Cavineña community has an official name and an official surname. The surname is composed of the father’s surname followed by the mother’s surname, according to Bolivian practices. In most cases, Cavineña surnames include one of the following ten: Achipa, Ayala, Camaconi, Cartagena, Mayo, Rutani, Sepa, Siripi, Tavo or Yubanera. However, these names/surnames are hardly ever used in daily life, being used for administrative purposes or with foreigners. Nicknames are used instead of names. The Cavineñas coin many sorts of nicknames. Nicknames are

1.4. History 5
given according to something special that characterizes a person or that has happened to a person. When I arrived for the first time in Galilea, after a long trip on the river, my face and my neck were completely red from the sun. I was given the nickname dudu mapa (‘beam shoulder’) because my redness made me look like someone struggling to carry a heavy beam on my shoulders. Nicknames are often given (or changed) when someone loses their temper, a terribly bad quality in Cavineña society. Antonio Yubanera recorded a story about how a man once got upset with his wife who had not cooked a fish the way he wanted — this is the text “Apodos” (see Table 1.5 in the appendix). His anger was reported to others who searched for a nickname to “punish” him. They called him uwi ‘mole’ because the fish that caused the anger, a threespot leporinus (Leporinus friderici), has big stains on its skin. I was also told that Rosalino Mayo (from Galilea) was once given the nickname bina kani ‘bat hole’ because he once lost his temper in a situation involving a fish whose mouth resembles the holes bats make in trees. Note that the exact reason of Rosalino’s loss of temper was not given to me.
Cavineñas have special nickname-givers, i.e., persons with acknowledged skills in nickname-giving whom one consults with when someone needs to be “punished” for having lost their temper. The Cavineña language has special suffixes used to coin affective nicknames. They consist of one of two endings, chu or ku, which are added to part of an official name. I was often called Antuku from my (Bolivian) official name Antonio. Someone named Feliz is often called Felichu (see §12.7.8 for a full discussion).
Most Cavineñas are religious, although none of their ancestral beliefs appear to have survived. The traditional and remote communities of the south practice Catholicism, which was introduced to them by Spanish Franciscan missionaries at the end of the 18th century. The more modern communities of the north practice Protestantism, which was introduced by SIL missionaries in the late 1960’s and is still promoted by Swiss and German Missionaries based in Riberalta.
1.4. History
Very little is known of the Cavineña history, especially of the pre-contact period, i.e., before 1764, which appears to be the date of the foundation of the first Cavineña mission.5 Before the first contacts with Spanish missionaries, the Cavineñas appear to have lived between the rivers Madidi and Beni (see Map 2). Traditional stories relating to this period mention the constant state of war be-

6 1. The language and its speakers
tween the Cavineñas and enemies, generally identified as the ancestors of the present-day Ese Ejjas (from the same Tacanan linguistic family).
The first contact with the Western World was probably made in the middle of the 18th century by Spanish Franciscan Catholic missionaries, who had already established a number of missions at the foot of the Andes, such as Ixiamas, Tumupasa, San José de Uchupiamonas and Apolo. These missions were located in the actual Tacana territory (see Map 1) and had the purpose of expending their influence into the northern plains. The first Cavineña mission was established in 1764 on the banks of a stream called Undumó, a tributary of the Madidi river with the name Misión Esmeraldas, under the direction of the Franciscan Father José de Sosa.
Misión (Jesús de) Cavinas was created between 1881 and 1894 when the priests and the Cavineñas fled attacks from the Ese Ejjas. Misión Cavinas remained in the hands of the Franciscan Fathers until 1941. In 1940, a number of Cavineña families were ‘sold’ by the priests to a rubber company which took them away form the mission. These people never returned; they correspond to the present-day community of Mapajo/Santa Ana located near the Brazilian frontier on the Abuna river.
In 1941, American Catholics from the order of Maryknoll replaced the Franciscan fathers. In 1958, a number of Cavineña men rebelled against the Fathers and their authoritarian practices. These Cavineñas were expelled from Misión Cavinas. They moved with their families to nearby rubber centers. Maryknoll priests ran Misión Cavinas until 1973. When they left, the priests sold the land and the cattle of Misión Cavinas to the local Bolivian Navy, leaving the Cavineñas with nothing but bad memories, an intruding military barracks, and a herd of cattle constantly damaging their houses and fields.
In the 1960’s, the American missionaries of the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) established their headquarters in Tumichucua (about 25km south of Riberalta; see Map 2). They started working with the Cavineñas in the early 1970’s, having first worked with other indigenous groups. They provided education, medical assistance, and training in various fields such as health, mechanics and carpentry. Two SIL missionaries, Elisabeth Camp and Millicent Liccardi, lived for long periods in the Cavineña community of Las Mercedes (see Map 2). They learned and studied the Cavineña language. They collected texts, compiled a dictionary, wrote a grammatical sketch, designed school books and translated the New Testament into Cavineña. They left in September 1985.
Swiss and German missionaries from the Misión Suiza (Swiss Evangelical Mission) settled in Riberalta soon after the departure of the SIL. Since then, they have provided some assistance (notably medical; not educational) to the Cavineñas and other indigenous groups, complementing what is nowadays provided by the Bolivian government.

1.5. Genetic affiliation 7
The departure of the SIL also corresponded with the beginning of the political organization of the Cavineñas together with neighboring indigenous groups, such as the the Chácobos. In 1986, they created the Central Indígena de la Región Amazónica de BOlivia (CIRABO)) (indigenous organization of the Amazonian region of Bolivia). Based in Riberalta, this organization is nowadays very active in fighting for the rights of the Cavineñas and other Bolivian indigenous groups of northern Bolivia, despite limited funding. The Cavineñas’ main battle nowadays is the right for Tierra Comunitaria de Origen (TCO) (community land of origin) which would make them the owners of their traditional land.
1.5. Genetic affiliation
An overview of the classification of languages within the Tacanan family is provided in Girard (1971: 11 ff.) and is not repeated here. Following the phonological and morphological reconstructions of Key (1963a, 1968, 1992 et al.) and Girard (1971), most linguists now accept that the Tacanan family consists of at least the following five languages (all still spoken to some degree): Araona, Cavineña, Ese Ejja, Reyesano and Tacana. Based on certain phonological and morphological similarities, Girard further sub-classifies these five Tacanan languages into three subgroups, as follows:
1 — Tacana, Reyesano and Araona; 2 — Cavineña; 3 — Ese Ejja.
Girard’s (1971) and Key’s (1968) studies also attempt to link Tacanan languages with the Panoan languages under a single Proto-Pano-Tacanan language (following an initial suggestion by Schuller 1933). However, establishing the genetic affiliation between the two families requires more work and a better knowledge of the various Tacanan languages. As Girard (1971: 145) acknowledges, “the problem … demands much more careful investigation … and much more material is required which at present is not available” and “when one attempts to correlate the two families … one is left with a meager corpus of allegedly cognate material — so meager indeed that the evidence for a PanoTakanan (sic.) relationship seems only probable”.
There have also been suggestions of higher level groupings. Suarez (1969, 1973) proposed a link between Tacanan, Panoan, and the Bolivian isolate language Chimane-Mosetén. Greenberg (1987) put forward the hypothesis of a link between Tacanan, Panoan, Chimane-Mosetén, Jê, and Carib languages. However, until more is known about the Tacanan languages and Proto-Tacanan,

8 1. The language and its speakers
these links are highly speculative and remain an open question for further research.
Cavineña is a uniform language with (as far as I know) no dialectal variation.6 I could only identify a few minor differences between the speech of the modern communities of the north and the more traditional communities of the south. This lack of major differences was further confirmed in my conversations with Cavineña speakers. The only domain of variation appears to be lexical. For example, the people from Galilea usually say jetiama ‘many, a lot of’ while the people from Misión Cavinas prefer umada ‘many, a lot of’. Both words are synonymous and are perfectly understood by all the Cavineña speakers from both communities.
1.6. Previous work on the language
The first general study of Cavineña is the work of Camp and Liccardi (1989), which consists of a Cavineña/Spanish (and Spanish/Cavineña) dictionary followed by a grammatical sketch. The dictionary consists of more than 3,000 lexical entries. Each entry is provided with a word class specification (as defined in the following sketch), one or more glosses, and one or two full sentences providing a context for the word, accompanied by a translation in Spanish. The dictionary ends with a number of appendices listing identified affixes of the language, names of trees, birds, fish, expressions referring to the time of the day, snakes, monkeys, and kinship terms. The grammatical sketch consists of 95 pages. It identifies and exemplifies (with morpheme breaks and interlinear glosses) the main structures of the language, from morphology to complex clauses. This is done in a methodic and transparent way. The only criticism that I would make of this work is the absence of discussion and justifications for the proposed classification of the forms. Nevertheless, this work was of invaluable help to me when I started my work on Cavineña. I could rapidly identify basic vocabulary and morpho-syntactic structures. Later on, the dictionary provided me with a fair number of forms and structures that did not occur (or rarely occurred) in my own corpus.
In addition to the dictionary and the grammatical sketch, there are a number of short articles on particular aspects of the language. Brief discussions of the phonetics and phonology of Cavineña can be found in Key (1963a, 1968), Girard (1971) and Liccardi (1983). The pronominal system, which is one of the most complex areas of the language, is studied in Camp and Liccardi (1977,
6 But note that I have no information on the Cavineñas who live in the Mapajo/Santa Ana community who have been living apart from the remaining Cavineñas since 1940 (see §1.4).

19837) and in Camp (1985). A number of verbal suffixes encoding notions of motion are discussed in Camp (1982). Camp (1983) discusses several structures equivalent to complementation in other languages.
Camp and Liccardi collected a fair number of texts. Unfortunately, only a portion have been made available (many in unreadable microfiche formats; see below). Four texts are available in the appendices to Camp (1982) (one text), and Liccardi (1983) (three texts), with morpheme breaks, glosses and translations. Also available and translated into Spanish, although not analyzed morphologically, are Camp and Liccardi (1972) (14 texts), Camp and Liccardi (1973) (10 texts), Tavo Mayo (1977) (20 texts), and Tabo Mayo (1978) (17 texts).8
The two SIL missionaries also produced several school books, such as Camp and Liccardi (1971, 1978), and translations of religious texts, like the New Testament. There are others but I have not had access to them.
When SIL missionaries left Bolivia in 1985, they transferred most of their fieldnotes and collected texts, whether handwritten or typewritten, onto microfiches. This represents a substantial amount of data which is not published or accessible in any other format. Unfortunately, a great majority of this material is undecipherable because that microfilming was done in very poor conditions (Donald Pitman, p.c.). The full list is given in Table 1.3 with the reference number, the title, the name of the linguist, and the number of pages. Note that I do not have the number of microfiches per reference number.9
The material produced by Camp and/or Liccardi uses an alphabet which is slightly different from the one used in this study; see discussion in §1.10 and §2.10.
With the exception of Camp (1985), the majority of the material cited above either is published locally and does not have wide distribution or is not published at all. However, most references (including the microfiches) are available at the Biblioteca Etnológica (library of ethnology) of the Universidad Católica Boliviana (Bolivian Catholic University) in the Bolivian city of Cochabamba and at the library of the Summer Institute of Linguistics in Dallas in the USA.
7 Camp and Liccardi (1983) is essentially a translation in English of Camp and Liccardi (1977).
8 Tabo Mayo and Tavo Mayo both correspond to the same person whose surname is spelled differently in each reference.
9 The list is reproduced exactly as it was given to me by SIL. I have not corrected (what I think are) typos: e.g., Cavineña (not Cavinena), Sunchar (not Junchar), Isaraisara (not Esaraisara).

1.7. Fieldwork 11
Data on Cavineña (most often wordlists) has also been collected by missionaries and travelers ever since Cavineñas had first contact with Westerners. This is, for example, the case with Armentia and Lafone Quevedo (1906), which includes a number of paradigms (pronouns, numerals, verbs with various affixes), translations in Cavineña of various prayers, and a list of about 3,600 forms. I have not investigated this material. Its content is discussed in an annotated bibliography by Girard (1971: 177ff.).
Alfredo Tavo , who was one of my main language consultant (see next section), has been working for years on writing a history of his people, in both Cavineña and Spanish. Unfortunately, the Cavineña part of Alfredo’s manuscript has neither been published nor given away, although Alfredo has generously shared some of his findings in the recording of texts in Cavineña where he relates the past history of the Cavineñas.11
1.7. Fieldwork
Fieldwork in Amazonian Bolivia, especially when it is done in traditional communities, can be quite challenging. The fieldworker has to face a difficult physical environment because of high heat and humidity, mosquitoes and biting flies, and all sorts of diseases. The living and working conditions in the communities are harsh, with no electricity, no running water, and often hardly any furniture. One has to boil or filter water and sleep on a mat on the floor. Chairs and tables are always hard to find. One hardly eats anything other than rice, manioc and bananas, occasionally complemented by fish, chicken or scarce jungle meat. Access to the communities is difficult and hazardous, often requiring several days on rivers and/or non-asphalted roads. The difficulties of fieldwork in Amazonian Bolivia (and many other parts of Amazonia) most likely explains why so little linguistic work has been done in that part of the world and so little is known about these languages.
The present grammar is based on a total of about 15 months of fieldwork. I first started working on Cavineña in 1996 in Tumichucua, a small village near the regional town of Riberalta. Tumichucua was the headquarter of the SIL missionaries until 1985 (see Map 2). Together with other linguistics graduate students, I assisted Prof. Colette Grinevald in a 2 month-long (July and August) government-sponsored project aiming at standardizing practical alphabets for the Bolivian lowland languages. I was given the task of the revision of the Cavineña alphabet together with a team of Cavineña speakers from various communities (see Photo 2). I met Alfredo Tavo (a 56 year old Cavineña man at the

12 1. The language and its speakers
time), who has been one of my best teachers of Cavineña ever since (see Photo 1). I collected wordlists and started working on the phonology of the language.
I returned to Riberalta for two months in 1997 (July and August). I met Alfredo again, who lives between Puerto Cavinas and Riberalta). He introduced me to Francisco Vaca, a 40 year old man at the time (see Photo 3). Francisco grew up in Misión Cavinas but settled in Riberalta in the late 1980’s. Francisco, similar to Alfredo, had been trained by SIL missionaries to do linguistic work. He turned out to be an excellent teacher of Cavineña too. Alfredo also took me on a trip to visit the Cavineña communities (see Photos 4 and 5). The trip ended quickly. After visiting three communities (Baqueti, San Miguel and Misión Cavinas) I caught severe amoebic dysentery and had to be evacuated immediately by light plane to Riberalta for adequate treatment. I decided to stay in town working with Alfredo and Francisco, asking them to tell me stories, which I would record and transcribe with their help.
I went back to Riberalta for two months in 1998 (July and August) and for one month in 2000 (April). I stayed in the town again, collecting texts and eliciting data from Francisco and Alfredo. This work took place in my little hotel and in their houses. I managed to record a few texts from Francisco’s wife, Griselda Cartagena (see Photo 3), and Samuel Mayo, an elderly Cavineña who lives in Riberalta.
In 2001, I became more courageous and returned to the ‘real’ Cavineña world. I lived for five months (March to July) in the community of Galilea (see Map 2). To my surprise, nothing bad happened to me this time. I participated in the daily life of the community. I went fishing and hunting, played soccer, went to every single village meeting, church services and fiestas, drank quite a lot of chicha (traditional beer), learned to speak Cavineña, and started writing down what I was hearing around me. I collected many stories from all sorts of people and recorded conversations. I was assisted in the transcriptions and translations by the pastor of the community, Antonio Yubanera (who was about 45 years old).
In 2003, I stayed a whole month (May) in the remote Misión Cavinas. The trip to Misión Cavinas from Reyes (see Map 1) took 4 days. The first day was spent in a bus on the dirt highway, en route to the village of Australia (see Map 2). The second day was spent on a motorcycle en route to Baqueti (see dotted lines on map 2). The third day was spent in Baqueti, waiting for someone from Misión Cavinas to fetch me. There was so much water on the paths that it was impossible for my motorcycle-taxi driver to take me any further). At 5 pm, two Cavineña women from Misión Cavinas (Victoria Tavo and her daughter) arrived with an ox-cart. The following day, we left at 1 am and it took 15 hours, at an average speed of 2.5km/h, to reach Misión Cavinas. A few days later, I asked Victoria to relate the trip. She gave me an extraordinary 45 minute-long retell-

ing of the whole voyage. Many examples in this study have been taken from this text. Being in Misión Cavinas gave me the opportunity to work with Alfredo Tavo again, who lives in nearby Puerto Cavinas when he is not in Riberalta. He and I were given a house in the village. The time was spent recording new texts and revising a draft of this grammar. Unfortunately, Alfredo had to leave after 2 weeks. Emerenciano Sepa, a young man of about 35 years old, was asked to take over Alfredo’s task in helping me revise the grammar and transcribe texts, which he did perfectly.
1.8. Corpus
The corpus for this study consists of the following types of data:
1 — 59 recorded, transcribed and translated texts (about 3,800 sentences). Two of these texts are provided with morpheme breaks, glosses and free translations in the appendix to the grammar; 2 — 4 recorded, transcribed and translated conversations (about 800 sentences); 3 — 20 texts written by my language consultants: 11 texts by Alfredo and 9 texts by Francisco (about 680 sentences); 4 — 65 published texts: 20 texts in Tavo Mayo (1977), 17 texts in Tabo Mayo (1978), one text in Camp (1982), 3 texts in Liccardi (1983), 14 texts in Camp and Liccardi (1972) and 10 texts in Camp and Liccardi (1973) (about 3,500 sentences); 5 — fieldnote examples (obtained either in controlled settings — elicited or volunteered — or through participant observation): about 3,650 sentences (613 sentences in 1997, 952 sentences in 1998, 530 sentences in 2000, 560 sentences in 2001 and 1,000 sentences in 2003); 6 — sentences from the Camp and Liccardi’s (1989) dictionary (about 3,000 sentences).
The corpus does not include the data from the following sources:
1 — SIL translations of religious texts; 2 — SIL school books; 3 — SIL microfiches; 4 — old sources (i.e., prior to the work of the SIL).
Cavineña authors are listed in Table 1.4. The symbol ‘†’ means that the person has passed away. A question mark ‘?’ means that I do not have this information; that is, the person is someone who worked with the SIL and whom I have never met.

The program ‘Shoebox’ has been the main tool for analyzing the corpus, building the lexicon and organizing the data for grammatical analysis. Every single piece of data used in this study was entered into the Shoebox database. Texts were cut into sentences. Each sentence was given a code. The examples provided in this study contain this code; see the list in the appendix to this Chapter.
The recordings were made on analogue tapes. For the purpose of this study, 31 of the recorded texts were digitized (using the program ‘SoundEdit’ on a Macintosh platform). These include the recordings that correspond to the two texts that are given in the appendix to this grammar. These two recordings, together with their transcription, their translation, and the codes, have been deposited at the Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America (AILLA) at

the University of Texas at Austin, where they can be accessed online. In the near future, it is my goal to archive the whole collected corpus so that the reader should be able to check every illustrative example provided in this grammar.
1.9. Linguistic type
Cavineña has a fairly simple phonological system. There are 20 consonants and 4 vowels. The phonetic realization of each segment varies very little. Syllable structure is (C)V. The accentual system, which is used to define the boundaries of phonological words, is unusual because it involves complex combinations of high and mid pitches.
Cavineña has agglutinative morphology with a fairly high degree of synthesis, especially in verbs. The language has an important number of clitics (in particular enclitics). It is essentially a dependent-marking language (following Nichols 1986).
Cavineña has three open lexical classes, consisting of verbs, nouns and predicative adjectives, eleven closed grammatical classes, consisting of verb modifiers, attributive adjectives, number markers, quantifiers, postpositions, pronouns, demonstratives, question words, particles, subordinate clause markers and coordinators, and two semi-open classes, consisting of interjections and onomatopoeia.
The predicate can be extremely complex. Minimally, it consists of a verb (the head) and an inflectional affix (a TAM or imperative-like marker). But maximally, it can consist of as many as 11 structural slots, which may be filled by more than 50 affixes and (phonologically independent) modifiers. In addition, verbs are subdivided into inflecting verbs, where an inflectional affix is attached directly to the verb stem, and non-inflecting verbs, where an inflectional affix is attached to an auxiliary. Cavineña is highly sensitive to transitivity. Most verbs are strictly either intransitive or transitive. Intransitive noninflecting verbs require an intransitive auxiliary while transitive non-inflecting verbs require a transitive auxiliary. Many verbal affixes have an intransitive form and a transitive form. The predicate in Cavineña does not make any reference to the participants.
Nouns are subdivided into three classes: e-nouns, which require a dummy prefix e-, denoting parts of entities; kinship nouns, which require possessor inflections, being inalienably possessed; and independent nouns, which are used as bare roots, referring to fauna, flora, artifacts, etc.
Predicative adjectives and attributive adjectives are two distinct word classes. Predicative adjectives are used as copula complements while attributive adjectives are used as NP modifiers.

16 1. The language and its speakers
Cavineña has two types of pronouns: independent pronouns and bound pronouns. Independent pronouns fill NP or PP slots and can occur in any type of clause. Bound pronouns are enclitics in second position in main clauses only, being attached to the last phonological word of the first immediate constituent of a main clause. Independent pronouns and bound pronouns can co-occur in a single main clause.
Cavineña has many particles. These are bare roots which cannot take affixes. We recognize four categories of particles which differ in their degree of phonological and grammatical independence. Two categories are phonologically and grammatically independent: (1) independent particles, which are free to occur anywhere in a clause, and (2) first position particles, which must occur in clause-initial position. Two categories of particles are enclitics: (1) second position particles, which cluster in second position in a clause, together with bound pronouns, and (2) phrasal particles, which are attached (and modify) a phrase (NP, PP, predicate, predicative adjective, subordinate clause, etc.).
Cavineña has free constituent order. Grammatical functions are encoded by a system of postpositions (on NPs) or suffixes on pronouns. The encoding of core grammatical functions abides by a strict ergative/absolutive pattern. Contrary to what was previously thought, there is no system of split ergativity in Cavineña. The postposition =ra (or suffix -ra) marks transitive subjects (A function). The absence of a postposition (or a suffix) marks intransitive subjects (S function) or transitive objects (O function). Oblique functions are also marked by postpositions (or suffixes on pronouns). The main oblique postpositions are associative, dative, genitive, locative, general locative, perlative and ‘up to’. Most postpositions are enclitics, being attached to the last phonological word of an NP. A few are separate phonological words and follow the NP.
Cavineña has three types of subordinate clauses which are marked by subordinate clause markers: (1) non-finite adverbial clauses, which require a noninflected verb, (2) finite adverbial clauses, which require an inflected verb, and (3) relative clauses, which also require an inflected verb. Cavineña has neither complement clause nor any coordinate clause type. Some subordinate clauses have co-reference restrictions vis-à-vis their controlling clause. In all the cases, these restrictions always operate in terms of a nominative/accusative pivot, showing that Cavineña is only ergative at the morphological level.
1.10. Writing systems
Cavineña was first written when SIL missionaries began studying in Bolivia, starting with Key (1963b). Key’s system is based on the Spanish orthography. For example the phoneme /k/ is written qu before front vowels i and e and c before non-front vowels a and u.

1.11. Illustrative examples 17
Key’s (1963b) alphabet was slightly modified in the subsequent work by Camp and/or Liccardi. They notably left out a grapheme for a glottal stop and a liquid l — these are not independent phonemes in the language.
In 1996, in the context of the reform for multicultural-bilingual education (Ley de Reforma Educativa, July 1994),12 I proposed a revised alphabet (Guillaume 1996), based on a more straightforward association between phonemes and graphemes. Notably, I proposed that the two graphemes qu and c, both representing /k/, be replaced by the grapheme k. The new orthographies were designed to make language reading and writing easier for children and to give the Cavineñas the feeling of having their own alphabet (as opposed to a copy of the Spanish alphabet).
The graphemes used in this study are basically these from Guillaume (1996). See a full discussion of Cavineña writing systems in §2.10.

Chapter 2 Phonology
This chapter is an overview of Cavineña phonology. It begins with inventories of consonant phonemes (§2.1) and vowel phonemes (§2.2), including a discussion of the phonetic realization of each phoneme. The next two sections discuss syllable structure (§2.3) and phonotactic restrictions (§2.4). A number of analytic choices regarding the phonological system of Cavineña are discussed in §2.5. Morphologically-conditioned phonological processes are presented in §2.6. The accentual system is discussed in (§2.7). Intonational patterns are presented in §2.8. The phonology of loanwords in Cavineña is the topic of §2.9. Finally, in §2.10, I discuss the Cavineña writing systems.
2.1. Consonants
2.1.1. Inventory
Cavineña has 20 consonant phonemes. They are given in Table 2.1 in the practical orthography used in this study (see §2.10). The phonetic realization of each phoneme is given in square brackets using the International Phonetic Alphabet.1
Two observations can be made on this table. First, I should point to the fact that in the practical orthography, the letter j refers to the glottal fricative [h] whereas the letter y refers to the alveo-palatal glide [j]. Second, a number of segments could lend themselves to a different analysis where they would be made up of two independent segments: ty [c], dy [], ry [], ny [], ts, ch [
] and kw. Argumentation against this sequential analysis is given in §2.5.
1 Note that the velar column has been placed next to the bilabial one. (Following a more traditional practice, we would have placed the velar column between the alveo-palatal and glottal columns.) This allows to better capture the nature of the labialised stop kw and glide w which involve both bilabial and velar places of articulation.

2.1.2. Phonetic realization

With the exception of w, Cavineña consonant phonemes do not fluctuate in their phonetic realization (at least not enough to be noteworthy). They maintain their place, manner and voicing specifications regardless of the environment. For example, segments which do not have a voiced counterpart, such as k, kw, ts, ch [
], s, sh [] and j [h], are never voiced. Conversely, segments which do not have a voiceless counterpart, such as r [], ry [], m, n, ny [], w and y [j], are never voiceless.
The segments b and d are always realized voiced stops.

The segments sh [] and ch [

and Maddieson’s (1996: 150ff.) terminology.

The liquid r is probably the most noteworthy sound in Cavineña. Roughly speaking, its pronunciation lies somewhere between a tap [ ] and a lateral [l]. An instrumental study (Guillaume 2002) has revealed that its articulation combines tongue tip retroflexion, a very brief period of complete closure in the oral cavity made by the tongue tip striking the alveolar ridge, and lateral airflow release. According to these characteristics, this sound would be an alveolar lateral flap [] (Ladefoged 1971: 51-52; Laver 1994: 311-312; Ladefoged and Maddieson 1996: 243).

The glide w is the only consonant with allophonic variation. It has a labial-
velar approximant allophone [w] before a and a bilabial approximant allophone
[ß] before front vowels (e and i), the latter allophone occasionally heard as a labio-dental approximant [] or a labial-palatal approximant []. Note that w never precedes u (see §2.4).

2.1.3. Minimal pairs

In the following, I provide minimal (or near minimal) pairs illustrating the major phonological contrasts in Cavineña.
Voicing is only contrastive in bilabial, alveolar and alveo-palatal stops, as in (2.12a-c); it is not contrastive for labialized velar stops.

(2.12) a. pisubisu-

‘untie’ ‘feel ashamed’

b. tata -tada

‘sir, father’ ‘butt’

c. tya-wa dyawa-

‘give-PERF’ ‘kiss’

Palatalization is interesting because it applies to all alveolar phonemes for all manners of articulation: the stops, the affricate, the fricative, the liquid, and the nasal, as in (2.13a-f).

28 2. Phonology

(2.13) a. tata-ki tya-taki

‘with a father’ ‘can/must give’

(father-WITH) (give-ABIL)

b. adaadya-

‘to add’ ‘to contaminate’

c. atsa chacha

d. sipishipi

e. wirawirya-

‘urinate’ ‘be bored with’

f. ina-

inyakwa ‘grass louse’

Labialization is a contrast only found at the velar place of articulation.

2.3. Syllable structure
The canonical Cavineña syllable structure is (C)V. Both V and CV syllables can occur either word initially or word internally. This is illustrated in (2.19), where syllables are separated by a dot symbol.

Sequences of two consonants are found in borrowed words which have only been partially integrated into the Cavineña phonological system (see §2.9). Most often we observe nd, nk, st, sk, and rt sequences, as in (2.20).

(Span. buen(os) día(s)) (Aym. tunka ‘ten’) (Span. buenas tarde(s)) (Span. cristiano ‘Christian’) (Aym. pusiqalq’o) (Span. martes)

Some Spanish loanwords have not (or almost not) been integrated into the phonological system and show other consonant sequences; e.g., gringo ‘foreign man of Caucasian type’ (from Spanish gringo) and profeso ‘teacher’ (from Spanish profesor), with gr and pr syllable onsets. In addition to having irregular syllables, these words also include (Spanish) sounds which are foreign to Cavineña, such as g, f, etc.
Consonant sequences within native Cavineña words — other than those found in complex consonant sequences — could be more challenging for the (C)V syllable template. However, this only occurs within a total of five words. In addition, in all these words but one, the sequence of consonants has clearly arisen from an idiosyncratic process of vowel elision.

In this study, I will consider the sp, st and nd consonant sequences found in these 5 words as insufficient evidence to contradict the posited (C)V syllable structure.

32 2. Phonology
Finally, interjections and onomatopoeias display unexpected syllable structures in Cavineña (and typically in other languages). For instance, CVC syllables are allowed in the interjection juj ‘signal uttered when approaching a house for a visit’ and the onomatopoeia tin ‘sound of action of grabbing’ (see §4.5.7 and §4.5.8).
2.4. Phonotactics
As we saw in the examples in §2.1.2, any consonant can occur in the beginning or in the middle of a word. However, not every consonant can be combined with every vowel. The following restrictions apply:
1 — y [j] is never found before i; it is found before e in only three words: iye‘kill O’, piye- ‘imitate O’ and juye ‘ox’ (borrowed from Spanish buey [bwej]); 2 — ty [c], dy [], ry [] and ny [] never occur before front vowels (i and e). The segment ny is only found in 6 words: bunyari ‘partridge sp.’, inyakwa ‘grass louse’, manyari ‘slingshot’, wanya- ‘marry O’ inyukwija ‘armpit’, nyuwiri ‘stinging hair caterpillar’; 3 — ts never occurs before the vowel i; 4 — w and kw never occur before u.
2.5. Analytical issues
A number of analytical decisions made regarding the phonological system of Cavineña require discussion.
2.5.1. Complex consonants
Within the inventory of consonant phonemes (Table 2.1), a number of segments are complex and might lend themselves to a different analysis in terms of sequences within more complex syllable structures. Such an analysis is possible for ty [c], dy [], ry [], ny [], ts, ch [
] and kw. For these, one could have posited the following alternative analyses:
(1) a (C)V(C) syllable template and no complex consonant phonemes: a sequence of two consonants consists of two different phonemes distributed over

2.5. Analytical issues 33

coda and onset of two distinct syllables (e.g., jadya ‘thus’ [had.ja] CVC.CV); (2) a (C)(C)V syllable template and no complex consonant phonemes. The consonant sequence consists of two different phonemes making the onset of single syllable (e.g., jadya ‘thus’ [ha.dja] CV.CCV); (3) a (C)V syllable template and a number of diphthong vowels (e.g., [ha.dja] CV.CV, then to be written orthographically jadia). This analysis could be proposed as an alternative to the complex consonants that involve [j] and [w], i.e., ty [c], dy [], ry [], ny [] and kw. There would only be two complex consonants (i.e., unitary phonemes), ts and ch [
].

I only discuss alternative analyses (1) and (2) here. Alternative analysis (3) is discussed under §2.5.3 together with the consonant status of y [j] and w.
An argument in favor of both (1) and (2) is that each of the consonants found in consonant sequences are also found outside of these sequences; t, d, s, sh [], k, y [j] and w have been analyzed as distinct phonemes.
Discarding alternative analysis (1) is straightforward. First, when speakers are asked to spell out words slowly, consonant sequences always come together as onset of a single syllable.

(2.22)

jadya dutya patse-da yachi bikwe-da

[ha.a] [d  .ca] [pa.tse.da]

‘thus’ ‘all’ ‘bitter-ASF’ ‘pampa’ ‘heavy-ASF’

*[had.ja] *[d t.ja] *[pat.se.da] *[jat.i] *[bik.we.da]

A second argument can be found in a reduplication process that involves the final syllable of a root (§7.1.9). In some examples, the final vowel of the root is preceded by kw or ts. When the process of final syllable reduplication is applied to these roots, as in (2.23), we observe that k and t are reduplicated along with the following consonants:3

(2.23) a. jikwi-

‘cut off’

jikwi-kwi+sha- ‘cut off many times’

*jikwi-wi+sha-

3 Note that the reduplicated syllable is obligatorily followed by the causative suffix -sha; see the full details in §7.1.9.

34 2. Phonology

b. katsa-

‘beat’

katsa-tsa+sha- ‘beat many times’

*katsa-sa+sha-

This phenomenon strongly suggests that k and t together form part of the onset of the final syllable: if they had belonged to the coda of the preceding syllable, they should not have beeen repeated. Note that I do not have examples of other complex consonants other than kw and ts involved in final syllable reduplication.
The main argument against (2) — a (C)(C)V syllable structure and only simple consonant phonemes — is the limited range of possible cluster types. The first member in the cluster may be t, d, n, l and k while the second member may be s, , j and w. There are very few possible combinations. For instance, t can be followed by j, s and  but not by w; d, n and l can only be followed by j; k can only be followed by w. These limitations suggest that the elements within these clusters function as single units rather than sequences that are independently combined in a cluster. An analysis with a (C)(C)V syllable structure would be more appealing if there were more possible sequences of consonants allowed (e.g., *pj, *mj, *kj, *ps, *pw, *tw, etc.). In the case of kw/w, an additional argument against (2) and (1) is the phonetic realization of the glide portion of kw. As we noted in §2.1, the phoneme w has a bilabial approximant allophone [ß] before front vowels (i and e). If w were an independent segment within a kw cluster, we would expect the same allophonic alternation. However, this is never the case, as the glide portion of kw is always pronounced as a labial-velar approximant; e.g., kwinana- [kwinana] ‘emerge’ (*[kßi nana]); kweri [kwei] ‘river’ (*[kße i])).

2.5.2. Vowel sequences

Cavineña allows any possible sequence of two vowels, as shown in (2.24).

‘cicada’

[ui]

tu-eke

‘there-PERL’

[ue]

yuama ‘bad’

[ua]

Sequences of three different vowels are less common but are nevertheless attested, as shown in (2.25).

(2.25)

anuai dyai-u-si e-a-u

‘sweet potatoe (?)’ ‘lazy-ASF-AUGM’ ‘POT-affect-POT’

[uai] [aiu] [eau]

In this study, I analyze the vowel sequences as consisting of distinct short vowel phonemes filling the V slots of distinct syllables. However, the following alternative analyses are also possible:

(1) VV sequences are long vowels (when identical) within the single V slot of the (C)V structure; (2) VV sequences are diphthongs (when different) within the single V slot of the (C)V structure; (3) VV sequences are sequences of distinct short vowels (whether identical or different) within a (C)(V)V syllable template.

Certain observations allow us to reject these three alternative analyses:

(1) When speakers are asked to slowly spell out words with vowel sequences (of any type), they invariably separate the vowels within different syllables (e.g., [di.i] ‘mosquito’ *[di:], [du.u] ‘howler monkey’ *[du:], etc.).

36 2. Phonology

(2) A glottal stop can always be inserted between the two vowels, as in (2.26).

(2.26) a. [di.i] [du.u]
b. [a.i] [be.i]

~ [di.i] ~ [du.u]
~ [a.i] ~ [be.i]

‘mosquito’ ‘howler monkey’
‘INT’ ‘lake, lesser anteater’

2.5.3. Glides

The two glides y [j] and w [w/ß] could be viewed as parts of diphthongs (i.e., vowels with a modified quality). As such, the glides would fill the V slot of the
(C)V syllable template, as opposed to being considered as independent conso-
nants filling the C slot of the (C)V syllable template. This possibility has already been considered for y and w within consonant sequences ty [c], dy [], ry [], ny [] and kw (alternative analysis (3) in §2.5.1).

Two possibilities are possible for a nucleus made up of a diphthong:

(1) the glide precedes the vowel (2) the glide follows the vowel
We can easily discard the second possibility. The vowel and the glide (either j or w) of a vowel-glide sequence will always fall within separated syllable in slow speech as in (2.27).

(2.27)

a. riya peya uyu-da

[i.ja] [pe.ja] [ .j  .da]

‘here’ ‘other’ ‘muddy-ASF’

*[ij.a] *[pej.a] *[ j.  .da]

b. iwi-da e-wi isawe

[i.ß i.da] [e.ß i] [i.sa.ß e]

‘smelly-ASF’ ‘NPF-beak’ ‘deaf’

*[iß .i.da] *[eß .i] *[i.saß .e]

In the case of consonant-glide sequences (i.e., ty [c], dy [], ry [], ny [] and kw), I have already shown that the two consonants always fall within a single
syllable (see (2.22)).

2.6. Morphophonology 37
The first possibility (a glide preceding the vowel) is not as easily discarded. There are two arguments in favor of the diphthong analysis. First, in glidevowel sequences, with or without a preceding consonant, the glide will always fall within the same syllable as the following vowel (e.g., ya or yu in (2.27a) and wi or we in (2.27b)). Second, recognizing diphthongs would simplify the phonological system by removing j and w, along with the complex consonants ty [c], dy [], ry [], ny [] and kw, from the consonant inventory (leaving only ts and ch [
]). However, the diphthong analysis complicates the phonological system more than it simplifies it. First, the inventory of vowels would have to comprise 6 additional vowels, ye, ya, yu, wi, we and wa (remembering that y and w never occur before i and u, respectively; see §2.4). Second, there would be very strong restrictions as to what consonant could fill the onset of syllables with diphthongs. One would have to specify that only d, t, n and r are allowed before y (i.e., dya, tya, nya and rya) — but not any other consonant (i.e., *pya, *mya, *kya, etc.) — and only k is allowed before w (i.e., kw) — but not any other consonant (i.e., *pya, *mya, *kya, etc. and *pwa, *mwa, *twa, etc.).

2.6. Morphophonology

The phonological processes discussed in this section are restricted to certain morphemes.

2.6.1. Palatalization

The noun prefix e- ‘NPF’ (§12.3.1) is realized as y- [j] when it precedes a. It is realized as e- before consonants. It is never attested before the vowels i, e or u, or before the consonant y.

(2.28) a. y-atuka y-akwa

2.6.2. Vowel deletion

The vowel in the prefix part of the reflexive/reciprocal circumfix marker k(a)-…-ti (§8.2) does not appear before a vowel-initial stem, but does appear before consonant-initial stems.

(2.29)

(REF-look.at-REF-) (REF-leave-REF-) (REF-gather-REF-) (REF-pull.off-REF-) (REF-make.turn-REF-)

Two exceptions were found in the corpus: ka-adeba-ti- ‘foretell’ from adeba‘know’ and ka-akwa-tsuru-ti- ‘face each other’, from akwa-tsuru- (chest-meet-). Examples of these words can be found in (8.32b) and (5.36), respectively.

2.6.3. Syllable deletion

The Aktionsart suffix -(ne)ni ‘RANDOM’ (§7.1.8) and the subordinate temporal clause suffix marker -(a)tsu ‘SS’ (§18.2) are realized as -neni and -atsu when they are attached to monosyllabic roots, as in (2.30a) and (2.31a), respectively. They lose their first syllable (ne and a, respectively) when they are attached to polysyllabic roots/stems, as in (2.30b) and (2.31b), respectively. Examples (2.30c) and (2.31c) show polysyllabic stems constructed on monosyllabic roots.

2.6.4. Suffix deletion

The pronominal suffixes -ra ‘ERG’ and -ke ‘FM’ drop from bound pronouns coming last in a phonological word. This is illustrated with the second person singular bound pronouns =mi-ra in (2.32a) and =mi-ke in (2.32b). The deleted suffixes are indicated by parentheses in the glossing lines.

This deletion rule is actually more complicated; see the full details in §15.2.2.

2.6.5. Clitic deletion

A relative clause (RC) is marked by the morpheme =ke ‘LIG’ that cliticizes on its last phonological word, as in (2.33); see §2.7 and Chapter 3 for a discussion of the phonological word and clitics.

For example, this happens in (2.34), where =ke would be followed by the ergative postposition =ra; the deleted marker is indicated by parentheses in the glossing line.

2.7. Accentual system 41

2.6.6. Vowel epenthesis

Cavineña has 10 monosyllabic inflecting verbal roots (see §5.2.1). When these roots are used without any affixes, they require the addition of an epenthetic vowel u.4
Examples of monosyllabic verbal roots taking a epenthetic vowel u are shown in (2.35a). Examples of polysyllabic verbal roots not taking u are shown in (2.35b).

(2.35)

a. ba-u be-u je-u ju-u

‘see-EPEN’ ‘bring-EPEN’ ‘come-EPEN’ ‘be-EPEN’

b. diru iye isara wau

‘go’ ‘kill’ ‘talk to’ ‘mix’

Note that in Cavineña, a phonological word must have a minimum of two syllables (see Chapter 3). It is likely that the addition of the u ending is a consequence of this two syllable-requirement."

2.7. Accentual system
Cavineña has a pitch-accent system where only pitch is relevant while length and intensity play no role. The accentual system is not contrastive though. Its role is to delimitate the phonological word as a prosodic domain.
A phonological word receives a particular pitch contour which makes use of two pitch levels: high and mid.5 The rules of pitch assignment are given in (2.36).

4 According to Trask (1996: 292), the exact term for this type of epenthesis is ‘prop-
aralepsis’. 5 High pitch and mid pitch contrast with low pitch at the utterance level (§2.8.1).

42 2. Phonology

(2.36) a) the first syllable receives a high pitch b) the last two syllables receive a mid pitch (the last syllable if it is a two syllable word)6 c) the high pitch of the first syllable extends rightwards to any syllable before the last two syllables

The pitch-accent contour in the phonological word can be formalized with the formula Hn(M)M (where H and M stand for high pitch and mid pitch, respectively, and n1) and gives the following possibilities for phonological
words of up to 6 syllables; note that a phonological word can be longer.

2 syllables n=1 3 syllables n=2 4 syllables n=3 5 syllables n=4 6 syllables n=5

HM HMM HHMM HHHMM HHHHMM

I illustrate each pattern in (2.37) below; high pitch is marked by an acute accent, mid pitch is unmarked.

2.8. Intonation
There do not appear to be any specific intonation patterns that distinguish between declarative, interrogative and imperative types of clauses in Cavineña. However, there are a number of intonational patterns that are used for other purposes. These patterns modify the normal Hn(M)M pitch-accent contour in the phonological word. In this section, I briefly discuss three of the identified intonational contours: the utterance-final contour (§2.8.1), the ‘contrastive’ contour (§2.8.2), and the intensifier contour (§2.8.3). Note that this discussion is still preliminary; a full study of Cavineña intonation remains to be done.

2.8.1. Utterance-final contour
The end of an utterance is signaled by a low (as opposed to mid) pitch on the final two syllables of the last phonological word. The Hn(M)M pitch contour on the last phonological word is overridden, becoming HnLL (where H and L stand for high pitch and low pitch, respectively, and n1).
The HnLL contour requires a minimum of three syllables, unlike the Hn(M)M which is possible over a two syllable word. With phonological words of three or more syllables, there is only a change in the pitch from M to L of the

44 2. Phonology

final two syllables, as illustrated in (2.38); a grave accent marks low pitch.

(2.38) a. 3 syllables

… mée=ju saltlick=LOC

bá-nátí-kwàrè. see-GO.TEMP-REM.PAST

‘While I was going I saw (a big male coati) in a saltlick.’ mj119

The HnLL pitch contour, however, cannot apply to two syllables words. Two
syllable words merge together with the preceding phonological word, in which case the HnLL pitch contour applies to the last two phonological words of the

Recall that there is no special interrogative or imperative intonation in Cavineña. In other words, the utterance-final contour applies equally to any type of clause.This is the case in the interrogative clause in (2.39d), for example.

2.8.2. Emphatic contour
The Hn(M)M unmarked contour is sometimes replaced by an H(Mn)M emphatic contour, in which case the high pitch of the first syllable does not extend rightwards (see rule (2.36c)). As a result, there is a high pitch on the first syllable only and a mid pitch on all the remaining syllables in the phonological word. Typically, this happens with the first phonological word of an utterance. The meaning appears to be emphatic. An example is given in (2.40).

‘Finally, when it was getting dark, I arrived.’ sd067

In some cases, in addition to the high pitch, the vowel is also lengthened, as in (2.40). But in other cases, vowel lengthening does not occur (as in chapa=kwana ‘dogs’ in (2.42) below).

2.8.3. Intensifier contour
The penultimate syllable of (predicative) adjectives in copula complement function (§11.1.1) can be singled out and given prominence through the combination of vowel lengthening, increased intensity and increased duration of preceding or following consonants. Semantically this has the effect of intensifying the quality denoted by the adjective. An example is presented in (2.41).

2.9. Phonology of loanwords
Cavineña has borrowed a large number of words from Spanish (and Aymara/Quechua to a lesser degree). In a number of cases, the loanwords have been fully integrated into the phonological system of the language. That is, the segments of these words have been reorganized according to (1) the set of possible consonants and vowels in Cavineña (Table 2.1 and Table 2.2), (2) the syllable structure of the language (§2.3) and (3) the accentual system of the language (§2.7).
For example, this is the case with the noun irisha ‘church’ [íia] (from Spanish iglesia [iglésja]).7 There are a number of differences between the two words. In terms of accent, the word has lost its penultimate stress and has acquired an Hn(M)M pitch contour, realized on this three syllable word by high pitch on the first syllable and mid pitch on the final two). In terms of syllable structure, the complex syllable onsets gl and si [sj] (and the sounds g and l which are foreign to Cavineña) have been converted into the single phonemes r
7 Note that the acute accent marks high pitch in Cavineña and a stressed syllable in Spanish.

2.10. Previous writing systems 47
[] and sh []. In addition to these modifications, we observe the change of the vowel e of the second syllable into an i.8
In other cases, the segments in the borrowed words have not (or have only partially) been adapted into the Cavineña system (presumably because they are more recent borrowings). For example, the noun gringo [g ígo] ‘foreign man of Caucasian type’ is not pronounced any differently in Cavineña than it is in Spanish, although the complex onset gr [g ] (and the sound g), the coda n [] and the nasal-stop cluster are all foreign to the system. In addition, the vowel o is pronounced exactly like Spanish o (not like Cavineña []). In this study, these words have been written with their Spanish orthography and therefore include letters such as g [g], v [b/ß], f [f], o [o], etc. Some examples are carga ‘load’, directiva ‘board of leaders’, familia ‘family’, junio ‘June’, etc.
The study of how foreign words have been integrated into the Cavineña system is a fascinating topic. However, it will not be dealt with here, as it falls outside the scope of the present description of Cavineña.
2.10. Previous writing systems
The first orthography created for the Cavineña language is found in Key (1963b). This system is based on the Spanish orthography. The velar stop /k/ is written qu before the front vowels i and e, and c before non-front vowels a and u. The labial-velar glide /w/ is written hu. The glottal fricative /h/ is written j. The alveo-palatal nasal // is written ñ. The alveo-palatal // is written ll. See Table 2.3 below.
Key’s (1963b) alphabet is slightly modified in the subsequent work by Camp and/or Liccardi — the alphabet both authors use throughout their work is listed in Camp and Liccardi 1989: xi. The authors use the grapheme u instead of o to represent the back vowel phoneme //. They also leave out the glottal stop, as it is not a phoneme in Cavineña, and the liquid l.9
In 1996, in the context of the Bolivian educational reform for multicultural-
8 Note that it is not clear why such a change happened, since e is a phoneme in Cavineña.
9 In the case of the glottal stop, it is not a phoneme in Cavineña (but an optional means by which to distinguish two vowels in a sequence (e.g., (2.26)). As for l, as far as I can see, Key only uses this grapheme for words borrowed from Spanish (e.g., leche ‘milk’, baila ‘dance’, etc.)

48 2. Phonology

bilingual education (§1.6), I proposed a revised alphabet based on a more straightforward association between phonemes and graphemes (Guillaume 1996). The two graphemes qu and c are replaced by k, the grapheme hu is replaced by w and the grapheme cu is replace by kw. The graphemes ll and ñ, which occur in very few words, are retained.
Most of the graphemes used in this study follow Guillaume (1996), except for two forms. I use ry instead of ll and ny instead of ñ. This makes clearer the fact that these two phonemes belong to the series of alveo-palatal phonemes. This also makes the reading easier for readers unfamiliar with the Spanish orthographic system.
Table 2.3 shows the four different writing systems. Letters revised from one system to another are in bold face.

Chapter 3 Grammatical vs. phonological word

In Cavineña, as in many languages, a distinction must be made between the grammatical word and the phonological word since they are not always in correspondance. One phonological word can be made up of two (or more) grammatical words while one grammatical word made up of two phonological words.
In this chapter, I will first give the criteria for both word types in Cavineña (§3.1) — see Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) for a discussion of criteria for both types of word in a cross-linguistic perspective. Then I will discuss the situations where the two types of words do not coincide with each other (§3.2).

3.1. Criteria for grammatical vs. phonological word

3.1.1. Grammatical word

A grammatical word in Cavineña has the following characteristics:

1 — it can have one or more syllables;

(3.1)

=ju

beta

matuja

chamakama

(=LOC) ‘two’ ‘caiman’ ‘finally’

1 syll 2 syll 3 syll 4 syll

2 — it can be monomorphemic, as in the previous examples, or polymorphemic;

(3.2) a. 2 morphemes

e-na kasa-da jikwi-ya

(NPF-water) (strong-ASF) (cut.off-IMPFV)

52 3. Grammatical vs. phonological word

b. 3 morphemes

e-tawi-ki neti-tsura-kware

(NMLZ-sleep-NMLZ) (stand-GO.UP-REM.PAST)

c. 4 morphemes

Jeke-sha-nuka-kware (fill.up-CAUS-REITR-REM.PAST) Kwa-baka-nuka-tsu (go-SHORT.TIME-REITR-SS)

What are the criteria for determining whether two morphemes are part of the same grammatical word or separate grammatical words? According to Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002: 19), the parts of a grammatical word ‘always occur together, occur in a fixed order and have conventionalized coherence and meaning’.
We can illustrate this with a number of morphemes in Cavineña with different statuses. The morpheme kware encodes the meaning ‘remote past’ (§6.1.1), as in tawi-kware (sleep-REM.PAST) ‘slept’. This morpheme can only occur together with a lexeme from the verb class. For example, it is impossible to have *chapa-kware, where chapa ‘dog’ is a noun, or *ari-kware, ‘where ari- ‘big’ is an adjective. In addition, kware obligatorily follows the verb lexeme (*kwaretawi). The morpheme kware can therefore be analyzed as a part of a grammatical word, rather than an independent grammatical word.
We can contrast -kware with a morpheme such as beru ‘before, long ago’ (§16.1) which is fully independent grammatically. Beru, similarly to -kware, can co-occur with a verb and directly follow it, as in ina-kware beru (grabREM.PAST before) ‘grabbed long ago’. However, unlike -kware, beru can also precede the verb, as in beru kueti-kware (before pass-REM.PAST) ‘passed long ago’. Beru can even be discontinuous with the verb, as in inimetupu-kware esiri=kwana=ra beru (think-REM.PAST old=PL=ERG before) ‘the elders thought long ago’. This morpheme can therefore be analyzed as a grammatically independent word (as opposed to being a part of an independent grammatical word).
A number of morphemes are grammatically less independent than beru but more independent than kware. This is the case with ama ‘NEG’ (§17.2.9). When ama occurs with a verb, it must follow it, as in jikwi-ya=ama (cut.offkware=NEG) ‘did not cut’ (*ama=jikwi-ya). However =ama is not restricted to occurring only with verbs. It can also occur with nouns, as with the place name Bolivar in Bolivar=ama ‘not Bolivar’, or with a postposition, as in e-kwaa=tsewe=ama (1-mother=ASSOC=NEG) ‘not with my mother’. Despite having less flexibility than morphemes such as beru, clitic morphemes such as =ama are nevertheless still independent grammatical words because, as I have shown, they are not bound to a particular word class.

3.2. Mismatch between grammatical and phonological words 53

3.1.2. Phonological word

The phonological word, unlike the grammatical word, can only be defined with
language-internal criteria (Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002: 13). In Cavineña, a
phonological word must have: (1) a minimum of two syllables and (2) an independent Hn(M)M pitch contour (see §2.7).
Examples illustrating the assignment of the Hn(M)M pitch contour on
phonological words of various lengths are given in (3.3); high pitch is encoded
with an acute accent on top of a vowel while mid pitch is left unmarked.

(3.3)

béta

‘two’

2 syll

kímisha

‘three’

3 syll

jútákiju

‘therefore’

4 syll

wésá-tána-tsu

‘(lift-PASS-SS)

5 syll

nétí-dírú-kware (stand-GO.PERM-REM.PAST)

6 syll

In the speech chain, the boundary between two independent phonological
words is identified by a characteristic mid-pitch-high-pitch sequence. The mid pitch corresponds to the end of the preceding phonological word. The high pitch corresponds to the beginning of the following phonological word.1 In (3.4), I
illustrate a number of phonological word sequences taken from texts.

c. jútákiju ré-keja therefore here-LOC.GNL
‘therefore (I’m going) this way’ ba037

b. pére émake raft under
‘under the raft’ mj055

3.2. Mismatch between grammatical and phonological words
All the examples of phonological words illustrated above correspond to one grammatical word, in which case both the grammatical and phonological words are identical. However, not all phonological words correspond to a single grammatical word, and not all grammatical words correspond to a single
1 Note that this is true as long as this pattern is not overridden by a different pitch contour such the utterance-final contour (§2.8.1), the emphatic contour (§2.8.2) or the intensifier contour (§2.8.3).

54 3. Grammatical vs. phonological word
phonological word in Cavineña. There can be two types of mismatch that may occur:
1 — one phonological word consisting of more than one grammatical word, as with clitics (§3.2.1); 2 — one grammatical word consisting of more than one phonological word (normally two), as with full reduplication (§3.2.2).

3.2.1. One phonological word = two (or more) grammatical words

Cavineña has an important number of grammatical words which are prosodically deficient. These morphemes are called clitics and written with ‘=’. Although they qualify as independent grammatical words (according to the criteria in §3.1.1 above), they do not qualify as independent phonological words. They do not receive the phonological word Hn(M)M pitch-contour independently but attached to an already independent phonological word. In Cavineña, most clitics link to the preceding word and can be referred to as enclitics. The only attested cases of procliticization are the particle ni= ‘NOT.EVEN’ (§17.2.10) and monosyllabic verb roots when modified by a particular set of quantifier markers (§10.4).
In connected speech, the mid-pitch-high-pitch sequence that characterizes the juncture between two independent phonological words does not occur at the juncture between a clitic and the preceding (or the following) phonological word. This can be illustrated by comparing the juncture between the two phonological words in (3.4a) (repeated) with the juncture between a phonological word and a clitic (postposition) in (3.5).

(3.4a)

péadya úra

(3.5)

é-spéré=keja

(*é-spere=kéja)

NPF-stream=LOC.GNL

‘in the direction of the stream’ ba037

In both examples, we have a sequence of two grammatical words with the same
number of (five) syllables. But in (3.4a), the prosody is HMMHM. There are two different phonological words which each receiving the Hn(M)M contour
separately. In (3.5), the prosody is HHHMM because only one phonological word receives the Hn(M)M contour.

3.2. Mismatch between grammatical and phonological words 55

The next pair of examples contrasts the two independent phonological words of (3.4b) (repeated) and a sequence of one phonological word followed by two clitic morphemes (plural marker and ergative marker) in (3.6).

(3.6)

chápá=kwána=ra

dog=PL=ERG

‘dogs’ ba074

(*chápa=kwána=ra)

Here again, we have two sequences with the same number of syllables but in (3.4b), the Hn(M)M pattern applies to each of the two different phonological words, while in (3.6), the pattern applies once to the whole sequence.
In (3.7), I provide examples of phonological words consisting of various numbers of grammatical words (from 2 to 4) and with various length (from 3 to 9 syllables).

(monkey=SIMLR=EMPH=3SG-FM) aj008

3.2.2. One grammatical word = two phonological words

The other mismatch between the grammatical word and the phonological word in Cavineña occurs with full (but not partial) reduplication. Here, one gram-
matical word (the reduplicated word) consists of two phonological words (the two non-reduplicated parts). Both parts receive the Hn(M)M independently, as
illustrated in (3.8).

b. reduplication of a 3 syllables word

(*kwínáná-kwínana)

sl026

The requirement that both parts of a reduplicated word be separate
phonological words (with a minimum of two syllables and with independent Hn(M)M contours) is also reflected by the fact that when a monosyllabic root is
reduplicated, each part is augmented by an epenthetic vowel -u (see §2.6.6), as
in (3.9).

3.3. Monosyllabic grammatical words
Since a phonological word requires at least two syllables, monosyllabic roots never form phonological words by themselves. They always require an additional syllable. The additional syllable is provided by two processes in Cavineña: affixation or cliticization (but not vowel lengthening).
Many Cavineña monosyllabic roots belong to word classes whose members are all (or mostly) clitics (either mono- or polysyllabic). For these monosyllabic roots, the additional syllable is provided by an adjacent phonological word to which they are attached. This is the case with the postpositions =ra ‘ERG’, =ju ‘LOC’ and =ja ‘DAT/GEN’ (§4.5.1 and Chapter 14), the subordinate clause markers =ra ‘PURP.MOT’, =ju ‘DS’, and =ke ‘LIG’ (§4.5.6, Chapters 18, 19 and 20), the second position particles =pa ‘REP’ and =ni ‘MAYBE’ (§4.5.5 and Chapter 16), and phrasal particle =dya ‘FOC’ (§4.5.5 and Chapter 17).
There are also monosyllabic roots which belong to word classes whose members are independent phonological words (not clitics). With some word classes, the root is never found without at least one affix. This is the case with the pronominal root mi- ‘2SG’, the adverbial demonstrative root re- ‘here’ (§4.5.2 and Chapter 15), and the five monosyllabic predicative da-adjectives ba- ‘cold’, de- ‘deep’, ji- ‘good’, mu- ‘scary’ and tsa- ‘scarce’ (§4.3 and §11.2).
However, for verbs and nouns (inflecting verbs and e-nouns in particular), there are contexts where roots can be found without affixes. In the remainder of this section, I discuss the various ways monosyllabic verbs and nouns form independent phonological words in such contexts.
There are ten monosyllabic inflecting verbs, as given in (3.10), each sorted according to its transitivity value. Note that all non-inflecting verbs are polysyllabic.

58 3. Grammatical vs. phonological word

(3.10)

a. jejukwapatsa-

‘come’ ‘be’ ‘go’ ‘cry’ ‘laugh’

b. ababeryu-
c. tya

‘affect O’ ‘see O’ ‘bring O’ ‘comb O’ ‘give O to O’

Monosyllabic verbs form a full phonological word through one of the following mechanisms:

1 — the addition of a verbal affix, as in né-kwa (HORT.DL-go) and tsá-ya (laugh-IMPFV). Note that the verb of any main verbal clause requires an inflectional affix; 2 — the addition of an epenthetic vowel -u ‘EPEN’, as in bá-u ‘see-EPEN’ and bé-u ‘bring-EPEN’. This happens when no verbal affix can be included with the verb, as in full reduplication marking the antipassive (§8.3.1), or when a verb is used in a main clause without the (otherwise obligatory) inflection (§6.1.6); 3 — the addition of a clitic. This happens with non-finite adverbial clause markers, as in jú=ishu (be=PURP.GNL), á=ra (affect=PURP.MOT) and jé=wie (come=JUST.BEFORE); 4 — the procliticization of the verb onto a following (verbal) modifier. This happens with auxiliary-triggering postposed markers (§10.4), as in jú=péadya (be=ONCE) and jú=kímisha (be=THREE.TIMES). Note that there is no attested instance of verb encliticization.

There are five monosyllabic noun roots which all belong to the e-noun subclass, as given in (3.11).

(3.11)

-bi ‘arm’ -ka ‘egg’ -na ‘water’

-tse ‘tooth’ -wi ‘beak’

Nouns from the e-noun subclass obligatorily take a dummy e- prefix, whether they are mono- or polysyllabic (see §12.3.1). As such, the monosyllabic e-nouns can form independent phonological words (thus e-ka ‘egg’, e-na ‘water’, e-bi ‘arm’, etc.). However, in some contexts, e-nouns lose their prefix e-. This notably happens when they are modified by preceding noun. When monosyllabic e-nouns lose their prefix e-, they are encliticized to the preceding noun, i.e., dáti=ka ‘tortoise egg’, kwéri=na ‘river water’, etc. The e- prefix is also lost in various derivational processes. All derivational processes involving nouns are marked by affixes. As such, the monosyllabic e-nouns form independent phonological words together with the derivational affix (e.g., with the adjectivizer -ma ‘WITHOUT’ in tsé-ma ‘toothless’).

3.4. When a phonological word only consists of clitics 59

3.4. When a phonological word only consists of clitics

In some cases, one phonological word can only consist of clitics. This appears to happen in the examples given in (3.12); separate phonological words are between square brackets.

(3.12)

a. … [é-na]

[=tséwe=dya]…

NPF-water =ASSOC=FOC

‘(This time, I arrived) with water.’ sd101

b. … [píshika] [métro] [=túpú=dyane]…

five

meter =UP.TO=APPROX

‘(I could see the anteater) about five meters away (from me).’ ba118

c. … [kwéjá-wa=ju] [=tú-ké =ékwana]… inform-PERF=DS =3SG-FM =1PL(-ERG)
‘When they told that to us, we (first thought that) it (was not serious).’ T1.5

In (3.12a), we expect a single HHHMM pitch contour coding a single phonological word since =tsewe ‘ASSOC’ is a clitic. However, what we hear is a sequence of an HM contour followed by an HMM contour, which suggests that there are two different phonological words.
In (3.12b), we expect a sequence of a HMM contour followed by a single HHHHMM contour since =tupu ‘UP.TO’ is a clitic. However, what we have is a sequence of a HMM contour followed by a HM contour followed by a HHMM contour, which suggests that there are three different phonological words.
In (3.12c), we expect a single HHHHHHHMM contour since =tu-ke ‘3SGFM’ and =ekwana ‘1PL(-ERG)’ are clitics. However, what happens is a sequence of a HHMM contour followed by a HHHMM contour which suggests that there are two different phonological words.
In these three examples, it appears that a clitic followed by another clitic can begin a new phonological word. As a result one phonological word only consists of clitics. This issue has not been fully investigated. It could be that in this language sequences of clitics can indeed form independent phonological words. This could also be the effect of a secondary stress or a specific intonational contour which has not been identified; recall that the Hn(M)M pitch contour which defines a phonological word can be modified by specific intonational patterns such as the utterance-final contour, the emphatic contour and the intensifier contour discussed in §2.8.

Chapter 4 Grammatical overview
This chapter is an overview of Cavineña grammar. The first section lists the words classes (§4.1). The next four sections present each word class within its superordinate phrasal environment: predicate structure and verbs (§4.2), predicative adjectives (§4.3), NP structure, nouns and NP modifiers, which consist of attributive adjectives, number markers and quantifiers (§4.4), and remaining word classes, which consist of postpositions, pronouns, demonstratives, content question words, particles, subordinate clause markers, interjections and onomatopoeias (§4.5).
Clause structure is the topic of §4.6. I first present the structure of basic main clauses (§4.6.1), followed by a discussion of grammatical functions (§4.6.2). Other types of clauses are discussed next: copula clauses (§4.6.3), imperative and hortative clauses (§4.6.4), interrogative clauses (§4.6.5) and negative clauses (§4.6.6). Dependent clauses are introduced in §4.7. The last section discusses coordination (§4.8).
4.1. Word classes
Classes of words are determined by morphological possibilities, syntactic behavior and semantic content. Cavineña word classes are listed in Table 4.1, together with indications about whether they consist of a lexical or a grammatical class, whether they are open or closed, their phonological status, and where in this chapter the word class is discussed.
The following remarks can be made about the table:
— Cavineña has two different classes of adjectives: predicative adjectives and attributive adjectives. As we will see, predicative adjectives function ‘predicatively’ (as copula complements) but not attributively. In contast, attributive adjectives function attributively (as NP modifiers) but not ‘predicatively’; — Cavineña does not have a class of articles; — Cavineña does not have a specific class of adverbs. Concepts of manner, such as ‘well’, ‘fast’, etc., concepts of location, such as ‘upriver’, ‘here’, etc. and concepts of time, such as ‘today’, ‘tomorrow’, etc., are expressed by predicative adjectives (used adverbially), particles or demonstratives.

4.2. Predicate and verbs
The predicate consists of a verb and its modifiers. In Cavineña, the predicate can be simple or complex. When the predicate is simple, the lexical verb carries all the verbal affixes. Here the verb structure matches the predicate structure. When the predicate is complex, the lexical verb is accompanied by an auxiliary which carries (at least part of) the verbal affixes. Here the verb structure and the predicate structure do not match. Predicate structure is presented in §4.2.1. Verbs, which head the predicate, are discussed in §4.2.2.
4.2.1. Predicate structure
The predicate in Cavineña can be described in terms of 11 structural slots, from A to K, as shown in the following slot diagram:

Slot A: Slot B: Slot C: Slot D: Slot E: Slot F: Slot G: Slot H: Slot I: Slot J: Slot K:

Inflectional prefix Preverbal modifier Valency-changing prefix Verb root Auxiliary Postural or directional suffix Valency-changing suffixes Aktionsart suffixes Mode suffix Postverbal modifier Inflectional suffix

4.2 Predicate and verbs 63

A brief description of each slot is given below:

— Slots A and K are filled by obligatory and therefore inflectional markers. There can only be one morpheme per slot at a time. There are prefixes that go into slot A, as in (4.1a), suffixes that go into slot K, as in (4.1b), and circumfixes that go into both slots A and K, as in (4.1c). Note that superscript capital letters refer to structural slots within the predicate structure while subscript capital letters refer to core grammatical functions.

— Slots B and I are filled by optional auxiliary-triggering modifiers. These modifiers prevent the verb from taking inflectional affixes (slot A/K). Inflectional affixes are then obligatorily attached to an auxiliary (in slot E). Slot B is filled by phonologically independent words, as with pana ‘PROPERLY’ in (4.2a). Slot I is filled by suffixes, as with -kara ‘DESID’ in (4.2b). The auxiliary-

The presentation of the structure of the predicate can be completed by the following two remarks:

— only verbs can head the predicate; — the predicate does not make any reference to the arguments of the clause (S, A, O) or the obliques (dative, associative, locative, etc.).

4.2.2. Verbs
Verbs in Cavineña only function as the head of the predicate. They cannot head an NP unless they are nominalized. They cannot function as NP modifiers unless they are used within a relative clause.
Verbs can be subdivided between:
1 — inflecting verbs which directly take affixes (e.g., tawi- ‘sleep’, peta- ‘look at’); 2 — non-inflecting verbs which cannot carry any affix and require an auxiliary for this purpose (e.g., mere ju- ‘work’, kwatsabiji a- ‘tell a story to O’).
Both inflecting verbs and non-inflecting verbs can be further subdivided between:
1 — intransitive verbs (i.e., with one core argument S). Non-inflecting intransitive verbs require the intransitive auxiliary ju- ‘be’, as in (4.4); 2 — two extended intransitive non-inflecting verbs (i.e., with two core arguments S and E): bawe ju- ‘know E’ and baekwa ju- ‘not know E’; 3 — transitive verbs (i.e., with two core arguments A and O). Non-inflecting transitive verbs require the transitive auxiliary a- ‘affect’, as in (4.5); 4 — ditransitive verbs (i.e., with three core arguments A, O and O);1
1 It will be seen that the two non-subject arguments of ditransitive verbs are treated identically to the single non-subject argument (O) of (mono)transitive verbs by Cavineña grammar.

4.2 Predicate and verbs 67
5 — two S=A ambitransitive inflecting verbs (i.e., either with one core argument S or with two core arguments A and O): kike-/keke- ‘shout, shout at O’ and kwina- ‘give birth, give birth to O’.
Inflecting verbs and non-inflecting verbs behave differently with regard to derivation and borrowing, as follows:
1 — the subclass of inflecting verbs is open to derivation (from nouns and predicative adjectives) but closed to borrowing; 2 — the subclass of non-inflecting verbs is open to both derivation (essentially from inflecting verbs) and borrowing.
Verbs are discussed at length in §5.2 (inflecting verbs) and §5.3 (noninflecting verbs).
4.2.3. Verb modifiers
The closed class of verb modifiers consist of grammatically and phonologically independent morphemes that function as aspectual or manner modifiers. They are all auxiliary-triggering; that is, once they have been applied to a verb, any additional verbal suffixes must be carried by an auxiliary. According to their position in the predicate structure and their semantics, they can be divied into three categories:
1 — preverbal modifiers consist of four morphemes that go into slot B: nere ‘VIGOROUSLY’, yume ‘IMMEDIATELY’, riya ‘STARTLING’ and pana ‘PROPERLY’. They are discussed in §10.2; 2 — discontinuous modifiers involve two morphemes that go into slot B, jadya ‘MAN’ and ejebucha ‘MAN.INT’, and that require to be used in conjunction with a suffix -e in slot I. They are presented in §10.3; 3 — postverbal modifiers correspond to three morphemes that go into slot J: pidya ‘ONCE’, beta ‘TWICE’, and kimisha ‘THREE.TIMES’. They are the topic of §10.4.

‘MAN’ ‘MAN.INT’
‘ONCE’ ‘TWICE’ ‘THREE.TIMES’

4.3. Predicative adjectives

In Cavineña, we need to distinguish between two different word classes of adjectives:

1— Predicative adjectives primarily function as copula complement, as with ari- ‘big’ in (4.9a). Predicative adjectives can also function as adverbs and secondary predicates. However, they cannot function as NP modifiers, unless they are used within a copula relative clause — in which case they are marked with the relative clause marker =ke ‘LIG’ — as with ari- ‘big’ in (4.9b).

[maletero ari-daCC=keRC]S.

bag

big-ASF=LIG

‘I had a big bag (lit. a big bag sat to me).’ mj052

2 — Attributive adjectives only function as NP head modifiers. They cannot function as copula complement, adverb or secondary predicate. They have therefore been assigned to a different word class (see §4.4.3).

Predicative adjectives are further subdivided into two subclasses on morphological grounds:

4.4 Noun phrase — nouns and NP modifiers 69

1 — da-adjectives consist of a closed subclass of about 110 to 120 bound roots which must take an affix or be reduplicated. By default, da-adjectives carry the dummy suffix -da ‘ASF’, as with ari- ‘big’ in (4.9); 2 — independent adjectives consist of an open subclass (of at least 40 to 50 basic roots) which do not need to take any affixes or be reduplicated. They never take the -da dummy suffix, as shown in (4.10).

PureamaCC (*pureama-da) =ekwanaCS

happy

=1PL

‘We were happy…’ ga008

ju-kwareCP… be-REM.PAST

Da-adjectives and independent adjectives express the typical adjectival concepts of DIMENSION, AGE, VALUE, COLOR, PHYSICAL PROPERTIES, HUMAN PROPENSITIES, etc. (as per Dixon 1982, 2004). Da-adjectives tend to express positive concepts while independent adjectives tend to express negative concepts, as shown in (4.11).

(4.11)

da-adjective

independent adjective

ari- ‘big’
nana- ‘young’ juji- ‘fat’

achacha / ashasha esiri ushuri

‘small’ (DIMENSION)
‘old’ (AGE/VALUE) ‘skinny’ (PHYS. PROPERTY)

Note that this is only a tendency, as some negative concepts can be conveyed by da-adjectives (e.g., da-adjective baji- ‘scared’) and positive concepts by independent adjectives (e.g., pureama ‘happy’).
Predicative da-adjectives are closed to both derivation and borrowing. Predicative independent adjectives, on the other hand, are open to both processes.
Predicative adjectives are discussed at length in Chapter 11.

4.4. Noun phrase — nouns and NP modifiers
4.4.1. NP structure
The noun phrase in Cavineña can be described in terms of 8 structural slots (from A to H), each associated with a particular type of constituent, as shown in the following slot diagram and illustrated by the cross-referenced examples:

70 4. Grammatical overview

Slot A: Slot B: Slot C: Slot D: Slot E: Slot F: Slot G: Slot H:

Relative clause Quantifier Genitive modifier Juxtaposed noun Head noun Attributive adjective Number Relative clause

(4.2c), (4.3b), (4.36) (4.12c), (4.14), (4.23), (4.37) (4.12a), (4.12c), (4.29) (4.12a), (4.18), (4.39) (4.12a), (4.12b), (4.12c), (4.14) (4.12b), (4.20) (4.12b), (4.12c), (4.21), (4.23), (4.32) (4.12c), (4.14)

Examples illustrating the co-occurrence of various NP constituents are given in (4.12). Recall that superscript capital letters refer to structural slots within the NP while subscript capital letters refer to grammatical functions.

Note that the situation where all NP slots are filled at the same time is never encountered in the available data, although there is no apparent constraint on particular combinations.
Only a noun can head an NP, even though the nominal NP head is often ellipsed. When this happens its identity is always recoverable from the context, as in (4.13).

Note that some NP modifiers obligatorily require an overt head. This restriction applies to genitive modifiers, juxtaposed nouns and attributive adjectives.
Verbal relative clauses (RC) normally fill slot H, as in (4.14).

‘What are the names of the four men who went to kill the enemies?’ mk098

Slot A is normally filled by very particular types of copula RCs, notably demonstrative copula RCs. Demonstrative copula RCs consist of a pointing demonstrative (§4.5.3) in CC function within a copula clause that is relativized (with obligatory deletion of the copula predicate), as in (4.2c), (4.3b) and (4.36). This serves as a strategy to remedy the fact that Cavineña does not have specific nominal demonstratives (i.e., demonstratives used within NPs), but only adverbial demonstratives.
RCs are marked by the subordinate clause marker =ke ‘LIG’ (§4.5.6). This marker is deleted when it occurs in the same clitic sequence with a postposition and when it precedes the postposition, as shown in (4.15):

72 4. Grammatical overview

4.4.2. Nouns

Nouns in Cavineña are the only word class that can be the head of an NP (in slot E).2 Nouns can also function as (juxtaposed) modifiers of a noun in an NP.
There are three subclasses of nouns distinguished by morpho-syntactic crite-
ria:

1 — e-nouns consist of a closed class of about 100 to 150 terms which must take a dummy prefix e- ‘NPF’ (realized as y- before the vowel a). This prefix drops in a number of circumstances. E-nouns refer to parts of entities, such as -atsanaka ‘mouth’ and -wachi ‘foot’ shown in (4.16).

‘He (a caiman) opened its mouth, and almost bit my foot (lit. almost bit me on the foot).’ lg013

2 — kinship nouns consist of a closed small class of about 30 terms which are (obligatorily) inflected for the person of their possessor. They refer to kinship relations such as wane ‘wife’, as in (4.17), tata ‘father’, anu ‘grandmother’, etc..

3-wife=3=ERG

BM

see-GO.TEMP-REM.PAST 3SG-FM

‘His wife went to see him.’ mu041

3 — independent nouns consist of an open class of a few thousand terms which do not take any e- prefix nor any possessor inflections. They refer to fauna, flora, artifact, proper nouns, etc. There is also an interrogative noun, ai ‘INT’; see an illustration in (4.12a).
E-nouns and independent nouns (but not kinship nouns) can be used as juxtaposed modifiers (in slot D) to another noun (as NP head in slot E). When the modified noun is an e-noun, its e- prefix is obligatorily deleted. This is illustrated in (4.18) with the e-noun -rami ‘flesh’ modified by the independent noun waka ‘cow’.

2 It will be seen that independent pronouns can fill NP slots (§4.5.2). Unlike nouns, however, independent pronouns make a full NP by themselves (i.e., they cannot take any NP modifiers). They are not, strictly speaking, the head of an NP.

An example with the independent noun arusu ‘rice’ functioning as a juxtaposed modifier to tee ‘garden’ can be seen in (4.12a).
Nouns are discussed at length in §12.3 (e-nouns), §12.4 (kinship nouns) and §12.5 (independent nouns).

4.4.3. Attributive adjectives

Attributive adjectives are a closed class of 16 bare roots which cannot take affixes or be reduplicated. They are listed in (4.19), sorted by semantic type.

4.4.4. Number markers

Cavineña has three number markers. It has a dual marker, =ekatse ‘DL’, and two plural markers, =kwana ‘PL’, used with any type of noun, and =ekana ‘PL’, used with kinship nouns possessed by first and second persons. Number markers have the following morpho-syntactic properties:

1 — they consist of bare roots which cannot take any affixes or be reduplicated; 2 — they are enclitics. That is, they are not phonologically independent; they obligatorily require a host which must be an NP constituent; 3 — they only function as modifiers to the head of an NP (in slot G). The dual number marker =ekatse ‘DL’ is illustrated in (4.21).

There is a closed class of quantifiers which includes the ten numerals in (4.22a), the four logical quantifiers in (4.22b), the quantifier question marker ejeuma ‘how many/much’, and the word peya ‘other’.

(4.22)

a. peadya beta kimisha pushi pishika

‘one’ ‘two’ ‘three’ ‘four’ ‘five’

shukuta pakaruku kimisakaruku puskuruku tunka

‘six’ ‘seven’ ‘eight’ ‘nine’ ‘ten’

b. dutya

‘all’

umada/jetiama ‘many, a lot of’3

umae

‘few’

3 These two logical quantifiers are synonymous.

4.5 Remaining word classes 75

Quantifiers have the following morpho-syntactic properties:

1 — quantifiers are bare roots. They cannot take affixes or be reduplicated; 2 — quantifiers only function as NP modifiers (in slot B of the NP structure).

The quantifier dutya ‘all’ is illustrated in (4.23).

4.5.1. Postpositions

Cavineña has a closed class of postpositions. Postpositions relate an NP to a predicate or a (superordinate) NP head. Postpositions are bare roots which cannot take any affixes or be reduplicated.
Cavineña has two types of postpositions. First, the language has postpositions that require an argument. They are listed in (4.24).

4 Note that the dative postposition and the genitive postposition are homophonous.

76 4. Grammatical overview

Second, the language has postpositions that do not require an argument, although they can (and often) take one. The full list is given in (4.25), sorted semantically.

A number of postpositions are enclitics. They are attached to the last phonological word of the NP that they are marking, as with =tsewe ‘ASSOC’ in (4.26)).

Wikamutya=ra =pa =tuS

‘He went fishing with his wife.’ vz003

Other postpositions are independent phonological words. They are postposed to the NP that they mark, as with jiteke ‘LOOKING.FOR’ in (4.27).

5 There are no clear meaning differences between the postpositions pijidyane and japadama.

4.5 Remaining word classes 77

Finally, let us note the use in Cavineña of the Spanish preposition hasta ‘until, up to, as far as’. As in Spanish, this morpheme is preposed to its argument in Cavineña, as with the adverbial demontrative re-keja in (4.28). Note that except for this borrowed morpheme, Cavineña does not have any preposition.

(4.28)

Amena aje-etibe-chine

[hasta re-keja].

BM walk-COME.PERM.DISTR-REC.PAST until here-LOC.GNL

‘I came back walking slowly until here (Misión Cavinas).’ ka458

See also hasta with the independent particle riyakama ‘now’, giving hasta riyakama ‘until now’, in (12.64) and (T1.112).
Postpositions are discussed in Chapter 14.

4.5.2. Pronouns
There are two major types of pronouns in Cavineña: (1) independent pronouns, with different sets for core functions (S/CS, A and O) and for various oblique functions (DAT, GEN, ASSOC, LOC.GNL and ‘ALONE’), and (2) second position bound pronouns, with distinct sets for core functions (S/CS, A and O) and one set for the dative oblique function (DAT) — there are no second position bound pronouns for GEN, ASSOC, LOC.GNL and ‘ALONE’ functions.
In addition to these two major types, Cavineña has two independent pronominal-like morphemes, ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘3PL’, only used to refer to S/CS or O arguments. Finally, the language has a prefix e- ‘1’ and a circumfix e-…=ke ‘3’ that attach to the subclass of kinship nouns and refer to the person of the possessor.
Independent pronouns and second position bound pronouns are basically identical in form: they have the same segmental make-up, encoding person, number and case with essentially the same roots and suffixes. The only exception resides in the roots of the third person singular proximate absolutive forms — riya for independent pronouns and ri for bound pronouns — and the root of the third person singular proximate dative forms — riya for independent pronouns and re for bound pronouns. In Table 4.3 and Table 4.4, for convenience, the two types of pronouns are not distinguished, apart from those third singular singular forms, where the independent form is written before an oblique stroke and the bound form after it.

Independent pronouns and bound pronouns have very different morphosyntactic properties, as follows:

1 — independent pronouns are phonologically and grammatically independent words that fill core NP slots, PP slots or object of postposition slots. They tend to occur first in a clause, as with e-ra ‘1SG-ERG’ in (4.29). Note however that this is not an obligation; see for example tu-ke ‘3SG-FM’ in clause final position in (4.17). Example (4.29) also illustrates the genitive pronoun e-kwe ‘1SG-GEN’.

‘I do not know my father.’ nk011

2 — bound pronouns are enclitics in second position in main clauses. They undergo a number of morphological modifications not attested with independent pronouns. They only occur in certain types of main clauses. They can cooccur with an independent pronoun or an NP that has the same function in the same clause. An illustrative example is the sequence =tu-ra =Ø in (4.30).

‘That’s what the giant anteater did to me (he poked me with his trunk) .’ ba098

In this study, bound pronouns, together with second position enclitic particles (§4.5.5), are separated from their host, and from each other when more than one co-occur, by a space. This is intended to distinguish them from clitics that do not occur in second position, such as case markers, phrasal particles, etc. — those are written as attached immediately to their host and to each other.
The additional independent pronominal-like morphemes ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘3PL’ are used very frequently but are not fully understood yet. They have not been included in the tables of pronouns above. These forms appear to be peripheral elements. They are not independent pronouns because they do not fill NP slots. They are not bound pronouns because they are not enclitics in second position and can occur in any type of clause. They refer to S/CS or O arguments. Examples can be seen in (4.79a), which shows ekatse ‘DL’ referring to the CS argument, (4.1b), which shows ekana ‘3PL’ referring to the S argument, and (4.31), which shows ekana ‘3PL’ referring to the O argument.

4.5.3. Demonstratives
Cavineña has two types of demonstratives: (1) adverbial demonstratives6 and (2) pointing demonstratives — note that Cavineña does not have specific nominal demonstratives. Both types encode three degrees of distance ‘near’ vs. ‘mid’ vs. ‘far’. There are three sets of adverbial demonstratives (locative, general locative and perlative) and one set of pointing demonstratives. They are listed in Table 4.5.

Pointing

Adverbial demonstratives and pointing demonstratives differ in the following ways:

1 — an adverbial demonstrative can be used instead of a locative, a general locative or a perlative postpositional phrase and is always anaphoric. In (4.32), for example, the locative postpositional phrase AltoIvón=ju ‘Alto.Ivón=LOC’, in the first sentence, is replaced by the adverbial demonstrative tu-wa ‘there-LOC’, in the second sentence.

‘(One day the missionary sent me to the Chácobo village. He said to me:) “Go to Alto Ivón! Go and meet (lit. see) the Chácobo people there!”’ pa002

2 — pointing demonstratives do not substitute for any particular postpositional phrase. They are not used anaphorically and require a pointing gesture (whereas a pointing gesture is optional with adverbial demonstratives). An example is given in (4.33).

6 The term ‘adverbial demonstrative’ is taken from Dixon (2003b).

Demonstratives are discussed in §15.7 (adverbial demonstratives) and §15.8 (pointing demonstratives).

4.5.4. Content question words

Cavineña has a number of special words used in content questions. These words can also be used in non-interrogative clauses with an indefinite sense, or within relative clauses, encoding the argument that is common between the relative clause and the main clause.
There are words used for questioning particular oblique phrases, listed in (4.34a). There are also words used for questioning particular subordinate clauses, listed in (4.34b).

‘INT:REASON’ ‘INT:SIMLR’ ‘INT=LIG’

(reason clauses; §19.3) (‘similarity’ clause; §19.4) (relative clause; §13.6 and Chapter 20)

Note that content questions also make use of the interrogative noun ai ‘INT’, the interrogative prefix eje- ‘INT’ (on predicative adjectives) and the interrogative non-inflecting verb a(i) ju- ‘do what’. A discussion on interrogative clauses is provided in §4.6.5 below.

4.5.5. Particles
Cavineña has a closed class of particles. Particles are bare roots which cannot take affixes or be reduplicated. There are four distinct subclasses of particles which differ in their degree of phonological and structural independence:

82 4. Grammatical overview

1 — independent particles have the highest degree of freedom. They form independent phonological words which can occur anywhere in any type of clause. The full list of independent particles is given in Table 4.6.

See also an example of amena ‘BM’ in (4.17). 2 — first position particles also form independent phonological words but have distributional restrictions. They can only occur in main clauses (not in subordinate clauses) and have to occur in first position. First position particles are listed exhaustively in Table 4.7.

3 — second position particles do not form independent phonological words. They are enclitics to the last phonological word of the first immediate constituent of a main clause, such as an NP, a PP, the predicate, an independent or a first position particle, an adverbial clause, etc. Second position particles are listed exhaustively in Table 4.8, sorted by semantic field.
Examples of second position particles can be seen with =shana ‘PITY’ in (4.21) and =pa ‘REP’ in both (4.23) and (4.26).

4 — phrasal particles do not form independent phonological words either. All phrasal particles but one, ni= ‘NOT.EVEN’, are enclitics to the last phonological word of a phrase, such as an NP, a PP, the predicate, an independent or a first position particle, an adverbial clause, etc. The particle ni= ‘NOT.EVEN’ is a proclitic which is attached to the first phonological word of a phrase. Phrasal particles can occur in any type of clause. They are listed exhaustively in Table 4.9.
Examples of phrasal particles can be seen with =dya ‘FOC’ in both (4.18) and (4.33), =tere ‘ONLY’ in (4.23), and =ama in (4.29). Second position particles, together with bound pronouns, are written with an equal sign (‘=’) to indicate their clitic phonological status, and are separated from their host, and from each other when more than one co-occur, by a space. See, for example, the second position particle =pa ‘REP’ and the bound pronoun =tu ‘3SG(-FM)’ in (4.37) below. Phrasal particles are also written with an equal sign (‘=’). However, unlike second position particles and bound pronouns, they are written as attached immediately to their host and to each other. See for example =kwita ‘RESTR’ in (4.37).

Independent, first position and second position particles are discussed in Chapter 16. Phrasal particles are discussed in Chapter 17.

4.5.6. Subordinate clause markers
Subordinate clause markers are very similar to postpositions. They form a closed class of bare roots which mark a constituent and relate it to another (superordinate) constituent. However, subordinate clause markers mark clauses while postpositions mark NPs. Subordinate clause markers are used to mark three different types of clauses:

86 4. Grammatical overview

1 — non-finite adverbial clauses (Chapter 18), which they relate to a controlling clause; 2 — finite adverbial clauses (Chapter 19), which they also relate to a controlling clause; 3 — relative clauses (Chapter 20), which they relate to the head of an NP.

The full list of subordinate clause markers is given in (4.38).

‘DS’ ‘REASON’ ‘SIMLR’ ‘COND’ ‘THANKS.TO’ ‘EVEN.THOUGH’
‘WHILE’

c. relative clause

=ke

‘LIG’

Most subordinate clause markers are enclitics. They are attached to the last phonological word of the clause that they are marking, as with =tibu ‘REASON’ in (4.39).

4.5.7. Interjections

Interjections are bare roots which never take affixes and are never reduplicated. They behave like a whole utterance in one word. Interjections have not been studied in depth. They are only briefly discussed here and not elsewhere.
Interjections encode a number of different meanings listed and glossed in (4.41).

(4.41) a. Speaker attitude/emotion

achí akwe juj juwaaba pa pajuani pusi ujepa

‘speaker feels disgusted’ ‘speaker feels sorry’ ‘speaker feels feels impressed’ ‘speaker does not know’ ‘speaker feels impressed’ ‘speaker disagrees’ ‘speaker is amused’ ‘speaker is angry’

d. Imperative

kwii

‘speaker orders the hearer to go first’

juwejuwe ‘speaker orders the hearer to hurry up’

e. Signals

juj

‘signal uttered when approaching a house for a visit’

tsujj

‘signal uttered when discovering enemies nearby’

The interjection pa ‘speaker impressed’ is illustrated in (4.42).

(4.42)

Pa!

Kasa-u-siCC!

INTERJ strong-ASF-AUGM

‘Wow! (Those traditional canoes were) very strong! (Uttered by Antonio Yubanera when hearing that the canoes Ventura Mayo used to build could contain up to six people.)’ ab203

A number of interjections are phonologically irregular. For example, the interjection achí ‘speaker feels disgusted’ has a low-pitch-high-pitch contour; if it were regular, it would have the high-pitch-low-pitch contour normally applied to two syllable words (see §2.7). The interjection pa and the short form of the interjection a(a) ‘hearer follows/understands speaker’ have only one syllable and still form one independent phonological word; if these were regular, they would have at least two syllables since an independent phonological word in Cavineña has a minimum of two syllables (see §3.1.2). The two interjections juj ‘signal uttered when approaching a house for a visit’ and tsujj ‘signal uttered when discovering enemies nearby’ have closed syllables; if they were regular, they should have open syllables (see §2.3).
A number of interjections are borrowed from Spanish and are used with the same meanings. The interjections in (4.43a) and (4.43b) have been fully integrated into the Cavineña phonological system. The interjections in (4.43c) have not, and were probably borrowed more recently.

c. Speaker attitude

caramba ‘speaker feels concerned’

There used to be a traditional way of greeting but it is not used anymore. According to Alfredo Tavo, greeting was done by uttering a time of day independent particle such as barepatya ‘at midday’, barepatyawesuta ‘in the afternoon’, metapatya ‘at midnight’, etc. — see the full list in §4.5.5. These particles could either be used as one word utterances, or be followed either by the first person dual pronoun yatse ‘1DL’ (if the speaker was greeting only one person) or first person plural ekwana ‘1PL’ (if the speaker was greeting more than one person).

4.5.8. Onomatopoeias
Onomatopoeias are quite similar to interjections in that they are bare roots which do not take any affixes or cannot be reduplicated. They also constitute a full sentence by themselves. But unlike interjections, onomatopoeias do not express any other meaning than the entity associated with the cry or sound they are used to depict. Onomatopoeias have not been fully studied. They are briefly illustrated in this section and not elsewhere.
Onomatopoeias can be used to refer to the cries of birds, as in (4.44a), or the cries of various mammals in (4.44b).

7 W. Adelaar (p.c.) suggests that Cavineña actually borrowed the Quechuanized version of this Spanish expression (or the related expression Dios se lo pagará! ‘God will pay you for it’), in the form of yusulpay(ki).

Onomatopoeias are phonologically even more abnormal than interjections. A large number end with a closed syllable, typically with fricative codas sh or j. These fricatives are also often lengthened — this is indicated here by doubling the consonant. Most onomatopoeias, even though they form an independent phonological word, have only one syllable.
Syntactically, an onomatopoeia, similarly to an interjection, makes up a whole utterance. This is illustrated in (4.46). The onomatopoeia tujj occurs between two sentences; an utterance-final contour and a pause clearly separate tujj from both era in the preceding sentence and mare-kware in the following one.

4.6. Main clause structure

Declarative affirmative verbal main clauses are the most frequently used in texts. They will therefore be referred to as basic. Basic clause structure is presented in §4.6.1 and is followed by a discussion of core grammatical functions (§4.6.2). The next sections discuss non-basic clauses which differ to some degree from basic clauses: copula clauses (§4.6.3), imperative and hortative clauses (§4.6.4), interrogative clauses (§4.6.5) and negative clauses (§4.6.6).

4.6.1. Basic clause structure

Unlike the constituents of the predicate and the NP, most constituents of a basic
clause are freely ordered. In a basic transitive clause, for example, the position
of the two core NPs (or independent pronouns), when expressed, does not have any impact on their semantic role interpretation, as shown by comparing (4.47) and (4.48a-d):8

The only constituents that have a fixed position in basic clauses are the first position particles (see §4.5.5) and the second position clitics (see §4.5.2 for second position bound pronouns and §4.5.5 for second position particles).
Additional characteristics of the basic clause structure are as follows:

1 — a basic clause must contain minimally (1) a predicate and (2) a mark of each core participant — there is one exception: third person singular participants do not need to be marked; see §15.3 for a full discussion of participant encoding in Cavineña; 2 — interjections and onomatopoeias are not part of clause structure but make up a full main clause by themselves; 3 — a basic clause appears to be equal to a sentence in Cavineña. I could not identify any structure that would be used to coordinate two main clauses (into a sentence). In other words, all the clause combination processes in Cavineña involve subordinating constructions; 4 — a basic clause/sentence normally matches the utterance prosodic unit (§2.8.1). Recall that the end of an utterance is signaled by low (as opposed to mid) pitch on the last two syllables of the last phonological word.

4.6.2. S, A and O grammatical functions
Cavineña encodes the core arguments S (subject of an intransitive clause), A and O (subject and object of a transitive clause) by a system of case-marking. Recall that there is no marking of arguments in the predicate and that NP/independent pronouns that refer to core arguments are free to occur in any position in a clause.
The case-marking follows an ergative/absolutive pattern. An NP in A function receives the ergative postposition =ra ‘ERG’. See examples (4.12a), (4.13), (4.15), (4.17) and (4.30). A pronoun in A function, whether independent or bound, receives a suffix -ra ‘ERG’. Examples with independent pronouns in A

4.6 Main clause structure 93

function can be seen in (4.2b), (4.6), (4.29) and (4.46). Examples of bound pronouns in A function can be seen in (4.16), (4.30) and (4.39). The suffix -ra
‘ERG’ within bound pronouns undergoes a rule of deletion when the bound pro-
noun occurs last in the second position clitic sequence, as in (4.49a), unless the bound pronoun is also last in the sentence, as in (4.49b):9

b. Ara-wana-wa=ama=dya =tatse-raA. eat-ADVERS-PERF=NEG=FOC =3DL-ERG
‘They (dl) did not eat it (the meat) (because it was not cooked).’ hm102

An NP in S or O function is unmarked for case. Examples showing NPs in S function are in (4.2c), (4.3b) and (4.27), and NPs in O function are in (4.5), (4.12a) and (4.29). A pronoun in S or O function, whether independent or bound, is equally unmarked for case. Singular (but not non-singular) pronouns marking S and O have a formative -ke which undergoes a rule of deletion when the bound pronoun occurs last in the second position clitic sequence, as in (4.39) (repeated), unless the bound pronoun is also last in the sentence, as in (4.50). Note that this is the same rule that applies to the ergative suffix -ra ‘ERG’ of bound pronouns in A function.

9 Note that in their earlier work on Cavineña, Camp and Liccardi (1977, 1983, 1989) and Camp (1985) did not distinguish between independent and bound pronouns, nor did they identify the morpho-phonological nature of the rule that deletes the suffix -ra (and the suffixe -ke; see below). This resulted in the misconception, formulated by Camp (1985), and often cited in the literature (e.g., Dixon 1994: 106-7, Aikhenvald and Dixon 1999: 366-7, Adelaar with Muysken 2004: 421-422), that there was a split ergative pattern in Cavineña. As the present work will make clear, there is no reason to analyze the Cavineña argument coding system in such terms. See also Guillaume (2006a, forthcoming-b) for a detailed reevaluation of Camp’s (1985) analysis.

Although Cavineña has a consistent ergative pattern at the morphological (‘coding’) level, this ceases to be the case at the syntactic (‘behavior-andcontrol’) level. Here, S and A grammatical functions are treated as a single subject grammatical relation. This can be observed in co-reference restrictions between certain subordinate clauses and their controlling clause.

4.6.3. Copula clauses

Copula clauses have two core arguments, a copula subject (CS) and a copula complement (CC), and a copula predicate, which have the following morphosyntactic properties:

1 — the copula subject (CS) is encoded identically to the subject of an intransitive clause (S). The CS can be a full NP or an independent pronoun and/or a bound pronoun. These are all unmarked for case. Illustrative examples of CS NPs are given in (4.9a), (4.20), (4.21) and (4.51), of CS independent pronouns in (4.54), and of CS bound pronouns in (4.10).

A CS is treated similarly to an S with respect to the co-reference restrictions that hold between certain subordinate clauses and their controlling clause (§4.7).
Although S and CS are identical grammatical functions in Cavineña, for clarity I will nevertheless continue to code copula subjects as CS (not S) in the examples.

4.6 Main clause structure 95

2 — the copula predicate can only be headed by the verb ju- ‘be’; that is, there are no other copula verbs in Cavineña. This verb is similar to any (monosyllabic)10 intransitive verb and the intransitive auxiliary verb ju- ‘be’ (to which it is homophonous) in its morphological (derivational and inflectional) possibilities. Examples showing the copula predicate with inflectional affixes are given in (4.52).

3 — the copula complement almost always precedes the copula predicate when the copula predicate is present; see below for a discussion of the omission of the CP. This can be seen in all examples provided in this chapter, except for (4.54) which is an exception.

The copula complement resembles an absolutive (i.e., a S/CS or an O) argument in that it is unmarked for case but there are many differences. Unlike absolutive arguments, the CC cannot be represented by a bound pronoun (in second position), cannot be omitted and (as noted) normally occurs preposed to the copula predicate.
The CC can be a predicative adjective, whether a da-adjective or an independent adjective, as in the preceding examples; note that in Cavineña, the CC cannot be an attributive adjective. The CC can also be an NP, as in (4.55), where it expresses the semantic relation of identity, in (4.56), where it manifests the the semantic relation of equation, and in (4.57) where it conveys the semantic relation of naming.

Copula clauses are morpho-syntactically very similar to intransitive basic clauses based on (intransitive) non-inflecting verbs. The copula predicate is homophonous with the intransitive auxiliary. Both have the same morphological possibilities. The CC of a copula clause precedes the copula predicate, similarly to the non-inflecting component of a non-inflecting verb which must precede its auxiliary. There are however (at least) two differences which make the two constructions different:

1 — only copula clauses can have an NP or PP as CC; 2 — the copula predicate can be omitted (while the predicate of an intransitive basic clause cannot). The main function of the copula predicate is to carry verbal affixes. Speakers very often leave out the copula predicate when they do not judge it necessary to express the verbal categories encoded by these affixes. This happens for example in generic statements, as in (4.55b), or when the verbal categories are understood from either the textual context, as in (4.59), where the sentence comes within a text that only refers to remote past, or the physical/visual context, as in (4.56), where the speaker is pointing to the referent of the CS.

4.6.4. Imperative and hortative clauses

Clauses used for commands directed to a second or a first person, i.e., clauses with verbs inflected with imperative or hortative inflectional affixes, can be analysed as a different clause type on the basis that their core arguments cannot be represented by bound pronouns.
In imperative and hortative clauses, core arguments can be encoded by NPs or independent pronouns or not overtly encoded at all, but can never be encoded by bound pronouns.
Examples showing the expression of the S, A and O arguments by NPs or independent pronouns in imperative clauses can be seen in the second sentence of (4.60a) (S argument), (4.60b) (A argument) and the repeated example (4.32) (O argument).

‘(One day the missionary sent me to the Chácobo village. He said to me:) “Go to Alto Ivón! Go and meet (lit. see) the Chácobo people there!”’ pa002

Examples showing the absence of encoding of the core arguments in imperative clauses can be seen in the first sentences of both (4.60a) and (4.32) (S argument), and the second sentence of (4.32) (A argument) and (4.60b) (O argument).
The S, A and O core arguments of imperative and hortative clauses cannot be expressed by bound pronouns. In (4.60a), for example, it is not possible to use the second person singular bound pronoun =mi(-ke) ‘2SG-FM’. Similarly, in (4.32) and (4.60b), it is not possible to use the second person singular bound pronoun =mi(-ra) ‘2SG-ERG’.

4.6 Main clause structure 99

Hortative clauses have the same properties as imperative clauses. Core arguments can be overtly expressed by NPs or independent pronouns or not overtly expressed at all, but never expressed by bound pronouns. This is briefly illustrated in (4.61). In the first sentence of (4.61a) the S is encoded by an independent pronoun, while in the second sentence the O is encoded by a full NP. In (4.61b), the S argument is not expressed.

b. Ne-diru-nuka,

HORT.DL-go-REITR grandchild

‘Let’s go back, Grandchild!’ ps014

In the first sentence of (4.61a) and in (4.61b), it is not possible to have the first person dual bound pronoun encoding the S function, i.e., =yatse. In the second sentence of (4.61a), it is not possible to have the first person dual bound pronoun encoding the A function, i.e., yatse(-ra).
Clauses used for commands directed to a third person, i.e., clauses with verbs inflected with jussive inflectional affixes, do allow bound pronouns and are therefore not treated as a different clause type from basic main clauses in Cavineña. Examples of jussive clauses with third person bound pronouns are given in (4.62).

100 4. Grammatical overview
See also a bound pronoun encoding an A argument in a jussive clause in ‘he has to drink it with water’ in (T1.107).
At least one particle, ita ‘ATT.GETTER’, can only be used in imperative or hortative clauses — this particle is used to make unexpected but polite commands/requests (see §16.2.3). See an example in (4.36).
Note that imperative and hortative clauses (like interrogative clauses; §4.6.5) have the same intonation contour as basic clauses in Cavineña.

4.6.5. Interrogative clauses

Interrogative clauses in Cavineña are very similar to basic clauses, whether they are used to question content or polarity. One striking feature of interrogative clauses is that they do not appear to have any specific interrogative intonation,11 or constituent order (but see footnote 8), or any obligatory marking that would distinguish these clauses from statements; there are question words but these can always be used with an indefinite sense (see §4.5.4).
A polar question clause is identical to a statement clause, unless the (optional) first particle are ‘QUEST’ is used (see below). Whether a particular clause is a statement or a polar question is retrieved from the context.
Content questions are more easily identifiable as they always contain special question morphemes. These morphemes can be (1) the interrogative (independent) noun ai ‘INT’, which is used to substitute a noun within an NP and means ‘who’ or ‘what’, (2) the special content question words, which are used to substitute oblique phrases or subordinate clauses and which have meanings such as ‘where’, ‘when’, ‘how’, ‘which’, etc., (3) the interrogative prefix eje- ‘INT’, which means ‘how (big, long, strong, etc.)’) on da-adjectives, or (4) the interrogative non-inflecting verb a(i) ju- ‘do what’. I briefly illustrate each type of question morpheme below.
The question word ai ‘INT’ is a straightforward independent noun. It can fill any position an independent noun can fill. It is used to question the head of an A NP in (4.12a), the head of an O NP head in (4.70), and the head of an associative oblique NP head in (4.63).

Interrogative clauses have the following morpho-syntactic properties:

1 — content question morphemes come first in the clause; 2 — interrogative clauses, unlike imperative and hortative clauses, can have their core arguments (S/CS, A and O) and/or a dative oblique expressed by bound pronouns. An example showing a sequence of O and A bound pronouns in a content question is given in (4.70).

This particle can be attached to (and modify) any immediate constituent of a clause: the predicate, as in (4.12a), (4.29) and (4.49b), a predicative adjective, as in (4.73a), a core NP, as in (4.73b), a postpositional phrase, as in (4.73c), or a subordinate clause, as in (4.73d).

4.7 Dependent clauses 105
Negative clauses are not significantly different from affirmative clauses. Negation does not appear to have any effect on constituent order, on the use of other grammatical categories, such as verbal affixes,12 particles, etc., and on the encoding of arguments. Notably, arguments of negative clauses can be expressed by bound pronouns; see for example (4.73b) and (4.73d).
4.7. Dependent clauses
Cavineña has three types of dependent clauses, all of which are subordinate: (1) non-finite adverbial clauses (Chapter 18), finite adverbial clauses (Chapter 19), and relative clauses (§13.6 and Chapter 20). Cavineña does not have complement clauses, only complementation strategies. Cavineña does not have coordinate clauses either.
The three types of subordinate clauses are marked by dependency markers. Only one dependency marker, -(a)tsu ‘SS’, is a (verbal) affix (used in slot K of predicate structure; §4.2.1). The remaining dependency markers are enclitics or separate phonological words that belong to the word class of subordinate clause marker; see full list in §4.5.6).
Non-finite adverbial clauses have a verb without a TAM inflectional affix. There are five types of non-finite adverbial clauses:
1 — same-subject temporal clause, marked by -(a)tsu ‘SS’ (§18.2); 2 — general purpose clause, marked by =ishu ‘PURP.GNL’ (§18.3); 3 — purpose of motion clause, marked by =ra ‘PURP.MOT’ (§18.4); 4 — cause clause, marked by =ra ‘CAUSE’ (§18.5.1); 5 — ‘just before’ clause, marked by =wie ‘JUST.BEFORE’ (§18.5.2).
Finite adverbial clauses have a verb obligatorily inflected with a TAM inflectional affix. There are six types of finite adverbial clauses:
1 — different-subject temporal clause, marked by =ju ‘DS’ (§19.2); 2 — reason clause, marked by =tibu ‘REASON’ (§19.3); 3 — similarity clause, marked by =bucha, =bae or =jiu ‘SIMLR’ (§19.4); 4 — conditional clause, marked by =ke juatsu ‘COND’ (§19.5); 5 — ‘thanks to’ clause, marked by =ademe ‘THANKS.TO’ (§19.6.1); 6 — concessive clause, marked by either majaka or =amabucha ‘EVEN.THOUGH’ (§19.6.2).
12 An exception to this statement would be the alternation between the two variants of the Aktionsart suffix meaning ‘almost’: -jeri (when used within an affirmative predicate) / -neri (when used within a negative predicate); see full details in §7.1.3.

106 4. Grammatical overview

Cavineña has arguably a ‘switch-reference’ system13 involving the following two types of subordinate clauses:

1 — same-subject temporal clauses, as their name indicates, obligatorily have their subject, either S/CS or A, co-referential with the subject, either S/CS or A, of their controlling clause (see §18.2). Examples are given in (4.16), (4.78a) and (4.79a); 2 — different-subject temporal clauses, as their name also indicates, obligatorily have their subject, either S/CS or A, non-coreferential with the subject, either S/CS or A, of their controlling clause (see §19.2). Examples are given in (4.7), (4.37), (4.78b) and (4.79b).

13 It is debatable to call this pair of clauses a ‘switch-reference’ system since, structurally, they belong to two distinct clause types. See discusion in §19.2.3.

4.8 Coordination 107

4.8. Coordination

Coordination structures have not been fully investigated yet and require additional study. Coordination in Cavineña can be realized by simple apposition of two constituents of the same type and in the same function, as in (4.80a), illustrating conjunction, and (4.80b), illustrating disjunction.

NOT.EVEN=fish NOT.EVEN=NPF-meat

‘They say that they really don’t have any fish or meat (lit. neither any fish nor any meat exist at all to them).’ ka162

Coordination can also be realized by way of coordinators. There are two coordinators: jadya ‘and’, used for conjunction (§4.8.1), and jadyaamajuatsu ‘or’, used for disjunction (§4.8.2). Note that the terminology used while discussing coordination is taken from Haspelmath (2000). Cavineña coordinators can coordinate words, phrases and subordinate clauses. They cannot be used to coordinate main clauses.

4.8.1. Conjunction
Conjunction, i.e., ‘and’-coordination, is realized by the coordinator jadya ‘and’. Note that in a few examples, jadya also expresses disjunction, i.e., ‘or’-coordination. This morpheme is homophonous with and probably historically related to the independent particle jadya ‘thus’ (§4.5.5).
Jadya can be used to coordinate two or more coordinands. It occurs only once per coordination structure and is postposed to the last coordinand; for example, with three coordinands A, B and C, we have A B C jadya.
Coordinated S NPs are illustrated in (4.81).

Coordination of verbs requires bare verbal stems; that is, inflected verbs cannot be coordinated. The verbs must have the same transitivity value and an auxiliary which matches the transitivity of the coordinated verbs, i.e., either

intransitive ju- ‘be’ or transitive a- ‘affect’. This is illustrated in (4.86) with coordination of four transitive verbs.

4.8.2. Disjunction

Disjunction, i.e., ‘or’-coordination, in Cavineña is normally realized by the word jadyaamajuatsu ‘or’ which comes from the lexicalization of the samesubject temporal clause (§18.2) jadya=ama ju-atsu ‘thus=NEG be-SS’ (lit. being not thus). In fast speech, jadyaamajuatsu is often shortened to jadyamajuatsu, jadyamaatsu or even amaatsu. Jadyaamajuatsu is only found coordinating two coordinands in the data and it occurs in between; more work is needed to determine whether more than two coordinands can be involved.
Jadyaamajuatsu is illustrated combining various types of coordinands in (4.88).

Chapter 5 Predicate structure — an overview
This chapter is a general introduction to the structure of the predicate, one of the most complex areas of Cavineña grammar. The following five chapters deal in detail with specific topics: inflectional morphology (Chapter 6), Aktionsart suffixes (Chapter 7), valency-changing mechanisms (Chapter 8), postural and directional suffixes (Chapter 9) and auxiliary-triggering processes (Chapter 10).
In Cavineña, the predicate must be distinguished from the verb itself. Both structures match when the predicate is simple — both predicate and verb consist of one grammatical and phonological word. But the two structures do not match when the predicate is complex — the predicate consists of more than one grammatical and phonological word and the verb is only one among these predicate components.1 The structure of the predicate consists of 11 slots (A to K). It is discussed in §5.1.
The predicate can only be headed by a verb. There are two types of verbs: inflecting verbs, which take affixes, and non-inflecting verbs, which do not; the latter require an auxiliary for this purpose. Inflecting verbs are discussed in §5.2. Non-inflecting verbs are discussed in §5.3.
The non-inflecting component of a complex predicate can always be separated from the inflecting component (i.e., the auxiliary). In §5.4, I discuss why I chose to treat both components as a single (although complex) predicate as opposed to possible alternative analyses.
Verbs can undergo various processes of reduplication. These processes are introduced in §5.5.
5.1. Structure of the predicate
The predicate in Cavineña can be described in terms of 11 slots. There is one slot for a verb root, one for an auxiliary, slots for (phonologically and grammatically) independent modifiers (preverbal and postverbal), two prefix slots and four suffix slots (one of which — slot H — can be filled by up to three cooccurring suffixes). A number of predicate modifiers are discontinuous and occupy more than one slot.
The predicate structure can be diagrammed as follows (repeated from §4.2.1; obligatory components are in boldface).
1 See Dixon (2003a: 141ff.) for a discussion of the notions of verb vs. predicate in different languages.

114 5. Predicate structure — an overview

Slot A: Slot B: Slot C: Slot D: Slot E: Slot F: Slot G: Slot H: Slot I: Slot J: Slot K:

Inflectional prefix Preverbal modifier Valency-changing prefix Verb root Auxiliary Postural or directional suffix Valency-changing suffixes Aktionsart suffixes Mode suffix Postverbal modifier Inflectional suffix

In addition to the 11 slots, a number of clitics (phrasal particles) can be attached to the predicate. These include the negative particle =ama ‘NEG’, the aspectual particle =jari ‘STILL’ and the focus particle =dya ‘FOC’ (see Chapter 17). These particles are not analyzed as part of the predicate structure per se because they can normally occur on other types of constituents (NPs, PPs, copula complements, etc.).
Note that there are no pronominal markers in the Cavineña predicate. Cavineña does have bound pronouns but these occur in second position in a clause (phonologically bound to the last phonological word of the first immediate constituent of a main clause; §15.2).
In addition there are various reduplication processes. These are discussed independently in §5.5 below.

5.1.1. Slots A/K: inflectional affixes
The affixes that go into slots A/K (i.e., into slot A and/or slot K) are obligatory and mutually exclusive. We can distinguish between five different sets of inflectional affixes:
1 — tense-aspect-modality (TAM) (used in declarative and interrogative mood) 2 — imperative (command addressed to a second person) 3 — hortative (command addressed to a first person) 4 — jussive (command addressed to a third person) 5 — clause linker suffix -(a)tsu that yields a subordinate temporal clause

5.1 Structure of the predicate 115

The full list of inflectional affixes is provided in Table 5.1.

TAM and command inflections are discussed in detail in Chapter 6. The last inflectional morpheme is the suffix -(a)tsu ‘SS’. This suffix yields a subordinate clause which obligatorily has the same subject (either S/CS or A) as the subject (either S/CS or A) of the main verb. The meaning encoded by the suffix -(a)tsu is most often temporal as in (5.2a) but can also be adverbial (modifying) as in (5.2b).

5.1.2. Slot B: preverbal modifiers
Slot B is associated with auxiliary-triggering processes. A verbal affix cannot be attached to the verb once an element occurs in slot B. Verbal affixes can still be used but they are then carried by an auxiliary.

5.1 Structure of the predicate 117
Three types of elements can go into slot B:
1 — the four phonologically independent markers nere ‘VIGOROUSLY’, yume ‘IMMEDIATELY’, riya ‘STARTLING’ and pana ‘PROPERLY’ (§10.2); 2 — the first part of the discontinuous marker jadya/ejebucha …-e ‘MAN’ (the second part, the suffix -e, goes into slot I) (§10.3); 3 — an ‘incorporated’ element (e.g., an independent particle or a postpositional phrase) that accompanies a Ø-marked auxiliary-triggering process (§10.5).

5.1.3. Slots C/G: valency-changing affixes

Cavineña has four valency-changing mechanisms. Three of these mechanisms are realized by affixes that go into slot C/G (i.e., into slot C and/or slot G) of the predicate. They are listed in Table 5.2. The fourth mechanism consists of an exchange of auxiliaries.

Passive Reflexive

Valency reducing -ta(na) k(a)-…-ti

Valency increasing

Causative

-sha/-mere/-kere

These affixes can apply equally to inflecting and non-inflecting verbs. The causative is noteworthy in having three forms. The form -sha can only be applied to intransitive verbs and the form -mere to transitive verbs. The form -kere can apply to both intransitive and transitive verbs but has a slightly different meaning, encoding the involvement of the causer in the activity. Auxiliaries have suppletive causativized forms: amere- (be+CAUS) (corresponding to ungrammatical *ju-sha-) and akere- (be+CAUS.INVLT) (corresponding to ungrammatical *ju-kere). Valency-changing affixes fill slot C/G of the predicate. Example (5.3) shows the verb ani- ‘sit’ followed by a directional suffix (slot F) followed by the causative marker -sha (slot G) followed by the obligatory inflectional suffix -wa (slot K).

118 5. Predicate structure — an overview
A full discussion of valency-changing mechanisms is given in Chapter 8. This chapter also includes a discussion of two antipassive derivations. Antipassive derivation is carried out by reduplicating the verb root if the verb is inflecting (see §5.5 on the various reduplication processes that can be applied to a verb), or by exchanging the transitive auxiliary (a- ‘affect’) for the intransitive auxiliary (ju- ‘be’) if the verb is non-inflecting.

5.1.4. Slot D: verb root

Slot D is filled by the predicate head which can only be a verb. It can be (1) an inflecting verb which directly takes affixes or (2) a non-inflecting verb which cannot carry an affix but instead requires an auxiliary in slot E which takes the affixes. Similarly to slots A/K (for inflectional affixes), slot D is obligatorily filled.
We can contrast the intransitive inflecting verb ani- ‘sit’ in (5.4a) with the intransitive non-inflecting verb wikamutya ju- ‘to fish’ in (5.4b).

Verbs are discussed in detail in §5.2 (inflecting verbs) and §5.3 (noninflecting verbs) below.

5.1.5. Slot E: auxiliary
An auxiliary is obligatory when the head of the predicate (slot D) is a noninflecting verb, whether a basic non-inflecting verb or a derived non-inflecting verb (i.e., a verb which has undergone an auxiliary-triggering process).
There are two auxiliaries: ju- ‘be’ and a- ‘affect’. They have two main functions: (1) carrying affixes and (2) marking transitivity. As affix-carriers, ju- and a- are required by non-inflecting verbs (basic or derived). As transitivity markers, ju- marks an intransitive predicate, as in (5.4b), while a- marks a transitive one, as in (5.5b). Exchanging the transitive auxiliary for the intransitive auxiliary has an antipassive function — a full discussion is provided in §8.3.2. Note that the reverse, exchanging the intransitive auxiliary for the transitive auxiliary, is not grammatical.

5.1.6. Slot F: postural and directional suffixes

There are seven postural and directional suffixes, listed in Table 5.3. These suffixes may not be combined; that is, they are mutually exclusive.

Postural and directional suffixes have strong distributional restrictions, only occurring with a limited number of verbs. Example (5.6) shows the directional -tsura ‘GO.UP’ following the verb root iya- ‘put’ (slot D) and followed by the

A full discussion of postural and directional suffixes is in Chapter 9.

5.1.7. Slot H: Aktionsart suffixes

Aktionsart suffixes provide optional modification of the verb in much the same way that adverbs or adverbial clauses modify a verb or predicate in other languages.2 These suffixes are very rich semantically and often express notions that are not commonly found in the morphology of the verb in other languages, particularly European languages. For example, there is a series of suffixes that encode the time of the day an action is performed (e.g., -wekaka ‘the action is performed at dawn’, -apuna ‘the action is performed at dusk’, etc.).
There are about 30 Aktionsart suffixes. According to their semantics and distribution (i.e., co-occurrence possibilities), we can sort them into four broad groups. Table 5.4 lists all suffixes with their glosses (the different paradigms are separated by a blank line).
Example (5.7) shows a predicate with a directional suffix (slot F), a valency-changing circumfix (slot C/G), an Aktionsart suffix (slot H), and an obligatory inflectional suffix (slot K).

Aktionsart suffixes can be organized in a number of paradigms. One Aktionsart suffix from one paradigm can co-occur with another (or two other) Aktionsart suffix(es) from another paradigm. This is illustrated with -wekaka ‘AT.DOWN’ and -nuka ‘REITR’ in (5.8a), and -jaka ‘STOP’ with -diru ‘GO.PERM’ in (5.8b).

5.1.8. Slot I: mode markers

Similarly to slot B (and slot J; see below), slot I is associated with auxiliarytriggering processes. While slot B (as well as slot J) is filled by phonologically independent elements, slot I is filled by suffixes.
Two types of markers go into slot I:

1 — the five auxiliary-triggering suffixes -kara/-karama ‘DESID’, -metse ‘FIRST’, -jakama ‘CEASELESSLY’, -bawe/-baekwa ‘ALWS’ and -ki/-aki ‘TYPICAL’ (§10.1); 2 — the second (suffix) parts of the discontinuous markers jadya …-e ‘MAN’ and ejebucha …-e ‘MAN.INT’; the first parts go into slot B (§10.3).

Example (5.9) shows the verb maju- ‘die’ followed by an Aktionsart suffix (slot H), then preceded-and-followed by the discontinuous marker jadya …-e ‘MAN’, and finally followed by an (obligatory) inflectional marker borne by an auxiliary.

5.2 Inflecting verbs 123
5.1.9. Slot J: postverbal modifiers
Similarly to slots B and I, slot J is associated with auxiliary-triggering processes, and, similarly to slot B markers, slot J markers consist of phonologically independent morphemes. Two types of elements can go into slot J:
1 — a member of a set of quantifier markers that are used to specify the number of times an event is performed: pidya ‘ONCE’ (corresponding to peadya ‘one’), beta ‘TWICE’ (corresponding to beta ‘two’) and kimisha ‘THREE.TIMES’ (corresponding to kimisha ‘three’). They are discussed in §10.4; 2 — an ‘incorporated’ element (often an independent particle) that accompanies a Ø-marked auxiliary-triggering process. (A symmetrical process happens with slot B; see §5.1.2.) The auxiliary-triggering Ø-marked process with incorporation of elements into slot J (as well as into slot B) is discussed at length in §10.5.

5.2. Inflecting verbs
Inflecting verbs are a clearly defined class. Only inflecting verbs can take affixes from slots A/K, C/G, F, G, H and I — this morphological criterion is enough to distinguish them from non-inflecting verbs and any other word classes. The class of inflecting verbs is open to derivations (from other word classes) but closed to borrowings (unlike non-inflecting verbs).

5.2.1. Basic inflecting verbs

Inflecting verb lexemes are strictly subdivided between intransitive and transitive verbs in Cavineña (except for two ambitransitive verbs; see below). Intransitive verbs can only take one core argument (S), as with tsajaja- ‘run’ in (5.10a), while transitive verbs can only take two core arguments (A and O), as with iye- ‘kill’ in (5.10b).

124 5. Predicate structure — an overview

Subject NPs of transitive verbs are always marked with the ergative enclitic =ra ‘ERG’ (suffix -ra on pronouns) as opposed to subject NPs of intransitive verbs which are always unmarked for case.
The clear-cut distinction between intransitive and transitive verbs is also reflected by the fact that a number of verbal affixes have different forms depending on whether they apply to an intransitive verb or to a transitive verb. This is the case for the causative suffix which has the form -sha when applying to an intransitive verb, and -mere when applying to a transitive verb. Other similar alternations are found with the postural -neti/-nitya ‘STAND’, the directional -bute/-butya ‘GO.DOWN’, and the Aktionsart suffixes -tere/-tirya ‘COMP’ and -jara/-wana ‘ADVERS’. In each set, the first member can only apply to an intransitive verb and the second only to a transitive verb. Any inflecting verb lexeme can only select one of these pairs of suffixes. Finally, a number of verbal suffixes only apply to transitive verbs, as with -tsa ‘COME(O)’ and -dadi ‘GO(O)’.
A count of basic (non-derived) inflecting verbal lexemes reveals that there are four times more transitive verbs (about 280) than intransitive ones (about 70).
Two verbs can be used either intransitively or transitively, following an S=A pattern in both cases: kike-/keke- ‘shout, shout at O’3 and kwina- ‘give birth, give birth to O’. The verb kike-/keke- is illustrated below. In (5.11a), it takes a single core argument, unmarked for case, while in (5.11b) it takes two core arguments, with the subject marked as ergative. In addition, we can note that in (5.11b) kike- takes the suffix -dadi ‘GO(O)’ which, as mentioned earlier, only applies to transitive verbs.

3 The two forms, kike- and keke-, are in free variation; as the examples show, this alternation has nothing to do with transitivity.

5.2 Inflecting verbs 125

The examples in (5.12) show that kike-/keke- can be causativized with either -sha (causative suffix for intransitive verbs) or -mere (causative suffix for transitive verbs).

In addition to the intransitive and the transitive verbs (and the two ambitransitive verbs), there are four attested ditransitive (underived) verbs: baka- ‘ask O for O’, kweja- ‘inform O of O’, seka- ‘take O away from O’ and tya- ‘give O to O’. These verbs have two non-subject arguments that are both unmarked, identically to the O of (mono)transitive verbs. An example of each of these verbs is provided in (5.13).

A few more ditransitive verbs are historically derived from these ditransitive verbs by means of noun incorporation. The process is not productive however (see §5.2.5). The forms attested in the data are as follows. Based on tya- ‘give O to O’, we have bawitya- ‘teach O to O’ with incorporation of the noun bawe ‘customs’ (lit. custom-give O to O), and tsujetya- ‘pay O to O’ with incorporation of the noun -tsuje ‘price, value’ (lit. price-give O to O). Based on baka‘ask O for O’, we have tsujebaka- ‘charge O O’ with incorporation of the same noun -tsuje ‘price, value’ (lit. price-ask O for O’). The verb bawitya- ‘teach’ is illustrated in (5.1a) (repeated).

5.2 Inflecting verbs 127
It has not been possible to single out any grammatical property that would differentiate one non-subject argument from the other with these ditransitive verbs (either basic or derived). The main difficulty comes from the fact that ditransitive verbs are not very numerous in Cavineña. As a result there are very few textual examples of these verbs. However, from the few examples available, it appears that the traditional tests for distinguishing the two non-subject arguments of ditransitive constructions in languages fail in Cavineña: both can be expressed by bound pronouns (§15.2.4); both have the same flexible ordering possibilities; both can be passivized (§8.1); both can enter within a reflexive or reciprocal relation with the agent when the reflexive/reciprocal derivation is applied (see §8.2.4); and both are left unexpressed in all types of valency reducing mechanisms (passive, reflexive/reciprocal and antipassive).4
The majority of inflecting verb roots have two syllables. Ten verbs have only one syllable — five intransitive (je- ‘come’, ju- ‘be’, kwa- ‘go’, pa- ‘cry’ and tsa- ‘laugh’), four transitive (a- ‘affect O’, ba- ‘see O’, be- ‘bring O’ and ryu- ‘comb O’) and one ditransitive (tya- ‘give O to O’). A handful have more than two syllables.
5.2.2. Verbalization of nouns
Two processes of derivation that produce inflecting verbs from nouns have been identified. The first one makes use of a circumfix marker k(a)-…-ti and derives intransitive inflecting verbs. The second makes used of a suffix -ne and derives transitive inflecting verbs. Their level of productivity is unknown. They are described in turn below.
5.2.2.1. Derivation of intransitive verbs from nouns with k(a)-…-ti
A few intransitive inflecting verbs are derived from noun roots, including some lexical loans, with a circumfix k(a)-…-ti.5 The form k-…-ti applies to roots which begin with a vowel, while the form ka-…-ti applies to roots which begin with a consonant. (There two exceptions: ka-atsanaka-ti- ‘yawn’ and kaanati‘talk’.) The full list of such forms is given in (5.15).
4 See Guillaume (2008) for a discussion of Cavineña ditransitive constructions in a typological perspective.
5 Note that this discontinuous marker is homophonous with and probably historically related to the discontinuous reflexive marker k(a)-…-ti (§5.1.3 and §8.2)

5.2.2.3. Derivation of verbs from nouns with other suffixes
The derivation of a number of additional inflecting verbs from nouns involves more irregular morphology. For example, a -ta suffix derives the intransitive verbs muru-ta- ‘becomes ashes’ from the independent noun muru ‘dust, ash’; a -kata suffix derives the intransitive verbs na-kata- ‘get wet’ from the e-noun -na ‘water’; and a suffix -tura derives the transitive verb baara-tura- ‘cause O to have fever’ from the independent noun baara ‘fever’.6

6 Note that -ta and -tura are homophonous with other suffixes in the language. Starting with -ta, it is first homophonous with the adjective verbalizer -ta (§5.2.3.4). It is also homophonous with the -ta allomorph of the passive marker (§5.1.3 and §8.1). As for -tura, it is homophonous with the adjective verbalizer -tura (§5.2.3.5).

5.2.3. Verbalization of adjectives
Inflecting verbs can be derived from adjectives with five suffixes, with different degrees of productivity. Four suffixes derive intransitive verbs: -kwina (21 verbs), -na (13 verbs), -tsu (4 verbs) and -ta (3 verbs). Two suffixes derive transitive verbs: -tura (21 verbs), and -ne (2 verbs). Each suffix is illustrated in turn.

5.2.3.1. Derivation of intransitive verbs from adjectives with -kwina

The suffix -kwina was found deriving 21 intransitive inflecting verbs from da-adjectives (§11.2).7 A verb derived with -kwina depicts the action of slowly and gradually acquiring the property denoted by the adjective. The 21 verbs
derived with this suffix that were found in the available data are listed in (5.19),
sorted by semantic type.

5.2.3.2. Derivation of intransitive verbs from adjectives with -na/-ne
The suffix -na/-ne also derives intransitive inflecting verbs from da-adjectives.8 In contrast with the semantics of -kwina, above, this suffix denotes the intensive and rapid acquisition of the property expressed by the adjective. In most cases, it is the -na allomorph that is used; only two adjectives, jawa- ‘yellow’ and ba‘cold’, take -ne instead of -na. The full list is given in (5.22).

5.2.3.3. Derivation of intransitive verbs from adjectives with -tsu

A third way to derive intransitive inflecting verbs from da-adjectives is with the suffix -tsu derives intransitive inflecting verbs from da-adjectives. I have rather few examples of this suffix in the available data. The derived verb appears to denotes the action of beginning to acquire the property denoted by the adjective. The exhaustive list of verbs derived with -tsu is given in (5.25).

When trying to obtain more examples of -tsu during elicitation, the suffix was refused by Emerenciano Sepa on the following verbs; the exact reasons for the ungrammaticality of these forms are not known.

‘The mud in the path is already starting to dry (lit. become hard).’ n5.0840

5.2.3.4. Derivation of intransitive verbs from adjectives with -ta

A fourth way to derive intransitive inflecting verbs from da-adjectives is with the suffix -ta.10 I have only three examples of this suffixes, listed in (5.28). Ap-
parently, the derived verb denotes the action of acquiring the property expressed
by the adjective to an extreme degree.

(5.28)

shabi-ta‘become extremely tender’

shabi‘tender’

paja-ta‘become extremely white’

paja‘white’

tsunu-ta‘become extremely long (time)’

tsunu‘long (time)’

A possible addition to the list would be the intransitive verb ushuta- ‘deflate’, that possibly comes from the independent adjective ushuri ‘skinny’ minus the syllable ri.

10 Note that this suffix is homophonous with and perhaps related to the noun verbalizer -ta (§5.2.2.3) and/or the -ta allomorph of the passive marker (§5.1.3 and §8.1).

140 5. Predicate structure — an overview
Note that the suffix -ta also derives a few inflecting verbs from nouns; see §5.2.2.

5.2.3.5. Derivation of transitive verbs from adjectives with -tura and -ne

Transitive inflecting verbs can first be derived from adjectives by way of the suffix -tura. This suffix applies essentially to da-adjectives, like the adjective verbalizing suffixes discussed above. Yet it is also found with two independent adjectives: yuama ‘bad’ and pureama ‘happy’. The 21 forms found in the data are listed in (5.29), sorted by semantic type.

Two transitive inflecting verbs were found derived with a suffix -ne: asha-
sha-ne- ‘make O short’, from the independent adjective ashasha/achacha
‘small’, and chacha-ne- ‘make O alive, cure O’, from independent adjective chacha ‘alive’.11

5.2.4. Verbalization by reduplication
About 30 intransitive and a few transitive inflecting verbs have the last CV syllable reduplicated.12 A few of these verbs are derived from other word classes (verbs, da-adjectives, or nouns). However, the vast majority of these verbs are inherently reduplicated: the base from which the final syllable is repeated does not exist as an independent form in the language.
Cases where a verbal base is recoverable include rara-ra- ‘dry (slowly?)’ (intransitive verb rara- ‘dry’), katsa-tsa- ‘drizzle’ (transitive verb katsa- ‘beat O’) and kwina-na- ‘go out, be born’ (ambitransitive verb kwina- ‘give birth, give birth to O’).
Two da-adjective bases are identifiable in apu-pu- ‘darken’, from da-adjective apu- ‘dark’, and jawa-wa- ‘ripen’, from da-adjective jawa- ‘yellow’. Note that both forms apu and jawa also exist as verbs, but with the causative meanings ‘cover’ and ‘paint yellow’, respectively.

11 Note that -ne is also an allomorph of the adjective verbalizer -na/-ne (§5.2.3.2). 12 Note that this only happens with CV syllables, never with V syllables.

5.2 Inflecting verbs 143

Finally, a nominal base is found within weka-ka- ‘be at dawn’ (independent noun weka ‘light’).
For the remaining (about 20) verbs with final syllable reduplication, there is
no identifiable source. They are given in (5.31), with intransitive verbs in (a.), and transitive verbs in (b.):13

(5.31)

a. barerebukukuburaraisereremanunumuririmuwewepakaka- / pajakapatatapejiji-

‘feel dizzy’ ‘move’ ‘germinate’ ‘stretch’ ‘shrivel, dry up’ ‘bubble’ ‘gush, spurt’ ‘fall’
‘drip’ ‘lean’

petutu- ‘boil’ piriri- ‘shiver’ rururu- ‘flow’ sukururu- ‘drip’ tadada- ‘shiver’ tarara- ‘snore’ tsajaja- ‘run’ warere- ‘turn’ wenana- ‘become nervous’ weruru- ‘sweat’

b. bajejebajiji-14 iruruitatajibururumakaka-

‘prepare O’ ‘arrange O’ ‘thresh O’ ‘shake O’ ‘wash face of O’ ‘hug O’

mukakapiruru- / piruripukakasirara-

‘cover eyes of O’ ‘roll O up’
‘make O round’ ‘undo O’

Note how many of the previous forms encode events that have a sonorous component (patata- ‘drip’, tarara- ‘snore’, petutu- ‘boil’, etc.). I am tempted to suggest that final syllable reduplication is primarily a matter of onomatopoeia, in which new verbs are created from sounds that are somehow associated with the entity or the event depicted.
Similarly to verbs with final syllable reduplication, there are verbs with a fully reduplicated shape but for which no independent base can be identified. As we will see, verbal full reduplication also exists as a productive process (§5.5 and §8.3.1). The full list of these inherently fully reduplicated verbs attested in the data is given in (5.32), in which the a-examples are intransitive, and the b-examples transitive).

13 A few more verbs have been found with the final syllable reduplicated but with a
meaning still unclear, such as kanana-‘cry (?)’, pisisi- ‘drip from a small hole (?)’ and
putsutsu- ‘lose the sensation (?)’. 14 Only two examples are available of bajiji-. This word is possibly a variant of bajeje-
‘prepare O’.

144 5. Predicate structure — an overview

a. jikajikajujukanakanarikwirikwiririjijirudurudu-

‘scratch head’ ‘burn’ ‘pulsate’ ‘palpitate’ ‘rot’ ‘burn (e.g. spicy food)’ ‘limp’

b. jajakakapapa- / pepatatasusu-

‘sieve O’ ‘tie O’ ‘cover O (e.g., with soil)’ ‘nail O’ ‘suck O’

Again, it is quite possible that (at least) some of these verbs have an onomatopoeic origin. Note that all these verbs, except perhaps riri- ‘rot’ and jiji- ‘burn (e.g. spicy food)’, denote actions with sonorous or rhythmic components. We will also see nouns with a partially or fully reduplicated shape, again likely to have had an onomatopoeic origin (§12.7.7).

5.2.5. Noun incorporation

A number of transitive inflecting verbs are derived by incorporating a noun within an existing transitive inflecting verb. The full list of attested forms is given in (5.33), with nouns and verbs which occur more than once in boldface.

The morpho-syntactic characteristics of noun incorporation in Cavineña are as follows:15

1 — The incorporated noun is in most cases an e-noun (i.e., a noun which requires an e- prefix formative and which refer to the part of an entity; see §12.3.1), except for ijaka ‘ear’, kasa ‘strength’ and bawe ‘custom’ (which are independent nouns). 2 — The valency of the derived verb is not affected by the process of noun incorporation, with the possible exception of transitive kasa-seka- ‘weaken O’, based on ditransitive seka- ‘take O away from O’. In (5.34), for example, volunteered by Alfredo Tavo, there are two core arguments: an ergative subject and an absolutive — unmarked — object. This makes clear that the derived verb metuku-tubu- ‘cut O’ is transitive, exactly like the non-derived verb tubu- ‘cut O’.

(5.34)

Santiago=raA =tuO

e-ju=keO

Santiago=ERG =3SG(-FM) 3-younger.brother=3

15 Note that these characteristics would make Cavineña noun incorporation fall under Mithun’s (1984: 856) type II noun incorporation.

metuku-tubu-wa. hand-cut-PERF
‘Santiago has cut the finger (lit. hand) of his younger brother.’ n5.0299

Similarly in (5.35), also volunteered by Alfredo Tavo, the derived verb aa-tubu‘cut branch of O’ appears with an overt absolutive — unmarked — object, showing that the incorporation of -aa ‘branch’ has not affected its transitive status.

‘Cut the branch of that tree!’ n5.0304

3 — The incorporated noun occurs immediately before the root; nothing can occur in between. In (5.36), for example, which was said to me by Elio Tavo at the beginning of a working session, -akwa ‘chest’ occurs between the ka- part of the reflexive circumfix k(a)-…-ti (i.e., slot C) and the verb root (slot D).

4 — The e- prefix of a compounded e-noun is obligatorily omitted (as expected when e-nouns enter derivational processes; see §12.3.1).

I have not treated noun incorporation as part of the productive verbal morphology (and have not assigned a slot to it in the predicate structure) for the following reasons:

1 — Inflecting verbs derived by noun incorporation are very scarcely used in texts. The majority of the forms given in (5.33) were obtained through elicitation; 2 — The forms of a noun used independently and the same noun used incorporated are different in a number of cases. Examples are bawe ‘custom’ incorporated as bawi; kasa ‘strength’ incorporated as kasa in kasa-seka- ‘weaken’, but kas in kas-tirya- ‘tire’; and -metuku ‘hand’ incorporated as metuku in some verbs (e.g., metuku-tubu- ‘cut finger’), but me in others (e.g., me-deke- ‘help O with arm’);

148 5. Predicate structure — an overview

3 — The meaning of the derived verb is not always fully transparent. Examples are ijaka-baka- ‘listen carefully to O’ (from ijaka ‘ear’ and baka- ‘hear O’), akwa-tsuru- ‘face O’ (from -akwa ‘chest’ and tsuru- ‘meet’), bawi-tya- ‘teach’ (from bawe ‘custom’ and tya- ‘give’) and tsuje-baka- ‘charge’ (from -tsuje ‘price’ and baka- ‘ask’).

It is quite likely that verbs derived by noun incorporation are remnants of a system that used to be more productive in the past. In keeping with Mithun’s (1984) description of type II incorporation in various languages, the function of noun incorporation in Cavineña was probably to promote highly affected ‘possessors’ from oblique genitive function — slot C of the NP structure; see §12.1 and §13.4 — to core O function, and demote the ‘possessed’ part from core O function to being part of the predicate. The way present day Cavineña speakers promote a ‘possessor’ from a genitive phrase in slot C to core O function is by placing the ‘possessor’ in an oblique locative phrase (§14.2.3). Note that this could be a calque from Spanish. The phenomenon is illustrated in (5.37).

At least two intransitive verbs appear to have undergone noun incorporation and would therefore qualify as Mithun’s (1984) type I incorporation:

— The intransitive verb kas-tere- ‘become tired’ is clearly composed of the independent noun kasa ‘strength’ (reduced to kas) and the intransitive verb tere‘finish’. (Note that kasa is also found incorporated within the transitive verb tirya- ‘finish O’ where it is also reduced to kas; see (5.33).) — The transitive verb ena-pa- ‘cry for O’ is quite possibly composed of the e-noun -na, with its e- prefix retained, and the intransitive verb pa- ‘cry’.

5.2 Inflecting verbs 149

5.2.6. Formatives

There is a formative suffix -a which can be identified as a causative derivational morpheme. This suffix is synchronically non-productive: it is only found in a handful of transitive verbs which end with the vowel a. I will refer to these as a-verbs.
The five a-verbs given in (5.38) below are derived from intransitive verbs.

(5.38)

butyanityanudyatiryapeya-

‘lower’ ‘make stand, stop, leave’ ‘make enter’ ‘finish’ ‘make cry’

butenetinubiterepa-

‘go down’ ‘stand’ ‘enter’ ‘finish’ ‘cry’

Note that the derivation is quite irregular, in part reflecting the fact that it is no longer a productive process. In the first four pairs, the addition of the suffix -a triggers palatalization + desyllabification of a preceding front vowel (e or i). We also have unpredictable vowel modification (e.g., nitya ~ neti) and consonant modification (e.g., nudya/nubi). As for the fifth pair, peya ~ pa, it is not clear what process turned the second form into the first one.
One a-verb, muya- ‘scare away’, appears derived form another transitive verb, mui- ‘respect, fear’.
The three a-verbs listed in (5.39) are appear to be derived from nouns:

(5.39)

miwa- ‘feed’ uda- ‘light up’ wanya- ‘marry’

emiwe16 ‘manioc flour’ (independent noun) ude ‘light’ (independent noun) wane ‘wife’ (kinship noun)

For a few more a-verbs, the original base is not clearly recoverable but appears as a formative in other words which are semantically close. This is the case for warya- ‘make turn’, where the form ware occurs as the base of the final syllable reduplicated verb warere- ‘turn’, and for karya- ‘hook’ where the form kare is found within the verb kareta- ‘run aground’.
Many other transitive verbs end with an a vowel (adya ‘contaminate’, mutya ‘dip in water’, etc.). However, it is not clear to what extent this a is the causative suffix or not. More work is needed, including comparison with other Tacanan languages.

16 Note that the word initial e vowel found in the independent noun emiwe is not found in the putative derived verb miwa-. If the proposed derivation is correct, this could indicate that emiwe was in the past an e-noun with a segmentable e- prefix.

150 5. Predicate structure — an overview

The transitive verbs buiji- ‘swallow O’ and siiji- ‘absorb O’ are most likely related to iji- ‘drink O’ but the formatives bu and si do not occur as independent morphemes in Cavineña.17
The transitive verb isaani- ‘ride O, sit on top of O (e.g., horse)’ seems to be related to the verb ani- ‘sit’ (or its corresponding postural suffix -ani ‘SIT’; §9.1.1) but the formative isa does not occur as an independent morpheme in the language.
A formative prefix i- is found in (at least) the three transitive verbs listed in (5.40); the meaning of this prefix is unknown.

(5.40)

i-be- ‘keep O’ i-kwaya- ‘release O’ i-tinu- ‘stretch/tighten O’

be- ‘bring O’ kwa- ‘go’ tinu- ‘pull O’

The intransitive verb amiku- ‘bleed’ is clearly related to the independent noun ami ‘blood’; the meaning of the formative ku is unknown.

5.3. Non-inflecting verbs
Like inflecting verbs, non-inflecting verbs also head the predicate (slot D). Unlike inflecting verbs, however, they cannot take any verbal affixes. These are carried by an auxiliary, which occurs in slot E. Intransitive non-inflecting verbs take the intransitive auxiliary ju- ‘be’, while transitive non-inflecting verbs take the transitive auxiliary a- ‘affect’.
This class is less well defined than the inflecting one. The boundary between non-inflecting verbs and independent adjectives is not clear cut. The intransitive auxiliary and the copula verb are homophonous (ju- ‘be’). An intransitive noninflecting verb is not significantly different from an adjective as the copula complement of the copula verb.
To date, I have found about 100 non-inflecting verbs. Unlike inflecting verbs, non-inflecting verbs are an open class. The class of non-inflecting verbs is probably growing very fast as new items from Spanish keep entering the language.

5.3.1. Basic non-inflecting verbs There are forms for which I cannot find an origin and which I can call basic non-inflecting verbs. They are listed exhaustively in (5.41).
17 Note that bu is found within bute- ‘go down’.

b. Basic transitive non-inflecting verbs

endya aeshu aijawe apusha a-

‘say yes to O’ ‘cut hair of O’ ‘play with O’ ‘lie to O’

The great majority of non-inflecting verbs, however, appear to have come from somewhere else, with different degrees of transparency. These can be called non-basic non-inflecting verbs. Attested origins are borrowing (§5.3.2), direct conversion from another word class (especially nouns; §5.3.3), inherent reduplication (§5.3.4) or the lexicalization of an auxiliary-triggering modifier (slots B, I and J; §5.3.5).

5.3.2. Borrowings

A very important number of non-inflecting verbs have their origin in recent loans from Spanish, and most are not integrated into the Cavineña phonological system. Note that lexical loans, irrespective of what their word class is in the source language, cannot take any verbal suffixes.
The full list of non-inflecting verbs which have been identified as having a lexical loan origin are given in (5.42) (intransitive) and (5.43) (transitive), with an indication of the word class, the form and the meaning of the borrowed term in the source language. Nouns in (a.) and verbs in (b.)

Typically, for a given concept, if a noun is available in the source language (essentially Spanish), then the noun is borrowed, even if there is also a corresponding verb. For the concept ‘march’, for example, Spanish has both the noun desfile and the verb desfilar. But as we can see, it is the noun desfile that is borrowed. Note that there are exceptions, as with aterisa ju- ‘land’, from the verb aterrizar and not from the noun aterrizaje, or prepara a- ‘prepare O’, from the verb preparar and not from the noun preparación; the reason why the verb was chosen in these cases rather than the noun might have to do with word length, or word internal complexity; this needs more study. If there is only a verb for a concept, then the verb is borrowed. This is the case of ordeña a- ‘milk O’ (from ordeñar). Normally, the infinitive form of the verb is taken and the final r is dropped, in order to conform to Cavineña (C)V syllable structure. This can be seen in defila ju-, aterisa ju- and prepara a-. But again, there are exceptions, as with sigue a- ‘continue doing O’, where it is the third person form in the present tense, or the imperative form, that has been borrowed.

5.3.3. Direct conversion

158 5. Predicate structure — an overview

5.3.4. Inherent reduplication

A number of non-inflecting verbs have a fully reduplicated shape out of which no independent base can be identified. (As we will see, there is also in Cavineña a productive process of full reduplication deriving non-inflecting verbs; cf. §5.5 and §10.6.) These inherently reduplicated forms are again likely to have an onomatopoeic origin: note how all the forms listed in (5.50) denote reiterated actions, involve rhythm, and often have sonorous components.

5.3.5. Lexicalization
A number of non-inflecting verbs are transparently the result of lexicalization following an auxiliary-triggering process. One good example is wikamutya ju‘fish with line and hook’. This intransitive non-inflecting verb quite transparently comes from the noun wika ‘hook’ and the transitive inflecting verb mutya‘dip O’. It is likely that mutya- ‘dip (any) O’ was first turned into the noninflecting verb mutya a- ‘dip (any) O’ (by the Ø-marked auxiliary-triggering process; see §10.5) and then detransitivized by auxiliary alternation (see §8.3.2) together with wika ‘hook’ as its underlying O, giving the intransitive noninflecting verb wika mutya- ju- ‘dip hook’. Finally, this complex non-inflecting verb has become lexicalized as wikamutya ju- ‘fish’ (not ‘dip a/the hook’).

5.3 Non-inflecting verbs 159

5.3.6. Transitivity

As with inflecting verbs, non-inflecting verbs have strict transitivity values, and there appear to be no ambitransitive non-inflectiong verbs. Changing transitivity requires specific valency-changing mechanisms (passivization, causativization, etc.). The ratio of intransitive to transitive verbs is more balanced than with inflecting verbs, such that there are as many intransitive non-inflecting verbs as transitive non-inflecting verbs. Only one ditransitive verb has been found, presta a- ‘lend O to O’ (from Spanish prestar ‘lend O to O’). An example of this verb is given in (5.51).

There are two extended intransitive non-inflecting verbs: bawe ju- ‘know E’ and its negative counterpart baekwa ju- ‘not know E’. These two verbs have two core arguments, an S and an E, and are most likely related; baekwa ju- is probably composed of bawe plus a suffix kwa, with idiosyncratic deletion of w from bawe. Note however that kwa is not found as a suffix outside of this word in Cavineña. The extended intransitive verb bawe ju- ‘know’ is illustrated in (5.52a), where it occurs within a conditional clause (§19.5), and in (5.52b), where it is further modified by the auxiliary-triggering suffix -kara ‘DESID’.

One could analyze the E argument as an O since, similarly to O arguments, it is not case-marked and does not have any rigid order. This does not appear to be a satisfactory analysis for (at least) the following two reasons:

1 — the clause is intransitive: the subject is unmarked for case, as an S; 2 — the E argument cannot be expressed by a bound pronoun, whereas an O argument can.

Note that non-inflecting verbs derived from transitive verbs by the (related) suffixes -bawe ‘ALWS’ and -baekwa ‘ALWS.NEG’ (§10.1.4), as well as verbs derived by the reflexive circumfix k(a)-…-ti ‘REF’ in its benefactive meaning (§8.2.2), have the same extended intransitive frame.

5.4. Analytical issues

Although the auxiliary obligatorily follows a non-inflecting verb (the order can never be reversed), they form separate constituents. This is first shown by the fact that when a non-inflecting verb comes first in a main clause, second position clitics, if present, are always attached to the non-inflecting verb, and never to the auxiliary. This can be seen in (5.54), where the second position bound pronoun =tu is attached to kwatsabiji, not to ju-ya — kwatsabiji ju-ya =tu would be ungrammatical.

See also =mi in tawi =mi ju-ya ‘are you having a dream?’ in (5.49a). In addition, the verb and the auxiliary can always be separated by any clausal constituent. In (5.55), for example, the non-inflecting verb kuji ‘be lost’ is separated from its auxiliary ju- by the independent particle riyabarepa and the postpositional phrase chine=ju ‘at night’ (and the second position clitic =mi).

Although discontinuous complex predicates are attested cross-linguistically (as in, for e.g., the Australian language Jaminjung; see Schultze-Bernt 2000: 118f.), we need to consider possible alternative analyses.
A first possible alternative analysis could be in terms of a structure of the type complement-to-a-copula-predicate. This is suggested by the fact that the

162 5. Predicate structure — an overview

intransitive auxiliary and the copula verb are homophonous. In both cases, the sole argument is encoded in the same way. Both the copula verb and the auxiliary have the same morphological possibilities. In addition, the verb in a complex predicate must precede the auxiliary (although not necessarily immediately), the same way the copula complement must precede the copula predicate (see §4.6.3). One might thus suggest that complex predicates should be analyzed as copula clauses. There are two reasons why this analysis is not adopted:

1 — the copula predicate of a copula clause is very frequently omitted while this tends to be quite rare with the auxiliary of a complex predicate; 2 — in a complex predicate, the intransitive auxiliary ju- alternates with a transitive; auxiliary a-, a phenomenon that is not found in a copula clause.

A second alternative analysis could consist of analyzing non-inflecting verbs as adjuncts and the auxiliaries, ju- and a-, as simple predicate. This is suggested by the fact that theses two forms are both also used as independent verbs with generic meanings; let us remember that ju- is also a copula verb. The independent verb ju- is intransitive and means ‘be, exist, happen’ as illustrated in (5.58).

tomorrow =3SG(-FM) rain be-IMPFV

‘Tomorrow, it is going to rain (lit. the rain will be).’ di1649

The independent verb a- has a very broad range of meanings, all referring to highly transitive events with a volitional/controlling A and an affected O argument, such as ‘kill’, ‘beat’, ‘bite’, ‘sting’, ‘catch (e.g., a fish while fishing)’, ‘build (e.g., a house)’, ‘cook’, etc. Note that most of these actions can otherwise be expressed by a more specific verb such as, for example, iye- ‘kill’, katsa‘beat’, karu- ‘bite’, kemi- ‘take out, catch’, tekwa- ‘shoot’, etc. In this work, this central meaning is captured by the uniformly applied gloss ‘affect’. In (5.59) below, I illustrate the independent verb a- ‘affect’ used by itself.

there-LOC =3SG-DAT =3SG(-FM) trahira

a-chine… affect-REC.PAST

What this shows is that there is no crucial difference in meaning between auxiliaries and corresponding independent verbs. All these forms have a strict transitivity value and are very generic semantically. In addition, morphological possibilities are basically the same for all the forms. This could thus suggest that in both cases, there would just be a simple predicate, ju- or a-, and an adjunct modifier to it consisting of the non-inflecting component. This alternative is not adopted for two reasons. First, non-inflecting verbs are restricted to occurring with only ju- or a-, and not with other verbs. Adjunct type constituents in Cavineña, such as independent particles, postpositional phrases, and adverbial clauses, can occur with any verb. Secondly, a non-inflecting verb obligatorily precedes its auxiliary, whereas an adjunct has free word order.
A third possible analysis could be in terms of complementation, with the non-inflecting component filling the O slot of the simple predicates ju- or a-. This, however, is clearly not the case. We saw that there is a copula ju- with a CC slot but none attested with an O argument. The independent verb a- does have a slot for an O argument. However, the non-inflecting component clearly fills a different slot, always preceding a-, whereas the O argument is not restricted to a particular position vis-à-vis its controlling verb, and both slots can be independently filled (e.g., (5.5b)).

5.5. Reduplication
There are five processes of reduplication associated with verbs in Cavineña. First, there is a verbalization derivational process of full or final syllable reduplication that applies to various word classes, such as verbs, adjectives, and nouns (§5.2.4). This process is not productive, and many verbs are inherently reduplicated.
Second, there is an auxiliary-triggering process of full reduplication that applies equally to intransitive and transitive verbs, and to inflecting and noninflecting verbs. It derives a non-inflecting verb of equal transitivity and with the semantics of multiple occurrence of the verb event, as in, for e.g., tsajaja‘run’ and tsajaja-tsajaja ju- ‘run many times’, katsa- ‘beat’ and katsa-katsa a‘beat many times’. This process is discussed in §10.6.
A third process is an antipassive derivation. It involves the full reduplication of inflecting transitive (and ditransitive) verbs and derives intransitive verbs which are still inflecting, i.e., the derived forms can still take verbal inflections. Syntactically, the reassignment of grammatical functions has an antipassive

164 5. Predicate structure — an overview
effect. Semantically, the reduplicated verb denotes an activity, for example changing ara- ‘eat O’ to ara-ara- ‘eat, have a meal’. A complete account of full verb reduplication with antipassive effect is provided in §8.3.1;
A fourth process involves a complex verbal morpheme which combines final syllable reduplication of a transitive verb root and the intransitive causativizer suffix -sha (§5.1.3 and §8.4.1). This process encodes the fact that the verb event is reiterated many times, as in katsa- ‘beat, whip’ and katsa-tsa+sha- ‘beat up, batter’. A full discussion of this complex morpheme is provided in §7.1.9.
Finally, reduplication is involved in a complex verbal morpheme which consists of the full reduplication of a verb and the -ni allomorph of the Aktionsart suffix -(ne)ni ‘RANDOM’. This process expresses the multiple reiteration of the verb event. It is discussed in §7.1.8, together with the suffix -(ne)ni.

Chapter 6 Predicate structure — inflectional morphology
In this chapter I discuss the affixes that go into slot A/K of the predicate. These consist of Tense-Aspect-Modality (TAM) affixes and command affixes: imperative, hortative and jussive. There is an additional suffix that goes into slot K, the clause linker -tsu, but this suffix is discussed in §18.2. Slot A/K must be filled by one (and only one) of these markers in any single finite clause (but see some exceptions in §6.1.6). Since slot A/K affixes are obligatory, they are referred to as inflections.
TAM inflections are used in both statements and questions. They are discussed in §6.1. They consist of six affixes: -kware ‘REM.PAST’ and -chine ‘REC.PAST’ (§6.1.1), -buke ‘REM.FUT’ (§6.1.2), -ya ‘IMPFV’ (§6.1.3), -wa ‘PERF’ (§6.1.4) and e-…-u ‘POT’ (§6.1.5). These suffixes form a temporal system with three degrees of remoteness in the past (remote vs. recent vs. immediate) and (possibly) two degrees of remoteness in the future (present/near future vs. remote future). The two suffixes -ya ‘IMPFV’ and -wa ‘PERF’ have additional aspectual meanings, in addition to their temporal meanings. The circumfix e-…-u ‘POT’, in addition to a temporal (future) meaning, brings a contrast of modality to the system. A verb cannot normally be used without an inflectional marker, except for stylistic effect, in which case the inflectional marker can be left out. This is discussed in §6.1.6.
Verbs used for commands require different affixes (§6.2). First, there are affixes for imperative commands, i.e., commands addressed to a second person: -kwe/-ume ‘IMP.SG/IMP.SG.NEG’, ne-…-kwe/ne-…-ume ‘IMP.NSG/IMP.NSG.NEG’. They are discussed in §6.2.1. Second, there are affixes for hortative commands, i.e., commands addressed to a first person: pa- ‘HORT.SG’, ne- ‘HORT.DL’ and ne-…-ra ‘HORT.PL’. They are discussed in §6.2.2. Finally, there is one prefix for jussive commands, i.e., commands addressed to a third person: pa- ‘JUSS’. This prefix is discussed in §6.2.3. After discussing these affixes, I address the following topics: negation of verbs with hortative and jussive affixes (§6.2.4), noncommand uses of imperative and hortative affixes (§6.2.5), and markedness and historical considerations (§6.2.6).
6.1. TAM inflections
There are six TAM affixes, consisting of five suffixes and one circumfix. The forms are given in Table 6.1 and discussed in the following sections.

The suffix -kware ‘REMote PAST’ is used to encode events that have occurred at a time earlier than a year in the past, as illustrated in (6.1).

The suffix -chine ‘RECent PAST’ is used to encode events that have taken place at any time from the day before as far back as twelve months before, as illustrated in (6.2).

(6.2) a. previous day

Note that (6.1a) and (6.2c), which show the temporal boundary between the use of -kware and -chine, were obtained through elicitation. Informants report that

168 6. Predicate structure — inflectional morphology
there are variations from speaker to speaker. Apparently some speakers are reported to set the boundary between -kware and -chine at one week’s time (as opposed to one year’s time). The division between -chine and -kware needs more testing and confirmation through text examples.

6.1.2. -buke ‘REM.FUT’

The remote future marker -buke ‘REMote FUTure’ is used to encode events that could take place in the remote future. It can also be used to encode a less remote event when the speaker is very uncertain that this event will take place.
The remote future suffix is typically used for very remote events such as those that may occur during one’s afterlife, as with (6.3), an excerpt from a recorded conversation between Antonio Yubanera (A) and Ventura Mayo (V). After having talked about half an hour about traditional practices, they comment on the outcome of these recordings for future generations. Note that Ventura’s utterance overlaps with Antonio’s utterance.

‘(Yes,) after we are dead, they (our children) will understand them (our traditions).’ ab004

Bible prophesies are translated using -buke as in (6.4a) (Joel 2:28-32) and (6.4b) (Luke 3:1-17). Note that these two examples come from Camp and Liccardi’s (1989) dictionary.

tuyune-tana-buke. straighten-PASS-REM.FUT
‘The crooked roads shall become straight.’ di2782

The remote future -buke need not necessarily refer to such extremely remote events. It can as well be used for more recent events, as long as there is uncertainty about their realization. Example (6.5), which shows an event set in eight months time, was given as a possible use of this suffix.

‘I will go collecting brazil nut next year in January.’ (Said 3rd June 2003.) n5.0123

The dictionary example (6.6a) with -buke was double-checked and discussed
with consultants. It means that the speaker does not really think he will give the
thing to the hearer (because the speaker knows that the hearer most probably does not have the money). But in the same situation, if the speaker has more reason to believe that he will give the thing, he can use -ya, as shown by (6.6b):1

‘I will give it to you when you bring me the money.’ di2854

1 Examples such as those in (6.6) could suggest that the distinction between -buke and -ya is not as much one of temporal distance as one of degree of certainty. More work is needed on this issue.

6.1.3. -ya ‘IMPFV’

The suffix -ya ‘IMPerFectiVe’ is used to encode the following meanings:

1 — present; 2 — near future; 3 — generic; 4 — habitual; 5 — past imperfective/overlapping/on-going/progressive.

In fast speech, -ya ‘IMPFV’ is sometimes realized phonetically as [e] when it is followed by the phrasal focus particle =dya ‘FOC’. This always happens when
the stem has more than 2 syllables, as in (6.7a). This occasionally happens when the stem has 2 syllables, as shown in (6.7b).2 However, this never happens when
the stem has one syllable, as in (6.7c).

Note that speakers are not aware of this variation. When asked to repeat these forms slowly and carefully, they invariably pronounce [ya]. This suggests that the variation [ya] ~ [e] may be on the way to creating allomorphs but has still not reached this point yet.
The five different meanings of -ya are illustrated in turn below.

1— present meaning. Examples showing the present meaning of -ya ‘IMPFV’ are given in (6.8).

4 — the past habitual meaning of -ya is illustrated in (6.11). Here an elderly woman relates how Cavineña women used to prepare corn beer in the olden days (they now make it differently). Although the time frame is the remote past, she uses -ya, and not -kware ‘REM.PAST’, to encode the habitual nature of the corn beer preparation.

Here, Ventura Mayo relates a dreadful journey through a highly flooded area during the rainy season, which he undertook when he was young; the time frame is therefore the remote past. At some point, he had to build a raft in order to cross a river. When the raft was ready, Ventura comments:

Ventura uses the remote past -kware in the main verbs of a. (‘I lay down’), of b. (‘I swam’), and of d. (‘I went’) because each of these events occurs one after the other (i.e., in a sequence). However, Ventura uses -ya in (c.), presumably because the event ‘I was lying’ overlaps with ‘I swam’ (from b.) and ‘I went’ (from d.).
Following (6.12) we have (6.13). After having left the river banks and swum some distance, Ventura relates:

Ventura uses the remote past -kware in (a.) because the event of ‘reaching the middle of the river’ occurs in a sequence with the preceding event (‘I went’, in (6.12d)). However, Ventura switches to -ya in (c.), presumably because the event ‘I could see many caimans’ overlaps with the preceding event (‘reaching the middle of the river’). In other words, Ventura started to see the caimans before he had reached the middle of the river (and kept seeing them until he finally reached the other banks of the river).
The example in (6.14) is taken from a text in which Alfredo Tavo relates a journey in which he nearly died of thirst. At some point, he found a palm grove. Hoping that he could find water under the ground, he relates:

(6.14)

… puru-kware. Tume uyuuyu=kamadyaS ani-ya=dya.

dig-REM.PAST then mud=ONLY

sit-IMPFV=FOC

‘I dug (the length of my arm). But there was only mud (no water).’ sd024

Alfredo uses the remote past -kware when he relates the event ‘I dug’ because this event occurs in a sequence with what he has related before, i.e., ‘I arrived at a palm grove’. However, Alfredo uses -ya in the next sentence, presumably because the event ‘there was only mud’ overlaps with the event of ‘digging’.
Verbs in citation form are always given with an inflectional affix, which is usually -ya ‘IMPFV’ (e.g., tawi-ya ‘to sleep’ but not *tawi). Note also that -ya can be used as a strategy to express very strong orders (see §6.2.1).

6.1.4. -wa ‘PERF’

The suffix -wa ‘PERFect’ is used to express the following meanings:

1 — immediate past; 2 — perfect/anterior;

Each meaning is illustrated below.

1 — immediate past. An event that has taken place the same day and prior to the time of speech, or during the preceding night requires -wa, as illustrated in (6.15) and (6.16).

2 — perfect/anterior meaning is first illustrated with (6.17). This example comes from a story that was recorded in 1998 form Griselda Cartagena, who relates a trip she undertook with her family in the light plane of the missionaries (the story is therefore set in the remote past — SIL missionaries were in Bolivia in the 1960’s and 1970’s). Griselda uses the remote past -kware to relate the landing of the plane. Then, switching to -wa, she says:

6.1. TAM inflections 177

(6.17)

[E-kwe ebakwa=kwana]S =bakwe

1SG-GEN child=PL

=CONTR

tawi-wa. sleep-PERF

‘My children had slept (during the trip).’ av032

In the story time line, the children’s ‘sleeping’ event has occurred before the family gets down from the plane and is thus reported out of sequence. If Griselda had used -kware, it would have meant that the children went to sleep after they got down from the plane.
Sentence (6.18) is taken from a story by Alfredo Tavo about how, in the olden days, a group of Cavineñas were ambushed by enemies. The Cavineñas hear a suspicious noise (-kware), they realize that an attack has been launched against them (-kware), they run to their weapons (-kware), but it is too late because:

all

3PL

go.around-PASS-PERF

‘They were (already) all encircled (by the enemies).’ fd029

The event of ‘encircling’, even though narrated after the events of ‘hearing a noise’, ‘realizing’, and ‘running’, is not in sequence with them in the story time line. It has occurred before the protagonists ‘hear’, ‘realize’ and ‘run’. If Alfredo had used -kware, it would have meant that they were encircled after ‘running’.
Example (6.19) comes at the end of a story by Antonio Yubanera of a hunter who once (generously) saved a caiman (that was lost in the middle of the forest). Ten years later, the same caiman tries to trick him, ungratefully. Fortunately, the hunter is saved from the caiman by a cunning dog. At the end of the story, the narrator concludes, referring to the two events of ‘saving’:

(6.19)

‘Hei (the hunter) had first saved (lit. cured) a caiman (about 10 years earlier). Then, (this time,) a dog saved himi.’ cd049

The stretch of text where the hunter is described saving the caiman occurs about 40 sentences earlier than (6.19). Here, it is referred to again, to contrast with the

178 6. Predicate structure — inflectional morphology
‘dog’s saving of the hunter’. Although the two events strictly speaking occur on after another, they are not in sequence.

6.1.5. e-…-u ‘POT’

The circumfix e-…-u ‘POTential’ is used to encode future events which are contingent to the occurrence of another event. The potential circumfix is first illustrated in (6.20).

(6.20)

‘You (pl) could lose (lit. kill) your children in the Biata river (if you try to cross).’ ri060

The potential circumfix can be used to refer to events which could take place at any time in the future. For example, it has a near future reading (a few days) in (6.20a) and (6.20b). In (6.21a) below, it has an immediate future reading (the protagonists are about to cross the bridge). And it has a remote future reading in (6.21b). This example immediately follows (6.3), a conversation between Ventura Mayo and Antonio Yubanera about Cavineña children reading the recorded and transcribed texts, following a series of verbs inflected with -buke ‘REM.FUT’.

‘If they (our children) read it (the transcription of our discussion), they might be able to know (about our traditions).’ (said by Antonio Yubanera) ab005

Note that the first position particle deka ‘POTENTIALLY’ (§16.2.4) is reinforcing the potential reading in (6.21a).
The potential marker is often used in questions to express soft and polite requests, as in (6.22) (see further discussion in §6.2.1):

‘Shall I take him there to the shore (lit. solid ground) (the caiman, who was carrying a man on his back, asked the ox)?’ cd030

6.1.6. Verb with no inflectional marking

There are occasions when the verb of a main clause occurs as a bare stem; that is, the verb does not take the otherwise obligatory inflectional morphology. When this happens, the speaker often (but not always) raises the pitch of the overall clause and lowers his voice. This phenomenon is not fully understood yet and requires further study.
Monosyllabic verbs which do not take any further (non-inflectional) morphology receive a (dummy) suffix -u ‘EPEN’ (§2.6.6). This is exemplified with the auxiliary ju- ‘be’ in (6.23); see also the auxiliaries a-u in (6.25c) and ju-u in (6.26b), and the verb ba-u in (6.26a).

FRUST =1PL

sit-GO.DOWN-DESID be-EPEN

‘We wanted to land (but didn’t succeed because there was too much water on the airstrip).’ av024

Bare stem verbs appear to be used in (at least) the following two contexts:

1 — highly predictable events; 2 — repeated events.

I discuss and illustrate each of these two contexts in turn below.

1 — highly predictable events. It was noted that (some) speakers often leave out the inflection of a verb which refers to the target of a motion event. For exam-

180 6. Predicate structure — inflectional morphology

ple, one sentence has an inflected verb meaning ‘go’, or ‘come’, and the next sentence has a non-inflected verb coding the arrival at the targeted destination. This is shown by (6.24).

2 — repetition. It was noted that (some) speakers often use bare stem verbs when they repeat the verb of the preceding sentence, for discourse coherence or for providing additional specifications, as in (6.25).

Yet in some examples such as (6.26), the reasons why the speaker chooses to use uninflected verbs are not understood; that is, the verb event is neither predictable nor repeated. It might be just a question of style.

The existence of uninflected verbs could suggest that slot A/K affixes are not obligatory in Cavineña. It is known that some languages do not have obligatory TAM categories. In Tariana (Arawak), for example, tense-aspect is established at the beginning of a paragraph by an inflected verb — setting the scene — and the verbs of the following main clauses are unmarked (Aikhenvald, p.c.). Note that in the Cavineña examples above, a clause with a marked verb often precedes a clause without an unmarked one.
In this study, I will nevertheless maintain that slot A/K affixes are obligatory (and inflectional) for the following two reasons:

182 6. Predicate structure — inflectional morphology
1 — a verb in citation form is never given uninflected; as we saw in §6.1.3, it is given with -ya ‘IMPFV’; 2 — there is a great deal of variation between speakers on how often they drop the verbal TAM inflections. The women recorded, such as Griselda Cartagena in (6.23), or Victoria Tavo in (6.26b), tend to drop more than men. Some men, like Ventura Mayo in (6.24a) and (6.25a), or his brother Cosme Mayo in (6.25c), tend to drop inflections quite often too. Alfredo Tavo, on the other hand, drops inflections only occasionally. In some texts like T1, which is quite long, he does not leave off the inflections from a single verb. This is also the case with Gregorio Yubanera in T2.

6.2. Imperative, hortative and jussive inflections

6.2.1. Imperative inflections

A verb inflected with imperative morphology has a second person subject (S/CS or A). Imperative morphology is sensitive to (1) a singular vs. non-singular number distinction and (2) a positive vs. negative polarity distinction. The paradigm of imperative inflections is reproduced in Table 6.2.

Table 6.2. Imperative inflections

Singular Non-singular

Positive
-kwe ne-…-kwe

Negative
-ume ne-…-ume

Starting with positive imperatives, I illustrate the distinction between singular and non-singular in (6.27). In (6.27a), the command is addressed to a singular second person subject and the suffix -kwe is used. In (6.27b) and (6.27c) the commands are addressed to dual and plural second person subjects respectively and both commands use the same circumfix ne-…-kwe.

Imperative clauses are used very frequently. The same marking is used for a wide range of situations, from mild requests to fairly strong orders, regardless of social status. In (6.29a), for example, a grandfather uses an imperative to address his grandson, while in (6.29b) an imperative is used by a sacristan addressing a bishop.

The main way to express various overtones of commands can first be achieved by using various types of modifiers, in addition to the imperative morphology. (Another way is to not use imperative morphology but use TAM inflections instead; see below.)
Varying the degree of a command can be achieved by verbal affixes other than inflectional affixes, such as the Aktionsart -wisha ‘FAST’, which implies an order to be carried out immediately; an example can be seen in (6.27c).
It can also be achieved by using particles such as second position particles =bakwe ‘CONTR’ (§16.3.8) or =ni ‘MAYBE’ (§16.3.2), as in (6.30). Here, we have a conversation between a group of Cavineña men (C) who are making fun of Francisco Vaca (F), a newcomer to their community, during his first fishing expedition. Francisco has killed a caiman, an animal that he had never seen before. The men tell him that caimans are good to eat (although Cavineñas do not eat caiman) and that he should take it home. When Francisco refuses to do so, they become insistent and use =bakwe to strengthen their request (first clause). Then Francisco refuses again (second clause). He then tell them politely that they themselves can take the dead caiman if they want, using the particle =ni ‘MAYBE’ (third clause).

The second position reportative particle =pa ‘REP’ (§16.3.4) can also be used to soften an imperative command, as in (6.31).

An imperative command can also be strengthened by phrasal particles such as =kwita ‘RESTR’ (§17.2.4) and =dya ‘FOC’ (§17.2.3). Alternatively, an imperative command can be softened by using the phrasal particle =piji DIM’ (§17.2.11).
Orders can also be achieved with other means than imperative morphology, using various imperative ‘strategies’.
In a way very similar to English, a statement with the imperfective inflection -ya in its future meaning can mean a very strong order which cannot be disobeyed, as in (6.32), a sequence of three clauses (with the last two having the imperative sense) uttered by a missionary lady to a Cavineña family on the penultimate day of their visit at the mission center.

be-COME.TEMP-IMPFV

‘(Tomorrow) we’ll have a service here. You’ll come to the church! (And) you’ll say goodbye!’ ri050

Using the regular imperative morphology here would have left open the final decision of ‘coming to the church’ and ‘saying goodbye’ up to the addressee (the Cavineña family), an alternative that is not left with the imperfective -ya.
A very soft and polite request can be achieved by using a polar question with the potential inflection and the negation particle, as in (6.33); another similar example can be seen in (6.22).

This request was made to me by a group of Cavineña men. They knew that a short-wave radio transmitter is very expensive and that I could probably not afford it, and they expressed their request in a very soft way.
Another very polite way to formulate a command to a second person can be achieved by making the command as if it was addressed to a third person, using jussive marking (see §6.2.3). This is shown in (6.34). This example comes from the same conversation as (6.33). Cavineñas cannot afford gold rings. When Vidal Mayo saw my gold ring he said:

metaraS!

1SG-DAT JUSS-be ring

‘Let the ring be mine!’ (i.e., I would like to have the ring) tb030

Finally, Cavineña has one interjection that has a clear imperative meaning, kwii, illustrated in (6.35).

(6.35)

Kwii, Kana! go.first Kana

6.2.2. Hortative inflections

A verb inflected with hortative morphology has a first person subject (S/CS or A). Hortative morphology is sensitive to a singular vs. dual vs. plural distinction. Unlike imperative morphology, there are no special negative hortative morphemes. Negating a hortative verbs is realized by the regular negative particle =ama (see negation of hortative verbs in §6.2.4.)
The paradigm of hortative inflections is reproduced in Table 6.3.

The singular hortative marker is an interesting feature of Cavineña since cross-linguistically, hortative commands tend to be restricted to non-singular S/A (Aikhenvald 2003b: 6). It is used when the speaker expresses his will/intentions to himself; very often, as in (6.19a), the speaker is simply alone and ‘talks to himself’. On the contrary, when the speaker communicates his will/intentions to an addressee, we typically have imperfective (declarative) marking (with future reading). This can be seen in the first sentence of (6.19b).

6.2.3. Jussive inflection
A verb inflected with the jussive prefix has a third person subject (S/CS or A). Here, there is only one morpheme, pa-, which is used for any number. There are no special markers for negative jussive; similarly to the hortative, negation is marked by the particle =ama.
Note that the jussive marker is homophonous with the singular hortative marker, suggesting that the two morphemes are historically related (see discussion in §6.2.6 below).

188 6. Predicate structure — inflectional morphology

I illustrate the jussive marker with the three number values: singular in (6.37a), dual in (6.37b) and plural in (6.37c).

(6.37)

a. Esiri=keS pa-diru! old=LIG JUSS-go

‘Let them (the people from the CIRABO organization) go and talk to them (the Araona people who are fighting with each other)!’ T1.20

6.2.4. Negating verbs with hortative and jussive inflections

Unlike for imperative, there is no special negative morphology for hortative and jussive commands. Verbs inflected with hortative or jussive affixes are negated similarly to verbs inflected with TAM affixes, i.e., with the negation enclitic particle =ama ‘NEG’ (§17.2.10). This is illustrated in (6.38) for hortative (singular and plural) and (6.39) for jussive (plural).

6.2.5. Non-command meanings

Imperative and hortative markers can have non-command meanings. This is found in replies to a wish expressed by a first person, with a verb inflected with either hortative or imperfective. Unless the addressee has an objection, s/he normally replies by repeating the same verb with the appropriate command inflection, in addition to the emphatic particle =taa.
In (6.40), we have a conversational turn between Elio Tavo (E) and his wife, Mirta (M). Elio informs her that he is going hunting:

In (6.41), a grandfather (A) communicates to his grandchild (B) his wish to go back home (after a fruitless fishing night). He uses dual hortative morphology because this wish includes the grandchild too.

190 6. Predicate structure — inflectional morphology

6.2.6. Markedness and historical considerations

Cavineña has overt marking for commands addressed to the three persons (sec-
ond, first and third). It is worth reflecting on the Cavineña system from a
broader typological perspective. Cross-linguistic studies have shown that systems used to express commands typically follow an implicational hierarchy of person distinctions, as follows (from Aikhenvald 2003b: 6):3

2nd

>

1st NSG

>

3rd

>

1st SG

The scale reads as follows. If a language has any marking for commands, it is expected that it will be a command addressed to a second person. If more complex, the language will also have first person non-singular command marking, then third person and finally first person singular.
The Cavineña system fits the scale quite nicely. First, it encodes all these distinctions, without any gap. Second, it is of note that that first person singular command and third person command have the same form (pa-) and that they look quite different from the rest of the markers. This sets them both separately from the rest, as they are on the implicational hierarchy scale above. This can be better seen from the three paradigm reproduced below in a slightly different arrangement:

IMPERATIVE (2nd)

-kwe

SG

ne-…-kwe NSG

HORTATIVE (1st)

ne-

DL

ne-…-ra PL

pa-

SG

JUSSIVE (3rd)

pa-

SG/DL/PL

Note the ‘family resemblance’ that goes across imperative and hortative nonsingular with -kwe and ne- being both shared by two or more markers. On the other hand, the pa-shape of singular hortative and jussive looks very different.
According to the predictions of the implicational hierarchy, singular hortative and jussive markers should have developed later than the rest. Their origin remains unclear however. They are homophonous with the reportative second position enclitic particle =pa (see §16.3.4) but it seems unlikely that a prefix would develop from an enclitic.

3 I have slightly simplified the scale, omitting inclusive/exclusive distinctions which are not relevant to the Cavineña situation.

Chapter 7 Predicate structure — Aktionsart suffixes
Aktionsart suffixes, which occupy slot H of the predicate, are semantically very rich and complex. Their function is to modify the predicate, a function often fulfilled by adverbs in other languages. They encode a wide range of notions having to do with aspect, manner, modality, space and time. According to their semantics, they can be sorted into 4 major classes: (i) aspect/manner (§7.1), (ii) motion (§7.2), (iii) time of day (§7.3) and (iv) emotion (§7.4).
Similarly to adverbs in many languages, some Aktionsart suffixes are eventrelated while others are argument-related. Event-related suffixes modify the verb event only; e.g., -wisha encodes the fact that the verb event is performed rapidly. Argument-related suffixes modify both the verb event and a particular argument of the verb; e.g., -bare which encodes the fact that the verb event is distributed over S/O arguments.
A number of suffixes are sensitive to the transitivity of the verb stem. They have one variant for intransitive verbs and another variant for transitive verbs. This is the case, for example, with the completive suffix -tere/-tirya, where -tere is used with intransitive verbs and -tirya with transitive verbs.
Up to three Aktionsart suffixes can co-occur in a single predicate (in slot H), provided they are semantically compatible. A full discussion of the distribution of Aktionsart suffixes is given in §7.5.
About half of the Aktionsart suffixes have a corresponding independent verb; e.g., the suffix -diru ‘GO.PERM’ corresponds to the independent verb diru‘go (permanently)’. This raises the question of whether the suffixes should rather be analyzed as serialized or compounded verbs. This issue is addressed in §7.6, where I show that the suffix analysis is a better one because of the lack of productivity of the putative serialization/compounding analysis.
7.1. Aktionsart suffixes of aspect/manner
7.1.1. -tere/-tirya ‘COMP’ vs. -bisha ‘INCOMP’
The suffixes -tere/-tirya ‘COMPletive’ and -bisha ‘INCOMPletive’ are argument-related. They encode the fact the S/O argument is completely vs. incompletely affected by the verb event.
The suffix -tere/-tirya has the peculiarity that a different form is used depending on the transitivity of the verb stem it occurs with: -tere only occurs

192 7. Predicate structure — Aktionsart suffixes

with intransitive stems, as in (7.1a) (elicited), whereas -tirya only occurs with transitive stems, as in (7.1b).

The suffix -bisha is very scarce in the available corpus. It only appears in a few examples in Camp and Liccardi’s (1989) dictionary and in some of my own elicited examples. As an illustration, consider (7.2) (intransitive) and (7.3) (transitive).

The suffix -tere/-tirya can have two different interpretations, depending on
the number of the S/O referent. If the S/O argument is singular, as in (7.1) above,1 the suffix means that the verb event affects its referent as a whole. But
if the S/O argument is plural, as in the examples in (7.4) below, the meaning is that the verb event affects exhaustively all its referents:2

1 Note that plural marking is not obligatory in Cavineña (see §13.3.1). In other words budari ‘banana’ in (7.1) could have a plural meaning even though it is not marked by =kwana ‘PL’. However, Francisco Vaca, who proposed this example, made it clear from his translation that he intended a singular referent.
2 I do not have examples with dual referents. It is thus unclear which meaning of the suffixes would obtain in that situation.

194 7. Predicate structure — Aktionsart suffixes

Whether -bisha can display these alternative interpretations or not remains to be investigated.
The suffix -tere ‘COMP’ can be used with speech verbs such as kike-/keke‘shout’ and mari- ‘roar’ and express a distressing/painful situation. This is illustrated in (7.5).

Both -tere and -tirya have a corresponding independent verb, tere- ‘finish (itr.)’ and tirya- ‘finish (tr.)’, respectively.3 These verbs are illustrated in (7.6).

It is also worth noting the existence of the phrasal particle =tere ‘ONLY’ (§17.2.6).

3 One might have remarked on the similarity between the two verbs/suffixes. Indeed, historically, tirya- is a causativized form of tere- via an old causative suffix -a (see §5.2.6). This suffix is found in a few transitive verbs such as butya- ‘lower’ (from bute- ‘go down’), nudya- ‘make enter’ (from nubi- ‘enter’), etc.

7.1. Aktionsart suffixes of aspect/manner 195

7.1.2. -jaka ‘STOP’ vs. -tibune ‘START’

The suffix -jaka encodes the fact that the verb event is interrupted. It is illustrated in (7.7) (intransitive) and (7.8) (transitive).

‘He let go (lit. stopped grabbing) of the caiman in the lake.’ cd007

In the corpus, -jaka also occurs with the intransitive verb bukuku- ‘move’, as bukuku-jaka- ‘stop moving’, the transitive verbs a- ‘affect O’, as a-jaka- ‘stop calling O a certain way’,4 ejene- ‘believe O’, as ejene-jaka- ‘stop believing O’, and muba- ‘fear O’, as muba-jaka- ‘stop fearing O’.
This suffix corresponds to the independent transitive verb jaka- ‘abandon, move away from’, as illustrated in (7.9).

Note that there is a related auxiliary-triggering suffix -jakama ‘CEASELESSLY’ (§10.1.3).
The suffix -tibune carries the meaning that the event expressed by the verb stem is performed for the first time with the implication that it will be performed again in the future. As an illustration, consider (7.10) (elicited intransitive example) and (7.11) (transitive).

The suffix -tibune has a corresponding independent verb, tibune- ‘start’, which is transitive. This verb takes as its O argument either a noun, as in (7.12a), or a Ø-nominalized verb, as in (7.12b).

7.1. Aktionsart suffixes of aspect/manner 197
The semantic difference between suffix -tibune and the verb tibune- is not altogether clear. Possibly the suffix is used when the verb event is started for the first time, whereas the construction with a complement is used when just focusing on the beginning of one particular instance of the action referred to by the verb stem.

7.1.3. -jeri/-neri ‘ALMOST’

The suffix -jeri/-neri encodes the fact that the verb event is unsuccessfully realized. It can roughly be glossed by the adverb ‘almost’ in English.5
The form -jeri is used when the predicate is affirmative. The form -neri occurs when the predicate is negative. As an illustration, we have -jeri in the affirmative intransitive predicate in (7.13a) and -neri in the negative intransitive predicate in (7.13b).

7.1.4. -nuka ‘REITR’

The suffix -nuka ‘REITeRative’ encodes the fact that a verb event is reiterated.

V-ing’ or ‘V back’. As an illustration, consider (7.15) (intransitive) and (7.16)

The suffix -nuka encodes the reoccurrence of an action but not its distribution. In this sense, -nuka differs significantly from suffixes and devices such as -bare ‘DISTR’ (§7.1.7), -(ne)ni ‘RANDOM’ (§7.1.8), -aje ‘GO.DISTR’, -be ‘COME.TEMP.DISTR’ and -etibe ‘COME.PERM.DISTR’ (§7.2.2), or (the auxiliarytriggering process of) full verb stem reduplication (§10.6). With the suffix -nuka, the verb event is repeated ‘externally’. That is, it is repeated with reference to some other instance of a similar event that occurred earlier in the discourse. With distributive suffixes, on the other hand, the verb event is repeated ‘internally’. That is, it is as if one global event is viewed from the inside and is made up of the repetition of small subevents. This is reflected in that with -nuka, the two (or more) events that make the repetition do not need to be exactly similar. For example, they can have different arguments. This is the case in (7.16b), for example, where only the A argument has the same referent. The O argument of bare- ‘pass’ has a different referent from the O argument of the previous instance of the verb (i.e., a different stream), a fact which is made explicit by the presence of the discontinuous quantifier peya ‘other’. Now, with distributive suffixes/devices, the repeated events are exactly similar in nature and argument structure.

7.1.5. -baka ‘SHORT.TIME’ vs. -siri ‘LONG.TIME’

The suffix -baka encodes the fact that the verb event is performed for a relatively short time. It is illustrated in (7.18) (intransitive) and (7.19) (elicited transitive).

Even though -baka most often best translates into English with the adverbial phrase ‘a little bit’, I should emphasize the fact that the sense is essentially about the duration of the event, not about the lack of completeness. Lack of completeness would rather be encoded by -bisha ‘INCOMP’ (§7.1.1). It is not about lack of intensity either. Lack of intensity is encoded by phrasal particles such as =piji ‘DIM’ (§17.2.11) or =jipenee ‘ALMOST’ (§17.2.14).
The suffix -siri ‘LONG.TIME’ has only been obtained in elicitation, while searching for a possible antonym of -baka, and only a few examples are available. Its meaning appears to be the opposite of -baka, namely that the time span of the action is particularly long (possibly forever). It is illustrated in (7.20) (intransitive) and (7.21) (transitive).

202 7. Predicate structure — Aktionsart suffixes
There are two independent verbs in Cavineña with the forms baka and siri, namely the transitive baka- ‘hear, listen to, understand, ask’ and the transitive siri- ‘break, tear’. One might wonder, however, due to the rather striking semantics differences, if these are really the source of the two suffixes. Comparative evidence is needed to clarify this issue.

7.1.6. -wisha ‘FAST’

The suffix -wisha encodes the fact that the verb event is performed at a very fast pace. I have very few examples of it; it occurs only once in my texts (example (7.22a)); it is also found in one example in Camp and Liccardi’s (1989) dictionary (example (7.22b)). For the rest, most examples come from elicitation.
The following examples illustrate -wisha with intransitive verbs (in (7.22)) and transitive verbs (in (7.23)).

7.1.7. -bare ‘DISTR’

The suffix -bare ‘DISTRibutive’ has an S/O argument scope. It expresses the fact that the verb stem event affects each referent of a plural S/O argument individually. It cannot be used with singular or dual S/O arguments.
Illustrations with intransitive and transitive verbs are provided in (7.25) and (7.26) respectively.

Note that in English, -bare is most often best translated by the quantifier ‘all’ because of the fact that the event distributes evenly to all participants. At first glance, the meaning of -bare could then appear to be very similar to the meaning of -tere/-tirya ‘COMP’ (§7.1.1 above). However, the suffixes -bare and -tere/-tirya are not synonymous. The suffixes -tere/-tirya, in the case of a plural S/O argument, emphasize the fact that the totality of S/O referents are affected. The suffix -bare, on the other hand, emphasizes the fact that each S/O referent is individually affected, even though this often implies that all the referents are affected. We can compare the use of -tere in (7.4a) (repeated) with the use of -bare in (7.27). In (7.4a), what is emphasized is that the news of an imminent attack is making the whole group of S referents react (i.e., stand up). In contrast, in (7.27), what is emphasized is the fact that each S referent has been strongly affected by the fight with the anteater and, as a result, lies down for a rest.

Interestingly, I noted that the speakers occasionally reinforce the distributive and individuation meaning of -bare by a gesture pointing to various directions.
This difference between -tere/-tirya and -bare is also reflected in their respective morpho-syntax. For example, -bare cannot be used if the S/O argument does not have plural reference, as was possible with -tere/-tirya. Thus compare (7.1a) (repeated) with (7.28a) and the ungrammatical (7.28b):7

b. *Tiru-bare-wa [e-kwe budari]S.

Finally, corresponding to the suffix -bare, there is an independent transitive verb bare- meaning ‘pass, overtake’, as illustrated in (7.29). Another example of this verb can be seen (7.16b).

7 Although plurality is not obligatorily marked in an NP (see §13.3.1), it was clear from Francisco Vaca, who volunteered these examples (and gave a translation), that there was only one single banana involved in both (7.1a) and (7.28b).

206 7. Predicate structure — Aktionsart suffixes
Note that the meaning difference between the suffix and the verb is quite important. Nevertheless, the fact that both have to do with spatial notions suggests that a historical link between them is not impossible.

7.1.8. -(ne)ni ‘RANDOM’

The suffix -(ne)ni encodes the fact that the verb event is randomly distributed either over many different places or at many different times (often with habitual sense). The full form of the suffix, -neni, is used with monosyllabic roots, as in ju-neni- ‘roam’ in (7.30b), je-neni- ‘always come’ in (7.31b), etc. By contrast, the short form of the suffix, -ni, occurs with polysyllabic root/stems, as in tsajaja-ni- ‘run everywhere’ in (7.30a), ju-diru-ni- ‘always return’ in (7.31a), etc.
In (7.30), I illustrate the spatial sense of -(ne)ni with two intransitive verbs. Note that no examples of spatial meaning have been found with transitive verbs.

We can contrast -(ne)ni with -bare ‘DISTR’ (§7.1.7 above), which also has a component of ‘distribution’ in its meaning. The main difference is one of scope: the suffix -bare is argument-related — the distributed sense is about the S/O participants —, whereas -(ne)ni is event-related — the distributed sense is about

208 7. Predicate structure — Aktionsart suffixes

the event itself. The two suffixes can actually co-occur, each bringing its own specifications to the verb event, as in (7.33). For a discussion of ordering of Aktionsart suffixes, see §7.5.

There is a curious phenomenon that involves the full reduplication of a verb plus the -ni variant of the Aktionsart suffix -(ne)ni ‘RANDOM’. The meaning of this morpheme is apparently the same as the random suffix in its spatial meaning; that is, it encodes the fact that the verb event is randomly distributed over many different times (often with habitual sense). No significant differences have been found between the two. I illustrate the complex reduplication+random morpheme in (7.34) (with intransitive verbs) and (7.35) (with transitive verbs).

Note that although be- ‘bring’ and -ti ‘GO.TEMP’ exist independently in the language, it is possible that their combination (i.e., be-ti-) has undergone lexicalization, in which case the whole root is reduplicated. More work is needed to refine the status of be-ti- and to see whether other roots and suffixes can enter the reduplication+random process.
One might want to analyze the reduplication+random morpheme as being two different processes, in which the random suffix would apply after reduplication of the verb. The problem with that analysis is that a fully reduplicated verb root normally either yields an intransitive inflecting verb (with antipassive effect; §8.3.1) or a non-inflecting verb (taking an auxiliary; §10.6). None of these effects occur with the REDUP+RANDOM morpheme. Also, full reduplication normally produces two different phonological words. One consequence is that when monosyllablic elements are reduplicated, they are given an epenthetic vowel u (e.g., je-u-je-u ju- ‘come many times’, from je- ‘come’). This however does not happen with the REDUP+RANDOM morpheme as can be seen with kwakwa+ni- (*kwa-u-kwa-u-ni-) in (7.34a) and pa-pa+ni- (*pa-u-pa-u-ni) in (7.34b). The best analysis appears thus to consider reduplication together with ni as part of one unique morpheme.
Finally, there is no verb corresponding to either -ni or -neni.

210 7. Predicate structure — Aktionsart suffixes

7.1.9. Final syllable reduplication + causative

There is a complex morpheme which combines final syllable reduplication of a verb root and (presumably) the intransitive causativizer suffix -sha (i.e., the causativizer which only applies to intransitive verbs; see §8.4.1). This derivation process expresses the fact that the verb event is reiterated many times over the space or over the O argument referent. For example katsa- ‘beat, whip’ becomes katsa-tsa+sha- ‘beat up, batter’, jikwi- ‘cut off’ becomes jikwi-kwi+sha‘cut up’, and sabu- ‘grasp with findernails’ becomes sabu-bu+sha- ‘mix by squeezing’. Textual examples are provided below.
In (7.37), the O argument has singular reference. Here, the reduplication+causative suffix means that the verb event is distributed over many parts of the O referent.

8 I have not analyzed jimimisha as jimi-mi+sha because the form jimi is not attested independently in the available corpus. This requires more work.

7.1. Aktionsart suffixes of aspect/manner 211

In the available texts, the reduplication+causative derivation is only found with transitive verbs. In elicitation, however, Emeranciano Sepa provided me with three examples involving the intransitive verbs ani- ‘sit’, nubi- ‘enter’, and tsura- ‘go up’.

‘(Before you travel,) come over (to my house) and put it (all your belongings) up (in the loft).’ n5.1045

It is important to note that, synchronically, there is no productive process of derivation via final syllable reduplication (§5.2.4 and §5.5); none of the reduplicated forms exist on their own, i.e., without the causative marker (e.g., *tedi-di, *tsura-ra). It is thus best to think of a synchronically unique but internally complex suffix ‘REDUP+CAUS’.
It is not altogether clear how productive the reduplication+causative derivation is. In the data, it is found with about 30 verbs. In the texts, only transitive verbs are involved, and, I should add, only highly transitive ones, such as jikwi‘cut off’, katsa- ‘beat’, karu- ‘bite’, bere- ‘pierce’, mare- ‘shoot at’, etc. Through elicitation, Emeranciano Sepa gave me one example with the transitive ‘motion’ verb duju- ‘take’ and one with the perception verb peta- ‘look at’. In addition, as we saw, he also provided a handful of examples with intransitive verbs. More work is needed to refine the extent of the use of this process.
The internal shape of the transitive verbs listed in (7.40) reminds us of the reduplication+causative morpheme: they have a reduplicated syllable followed by a syllable sha. Nevertheless, the base to which the putative reduplication+causative morpheme could have been applied cannot be clearly identified (at least as an independent verb) in the corpus.

9 Note that there is an e-noun -jiruru ‘edge, banks (e.g., of a river)’ suggesting that the
origin of the verb jirurusha- could have involved a verbalization process; see §8.4.1
for a few more examples where -sha is used to verbalize a noun. 10 Note that there is a da-adjective juku- ‘loose’ that could have been at the origin of
jukukusha-.

212 7. Predicate structure — Aktionsart suffixes

7.2. Aktionsart suffixes of motion

The motion suffixes are probably the most noteworthy of all Aktionsart suffixes. They make a paradigm of eleven forms which are (normally) mutually exclusive and which have the function of associating a motion component to the event expressed by the verb stem they are attached to. In (7.41), for example, the suffixes -ti and -na convey the meaning that the subject of the verb ba- ‘see’ has changed its spatial location in order to realize the verb event of ‘seeing’.

The topic of motion suffixes in Cavineña is a fascinating one which immediately draws the attention of the investigator. A first article was published by Camp (1982), and I have myself written three more (Guillaume 2000b, 2006b, forthcoming-a). Nevertheless, I must admit that they are not yet fully understood. The following discussion, which summarizes my present understanding of the system, should therefore be taken as a work in progress.
The morphemes that I will be discussing here correspond to what has been identified in the literature on Australian languages as “associated motion” (Koch 1984; Tunbridge 1988; Wilkins 1991, 2006; Nordlinger 2001). They should not be confused with the better known category of directionals as found, for example, in Mayan languages (see Robertson 1980; Haviland 1991, 1993; Craig 1994; Zavala 1994), or Papua New Guinea languages (see Foley 1986: 148-52), and also expressed by English particles (e.g., in, out, away, up, down, etc.). “Associated motion” markers encode motion and path while directionals only encode path.11 The function of “associated motion” markers is to associate a motion component to a verb stem event, regardless of whether this event al-

11 The terms motion and path are used in the sense of Talmy (1985, 2000), as follows. Motion (here “translational” motion, as opposed to “self-contained” motion) refers to the spatiotemporal displacement of an entity (or figure) vis-à-vis a ground object, from a source (origin) to a target (goal, endpoint). Path concerns the specification of the course followed by the figure during its displacement with regards to different landmarks, e.g., vis-à-vis the deictic center (towards vs. away from), vis-à-vis an enclosure (in vs. out), vis-à-vis the vertical axis (up vs. down), etc.

ready involves motion or not. As such, they can be attached to all sorts of verbs, whether of motion (e.g., go and enter, go and turn, go and insert O, go and push O, go and lift O, etc.)12 or not (e.g., go and bathe, go and pee, go and sleep, go and see O, go and greet O, go and eat O, go and kill O, etc.). By contrast, directional markers can only specify the path of a motion that is already present in the verb stem event they are attached to. As such, they are restricted to motion verbs (e.g., move out, run away, push O in, throw O away, etc.). Note that Cavineña also has directional markers; however, they belong to a distinct paradigm/slot in the predicate structure (see Chapter 9).
“Associated motion” markers are rarely discussed in the typological literature. Yet they are very frequent in Amerindian languages. I have found them reported in at least the following languages (under various names, including the misleading term “directional”): Asheninca (Arawak, Peru, J. Payne 1982), Atsugewi (Hokan, California, Talmy 1985), Matses (Panoan, Peru, Fleck 2003: 364), Olutec (Mixe-Zoquean, Mexico, Zavala 2000), Oaxaca Chontal (Isolate, Mexico, O’Connor 2007) and Yagua (Peba-Yagua, Peru, T. Payne 1984).”associated motion.
The system formed by the eleven motion suffixes in Cavineña is semantically particularly complex. According to my present understanding, the suffixes are distinguished according to: 1 — the figure (moving entity): S/A or O argument; 2 — the manner of realization of the verb stem event: punctual or distributed; 3 — the orientation of the motion : ‘towards’ or ‘away from’ a reference point; 4 — the “stability” of the motion target: temporary or permanent; 5 — the location of the verb stem event vis-à-vis the target or the source of the
motion: ‘move and V’ or ‘V while moving’ or ‘V and move’ The full paradigm, organized according to these distinctions, is provided in Figure 7.1. The first opposition distinguishes suffixes that involve the motion of the subject (S/A-related); from those that involve the motion of the object (O-related). S/A-related suffixes can be further subdivided between those that imply that the verb stem event is realized in a punctual way — they are discussed in §7.2.1 — from those that imply that the verb stem event is realized in a distributed way — they are discussed in §7.2.2. O-related motion suffixes are discussed in §7.2.3.
12 There is a restriction, however: motion suffixes cannot (normally) be attached to the deictic verbs kwa- ‘go (temporarily)’, je- ‘come (temporarily)’, diru- ‘go (permanently)’ and jeti- ‘come (permanently)’.

7.2.1. S/A-related motion suffixes - punctual verb stem event

The six motion suffixes listed in Table 7.1 have in common that they all encode a motion that applies to the S/A argument; and imply that the verb event is realized punctually (i.e., it only happens once).

Table 7.1. S/A-related motion suffixes - punctual realization

-ti/-nati -diru -na -eti -kena

‘GO.TEMP’ ‘GO.PERM’ ‘COME.TEMP’ ‘COME.PERM’ ‘LEAVE’

These suffixes contrast with one another according to three features: (1) the orientation of the motion (§7.2.1.1), (2) the “stability” of the location that is targeted by the motion (§7.2.1.2), and (3) the location of the verb stem event vis-à-vis the target or the source of the motion (§7.2.1.3).

7.2.1.1. Orientation of the motion

The first five suffixes of Table 7.1 specify a motion that is deictically oriented, i.e., directed either away from or towards the deictic center (DC). By default, the DC is the location of the speaker at the time of speech. With the three suffixes -ti, -nati and -diru, the motion is directed away from the DC. With the two suffixes -na and -eti, the motion is directed towards the DC.
The pair of examples in (7.42) illustrate the deictic contrast between -ti and -na.

7.2.1.2. “Stability” of the targeted location

The first five suffixes of Table 7.1 specify a motion that targets different kinds of locations in terms of their “stability”. With the three suffixes -ti, -nati and -na the motion leads to “unstable” (temporary) locations. This means that the S/A argument will perform the verb stem event at the location indicated by the suffix but will not stay there; the next event the S/A argument will be involved in should take place at some other location (often, although not always, the original location). By contrast, with the two suffixes -diru and -eti, the motion leads to “stable” (permanent) locations. This means that the S/A argument will remain at the location indicated by the suffix, and the next event(s) the S/A argument will be involved in (if any) will take place at that location.
The two examples (7.42a) and (7.42b) above illustrate motions that target “unstable” locations. In (7.42a), with -ti, the request for the addressee to move to the Chácobo people’s village only implies a short visit; the addressee will soon return to his home base. Similarly, in (7.42b), with -na, the addressee is not expected to stay much longer at the place he is requested to move; after having seen the porcupine, he will go back to sleep.
By constrast, the motion encoded by the suffixes -diru in (7.43a) and -eti in (7.43b) lead to “stable” locations.

In (7.43a), ani-diru-wa depicts the event of settling into a new and long-lasting location — the place refers to Mision Cavinas, which is still nowadays a Cavineña community. In (7.43b), the motion expressed by -eti leads the narrator’s older brother back to his home, again with the idea that this is for him a location of long duration.

7.2.1.3. Location of the verb stem event vis-à-vis the source and/or the target of the motion

A further semantic distinction runs through part of the system of motion suffixes. It has to do with specifying where the verb stem event takes place vis-àvis the source and/or the target of the motion. This feature allows us to distinguish -ti from -nati, on the one hand, and -kena from the rest of the suffixes, on the other hand, as follows:

1 — the suffix -ti requires the verb stem event to take place at the target of the motion; this is generally translatable in English by ‘go and/to V, arrive and V, V while arriving’; 2 — the suffix -nati requires the verb stem event to take place between the source and the target of the motion; this is generally translatable by ‘V while going, V on the way’; 3 — the suffix -kena requires the verb stem event to take place at the source of the motion; this is generally translatable in English by ‘V and move, V while leaving’.

I will start by discussing the distinction between -ti and -nati. The difference can be seen by comparing the verb ‘see’ with -ti in (7.44a), and with -nati in (7.44b).

In (7.44a), the verb event of ‘seeing (an egret)’ occurs once the protagonist (first person singular in A function) has arrived at the place he intended to reach, namely a fishing spot at the lake. By contrast, in (7.44b), when the protagonist (also a first person singular in A function) realizes the event of ‘seeing (a coati in a saltlick)’, he has not reached its intended destination, namely the settlement where his family lives.

The difference in location of the verb stem event vis-à-vis the motion target is the only difference that I could find between -ti and -nati. Except for this feature, these two suffixes are semantically identical — they both imply a punctual verb stem event, a motion involving the S/A argument, directed away from the DC, and targeting an “unstable” location. In addition to their semantic similarity, -nati and -ti are also quite similar formally: the last syllable of -nati is identical in shape to the suffix -ti. Since the first syllable of -nati is formally identical to the independent motion suffix -na ‘COME.TEMP’, one wonders whether -nati could not be analyzed as the combination of the two suffixes -na and -ti. Although tempting, I will refrain from such an interpretation, at least from a synchronic perspective, on the basis that -na and -ti have diametrically opposed semantic values in terms of deixis: -na manifests a motion directed towards the DC while -ti manifests a motion directed away from the DC. As such, it is hard to see how their combination could yield the meaning of -nati.

220 7. Predicate structure — Aktionsart suffixes

With the other motion suffixes -na, -diru and -eti, the verb stem event can occur either at the target of the motion or between the source and the target of the motion. In other words, the distinction is neutralized — the exact reading is disambiguated from the context. Illustrative examples are given below, for each suffix. Examples illustrating the suffix -na ‘COME.TEMP’ in situations where the verb stem event takes place at the target of the motion are given in (7.47) (see also (7.41b)).

The way to ‘say goodbye’ in Cavineña makes use of the verb isara- ‘talk to’ and the suffix -kena, i.e., literally ‘talk to and leave’.

Note that with -kena, the distinctions that hold for (at least some of) the other motion suffixes are neutralized: the motion is not deictically anchored and the target of the motion is not specified for its “stability”. This is suggested by the pair of (elicited) examples in (7.56).

In (7.56a), we can see -kena used in the situation of a motion directed away from the DC and towards a “stable” target, as shown by the main verb diru- ‘go (permanently)’ in the following clause. In (7.56b), -kena is used in the situation of a motion directed towards the DC, and towards an “unstable” target, as shown by the use of the main verb je- ‘come (temporarily)’ in the following clause.

7.2.1.4. Expression of ‘arrive’ and ‘leave’

The Cavineña lexicon does not have any specific verb for expressing the concepts of ‘arrive, reach’ and ‘leave, depart’. The way these meanings are expressed involves the motion suffixes. The way the meaning ‘arrive, reach’ is rendered is with a motion suffix and the verb ju- ‘be’. We therefore have as many ways to express the concept of ‘arriving, reach’ as there are semantic distinctions made by motion suffixes, as illustrated below.

There is no intransitive verb ‘leave, depart’ in Cavineña.13 In order to express this meaning specifically, the suffix -kena is attached to an intransitive motion verb such as aje- ‘walk, go slowly’, tsajaja- ‘run’, or the deictic verbs kwa- ‘go (temporarily)’, je- ‘come (temporarily)’, diru- ‘go (permanently)’ or jeti- ‘come (permanently)’, as illustrated in (7.58).

7.2.1.5. Origin

Only two of the motion suffixes discussed above have a possible corresponding independent verb: -diru, which corresponds to the intransitive verb diru- ‘go (permanently)’, and -eti, which corresponds to the intransitive verb -jeti ‘come (permanently)’, minus the glottal fricative j. No corresponding forms have been identified for -ti, -nati and -na and -kena. The two verbs are illustrated in (7.59).

7.2. Aktionsart suffixes of motion 227

7.2.2. S/A-related motion suffixes - distributed verb stem event

The suffixes that I have been discussing thus far imply that the verb stem event is punctual; that is, it takes place only once in a particular location somewhere along a motion path, either at the source, or at the target, or in between. By contrast, the three suffixes listed in Table 7.2 imply that the verb stem event is distributed or realized continuously between the source and the target of the motion.

Table 7.2. S/A-related motion suffixes - distributed realization

-aje -be -etibe

‘GO.DISTR’ ‘COME.TEMP.DISTR’ ‘COME.PERM.DISTR’

The difference between these three suffixes and those discussed above can be illustrated with the pair of examples in (7.60). These two examples come from the same narrative and are separated by two intervening sentences. Here, a hunter is walking along a path in the forest in search of some game animal. At some point, he spots some animal traces on the ground and follows them. The action of the hunter’s progressive discovering of the traces, as he moves ahead, is rendered, as we can see in (7.60a), by the verb ba- and the motion suffix -aje (lit. to see many times while going). Three sentences later, we learn that, after having followed those traces for a while, the hunter comes across a bunch of animal bones in a clearing. As we can see in (7.60b), this is rendered by the narrator with the same verb ba-; however, here he uses the motion suffix -nati, in order to indicate that he sees/discovers all the bones at the same time.

228 7. Predicate structure — Aktionsart suffixes

We can say that in (7.60a), -aje expresses the fact that the A argument (the hunter) repeats the event of ‘seeing’ in multiple places located along a motion path before the intended target is reached. As such we can also say that with the suffixes -aje, -be and -etibe, like with the suffix -nati, the motion and the verb stem event are temporally simultaneous, the difference being that with the first three suffixes, the verb event is broken up into multiple instances which implies many locations for it realization.
In (7.61), from a different story, the narrator uses ba-aje ‘see-GO.DISTR’ to describe the situation of spying birds in the forest (in order to kill them).

The example in (7.62), made up by Francisco Vaca, with -be marking the verb neti- ‘stand’, depicts the action of stopping many times along a motion path.

In some examples involving the suffixes -aje, -be and -etibe, the verb stem event is not, strictly speaking, repeated, but rather realized continuously or progressively along the motion path. In (7.63), the narrator tells us how two fishermen in a frail canoe were once dragged by an enormous fish that had caught their line. This is rendered by using the verb tinu- ‘pull’ and the suffix -aje, in order to express the fact that the pulling action is realized continuously.

The three suffixes -aje, -be and -etibe, similary to those that imply a punctual verb stem event, are sensitive to the orientation of the motion (§7.2.2.1) as well as the “stability” of the targeted location (§7.2.2.2).

7.2.2.1. Orientation of the motion
The motion associated to a (distributed) verb stem event is oriented away from the DC with -aje and towards the DC with -be and -etibe, as illustrated the pair of examples (7.5a) (repeated) and (7.66).

‘My daughter was coming back to me, running now and then, miserably (through the terrible pampa path, in order to meet me back).’ ka018

In both examples, the narrator is a protagonist of the story and the DC corresponds to his location in the scenes depicted here. In (7.5a), -aje manifests the fact that the S argument (the jaguar) is moving away from the narrator (who shot him), therefore away from the DC. In (7.66), -be encodes the fact that the S argument (the narrators’ daughter) is moving towards the narrator, therefore towards the DC.

7.2.2.2. “Stability” of the targeted location

The motion associated to a (distributed) verb stem event is targeting an “unstable” (temporary) location with -be and a “stable” (permanent) location with -etibe; with -aje the “stability” distinction is neutralized. The contrast between -be and -etibe can be illustrated by comparing (7.66) and (7.67). In (7.66), the narrator uses -be because the daughter, after having met with her mother, i.e., after having reached the target of the motion encoded by -be, will resume the trip (with her mother), in other words immediately move to a different place. On the other hand, in (7.67), where the targeted location is the narrator’s home, the suffix -etibe is used to manifest the fact that this is the ultimate destination of the narrator.

‘(“Here is the path!”) I said and I decided to come (lit. I came) back. So I came back searching for the path but couldn’t find it.’ pe031-032

In (7.69), the motion associated to the verb stem event ‘be beaten / beat oneself’ is one of falling to the ground, which is, by definition, a very “stable” location.

‘(Falling from the tree) with the mango that I was holding (in my hand), I beat myself on the branches one after another.’ mg017

One will have noted that, formally, -etibe is made of eti, that is formally identical to the motion suffix -eti ‘COME.PERM’, and -be, that is formally identical to the motion suffix -be ‘COME.TEMP.DISTR’. This could suggest interpreting -etibe as a combination of these two suffixes. Here again, I have opted for a unitary synchronic analysis, since it is hard to see how the meaning of -etibe could be generated from the independent meaning of -eti and -be taken separately, since they differ in two crucial respects: the “stability” of the motion target — “stable” with -eti; “unstable” with -na — and the manner of realiza-

232 7. Predicate structure — Aktionsart suffixes

tion or the verb stem event — distributed with -eti; punctual with -na. As I said, the distinction between a motion that leads to a “stable” and an
“unstable” location is neutralized with the suffix -aje: the targeted location is “unstable” in (7.60a), since the hunter will not stay much longer at the place where he found the bones, and “stable” in (7.66a), since the jaguar is about to die, in which case he will not be involved in any further events and/or locations.

7.2.2.3. Grammaticalization

In some examples, the suffix-aje has uses and meanings that do not fully conform to those of other motion suffixes. Here I will analyze these instances as evidence for grammaticalization towards a pure aspectual (distributive) marker or manner marker, meaning something like “slowly”.
Normally, as I said above (footnote 12), motion suffixes cannot be attached to deictic verbs. In (7.70), however, -aje is found with the deictic verb diru- ‘go (permanently)’.

‘Then I went back slowly (lit. little by little) to the corral (unaware that a nasty cow wanted to gore me).’ vc030

Motion suffixes normally form a paradigm of mutually exclusive members. Yet, in (7.71), the same -aje is found in combination with the motion suffix -na ‘COME.TEMP’.

‘(I was trying to talk to my wife secretly because I had deserted the army. But she didn’t recognize me so she asked her mother:) mother, who is it that came talking secretly to me?’ gu113

Finally, there are examples where neither the verb stem event nor the “motion” suffix -aje express any motion, as in (7.72a) and (7.72b).

As for the suffix -etibe, there is no identifiable independent verb. Rather, this suffix appears to be made of a frozen combination of two suffixes: -eti ‘come (permanently)’ (§7.2) and -be ‘COME.TEMP.DISTR’.

7.2.3. O-related motion suffixes
The last two motion suffixes, -tsa and -dadi, contrast with all the others by specifying that the motion is that of the O argument of a transitive verb.

234 7. Predicate structure — Aktionsart suffixes

Table 7.3. O-related motion suffixes

-tsa -dadi

‘COME(O)’ ‘GO(O)’

These two suffixes have the following semantic and distributional characteristics:

1 — they are only used with transitive verbs; 2 — the orientation of the motion is not deictic: the reference point is the location of the A argument, regardless of the location of the speaker; 3 — the verb stem event is realized punctually; 4 — there is no distinction in terms of the “stability” of the targeted location nor in terms of the location of the verb stem event vis-à-vis the source or the target of the motion.

The suffix -tsa encodes the fact that the A argument is acting over an O argument that is moving towards it. By contrast, -dadi manifests the fact that the A argument is acting over an O argument that is moving away from it. The semantic difference between -tsa and -dadi is illustrated in (7.74).

person =3SG-FM (=1SG-ERG) see-GO(O)-PERF

‘I saw a man going away from me (with the duck he had stolen).’ ju008

With -tsa in (7.74a), the meaning is that the O argument (the entity that is seen) has moved some distance towards the A argument (the entity that sees). On the other hand, with (7.74b), the meaning is that the O argument has moved away from the A argument.
In other words, -tsa encodes the fact that during the time that the A argument realizes the event expressed by the verb stem, the O argument has changed its spatial location in such a way that it is closer to the A argument than it was at the preceding time. In contrast, -dadi expresses the fact that, as the A argument realizes the event expressed by the verb stem, the O argument has changed its

7.2. Aktionsart suffixes of motion 235

spatial location in such a way that it is now farther away from A argument than it was at the preceding time.
The fact that we are dealing with the motion of the O and not that of the A argument permits the use of -tsa or -dadi in events where the A argument is necessarily motionless, as (7.75a) and (7.75b).

‘Hei (the nephew, lying half-dead on the ground) could hardly talk to his unclej when hej leant over towards himi.’ hm165

In (7.75a), -tsa encodes the fact that in order for the A argument (a motionless liana) to realized the verb stem event (grabbing), the O argument (the narrator) has changed its location so as to be in contact with the A argument. Similary, in (7.75b), -tsa expresses the fact that in order for the A argument (the motionless nephew) to realize the verb stem event (greet), the O argument (the uncle) has changed its location so as to be closer to the A argument than the preceding time.
Note that with -tsa and -dadi, the verb stem event takes place either at the target of the notion, as in (7.75a,b), or between the source and the target of the motion, as in (7.74a,b).
Additional examples of -tsa can be found in various examples throughout this study; e.g., karu-jeri-tsa-kware ‘(the rattlesnake) almost bit (Tata Crisanto, as he reached it)’ in (7.14a), a-tsa-ya ‘(I) will tell (brother Antonio when he arrives)’ in (6.9a), dunu-tsa-chine ‘(my daughters) surrounded (me, when I arrived home)’ in (13.49c), tya-tsa-kware ‘(the Chácobo people) gave (us a place to sleep, as we arrived at their village)’ in (15.20a), baka-tsa-kware ‘(our Cavineña ancestors) heard something (walking in their direction)’ in (19.21b), ina-tsa-chine ‘(I) received (the package that you sent me)’ in (20.24b).
Additional examples with -dadi are provided in (7.76).

7.3. Aktionsart suffixes of time of day
Four verbal suffixes encode the fact that the verb event is performed at, or is somehow associated with, a particular time of the day. The suffixes differ according to two dimensions: (1) time of day: dawn (-wekaka) vs. dusk (-apuna) vs. day (-chinepe) vs. night (-sisa) and (2) aspect: punctual (-wekaka and -apuna) vs. prolonged (-sisa and -chinepe). This is summarized in Table 7.4.

238 7. Predicate structure — Aktionsart suffixes

Note that reference to dawn is made twice in sentence (7.79a). It is made by the suffix -wekaka as well as by the independent verb wekaka- ‘be at dawn’14 in a periphrastic adverbial clause. This is typical of many examples. One might wonder what is the rationale for such redundancy. The reason for this is that in addition to specifying dawn-time, the suffix -wekaka appears to have the sense of ‘first thing in the morning’. In (7.79a), it would mean something like ‘the first thing he saw was the skin of this wife’. In other words, he did not see anything else before seeing the skin of his wife. And, probably, this also conveys an emotional effect for depicting the horrible vision of seeing one’s spouse reduced to a skin on the ground.
The use of -wekaka with kwa- ‘go’, as in (7.78a), could also have the ‘first thing in the morning’ effect; having personally taken part in the journey related in the text from which this example comes from, I clearly remember that the crew resumed the trip right after waking up, without taking any breakfast or anything.
We can compare (7.78a) with (7.80), below, where we have a similar periphrasic mention of dawn-time but where we do not have the -wekaka suffix on the verb kwa-. In (7.80), unlike in (7.78a), some time and some activities, such as taking a bathe, having breakfast, etc. could have taken place between the waking up of the protagonist and the departure for a hunting excursion.

An interesting semantic effect is found with tawi- ‘sleep’ where tawi-wekakameans ‘oversleep’. Note that Cavineña people tend to wake up before dawn so that it makes sense that ‘waking at dawn’ means having slept more than is normally expected.
The suffix -apuna encodes the fact that the verb event occurs at or is somehow associated with dusk. I unfortunately only have very few examples of this suffix. It is illustrated in (7.81) (with intransitive verbs) and (7.82) (with a transitive verb).

14 The verb wekaka- ‘be at dawn’, which can also mean ‘wake up’, is most likely the source of the suffix -wekaka, see below.

Note that there is redundant reference to night-time in (7.84a) with the time of day particle meta ‘at night’. But again, in addition to night-time, the morpheme -sisa specifies that the verb event occurs all night long and not just at some point during the night. The particle meta, on the other hand, only specifies night-time and nothing else, as in (7.85) below where there is no suffix -sisa. In this example, nothing implies whether ‘I’ hunted all night or for just a few hours.

As already mentioned (see footnote 14), the suffix -wekaka corresponds to the intransitive verb wekaka- ‘be at dawn’. This verb accepts either an impersonal subject (‘it was dawn, dawn broke’) or a personal one (‘we were at dawn, we woke up at dawn’). As for the suffix -apuna it corresponds to the intransitive verb apuna- ‘be at dusk, become dark’ (itself a verbalised adjective, apu‘dark’ + -na ‘VBLZ’; §5.2.3). Both independent verbs are illustrated in (7.86).

7.4. Aktionsart suffix of emotion 241
There are no obvious verbs corresponding directly to either -chinepe ‘ALL.DAY’ or -sisa ‘ALL.NIGHT’. Possibly, -chinepe comes from the intransitive verb chine-, a synonym of apuna-, meaning ‘be at dusk’ with a formative ending pe ‘different from’ (see §12.7.8).

7.4. Aktionsart suffix of emotion

The suffix -jara/-wana ‘ADVERSative’ expresses a wide range of emotions, mostly negative, that the speaker has concerning the verb event or the non-A argument referent (the S argument referent of an intransitive verb, or the O argument referent of a transitive verb). The form -jara is used with intransitive verbs while the form -wana is used with transitive verbs.
The most common emotion expressed by -jara/-wana is anger, as illustrated in (7.87) (intransitive verbs).

‘Keep laughing and I will whip you right away, damn it! (my father told my mother, who was laughing at him because he came home soaking wet, having fallen in a stream).’ ca012

Note that -wana is external to the situation related. Unless the speaker is an argument of the verb event himself (as in (7.88b,c), for example), the emotional content expressed by -wana is not experienced by the protagonists but by the speaker only. This is shown by (7.88a), where the A argument (someone from the village) still does not know who the O argument is (a dangerous traitor) at the time of the story. As a consequence, it cannot be said that the feeling of anger is felt by the A argument referent. The narrator, on the other hand, does know who the O argument is and he uses the suffix -wana on the verb ba- ‘see’ to express his emotion.
In the following, I illustrate -jara/-wana expressing various nuances of discontent (other than anger): disgust in (7.89), regret in (7.90), pity in (7.91), disappointment in (7.92)), confusion in (7.93)) and distrust in (7.94).

The suffix -wana is most likely part of the non-segmentable verb ijiryawana- ‘make fun of O’ although the ijirya part of the word cannot be identified outside of this verb.
The origin of -jari/-wana is a rather surprising one. It comes from the intransitive/transitive pair of postural verbs jara- ‘lie’ and wana- ‘lay O’ illustrated in (7.95).

7.5. Distribution

Aktionsart suffixes occupy slot H of the predicate. It is quite common for two (or even three) Aktionsart suffixes to co-occur in a single verb. In (7.96), I illustrate various combinations of the suffixes -tere ‘COMP’, -aje ‘GO.DISTR’, -bare ‘DISTR’, -eti ‘COME.PERM’ and -nuka ‘REITR’.

There do not appear to be strict ordering restrictions. For example, we have the order -bare-eti in (7.96b) and the reverse order -eti-bare in (7.96c). A difference in order tends to correlate with a meaning difference. In (7.96b) where -eti ‘COME.PERM’ has scope over -bare ‘DISTR’, the ‘coming’ motion is not distributed; the missionary lady and the two Cavineña women are on their way back home. In (7.96c), on the other hand, where -bare has scope over -eti, the coming motion is distributed; each person moves to one side of the table and sits.
Some suffixes encode different values of a system. These (normally) never co-occur. This is the case with motion suffixes. For example, the verb peta‘look at O’ can take the motion suffix -diru ‘GO.PERM’ (peta-diru- ‘go and look

246 7. Predicate structure — Aktionsart suffixes

at O’). It can also take the motion suffix -tsa ‘GO(O)’ (peta-tsa- ‘look at O while O is going away’). However, peta- cannot take both suffixes at the same time (*peta-diru-tsa- or *peta-tsa-diru-).
There are at least five paradigms of mutually exclusive suffixes, as follows:

— (in)completive suffixes (§7.1.1):

-tere/-tirya ‘COMPletive’ -bisha ‘INCOMPletive’

— ‘start’ vs. ‘stop’ suffixes (§7.1.2):

-jaka ‘STOP’ -tibune ‘START’

— ‘short time’ vs. ‘long time’ suffixes (§7.1.5):

-baka ‘SHORT.TIME’ -siri ‘LONG.TIME’

— motion suffixes (§7.2):

-nati/-ti ‘GO.TEMP(orarily)’ -diru ‘GO.PERM(anently)’ -na ‘COME.TEMP(orarily)’ -eti ‘COME.PERM(anently)’ -aje ‘GO.DISTR’

-be ‘COME.TEMP.DISTR’ -etibe ‘COME.PERM.DISTR’ -kena ‘LEAVE’ -tsa ‘COME(O)’ -dadi ‘GO(O)’

— time of day suffixes (§7.3):

-wekaka ‘AT.DAWN’ -apuna ‘AT.DUSK’

-chinepe ‘ALL.DAY’ -sisa ‘ALL.NIGHT’

More work is required to find out whether the remaining suffixes, e.g., -jeri/-neri ‘ALMOST’, -nuka ‘REITR’, -wisha ‘FAST’, -bare ‘DISTR’, etc., belong to one of these paradigms, form additional paradigms, or simply form a paradigm by themselves (i.e., one suffix = one ‘paradigm’).
Table 7.5 shows all attested combinations of two Aktionsart suffixes (from different paradigms) found in texts and supplemented by some combinations obtained through elicitation (the full list of elicited combinations is given in (7.97) — note that no systematic attempt was made to investigate all possible

Combinations not found are coded with a question mark ‘?’. Note that an Aktionsart suffix never occurs more than once within a verb/predicate (as coded by a shaded cell). The glosses that correspond to the suffixes are reproduced below the table.

The table shows that the suffixes to the right of the table, notably the motion suffixes and the suffix -nuka ‘REITR’, can apparently be combined with all other suffixes. They also tend to have scope over (i.e., follow) the other suffixes. They will be called high-scope suffixes. By contrast the suffixes to the left of the table, such as -tere/-tirya/-bisha ‘(IN)COMP’, time of day suffixes, or -wisha ‘FAST’, are hardly ever found in combination with any other suffixes. They also tend to fall under the scope of (i.e., precede) the other suffixes. They will be called low-scope suffixes. When low-scope suffixes can follow (i.e., have scope over) high-scope suffixes the reverse order is always attested.
Note that the table does not take into account suffixes occurring on the copula/auxiliary verb ju- ‘be’, as this verb tends to have idiosyncratic properties and is not representative of regular verbs of the language. For example ju- allows motion suffixes to be followed by -tere ‘COMP’, as in ju-eti-tere- (beCOME.PERM-COMP-), or by -(ne)ni ‘RANDOM’, as in ju-diru-ni- (be-GO.PERMRANDOM-) (see (7.31a)), whereas these sequences are never attested with other verbs.
Aktionsart suffixes can also combine with other verbal suffixes, presumably with semantic restrictions. Combinations with postural/directional suffixes (slot F) illustrated in this chapter are reported in (7.98). For additional examples, see §9.3.

7.6. Suffixes vs. compounded/serialized verbs? 251
Combinations with auxiliary-changing processes are illustrated in §10.8.
7.6. Suffixes vs. compounded/serialized verbs?
As we have seen, many suffixes have a corresponding independent verb. This brings up the question of whether the Aktionsart morphemes should rather be analyzed as compounded/serialized verbs instead of suffixes. According to the typological literature on verb serialization (see, for example, Aikhenvald 1999, 2006), they could be analyzed as asymmetrical serial verbs since one verb comes from a large and open class — any verb can be the first verb in Cavineña — and the other from a restricted class — we only have about 30 Aktionsart suffixes. Semantically, the verb from the non-restricted class denotes the event and provides the transitivity value for the whole construction, whereas the verb from the closed class only provides a modification.
This analysis is however not retained here, for the main reason that such a process is not productive in Cavineña. First, we lack an equivalent verb for many suffixes (roughly half of them), as shown in Table 7.6, which summarizes the suffixes and their corresponding verbs (when available). Often we miss forms within a single paradigm. If we look at the paradigm of eleven motion suffixes (S/A- and O-related), for example, we only have corresponding verbs for five of them (-diru, -jeti, -aje, -be and -dadi). For the rest (-nati, -ti, -na, -kena, -etibe and -tsa), no independent verbs are attested. If we had true serialization, we should expect other deictic verbs such as je- ‘come (temporarily)’ or kwa- ‘go (temporarily)’ to form part of the paradigm. And, crucially, these two verbs would be expected instead of -na and -nati/-ti respectively since they have the exact same semantics (motion directed away from the DC and targeting a temporary location).
Second, at least one suffix (-eti ‘COME.PERM’) shows phonological erosion from its corresponding verb (jeti- ‘come (permanently)’), a fact that we would not expect if we had productive serialization.
Third, in addition to the fact that no corresponding forms are attested for many Aktionsart suffixes, when we do have some possible forms, they very often have quite different semantics. Thus note the difference between the verb dadi- ‘find’ and the suffix -dadi ‘action performed while O is moving away from A’, the verb baka- ‘listen, hear, ask, understand’ and the suffix -baka ‘a short time’, the verb wisha- ‘shake’ and the corresponding suffix -wisha ‘action performed rapidly’, the verb bare- ‘pass’ and the corresponding suffix -bare ‘verb event distributed over S/O referent’, etc.

252 7. Predicate structure — Aktionsart suffixes

7.6. Suffixes vs. compounded/serialized verbs? 253 For all these reasons, an analysis in terms of suffixes is preferred and adopted here, even though it is highly possible that verb serialization is a very likely scenario for the diachronic origin of such forms, and what we see is an advanced stage of grammaticalization.15 Comparative and historical work is however needed to confirm this hypothesis.
15 A similar phenomenon appears to have occurred with Japanese where the verbal suffixes, according to some scholars (e.g., Quinn 1990) originated as serial verbs.

Chapter 8 Predicate structure — valency-changing mechanisms

The range of devices that have valency-modifying effects in Cavineña are morphological — verbal affixes in slot C/G of the predicate, or reduplication of a verb root — as well as syntactic — the exchange of auxiliaries.
There are three valency-reducing mechanisms, passive, reflexive/reciprocal and antipassive, and one valency-increasing mechanism, causative, as shown in Table 8.1. There is no applicative mechanism.

Causative

-sha/-mere/-kere

Valency-reducing mechanisms are discussed first: passive in §8.1, reflexive in §8.2 and antipassive in §8.3. The valency-increasing mechanism, causative, is discussed in §8.4.
Both inflecting verbs and non-inflecting verbs behave similarly with respect to passive, reflexive and causative. With respect to antipassive, however, inflecting verbs and non-inflecting verbs behave differently: the antipassive of an inflecting verb is realized by reduplication, while the antipassive of a noninflecting verb is realized by exchanging the transitive auxiliary (a- ‘affect’) for the intransitive auxiliary (ju- ‘be’).
It is possible to have a combination of two valency-changing mechanisms. This is discussed in §8.5.

1 Note that an a ending has been identified as a causative formative in a few transitive verbs (e.g., nitya- ‘stand O’ from neti- ‘stand’; see §5.2.6). This formative, which appears to have been a causativizer of intransitive verbs, is totally unproductive synchronically and is not further discussed in this chapter.

256 8. Predicate structure — Valency-changing mechanisms

8.1. Passive -ta(na)

The suffix -ta(na) applies almost exclusively to transitive (or ditransitive) verbs.2 It can be called a passive marker since it turns a transitive verb into an intransitive one with the original O argument becoming the S argument of the derived verb and the original A argument being obligatorily omitted. The basic syntax of the passive derivation is illustrated with a pair of elicited examples in (5.1).

b. KashiS

ara-tana-ya.

sweet.banana eat-PASS-IMPFV

‘Sweet bananas are eaten.’ n2.0511

The difference between the -tana and -ta variants is not clear. They both occur in the same phonological environments and with the same meaning (see below). All I can say at this stage is that the form -tana is used much more frequently than -ta. In this work, they are treated as free variants of the same morpheme.
The suffix -ta(na) has two major functions, which partly depend on the semantic type of the verb it applies to. These are, in terms of Dixon and Aikhenvald’s (2000) terminology, an agentless function and an anticausative function:3

1 — agentless function: the passive encodes the fact that the identity of the agent in a transitive event is left unexpressed, even though its action over the patient is still part of the meaning of the event; 2 — anticausative function: the passive encodes the fact that the event is not carried out by any agent (original A) but instead by the patient itself (original O) spontaneously.

The two types of functions are illustrated in turn below.

2 A handful of exceptions are discussed at the end of the section. 3 Note that when compared with passives in other languages, the range of functions of
the Cavineña passive is quite restricted. Unlike other languages, there is no particular emphasis on the resulting state. Such a function is encoded by (derived) resultative adjectives (§11.3.4). Also, the Cavineña passive does not strictly speaking focus on the O argument, since there is no specific agent to contrast it with, and it does not have any particular discourse function, such as topicalization functions.

8.1 Passive -ta(na) 257

8.1.1. Agentless passive

The agentless function of the Cavineña passive can be seen in example (8.2) below, which comes from a description of a traditional Cavineña cart (in a photo). In this sentence, the cart is used as the underlying O of the transitive verb tsume- ‘use’. An agent is still semantically implied to perform such a event, since a cart cannot perform the event of ‘using’ by itself. However, it does not refer to any particular referent; the agent is any person owning such a cart.

‘For that reason (that in Cavineña communities, there aren’t any motorized vehicles), this (rudimentary) cart is used in these places.’ ft023

Example (8.3) below comes from a procedural text on how to make a traditional canoe. In the two sentences here, the canoe is the underlying O of the two transitive verbs rure- ‘carve’ and a- ‘affect’. Here again, an agent is semantically implied to perform such actions; a canoe cannot ‘carve’ or ‘make’ by itself. However, since the narrator is talking about a technique or procedure, the agent can be anybody involved in these activities, in which case the passive is used in order to leave the agent’s identity unexpressed.

The examples in (8.4) below come from a story which relates how one day (in the olden days) a group of Cavineñas were ambushed by wild enemies and were all killed, and how the remaining Cavineñas decided, as a result, to settle in a different place. In this story, the enemies are never explicitely mentioned,

258 8. Predicate structure — Valency-changing mechanisms

probably because their true identity was never known. In clauses where the Cavineñas are the underlying O of transitive verbs and where the enemies are the agent, a passive form of the verb is used.

There are rather few examples with passivized non-inflecting verbs. In all the examples available, the passive derivation is combined with other morphological processes. In (8.5) we have the passivization of jucha a- ‘have sex with O’ — which becomes jucha a-ta- ‘have sex’ — followed by the suffixation of the auxiliary-triggering negative desiderative marker -karama ‘DESID.NEG’ (§10.1.1) — resulting in jucha a-ta-karama ju- ‘refuse to have sex’.5

4 Tibarirya- ‘go around’ is transitive in Cavineña. 5 Note that the translation of jucha a- with the English intransitive verb ‘have sex with’
somehow blurs the derivation that is occurring in this example. A more precise and
more revealing — although ruder — translation would be ‘fuck O’. As such, jucha
a-ta- means ‘be fucked’ and jucha a-ta-karama ju- means ‘refuse to be fucked’.

In (8.6) the verb katsa- ‘beat O’ is first fully reduplicated, giving katsa-katsa a‘beat O repeatedly’, i.e., a non-inflecting derived verb — see §10.6 on the auxiliary-triggering process of full reduplication. It is then passivized into katsakatsa a-tana- ‘be beaten repeatedly’.

8.1.2. Anticausative passive
The anticausative function of the Cavineña passive is illustrated in the following examples. In (8.8a), the speaker relates an event when he fell from a tree and hit the branches on his way down. He uses the verb katsa- ‘beat, whip’ with the passive suffix. In (8.8b), quite similarly, the speaker relates the event of bumping into and getting caught in lianas, which is described by using the transitive verb karya- ‘hook’ with the passive suffix. In both examples, the protago-

260 8. Predicate structure — Valency-changing mechanisms

nist is the underlying O of the verb and is also the instigator of the ‘hitting’ event, not the branches or the lianas.6 In other words, there is no agent involved,
either formally or semantically.

Examples (8.9a), volunteered by Francisco Vaca, and (8.9b) below further illustrate underlyingly transitive events that happen spontaneously without the intervention of an agent.

6 Neither ‘the branches’ nor the ‘the lianas’ (both in locative case) can be agents (either formally or semantically) because the verbs katsa- ‘beat’ and karya- ‘hook’ obligatorily require animate agentive subjects.
7 The choice of the verb katsa- ‘beat’ to depict this situation is an interesting one. The speaker could have chosen a more direct way with a different ‘hitting’ verb which does not require an agentive (i.e., acting with intention) subject (such as chika- ‘bump into’) and would not have required passive morphology. The choice of katsa- suggests that the event of ‘hitting the branches’ is like being ‘beaten/whipped’ as a punishment (in this story he was not supposed to climb that tree).

8.1 Passive -ta(na) 261

See also dadu-tana- ‘move’ in (8.14b) below. In addition to rake- ‘break’, karya- ‘hook’, dyuru- ‘shorten’, kware-
‘change’ and dadu- ‘move’, which have already been discussed, the passive suffix is found with an anticausative function with the verbs listed in (8.10).

‘pierce’ ‘knock on’ ‘shoot at’ ‘fold’ ‘crack’ ‘break (hard material)’ ‘overturn’ ‘flatten’

shikwitachitashatibitsapewesawikawiru-

‘scrub’ ‘close’ ‘burst’ ‘detach’ ‘spread’ ‘lift’ ‘extract’ ‘scatter’

It is unclear to what extent the distinction between agentless or anticausative meaning is linked to the semantic type of verbs. I have not found any clear examples of verbs taking the passive with one meaning in one case and the other meaning in the other. Now we would also expect all the verbs listed under (8.10) above (anticausative meaning) to allow for an agentless meaning since they are all transitive and allow for an agent when non-derived. But we would not expect the reverse, i.e., for the verbs listed in (8.7) (agentless meaning) to allow an anticausative meaning. Anticausative meaning can normally only obtain with verbs denoting an event that can occur spontaneously. Thus for verbs such as ara- ‘eat’, iji- ‘drink’, pika- ‘braid’, etc., we would expect only an agentless meaning. But for some other verbs I do not see why they could not also have an anticausative meaning, such as chaja- ‘tear’, siri- ‘break’, teri‘close’, murya- ‘soak’. More work is needed on this topic.

8.1.3. -tana versus -ta
I said that both forms -tana and -ta are found in similar phonological environments and with the same meaning. Compare (8.4c) and (8.4d) above, for example, which both have the passivized verb tirya- ‘finish’. Even though the first uses -ta and the second -tana, there are no obvious semantic differences between the two. Another contrasting pair of text examples is presented in (8.11) below, from a similar story where two Cavineña brothers are killed by enemies. Both sentences express the same basic idea, namely ‘they/we got killed’, but the first makes use of -tana while the second -ta.

In terms of their distribution in the texts, as I already said, -tana is used much more frequently than -ta. As a result, I have rather few good text examples with the suffix -ta, and the question of a semantic difference remains open.

8.1.4. Ditransitive verbs

What happens with ditransitive verbs (baka- ‘ask O for O’, kweja- ‘inform O of O’, seka- ‘take O away from O’ and tya- ‘give O to O’)? Can either O becomes the S of the derived verb? What happens to the O that has not become the S? I have unfortunately very few examples of passivized ditransitive verbs. As we will see in subsequent sections, there are very few examples of reflexivized, ‘antipassivized’ or causativized ditransitive verbs at all. Through elicitation, however, Francisco Vaca volunteered the two examples in (8.12) with kweja‘inform’ showing that either original O can become the S of a passivized ditransitive verb.

‘The men are informed about the trip (they are about to undertake).’ n3.0182
This pair of examples also shows that the other original O, i.e., the O that has not become the S, is not expressed when the ditransitive verb is passivized. Note however that no attempt has been made to check whether this is obligatory.

8.1.5. Idiosyncratic meanings

In a few cases, the suffix -ta(na) has idiosyncratic meanings, as when it is used with the pair of transitive verbs jipe- ‘approach O, move close to O’ and jaka‘abandon O, move away from O’. With these verbs, the suffix has an antipassive effect: the underlying A, rather than the O, becomes the S, and the underlying O is demoted to an optional ablative postpositional phrase. This is first illustrated in (8.13) with jipe- ‘approach, move close to’.

As we can see, unlike what we saw above, the S argument of the derived verbs does not come from the original O but from the original A: in (8.13b), if the S resulted from the original O, we would have expected either ‘the sun’ as the S, reading ‘the sun was approached’ or ‘something approached the sun’ with no

264 8. Predicate structure — Valency-changing mechanisms

mention of ‘the clouds’; in (8.13c), if the S resulted from the original O, we should have the reading ‘be approached’.
When jipe- ‘approach, move close to’ is used in its non-derived form, the subject referent moves of its own will and intention; it can therefore be characterized as an agent. Thus in (8.13a) the vermilion flycatcher bird moves toward the sun of its own will. When it is used with the -tana, it does not move of its own will and intention anymore but under the control of an external agent; it can therefore be characterized as a patient. In (8.13b), the cloud does not choose to move closer to the sun but moves under the control of the wind. In (8.13c), the verb is in imperative mood which means that the subject is ordered to move and as a result does not move of its own will.
The antipassive-like effect of -tana with the verb jaka- ‘abandon, move away from’ is illustrated in (8.14), with (8.14a) showing the underived use of the verb and (8.14b) and (8.14c) showing this verb with -tana.

Similarly to what we saw with jipe- above, if the S resulted from the original O, i.e., if we had a true passive derivation, we should have quite different readings for these examples. In (8.14b), we should have ‘the beach was left’ or ‘something moved away from the beach’, with no mention of the raft and in (8.14c), we should have ‘be abandoned’. Quite similarly, when jaka- is used in its underived form, the subject is an agent, as in (8.14a) where the protagonist moves away from the path of its own will (to follow a group of monkeys in order to kill them). On the other hand,

8.1 Passive -ta(na) 265

when jaka- is used with -tana, the subject is a patient, as in (8.14b) and (8.14c). In (8.14b), the log raft, as an inanimate entity cannot move by itself but only under some external force. In (8.14c), similar to (8.13c) above, the verb is in the imperative mood, so that the subject has to move under an order by an external agent.
The antipassive effect of -tana is only attested with two verbs, jipe- ‘approach, move closer to’ and jaka- ‘abandon, move away from’. Even when used with verbs which are semantically similar to these two verbs, passive marking does not produce this meaning. For example, in (8.4a) above, the passive form of tibarirya- ‘go around’, a transitive motion verb with the subject as the moving figure, has an agentless function.8 This suggests that the antipassive effect discussed here is an idiosyncratic phenomenon; for this reason, jipetana- and jakatana- are treated as unitary roots in the rest of this study.

Turning now to the form -ta, it is found with an idiosyncratic meaning in the following verbs.

(8.15)

sipi-ta‘stick to’ (*be repaired)

 sipi‘repair O’

apu-ta‘disappear’ (*be covered)

 apu‘cover O’

paja-ta-

 paja-

‘become white’ (*be palmed/slapped)

‘palm/slap O’

There is also a number of verbs which end with tana or ta but for which either the base is not a transitive (inflecting) verb but from a different word class, or is not synchronically identifiable any more. Starting with -tana, with the three verbs in (8.16), a predicative adjective can be (at least partly) identified as the origin of (at least part of) the base.

Similarly, the verbs in (8.20) do not have any identifiable base, apart from the fact that their base patterns with the causative -sha (§8.4.1).

9 Note that there is a verb peke- ‘carry on one’s side’ to which peseke-tana- might be related.

Turning now to the -ta variant of the passive marker, it is possibly found in some transitive verbs that appear to be derived from nouns (see §5.2.2.3). They are given in (8.21).

(8.21)

naka-ta- ‘get wet’

 -na

In the verbs in (8.23), if the ta ending is indeed the passive suffix, I have no clue as to what the original base could be or could have been.

(8.23)

iyuma-ta- ‘roll oneself up’ kuju-ta- ‘have blisters’ putu-ta- ‘explode’

tada-ta- ‘get solid’ weji-ta- ‘fold and dangle’

8.1.6. Possible origin
The origin of the passive suffix -ta(na) might be a third person (plural) bound pronoun, with ta marking third person and na marking plural number. This is suggested by the fact that the form ta marks third person in the present day dual pronouns (ta-tse ‘3-DL’) and na marks plural number in present day third person plural pronouns (tu-na ‘3-PL’ and re-na ‘3PROX-PL’; see §§15.1.2-2.2). Although, strictly speaking, the form that combines with na in the present day language is not ta but tu, the similarity is quite striking. In addition, the grammaticalization path from third person (at least plural) pronouns to impersonal markers and/or to passive markers is widely attested cross-linguistically (see examples in Heine and Kuteva 2002: 235-7).

8.2. Reflexive/reciprocal k(a)-…-ti

The circumfix k(a)-…-ti, similarly to the passive marker, only applies to transitive (or ditransitive) verbs. It turns a transitive verb into an intransitive one, with the underlying A becoming the S argument of the derived verb. The syntax of the underlying O depends on the function of the circumfix. As we will see, it can either be omitted or demoted to an extended core argument (E).
The full form ka-…-ti applies to verbs which begin with a consonant, as in ka-peta-ti-, ka-sita-ti-, ka-yupu-ti-, etc. The reduced form k-…-ti applies to verbs which begin with a vowel, as in k-ina-ti-, k-utsa-ti- ‘wash oneself’, etc. (see §2.6.2).10
The Cavineña circumfix k(a)-…-ti is has a wide range of functions. It can be used productively with the following meanings:

1 — reflexive: the underlying A and O arguments represent the same referent; 2 — reciprocal: the underlying A and O referents are simultaneously agent and patient; 3 — benefactive reflexive: the underlying A and the O referents are distinct but have a special semantic bond (possession, benefaction, etc.). Syntactically, the O argument is demoted to an extended (core) argument (E); 4 — patientless antipassive: the underlying A and O referents are distinct but the focus is on the action itself. Syntactically, the underlying O is altogether omitted.

Table 8.2 below summarizes the four different functions of the Cavineña circumfix k(a)-…-ti.

akwa-tsuru- (chest-meet-), illustrated in (5.36). 11 Ref stands for referent; Agt, Pat and Agt Ben for semantic roles; and S and E for
grammatical functions. 12 Note that the simple coding given here does not capture the fact that there can be
more than two participants in a reciprocal relation (i.e., Ag1/Pat2, Ag2/Pat3/,

In (8.28), k(a)-…-ti is used on motion-like verbs, shana- ‘leave’, iya- ‘put’ and shura- ‘hang’, which results in the underlying O referent being separated from its underlying possessor A referent. The marker k(a)-…-ti emphasizes the fact that the bond still holds and that underlying A referent intends to recover their possession.

In the examples in (8.29), k(a)-…-ti is used on the verbs kemi- ‘buy’, duju‘take’ and tyana- ‘cap’. It encodes the fact that these actions, which are performed over the underlying O referent, benefit the underlying A referent exclusively (and not anybody else).

With the perception verbs ba- ‘see’ and peta- ‘look at’ the marker k(a)-…-ti can have the sense of ‘inspect’ or ‘examine’, i.e., ‘see’ or ‘look at’ with particular concern for the way the underlying O referent might affect the A. This is illustrated in (8.31) and (8.24d) (repeated).

The syntactic nature of the E argument is an interesting question for which I do not have any clear answer at the present time. What is clear is that E is not an O argument, even though it is unmarked for case. Evidence for this is that, unlike an O argument, an E argument cannot be represented by a bound pronoun. This is illustrated in (8.29a'), elicited from the textual example (8.29a) (repeated). As we see, it is impossible to include a bound pronoun, such as =tu-ke ‘3SG-FM’, referring to the E argument, makina=kwana ‘machines’. As (8.29a'') shows, =tu-ke ‘3SG-FM’ can only be used if k(a)-…-ti is removed from the verb, in which case makina=kwana ‘machines’ refers the O argument.14

The same phenomenon happens in (8.29b'), elicited from the textual example (8.29b) (repeated): it is impossible to use the bound pronoun =tu-ke ‘3SG-FM’ to refer to the E argument, mochila ‘bags’; this bound pronoun is only possible if k(a)-…-ti is removed from the verb, as in (8.29b''), where mochila ‘bags’ is the O argument.

8.2.3. Patientless antipassive
In (8.32), k(a)-…-ti has a patientless antipassive function: the underlying O referent is left unspecified because the focus is on activities (‘crossing’, ‘rowing’, ‘barking’ and ‘sweeping’) as opposed to events that are performed on particular entities.

When k(a)-…-ti is used on the cognition verb adeba- ‘know’, and when the underlying O referent is not specified, we can have the meaning of ‘foretelling, suspecting’. It is as if the event of ‘knowing’ is only partially performed over the O argument. Thus compare the pair in (8.33).

8.2.4. Ditransitive verbs

What happens when ditransitive verbs take k(a)-…-ti? More specifically, which of the two non-subject arguments, the theme or the recipient, can be coreferential or enter into a reciprocal relation with the agent? Although I have very few examples of ditransitive verbs marked by k(a)-…-ti, the examples available suggest both theme and recipient can be the co-referential argument. This is illustrated with the verbs tya- ‘give’ in (8.34) and kweja- ‘inform’ in (8.35). In (8.34a), the agent of tya- ‘give’ is in a reflexive relation with the theme while in (8.34b), it is in a reciprocal relation with the recipient. And in (8.35), the agent of kweja- ‘inform’ is in a reciprocal relation with the recipient.

Although they are rather scarce, these examples suggest that neither of the two non-subject arguments of ditransitive verbs is privileged within a reflexive or reciprocal derivation.
Examples (8.34b) and (8.35) also suggest that the non-subject argument that is not in a reflexive or reciprocal relation with the agent is not expressed. However, in (8.34a), the recipient, ‘God’, i.e., the non-subject argument that is not in a reflexive relation with the agent, is expressed by an oblique general locative phrase. This example could go against my impression that the two non-subject arguments of ditransitive verbs are left unexpressed within all types of valencyreducing mechanisms (see §8.1 and §8.3 below). However, it is quite possible that this is an idiosyncratic result of the fact that ‘giving oneself to God’, in the sense it has nowadays in Cavineña communities, is a recent idea introduced by Christian missionaries. Note that a similar phenomenon occurs with baka-baka‘pray’, an antipassive derivation of ditransitive baka- ‘ask’ (see §8.3 and (8.46)).

8.2.5. Idiosyncratic meanings

There are a number of idiosyncratic meanings associated with the k(a)-…-ti circumfix. In (8.36), I provide some examples with lexicalized meanings; a-examples are semantically reflexive, b-examples reciprocal, and c-examples patientless.

tion, I list a few of these verbs in (8.37):15

‘get angry’ ‘pass’ ‘coagulate’ ‘have an accident’

kajikatikatibutikadeneti-

‘tangle up’ ‘start E’ ‘transform oneself
into E’

8.2.6. Possible origin
The historical origin of the circumfix k(a)-…-ti is quite unclear. One could speculate that the -ti part is related to the motion suffix -ti ‘GO.TEMP’ (§7.2.1). Synchronically, however, these are clearly distinct morphemes, as shown by the fact that they can co-occur in a single verb; see for example ka-ba-ti-ti(REF-see-REF-GO.TEMP-) in (8.31). As for the ka- part, it does not have any equivalent in modern day Cavineña. Note that ka is a recurrent morpheme in many non-genetically-related South American languages where it often has a valency-changing function (Payne 1990: 79-80), suggesting that it might have evolved under influence from a neighboring language. Historical work is however required to clarify this issue.

8.3. Antipassives
There are two antipassive mechanisms in Cavineña. The first one applies to inflecting verbs and is achieved by full reduplication (§8.3.1). The second one applies only to non-inflecting verbs and is achieved by exchanging the transitive auxiliary for the intransitive auxiliary (§8.3.2).

8.3.1. Full reduplication
Full reduplication of an inflecting transitive (or ditransitive) verb root derives an inflecting verb which is intransitive. Syntactically, the reassignment of grammatical functions has an antipassive effect. The underlying A argument referent becomes the S of the derived verb and the underlying O argument referent is left unexpressed. Semantically, the reduplicated verb denotes a culturally identified activity, i.e., an activity that people or animals regularly repeat
15 Note that the circumfix k(a)-…-ti is also found with about 20 noun bases (e.g., kakaka-ti- ‘give fruit’ from the e-noun -kaka ‘fruit’), all intransitive. In this case, I analyze it as a verbalizer morpheme (see §5.2.2).

8.3 Antipassives 279

the same way, as opposed to denoting a particular event performed over a particular O when the verb is underived. This is illustrated with the verbs ara- ‘eat’ and taru- ‘stir’ in (8.38) and (8.39); a-examples are non-reduplicated and transitive while b-examples are reduplicated and intransitive.

One might want to ask what happens with ditransitive verbs. Can either of the two non-subject arguments, theme and recipient, be expressed by any means once a ditransitive verb has been reduplicated? The few examples of reduplicated ditransitive verbs available suggest that both theme and recipient must be left unspecified and unexpressed, similarly to the patient of a reduplicated monotransitive verb. This can first be seen with the ditransitive verb kweja‘inform’ reduplicated in (8.44), in an example volunteered by Francisco Vaca.

The same phenomenon is illustrated with the reduplication of tya- ‘give’ in

8.3 Antipassives 281

(8.45), volunteered by Alfredo Tavo. As explained by Alfredo, this can be used
in the particular context of the construction of the roof of a traditional house, in which case tya-u-tya-u refers to the action of ‘handing the palm leaves’:16

‘He is handing palm leaves (as they are making the roof of the house).’ n5.0343

Alfredo Tavo could not find any way to express either the thing handed (palm leaves) or the recipient, suggesting again that with ditransitive verbs, both Os are left unspecified and unexpressed.
However, with baka-baka- ‘pray’, reduplicated from baka- ‘ask O for O’ one of the underlying O (‘God’) is found expressed by an oblique general locative phrase. Example (8.46) shows the non-derived form in (a.), and the reduplicated form of baka- ‘ask’ in (b.)

It is possible that baka- exhibits idiosyncratic behavior. The concept of ‘praying’ as it is nowadays understood in Cavineña communities, as well as the term Señor ‘Lord, God’, were introduced by Missionaries and are not traditional. This might have influenced the fact that ‘God’ is mentioned together with baka-baka- ‘pray’. Note that the last ditransitive verb, seka- ‘take O away from O’, has not been found taking part in the process of antipassive reduplication.

16 Note that a vowel u ‘EPEN’ is added to both reduplicated parts. This is the result of the fact that full reduplication results in grammatical words made of two different phonological words and that a phonological word must have a minimum of two syllables ; see §3.2.2.

282 8. Predicate structure — Valency-changing mechanisms

The underlying O referent cannot be expressed but it is still understood as part of the semantics of the event. The events of ‘eating’, ‘stirring’, ‘drinking’, ‘waiting’, etc., illustrated in their reduplicated form above, still imply that they are performed over some O referent. But the identity of this referent is unimportant since they encode activities and can apply to any O referent that is semantically compatible. This type of antipassive would correspond to what is sometimes called patientless antipassive in the literature (see for example Dixon and Aikhenvald’s 2000).
The function of the antipassive reduplication, similarly to other valencymodifying devices in Cavineña, is essentially semantic: it is a means to focus on the activity. There is also a syntactic rearrangement of the argument structure, from an A/O frame to an S frame. But the antipassive reduplication does not have the other additional functions often found in languages with an antipassive, such as agent focusing or agent topicalizing, sometimes associated with the feeding of a pivot (see Dixon 1994). The Cavineña antipassive reduplication does not particularly focus on the A referent since there is no identifiable O referent to contrast it with.
One consequence of the strong semantic nature of the Cavineña antipassive is that it cannot apply to all types of verb. For example, the speakers rejected the antipassive derivation of chiri- ‘steal O’ (*chiri-chiri-), kwere- ‘cut O (e.g., tree) down’, be- ‘bring O’ and rikwa- ‘bark at O’.17 (Note that a systematic investigation of which verbs can undergo the antipassive reduplication remains to be done.) Another consequence of the strong semantic nature of the antipassive reduplication is that the derived form can have very specific meanings, not always fully predictable from the original root. This is the case with taru-taru‘row’, in (8.39b) (from taru- ‘stir O’), and susu-susu- ‘suck milk’ in (8.43) (from susu- ‘suck O’). Another very unusual meaning obtains with the reduplication of ba- ‘see’, where ba-u-ba-u- refers hens in the activity of searching for a place to lay eggs. Example (8.47) was volunteered by Alfredo Tavo.

8.3.2. Exchange of auxiliaries
With transitive non-inflecting verbs, an antipassive derivation is achieved by exchanging the transitive auxiliary a- ‘affect’ for the intransitive auxiliary ju-
17 Note that these verbs can be reduplicated as long as they become non-inflecting. This is however a quite distinct process (see §10.6).

8.3 Antipassives 283

‘be’. Unlike what happens with the antipassive reduplication, the underlying O can be overtly expressed, although this is not obligatory. Typically, the O is incorporated in the non-inflecting verb, as in (8.51b) and (8.52a). In at least one example, (8.49b), the underlying O is not incorporated but is instead expressed as an oblique (associative) phrase. In many cases, however, the underlying O is simply left unexpressed, as in (8.48b), (8.50b) and (8.52b).

8.4 Causatives 285

It is likely that the antipassive derivation through the exchange of auxiliaries is involved in the phenomenon of object ‘incorporation’ that accompanies the Ø-derivation of non-inflecting intransitive verbs from transitive inflecting verbs (§10.5), as in examples such as (8.53).

Both: ‘I took food.’ n2.0417-0418

In §10.5, I provide a full discussion of the intransitive status of clauses such as (8.53b) as well as the ‘incorporated’ status of O in these clauses. I also suggest that clauses such as (8.53b) are derived from clauses such as (8.53a) through a two-step process, as follows. A transitive inflecting verb, such as duju- ‘take O’ in (8.53a), is first turned into a transitive non-inflecting verb, as duju a- ‘take O’, and secondly turned into an intransitive non-inflecting verb by exchanging the auxiliary, giving earaki duju ju- ‘take-O’ in (8.53b). Note that the postulated intermediate form, duju a- ‘take O’, in the case of (8.53) never occur.
In (at least) one case the combination of the (posited) process of Øderivation followed by antipassive auxiliary alternation has resulted in a lexicalized non-inflecting verb. This is found with wikamutya ju- ‘fish (with line and hook)’. This verb quite transparently comes from wika ‘hook’ and the transitive verb mutya- ‘dip O’. It is likely that mutya- ‘dip (any) O’ was first Ø-derived into mutya a- ‘dip (any) O’ and then detransitivized by auxiliary alternation together with the noun wika ‘hook’ as its underlying O giving wika mutya ju‘dip hook’. Finally, this complex (non-inflecting) verb has become lexicalized as wikamutya ju- ‘fish (*‘dip hook’).

8.4. Causatives
A causative derivation increases the valency of the verb by adding an agentive argument, the causer, in A function.
Cavineña is noteworthy in having three causative markers. These markers are verbal suffixes; there are no analytic causatives in Cavineña. The differences between the three causative markers can be fruitfully captured by Dixon’s (2000) framework of analysis of causativeDixon mechanisms. As Dixon states, causative constructions in the languages of the world are characterized by nine semantic parameters. The nine parameters are reproduced in Table 8.3.

286 8. Predicate structure — Valency-changing mechanisms

Table 8.3. Semantic parameters of causatives (from Dixon 2000: 62)

Relating to the verb

1. Stative vs. active 2. Intransitive vs. transitive vs. ditransitive

Relating to the causee

3. Having vs. lacking control 4. Acting willingly vs. unwillingly 5. Partially vs. completely affected

Relating to the causer

6. Acting directly vs. indirectly 7. Acting accidentally vs. intentionally 8. Acting naturally vs. with effort 9. Involved vs. not involved in the activity

The first two causative markers differ along parameter (2): -sha only applies to intransitive verbs while -mere only applies to transitive verbs. The third causative marker, -kere, differs from the previous two according to parameter (9): it encodes the fact that the causer is involved in the activity.
I discuss each causative marker in turn below.

8.4.1. Causativizer of intransitive verbs -sha

The suffix -sha is used to causativize intransitive verbs, turning them into transitive ones. Its syntactic effect is straightforward: it introduces a new agent (causer) in A function and puts the underlying S argument (causee) into O function. This can be seen in the pair of examples in (8.54), which have been constructed by myself by analogy to very similar examples.

I discuss a few parameters below with examples drawn from texts.

As for the causer, it can act directly, as in (8.55) — the causee is inanimate and not controlling so that the causativized verb event requires direct action from the causer to be performed —, or indirectly as in (8.56) — the change of state events are controlled by the causee and result in the absence of appropriate intervention of the causer —; this is parameter (6). As we will see in the following section, directness of causation has a number of effects on the causativization of transitive verbs.
The causer can act naturally as in (8.58b) — the causees are eager to take revenge on the enemies so their chief does not have to force them to get ready —, or with a particular effort as in (8.57b) — children don’t like to bathe so early so that their parents have to force them to do so —; this is parameter (8).
Finally, causative -sha can derive both active verbs, as in all the examples above, and stative verbs, as in (8.59); this is parameter (1).

Causativization of intransitive verbs shows a number of irregularities. Intransitive monosyllabic verbs are all irregular when causativized. Of the five verbs, kwa- ‘go’, tsa- ‘laugh’, pa- ‘cry’, je- ‘come’, and the copula/auxiliary verb ju- ‘be’, only the causativized form of kwa- ‘go’, namely kwadisha- ‘send O’, appears to contain -sha. However this term also includes an additional formative di whose origin unknown.
The verbs tsa- ‘laugh’ and pa- ‘cry’ are causativized differently, as follows.

(8.60)

tsa-tura- ‘make laugh’ (*tsa-sha-)

peya-

‘make cry’

(*pa-sha-)

The formative tura in tsa-tura- is homophonous with the verbalizer -tura that turns adjectives into transitive verbs (§5.2.3). As for peya-, this verb appears to consist of the verb pa- ‘cry’ and an old causative formative -a which is no longer productive (see §5.2.6), preceded by the segment y.
The verb je- ‘come’ does not have any clear causativized equivalent; be‘bring’ would be the closest candidate.
The copula/intransitive auxiliary verb ju- ‘be’, in its meaning ‘exist, be located’, does not have any clear causativized equivalent either; the closest candidates would be verbs like iya- ‘put’, isha- ‘put in’, shana- ‘leave’, etc. In its copula/auxiliary function, however, ju- ‘be’ has a suppletive causativized form amere- ‘be+CAUS’ (*ju-sha-). As we will see, there is also a very similar suppletive form, akere- ‘be+CAUS.INVLT’, corresponding to the copula/intransitive auxiliary causativized by -kere ‘CAUS.INVLT’ (§8.4.3).)

The suppletive causativized form of the copula/intransitive auxiliary is an interesting morpheme. This morpheme first appears to be made of the combination of the transitive auxiliary a- ‘affect’ and the causativizer of transitive verbs -mere (§8.4.2), as if the copula/intransitive auxiliary ju- ‘be’ was first exchanged for the transitive auxiliary a- ‘affect’, and secondarily marked by the transitive causativizer -mere ‘CAUS’. Note that this is reminiscent of the auxiliary alternation found in the antipassive derivation of transitive non-inflecting verbs (§8.3.2). Alternatively, the a part of amere- could be related to the causative formative -a found as an ending in a few (mostly) transitive verbs (§5.2.6). Note that the suppletive form of the copula/intransitive auxiliary akere‘be+CAUS.INVLT’ (§8.4.3) probably had the same origin, whatever it may be, but more work is needed to clarify this issue.
In a few cases, the suffix -sha is found attached to other word classes in which case it acts as a verbalizer. The deriving verbs are all transitive. In the

8.4 Causatives 291

five forms in (8.62), it applies to adjectives.

temu-sha- ‘raise O, breed O’

 temu- ‘stiff’



jiruru-sha- ‘go along the edge of O’ 

-bakani ‘name’ -kwatsa ‘mouth’ -jiruru ‘edge’

In the four words in (8.20) (repeated), the bases to which -sha is suffixed never occur as independent words on their own, although they can also take the passive marker -tana (§8.1).

For the remaining forms in (8.64) below, it is not possible to state whether the formative sha is indeed the causative marker or not, as the bases are not found in any other contexts.

8.4.2. Causativizer of transitive verbs -mere

The suffix -mere causativizes transitive verbs. It introduces an agent (causer) in A function. The underlying O argument (patient) stays in O function. As for the underlying A (causee), there are two options, depending on semantic factors that have to do with the degree of integration of the event of causation (i.e., event of causer ordering causee) and the verb event (i.e., causee performing verb event). In direct causation, the causee becomes an additional core O argument (unmarked), in which case this yields a ditransitive verb. In indirect causation, the causee becomes an optional general locative oblique and the verb remains transitive; i.e., it does not become ditransitive.
The suffix -mere is fully productive: it can occur on potentially any transitive verb. This is unlike many languages where causativization is only available for intransitive verbs or available for only a few transitive verbs — sometimes only for the two verbs ‘eat’ and ‘drink’ — (Dixon 2000: 43 and p.c.).
The syntax of direct versus indirect causation is illustrated with elicited pairs of examples in (8.66) and (8.67). Note that the b-examples are causativized versions of the a-examples and that the suffix -mere and the causee argument are in boldface.

In the preceding examples, the causee is overtly expressed, in which case we know whether we have direct or indirect causation. But in many cases, there is no overt causee. In that situation, we do not have any overt clue as to decide whether we have direct or indirect causation, but only contextual ones. In the following I provide a number of such examples.
Example (8.70) shows semantically direct causation. We have a specific/referential causee and events closely linked together; the causer causes the causee ‘to throw’ by the physical contact of hitting.

‘(Hitting the man,) the anaconda made him drop (lit. throw) his shotgun and machete in the water.’ si005

In example (8.71) we have semantic indirect causation. Here, the causee is non-specific — we do not know who did the ‘calling’ — and the events are largely independent from each other, both temporally and spatially.

8.4 Causatives 295

‘Then my mum made someone call me once again (so that I would go back home).’ nk041

Example (8.72), however, is ambiguous between the two readings. We have a specific/referential causee which would suggest indirect causation. But the two events appear tightly knit together — the causer performs the verb event under direct fear of the causee —, which would suggest direct causation.

‘(The Araona people scared the intruding loggers away,) forcing them to abandon their tractors right there.’ T1.116

From these semantic and contextual interpretations, we would expect the causee in (8.70) to be marked as a core O argument, and in (8.71) as a general locative oblique argument. As for (8.72), both types of marking appear possible.
Causativized transitive non-inflecting verbs are shown in (8.73). Note that in (8.73a) the verb katsa- ‘beat O’ first undergoes the auxiliary-triggering process of distributive full reduplication (§10.6) — giving katsa-katsa a- ‘beat O repeatedly’ — and only secondarily takes the causative marker — resulting in katsa-katsa a-mere- ‘make O beat O repeatedly’.

Note that a-mere- ‘affect-CAUS’ is homophonous with suppletive causativized copula/auxiliary amere- ‘be+CAUS’ (see (8.61)).
What happens when ditransitive verbs are causitivized? Do they take three Os? In none of the examples available is there a third O (i.e., the causee) overtly expressed. In (8.74), for example, only the two Os (=metse ‘you (dl)’ and cuatro kuchara mateka ‘four spoons of margarine’) are overtly expressed.

‘Because my daughter is hungry, I am having someone ask you (dl) for four spoons of margarine.’ di1932

It is logically possible that the causee can be expressed by an oblique argument (as we saw in the case of indirect causation of transitive verbs). More work is needed on this topic before one can put forward any conclusive statement.
Unlike the preceding valency-changing morphemes (passive -ta(na), reflexive k(a)-…-ti and intransitive causative -sha), the transitive causative suffix -mere is highly regular, highly productive, and shows very few idiosyncrasies:

1 — the base upon which -mere applies is always recoverable; i.e., it is always a synchronically independent transitive verb; 2 — -mere is only found on (transitive) verbs; recall that -ta(na), k(a)-…-ti and -sha are also found with a variety of non-verbal word classes; 3 — the meanings that result from the application of -mere to a verb are in most cases predictable. The only irregularity observed in the data is an unusual semantic effect that obtains with the transitive verb kuje- ‘cheer on O (e.g., a dog when hunting)’, which becomes kujemere- ‘make O chase O’, and not ‘make O cheer on O’, as illustrated with the pair of examples in (8.75).

‘So, let’s (dl) make the dog chase the jaguar!’ tg029

8.4 Causatives 297

As we can see, the original A remains the A argument, the original O (the dog) goes to the periphery, marked with the general locative postposition =keja, and a new O is introduced (the jaguar). The reassignment of the semantic roles is reminiscent of applicative derivations, except that the semantic nature of the underlying O remains unclear. Now, we should note that the verb kuje- is itself a rather strange verb in Cavineña. First, it is not a native verb but a borrowing from Spanish (from the transitive verb coger ‘catch’). Secondly, it is the only borrowed verb that takes verbal morphology — recall that borrowed verbs normally require an auxiliary for this purpose (§5.3.2). The peculiar status of kuje-, therefore, might well explain the unexpected effect of the causative with this verb.
The historical origin of the causativizer of transitive verbs -mere appears to be the the independent transitive verb mere-, meaning ‘work for O, serve O’.

8.4.3. Causative of involvement -kere

The causative marker -kere ‘CAUSative of INVoLVmenT’ applies to both intransitive and transitive verbs. It is the most remarkable of the three causative markers in Cavineña because of its unusual specific semantics of involvement of the causer,19 corresponding to Dixon’s 2000 parameter (9) (see Table 8.3 above).
Syntactically, an intransitive verb becomes transitive. As with the causative marker -sha, the original S becomes the O of the derived verb. This is illustrated with a pair of (elicited) examples in (8.77).

(8.77)

19 This type of causative corresponds to what Shibatani and Pardeshi (2002) call sociative causative and Rodrigues (1953) comitative causative. Specific markers of causative of involvement, although highly unusual in other parts of the world, are widespread in South America. In a recent survey by Guillaume and Rose (forthcoming), such markers were found in 17 languages belonging to 7 distinct South American families.

A transitive verb becomes ditransitive. The original A becomes the second O of the derived ditransitive verb. Unlike the situation with the causative marker -mere, this is the only option available; i.e., the original O cannot be marked as an oblique. This is illustrated with the pair of (elicited) examples in (8.78):

(8.78)

[Don Francisco]O. Mr. Francisco

‘I invited Mr. Francisco to eat a cake with me.’ n3.0337

Ditransitive verbs marked with -kere presumably remain ditransitive, as happens with ditransitive verbs marked with -mere (e.g., (8.74)) but I unfortunately have no example to confirm it.
The crucial distinction between the causative marker -kere and the other two causatives is the fact that with -kere, in addition to causing the causee to perform the action, the causer participates himself in the action in some way. In example (8.77b), the ‘child’ is caused to ‘sleep’ by a causer who also ‘sleeps’. This sentence can be used when there is only one mosquito net (in trip situations for example) and a child who normally sleeps in his own mosquito net is requested to sleep under the same mosquito net as his parents. Note that nobody sleep without a mosquito net in Cavineña territory due to the incredible number of mosquitoes. In example (8.78b), ‘Don Francisco’ is invited to ‘eat’ by a causer who will also eat.
A very similar example is given in (8.79a) below. One morning, when my consultant Emerenciano Sepa arrived at my house for a working session, I had not finished my breakfast. There was still some coffee left so I offered him a cup while he waited for me. The following day, he told me that he could say (8.79a) to his friends. Note that because of its very high cost, Cavineña people rarely drink coffee.

This situation is notably different from the situation depicted by nawi-sha- in (8.57b). With nawi-sha-, the ‘children’ are forced to bathe and there is no implication that their parents bathe too.

The suffix -kere is fully productive and — except with one verb — fully regular. The exception is the copula/auxiliary ju- ‘be’ which becomes the suppletive akere- when causativized, and not the otherwise expected form *jukere-. Note that this is parallel to the causativization of ju- by the causativizer of intransitive verbs -sha, which yields amere-, and not *ju-sha- (§8.4.1). This is illustrated with two examples volunteered by Emerenciano Sepa in (8.83), with the causativized forms of wikamutya ju- ‘to fish’ and babi ju- ‘to hunt’, and with the text example in (8.84), with the causativized form of warere-warere ju‘to turn over and over again’.

Note that co-occurring valency-changing affixes are strictly ordered according to their scope. In (8.86a), the -ti part of the reflexive circumfix can only be applied once -sha ‘CAUS’ has first been applied to the verb root because it requires a transitive stem. As a result, -ti follows -sha. In (8.86b), -mere can only be applied before the reflexive circumfix is applied because it requires a transitive stem and because the reflexive circumfix derives an intransitive verb.

In (8.87), the non-inflecting verb kwatsabiji a- ‘tell story to O’ — see an example in (8.49a) — has first undergone an antipassive derivation by exchanging the transitive auxiliary a- ‘affect’ for ju- ‘be’ (see §8.3.2), giving kwatsabiji ju‘talk’ — see an example in (8.49b). Then, kwatsabiji ju- has been retransitivized with the causative of involvement (suppletive form akere-; see §8.4.3).

Note that one could interpret kwatsabiji akere- as the causativization of kwatsabiji a-, i.e., without first going through an antipassive derivation. If this were the case, however, we should have a ditransitive verb, not the transitive verb that we have here. Moreover, the meaning of this verb should be ‘could you make someone tell us and …’.
Logically impossible combinations (see shaded cells) correspond to the following situations:

— application of a valency-decreasing process (passive, reflexive, antipassive) to an intransitive base; — application the intransitive causative -sha to a transitive base; application of the transitive causative -mere to an intransitive base; — application of the ANTIP1 process to a polymorphemic base (ANTIP1 can only apply to roots).

Valency-changing affixes can co-occur with affixes from other slots. Combinations with postural/directional suffixes, as in (8.88), are not very common — no examples have been found of postural/directional suffixes co-occurring with passive -ta(na) or causative of involvement -kere — but this is likely to be the result of the fact that postural/directional suffixes are restricted to occurring with only a limited number of verb roots.

Chapter 9 Predicate structure — postural and directional suffixes

Postural and directional suffixes form a paradigm of seven mutually exclusive members. They occur in slot F of the predicate structure (see §5.1).
The first four members express postural notions: -ani ‘SIT’ (§9.1.1), -neti/-nitya ‘STAND’ (§9.1.2), -jara ‘LIE’ (§9.1.3) and -bade ‘HANG’ (§9.1.4). The remaining three members of the paradigm express directional notions: -tsura ‘GO.UP’ (§9.2.1), -bute/-butya ‘GO.DOWN’ (§9.2.2) and -sikwa ‘GO.AWAY’ (§9.2.3). These last three suffixes are mostly found on (independent) posture verbs. Their role is essentially to specify the direction (‘up’ vs. ‘down’ vs. ‘away’) that accompanies a change in posture.
Postural suffixes are S/A-related, in that they normally specify the posture of the S or the A argument. Directionals are S/O-related, in that the direction specification is about the S or the O argument.
Two members of the postural/directional paradigm are sensitive to the transitivity of the verb they are attached to: -neti/-nitya ‘STAND’ (-neti on intransitive verbs, -nitya on transitive verbs) and -bute/-butya ‘GO.DOWN’ (-bute on intransitive verbs, -butya on transitive verbs).
Six (out of seven) suffixes of the postural/directional paradigm have a corresponding verb, to which they are without much doubt historically related.

9.1. Postural suffixes

Postural suffixes consist of four members which encode body posture. They are given in Table 9.1.

Table 9.1. Postural suffixes

-jara -ani -neti/-nitya -bade

‘LIE’ ‘SIT’ ‘STAND’ ‘HANG’

Postural suffixes — with one possible exception; see (9.5b) — are S/Arelated. In other words, they specify the posture of the S/A argument of the clause.
Postural suffixes are most often found with the copula/auxiliary verb ju‘be’. Occasionally, however, they are attested with other types of verbs.

308 9. Predicate structure — postural and directional suffixes

9.1.1. -ani ‘SIT’

The suffix -ani expresses the fact that a core participant of the event, normally the S/A argument, is in a sitting posture.
The examples in (9.1) show -ani used to depict the sitting posture of the S argument of intransitive verbs.

In the data, -ani ‘SIT’ is also found on ara- ‘eat’, as ara-ani- ‘eat sitting’, and iwa- ‘wait for’, as iwa-ani- ‘wait for O sitting’.
The suffix -ani ‘SIT’ has a corresponding intransitive verb ani- ‘sit, be, live’:

‘(When they were preparing corn beer,) they (our Cavineña grandmothers) would sit (directly) on the ground, the poor women.’ ci079

There is a transitive verb, isaani- ‘ride O, sit on top of O (e.g., horse)’, which possibly contains the suffix -ani ‘SIT’ or the related verb ani- ‘sit’. Note however that this is speculative since the isa part of the verb is not found anywhere else in the language.

9.1.2. -neti/-nitya ‘STAND’

The suffix -neti/-nitya expresses the fact that a core participant of the event, normally the S/A argument, is in a standing posture. The form -neti is used with intransitive verbs while the form -nitya is used with transitive verbs.
In the examples in (9.4), -neti describes the standing posture of the S argument of intransitive verbs.

1 In this example, the transitive verb root ara- ‘eat O’ undergoes antipassive reduplication (§8.3.1). This process derives an intransitive verb stem.

310 9. Predicate structure — postural and directional suffixes

In the example in (9.5), -nitya is used with transitive verbs.

umada.

gather-STAND-IMPFV many

‘(They cut a lot of barbasco plants and) stood them in a group (lit. gathered them vertically).’ bb007

In (9.5a), -nitya denotes the (standing) posture of the A argument, i.e., ‘he’, not ‘agouti’. This is clear from the translation given by Alfredo Tavo of his own story. This is also clear from the fact that ‘the agouti’ is unlikely to be standing while trying to escape from the snake that is trying to eat him. In (9.5b), however, -nitya appears to specify the posture of the O argument, i.e., ‘barbasco plants’, not ‘they’. This could contradict the statement made earlier that postural suffixes are strictly S/A-related — postural suffixes could could refer to both S/A and S/O arguments. Conversely, rada-nitya- found in (9.5b) is perhaps a lexicalized form in which case its exceptional status would not contradict the statement. More work is required to reach a more conclusive statement.
Both intransitive and transitive forms of the suffix -neti/-nitya have corresponding verbs: intransitive neti- ‘stand, ‘stop (itr.)’, shown in (9.6a), and the transitive nitya- ‘make stand, ‘stop (tr.)’, shown in (9.6b).

Note that the verbs neti- and nitya- are formally related, nitya- being made of neti- plus the (unproductive) causative suffix -a (§5.2.6).

9.1.3. -jara ‘LIE’

The suffix -jara indicates that a core participant of the event is in a lying posture.

In (9.8), the suffix -jara occurs twice, each time within a temporal adverbial clause (§19.2). In the first temporal adverbial clause, it is attached to ju- ‘be’ (similarly to (9.7c)). In the second temporal adverbial clause, it is attached to the transitive verb iwa- ‘wait for’. Note that this clause has undergone an antipassive derivation by auxiliary alternation (§8.3.2).

9.2. Directional suffixes

Directional suffixes consist of three members, as repeated in Table 9.2.

Table 9.2. Directional suffixes

-tsura -bute/butya -sikwa

‘GO.UP’ ‘GO.DOWN’ ‘GO.AWAY’

Directional suffixes are mostly found on independent posture verbs. Unlike posture suffixes, directional suffixes are never attached to the copula/auxiliary verb ju- ‘be’.
Directional suffixes are strictly S/O-related. In other words, they encode the path2 followed by the S or O argument during the change of posture expressed by the verb the suffix is attached to. They do not express motion; the motion is

2 The terms path is used in the sense of Talmy (1985, 2000). It concerns the specification of the course followed by a figure during a displacement with regards to different landmarks, e.g., vis-à-vis the deictic center (towards vs. away from), vis-à-vis an enclosure (in vs. out), vis-à-vis the vertical axis (up vs. down), etc.

314 9. Predicate structure — postural and directional suffixes
within the verb. The facts that these suffixes are S/O-related and encode path but not motion, in addition to their very low productivity and their distinct position in the predicate structure, distinguish them very clearly from the motion suffixes that we discussed in §7.2 — remember that motion suffixes are either S/A- or O-related, that they encode both motion and path, and that they are fully productive. From a typological perspective, they are very similar to the category of directionals found in Mayan languages (see among others Robertson 1980; Haviland 1991, 1993; Craig 1994; Grinevald forthcoming; Zavala 1994) and Papua New Guinea languages (Foley 1986: 148-52).

9.2.1. -tsura ‘GO.UP’

The suffix -tsura indicates that the verb event is associated with an upward path. This suffix, similarly to its antonym -bute/-butya ‘GO.DOWN’ (§9.2.2), is essentially found on one of the four posture verbs, ani- ‘sit’, neti- ‘stand’, jara‘lie’ and bade- ‘hang’, as shown in (9.14).

See -tsura on bade- ‘hang’ in (9.13) above. In the available data, -tsura is not attested on other intransitive verbs. With
transitive verbs, -tsura is found with nitya- ‘make stand’, wana- ‘lay’, and iya‘put’, which all have to do with posture. They are illustrated in (9.15).

Note that with these transitive verbs, the upward path is associated with the O argument, i.e., ‘children’ in (9.15a), ‘tied sticks’ in (9.15b) and ‘peccary and two tortoises’ in (9.15c). In the case of intransitive verbs, the upward path is about the S argument, i.e., ‘you’ in (9.14a), ‘we’ in (9.14b) and ‘I’ in (9.14c).
In addition to these three transitive verbs, -tsura was accepted by Francisco Vaca on the transitive perception verbs peta- ‘look at’, as peta-tsura- ‘look up at something’, ba- ‘see’, as ba-tsura- ‘see something up’, and bajiyu- ‘turn head and see’, as bajiyu-tsura- ‘turn head and see something up’. Note however that Francisco did not accept -tsura on many other verbs, notably *baka-tsura(hear-GO.UP-), *kweja-tsura- (inform-GO.UP) and iwa-tsura- (wait.for-GO.UP).
Corresponding to the suffix -tsura is the verb tsura- ‘go up, go upriver’:

9.2.2. -bute/-butya ‘GO.DOWN’
The suffix -bute/-butya indicates that the verb event is associated with a downward path. The form -bute is used with intransitive verbs while the form -butya is used with transitive verbs.

316 9. Predicate structure — postural and directional suffixes

Similarly to -tsura, -bute is essentially found with posture verbs, at least ani‘sit’ and jara- ‘lie’, as shown in (9.17). I have not found -bute on neti- ‘stand’ and bute- ‘hang’ in the data.

Note that with -butya, similarly to -tsura (and to -sikwa ‘GO.AWAY’; see following section), the downward path is associated with the O argument, i.e., ‘older sister’ in (9.18a), ‘the one who was going carrying…’ in (9.18b) and ‘my hip’

9.2. Directional suffixes 317

in (9.18c). With intransitive verbs, the downward path is about the S argument, i.e., ‘you’ in (9.17a) and ‘I’ in (9.17b).
Similarly to -tsura, Francisco Vaca refused -butya on baka- ‘hear’ (*bakabutya-) and kweja- ‘inform’ (*kweja-butya-). Unfortunately I did not have the chance to ask for peta- ‘look at’ and bajiyu- ‘turn head and see’.
Both suffixes -bute and -butya have corresponding verbs, bute- ‘go down, go downriver’ and butya- ‘lower’, respectively, as illustrated in (9.19).

Note that the verbs bute- and butya- are formally related, butya being made of bute- plus the (unproductive) causative suffix -a (§5.2.6).

9.2.3. -sikwa ‘GO.AWAY’

The suffix -sikwa expresses the fact that the verb event is associated with a motion directed away from the reference point. Similarly to -tsura and -bute, the suffix -sikwa is essentially found with posture verbs as shown in (9.20).

Note that with these transitive verbs, similarly to -tsura and -butya, -sikwa expresses the path of the O argument, i.e., ‘brazil nuts’ in (9.22a) and ‘plank’ in (9.22b). In the case of intransitive verbs, the ‘away from reference point’ path is about the S argument, i.e., ‘Jaime’ in (9.20a,b), ‘our ancestors’ in (9.20c) and (9.21).
The suffix -sikwa does not have a corresponding verb. All I can say at the present stage is that it is made of the formative kwa which is possibly historically related to the verb kwa- ‘go’.

9.3. Distribution 319

9.3. Distribution

Postural and directional suffixes occupy slot F of the predicate. They form a single paradigm of mutually exclusive members. For example, the transitive verb iwa- ‘wait for O’ can take either -jara ‘LIE’, as in (9.8), or -bade ‘HANG’, as in (9.12), but it cannot take -jara and -bade at the same time (*iwa-jarabade- or *iwa-bade-jara-). Similarly, the transitive verb iya- ‘put’ can be marked by -tsura ‘GO.UP’, as in (9.15c), or -sikwa ‘GO.AWAY’, as in (9.22a), but it cannot take both suffixes simultaneously (*iya-tsura-sikwa- or *iya-sikwa-tsura-). Note that no attempt was made to elicit the co-occurrence of a postural suffix and a directional suffix. However, this is never attested in the data.
In full reduplication with antipassive effect (§5.5 and §8.3.1), only the verb root can be reduplicated, never the verbal affixes. Postural/directional suffixes will therefore be attached to the reduplicated root, as with -neti ‘STAND’ in (9.4a) (ara-ara-neti-ya ‘eat-REDUP-STAND-IMPFV) and -bade ‘HANG’ in (9.11a) (ara-ara-bade-ya ‘eat-REDUP-STAND-IMPFV).
Examples of postural/directional suffixes in co-occurrence with valencychanging affixes (slot C/G) are given in (9.23).

‘(we) put again (our bags) down (in the cart)’ vb055

Examples that show postural/directional suffixes co-occurring with (optional) Aktionsart suffixes (slot H) are:

— (9.5a) and (9.13) showing postural -nitya ‘STAND’ and directional -tsura ‘GO.UP’ followed by the motion suffix -diru ‘GO.PERM’; — (9.14b) showing directional -tsura ‘GO.UP’ followed by motion suffix -eti ‘COME.PERM’; — (9.18c) showing directional -butya ‘GO.DOWN’ followed by -nuka ‘REITR’. Note that following the application of -butya and -nuka on ba- ‘see’, the verb undergoes a Ø-derivation auxiliary-triggering process (§10.5); — (9.24) showing directional -tsura followed by the completive -tere ‘COMP’:

9.4. Suffixes vs. compounded/serialised verbs?
One might want to analyze postural and directional morphemes as compounded or serialized roots (rather than suffixes) since most of these also occur as independent verbs in the language. Recall that a similar issue is discussed for Aktionsart suffixes (see §7.7). As in that discussion, here again I will prefer an analysis in terms of suffixes because we are missing a corresponding verb for -sikwa ‘GO.AWAY’, a form that otherwise behaves grammatically exactly similarly to the remaining six morphemes. A unified analysis in terms of a single paradigm of suffixes appears thus a simpler option than treating six suffixes as compounded/serialized and one differently as a suffix.

Chapter 10 Predicate structure — auxiliary-triggering processes
Auxiliary-triggering processes constrain the application of suffixes to verbs. Once an auxiliary-triggering process has been applied to a verb, any additional verbal suffixes must be carried by an auxiliary.
Six auxiliary-triggering processes have been identified. First, there are five auxiliary-triggering suffixes: -kara/-karama ‘DESID’, -metse ‘FIRST’, -jakama ‘CEASELESSLY’, -bawe/-baekwa ‘ALWS’ and -ki/-aki ‘TYPICAL’. They will be called mode suffixes, and they fall into slot I of the predicate. They are discussed in §10.1.
Second, there are four phonologically independent markers which are preposed to the verb (in slot B): nere ‘VIGOROUSLY’, yume ‘IMMEDIATELY’, riya ‘STARTLING’ and pana ‘PROPERLY’. Preverbal modifiers are discussed in §10.2.
Third, there are two discontinuous markers, jadya …-e ‘MAN’ and ejebucha …-e ‘MAN.INT’. These morphemes consisting of the combination of a phonologically independent part (jadya or ejebucha), which fills slot B, and a suffix -e, which fills slot I. The discontinuous verb modifiers are discussed in §10.3.
Fourth, there is a series of phonologically independent markers which are postposed to the verb (in slot J): pidya ‘ONCE’, beta ‘TWICE’, and kimisha ‘THREE.TIMES’. Postverbal modifiers are discussed in §10.4.
The fifth auxiliary-triggering process consists of a Ø-marker. Here an auxiliary is required without any clear specific marker. Often, however, this process is accompanied by the ‘incorporation’ of an independent particle or a postpositional phrase. This is discussed in §10.5.
The sixth, and last, auxiliary-triggering process is full reduplication. This process has a distributive effect. It is discussed in §10.6.
An auxiliary-triggering process can be applied to a verb that already has an auxiliary — this can be a basic non-inflecting verb or a verb to which an auxiliary-triggering process has previously been applied. With some auxiliarytriggering processes (e.g., the suffixes -kara/-karama ‘DESID’) this has the effect of triggering an additional auxiliary. With some other auxiliary-triggering processes (e.g., preverbal modifiers), no additional auxiliary is required. A summary of attested combinations of two auxiliary-triggering processes is presented in §10.7.
Auxiliary-triggering processes can also combine with verbal categories from other slots. This is discussed in §10.8.

322 10. Predicate structure — auxiliary-triggering processes

10.1. Auxiliary-triggering suffixes

Mode suffixes occupy slot I of the predicate.

10.1.1. -kara/-karama ‘DESID/DESID.NEG’

The suffixes -kara ‘DESIDerative’ and -karama ‘DESIDerative NEGative’ express the concepts ‘want to V’ and ‘not want to V’, respectively. The ma ending in -karama is a negative formative most likely related to the ma ending found in the da-adjective negative suffix -dama (§11.2.4) and/or the negative resultative adjectivizer suffix -ma (§11.3.4).
Examples with -kara on intransitive verbs are given in (10.1).

In (10.2) and (10.3), -kara modifies intransitive non-inflecting verbs. This re-
sults in triggering another auxiliary. In (10.2), -kara modifies the non-inflecting verb bawe ju- ‘know E’.1

In (10.3), -kara modifies the derived non-inflecting verb ejebucha ju-neni-e ju‘live this way’. Here the verb ju-neni- (be-RANDOM) ‘be in many places’, has taken the auxiliary-triggering discontinuous marker jadya …-e ‘MAN’ (§10.3).

1 Recall that this verb is ambitransitive; it takes either an S/E or an A/O frame (§5.3.6).

In (10.6), -karama ‘DESID.NEG’ occurs on the transitive (but passivized) noninflecting verb jucha a- ‘have sex with O’.

How does Cavineña express the idea of ‘want O to do V’, i.e., when the subject of V is different from the subject of ‘want’? The answer is “morphologically”. This is achieved is by using a causative suffix in addition to the desiderative suffix. Literally, ‘want O to do V’ is expressed by ‘want to make O V’. As an illustration, consider (10.7a), with an intransitive verb, and (10.7b), with a transitive verb (an elicited example). Note that Cavineña has distinct causative markers for intransitive and transitive verbs (see §8.4).

10.1.2. -metse ‘FIRST’

The suffix -metse ‘FIRST’ is only found in very few examples from texts. It conveys the meaning that the subject participant performs the verb event before anybody else does: S ‘first’ is shown in (10.8), and A ‘first’ in (10.9a,b).

10.1.3. -jakama ‘CEASELESSLY’

The suffix -jakama is used to express the fact that an event/situation/activity keeps occurring or keeps being repeated.
Examples with -jakama on intransitive verbs are given in (10.11).

Note that in (10.11b), -jakama is applied after the auxiliary-triggering reduplication process (§10.6) is applied. This triggers an auxiliary on which -jakama is attached. Under the ‘bedroom’ of the house where I was living in Misión Cavinas, there was a space where a whole family of pigs was sleeping every night. While searching for an example with tawi-jakama ju- ‘sleep ceaselessly’, Emerenciano Sepa proposed (10.12).

Cavineña people hardly ever fence in their domestic animals. One bad consequence of this is that the rice gardens are systematically damaged by the cattle. When I asked Emerenciano Sepa to give me an example with ara-jakama a‘eat ceaselessly’ (a transitive example), he proposed (10.13).

Note that there is little doubt that -jakama ‘CEASELESSLY’ is historically related to the Aktionsart suffix -jaka ‘STOP’ (§7.1.2). In addition, it is likely that the syllable ma is the same as the one found in the desiderative negative suffix -karama (§10.1.1) and the da-adjectives negative suffix -dama ‘NEG’ (§11.2.4).

10.1. Auxiliary-triggering suffixes 327

10.1.4. -bawe ‘ALWS’ and -baekwa ‘ALWS.NEG’

The suffix -bawe ‘ALWayS’ and its negative counterpart -baekwa ‘ALWayS NEGative’ convey the meanings ‘like to V’, ‘can V’, ‘always V’, ‘typically V’. These suffixes are quite transparently related to the extended intransitive noninflecting verbs bawe ju- ‘know E’ and (its negative counterpart) baekwa ju‘not know E’ (see §5.3.6).
Intransitive non-inflecting verbs derived from intransitive inflecting verbs with -bawe are illustrated in (10.14) and with -baekwa in (10.15).

‘Always’ suffixes are very peculiar with respect to other auxiliary-triggering processes. First, the non-inflecting verbs derived from transitive inflecting verbs with these suffixes are S=O ambitransitive (i.e., either intransitive or transitive, with the O of the transitive corresponding to the S of the intransitive). Noninflecting intransitive ‘always’ verbs have a single core argument S which corresponds to the original O (of the non-derived inflecting verb) and often — but not obligatorily — an oblique dative, which corresponds to the original A. This is illustrated with a minimal pair of (elicited) sentences in (10.16), with -bawe, and (10.17), with -baekwa; a-examples are intransitive, b-examples are transitive.

10.1. Auxiliary-triggering suffixes 329

Second, the non-inflecting verbs derived with ‘always’ suffixes can only take the intransitive auxiliary ju- ‘be’, even if they are transitive. This is unexpected because transitive non-inflecting verbs derived by other auxiliarytriggering processes invariably take the transitive auxiliary a- ‘affect’. This is illustrated in (10.20) and (10.21).

The suffixes -bawe and -baekwa can only be attached to verbs (not to other word classes). They can be attached to the copula verb of a copula clause with an adjective in CC function (§11.1.1). This allows the adjective to be modified (albeit indirectly) by these suffixes. This is illustrated in (10.22).

In (10.23), I show a complex example where a copula clause, containing the adjective ujeje- ‘sick’ as CC, is first marked by the auxiliary-triggering suffix -jakama ‘CEASELESSLY’ (§10.1.3) and secondly marked by -bawe ‘ALWS’.

10.1.5. -ki / -aki ‘TYPICAL’

The suffixes -ki and -aki ‘TYPICAL’ only occur in a few examples in the available data. These suffixes are possibly related to the adjectivizer of nouns -ki ‘WITH’ (§11.3.1). They appear to have the meanings ‘be in the process of Ving’, ‘can V’, ‘typically V’, ‘have the particular quality of V-ing’. No clear semantic differences could be found between -ki and -aki. In this study they will be treated as two variants of a single morpheme. They are briefly discussed here and require more investigation.
Examples showing -ki and -aki ‘TYPICAL’ are given in (10.24) (intransitive) and (10.25) (transitive).

‘You need to wash your mosquito net. It is dirty.’ n5.0764

Non-inflecting transitive verbs taking -ki have the original O occurring as a modifier preposed to the adjective, as shown in (10.26). Note that these have presumably undergone an antipassive derivation by auxiliary alternation with incorporation of the O (§8.3.2).

‘As the river was spreading, the flow was beating on the house with its strength.’ di2221

It is quite possible that, similarly to non-inflecting verbs derived from transitive verbs by ‘always’ suffixes -bawe and -baekwa (§10.1.4), non-inflecting verbs derived from transitive verbs by (at least) -aki are ambitransitive. This is suggested by the examples given in (10.27), which are intransitive. Note that the a-example displays S=O ambitransitivity while the b-example display S=A ambitransitivity.

10.2. Preverbal modifiers
Preverbal modifiers consist of four members that go into slot B of the predicate. They are repeated in Table 10.1.

‘VIGOROUSLY’ ‘IMMEDIATELY’ ‘STARTLING’ ‘PROPERLY’

10.2. Preverbal modifiers 333

10.2.1. nere ‘VIGOROUSLY’

The marker nere expresses the fact that the verb event occurs in a very hard,
fast, sudden, vigorous, brusque and unexpected fashion. Examples with intransitive verbs are given in (10.29):2

2 Note that the auxiliary always forms a separate constituent from the non-inflecting verb (see discussion of this in §4.6.1 and §5.4). As a result, when a non-inflecting verb consists of more than one phonological word, the brackets only include the words that constitute the non-inflecting constituent, not the auxiliary.

10.2.2. yume ‘IMMEDIATELY’

The marker yume expresses the fact that the verb event occurs immediately, as an instantaneous reaction/reflex to some other event.
Yume is illustrated with intransitive verbs in (10.31).

‘When I stepped on it, the caiman vigorously jumped out (lit. emerged) (of the water). (It opened its mouth and tried to bite me. I got very scared and) immediately pointed my rifle at it (and shot and killed it).’ lg012

Note that in (10.32b), the marker yume ‘IMMEDIATELY’ contrasts with the marker nere ‘VIGOROUSLY’, used three sentences earlier in the same text. Both markers express very fast events which occur as reactions to some other events (‘stepping on the back of caiman’ with nere, and ‘being scared’ with yume). However, they differ in that nere puts the emphasis on the intensity of the reaction while yume puts the emphasis on the timing.
Note that in all the examples above, the verb that takes yume also takes the focus particle =dya (§17.2.3). Although this is the case for most examples in the data, in some of my written texts, =dya is not used, suggesting that it might not be obligatory.

10.2.3. riya ‘STARTLING’

The marker riya expresses the fact that an event occurs suddenly and unexpectedly and causes the S/A referent to startle. Only a few examples of this morpheme are available. It is illustrated in (10.33a), with an intransitive verb, and (10.33b), with a transitive verb.

10.2.4. pana ‘PROPERLY’

The marker pana is semantically quite different from the previous three. It manifests the fact that an event is performed with a lot of care, attention, precision and thoroughness; recall that nere, yume and riya all express sudden events. In all the examples available but one (see (10.35)) pana occurs with transitive verbs, as shown in (10.34).

The marker pana is also found with baka- ‘hear’, as pana baka a- ‘hear carefully’, adeba- ‘know’, as pana adeba a- ‘know very well’, and tirya- ‘finish’, as pana tirya a- ‘finish completely’.

10.2. Preverbal modifiers 337

The only example found where pana modifies an intransitive verb is (10.35) (from the Camp and Liccardi’s (1989) dictionary).

10.2.5. Miscellaneous

Auxiliary-triggering preposed markers do not trigger an additional auxiliary when they are applied to (basic or derived) non-inflecting verbs.
In (10.36), the non-inflecting verb katewa ju- ‘hide’ takes pana ‘PROPERLY’, giving pana katewa ju- ‘hide very well’ (with no additional auxiliary).

In (10.37), the transitive verb peta- ‘look at O’ first takes the preverbal modifier pana ‘PROPERLY’, giving pana peta a- ‘look at O properly’, and then takes the desiderative suffix -kara ‘DESID’, resulting in pana peta a-kara a- ‘wanting to look at O properly’ with a second auxiliary.

The markers yume ‘IMMEDIATELY’ and riya ‘STARTLING’ are likely to be historically related to the pointing demonstratives riya ‘here’ and yume ‘over there’ (see §15.8). I have no idea of the origin of nere ‘VIGOROUSLY’ and pana ‘PROPERLY’.

10.3. Discontinuous verb modifiers

The discontinuous markers jadya …-e ‘MANner’ and its interrogative counterpart ejebucha …-e ‘MANner.INTerrogative’ occupy slots B and I of the predicate.
The meaning of the marker jadya …-e is to refer back (i.e., anaphorically) to an event that has been performed in a particular, unusual or non-conventional way. As for the interrogative counterpart, it is used to question the particular way in which an event has occurred.
Examples of jadya …-e with intransitive verbs are given in (10.38).

340 10. Predicate structure — auxiliary-triggering processes

There is a very strong tendency for verbs marked by jadya …-e to occur in sentence initial position, as can be seen in most of the examples provided so far. This is not an absolute requirement, however, as shown by (10.38b) and (10.41) below, where the S independent pronoun ekwana ‘1PL’ comes first.

EkwanaS =ekwanaS [jadya ani-e=ama] ju-ya.

MAN sit-MAN=NEG be-IMPFV

‘We (Cavineña people) do not live (lit. sit) like this (i.e., fighting each other).’ T1.57

Another observed tendency is for the marker jadya …-e ‘MAN’ to be used towards the end of narratives, as a sort of anaphoric conclusion/recapitulation formula. See for example (T1.111), given in (10.40c) above. The reason for this is that any story is about an event that happened in a particular way (and is thus worth a story).
We should note that the jadya and ejebucha parts of manner markers also exist independently, as jadya ‘thus’ and ejebucha ‘how’ (see §19.4.2). As such, they do not form a constituent with the verb: they can occur anywhere in the clause, and they do not require an -e suffix on the verb, as can be seen in examples in (10.42).

(10.42) a. Jadya =yatseS biaje=ju ka-bajeje-ti-ni-chine. thus =1DL trip=LOC REF-prepare-REF-RANDOM-REC.PAST

‘(Corn seeds) would stay (lit. sit) this way (i.e., in water from 1 to 3 days) in order to make them sprout (while preparing corn beer).’ ci075

The meaning of these sentences is different from the meaning of sentences where jadya or ejebucha are parts of manner markers. In (10.42) ‘the ways’ the actions are performed have nothing particular and unusual: these sentences describe the normal ways for Cavineñas to ‘sleep during a trip’ or ‘prepare corn beer’.
The auxiliary-triggering marker jadya/ejebucha …-e does not appear to trigger another auxiliary when applied on a (basic or derived) non-inflecting verb. It is found on one occasion on the transitive non-inflecting verb kwatsabiji a‘tell story to O’ detransitivized by the antipassive derivation (by auxiliary alter-

nation) as kwatsabiji ju- ‘chat’. The result is ejebucha kwatsabiji ju-e ju- ‘how to chat’ (pa086). Note that the original example is not fully reproduced here because of additional complexities.

10.4. Postverbal modifiers

There is a set of quantifier markers based on the numerals for ‘one’, ‘two’ and ‘three’ (see §4.4.5 and §13.5 for a discussion of numerals). These are used to specify the number of times an event is performed: pidya ‘ONCE’, based on peadya ‘one’ (with idiosyncratic phonological change ea  i), beta ‘TWICE’, based on beta ‘two’, and kimisha ‘THREE.TIMES’, based on kimisha ‘three’.3 It is unclear whether there are auxiliary-triggering quantifier markers corresponding to higher numbers such as pushi ‘four’, pishika ‘five’, etc.; this needs to be investigated.
Quantifier markers occupy slot J of the predicate. They form independent phonological words. If a quantifier marker is used with a monosyllabic verb stem, the monosyllabic verb cliticizes on the quantifier (as a proclitic), in order to comply with the requirement that an independent phonological word must have a minimum of two syllables (see §3.1.2). This can be seen with =pidya ‘ONCE’ modifying kwa- ‘go’ in (10.43a) and kimisha ‘THREE.TIMES’ modifying ju- ‘be’ in (10.43c).
Quantifier markers are illustrated with intransitive verbs in (10.43).

Auxiliary-triggering quantifier markers are not found applied to noninflecting verbs and it is not known if they require an additional auxiliary.

10.5. Auxiliary-triggering Ø-marker
In the processes described above, the use of an auxiliary is always triggered by a specific overt marker. There is, however, a peculiar construction whereby an auxiliary is required without any specific marking. This phenomenon is not fully understood yet and, as a result, the following discussion remains tentative and provisional.
The Ø-marked auxiliary-triggering process can be illustrated with (10.45), showing the intransitive inflecting verb kastere- ‘become tired’ in (a.) and its corresponding Ø-marked intransitive non-inflecting verb kastere ju- ‘become tired’ in (b.).

‘The poor man got tired (preparing for his wedding) for nothing (because his wife decided to marry someone else).’ mu048

The pair of examples in (10.46) shows the same Ø-marked auxiliary-triggering process with the transitive inflecting verb tinu- ‘pull O’ in (a.) and its transitive non-inflecting verb equivalent tinu a- ‘pull O’ in (b.).

‘We will pull whatever flower (tied to a liana) towards the top (of the forest canopy) (to distract the Cavineñas in order to attack them).’ hm109

In many cases, although not always, the Ø-marked non-inflecting verb has ‘incorporated’ an element (into slot B of the predicate), such as the independent particle yanakana ‘in vain’ in (10.45b) and the general locative postpositional phrase ebarukwe=keja ‘towards the top’ in (10.46b). This is shown by the square brackets in the examples. The main evidence that the element and the Ø-marked verb form a constituent is second position clitic placement. When the element and the non-inflecting verb come first in the sentence, second position clitics are attached to the last word of the sequence, as with =shana ‘PITY’ in (10.45b) and with =tu ‘3SG’ in (10.47).

One could argue that yanakana ‘in vain’ and ebarukwe=keja ‘towards the top’ that trigger the use of an auxiliary; note that yanakana is found in both (10.45b) and (10.47). This does not appear to be a satisfactory analysis, however, because yanakana ‘in vain’ and ebarukwe=keja have an existence on their own with the same meanings. In (10.48), for example, there is no non-inflecting verb and yanakana is clearly not ‘incorporated’.

The exact same pattern can be observed with other types of ‘incorporated’ elements. For example,the independent particle jadya ‘thus’ can be ‘incorporated’ through a Ø-marked auxiliary-triggering process, as in (10.49a), with an intransitive verb, and (10.49b), with a transitive verb. Or it can be used independently, as in (10.42a,b) (repeated).

Transitive verbs always ‘incorporate’ an element when a Ø-marked auxiliary-triggering process is applied. Either they ‘incorporate’ a peripheral element and remain transitive, as in (10.46b), (10.47) and (10.49b), or they ‘incorporate’ their object and become intransitive, as in the various examples given under (10.56).

The first argument that suggests that the predicate is intransitive is that the A has become an S. In (10.56c) for example, where the subject is expressed, it is

348 10. Predicate structure — auxiliary-triggering processes

the absolutive form i-ke that is used, and not the ergative form e-ra. The second argument is that the auxiliary is the intransitive ju- ‘be’, not the transitive a‘affect’. Arguing that the object is ‘incorporated’ is not as straightforward. Note that the O is still unmarked for case (similarly to the O of a transitive predicate). Also note that the O can be a full NP with a head and with regular modifiers, such as plural =kwana in (10.56b), quantifier beta ‘two’ and (copula) relative clause (with omitted copula) achacha=ke ‘small’ in (10.56c), and relative clause brasil=ju kwa=ishu=ke ‘to go to Brazil’ in (10.56d). The evidence for ‘incorporation’ is that the original O and the verb form a constituent, exactly like the ‘incorporated’ particles or postpositional phrases discussed above. Note that a ‘regular’ O in a transitive clause has no ordering restrictions and never forms a constituent with the predicate. It is obligatorily placed immediately before the verb. If the O+V sequence is first in the sentence, second position particles are attached to the V (not the O), as with =ekwana ‘1PL’ in (10.56b) and =ni ‘MAYBE’ in (10.56d). It is not possible to have the original O at any other position in the clause. This can be seen in (10.57) with examples elicited from Francisco Vaca.

The detransitivization process that accompanies the Ø-marked auxiliarytriggering process with transitive verbs is surprising. The most plausible explanation that I can give at the present time involves the antipassive derivation of non-inflecting transitive verbs by exchanging auxiliaries (see §8.3.2). This would be a two-step process. The transitive inflecting verb is first turned into a transitive non-inflecting verb (by Ø-marking), and secondly turned

10.6. Full reduplication 349
transitive non-inflecting verb (by Ø-marking), and secondly turned into an intransitive non-inflecting verb by exchanging the transitive auxiliary for the intransitive auxiliary. For some reason, the output of the first step, i.e., a Øderived transitive non-inflecting verb, never shows up.
The function (as well as the productivity) of the Ø-marked auxiliarytriggering process is quite unclear and requires additional work. Speakers do not see semantic differences between a verb with or without the auxiliary-triggering Ø-marker. It might have discourse or stylistic functions. Note also that auxiliary-triggering Ø-marking is not very commonly used in texts and might not be productive.
Auxiliary-triggering Ø-marker is not found applied on non-inflecting verbs and it is not known whether this would or would not require an additional auxiliary.

10.6. Full reduplication

Full reduplication with distributive meaning applies to both intransitive and transitive (including ditransitive) verbs and to both inflecting and non-inflecting verbs.4 This process encodes multiple reiterations of the verb event within short and regular intervals, with exactly the same participants and in exactly the same spatiotemporal settings (location and time).
Full reduplication of intransitive verbs is shown in (10.58).

Non-inflectional suffixes can be reduplicated together with the verb root. Examples showing this phenomenon with intransitive verbs are shown in (10.60a), involving the Aktionsart suffix -baka ‘SHORT.TIME’, and (10.60b), involving with Aktionsart suffix -chinepe ‘ALL.DAY’.

Note that it is not altogether clear what the distributive sense is in (10.61a). The translation given by Antonio Yubanera, while transcribing the conversation from which this sentence comes, is ‘a little bit’. This could mean that full reduplication can also have a de-intensifying meaning, as happens with full reduplication of adjectives (see §11.2.2). Alternatively, full reduplication here might refer to the back and forth motion of the cooking pot over the fire (performed in order to avoid burning the corn).
Full reduplication of a non-inflecting (basic or derived) verb does not require an additional auxiliary. One example of the full reduplication of a basic noninflecting verb, nereda a- ‘scold O’, is presented in (10.62). The nonreduplicated version is given in (a.) while the reduplicated version is given in (b.).

In (10.63), the verb pakaka ‘fall’ first takes nere ‘VIGOROUSLY’ (§10.2.1), giving nere pakaka ju- ‘fall vigorously’, and is then reduplicated.

As we can see, neither (10.62b) nor (10.63) requires an additional auxiliary. See also reduplication of ijine-kara ju- ‘want to stray’ as ijine-kara-ijine-kara ju- in (10.68).

10.7. Combination of two auxiliary-triggering processes

The combination of two auxiliary-triggering processes is rare, but possible. Table 10.2 below is a summary of all combinations attested in the data. The processes in the left column are applied before the processes from the top row. The processes which have not been found in combinations have not been included; this is the case with -metse ‘FIRST’, the quantifier markers and the Ø-marker. Note that the same process is never attested to occur twice; this is shown by shaded cells. The processes which could logically be combined, but are not attested, are shown by a question mark ‘?’. The combinations of two processes which have been attested are given a number that cross-references an illustrative example to be found earlier or later in this chapter.

10.8. Combinations with other verbal categories

Verbal suffixes, such as postural/directional suffixes, valency-changing affixes, and Aktionsart suffixes, are applied in a strict order: postural/directional suffixes (slot F) before valency-changing affixes (slots C/G) before Aktionsart suffixes (slot H). Auxiliary-triggering processes are normally, although not always, applied next, that is, after Aktionsart suffixes. They are therefore assigned to slots as well (slots B, I and J).
Auxiliary-triggering processes applied after postural/directional suffixes (slot F) are applied are cross-referenced in (10.64).

In a few cases, however, we find that the order of application is reversed. In (10.67), for example, the postural suffix -ani ‘SIT’ is applied after the full reduplication auxiliary-triggering process is applied (combined with an auxiliary alternation antipassive derivation; see §8.3.2). Note that if -ani had been applied first, we should have e-tse jibu-ani-jibu-ani ju-.

In (10.56a), the verb ara- ‘eat O’ first undergoes the Ø-marked auxiliarytriggering process, giving ara a- ‘eat O’, and is secondly detransitivized by the auxiliary-alternation antipassive derivation (with incorporation of its O argument jae ‘fish’), giving by jae ara ju- (fish eat be(ANTIPASS)-). Similarly, in (10.68), the Aktionsart motion suffixes -etibe and -aje are applied after the auxiliary-triggering suffix -kara ‘DESID’ is applied.

In (10.68a), ijine- ‘stray’ first takes -kara ‘DESID’, giving ijine-kara ju- ‘want to stray’. Full reduplication is then applied, giving ijine-kara-ijine-kara ju-.5 Finally, the Aktionsart -etibe ‘COME.PERM.DISTR’ is applied, giving ijine-kare-ijine-kara ju-etibe-. Similarly, in (10.68b), mare- ‘shoot at O’ first takes -kara ‘DESID’, giving mare-kara a- ‘wanting to shoot at O’. It is then reduplicated, giving mare-kara-mare-kara a- ‘wanting to shoot at O repeatedly’. Finally, the suffix -aje is applied, giving mare-kara-mare-kara a-aje-. In both examples, the two Aktionsart suffixes are clearly applied after the suffix -kara ‘DESID’ is applied. If it were not the case, the Aktionsart suffixes should be attached to the verb stem; that is, we should have the forms ijine-etibe-kara-ijine-etibe-kara ju-wa and mare-aje-kara-mare-aje-kara a-ya=ju, respectively. However, it is not possible to state whether -etibe ‘COME.PERM.DISTR’ and -aje ‘GO.DISTR’ are applied before or after reduplication, since reduplication of a non-inflecting verb does not trigger an additional auxiliary (see §10.6).

5 Recall that full reduplication does not trigger the use of an additional auxiliary (§10.6).

In (10.69), the verb iji- ‘drink O’ first takes the auxiliary-triggering suffix -kara ‘DESID’, giving iji-kara a- ‘want to drink O’, then takes the Aktionsart suffix -nuka ‘REITR’ as iji-kara a-nuka- ‘want to drink again’. If -nuka had been applied first, we should have had iji-nuka-iji-nuka a-.

Chapter 11 Predicative adjectives
A class of adjectives can be recognized in a language for underived words that (1) are different from verbs or nouns, (2) encode semantic notions such as DIMENSION, AGE, VALUE and COLOR, and (3) can fill any of the following syntactic slots: predicate of an intransitive clause, and/or copula complement within a copula clause, and/or modifier to a noun in an NP (Dixon 2004).
Cavineña has two different classes of adjectives: predicative adjectives, which only fill copula complement slots within copula clauses, and attributive adjectives, which can only be used as modifiers to a noun in an NP. Predicative adjectives are discussed at length in this chapter. Attributive adjectives are not discussed here but in §13.2.
In section 11.1, I discuss the syntactic properties of predicative adjectives. The copula complement function is presented in §11.1.1. The use of dyake ‘very’ as a modifier to predicative adjectives is discussed in §11.1.2. In §11.1.3, I show that in order to be used attributively, predicative adjectives must be used within a relative clause. The next three sections discuss two additional functions that predicative adjectives can have: adverbial function (§11.1.4) and secondary predicate function (§11.1.5).
We need to distinguish between two subclasses of predicative adjectives in Cavineña on morphological (but not syntactic or semantic) criteria:
1 — da-adjectives consist of a closed subclass of about 110 to 120 bound roots which must take an affix, typically the dummy suffix -da, or be reduplicated. They are listed exhaustively in Appendix 1 and are discussed in §11.2; 2 — independent adjectives consist of an open subclass of at least 40 to 50 basic roots which do not need to take an affix or be reduplicated. They are listed exhaustively in Appendix 2 and are discussed in §11.3.
11.1. Syntax
Predicative adjectives cannot head an NP, which is the main criterion that distinguishes them from nouns. They cannot directly modify an NP head, which is the main criterion that distinguishes them from all the NP modifiers (quantifiers, number markers and attributive adjectives). Finally, predicative adjectives cannot head the predicate which is the main criterion that distinguishes them from verbs.

358 11. Predicative adjectives

11.1.1. Copula complement function

The main function of predicative adjectives is as copula complement of a copula clause. As already discussed in §4.6.3, copula clauses have the following properties:

1 — the copula subject (CS) is encoded identically to the subject of intransitive clauses (S) and has the same syntactic properties (e.g., control of co-reference). Note that for clarity I will keep coding copula subjects as CS; 2 — the copula verb (CP) is ju- ‘be’, which is homophonous with the intransitive auxiliary. The copula verb is not obligatory. Its main function is to carry verbal affixes. Speakers very often leave out the copula when they do not judge it necessary to express the verbal categories that are encoded by these affixes; see for example (11.1c,d). Copula clauses used within relative clauses almost always omit the copula verb (see §11.1.3); 3 — the copula complement (CC) almost always precedes the copula predicate when the copula predicate is present. The copula complement can be a predicative adjective, an NP, or a PP.

Examples of da-adjectives in CC function are presented in (11.1).

Copula clauses with adjectives as CC often include a dative oblique which specifies an experiencer argument; that is, it refers to the entity that experiences the property ‘predicated’ over the S argument referent. This is illustrated with various types of adjectives in (11.3). Note that the dative obliques are in boldface.

11.1.2. Modifier dyake ‘very’
Adjectives can be the head of an adjective phrase when modified by the independent particle dyake ‘very’ (§16.1), as illustrated in (11.4).

Note that dyake does not only modify adjectives. It can also modify a verb with the meaning ‘a lot’ (§16.1).

11.1.3. Attributive function strategies

Predicative adjectives, unlike attributive adjectives, cannot directly modify the head of an NP in Cavineña. For this purpose predicative adjectives must be used within a copula relative clause. A full discussion of relative clauses (RCs) in Cavineña is provided in §13.6 and Chapter 20. In a nutshell, RCs in Cavineña are marked by =ke ‘LIG’. They normally follow the NP head but can occasionally precede it, as in (11.6a). In copula RCs, the copula predicate is almost always omitted,1 as shown in (11.5). Omitting the copula predicate in copula RCs is nevertheless not obligatory, as shown in (11.6).

11.1.4. ‘Adverbial’ function

An important number of adjectives from both subclasses, i.e., da-adjectives and independent adjectives, can function as manner adverbs; note that the complete list has not been investigated. Formally, an adjective in adverbial function in Cavineña can be recognized in the following contexts:

1 — it is used with a verb different from the copula ju- ‘be’; this would otherwise mean that it is a copula complement (see §11.1.1); 2 — it is not marked by the ligature =ke ‘LIG’; this would otherwise mean that it is in attributive function (see §11.1.3); 3 — it is not used with the verb ba- ‘see, feel’; this would otherwise mean that it is in secondary predicate function (see §11.1.5 below).

Semantically, an adjective in adverbial function modifies a verb. Examples showing da-adjectives in adverbial function are given in (11.7), with intransitive verbs, and (11.8), with transitive verbs.

Some adjectives from both subclasses cannot be used in adverbial function; note that the full list has not been investigated. In order to be used adverbially,

11.1. Syntax 363

these adjective require a headless copula relative clause within an associative postpositional phrase (marked by =tsewe ‘ASSOC’; §14.2.1). This is illustrated with the da-adjective dyai- ‘lazy’ in (11.10). As (11.10a) shows, this adjective cannot be used adverbially. However, this becomes possible by taking =tsewe ‘ASSOC’, as in (11.10b). Since postpositions do not mark adjectives but only NPs, it should be the case that the adjective belongs to an NP, i.e., in CC function within a copula RC modifying an NP head. As normally happens, the head (‘manner’) of the RC is omitted, as well as the copula predicate (ju- ‘be’) and the RC marker =ke, since it occurs in the same clitic sequence with =tsewe and precedes =tsewe.

Curiously, negated da-adjectives (§11.2.4) never appear to require the postposition =tsewe when used adverbially; whether this is also the case with negated independent adjectives remains to be investigated. This can be illustrated with the two da-adjectives kasa- ‘strong’ and masa- ‘hard’. As we saw in (11.11a) and (11.11c), they both require =tsewe when they are not negated. However, when they are negated, =tsewe is not used anymore, as shown in (11.13a) and (11.13b), respectively.

It is not clear why all negative adjectives and only certain positive adjectives can be used adverbially. A full study of how adjectives are used adverbially remains to be undertaken.

11.1.5. Secondary predicate function

Predicative adjectives can also occur in a construction with the verb ba- ‘see, feel’ (and possibly other verbs; see below), a function that will be analyzed as secondary predication. In this construction, the adjective normally precedes ba‘see’. The adjective is unmarked and optional, similarly to the adverbial function. Semantically, however, the adjective does not modify the verb but the O argument, as follows: the adjective refers to property of the O argument referent, as seen, felt, or experienced by the A argument. In English, this construction is typically translated by ‘that’ complements clauses, e.g., ‘A sees, feels, or thinks that O is ADJ’; recall, however, that there are no complement clauses in Cavineña.
Examples of da-adjectives in secondary predicate function are given in (11.14).

Any predicative adjective can apparently be used as a secondary predicate. This is notably the case for adjectives that cannot be used adverbially, as with masa- ‘hard’ and peyainime ‘sad’, shown as secondary predicates in (11.16).

Some adjectives which can occur as secondary predicates never occur adverbially. This is notably the case with abilitative adjectives, derived from verbs with -taki ‘ABIL’ (§11.3.3), as exemplified in (11.17).

(11.17) a. Rike-taki=ama =tuA

beiO ba-kware

‘They (dl) (a grandfather and his little grandson, both not very strong) felt that they couldn’t lift it (a fish that they had caught) because it was a very big fish (so they asked for help).’ ps042

See additional example in (11.80). It appears that (at least) some adjectives can function as secondary predi-
cates in combination with verbs other than ba- ‘see, feel’. In (11.18a), for example, the adjective sikaka- ‘noisy’ seems to function as a secondary predicate in combination with the verb baka- ‘hear O’. A similar analysis might be proposed in (11.18b), with the derived resultative adjective e-mutsu ‘pulled, plucked’ and the verb be- ‘bring O’.

368 11. Predicative adjectives
It is not clear whether we are dealing with the same type of construction in these examples, especially in (11.18b) where the resultative adjective e-mutsu-tirya ‘completely pulled/plucked’ occurs after the verb be- ‘bring O’ — as we saw, an adjective in secondary predicate function combining with the verb ba- ‘see, feel’ normally precedes the main predicate. This issue requires additional study.

11.2. Da-adjectives
We can divide the morphology of da-adjectives into two types. The first type consists of morphology that is obligatorily required in order for a root to form an independent (grammatical and phonological) word; this will be called the obligatory morphology. The second type consists of morphology that is optionally added ‘on top’ of the obligatory morphology; this will be called the optional morphology.
The obligatory morphology consists of the dummy suffix -da/-u ‘ASF’ (§11.2.1), reduplication (§11.2.2), the interrogative prefix eje- ‘INT’ (§11.2.3), and the negative suffix -dama ‘NEG’ (§11.2.4). The optional morphology is discussed next: augmentative suffix -si (§11.2.6) and compounding (§11.2.5).
There are no morphological processes for deriving da-adjectives from other word classes. As a result, all da-adjectives can be considered as basic. There is however an phenomenon of direct conversion where many adjectives also correspond to a verb or a noun. This is discussed in §11.2.7.

11.2.1. Dummy suffix -da/-u ‘ASF’

The suffix -da/-u ‘Adjective SuFfix’ is a dummy (i.e., semantically empty) morpheme. The two variants, -da and -u, are in complementary distribution.
The suffix -da is used in the following contexts:

1 — in citation form; 2 — when the adjective does not carry any other morphology, as in (11.1a) (repeated), (11.19) and (11.20).

The form -u is used in the following contexts:

1 — when the adjective takes the augmentative suffix -si, as in (11.21) (see more examples in §11.2.6).

Note that the forms *uke-da-si or *baji-da-si are ungrammatical. 2 — when the adjective is modified by the phrasal particle =piji ‘DIM’ (§17.2.11), as in (11.22a-c). Note that in (11.22b), the same adjective, pude‘red/brown’, is used twice: once with -u (and =piji) and once with -da.

c. [YumeCC=ke jipamu]CS ji-u=pijiCC. over.there=LIG papaya good-ASF=DIM
‘That papaya (tree) that we see in the distance is very nice.’ n5.0466

Note that without -si ‘AUGM’ or =piji, *juji-u, *pude-u and *ji-u are ungrammatical. Note also that =piji ‘DIM’ can as well mark an adjective with -da, as shown in (11.23).

over.there=LIC small.child

fat-ASF=DIM

‘That small child over there is a bit fat.’ n5.0458

It is not clear whether there is a difference in meaning between juji-u=piji, as in (11.22a), and juji-da=piji, as in (11.23). If there is one, this would mean that -da and -u are different morphemes (rather than two variants of a single dummy morpheme). This issue needs to be investigated.

11.2.2. Reduplication

Full reduplication of a da-adjective root is yet another morphological process that yields a complete grammatical word (although two phonological words). Reduplication, unlike the -da/-u suffix, which is semantically empty, adds an aspectual distributive sense to the property encoded by the adjective. Strictly speaking, reduplication encodes the fact that the property is distributed in space or time. In some cases, the distributive sense is somehow blurred and reduplication acquires a mere attenuating sense, meaning ‘more or less’ or ‘approximately’.
In (11.24), the firefly’s twinkling light is described by reduplicating the adjective weka- ‘bright, shiny’.

big-REDUP =1PL

be-REM.PAST

‘We (me and my brothers) grew up (lit. grew up a little bit many times).’ nk027

In some cases, a reduplicated da-adjective only has an attenuating (not distributive) sense. Emerenciano Sepa explained to me that the eggs of the ‘waparikwama’ partridge have a uniform reddish color. Still, they are described by reduplicating pude- ‘red/brown’, as in (11.28).

pude-pude=jipeneeCC. red/brown-REDUP=ALMOST
‘The eggs of the ‘waparikwama’ partridge are almost reddish.’ di1378

A few examples are available of full reduplication of a da-adjective root together with its dummy suffix -da (not -u). This occurs with ji- ‘good’, japa‘far’, juji- ‘fat’ and ba- ‘cold’. Full reduplication of ba- ‘cold’ together with -da

372 11. Predicative adjectives

is illustrated in (11.29b), which is a reply from Julio Mayo to my greeting (in (11.29a)),3 one (fresh) morning in Galilea.

‘I’m fine (lit. good). (I am/It is) just a little bit cold.’ n5.0523

In this example, the adjective ba- ‘cold’ is given an attenuative meaning. But this meaning could as well be an effect of the particle =piji ‘DIM’. Reduplication of a da-adjective with the suffix -da requires more study.

11.2.3. Interrogative prefix eje- ‘INT’

Da-adjective roots can take an interrogative prefix eje- ‘INTerrogative’ and form an independent grammatical word. The prefix eje- is used to question the degree of the quality described by the adjective. Unfortunately, I have very few examples of this prefix. Adjectives found with eje- are exhaustively listed in (11.30).

(11.30)

eje-ari eje-baru eje-bikwe eje-de-u eje-japa eje-ji-u eje-junu

‘how big’ ‘how tall’ ‘how heavy’ ‘how deep’ ‘how far’ ‘how good’ ‘how long’

eje-kasa eje-kini eje-tsunu eje-uke eje-uma eje-uu

‘how strong’ ‘how wide’ ‘how long, when’ ‘how hot’ ‘how many’ ‘how tasty’

Note that a suffix -u is added to the monosyllabic adjective roots ji- ‘good’ and de- ‘deep’. The fact that this suffix is not used with polysyllabic roots suggests that it is the same (epenthetic) suffix that is added to monosyllabic verbal roots when they do not take affixes (§2.6.6); that is, it is not the -u variant of the dummy suffix -da/-u discussed in §11.2.1. However, note that with verbs, the epenthetic vowel u is only added to bare (monosyllabic) roots, while in the case of ji- and de-, there is the presence of a prefix. This could be an indication that

3 This is the standard way of greeting in Cavineña.

11.2. Da-adjectives 373

eje is a separate phonological word (rather than a prefix). More work is needed to verify this hypothesis.
The prefix eje- ‘INT’ is first illustrated with the conversational turn in (11.31), volunteered by Emerenciano Sepa.

A similar conversational turn showing the interrogative prefix on ji- ‘good’ can be seen in (11.29).
Additional examples showing adjectives with the interrogative prefix are given in (11.32).

11.2.4. Negative suffix -dama ‘NEG’

Da-adjective roots can take a negative suffix -dama ‘NEG’ and form an independent grammatical word. This is illustrated in (11.35).

See also jika-dama ‘clean, not lush’ in (11.1d) and baru-dama ‘short, not tall’ in (11.22a).
Note that -dama is most likely related to -da ‘ASF’ (§11.2.1) — they both occupy the same slot in the adjective structure. One could analyze -dama as consisting of -da and a (negative) suffix -ma. Note that -ma is formally very similar to the negative particle =ama, suggesting that they are historically related. Note that ma is also found in the negative auxiliary-triggering verbal suffixes -karama ‘DESID.NEG’ and -jakama ‘CEASELESSLY’ (§10.1.3). I have nevertheless preferred treating -dama as a unitary suffix because:

1 — ma does not occur independently from -da (at least in the context of adjective); 2 — nothing can occur between da and ma.

Note that it is still possible to negate a predicative adjective with the phrasal particle =ama ‘NEG’ (§17.2.9). As such, the adjective needs to be ‘complete’; that is, it needs to include an obligatory affix or be reduplicated. This is illustrated with interrogative prefix eje- as in (11.36a) and reduplicated in (11.36b).

An adjective that includes -da cannot be negated by =ama, unless =ama has scope over a particle that already marks the adjective, as with =kwita ‘RESTR’ in (11.37). Note that the adjective is in adverbial function in this example.

There are no cases where =ama negates an adjective already negated with -dama (i.e., ADJ-dama=ama) but this might be a possible combination.

11.2.5. Compounding
A predicative da-adjective can form a compound with a noun or a verb. In these compounds, the adjective has the following properties:
1 — it is the head, since the compound is still a (predicative) adjective (rather than a noun or a verb); 2 — it comes last; 3 — it still requires the obligatory morphology, normally the dummy suffix -da/-u, to form a complete grammatical word,
A compounded noun must be an e-noun, i.e., a noun which requires an eprefix formative and which normally refers to the part of an entity (see §12.3.1); it cannot be an independent noun or a kinship noun. The complex adjective has

376 11. Predicative adjectives

a more specific scope of reference, narrowed down to the part encoded by the compounded noun; this is roughly equivalent to English compounds like bignosed, long-legged, etc. The full list of compounds involving nouns attested in the data is given in (11.38). Note that the nouns and adjectives which occur more than once are in boldface.

A compounded verb can be of any type, i.e., inflecting or non-inflecting, intransitive or transitive. The complex adjective that results has a more specific scope of reference, narrowed down to the type of activity it is associated with. It is quite likely that verb compounding with predicative adjectives is a reflection of the fact that adjectives can have adverbial functions in this language (§11.1.4). It can be observed that a complex adjective containing a verb is very similar in meaning to the same verb modified by the same adjective in adverbial function. This can be illustrated with the adjective jebu- ‘strong (noise)’ and the verb kike-/keke- ‘shout’ in (11.39a), where the adjective and the verb form a compound, and (11.39b), where the adjective is in adverbial function.

Morpho-syntactic properties of noun-adjective compounds and verbadjective compounds are as follows:

1 — the resulting complex adjective requires obligatory morphology, i.e., the suffix -da/-u ‘ASF’, the reduplication of the adjective root,6 or the suffix -dama ‘NEG’. Note that no example could be found with the interrogative prefix ejealthough this combination appears logically possible. Illustrative examples with compounded nouns are given in (11.44), and with compounded verbs (11.39b) (repeated) and (11.45).

See also kati-uje-da ‘sting painfully’ in (11.40a). 2 — the noun/verb root occurs immediately before the adjective and nothing can occur in between; 3 — the e- prefix of a compounded e-noun is obligatorily omitted, as expected when an e-noun enters a derivational process (see §12.3.1). See examples in (11.44a,b.c), with the e-nouns -rumu ‘throat’, -biti ‘skin’ and -piti ‘neck’; 4 — a verb cannot be compounded with its affixes, although the compounding of a reduplicated verb (with antipassive effect; §8.3.1) appears to be possible, as suggested by the form kuru-kuru-ari- ‘chewing a lot’, from kuru- ‘chew O’, given above in (11.42); 5 — in (at least) one example, given in (11.46) below, a sequence of two e-nouns, -bi ‘arm’ and -tsaru ‘hair’, are compounded together with an adjective. Apparently, the first noun is a juxtaposed modifier to the second, in what looks like the NP juxtaposition construction discussed in §13.1;

11.2.6. Augmentative suffix -si ‘AUGM’

Intensification of the property encoded by a da-adjective (as well as an independent adjective; see §11.3) can be achieved morphologically with the augmentative suffix -si ‘AUGM’. Note that this is only one of the possible ways of intensifying the property denoted by an adjective in Cavineña. This can be done intonationally, via the specific intensifier contour (§2.8.3). This can also be achieved through the modifier particle dyake ‘very’ (§11.1.2) or with phrasal particles such as =kwita ‘RESTR’ (§17.2.4) or =ebari ‘INTENS’ (§17.2.12). Note however that, contrary to -si, none of these intensifier morphemes are restricted to adjectives.
In order for the augmentative suffix -si to be used, the adjective requires the -u allomorph of the dummy suffix -da/-u ‘ASF’, the negative suffix -dama ‘NEG’, or a reduplicated root. The suffix -si cannot apply on a bare root, a root + -da, or a root with the interrogative prefix eje-.
Examples (11.48) and (11.49) show the augmentative suffix -si on adjectives with the dummy suffix -u.

Example (11.49) comes from a conversational turn between Antonio Yubanera (A) and Cosme Mayo (V) discussing Cavineña traditional canoes that could carry up to six persons.

V: Pa! Kasa-u-si! INTERJ strong-ASF-AUGM

(*kasa-si)

‘Wow! (These canoes were) very strong!’ ab203

In one case, with the adjective uu- ‘tasty’, the suffix -si appears to occur directly on the root without the use of the dummy suffix -u, giving the form uusi, rather than the otherwise expected *uuusi. Most probably this exception can be explained by the fact that a sequence of three u vowels is avoided.
In the texts available, the augmentative suffix is not found occurring on a negated adjective (i.e., an adjective with -dama). However, (11.50), volunteered by Emerenciano Sepa, suggests that this is an acceptable combination.

It was mentioned that dyake ‘very’ and the phrasal particles =ebari ‘INTENS’ and =kwita ‘RESTR’ are also used to intensify the property denoted by an attributive adjective. For some reason, dyake never co-occurs with -si ‘AUGM’. The phrasal particles, on the other hand, are often used in addition to the augmentative suffix -si ‘AUGM’ to further intensify the meaning, as with =kwita ‘RESTR’ in (11.21a) (repeated) and =ebari ‘INTENS’ in (11.52).

11.2.7. Direct conversion

The subclass of da-adjectives is closed to both borrowing and internal derivation. There is however a process of direct conversion between the da-adjectives and the classes of nouns and verbs.
About 45-50 da-adjectives have a corresponding noun. In many cases, it is an e-noun, as in (11.53), or an independent noun with an abstract meaning, as in (11.54). Note that the lists are not exhaustive.

Considering that so many da-adjectives have a corresponding noun or verb, one could be tempted to suggest a derivational process between these classes, such as one that would yield new da-adjectives from the noun or verb classes. The derivation could be unmarked or marked by any of the obligatory morphology that predicative adjectives take: -da/-u ‘ASF’, -dama ‘NEG’, eje- ‘INT’, or reduplication. One could even go as far as saying that there is no class of daadjectives per se in Cavineña, i.e., all the da-adjectives are derived from the classes of nouns or verbs.
I prefer to avoid these analyses, at least from a synchronic perspective, for the following reasons:

1 — one cannot make a da-adjective out of any noun or any verb, even when the semantics would seem compatible. For example, the e-noun -rami ‘flesh’ has a corresponding da-adjective, rami- ‘fleshy’, but not the semantically close -tsaru ‘hair’ — there is an adjective meaning ‘hairy’ but it is an independent adjective, tsaru-tsaru, derived by full reduplication (§11.3.2). And similarly for verbs, the transitive verb jemi- ‘grate (soft material)’ has a corresponding da-adjective jemi- ‘powder-like’, but the semantically close transitive verb jere‘grate (hard material)’ does not; 2 — even though there are some semantic regularities between the pairs — for instance, a number of adjectives can be glossed as ‘having many/a lot of N’, as with rami- ‘fleshy, having a lot of flesh’ or tsau- ‘having many bones’ —, one cannot always predict the meaning of any adjective from a corresponding noun or verb. For example, the adjective tiki- ‘shiny’ cannot mean ‘having a lot of fire’; it would require a different formula, such as ‘being like N’. And with the adjective atuka- ‘excellent hunter’ and its corresponding noun -atuka ‘eye’, the meaning connection remains quite obscure.

The correspondences between da-adjectives, nouns and verbs is thus better analyzed, at least synchronically, in terms of idiosyncratic direct conversions from

11.3. Independent adjectives 387
class to class rather than in terms of a derivational process. Note that this is a very frequent phenomenon in many languages (Evans and Osada 2005).

11.3. Independent adjectives

Independent adjectives have the following morpho-syntactic properties:

1 — independent adjectives are bare roots that form independent grammatical words without the recourse to obligatory morphology. They never take -da/-u ‘ASF’, -dama ‘NEG’ — they are negated with the phrasal negative particle =ama, as in (11.62) — or eje- ‘INT’, and are never compounded with a noun or a verb;

yukeneri=amaCC ju-ya. intelligent=NEG be-IMPFV

‘Their child could be (born) stupid (lit. a child could be not intelligent to any of them).’ bn030

2 — independent adjectives can take the augmentative suffix -si ‘AUGM’:

(11.63) a. Peyainime-siCC =mi-keCS, Hermano! Ejebuchajuatsu?

sad-AUGM

b. Isawe-siCC =shana =tu-keCS. deaf-AUGM =PITY =3SG-FM
‘He is very deaf, the poor guy.’ n5.0585

3 — independent adjectives can be (fully) reduplicated. The resulting meaning of this process is still unclear; there are very few examples available and these appear to have contradictory meanings. In (11.64a), for instance, the reduplication of chacha ‘alive’ has an attenuative meaning. But in (11.64b), the reduplication of esiri ‘old’ has an intensifying meaning.

4 — independent adjectives are an open class. They can be derived from other word classes by the following processes: adjectivization of nouns by -ki ‘WITH’ or -ma ‘WITHOUT’ (§11.3.1), adjectivization of nouns by full reduplication (§11.3.2), adjectivization of verbs by -taki ‘ABIL’ (§11.3.3), and adjectivization of verbs by e- ‘RES’ or -ma ‘RES.NEG’ (§11.3.4). A few additional nonproductive derivational processes are discussed in §11.3.5.

11.3.1. Adjectivization of nouns by -ki ‘WITH’ and -ma ‘WITHOUT’

The suffixes -ki and -ma are used to derive adjectives from nouns. These adjectives express the property of possessing (with -ki) or explicitly not possessing (with -ma) the entity denoted by the noun they are derived from, as illustrated in (11.65) and (11.66).

radio-WITH be-IMPFV

‘It looks like we won’t have the (shortwave) radio (lit. we won’t be with a radio)!’ tb087

Note that there is no verb meaning ‘have’ in Cavineña. The derivation of these adjectives and their use in copula clauses is therefore one way to encode possession at the clause level.9
Adjectivization of nouns with -ki ‘WITH’ and -ma ‘WITHOUT’ is probably fully productive. The process can potentially be applied to any type of nouns: e-nouns, kinship nouns — it is at least attested with wane ‘wife’ and awe ‘husband’ — and independent nouns. The process is very frequently applied to borrowed terms (i.e., independent nouns) such as kamisa ‘shirt’, from Spanish camisa, in (11.65a,b), and radio ‘(shortwave) radio transmitter’, from Spanish radio, in (11.66b).
E-nouns taking -ki ‘WITH’ and -ma ‘WITHOUT’ occur without their e-prefix, as shown in (11.67) with the two e-nouns -tseri ‘fat’ and -tsau ‘bone’.

The two kinship nouns wane ‘wife’ and awe ‘husband’ can take -ki ‘WITH’ and -ma ‘WITHOUT’. As such, they occur without their otherwise obligatory possessor inflections, as illustrated in (11.68), with wane ‘wife’, and (11.69), with awe ‘husband’. Note that it is not known whether other kinship nouns can also take -ki and/or -ma.

I have presented -ki ‘WITH’ and -ma ‘WITHOUT’ as word class changing markers, i.e., morphemes that apply to a noun word and turn it into a (predicative) adjective word. However, in a few examples, -ki ‘WITH’ appears to have scope over full NPs, suggesting a different analysis. In (11.70a), for instance, the purportedly adjectivized noun ujeje ‘disease’ is preceded by a demonstrative (copula) relative clause (§13.6). And in (11.70b), the purportedly adjectivized noun mutiru ‘hat’ is followed by an attributive adjective (§13.2), in which case -ki is attached to the attributive adjective, not to the noun.

If indeed -ki can have scope over a full noun phrase rather than over a single noun word, it would probably be better not to analyze this morpheme as a word class changing marker — a possible alternative could be to analyze it as an instrumental-like enclitic postposition. For the time being, and until more is known on this morpheme, I will nevertheless retain the word class changing analysis since such examples are quite marginal. Note also that this phenomenon is not attested with -ma ‘WITHOUT’.
The suffix -ki is lexicalized in nijuki ‘drunk’, from -niju ‘heart’ (lit. with heart). The two adjectives dameki ‘lucky’ and maki ‘pregnant’, which both end with ki, and the adjective mema ‘empty’, which ends with ma, are possibly de-

rived from nouns, although these putative nouns cannot be identified synchronically. Historical and comparative work is needed to determine if such nouns could have existed at earlier stages of the language.
There is finally a peculiar use of (apparently) the same adjectivizer suffix -ki where it is found attached to, and lexicalized with, the associative postposition =tsewe ‘ASSOC’ or its corresponding associative suffix -tsewe (§14.2.1 and §15.1.2). The resulting forms behave like complex independent predicative adjectives meaning ‘sibling of X’, X being the referent of the NP argument of the associative postposition or the referent of the independent pronoun. Examples with these forms are given in (11.71), with an associative PP, and (11.72), with associative pronouns.

11.3.2. Adjectivization of nouns by full reduplication

A few independent adjectives are derived by full reduplication of a noun. Their meaning is ‘having a lot of/many N’. This derivational process is attested with eleven nouns in the available corpus, as listed in (11.73a), with e-nouns, and (11.73b), with independent nouns.

11.3.3. Adjectivization of verbs by -taki ‘ABIL’
The suffix -taki ‘ABILitative’ is used to derive independent abilitative adjectives from verbs. The derived adjectives can have either of the following two

11.3. Independent adjectives 393

It will be noted that abilitative adjectives are very often negated, as in (11.75a). As such they take the particle =ama ‘NEG’; that is, there are no specific abilitative negative suffixes.
Adjectivization with -taki ‘ABIL’ is probably fully productive. This suffix can be applied to any type of verbs, intransitive or transitive, inflecting or noninflecting verbs. Abilitative adjectives derived from intransitive inflecting verbs can be seen in (11.75) above and (11.76) below.

Copula clauses with abilitative adjectives derived from transitive verbs often express the original transitive subject (i.e., the original A argument) by an oblique in the dative case. This can be a dative bound pronoun, as in (11.77b), a dative independent pronoun, as in (11.77c), or a dative NP, as in (11.77d). Note however that the expression of the original A argument is not obligatory, as in (11.77a).
Abilitative adjectives derived from non-inflecting verbs are illustrated in (11.78a), with an intransitive verb, and (11.78b), with a transitive verb.

Abilitative adjectives are very often used in secondary predicate function (with ba- ‘see’; §11.1.5). This allows the speaker to express the fact that the ability/non-ability of a participant (in O function) to perform a verb event is viewed from the eyes, the perspective or the feelings of another participant (in A function) — note that when abilitative adjectives are used as CC, the property that they express is viewed from the perspective of the speaker. Examples of abilitative adjectives in secondary predicate function are given in (11.80a), based on a transitive verb, and (11.80b), based on an intransitive verb.

Note that in most of the examples available, the abilitative adjective is derived from a transitive verb; that is, examples such as (11.80b), based on intransitive verbs are quite rare.
Two abilitative adjectives have been found with an idiosyncratic meaning. The first is batakiama ‘missing’, which comes from ba- ‘see’, the suffix -taki ‘ABIL’ and the negative particle =ama (lit. ‘cannot be seen’). It is illustrated in (11.81a). The second is kwejataki ‘respecful, well-educated’, which comes from kweja- ‘inform’ (lit. ‘can be informed’). It is illustrated in (11.81b).

Abilitative adjectives can only be derived from verbs; that is, the abilitative suffix -taki cannot be attached to other word classes. In one example, (11.82) below, -taki is found attached to the copula verb/predicate ju- ‘be’ with the adjective nawi-ma, a resultative derived adjective, as copula complement. Note that resultative adjectives are discussed in the following section.

11.3.4. Adjectivization of verbs by e- ‘RES’ and -ma ‘RES.NEG’

The prefix e- ‘RESultative’ and the suffix -ma ‘RESultative NEGative’ are used to derive independent resultative adjectives from any type of verb, whether inflecting or non-inflecting, and intransitive or transitive. An adjective derived by the prefix e- ‘RES’ has a positive value. It expresses a state that results from the occurrence of the event denoted by the verb the adjective is derived from, as illustrated in (11.83a), based on an intransitive verb, and (11.83b), based on a transitive verb.

The original subject (A) of a transitive verb is often expressed by an oblique in dative case. This can be a dative bound pronoun, as in (11.83b), (11.84b) and (11.85), dative NP, as in (11.86a), or a dative independent pronoun.

A number of independent adjectives have a word initial e or a word final ma, suggesting that they could have resulted from the application of the resultative markers to a verb base, as with esiri ‘old (by aging)’, ejitaju ‘visible’ and mema ‘empty’. However, the putative verb bases cannot be identified in present day Cavineña so that no conclusive statement can be made until historical/comparative work is conducted.11

11 Esiri ‘old’ could perhaps come from siri- ‘break, tear’ (lit. broken, torn). As for mema ‘empty’, it could as well have been derived from a noun since -ma also derives adjectives form nouns (§11.3.1).

400 11. Predicative adjectives

11.3.5. Miscellaneous

In addition to the morphological processes of derivation described in the pre-
ceding sections, a number of independent adjectives have been directly con-
verted from nouns. Such nouns and their meaning as independent adjectives are listed exhaustively in (11.90):12

(11.90) a. independent adjectives directly converted from an e-noun

ewikani ‘tipsy’ etsurikani ‘having a throat ache’

b. independent adjectives directly converted from an independent
noun

baara ujera

‘feverish’ ‘painful’

baara ujera

‘fever’ ‘pain’

It is not clear at the present stage how productive this process is, whether it applies to particular semantic fields rather than others and how predictable the resulting sense is. Note that the examples available essentially concern the field of disease and that the adjectives mean ‘having/catching the disease’.
The adjective peyainime ‘sad’ is presumably a lexicalized noun phrase with the quantifier peya ‘other’ and the head noun -nime ‘thought’13 (lit. other thought).
A number of independent adjectives end with the formative ama, such as pureama ‘happy’, yuama ‘bad’, aama ‘not exist’ and aijama ‘not exist at all’. They have most likely arisen from the lexicalization of the negative phrasal particle =ama (see §17.2.9) on forms that are no longer recognizable.

12 Note that the independent adjectives with a corresponding e-noun include the e- pre-
fix. 13 This e-noun takes an irregular prefix i (instead of e-).

Chapter 12 Noun phrase structure — an overview
This chapter has two goals. The first is to introduce the reader to the structure of the NP (§12.1). It will be shown that an NP in Cavineña consists of 8 structural slots. There is one slot for the head — which must be a noun — and 7 slots for modifiers — they are: relative clause (used in two different slots), quantifier, genitive modifier, juxtaposed noun, attributive adjective and number marker.
The second goal of this chapter is a full discussion of the class of nouns; NP modifiers are fully discussed in Chapter 13. There are three subclasses of nouns, distinguished by morpho-syntactic criteria: (1) e-nouns, which must take a dummy prefix e- and refer to parts of entities (§12.3), (2) kinship nouns, which are inflected for the person of their possessor (§12.4), and (3) independent nouns, which do not take e- nor any possessor inflection, and which refer to fauna, flora, etc. (§12.5).
Kinship nouns can be said to be inalienably possessed because for these forms, marking the possessor is obligatory. One could argue that e-nouns are also inalienably possessed, on the basis of their peculiar prefix e- and the fact that they encode notions that are very often expressed by inalienably possessed nouns in various languages (body parts, etc.). The possibility of analyzing e-nouns as inalienably possessed is considered (and refuted) in §12.6.
Independent nouns never take either the e- prefix nor the possessor inflections. However, they can take a range of derivational affixes which do not occur with nouns of the other groups. Processes deriving independent nouns from other word classes or from other nouns are discussed in §12.7.
12.1. NP structure — overview
The NP structure can be described in terms of 8 slots (from A to H), each associated with a particular type of constituent, as shown in the following slot diagram:

406 12. Noun phrase structure — an overview

Slot A: Slot B: Slot C: Slot D: Slot E: Slot F: Slot G: Slot H:

Relative clause Quantifier Genitive modifier Juxtaposed noun Head noun Attributive adjective Number Relative clause

A brief description of each slot and the elements that fill them is given below:

— slots A and H are filled by relative clauses (RCs). RCs are marked by a special enclitic =ke ‘LIG’ that is attached to the last phonological word of the RC. Verbal RCs tend to be postposed to the NP head in slot H as in (12.1a). A number of copula RCs, notably demonstrative RCs1 and interrogative RCs, only occur preposed to the NP head in slot A as in (12.1b). More information on RCs is provided in §13.6 and Chapter 20;

— slot B is filled by quantifier modifiers. Quantifier modifiers consist of logical quantifiers (e.g., dutya ‘all’, exemplified in (12.2)), numerals (e.g., beta ‘two), a quantifier question marker (ejeuma ‘how many’) and the word peya ‘other’. A full discussion is given in §13.5;

A full discussion of genitive modifiers is in §13.4. — slots D and E are filled by nouns. A noun in slot D functions as a modifier. A noun in slot E functions as the NP head. An example with both slots D and E filled is given in (12.4):

There are three subclasses of nouns: e-nouns, kinship nouns and independent nouns. A full discussion of nouns is found in the remainder of this chapter. Nouns functioning as NP modifiers (in slot D) are discussed at length in §13.1. — slot F is filled by an attributive adjective, as illustrated in (12.5):

408 12. Noun phrase structure — an overview

A full discussion of attributive adjectives is in §13.2. — slot G is filled by number markers. There are three number markers: =ekatse ‘DL’, illustrated in (12.6), =kwana ‘PL’ (general plural) and =ekana ‘PL’ (plural for kinship nouns). Number markers, unlike other NP modifiers, are not phonologically independent but enclitics.

there-LOC =PITY ox=DL

miserable-ASF

‘The oxen (dl) were miserable (having to pull the terribly heavy cart).’ ka239

A full discussion of number markers is in §13.3. None of the NP constituents (including the head) is obligatory in a Cavineña
NP. However, there are a number of distributional restrictions, as follows:

1 — if slots C (genitive modifier), D (juxtaposed noun) or F (attributive adjective) are filled, then slot E (nominal head) must be filled as well; 2 — if slot G (number modifier), is filled, then there must be at least one other NP constituent (so that the number modifier can be phonologically attached to it).

Case markers and phrasal particles are not treated as part of the NP structure. Although are both attached to an NP (following slot H), they are not part of the NP strictly speaking. Case markers do not have the modifying function the other NP constituents have; they function at a higher level as relational operators which relate the NP as a whole to other types of constituents such as the predicate or a noun (for genitive phrases); see Chapter 14 for a full discussion. Phrasal particles can have a modifying function but none are specific to the noun phrase — they can as well modify a predicate, an independent particle, etc. Similarly to case markers, phrasal particles are considered to operate at a higher level of organization than the NP per se; see Chapter 17 for a full discussion. Case markers and phrasal particles are thus not further discussed in this chapter.

12.2. Nouns — overview
Nouns occur in slot E as NP head or slot D as NP modifiers. Nouns in Cavineña are morphologically rather simple (especially compared to verbs). Cavineña does not have any grammatical category of class2 or gender. The language
2 Arguably, the morphological distinction between the nouns that denote parts of enti-

12.3. E-nouns 409
marks number and case but these are clitics (i.e., separate grammatical words) which operate at the NP level, and not affixes in the noun word.
There are three subclasses of nouns distinguished morpho-syntactically:
1 — e-nouns consist of a closed class of about 100 to 150 terms which must take a dummy prefix e-. This prefix drops in a number of circumstances. E-nouns refer to parts of entities, such as -tsau ‘bone’, -rami ‘flesh’, -jaki ‘leaf’, -tiri ‘root’, etc.; 2 — kinship nouns consist of a small class of about 30 terms which are (obligatorily) inflected for the person of their possessor. They express kinship relations, such as tata ‘father’, anu ‘grandmother’, etc.; 3 — independent nouns consist of an open class of a few thousand terms which do not take any e- prefix nor any possessor inflections; they do however take derivational morphology. They refer to fauna, flora, artifact, proper nouns, etc.
The three subclasses of nouns are discussed in turn below: e-nouns in §12.3, kinship nouns in §12.4, and independent nouns in §12.5.
12.3. E-nouns
E-nouns are a closed class of about 100 to (possibly) 150 members. The class does not accept either borrowed or derived terms. E-nouns encode mostly parts of entities, although there are some exceptions. A full list of identified e-nouns is given in the appendix to this chapter.
12.3.1. Prefix e- ‘NPF’
E-nouns have the peculiarity of requiring an obligatory prefix e- ‘Noun PreFix’ which can be said to be semantically empty (unless one analyzes it as a noun class marker).3 This prefix becomes y- before the vowel a-, as in y-atuka ‘eye’, y-akwa ‘NPF-chest’, y-aa ‘branch’, etc. It never occurs before the vowels i, e, u or the consonant y. In other words, e-noun roots only begin with the vowel a or with a consonant other than y.4
ties (e-nouns) and those that do not (kinship nouns and independent nouns) might be analyzed as a noun class system in the language. 3 Note that e-nouns are a characteristic feature of Tacanan languages; see Pitman (1980: 75) and Emkow (2006: chapter 7) for Araona, Chavarría (2000) and Vuillermet (2006, forthcoming) for Ese Ejja, Key (1968: 92) and Guillaume (2006c) for Reyesano, and Ottaviano and Ottaviano (1989) for Tacana. 4 The reasons for these restrictions are unknown.

The dummy prefix is normally deleted when the noun enters a derivational process, as described in §12.3.1.1, or when it is preceded by a juxtaposed noun, as discussed in §12.3.1.2.

12.3.1.1. Deletion of e- in derivational processes

The prefix e- is normally deleted when the e-noun enters one of the following three derivational processes:

1 — adjectivization with -ki ‘WITH’ or -ma ‘WITHOUT’ (see §11.3.1), as illustrated in (12.8), with the e-nouns -tse ‘tooth’ and -na ‘water’.

(12.8)

a. e-tse ‘tooth’ tse-ki ‘with tooth (e.g., baby)’ tse-ma ‘toothless (e.g., elder)’

(*e-tse-ki) (*e-tse-ma)

b. e-na ‘water’

na-ki ‘with water, juicy (e.g., watermelon)’ (*e-na-ki)

na-ma ‘without water, waterless’

(*e-na-ma)

See also tsau-ma ‘without bones’ in (12.23a) below.

2 — compounding with da-adjectives; this produces complex da-adjectives (see §11.2.5). This is illustrated in (12.9), with the compounding of the e-nouns -bi ‘arm’, -biti ‘skin’ and -wikani ‘nose’ and the da-adjectives baru- ‘tall’, misi‘thick’ and ari- ‘big’.

3 — incorporation within transitive verbs (see §5.2.5), as illustrated in (12.10), with e-nouns -akwa ‘chest’, -rumu ‘throat’ and -wi ‘beak’, and the verbs tsuru-‘meet O’, tubu- ‘cut O’ and risi- ‘tie O’:

(*e-rumu-tubu-)

c. e-wi risiwi-risi-

‘beak’ ‘tie O’ ‘tie the neck of O’

(*e-wi-risi-)

12.3.1.2. Deletion of e- in noun juxtaposition

The prefix e- is normally deleted when it is preceded by a modifying noun in slot D of the NP structure; see a full discussion of this in §13.1. The examples in (12.11) illustrate e-nouns -rami ‘flesh’ and -jaki ‘leaf’ modified by the (independent) nouns waka ‘cow’ and tumi ‘motacú palm’.

The majority of e-noun roots have more than two syllables and can form independent phonological words even if they do not take affixes (whether the eprefix of a derivational affix) or if they are not compounded with another root; recall that a phonological word must have two syllables in Cavineña (§3.1.2). However, five e-noun roots are monosyllabic. They are given in (12.12):

(12.12)

-bi ‘arm’ -ka ‘egg’ -na ‘water’

-tse ‘tooth’ -wi ‘beak’

When these roots take an affix or a compounded root, they become part of poly-
syllabic grammatical words which form perfect independent phonological
words. However, when they don’t take an affix or a compounded root, they
become clitics. This can be observed in noun juxtaposition structures, where the
monosyllabic e- nouns are phonologically attached to the preceding modifier; that is, the Hn(M)M pitch contour applies to the modifying noun and the e- noun as a whole. This is exemplified in (12.13).5

‘The water of the (Beni) river is red/brown.’ di1111

12.3.1.3. Irregular e-nouns
Two e-nouns are irregular with respect to the dummy prefix: the e-noun meaning ‘thorn’ takes an a- prefix as a-kwija (*e-kwija); the e-noun meaning ‘thought’ takes an i- prefix as i-nime (*e-nime).

5 Note that in (12.13b), -na is also compounded with an adjective, pude- ‘red/brown’.

12.3. E-nouns 413

The e-noun that means ‘foot’ is pronounced either -wachi or -wasi when it takes the prefix e-, i.e., e-wachi or e-wasi, in free variation. However, when it is preceded by a juxtaposed noun, it seems that it can only be pronounced -wasi, as in mesa wasi ‘table leg’ or kuchi wasi ‘pig foot’ — *mesa wachi and *kuchi wachi were judged ungrammatical by Alfredo Tavo.
The e-noun meaning ‘stream’ is pronounced sepere when it is preceded by a juxtaposed noun, as in sawa sepere ‘trahira (fish) stream’. However, with the prefix e-, it is pronounced spere, as e-spere; that is, the vowel e from the first syllable of the root is deleted.
The e-noun meaning ‘owner’ is mechiki when it takes the prefix e-, i.e., e-mechiki, while it is metse when it is preceded by a juxtaposed noun, as in chapa metse ‘dog owner’ or tee metse ‘garden owner’.
Occasionally an e-noun preceded by a slot D modifier does not lose the eprefix. This phenomenon is normally accepted by speakers in elicitation but is very rare in texts. Moreover, it does not appear to be associated with any clear meaning differences. In (12.14), for example, -kaka loses its e- prefix in (a.), as normally expected, but not in (b.)

414 12. Noun phrase structure — an overview

The prefix e- of some e-nouns is deleted in some contexts but not in others. This happens with -aa ‘branch’, as shown in (12.16). Here, e- is never deleted in noun juxtaposition, as in (a.), or adjectivization, as in (b.) However, e- is deleted in noun incorporation, as in (c.)

c. aa-tububranch-cut-
‘cut branch of O’ n5.0304

(*y-aa-tubu-)

Another e-noun showing the same phenomenon is -marikaka ‘cooking pot’, as shown in (12.17). The prefix e- is not deleted in noun juxtaposition, as in (a.), but it is deleted in adjectivization, as in (b.)

A number of nouns begin with a vowel e (or glide y before a) which cannot be segmented (at least synchronically). In other words, they never lose e- (or y-). These nouns are thus treated as independent nouns. This was noted with eja ‘nest’ in (12.18), eyu ‘palm heart’ in (12.19), epu ‘village’ in (12.20), yawa ‘ground’ in (12.21) and yachi ‘pampa’ in (12.22):

(*achi-ma)

It is quite possible that these words belonged to the class of e-nouns at an older stage of the language but later on the prefix froze, perhaps under the pressure of Spanish which does not show any such morphology.
Finally, there are in the corpus a fair number of nouns (about 40) which begin with the vowel e (or glide y before a) and which refer to parts of entities, but for which it is not known whether the word-initial vowel e (or glide y) is segmentable or not; that is, the data does not provide any examples of these nouns in any of contexts where the putative e- prefix could drop. These forms are still listed in the appendix but their word-initial e (or y before a) has not been segmented. More work will be required to decide on the exact status of these items.

416 12. Noun phrase structure — an overview

12.3.2. Semantics

The great majority of e-nouns refer to parts of entities, with some exceptions, as follows:

— body parts: 33 terms refer to external body parts; 9 terms refer to internal body parts; — plant parts: 8 terms; — landscape parts: 12 terms; — spatial relations: 9 terms; — miscellaneous concepts (e.g., ‘name’, ‘trace’, etc.): 17 terms

One surprising e-noun is -tsena ‘worm’; fauna entities are normally expressed by independent nouns. It is illustrated in (12.23) with two examples volunteered by Alfredo Tavo, showing it with the e- prefix in (a.) and without the e- prefix b.

‘brother-in-law (sister’s husband)’ ‘broth.-in-law (husband’s brother)’ ‘uncle (father’s brother, FB)’ ‘aunt (mother’s sister, MZ)’ ‘uncle (mother’s brother, MB)’ ‘aunt (father’s sister, FZ)’ ‘grandfather’ ‘grandmother’ ‘nephew’ ‘niece’ ‘nephew’ or ‘niece’ ‘grandchild (male or female)’ ‘compadre’ ‘comadre’

A few kinship nouns are (at least partly) analyzable:

1— the term bakujuna ‘daughter’ most likely comes from bakwa ‘child’ followed by the e-noun -puna ‘female’ (with sound change kw  ku and p  j); 2 — the terms awiine ‘brother-in-law (husband’s brother)’, tatiine ‘uncle FB’ and kwaine ‘aunt MZ’ quite transparently involve the terms awe ‘husband’, tata ‘father’ and kwaa ‘mother’, respectively, and a formative ine, which could be glossed by ‘same sex sibling’. The exact origin of this formative is unclear since no such term can be found in present day Cavineña; 3 — the four terms tatapuji ‘stepfather’, kwaapuji ‘stepmother’, bakwapuji ‘adopted son’ and bakujunapuji ‘adopted daughter’ clearly involve the terms tata ‘father’, kwaa ‘mother’, bakwa ‘child’ and bakujuna ‘daughter’, respectively, and a formative -puji which could be glossed by ‘not proper’. The origin of this formative is unclear. There is a suffix -puji involved in agentive nominalization (§12.7.1) but the meaning differences between the two morphemes -puji are such that one doubts that they can be related; 4 — at least four terms have been borrowed, tata ‘father’, from Aymara/Quechua taita, kupari ‘compadre’ and kumari ‘comadre’, from Spanish ‘compadre’ and ‘comadre’, respectively, and kuku ‘uncle MB’; the exact origin of this latter term is unknown but it is found in a large number of languages all over Amazonia, as noted by Dixon and Aikhenvald (1999: 8).

418 12. Noun phrase structure — an overview

12.4.2. Possessor inflections

Kinship nouns take person inflections to indicate whom they relate to (i.e., their possessor). The coding system of possessor inflections is shown in Table 12.2:

Table 12.2. System of person coding for kinship nouns

possessor person
1st 2nd / vocative 3rd

prefix eØ e-

enclitic Ø Ø =ke

examples e-wane wane e-wane=ke

‘my wife / our wives’ ‘your wife / your wives’ ‘his wife / their wives’

As shown by the examples, only person is encoded by the system. Number is usually disambiguated by using an additional (optional) genitive phrase, or genitive pronoun (in slot C of the NP structure; see §12.4.3). Kinship terms in vocative function have the same form as those with a second person possessor.
Kinship nouns with a second person possessor do not take any overt morphological marking. Examples are given in (12.24):

(12.24) a. Jutakiju waneS pa-ani=jari! therefore wife JUSS-sit=STILL
‘So let your wife stay (lit. sit) for a while!’ cv045

b. [Arusu=kwana a-wa=ke]O

pa-ara =shana

rice=PL

affect-PERF=LIG =3SG(-ERG) JUSS-eat =PITY

[ju-na-wa=keRC

kwaine=ra]A!

be-COME.TEMP-PERF=LIG aunt.MZ=ERG

‘(When I arrived at the house of Mariano Cartagena saying that I was hungry, Mariano asked his wife (who is my niece) to prepare rice. He said to her:) “At least let your aunt (lit. your mother’s sister), who has just arrived, eat some cooked rice (lit. rice that has been affected)!”’ ka191

A kinship noun in vocative function has the same (unmarked) form as when it is possessed by a second person. Some kinship nouns in vocative function are illustrated in (12.25):

(12.25) a. A=ishu

=tu-keO =miA

do.what=PURP.GNL =3SG-FM =2SG(-ERG)

b. Ne-kwa =taa

kuku!

HORT-go =EMPH uncle.MB

‘Let’s go, uncle!’ hm034

The unmarked form is also used when kinship terms enter a derivational process. This is (at least) attested with the -ki ‘WITH’ and -ma ‘WITHOUT’ adjectivizers (see §11.3.1) when they are applied to the two kinship nouns awe ‘husband’ and wane ‘wife’, as shown in (12.26); note that kinship nouns are not compounded with da-adjectives and are not incorporated into verbs.

Kinship nouns with a third person possessor are marked with the circumfix e-…=ke ‘3’, as illustrated in (12.28):

12.4.3. Kinship nouns and genitive modifier

Very often, an NP with a kinship noun (as head) also includes a genitive phrase or genitive pronoun (in slot C of the NP structure); note that this is not obligatorily, as shown by the preceding examples. This allows the speaker to be more specific about the exact identity of the possessor. For example, the use of genitive pronouns allows the speaker to specify the number of the possessor, as with the dual and plural genitive pronouns in (12.29):

(12.29) a. Yume

Eliuduru=raA, [metse-ja bakwa=ra]A iye-wa

over.there Eliuduru=ERG 2DL-GEN child=ERG kill-PERF

dukweriibaO. puma

‘“Over there, Eliuduru, your (dl) son, has killed a puma,” (the man said to me and my wife).’ el021

scold =3PL(-ERG) affect-PERF 3PL-GEN 3-younger.brother=3

‘They scolded their younger brother (because he didn’t stay quiet as they were preparing an ambush to kill their enemies)’ mk046

The use of a genitive pronoun can also have a contrastive function, as probably happens in (12.30), since a husband can only be possessed by a single person.

(12.30)

[E-kwe e-awe]S =tuS

Biata=ju

babi=ra.

Biata.river=LOC hunt=PURP.MOT

‘My husband went to the Biata river in order to hunt.’ di0804

Finally, the use of full genitive NPs allow the speaker to make full reference to the possessor are shown in (12.31):

(12.31) a. Eju

=tuS

[Vitu=ja e-kwa=ke]S kwa-kware?

INT:LOC =3SG(-FM) Vitu=GEN 3-mother=3 go-REM.PAST

‘Where did Vitu’s mother go?’ ib064

japa-da diru-chine. far-ASF go-REC.PAST

‘My great-grandmother (lit. my father’s grandmother) has gone very far.’ di1250

Note that a genitive NP headed by another kinship noun allows reference to kinship relations for which a specific term does not exist in the language (such as great-grandmother in (12.31b)).

12.4.4. Kinship nouns and plural markers
There is a very curious interaction between kinship terms and number marking. There is a plural marker, =ekana ‘PL’, which is only used with kinship terms with a first or second (but not third) person possessor as shown in (12.32).

422 12. Noun phrase structure — an overview

ju-kware. be-REM.PAST

‘I had many children (lit. my children were many).’ n5.0246

Kinship terms possessed by a third person require the general plural marker =kwana ‘PL’ — note that kinship terms with a first or second person possessor can also take =kwana ‘PL’. When this happens, the =ke part of the circumfix e-…=ke ‘3’ follows the plural marker as seen in (12.33):

(12.33)

E-wane=kwana=keS (*e-wane=ke=kwana) kwa-ya

epu=eke. village=PERL

‘Their wives would go from the village (to the forest to meet their husbands, who were hunting there).’ ct037

See further discussion in §13.3.1.

12.4.5. Irregular kinship nouns

A number of kinship terms have irregular forms or irregular morphology. These are given in Table 12.3, sorted by alphabetical order. Note that the irregularities are in boldface.

Table 12.3. Irregular kinship nouns

12.5. Independent nouns 423
As we can see, in three words y- occurs instead of e-. This reminds us of the change e  y found with the e-noun prefix e- ‘NPF’ when it is attached to a root that begins with a (see §12.3.1). However, these are clearly not identical processes since with kinship nouns, the e  y change only occurs with certain words and only when possessed by a third person; for example there is no such change in e-anu ‘my/our grandmother’ (*y-anu), e-awe ‘my/our husband’ (*y-awe), etc. On the contrary, with e-nouns, the e  y change is fully productive.

12.5. Independent nouns
Independent nouns represent the biggest subclass of nouns, amounting to at least a few thousand forms. Semantically, these nouns refer to entities of the world that are conceived within the Cavineña culture as having an existence of their own. Unlike the classes of e-nouns and kinship nouns, the class of independent nouns is open to both derivation (from another word class) and borrowings. The class counts hundreds of recent Spanish and (less recent) Aymara/Quechua loans; it probably also includes a of number terms borrowed from other languages, although these have not been identified.
Independent nouns, unlike e-nouns, never take a prefix e- (or y-),7 and unlike kinship nouns, never take possessor inflections.
Independent nouns can become adjectives by taking -ki ‘WITH’ or -ma ‘WITHOUT’. However, they cannot be compounded with da-adjectives. A few independent nouns are attested incorporated within transitive verbs.

12.5.1. Semantics

A sample of independent nouns is given in (12.34), sorted by semantic field.

(12.34) a. Fauna (specific)

awada dii iba

‘tapir’ ‘mosquito’ ‘jaguar’

kurakwa make matuja

‘parrot’ ‘piranha’ ‘caiman’

7 Note that a number of nouns are classified as independent nouns even though they begin with the vowel e (or y) and could semantically be construed as parts of entities (e.g., eja ‘nest’, epu ‘village’, yachi ‘pampa’, etc.). This is because e (or y) is not analyzable in these word; see discussion in §12.3.1.3.

12.5.2. Semantic overlaps with e-nouns and kinship nouns

There is a semantic overlap between independent nouns and e-nouns on the one hand, and independent nouns and kinship nouns on the other hand.
There are independent nouns which refer to parts of entities (as e-nouns do). A list of such terms is given in (12.35). Note that the list is not exhaustive; notably, it does not include unfamiliar terms which are only found once in corpus.

426 12. Noun phrase structure — an overview

It is likely that at least some of these terms, which must be classified as independent nouns in present day Cavineña, belonged to the class of e-nouns at previous stages.
There are pairs of e-nouns and independent nouns which are semantically very similar (but etymologically unrelated), as shown in (12.36); e-nouns are in (a.), independent nouns are in (b.)

(12.36) a. -s(e)pere -kata -tsa

‘stream’ ‘feather’ ‘flower’

vs. b. kweri ‘river’

vs.

ududu ‘feather’

vs.

shasha ‘flower’

It is not clear why ‘stream’ is treated as an e-noun while ‘river’ is treated as an independent noun. In the case of ‘feather’, I was told that -kata refers to body feathers while ududu refers to wing and tail feathers. In one example, Alfredo Tavo used ududu to refer to ornament feathers which could explain why this term is independent while the other is bound. As for ‘flower’, Alfredo Tavo explained to me that shasha refers to beautiful flowers — possibly also used as ornaments — while -tsa can refer to any flowers (beautiful or not).
Some independent nouns, such as those in (12.37), refer to interpersonal relations, which results in a semantic overlap between the subclasses of kinship nouns and independent nouns.

(12.37)

ata ebakwa ebakwapiji jabakwa waraji

‘relative’ ‘child, offspring’ ‘small child’ ‘baby animal, cub’ ‘chief, authority’

Let us note that -puna ‘female’ is an e-noun while deka ‘male’ is an independent noun.

12.5.3. Interrogative noun ai ‘INT’

A noteworthy independent noun is ai ‘INT’. This noun can have a lexical meaning referring to ‘thing’, as in (12.38).

12.5.4. Deictic nouns

A few examples are available of three deictic morphemes, listed in (12.41).

(12.41)

rekwana tukwana yukwana

‘this stuff here’ ‘that stuff there’ ‘that stuff over there’

428 12. Noun phrase structure — an overview

These forms are transparently analyzable as being formed of the deictic roots re- ‘near speaker’, tu- ‘near addressee’, and yu- ‘not near speaker or addressee’, which we also find in pronouns and demonstratives (see Chapter 15), and a suffix -kwana, which is also found as a plural suffix in some pronouns (see Chapter 15) and as a plural enclitic (see §13.3).
These morphemes are used to refer to non-human, non-individuated and heterogeneous entities with an associative meaning. The word class to which they might belong is not entirely clear. For the time being, I have classified them as (independent) nouns, rather than demonstratives or independent pronouns, on the following basis:

— deictic morphemes can function as the sole element in an NP in core functions; this is unlike demonstratives, which can only be used in oblique function. Examples showing deictic morphemes in O and A functions are given in (12.42).

(12.42) a. Tukwana=dyaO =ekwanaA ara-kware. that.stuff.there=FOC =1PL(-ERG) eat-REM.PAST
‘We ate those things (the bananas, the coati, etc).’ mj172

karu-bawe. bite-ALWS

‘Those things (ants and other types of insects) bite us when we go hunting.’ di2632

— deictic morphemes can function as the argument of a postposition; this is unlike independent pronouns, which have special oblique forms (§15.1). Illustrative examples are given in (12.43), with the locative postposition =ju ‘LOC’ in (a.), the general locative postposition =keja in (b.), and the perlative postposition =eke in (c.)

‘I used to come very often with my late mother, with (my mother) who died, around (lit. through) these places (in order to fish).’ ka313

— deictic morphemes can (apparently) function as juxtaposed modifiers (slot D) in an NP, while independent pronouns cannot. This is shown with yukwana modifying the e-noun -majaka ‘space’ in (12.44), an example volunteered by Emerenciano Sepa.

(12.44)

adeba-ya=ama.

that.stuff.over.there NPF-space (=1SG-ERG) know-IMPFV=NEG

‘I don’t know these places over there.’ n5.0455

Note however that I only have one example of a deictic morpheme used this way. Note also that in this example, the e- prefix of -majaka is not deleted, unlike what normally happens when an e-noun is modified by another noun.

430 12. Noun phrase structure — an overview

12.6. Grammar of inalienability

Many languages make a morpho-syntactic distinction between alienably possessed nouns and inalienably possessed nouns (see among others Chappell and McGregor 1989, 1996 and Nichols 1988). In Cavineña, this distinction is clearly encoded with kinship nouns which take obligatory possessor inflections while other types of nouns (either independent or e-nouns) do not.
In the case of e-nouns, it is not altogether clear if the morpho-syntactic peculiarities of these nouns should be viewed as also reflecting inalienability. Camp and Liccardi (1989: 327) claim that e-nouns are also inalienably possessed. According to these authors, e-nouns require an obligatory possessor, which can be either expressed by a juxtaposed noun (coding a specific possessor), as in (12.11a) (repeated), or expressed by the prefix e- (coding an generic/impersonal possessor), as (12.7a) (repeated).

There are a number of problems with analyzing the above facts as representing inalienable ‘possession’:

1 — the juxtaposed noun never refers to a specific entity. To say ‘the flesh of a particular cow’, one must use a genitive phrase in slot C, as in (12.45a). To say ‘its flesh’ (or ‘my flesh’, ‘your flesh’, etc.), one must use a special genitive pronoun (also in slot C), as in (12.45b). As shown by ungrammatical (12.45c), there is no such construction where a (case-)unmarked pronoun can go into slot D (i.e., the slot for juxtaposed nouns).

(12.45) a. waka=jaC e-rami cow=GEN NPF-flesh
‘the flesh of the cow’ (e.g., of an injured cow whose flesh is visible)

12.7. Nominalization 431

b. tu-jaC e-rami 3SG-GEN NPF-flesh
‘its flesh’

c. *tu-ke rami / *tu-rami 3SG-FM flesh 3SG-flesh

The same genitive constructions would also have to be used to refer to either one’s own or one’s acquired flesh. 2 — juxtaposed nouns (slot D) do not exclusively modify e-nouns (as NP head in slot E) but also independent nouns (see full exemplification in §13.1.1).

These two facts suggest that the morpho-syntactic peculiarities of e-nouns do not really have to do with what is traditionally called inalienable possession. Historically, it is quite possible that e-nouns have encoded an inalienable possession distinction. Recall that e-nouns are found in all living Tacanan languages where (to my knowledge) they do not behave morpho-syntactically any differently from Cavineña. This suggests that this is a very old feature. If this is indeed the case, the e- prefix could be a remnant of a paradigm of possessor inflections. One could alternatively speculate whether this prefix could have originated from the contraction of the indefinite/interrogative (independent) noun ai ‘INT’ (ai  e) within slot D (see §12.5.3 on this noun).

12.7. Nominalization

Independent nouns, unlike e-nouns and kinship nouns, can be derived from other word classes or from other nouns. The different mechanisms that are used for this task are:

1 — five productive derivational affixes. They are listed in Table 12.4, with an indication of the base they can be attached to, the resulting semantics, and the section where the affix is discussed.

section §12.7.1 §12.7.2 §12.7.3 §12.7.4 §12.7.5

2 — direct conversion; that is, there is no overt indication of the derivation. This is also a productive process which take verbs as input; see §12.7.6;

432 12. Noun phrase structure — an overview
3 — reduplication. Unlike the preceding mechanisms, reduplication is not productive. In most cases, the base is not identifiable; see §12.7.7; 4 — several (non-productive) formatives; see §12.7.8; 5 — compounding. Most compounds appear to be lexicalized syntactic constructions, notably those involving the modification of a noun by another noun, as described in §13.1.3 (e.g., ebakwa tare ‘uterus’ from ebakwa ‘child’ and -tare ‘house’) and those involving the modification of a noun by an attributive adjective, as discussed in §13.2.2 (e.g., eka paja ‘egg white’ from -ka ‘egg’ and paja ‘white’). Noun compounding is not further discussed in this chapter.

12.7.1. Agentive -puji ‘ONE.THAT’

The suffix -puji is normally used to derive independent nouns from verbs, whether inflecting or non-inflecting, and whether intransitive or transitive; in a few example -puji is also used to derive nouns from nouns or adjectives (see below). The derived noun refers to a ‘good (S or A) performer’ of the verb event., As such, this derivation can be called agentive nominalization according to Comrie and Thompson (1985).
Examples of -puji deriving nouns from inflective verbs are given in (12.46) (intransitive verbs in a. and transitive verbs in b.).

(12.46) a. Nouns derived from inflecting intransitive verbs

nawi-  ‘bathe’

nawi-puji ‘so. who bathes very early morning’

chiri-puji ‘so./sth. good at stealing, thief’

iye-



‘kill O’

iye-puji ‘so./sth. good at killing, good hunter’

In some cases, the reflexive circumfix k(a)-…-ti (§8.2) is included in the derivation process, as in (12.47).

12.7. Nominalization 433

(12.47) a. k-iye-ti-puji REF-kill-REF-ONE.THAT
‘so./sth. good at killing, criminal’

‘so. good at giving (nick)names’

c. ka-chachane-ti-puji REF-cure-REF-ONE.THAT
‘so. who cures (doctor, medicine man)’

The original O of a transitive verb can be included in slot D (as a juxtaposed noun) of the NP structure, such as juje ‘duck’ in (12.48).

[juje chiri-puji]CS. duck steal-ONE.THAT

‘Therefore, the duck-stealer is (someone) from here.’ ju018

Non-inflecting verbs (see §5.3) can also be nominalized by -puji. The auxiliary is always omitted. Examples are given in (12.49).

(12.49) a. Nouns derived from non-inflecting intransitive verbs

 ijawe-puji ‘good (soccer) player’

kwatsabiji ju-

 kwatsabiji-puji

‘tell story to O’

‘good storyteller’

I have two examples where the agentive nominalizer -puji is applied to a non-inflecting verb which has been previously derived by the auxiliarytriggering process of full reduplication (§10.6). The first of these examples is bawitya-bawitya-puji ‘teacher’, which is based on the non-inflecting transitive verb bawitya-bawitya a- ‘teach O repeatedly’, itself based on the nonreduplicated inflecting verb bawitya- ‘teach O’. The other example is samasama-puji ‘doctor’, from the non-inflecting transitive verb sama-sama a- ‘cure O repeatedly’, initially derived from the inflecting transitive verb sama- ‘cure O’.
In a few cases, a suffix -puji is found deriving independent nouns from other independent nouns, as in (12.50a), where the derived noun refers to a good maker/builder of N, and (12.50b), where the derived noun refers to a ‘good killer/hunter’ of N.

(12.50) a. karetu ‘cart’

karetu-puji

‘so. good at making carts’

dure ‘belt’



‘so. good at making belts’

b. waburasa



‘peccary’

waburasa-puji ‘(dog) good at hunting peccaries’

Recall that four kinship terms also involve a suffix -puji, tatapuji ‘stepfather’, from tata ‘father’, kwaapuji ‘stepmother’, from kwaa ‘mother’, bakwapuji ‘adopted son’, from bakwa, and bakujunapuji ‘adopted daughter’, from bakujuna ‘daughter’; see §12.4.1.
In one case, the agentive nominalizer -puji applies to the independent adjective nijuki ‘drunk’ and derives the noun nijuki-puji ‘drunkard’.
More work is required to determine whether the suffix -puji that applies to verbs is the same as the one that applies to nouns and adjectives, and also

12.7. Nominalization 435
whether -puji can be applied to other nouns or adjectives than the few found in the data.

12.7.2. Instrumental e-…-ki ‘NMLZ’

The circumfix e-…-ki, similarly to -puji, normally applies to verbs; there is only one attested exception, where it is found with a noun (see below). The verb can be either intransitive or transitive but must be inflecting. The derived noun most often denotes an instrument, i.e., an entity that is used by the S or A argument in order to perform the verb event. This entity could be expressed by an instrumental oblique phrase. As such, this derivation can be called instrumental nominalization according to Comrie and Thompson (1985).
A few examples are given in (12.51) below (the a-examples are based on intransitive verbs, the b-examples are based on transitive verbs).

(12.51) a. Nouns derived from inflecting intransitive verbs

9 A house inside the village is -tare ‘house’. 10 Note that in this form the Aktionsart suffix -ti ‘GO.TEMP’ (§7.2) has been included
together with the verb root. The resulting derived noun is literally ‘place to go to
bathe’.

See also eaniki ‘house (outside of the village)’ in (T1.85).

11 Note the (idiosyncratic) elision of e from the root pei- during the derivation process. 12 The verb temi- is used when chewing coca leaves. It refers the process of adding a
sweetener (coca leaves have a quite bitter taste), typically ashes from a particular
plant, into one’s mouth. The noun derived from this verb refers to foodstuffs that
‘sweeten’ the strong taste of meat (e.g., rice, manioc, etc.).

12.7. Nominalization 437

In some cases, the derived noun is not, strictly speaking, an instrument. For example, the nouns derived from the verbs ara- ‘eat O’ and iji- ‘drink O’, namely e-ara-ki ‘food’ and e-iji-ki ‘drink’, respectively, refer to the entity affected by the verb event (i.e., the O argument; lit. ‘what is eaten’, ‘what is drunk’), rather than an instrumental oblique.
With the ditransitive verb kweja- ‘inform O of O’, the derived noun e-kweja-ki ‘news’ refers to the theme (the message), which is encoded as one of two Os of the verb.
With taji- ‘accompany O’ and tsawa- ‘help O’, the derived nouns e-taji-ki ‘friend’ and e-tsawa-ki ‘helper, assistant’ rather encode the agent (A argument), i.e., literally, ‘the one that accompanies O’ and ‘the one that helps O’.
As for the derived noun e-iyumata-ki ‘settlement’, the meaning of the derivational process from iyumata- ‘(snake) roll itself up’ is unclear.
In one case, the base is (at least synchronically) a noun: e-tsuje-ki ‘money’, from the e-noun -tsuje ‘price, value’.
The nouns in (12.53) appear to be derived from e-…-ki but the base is unknown.

(12.53)

ebubuki ebanataki eduki ekiniki etijaki

‘broom made of palm leaves’ ‘planting stick’ ‘traditional cotton string’ ‘container’ ‘ember’

The suffix -ki which is part of the circumfix e-…-ki is possibly historically related to the adjectivizer -ki ‘WITH’ (§11.3.1).

12.7.3. Locative e-…-kware ‘NMLZ’

The circumfix e-…-kware derives independent nouns from intransitive inflecting verbs. The derived noun refers to a place where the verb event can be performed occasionally (not typically). As such this derivation can be called locative nominalization according to Comrie and Thompson (1985). This is illustrated in (12.54).

Note that the e-…-ki derivation discussed in the previous section can also refer to places. Thus we have the following pairs.

(12.56)

e-ani-ki ‘house outside of village’

e-ani-kware ‘place to stay temporarily’

e-nawi-ti-ki ‘(personal) place to bathe’

e-nawi-kware ‘(public) place to bathe’

e-tawi-ki ‘bedding’

e-tawi-kware ‘camp’

The main difference is that e-…-ki has a more utilitarian/functional sense and e-…-kware has a more spatial sense. E-ani-ki, for example, is typically a house built outside of a community for some particular purpose such as raising cattle, storing brazil nuts, etc.). By contrast e-ani-kware is a place (typically a little hut) with no particular function other than to rest (or protect oneself from the sun or have a meal) when travelling or working away from home.

12.7. Nominalization 439
Note that e-…-kware is only found on intransitive verbs. The only transitive verb found involved in this derivation is ara- ‘eat O’. However it is first detransitivized by antipassive reduplication (§8.3.1), giving ara-ara- ‘eat’, then derived with e-…-kware as e-ara-ara-kware ‘temporary place to eat (away from home)’.

12.7.4. Locative -kini ‘PLACE’

The suffix -kini ‘PLACE’ is normally attached to independent nouns and derives other independent nouns which refer to locations where there are many Xs, X being the referent of the noun involved in the derivation.
Typically -kini is attached to nouns that refer to trees/palms or vegetation, as illustrated in (12.57a). In (12.57b), -kini is found with the e-noun -kwija ‘thorn’13 while in (12.57c), it occurs on the independent noun makana ‘gravel’.

440 12. Noun phrase structure — an overview

12.7.5. “Affection” -chi ‘AFFTN’

The suffix -chi ‘AFFecTioN’ is used to derive independent nouns from kinship nouns (only). The derived term means that the person is dearly beloved by the possessor. In the data, -chi is found with 6 terms only. More work is required to determine whether -chi can be attached to other kinship terms.

(12.59)

‘grandfather’ ‘grandmother’ ‘father’ ‘mother’ ‘aunt.FZ’ ‘uncle.MB’

baba-chi anu-chi tata-chi mama-chi nene-chi kuku-chi

‘grandpa’ ‘grandma’ ‘daddy’ ‘mommy’ ‘aunty.FZ’ ‘(beloved) uncle.MB’

The marker -chi is only found with kinship nouns possessed by a first person or (less often) by a second person; it never occurs on kinship nouns possessed by a third person.
Nouns derived by -chi cannot take possessor inflections — this comes from the fact that they have become independent. Note however that this is only observable when they are possessed by a first person, since kinhip nouns possessed by a second person do not take possessor inflection (§12.4.2), and since, as we just said, -chi is not found on kinship nouns possessed by a third person. In (12.60), for example, where we have -chi attached to kinship terms possessed by a first person, we can see that the first person possessor prefix e- ‘1’ does not show up.

12.7.6. Action/state direct conversion

A large number of verb stems in Cavineña allow for a nominal use without any overt derivation. This is attested in the data for about 30 intransitive verbs and 13 transitive verbs. As such they are simply used without the inflectional morphology that is otherwise required when they are used as verbs. Note however that they can take non-inflectional morphemes or be reduplicated.
Usually, the forms used nominally refer to the activity denoted by the verb stem. As such we have a type of ‘action/state nominalization’ (as per Comrie and Thompson 1985). This is illustrated in (12.62a), based on inflecting verbs, and (12.62b), based on non-inflecting verbs.

In some cases, rather than referring to the verb action strictly speaking, the noun refers to an/the entity that is ‘created’ by the event encoded by the verb. This would correspond to what Comrie and Thompson (1985) call ‘object nominalization’. Illustrative examples are provided in (12.68a), with intransitive verbs, and (12.68b), with transitive verbs.

An analysis in terms of zero nominalization, or the possibility for verbs to occur as NP heads, is more plausible in the present case than with the correspondences noted between adjectives and nouns (see §11.2.7). First, it is much more productive. Although this still requires testing, any verb might potentially be used as a noun. The semantics of the nominal use of the verb are also much more predictable. In most of the cases, it either refers to the activity denoted by the verb itself or an entity that results from it. Nevertheless, I will remain cautious for the present time and not make any generalizations until more is known about the present phenomenon.

12.7. Nominalization 445

12.7.7. Onomatopoeic reduplication

A fair number of nouns have a reduplicated shape. In many cases, these nouns are inherently reduplicated. That is, we cannot find any independent base from which a derivational process could have occurred. There are two types of reduplication patterns: final syllable reduplication and full reduplication. I discuss each in turn.
About 20 nouns have the final syllable reduplicated. The exhaustive list is given in (12.72), sorted by semantic field.

446 12. Noun phrase structure — an overview

wekaka weruru

‘day’ ‘sweat’

The noun kwejiji ‘wind’ is probably derived from the noun kweji ‘bad smell’ or the verb kweji- ‘fart’. The nouns weruru ‘sweat’ and wekaka ‘day’ are cases of direct conversion from the intransitive verbs weruru- ‘sweat’ and wekaka- ‘be at dawn’. The noun ejapupu ‘henhouse’ clearly involves the independent noun eja ‘nest’; but note that the origin of pupu is unknown. The origin of the remaining nouns is unknown and can only be analyzed (at least synchronically) as inherently reduplicated.
Full reduplication is found with about 30 nouns. They are listed in (12.73).

(12.73) a. Fauna

biribiri busabusa dukwadukwa jaajaa kaekae kawakawa kuyukuyu pupu purupuru sheishei shiwishiwi shupushupu tasatasa tsatsa wanuwanu witukuwituku

12.7. Nominalization 447

ribariba tiritiri uyuuyu warawara wenewene yusuyusu

‘toasted corn flour’ ‘type of traditional dance’ ‘mud’ ‘forest coca’ ‘letter’ ‘idol’

Some of these nouns clearly come from reduplicated verbs, as with kujakuja ‘balloon’, from transitive kuja- ‘blow air into O’, jerujeru ‘song’ from intransitive jeru- ‘sing’,15 wenewene ‘letter’ from transitive wene- ‘draw/write O’. The noun tsatsa ‘cacaré bird’ possibly comes from intransitive tsa- ‘laugh’. Others clearly come from other nouns such as kweyakweya ‘picture, photo’ from kweya ‘form, spirit’, nusanusa ‘alphabet’ from nusa ‘small mark within a repetitive pattern’, and yusuyusu ‘idol’ from Yusu ‘God’. Finally, at least one of these nouns, uyuuyu ‘mud’, comes from a (predicative) adjective, uyu- ‘muddy’. The origin of the remaining nouns is unknown.
It is quite likely that many (partly or fully) reduplicated nouns are ad hoc onomatopoeic creations where reduplication somehow reflects a sonorous or rhythmic motion associated with the denoted referent.16 Note that many fully reduplicated nouns refer to birds, as with kaekae ‘macaw’, jaajaa ‘guan sp.’, pupu ‘owl’, and bijiji ‘gray-fronted dove’, or noisy entities, as with kumukumu ‘drum’, kwejiji ‘wind’, sururu ‘waterfall’17 and tabubu ‘hurricane’. Many reduplicated nouns denote referents associated with a rhythmic component, as with jabirijabiri ‘kite’, tiritiri ‘traditional dance’, japipi ‘butterfly, tiriri ‘spider’, and watsutsu ‘whirlpool’. There also appears to be some correlation between the types of phonemes that are used and the size of the entity or pitch of the sound that are presumably denoted. Front vowels i and e tend to correlate with small entities such as birds or butterfly, as in biribiri ‘parakeet sp.’, bijiji ‘grayfronted dove’ and japiji ‘butterfly’, while non-front vowels a and u tend to correlate with bigger entities, as in kaekae ‘macaw’ and sududu ‘capybara (big rodent)’.

12.7.8. Formatives
Every person in a Cavineña community has an official name and an official surname; the surname is composed of the father’s surname followed by the
15 Note that jeru is also a noun, but it then means ‘prayer’, not ‘song’ (see §12.7.6). 16 In §5.2.4, I show that verbs can also be created by (partial or full) reduplication in-
volving onomatopoeia. 17 Note that the sequence ruru is also part of the intransitive verbs rururu- ‘flow’ and
sukururu- ‘drip’ (see §5.2.4).

448 12. Noun phrase structure — an overview

mother’s surname, according to Bolivian practices. However, these names are hardly ever used in daily life (but essentially for administrative purposes or with foreigners). What are used instead are nicknames.18 Cavineñas use many sorts
of nicknames. One type of male nicknames consist of modified versions of the
official name by way of an ending chu or ku and some phonological changes; note that those phonological changes are not altogether understood yet.19 The
full list of such names collected is given in (12.74a), with the chu ending, and
(12.74b), with the ku ending.

(12.74)

a. Apechu Felichu Jaimechu Juanchu Kalachu Lechu Maechu

 Alfredo  Feliz  Jaime  Juan  Carmelo  Gregorio  Ismael

Melchu  Melchior Panchu  Francisco Emechu  Emerenciano Nuchu  Norberto Abranchu  Abraham Danchu  Eldan

Peyuku Dumiku Nestuku Reneku Awiku Machaku

 Pedro  Domingo  Nestor  René  Aureliano  Marcelino

It is not clear at the present stage whether the process is productive or not, whether chu or ku have particular meanings, and how they are exactly used. Also, it is not known if women’s names can use these endings or not. Two examples, Lidika (from Lidia) and Uruka (from Olga) suggest that ka might be such an ending for women’s nicknames. More examples are required to confirm this hypothesis (note that in the case of Uruka, the ka ending might be the adaptation of the ga segment of Olga to the Cavineña phonological system).
A formative pe is found as an ending in a handfull of independent nouns. The meaning of pe appears to be ‘different from X’, X being the entity denoted by the non-derived noun.20

18 See §1.3 on the activity of giving nicknames in Cavineña society. 19 Note that the habit of modifying Spanish Christian names by way of a suffix -chu or
-ku is not restricted to Cavineña, as it is found in the whole Quechua-speaking areas
of Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador (W. Adelaar, p.c.). This suggests that the suffixes -chu
or -ku, or the names that contain them, are originally borrowings from Quechua. 20 Note that pe is possibly historically related to the quantifier peya ‘another’ (see
§13.5).

bakanipe ‘different name’

anape ‘different language’

 -ana ‘tongue, language’

From these few examples, the pe suffix can apparently be attached to both independent nouns and e-nouns. As we can see above, when it is attached to e-nouns, such as -banaki ‘name’, the e- prefix of the e-noun is deleted, as expected. An example containing atape ‘non-Cavineña person’ is provided in (12.76).

Chapter 13 Noun phrase structure — modifiers

The structure of the NP consists of 8 slots (from A to H), each associated with a particular word class, as follows (repeated from §12.1):

Slot A: Slot B: Slot C: Slot D: Slot E: Slot F: Slot G: Slot H:

Relative clause1 Quantifier Genitive modifier Juxtaposed noun Head noun Attributive adjective Number Relative clause

A general discussion of the class of nouns was given in §§12.2-7. In the present chapter, I discuss NP modifiers: juxtaposed noun (§13.1), attributive adjective (§13.2), number marker (§13.3), genitive modifier (§13.4), quantifier (§13.5) and relative clause (§13.6).

13.1. Noun juxtaposition
A bare noun can modify the head of an NP (also a noun) by being directly preposed to it (in slot D). Noun juxtaposition can involve either independent nouns or e-nouns (but not kinship nouns) as either modifiers (slot D) or NP head (slot E). The morpho-syntactic characteristics of noun juxtaposition are discussed in §13.1.1.
Noun juxtaposition encodes a range of semantic relations having to do with the general idea of specification; that is, “the dependent nominal indicates the type of entity that is being referred to by the head nominal” (Chappell and McGregor 1989:28).2 The various semantic relations expressed by noun juxta-
1 Recall that Cavineña does not have a word class of nominal demonstratives. It will be seen that their equivalent is realized by a special type of (demonstrative) relative clauses.
2 It will be seen that the Cavineña juxtaposition construction has typical properties of classification constructions as defined by Chappell and McGregor. For example, only a noun (not a pronoun) can modify a head noun and only the head noun can be referential. Also, no material can occur in between the two nouns.

454 13. Noun phrase structure — modifiers
position are presented in §13.1.2. In a number of cases, noun juxtaposition has unpredictable semantic results,
as illustrated in §13.1.3. Noun juxtaposition resembles noun compounding. The proposed analysis in
terms of juxtaposition rather than compounding is argued for in §13.1.4. Note that modification of a noun by another noun can also be realized by a
genitive phrase (slot C). This is not discussed in this section but in §13.4, and more specifically in §13.4.3, where it is shown that the two types of constructions are different syntactically and semantically.

13.1.1. Syntax

Noun juxtaposition displays the following morpho-syntactic properties:

1 — a juxtaposed noun occupies slot D of the predicate. I have not found more than one noun in slot D. In this sense, Cavineña is quite different from English where more than one noun can modify another noun as head of an NP (e.g., the awards selection committee). 2 — either an independent noun or an e-noun can fill slot D. Also, either an independent noun or an e-noun can be modified by a juxtaposed noun. Kinship nouns, on the other hand, are never found in slot D and are never modified by a juxtaposed noun. The examples below illustrate the four possible combinations.

4 — when the modified noun (in slot E) is an e-noun, it (normally) loses its prefix e-, as in (13.2), (13.4) and (13.5b,c); see a full discussion of this in §12.3.1.2; 5 — a noun in slot D cannot take modifiers (ex. plural marker, attributive adjective, relative clause, etc.). 6 — typically, only a noun can occur in slot D. I have nevertheless come across a few examples where an element other than a noun is apparently used in slot D. Until more is known about such examples, I will treat these as exceptions.
In (13.7), the independent particles iyakwa ‘now, today, nowadays’ and ikwene ‘first’ (§16.1) occur in a position that appears to be the slot C, i.e., immediately before the head of an NP. In (13.7a) iyakwa is even found between a genitive modifier (slot C) and the head.

Alfredo Tavo mentioned once that when hearing a child crying one could say (13.8), which looks like a relative clause filling the slot D of an NP since the eprefix of the NP head (the e-noun -tsuri ‘sound’) is deleted.

Note that even though ebakwa pa-ya=ke resembles a relative clause structurally (being marked by =ke ‘LIG’), it does not so functionally, as this clause does not appear to share any argument with the main clause. Unfortunately, this is the only example I have of this construction, in which case it is too early to draw any conclusion at this point. 7 — a noun in slot D obligatorily requires a head noun (slot E).

13.1.2. Semantics
The following semantic relations are expressed by a noun juxtaposition:
1 — classification relations: the modifier is a term denoting a specific member of a class expressed by the head noun, as in (13.9).

‘He went to fetch (and cut) mahogany trees (in order to sell them).’ hp002

The construction used to specify the gender of an animal involves the name of the animal immediately followed by the morphemes deka ‘male’ or puna ‘female’, as in (13.11); see also buka deka ‘male tayra’ in (9.8).

This construction can lend itself to at least two different interpretations, depending on how we analyze deka and puna in terms of word classes in this context. We can first analyze them as nouns, in which case we can recognize here a juxtaposition construction of the type discussed in this section: the first noun is the modifier and the second noun the NP head.4 But we could as well analyze deka and puna as attributive adjectives (of the type to be discussed in the next section), in which case only the name of the animal is a noun in this construction, and deka and puna are modifiers. Even though intuitively the second option might be more appealing, structurally the first one appears to be the best, since both terms deka and -puna exist independently as nouns in Cavineña, as in the following examples.

4 Note that we could also say that the first noun is the head and the second noun the modifier. However, this would require setting up a second type of noun juxtaposition construction.

2 — location relations: the modifier is a term denoting where the referent of the head noun is located, as with different types of diseases (ujeje) in (13.13).

(13.13)

etsurikani ujeje (throat + disease)

‘cough’

yarapesiki ujeje (shoulder blade + disease) ‘back pain’

3 — naming relations: the modifier is a proper name of the head noun referent as in (13.14).

(13.14)

Asunta chine Galilea epu Sawaru wekaka

(Ascension + fiesta) (Galilea + village) (Saturday + day)

460 13. Noun phrase structure — modifiers

5 — whole-part relations: the modifier is the whole and the NP head the part. This can be illustrated with -rami ‘flesh, meat’ in (13.18a), -ka ‘egg’ in (13.18b), -jaki ‘leaf’ in (13.18c), and -tiri ‘root’ in (13.18d).

(13.18)

6 — part-of-part relations: both the modifier and the head refer to parts of entities, as in (13.20).

(13.20) a. e-bi tsau e-piti tsau e-tsaka tsau

‘arm bone’ ‘neck bone’ ‘leg bone’

13.1. Noun juxtaposition 461

b. etamu rami ‘cheek flesh/meat’ e-tsaka rami ‘leg flesh/meat’

In the previous types of whole-part expressions, the specifier is used as a generic non-referential term. But this does not need to be the case. In (13.21), for example, the part nouns -witsana ‘headwaters’ and -kike ‘forest’ are specified by fully referential place names.

(13.21)

Diata kike ‘forest of the Biata river’ Najiji witsana ‘headwaters of the Madidi river’

Note that both names Diata and Najiji are pronounced differently in Spanish.

7 — composition relations: the modifier specifies the material or the entities the head noun is composed of. This is illustrated with different types of soups in (13.22a), different types of tamale (a sort of bread) in (13.22b), different types of bark straps in (13.22c), and different types of ‘(slash-and-burn) gardens’ in (13.22d). A full example is provided in (13.23).

‘The rice soup becomes murky as it cooks (lit. as it dries).’ di0135

8 — user/creator relations: the specifier is the ‘user/creator’ and the NP head the entity used/created. This is shown with the e-nouns -diji ‘path’ in (13.24a) and -mekware ‘tracks’ in (13.24b).

462 13. Noun phrase structure — modifiers

b. iba mekware kwanubi mekware waburu mekware

‘I reached (lit. emerged on) the cart path.’ pe038

9 — ‘goal’ relations: the specifier is the ‘goal’ (or raison d’être) of the entity encoded by the NP head. This is again found with the e-noun -diji ‘path’ in (13.26).

(13.26)

e-na diji ‘water path (path leading to water)’ mani diji ‘rubber center path (path leading to a rubber center)’

13.1. Noun juxtaposition 463

13.1.3. Lexicalization

The meaning of quite a number of constructions with a noun directly modifying another noun is not fully predictable. These are best treated as lexicalized collocations. A sample is given in (13.28).

(13.28) a. independent — independent

dii bina dukweri iba iyuka muru

(mosquito + bat) (deer + jaguar) (head + dust)

‘small bat sp.’ ‘puma’ ‘dandruff’

b. independent — e-noun

ami diji ebakwa tare

‘vein’ ‘uterus’

c. e-noun — independent

e-tiki muru e-tsuri kani

(NPF-fire + dust) (NPF-sound + hole)

‘ashes’ ‘throat’

d. e-noun — e-noun

e-kwatsa biti e-spere y-aa

(NPF-mouth + skin)

‘lips’

(NPF-stream + branch) ‘stream tributary’

13.1.4. Compounding?
In this study I have treated direct modification of a noun by another noun as a syntactic construction (juxtaposition). However, one might ask whether this is not rather a case of compounding. First, note that the two nouns have to occur next to each other and that nothing can occur in between. Second, if the second noun is an e-noun, it does not take the e- prefix formative. This suggests that the two nouns form one grammatical unit as opposed to two separate grammatical words.
The syntactic juxtaposition analysis is preferred here, for the following reasons:

464 13. Noun phrase structure — modifiers
1 — the two nouns form independent phonological words. They both receive an independent Hn(M)M pitch contour (§2.7) and a pause is possible in between;5 2 — the construction is nearly fully productive. Taking the whole-part relation, for example, it is possible to take a noun referring to a whole, e.g., waka ‘cow’, and form any logically possible combinations with nouns referring to its parts, e.g., waka biti ‘cow skin’, waka rami ‘cow flesh’, waka wasi ‘cow hoof (lit. cow foot)’, waka takwa ‘cow liver’, etc. Alternatively, it is possible to take a noun referring to a part, e.g., -biti ‘skin’, and form any logically possible combinations with nouns referring to its ‘wholes’, e.g., waka biti ‘cow skin’, waburasa biti ‘peccary skin’, matuja biti ‘caiman skin’, iba biti ‘jaguar skin, etc. 3 — the modifier noun can normally be questioned independently from the head noun, by using the interrogative independent noun ai ‘INT’ in slot D; see an illustration in (13.5a-c). Note that the reverse, i.e., the head noun questioned independently from a juxtaposed slot D modifier, is not attested; 4 — semantically, the result of noun juxtaposition is largely predictable. Some combinations of nouns are not fully predictable — see the examples in (13.28) — but they can be accounted for by a process of lexicalization.

13.2. Attributive adjectives

Attributive adjectives occur as NP modifiers within slot F (§13.2.1). Attributive adjectives consist of a closed class of 16 members which have very specific meanings. The full list is given in (13.29), sorted by semantic type (following Dixon 2004).

(13.29) a. DIMENSION

baru ebari kaka wiri

‘tall’ ‘big’ ‘small and round’ ‘tiny’

b. AGE / VALUE

nana ‘young, new, baby’ siri ‘old’

5 Constructions involving a monosyllabic e-noun as the second noun are obviously exceptions, as such nouns cliticize on the preceding modifier noun (see §12.3.1.2)

13.2. Attributive adjectives 465

c. COLOR

jawa paja pude sawa sewe

‘yellow’ ‘white, clear’ ‘red/brown’ ‘green/blue’ ‘black’

d. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES

baba jika midi uke turu

‘big and unique’ ‘lush, luxuriant’ ‘tight’ ‘hot’ ‘big male’

The semantics of adjective are discussed in §13.2.2. Attributive adjectives have a rather low functional load in Cavineña. They are only used very sparingly and are very often lexicalized (§13.2.3). Note that Cavineña also has an open class of predicative adjectives (with more than 170 basic members; see Chapter 11). The main function of predicative adjectives is as copula complement but they are very often used attributively within (copula) relative clauses (see §13.6 and Chapter. 20).

13.2.1. Syntax

Attributive adjectives have the following morpho-syntactic properties:

1 — they go in slot F of the NP structure. Examples showing attributive adjectives co-occurring with various NP modifiers are in (13.30).

(13.30) a. [E-marikakaE

REF-buy-REF-REM.PAST here=PL=LIG

‘(Nowadays) we buy big cooking pots, these ones (that you can see in the corner of the house).’ ci118

6 Recall that the subscript ‘E’ refers to the E (extended core argument) function the NP has within the clause while the superscript ‘E’ refers to the E slot of the NP structure.

‘(Along the new path, the ground is covered with water. But) along the old cart path, it is (dry and) hard. (So let’s go there.)’ ka283

2 — ebari ‘big’ is the only attributive adjective that was found in combination with another attributive adjective: baba ‘unique’, in (13.31a) and turu ‘big male’, as in (13.31b). Note that in these combinations, ebari always comes last.

saltlick=LOC see-GO.TEMP-REM.PAST

‘While I was going (to see my family,) I saw a big male coati in a saltlick.’ mj119

3 — attributive adjectives consist of bare roots which cannot take any affixes, be reduplicated, be negated, or take modifiers; for exemple attributive adjectives cannot be modified by the particle dyake ‘very’, although this particle can modify predicative adjectives (see §11.1.2); 4 — nothing can intervene between the adjective and the head noun; 5 — attributive adjectives, unlike predicative adjectives, cannot be used predicatively (as copula clause complement or secondary predicates) or adverbially; 6 — attributive adjectives obligatorily require a head noun (in slot E).

13.2.2. Semantics
Some attributive adjectives are used very productively and clearly have a modifying meaning: ebari ‘big and strong’, kaka ‘small and round’, baba ‘unique’, wiri ‘tiny’, nana ‘young’ and siri ‘old’. The remaining adjectives are rarely found and most often have lexicalized meanings. The first type of (productive) attributive adjectives are discussed first.

13.2. Attributive adjectives 467

13.2.2.1. kaka ‘small and round’
The adjective kaka refers to small and round/plump entities.7 It is exemplified in (13.32).

Other examples of nouns modified by kaka are given in (13.33a). The three nouns in (13.33b), according to Emerenciano Sepa, are not really compatible with kaka (presumably because they can only refer to thin elongated entities).

(13.33)

a. akwi kaka epu kaka jae kaka jiti kaka kawayu kaka kuchi kaka kuchiru kaka kwaba kaka

‘small tree’ ‘small village’ ‘small and plump fish’ ‘small roundish basket’ ‘small and plump horse’ ‘small and plump pig’ ‘small knife’ ‘small canoe’

b. (?) matuja kaka (?) bakwa kaka (?) nanata kaka

(small and plump caiman) (small and plump viper) (small and plump electric eel)

7 This adjective is most likely historically related to e-noun -kaka ‘small and round fruit’.

468 13. Noun phrase structure — modifiers

13.2.2.2. wiri ‘tiny’ The adjective wiri refers to very small, skinny, elongated, or frail entities:8

Other examples of nouns modified by nana are given in (13.37a). The adjective nana was not accepted by Emerenciano Sepa with the two nouns given in (13.37b) (possibly because ‘stream’ and ‘lake’ are not conceived, from a Cavineña point of view, as being born/created).

Note that siri can refer to both animate and inanimate entities.

13.2.2.5. baba ‘big and unique’

The adjective baba is used with entities which are big, old, respected, exceptional or unique of their type.9 It is often used with old male animals that wander alone (away from their group) as in (13.40). But baba can also be used to refer to things. Emerenciano Sepa volunteered (13.31a) (repeated), referring to my hammock which was much bigger than any hammock he had every seen before.

13.2. Attributive adjectives 471

In (13.41a), I show other nouns which were found or elicited with baba. In (13.41b) I show a few nouns that are incompatible with baba (according to Emerenciano Sepa; the reasons why such combinations were not accepted are unknown):

The noun eweebari ‘teenager’ is probably based on the (lexicalized) attributive adjective ebari; but note that ewe does not occur independently in present day Cavineña.

13.2.2.7. Remaining attributive adjectives

The remaining adjectives are most often lexicalized. Rare examples showing their use as modifiers are given in (13.44) and (13.31b) (repeated).

These remaining adjectives tend to form lexicalized expressions with the noun they accompany, in which case the noun-adjective combination refers to a unitary concept, typically an animal or a plant species, and the adjective does not, strictly speaking, ‘modify’ the head noun. Examples are given in (13.45).

(13.45)

a. make pude puki pude ijike pude Diata pude

‘red/brown piranha sp.’ ‘red/brown ant sp.’ ‘red/brown corn sp.’ ‘Biata river (a red/brown-colored river)’

b. ijike jawa tipesi jawa kwawe jawa

‘yellow corn sp.’ ‘yellow horsefly sp.’ ‘yellow manioc sp.’

c. jae paja e-ka paja

f. chine ebari epu ebari e-diji ebari

‘Holy Week (lit. big fiesta)’ ‘Riberalta town (lit. big village)’ ‘highway to Riberalta town (lit. big path)’

Morpho-syntactic evidence for lexicalization can be found in the fact that when a noun-adjective sequence is lexicalized, the adjective can apparently go together with the noun in slot D; recall that slot D must normally consist of bare

474 13. Noun phrase structure — modifiers

roots (see §13.1.1), as suggested with shita sewe in (13.46). Note however that this needs to be verified with more examples.

13.2.3. Compounding?
All attributive adjectives — except turu ‘old male’ — are related to words that belong to other word classes, as shown in Table 13.1.
The strength of the bond between attributive adjectives and their modified noun and the fact that most attributive adjectives have corresponding morphemes within other word classes could suggest alternative analyses in terms of suffixes or root compounding. In this study, I have preferred to treat attributive adjectives as phonologically and syntactically independent modifiers on the following basis:
1 — attributive adjectives are prosodically independent, since they receive an independent Hn(M)M pitch contour (see §2.7), and since a pause is possible between the adjective and the noun; 2 — syntactically and semantically, (at least) some attributive adjectives, such as kaka ‘round and small’, ebari ‘big’ and siri ‘old’, are very productive and their combination with nouns has transparent compositional meanings.

13.3. Number markers
Cavineña has three number markers. It has a dual marker, =ekatse ‘DL’, and two plural markers, =kwana ‘PL’, which can be used with any type of noun, and =ekana ‘PL’, which can only be used with kinship nouns possessed by first and second persons. Note that Cavineña also has numeral lexemes which belong to the quantifier word class (see §13.5).

13.3.1. Syntax
Number markers have the following morpho-syntactic properties:
1 — number markers consist of bare roots which cannot take any affixes or be reduplicated; 2 — number markers are enclitics; that is, they do not receive an independent Hn(M)M pitch contour (§2.7); 3 — number markers occur in slot G or the predicate. Examples of number markers co-occurring with other NP modifiers are given in (13.47).

There is a intriguing interaction between possessor inflections of kinship nouns (§12.4) and the =kwana plural marker. When this marker pluralizes a kinship noun possessed by a third person (thus marked by the cicumfix e-…=ke ‘3’), =kwana is obligatorily attached directly to the kinship root and the =ke part of the circumfix is attached to =kwana. This is shown in (13.48).

See also e-kwa=ke=ekatse ‘his parents’ in (13.61a). 4 — number markers, unlike juxtaposed nouns or attributive adjectives, do not require the NP head to be overtly expressed. They do however require a host (to which they are attached to to form a full phonological word). In other words, number markers cannot be the sole element in an NP. The host must be an NP constituent. In (13.50), I illustrate headless NPs with number markers attached to various types of NP constituent hosts: quantifier peya ‘other’ (slot B) in (13.50a) and relative clause in (13.50b).

There is another curious interaction between the =kwana plural marker and the ligature marker =ke (marking relative clauses; see §20.2.2). Quite similarly to its behavior with the =ke part of the e-…=ke ‘3’ possessor circumfix inflection, =kwana precedes the ligature marker =ke, while one would have rather expected it to follow, from the NP slot structure. This is illustrated in (13.51).

The markers =ekatse ‘DL’ and =kwana ‘PL’ are used with any type of noun, whether e-nouns, kinship or independent nouns. When it comes to kinship nouns, they can be used irrespective of what the person of the possessor is. The marker =ekana ‘PL’, on the other hand, has a very restricted distribution. First, it is only used with kinship terms. Second, it is only used with kinship terms possessed by a first or (to a lesser extent) second person. The examples in (13.52) show =ekana on kinship nouns possessed by a first person.

Similarly, *chapa=ekana (dog=PL) was not accepted by Alfredo Tavo. Alfredo also refused =kwana on non-kinship nouns even though they refer to human entities such as *ekwita=ekana (person=PL), *e-puna=ekana (NPF-female=PL) and *ata=ekana (relative=PL).
The following Table 13.2 summarizes how each number marker is used.

yes; e.g., (13.49a,b) yes; e.g., (13.54a), (13.55a) only when possessed by 1st or 2nd person; e.g., (13.52a-c), (13.54b)

Although number tends to be marked in many cases, it is not an obligatory category of the NP. A noun can be left unmarked and still refer to dual or plural referents. In (13.57), for example, Cosme Mayo relates an encounter with a fierce anteater during a hunting expedition. His (six) dogs attacked the anteater. Cosme refers to the dogs with overt plural marking in (13.57a) but not in (13.57b).

13.3.2. Semantics

Number markers often have strict dual or plural meaning (and can be satisfactorily translated by a plural in English). But this is not always the case. In some cases, number markers can have an ‘associative’ meaning. This is at least attested with =kwana and =ekatse; more work is needed to determine whether that sort of meaning can also be expressed by =ekana. As such the referent of the noun marked with a number marker is associated with one entity, in the case of =ekatse, or multiple entities, in the case of =kwana, that is/are typically associated with it. Two illustrative examples of =kwana ‘PL’ with an associative meaning are given in (13.60).

‘Even though I’ve traveled (lit. come) in the cart (i.e., I have not walked), my lower back (*lower backs) area hurts.’ ka546

Examples of the marker =ekatse with an associative meaning are given in (13.61).

ju-kware. be-REM.PAST

‘My parents (lit. my daddy and associated person) (lit. *fathers) were sick.’ sl004

In the corpus, no examples were found of =ekana with an associative meaning. Note that no examples were found either of an associative meaning with =kwana or =ekatse for proper names.
In some cases the plural marker =kwana has a distributive effect. This effect is observed with mass nouns. The entity referred to by the mass noun is distributed over different places. This is the case with -na ‘water’, in (13.62a), and yachi ‘pampa’, in (13.62b).

look.at-GO.DISTR-IMPFV 1SG-ERG NPF-space pampa=PL

‘I looked around at the area, at the pampa (*pampas) (scattered in various places).’ ka040

Yet in some other cases, =kwana means that the referent is composed of a collection of various entities. When translating (13.63) below, I was told by Emerenciano Sepa that by using tapeke=kwana, the narrator (Victoria Tavo) meant some elements that typically constitute trip food, such as rice, manioc, meat, etc..

‘You asked me about (lit. for) trip food (i.e., whether we had prepared anything to eat during the trip).’ ka160

13 Note that in this example, the kinship term tata has become an independent noun by taking the derivation suffix -chi ‘AFFTN’ (§12.7.5). This explains why it does not take any possessor inflections.

484 13. Noun phrase structure — modifiers
Note that the plural marker =kwana ‘PL’ is possibly historically related to the phrasal particle =kwana ‘UNCERT’ (§17.2.15), although the semantic connection is not very obvious. Note also that two pronoun-like words correspond to =ekatse ‘DL’ and =ekana ‘PL’, namely ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘3PL’ (§15.6).

13.4. Genitive modifier
A genitive modifier goes into slot C of the NP structure. It consists of an embedded NP marked by the genitive enclitic =ja or a genitive pronoun (§13.4.1).
Genitive modification encodes a range of semantic relations that hold between (normally) referential entities (§13.4.2).
There is some semantic overlap between genitive modification and noun juxtaposition modification (§13.4.3).
Finally, the genitive marker =ja is homophonous with the dative marker =ja ‘DAT’. A discussion of the differences is provided in §14.2.2.3.

13.4.1. Syntax

A genitive constituent has the following morpho-syntactic properties:

1 — a genitive modifier, either phrasal or pronominal, fills slot C of the NP structure. Examples of a genitive modifier co-occurring with other NP modifiers are given in (13.64) and (13.47b) (repeated).

In (13.67), we have three levels of genitive recursion within a locative phrase:
the genitive pronoun e-kwe ‘1SG-GEN’ modifies the head of the genitive phrase
e-kwaa=ja ‘1-mother=GEN’, which itself modifies the head of the genitive phrase e-kwaine=ke=ja ‘3-aunt=3=GEN’, which finally modifies the head of the locative phrase ekarekani=ju ‘NPF-belly=LOC’.14

clause. 15 An even more literal translation would be ‘the one who had lain in my mother’s

13.4. Genitive modifier 487

3 — a genitive modifier, similarly to a juxtaposed noun or an attributive adjective, requires an overt head noun (slot E). However, there is an alternative strategy which allows the expressiong of ‘mine, yours, John’s, the man’s, etc.’. The strategy consists of using a dative oblique phrase (§14.2.2) within a (copula) relative clause (slot H). This is shown in (13.68).

Note that dative phrases are marked by =ja ‘DAT’ which, as was mentioned earlier, is homophonous with =ja ‘GEN’. One could speculate whether the headless ja-phrases in (13.68) above are not simply genitive phrases. In this study, I have preferred the (oblique) dative-and-RC analysis based on the fact that it is quite common for an oblique phrase to be relativized (within copula clauses) whereas with the genitive analysis, the presence of the (obligatory) =ke morpheme is left unaccounted for.

13.4.2. Semantics
Genitive phrases are used for encoding the following semantic relations:
1 — interpersonal relations, as in (13.69a), with a kinship term as NP head, and (13.69b), with an independent noun as NP head.

13.4.3. Genitive modification vs. noun juxtaposition
It was noted that a juxtaposed noun (§13.1) and a genitive modifier both allow a noun to modify another noun. In this section, I will discuss the formal and semantic differences between the two types of constructions.
Note first that these are two clearly different constructions morphosyntactically:
1 — a genitive modifier goes into slot C while a juxtaposed noun goes into slot D; 2 — a genitive modifier consists of an embedded NP or a pronoun. A juxtaposed noun can only be a bare noun;

490 13. Noun phrase structure — modifiers

Semantically, at least some relations expressed by these two constructions are different:

1 — only a juxtaposed noun can express classification, location, naming or time relations; 2 — only a genitive modifier can express interpersonal or ownership relations.

However, both construction can express whole-part and user/creator relations. Still the resulting semantics are most often not identical. Noun juxtaposition is used to categorize, in other words to indicate the type of entity that is being referred to by the head nominal. A juxtaposed noun is never referentially independent from the head noun and cannot be independently modified. Moreover, it is impossible to juxtapose a pronoun. When encoding whole-part relations, the whole has a generic meaning. In (13.19), for example the flesh/meat refers to ‘any monkey’ or ‘any cow’. Genitive modification is used to encode relations between entities that are (normally) referentially distinct. As we saw in §13.4.1, a noun in genitive function can be modified independently from the NP head noun. A genitive modifier can be a pronoun. When encoding whole-part relations, the whole normally refers to a particular entity (i.e., specific and referential) that the speaker has in mind, such as ‘the soldier’ in (13.71a) or ‘the van’ in (13.71c).
The semantic contrast between the juxtaposition construction and the genitive construction is further illustrated by the pair in (13.74), volunteered by Alfredo Tavo.

‘Inside my mosquito net I heard the noise of a mosquito (that had managed to enter).’ n5.0320

Note that in some cases, a genitive modifier appears to be generic. For example, this happens in generic statements about a particular animals or plants, as in (13.71b) (repeated) and (13.75).

‘Fish have a hunched back (lit. the fish’s back is hunched).’ di1816

In (13.76), a conversational turn constructed by Alfredo Tavo, the response to a question about a type of intestines can equally make use of the juxtaposition construction or the genitive construction.

(13.76) A: [Ai sere] tume? INT intestine there
‘What sort of intestines are those?’

B: [Waka sere] / cow intestine

[waka=ja e-sere]. cow=GEN NPF-intestine

Both: ‘(Those are) cow intestines.’ n5.0325

Alfredo Tavo did not seem to see any meaning difference between the two possible answers. It should be pointed out that whereas a genitive modifier can have a generic sense, a juxtaposed noun cannot have a specific referent. In other words, the two construction still remain quite different in terms of specificity.

13.5. Quantifiers
The class of quantifiers includes the four logical quantifiers listed in (13.77a), the 10 numerals listed in (13.77b), the quantifier question marker given in (13.77c) and the word meaning ‘other’ given in (13.77d).

b. numerals17

‘six’ ‘seven’ ‘eight’ ‘nine’ ‘ten’

c. quantifier question marker

ejeuma ‘how many/much’

d. word meaning ‘other’

peya ‘other’

Note that four quantifiers have corresponding (and probably historically related) predicative adjectives. The first three, umada, umae and ejeuma correspond to the da-adjective uma- ‘many, in a great quantity’ — recall that -da ‘ASF’ is a dummy suffix and that eje- ‘INT’ is an interrogative prefix; however the origin of the e ending of the second one is unknown. The fourth quantifier, jetiama, corresponds to the predicative adjective jetiama ‘many, in a great quantity’. See Chapter 11 for a full discussion on predicative adjectives.
In (13.78) I illustrate a number of logical quantifiers.

16 These two logical quantifiers are interchangeable without any meaning differences (compare for example (13.78b) and (13.78c)). Speakers have commented that umada was used in the past more than nowadays. I also observed that jetiama was preferentially used in Galilea (a modern community close to the town of Riberalta) while umada was most often used in Misión Cavinas (a very remote and more traditional community).
17 As we will see below, only the numerals for ‘one’ and ‘two’ are originally from Cavineña. The remaining numerals, from ‘three’ to ‘ten’, have been borrowed from Aymara.

Quantifiers have the following morpho-syntactic properties:

1 — quantifiers occur in slot B of the NP structure. Examples showing the quantifier dutya ‘all’ co-occurring with other NP modifiers are given in (13.82) and (13.78a) (repeated).

Note that this is not to say that quantifiers are heading the NP. This is so because an underlying head noun is always recoverable. Recovering the ellipsed head noun can depend on anaphora. In (13.83b), (13.83c) and (13.83d), the ellipsed nouns ‘jungle meat’, ‘chicken’ and ‘the type of hunting’, respectively, are topics within stretches of discourse preceding these examples. Recovering the ellipsed head noun can also depend on the immediate context. In (13.83a), the head noun refers to an entity that is present in the speech situation. Note that in this example, the identity of the head noun is also recovered from the bound pronoun =ekwana.
In afterthought situations, the referent of an ellipsed head can be overtly expressed by a noun within a different NP (in apposition) in the same sentence as the quantifier. This is seen in the two examples in (13.84).

One might want to analyze the quantifiers in these examples as ‘floating quantifiers’ as found in many languages such Japanese, Korean, Tzotzil, Lakhota and Pima (Uto-Aztecan) (see Munro 1984; Downing 1993). In this study, I have not retained this analysis, for the reason that, in Cavineña, not only quantifiers, but also other NP modifiers, notably relative clauses, can occur ‘away’ from their

496 13. Noun phrase structure — modifiers

head, i.e., not in their respective slots, whereas ‘floating’ is normally restricted to quantifiers only.
For counting from eleven to a ninety-nine, there is a counting formula which is known/remembered by some speakers, but is not used nowadays. This formula makes use of the numeral tunka ‘ten’ and the word earakana ‘unit’18, as follows: ‘X tunka Y erarakana’ (lit. X ten and Y unit(s)), where X and Y are filled by one of the above numerals from 1 to 9. The system is illustrated in (13.85).

(13.85)

a. peadya tunka peadya earakana peadya tunka beta earakana peadya tunka kimisha earakana etc.

‘11 (lit. one ten one unit)’ ‘12 (lit. one ten two units)’ ‘13 (lit. one ten three units)’

b. beta tunka beta tunka peadya earakana beta tunka beta earakana beta tunka kimisha earakana etc.

‘20 (lit. two ten)’ ‘21 (lit. two ten one unit)’ ‘22 (lit. two ten two units)’ ‘23 (li.t two ten three units)’

c. kimisha tunka kimisha tunka peadya earakana kimisha tunka beta earakana kimisha tunka kimisha earakana etc.

‘30 (lit. three ten)’ ‘31 (lit. three ten one unit)’ ‘32 (lit. two ten two units)’ ‘33 (lit. two ten three units)’

An example of this formula used in context is given in (13.86).

Nobody counts using the formula. Many speakers are not even aware of it. Cavineña speakers use Spanish numerals instead: once ‘eleven’, doce ‘twelve’, veinte ‘twenty’, etc. Similarly, counting above ninety-nine is only done with Spanish numerals, i.e., using the terms cien ‘hundred’, mil ‘thousand’, etc.

18 Note that the glossing ‘unit’ given to earakana is tentative as this word is never used outside of the counting formula.

13.5. Quantifiers 497

In (at least) one example, in (13.87) below, a quantifying phrase was found modifying the head of an NP.

(13.87)

[E-kwe e-bakujunaO [ara-kara ju-ya]

[[cuatro kuchara] mateka]O.

=2DL ask.for-CAUS-IMPFV four spoon butter

‘Because my daughter is hungry, I am having someone ask you (dl) for four spoons of butter.’ di1932

This could indicate that not only single quantifier words, or counting formulas, can fill slot B of the NP structure, but also more complex phrases, such as that used for measuring a mass noun in (13.87). However, I will remain cautious before making this statement. First, note that in this example, both the quantifying phrase and the NP head are involve words borrowed from Spanish. Second, this is the only example showing a quantifying phrase in slot B in the available data. Third, Cavineña normally uses postpositional phrases for the purpose of quantifying entities with ‘mass’ semantics (see §14.3.2).
With the exception of peadya ‘one’ and beta ‘two’, all numerals are clearly borrowings from Aymara. Note that Quechua also has numerals very similar in shape to Aymara and could have been a potential source language as well. However, there are Quechua numerals which are clearly different from Aymara and Cavineña. This indicates that Cavineña has rather borrowed from Aymara than Quechua. In Table 13.3, I provide the list of numerals in the three languages. Note that the Aymara and Quechua numerals which substantially differ from Cavineña are in boldface.
It should be noted that, apart from peadya ‘one’ and beta ‘two’, those numerals are hardly ever used — Spanish numerals are used instead. Speakers are usually able to remember kimisha ‘three’, pushi ‘four’, pishika ‘five’ and tunka ‘ten’, but rarely the remaining ones.
Note finally that Cavineña does not have a proper term for zero. In this case, the Spanish term cero ‘zero’ is used instead.

13.6. Relative clauses
A relative clause (RC) consists of a finite clause (i.e., a clause whose verb takes an inflectional TAM suffix) that modifies the head of an NP. RCs are marked by the ligature enclitic =ke ‘LIG’ that is attached to the last phonological word of the RC. An RC goes into slot A or H of the NP structure. A brief discussion of RC morpho-syntactic properties is given in §13.6. A full discussion of RCs is provided in Chapter 20.

13.6.1. Syntax

RCs have the following morpho-syntactic properties:

1 — the most common position for an RC is postposed to the head in slot H of the NP structure. RCs in slot H co-occurring with different types of NP modifiers are shown in (13.88) and (13.47b) (repeated).

(RCs can also be found preposed to the head. This is discussed in §13.6.2.)

2 — a verbal RC such as the one in (13.88) consists of a finite clause. The RC predicate is inflected with a TAM suffix such as -kware in (13.88a); the RC predicate can also take any non-inflectional suffixes. An RC can include the same range of constituents that can be found in a main clause, e.g., core arguments, oblique phrases, independent particles, subordinate clauses, etc. In (13.88a) above, for example, the RC contains a purpose subordinate clause. And in (13.89) below, the RC contains an independent pronoun in O function.

The only type of constituents that RCs cannot contain are second position clitics, whether second position particles (§16.3) or bound pronouns (§15.2).

3 — a copula RC typically only consists of a copula complement and the marker =ke ‘LIG’; that is, the copula verb (ju- ‘be’) is most often omitted, as in (13.90).

See also siwa=ja=ke ‘of the deer’ in (13.88b) and yachi=ju=ke ‘from the pampa’ in (13.83d).
Copula RCs also allow (peripheral) demonstratives (jee ‘here’, tume ‘there’, etc.) to be used as modifiers of an NP head; recall that Cavineña does not have specific NP demonstratives. This is discussed in §13.6.2. 4 — the ligature =ke is deleted when it occurs in the same clitic sequence with a postposition and when it precedes the postposition. This happens in (13.92) where a copula RC modifies a noun (bina ‘bat’) within an A NP (marked by the ergative postposition =ra ‘ERG’).

5 — when the plural marker =kwana ‘PL’ follows an RC, as happens when the head of the NP is omitted, the ligature =ke follows =kwana; that is, it does not precede it, as would be otherwise expected. This can be seen in (13.51a) (repeated).

6 — an RC does not require an overt NP head as in (13.50b) and (13.51a); 7 — an RC can be either externally headed, in which case the common argument (CA) is stated within the main clause (MC), or internally headed, in which case the CA is stated within the RC. In §20.3, I present a number of tests (constituency, nature of CA, case marking) that help to decide whether an RC is externally or internally headed. As an illustration, the RC in (13.92) is externally headed because the CA (bina ‘bat’) is absolutively marked (according to its CS function within the MC) whereas it would be ergatively marked if its A function within the RC had been encoded. By contrast, the RC in (13.93) is internally headed because the CA (e-tare ‘NPF-house’) occurs between two immediate constituents of the RC.

See also Galilea epu=ju=ke waraji ‘the chief of the village of Galilea’ in (13.15).
Verbal RCs preposed to the head, such as the one in (13.94), are rare — they normally occur in slot H. However, the position before the NP head is actually the obligatory position for a number of copula RCs, notably demonstrative RCs and interrogative RCs. These two types of RCs are discussed in turn below.
There is an unusual use of the RC construction as a strategy to express the equivalent of NP demonstratives. Cavineña has specific peripheral demonstratives, i.e., demonstratives used at the clause level such as English ‘here’ or ‘there’ (see §§15.7-8). However, it lacks specific NP demonstratives, i.e., demonstratives used at the NP level such as English ‘this’ or ‘that’. One of the strategies the language has to express the equivalent of an NP demonstrative consists of using a peripheral demonstrative within a copula RC that is placed in slot A of the NP structure, giving literally ‘the X who is here/there’. As an illustration, in (13.95), I give examples of copula RCs with each of the four peripheral demonstratives.

A case could be made for treating NP demonstrative constructions as distinct from (copula) relative clauses. Note that these constructions never include the copula verb ju- ‘be’ (or any other verb), nor any other clausal constituent; that is, NP demonstratives only consist of a bare peripheral demonstrative root and the marker =ke. As such, one can question whether these constructions are clauses at all. Provisionally, I have retained an analysis in terms of (copula) relative clauses because of the following striking similarities between NP demonstratives and RCs:

1 — NP demonstratives are preposed to the NP head, similarly to some preposed RCs; 2 — NP demonstratives, similarity to RCs, do not require an overt NP head, as in (13.96).

See also jee=ke ‘this (person)’ in (13.15). 3 — NP demonstratives are structurally complex. They consist of a bare root and an obligatory marker =ke. Note that the bare demonstrative roots (without =ke) are also found used as peripheral demonstratives, as with yume ‘over there’ in (13.97).

The marker =ke behaves similarly to the morpheme =ke ‘LIG’ that marks RCs, as follows. It is deleted when it occurs in the same clitic sequence with a postposition and precedes the postposition, as in (13.98).

There is a second type of RCs that are obligatorily preposed to the NP head: copula interrogative RCs, based on the word eje ‘INT’ and the ligature marker =ke. These are used to question the identity of a referent, as in (13.100), or to express the fact that a referent has a generic identity, as in (13.101).

The copula interrogative RC construction has basically the same properties as any RC:

1 — a copula interrogative RC is preposed to the NP head, which is a position attested with other types of RC (slot A); 2 — a copula interrogative RC, similarity to RCs, does not require an overt NP head, as shown in (13.102).

RCs preposed to the NP head, whether verbal or copula, hardly ever cooccur with any other types of modifiers preposed to the NP head — quantifiers (slot B), genitive modifier (slot C) or juxtaposed nouns (slot D). The rare example in (13.105) where a (demonstrative) RC precedes a genitive modifier suggests that an RC preposed to the NP head belongs to a slot further away from the head than C.

I could not find any example where an RC preposed to the NP head co-occurs with a quantifier (slot B) so that one could speculate whether they could belong to the same slot (B) and be mutually exclusive. In this work, I have preferred setting up a slot A distinct from slot B because:

1 — quantifier and RC are very different structurally; 2 — there is a general tendency in Cavineña for different types of

13.6. Relative clauses 507
words/constituents to have their own structural slot; 3 — semantically, there are no cogent reason why they should be exclusive of each other (e.g., ‘these three men’).

13.6.3. Semantics

RCs can have a restrictive function, i.e., helping to identify a unique referent among a choice of possible referents, as in (13.106), with a demonstrative copula RC preposed to the NP head and a verbal RC postposed to the NP head.

Chapter 14 Postpositions

Cavineña is a dependent-marking language which makes heavy use of postpositions for relational purposes. Cavineña postpositions are monomorphemic (grammatical) words. Most postpositions are independent grammatically but not phonologically. They are clitic words attached to the last phonological word of their argument (postpositional object NP). They cannot be used on their own. A few postpositions are phonologically independent. An introduction to the morpho-syntactic properties of Cavineña postpositions and postpositional phrases is provided in §14.1.
According to their morpho-syntactic properties, postpositions can first be sorted into two broad sets: those that obligatorily require an argument and those that do not. Among the postpositions that require an obligatory argument we can distinguish between major postpositions and minor postpositions. Major postpositions, which are presented in §14.2, have a high functional load; that is, they are used very frequently and with a fairly wide range of meanings and functions. Minor postpositions are discussed in §14.3. They have more specific meanings and, as a result, are used more sparingly. Postpositions with an optional argument are dealt with in §14.4. Similarly to minor postpositions, these morphemes have very specific semantics, such as ‘above’, ‘under’, ‘inside’, ‘outside’, ‘behind’, ‘at the corner of’, etc. However, they differ substantially in that the postposition to be discussed here (1) can occur with or without an argument and (2) can combine with an additional postposition.

14.1. Morpho-syntactic introduction

The main function of postpositions in Cavineña is to relate an NP to a predicate, as with =tsewe ‘ASSOC’ and =ju ‘LOC’ in (14.1) relating ekwe e-wane ‘my wife’ and ekwe tujuri ‘my mosquito net’ to the intransitive predicate kanajara-kware ‘rest-REM.PAST’.

‘Me, I was resting with my wife in my mosquito net.’ bi012

510 14. Postpositions

Most postpositions mark oblique functions and have lexical semantics; this is the case with =ju ‘LOC’ and =tsewe ‘ASSOC’ in the previous example. But postpositions are also used for encoding core grammatical functions. An NP in transitive subject function — regardless of any semantic or pragmatic considerations — is obligatorily marked by =ra ‘ERG’, as in (14.2a). The absence of any postpositional marking on an NP encodes an intransitive subject (or copula clause subject), as in (14.2b) and (14.2c), an object, as in (14.2a), or a copula complement, as in (14.2c).

‘Here (in this picture), we were in the pampa.’ ft042

Postpositional phrases cannot function at the NP level, i.e., cannot directly modify the head noun of an NP, unless through the use of relativization. In (14.4), for example, for the locative phrase Reye=ju ‘in (the town of) Reyes’ to modify ekwita ‘man’ (the head of a copula subject NP), the locative phrase has to be a copula complement, then relativized with the ligature marker =ke.

14.1. Morpho-syntactic introduction 511

man who was in Reyes.) (He metamorphosed into a jaguar.)’ ht030

In this example, as is most often (athough not obligatorily) the case the copula predicate ju- ‘be’ is ellipsed.
Note that the dative marker =ja ‘DAT’ (§14.2.2) is homophonous with the genitive marker =ja ‘GEN’ (§13.4). One might wish to analyze these two morphemes as polysemous and say that phrases marked by =ja can occur both at the NP and the clause level. Argumentation against this analysis is presented in §14.2.2.3.
Relativization within headless oblique NPs is a major strategy for producing equivalents of adverbial subordinate clauses. An example is given in (14.5), involving the postposition =keja ‘LOC.GNL’.

‘He (the priest) went towards where I was playing sitting (on the ground).’ es011

It is worth mentioning that many postpositions involve the formative ke:

(14.6)

=eke =keja dyake emake jiteke/jeteke peke

‘PERL’ ‘LOC.GNL’ ‘ON’ ‘UNDER’ ‘LOOKING.FOR’ ‘AT.SIDE.OF’

One might want to further analyze these postpositions. Note that ke is also the form of the ligature marker (marking relative clauses) and as such it can be attached to a postposition; see for example the sequence =ju=ke ‘=LOC=LIG’ in (14.4) above. However, the remaining parts either do not occur outside of these postpositions (e.g., jite in jiteke, ema in emake), or they do but with very different meanings. Taking =keja as an example, we have =ja as a the dative marker. But semantically, the meanings of the dative marker — possession, benefactive, experiencer (see §14.2.2.1) — are quite distinct from the ones of =keja — location/target, causee (see §14.2.4.1). Note that there is an attested combination of the ligature and the dative markers but it is =ja=ke not *=ke=ja (see §20.1.2). Therefore, although the ligature =ke might have been part of these postpositions

512 14. Postpositions

historically, one is forced synchronically to treat these postpositions as monomorphemic.
There are no syntactic restrictions on the order of the postpositional phrases (core or oblique) in main clauses, constituents being positioned according to pragmatic considerations in Cavineña. The dimensions of expectation and/or contrast appear to play a major role. The less expected and/or the more contrastive information is, the more fronted it will appear in the clause. In (14.7), for example, ‘with wasp’ comes first in the clause probably because for a bird to feed its baby with (dangerous) wasps is quite unusual and surprising.

wasp=ASSOC=FOC =3PL-DAT =3SG(-FM) child

feed-IMPFV

‘They (the caciques) feed their babies with wasps.’ am003

In (14.8) ‘towards the back’ is probably fronted because it contrasts with the rest of the bus where there is no space.

(14.8)

[Flota tada=keja] ani-kware campoS. bus butt=LOC.GNL sit-REM.PAST space
‘Towards the back (lit. butt) of the bus there was some space (left) (where I could put my sixty chickens and my three ducks).’ ga020

In (14.9), ‘by lianas’ is fronted probably because this is an unexpected way to climb on trees.

ekatseS tsura-ya.

liana=PERL =MAYBE 3DL go.up-IMPFV

‘They (the two legendary brothers) would probably climb (on top of the trees) along lianas.’ hm026

On the other hand, in dependent clauses (of any type), any postpositional phrases (as well as any other clausal constituents) have to precede the verb.
Finally, note that none of the postpositional phrases, except for ergative ones, are obligatory. In other words, there are no verbs with extended core arguments in Cavineña.
Postpositional phrases can be ‘replaced’ by specific single words. In (14.10), for example, the associative postpositional phrase Rure=keja which occurs in the first clause can be replaced by the single word tu-keja in the second.

These words, for which I will use the cover term ‘pro-form’, belong to three different word classes: demonstratives, which refer to a place, as with tu-keja in (14.10), pronouns, which refer to a person, animal or thing, or interrogatives. The pro-forms involve a root and a suffix which is formally identical to a corresponding postposition; e.g., the suffix -keja in tu-keja is formally identical to the postposition =tsewe. In most pro-forms, however, the root cannot be analyzed as a noun that could be used on its own, i.e., without the suffix; e.g., the root tu in tu-keja. This is one of the reasons why I analyze the pro-forms as consisting of a root and a suffix and not as a root and a postposition; see a full discussion of this in §15.1.2. The paradigms of the pro-forms are given, illustrated and briefly discussed in the following sections. A full account is provided in other sections of this grammar: pronouns in §15.1, demonstratives in §15.7, and interrogatives in §4.5.4.

14.2. Major postpositions
Major postpositions have a high functional load; that is, they are used very frequently and with a fairly wide range of meanings and functions. They consist of the following six morphemes: associative marker =tsewe (§14.2.1, dative marker =ja (§14.2.2), locative marker =ju (§14.2.3), general locative marker =keja (§14.2.4), perlative =eke (§14.2.5) and ‘up to’ marker =tupu (§14.2.6).

14.2.1. =tsewe ‘ASSOC’
14.2.1.1. Semantics
The postposition =tsewe has two central meanings: (1) comitative, meaning ‘together with, accompanied by’, and (2) instrumental, indicating an instrument used in the process of the event.
The comitative meaning of =tsewe is illustrated in (14.11).

‘(I see that) you are scared of the water.’ n4.0513

Finally, the postposition =tsewe is also used as a means for certain adjec-
tives to be used ‘adverbially’, i.e., as verb/predicate modifiers, as illustrated in (14.16).1

Another example can be found in (14.65a) below. There are no specific pro-forms to question an associative phrase. This has
to be done with the interrogative noun ai as the argument of the associative postposition =tsewe. This is illustrated in (14.19a) (comitative meaning) and (14.19b) (instrumental meaning). This latter example comes from a recorded conversation where I was involved. Here the speaker wants to know how people fish in my country, and more particularly, what sort of fishing instruments they use.

14.2.2. =ja ‘DAT’
14.2.2.1. Semantics
Dative postpositional phrases can refer to a possessor, a benefactive, an experiencer, or an agent. These different semantic roles are discussed in turn below.
A dative postpositional phrase expresses the meaning of possession in clauses headed by the copula verb ju- ‘be’ or the postural verbs ani- ‘sit’ or neti- ‘stand’. Such clauses can be thought of as functional equivalents of possession clauses in languages which have a specific verb meaning ‘have’; note such a verb is absent in Cavineña. The possessee corresponds to the core S ar-

518 14. Postpositions

gument of the existential/postural verb while the possessor is expressed by an oblique dative phrase. This is illustrated in (14.20).

white.man=DAT =3SG(-FM) many cow sit-IMPFV

‘The white man has many cows (lit. many cows sit to the white man).’ di1457

See also (14.24b) with a dative pronoun. Note that there are other strategies in Cavineña for expressing clausal possession. One such strategy consists of deriving a predicative adjective from a noun with the suffixes -ki ‘WITH’ or -ma ‘WITHOUT’; see §11.3.1.
The benefactive meaning of =ja is illustrated in (14.21).

(14.21) a. Ebakwapiji=ja =pa e-naO

bonnet child

young=DAT HORT.SG-affect

‘I’m going to make a bonnet for the baby!’ di0715

Another example is given in (14.24c), with a dative pronoun. The experiencer meaning of =ja obtains in copula clauses involving certain
predicative adjectives as complement (see §11.1.1). Here the (oblique) dative phrase specifies a participant that experiences the property denoted by the adjective (in CC function) on the CS argument referent. This is illustrated in (14.22).

Finally, the agentive meaning of =ja is found in copula clauses involving two types of deverbal predicative adjectives: abilitative adjectives, derived by -taki ‘ABIL’ (§11.3.3), as in (14.23a), and resultative adjectives, derived by e‘RES’ or -ma ‘RES.NEG’ (§11.3.4), as in (14.23b).

520 14. Postpositions
As discussed in §11.3.3 and §11.3.4, the oblique dative phrases in these clauses correspond to the original A argument of the transitive verb which has been turned into an adjective.

14.2.2.2. Pro-forms

There is a set of dative independent pronouns which can stand for a dative phrase. Note that these pronouns are identical in form to genitive pronouns. Note also that in addition to dative independent pronouns, Cavineña also has dative bound pronouns (see §15.1.2). Dative independent pronouns are listed in Table 14.2.

There are no specific dative interrogative pro-forms. A referent in dative function has to be questioned by using the interrogative noun ai ‘INT’ as head of a dative phrase, as in (14.25), a conversation turn constructed by Francisco Vaca. Note that the dative phrases occur within copula relative clauses.

14.2.2.3. Dative vs. genitive

It was observed that the dative and genitive markers are homophonous. It was also noted that dative phrases can express the semantics of ‘possession’. This could suggest that dative and genitive are not distinct constructions. However, there are a number of differences that distinguish them clearly:

1 — dative and genitive constructions have a different distribution. A genitive phrase (or genitive independent pronoun) is a constituent of an NP (slot C; §13.4) whereas a dative phrase (or dative independent pronoun) is a constituent of a clause. This is (at least) clear from second position clitic placement: if a genitive phrase comes first in a main clause that involves second position clitics, these clitics are attached to the last phonological word of the NP the genitive phrase belongs to, never to the genitive phrase itself, as with =pa ‘REP’ and =tu ‘3SG’ in (14.26).

On the other hand, if a dative phrase comes first in a main clause that involves second position clitics, these clitics are attached directly to the dative phrase, as with =tu ‘3SG’ in (14.20c) (repeated).

14.2.3. =ju ‘LOC’

14.2.3.1. Semantics

The locative postposition =ju marks an NP that indicates a precise location, if it is used with a non-motion verb, or a precise target, if it is used with a motion verb. As we will see in §14.2.4 below, it contrasts with the general locative postposition =keja ‘LOC.GNL’, which indicates approximate locations/targets. The marker =ju can also have temporal and abstract meanings.
The examples in (14.27) illustrate =ju specifying the exact location of nonmotion events.

given in (14.28), with intransitive verbs, and (14.29), with transitive verbs.

It appears that the marker =ju cannot directly mark animate entities — if it does, there are some idiosyncratic abstract meanings, as in waka=ju ‘cow=LOC’ ‘in cattle farming’, discussed in (14.34) below. Note however that the part of an animate entity can be marked by =ju, as in (14.31).

Note that Cavineña has a subordinating marker homophonous with the locative postposition, =ju ‘DS’, which can seen in the first clause of (14.32c). See discussion of this marker in §19.2.
There are also a number of more abstract uses of the postposition =ju. For example, =ju can mark -ana ‘tongue, language’ to mean ‘in the language’ as in (14.33).

Here, ‘language’ is viewed as a location/repository of words. Note that -ana can also be marked by =eke ‘PERL’ in which case it is viewed as a mean of communication; see (14.55) in §14.2.5 below.
The marker =ju is also found marking waka ‘cow’ with the meaning ‘in cattle farming’ in (14.34).

14.2.3.2. Pro-forms

There are a number of pro-forms which can be used instead of a locative phrase marked by =ju.
First, there is set of adverbial demonstratives, given in Table 14.3 and illustrated in (14.35).

‘(When we arrived at the village, my companions said to everybody, talking about me:) He has killed a caimani. There (where we were fishing) he threw iti away.’ lg046

Second, there is an interrogative pro-form eju. This pro-form is essentially used for entities which exclusively have a locative meaning, such as the entities illustrated in (14.27) and (14.28). It is illustrated in (14.36a), with an intransitive verb, and (14.36b), with a transitive verb.

Terms which are only occasionally used in a locative sense, such as body parts (e.g., e-kwita ‘body’ in (14.31)) or containers (e.g., sura ‘jug’ in (14.30)), are questioned with the interrogative noun ai. This is illustrated with a conversation turn volunteered by Francisco Vaca in (14.37) and an example from a recorded conversation in (14.38); compare this example with (14.36b) where the same transitive verb duju- ‘take’ is used.

14.2.4. =keja ‘LOC.GNL’

14.2.4.1. Semantics

The central meaning of the postposition =keja ‘LOCative GeNeraL’ is to indicate an approximate location/target for the event expressed by the predicate. In addition =keja can also have temporal and other more abstract meanings.
The approximate location/target meaning expressed by =keja contrasts with the precise location/target meaning manifested by =ju ‘LOC’. An example showing this contrast is given in (14.39).

Jenewaya=keja. Geneshuaya.river=LOC.GNL
‘At that time I was (living) in (the Cavineña community of) Francia, somewhere close to the Geneshuaya river.’ vi002

The postposition =keja can specify a location, when it is used with a nonmotion verb, as in (14.39) and (14.8) (repeated), or a target, when it is used with a motion verbs, as in (14.40a,b).

Note that in chine=keja, the postposition might have become lexicalized. This expression has a fixed meaning which is ‘afternoon’. In other words, it means ‘toward the evening’. It cannot mean ‘after the evening’, a reading which should otherwise be acceptable if the sense of ‘approximate’ was kept.
We saw in the preceding section that terms for animate beings cannot be directly marked by =ju. However they can be marked by =keja. An illustration of this is provided in (14.42).

Finally, the postposition =keja can be used to mark the causee of a causativized transitive verb in the case of indirect causation — recall that in the case of direct causation, the causee is marked as a core argument (§8.4.2.) An illustrative pair is given in (14.43).

14.2.4.2. Pro-forms

There are a number of pro-forms that can stand for phrases marked by =keja. First, there is a set of general location demonstratives, given in Table 14.4 and illustrated in (14.44). Note that (14.44b) is a repeated example.

Second, there is a set of general location pronouns which can stand for general location phrases marking animate entities (such as those in (14.42) above). The forms are listed in Table 14.5 and illustrated in (14.45).

14.2. Major postpositions 531

Third, there is an interrogative general location pro-form, ejekeja, which is used to question (approximate) locations/targets with inanimate referents. It is illustrated in (14.46).

‘(The grandfather asked his grandson:) “Whereabouts are we (dl) going fishing?” “Let’s (dl) go somewhere upriver, somewhere around the eddy!” (the grandson replied.)’ ps004-006

The interrogative pro-form ejekeja cannot be used if the question is about the location/target of an animate entity (e.g., ‘his compadre’ in (14.42a) or ‘the missionary’ in (14.42b)) or the causee of a causativized transitive verb (e.g., ‘her child’ in (14.43b)). For this use, there are no specific pro-forms available. The interrogative noun ai must be used, marked by the general location postposition, as in the volunteered conversational turn in (14.47).

‘Whom did they ask to call the teenager? It is me whom they asked to call the teenager.’ n3.0493

14.2.4.3. Increment -amaka
The postposition =keja, or its corresponding pro-forms, can take an additional formative increment, -amaka, which adds to the imprecision of the location/target expressed by =keja. Note that besides =keja, -amaka is only attested in a similar combination with the postposition =eke ‘PERL’; see §14.2.5.3 below. For this reason, I treat =kejaamaka as lexicalized and give it a unique gloss ‘LOC.APPROX’.
The semantic difference between =keja and =kejaamaka can be seen in (14.48), an example extracted from a recount by Francisco Vaca about his experience as a (motorcycle) taxi driver.

Together with =ju ‘LOC’, =keja and =kejaamaka can be placed on a scale of location/target precision, with =ju at one end — indicating a very precise location — and =kejaamaka on the other end — indicating a very approximate location.
The form =kejaamaka is rather rare in the data. From the examples available it only has locational meanings: locative meaning with non-motion verbs, as in (14.49); target meaning with motion verbs, as in (14.50).

14.2. Major postpositions 533

14.2.5. =eke ‘PERL’

14.2.5.1. Semantics

The perlative postposition =eke has a broad range of meanings. Its most central meaning appears to be perlative, i.e., ‘through (a place)’. Other spatial meanings include ablative, i.e., ‘from (a place)’ and adhesive, i.e., ‘along a place’. The postposition =eke can also have non-spatial meanings. For example, it can be used to express a vehicle, i.e., ‘on/by way of’. It can finally have temporal and other more abstract uses.
The different spatial meanings of =eke are illustrated in (14.51) and (14.9) (repeated).

Recall that vehicles can also be marked with the postposition =tsewe ‘ASSOC’; see avioneta=tsewe ‘by light plane’ in (14.13b) above. The exact motivations for using the associative or the perlative postpositions when referring to vehicles are unknown.
The postposition =eke can be used to express vehicles/means of transportation of more abstract entities such as information: -ana ‘tongue, language’ in (14.55a), radio ‘(shortwave) radio transmitter’ in (14.55b), keke ‘a shout’, kwatsabiji ‘a story’, etc.

This is unfortunately the only example available. Futher work is needed to investigate whether the range of meanings illustrated with =eke here can be found with animate entities as well.

14.2.5.2. Pro-forms

There is a set of perlative demonstrative pro-forms, as given in Table 14.6 and exemplified in (14.61).

538 14. Postpositions

There is also an interrogative pro-form ejeeke which has a locative meaning only — not an instrumental-like meaning. It is illustrated in (14.62a) and with a conversation turn volunteered by Francisco Vaca in (14.62b).

‘A: Where is the path that leads (lit. goes) to Cavinas? Here? B: No! A: There? B: No! (It is) over there!’ n1.0570

When questioning the instrumental-like meaning of =eke, as in (14.53) above, one must use a phrase with the interrogative noun ai marked with =eke, as in (14.63), a volunteered example by Francisco Vaca.

14.2.5.3. Increment -amaka
The postposition =eke can take the same increment formative -amaka as =keja (see §14.2.4.3 above). Unfortunately, I only have one example, in (14.64) below, where =ekeamaka marks a headless NP.

More work is required to discuss further the formative -amaka with =eke.

14.2.6. =tupu ‘UP.TO’

14.2.6.1. Semantics

The postposition =tupu ‘UP.TO’ is used to specify a point in space/time up to/until where/when an event happens.
The spatial meaning of =tupu with motion verbs is illustrated in (14.65a), with an intransitive verb, and (14.65b), with a transitive verb.

Various temporal meanings of =tupu are illustrated in (14.67): ‘until’ in (14.67a), ‘at’ in (14.67b) and ‘up to’ in (14.67c).

14.2.6.2. Pro-form
There are no specific demonstrative or pronominal pro-forms corresponding to phrases marked by =tupu. The closest equivalent of such pro-forms would be

14.2. Major postpositions 541

phrases where =tupu is attached to one of the adverbial demonstratives re-wa ‘here-LOC’, tu-wa ‘there-LOC’ or yu-wa ‘over.there-LOC’ (§15.7), in which case the resulting meaning is spatial (as opposed to temporal), as in (14.68) (from a mythical story).

The postposition =tupu can also be attached to one of the pointing demonstratives riya ‘here’, jee ‘here’, tume ‘there’, yume ‘over.there’ (§15.8), in which case the resulting meaning is temporal, as in (14.69).

Such sentences are typically used by narrators when terminating their stories. There is however a specific interrogative pro-form, ejetupu, which is mostly
used for questioning time; note that I do not have any clear example showing ejetupu questioning space. It is illustrated in (14.70).

542 14. Postpositions
14.3. Minor postpositions
Unlike major postpositions, minor postpositions tend to be used less frequently. Their meaning is often more concrete/specific. They tend to lack specific sets of pro-forms and to be phonologically independent (although some are phonologically dependent). They consist of the following four morphemes: the marker jiteke/jeteke ‘LOOKING.FOR’ (§14.3.1), a set of quantifier postpositions (§14.3.2), the marker =kama ‘ONLY’ (§14.3.3) and the marker =taka ‘ALONE’ (§14.3.4).

14.3.1. Jiteke/jeteke ‘LOOKING.FOR’

The central meaning of the postposition jiteke/jeteke is to encode a sense of desire for the entity that it marks. According to the situation, it translates variously as ‘looking for, missing, searching, longing for, with interest for, etc.’ Its most common pronounciation is jiteke but it is also occasionally heard as jeteke; for examples of jeteke, see (7.34b) and (10.8).
The most common use of jiteke/jeteke is with a verb of motion in which case the postposition indicates an entity that is looked for. This is illustrated in (14.71), a conversation turn constructed by Antonio Yubanera.

544 14. Postpositions

There are no specific pro-forms for phrases marked by jiteke/jeteke. Jiteke/jeteke can mark an independent pronoun, such as mi-ke ‘2SG-FM’ in (14.73b) above. As for questions, they are made by using the interrogative noun ai as the argument of jiteke/jeteke, in (14.74).

14.3.2. Quantifier postpositions

Quantifier postpositions mark a noun that is taken as a measuring unit to quantify the S or the O argument, or the predicate event itself. Quantifier postpositions are clearly related to the numeral series, i.e., peadya ‘one’, beta ‘two’, kimisha ‘three’, etc. (see §13.5).
The postposition pidya ‘(the amount of) ONE WHOLE’ corresponds to the quantifier peadya ‘one’, with the phonological reduction ea  i. It is illustrated in (14.75) (a volunteered example).

(14.75)

Elsa=raA =tuO

Elsa=ERG =3SG(-FM) manioc fetch-PERF basket ONE.WHOLE

‘Elsa fetched a full basket of manioc (lit. Elsa fetched manioc the amount of one full basket).’ n5.0262

Note that unlike in the English translation, jiti pidya is an oblique constituent and not part of the O NP. This is made clear by the fact that the head of the O NPs kwawe ‘manioc’ and jiti pidya ‘the amount of a full basket’ are separated by the predicate of the clause keti-wa ‘fetched’.
The other quantifier postpositions have the exact same form as their lexical numeral counterparts: beta ‘(the amount of) TWO WHOLE’, kimisha ‘(the amount of) THREE WHOLE’, etc. An illustrative example is provided in (14.76).

‘Elsa brought two/three/four/etc. full baskets of manioc.’ n5.0273

14.3. Minor postpositions 545

Quantifier postpositions typically mark nouns referring to containers such as jiti ‘basket’ in (14.75) and (14.76) above, e-marikaka ‘cooking pot’ in (14.77a), or karetu ‘cart’ in (14.77c).

Quantifier postpositional phrases are used to quantify either an O argument, as in the preceding examples, or an S argument, as in (14.78), or the predicate event itself, as in (14.79).

(14.78)

Tu-wa =tunaS ani-ya [e-tare pidya]. there-LOC =3PL sit-IMPFV NPF-house ONE.WHOLE

‘My husband worked there a whole week.’ ri037

One could argue that the morphemes pidya, beta, kimisha, etc. discussed here are NP modifiers rather the postpositions, in other words that they would all make a unique category. The reasons why this option has not been retained are that:

1 — one quantifier postposition, pidya ‘ONE.WHOLE’, has a different form from the (otherwise) NP modifier (peadya ‘one’);

546 14. Postpositions
2 — functionally, quantifier postpositions do not only modify arguments but also predicates (e.g., (14.79)); 3 — the quantifier postpositions and their object can be separated from the NP they modify.

14.3.3. =kama ‘ONLY’

The postposition =kama means ‘just, only, purely, nobody/nothing/nowhere
else than’. It is only attested in a few examples and its meanings and morphosyntax are not entirely understood yet.2
I illustrate =kama in (14.80).

‘After doing so (tying my canoe), I came on the track all the way. (I did not leave the track.)’ pe008

2 This morpheme (and related particle =kamadya; §17.2.5) is almost certainly a loan from Quechua (possibly via Aymara), where it has the related meaning ‘exclusively’ (W. Adelaar, p.c.).

In one example, the postposition =kama marks a verb, tsajaja- ‘run’, in a non-finite form (i.e., without an inflectional affix), as shown in (14.82).

‘After I said so, I went back running all the way.’ ce042

More work is needed to determine whether verbs can productively be marked by =kama.
Note that =kama is related to the phrasal particle =kamadya ‘RESTR’ (which is a frozen combination of kama plus the focus particle =dya; see §17.2.5).

14.3.4. =taka ‘ALONE’

The postposition =taka ‘ALONE’ has a meaning fairly similar to =kama, i.e., ‘just, only, alone, etc.’ Quite similarly to =kama there are very few examples of =taka and the present discussion can only be tentative. A rare example of =taka is given in (14.83) (from Camp and Liccardi’s (1989) dictionary).

14.4. Postpositions with an optional argument
14.4.1. General overview
A number of morphemes with spatial relational meanings have a postpositional function on the basis that they can follow an NP (their postpositional object / argument) and relate it to a predicate. These postpositions differ in two major ways from the postpositions discussed thus far: (1) they can occur with or without an argument — somewhat like the English postposition outside in he went outside the house and he went outside — and (2) they can combine with an ad-

§14.4.8 §14.4.9

There is evidence that many of these postpositions come from nouns and specifically from the class of e-nouns (which refer to parts of entities). Let us first recall that e-nouns require a prefix formative e- which is normally lost when the noun is modified by a juxtaposed noun the precedes them; e.g., waka ‘cow’ + e-rami ‘flesh’ = waka rami ‘cow flesh’; Diata ‘Biata river’ + e-kike ‘forest’ = Diata kike ‘forest of the Biata river’ (see §12.3.1 and §13.1.1). Enouns, whether they are modified by a juxtaposed noun or not, require an oblique postpositional marker when they occur in an oblique function. Thus compare -kike ‘forest’ in core (CS) function in (14.86a) and in oblique (locative) function in (14.86b) (repeated from (14.28b)) and (14.86c); in this latter example, -kike is also modified by a juxtaposed noun.

enter-GO.TEMP-SS

‘Entering the forest of the Biata river (he encountered an anteater).’ na005a

Keeping this in mind, we can give a likely explanation for the development of a number of the postpositions listed in (14.85).
The three postpositions repeated in (14.87) are attested as heads of core NPs. Similarly to e-nouns, they take an e prefix when they are not modified by a juxtaposed noun, as in (a.) and b., but lack this prefix when they are modified by a juxtaposed noun, as in (c.).

(14.87) a. e-tsekwe=kwana ‘the outside areas (were in bad conditions)’

(14.98)

b. e-kwe e-tsuku ‘(I looked at) my hip’

(14.106)

c. Biata jiruru ‘the banks of the Biata river (are clean)’

(14.113)

The rest of the postpositions have not been found in core functions in the data but this does not preclude that (at least some) can. Nevertheless, even when used in oblique function, the morpho-syntactic behavior of some is very similar to that of e-nouns.
The two postpositions tsekwe and jiruru (plus another one, =duku ‘INSIDE’) have the same behavior regarding the e- prefix formative when used as obliques; when they have an argument, they do not take an e prefix formative, as in (14.88a); when they do not have an argument, they take an e prefix formative, as in (14.88b) and (14.88c). Note that, tibene ‘BEHIND’ and tsuku ‘AT.CORNER.OF’, discussed in (14.90) below, behave similarly.

(14.88) a. punchu=duku ‘(we put our load) inside the poncho’ (14.96a)

escuela tsekwe ‘(I arrived) outside of the school’ (14.96b)

bei jiruru

‘(the caiman is lying) on the banks’ (14.111a)

c. e-jiruru=keja ‘(the boat is getting closer) to the banks’ (14.111b)

These postpositions do not require an additional postposition when they have an argument, as in (a.) They do however require an additional postposition when they do not have an argument, as in (b.) and c. The postposition =ju ‘LOC’ in this case does not carry any meaning and can be seen as a default postposition. Otherwise, the postpositions =keja ‘LOC.GNL’ or =eke ‘PERL’ can substitute =ju, as in (c.), and do carry their normal meanings (general location or perlative meanings, respectively). The fact that these five forms require an additional postposition when they themselves do not take an argument is likely the remains of their original nominal status.
The postposition emake ‘under’ differs from the preceding postpositions in that it does not obligatorily require =ju ‘LOC’ when not taking an argument as shown in (14.89b).

(14.89) a. pere emake ‘(I put my bag) under the raft.’

b. emake

‘(We on the plane went) down…’

c. emake=eke ‘(the bridge was rotten) underneath’

(14.91b) (14.93) (14.95)

Note also that emake begins with an e vowel. However, in this case, the vowel remains in all contexts, even when the postposition takes an argument, as in (14.89a). The vowel e in emake must therefore be treated as part of the root. It is also not clear whether or not it is same e that shows up in e-nouns (and in the preceding postpositions).
The postpositions tibene ‘behind’ and tsuku ‘at the corner of’ in (14.90) below are similar to duku, tsekwe and jiruru in that they have an analyzable e prefix formative. However, when not taking an argument, they are only attested with the postposition =keja and =eke, as in (b.) More data is necessary to determine whether they can take =ju ‘LOC’ or not in this context.

(14.90) a. cajón tibene ‘(the plank is) behind the box’

(14.99a)

e-tare tsuku ‘(I went to urinate) at the corner of the house’

(14.104)

b. e-tibene=keja ‘(they pulled him) behind’

(14.103)

e-tsuku=eke ‘(we make a hole) through both corners’ (14.105)

552 14. Postpositions
The remaining postpositions share the following morpho-syntactic properties:
1 — the never take an e prefix; 2 — they can be marked by =keja ‘LOC.GNL’ and =eke ‘PERL’ but not by =ju ‘LOC’.
The following remarks can be made for each of these postpositions:
1 — the postpositions dyake ‘ON’ and idyake ‘ABOVE’ are almost certainly related;4 2 — the postposition patya/patyapatya ‘IN.MIDDLE.OF’ is probably a borrowing from Aymara or Quechua (see §14.4.8); 3 — the postposition japadama ‘CLOSE.TO’ clearly comes from the adjective japa- ‘far’ negated by the suffix -dama ‘NEG’ (§11.2.4); 4 — the postposition pijidyane ‘CLOSE.TO’ probably comes from the lexicalized combination of the diminutive particle =piji (§17.2.11) and the approximative particle =dyane (§17.2.8); 5 — the postposition peke ‘AT.SIDE.OF’ probably originated in the transitive verb peke- ‘carry O on one’s side’; see an example of this verb (14.109); 6 — the postposition tupuju ‘FOLLOWING’ probably comes from the lexicalized collocation of the two postpositions =tupu ‘UP.TO’ (§14.2.6) and =ju ‘LOC’ (§14.2.3); 7 — the postposition yueketibene ‘FARTHER.BEHIND’ is a lexicalized combination of the perlative pro-form yu-eke ‘over.there-PERL’ and the postposition tibene ‘BEHIND’ from (14.90).
Table 14.8 summarizes the properties and postulated origin of the all postpositions with an optional argument. Question marks indicate that the information is unknown.
4 One can speculate whether they could have originated in an e-noun, like many other of the postpositions discussed here. As such, the word-initial i of idyake could be the e prefix formative; recall that, at least with one other e-noun, -nime ‘thought’, the eprefix is realized as i- (§12.3.1.3). Note however that neither dyake or idyake can be used as nouns synchronically. Alternatively, these two postpositions might be related to the independent intensifying particle dyake ‘very’ (§11.1.2, §16.1).

554 14. Postpositions
In the following sections, I further discuss and illustrate each of these postpositions, grouped by antonymic pairs where possible.

14.4.2. dyake ‘ON’, idyake ‘ABOVE’, and emake ‘UNDER’

Cavineña has terms corresponding to both concepts of ‘on’ and ‘under’: dyake ‘ON’, illustrated in (14.91a), and emake ‘UNDER’, illustrated in (14.91b).

‘I tied (lit. tied the neck of) the bag (with all my belongings in it) and put it under the raft (to suspend the raft as I crossed the river).’ mj055

A few examples are available of a postposition idyake with a meaning very close to that of dyake. According to speakers, the difference between dyake and idyake is that with the first, there is a direct physical contact between the figure and the ground whereas there is no such contact with idyake. This could roughly correspond to the difference in English between ‘on’ and ‘above’. The pair in (14.92) was proposed by Antonio Yubanera as an illustration:

(14.92) a. mesa dyake table ON
‘(something) on top (and touching) the table’

b. mesa idyake table ABOVE
‘(something) above (and not touching or not touching directly) the table’ n4.0336

14.4. Postpositions with an optional argument 555

The postposition emake can be used without an argument, as shown in (14.93).

The postposition dyake (and presumably emake as well, see below) can be combined with an additional postposition, as with =eke ‘PERL’ in (14.94).

14.4.3. =duku ‘INSIDE’ and tsekwe ‘OUTSIDE’

The concepts ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ are expressed, respectively, by the postpositions =duku, as in (14.96a), and tsekwe, as in (14.96b).

b. … [escuela tsekwe] ju-nati… school OUTSIDE be-GO.TEMP
‘… (when) I arrived near (lit. outside of) the school (I was frightened by the schoolteacher).’ es019

Both postpositions =duku ‘INSIDE’ and tsekwe ‘OUTSIDE’, when not taking an argument, show up with a vowel e and obligatorily require the postposition =ju (or =keja or =eke), as in (14.97).

(14.97) a. Ikwene=dya =tuS

NPF-fire AT.EDGE.OF

‘Mrs Felicia and Mrs Mati sat outside (of the house), next to the fire (to toast manioc).’ md002

The origin of tsekwe ‘OUTSIDE’ is clear. It is the e-noun -tsekwe, which refers to the outside area of a house that is kept cleaned from the constantly invading forest. This noun is illustrated in (14.98), where it is the head of an NP in CS function and marked with the plural enclitic =kwana.

14.4.4. tibene ‘BEHIND’, yueketibene ‘FURTHER.BEHIND’, and tupuju ‘FOLLOWING’
Three postpositions express the concept ‘behind’: tibene ‘(statically) behind’, illustrated in (14.99a), yueketibene ‘(statically) farther behind’, illustrated in

14.4. Postpositions with an optional argument 557

(14.99b), and tupuju ‘(dynamically) behind, following’, illustrated in (14.99c). Note that in this example, tupuju appears twice, once with an argument and once without an argument.

(14.99) a. A: Eju=kwitaCC =tu-keCS? INT:LOC=RESTR =3SG-FM

B: [Cajón tibene]CC =tu-keCS. box BEHIND =3SG-FM

kwa-wa… go-PERF

‘I followed (lit. went following) my wife (who had gone to her father’s house). I went behind…’ ju024

Another example with tupuju can be found in (14.2b) above. Note that there is no postposition attested for the concept ‘in front of’. There
are several terms expressing this concept (or related concepts) but they are not postpositions, such as the independent particle ikwene(ta) ‘first, in front’ or the noun eketi ‘the face, the front’.
The two postpositions tibene and yueketibene are obviously related, yueketibene being made of tibene preceded by the perlative far-from-speaker-farfrom-addressee demonstrative yu-eke ‘over.there-PERL’; see an example in (14.61c) above and a discussion of this demonstrative in §15.7.
The postposition tibene has a temporal meaning when it marks the independent particles metajudya ‘tomorrow’ and riyabarepa ‘yesterday’ (§16.1), yielding the expressions metajudya tibene ‘the day after tomorrow’ and riyabarepa tibene ‘the day before yesterday’, illustrated in (14.100).

Another example is (T1.9). As for the postposition tibene the closest I have of a usage without an argu-
ment is either with the specific temporal meaning ‘the day before yesterday’, as in (14.101), or with an e vowel, i.e., etibene, and an additional postposition, as in (14.103).

When used without an argument, tsuku requires a vowel e and an additional postposition, as in (14.105).

‘(Then we make the tail of the basket.) After that, we (dl) make a hole through both corners (and we insert the tail inside the holes).’ ab070

This postposition is clearly related to the e-noun -tsuku ‘hip, corner’. This noun is illustrated in (14.106), where it is the head of an NP in O function.

In one example, however, jiruru is used with fire, in e-tiki jiruru ‘next to the fire’ in (14.97b) above.
When jiruru is used without an argument, it must take a vowel e and an additional postposition, as in (14.111).

Patya, unlike all other postpositions, is found (fully) reduplicated. From the examples available, both patya and patyapatya, appear to be identical semantically as well as morpho-syntactically, but more work might reveal some differences. An example of patyapatya is given in (14.115).

The origin of both postpositions is quite transparent: pijidyane is made of the diminutive particle =piji and the approximative particle =dyane; japadama corresponds to the negated version of the predicative adjective japa- ‘far’. Note that only the negated version of japa- is used as a postposition in the available data, i.e., with an argument.
Japadama is attested without an argument, which might be simply interpreted as an ‘adverbial’ use of the adjective japa- (see §11.1.4). Pijidyane on the other hand is never used this way.

Chapter 15 Pronouns and demonstratives
In this chapter, I discuss pronouns and demonstratives. Pronouns refer to entities (people, animals, plants, or things) while demonstratives refer to places.
There are two major types of pronouns in Cavineña: independent pronouns (§15.1) and bound pronouns (§15.2). Both have essentially the same segmental make-up: they encode person, number and case with the same roots and suffixes; they both include a set of third person proximate pronouns (in addition to a set of distance-neutral third person pronouns). However, independent and bound pronouns have very different morpho-syntactic properties. Independent pronouns are phonologically and grammatically independent words that fill core NP or PP slots. Bound pronouns are enclitics (grammatically independent but phonologically bound) in second position in a clause. Bound pronouns undergo a number of morphological modifications not attested with independent pronouns. They only occur in certain types of clauses.
A bound pronoun can co-occur with an independent pronoun (or an NP) encoding the same function in the same clause. This is discussed in §15.3.
Singular third person pronouns can refer to non-singular referents. This is discussed in §15.4.
Two morphemes, ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘3PL’ strongly resemble independent pronouns but have a number of idiosyncratic properties. They are treated separately under §15.6.
Cavineña has two types of demonstratives: adverbial demonstratives (§15.7) and pointing demonstratives (§15.8) — note that Cavineña does not have specific demonstratives functioning within NPs. Both types encode three degrees of distance ‘near’ vs. ‘mid’ vs. ‘far’. Adverbial demonstratives can be used instead of locative, general locative and perlative postpositional phrases. They are always anaphoric in nature. Pointing demonstratives, do not substitute for any particular postpositional phrase. They are not used anaphorically; their role is to draw the attention to a new location. As such, they normally require a pointing gesture (whereas this is optional with adverbial demonstratives).
15.1. Independent pronouns
Independent pronouns fill NP or PP slots. They refer to entities (people, animals, plants, or things) but not locations. They encode the categories of person, number, case and distance (for third person).

566 15. Pronouns and demonstratives

15.1.1. Syntax

Independent pronouns have the following syntactic properties:
1 — independent pronouns fill core NP slots or PP slots.1 Examples showing a first person singular pronoun filling NP slots in core function within a main clause are given in (15.1).

568 15. Pronouns and demonstratives

2 — Independent pronouns typically come first in main clauses, as can be seen in the previous examples, — this correlates with the fact that independent pronouns are essentially used for contrast — but this is not a requirement. Similar to NPs and PPs, independent pronouns can potentially occur anywhere in a clause, as with e-ra ‘1SG-ERG’ in (15.5).

3 — Independent pronouns make up a whole NP or PP by themselves: they are heads on their own; they cannot take any NP modifiers (e.g., a quantifier, an juxtaposed noun, an attributive adjective, etc.). Independent pronouns can be marked for number or case, but this is done by specific affixes on the pronoun roots, not by regular NP modifiers.

15.1.2. Morphology
There are seven sets of independent pronouns, according to the function they play in a clause:
1 — absolutive (unmarked) pronouns fill an S/CS2 and O NP slot; they can presumably also fill a CC slot, although no example could be found in the data; 2 — ergative pronouns fill a A NP slot; 3 — dative pronouns fill a dative PP slot (§14.2.2); 4 — genitive pronouns fill a genitive PP slot (§13.4);3 5 — associative pronouns fill an associative PP slot (§14.2.1); 6 — general locative pronouns fill a general locative PP slot (§14.2.3); 7 — ‘alone’ pronouns fill an ‘alone’ PP slot (§14.3.4).

2 S and CS independent (as well as bound) pronouns are morpho-syntactially identical. 3 Recall that genitive and dative independent pronouns are homophonous. See §14.2.2.3
for a discussion of the semantic and syntactic differences between them.

15.1. Independent pronouns 569

The seven sets of independent pronouns are given in Table 15.1. Note that dative and genitive pronouns are listed together. A question mark ‘?’ means that the forms were not attested in the data but could logically exist.

Cavineña pronouns have a synthetic and essentially agglutinative structure. We can recognize pronominal roots, which encode simultaneously person and, for third person forms, two degrees of distance, and 2 layers of suffixes, one for number and one for case. The morphological structure of the pronominal forms is ROOT-NUM-CASE. Cavineña does not encode any inclusive versus exclusive distinction, although this distinction, or a related one, is found in the pronominal systems of other Tacanan languages, such as Araona in (Pitman 1980: 82; Emkow 2006: 259) and Tacana in (Van Wynen y Van Wynen 1962: 200).

570 15. Pronouns and demonstratives
Pronoun components show some degree of allomorphy; that is, some of their components show up in various forms. The choice of the forms is conditioned by their morphological environment rather than by phonological rules.
The details of the morphological structure of independent pronouns are given below.

15.1.2.1. Pronominal roots

The root encodes person and 2 degrees of distance (in third person) as shown in (15.6).

(15.6)

e/i/ya/ea mi/me/mia tu/ta/tua
ri/re/riya

‘first person’ (speaker) ‘second person’ (addressee) ‘third person distance-neutral’ (neither speaker nor
addressee) ‘third person proximate’ (neither speaker nor ad-
dressee)

Non-singular roots are the most regular. There is a set of dual roots (ya, me, ta, re) and a set of plural roots (e, mi, tu, re), as summarized in Table 15.2.

-Ø

‘SG’

-tse

‘DL’

-kwana/-na ‘PL’

As we can see, there are two variants for plural, -kwana and -na. The suffix -kwana is selected by first and second persons. The suffix -na is selected by third persons. This is summarized in Table 15.4.

Note that -kwana is homophonous with the plural number enclitic marker =kwana ‘PL’ (slot G of NP structure; see §13.3). As for the suffixes -tse and -na, apart from also occurring within the pronominal-like morphemes ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘PL’ (§15.6), they do not occur anywhere else in the language.

As we can see dative/genitive case suffixes are irregular. They are realized as -kwe with singular first and second persons5 and as -ja with all other persons

4 Note that I use the term ‘case’ in a broad sense, including ‘alone’ suffixes, which ex-
press the manner in which an action is performed. 5 When singular first or second person dative pronouns are followed by the ligature
marker =ke (as a means to express the concepts of ‘mine’ or ‘yours’), the suffix -kwe
undergoes an idiosyncratic phonological change that turns it into -kwi; see examples

572 15. Pronouns and demonstratives

and numbers. For an illustration of independent pronouns marked by -kwe, see (15.2b),
with a first person singular dative pronoun, and (15.3) with a first person singular genitive pronoun. For examples of pronouns marked by -ja, see (15.5b), with a third person singular genitive pronoun.
The distribution of -kwe and -ja is summarized in Table 15.5.

This could suggest a unitary analysis where both pronominal case and postpositions represent a single category. In this study, I have preferred to treat them as distinct, on the basis that: (1) different case suffixes often require different stems (at least with singular pronouns), whereas this never happens with postpositions, and (2) some pronominal cases suffixes have variants that are not found with postpositions (as with first and second person singular dative/genitive suffix -kwe and singular ‘alone’ suffixes -ta and -tataka).

15.1.2.4. Suffix -ke ‘FM’

A suffix -ke occurs with absolutive (S/O) singular (but not dual and plural) pronouns. Because of the highly restricted distribution of this morpheme, I have decided to analyze it as a formative, but an analysis in terms of an absolutive suffix could be a possible alternative.
The suffix -ke drops when these pronouns take the focus particle =dya (§17.2.3), as in (15.11).

15.2. Bound pronouns

In addition to independent pronouns, Cavineña has second position bound pronouns — recall that Cavineña also has possessor person marking in kinship nouns; these are discussed in §12.4.2. Independent and bound pronouns have basically the same segmental make-up but quite different morpho-syntactic and prosodic properties. Note that the distinction between independent and bound pronouns was not made in earlier work on Cavineña — Camp and Liccardi (1977, 1983, 1989) and Camp (1985).

15.2.1. Syntax

Bound pronouns have the following syntactic properties:

1 — they have a fixed position in the clause. Together with second position particles (§16.3), bound pronouns are enclitics to the last phonological word of the first immediate constituent of a main clause. Bound pronouns obligatorily follow second position particles (when these are present) as shown in (15.12).

Co-occurring pronouns are ordered according to a person hierarchy whereby third person precedes first and/or second person, and second precedes first person. This is discussed at length in §15.2.3.

576 15. Pronouns and demonstratives
3 — bound pronouns only occur in certain types of clauses:
(1) main declarative affirmative (verbal or copula) clauses, as in (15.12a,b.c); see §4.6.1 and §4.6.3 for a discussion of these types of clauses; (2) main declarative negative (verbal or copula) clauses, as in (15.1a), (15.4), (15.52), etc.; see §4.6.6 for a discussion of these types of clauses; (3) main non-declarative interrogative (verbal or copula) clauses, as in (15.1c), (15.19b,c), (15.23b), etc.; see §4.6.5 for a discussion of these types of clauses).
Bound pronouns do not occur in the following types of clauses:
(1) main non-declarative imperative and hortative clauses; see §4.6.4 and §6.2 for a discussion of these types of clauses; (2) subordinate clauses; see Chapters 18, 19 and 20 for a discussion of these types of clauses.

15.2.2. Morphology

There are three sets of bound pronouns, according to the function they play in a clause:

1 — absolutive (unmarked) bound pronouns refer to an argument in core S/CS or O function; 2 — ergative bound pronouns refer to an argument in core A function; 3 — dative bound pronouns refer to a participant in oblique DAT function.

The three sets of bound pronouns are given in Table 15.7. The three sets of bound pronouns are almost identical in form to their corre-
sponding sets of independent pronouns. The only difference concerns third person proximate singular roots: with independent pronouns, there is a single root riya for all the sets; with bound pronouns, the root is alternatively ri for the absolutive set, re for the dative set, and riya for the ergative set. Note that there is no attested singular ergative proximate bound pronoun in the whole corpus of texts; however, the form =riya-ra, which is identical to the singular ergative proximate independent pronoun, was elicited from Francisco Vaca in:

Although bound pronouns have, to a large extent, the same form as independent pronouns, they undergo quite different morphological processes, as follows:

1 — the formative suffix -ke (of singular absolutive bound pronouns) and the ergative suffix -ra (in ergative bound pronouns) are deleted when singular absolutive or ergative pronouns occur last or alone in the second position clitic sequence (unless they are also last in the sentence; see below). Examples showing the deletion of -ke ‘FM’ with O singular bound pronouns are given in (15.15).

It is worth noting (at least) two instances where the deletion rule, as set in 1 to 3 above does not apply. As far as I can say, in both cases, this appears to be simply the case of ‘mistakes’ on the part of some speakers. For example, I observed that young Cavineña children often do not drop -ke or -ra when they would normally be dropped. A typical question children ask me when they come to visit is ‘what are you doing?’. The normal way of asking this is (15.28a), where -ke from the second person singular O bound pronoun is dropped, since it occurs last in second position. However, I have often heard (15.28b).

When I asked Antonio Yubanera about this way of talking, he immediately identified it as children’s talk.

15.2. Bound pronouns 583

I have also observed that some young adult speakers, with whom I have conducted elicitation and/or transcription work, such as Francisco Vaca or Emerenciano Sepa, do sometimes get confused about when -ke or -ra should be dropped or retained. For example, this was noted while transcribing recorded texts where they wrongly reproduced or wanted to correct (‘mistakenly’ using -ke or -ra) what was heard on the tape. For example, when one listens to (15.29) on the tape, it is clear that Victoria Tavo (the author of the text) drops the ergative suffix -ra from A bound pronoun =yatse ‘1DL’ (as expected). However, when asked to repeat the sentence (during transcription), Emerenciano Sepa said the abnormal form =yatse-ra.

‘We (dl) are going to go and drop (lit. lower (from the cart)) him (the linguist) there.’ ka491

Such cases are not really problematic for my analysis: the failure to apply the deletion rule is clearly the result of the imperfect learning of the language in the first case while it is likely to be the effect of unnatural elicitation/transcription sessions in the second case.

15.2.3. Principles of bound pronoun ordering

Co-occurring bound pronouns have strict ordering restrictions which depend on their ranking on the following person hierarchy: 1 > 2 > 3.8 The lower a bound pronoun is on the hierarchy scale, the earlier it occurs in the string, regardless of its grammatical function. In other words, third person precedes first and/or second person, and second precedes first person. Examples (15.30) and (15.19a) (repeated) show that a third person bound pronoun, whether in A or O function, precedes a first person bound pronoun, whether in A or O function.

Note that a third person A cannot co-occur with a third person O; see §15.2.4.

15.2.4. Co-occurrence restrictions

Table 15.8 summarizes all attested combinations of bound pronouns. The numbers following the A, O, S and DAT refer to person. A question mark ‘?’ means that the combination is logically possible but not attested. Unattested combinations considered grammatically impossible are coded by dark shaded cells. The symbol ‘REF’ refers to combinations that result in the verb taking reflexive morphology and being detransitivized (§8.2).
There are restrictions on combining A and O bound pronouns: an A bound pronoun cannot co-occur with an O bound pronoun that is non-singular and lower on the hierarchy scale. This can be illustrated with the following minimal pair involving a first person A bound pronoun. Example (15.35a) is grammatical because the O bound pronoun is third person singular. However, (15.35b) is ungrammatical because the O bound pronoun is third person non-singular.

thus =3PL =1DL(-ERG) see-GO.TEMP-REM.PAST

n5.0176

Note however that, as the translation of (15.35a) shows, the referent of the O bound pronoun is plural in this example. There are at least three possible explanations for this phenomenon: the first is that the plural referent of the third person O could be understood in a collective sense here; the second is that this could simply be a reflection of the fact that in Cavineña, number is not obligatorily marked for third person referents (see §15.4); the third is that in these particular combinations, the number of the third person O referent might be neutralized. More work is needed on this issue.

Note that if the higher ranking A argument is realized by an independent pronoun, then it is perfectly grammatical to encode a lower ranking O plural argument by a plural bound pronoun, as in (15.36), or a full NP (for the O argument).

To summarize, the only possible combinations of A and O bound pronouns are (15.37a), where the A co-occurs with a singular O lower in hierarchy, and (15.37b), where the A co-occurs with an O of any number higher in hierarchy, but not (15.37c), where the A co-occurs with non-singular O lower in hierarchy.

Note that it is still possible to express two third person arguments (A and O) at the same time but this needs to be done by expressing at least one of these arguments with an independent pronouns, as in (15.39b), or with a full NP. — a third person DAT, either 3 or 3PROX, and of any number, can never cooccur with a third person A, either 3 or 3PROX, and of any number. It can only co-occur with a third person S/O which (1) must be singular and (2) must be of the same ‘distance’ type, i.e., DAT3 / S3 or O3 (sg), or DAT3PROX / S3PROX or O3PROX (sg), but not *DAT3PROX / S3 or O3 (sg), or *DAT3 / SO3 or O3PROX (sg).

The two Os of ditransitive verbs (§5.2.1) cannot co-occur as bound pronouns. The single O bound pronoun can be either of the two Os, i.e., either message or ‘communicatee’ with kweja- ‘inform’, either recipient or gift with tya‘give’, etc. In (15.42a), with the verb kweja- ‘inform’, the O bound pronoun refers to the third person message — the second person, the ‘communicatee’, is expressed by an independent pronoun —, while in (15.42b), the O bound pronoun refers to the (second person) ‘communicatee’ — the third person message is expressed by an NP.

15.3. Bound pronouns vs. independent pronouns/NPs
Ergative, absolutive and dative functions can logically be encoded by independent pronouns/NPs or bound pronouns, or by both at the same time, or by no marking at all. The purpose of this section is to discuss how each of these three functions are formally expressed in Cavineña. The functional motivations for choosing one means over the other require further study.

15.3.1. A function

Ergative function can be expressed by:

1 — an independent pronoun/full NP or; 2 — a bound pronoun or; 3 — a bound pronoun co-occurring with an independent pronoun/NP (with some restrictions; see below).

Ergative function is obligatorily expressed for all person and number (but see below for a discussion of some examples that could contradict this statement).
The three different encoding possibilities for ergative function are illustrated in turn below.

1 — Examples showing function A only expressed by an independent pronoun can be seen in (15.1a), (15.5a), (15.15b) and (15.21b).
Function A only expressed by a full NP can be seen in (15.3) and (15.21a), with the A NP preposed to the verb, and (15.43a), with the A NP postposed to the verb.

See also (15.1c), (15.4) and (15.15a). 3 — Examples showing function A expressed by a bound pronoun co-occurring with an independent pronoun/NP are rare but nevertheless attested. When this happens, the independent pronoun/NP always occurs postposed to the verb (unless the A NP is headless; see below).
Examples of A bound pronouns co-occurring with A NPs (postposed to the verb) are given in (15.45) and (15.19d) (repeated).

Headless A NPs appear to be an exception to the statement that an A NP co-occurring with a bound pronoun in A function always occurs postposed to the verb. In a few examples a headless NP occurs preposed to the verb and cooccurs with an A bound pronoun. This can be seen in (15.47a), with a headless verbal relative clause, (15.47b), with a headless quantifier, and (15.47c), with a headless copula relative clause.

I stated that A function is obligatorily expressed for all person and number. However, the examples in (15.48) possibly contradict this statement in that here, as I will argue, the absence of overt marking for the first person singular A argument cannot be interpreted as a zero marker.

One could argue that in these examples, first person singular A is a Ømarked bound pronoun. However, this is not a satisfactory analysis because the two combinations of bound pronouns, A1 / O2 (non-singular) and A1 / O3 (non-singular), are not allowed (see §15.2.4). These examples could suggest that, at least in the contexts where A and O bound pronouns cannot co-occcur, a first person singular A does not have to receive any encoding.

15.3.2. S/O function

Absolutive function can be expressed by:

1 — an independent pronoun/full NP or; 2 — a bound pronoun or; 3 — a bound pronoun co-occurring with an independent pronoun/NP (without any of the restrictions that apply when encoding the A function in that situation; see previous section) or; 4 — nothing, if the S/O argument is a third person singular.

The four different possibilities for encoding the O function are illustrated in turn below:

Note that example (15.53a), for example, is identical to (15.3) in term of encoding, but has a third person singular O.

It might be argued that in these examples, there is no (underlying) O argument (whose identity would have to be retrieved from context) and that the verbs refer to activities (‘eating’ and ‘waiting’). This does not appear to be the case for at least two reasons. First, both clauses remain fully transitive. In (15.53a), for example, we have an A NP encoded with the ergative case =ra ‘ERG’. Second, decreasing the valency of a verb in Cavineña can only be achieved by overt derivations. That is, demoting the O argument would require an antipassive derivation, which involves the full reduplication of the verb root (see §8.3.1). Third, the context implies a specific O reading.
Note that (15.53a) is potentially ambiguous. In this example, the O argument could equally be a first person singular, since a first person singular O bound pronoun occurring last or alone in second position is =Ø; compare this example with (15.3) which overtly receives the exact same encoding but has a first person singular O. However, from the context, it is clear that this is not the case. Sentence (15.53a) follows a stretch of discourse which refers to the cooking of a wild turkey so it is clear that the turkey (third person) is the O (and not the speaker). In addition, a first person can hardly be the O of the verb ara- ‘eat’ unless it occurred in a very particular and marked context. See below for another ambiguity situation between first and third person singular S arguments.

Here the first person singular reading was given by the Spanish translation. 3 — Examples showing S bound pronouns co-occurring with S NPs are given in (15.56a), with the S NP preposed to the verb, and (15.56b), with the S NP postposed to the verb.

15.3. Bound pronouns vs. independent pronouns/NPs 603
I mentioned earlier that this example could be interpreted as having a first person singular reading; in terms of core argument encoding, it is identical to (15.55) and (15.22c), which have a first person singular S. In the context of (15.58b), the action of ‘going to the pampa’ only makes sense if it refers to the anteater because we have been told earlier that if the anteater remains in the forest, the hunter (first person) cannot kill it.
It could be argued that, similarly to first person singular S/O or first person singular A, the absence of third person marking corresponds to an underlying Ø-marked third person singular bound pronoun. This does not appear to be a satisfactory analysis for the reason that there is no positive evidence of any such underlying pronoun. This is quite unlike the Ø-marking that characterizes first person singular S/O or first person singular A bound pronouns; recall that these bound pronouns do surface when (1) they are followed by another bound pronoun in the second position clitic chain, as with those marking O in (15.16), S in (15.18a,b), and A in (15.20a,b), or when they occur last or alone in the sentence, as with those marking O in (15.24), S in (15.25), and A in (15.26).

15.3.3. DAT function

Dative function can be expressed by:

1 — an independent pronoun/NP or; 2 — a bound pronoun.

No example could be found of a DAT bound pronoun co-occurring with a DAT independent pronoun/NP.
The two different possibilities for encoding the dative function are illustrated below:

1 — DAT function only expressed by an independent pronoun is illustrated in (15.2b).
DAT function only expressed by a full NP is illustrated in (15.59).

15.4. Number

It was noted that third person singular pronouns, whether distance-neutral or proximate, and whether bound or independent, can refer to plural referents. As far as I can say, this never happens with first or second person pronouns.
The example (15.60) shows a third person singular independent pronoun in A function referring to ‘mosquitoes’.

This parallels the fact that number is not an obligatory category of the noun phrase in Cavineña; that is, the absence of the non-singular markers, =ekatse ‘DL’ or =kwana ‘PL’, in an NP does not necessarily imply that the referent is

15.5. Third person proximate pronouns 605
singular (see §13.3.2). Alternatively, it could be the case that in these examples, third person singular pronouns refer to a collective, non-individuated, referent, i.e., ‘the group of mosquitoes’ in (15.60) and ‘the group of Araonas’ in (15.61).

15.5. Third person proximate pronouns

Third person proximate (bound and independent) pronouns are a fascinating aspect of the Cavineña pronominal system. Their function is unfortunately not yet fully understood. In this section, I show that (at least part of) their meaning is to make reference to entities which are spatially close to the speaker at the time of speech. They contrast with third person distance-neutral pronouns which do not specify any distance.
The examples (15.62) and (15.63) come from a story where Alfredo Tavo relates a visit he paid to a Pacahuara family in their own house. At this point of the story, he tells the Pacahuara man the names of what he sees in the house in Cavineña. There is first an owl sitting very close to him (i.e., Alfredo) so he points to it and says (15.62), using a third person proximate pronoun cooccurring with a headless (near-speaker) demonstrative relative clause in CS function.

‘In my (Cavineña) language (lit. tongue), this (owl) is (called) “pupu” (i.e., owl).’ pa066

Then, there is a motmot (bird) which is located away from both Alfredo Tavo (and away from the Pacahuara man). Alfredo points to it and says (15.63), using a third person (non-proximate) bound pronoun co-occurring with a headless (away from speaker-and-addressee) demonstrative relative clause in CS function.

Example (15.64) comes from a recorded conversation between Cavineña men doing community work. At some point, they ask me the price of the taperecorder (which is sitting between them). I tell them that it is very expensive. Vidal Mayo hasn’t heard me so Carmelo Camaconi repeats what I said, using a third person proximate bound pronoun co-occurring with a headless (near-

The first evening of my stay in Misión Cavinas, I was talking with Lucas Tavo. As I was commenting on the extraordinary amount of mosquitoes, he said (15.65a), confirming my observation. When I asked Lucas why he didn’t say (15.65b) — i.e., using the distance-neutral bound pronoun —, he replied that this would have meant that he was referring to mosquitoes of a different place (i.e., not of Misión Cavinas).

‘(You are right), there are many mosquitoes here!’

b. Uma-daCC =tu-keCS! many-ASF =3SG-FM
‘There are many mosquito there.’ n5.0004

In (15.66), Victoria Tavo and her daughter have been traveling an entire day with an ox-cart to fetch me in Baqueti, a nearby community. When they arrive at Baqueti, they cannot find me. Victoria says to herself:

In a story, Alfredo Tavo relates how in the olden days, their enemies had once ambushed and killed one of their (Cavineña) women. They had cut off her breasts and the flesh of her legs to give it to the old women, back in their village. As narrated by Alfredo, the one who was carrying the breasts and the flesh was repeating (15.67) joyfully. As we can see, Alfredo uses a third person proximate bound pronoun in O function to refer to the flesh and the breasts.

‘I’m taking (there, to our village) what my grandmother likes very much (lit. what is very desirable to my grandmother).’ vz094

Similarly, in (15.15b), the O bound pronoun =ri ‘3PROX(-FM)’ refers to a wild turkey that the speaker is holding.
One might want to suggest that Cavineña third person proximate pronouns could be part of an obviation-type of system, as found, for example, in Algonquian languages. Those languages have two different third person pronouns used to help track third person referents in ambiguous A3/O3 function/person combinations. The ‘proximate’ pronoun makes reference to the most topical referent. The ‘obviative’ pronoun makes reference to the less topical referent (Payne 1997: 212). However, this does not seem to be the case in Cavineña. As far as I can say, the distinction between third person proximate and distanceneutral third person pronouns in this language does not have to do with discourse topicality but spatial distance.

15.6. Ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘3PL’

There are two curious pronominal-like morphemes: ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘3PL’. The two forms consist of a root, eka ‘3’, followed by one of two suffixes: -tse ‘DL’ and -na ‘PL’. Note that the two suffixes are also found in the bona fide independent and bound pronouns (§15.1.2 and §15.2.2). As for the root, eka, one can speculate whether it could be related to the noun deka ‘male’.
Ekatse and ekana are very commonly used. They first appear to function as independent pronouns referring to S/O arguments. However, as we will see, there are a number of differences.
The examples in (15.68) and (15.69) illustrate ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘3PL’, respectively.

Ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘3PL’ share the following morpho-syntactic properties with independent nouns (but not with bound pronouns):

1 — they do not have a rigid position in the clause as shown by (15.69a,b), (15.71b) and (15.74); 2 — they can co-occur with bound pronouns referring to the same referent in the same clause, as can be seen in (15.70), with a referent in S function, and (15.71), with a referent in O function.

However, there are at least three main differences between ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘3PL’ and independent pronouns:

1 — they can co-occur with (at least) S/O NPs. Examples showing ekatse and ekana co-occurring with S NPs are shown in (15.74).

2 — they never take phrasal particles (Chapter 17); 3 — they normally do not occur first in a clause — (15.69a) being a rare exception — whereas this position is the preferred one for independent pronouns.

These observations suggest that ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘3PL’, unlike independent pronouns, do not fill NP slot. Although these two morphemes are semantically associated with core arguments (S/O), they might function as adverbial/peripheral elements, similarly to independent particles (§16.1). Yet, there are differences between the two. For example, unlike independent particles, ekatse and ekana cannot be modified by phrasal particles. Therefore, the exact nature of these two morphemes will have to remain open at the present stage.
Note that ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘3PL’ are formally identical to the dual and plural number markers =ekatse ‘DL’ and =ekana ‘PL’ (§13.3). One could analyze them as being the same morphemes. This is not a satisfactory analysis, at least synchronically, for the following reasons:

15.7. Adverbial demonstratives 611
1 — the number markers only occur within an NP and with a rigid position (slot G). By contrast, ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘3PL’ function at the clause level and with no rigid position; 2 — the number markers cannot occur without an overtly expressed NP head. By contrast, ekatse ‘3DL’ and ekana ‘3PL’ can occur even though the entity they refer to is not overtly expressed, as in many of the examples given above; 3 — the number marker =ekana can only modify kinship terms possessed by a first or second person. By contrast, the morpheme ekana can refer to entities which are not possessed by a first or second person; in (15.72), for example, the family of Cavineñas referred to by ekana is hardly interpretable as being possessed by the speaker, i.e., the missionary lady.

15.7. Adverbial demonstratives

Adverbial demonstratives refer to locations (unlike pronouns which refer to entities). They consist of three sets: locative, general locative and perlative, as given in Table 15.10.

There are four demonstrative roots which express three degrees of distance as shown in (15.76).

(15.76)

re- or jeetuyu-

‘here, near speaker’ ‘there, near or familiar to addressee’ ‘over there, not near or not familiar to speaker or addressee’

The ‘near’ demonstrative root re- is used to refer to places located near the speaker. Examples illustrating the ‘near’ adverbial demonstrative root re- are given in (15.77).

In addition to re-wa, there is another ‘near’ locative demonstrative, jee-ju, which apparently has the same meaning, although re-wa is used more frequently than jee-ju in the available corpus. Examples illustrating the two ‘near’ locative demonstratives in (nearly) similar contexts are given in (15.78).

When I arrived (with the tape recorder recording), Ventura greeted me and invited me to sit, indicating a bench (located near me):

The ‘far’ demonstrative root yu- ‘over there’ is used to refer to places located away from both addressee and speaker and unfamiliar to either speaker or addressee, or unfamiliar to both. In (15.82), yu-wa refers to a place which is far away from speaker and addressee, and unfamiliar to the addressees (but familiar to the speakers).

15.7.2. Case distinctions
Adverbial demonstratives fill the slot of three different types of postpositional phrases: (1) locative (§14.2.3), (2) general locative (§14.2.4) and (3) perlative (§14.2.5).
The general locative and perlative case suffixes, -keja ‘LOC.GNL’ and -eke ‘PERL’, are identical to the general locative and perlative postpositions, =keja ‘LOC.GNL’ and =eke ‘PERL’. On the other hand, the locative suffix -wa ‘LOC’, which occurs on three of the roots, is different from the locative postposition =ju. But note that the locative postposition =ju is identical to the suffix -ju taken by the ‘near’ demonstrative jee.

15.7. Adverbial demonstratives 615

In (15.84), I illustrate the three case distinctions. In each case, there is a full postpositional phrase in the same function in a preceding sentence or in the same sentence.

15.7.3. Anaphoric function
Adverbial demonstratives always have an anaphoric (but apparently not cataphoric) function. In other words, adverbial demonstratives are only used when the location is clearly identifiable from the context. As such they need not be accompanied by a pointing gesture. Typically, the place referred to has been mentioned in the preceding text. This can be clearly seen in (15.80) and (15.84a,b) where the places referred to by the demonstratives are expressed by full postpositional phrases in a preceding sentence. In (15.81), the addressee (taxi-driver) knows the place referred to by the ‘mid’ demonstrative tu-eke because he has mentioned this place (i.e., the bridge) himself to the addressee (the

616 15. Pronouns and demonstratives
big woman) when he asked her to get down from the motorcycle. In (15.82), the villagers can identify the place referred to by the ‘far’ demonstrative yu-wa because they already know where the speaker and his companions have been fishing.
The ‘near’ demonstratives, at least, can be used without previous mention of the place they refer to. This can be seen in (15.77a,b) and (15.78a,b), where the ‘near’ demonstratives refer to the location of the speaker.

15.8. Pointing demonstratives

Pointing demonstratives are used to draw the attention to new locations (not to entities). Unlike adverbial demonstratives, pointing demonstratives are never used anaphorically. In most cases, they are accompanied by a pointing gesture (either finger- or lip-pointing).

15.8.1. Deictic function

There are four pointing demonstratives which, similarly to adverbial demonstratives, distinguish three degrees of distance. They are given in (15.85).

(15.85)

riya9 or jee tume10
yume

‘here, near speaker’ ‘there, near or familiar to addressee’ ‘over there, not near or not familiar to speaker or
addressee’

Note that pointing demonstratives are clearly related to adverbial demonstratives. They are based on the same set of roots: ri- and jee ‘near’, tu- ‘mid’ and yu- ‘far’. These roots have exactly the same meaning in adverbial demonstratives and pointing demonstratives. In addition to the roots, pointing demonstratives include irregular formatives: -ya with ri- and -me with tu- and yu-. The origin of these formatives is unknown. They do not correspond to any recognizable postposition. In this study, they are not treated as independent suffixes but as parts of unitary roots.
The three distance distinctions, ‘near’, ‘mid’ and ‘far’, that distinguish the pointing demonstratives are illustrated below. The ‘near’ pointing demonstratives riya and jee are synonymous (similarly to the adverbial demonstratives rewa ‘here-LOC’ and jee-ju ‘here-LOC’; see (15.78)). They are used while pointing
9 Note that this form is most likely related to the root of the 3PROX pronouns (§15.1.2 and §15.2.2).
10 When tume and yume are followed by the focus particle =dya, they have the alternate forms tumi and yumi, respectively; see §15.8.2 .

15.8. Pointing demonstratives 617

to a place located near the speaker, as shown in (15.86). Note that in (a.), the speaker is also the addressee as he is talking to himself.

(15.86) a. Riya=dya [e-kwe eskupeta]CC. here=FOC 1SG-GEN shotgun
‘(I was very scared of the anteater but I said to myself:) “Here (in my hands) is my shotgun (so I should not be afraid)”.’ ba115

b. Jee=dya [Antoni=ja tujuri]CC. here=FOC Antoni=GEN mosquito.net
‘Here (in the photo that we are looking at) is Antoni’s mosquito net.’ ft018

In a Cavineña village, when arriving at a house, looking for someone, one typically asks are ‘QUEST’ (§16.2.2) and the name of the person looked for, to which the person looked for responds riya ‘here’. This was recorded when Antonio Yubanera (A) and I arrived at Ventura Mayo (V)’s house once. They said (15.87).

(15.87) A: Are Hermano? QUEST brother
‘Hello, Brother? Are you there? Where are you?’ ci001

V: Riya Hermano! here brother
‘Hello Brother, I’m here!’ ci002

See also jee=dya mikwana=ja misionero ‘here is your missionary’ in (T1.56) and jee=dya =mike =Ø isara-ya ‘here I am talking to you’ in (T1.73).
The ‘mid’ pointing demonstrative tume is used while pointing to a place which is located away from the speaker, close to the addressee or not close to the addressee but visible/easily identifiable to him. In (15.88), a group of Cavineñas are ambushing their enemies. Someone spots the enemies coming and informs his companions:

jeti-ya. come-IMPFV

618 15. Pronouns and demonstratives

The ‘far’ pointing demonstrative yume is used to point to a place which is located away from both speaker and addressee and non-visible/difficult to identify. One night in Misión Cavinas, Alfredo and I were woken up by a porcupine that had entered our house. Alfredo went to Lucio Tavo, our closest neighbor, to ask him to come with his rifle and kill the animal. Alfredo said to Lucio:

(15.89)

ju-ani-ya.

porcupine kill-COME.TEMP-IMP.SG over.there be-SIT-IMPFV

‘Come kill a porcupine! Over there, it is sitting (on a beam).’ ij016

In Misión Cavinas, Rosmeri Tavo used to cook for both Alfredo Tavo and me. One day, Alfredo had been away the whole morning. Rosmeri came to ask me if he would be back for lunch (i.e., if she had to cook for him too). I did not know so we waited for Alfredo. Suddenly, Rosmeri saw Alfredo in the distance, pointed to him, and said to me:

(15.90)

Yumi=dya

jeti-ya.

over.there=FOC come-IMPFV

‘Over there, he is coming.’ n5.0152

15.8.2. Morpho-syntactic properties

Pointing demonstratives have the following morpho-syntactic properties:

1 — pointing demonstratives are peripheral (not core) elements. They do not fill any specific postpositional slots (unlike adverbial demonstratives, which fill locative, general locative and perlative PP slots), even though they can only refer to locations (and are translated by the English adverbial demonstratives ‘here’, ‘there’ and ‘over there’); 2 — pointing demonstratives are most often used in main clauses; 3 — pointing demonstratives normally come first in the clause (as in all preceding examples). Example (15.91) is a rare exception, with the ‘mid’ pointing demonstrative tume used in the middle of a clause.

‘How am I going to kill it there (a giant anteater, hidden inside a

15.8. Pointing demonstratives 619
tremendously thick vegetation)?’ ba058
4 — pointing demonstratives are very often marked with the phrasal particle =dya (§17.2.3), as in (15.86a,b) and (15.88); note however that this is not an obligation, as in (15.89) and (15.91). When this happens, =dya causes a nonpredictable phonological change e  i on the last e vowel of tume, which becomes tumi=dya, as in (15.88), and yume, which becomes yumi=dya, as in (15.90); note that =dya does not trigger any changes with riya and jee, as can be seen in (15.86a,b).

15.8.3. Additional functions

Pointing demonstratives tume and yume (but not jee and riya) are very often used when there is the second position particle =tukwe ‘CONT.EVID’ (§16.3.3), as in (15.92).

(15.92) a. Tume =tukwe

ani-kware

[bina [i-keO susu-ti-ya=ke]]S. bat 1SG-FM suck-GO.TEMP-IMPFV=LIG

‘It happened that the bridge was rotten underneath. But on top, it was hard. (So I crossed and of course the bridge broke.)’ wa071b

It is not clear what the exact function of tume and yume is in this context and why tume is used in (a.), while yume is used in (b.)
There is an interesting, although not fully understood, use of riya ‘here’ and tume ‘there’ in ‘copula’ clauses with an NP as CC, as follows:

1 — the construction only consists of the CC (an NP) followed (never preceded) by riya, as in (15.93), or tume, as in (15.94).

620 15. Pronouns and demonstratives

In (15.93), Griselda Cartagena and her family are taken back to their community, Bolivar, in the light plane of the missionaries. They have gotten lost in a storm. They spot a village that they think is Bolivar. But when they get closer, the pilot says:

(15.93)

Bolivar=amaCC

riya!

Bolivar.village=NEG here

‘(Hold on,) this is not Bolivar!’ av019

The conversation turn in (15.94) was volunteered by Francisco Vaca.

(15.94) A: Ai=jaCC=keCC =riCS

anteojoCS?

INT=DAT=LIG =3PROX.SG(-FM) glasses

‘Whose glasses are these?’

B: E-kwiCC=keCC tumeCS! 1SG-DAT=LIG there
‘Those are mine!’ n1.0170

2 — the construction appears to never overtly express the CS; that is, there are no CS bound or independent pronouns or NPs; 3 — riya and tume in the construction can refer to a place, as in (15.93), but also to a thing, as in (15.94), or even to people, as in (15.95).
In (15.95), during the Chaco war against Paraguay (1932-1935), Cipriano Tavo and (his younger brother) Victor Tavo Mayo, were supposed to fight in the Bolivian army. However, they escaped and went to the town of Trinidad to ask for the bishop’s protection. The bishop (B) knew Cipriano (C) but not Victor (V). When they arrived, he asked Cipriano:

(15.95) B: Riya11=riCS

eje=keCC? [Mi-kwe jau]CC?

here =3PROX.SG(-FM) INT=LIG 2SG-GEN younger.brother

‘Who is this? Your younger brother?’

C: Jejee, [e-kwe e-jau]CC

tume.

yes 1SG-GEN 1-younger-brother there

‘Yes, that’s my younger brother.’

11 This riya is a regular pointing demonstrative and not part of the construction discussed here. This is because — although it is found in a copula clause with a NP as CC — (1) riya comes first in the clause and (2) there is a bound pronoun.

15.8. Pointing demonstratives 621
B: Eje=keCC riya? VituCC riya? INT=LIG here Vitu here ‘Which (of your younger brothers) is this? Is this Vitu?’
V: VituCC tume. Vitu there ‘(Yes,) that’s Vitu.’ gu031-033
4 — riya and tume in this construction are always anaphoric;
One wonders if in this construction, riya and tume are not special bound pronouns referring to the CS, that would come in addition to the two series of distance-neutral S/CS pronouns, i.e., =tu-ke, =ta-tse and =tu-na, and proximate S/CS pronoun, i.e., =ri-ke, =re-tse and =re-na. This issue needs more work.
Finally, we can note that the pointing demonstratives riya and yume are homophonous with, and possibly historically related to, two auxiliary-triggering markers used in slot B of the predicate: riya ‘STARTLING’ (§10.2.3) and yume ‘IMMEDIATELY’ (§10.2.2).

15.8.4. Nominal demonstrative strategies

Cavineña does not have specific demonstratives functioning within NPs, such as English ‘this’ and ‘that’. This is remedied by two strategies. The first strategy consists of marking a pointing demonstrative, which is a peripheral element, with the ligature morpheme =ke (i.e., the relative clause marker). The resulting constructs can then be used as modifiers to a noun within an NP (in slot A of the NP structure), as with riya=ke in (15.96a) and yume=ke in (15.96b).

‘That papaya (tree) over there (that we see in the distance) is nice.’ n5.0466

622 15. Pronouns and demonstratives

See also jee=ke ‘this’ in (15.12c) and tume=ke ‘that’ in (15.45b). In this work, I analyze the pointing demonstrative + ligature constructions as
copula relative clauses; that is, the Cavineña equivalent of English ‘this/that X’ is literally ‘the X who/that is here/there’. For a justification of this analysis, see §13.6.2.
The second option is to use a pointing demonstrative in apposition to an NP, i.e., without any further marking, as in (15.97).

(15.97) a. … kakemiti-nuka-ya

[[tume] [peya ekwita]=tsewe].

For another example with tume, see (T1.78). Note that when a pointing demonstrative occurs first in the clause, and is fol-
lowed by an NP, and there are no second position clitics (to show the end of the first immediate constituent of the clause) it is not possible to decide whether the demonstrative is apposed or not, as in (15.98).

Chapter 16 Particles — independent, first position and second po-
sition particles
Particles are monomorphemic grammatical words uninflected for any grammatical categories. There are four different types of particles. They essentially differ in their degree of phonological and structural independence, as follows: 1 — independent particles (§16.1) have the highest degree of freedom. They form independent phonological words which can occur anywhere in any type of clause; 2 — first position particles (§16.2) also form independent phonological words but have distributional restrictions: they can only occur in main clauses and must be in first position; 3 — second position particles (§16.3) do not form independent phonological words: they are enclitics to the last phonological word of the first immediate constituent of a main clause (NP, PP, predicate, independent or first position particle, adverbial clause, etc.); 4 — phrasal particles (not discussed here but in Chapter 17) do not form independent phonological words either: they are enclitics to the last phonological word of an immediate constituent of any type of clause regardless of its position.
16.1. Independent particles
16.1.1. Introduction
Independent particles are independent phonological words which do not have any ordering restrictions; they behave like any clausal constituent in this respect. Unlike first and second position particles (but similarly to phrasal particles), independent particles can occur in any type of clause, whether main clause or subordinate.
The following tables list all attested independent particles found in the data, sorted by semantic field: sentence linkage (Table 16.1), aspect/manner (Table 16.2), time (Table 16.3), time of day (Table 16.4) and direction/location (Table 16.5).

Only three independent particles have been investigated in some depth in this study: dyake ‘very, a lot’ (§11.1.2), datse ‘FRUST’ (§16.1.2), amena ‘BM’ (§16.1.3) and aikwana/aikira ‘FILL’ (§16.1.4). The other particles require more work.

16.1.2. datse ‘FRUST’

The particle datse ‘FRUSTrative’ means that an action is performed in vain, i.e., without the expected results/consequences.1 Datse is found both as an inde-
pendent particle and as a second position particle.
I illustrate datse in various positions in the clause in (16.1).

‘This way it (the community of Misión Cavinas) is not far (so we could get there very fast. However, since the path is flooded, it will still take us a lot of time to get there.)’ ka257

16.1.3. amena ‘BM’

The independent particle amena ‘Boundary Marker’ has a general meaning of completion. This particle is used extremely frequently by some speakers (see discussion below). It has essentially a discourse function of separating the information provided by subsequent sentences or sentence constituents; in this latter case, amena can be used more than once in a sentence. In Spanish, amena is often translated as ahora ‘now’ or ya ‘now, already’.
In (16.4), I show amena as a separator of sentences. It basically manifests the fact that an event does not overlap with the preceding or following event.

The function of repeating amena between clausal constituents is not altogether clear. It is possibly used for clarity as a way to overtly mark the clausal constituents boundaries.
Amena can be used extremely frequently, depending on speakers. Some speakers like Alfredo Tavo tend to use amena rather sparingly.2 In T1, for example, he only uses amena in 6 % of the sentences (9 instances of amena out of 153 sentences). Gregorio Yubanera, on the other hand, uses amena in 40 % of the sentences in T2 (6 instances of amena out of 15 sentences). More work is needed to determine whether any correlations can be made between the use of amena and sociolinguistic parameters such as age, sex, etc.

16.1.4. aikwana/aikira ‘FILL’
The two morphemes aikwana and aikira are lexical fillers. They are used in discourse as temporary/preparative substitutes for words that the speaker has difficulty remembering. No clear semantic or formal differences were found between aikwana and aikira. All I can say at this stage is that aikwana is used much more frequently than aikira (171 instances of aikwana against 58 instances of aikira in the whole corpus) and that aikira tends to be used by older speakers.
2 Alfredo even disapproved once of the tendency of some speakers to overuse that particle.

16.1. Independent particles 631

As an illustration, aikwana in (16.8) is used when the speaker has difficulty remembering the term that refers to a specialist of canoe-making. Note that he does not manage to find a native Cavineña term and ends up using a Spanish loan, maestro:

‘I didn’t make it (that canoe) alone, brother. I made it with a, what’s the name, a master (lit. a master made me do it with him).’ ab125-127

The examples in (16.9) provide additional instances of aikwana as a substitute for various sorts of words, such as the (borrowed) noun meaning ‘poncho’ in (a.), the quantifier meaning ‘seven’ in (b.), the noun phrase meaning ‘forest tip’ in (c.) and the transitive verb meaning ‘inform’ in (d.).

See also aikwana in (6.12c), with substitution of the noun pere ‘raft’, in (14.48), with substitution of the proper noun Barrio Villa, in (4.72b), with substitution of the (borrowed) noun mono ‘monkey’, in (15.12a), with substitution of the verb keti- ‘take out’, and in (15.34), with substitution of the (borrowed) noun diccionario ‘dictionary’.
Examples of aikira can be found in (4.60b), with substitution of the proper noun Biri, in (6.25b), with substitution of the derived adjective e-wiru (NPF-scatter) ‘scattered’, in (18.16a), with substitution of the (borrowed) noun carga ‘load’, in (T1.40) with substitution of the noun phrase tuna-ja e-jiyu=ke (3PL-DAT RES-make.friend.of=LIG) ‘their friend’, and in (T2.9), with substitution of the noun jeme ‘trumpeter bird’.
Note that in all these examples aikwana and aikira do not take case markers, even when they are used to substitutes for nouns that do require such marking, as in (16.8), where aikwana substitutes for maestro ‘master’ in the ergative case. And when aikwana and aikira substitute for verb, they do not take verbal morphology either, as in (16.9d), we aikwana substitutes for the verb kweja‘inform’ inflected with perfect morphology.
The origin of aikwana is transparent; ai is most likely related to the interrogative noun ai (§12.5.3); as for kwana it is probably related either to the plural marker =kwana (§13.3) or the ‘uncertainty’ independent particle =kwana (§17.2.15). The origin of aikira, on the other hand is unknown.

16.2. First position particles
16.2.1. Introduction
First position particles, similarly to the independent particles, form one grammatical and one phonological word. However, they differ in that first position particles must occur as the first constituent of a main clause. First position particles do not occur in adverbial clauses.
Table 16.6 lists all first position particles attested in the data. The right column cross-references the sections where they are discussed.

16.2.2. are ‘QUEST’

The first position particle are ‘QUESTion’ makes explicit that a clause is a polar question; recall that there is no specific intonation for questions in Cavineña.
In (16.10), Elio Tavo relates how he once was attacked by an anaconda snake. He comments that, when he returned to his community, limping and feeling terribly bad, one of the school teachers saw him and asked him:

In Cavineña society, at the end of a meal, the way the host asks the guest if s/he wants more food is by saying (16.11).

‘Do you you want more (food)? (lit. do you see food not desirable again?) n4.0533

Are is also used in clauses which inquire about information but do not make use of a question word, most often because the type of information requested is obvious from the context, as in (16.12), questioning time, and (16.13), questioning a location.

(16.12)

In a Cavineña village, when arriving at someone’s house, looking for someone, one says are and his name (or a term by which the person can be identified), to which the person looked for responds riya ‘here’, as in (16.13); this example is taken from a recorded conversation when Antonio Yubanera (A) and I arrived at Ventura Mayo (V)’s house once.
(16.13) A: Are Hermano? QUEST brother ‘Hello, Brother? Are you there? Where are you?’ ci001
V: Riya Hermano! here brother ‘Hello Brother, I’m here!’ ci002

16.2.3. ita ‘ATT.GETTER’

The first position particle ita ‘ATTention.GETTER’ is only used with command clauses, either imperative or hortative. It is used to politely make an unexpected command/request or make a request that shifts the topic of discussion.
In (16.14), in the middle of the night, Alfredo Tavo and I are woken up by a strange noise inside the house where we are sleeping. Alfredo gets up and searches for it. When he finds out that it is a porcupine. He calls me:

In (16.15), Antonio Yubanera and I have come to Teresa Rutani’s house to record some old traditions and practices. Antonio first talks with Ventura Mayo (Teresa’s husband) about Ventura’s bad health. Then Antonio turns to Teresa and says:

In (16.17), Alfredo Tavo has traveled to Alto Ivón, the community where the Chácobo people live. Nearby live the Pacahuara people. He is very curious about these indigenous people he has never met before so he says to himself, using the singular hortative.

16.2.4. deka ‘POTENTIALLY’

The first position particle deka ‘POTentially’ indicates that the proposition could hold providing a condition is realized. It only occurs in (main) clauses with a predicate inflected with the semantically similar potential circumfix e-…-u ‘POT’ (see §6.1.5). The function of deka appears to reinforce the potential reading of a clause with a predicate already marked with e-…-u.

16.2.5. masa ‘SEEMINGLY’

I have very few examples of the particle masa and the following discussion is only tentative. Speakers appear to use masa when comparing similar propositions, to say that a proposition is similar to another proposition.

(16.20) a. Masa=dya

=di

‘(How come there is still so much water on the paths!) It is as if it were still the rainy season.’ ka292

Apparently, the particle masa is found as a second position clitic in questions.

[i-keS maju-wa=ju] e-ju-u? 1SG-FM die-PERF=DS POT-be-POT

‘What could my dogs have done if I had died?’ wa079

Note that masa is only found in copula clauses. Note also that when masa is a first position particle, as in (16.20) above, it always occurs with the phrasal particle =dya followed by the second position particle =di. More work is needed to determine whether =dya is necessarily present or not.

16.2.6. jipakwana ‘SEEMINGLY.NOT’

A handful of examples are available of a first position particle jipa that is possibly the negated version of masa ‘SEEMINGLY’, meaning that the proposition is likely not to occur.
Example (16.22) comes from a recorded conversation between Cavineña men doing community work. They were trying to have me buy them a new (but very expensive) radio transmitter. As I wasn’t giving any signs I would buy it, Vidal Mayo (the president of the community) said:

16.3. Second position particles

16.3.1. Introduction

Second position particles form independent grammatical words but not independent phonological words. Together with bound pronouns (§15.2), second position particles are enclitics to the last phonological word of the first immediate constituent of a main clause. Second position particles do not occur in adverbial clauses.
Table 16.7 lists all the second position particles attested in the data, provisionally sorted by semantic field. The right column cross-references the sections where they are discussed.

§16.3.9
§16.1.2

As I said, the second position is also the locus of bound pronouns. When a (main) clause has both second position particles and bound pronouns, bound pronouns always come last in the chain, as in (16.24).

Several second position particles can also co-occur — note that 3 cooccurring second position particles is the maximum attested. When this happens, there are also ordering restrictions. This is the topic of §16.3.10 below.
Second position particles can also form a clitic chain with phrasal particles. This happens when a constituent marked by phrasal particles occurs first in a main clause. In this situation, as expected, the second position particles follow the phrasal particles, as in (16.25).

‘It is said that (the wild turkey was not cooked at all so) it was full of blood (lit. nothing but blood was flowing on the meat).’ hm097

In this study, for clarity, second position particles (but not phrasal particles) are separated from their host, and from each other when two or more second position particles co-occur, by a space. This helps the reader immediately distinguish second position particles from phrasal particles. This also helps visualize where the first clausal constituent ends.

16.3.2. =ni ‘MAYBE’

The second position particle =ni is used when the speaker is not fully certain of what he says. It translates in English as ‘maybe’, ‘probably’, ‘I think that’, ‘I guess that’, etc.
In (16.26), the speaker is guessing what his dogs’ thoughts were once he fell into a ditch.

In one text Alfredo Tavo relates his only visit to the Pacahuara indigenous people in 1990. He had been very surprised to see that, at that time, the Pacahuaras still kept many of their traditions, such as smoking fish and wearing bird feathers in their noses, etc. But at the end of the story, Alfredo, who had not heard about the Pacahuaras since, wonders how they might be in 2000, when this text was recorded. So he says:

Other examples are ‘we might kill each other’ in (T1.8), ‘perhaps he was scared’ in (T1.27) and ‘the tractors might still be there’ in (T1.117).

Note however that, structurally, there is no cogent reason to analyze those clauses as dependent in Cavineña (i.e., controlled by the following clause):3
they do not receive any specific marking (apart from the particle =ni) and the

Historically, the particle =ni ‘MAYBE’ might be related to the negator ni= ‘NOT.EVEN’ which is a borrowing from Spanish ni ‘not even’ (see §17.2.10).

The second position particle =tukwe ‘CONTrary to EVIDence’ is a noteworthy morpheme. It expresses the fact that a proposition is true despite the evidence.
In (16.32), Eli Mayo relates how he killed his first deer with a rifle when he was 13. The deer was very heavy so he went back home to ask for help. But nobody wanted to believe him because it was the first time he had used a rifle. Eventually, they went and saw the deer. His sister-in-law said:

In (16.33), Lucas Tavo relates how once he had his blood sucked by a vampire bat during his sleep without him noticing anything. He only found out when he woke up. When he realizes what had happened to him he said:

In (16.35), the Ese Ejja people have killed a Cavineña woman near her village. They make a lot of noise celebrating their killing. They are heard by the (Cavineña) villagers. The Cavineñas realize that the noise comes from their enemies but they cannot figure out what has happened. The narrator comments:

See also ‘but in reality they were very upset’ in (T1.6) and ‘it was rheumatism’ in (T1.105).
The use of =tukwe with future events is noteworthy. This happens for presentiments, whether negative or positive. In (16.36) the brother of a woman has disappeared. When she feels her right arm palpitating, she says:

In (16.26) Alfredo Tavo relates a long journey when he did not have water. At some point in the story, he is desperate to find any water or anybody to help him and says:

16.3.4. =pa ‘REP’
The second position particle =pa ‘REPortative’ is used when the speaker has heard the information from someone else. It is the only category in Cavineña that specifies the source of knowledge one has of a particular proposition.
It is not altogether clear how obligatory the use of the reportative particle is and whether one can really talk about an ‘evidential system’. In some reported

644 16. Particles — independent, first and second position

stories, =pa occurs on every sentence (as in T2 for example). In some others, it is only sparingly used once in a while. Yet in some other stories (which have supposedly been heard), it is not used at all. It is possible that there are some variations between speakers. T2 for example is from a very old (over 80 years old) speaker which suggests that elderly speakers use the reportative particle more consistently. More work is required to clarify this issue.
The reportative particle is normally used when relating traditional stories as with (16.38):4

In (16.40), Antonio Yubanera relates an old practice of forcing children to bathe before dawn.

‘It is said that when they (our ancestor’s children) refused to bathe, they (our ancestors) would beat them.’ bn012

The reportative particle is also used just to report information without mentioning someone specifically. In (16.41), Victoria Tavo and her daughter have

‘They say that they really don’t have any fish or meat.’ ka162

The reportative particle can also be used to repeat information heard from someone who is clearly identified, as in (16.42), where the source of the information, ‘the foreign lady’ is the A NP of the sentence.

(16.42)

Runeshi =pa =ekwanaO gringa=raA

‘The lady said that she will have someone (pilot) taking us (back to our community) by plane on Monday.’ ri059

The ‘source’ person can still be present in the speech situation. Example (16.43) comes from a recorded conversation between Cavineña men doing community work. At some point, they ask me questions about the tape recorder — e.g., How much does it cost? Where did I buy it? Could I give it to them? etc. — and then comment on my answers among themselves. Vidal Mayo hasn’t heard the price and asks for it from his workmates. Carmelo Camaconi responds:

price-big-ASF =REP =3PROX.SG(-FM) here=LIG

‘He said that this (tape recorder) is very expensive (lit. highpriced).’ tb053

The reportative particle can be used with a first person subject. In (16.44), Francisco Vaca relates how, as a young boy, he fell from a mango tree (see earlier example (16.34)). After the fall, he was lying unconscious on the ground, but still holding a mango fruit firmly in his hand. He tells us that according to what people told him later:

‘They said that I didn’t want to let go of the mango.’ mg028

In (16.45) a tricky fox wants to have sex with the jaguar’s (three) wifes (see earlier example (16.27)). To convince them, he lies saying that this is what their (jaguar) husband wants:

‘I am going to sleep with you (pl) (your husband said).’ zo073

The reportative particle can be used with command clauses: imperative in (16.46a), hortative in (16.46b), and jussive in (16.46c).

The reportative particle can also be used with content questions to obtain some information that has been given by a non-speech act participant; note that I have no example of this use with polar questions but there is no reason why this should not be allowed. Following the command given by the son to his father in (16.46a), the father replies by (16.47) which is a question about the motives of the foreigner:

go-IMPFV =REP =3SG(-FM) 3SG-GEN village=LOC

‘He said he is going back to his community.’ n1.0415

In Cavineña, the way one asks someone to repeat something not understood is by saying ai=pa [INT=REP] ‘What’s that? What did you say?’.
There is an interesting use of the reportative particle that I witnessed (but unfortunately did not record) while living in Cavineña communities. People (often women or children) who were too shy to talk to me directly would have someone else more confident report their questions or comments to me; even though sometimes they would be sitting or standing next to me. I thus heard the exact same sentence uttered twice, except for the use of the reportative particle in the repeated sentence.

16.3.5. =di(dya) ‘STRG.EMPH’

The particle =di(dya) is used for strong emphasis. In a majority of examples, it shows up as =di. Yet in a few others, one finds =didya. The two alternating forms do not have any clear meaning differences. In this study, they are treated as variants of the same morpheme in free variation.
The particle =di(dya) can first be used to express strong sensations, as in (16.49) and (16.50). When one feels affected by a very hot sun, one can comment to others, complaining (raising the pitch of the voice):

(16.49)

Uke-da=dyaCC =di! hot-ASF=FOC = STRG.EMPH
‘It’s very hot (and I am suffering from it).’ n5.1049

648 16. Particles — independent, first and second position

In (16.50) (reproduced from (16.29)), a man is trying to prepare a soft drink mixing (what he thinks is) drink powder with water. In reality the powder he is using is leaven so the drink does not turn red/brown as normally expected. When he thinks he knows why, he says:

(16.50)

Uma-dama=dya =di

=ni

=ri-keO

many-NEG=FOC = STRG.EMPH =MAYBE =3PROX.SG-FM

=ØA

isha-wa!

(=1SG-ERG) put.in-PERF

‘Maybe I haven’t poured enough of it (the powder).’ lv024

The particle =di(dya) can also be used to make a request more insistent, as in (16.51) and (16.52) (see also (16.55)). In (16.51), in the middle of a recording session, Julio Mayo, the son of Ventura Mayo, came for a visit. Concerned that this would disrupt the recording, Ventura said to him “Please don’t talk yet! We are doing a recording,” and then, contrasting with what he just said:

(16.51)

Je-kwe=dya.

Nubi-na-kwe=dya

=di!

come-IMP.SG=FOC enter-COME.TEMP-IMP.SG=FOC = STRG.EMPH

‘But come! Do come in (lit. enter)!’ ct078

In (16.52), during a terrible drought, the horses are about to die from thirst. People are wondering where to find water. The horse owner said:

(16.52)

[Yume nabade=ju] =di

over.there swamp=LOC = STRG.EMPH =EMPH

iji-mere-ti=ishu! drink-CAUS-GO.TEMP-PURP.GNL

‘Let’s (pl) take them (our horses) over there to the swamp so that we can make them drink (water).’ en011

Finally, =di(dya) can be used in a question when one really wants to know the answer, as in (16.53). Here a group of Cavineña men are spending a night out fishing. Suddenly they hear a noise nearby. They are very scared. Someone stands up and says:

16.3. Second position particles 649

[ekwitaS ju-neni-ya=bucha]? person be-RANDOM-IMPFV=SIMLR

‘What do I hear that sounds like a person walking.’ cc016

In most examples (as in those given above) the form used is =di. In a few examples, however, we find the form =didya without any difference in distribution or meaning. Until more work can clarify whether there is a difference, =di and =didya will be treated as two allomorphs of the same morpheme that occur in free variation. An example of =didya is given in (16.54). Here, Alfredo Tavo relates how, after having almost died from thirst during a journey, he finally found water at the end of the day. He was so thirsty that he spent the whole night drinking water. Alfredo comments that when he felt he had had enough water:

(16.54)

Wekaka=wieCC

=didya

=ni.

be.at.dawn=JUST.BEFORE = STRG.EMPH =MAYBE

‘Dawn might have been about to break.’ sd105

Another example is given in (16.75). It is most likely that the dya formative that occurs in =didya is the phrasal
particle =dya ‘FOC’ (§17.2.3). This particle cannot modify a second position particle but could have been modifying di at a stage where this particle was independent.

16.3.6. =jatsu ‘EXACTLY’
The particle =jatsu is only found in interrogative clauses, whether they are used to question content or polarity. This particle appears to express the fact that the speaker is requesting a very precise or honest answer.
In (16.24) (repeated), Roberto Amapo has drunk a refreshment made of leaven powder (see (16.29) above). As a result his stomach swells and he gets very sick. He still has no idea that he used leaven powder instead of the appropriate drink powder. When he goes to his friends, they try to find out what has happened so they ask him:

=tu-keO =miA

ara-wa?

INT =EXACTLY =3SG-FM =2SG(-ERG) eat-PERF

‘But what exactly did you eat?’ lv032

An example within a very similar context is (T1.104), where Alfredo Tavo is asked if he knows medicinal plants to treat a sick person. Alfredo says yes but he wants to know what the exact type of sickness is, so that he can think of the appropriate plant. So he asks, using =jatsu, “but what is it exactly that he (the sick person) has?”.
In (16.55), from the community work conversation (see (16.43)), Elio Tavo (E) has been doing all the talking with me. So he wants the others, who are much shyer, in particular Vidal Mayo (V), to ask me questions too:

In preparation for a long trip, Victoria Tavo, her daughter and I had been looking for food (see (16.41)). A relative of Victoria, Maria Mayo, had monkey meat. But Maria was really wondering if I could really eat that type of food so she asked me:

16.3. Second position particles 651

16.3.7. =taa ‘EMPH’

The particle =taa ‘EMPHatic’ expresses a mild surprise, whether positive or negative, for something that goes somewhat against what one would have expected.
The particle =taa expresses subjective (as opposed to objective) statements. In (16.58), Roberto Amapo is invited to drink a refreshment he had never tried before. He finds it very tasty. He says to his friends:

In (16.59), Victoria Tavo and her daughter have left home with an ox-cart to fetch me at a nearby community. Their dog has followed them. They don’t want him to come along so the daughter accompanies him a little way back towards their home. Victoria waits a very long time but the daughter doesn’t seem to be coming back. She says:

See also (16.4b). The particle =taa is used to soften commands. In (16.61), in a folktale nar-
rated by Elio Tavo, =taa is used when the fox begs the jaguar not to eat him.

The particle =taa is used in leave-taking formulas. The person who leaves says “I am going!” The person who stays responds: “go (=taa)!”. This can be illustrated with the conversation turn in (16.62) below. I was recording a conversation between Antonio Yubanera (A) and Ventura Mayo (V) (in Ventura’s house). At the end, Antonio indicated to me that we had talked enough and that it was time to leave. Then he said to Ventura:

The particle =taa is used with questions which normally should not have to be asked because under normal circumstances, the information (requested by the question) is available. In (16.63), Victoria Tavo and her daughter have traveled an entire day with an ox-cart to fetch me, having arrived at a nearby community. When they arrive, they cannot find me. Victoria says to herself:

16.3.10. Distribution

Second position particles appear to follow very strict ordering restrictions (unlike phrasal particles; see §17.3). When two (or more) second position particles co-occur, they are always found in the same order.
Table 16.8 summarizes all the situations of co-occurrence of two second position particles and the order in which they occur, as per the available data. Note that no attempt has been made to conduct elicitation on this topic. Note also that =jatsu ‘EXACTLY’ has not been included in the table, since it does not co-occur with any other particles in the data. Particles in the left column correspond to the first member of a sequence while particles in the top horizontal row correspond to the second member. The table cross-references the examples of attested combinations provided earlier or given in (16.74).

It is not clear whether two (or more) second position particles are in paradigmatic opposition. At first glance, this could be the case for =tukwe ‘CONT.EVID’ and =ni ‘MAYBE’ which encode different epistemic modality values. One observation I can nevertheless make is that there appears to be a clear template for the sequence involving =di(dya) ‘STRG.EMPH’, then =ni ‘MAYBE’, then =pa ‘REP’ then =taa ‘EMPH’. Note that only three — not four — of these particles were found in a sequence, as in (16.75), from a recorded conversation. Here, Ventura Mayo is explaining to Antonio Yubanera and me how to make traditional baskets. Antonio is amazed at the complexity of the procedure and says:

Chapter 17 Particles — phrasal particles

There are four different types of particles in Cavineña. The first three types, independent particles, first position particles, and second position particles have been discussed in the preceding chapter. The present chapter discusses the last type of particles: phrasal particles.

17.1. Introduction

Phrasal particles, similarly to second position particles, do not form independent phonological words. All phrasal particles but one (ni= ‘NOT.EVEN’) are enclitics to the last phonological word of a phrase and have scope over the phrase only; the particle ni= is a proclitic to the first phonological word of a phrase. Similarly to independent particles phrasal particles can occur in any type of clause.
Table 17.1 lists all the attested phrasal particles, provisionally sorted by semantics field. The right column cross-references corresponding sections.

660 17. Particles — phrasal

Most phrasal particles can occur on any type of phrases (NP, PP, predicate, independent particles, adverbial clause, etc.). A few do however show some restrictions; =jari ‘STILL’ and =jipenee ‘ALMOST’, for example, only occur on predicates and copula complements.
Similarly to second position particles, phrasal particles can co-occur. Unlike second position particles, however, phrasal particles do not have strong ordering restrictions, as discussed in §17.3.
If a phrase that is marked by phrasal particles comes first in a main clause, these phrasal particles can be followed by second position particles, if these are present. In (17.1), for example, we can see two phrasal particles followed by one second position particle. Recall that second position particles are separated from their host and from each other by a space.

‘It is said that (the wild turkey was not cooked at all so) it was full of blood (lit. nothing but blood was flowing on the meat).’ hm097

Note that this order (which cannot be reversed) is consistent with the fact that phrasal particles have a narrower scope than second position particles — phrasal particle have scope of over a clausal constituent while second position particles have scope over a whole main clause.
Phrasal particles can also form a clitic chain with postposition clitics, if they happen to modify a postpositional phrase, as with =dyane in (17.2).

17.2. Phrasal particles
17.2.1. =jari ‘STILL’
The particle =jari means that a state or an event is not yet completed but is nearing completion. Unlike other phrasal particles, it is restricted to verbal predicates, copula complements (whatever they may be) and (less often) adjunct constituents. It is not attested with other types of constituents. See Table 17.2 below for a summary.

17.2. Phrasal particles 661

In past tense settings, =jari means that the state/event has begun before and was still holding at the story time but does not hold at the present time anymore. This is illustrated in (17.3).

At the beginning of one of the village meetings that I attended in Galilea, Antonio Mayo was missing. People were wondering where he was. Then someone said:

‘He has gone bathing (and is still there; but he will soon be back here).’ n4.0349

See also ‘when I was still a leader’ in (T1.1). In present tense settings, =jari means that the state/event has begun in the
past and will still hold true for some time in the future (although not forever). This is illustrated in (17.5).

The phrasal particle =nuka is formally identical, and without doubt related to, the verbal Aktionsart suffix -nuka ‘REITR’ (§7.1.4). Both can actually cooccur in a single clause, as can be seen in (17.10a) and (17.11a).

17.2.3. =dya ‘FOC’
The particle =dya ‘FOCus’ expresses a mild contrastive focus.1 The function of this particle can be compared to stress-focus in English; see for example Givón (1990: 702). It singles out or gives a bit more prominence to one (or more) constituent(s) in a sentence because this (or these) constituent(s) carries information that contrasts with some other information or expectation.
The particle =dya can be used extremely frequently. In T1 for example, Alfredo Tavo uses =dya in 43 % of the sentences — 66 instances of =dya out of 153 sentences. Note that Gregorio Yubanera, on the other hand, does not use it once in T2.
In (17.12) I illustrate =dya on various types of constituents.

1 A stronger contrast can obtained by fronting the constituent and using the second position particle =bakwe ‘CONTR’ (§16.3.8).

See also, among many other examples, =dya on the negated CS argument dutya bina=ama ‘not all bats’ in (17.38a), on the associative pro-form tua-tsewe ‘with him (rather than alone)’ in (T1.84) and on the locative pro-form tu-wa ‘there’ in (T1.116).
The particle =dya can occur more than once in a sentence, as shown in (17.13).

17.2. Phrasal particles 667

The particle =dya has a strong tendency to lexicalize. Quite a few forms in Cavineña have a formative (synchronically non-segmentable) ending dya. It is likely that in many cases — although I cannot be fully sure at the present time — this formative is historically the focus particle. An exhaustive list of these forms is given in Table 17.3.
With the three words listed in (17.14), the particle =dya triggers the idiosyncratic phonological modifications e  i in (a.) and dya  di in (b.)

(17.14) a. tume ‘there’

 tumi=dya

yume ‘over there’  yumi=dya

(see (T1.3))

b. jadya ‘thus’

 jadi=dya

The focus particle =dya triggers the deletion of the formative -ke ‘FM’ found with absolutive singular independent pronouns (§15.1.2), as shown in (17.15) and exemplified in (17.16).

‘It is me whom they sent.’ T1.22

In fast speech, there is another phonological modification that is triggered by =dya whereby the TAM inflectional verbal suffix -ya ‘IMPFV’ turns into -e when the suffix is followed by =dya. Unlike the words in (17.14) however, this does not happen in slow and careful speech. See the full discussion in §6.1.3.

17.2.4. =kwita ‘RESTR’

The particle =kwita ‘RESTRictive’ is used to restrict the referential scope of a category to its prototypical members. It translates as ‘no more/no less’ with quantities, ‘just’ with events or properties, ‘only/alone’ with entities, and ‘right/not before nor after’ with time.

The particle =kwita triggers an idiosyncratic phonological change kw  j on the time independent particle iyakwa ‘now, today, nowadays’ becoming iyaja=kwita ‘right now’.2 This change looks like dissimilation, avoiding a sequence of two syllables with labial velar stop onsets. However, note that no such change occurs in other syllable sequences involving the same onset, as in kwa-kwe ‘go-IMP.SG’, kwa-kware ‘go-REM.PAST’, jikwi-kwisha- ‘cut.offREDUP+CAUS’, etc.

17.2.5. =kamadya ‘ONLY’

The particle =kamadya restricts the reference to the members of a category (as opposed to any other members that could be associated with it).3
In (17.20), =kamadya modifies core NPs.

2 In a few instances this phonological change does apply, as in (10.69) and (10.78b), suggesting that the phonological change is not fully grammaticalized.
3 As we saw in §17.2.3, =kamadya possibly comes from the postposition =kama ‘ONLY’ (§14.3.3) and the focus particle =dya (§17.2.3). As I said in §14.3.3, =kama is probably a loan from Quechua (possibly via Aymara), where it has the related meaning ‘exclusively’. Note however that Quechua also has the form kamalla with the same meaning (W. Adelaar, p.c.), in which case Cavineña could have directly borrowed the two terms.

Another example of =kamadya marking an NP in O function is e-biti=kamadya ‘only her skin’ in (T2.13).
In (17.21), =kamadya modifies an oblique NP.

‘(When we asked the Pacahuara woman where the man was, she didn’t answer anything.) All I could see was her pointing (a finger to his direction).’ pa043

The particle =kamadya is scarcely found modifying a predicate. The only examples found are given in (17.25).

(17.25) a. Kastere-kware=kamadya

‘(I’m going to show you something but) don’t be scared (or anything), Compadre!’ ht013

The particle =kamadya is similarly hardly found on any copula complements. One such rare example is (17.26). Here we have a (derived) adjective in

674 17. Particles — phrasal

CC function within a ‘similarity’ adverbial clause (marked by subordinator =bucha ‘SIMLR’; see §19.4).

‘… we thought that it was not serious (lit. thought about them/the situation as if they (the Araonas) had gotten nothing more than a bit angry.)’ T1.5

In very few examples, kamadya is a phonologically independent word (not a phrasal particle) in fronted position. Its meaning as such is possibly ‘the only thing is that…’ as in (T1.13). More work is required on this topic.

17.2.6. =tere ‘ONLY’

The phrasal particle =tere is rare in the data; there are about 10 examples available. Its meaning is apparently the same as =kamadya ‘ONLY’, i.e., it restricts reference to the members of a category. It is found marking NPs in core functions, as in (17.27a-b), adjectives in CC function, as in (17.27c), and postpositional phrases, as in (17.27d).

‘(At the time there was no chain saw or anything so) it was only with axes (that one would work).’ ab170

The phrasal particle =tere is likely to be historically related to the intransitive verb tere- ‘finish’. Note that there is also a verbal Aktionsart suffix -tere/-tirya which indicates that the S/O argument is completely affected by the verb event (see §7.1.1) and which is quite transparently related to the same verb.

17.2.7. =piisi ‘JUST’

The particle =piisi is only found in a few examples. This particle is used to contrast the information that is expressed by the constituent it is attached to with some other information.
In (17.28), =piisi is found on an independent pronoun.

678 17. Particles — phrasal

17.2.9. =ama ‘NEG’

The particle =ama is the all purpose negation marker in Cavineña. Its most common function is to negate a verbal predicate, as illustrated in (17.35), where it negates transitive predicates, and (17.36), where it negates intransitive predicates.

The predicate of an imperative clause cannot be negated by =ama but requires special inflectional verbal affixes (-ume ‘IMP.SG.NEG’ and ne-…-ume ‘IMP.NSG.NEG’; see §6.2.1).
One verbal suffix, the Aktionsart -jeri/-neri is sensitive to the polarity of the predicate. The form -jeri occurs when the predicate is positive, as in pakaka-jeri-chine ‘I almost fell’, while the form -neri occurs when the predicate is negative, as in tawi-neri-ya=ama=dya ‘they almost did not sleep’; see §7.1.3 for the full examples.

The particule =ama is used to negate independent attributive adjectives (§11.3). Recall that these adjectives, unlike da-adjectives, cannot be negated via the suffix -dama ‘NEG’ (§11.2.4). An example of =ama negating yukeneri ‘intelligent’ is provided in (17.42).

The phrasal particle =piji is an all purpose diminutive marker. It can be used in a broad range of situations, attached to all sort of constituents, with the effect of downplaying what is said. Some of the nuances that can be expressed by =piji will be illustrated by looking at various examples, ordered by the type of constituent marked.

There is some evidence that the particle =piji has lost its phrasal clitic status (and become lexicalized) in at least 4 words, listed in Table 17.4.

17.2. Phrasal particles 687

Table 17.4. Words containing a formative piji

Words ebakwapiji ‘small child’ jidapiji ‘beautiful’ riyapiji ‘a little’ pijidyane ‘CLOSE TO’

Word class ind. noun (§12.5) ind. adjective (§11.3) ind. particle (§16.1) postposition (§14.4.9)

Origin of the base noun ebakwa ‘child’ (§12.5) da-adjective ji- ‘good’ (§11.2) demonstrative riya ‘here’ (§15.8) particle =dyane ‘APPROX’ (§17.2.8)

The lexicalization of =piji within ebakwapiji can be seen when this word is pluralized with the clitic marker =kwana (§13.3). This marker has its scope over an NP head only and, as a result, always comes before =piji ‘DIM’, as in (17.52a,b). But when =kwana marks ebakwapiji, =kwana follows piji, as in (17.52c).

(17.52) a. karusune=kwana=piji pant=PL=DIM
‘little pants’ nk035

b. jae wiri=kwana=piji fish tiny=PL=DIM
‘tiny little fish.’ di2874

c. ebakwapiji=kwana small.child=PL
‘small children’

It is likely that ebakwa=kwana=piji might still be allowed, although not attested in the data. However, the point here is that the order piji=kwana should not be allowed if piji has not lost it phrasal clitic status.4
In the case of jidapiji ‘beautiful’, the lexicalization of =piji is suggested by the change in meaning, from ‘a bit good’ (diminutive reading). A similar argument holds for riyapiji ‘a little bit’, from riya ‘this, here’, and pijidyane ‘close to’, from =dyane ‘approximately’.

17.2.12. =ebari ‘INTENS’
The phrasal particle =ebari ‘INTENSifier’ is only found in a handful of examples where it is used with non-inflecting verbs, adjectives in CC function and (in one example) a locative pro-form in CC function. In all cases, it has an intensifying meaning.

4 It is possible that the same thing happens with piji within ebakujuna(=)piji ‘small girl’. Unfortunately I do not have examples of this word marked with the plural clitic.

The particle =jutidya/=jutii ‘DISEMPHatic’ indicates that a referent, property, state or event expressed by a constituent is not as good/impressive as one would have expected from the context. The form =jutii is only found in a few examples and with the exact same meaning; cf. (17.58a) and (17.60) below.
Note that =jutidya/=jutii resembles =piji ‘DIM’ in meaning. The main difference is that =piji ‘DIM’ never carries any sense of expectation not fulfilled.

Particles in the left column correspond to the first member of a sequence while particles in the top horizontal row correspond to the second member. Illustrative examples available in the preceding sections are crossreferenced, as well as a few more examples provided below. Combinations which are attested in either orders are coded by cells with borders. Note that =dyane ‘APPROX’, =ni ‘NOT.EVEN’ and =jipenee ‘ALMOST’ are not included. This so because they never co-occur with any other phrasal particles in the data.
The combination of =ama ‘NEG’ and =jari ‘STILL’ is illustrated in (17.71).

Chapter 18 Non-finite adverbial clauses

Non-finite adverbial clauses involve a non-finite verb marked by a dependency marker. A general overview of the morpho-syntax of these clauses is provided in §18.1.
I have identified three major types of non-finite adverbial clauses: (1) samesubject temporal clause (§18.2), (2) general purpose clause (§18.3), and (3) purpose of motion clause (§18.4).
In addition, two minor types of non-finite adverbial clauses are discussed in §18.5: (1) cause clause (§18.5.1), and ‘just before’ clause (§18.5.2). These clauses are very rare in the data and might be archaic.

18.1. Morpho-syntactic introduction

18.1.1. Finiteness

Non-finite adverbial clauses have a non-finite verb, i.e., a verb stripped of its inflectional TAM markers, and a marker of dependency. They have no second position clitics, therefore no marking of categories expressed in second position in main clauses, such as reportative and the likes, and especially no bound pronouns. The verb of a non-finite adverbial clause must come last (unlike in main clauses where the verb can occur in any position). It is stripped of its inflectional affixes but can still retain non-inflectional affixes. These characteristics can be illustrated with an example of a general purpose clause in (18.1). As we can see, the verb iji- ‘drink’ takes two non-inflectional suffixes; it is marked with the dependency marker =ishu ‘PURP.GNL’; it takes two non-inflectional suffixes: the causativizer of transitive verbs -mere and the Aktionsart suffix of motion -ti.

700 18. Non-finite adverbial clauses

The dependency markers are all — with one exception — enclitics, as with =ishu ‘PURP.GNL’ in (18.1). Only one dependency marker is a suffix, -(a)tsu, which marks same-subject temporal clauses.
Arguments only surface when not co-referent with arguments of the controlling clause. When overtly expressed, S and O arguments are unmarked, as in main clauses. A arguments never surface within same-subject temporal clauses and purpose of motion clauses, a consequence of the fact that these clauses obligatorily share their subject with the subject of the controlling clause. In general purpose clauses, an overt A argument receives genitive/dative (instead of ergative) marking, as shown in (18.2).

‘(The Pacahuara woman first gave us five fish to take away.) Then, she brought more fish, (this time) for us (dl) to eat there.’ pa097

Note that with the two remaining types of non-finite adverbial clauses, cause clauses and ‘just before’ clauses, there is insufficient data available to know how argument marking is realized.

18.1.2. Subordination

Non-finite adverbial clauses are subordinated (similarly to finite adverbial clauses; see Chapter 19). They have the status of main clause constituents (like an NP, a PP, the predicate, etc.).
The first piece of evidence is the freedom of positioning of non-finite adverbial clauses. They can occur last, as in (18.1) and (18.2), or first, as in (18.3a). Finally, they can occur between other main clause constituents, as in (18.3b) where the same-subject temporal clause ebi rirutsu ‘extending the arm’ occurs between the second constituent, the O argument kuchiru ‘machete’, and the third (and last) constituent, the verb ina-kware ‘grab-REM.PAST’.

[e-biO riru-tsu] ina-kware. NPF-arm extend-SS grab-REM.PAST

‘Finally, he extended his arm and grabbed the machete.’ na018

The second piece of evidence is second position clitic placement. These are invariably attached to the last phonological word of the first main clause constituent. In (18.2), for example, the second position clitic =tu ‘3SG(-FM)’ is attached to the independent particle tuekedya. In (18.3b), the sequence =tu-ja =tu ‘=3SG-DAT =3SG(-FM)’ is attached to the independent particle chamakama. Crucially, when a non-finite adverbial clause comes first, the second position clitics are attached to the last of the phonological words of this clause. This can be seen in (18.3a), where the second position clitic sequence =tu-ja =tu ‘3SG-DAT =3SG(-FM)’ is attached to kwa-atsu, i.e., the last phonological word of the same-subject temporal clause.
A non-finite adverbial clause can be embedded within another non-finite (or finite) adverbial clause. It is thus important to distinguish between ‘controlling’ clause and ‘main clause’. This is for instance the case in (18.3a), where we have a purpose of motion clause (babi=ra) embedded within (and controlled by) a same-subject temporal clause (kwa-atsu), which is itself embedded within (and controlled by) the main clause (… =tuja =tu tsuru-kware peadya matuja). Three pieces of evidence suggest that the purpose of motion clause is embedded and controlled by the same-subject temporal clause and not by the main clause in this example. First, the second position clitics =tuja =tu are attached to the same-subject temporal clause verb kwa-atsu, which suggest that the purpose of motion clause and the same-subject temporal clause form a single main clause constituent. Second, it is a fact that purpose of motion clauses can only be controlled by motion verbs (see §18.4); as such babi=ra can be controlled by kwa‘go’, i.e., the same-subject temporal clause verb, but not by tsuru- ‘meet’, i.e., the main clause verb. Third, semantically, it is clear that ‘hunting’ is the purpose of ‘going’, not of ‘meeting (a caiman)’.

18.2. Same-subject temporal clause
The suffix -(a)tsu ‘Same-subject temporal clause marker’ fills the inflectional slot of the predicate (Slot K; see §5.1). It derives a verb that heads a non-finite adverbial clause.
Same-subject temporal clauses (SS-temporal clauses) are by far the most frequently used type of adverbial clause in Cavineña discourse, whether finite

702 18. Non-finite adverbial clauses

or non-finite. In T1, for example, SS-temporal clauses are found in 17 % of the sentences (26 SS-temporal clauses out of 153 sentences).
The form -atsu occurs on monosyllabic verbal stems, as shown in (18.4a). The form -tsu occurs on polysyllabic verbal stems, as shown in (18.4b), with monomorphemic stems, and (18.4c), with bi-morphemic stems based on the same roots as in (18.4a).

18.2.1. Function

SS-temporal clauses have three major functions. The first function is to encode sequences of events. As such, SS-temporal clauses always precede their controlling verb and, iconically, the event expressed by the SS-temporal clause immediately precedes in time the event expressed by the controlling verb. This function is illustrated in (18.5).

18.2. Same-subject temporal clause 703

The second function of SS-temporal clauses is to modify the predicate of their controlling clause as a manner adverb would. In (18.6), for example, ajetsu specifies the (walking) manner of ‘going’.

‘I will go down (from the cart) and I will go walking (*I will walk and I will go).’ ka456

The third function of SS-temporal clauses is to repeat and background information for discourse cohesion. This use of SS-temporal clauses corresponds to what has been termed ‘tail-head linkage’ or ‘lexical overlap’ in the literature (Thompson and Longacre 1985: 209 ff.). In this function, SS-temporal clauses can either precede or follow their controlling verb. Preposed SS-temporal clauses tend to repeat the information expressed by the immediately preceding sentence, as in the following text excerpts. Note that (18.8c) repeats (18.3a).

Unlike preposed SS-temporal clauses, postposed SS-temporal clauses appear to allow for the repetition of much older information. In the story from which the following excerpts have been taken, for example, the event ‘falling from a mango tree’ which is expressed by the SS-temporal clause in (18.12b), is introduced 18 sentences earlier, as (18.12a).

The suffix -(a)tsu is a verbal suffix. Words from other word classes require a copula clause, in which case the copula verb ju- ‘be’ carries the suffix -(a)tsu. This is illustrated with an adjective in (18.13).

18.2.2. Same-subject co-reference

A SS-temporal clause obligatorily shares at least its subject (S/CS or A) with the subject (S/CS or A) of the controlling clause. Table 18.1 summarizes the different combinations of S/CS and A arguments found in the examples illustrated above. Note that S and CS arguments, which behave in all respects similarly in Cavineña, have been lumped together under the label S.

Example number
(18.5b), (18.12b) (18.8b) (18.10b), (18.11b) (18.5a,c), (18.9b)1

One corollary to the same-subject co-reference requirement is that the subject of a SS-temporal clause is always omitted. On the other hand, any other participants (core or oblique) and clausal constituents, can be expressed and if so, they receive the same marking as if they were in a main clause — see the object of a transitive verb in (18.10a) and (18.11b), a locative postpositional

1 Note that in these three examples, the SS-temporal clause and its controlling clause also share their O argument. This is not a requirement, however, as shown by examples such as (18.3b).

18.3. General purpose clause 707
phrase in (18.5b) and (18.9b), a perlative postpositional phrase in (18.12b), and a purpose of motion (non-finite) clause in (18.8b).

18.3. General purpose clause
General purpose clauses are marked by =ishu ‘PURPose GeNeraL’. This type of clause is used to express a purpose towards which the event encoded by the controlling clause predicate is oriented. Unlike purpose of motion clauses — which have the requirement that their controlling verb be a verb of motion; see §18.4 below — general purpose clauses occur with any type of verb (including motion verbs).
General purpose clauses have two notable features. First, the A argument of a transitive verb, when overtly expressed, is marked with the genitive case (or dative case since these are homophonous), unlike in main clauses where it would receive ergative marking. This is discussed under §18.3.2. The second feature is the possibility to omit the verb. This is discussed under §18.3.3.
General purpose clauses are structurally very (but not entirely) similar to postpositional phrases. This is discussed under §18.3.4.

Questioning the general purpose of an event is realized by marking the non-inflecting verb a(i) ju- ‘do what’ with =ishu. Note first that the auxiliary is omitted. Note also the coalescence of the sequence of the two i vowels into one i vowel — this is an idiosyncratic process since other sequences of i vowels

18.3.2. Structure

A general purpose clause and its controlling clause often — but not necessarily — share one (or more) of their arguments. In the sample of examples provided above, in addition to the few that follow, we have the following situations — note that S and CS arguments have been lumped together under the label S.

A noteworthy aspect of general purpose clause structure is the genitive (or dative) marking of transitive subjects, as seen in (18.16a,c) and (18.21).

Note that this phenomenon is not attested in any other types of clauses in Cavineña.

18.3.3. Headless general purpose clauses

There is a peculiar phenomenon whereby the verbal head is omitted. We are left with the purpose marker =ishu attached directly to one constituent of the general purpose clause that has not been omitted (a core argument, an oblique argument or a particle).2
The argument which has been left out can be the transitive subject. It is then marked, as expected, with the genitive/dative marker =ja, as in (18.22).

‘After saying that, we made our secretary (of the Indigenous organization) type (lit. affect) a letter for the government (to help us solve the conflict in the Araona community).’ T1.16

2 Note that, alternatively, one could say that =ishu simply functions as a postposition in these constructions. This possibility is discussed in §18.3.4 below.

‘Ask (sg) for water for the child from his mother (so that he can drink)!’ n4.0465

The argument which has been left out can also be the transitive object or the intransitive subject. However, it is not possible to distinguish between the two formally. This can only be guessed on semantic grounds, considering the type of argument (human versus animate versus inanimate) and the context. In the examples in (18.23), for example, it is likely that the argument that is left out is a transitive object.

18.3.4. Nominalization?

There are striking similarities between general purpose clauses and noun phrases:

1 — the A argument of a general purpose clause, if expressed, takes a marker =ja which has the same form as the genitive marker =ja that is used to refer to a possessor within an NP (§13.4); 2 — the verb of a general purpose clause is non-finite. In §12.7.6, I show that many non-finite verbs can be used as nouns; 3 — the verb of a general purpose clause can be omitted, similarly to the head of an NP in certain contexts (see below). Verbs (except for the copula ju- ‘be’) are never omitted in any other types of clauses.

In light of these observations, one might want to propose an alternative analysis whereby the purpose construction is a nominalized clause (i.e., an NP) — comparable to waka=ja e-tima tsau ‘lower back bone of a cow’ in (18.26) below — and =ishu a postposition. As such the original verb becomes the head noun (comparable to tsau ‘bone’), the original S or O becomes a directly preposed modifier (comparable to e-tima ‘lower back’) and the original A becomes a possessor (comparable to waka=ja ‘of the cow’).

‘The lower back bone of a cow is very big.’ di1271

714 18. Non-finite adverbial clauses

As such, the transitive general purpose clauses in (18.16a), (18.16c) and (18.21) could be literally translated as follows:

(18.16a) (18.16c) (18.21)

‘for her taking of the load’ ‘for our eating’ ‘for my drinking’

As for an intransitive general purpose clause, (18.15a), for example, could literally be translated as:

(18.15a) ‘for the entering of the trucks’

In this work, however, I have decided not to treat general purpose clauses as postpositional phrases for the following three reasons:

1 — in an NP, only a single noun can be directly preposed to the NP head — (noun) phrases and pronouns do not have this option. However, in the case of a general purpose clause, the S or O argument can be a full (noun) phrase. In other words, the S or O argument can include modifiers to the noun, as with the demonstrative tume=ke ‘that’ in tume=ke aikira carga ‘that load’ in (18.16a). Moreover the S or O argument can be a pronoun, as with ekwana ‘1PL’ in (18.16b) or ike ‘1SG’ in (18.20b). 2 — a possessor (genitive phrase within an NP) obligatorily requires a head noun whereas we have seen that the verb (head) of a general purpose clause can be omitted. 3 — an oblique phrase used as a modifier within an NP requires a relative clause strategy, as with Reye=ju=ke in (18.27).

On the other hand, oblique phrases within general purpose clauses receive exactly the same marking as in main clauses, as with e-na=ju ‘in the water’ in (18.15b) or earaki=ju ‘in the food’ in (18.16d).

18.4. Purpose of motion clause 715
18.4. Purpose of motion clause
Purpose of motion clauses specify a goal/intent/reason for a motion event that is encoded by the controlling clause verb. They are marked by the enclitic =ra ‘PURPose of MOTion’. This type of clause only occurs with (essentially intransitive) controlling verbs of motion, such as kwa- ‘go’, je- ‘come’, tsura- ‘go up’, tsajaja- ‘run’, kwinana- ‘emerge’, etc. The subject of the purpose of motion clause is normally co-referential with the subject of the controlling (intransitive) clause — but see discussion around (18.30) below.

18.4.1. Function

In (18.28), I illustrate purpose of motion clauses based on intransitive verbs.

With an intransitive controlling clause verb, the subject of the purpose of motion clause must be co-referential with the subject of the controlling clause (as in all the examples above). Thus we have S(controlling)=S(purpose) in (18.28a-c3) and S(controlling)=A(purpose) in (18.29a-c).
The situation with transitive controlling clause verbs, on the other hand, is problematic, firstly because this situation is only found in the data with two verbs (duju- ‘take’ and kwadisha- ‘send’), and secondly because I have very few examples of these. From the examples available, as from those given in (18.30) below, it seems that purpose of motion clauses require co-referentiality between their subject and the object of the controlling clause. More data is needed to make a more conclusive statement on this issue.

18.4.2. Auxiliaries and copula

If =ra marks a complex predicate, then the auxiliary is obligatorily omitted. The intransitive auxiliary ju- is shown omitted in babi ju- ‘hunt’ in (18.31a), wikamutya ju- ‘fish with hook’ in (18.31b), mere ju- ‘work’ (18.31c) and jae ju‘fish with arrows’ in (18.31d).

In (at least) one case, in (18.33) below, it appears that a copula predicate ju‘be’ is omitted from a copula clause — peadya semana ju- ‘be one week’ — within a purpose of motion clause.

Note that this is the only example available of a copula clause used within a purpose of motion clause.

18.4.3. Miscellaneous

There are no specific pro-forms associated with purpose of motion clauses, and the strategy used for this purpose is to mark the interrogative verb a(i) ju- ‘do what’ with =ra ‘PURP.MOT’. This is illustrated in (18.34b), a pedagogical endof-story question (i.e., a question used at the end of a story aiming at verifying if the child-reader has understood the content) corresponding to (18.34a).

18.5. Minor non-finite adverbial clauses

18.5.1. Cause clause

Cause clauses only occur in the speech of elderly people and in the texts collected in the 1970’s by SIL. These clauses are marked by =ra ‘CAUSE’ which is homophonous with the purpose of motion clause marker =ra ‘PURP.MOT’ (§18.4) and the ergative marker =ra ‘ERG’.
From the few examples available, cause clauses have a verb stripped of its inflectional affixes — similarly to purpose of motion clauses. Unfortunately, I have too few examples to discuss argument marking.
One day, in Misión Cavinas, Alfredo Tavo had returned exhausted from a long excursion. As he arrived, he said to me:

The only example of a cause clause with a transitive verb is with iji- ‘drink’. Unfortunately iji=ra has the unexpected meaning ‘from thirst’ (not *‘from drinking’), as in (18.37).

Note that the =ra marker in (18.36a,b) could be analyzed as the purpose of motion clause marker. This would make more sense semantically — ‘from thirst’ is semantically closer to ‘in order to drink’ (purpose of motion clause marker reading) than ‘from drinking’ (cause clause reading). However, iji=ra is here used with non-motion verbs such as maju- ‘die’ and tere- ‘finish’, which does not normally happen with purpose of motion clauses.

18.5.2. ‘Just before’ clause

‘Before’ clauses are marked by =wie ‘JUST BEFORE’. They are used to express an event that is on the brink of occurring when the event of the controlling clause verb occurs. There are no argument co-reference requirements.
I illustrate the marker =wie in (18.38).

Chapter 19 Finite adverbial clauses

Finite adverbial clauses differ from non-finite clauses in that their verb must take a TAM inflectional marker — a non-finite clause verb cannot take any of these markers (see Chapter 18). A general overview of the morpho-syntax of finite adverbial clauses is given in §19.1.
I have identified four major types of adverbial clauses: (1) different-subject temporal clause, marked by =ju ‘DS’ (§19.2), (2) reason clause, marked by =tibu ‘REASON’ (§19.3), (3) ‘similarity’ clause, marked by =bucha ‘SIMLR’ (§19.4), and (4) conditional clause, marked by =ke juatsu ‘COND’ (§19.5). These types of clause are well attested in the available data and represent synchronically productive structures.
In addition to the major adverbial clauses, I briefly exemplify (and very tentatively discuss) a number of additional minor adverbial finite clauses: (1) ‘thanks to’ clause, marked by =ademe (§19.6.1), (2) concessive clause, marked by amaka or pa-…=amabucha ‘EVEN.THOUGH’ (§19.6.2), and (3) simultaneity clause, marked by mekeeke or tsunumee ‘WHILE’ (§19.6.3). These clauses are very scarce in the data and are likely to be archaic structures.

19.1. Morpho-syntactic introduction

19.1.1. Finiteness

Finite adverbial clauses have a finite verb, i.e., a verb inflected with a TAM marker, and a marker of dependency.
An example of a transitive reason clause is shown in (19.1).

(19.1)

[E-raA butseeju salonO ina-ya=tibu] 1SG-ERG first.time rifle grab-IMPFV=REASON

=tu-raA =ØO

ejene-kware=ama.

=3SG-ERG (=1SG-FM) believe-REM.PAST=NEG

‘Because it was the first time I was using (lit. grabbing) a rifle, she (my sister-in-law) did not believe me (when I told her that I had killed a deer).’ sl067

The dependency marker =tibu expresses the semantic relation of reason. The verb in this example takes the TAM inflectional suffix -ya ‘IMPFV’. Imperative

724 19. Finite adverbial clauses
inflectional affixes (including imperative, hortative and jussive markers; §6.2) are never used in adverbial clauses. Reason clauses allow for the full range of TAM markers. Some other clause types can only take a selection of these markers. For example different-subject temporal clauses can only take the imperfective -ya, the perfect -wa and the potential e-…-u. In the case of non-inflectional affixes, they are potentially all possible with any type of adverbial clause.
The core argument NPs, when overtly expressed, receive the same (ergative/absolutive) marking as in a main clause. In (19.1), for example, the A is expressed by an ergative independent pronoun and the O by an unmarked NP. Finite adverbial clauses also have the same possibilities of taking adjunct constituents as in main clauses; see for example the independent particle butseeju ‘(for) the first time’ in (19.1).
However, adverbial clauses are not equivalent to a main clause. First, they are marked for dependency and cannot stand by themselves. Second, the verb of an adverbial clause always comes last whereas the verb of a main clause can occur anywhere. Third, finite adverbial clauses have fewer possibilities for expressing grammatical categories. Notably, first and second position morphemes, whether particles or bound pronouns, cannot be expressed.

19.1.2. Subordination

Finite adverbial clauses in Cavineña are subordinate because they function similarly to any main clause constituent (e.g., core NP, postpositional phrase, independent particle, etc.). The first piece of evidence for their subordinate status is the placement of second position clitics in sentences that include a finite adverbial clause. These clitics are invariably attached to the last phonological word of the first constituent of the main clause. Crucially, they are attached to the last phonological word of a finite adverbial clause if this clause comes first. In (19.2), for example, the second position reportative particle =pa is attached to kayuama-wa=tibu because the reason adverbial clause barepa kayuamatiwa=tibu is the first constituent of the main clause. If this were not the case, ijeti ‘sun’ would be the first constituent of the main clause and =pa would have been attached to it.

sky

deteriorate-PERF=REASON =REP sun disappear-PERF

‘Because the weather (lit. sky) had turned bad, the sun had disappeared.’ se015b

The second piece of evidence comes from the fact that similarly to any main clause constituents, finite adverbial clauses have the possibility to ‘move

19.2. Different-subject temporal clause 725

around’ and occupy any possible position. The sentence in (19.3) for example shows the conditional clause tawi-ya=ke juatsu occurring between the first constituent re-wa ‘here-LOC’ and the second and last constituent tawi-ya=dya.

tawi-ya=dya. sleep-IMPFV=FOC

‘If you (dl) are going to sleep, then you (dl) might as well sleep here (in my house).’ ka115

Note however that first or final positions are generally preferred by most adverbial clauses.

19.2. Different-subject temporal clause

19.2.1. Semantics

Different-subject temporal clauses (DS-temporal clauses) are marked by the enclitic =ju ‘DS’. Their main function is to express temporal settings for their controlling clause predicate.
Examples with preposed DS-temporal clauses are in (19.4).

(19.4)

‘They cleared a garden. When it (the garden) had dried, they burned it.’ fd016

b. [Tu-raA mare-wa=ju] =tuS

pakaka-wa.

3SG-ERG shoot.at-PERF=DS =3SG(-FM) fall-PERF

‘He (Lucio) shot at iti (the porcupine) and iti fell down.’ ij022

See also ‘when I was still a leader…’ in (T1.1). Example (19.5) comes from a recorded conversation of a group of Cavineña
men doing community work. In the middle of the conversation a foreigner (a merchant who does not speak Cavineña) arrived and everybody switched to Spanish. As the conversation (in Spanish) went on, I decided to turn the tape-

726 19. Finite adverbial clauses

recorder off until the conversation was resumed in Cavineña. After this happened a couple of times, my turning-on-and-off of the tape recorder was noticed by Vidal Mayo, who informed his workmates as follows:

(19.5)

[PeyaS kisarati-ya=ju] =tu-ja =tuO other talk-IMPFV=DS =3SG-DAT =3SG(-FM)
tikwa-nuka-ya. extinguish-REITR-IMPFV
‘When the other (the foreigner) talks, he (the linguist) turns it (his tape-recorder) off!’ tb046

Examples with postposed DS-temporal clauses are in given (19.6).

Examples of DS-temporal clauses based on copula clauses (with omitted predicate) are given in (19.7a), with an NP as CC, (19.7b), with an adjective as CC, and (19.7b), with a locative / adverbial demonstrative pro-form as CC.

DS-temporal clause predicates make the most use of the aspectual inflectional markers -ya ‘IMPFV’ and -wa ‘PERF’ to express a simultaneous vs. sequential contrast between the temporal clause event and the controlling clause event. The marker -ya ‘IMPFV’ expresses simultaneity: both events occur at the same time, as in (19.5) and (19.6b) above. The marker -wa ‘PERF’ expresses sequence: the controlling clause event occurs/begins when the temporal clause event is completed, as in (19.4a,b) and (19.6a) above.
The tense inflectional markers -chine ‘REC.PAST’ and -kware ‘REM.PAST’ are not attested in DS-temporal clauses. The potential circumfix e-…-u ‘POT’, on the other hand does show up in a few examples, as shown in (19.8).

728 19. Finite adverbial clauses

See also (T1.61), (T1.70). Phrasal particles that would normally cliticize on the predicate of a main
clause can also be used within DS-temporal clauses, as with the negative particle =ama in (19.9).

‘(The rifle of Lucio, who wanted to kill the porcupine, did not work.) As the rifle didn’t want to work (lit. burst), he (Lucio) went to another house (to ask for another rifle).’ ij019

See also =jari ‘STILL’ in (T1.1). The reader will have probably noted that the DS-temporal clause marker =ju
‘DS’ is homophonous with the locative postposition =ju ‘LOC’; see, e.g., peya e-tare=ju ‘to another house’ in (19.9). Adding to this the fact that, in Cavineña, RCs are structurally similar to finite adverbial clauses and can have adverbial meanings (see Chapter 20), one might want to analyze DS-temporal clauses as relative clauses within locative phrases. A discussion of the evidence for treating these two types of constructions as different is in §20.6.2.

19.2.2. Tail-head linkage

Quite similarly to SS-temporal clauses (§18.2), DS-temporal clauses can be used to repeat information, typically the main predicate of the immediately preceding sentence. As discussed in §18.2, this is called ‘tail-head linkage’ or ‘lexical overlap’ in the literature (Thompson and Longacre 1985: 209 ff.). Two examples are provided in (19.10).

‘Then they took me (who was lying unconscious) home. After they had taken me home, I recovered consciousness (lit. I saw myself).’ mg020-030

19.2.3. ‘Switch-reference’

DS-temporal clauses are the only type of adverbial clause that require a different subject from their controlling clause. Apart from this restriction, the two clauses can share, or not share, any of their arguments, as shown in Table 19.1. Note that S and CS arguments are lumped together under the label S.

Table 19.1. Co-reference possibilities between a DS-temporal clause and its controlling clause

DS-temporal clause S O O/A no shared argument

Controlling Clause O S A/O

Example number (19.4a), (19.10a) (19.4b), (19.10b) (19.6a) (19.5), (19.8a,b), (19.9)

Note that the pair made by dependent clauses marked by -(a)tsu, which have temporal meanings and must share their subject with the subject of the controlling clause (§18.2), and dependent clauses marked by =ju is functionally very close to a switch-reference system (as per Haiman and Munro 1983). Formally, however, these are clearly distinct clause types, in which case we don’t have, strictly speaking, a switch-reference system per se. In other words, Cavineña does not have a single clause type that would manifest both same-subject and different-subject situations. Rather, what we have are different co-reference constraints associated with different clause types.

730 19. Finite adverbial clauses

19.3. Reason clause

The marker =tibu marks a clause that gives a reason for the occurrence of the event manifested by its controlling clause. Its semantics is roughly similar to the English subordinators ‘because’ or ‘since’.

19.3.1. Semantics

In (19.11) and (19.2) (repeated), I illustrate intransitive reason clauses.

Reason clause verbs can take the full range of verbal morphology. In the preceding examples, for instance, I have -wa ‘PERF’ in (19.11a) and -ya ‘IMPFV’ in (19.11b). Unlike DS-temporal clauses, reason clause verbs also take the past marker -chine ‘REC.PAST’, as in (19.13b), and -kware ‘REM.PAST’, as in (19.14).

There are no co-reference restrictions between a reason clause and its controlling clause, as shown by Table 19.2, which summarizes the situations found in earlier examples. Note that S and CS arguments have been lumped together under the label S.

19.4. Similarity clause 733

19.4. Similarity clause
The enclitic =bucha ‘SIMiLaR’ marks a clause that expresses a situation the controlling clause event is (unexpectedly) similar to. It is roughly equivalent to the English subordinator ‘as (if), like, similar to’. As with reason clauses, there are no co-reference restrictions between the similarity clause and the controlling clause. There are also two (possibly) synonymous ‘similarity’ clause markers, =bae and =jiu, that will be briefly illustrated at this end of this section.

19.4.1. Semantics

‘Similarity’ clauses are very frequently used with perception verbs such as ba- ‘see, feel internally’, baka- ‘hear, understand’, adeba- ‘know, remember’, etc., as illustrated in (19.18c). Other examples are provided in (19.19).

In all the examples available of ‘similarity’ clauses, there is always an argument in common with their controlling clause; more work is needed to determine whether this is obligatory. On the other hand, there does not appear to be any particular pattern of co-reference, as shown by the various argument sharing situations summarized in Table 19.3.

A few examples are available of two additional similarity clause markers =bae ‘SIMLR’ and =jiu ‘SIMLR’. They are each illustrated with an example in (19.21).

These two subordinate clause markers need to be investigated. They are likely to show some semantic differences from =bucha and from each other. Note that in (19.21b) we have both markers =bucha and =jiu occurring in the same sentence.

19.4.2. Pro-form

‘Similarity’ clauses can be questioned with the specific pro-form ejebucha ‘INT:SIMLR’ as in (19.22).

19.5. Conditional clause
Conditional clauses are marked by the combination of an enclitic =ke and the (grammatically and phonologically) independent word juatsu. This is illustrated in (19.23a), which comes from a recorded text, (19.23b), which comes from Camp and Liccardi’s (1989) grammar sketch, and (19.23c), which was volunteered by Francisco Vaca.

Conditional clauses tend to occur sentence-initially, as is the case in the preceding examples. However, this is not obligatory: the examples in (19.3) (repeated) and (19.25) show conditional clauses in other positions.

One example is available of a negated conditional clause. It is given in (19.26). It shows that the negation marker (the general phrasal particle =ama; §17.9) cliticizes on the =ke part of the conditional marker.

Conditional clauses often share an argument with their controlling clause. However, this is not an absolute requirement, as shown by (19.25). Various attested combinations of co-referent arguments are listed in the following table.

19.5. Conditional clause 739
The discontinuous marker =ke juatsu ‘CONDIT’ has probably evolved from a copula clause with its CS co-referent with the subject of the controlling clause and with a headless relative clause as its CC. If this hypothesis is correct, conditional clauses would have originally meant ‘CS being one that V1, S/CS/A V2’. The details are as follows. First, the =ke part of the conditional clause marker is most likely the ligature marker =ke, whose function is to mark a relative clause; in (19.23b), for example kastere-wa=ke would literally mean ‘one who has become tired’. Then, the juatsu part of the conditional clause marker is clearly made of the copula/auxiliary ju- followed by the same-subject clause marker -(a)tsu. We would thus have a copula clause; kastere-wa=ke ju- in (19.23b) would literally mean ‘be one who has become tired’ (i.e., a headless relative clause). If we assume that the same-subject clause marker -(a)tsu has a tail-head linkage / lexical overlap function (repeating preceding information for discourse coherence; see §18.2), we can hypothesize that the complete conditional clause kastere-wa=ke ju-atsu in (19.23b) would literally mean ‘X being one who has become tired, X (can rest for a while)’. Similarly, the conditional clause in (19.23a) would literally mean ‘being one that is (inside the burrow), he (the peccary)…’.
On these grounds, one might want to say that conditional clauses could simply be analyzed as copula clauses after all, and that it is not necessary to set up a distinct clause type. In this work, however, I recognize a separate conditional clause and I treat the combination of the two forms =ke and juatsu as a unique (although discontinuous) conditional morpheme marker. The problems with the copula-clause-with-headless-relative-clause-complement reading arise from the fact that conditional clauses do not require any core argument sharing with the controlling clause and this makes it impossible to have a same-subject reading. In (19.25), for example, a copula clause reading for the conditional clause could only be ‘I being one who died’ with ‘I’ as the subject. It cannot be co-referent to the main clause subject which is ‘your father’s thinking’. As a result it is best to recognize a separate conditional construction clause. Historically, however, the structural similarities between the two constructions makes it fairly clear that the conditional clause has evolved from the copula construction. This also nicely corroborates cross-linguistic findings that copulas are a well attested source for conditional markers (see for example Traugott 1985: 291).
Note that a detailed study of the semantics of conditional clauses in Cavineña remains to be undertaken. For example, it is not clear, at the present time, if and how these clauses can express different degrees of hypotheticality. Let us also remember that Cavineña has other ways to express conditional meanings, notably by way of independent clauses marked by the second position particle =ni ‘MAYBE’. This was discussed in §16.3.2 and illustrated with examples such as (19.27) (repeated).

19.6. Minor finite adverbial clauses

The types of adverbial clauses discussed below are considered minor in the sense that they are very scarce in the data. This is either because they are perhaps archaic constructions or they are very marked and only occur on rare occasions. The discussions that follow are only tentative and require more work.

19.6.1. =ademe ‘THANKS.TO’

The morpheme =ademe is found in about 15 examples. It marks a clause that expresses a reason for a happy situation expressed by the controlling clause. It is illustrated in (19.28a), where it marks a verbal clause, and in (19.28b), where it marks a copula clause (with omitted copula verb).

aje-ya=ama. walk-IMPFV=NEG
‘The pampa is very lush (and could hurt my legs) so I won’t walk (and it’s a good reason for me to sit lazily in the cart).’ ka429

19.6. Minor finite adverbial clauses 741

In some cases, =ademe is attached directly to an NP/noun, as in (19.29).

(19.29)

Chapa=ademe =tu-ja

=tuO

ina-kware=ama.

dog=THANKS.TO =3SG-DAT =3SG(-FM) grab-REM.PAST=NEG

‘(The anaconda missed the man but caught his dog.) Thanks to the dog, he (the man) did not get caught.’ si006b

It is not altogether clear how such examples should be analysed. If chapa=ademe is a clause, there needs to be an omitted predicate: underlyingly, chapa=ademe should then read something like ‘thanks to the dog (being there)’. Another possibility might be that =ademe can function both as a non-finite clauses marker, as in (19.28a,b) and as a postposition, as in (19.29).
More intriguing are cases where =ademe is attached directly to an ergative case marked NP as shown in (19.30).

(19.30) a. Yusurupai, Rubuiba! Mi-ra=ademeA

=ØO

thank.you maned.wolf 2SG-ERG=THANKS.TO (=1SG-FM)

chachane-wa. cure-PERF

[iba=raA e-ara-u=ke]O. jaguar=ERG POT-eat-POT=LIG

‘The tree protected me from being eaten by the jaguar.’ di2208

This suggests that in (19.30a,b) — and perhaps (19.29) as well — =ademe should be analyzed as a particle. It could then either function as a phrasal particle or as a second position particle; note that in all these examples, =ademe is attached to the last phonological word of the first immediate constituent of the main clause. The issue of the exact status of =ademe needs more work.

19.6.2. Concessive clauses
A few examples are available of two types of concessive finite clauses. The first one is marked by the independent marker majaka. The second one is marked by the bound marker =amabucha. In both types of clauses, the word arepa is optionally found at the initial of the clause. The restricted number of examples

742 19. Finite adverbial clauses

available did not allow me to determine whether there are semantic differences between the two types of clauses.
Concessive finite clauses marked by majaka can be first illustrated with the following two sentences constructed by Alfredo Tavo.

least they (dl) kept going.’ ka295

In a recorded text, I found two examples of majaka directly marking the abstract nouns baji ‘fear’ and bisu ‘shame’. These examples are given in (19.33).

shame EVEN.THOUGH HORT.DL-be-GO.TEMP

‘Let’s (dl) go there (and talk to that foreigner) even though we are feeling shy (lit. even though with shame)!’ ka091

The syntax of these examples is not altogether clear and more data is required.
The origin of the concessive marker is most likely the e-noun -majaka ‘place’, illustrated in (19.34).

There are only three examples available of the second type of concessive clause, marked by the discontinuous morpheme (arepa) …=amabucha ‘EVEN.THOUGH’. One example, in (19.35) below, is based on verbal clause.

744 19. Finite adverbial clauses

The remaining two examples are based on copula clauses. Surprisingly, in these examples the copula verb takes a marker pa- (presumably related to the jussive prefix pa-; see §6.2.3).

‘Even though my mother is old, I will leave her again!’ (Camp and Liccardi 1989: 281)

The origin of the concessive marking pa-…=amabucha ‘EVEN.THOUGH’ appears to be the combination of the jussive marker pa- ‘JUSS’ (with copula clauses), the negation particle =ama and the ‘similarity clause’ marker =bucha (see discussion of this marker in §19.4 above). If this reconstruction is correct, the (copula) concessive clause ‘even though my mother is old’ in (19.36b) would have literally been constructed as follows:

1) ‘let my mother be old’ 2) ‘let my mother not be old’ 3) ‘as if to let my mother not be old’

(pa- ‘JUSS’) (pa- ‘JUSS’ + =ama ‘NEG’) (pa- ‘JUSS’ + =ama ‘NEG’ + =bucha ‘SIMLR’)

1 The ‘Sur’ (lit. the South) is the name of a cold wind that occasionally blows from the south during the winter season.

19.6. Minor finite adverbial clauses 745

19.6.3. Simultaneity clauses

There are two attested markers of simultaneous clauses: mekeeke and tsunumee. They are both translated by ‘while’ in English. Too few examples are available to know if there are any semantic differences between the two. Here I provide both with the same glossing.
I have no recorded examples of simultaneity clauses marked by mekeeke. The example in (19.37) comes from a text written by Alfredo Tavo.

‘(The face of the man was covered with the mud that the tricky imp had thrown on him.) As they kept fighting, he washed his face with water.’ du019

The following two examples were volunteered by Alfredo Tavo:

‘While she was washing, he was cooking.’ n2.0910

ju-wa. be-PERF

The origin of mekeeke is unknown. It possibly contains the perlative postposition =eke ‘PERL’. However the formative meke is not found independently from mekeeke.
Three examples are available of simultaneity clauses marked by tsunumee: one comes from Camp and Liccardi’s (1989) dictionary; two comes from recorded texts. The two textual examples are unfortunately too complicated to be used as illustrations. The example from the dictionary is reproduced below.

‘While you will be eating, I will be writing (lit. drawing) a letter.’ (Camp and Liccardi 1989: 278)

The tsunu part of tsunumee might be related to the adjective tsunu- ‘long (time)’. As for the mee part, it is not found independently from tsunumee.

Chapter 20 Relative clauses

Relative clauses (RCs) are structurally similar to finite adverbial clauses. They consist of a clause with an inflected verb and a dependency marker, =ke ‘LIG’ (§20.1).
The ligature morpheme =ke that marks an RC displays idiosyncratic behavior when it enters into certain clitic sequences. Notably it is deleted when it precedes a postpositional enclitic marker (§20.2).
There is a wide range of options for expressing the argument that is common to the RC and the main clause (MC): (1) in the MC but not in the RC, (2) in the RC but not in the MC and (3) neither in the MC nor in the RC (§20.3).
The common argument (CA) can have any function within the MC. Within the RC, there are tendencies — but no absolute requirement — for the CA to be in non-A function within the RC (§20.4).
The main function of relative clauses in Cavineña is to modify the head of an NP. But relative clauses in this language are also used with an adverbial meaning, in which case they rather modify the predicate of a controlling clause (§20.5).
Relative clauses show tendencies to grammaticalize into finite adverbial clauses (§20.6).

20.1. Morpho-syntactic introduction

20.1.1. Finiteness

Similarly to finite adverbial clauses (Chapter 19), a (verbal) RC has a finite verb, i.e., a verb inflected with a TAM marker, and a marker of dependency, =ke ‘LIGature’. In (20.1a), for instance, the RC verb is inflected with the remote past -kware ‘REM.PAST’ while in (20.1b) it is inflected with the potential circumfix marker e-…-u ‘POT’.

‘… we waited two days for trucks that could possibly pass (and give us a ride to Riberalta).’ ga014

The verb of an RC can take the full range of TAM inflectional markers; in addition to -kware and e-…-u illustrated above, see -wa ‘PERF’ in (20.6a), -chine ‘REC.PAST’ in (20.6b), and -ya ‘IMPFV’ in (20.6c)."
Similarly to finite adverbial clauses, the verb of an RC can also take any non-finite verbal affix: see for example -ti ‘GO.TEMP’ in (20.18), -diru ‘GO.PERM’ and -bare ‘DISTR’ in (20.28d), -aje ‘GO.DISTR’ in (20.29), -sha ‘CAUS’ in (20.31a), ka-…-ti ‘REF’ in (20.39), etc.
Similarly to adverbial clauses, the verb of an RC (whether an inflecting verb, an auxiliary verb or a copula verb) obligatorily comes last in the clause. In copula RCs with an omitted copula verb, the copula complement comes last (see §20.1.2).
Similarly to finite adverbial clauses, RCs do not take first or second position particles. This means that RCs do not have bound pronouns. On the other hand, any other main clause constituent (NP, independent pronoun, PP, independent particle, adverbial clause, etc.) can occur in an RC and receive the exact same marking. See for example NPs in A function juye=ra in (20.22c), in S function makina ‘machine’ in (20.24a), independent pronoun in O function ike ‘1SG’ in (20.18), independent pronoun in A function tura ‘3SG.ERG’ in (20.29), independent particles beru in (20.3) and iyaja=kwita in (20.24a), non-finite purpose of motion clause makei iye=ra ‘to kill enemies’ in (20.1a), etc.

In copula relative clauses, the copula verb is typically — although not obligatorily — omitted, regardless of the nature of the CC (predicative adjective, NP, etc.). As we saw, copula omission is also frequent in copula main clauses (§4.6.3). When the copula verb is omitted, the ligature marker =ke is attached to the copula complement which comes last in the RC. This is illustrated in (20.2).

When not omitted, the copula verb must be inflected with a TAM marker, as shown in (20.3), an example volunteered by Alfredo. Note that this is again similar to what happens with copula main clauses (see §4.6.3).

Copula RCs are extremely frequent. Copula RCs with adjectives as CC were illustrated in (20.2). Copula RCs with other types of CCs are exemplified below: NP CC in (20.4a), postpositional phrase CC in (20.4b), locative pro-form CC in (20.4c), independent particles CC in (20.4d) and (20.4e).

20.2. Ligature marker =ke
The relative clause marker =ke (the RC marker) presents a number of idiosyncratic properties when it comes into a sequence with other enclitics.
20.2.1. Ligature deletion rule
Similarly to adverbial clause markers, the relative clause marker =ke ‘LIG’ is attached to the last phonological word of the RC, thus to a verb (lexical verb,

20.2. Ligature marker =ke 751

auxiliary verb or copula verb) or to a copula complement. When the CA (Common Argument) is not in S or O function (which are un-
marked for case) within the MC, the NP formed by the CA and the RC will be marked by a postposition (ergative, genitive, locative, associative, etc.). As we know, most postpositions are enclitics to the last phonological word of the NP (see Chapter 14). We would then expect to have =LIG=PP clitic sequences. But curiously, this never happens. There is a morphological process of deletion of the ligature =ke morpheme when it occurs in the same clitic sequence with a postposition and when it precedes the postposition. This is illustrated in (20.6a), with the CA in A function within the MC, (20.6b), with the CA in locative function within the MC, and (20.6c), with the CA in associative function within MC.

Note that =ke is omitted even if it is not directly adjacent to a postposition,
as long as they belong to the same clitic cluster and the ligature precedes the
postposition. This is illustrated in (20.8), where the number clitic =ekatse ‘DL’ occurs between the ligature phrase and a case marker:2

(20.8)

‘These two vigorous teenagers were eating it (a raw wild turkey).’ hm091

On the other hand, if the ligature does not belong to a clitic cluster together with a postposition, then the ligature does not drop. This happens, for example, in the context of preposed RCs, as in (20.9). Note that the ligature and the postposition are in boldface.

2 The interaction between number markers and RCs is discussed further in the next section.

20.2. Ligature marker =ke 753

The ligature is also retained when the postposition is not an enclitic but a separate phonological word, as with jiteke ‘LOOKING.FOR’ (§14.8.1) in (20.10a) and tupuju ‘FOLLOWING’ (§14.9.4) in (20.10b).

Finally, if the ligature =ke follows (rather than precedes) an enclitic postposition, it is not deleted. This happens when a postpositional phrase in CC function is made of a copula RC, as in (20.11).

20.2.2. Ligature and number markers
Cavineña has three number markers which function within NPs (=kwana ‘PL’, =ekana ‘PL’ and =ekatse ‘DL’). These markers are enclitics to the head noun of the NP or to an NP modifier (see §13.3).
When the plural number marker =kwana ‘PL’ is attached to an RC, as normally happens when the NP head is ellipsed (see §13.3.1), the order is =PL=LIG (not the expected order =LIG=PL), as shown in (20.12).

The plural marker =ekana is limited to kinship nouns. It never occurs on an RC in the data. More work is required to know if =ekana is allowed to mark an RC, and if so, how =ekana would interact with the ligature =ke.

20.2. Ligature marker =ke 755

20.2.3. Ligature and third person ‘possessor’ inflections

There are striking morpho-syntactic similarities between the ligature marker =ke ‘LIG’ and the =ke part of the third person ‘possessor’ inflection e-…=ke ‘3’ found with kinship terms (§12.4):

1 — both are formally identical; 2 — both are enclitics; 3 — both interact similarly with the plural marker =kwana: when =kwana ‘PL’ is attached to a kinship noun marked with e-…=ke ‘3’, =kwana precedes =ke, exactly like =kwana ‘PL’ with respect to the ligature marker =ke ‘LIG’ (see preceding section).

‘Their wives would go from the village (to the forest to meet their husbands, who were hunting there).’ ct037

In addition, it turns out that Cavineña makes use of RCs to express some kinship relations. An example is given in (20.16).

‘Look after (lit. see) your children (lit. the ones whom you see) with patience!’ n4.0403

The similarities in form and behavior between =ke ‘3’ and =ke ‘LIG’ could be an indication of a common historical origin. A possible scenario could be that =ke ‘3’ was derived from =ke ‘LIG’ in relative clause constructions such as (20.16).
However, it is important to stress the fact that synchronically the two markers are clearly different morphemes:

1 — unlike =ke ‘LIG’, =ke ‘3’ is not deleted when it occurs in the same clitic sequence with a postposition (see ligature deletion rule in §20.2.1). As an illustration, compare (20.6a-c) with (20.17).

3-wife=3=ERG BM

see-GO.TEMP-REM.PAST 3SG-FM

‘His wife went to see him.’ mu041

Note that the form e-wane=ra in (20.17) would be grammatical. However, it would then mean ‘my wife’, not ‘his wife’. 2 — semantically =ke ‘3’ (in conjunction with the prefix e-) encodes the person of the possessor whereas =ke ‘LIG’ is a relative clause marker, regardless of the person of the possessor of the NP head it qualifies (if any). In (20.9), for example, the head of the relative clause ju-na-wa=ke ‘who has arrived’ is ‘your aunt’, i.e., it is possessed by a second person.

20.3. Statement of common argument
Cavineña is a language where the common argument (CA) can be stated either within the main clause (MC) or the relative clause (RC) (but never within both) or not stated at all. Whether there are any semantic differences between the two alternatives remains to be investigated.
Three tests have been used to decide where the CA belongs in a particular example:
1 — constituency: when the CA and the RC form separate constituents, then the CA belongs to the MC. When the CA occurs between constituents that clearly belong to the RC (as opposed to the MC), then the CA belongs to the RC. 2 — nature of the CA: if the CA is an (independent) pronoun, then it must belong to the RC. This is so because pronouns cannot be modified in Cavineña (§15.1.1). As a result it is not possible to have an NP with its head as a pronoun and an RC as a modifier. 3 — case marking of the CA: when the function of the CA within the MC is different from the function of the CA within the RC and if both functions are marked differently, the case assigned to the CA indicates where it belongs.

20.3.1. Common argument in main clause, not in relative clause
The CA can be stated within the MC but not within the RC, in which case we have an externally-headed relative clause.
In the following two examples, case marking on the CA proves that the CA belongs to the MC. In (20.18) and (20.19), the CAs, bina ‘bat’ and Rosa respectively, are in S function within the MC and in A function within the RC. As we can see, bina ‘bat’ and Rosa are unmarked for case. This correlates with their S

20.3. Statement of common argument 757

function within the MC but not with their A function within the RC (since the A function requires overt ergative marking). This shows that both bina and Rosa belong to the MC but not to the RC.

In (20.20), the CA, kani ‘hole’, is in O function within the MC and in LOC function within the RC. The CA is unmarked, accordingly to its O function but not accordingly to its LOC function (which would be marked by =ju or some related postposition). The CA thus belongs to the MC, not to the RC.

Note that the position of the RC vis-à-vis a CA stated externally is not rigid. The most common situation is for the RC to directly follow the CA, as in (20.18), (20.19), (20.20) and (20.21). But it can as well directly precede it, as in (20.23a-d), or be discontinuous, as in (20.22a-c).

3 Note that it is not clear how internally-headed RCs relate to the slot model that I have proposed for the NP structure in Cavineña (§4.4.1 and §12.1). I do not know, for example, where NP modifiers would occur (providing they can occur), since no such modifiers happen to be present in the examples of internally-headed RCs available in the data. This requires additional work.

In (20.26), in addition to being expressed by pronouns (which is a sufficient criterion for saying that the CA belongs to the RC), the CA is case-marked according to its function within the RC (locative in a., reason in b.) but not according to its function within the MC (E — i.e, extended argument — in a., O in b.). Moreover, in a., the CA occurs within RC constituents while in b., the CA forms a constituent together with RC constituents with respect to the placement of the second position clitics.

20.3.4. Ambiguity

In many cases, it is impossible to decide whether the CA belongs to the MC or the RC. In (20.29), for example, none of the tests provide any clue as to which, of the MC or of RC, the CA belongs to: the CA jae ‘fish’ is an O both within the MC and the RC; it is a noun (not a pronoun); it does not occur between MC or RC constituents.

Similar situations are found with (20.1a), where the CA is in CS function within the MC and in S function within the RC (both being unmarked for case) and (20.1b), where the CA is in O function within the MC and in S function within RC (again, both being unmarked for case).

20.4. Common argument functions

There are no restrictions whatsoever as to which function the CA can play within the MC. As for the function of the CA within the RC, there are strong tendencies — but apparently no strict restrictions either — for the CA to be in non-A function and non-genitive function. This is shown in Table 20.1 below, which summarizes all the combinations attested in the data and corresponding examples. Note that S and CS arguments, which behave in all respects similarly in Cavineña, have been lumped together under the label S.

The tendency for Cavineña relativization to avoid having a CA in GEN function within the RC corroborates Keenan and Comrie’s (1977) ‘NP accessibility hierarchy’ which states that possessors are the least relativizable of all grammatical functions. However, the tendency for avoiding a CA in A function in Cavineña does not fully corroborate their statement that subjects are more relativizable than other functions (notably objects). In Cavineña, S and O appear to be more relativizable than A. What would better account for the facts of Cavineña relativization is an ergative-type hierarchy (i.e., S/O > A > etc. rather than Subject > Object > etc.), as proposed by other authors such as Dixon (1994: 130) in his discussion of Dyirbal (Australian).

20.5. Relative clause functions

20.5.1. Restrictive vs. non-restrictive

Cavineña RCs can have a restrictive function, in which case their role is to help identify a unique referent among a choice of possible referents, as in (20.30).

See also (20.1a), (20.22a,b), (20.23a) and (20.24c). Cavineña RCs can also have a non-restrictive function, in which case the CA
already has unique reference and the RC simply provides additional information on that referent. Examples of non-restrictive RCs are given in (20.1b), (20.25a) and (20.25b).
Non-restrictive RCs often have adverbial meanings; that is, they sometimes can only be translated by adverbial clauses in English. Examples are provided in (20.31).

20.5.2. Tail-head linkage

Non-restrictive RCs can be used to repeat information for discourse coherence. Typically, the RC repeats the main predicate of the immediately preceding sentence — recall that this discourse function, called ‘tail-head linkage’ or ‘lexical overlap’ in the literature, is also performed by SS-temporal clauses (§18.2) and DS-temporal clauses (§19.2.2). In (20.32), for example, we have a sequence of two sentences. The RC from the second sentence consists of the repetition of the main verb of the first sentence.

The same phenomenon can be observed twice in (20.33). The first and the second sentences are separated by 2 intervening sentences (which provide side comments). The second and the third sentences follow one another.

As I said tail-head linkage is also a function of SS-temporal clauses (§18.2) and DS-temporal clauses (§19.2.2). SS-temporal clauses and DS-temporal clauses have a complementary function and are used in complementary distribution — SS-temporal clauses are used when their subject is co-referential with the subject of the MC while DS-temporal clauses are used when their subject is different from the subject of the MC. It is not clear how RCs with a tail-head linkage function fit into this pattern. As it seems, an ‘adverbial’ RC whose subject is co-referential with the subject of the MC could be substituted by an SStemporal clause. And an ‘adverbial’ RC whose subject is non-co-referential with the subject of the MC could be substituted with a DS-temporal clause. More work is required on this topic.

20.6. Grammaticalization of relative clauses

20.6.1. Relative clause relating to core argument

There are grounds to believe that RCs with adverbial meanings are developing into true independent adverbial clauses. The first piece of evidence is that, occasionally, speakers do not use ergative marking with RCs whose CA is in A function within the MC. This happens in (20.36), an example extracted from a text by Francisco Vaca. Here, there are two RCs with adverbial meanings. In both cases, the CA is in S function within the RC: ‘as I was going’ and ‘as they were passing by’. In the second RC, the CA is in O function within the MC and is accordingly unmarked for case. In the first RC, however, the A function of the CA is not marked as expected: it is unmarked whereas it should have received ergative marking (as in (20.31b) or (20.31c) above).

In some examples, the CA can be a full pronoun outside of the RC; recall that a CA can only be expressed by a pronoun within an RC (see §20.3). This

770 20. Relative clauses

can be seen in (20.37), for example.

‘Coming from the garden (lit. I, who was coming…), I saw a bird.’ di0993

Note that in this example, similarly to (20.36), the RC does not receive the expected ergative marking corresponding to the A function of the CA within the MC
With RCs with adverbial meanings, there are cases where there is not, strictly speaking, a CA between the RC and the MC or where the identity of the CA is quite unclear. In (20.38), for example, juye ‘an ox’ is the S referent within the MC but is (at best) only part of the S referent within RC (which also includes ‘us’ and the other ox).

‘As we were going our way in the pampa (along with a pair of oxen pulling our cart), an ox fell down.’ ft053

In (20.39), the referent of the S argument of the RC, ‘crossing the river’ includes the addressee ‘you’, in A function within the MC and ‘the children’, in O function within the MC. In other words, it is quite unclear what the grammatical function of the CA is within the MC.

20.6.2. Relative clause vs. different-subject temporal clauses
It was observed in §19.2 that the different-subject temporal clause marker =ju ‘DS’ is homophonous with the locative postposition =ju ‘LOC’. It was also noted in §20.1.1 that RCs in Cavineña are structurally similar to finite adverbial

20.6. Grammaticalization of relative clauses 771
clauses, and in §20.5 that RCs can have adverbial meanings. As such, one might want to analyze DS-temporal clauses as relative clauses within locative phrases.
The differences between the two types of constructions and the rationale for analyzing them as distinct are as follows:
1 — DS-temporal clauses have the requirement that their subject (S or A) be different from the subject (S or A) of the controlling clause. RCs do not have this requirement (see §20.4); 2 — semantically, RCs within locative postpositional phrases always have spatial meanings. DS-temporal clauses, on the other hand, always have temporal meanings; 3 — the full range of TAM verbal inflectional affixes is attested in RCs within locative postpositional phrases (see §20.1.1). Verbs of DS-temporal clauses, on the other hand, only take aspectual -wa ‘PERF’ and -ya ‘IMPFV’ and modal e-…-u ‘POT’; 4 — In terms of frequency, RCs within locative postpositional phrases are rather rare. A total of 48 examples are available in the total corpus of texts (21 examples in my own corpus of recordings, 4 in my own corpus of written texts, 23 in the corpus of SIL published texts). By contrast, DS-temporal clauses are extremely frequent. In a single text like T1 for example, there are 19 such clauses out of 153 sentences (12.5 %).
These four pieces of evidence strongly suggest that RCs within locative postpositional phrases and DS-temporal clauses be treated synchronically as different constructions. On historical grounds, however, it is most likely that the second has evolved from the first, in the face of their structural and semantic similarities.

Text 1 — When the Araonas became angry with each other

This text was recorded by Alfredo Tavo in the town of Riberalta on 24 May 2001. Alfredo relates his visit in 1995 to Puerto Araona, the main village of the Araona people, while he was a leader of the local indigenous organization CIRABO (Central Indígena de la Región Amazónica de BOlivia). The story runs for 13 min 20 sec. It was transcribed and translated with Alfredo himself.

The Cavineña-English vocabulary in section 2 lists the 1912 lexical and grammatical words which appear in the preceding grammatical description and/or the two illustrative texts. They are drawn from a current lexicon of about 4200 entries.
The entries are given in their root form most of the time. Occasionally some entries are morphologically complex, involving a derived form, a compound, or a reduplicated form. This happens when the derivation, the compound or reduplication process is not productive, or when it has idisyncratic meanings.
The entries are written according to the Cavineña alphabet discussed in §2.10 and used throughout this study, complemented by some Spanish graphemes for borrowed terms which have not (or not fully) integrated the Cavineña phonological system. The graphemes are listed in the following order (with the graphemes specific of Spanish in bold face):
a, b, c, ch, d, dy, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, kw, l, ll, m, n, ny, o, p, qu, r, ry, s, sh, t, ts, ty, u, v, w, y
Each entry minimally consists of a headword, a word class and one or more glosses in English. The list of word class abbreviations is provided in the table below; the table also provides a cross-reference to the place where the word classes are discussed in the grammar.
When relevant, additional information is provided on the meaning of a particular entry, the origin of a borrowing,1 the internal morphological structure of a morphologically complex word, the variant forms of a particular entry and the synonymy relation between two entries. Particular sections that
Words that are the topic of an individual section in the grammar are crossreferenced.
A question mark between parentheses indicates that the information provided is uncertain and that more work is needed to confirm it.
Section 3 is an English-Cavineña index to the preceding vocabulary.
