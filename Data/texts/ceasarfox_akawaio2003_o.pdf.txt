ABSTRACT
Zauro 'nodokAkawaio yau : Variants of Akawaio Spoken at Waramadong by
Desrey Clementine Caesar-Fox
This dissertation is intended as a contribution to the study and understanding of how language is used among the Akawaio peoples of Guyana, South America. It is a first attempt, limited to one Amerindian village, Waramadong, a community that has not been studied very much. The study begins by analysing four Akawaio speech genres, tareng 'ritual healing chant', mire aburobodi 'praising rhymes for children', pandong 'story', and zegareme'no 'personal narratives', at the levels of both content and grammar. The first entails making anthropological, ethnographical, sociolinguistic and general cultural commentaries on the content and social context within which speech is performed. This is to investigate how the Akawaio speech genres are categorised and classified and in what ways they are performed, interrelated and connected to the wider domain of speaking in Akawaio society. The second is committed to analysing the observed linguistic variation in the speech genres at the levels of both dialectal variation across speakers and stylistic variation across the genres.
The analysis takes a multidisciplinary approach, transcending traditional linguistic boundaries, and invoking both social and linguistic theories, especially in the analysis of Akawaio spirituality as a crucial component to understanding the native Akawaio view of speech genres. Thus, this study offers a primary description of a wider, extended view of what is known about language and culture in Akawaio society.

This dissertation also seeks to rectify a serious situation, to provide an emphatic counterexample to the common image in linguistics and anthropological literature, where Amerindian communities are treated as largely homogenous groups. The premise behind most anthropological and linguistic studies is that everyone acts and speaks alike within these societies. One aim of this study is to replace this homogenized image of the Amerindian with a richer, more complex and internally diverse picture, of the kind shown here for Waramadong. Appendix B presents a small, but representatively diverse, selection of transcribed, translated, and linguistically annotated texts, representing a small subset of the overall collection of texts recorded for this study.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This dissertation is the end product of the data that was collected during field work done among the Akawaios in Waramadong village. Consequently, this page is dedicated first to saying thank you to all those Akawaio speakers who assisted me in the collection of the data. It would not have been possible without the cooperation and participation of the forty speakers, most of whom were elders, who were willing to work as language consultants to share their knowledge about the Akawaio language, culture and history. It was a thrill to see and feel the enthusiasm with which these Akawaio elders sat down to teach me more about what it means to be Akawaio. The experience humbled me greatly, not least because it taught me to recognise that I still did not know my own language, Akawaio, as thoroughly as I had thought. Thank you for sharing the stories of your lives, for imparting information fiom your generation to those younger generations who will now be able to read your words, even long after we are all gone. I do appreciate and respect your questions about where all of this was going, and now that you hold the result of your contribution in your hands, I hope you will feel that you have done the right thing, and that my interpretations of your words reflect your knowledge truly.
On par with the learned Akawaio elders were the excellent academic advisors to whom I owe gratitude and without whom I could have never produced this study. Such honoured names as Dr. Spike Gildea of the University of Oregon, Dr. Philip Davis, Dr. Stephen Tyler, Dr. Douglas Mitchell, Dr. James Copeland and Dr. Nancy Niedzielski of Rice University will always be remembered for their continued scholarly support in one

v way or another. A very special thanks to my main advisor Dr. Spike Gildea for patiently assisting me in glossing the text and writing the grammar sketch of Akawaio. I would also like to thank Ursula Keierleber and Rita Riley for their enduring administrative support. In addition? I would like to acknowledge the financial support of the National Science Foundation Grant Number BCS-0117619, The Department of linguistics at Rice University and the University of Oregon for making my field work in Guyana possible. With all this help?there should be no more mistakes at all in this dissertation. But surely some mistakes are still here, and these are all my responsibility.
I would also like to thank my dearest friends and student colleagues at Rice University such as Carlos M Nash, David Fleck?Lullit Getachew?Pum-Sup Shim, Tiane Burke and Romain Combray; also?J.D. Leahy of the University of Oregon for giving me technical support at various times during the analysis of my data. To my loving families in Eugene, Oregon, for truly being the most wonderful, loving and caring family anyone could ever have: Spike? Bonnie, Phoebe and Julian; Grandpa Chase and Grandma Jane Tibbitts; Jay Tibbitts-Franklin; Susy7Mario? Javi and Gabriel Hernandez; Mr. and Mrs. Barbara and Bruce Rose; and Mr. and Mrs. Larry and Wendy Gildea. To my kind and loving sister-in-law Janice Bhoolai and family Jerome, Judy,Tasha7 Hecky and young Joshua (my inspiration) in Cincinnati?Ohio for loving and believing in me and for putting up with accommodating me during spring break and the Christmas holidays. To Mr. and Mrs. Michael and Pamela Gomes and Guy Gomes, my Guyanese family in Houston, Texas, who supported me all the way?even unto the last weekend of crazy revisions. My parents Gibson and Anita Caesar of Waramadong village (nurturers of my dreams) and

vi my sons Terrence, Kwame and Mensah (my greatest friends) who have all continuously supported me while they patiently await my return home to Guyana.
Finally to my best friend and fianck Lennox Dorian Alleyne I say thanks a million, for continuously supporting me in every way throughout the years of my study. His technical support far beyond the call of duty, in formatting the Akawaio texts was invaluable to the finishing of this dissertation.

Chapter 1 Introduction
1.1 What the study is about This dissertation emerges out of a study that was initiated in the summer of 1999
on the use of speech genres in the Akawaio spoken in the village of Waramadong, located in the hinterlands of Guyana, South America. The first objective was to collect text data on various genres, including myths and legends, personal narratives, healing chants, praising rhymes for children, conversational narratives, historical narratives, spiritual songs and recipes. However, counter to the expectations with which the field work began, the data showed substantial variation in the varieties of Akawaio spoken throughout Waramadong village. Understanding this variation therefore became the second objective of the study. More texts were collected in the fall of 2001 to verify and support the 1999 preliminary findings on Akawaio language variation.
The first task of this dissertation is to analyse the four selected Akawaio speech genres: (1) tareng 'ritual blowing chants'; (2) mire aburobod'i 'ritual praising rhymes for children'; ( 3 ) pandong 'traditional stories'; and (4) zegareme'nodok 'personal narratives'. These have been selected based on (a) the sufficiency of collected data of each type; (b) the rarity of the genre within present studies done in Guyanese Indigenous Amerindian communities and (c) the degree of variation observed, both across genres and in the grammar used within the genres. For example, stylistic variation is notable between tareng ritual blowing chants and praising rhymes, versus every day speech used in personal narratives and traditional stories.

The aim for analysing these Akawaio speech genres is to uncover the patterning of the Akawaio language as one that goes far beyond the laws of grammar, so as to understand the use of speech in Akawaio social life. Therefore, the genres will be analysed in their widest social and cultural context in order to attempt the discovery of culturally relevant features of variation. The strategy therefore, is to detail Akawaio norms of communication limited to the four Akawaio speech genres, by focusing on verbal, non-verbal and social parameters of interaction within Akawaio society. The components of speaking to which attention is paid include: who the participants are, meaning who are the speakers and hearers within the speech performance; which codes, if any, are unique to these participants; what are the channels used for communicating; what are the social settings or context within which the speech act is performed; and what are the forms of speaking. This is to clarify whether the speech is a conversation, story, ritual chant or political oratory, what are the topics of the speech and how are hearers reacting to these topics in the sense of Hyrnes (1974: 9). The reason is to pinpoint the cultural specificity of the rules governing Akawaio ways of speaking.
While components of the Akawaio speech genres will be studied separately and individually, it will be shown that these speech events within Akawaio culture tend to be integrated occurrences because many aspects of their components are interdependent and interpenetrating. For example, the social contextlsetting within which the speech event takes place is 'the arena for action', both in a physical and social sense (Bonvillian 2000: 80). This means that the social contexts or settings are an important aspect of defining specific events and kinds of occasions that require certain kinds of behaviour. Thus, speech events are classified according to their demand for relevant settings, which then

3 allows a classification of their social status as either belonging to a formal or an informal speech category.
This is an important reason why there is need to determine what kinds of decisions are made by the Akawaio people about classifying their speech events since these decisions tend to be culture-specific. Speaking, in this sense, is viewed as a part of a cultural system. Therefore, the basis from which this study takes off is the idea that Waramadong village is a speech community, a community where individuals share mutually complementary knowledge and ability of its members for the production and interpretation of socially appropriate speech as envisaged by Bauman & Sherzer (1974:8). By virtue of this, Waramadong village is seen as being diverse, since the
knowledge and the ability to speak -- that is, access to and command of resources for
speaking -- are seen as being distributed differently among community members. This has resulted in great variability in the production and interpretation of the Akawaio speech genres under study.
The approach that is taken to analyse the speech genres is centred around two issues. First, the complete absence of any study on Akawaio speech classification systems requires redress. And such a study cannot be done well if one ignores the outline of a complete structured Akawaio cultural domain. Even so, this study is not poised to analyse exhaustively all the defining components of Akawaio ways of speaking on each level of contrast. Rather, the focus is on Akawaio spirituality as one of the main components of this domain, upon which the Akawaio philosophy of language is based. The Akawaios believe that speech has its origins in this spiritual philosophy, which in turn is seen as a guide to how speech is classified in Akawaio society. The aim, therefore, is to analyse the

4 Akawaio speech genres first from a spiritual standpoint, to determine how they are classified and to provide outsider with a very descriptive sketch of what this classification looks like from the inside. In addition, the study will show in what relevant ways speech genres impact upon each other. However, in the end this analysis must be partial, as it reflects the sole interpretation of the investigator, who does not feel that there yet is enough representative data to warrant the construction of a comprehensive classification of Akawaio vocabulary and ways of speaking.
Second, the investigator opposed the idea that a complete theoretical analysis can be posed by this study (or any other) in the present time. This is because the attempt to explain Akawaio thought on ways of speaking through conventional western scientific theories is more likely to obscure than to clarify the gist of the Akawaio philosophy of speech. This is particularly because speaking for the Akawaio is not well defined and there is no clearly bounded body of knowledge for analysing Akawaio 'ways of speaking'. This is why it is very much an open system, with no established models for classification. Further, as an unwritten language with no tradition of literary analysis, Akawaio has no cover terms for the native concepts that might correspond to Western genres. The constant change and evolution of an unwritten language lead to its openness and imprecision (idea taken from Stross 1974:213, in which he outlines the inability to analyse and define Tenejapa Tzeltal speech). This limitation is at the core of the inability at this time to contain and describe Akawaio speech forms through formal ethnographic descriptions.
The second task of this dissertation explores the linguistic variation encountered within the Akawaio language at Waramadong. The text data collected both in the summer

5 of 1999 and fall 2001, and in previous spontaneous conversations with the residents, showed a substantial variation in the varieties of Akawaio spoken throughout Waramadong village. Speakers here knew about this variation, and it presumably contributed to their strong perception of Wararnadong as a community that was divided into four distinct sections, consisting of (1) Enemoroji'pai, (2) Samawa'pai, (3) Abamang and (4) Wayawa'pai. Each of these sections are clearly settled by different groups of Akawaio people with different identities, who speak different varieties of Akawaio. According to the residents, this situation is created by their family histories, the ancestral backgrounds which they claim to have. This situation has never attracted the attention of linguistic researchers, and the Guyana government continues to officially view Waramadong as a homogenous Akawaio speech community.
One aim in this study is to pinpoint the social and historical factors that have created and maintained such a large degree of patterns of linguistic variation in such a small community. There are three to five varieties of Akawaio spoken today within the Waramadong community, roughly corresponding to the geographic division between the individual neighbourhoods: Enemoroji'pai; Samawa'pai, Abamang and Wayawa'pai. Inhabitants strongly linked this situation to such social indicators as history of the village, ancestral backgrounds, social group membership and communication networks. This is consistent with sociolinguistic studies that have demonstrated that diversification arises when speakers are separated either geographically or due to social barriers (Burling 1992:66). This kind of linguistic difference feeds on extended separation and differences between people within a speech community of the sort that give way to the development of dialects.

6 How variation and dialects can present themselves within speech communities can be very different and culture specific, as shown by Labov's (1966) studies on the social dialects of New York and his (1972) study of the recent history of some dialect markers on the island of Martha's Vineyard. The present study also support this same conclusion. Like Burling, Wolfram and Schillings-Estes (1992:2) define dialects as any variety of a language which is shared by a group of speakers; because languages are invariably manifested through their dialects, it is safe to say that to speak a language is to speak some dialect of that language. The technical usage of the term 'dialect' contains no particular social or attitudinal evaluations, does not allude to a good or bad dialect but simply to any language variety that typifies a group of speakers within a language. This is important, since the general usage of the term 'dialect' usually refers to those people who speak differently to oneself, and often carries a pejorative connotation. (This is especially true in discussing native Amerindian languages, where the national language and most immigrant groups are said to speak 'languages', whereas the Indians all speak 'dialects.') In this sense one group's customary way of speaking becomes another group's peculiarity. The way dialect is viewed in this study is influenced by Wolfram and Schillings-Estes' technical usage and like the dialectologists, this study takes the position that dialects are not deviant forms of language, but simply different systems, with distinct subsets of language patterns. As discussed in the next section, acknowledgement of dialectal variation in South American Indian languages is difficult to encounter in the literature, and this study will be among the first to do a serious exploration of such variation.

1.2 The Difference Between This Study and Previous Studies This study can be contrasted with previous studies in four major categories: (1)
studies done in Lowland South America on the ethnography of speaking; (2) general studies done in sociolinguistics; (3) Cariban language studies in Lowland South America and (4) studies done specifically on the Akawaios in Guyana, within the disciplines of Anthropology, Ethnography and core linguistics. The remainder of this section treats each of these groups in turn.
First, in the study of the ethnography of speaking in Lowland South America, two major sources of these studies were consulted: Native South American Discourse, edited by Joel Sherzer and Greg Urban (1986) and Explorations in the Ethnography of Speaking, edited by Richard Bauman and Joel Sherzer (1974). These two books constantly directed the study because they gave ideas for organising, analysing and presenting the data on the Akawaio speech genres.
The studies in the first volume concern themselves with various aspects of the way in which speech is organized and classified within Amerindian societies, both in textual terms and in the labelling and structuring of speech as having poetic and rhetorical features which can be presented as units in actual performances (Sherzer &Urban 1986:6). In general the studies within this volume reflect a variety of Lowland South American verbally artistic forms and performances, and the various techniques for representing, translating and analysing them. More importantly, the studies seek to view Native South American discourse in its social and cultural context in order to understand the social, cultural, verbal and aesthetic worlds of Lowland South America.

8 The first departure of this study is from Sherzer and Urban's objectives for their study on Native South American discourse. Their studies focus on the aesthetic features in the structuring of speech in order to determine whether they have poetic and rhetorical features. In contrast, this study seeks to uncover the antecedents of the Akawaio world view, to determine what bearing they may have on Akawaio definitions and organisation of speech, and on the types of language used within the individual contexts within which speech is performed. Also, it explores to what extent these performances are expressions for defining Akawaio culture and its continuity. How are they similar or dissimilar and in what ways are their functions integrated? All these aspects contribute to an understanding of how Akawaio speech is organised, classified and defined. Thus, the analysis of Akawaio speech genres in this dissertation goes beyond the aesthetic function of speech in Akawaio society. In a very concerned way, this is the point of departure because as a Native Akawaio experiencer of the culture, The researcher is aware that there exists a spiritual philosophy of language within which speech is defined in Akawaio society. It is the belief that such a philosophy can assist this study in the attempt to understand, organise, analyse and classify the Akawaio speech genres selected for the study. It also assists in explaining and understanding the grammatical features of Akawaio, which is might otherwise only be scrutinised from an abstract point of view, following the strict directives of theoretical core linguistics. Nevertheless, such studies as the ones done by Greg Urban on the Shokleng Origin Myth, Anthony Seeger on Suya Oratory, Myth and Song, Joel Sherzer on the Kuna Curing Specialist and Harriet Klein proved useful to this study, as the Akawaio

9 data presented numerous parallels (see exposition in Chapter 4). For example, some aspects of Anthony Seeger's analysis of the Suya healing chants, sangere, were very similar to the analysis of the Akawaio healing chants, tareng, providing the basis for comparing and contrasting the elements of these chants within the two cultures. For instance, Seeger asserted that Suya curing songs sangere operated through an intricate system of metaphors. The central element of a sangere is the insertion of an attribute of an animal, plant, or other natural object into the body of a human in order to give a particular body part or function the properties of the animal. Thus, when a Suya child was sick with high fever resulting in convulsions, the curing song sangere for this condition names the white caiman. This is because the caiman is one that lies very still in the water without a tremor and never gets hot. Therefore, naming this reptile in the sangere during its administration will give the feverish child the quietness and coolness of the caiman (Seeger 1986:70).
Similarly, among the Akawaio, the most important elements of the tareng 'ritual healing chant' are the metaphoric characteristics of animals, birds, insects, reptiles, plants, fishes and natural phenomena. The rationale is to chose creatures or things that are the best exemplar of having a healthy state of body or body parts. Thus, when an Akawaio is suffering from a toothache, the tareng for this condition names the mabaruwa 'otter', who is known to eat fishes of all kinds and yet still have perfectly good teeth and never suffers from toothache. Hence, when the tareng naming the waterdog is administered to one that is suffering from toothache, the pain subsides, emulating the state of the otter's tooth, that does not hurt because his teeth are always healthy. Thus, because the Akawaio tareng chants operate in so similar a nature to the

10 Suya sangere chants, Seeger's work on the Suya provides an important point of reference and comparison for the study on Akawaio tareng chants.
The main focus of the second book, Bauman & Sherzer (1974), was to make the point that something is missing in the full understanding of language, and this missing piece is beyond the scope of the conventional parameters of linguistics. Thus, the new discipline known as the ethnography of speaking was to concern itself with recognising that there were patterns and functions of speech which were not taken into account in grammars, ethnographies and other kinds of research. The idea was that ethnography of speaking, as constantly shown in the studies within this volume, defines speaking as a theoretically and practically crucial aspect of human social life, a recognition which points to the missing link in both linguistic descriptions and ethnographies.
Because Sherzer and Bauman's volume is aimed at experimenting in exploring and establishing the methods and scope of the ethnography of Speaking; it is very useful to this study in the ways it has articulated, through the various studies, the parameters of
how to organise and present speech data . Also, in a very important way, it has attempted
to take sample studies from everywhere in the world, presenting a multicultural approach to the study of the ways of speaking. This being the general profile of this volume, one can only find parallels to Akawaio in some studies, such as the ones by James Fox on Rotinese views of language, Elinor Keenan on uses of speech by men and woman in a Malagasy Community, Anne Salmond on Rituals of Encounter among the Maori, Biran Stross on Tenejapa Tzeltal Metalinguistics, Joel Sherzer on the three types of kuna Speech Event, Victoria Bricker on The Ethnographic Context of Some Traditional Mayan Speech Genres and Gary Gossen on Chamula Cannons of style and good performance.

11 For instance, Gossen's work on the way the Chamulas evaluate speaking from the spiritual definitions of heat in the Chamula cosmos is paralleled by the exploration here of Akawaio spiritual notions of speech. While the Chamulas are preoccupied with 'heat' within their cosmos as an explanation for speech, the Akawaios are preoccupied with the notion of 'the person', how this is defined and, within this definition, how speaking is identified and classified (see Chapter 2 for elaborations).
The second major area with which to contrast this study is against general works in sociolinguistics. During the earlier emergence of sociolinguistics, studies out of areas within the United states, Great Britain and Europe focussed on societal divisions which were based mostly on class and race. For example, studies based on class included Milroy and Milroy (1992) on Class and Network Analysis, Labov's (1966) Study on the social stratification of English in New York City, Trudgill's (1974b) study on the interconnections between social stratification and language in Great Britain, and Macauley's (1976) study on speech of residents of Glasgow. Studies that consider race include Labov (1982), Baugh (1983), Wolfram (1969) and Edwards (1992). Finally, Gumperz (1971) studied caste and the use of speech in Khalapur in North India (Bonvillian 2000: 132-143). While caste is a socially labelled and overtly recognized, sociolinguistic studies based on class were structured on the basis of more covert indicators of economic, political and social status, as indicated by factors like occupation, income and education. (Bonvillian 2000: 135). Presently this sociolinguistic approach which alludes to divisions and variation based on race, class and caste is no longer strictly held in sociolinguistics. Rather, the approach has now shifted to considering social identity as one of the main social indicators that can lead to societal divisions and

12 language variation. In comparison, this study is not only considering social identities in the Amerindian village of Waramadong, as the basis for social distinctions and language variation but also sees it as emerging from a very different type of societal organisation, one that is based on community and interpersonal social organisation. This type of social organisation is based on social networks that are held together through consensus in the sense of Milroy and Milroy 1992.
This study shows that the Akawaio language variation at Wararnadong correlates extensively with the speaker's sense of self, and that this sense of self is largely based on whether they were migrants from a particular Akawaio community within the Upper Mazaruni District, or from Venezuela or the borders of Brazil, and whether they had ancestors with non-Akawaio backgrounds or whether they belong to a particular neighbourhood inside of Waramadong.
The third major difference between this study and previous work can be seen in comparison with traditional linguistic studies done on the Cariban languages in Lowland South America. Such studies include Hoff s (1968) study on the Carib language of Suriname by Hoff and Cariban studies done in the Handbook of Amazonian languages, volumes 1, 3 and 4, edited by Desmond Derbyshire and Geoffrey Pullum 1986, 1991 and 1998 respectively. In volume 1, Koehn and Koehn (1986) give an extensive grammar sketch of the Apalai language in Brazil; in volume 3, Abbott (1991) gives a grammatical sketch of the Makushi language (mostly) of Brazil; and in volume 4, Hawkins (1998) gives a grammatical sketch of the Wai-Wai language, also (mostly) of Brazil. Then there are the studies done on the Taurepang (Pemong) language of Venezuela, notably Arrnellada and Olza (1994) and ~ l v a r e z(1995) on the grammar of Pemong; Miera's

13 (1999) Ph.D. thesis on the grammar of Tiriyo, and Gildea's (1989) MA thesis on the grammar of Panare.
These works are very different from this study because their main approach is based on core linguistics. While they generally acknowledge the existence of dialectal variation, with the possible exception of Meira, they do not systematically identify the range of variation, nor do they identify the situations where language variation might have been encountered within the various Cariban communities studied. In contrast, this study begins by examining Akawaio ways of speaking using a multidisciplinary approach within a wider context. This has resulted in combining methods from various disciplines, including core linguistics, to examine speech beyond just speaking.
All the studies mentioned are useful in establishing ideas about methods for analysing the Akawaio grammatical data and presenting a grammar sketch of this language, which is also Cariban. This is why it is particularly important to compare the grammatical sketches on the Taurepang, Arekuna and Makushi with the proposed Grammatical sketch developed by this study. These three are the closest to spoken Akawaio, and tend to present similar grammatical components. Also, these studies provided the first reasonably comprehensive documentation of these languages, in each case contributing one more Cariban language for academic scrutiny and future comparative research. For the Cariban tribes themselves, this is more than they can do to save their own languages from constant pressures from mainstream societies that overrun them. In a general sense, documenting languages of the Amazon basin is a major contribution to their survival and to the improvement of the existing situation, where there is great urgency to document them.

14 Finally, the fourth area of studies to contrast with this study is in comparison with previous studies done specifically on the Akawaios in Guyana, which fall within the fields of Anthropology, ethnography and core linguistics. The single greatest influence in this area comes from Dr. Audrey Butt-Colson, the British anthropologist from Oxford University who studied the Akawaios in 1954 as a requirement for her PhD thesis. Her study was entitled; 'Systems of Beliefs in Relation to Social Structure and Organisation with Reference to the Carib Speaking Tribes of the Guianas. She published additional writings about the Akawaios in Butt-Colson (1967, 1971, 1973 and 1983). As an anthropologist, Butt-Colson focused on the general aspects of Akawaio life, while analysing the language in a very different way. Like most anthropologists, she sought to uncover in what ways Akawaio social structure is organised. She observed self-identities among families, family feuds as expressed in the use of the Kanaimo killers to maintain the status quo, and life in general among Akawaio communities within the Upper Mazaruni District. She arrived at many interesting conclusions about the relationships and self identities across Akawaio communities within this area. For example, she found that there were names developed by the Akawaios to refer to residents that belong to a particular Akawaio village in the Mazaruni. Hence, those who lived at Kamarang were called kamranigok 'tribe from Kamarang', those from Kukui, kukuigoks 'tribe from Kukui' and those from Kako, kagorgoks 'tribe from Kako' and so on (Butt Colson 1954). This information remains useful to this study because it assists in the understanding of Akawaio self identities at a wider level, at the level of individual village perceptions within Akawaio communities in the Upper Mazaruni

15 District. This information shed a lot of light on where the self perceptions and self identities that exist in Waramadong might have begun, since some of the residents link themselves directly to ancestors from either Kukui, Kako or Kamarang.
Unlike Butt-Colson's focused approach on the social Anthropology of a geographically diverse spectrum of Akawaio society, this study has chosen to look at a geographically focused slice of Akawaio society from all angles. For this reason, this study embraces a multidisciplinary approach. Thus, while the main commonality for analysis begins within the Akawaio speech community, because it is seen as an organised system of communicative events by both Butt-Colson and this study, they take different paths from that point of departure.
This study addresses the Akawaio language variation at Wararnadong by focusing on the differences between speech situations and social distinctions within the community through the analysis of four Akawaio speech genres. This is assessed through residents' definitions of self, where they came from, and who their ancestors were, which in turn has impacted on which neighbourhoods they belong to. Thus, this study correlates language behaviour with other social factors, which is the essence of the sociolinguistic approach.
In another approach, this study follows in the tradition of the ethnography of speaking by exploring the elements that allow for the comprehension of the organisation of speaking in social life. It is particularly interested in the relevant aspects of speaking that make up the cultural system. In this sense, the Akawaio speech genres are under scrutiny to determine general Akawaio community norms, ground rules for speaking, and the strategies and values that guide production and interpretation of speech. All of this

16 then leads to the understanding of how these elements organise and classify speech in Akawaio society.
Considering just these two approaches, it should already be clear that this study takes a holistic approach to the research question, and does not just centre around the parameters of one approach, like Butt-Colson's anthropological work. In other ways, the convergence with her approach is in the anthropological techniques used for gathering the Akawaio data for this study. The investigator doing this study made observations of Akawaio daily lives in order to understand Akawaio behaviour from a participant point of view. The major difference here is that Butt-Colson was an 'outsider' participant observer who spent time growing into the role of being an 'insider' as she studied the Akawaio. In contrast, the researcher doing this study began an 'insider' native Akawaio, and subsequently learned how to play the role of participant observer.
One way in which Butt-Colson's work has been of value to this study is the contribution it has made to the ethnography of the Akawaio people (see Chapter 2), and in understanding and assessing the social and other changes which have taken place in Akawaio society after the 49 year period of her study. Butt-Colson's anthropological study of the Akawaios continues to be the most important and extensive work on the Akawaio, still offering the only comprehensive record of Akawaio culture even though it was completed almost 50 years ago, in 1954.
A second point of departure for this study is the work of French anthropologist Alain Fournier, who published a study in 1979 entitled Waramadong: A case study for Amerindian settlement in the Upper Mazaruni Area, Guyana. This is the only known comprehensive anthropological and ethnographic study on Waramadong. Fournier was

17 the anthropologist employed by the Guyana hydro-electric project to study the legitimacy of protest by Akawaios seeking to save their territory from being flooded by a proposed hydro-electric dam. His stated objective was to focus on the cohesiveness among the Akawaios at Waramadong, with the goal of evaluating how they would respond to resettling in one place with other tribal neighbours such as the Arekunas. In the absence of great cohesion, he was to determine what factors might be crucial for social cohesion within prospective resettled Akawaio communities.
His study never mentioned the heterogeneous nature of Waramadong, but alluded to the fact that all the Akawaios at Waramadong were migrants and were recent inhabitants of the Upper Mazaruni District. Thus, he traced their history from secondary sources in the libraries and official government documents, culminating in a historical overview of the Akawaios that was very extensive. While he recognised that the early ancestors of Waramadong were from everywhere in Guyana and neighbouring countries, such as Venezuela and Brazil, he never mentioned the dialectal variation that existed as a result of all these factors. One of his findings saw the church as being the basis for family feuds, church politics and conflict at Waramadong. He also found that the people at Waramadong were passionately and aggressively opposed to the idea of the hydroelectric project, as well as to resettlement in any community, whether pure Akawaio or a mixed AkawaioIArekuna community. This bit of information is particularly useful to this study since it gives other reasons for understanding why Akawaios harboured certain attitudes towards people of their own kind and other people. It also gives clues to why Akawaios at Waramadong continue to segregate themselves by sections within the village of Waramadong.

18 Clearly, the work of Fournier is very different from the work in this study. First, it was an anthropological case study, but with specific parameters and non-intellectual goals. In contrast, this study began as a study of Akawaio speech genres, based on recorded data collected in 1999. The parameters for the study then expanded to the study of factors that might explain the observed variation, leading to the study of Waramadong as a heterogeneous speech communityy whose various dialects of Akawaio were to be studied through analysis of recorded speech. This study has also retained the original goal, to analyse various types of genre to observe how speech is organised within Akawaio society. Also, this study does not solely rely on the official definitions of Waramadong as Fournier did, but takes into consideration the Akawaio people's own oral accounts and definitions of Waramadong. The main contributions made to this dissertation by Fournier's work is in the area of gathering information on the history and ethnography of the Akawaio people at Waramadong. He gives background to intra-group relations within this village, and some insights into the culture and political and social organisation of Waramadong in the late 1970s. Another study that can be contrasted to this one is the very recent work of American anthropologist Sue Staats? who lived among the Akawaios at Chinau Yeng, Guyana, for over three years. Sue is presently writing up this study as her doctoral dissertation at Indiana University in Bloomington. The title of her dissertation is cCommunicativeIdeologies in (Akawaio) Kapon Religious Discourse'. Her work focuses mainly on the Akawaio areruya mainglmaiyin cHallelujah speech/songs', which play an important role in the semi-Christianised allelujah church ceremonies (see Chapter 2).

19 Staats' work is different fiom mine because she focuses mainly on one type of Akawaio speech form, the Akawaio areruya maiyinlmaing ceremonial and religious songs. However, it is also similar to some aspects of this study, since she is exploring the spiritual definitions of these songs, the ways in which these songs represent Akawaio communicative ideologies, what are these ideologies and how they are classified.
In terms of her thoughts on variation in the Akawaio language, she says (in personal communication) only that the Akawaio spoken within the Chinau Yeng village shows dialectal variation, and that she was told that the Akawaio she was learning to speak was not good Akawaio, according to other families within Chinau Yeng. Also, she pointed out that my present study on the Akawaio language variation was complicated by the fact that there seems to be variation in all the individual Akawaio communities. This bit of information was useful to this study, since it adds to the understanding of why there is so much controversy among Akawaios in communities in the Upper Mazaruni District about who speaks 'real' Akawaio. A review of some hallelujah maing songs that Staats sent to the investigator showed that the Akawaio language spoken there is indeed different fiom the Akawaio spoken elsewhere in the Upper Muaruni. There were both grammatical and lexical items that appear to be more conservative (i.e. to resemble something more like Proto-Carib).
Another study that is different fiom this study was the one initiated by Walter Edwards, a Guyanese sociolinguist who was mandated to describe the Akawaio and Arekuna languages. His approach was mainly core linguistics and ethnography, and he focused on publishing dictionaries and general word lists of these languages. These were supplemented with short articles on the ethnography of the Akawaio peoples in a

20 publication called BALP (Bulletin of the Amerindian Languages Project). He also submitted grammatical descriptions on the Akawaio and Arekuna languages to foreign academic journals such as Mankind Quarterly, the International Journal of American Linguistics, and Anthropological linguistics. Although he is a sociolinguist, none of Edwards' work pointed out the variation in Akawaio as a problem of note, so this study is very different from the studies done by him, although he was a sociolinguist.
The contribution of Edwards' work to this study is evident in the section on the ethnography of the Akawaios, the grammar sketch of Akawaio and the linguistic evidence for the variation, which can be partially determined fi-om the lexical items published in the dictionary of the Akawaio and Arekuna languages.
In conclusion, the main difference between this study and all the studies discussed in this section is based on who is doing the study. This is the first time that an attempt has been made by a native Akawaio to analyse an Akawaio community as an insider. And across lowland South America, this appears to be the first in-depth study, of either an ethnographic or a linguistic nature, to be carried out by a true insider, a native Amerindian member of the tribe under study. On the one hand, this means that I had access to data that might not have been made available to outsiders. In fact, most of the recorded conversations with the older Akawaios were only possible because I was one of their own, who had watched grow up in their own village. And because I grew up as an Akawaio, in an Akawaio community, my view of life was shaped by the same everyday experiences that shaped their lives. For this reason, even though there is no tradition of explicit teaching about Akawaio spirituality, or any discussion of ideas like 'genre', many

21 of the analytical ideas that came to me seemed to be obviousyand it was like second nature to talk about the Akawaio speech genres under study.
I do not want to arrogantly assert that I see things in my home community that no outsider could see, or that I understand my own culture in a way that no outsider possible could. But it is true that researchers tend to find things that they go looking foryand the starting point for my search has probably been very different fiom the starting point of an outsider. And analysts tend to organize the world into categories that are intuitively natural, with their intuitions shaped by their life experiences. The life experience that shapes my intuitions helped me to find what seem like the most natural Akawaio categories, both in spiritual terms and in terms of the division of speech acts into genres. Of course my intuitions could not be the same as all the Akawaios at Waramadong, but our life experiences are so much more similar to each other's than they would be to a European or American researcher that I feel safe asserting that we all have experienced pretty much the same Akawaio culture. So even though my experience is unique in Waramadong, as an Akawaio who left the village and got a western education, I believe my intuitions as discussed in this dissertation would also represent the views of other Akawaios at Waramadong.
1.3 Aims and Scope of the Study The methods of sociolinguistics are well established in the study of European
languagesybut have almost never been applied in the study of Native American languages of lowland South America. This is due to several factors, among which three are particularly relevant to this study.

22 First? researchers have been primarily interested in writing descriptions of an idealized grammar? as though the speech of any one individual would be sufficient to characterize the entire 'speech communityy.This approach to language permeates both formal and functional approaches to linguisticsy as seen in the most fiequently used methodologyy elicitation of translations and grammaticality judgments fiom a single sophisticated native speaker. Even where native speakers do the linguistic analysis, the emphasis is on capturing relevant examples from the single representative of the 'speech community' and at best passing mentioned is paid to variation. In contrastythis study is based on linguistic data collected in oral interviews with forty different speakers -just under 5% of the total population of the village of Waramadong. The variation that was originally observed in their spontaneous discourse was distilled into a questionnaire that was administered as part of eight additional interviews. Thusythe variation described in this study is not based merely on elicited intuitionsynor is it limited to a handful of speakers. Second? most sociolinguistic studies depart fiom a good description andor understanding of some 'basic' or 'standardy version of the language. But such descriptions do not exists for most of the native languages of South America. Further? most of these languages do not even have an explicit 'standardy version until the first descriptive grammars are writteny and these grammars do not necessarily represent any standard that would be recognized within the speech communities -- the grammar will be no more authoritative than the source of the linguistsydata, and few linguists have the sophistication or the good fortune to select a representative of the dominant dialect. In this case the Akawaio language has no published reference grammar? nor is there any

23 other documentation that will help to establish a sense of 'standard Akawaio'. However, the author is a native Akawaio speaker, raised in Waramadong itself, and as such brings a unique ability to recognize the variation in the interview data, and to present that variation in this study. In this latter task, the author benefits from work in progress on a reference grammar of Akawaio, in collaboration with Professor Spike Gildea of the University of Oregon.
Finally, most of the indigenous languages in South America do not have contact with well-trained linguists capable of writing basic descriptions, much less to trained sociolinguists who could bring modem methodologies to attempt a study of variation. The closest thing that is encountered to trained linguists in the South American Context-especially Guyana- is usually the missionary who has received a couple of summers of basic linguistics, with an emphasis on the skills necessary to develop a writing system and then to translate the Bible, both tasks that require standardization, rather than an appreciation of the diversity to be found in the Amerindian communities. This study therefore would not have happened except that the author is a native speaker of Akawaio who grew up in the village under study and is a trained descriptive linguist. Hence, the linguistic data was collected by a participant observer, and the preliminary analysis would not have been possible without at least near-native competence in Akawaio, for example to distinguished between patterned variation and performance 'mistakes'. So one of the goals of this paper is to offer a reliable snapshot of the variation in the Akawaio language in Waramadong village today.
While this study of traditional Akawaio speech genres and the variation in the Akawaio language at Waramadong is based on primary data, it is still exploratory in

24 many ways. The original goal was not to explore variation, and so the population sample was not carefully controlled to be representative of the entire village, nor is there any way to claim that this particular village is representative of any larger 'speech community', such as an 'Akawaio nation'. A fuller treatment would lend itself to collecting data over the course of perhaps several years, following migration patterns through all the seasons, to collect a large enough quantity of data to allow quantitative correlation between variation and social factors.
This raises the question of definitions of the social factors that are to be used to explain the variation. The traditional linguistic study isolates social factors such as age, gender, and such indicators as socio-economic status within a single geographic region, none of which turn out to be relevant to the observed variation at Waramadong (although of course there is other variation, only anecdotally observed, that does seem to correlate with age, and there could easily be variation not yet observed that would be sensitive to gender). Instead, the variation seems to correlate mostly with a speaker's sense of self, based on (i) having immigrated to Waramadong from a particular Akawaio community in Guyana, Venezuela or the borders between Brazil and Guyana, (ii) having ancestors and relatives from non-Akawaian backgrounds, and (iii) belonging to a particular neighbourhood inside Waramadong, with more intensive social and economic ties to other members of that neighbourhood than to the village as a whole. In this sense, the author's background in sociology and anthropology led her to focus on a more qualitative understanding of the larger social context, a vision of social networks embodied in the oral histories and personal narratives as told by the speakers themselves. Therefore, in this study, the explanation of linguistic variation attempts to capture the spirit of the

indigenous community as a whole, rather than breaking the social factors into discrete categories.
The main task of this dissertation is to analyse the Akawaio speech genres at two levels content and grammar. The first entails making anthropological, ethnographical, sociological, sociolinguistic and general cultural commentaries on the content and context of the selected Akawaio speech genres. The second is committed to analysing linguistic variation in the Akawaio data at two different levels: dialectal variation and variation across the genres. More specifically, this dissertation seeks to address: (a) what are the means of speaking available to Akawaio community members; (b) within this context, how and why do the traditional Akawaio speech genres get counted as distinct 'means of speaking'; (c) what are the linguistic varieties, codes and subcodes that are used by Akawaio speakers to sanction what counts as speech and (d) what are the means of speaking that enable the distribution of what constitutes the linguistic repertoires of the Akawaio community members, such as speech acts and genres for the conduct of speaking (in the sense of Bauman & Sherzer 1974).
Also, an additional task of this study is to show how the notion of social networks (in the sense of Milroy and Milroy 1992, 1978, 1980) is fundamental to understanding the linguistic variation, and that these networks, combined with the linguistic variation, allowed for the identification, inside the single village of Wararnadong, of three separate 'speech communities', one containing a separate 'community of practice.' Therefore, aside from the linguistic contributions, a primary contribution of this study is showing the application of these concepts to Amerindian communities, which turn out to be no more homogenous than their European counterparts.

1.4 Relevance and Significance This study is relevant for its contribution to several areas. First, it begins to help
fill the gap that exists in serious sociolinguistic studies on South American Indian languages. In this way it attempts to rectify the common image in linguistic and anthropological literature of Amerindian communities as homogenous groups, where everyone acts and speaks alike. It replaces the homogenized image of the Amerindian with a richer, more complex and internally diverse picture of at least one Akawaio village, Waramadong.
Second, this picture contributes to the general understanding of the documented and oral history and culture of the Akawaio people. For this study, particular attention is paid to the oral history of Waramadong as told by six Akawaio elders, who recounted events in both historical and personal narratives.
Third, along with the history, this study serves to document some of the ancient traditional Akawaio speech genres, particularly the Akawaio ritual healing chants and the praising rhymes that are virtually unknown, and certainly have never before been documented. This is exciting, because these genres are very important to Akawaio culture, but it is sad at the same time, because these traditions are on the decline and have been for many decades. For instance, nowadays, praising rhymes are hardly ever used and it was nostalgic to know that older Akawaio mothers still use them today. The tareng 'ritual blowing' or 'healing chants' are among the most sacred rites of the Akawaios and they are not randomly accessible to the young, or for that matter to anyone. They are the sacred domain of those Akawaio elders who have attained the spiritual maturity to deal

with the dual responsibility that must be undertaken before their use: to know the 'good' and the 'bad' tareng, the good for healing a variety of illnesses and the bad so one can recognise the difference between normal illness and illnesses caused by bad tareng. In addition, knowing bad tareng give the clues to counteracting its dangerous effects. Sadly, at the present time Akawaio elders are dying out and in the process they carry with them many of the undocumented healing chants. Besides their general use and their cultural value, the healing chants contain different speech forms, which may give clues to the puzzling linguistic questions asked about a proto Akawaio language.
Fourth, this study contributes to the general understanding of the dynamics of social conflicts and group solidarity that arise from people's social and linguistic selfdefinitions, situations that can lead to language variation.
Much of the value of this study lies in the contribution of a native speaker linguist to the study of an Amerindian language. The importance of this insider status to the understanding of Amerindian languages and cultures cannot be overstated. In this instance, it must be appreciated that the native Akawaio investigator conducting this study did not rely on her native speaker intuitions; rather in the quest for understanding the Akawaio language as it is seen by a larger community, she insisted on engaging in field research in Guyana, in the Akawaio village of Waramadong, the place of her birth, to record and collect text data. This was done in order to get the perspectives of other Akawaio speakers.
Thus, the native investigator acted as an 'insider', or a participant observer, a method of scientific research commonly used by most social scientists. But then the linguistic intuitions of a native speaker, and the acculturation of the child raised in the

28 village, are available in this study to help in the analysis of the collected texts, both the content and the linguistic forms. A review of literature has encountered no other linguistic or anthropological studies in Guyana - or in all of lowland south America done by a native Amerindian linguist.
Finally, the study attempts to apply standard labels from the sociolinguistic literature to groups in Amerindian communities, especially concepts such as dialects, speech communities, communities of practice, speech acts, genres, performance and discourse analysis.
Within the field of linguistics, there are three main contributions from this dissertation. First, it highlights the importance of innovation in methods used in linguistics. There are many native speaker linguists in linguistics (although virtually unheard of in South America), and at least in sociolinguistics, participant observation is a common technique. But nearly all native speaker linguists working on 'exotic' languages choose to get all their data from their own intuitions, perhaps occasionally eliciting grammaticality judgments from other speakers. This study was completely different in that the native speaker linguist collected and analysed a database of texts from other native speakers, in the context of interviews conducted in the village that resembled natural native speaker conversations. Therefore, while the native speaker intuition of the linguist has been valuable in transcription and translation of the text material, and also in understanding the cultural context for the distinction between types of genres, the data represent real speech, and not some idealized abstraction of 'competence'. Even though the methods used by the investigator cannot be viewed as being different from conventional methods in linguistics, what is uniquely different in this case is that the

29 language in question is virtually unknown, and the picture of the language that comes out is directed by a native speaker rather than by even a fluent foreigner.
Second, the study is making a huge contribution to the linguistic database for Akawaio, a database that will eventually be used as part of a reference grammar and a dictionary of Akawaio. In the aftermath of this study, all the recordings of the interviews used, along with the final transcribed, interpreted and glossed texts, shall remain the property of the Linguistics Departments at both Rice University and the University of Oregon to advance future studies in the Akawaio language. Also, it is only right that copies of the interview tapes be lodged at the Caribbean Research Library, University of Guyana, to be used by students interested in Amerindian linguistics.
Third, this study contributes lexical and grammatical data to the existing Cariban language studies database, particularly in the area of classifying Cariban languages and contributing to the placement of Akawaio in the Cariban language family. This study shows that the Akawaio language is still going through changes, which results in dialectal variation; some additional variation may have come about by contact with Pem6ng and Makushi. So on the one hand, Caribanists should recognize that the Akawaio language cannot be easily homogenized into a single data point for the purposes of classification. On the other hand, this study also might bear the clues to the original Akawaios, since the oral historical accounts of the elders at Waramadong continuously mentioned a group called the Chigomunas, considered the true, original and the 'real Akawaios'.
Most linguistic classifications of the Cariban language family remain speculations simply because only the documented materials on these languages are considered, and so little is actually documented. Oral history has not been taken seriously, nor has it been

30 considered credible. The arguments about the credibility of the documented accounts on Amerindians and their languages in general remain a sensitive political issue. This is because the Amerindians themselves do not agree with the homogenizing and the classifications of their languages, and this is the case in both North and South America. Within the literature, ethnographers, explorers, anthropologists, historians and linguists continue to use labels such as Cariban, Arawakan and other such categories loosely. For example, Cariban is a word coined from Carib, the English name for a particular Amerindian group, the Kari'na or the 'true Caribsy.Yet in spite of this 'Cariban' is still used to categorise and homogenize a set of similar types of languages, such as Wai-Wai, Arekuna, Patamuna, Akawaio or Makushi, without no respect for their individuality as this relates to their individual names and identity.
1.5 Research Methodology This section outlines the methodologies that were utilized to collect the data. This
section is important because, although the methodologies followed the conventional way for designing, organizing and collecting data in the field, there were some aspects that were significantly different. For instance, the researcher's status as a native Akawaio researcher brought to the methodology a uniqueness that is associated with being a participant observer and in this way doing the study as an 'insidery. This in itself is an advantage as it led to accomplishing the objectives of the study in a shorter period of time: being a native speaker of Akawaio hastened the process of elicitation in the field, interviews were conducted in Akawaio, and transcribing and interpreting the data -although very long, tedious -- was relatively easy to cope with.

31 Despite this, there were three major problems that were associated with the actual interpretation or the 'free English translations' of the Akawaio clauses within the texts. First, there were words and expressions, including sound symbolic words, which had no equivalents in English. Most times, these had to be explained in parentheses, and at times they were very long. Second, when an Akawaio speaker is telling a story, it is told in a way where the main characters are introduced first. Thereafter, the hearer must decide and figure out which character is being talked about by the teller. Akawaio grammar sometimes offers clues, sometimes not, to indicate which character is enacting which role in a clause from a narrative. Therefore, literal translations into English might make a story look simply like a lists of things happening, with almost no context or characters. Anyone reading the translations to get a sense of the story would have to figure out very carefully what is going on. To solve this, some characters were identified and included in parentheses in the free translation English sentence line. Finally, there is the problem of maintaining the character and dynamism of the story itself as it is told, since during the process of the free English translations, the "feel" of the storyline is totally lost. Another issue is stylistic embellishment and actual performance mistakes that all speakers make on occasion. These were obvious to the investigator, who was transcribing them. The question arose: should these be ignored or corrected during transcriptions? The decision was to transcribe them, but note the non-standard nature of the utterances in a comment note attached to the record of the sentence containing it. The larger problem with this, though, was that it threw the story completely out of line and context in English, and this is reflected in the English free translations. Sometimes, this mistake is followed through until the speaker corrects himselflherself and then it is

32 realised that the English language cannot accommodate this. In terms of the morphemes that indicate stylistic embellishment , the problem was solved by entering them into the dictionary as separate and distinct entries.
In terms of methodology, there was a certain disadvantage as well to being a native Akawaio going into an Akawaio community to do research. This disadvantage presented itself in the pressures that the researcher faced constantly to do the 'right thing,' which was a major obsession during the process of developing the methodology from the start.
Thus, upon arrival in Georgetown, it was necessary for the researcher to draw the attention of the significant actors and foci of power in Guyana and this led her to the office of the Minister of Amerindian Affairs every time, to discuss the study and to seek permission from him to do the research at Waramadong, even though she was from there. The primary reason was because the researcher was respectful to the political structure, the leadership and the Akawaio elders at Wararnadong, whose visiting regulations are sanctioned by the Minister. Each time the investigator saw herself as an outsider, a graduate student coming from a foreign university. She was very concerned to avoid appearing as though she thought she could just go into the village t o d o a study, while ignoring the leaders of the community. This is why the investigator had to report to the chief of Waramadong village and his councillors upon arrival there, in order to present her research permit and to outline the reasons for her presence in the village. This kind of approach led to organizing a village meeting in collaboration with the chief to introduce the parameters of the study to the villagers, the villagers who the investigator was intending to work with.

33 The reason for pointing out this aspect of my methodology is because there have been instances where foreign and local researchers have entered Amerindian villages to do studies, expecting residents to stop their daily activities just to accommodate them. This is bad enough, but it is even worse when they do not show any respect for the leadership within these communities. This is why (among other reasons) Amerindians are so weary of researchers working within their communities. The strong advice is that, prior to working in Amerindian communities, all researchers should know the identities of the significant gatekeepers, that is, of are the people in authority, who influence, or have the capacity to shape opinion and make things happen. Because these are the people who should be consulted before any attempt is made to implement a study. This should be an integral part of the first stage of all good research methodology. Such initial contact with the leaders of the community paves the way for a good working relationship, and the collection of good data. On my first field trip, in 1999, forty Akawaio speakers were interviewed and the selections were based on purposive sampling. This technique was chosen because it accommodated the researcher's knowledge of the backgrounds of the speakers individually and this is what determined who should be selected for the interviews. Other variables that determined the selections were the social indicators, such as geography (where were they settled at Wararnadong), the age of the speakers, ancestral backgrounds, the boundaries of the speech community within which they lived, and whether they knew their language and culture. These factors influenced the sample universe. Then, in order to decide on a sample size, the possibly relevant geographic, social and sociolinguistic dimensions of variation within the Akawaio community were

34 assessed to develop a diverse sample. Finally, this exercise led to settling on the number of Akawaio speakers and the amount and type of materials to be collected from each one.
The age categories of those interviewed included young, middle aged and old and these bore the following age categories: young (20-30 yrs), middle-age (40-50 yrs), and old (60-80 yrs). These age groups were best seen as having a sound knowledge of their language and culture. Geography was important because the investigator wanted to know which location in Waramadong the various speakers came from and how this location impacted on their language. Ancestral backgrounds of the informants were considered because it was the claim of the Waramadong residents that different dialects were spoken in different locations in the village because their ancestors came from elsewhere, and many of them were not Akawaios at all. The assessment of the boundaries of the speech communities at Waramadong was important, because this revealed what impacts these boundaries can have on the speech patterns in Akawaio. Finally, considering the knowledge informants had about their language and culture was vital for their selection, because it led to the collection of accurate and well informed data.
The aim of the first field trip was to collect various Akawaio texts, because the study was going to focus on traditional Akawaio speech genres. The text data collected represented personal history, myths and legends, rites and rituals, oral history, procedural narratives, recipes and conversational narratives. In fall 2001, a second trip was made to Waramadong village for two weeks, but spent only ten days because of the transportation problems that constrained getting from Georgetown to Waramadong. The aim of the second trip was to record more text data on the Akawaio speech genres. Additionally, the task was to field test 270 unfamiliar Akawaio words encountered in the first round of

35 interviews, and to elicit translations of 46 created English sentences. Both were necessary for testing the extent of the dialectal variation encountered in the 1999 text data, which showed both lexical and grammatical variation (Fox 2000). Overall, 15 Akawaio speakers were interviewed, but only 8 participated in the elicitation for the interpretations to the 46 English sentences taken to the field. Their selection was based upon their age, their availability at all times and because they spoke a different Akawaio dialect at Waramadong.
The methods used for the collection of the data entailed recording interviews with key informants and with the researcher, asking questions initiated by 'Would you say X?' or 'Who would say X?'. Also, notes were taken during spontaneous conversations, discussions in a data book, and applying the directives of a carefully planned interview schedule. Formal questionnaires were deliberately not utilized since the option of being a participant observer was indispensable. This method aided the discovery of unexpected dimensions that contributed to the language variation that manifested itself during random conversations and during organized interviews. Thus, being a participant observer give way to uncovering what was not anticipated during the formulation period of the study.
The interviews were conducted in Akawaio and were recorded on a mini disc player. The idea was to make the Akawaio consultants comfortable at all times, and being able to speak with them in Akawaio was a big advantage in the exercise. Even the small size of the mini disc player influenced the comfort of the informants. Thus, even though it was something they were seeing for the first time, it was not as distracting as the usual portable tape recorders they were accustomed to seeing.

36 Each time after returning to Rice University and thereafter, the data was

transcribed from the mini discs by hand into a data book in the following way: only the

right-hand pages in the data book were used. The first line on the page was headed

'Akawaio', and thereafter every four lines this was repeated. The empty four lines were

for comments and to assist in the glossing. The empty left page accommodated the

comments and observations made by the researcher during the process of transcription.

The transcribed Akawaio sentences were then entered alongside the Akawaio heading in

the following way;

Example (1)

Akawaio: uro dong bok mang

uro do-ng

bok mang

1S go-PRES.CONT

'I am going7

The end of each sentence entry was determined by the completeness of the sentence.

However if it was a long one the sentences were documented near the next Akawaio

heading. For example;

Example (2)

Akawaio: pana'pe Agawaio amok e'podi'pi tabodibo'ne

tamas martin

panak-pe Agawaio amok eji-bodi-'pi ta -bodi-bok -ne Thomas Martin

strong-Attr akawaio PI be-Iter-Past say-Iter-Prog-Emph Thomas Martin

Akawaio: ne'po 'ang go. (end of sentence) n-eji-body-ang go 3s-be-Iter-Pres Emph 'The Akawaios used to be very strong, Thomas Martin always says'

The next stage was to enter the transcribed sentences into the computer using the Shoebox program, to be glossed, and thereafter to give the Akawaio free translations.

37 During this process, the entries are first identified by entering the initials of the Akawaio

speaker interviewed, the type of genre and the number of the sentence to be transcribed.

Example (1)

KC, hallelujah song 1, sentence 3.

Akawaio: ayabong sero uwi

ereudago

uwi

a-yabong sero uwi

ereuda - go

uwi

2-seat this 1-older-brother sit.down- SG.IMP 1-01der.brother

'This is your seat older brother, sit down older brother'

Example (2)

KC, hallelujah song 1, sentence 4

Akawai0:ebing era'madok pe ereudago

uwi

ebi'ng era'ma-dok pe ereuda - go . uwi

heaven see -NZR ATT sit.down SG.IMP 1-01der.brother

'Come sit down, let us see heaven older brother'

Prior to using Shoebox as the main program for transcribing, parsing and

translating the Akawaio sentence entries, a data base was developed in the form of a

dictionary. This was achieved through the efforts of the linguistics students participating

in the Akawaio field methods class at Rice University, and their professors. This data

base allowed for the easy glossing of the Akawaio entries in the Shoebox program, and

also for new words to be added to the dictionary whenever they were encountered in the

text.

Each time there was always an attempt made to improve in the techniques for the

transcription and quality of the data. Hence, the method of transferring the Akawaio data

from the original mini discs direct to the sound files on the computer was considered.

This was a form of damage control for the original interviews on the discs and the

equipment itself, since the constant rewinding and fast forwarding during transcriptions

was ruining the mini disc player and the quality of the discs. This worked well, since the

38 production of the interviews were much clearer and the sounds files were easy to work with. Texts were transcribed into a note book then place into shoe box for glossing. This hastened the process of transcriptions of the text a bit. This method was improved by transferring all the interviews from the mini discs unto a CD to deal with the technical difficulty of transferring the data from the mini discs straight onto the sound files. In addition, this was not a technique that the researcher was familiar with and there was great dependency on a classmate who could only help at times. Consequently, only a few of the interviews were on sound files and when those were finished there was the need to get new ones on. Again, the text were transcribed unto a note book by hand after listening to the texts through a microphone, then entered into a Microsoft Word document, where the free English translations for the Akawaio clauses were done immediately. These were then transferred to the shoe box files and glossed.
Finally, the new idea of making WAV files of all the data on the minidiscs bore the best fruit. This led to individual parts of the interview (personal narratives, stories, recipes, praising rhymes, conversations) being segmented. This led to the easy identification of parts of the interviews which were pertinent to the study. After which, the CD bearing the text wave files were saved on to the computer, then transcribed using the Transcriber program. From Transcriber, they were imported into Microsoft Word, where the English free translations were done. Then these translated texts were transferred into Shoebox for final glossing.
In the end, all the texts appended to this dissertation were processed with a brand new Shoebox lexical database, to reduce the amount of variation in analysis introduced by the many linguists and students who began the lexical file during their field methods

39 classes. Although the program allows for corrections and additions to the lexical data base, it became important to create consistent entries that would reflect the Akawaio text data in the dissertation. Hereafter, the glossed texts was presented as being ready for their organisation into the various categories of speech genres, in preparation for that analysis.
The main limitation of the research methodology lies in the short time spent in the field, and the absence of key informants during this period. A decision to work with the available informants and data collected was taken thereafter. This decision has the consequence of making this study exploratory, more like work in progress. Even so, it serves to bring attention to the diversity of Akawaio dialects spoken at Waramadong, and it sets the stage for a future in depth study of the topic.
1.6 The Theoretical Approach Developing a theoretical framework for any investigation is a requirement for
scientific inquiry. More importantly, it serves as the model for advancing new innovations in scientific methodology and the creation of new models. The aim in this instance is no different. This study draws its theoretical framework from five main disciplines: anthropology, ethnography of speaking, sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology and core linguistics. First, this is to foster a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of the Akawaio speech genres. This diverse scrutiny accommodates a more complex view on the subject at hand. In addition, the disciplines collectively address the same problem, of speech use in speech communities, but from different approaches. Hence, they assist this study by providing different, and useful, scientific tools for analysing the Akawaio speech genres, while also giving the study multiple directions.

40 As mentioned, each of these disciplines have as their point of departure the behaviour of a 'speech communityywithin a given society. Each one targets a network of people within the 'speech communityy as the frame of reference for investigating communicative activities as a whole. Therefore, the ethnography of speaking, Anthropological linguistics, linguistic anthropology, sociolinguistics and core linguistics all share the common element for perceiving speech communities as organised systems of communicative events. The central question that is addressed by each one of these disciplines is 'to what extent does any use of channel and codes within the "speech community" takes its place as part of the resources upon which the members draw?' (Hymes 1974). The different ways in which this question is addressed is the core of the differences that exist between the individual theoretical approaches. In keeping with this trend, anthropology is applied to explore and verify to what extent the individual speech genres are part of the Akawaio cultural system, what are their characteristics, in what context are they performed and used and how they are different from each other. Anthropology asserts that culture is a system of symbols that allows humans to represent and communicate their experiences, among which is the spoken word. If this is true, then the speech genres under scrutiny are cultural symbols of the Akawaio people, experienced as having symbolic meaning, particularly because language in general is a system of cultural knowledge used to generate and interpret speech (in the sense of Spardley & McCurdy 1997). Akawaio language is a part of a particular culture, therefore it is a system of knowledge that generates behaviour. The actual performance of speech is a type of behaviour that is interpreted within the structural patterns of the Akawaio language.

41 In addition, anthropological and ethnographical perspectives are geared to explain and compare Akawaio speaking systems with other societies through the speech types
under study . This is because individual systems of behaviour tend to be culture-specific.
The Akawaio society, then, is being investigated within its own terms through its speech genres. This is why it is necessary to compare how different it is to other structural systems.
Cognizant of these general anthropological issues, the Akawaio text data were collected by employing anthropological techniques for gathering data, from observations made of the Akawaio people's lives in order to attempt to understand their behaviour from the participant's point of view. In addition, the investigator attempted to extract communicative rules by observing behaviours that do or do not occur in various contexts, and the reactions of members of the community to each other's actions. Within this context, ethnolinguistics became important, as it is used to analyse the contexts, norms of appropriateness, and knowledge of the Akawaio language and its uses. This is to reveal the underlying cultural models and to demonstrate the cognitive and conceptual bonds that unify the Akawaio people within their culture. This is also why elicitation techniques were used to obtain Akawaio linguistic data from native speakers at Waramadong, particularly to collect materials dealing with specific categories of vocabulary and varying types of Akawaio grammatical constructions.
These theoretical stands of anthropology and ethnolinguistics lead readily to the use of the principles of core linguistics to find categories of patterns in the Akawaio speech types. It does this by examining three important subsystems of the Akawaio

42 language that expresses them: phonology, grammar and semantics, as represented in the collected text data.
Phonology consists of categories of sounds and rules for combining them to form vocal symbols. It is not directly concerned with meaning, but with the formation and recognition of the vocal sounds to which meaning is assigned. A basic element defined by phonological rules is the phoneme, consisting of minimal categories of speech sounds that contrast, and thus keep utterances apart. For example, in English bat, cat, mat, hat and rat are all different utterances, showing the contrastiveness of the different sounds /b/, /c/, /m/, /h/, and 11-1.In Akawaio bok, pokyrok, dok, sok, and tok are also different utterances, showing the contrastiveness of the different sounds /b/, /p/, 11-1,/dl, Is/, and It/. All of these represent categories of different sounds called phonemes. The phonological analysis in Chapter 3 is used to explain if and how the Akawaio speech genres follow different sets of rules for producing and ordering sound categories characteristic of the Akawaio language. For example, preliminary analysis of the Akawaio data showed that the phonology in tareng' the ritual healing chants' is different from the phonology in everyday speech and other genres.
The grammatical analysis of genres focuses on how categories such as nouns, adverbs, verbs and postpositions are used in slightly different combinations, or with different inflections within the different genres. In this case, it was observed that old nominalizations are now standard verb inflections in all procedural texts, but in narratives, the old verbal inflectional system is still found, especially at climatic moments in the storyline, as can be seen in the narrative texts in Appendix B.

43 The final subsystem, semantics, refers to the categories and rules that relate vocal symbols to their referents. Thus, semantic rules instruct speakers to combine words with what they refer to. 'Refery in this sense means that a symbol becomes the focus of the speaker's attention, it makes himlher take account of something. These semantic rules would be applied to the Akawaio text data to assess in what way the Akawaio language defines such semantic rules, if any. The foregoing is the foundation for the chapters that deal with the analysis of the evolution and changes in Akawaio phonology later in the dissertation. Language regularly occurs within a social context as a part of a cultural system as postulated by Anthropology. However, to understand its use fully, it is important to recognise its relations to patterns of use determined by internal social factors. This is an important reason why this study has made the sociolinguistic approach an integral part of the study, since its rules view meaningful utterances as being combined with social situations. These, in turn, give appropriate messages (see Bonvillian 2000; Spardley & McCurdy 1997; Burlingl973; Wolfram and Schilling-Estes 1999). Thus, the sociolinguistic approach shows that in a language, variation is derived from differences in speech situations and from social distinctions within a community which is reflected in the way people speak. It gives way to understanding that, although some speech forms could be idiosyncratic, it is possible to study intra community variation by recording and analysing actual speech behaviour of members of distinct sectors of a given population. This is particularly so because there are two complementary processes that operate in dynamic connection between language and social factors. First, social differentiation among people correlates with the differentiation in their speech, so that factors such as

44
race, gender, region, class and ethnicity are used to account for linguistic differences. In the case of Waramadong village, the range of social factors that correlates with the dialects of Akawaio are ancestral tribal background, place of birth, settlement patterns and strong feelings about tribal identity.
Second, interrelationships between social factors and language use can be extremely complex for the following reasons, because sociolinguistic behaviour is inherently variable. Therefore, each speaker within a speech community can make use of the full range of speech forms available within it, such as alternatives for pronunciation, vocabulary and sentence construction. This can result in the unpredictability of the options chosen in a particular instance.
In Waramadong village, this type of situation is evident within two closely located speech communities of Enemoroji'pai and Samawa'pai, where a distinct variation cannot be observed in terms of a difference in a speech type. However, differences do exist based on other social factors, such as economics and knowledge of another nonAmerindian dialect of English. In fact, this is a situation where even the speakers at Samawa'pai are not a homogeneous group, since some are descendants of peoples who came from Venezuela and Bartica, nearer to the coastlands of Guyana, giving them knowledge of Creole English. In addition, they can also speak any of the other dialects spoken in the other two sections of Waramadong. In this way, individually, samawa'pai residents seem to be engaging in a variety of speech communities outside the larger unit.
An important aspect of sociolinguistics that is particularly useful to this study is its models of 'speech community' and 'Communities of Practice'. Since a secondary task of this dissertation is to explore Akawaio language variation, the basis from which such a

45 situation is viewed is the speech community. The first question to ask in this area is whether Waramadong constitutes a single speech community, or whether it instead is constituted of various communities of practice. Considering all the components of sociolinguistics, it is realised that in its application, sociolinguistics reveals a different aspect of the communicative process. When complemented by other disciplines such as ethnolinguistics, anthropology and ethnography it orients us towards understanding the full range of interactional, social and cultural meanings conveyed by talk. This is why this study has chosen to utilise a multidisciplinary approach.
Despite the attention paid to other disciplines, in the main, this study follows in the tradition of the ethnography of Speaking (see Hymes 1962; Bauman & Sherzer 1974; Gumperz 1962, 1964; Ervin Tripp 1969; Sherzer & Darnell 1972) as echoed in the edited works on speech in Lowland South America and the Amazonia (see Bauman & Sherzer 1974; Clark 1998; Bonvillian 2000 and Sherzer & Urban 1986, to name just a few). Out of this sample, the studies in the edited works of Sherzer and Urban (1986) and Bauman & Sherzer (1974) are particularly important to this study.
Now that this study has been defined and the expected contributions of the dissertation have been listed, the remaining chapters provide the meat of the research, the presentation and analysis of the primary data. Appendix B provides a picture of the primary data itself in the form of a selection of transcribed, translated, and annotated texts from the researcher's database.

Chapter 2 Ethnography of the Akawaio People
This chapter presents the ethnography of the Akawaio people. Thus it gives an overview of their history and culture. This way it seeks to identify the group in order to set the stage for understanding their general culture and their speech genres within this context. In addition, the history is useful for exploring the social, demographic and political factors, such as migration, social contact, ancestry, settlement patterns, villagelstate relationships and state policies that have impacted on Waramadong. All of these play a role in the dialectal variation discovered in the Akawaio language.
The ethnographical resources would include both secondary sources, consisting of documented accounts, and primary sources, consisting of oral historical accounts as told by the Akawaio elders who participated in the study. The latter is particularly important because it fills the gap of the non-existing written documents that precedes the formal establishment of Waramadong. The period referred to here is the time when Waramadong was a battleground for the early tribal wars in the Upper Mazaruni District. In addition, the oral accounts are valuable to this study, because they represent the way Akawaios define Waramadong in opposition to how it is politically defined by the Guyanese state.
In general, Chapter 2 is geared to pinpoint and identify the Akawaios within the context of Amerindian studies done in Guyana. It aims to inform readers about the spiritual beliefs of the Akawaios in order to set the stage for the more linguistic parts of the study that follow in later chapters. Finally, it serves to establish some basic terms of reference for the later analysis of Akawaio Speech genres.

47 2.1 Guyana
A study on the ethnography of the Akawaio people warrants a scrutiny of how they are defined within the historical and national context of Guyana. This scrutiny then extends further into developing a background setting to serve as a 'point of reference' for the study on their ways of speaking.
Guyana is located in Northern South America bordering the North Atlantic Ocean between Suriname and Venezuela. It was first inhabited by the Dutch in 1580 then subsequently by the British, French and Spanish. Geographically, it is divided into four natural ecosystems consisting of; (1) the coastal or alluvial belts; (2) the hilly sand and clay belts; (3) the highland region and (4) the savannah region. The coastal belt extends inwards from the Atlantic seaboard and represents the lowest point of elevation. The hilly sand and clay areas are located south of the coastal belt extending from the Pomeroon river to the Mazaruni river, south to Apoteri then eastward to the Corentyne river. These areas are heavily forested with altitudes varying from forty feet to four hundred feet (Daly 1975). The Highland region has forest-covered mountains such as the Imataka mountains located in the North West District and the Pakaraima range located west of Guyana, among which Mount Roraima (9,219 feet) is the highest point of elevation. Finally, the Kanuku mountain range located south of Guyana extends from East to West up to the Brazillian border and the Akarai mountains. This follows the southern boundary between Guyana and Brazil, then extends south west of Guyana to where the Kanaku mountains divide the Rupununi savannahs into the north and south zones (Edwards 1978:l).

48 Guyana is a multi-racial country, with a total population of 750,000 (1996 figures) divided into diverse ethnic groups: 49% East Indians, 36% Afro-Guyanese, 7% mixed ancestry, 7% Amerindians, 1% Chinese and Portuguese, and 1% other groups. All of these peoples except the Amerindians are referred to as 'coastlanders' because they mostly occupy the coastal belt, the most developed part of Guyana. Ninety percent of the total Guyanese population inhabits the coastlands. The rest of the country -- particularly within the hilly sand and clay belts, the highland region and the savannah region -- are inhabited by approximately 60,000 Amerindians, who are distinctly identified as consisting of nine nations from three different language families: Akawaio (Ka'pong, Cariban), Arawak (Lokono, Arawakan), Arekuna (Pemong, Cariban), Carib (Kari'na, Cariban), Makushi (Cariban), Patamuna (Ka'pong, Cariban), Wai-Wai (Cariban), Wapishana (Arawakan), and Warau (Warrauan). With such a diversity of cultures, many languages are spoken in Guyana: in addition to the nine indigenous Amerindian languages, there are English Creole (the most widely spoken), Hindi and Urdu, Arabic, dialects of Spanish, dialects of Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese (mostly spoken by recent immigrants from China), Dutch creole, Patois (among some immigrant Islander communities in MadhiafPotaro) and some other Amerindian languages not indigenous to Guyana, such as Kamarakoto, Taurepang, Tiriyo and Taruma. Because Guyana is a former British colony, the official language is English. Guyana is divided into ten distinct regions, among which five are inhabited purely by Amerindians: Region 1, Barima-Waini (mostly Carib and Warau); Region 2, Pomeroon-Supemaarn (mostly Arawak, Spanish Arawak, some Carib and Warrau); Region 7, Cuyuni-Mazaruni (predominantly Akawaio and one community of Arekuna);

49 Region 8, Potaro-Siparuni (predominantly PatarnunalIngari'ko) and Region 9, Upper Takatu-Upper Essequibo (predominantly Makushi, Wapishana and Wai-Wai). Amerindians also live in some areas of Region 3, Essequibo islands-West Demerara and Region 4, Demerara-Mahaica and East Berbice-Corentyne, but not in large numbers.
Settled over a wide area of Guyana, the Amerindians inhabit over sixty five (65) communities, within officially recognised main Amerindian reservations such as the Mazaruni District, the North West District, and the Rupununi District. These reservations were established in 1910 following the passage in Parliament of the Aboriginal Protection Ordinance No. 28, and were thereafter sanctioned in 1939 by the Moyne (West Indian Royal) Commission. Each village was to be led by someone referred to as 'Captain' or touchau (wapishana word), who was to be paid a stipend, serve as the rural constable for five years, and to rule in accordance with national goals.
In 1949 the first government administrative centre was established at Kamarang in the Upper Mazaruni District, the current homelands of the Guyanese Akawaio and Arekuna. Kamarang was set up on an experimental basis, and was the first government administrative centre established within any Amerindian reservation. This centre is still operational today. This move was the first attempt by the British colonial government to deal with administrative problems that plagued them in most of the Amerindian communities in Guyana at that time, mostly regarding transportation and communication.
In 1968, a regional system of government was established in Guyana to do away with the colonial idea of Districts and District Commisioners. This resulted in Guyana being divided into ten political regions, with a regional minister appointed to be responsible for each region. Each region had subregional administrative and

50 developmental councils, and it was at this level that the Amerindian communities continued to have links to the state machinery, since the administration of their communities was located here.
The idea of this new system was to make it easier to assess and monitor the functioning of the regional system at all times. Thus, state officials ranking from the highest level, the Regional Ministers, to the lowest level, Village Captains and their Village Councils, were made accountable to the government, and could be under constant scrutiny by the government. While the concept looks good in principle, the regional system is not perfect, and has actually been counter-productive at times in the administering of Amerindian communities.
This study focuses on the village of Waramadong, which is situated in the Upper Mazaruni District in Region 7, Cuyuni-Mazaruni. The next section gives background on the Akawaio people as a whole, after which Waramadong is placed in greater focus again.
2.2 The Akawaio People Akawaio is a Guyanese Amerindian tribe belonging to the Cariban language
family (for classification of the closest relatives to Akawaio, see Figure 3.1). There are approximately 6,000 Akawaio in Guyana, living mostly in the Upper Mazaruni District in Region 7, Cuyuni-Mazaruni, in the villages of Waramadong, Kako, WarawataJKamarang, Jawalla, Pilipai, Chinau yeng, Kwaimarudoi, Amokokopai, Koroba, Kaikan and Kuyubanang (see Appendix A for maps of South America and Guyana). Other Akawaio communities are located at Mabura Great Falls and Malali Mission in the Demerara river,

51 closer to the coastlands of Guyana; at Seventy-two Miles Potaro, Kurupung, and Issano in the Middle Mazaruni; and at Ataro, Kwating and Wayaura Yeng along the borders between Guyana and Brazil, but more on the Brazilian side (see Appendix A, Map 2 for a locations of Amerindian villages in Guyana; Fox and Danns 1993:20).
Some 4,000 Akawaios also live at San Juan, Ocienta Ocho, San Antonio and San Martin in Venezuela, following their migration there in the late 1960s and 1970s. These mass migrations resulted from the soaring border disputes between Guyana and Venezuela, which threatened family and traditional dual citizenship loyalties across the borders. As comes out later in this study, some Warmadong residents have roots in Venezuela because their ancestors came from there. This has resulted in these residents maintaining current strong family ties with families over there, which has in turn resulted in steady travel to and from Venezuela. As will be shown in Section 3.2, this group of Waramadong residents partly define their identities by their connection to Venezuela, as well as by the distinctive dialect that they speak, which has contributed to variation in the Akawaio language in Waramadong village today.
The Akawaio call themselves ka 'pong or ka 'ponggong meaning 'people from the sky', and they call their language by the same name. They were first encountered by Sir Lawrence Keymis in the early 1500s. Thereafter, they were described in reports and ethnographic, historical and anthropological studies in the 1800s by Rev. William Brett (1868), Sir Richard Schomburgk (184O,l844), William Hillouse (1825), Rev Everard ImThurn (1883) and others. Other studies followed in the 1900s, by Butt-Colson (1954, 1957, 1972), Edwards (1980, 1979, 1977), Gillin (19 4 9 , Founier (1977) and Fox (1996), to name just a few. Throughout history, they have been known by several names:

52 Akawai, Accawau, Accawai, Acqewyen, Wakawai, Waika and Guayea were used by other tribes to refer to them. Their physical appearances have been discussed in much detail throughout Guyanese history by priests, anthropologists, colonial government officials and explorers. As an example, Rev. Brett in 1868 described them as follows:
Akawaios resembled the other tribes but were recognized by their physiognomy by the way they contrive to adorn or disfigure their features. Using bright red annatto they painted their faces and bodies with blue streaks, they took great pains to do this and were only distinguishable because they had a circular hole about half an inch in diameter made in the lower part of the upper lip (Brett 1868 cited in Fox 1993:21)." In 1840 and 1844 Sir Richard Schomburgk encountered the Akawaios who had settled at Manari, located in the Barima river in the Northwest of Guyana. He described them thus: Of all the coastal people the Waikas or Akawaios constitute without doubt the most powerful stamp of men and surpass the remaining tribes, not only in the valor of their whole build of body and also in their nobility and regularity of features. They are in the majority of cases slim, generally over five feet, six inches tall and their limbs firm and compact. With it they developed in all their movements an elasticity of suppleness and an agility of body that up till now had not been apparent amongst the Indians (Schomburgk 1840 cited in Fox 1993:21) Following in this trend, William Hillhouse, who, because of his close association with them, was known as the Las Casas of the Akawaio, had this to say:

53 They were not superior to the Arawaks in stature, their skin was a deeper gold and are more resolute and determined in their enterprises. They are recognized at first sight by a large lump of annatto stuck upon the hair over the forehead. This was done both to strike terror and to keep away insects and their bites. (cited in Menezes 197928) Throughout history and to the present time, the Akawaios have been known to be compulsive travelers: having stocked themselves with cassava bread (a staple), they could walk for several days to reach their destination to barter goods. This is one reason why Hillhouse (1825) described them as being capable of enduring much fatigue and hardship. They were the suppliers of quantities of haiyari root (used for poisoning creeks for fish) and other items for other Amerindians in Venezuela, Brazil, and Suriname, as well as for the colonists in Demerara, a county in Guyana. Because they were such successful farmers, they cultivated more land than any other tribes. Consequently, they were able to sell excess agricultural products to the colonists, then in turn bought English goods like guns, which they took on their bartering journeys to Brazil, Venezuela, Suriname and other far flung Amerindian communities. It is no wonder that Akawaios were referred to by the colonists, historians, anthropologists, and ethnographers (such as Thompson 1887, Menzes 1979, Butt-Colson 1954, Roth 1911, ImThurn 1883) as the 'peddlers' and 'news carriers' of the North Eastern Coast.
Akawaios were reported truly self-sufficient in every sense of the word. Therefore they were not included in what Rev. ImThurn described as the 'inter-tribal division of labour' that was practiced among Guyanese tribes. This system had a dual purpose: first, it encouraged and accommodated inter-tribal exchange of implements

54 made, and second, it aided intertribal communication networks (ImThurn 1883: 271). To begin with, one has to recognise that each Amerindian tribe was specialised in making some implement to promote its supply among other Amerindian tribes. Therefore, each group made and supplied an item to other tribes in exchange for better-made or rare articles which they themselves could not make. This was the first fulfilment of the 'intertribal division of labour'. Then, during the process of inter-tribal exchanges, the people of different tribes were brought together to discuss and spread ideas, and also to exchange news that was of general interest. In this way, although there was no organised system of communication, news was passed very quickly among the tribes. This amazed the Europeans at that time, who did not know by what means news could be dispersed so rapidly.
As the Akawaio produced everything they needed for themselves, at this level their only original function in the inter-tribal bartering ring was as news-carriers. Although they were not contributing anything they made to it, the Akawaio later forced themselves into the intertribal bartering ring by coming up with western type tools, guns, beads and fabric to entice buyers. This self-sufficiency became the envy of all the other tribes in that, while most of them travelled to trade the implements they made and to carry news to their neighbours, the Akawaio travelled only to exchange European goods, to carry news to other tribes, and to go to war.
Their natural arrogance has resulted in the description of the Akawaios as being both warlike and quarrelsome. For instance, Hillhouse described them as determined republicans, which posed difficulties for anyone who tried to subordinate them -- this was also the trait that led the Akawaios into constant wars with each other (Hillhouse 1825).

55 One has to recognise that Akawaios by definition were traditional warriors and lived in warrior societies. Consequently, they took the greatest care to constantly prepare for war and were experts in fashioning the weapons of war. In addition, they observed rituals such as celibacy, fasting and the prohibition of eating certain birds and animals. The weapons were deliberately made away from the village to avoid contamination by menstruating and pregnant women, which could happen just by the passing of such women near to the area where the weapons were created. Weapons such as the war club wa'tana, bows and arrows, blowpipes and darts, and spears were all made with great care', then carefully treated with a poison called 'wassai.
Until the early 1900s, the Akawaios were involved in tribal wars with the Pem6ng tribes of Venezuela and the Makushis of Guyana and Brazil. Waramadong village, Ekereku, Kuzera'toi, Warimabia, and some satellite Akawaio communities surrounding Waramadong were all once Akawaio battlefields, as described in oral histories recorded in 1999 and 2001 with Akawaio elders Thomas Martin, Tim Lewis, Ruben Andrew, Roy Kenswil, Emanuel Thomas, Katrine Carvaio and Selina Williams. It is not surprising therefore to read that it was habitual for the Akawaios to attack any village that was weak; those who resisted were massacred, while others were taken slaves. Akawaios especially fought the Caribs over the Amerindian slave monopoly, a deal they made with the colonists, and they saw the Caribs as their sworn enemies.
On the other hand, regardless of how warlike and quarrelsome they were, Akawaios were also known to be hospitable. Hillhouse (1825) concluded that 'An Akawaio if once treated well is always a friend but if in enmity with you he could never be reconciled'.

56 Just like today, Akawaio communities were everywhere in Guyana and its frontiers and so A.H.Verril1 (1917) described them as being strictly "British Guiana Indians" the only tribe that was confined to the colony. He argued that they were the original inhabitants of Guyana and were a race distinct from all the other tribes. For such statements, Verrill was criticized since his speculations had no proof and were not conclusive. Fournier (1979) reported that Akawaios were recent settlers of the Upper Mazaruni District and are descendants of an earlier Akawaio group who were deceived into going to Kukenaam valley in the Roraima area to 'See God'. This notion is embedded in the rapid spread of Christianity, which was taking place within Amerindian communities at that time, and which later led to the emergence of Amerindian messianic cults. These forms of worship were syncretic, bringing together aspects of Christianity with traditional Amerindian spirituality. Regardless, it was Amerindian forms of worship that predominated. The oral history of the Akawaios begins with a self-styled Arekuna prophet called Awakai'pu, who summoned many tribes to visit the Kukenaam valley where he had established himself. A group of Akawaios were one of the tribes that heeded his call. Because of the great walking distance from the Coastlands, where Akawaios were believed to have originally lived, to the Kukenaam valley, many of the Akawaios perished on their way there. They died of hunger and attacks by fierce tribes and animals. Some turned back in frustration, and most of those who arrived at Kukenaam were massacred during a 'ritualistic death ceremony7 carried out by Awakai'pu. While this event is not officially recorded, it is often told by Akawaio elders. It is used to give

57 reasons as to why those Akawaios that returned eventually settled in the Upper Mazaruni: they were too tired to go back to their homes nearer to the coastlands.
Presently, the Akawaios are the only Amerindian group who practice the form of syncretised religion known as Hallelujah. It emerged in defiance to Christian proselytisation and in many ways its creation was revolutionary. It served as the medium to retain native spirituality, which was under serious threat. Also, it was a direct attack on "pure" Christianity, as only some components of Christianity were merged with traditional belief systems, to create a new religion. This new religion then became an important means for enforcing solidarity. The father of Hallelujah was a Makushi native named Bichiwi'ng, who resided in the North Rupununi. He went to England with some white missionaries and had a spiritual vision there. He claimed that he talked with God, who revealed to him the name of the new religion which he should share with his people. Thereafter Bichiwihg returned to Guyana and started Hallelujah. At the present time, it is only the Akawaios who still practise this religion, primarily in the villages of Amokokobai, Waruwa'ta, Jawalla and Chinau yeng. While Patamunas and Arekunas were also once associated with Hallelujah, they, like the Makushi, no longer practice this religion.
There are still important gaps in the history of the Akawaios. For instance, there are no facts about where they came from to Guyana, nor why they are always linked to the Patamunas, whose language is very close to the Akawaio language. In addition, the exact time of their occupation of communities in Guyana is still unknown -- by the earliest recorded history, in the early 1500s, they were already in Guyana to meet Sir. Lawrence Keymis.

58 2.3. Waramadong from the residents' perspectives
This section is divided into historical and contemporary components. The historical begins with some basic background, vital statistics, and a succinct history of the village of Waramadong, distilled from various government reports (section 2.3.1). The historical tale continues based on the oral history narratives recorded in the two field trips and focuses on the division of Waramadong in the four neighbourhoods (section 2.3.2). As this is unofficial, the village is not divided in this way by the governing council at Waramadong, nor is it recognised in this way by the government and its hinterland officials; hence this division is very important to residents, because it encapsulates how they see themselves, and how they define their current social groups. This material, which is based in the oral histories and other ethnographic observations made by the researcher, is the basis for understanding the social networks that define the modem speech communities and communities of practice in Waramadong. Discussion of this aspect of Waramadong is postponed until Chapter 5, which explores the various language attitudes found amongst the residents of the four Waramadong neighbourhoods, linking negative attitudes about speech (and language variation) to negative attitudes about other social behaviours.
2.3.1 Published Historical Records of Waramadong Wararnadong village is one of the seven main largest Akawaio communities in the
Upper Mazaruni District. It was established in the early 1920's by the Seventh-DayAdventist Missionaries who later colonised and turned it into a mission consisting of a church, a mission compound and a church school. The school and church became the

59 centre around which Akawaio families were forced to live, guaranteeing stability for a once nomadic people. Both school and church provided education and these institutions were used as the medium for conversion to Christianity, which also started the process of integrating the Akawaios into mainstream Guyanese society. This mission was also established, in part, to facilitate the colonial government's plan to make the Upper Mazaruni a reservation, was made official in 1953 (Amerindian Lands Commission Report, 1969). This resulted in the establishment of a centre for administration, which was and still is located at Kamarang, thirty miles downriver from Waramadong. The impact of this administrative move led to the official recognition of Waramadong as an Akawaio village with full rights to have its own political administrative structure, linked to the national state political machinery.
Currently, Waramadong is still governed through a non-traditional political structure which is influenced and approved by the state local government system. The head of the village, legally called the Captain but popularly known as the Chief, is assisted by a team of Six village councillors. Each Chief is elected to serve for five years. Elections are conducted by state government officials, usually the Assistant Regional District Officer, sometimes other designated Hinterland officers. Chiefs that served Waramadong from 1955 to the present time include Capt. Philip Donald (Kamarakoto married to an Akawaio), Capt. Joseph Isaacs (Akawaio), Capt. Jordan Thomas (Akawaio), Capt. Gibson Caesar (ArekunalKamarakoto married to an Akawaio) and Capt. Dutchell Isaacs (Akawaio), who is still the chief at Waramadong today.
The institutions and fraternities that have been established in Waramadong include a health centre, which is administered by an Akawaio health worker and an

60 Arekuna malaria technician. The health centre takes care of basic medical needs, such as delivery of babies, treatment of minor accidents, flus and colds, rashes, some infections, cuts and bruises, snake bites and malaria. Serious cases are referred to the Government Cottage hospital at Kamarang and if the patients cannot be helped there they are flown to Georgetown Hospital in the city.
In 1977, a secondary school was built as a separate complex away from the main village, to serve the entire Upper Mazaruni District. Students attending this school come from all the main Akawaio and Arekuna villages and are accommodated in small dormitories administered by chalet administrators, house mothers and fathers. There is an overall administrator for the school, a janitor, and Akawaio cooks who provide meals for the children on open stoves located in the adjoining area of the mess hall. Food for the secondary school is provided by central government and there is a boat and an engine which is also provided by the government. The teachers here consist of a coastal headmaster (non-Amerindian), five Akawaio teachers and one Arekuna teacher. A primary school was established in the late 1950s, first as a church school and then it became a government school. There are six Akawaio women teaching at this school and it is located not far from the secondary school compound. It has a section that caters to kindergarten pupils.
A Seventh-Day-Adventist church is pastored by a group of local Akawaio leaders and trained bible workers. Preaching in this church is done in both Akawaio and English.
A village shop, administered by local store-keepers, is located in the main village plaza alongside the Waramadong village road. It sells local produce such as ground provisions and plantains and bananas, as well as goods ordered from Georgetown city

61 such as clothing, shoes, matches, food condiments, packet soups, detergent and milk. Local smoked meat and fish is sometimes sold here.
A community centre built specifically for official functions is located within the village plaza. Sometimes when there are combined inter-village events the building is used to house visitors.
An agricultural station was built for experimental purposes. This is where the village nursery is located and mainly cash crop seedlings are planted for distribution whenever necessary.
In addition, there is a sports club which was recently built and it provides shelter for sports meetings and sports garb and equipment.
Finally, there is the Pathfinder Club which is the religious youth arm of the Seventh-Day-Adventists. This club could be compared with the scout organisation and was developed to coach youths about living a healthy Christian life. Activities learned in the Pathfinder Club include drills, track and trail, knot tying, survival skills in swimming and boating, travelling, eating healthy foods and evangelising.
There is one main radio set that is housed at the Health Centre, but there is no running water and electric lights. There is a generator at the secondary school which only serves this complex.
Most of the teachers teaching at the primary and secondary schools are ethnically Akawaio and Arekuna. Because of the national 'English only' policy in Guyana, English is the main medium for learning at school. The level of English spoken within Waramadong is excellent and most villagers are bilingual or trilingual (speaking also Spanish). Although everyone who lives at Waramadong speaks Akawaio in daily

62 interactions, there are obvious signs that this could change, in part because the prestige language of education is English and Akawaio is not given any official status in the schools or in the government.
Most Akawaios at Waramadong are Seventh-Day-Adventist converts, and this is the only religion that predominates in this village. In spite of this, there are some old Akawaio elders who still choose to continue to honour the Hallelujah (refer to Section 2.2). For instance, at Wayawa'pai, some of the residents announced that they were Hallelujah followers and will never be converted to Christianity. Sometimes this loyalty to Hallelujah was evident in the spiritual songs that were still being sung even by those who were Seventh-Day-Adventist. There are at least four main strongholds of the Seventh-Day-Adventists in the Upper Mazaruni District: Kako village, two communities at Kamarang Kaikan, and Waramadong. Over the past years, there were attempts to convert believers at Pipili'pai and Chinau yeng to become Seventh-Day-Adventists, but with no major results. In part this is because these Akawaio villages, in addition to such villages as Jawalla, Pipili'pai, Arnokokopai and Chinau Yeng, already belong to other denominations: Jawalla Akawaios are Anglicans and Hallelujah worshipers, Pipilipai Akawaios belong to the Pilgrim Holiness church, and Amokokopai and ChinauYeng residents are mostly Hallelujah coverts.
The current population of Waramadong is now nine hundred and fifty (950). The population has increased from 520 people in 1996, and 756 in 1999. The population was larger in the early 1960s and 1970s, but there was a wave of migrations to Venezuela following the territorial disputes between that country and Guyana (concentrated in the late 1960's and early 1970's). These political disputes threatened kinships ties and free

63 travel for many Akawaio families, who chose to move to avoid the risk of being permanently separated. Today there are at least 3,000 Akawaios living in Venezuela, both along the border and elsewhere in the country, in such places such as San Juan, San Martin, San Antonio and Ocienta Ocho. Despite the loss of these families, the population at Waramadong has been continuously rising for the following reasons: (1) More children are born every year (this based on informal reports from village health workers). (2) Inter-tribal marriages are on the rise, with recent unions between AkawaioIArekuna, AkawaiolMakushi, AkawaioIArawak and AkawaioIAkawaio from other Guyanese Amerindian communities. The new families often choose to live in Waramadong, meaning new members are admitted to the community over a period of time. (3) Some of the Akawaios who live in Venezuela have been returning home due to bad conditions there within the past three years, bringing their extended families back home with them. And (4) in 1999, a new Secondary school was established in Waramadong, and all the children from the neighbouring villages are required to attend this school. The present population of the school now exceeds three hundred, a number that is reflected in the population figures.
2.3.2 Oral History: The creation of four distinct sections of Waramadong Prior to the current occupation, Waramadong was only a tribal battle field and
saw wars taking place for territory and its occupancy between Akawaios and various closely related tribes: Arekuna, Taurepang, and Kamarakoto (all Pem6ng) who hailed from the Gran Sabana, San Helena and Marawak in Venezuela, Makushi, neighbouring

64 chigomunasl who hailed from Ekereku and the Kawaimo area, and more distantly, the
Caribs. During this period, both Akawaio and Pemong men captured women for wives
from each other's tribes. This period of prolonged contact certainly must have
contributed to the variation that now exists in the Akawaio language at Waramadong.
Thereafter, there was continuous migration to and from Venezuela by these mixed
families and their children, which reinforced their fluency in Pembng and thus gave them
confidence in code switching and code mixing, adding to the variation in the Akawaio
language, specifically the development of the Akawaio dialect defined in Section 2.3.2 as
Pemhg-Akawaio.
A more recent source of intertribal unions that encouraged the development of
Pemong-Akawaio was the Davis Indian Training School, established in the 1950's at
Paruima. This was a Seventh-day-Adventist boarding school to which Arekuna and
Akawaio young men and women were admitted. Since it was an all-age school, many of
those who were old enough to many chose to take wives and husbands from the other
tribe, then took their spouses to their homes, either at Paruima or Waramadong. The
Pemong-Akawaio-speaking families that came to Waramadong all settled in Section one,
Enemoroji'pai, and Section two, Samawa'pai.
1 The Chigomunas are a mysterious group, never before mentioned in the literature on Cariban people or languages, and previously unknown to the author as well. The oral histories agree that the Chigomuna spoke a closely related language, and two Akawaio elders from Enemoroji'pai and Abamang explained that the 'original' Akawaios who inhabited the Upper Mazaruni were the Chigomunas who were settled at Kawaimo and other remote parts of the Mazaruni. These were said to be the 'real Akawaios', entailing that the present population now known as Akawaios is only representative of some kind of "mixed" group. It was further asserted that KakoIAkawaio speakers feel that they are direct descendants of the Chigomunas, and thus are speakers of the "original Akawaio". This would then explain some of the language attitudes discussed in section 3.3.4. Of course, none of this can be confirmed without additional evidence, and this study does not endorse these claims. Nonetheless, the stories are certainly intriguing!

65 Although they share Pemong ancestry and linguistic influences, what distinguishes the communities of Enemoroji'pai and Samawa'pai is the different Akawaio family connections they have: in Enemoroji'pai, the Pemong descendents have intermarried with Akawaios and Chigomunas from Ekereku and Kawaimo. In Samawa'pai they have intermarried with Akawaios from Seventy-two Miles, at the outskirts of Bartica (closer to the coastlands of Guyana). In conversation with the author, two of these speakers pointed out that their ancestors originally migrated to Seventy-two MilesIBartica from Potaro and the Kaiteur falls area; these, along with communities such as Kopinang, Kumkubaru, Chenapau and Paramakatoi, are considered the homelands of the Patamuna (another dialect of Kapong). While this history is very interesting, and certainly calls for further investigation, this study will not address the Patamuna-Akawaio variety, since basic data on Patamuna are lacking to confirm any claim. Other immigrants to Waramadong came from neighbouring Akawaio communities in the Upper Mazaruni District, from areas like Kako, Kukui and Philipai, and from Issano Middle Mazaruni. Most times this happened because of marital commitments or to simply visit. Most residents of modem Waramadong came directly from Kako and surrounding areas; these are the speakers of Kako-Akawaio. Those that came from Kukui settled at Warimabia and Kusera'toi, small farming hamlets which were located about fifty miles from Waramadong, near the foot of the Pipitobu Mountain, where they continued to speak Kukui-Akawaio. Although their settlements were located away from the village, their children resided at Waramadong in order to go to school. In the late 1980s, because of constant malaria epidemics and the death of many of their prominent elders and leaders, many of the Kukui-Akawaio speakers moved from these

66 small settlements to Waramadong proper, settling together with the speakers of KakoAkawaio in Section 3, Abamang. Abamang is the largest geographical area of Waramadong village, and the combined Kako-Akawaio and Kukui-Akawaio speakers represent the largest group when compared to the groups in the other three sections.
The fourth neighbourhood, Wayawa'pai, was originally settled by an earlier group of Akawaio families who spoke the Kako-Akawaio dialect. These original Akawaio families have left Wayawa'pai over the years for various reasons. Several prominent elderly family members died one after the other as they succumbed to a strange illness in the early 1960s. This resulted in the break-up of several closely-knit families who lived there. Others who remained got married and migrated to other parts of Waramadong or completely left with their spouses to neighbouring communities such as Paruima (an Arekuna village), Jawalla, Kamarang and Kako villages. Some Wayawa'pai family members eventually abandoned this section to establish small permanent family hamlets just off Waramadong and in one instance, six miles down river.
In the early 1960s, the Waramadong village chief, Joseph Isaacs, invited the village chief of AtaroIKwating, Clementino to bring his two wives and children to Waramadong, so that his children could be educated. He accepted, bringing two other families with him: Agaru (subsequently called John Smith) with his two wives and children and Joji (known as Milton Joseph) with his three wives and children. These families established a family hamlet in an area that surrounded the communal village farm at Parana'pai, located about six miles away from Waramadong village. In addition, the families were allocated a communal village house at Waramadong, located at a bordering area between Abamang and Wayawa'pai. The families occupied this house

67 whenever they came to Waramadong to participate in its activities. For the most part, the children of these families lived in the communal house during the week and returned to the family hamlet on the weekends. In the late 1960s Chief Clementino was accidentally killed by a falling tree during the clearing of the Waramadong village farm. Chief Clementino's two wives and his relatives in Kwating blamed the Waramadong chief for killing him (although it was clear this was not so). This event created a rift between Waramadong and the AtaroIKwating community. Following Clementino's death, his widows and their children returned to Kwating but the Smith and the Milton families remained at the family hamlet at Parana 'pai.
In the late 1970s, the eldest daughter of Joji married a male descendant of an original family from Wayawa'pai. This began a period of expanded settlement in Wayawa'pai, as Joji Milton's family began settling in this area by building new homes near to their daughter and son-in-law's home. Presently, 10 of the 14 families that reside in Wayawa'pai are part of Joji Milton's extended family. The others represent a few of the remaining original Wayawa'pai descendants, plus some new families who have migrated recently from Kwating. A constant flow of Akawaio immigrants from Kwating continues to this day, expanding the population of Wayawa'pai. Consequently, the number of speakers of the newest dialect of Akawaio, called Kwating-Akawaio, continues to grow at Waramadong. As Wayawa'pai represents the second-largest geographical area of Waramadong village, there is ample room for further growth.
At this point, the author's personal history - and therefore potential biases should be reviewed. The author grew up in Abamang, speaking Kako-Akawaio. Her father is Arekuna from Venezuela, so she is also fully fluent in Arekuna (a dialect of

68 Pemong). However, due to the influence of the powerful traditional Akawaio norms, reinforced by the influence of a powerful Akawaio maternal grandmother, she has never developed or reinforced an Arekuna identity. This is part of a general pattern, in that when one parent is of the Akawaio nation and the child is born in Akawaio territory, then that child is deemed an Akawaio, regardless of which tribe the other parent comes from. For the most part, the author's father was considered a stranger in Waramadong, and was forced to adhere to all the directives of his wife's Akawaio culture (even so, he was elected Captain of Waramadong for a 5-year term). The writer and her siblings were always taught to be Akawaio, to speak Akawaio and to always be proud of being Akawaio. After growing up, the author married a non-Amerindian Guyanese national and moved to Georgetown, capital of Guyana. During 20 years of work in the Amerindian Languages ProjectIAmerindian Research Unit, she conducted field work with all the other tribes of Guyana, developing fluency in all dialects of Pemong and Kapong, plus conversational ability in Cariban languages Kari'fia (Carib proper) and Arawak. Although she grew up surrounded by these social and linguistic tensions, her time away and her linguistic training have given her a different perspective, and this is what allows her to remain objective enough to try to understand all the groups in Waramadong. But the reader should nonetheless keep in mind that the author cannot be completely objective in analysing the place of her birth.
2.4 Akawaio Spiritual Beliefs Today Akawaios still practice aspects of their traditional culture and their oral
traditions and the language is kept alive. One major aspect of their culture which is

69 suppressed and almost rooted out by Christianity is their spirituality. This is defined not as a religion in a western sense but as a way of life. Without an understanding of the role of this Akawaio spirituality, there is a danger to dismiss and overlook their trend of thought that is reflected in how they perceive aspects of their life such as language. One main reason why this spiritual focus becomes important in this study is because it provides a background for understanding the context within which the Akawaio language is defined and how it is classified. It is therefore important to discuss the main aspects of these Akawaio beliefs.
Firstly, at the centre of Akawaio spirituality is the person and how this concept is defined. This is because Akawaio personhood is associated with the skylearth (upper world and underworld) opposition, which they define as the key to explaining human existence. It provides a background to understanding the physical space of the human form in relation to the cosmos. The cosmic universe is understood as a conscious, living, organic and evolving being that has its own laws of existence. Humans and all other forms of life are seen as part of this whole.
The Akawaios therefore, perceive of the cosmos as being divided into different worlds which represent other states of beings or different levels of existence, realities and consciousness. The cosmic universe is where the human being stands as the vertical cosmic pillar, a position in which he is seen as the embodiment of his world into layers. For the Akawaios, the upper world is the realm where a person experiences the high self while the underworld is the experience of the body self. These experiences are reflected in the way they divide the spiritual cosmic universe, in a way parallel to the way humans divide and define themselves. These divisions represent different realms of reality and are

70 spiritual categories which have evolved from the conscious and the unconscious human mind. This is guided by a spirituality, a guided power that is responsible for human actions and one which originates from the spirit within humans themselves.
Akawaios perceive of three worlds: ka'pong bada 'upper world' or celestial world which means 'a place in the sky' or 'a place for humans par excellence.' The upper world has two sub categories: the home of the ancestors, penaro'kong, and the home of spiritual beings. Penaro'kong is the home of Magunaimo, the great spiritual ancestor of the Akawaio people, and the Sun Father, who constantly energizes and rejuvenates Magunairno, controlling night and day, time and spatial directions. The other sublevel is the home of spiritual beings where various spirits live such as imawari, maigok, pijawogoks, spirits of good people who died and other good ancestral spirits. These are the spirits which are summoned during shamanic ceremonies to give guidance for curing illnesses, warfare and leadership. All the entities living within the two sublevels live normal lives. Thus they continue to have wives and children to ensure the future continuity of Akawaio spiritual ancestors. They are spiritually enlightened by the great ancestor magunairno.
The second world, nongbong pada 'earthly placelhome', consists of only one level, representing the terrestrial world, also called the middle world. This world is the trunk or the central axis connecting the middle world of physical reality at the centre with other worlds such as the celestial world ka'pong bada. This is the earthly home of the humans, animals and all other things on earth. It is also the home of bad spirits. The person at this point stands as a vertical axis between the celestial and the subterranean world.

71 The third world of the Akawaio is the nong o'nongpada 'place under the earth', or the subterranean world, which is also divided into two levels (1) abai awong pada 'shallow underworld' and (2) i'nawongpada 'deep underworld'. The shallow underworld represents darkness where there is nothing, while the deep lower underworld is full of auric energy. This is the home of spirits of good persons who drowned and other helpful spirits. They function to aid new things that are coming into being such as new ideas, visions, and dreams of various kinds, and they give their aid to only selected souls in the terrestrial world. All the Akawaio worlds described are separated not so much by distance or by time, but by their spiritual vibrational wavelength. Thus, they interpenetrate and surround the physical and material. They occupy the same space but represent different dimensions. This why the Akawaios see the vertical representation of the cosmos as embracing a multidimensional universe, syrnbolising the essential unity of all life, at all levels. The division of the cosmos as discussed here is superimposed onto the human being in the following way: first the human being is analogous to the vertical pillar that represent the cosmic worlds. Therefore the human body is seen as being divided into three cosmic divisions: the head and chest representing the celestial world, the abdomen and lower extremities representing the terrestrial world, and the earth beneath human feet representing the subterranean world. The body itself is called puns 'flesh/meat. The mouth mida and the anus wase'ma are the front and back door of the body and they represent the entrance and exit of the soullspirit and the energy and life force of the body. The crown nagata draws energy for the body from Sun Father woi, feeding the three

72 types of souls: a'kwa 'brightness or light', a'kwari 'soullspirit or energyllife force' of the body, and a'kwari'pi the 'ex-person, shadow or ghost.' These are discussed in great detail later.
The head area is the place of high knowledge, intelligence and understanding, because the brain nagasek and the mind zenuminggang yeng is located here. In addition, it houses the nose euna, another important body part used for breathing the air, the medium for communication by the body. The heart ewang dobu is where the soul lives within the chest cavity, protecting the general area where the heart is located. Finally the abdomen and the lower extremities also bears important parts of the body but one important part to focus on are the feet, which are responsible for physical movement and balance, and which additionally draw energy from the earth. In summary, there is always energy coming from above, from the sun onto the human being and there is also energy that comes up to him from beneath the earth. This is why it is said that a circular light or auric energy constantly surrounds humans (Fox 2000).
Akawaios define the person in terms of the body-soul unity, in which this soullspirit is distinct but not separate from the physical body. This indicates that when a person dies, something goes and something is left behind, because a separation takes place between the body and the soul. Also, the Akawaios believe that all things animate or inanimate have souls or spirits known as a'kwari in Akawaio. This word originates from two words; a'kwa 'brightness/light7 and the morpheme ari- 'contents' resulting in a'kwari to mean 'that which constitutes brightness or light'. A'kwa is believed to come from the sun, the energy producer and the life force of everything on earth. This is why the sun is a father symbol for the Akawaio people. As mentioned earlier, Akawaios

73 believe the person has three souls: a'kwa 'brightness or life force', a'kwari 'soul or spirit', the true soul and the vitality found in all living things and nature spirits, and a'kwari'pi, the shadow, shade, ghost, past or ex-person or spirit. Of these three, a'kwa the life force and a'kwari the true soul or spirit are the most important. A'kwa 'brightness, life force' is the soul energy-giver, or the life force of a person, that activates the a'kwari soul or spirit. Therefore, when a person dies, it is because a'kwa ceases to give energy to the person, going out like a light bulb and returning to its source, the sun in the sky.
A'kwari' 'true soul' controls the temperament, morale, sanity and the general state of being, the health and happiness of a person. The two components of a'kwari' 'true soul' are erubaru 'breath' and zenuminggang yens 'mind', literally 'the thinking cave or container.' The origin of the breath 'erubaru' is the air, the wind that gives life. It is said to be located in the bloodstream and is assembled near the heart and lungs, and it assists the a'kwari 'true soul' in maintaining the life state of a person. Thus, when a'kwa 'brightness' the energy giver is threatened, the person's a'kwari 'true soul' becomes
weak (exemplified in severe illness). Then when the person dies the breath, 'erubaru ' is
the last to leave the body and is thereafter defined as a'kwari'pi 'ex-person, shadow or ghost', in the aftermath of deterioration of the a'kwa and a'kwari(Fox 1997:34).
The use and power of the 'breath' erubaru is important in Akawaio spirituality and therefore it is widely employed in the healing practices of shamans and ritual blowers. It is also central to reinforcing other kinds of healing such as herbal and other kinds of healing. The importance of 'breath' erubaru is clear in the definition of tareng 'ritual blowing' which refers to a special ritual blowing practice in which the blower

74 'tareng ezak' silently utters special magical petitions, commands and wishes onto a sick person or on a medicine prescribed for himlher. The blowing is done at the end of every utterance and is done by forcing the breath through the mouth or nose or both in short, sharp gusts.
The aim of tareng 'ritual blowing' is to petition the relevant spirits of birds, animals, insects, fishes and plants, through invocations, to assist in the ritual curing of various ailments, such as diarrhoea, flues, tummy aches resulting from all types of illnesses, fevers, measles, tuberculosis, problems associated with pregnancy, insanity and all forms of illnesses associated with human beings. It can also be used to control natural phenomenon that pose a great threat to human life such as storms, earthquakes, floods and earthquakes. Generally there are two types of tareng 'ritual blowingywhich is simply good and bad tareng. Those that cure illnesses are 'good' but those that are used to bring misfortunes and illnesses are bad. Even very honourable tareng healers need to know both good tareng (to cure illnesses) and bad tareng (to protect themselves from it in the hands of less scrupulous tareng users). From the church standpoint, all tareng is just plain evil, since any spirit that does not come directly from God is considered to come directly from the Devil. From the standpoint of ordinary non-Christian Akawaios, tareng healers 'tareng ezak' are useful, but also quite dangerous, since they have the power to curse as well as to heal.
The next component of a person's soul, zenuminggang yens 'thinking cavey a'kwar'i, refers to the mind. It controls wisdom and understanding, and maintains a person's mental stability. It is located in the head closer to the forehead. Only a few persons are said to be wise and intelligent, mostly the shamans, tribal elders and their

75 ancestors; they are known as pu'kena'tong 'wise ones'. They are understood as having more shamanic and other spiritual powers, which makes them suitable arbitrators of their society.
There are several ways in which the a'kwari' leaves the body. Contrary to western notions, a'kwari' 'soul' is not at rest during sleep and death. Rather, during these times the spirit leaves the body to travel all over, to continue to do things under slightly altered conditions. Consequently, activities like dreams are considered real, for it is the celestial spirit alone that is in control of what a person dreams, while in waking conditions it is the spirit in the body, or the person, who controls action in everyday life. This is why, in Akawaio spirituality, dreams are part of a person's history.
Visions are also another way in which the soul a'kwari' leaves the body, and whatever is seen during visions is considered to be real, as well. Shamans sometimes indulge in fasting and stimulants during their training, as these activities result in abnormal body functions that make it easier to achieve the skill to send out their souls to communicate with other spirits. Their physical bodies remain while their spirits go up. This exemplifies the belief that there is a soul in the human body, illustrating how a separation of the body into two parts is very real for Akawaios.
In addition, one important feature pertaining to the soul is its transference from the body of its owner into other animate and inanimate objects. This is easily practiced by Shamans 'piyai'chang' and the shamanic killer kanaimo. The Akawaio shaman can visibly change into a jaguar in order to attack an enemy or to traverse the forest in safety when negotiating with spirits. At other times, he does this to traverse the tridimensional plane of the universe. While in a trance, he can become a bird or simply separate his soul

76 from his body and ascend. While the neophyte can achieve this by ingesting large amounts of hallucinogenic drugs, the shaman can do this because his body has become a receptacle for achieving spiritual trances and ascensions, usually after repeated, prolonged social isolation, sexual repression, fasting and special diets.
For the Akawaio shaman his powers are luminous, in keeping with his soul, intelligence and wisdom, which he can easily transfer into objects through shapechanging and creating illusions. However the main thing is that, because the mental potentialities of both man and beast are considered as being the same by Akawaios, they can communicate with each other through telepathy. Birds and beast are affmes, and a part of the interdependence that exists between the natural and the supernatural world. There is power in plants, rocks, stones and streams and this is an extension of the soul a 'kwariin humans and animals (Fox 1997:38).
Finally, Akawaios believe in the continued everlasting existence of the soullspirit a'kwari after the destruction of the physical body, at which time it becomes known as a'kwari'pi 'shadow or ghost'. The a'kwari'pi reaps the reward or punishment for the good or the bad things a person has done while alive. Thus, souls that were good go up to the sky and bad spirits remain disembodied on earth. Sometimes good souls could be buried in the house of the deceased, which is either abandoned or burnt to avoid interference by the surviving kin group. In this Akawaio tradition, the dead is buried with all his belongings for his future use.
The one area where speech originates is in the brain, in the same cavity as the mind zenuminggang yeng. Since language is a given, it is only activated after birth when a child breathes the air, the medium of communication, for the first time. If any child

77 grows up unable to speak, the child is deemed to be a bad spirit re-incarnated, sent to punish families who may have done evil things. This is why it is always very hard to find husbands and wives for mute individuals in Akawaio society, who are called 'miyaimu bing' meaning 'one without speech'. They are also treated very differently by their relatives and other people at all times.
2.5 The Influences of Akawaio Spirituality on the Akawaio Language The implications of the Akawaio spiritual worldview is evident in all aspects of
their culture, and the focus in this section is on the obvious ways in which it has influenced the Akawaio language. It will be shown how they perceive speech and language, and how this perception is mirrored in classification of the speech genres under study (see Chapter 5). Of course, the detailed study will be limited to Akawaio speech classifications that will have implications for the speech genres analysed in this study. In addition, this section provides a snapshot of the interrelatedness that exists between all aspects of Akawaio culture, illustrating why it is difficult to separate 'ways of speaking' from all other forms of Akawaio social life.
First, extrapolating from the previous discussion on Akawaio spirituality, it is observed that maing 'speech' emanates from within the cosmos. It comes from the wind and is acquired at birth when a child breathes and makes contact with the air, the medium of communication. Speech is a given spiritual skill and the foundations for activating it lie in the human head in the brain cavity. Within the cosmic divisions of the human body, the brain is defined as the high place of knowledge, understanding, and intelligence. It is not surprising therefore, that the Akawaios locate the foundations of speech within this

78 area, where the mind is also located. And although speech is a given, and exists within the spiritual cosmos, it is only activated by some mechanism in the brain. This is why maing has a spiritual significance that could only be appreciated by the Akawaios. Because all the other classifications of 'ways of 'speaking' begin with the notion of maing 'speech', it appears to be the most basic category, and it is therefore considered as the foundation of the basic semantic domain of Akawaio speech (see Figure 4.1).
Second, the spiritual implication for the word 'ka'pong', which the Akawaios have used to call themselves, is not a mere accident. Rather, it originates in the very word ka'pong pada 'celestial world' described in Akawaio cosmology as belonging to the most sacred place in the sky, and the home of the first Akawaian ancestors who were considered as the group of humans par excellence. Thus, the Akawaios have always believed that they came f?om the sky, fiom ka'pong pada 'celestial world'. Ka'pong means 'someonelsomething from the sky' and its etymology lies in two words kak 'sky' and pong 'on/from7. Today it has evolved to mean, depending on context, an Akawaio person, any Amerindian person, or any human beinglperson at all.
Even so, the term for 'people' functions to define a tribal distinction, acting as a special name7 among many Amerindian groups in the Amazon (e.g., Guyaki- Ache meaning 'the people', the Arawete- Bide 'person'; Arawak-Lokono meaning 'the people', etc.). This is because spiritually, they view their communities as a totality with an interior unity. For the Akawaios, this notion reflects how they see the cosmic universe. Defining themselves in this way, calling someone non-ka'pong is sometimes pejorative7 disdainhl and insulting (Fox 1997:57). One important spiritual reasoning behind this distinction is that outsiders are seen as participating in humanity to a lesser degree? a

79 perception that affirms the superiority of each Amerindian cultural self and justifies the refusal to recognise others as equals (Clastres 1994146).
This spiritual position is governed by divide law and was created by the
ancestor^'^ the founders of the society. To disobey this means the alteration of the body
social for the Amerindians (Clastres 1994:156). Considering the discussion before on Akawaio spiritual identification, it is not surprising to note that they still remain apart fiom each other in the same district, and intermarriages are kept to a minimum. (Although signs of this changing were observed during the 1999 and 2001 field trips.) Each community still deliberately maintains a certain distance? both literally and figuratively creating the history of retaining distinct identities in terms of geography in the Upper Mazaruni District. Consequently, Akawaios living in the Kukui area call themselves kukuikoks 'tribe from kukui'? those living at kako kagorgoks 'tribe fiom kako', and those who live within the Kamarang river range kamranigoks 'tribe from Kamarang'. These distinctions are maintained to avoid the diffusion of their identity as 'all with all'? overgeneralising exchange and fiiendship. Distinctions are maintained to prevent their society from losing its individuality7which would be a movement towards social death, because the relationships within the small social group, and the uniformity of identity within that groupyis the essence of life within that group. In a very important wayythis is why warfare was always eminent in early Akawaio warrior societies, because violence had the structural status of maintaining group identity (Fox 1996158).
Thirdly?as observed beforeythe foundations for Akawaio spirituality is based on the definition of the person in terms of the cosmos. This is centred around three terms in Akawaio; a'kwa 'brightness or light7; a'kwarf 'that which constitutes brightness7

80 therefore it is the 'true soul' or spirit or the life forcelvitality found in living things and; a'kwari'pi 'shadow', ghost or past-person. These words are now part of the Akawaio grammar and they have evolved to have other meanings while retaining their original forms. This is shown in Figure 2.1.

!I

?-

( 1 ) a'kwa (n) is still 'brightness? light' and a'kwa (Vtr) also means 'to scrape something until it is polished'; a'kwabe (adv) means 'very bright'? a'kwazak (n) mean 'something that is polished7.
(2) The etymology of a'kwari (n) 'that which constitutes brightness7 or 'true soullspirit7 originates from two words a'kwa 'brightness or light7and ari 'contents'? hence its literal meaning 'the contents of light7.Ari 'contents7 has given way to several forms?such as ari'to (v) 'to fill up a container' where -'to is a suffix, the morpheme indicating 'to provide someonelsomething with the item bearing the suffix? in this case providing a container with contents? and a r g a or arga (v) meaning 'to vomit7 or 'to empty a container' (lit. 'deprive something of contents').
(3) A'kwari'pi (n) 'shadow, ghost?past or ex-person7 is a further development of the a'kwa paradigm. When the suffix -'pi 'Past, ex-' is attached to a'kwari 'spiritlsou17, it means 'what was a spiritlsoul', or the soullspirit in the past? the
shadow, the ex-person. This same suffix? as both - ri'pi and as -'pf7is found on
nouns throughout the grammar indicating 'what used to be in the past', and on verbs (only as -'pi) as the general term that indicates past tense in Akawaio (see Chapter 3 for more details). There are other forms which have evolved fiom a'kwari 'spiritlsou17such as a'kwarga (v) 'to force someone against their will7, created by adding the suffix -ga 'deprivelremove' to the root a9kwari7meaning literally 'deprive someone of their spiritlsoul.' From this verb stem comes the

83 further nominalization a'kwargazak (n) 'someone who was forced to do something against their will'. There are other ways in which the Akawaio spirituality has influenced the grammatical structure of the Akawaio language. Such areas are the Akawaio possessive and plurality systems. Thus, the assertion made in Akawaio spirituality about the uniqueness of a person bears fruit in the notion that every person bears the principle of the inviolate basic integrity. This reasoning runs through even the morphology of the Akawaio language. For instance, words which express coercion in English cannot be translated into Akawaio in the same way. Consider English sentences like 'The captain ruled his people at Wararnadong' which when translated in Akawaio would be kiyapting eji t'idombadong a'koro Waramadong bo, literally 'The captain is with his people/relatives at Waramadong.' Also, 'I have a sister' translates into Akawaio as tiyagong ge eaik, literally 'I am with sister,' 'I am sistered,' or even 'I live with sister.' 'To be with' or 'to live with' in an Akawaio sense is a way to express possession, hence it is used in this way as a mark of respect. In Akawaio this interpersonal reference is couched in the grammar and focuses on individual integrity, whereas expressing individual such uniqueness cannot be done in English except by using several words. Therefore a person in Akawaio society exists among other entities, and he is only one within this entity, and yet his status as an individual is also very powerful. Another grammatical mirror of Akawaio spirituality is that many natural things within the environment cannot be grammatically possessed, a reflection of the fact that Akawaios spiritually view 'things' within the environment as unpossessible. Both animate and inanimate entities have souls and spirits because they are extensions of the

84 existence of the soullspirit in humans and animals. However, some animate things have stronger, powerful and useful souls, which places them into the animate category. For instance, some plants have souls, power and vitality, therefore they have higher curing properties and are classified according to their potency. Some stones are also said to be powerful for curing illnesses and therefore are important items in the shaman's paraphernalia. In addition, all forms of natural phenomena are classified as animate.
This reasoning here is that 'owning things' in Akawaio worldview precedes rules pertaining to possession in the Akawaio grammar. There is one main concept, iwanok 'mine, my own,' which could only refer to hammocks, boats, other hunting and household implements, pens, pencils, and shoes, but cannot refer to relatives, husbands, wives chickens, pets of all kinds, people, spirits, children, stars, moon, sun, sky, clouds, rivers, land, mountains and so on. English sentences like 'This is my mountain' cannot even be translated into Akawaio and make sense because uro wl'k sero which is the literal translation of 'this is my mountain' is never said, therefore will not make sense. Neither can Akawaios perceive of a sentence like uro tuna sero 'this is my river or my water'. Something of this kind can only make sense if reference is made to water in a bucket that one has in one's possession. In this case, the acceptable Akawaio sentence is uro tuna'kwa-i sero 'this is my water' or uro iwanok sero tuna 'this water is mine'.
People cannot be owned for the reasons described before about personal integrity, so captured war prisoners were taken by Akawaios but were not owned. Most times these were women who contributed to the continuity of Akawaio culture. A person is a spiritual entity and has autonomy which is guided by a powerful spirit, which no one else has the right to own. Pets are referred to as just yigl'ng 'my pet' and cannot be iwanok 'mine, my

85
own7. One grammatical morpheme, - i 'possessed7, marks only inanimate possessed
nouns, which does not include natural phenomena and other inanimate things that are considered animate. Therefore, it can be attached to nouns such as yargo-i 'my hat'; samba-i 'my adze7;ye'kiyari-i 'my food7; beni-i 'my pen'; gwareda-i 'my book7 or mira'ta-i 'my door7.However, -i cannot become a suffix on such words as oudo 'house' to mean 'my house7 because there is a less spiritual term which can make this possible. Thus, uro iwik 'my house7 is acceptable and possible in Akawaio but notice that there is a completely different word used for a possessible house. The generic term for house oudo defines the house as a spiritual entity, analogous to the human body therefore the comic universe (Fox 2000).
Also, field linguists and anthropologists would even today observe the puzzled look on the face of an Akawaio informant when asked for a word for 'deer' -- the answer will be, "which one?" because there is the generic term zari 'deer'(genera1)' then all the particular types of deer such as kariaugi 'brown bush deer' (Mazama Nemorivaga); waigeng 'savannah deer7 (Cariacus Savanorum) and kusari 'red-deer' (Mazama Americana) and collectively these animals are referred to as ok 'game.' Similarly, the generic term for a female girl or woman is uri'chang but then there are many types of Akawaio females such as; manjik 'ritual name for female only used in healing chants7; ama'nong 'beautiful girl'; emaze 'girl with menstruation'; manak agang 'girl before puberty'; ma'nong 'kinship fond name for girl'; nosamichi 'old woman' or no'sang. However, collectively these types can be defined into such types as uri'chami'chi 'a set of girls or women'; ama'nomichi ' a set of beautiful girls'.

86 As a result, Akawaio speakers have great freedom in whether they choose to refer to an item as being either generic or particular. Generally, this way for classifying things is based in the Akawaio spirituality that constantly classifies things holistically, in the very way the spiritual cosmos is defined. This is why it is said to be interrelated and is an entity unto itself, a phenomenon sui generis. It follows that the Akawaio language reflects a particular type of spiritual worldview and therefore this has encouraged its speakers to communicate in a particular way. Thus, while English distinguishes between singular and plural because it divides the physical universe into individual items; the Akawaio perceive unified categories of beings or things, and within this collection choose to specifically identify an individual member of that category. Finally, plurality in Akawaio in the traditional sense was not based on whether or not there was more than one of an item within a category. Rather, items were assessed collectively as mass nouns or as generic and particular forms, resulting in the absence of nouns which marked as singular and plural in the Akawaio grammar. In more recent times and because of contact with particularly western cultures, new plural forms have evolved that mimic English language structures. Presently, Akawaio has at least six plural forms: yamoklamok, -tong/-dong, -sang, -rang, nang, and gonglkong. Half of these are nominal or verbal suffixes, the other half postnominal and postverbal particles. The general rule of plurality in the Akawaio language is that yamoklamok could only be used with animate nouns, whereas -tong/-dong is free to occur with either animate or inanimate nouns. Yamok/amok in represents an innovative form, and has no grammatical cognates in even closely related Cariban languages; -tong/-dong reconstructs to ProtoCarib *tomo, but in most modem Cariban languages it marks plurality only for animate

87 entities. So the old animate plural marking has extended its distribution in Akawaio, and a new form of marking the animate plural has emerged.
2.6 Akawaio Family Systems The traditional Akawaio family included parents, children and other relatives who
were either patrilineally or matrilineally related. Groups of large families give way to extended family systems or joint family systems. Presently, this extended family arrangement (though with some changes) still continues as the core of some Akawaio settlements. The ideal component of the size of extended traditional Akawaio family groups depended on either the arrival and departure of visitors, or on new alignments or desertions. However, the core of the extended family was an Akawaio man and his wife or wives, unmarried children and his daughter's husbands and their children. Regardless, there could be various combinations of categories of relatives which could be created based on mutual liking and convenience. Included in such families were the elderly siblings of those who had lost their relatives (Butt-Colson 1954). Families live together in this way to cooperate in establishing farms, building new homes, feeding each other and taking care of their elderly relatives and their children while they attend school.
While they no longer live in one large family house, family members live in a cluster of small houses in the same location, to ensure that they are close to each other. This type of arrangement is still prototypical of communal life at Waramadong. Residences remain matrilocal and are economically motivated. Thus, an Akawaio man who takes a wife is expected to set up home with the girl's parents at least until he can construct his own home near to his wife's parents. This makes it easier for him to fulfil

88 his responsibilities to his in-laws, particularly by serving and assisting his father-in-law in all male related activities such as constructing houses, clearing farmlands for cassava cultivation, and making products for household use, fishing and hunting. These activities of the male and others that females have to do have now doubled as some Akawaios are now wage earners.
2.7 The Akawaio Economy The Akawaios have free use of forest products from within their own territory or
from other crown lands near to their homelands. Therefore, they utilised clay deposits for making pottery (a pastime they still indulge in today) and farm and hunt in the forest. The waterways are accessible to them for fishing and they are experts in making boats from the bark of the baromalli trees.
Their economy is still based on traditional subsistence farming and the most important crop grown by them is the bitter cassava egi yek, which accounts for 90% of the cultivated farm space. In the remainder of the farm they plant some root vegetables, fruits, bananas, pineapples, sugar cane, and hot peppers. Their staple diet consists of egi 'cassava bready and tuma 'pepperpot', cooked with meat or fish or just with peppers and cassareep (a local condiment). They make a variety of local drinks from cassava, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, bananas, plantains, sugarcane and several combination dishes and snacks. In addition, they are involved in mining, some logging, small commercial businesses, wage earning jobs and bartering across the borders between Guyana and Venezuela, Guyana and Brazil, and Guyana and Suriname. There are even Guyanese

89 Akawaio business owners who travel as far as Columbia to acquire goods for sale in their Guyanese shops.
Over the years there have been attempts by the Guyanese government to introduce techniques of scientific farming and the growing of cash crops. This was a failure because there were some aspects of this that were not carefully planned to make it successful. At Waramadong the response to these attempts were very good and the residents were motivated to plant cash crops but transportation, storage and sale of such crops as cabbage, tomatoes, onions, peanuts and a variety of beans remained the biggest limitation for expanding such an economy. Today, slash and bum agriculture is still the most important livelihood of the Akawaios and is still the basis of their economy.
2.8 Education Involving the Akawaios in the wage earning market depends on sound education
and qualification. When this happens, there are still not enough jobs available for them in the local Akawaio communities. This is because the national Guyanese educational policy continue to perpetuate a mainstream approach to education, which cannot be appropriate to the needs of local Amerindian communities. It is geared towards a formal system that would only meet the needs of the job market in mainstream Guyanese society, and seems to have the main function of helping to integrate the Amerindian people into mainstream society. While there are advantages to this, education for Akawaios in this case has led to alienation, doubts about identity, detachment from roots, threats to traditional language, loss of respect for traditional Akawaio ways, a generation gap and communities that are in constant conflict.

90 One reason for this alienation is that education came together with Christianity, both striving to 'domesticate' the Amerindians. Thus, churches and schools formed the nucleus around which permanent Amerindian communities developed out of the more traditional semi-nomadic lifestyle. For example, in 1946 there was one mission school in the upper Mazaruni District; by 1970 there were four mission schools and one government school catering to 90% of the village population. As mentioned before, because education was the primary tool for integrating Amerindians into mainstream society, this process had to have some structure for implementing it. It was initiated first by the missionaries when their activities increased among the Amerindians in the mid1800s. First, Anglicans and Roman Catholics began to work among coastal Amerindians and thereafter moved to the deep interior. Other denominations such as the Lutherans, Methodists, Presbyterians, the Pilgrim Holiness, the Seventh-day-Adventist and the Unevangelised Field Mission followed suit. The strategy used by these denominations was to establish boarding schools for Amerindian children, to separate them from their parents as a means for re-socialising them under more "civilized" conditions (Fox 1986). For instance, in the Upper Mazaruni, Akawaio children were taken to Paruima Mission, a Pemong Arekuna village to attend the Davis Indian Training School established by the Seventh-day-Adventist at Kaikan, a selected location away from the Paruima village. Akawaio and Arekuna children lived solely at the dorms and were not allowed to go home whenever they wanted to. There were strict rules and regulations that were enforced, and corporal punishment was the punishment for breaking these rules. All mission children were to dress in western clothing and they were required to look even better on sabbath days. In many ways

91 children were away for long periods without any contact with their parents. In some cases, children were taken away to the United States and adopted. There are at least three Arekuna children who were taken away in the aftermath of this training school, who have never returned to Paruima even to visit their parents.
A recent development is the government's hinterland scholarship scheme, which allows children from these areas to attend secondary schools in Georgetown if they have achieved the standard requirement marks in the secondary school entrance examination. This scheme is based on the premise that the exposure would adequately enable Amerindian students of greater ability to benefit from a core curriculum, in order to acquire certifiable knowledge and skills. Many Akawaio children have accepted this scholarship, but have found it difficult to adapt to their new environment; others have successfully finished their studies, but now cannot find jobs within their own communities.
Desire for access to secondary school education was a continuing issue among the Akawaios, but this issue has largely been resolved since the new secondary school was built at Waramadong in 1999, intended to serve the entire Upper Mazaruni. The only problem is that education within such a school operates on an English-only basis, causing older parents and grandparents to complain that this was causing barriers to communication between them and their children and grandchildren. For such Akawaio parents, the kindergarten school is particularly annoying and threatening to them and their language, because young Akawaio children are taught in English at an early age, and they are even pressured to speak it at home. Grandmothers were annoyed because in

92 some cases they could no longer understand what their four year old grandchild was saying to them because it was in English.
Another problem has been that young Akawaio children attending kindergarten and primary schools are seen as speaking a hybrid AkawaioIEnglish dialect, described as the language of confused Akawaio children (Field Interviews 1999, 2000 conducted at Waramadong). This does not mean that Akawaio parents do not subscribe to education, because they do, but they are horrified by the quick changes it is bringing to the next generation of Akawaio speakers. Parents and other local interests are not consulted during the planning stages, which are carried out quietly in institutionalised statecontrolled environments, dominated by non-Amerindian educationists. But even with all these changes going around them, every single Akawaios in the Upper Mazaruni is fluent in the traditional language, Akawaio. Akawaios are just very proud people and the core of this is being able to speak their own language. There are still adult Akawaios who cannot speak English regardless of the long contact they have had with English and English speakers. Therefore village meetings, church sermons and social events are still conducted in this Akawaio. There is still the need for a translator if an event is going to be conducted in English for the benefit of the elders who cannot understand it.
Summarizing this discussion on the ethnography of the Akawaio people, it is clear that they are a distinct Amerindian group who inhabit communities located in the highland regions of Guyana. A brief insight into how Akawaio territory was politically defined as the Upper Mazaruni District served to access the political role the state machinery plays in the administration of Amerindian communities in general. This helps to comprehend the degree of acculturation and social change and the general threat this

93 poses for the Akawaio language at Waramadong. In addition, this is also part of Akawaio history which is important to compare with the oral history of Waramadong as told by the village elders during the field research. In particular, it serves to pinpoint the historical antecedents prior to its settlement, in order to understand the present settlement and migration patterns which had lead to Akawaio language variation.
A main focus of this ethnography has also been ' Akawaio spiritualityyalong with Akawaio identity, family organisation, economy and education. This was important since it is the core of Akawaio life and is particularly useful for examining the influences it has on the Akawaio grammar, hence their 'ways of speakingy. Generally, these sociopolitical, socio-cultural, socio-economic and linguistic antecedents serve to set the stage for understanding past and present Akawaio life, their speech forms within this context, and thus they provide a pathway for understanding Akawaio language variation.
In conclusion, Akawaios could be described as living semi-traditional lives, and in spite of institutionalised cultural assimilation, they continue to retain their identity. The foundation for this retention is their language Akawaio, which is still spoken by most of the Akawaio population, in addition to speaking English, Spanish, Portuguese and several other Amerindian languages. It is no wonder that studies such as this one seek to redefine the Akawaio language as it strives to survive amidst the fervour of other language intrusions. This attempt is evident in the discussion that follows in Chapter 3, where Akawaio is placed in the Cariban language family, to identify it with its most closely related sister Amerindian languages. In addition, Chapter 3 offers a minimal sketch of certain aspects of the grammar and phonology of Akawaio.

Chapter 3 A Brief Sketch of the Grammar and Phonology of the Akawaio Language
This chapter provides a brief sketch of the grammar and phonology of the Akawaio language. First, it extrapolates from many earlier linguistic studies done on the language (Adam 1905, Edwards 1977, 1978b, 1980, Stegman 2000), to trace the history of Akawaio language study and the implications this has for the changes that are observed in the text data under study. Then the grammar sketch is presented, primarily to serve as a resource to help understand the analysis of the texts appendices. In this way, information is also made available to comparative linguistics to the classification and reconstruction of the Cariban language family, two research areas that are still not properly defined and standardized within the family.
The grammar sketch is limited to a brief presentation of the verbal inflectional morphology encountered in the annotated texts, designed to show how they fit together into systems, and somewhat to show their allomorphy. One resource that will be drawn upon as part of this description is work in progress by the researcher and Spike Gildea towards a reference grammar of Akawaio. In future work, a lexicon should be created with a list of all lexical roots and some complex stems as encountered in the annotated texts and the sociolinguistic questionnaires. Much farther in the future, the researcher and Gildea hope to collaborate on a full dictionary with illustrative examples for each allomorph and meaning of each morpheme.

95 3.1 Previous work on Akawaio
There seems to be very little work done on the Akawaio language in the past. The few publications that exist cover the periods between 1893-2002. The first attempt was the work of Reverend William Brett, who published Akawaio translations of the first part of Genesis and the gospel of St. Matthew, with extracts from other gospels, in 1893 and 1898 respectively. While this cannot be compared to a grammar sketch, it was a record of at least one dialect of Akawaio spoken at the time in Guyana. The other important aspect of this is that it represented a record of the Akawaio language spoken by speakers who lived at missions in the Pomeroon and Monica Districts. According to Brett, these Akawaios were migrants from such areas as Barama, Waini, Cuyuni and other rivers between the Orinoco and the Essequibo. These are all areas within which there are few or no existing Akawaio communities today. The Pomeroon and Moruca is now the home lands of the Arawak (Lokono), the Warraus and the Caribs (kari'na) and is politically defined as the Northwest District. Today the Akawaios are mostly settled in the Upper Mazaruni District, which was declared a reservation in the early 1950s (see Chapter 2).
At a glance, it is evident that the Akawaio spoken today is quite different from the Akawaio presented in Brett's work. It is not clear how much of the difference is due to dialectal variation and how much to Brett's translations and his writing system, which missed many important Akawaio phonemic distinctions.
The second study was the first grammatical sketch of Akawaio, done in 1905 by M. Lucien Adam in his Grammaire De L'Accawai, which was based solely on the justmentioned Akawaio translations by Brett. In the first footnote to this study, Adam quotes Brett (in English) as saying that 'the dialects of the Akawaio language varied

96 considerably owing to the vast extent of the country over which it is spoken.' (Adam 1905:43). He further stated that there were in Akawaio some sounds, both vowels and consonants, which the English language could not accurately express (Adam 1905: 43, 44). This first linguistic description of Akawaio presents such grammatical components as rules for pronunciation, rules governing pronouns, indefinite adjectives, interrogatives, argumentatives and dimunitives, conjunctions, verbs, future tense, imperatives, future imperatives and present participles. However, Brett's orthography (and thus all of Adam's examples) is missing a way to represent the two central vowels and has various problems with consonants, especially the crucial glottal stops. These must be mistakes, as Adam's 'Accawai' forms seem to be more changed from modem Pembng and Makushi than is modem Akawaio; another 150 years of linguistic change should have made modem Akawaio still more different. The other issue is that because Adam's data came solely from the texts translated by Brett, it is not clear to what extent the Akawaio language presented in his study might have been representative of even that dialect of Akawaio as spoken in real situations and contexts.
Following these attempts, there were other translation attempts in the late 1900s. Thus, the Seventh-Day-Adventist Missionaries have translated parts of the bible and published a booklet of gospel songs and scripture lesson study booklets in the Akawaio and Arekuna languages. The initiatives of Elder Cott and his wife and Elder Cascalan are well known to the Akawaios and the Arekunas, both at Waramadong and Paruima. However the direct sources cannot be quoted at this time because of their unavailability in the libraries in Georgetown. Personal copies of some older residents of Waramadong have been long destroyed, and in the attempt to see a copy of what is perhaps the last

97 song booklet would have entailed a 30-mile journey on foot to a satellite Akawaio community.
The third attempt for studying the Akawaio came with the launching of the hydroelectric power project in the Upper Mazaruni District. As an answer to this, the Amerindian Languages Project -- now known as the Amerindian Research Unit -- was established at the University of Guyana by Guyanese sociolinguist, Dr. Walter Edwards. The aim was to capture the Akawaio and Arekuna languages within the existing communities in anticipation of the massive resettlement drive which was to accompany the development of a hydro-electric power dam in the Upper Mazaruni District. An entity known as the Upper Mazaruni Development Authority was mandated to administer the Project to tap new resources for cheap energy for Guyana. This meant that the Upper Mazaruni, the homelands of the Akawaio and the Arekuna, was to be flooded extensively, resulting in resettlement schemes that would have interrupted the lives of these two groups, perhaps affecting the viability of their languages.
The Amerindian Languages Project began to address this situation by going to work on the description of both the Akawaio and Arekuna languages. In 1977, the first publication was released, entitled An Introduction to the Akawaio and Arekuna Peoples of Guyana. Within its pages were a short history of the two groups, a brief linguistic introduction of the two languages and substantial trilingual word lists, resembling a dictionary with English entries keyed to Akawaio and Arekuna translations. This list covered a wide area of vocabulary, organised under headings such as animals, birds, household implements, fishes, greeting and the numbering system. There were also two

98 Akawaio and Arekuna story texts that were translated, paying attention to their literal and free translations in English.
This publication was followed by a series of short linguistic articles written by Walter Edwards (1978a-b). Thereafter, a second major publication was released (Edwards 1980), entitled A Short Grammar and Dictionary of the Akawaio and Arekuna Languages of Guyana, published by the Amerindian Languages Project, University of Guyana. This dictionary was to be the first of several, and it was prefaced with a historical introduction and a linguistic introduction, mainly dealing with the phonemic structure, order typology, pronouns, articles, personal prefixes, possession, number, copular constructions, tense and aspect and imperatives in both Akawaio and Arekuna. The dictionary was structured in such a way that there was a section with AkawaioIArekuna words translated into English, then an English to AkawaioIArekuna section. The words in the publication were organised in conventional dictionary fashion, in alphabetical order from A to Z, even though there were some letters within this range that were non-existent in the Akawaio and Arekuna languages.
So both Edwards (1977) and Edwards (1980) gave extensive lists of words, and the very rudimentary beginnings of an Akawaio grammar sketch. However, Edwards' writing system did not capture all the vowel distinctions well, while his understanding of Akawaio grammar was extremely limited. This limitation is clearly shown by the absence of any analysis of morphological complexity in the language, the inconsistency of the orthography used to record the Akawaio wordlists, and a syntactic analysis that simply imposed the English part of speech analysis onto the Akawaio lexical items.

99 Eighteen years after the completion of Edward's work came a new interest in Akawaio, shown in the examples of Akawaio sentences in Spike Gildea's (1998) publication, On Recontructing Grammar: Comparative Cariban Morophosyntax. Gildea's examples were taken from Adam (1905) and Edwards (1977). In 1998-99, a field methods class on the Akawaio language was conducted in the linguistics department at Rice University, Houston, Texas; in 1999-2000, Akawaio was again selected as the language for field methods. The efforts of the graduate and undergraduate students in this second class resulted in the initial development of the Shoebox database in Akawaio. In addition, student papers from both classes were written on various aspects of the Akawaio language, covering a wide area of themes, including vowels, nominalizations, causatives, certainty particles, negation and argument structure. There was also an attempt to standardise a temporary writing system for use in a possible future Akawaio literacy program. In January, 2000 Ray Stegeman, a missionary and Bible translator attached to the Summer Institute of Linguistics, presented aspects of his work on Akawaio at the Annual Meeting of SILLA in Chicago. He presented the first scientific results of his project in a paper entitled A Brief Grammar Sketch of Akawaio. The dialect of Akawaio upon which the study was based is spoken at Jawalla, Kukui river in the Upper Mazaruni District. Stegeman's paper outlined his analysis of the phonemic inventory of Akawaio, then mostly focused on the structure of noun phrases. The usefulness of Stegeman's work is in the study of another dialect of Akawaio in the Upper Mazaruni, which can serve as the basis for comparison in future studies of Akawaio.

100 Most recently, in 2002 Anatol Stefanowitsch, a PhD student in linguistics at Rice University, published 'Causative Constructions in Akawaio.' Stefanowitsch's study is based on the data he elicited during the field methods class in 1999-2000 at Rice University. Until recently these were the only studies done on the Akawaio language. Currently, the author of this dissertation is involved in a project to write a descriptive grammar of Akawaio and to develop a dictionary, collection of traditional texts and educational materials.
3.2 Classification of Akawaio within the Cariban family There is almost no data for evaluating the present linguistic and anthropological classifications for categorizing Cariban languages, much less to explain clearly the place of Akawaio within this language family. This is due to the lack of good descriptions of lexicon and grammar for most Cariban languages (see Gildea 1998, Chapter I), and in particular for the Akawaio language and the languages it is most closely related to. Girard (1971) remains the only work that actually uses modem data to make family-wide comparisons, which then support reconstructions and classifications of the Cariban language family. But his work is based on a very small amount of weak data (Gildea 1998.6-11). The absence of reliable data remains core to disagreements about the placement of the Akawaio within the family. Girard (1971) placed the Akawaio with the Carib (kari'na, Carib proper, Galibi) group while Durbin (1977) saw them as a subgroup of the Makushi, Pemong and the Purucoto within his wide schema of the East-WestGuiana branch. Migliazza (1985) placed some 28 languages taken from the literature into six actual linguistic communities; Makushi, Arekuna, Taurepang, Kamarakoto, Akawayo

101 and Patamuna but then, based on his field notes, he suggested that the speech of these six communities actually only constitutes three separate languages consisting of Pemong (with dialects Arekuna, Kamarakoto and Taurepang); Ka'pong (with two dialects Akawaio, and Patamuna) and Makushi (Gildea l998:5). Kaufman (1994) makes Pemong, Kapong and Makushi the only three members of his Pkmong Proper Subgroup, adding Purucoto to make up the Pemong Group. Gildea (2000) accepts Kaufman's Pemong Group, but he links it to his Venezuelan Branch (Figure 2).
It seems like modem specialists all agree that Migliazza was correct in putting these six 'language' names into a single, close group, but nobody really agrees on where this group belongs in the larger Cariban family.

Figure 3.1. Relationships Amongst some Cariban languages of Guyana and Venezuela (cf. Gildea 2000)

102 And the question continues as to whether even Migliazza's three 'languages' are distinct enough to be considered separate languages. This is based on the fact that a speaker of Arekuna can communicate with an Akawaio speaker without any problems and this is also true for the Makushis understanding the Arekuna. On the other hand, Akawaios have some difficulty communicating with the Makushis while it is very comfortable for them to communicate with the Patamuna who they also call Ingari'ko. The general conclusion is that although there are certainly several differences, conversation is not a major problem. While all these groups recognize this, they have individually seen themselves as distinct peoples both for political and ethnic reasons. From the perspective of the speakers, the names Kapong and Pemong mean "people" or 1.1.person," not the names of their languages. And while the Akawaio do call themselves ka'pong, the Patamuna people call themselves patamuna, from pata 'place' plus muna 'native of.' The speakers of at least these two "dialects" would probably object, both to being lumped together as speakers of a single "language" and to the name chosen for that "language." It seems, therefore, that more linguistic work is needed to place the Akawaios into an accurate category both inside and outside the Cariban Group. This study (and more work in progress) will provide some useful data for that purpose, but until somebody else comes up with similar data for the other Cariban languages, conclusions must stay tentative.

3.3 The Grammar Sketch 3.3.1 Phonology
Table 3.1 shows a table of the phones encountered in the author's own dialect of Akawaio, from Abamang. As can be seen, Abamang Akawaio has greatly elaborated the inventory of consonants. The changes can be categorized in three major groups: palatalization, voicing, and debuccalization. Palatalization created f , tf and p; voicing created b, d, g, z, 3, and d3; debuccalization created ? and r~(Gildea 2001). Makushi and Pemong dialects show both the palatalization and the debucalization, but not the voicing. In vowels, an apparently unconditioned split occurred in which many *o > a in the Venezuelan branch of the Cariban family (Gildea 2001). In a more recent second split, a subset of *e > e and *o > 3.
Table 3.1. Inventory of Phones in Abamang Akawaio Table 3.2 shows the current orthography used for Abamang Akawaio, which conservatively indicates nearly all of the phonetic differences from Table 3.1. The examples throughout the rest of the dissertation use this orthography, rather than the P A , except in some cases where a particular phone is highlighted.

Table 3.2. Abamang Akawaio Orthography
The distribution of these phones is complicated, and it is possible to have different analyses of "underlying form," some more abstract, some more closely identified with surface form. The important allophonic patterns to note are (i) that [3] and [d3] are in free variation, and hence are represented by the same orthographic symbol,j, and (ii), that the actual pronunciation of the glottal stop may vary between a full glottal occlusion, gemination of a following voiceless obstruent, and omission (leaving only the otherwise anomalous intervocalic voiceless obstruent to indicate its presence). The orthography does not distinguish between these pronunciations, and it might even be argued that in more frequent lexical items, the glottal stop should no longer be indicated.
No detailed analysis of Akawaio phonology has been published (although see Edwards 1978a-b), and such an analysis is outside the scope of this study, since the actual pronunciation is more relevant for understanding dialectal variation.
3.3.2 The Morphosyntax of Set I Clauses The Set I verbal system across the Cariban family has been described in Gildea
(1998). The Akawaio Set I clause type is typical of the rest of the family: the personal prefixes indicate both subject and object, with no clear nominative-accusative or ergative-

absolutive pattern seen in the forms of the verbal prefixes or the case-marking. When 3A
acts on 3 0 , the 0 generally precedes the verb and the personal prefix p '3A30'
disappears (la-c). When there is no explicit 3 0 , 3N3S may precede the verb, but the
prefix remains (2a-b).
(1)a. tok ro bada eboroi tok ro pada eboro -i 3Pl Emph home find -RPst 'They reached home.' (RA Piyai'ma Story 093)
b. iwarga eboroi iwarga eboro -i monkey find -RPst 'He found the monkey' (RA Kone'o Story 043)

The personal prefixes on the verb are the clearest indication of the Set I system.
Although the 3A10 and 3A20 prefixes are also found in the other verbal systems as
personal prefixes (referring to 1 and 2 Absolutive), the rest of them are found only on Set
I verbs. The prefixes and the allomorphs encountered in these texts are listed in (3). The
entire set of prefixes is given in Table 1, followed by paradigms for both transitive (4)
and intransitive (5) verbs of different phonological shapes.

Many speakers no longer use the 2A10 and 1A20 verb prefixes, preferring

instead to use the 2A30 and 1A30 prefixes along with the appropriate 0 pronoun

preceding the verb (6a-b).

The Proto-Carib first person plural prefixes have all been lost in Akawaio. The
inclusive and exclusive first person plural pronouns just agree with the third-person
prefix (7a-b).

The Set I personal prefixes only occur with the Set I verb inflections, a set of final
inflections that mark combinations of tense, aspect, mood, and number. The detailed
semantic analysis of the meaning of each suffix is left to future research; Table 3.4 gives
a rough idea of the meaning of each suffix.

primarily with a plural second person A, S or 0 participant; it does not occur with any

other persons of A, S, or 0. Sometimes plural participants may be indicated with the

Relative Clause Formation

Akawaio has a single relativizer, -nek 'Rel' that occurs only on Set I inflected

verbs. If the relativized NP is plural, -nekmay be followed by -nang 'Pl'.

The Morphosyntax of Set I1 Clauses The Full Set I1 verbal system across the Cariban family has been described in several publications by Gildea (1992; 1998, ch. 9; 2000). The Akawaio Full Set I1 verbal system includes a number of different verbal suffixes and some suffixes plus other particles. The past, perfect and nonpast are virtually identical to cognate forms that have been described for Makushi (Abbott 1990) and Pemong (Armellada and Olza 1994, ~ l v a r e z1999). The grammars do not describe a distinct fbture inflection for Makushi and Pemong, and in Akawaio, several different forms appear to function interchangeably to indicate just the future, along with the nonpast form which can also indicate future as well as present. The Set I1 inflections are presented in Table 3.5.

Table 3.5 Set I1 Tense and Aspect Suffixes

The Set I1 verb does not need to have any person person-marking morphology at

all if both subject and object nouns occur in the clause with it. If the absolutive noun

occurs as a free form, it precedes the verb and has no case-marking. But if the absolutive

noun is not in the clauseythen the Set I1 verb bears a personal prefix referring to the SIO.

If the ergative noun occurs as a fiee formyit bears an ergative postposition that varies a

great deal in form depending on dialect: -uya, -yay-wayor -a 'Erg'. If the ergative noun is

not in the clause? then the Set I1 verb bears an ergative enclitic referring to the A. In

some dialects, a lexical subset of intransitive verbs take a verb class prefix, w- 'SA1

between the absolutive prefix and the verb stem. There is no distinct 1+2 absolutive

prefix or ergative enclitic, but there is a unique first person plural inclusive person-

marker, a verbal suffix -fino'1+2S1that precedes the Set I1 tense-aspect suffix.

As seen in the paradigms for padaga 'talk about' and ogu 'eat', the final segment

of the suffixes -dok 'Future' and -zak 'Perfect' undergoes metathesis with the person marker of the first and third person ergative enclitics. Sometimes the second person form

also undergoes this metathesis with the final segment of -zak 'Perfect', making the 1A and

2A forms of the verb sound identical.

The collective verbal suffix -gong 'Coll' follows the Set I1 tense-aspect suffix,

marking collective 2s. The collective verbal suffix -'nogong 'Coll' follows the ergative

enclitic, marking collective second person regardless of whether it is 2A or 2 0 , and

collective 1 0 only when A is third person.

Set I1 verbs can also take a form of the copula as an auxiliary, combining the

perfect aspect and the past tense copula like English to get the past perfect (23a-b).

When the copula is the present tense form mang, the meaning added is less temporal and more modal, giving a sense that the speaker is quite sure of the truth of the statement

The Set I1 past tense, -'pi''Past' is sometimes used in repetition sequences with the

Set I past tense -i 'Recent Past' (24a-b) and in one text example it is used for the second in

a sequence of events that come one right after the other (251, so -'pL and -i really can be

used to mark exactly the same type of past meaning, at least in narratives.

There are so many examples of Full Set I1 past, perfect and nonpast verbs in the

texts that no more will be offered here. However, in over 1,600 records, with easily more

than 3000 inflected verbs, there are only 56 clear Full Set I1 future clauses. From these

3.3.4 The Morphosyntax of Progressive and Desiderative Clauses In addition to the Full Set 11, Akawaio has two innovative inflections, the
Progressive and the Desiderative, that take nominative-accusative morphosyntax. These two inflections both require a copular auxiliary, which is inflected for the person of the S or A, the nominative. The intransitive verb that bears one of these inflections takes no person-marking. For vowel-initial intransitive verbs, there is simply no personal prefix, and for consonant-initial intransitive verbs, the non-agreeing prefix a- 'Gen' is generally used (although there is dialectal variation, so sometimes the prefix is i- 'Gen' and sometimes 0-). The transitive verb that bears one of these inflections will either be immediately preceded by the 0 NP, or will bear a prefix indicating 0. For the Progressive, the 0 prefix is identical to the absolutive prefixes described in section 3.3.3; for the Desiderative, the first and second person prefixes are identical to the absolutive prefixes, but the third person prefix is different.
The innovative progressive inflection is described for the rest of the Cariban family by Gildea (1998, ch. 12), and for Akawaio in particular, by Gildea (2000). The

115 verbal suffix is -bok on transitive verbs (29a-b) and a phonologically conditioned

allomorph of -nobok / -ngbok / -mbok on intransitive verbs (29c-d). The auxiliary is

generally the copula, but sometimes is the verb ko'mam'i 'live', adding a continuous

sense, like English 'keep V-ing' (29b).

'the one that is living in Waramadong' (LE Personal Narrative 032)

The Desiderative inflection is -bai 'Desiderative', source unknown (although possibly related to the postposition bai 'from, through'). Unlike the pan-Cariban desiderative postposition, *-ce, which can take as its object a noun that indicates some item desired by the subject, or which can take as its object a nominalized clause with an oblique agent in the case that the subject desires an action to be undertaken by someone else, the suffix -bai only occurs on verbs, and only in the case that the subject of the clause is the one who wants to do the action described by the verb. The third person prefix for the desiderative verb is an- '30.Desid' (30a), which also co-occurs with any preverbal 0 NP (30b), including the first person pronoun (30c).

The text examples of intransitive desiderative verbs show the expected lack of a

prefix on vowel-initial verbs (3la)' but instead of illustrating the general prefix a- 'Gen',

which would be standard in the author's dialect, the two consonant-initial verbs in the

corpus take no prefix (31b) or the general prefix i- 'Gen' (3lc).

3.3.5 The Morphosyntax of Imperative Clauses There are many imperative inflections in Akawaio, the most common being the
simple imperative -go. But there are also forms that mean 'go and V and 'come and V', a hortative, a mediated imperative (polite for second person, permissive for first and third person), and two vetatives (negative imperatives). Many of these imperative inflections have a collective form as well, indicating a collective subject of imperative. A summary of imperative suffixes can be seen in Table 3.7 below. Imperative inflections take some variations in personal prefixes, which are pointed out preceding the relevant examples.

Meaning Imperative Go.and.Imper Come.and.Imper Mediatedhperative Hortative Vetative Negative Permissive

Plural -d6k -dundok -dunirtok -doik -mbui 'nogong -dou

Table 3.7 Imperative Suffix Forms

The standard imperative is -go, realized as -ko following the glottal stop and as -k following most vowels. When the imperative verb is transitive, 3 0 is treated differently than 1 0 : when the 3 0 NP precedes the imperative verb, there may be no prefix at all (la) or a prefix an- '30.1mper1 (33c-d). A standard 0- '30' prefix occurs on vowel-initial imperative verbs with no preceding NP (33b). The standard y- '10' prefix occurs on vowel-initial imperative verbs with first person 0 (34). The intransitive imperative verb bears an invariant prefix -i 'Imp' on consonant-initial verbs (35a) and no prefixation on vowel-initial verbs (35b-c). The collective form of the imperative suffix is illustrated in

The mediated imperative is a polite command when used with second person.

When used with first person it translates as 'Let me ...' The suffix -ik 'Med.Imp' marks

the mediated imperative verb, and the Set I prefixes occur with the IS (40a-b), 1A30 (4la), and 2A (42a-b). However, one anomalous use of kang- '1A20' was produced in a '1A30' context (41b); this form does belong to the paradigm as '1A301, and an

explanation for this fact awaits further research. This inflection does not occur with 3A/3S, the analogous function being served by the Set I suffix -i 'Permissive' (cf. section

Two examples of a hortative occur in the texts, both in the same example with intransitive verbs, with the suffix -nno '1+2Sf followed by the suffix -bai 'Hortative' (homophonous with the subordinate form -bai 'Desiderative'). In future research,

possible connections between the desiderative and the hortative, and between the mediated imperative and the hortative, must be investigated.

The vetative is formed by the same suffix, -i, that marks recent past, permissive,

and past questions. The 1 0 prefix with the vetative is identical to the Set I 3A10 prefix,

(u)y-, which makes the inflected verbs in (46) formally ambiguous between their actual

reading, 'Don't curse me' and the other three possible readings: 'She cursed me', 'Did s h e

curse me?', and 'Let himlher curse me.' The 3 0 prefix with the vetative is kl'z- '30.Vet1

(47), and with intransitive verbs the vetative prefix is k- '2S.Vet1(48a-d).

A mediated vetative form occurs in one example, with a prefix kiz- 'Vet.2' and a

There are several lexicalized forms that have an imperative meaning built into

them. Those attested in the texts are ab'i and a b h e 'wait!' (5 la) and miyaro / nyaro 'go!'

(51b) in Abamang Akawaio. As indicated in example 5la, the Pemong and Kwating

Akawaio speakers say masa 'wait!' instead of abine. It can also be seen throughout the

texts that ab'i and ab'ine are used for more than just a request for more time, as they

appear in many sentences apparently just to catch the hearer's attention (for illustration,

look through the preceding examples, from 33 to 48).

3.3.6 Subordinate Clause Morphosyntax This section discusses verbal morphology that creates subordinate clauses other
than nominalizations. Three of these inflections create dependent purpose clauses, two create dependent 'while' clauses, and one creates a participial clause. In each of these three functional domains, at least one of the inflections creates a clause that is understood to have the same subject as the main clause; in both the purpose and the while functions, one inflection creates a clause that can have a different subject from the main clause.

3.3.6.1 Purpose Clauses The three purpose clause inflections are -ik 'Supine', -ze'na 'Purpose', and -do'pe
'purpose'. Following Meira 1999, the term 'Supine' is used instead of 'Purpose of Motion'. The supine is fairly rare, a fading reflex of Proto-Carib *-ce 'Purpose of Motion', pretty much found only on vowel-final verb stems; -ze'na has replaced it following most consonant-final verb stems, and even following some vowel-final stems. Both -ik and -ze'na are only found as adverbial clauses dependent on verbs of motion, in which the S of the verb of motion is understood to be coreferential with the S/A of the purpose verb. The intransitive purpose verb bears no prefix or the invariant a- 'Gen', as

seen in 52. All five text examples of -ik occur on transitive verbs (53a-e), either with a

third person prefix (53a-b) or with a preverbal 0 NP (53c-e). Surprisingly, in one case

(53b), the main verb is a transitive verb of motion, aro 'carry, take'; in this sole case, the

A of the main verb is coreferential with the A of the supine verb.

The second purpose inflection, -ze'na 'Purp7, is virtually identical to -ik in all

regards, except that it occurs more frequently in the texts, and it is considered the

standard form in the speech of the researcher. The sole text example of -ze'na with an

intransitive verb comes in 54, where the purpose verb, agarangse'na 'in order to cry'

bears the general prefix a- 'Gen', and the S of the main verb, amrannozak 'we have

gathered7,is coreferential with the S of the purpose verb. In the transitive purpose verb,

the S of the main clause is coreferential with the A of the purpose verb, and the 0 is

indicated by personal prefix (55a-b) or by the 0 NP in front of the purpose verb (55c-d).

The third purpose inflection, -do'pe 'Purp', is also a main clause future inflection (see

Section 3.3.3). In its purpose function, it is dependent on a main clause that does not

involve motion, and it is used regardless of the coreference conditions between the main

and purpose clauses (same-subject relations are illustrated in 56, completely different

participants illustrated in 57). Just like main clause verbs, purpose verbs with -do'pe

take absolutive prefixes (56b-c, 57a-b) or preverbal absolutive NPs (56a); transitive verbs

take ergative enclitics (56a, c) or free ergative arguments (57b).

3.3.6.2 'While' Clauses

The two types of 'whiley inflections in Akawaio are both formed with suffixes.

Like for purpose clauses, one suffix, -i'ma 'While', requires that the subject of the main

clause and the subject of the 'whileyclause be coreferential, while the other suffix, -dune

'Whiley has no coreference restrictions. The verb with -dune bears the full set of

absolutive prefixes, whereas the verb with -i'ma bears only the accusative half of the

prefixes, taking the invariant a- 'Gen' prefix on consonant-initial verbs and no prefix on

vowel-initial verbs (58).

Clauses with -i'ma 'Whiley often translate best as present participles in English,

which reflect the strict same-subject coreference requirements they have with their main

clauses. The temporal relation between the -i'ma 'While'clause and the main clause is

that the -iYmaclause represents a more durative state during which the more punctual

event represented by the main clause occurs (59-60). In one case (61), the relation is less

temporal and more logical, with the i'ma clause expressing a situation that would lead the

listener to expect a different sentiment than that expressed in the main clause. Although

the texts provide a relatively small sample of the possible contexts where -i7mamight be

used, it is notable that 16 of the 21 text instances of -i7maoccur inflecting the copula.

The -dane 'While' inflection can occur with any type of main clause verb? and

with any combination of coreference conditions. Just like Full Set I1 main clause

inflections, the verb in the -dune 'while' clause either is preceded by the absolutive NP or

bears the absolutive prefix (62a-c)?and in most cases, either the ergative NP occurs or the

verb bears the ergative enclitic (63). Auxiliaries can also bear -dune, both the copular

auxiliary for the progressive (64a) and the verb of speech that lets the sound symbolic

word act as a predicate (64b). The semantic relation between the main clause and the

while clause are mostly that the while clause represents some more durative state or

process during which a more punctual event?represented by the main clause?occurs (62-

64). In one case in the texts? this relation is reversed, with the main clause representing

the durative event and the while clause the punctual event (65).

In several cases with -dune 'Whiley,the relation between the while clause and the

main clause is not temporal, but logical, translating better as something like 'although', or

'even though'. In this usage, the while clause represents something that must be

overcome in order for the main clause to be true, or that would lead you to expect a

different result than the one represented in the main clause (66a-b). It must be this

meaning of the 'while' inflection, combined with the copula eji, that is the source of the

conjunction e'tane 'but?however' (67a-c).

132 In the Full Set I1 Paradigms? the ergative enclitic always follows the tense-aspect inflection. This is also generally true of the subordinate constructions and nominalizations that allow ergative arguments. However, in the possibly more archaic language of the Praising Rhymes, there is one example of -dane following the simple verb with its ergative enclitic (68).

3.3.6.3 Participle Clauses The participle in Akawaio is different fi-om the cognate construction in other
Cariban languages. As described in Gildea (1998?ch. 81, the *t-V-ce participle across the Cariban family is like a passive participle, with completive semantics? always serving to modify the absolutive argument of the verb in the participial inflection. In Akawaio? the participle construction translates into an English present participle? depending on the main clause for tense-aspect and maintaining continuity of the main clause subject. The Akawaio participle presents two allomorphs, -se following a root that ends in a consonant? and -ik following a root that ends in a vowel (the huge majority of cases). The t- prefix is given the separate gloss 'Adv' because it also occurs with other suffixes to derive adverbs from nouns.
The basic use of the participle is illustrated in 69-71. When both the main verb and the subordinate verb are transitive, the A and 0 of the participle are generally coreferential with the A and O7respectively, of the main clause (69a-e). When both the main verb and the participle are intransitive, both S arguments are coreferential (7Oa-b).

When the main clause is intransitive and the participle is transitive, the main clause S is

coreferential with the participle A (71). Note that there is a different main clause tense in

all 8 examples, and in each case the temporal value of the participle follows that of the

main clause: future (69a), habitual (69b), perfect (69c), deontic mood (69e), present

(70a), past habitual (70b), and conditional (71).

In some cases, both the temporal reference and the identity of the 'subject' of the

participle do not match the consistent examples above. Two speakers, both speaking

passionately about a counterfactual situation, used participles for something like hedges

on the content reported in the main clause (72a-c). The coreference conditions are

standard in 72a, with the S of eji 'I am' coreferential with the S of tugaik 'saying', but

the meaning is not the expected 'I am (while) saying' but rather a more subjective 'I

thought.' In 72b the subject of the mail verb yejibok 'it is repeatedly' must be

pleonastic, which means it cannot be coreferential with the S of tugaik 'saying', and in

72c it is clearly not the S of any iteration of gio'mami'be 'she would live' that is the S of

tegamaik 'thinking', but rather it is the speaker or some indefinite other who is thinking

everything that is in the rest of the sentence.

In addition to the general usage of the participle, there are two particular verb

roots whose participle inflections show signs of lexicalizing into specific, unpredictable

meanings: tugaik 'saying' and ti'tuik 'knowing'. Out of all the cases of the participle

recorded in the texts in Appendix B, 47 were cases of tugaik, 17 of ti'tuik, and all the

cases with other verbs put together made only 11. Out of context, the first translation that

a native speaker might offer for tugaik would be something like 'like, in what way', but

in the texts it can be found acting like a quotative marker (73a-b), apparently reinforcing

the idea of 'how' for a complement clause (73~)'and combining (in a very lexicalized

way) with the question word o'ro 'what' to form a way of saying 'how?' (73d-e, similar

to the more common o'ro gaza 'how?' or nai gaza 'how', 73c). All 11 cases of ti'tuik

'knowing' in the texts were immediately followed by bra 'Neg'. In only one case (74a)

did the combination give the expected meaning of 'not knowing', in all other cases

meaning either 'unselected' (74b), 'numerous' (74c) or 'of various kinds' (74d).

Chapter 4. Genre and Classification in Akawaio 4.1 Introduction
The purpose of this chapter is to briefly explain the main aspects of Akawaio spiritual cosmology as embodied in the body metaphor, which gives meaning and symbolic power to speaking. In addition, there is a description of the rules and ideas about general verbal behaviour in Akawaio culture, to establish their organisation and classification into categories, of speech events, or genres. An important part of this exercise is to test whether these events are also presented and performed as units consistent with the Akawaio cosmology, which argues that all aspects of Akawaio life must be evaluated as unified entities just like the cosmic universe and the human body. The ultimate goal of this chapter is to show that there is an Akawaio philosophy of language, one that has never been recognised because it has never been clearly defined and articulated by the Akawaio themselves.
A necessary task that follows is to define genre in non-Akawaio terms and to establish its usefulness in this study. This extends itself into outlining the main substance of traditional Western parameters of classification of vocabulary, paving the way for developing an Akawaio model for speech classification. This is to establish where the four Akawaio speech genres under study, the tareng 'ritual healing chant', mire aburobodi 'praising rhymes for children', zegareme'no 'personal narratives', and pandong 'story7 are identified within these parameters. In particular, this study is interested to explore how Akawaios classify narratives and other genres according to their performances and to understand why particular speech events recur. Finally, the discussion ends by a full description and analysis of each of these genres.

139 4.1.1 Speaking in Akawaio
Speaking is highly valued in Akawaio culture and it is a primary source of personal prestige. This is particularly so because this prestige begins within spirituality, which is more extensively discussed in Section 2.4. To reiterate briefly, spirituality is based on defining who is a ka'pong 'person', and each person's relation to the cosmic spiritual universe. The definition of ka'pong 'person' is conceived of by the Akawaio in terms of the mind-body-soul unity, where physical human beings exist also as cosmic beings in relation to the sky-earth opposition, experiencing different realms of reality. This is the first important reason why the Akawaios call themselves ka'ponggong 'the peopley or 'people from the sky', defining themselves as human beings par excellence. This is the prestige that each speaker holds dear to their heart. Within this context, speaking is an extension of a person. So when someone gets up to say something, what is said must come out from this powerful spiritual being that represents the cosmos; what each person says must be powerful and prestigious.
On the other hand, speech is also said to be pre-existing to be acquired upon birth, when the human baby breathes the air of communication. In the Akawaio worldview, the ka'pong 'person' is analogous to the vertical pillar that bears the divisions of the cosmic world. Like this pillar, it is proposed that a person's body is divided into three separate cosmic divisions: the head and chest, the abdomen, and the lower extremities. It is in the head, in the brain of the child, that the force for activating speech is stored. The head is also the location for the embodiment of intelligence, reason and the accumulation of experience. This part of the body reflects and is equal to the celestial or upper world in the division of the cosmos (believed to be the homelands of the Akawaio ancestors).

140 Maing 'speech' then is categorised among those attributes of a person that control his sanity and intelligence. However, it is not only an attribute, but an entity unto itself, because it was acquired by special means after birth. It is manifested in different ways, but as a concept it has a special meaning, which cannot be applied to its particular form, maimu, to mean the same thing (more on maimu later).
Since maing 'speech' is seen in this way in Akawaio spiritual thought, the performance of speech is seen as a very important act for the Akawaio. The status of speech is essentially highly spiritual, and speech is an entity unto itself. This is also why Akawaios believe that a person should not talk too much unnecessarily and must not say anything bad about someone even in a joking fashion; words have real power. For instance, young menstruating women are forbidden to talk, laugh or cry aloud when in pubertal isolation. If they speak, any elderly woman or man who passes by and hears them can literally die from shock. By the same token, a person can be made ill simply from a curse or direct insults and mockery. Talking bad is only for enemies and persons who have threatened one's personal pride and integrity. Evil spirits are also driven away from areas by making swearing speeches towards the directions where they are believed to be, while pointing with a fire stick. Curing chants and other direct speeches uttered into the air or towards the direction of high winds and rains can serve to calm natural elements that might threaten people's lives.
This way of thinking about speaking in Akawaio culture is reminiscent of the Chamulas of Mexico, who explain their speech in spiritual terms (Gossen 1974.389). For the Chamula, heat possesses great religious significance because its primary referent is the sun deity htotik' k'ak'al 'our father sun'. He is the one who created and maintains

141 temporal, spatial and social categories of the Chamula cosmos. Controlled heat syrnbolises order in both a diachronic and synchronic sense, and language represents one of several symbolic domains which the Chamulas think and talk about in terms of the heat metaphor. Generally, all other aspects of Chamula culture are measured or evaluated in units which are all ultimately from 'Our Father Sun' the giver of order. Because of this, Chamula verbal styles and performances are seen as patterns which extend in homologous fashion into the whole fabric of their social life and expressive behaviour and so they behave as a unitary normative code.
In another way, the Akawaio view speaking in terms similar to those of the Ilongot tribe in the Philippines (Rosaldo 1982.210). For the Ilongot, words are not just merely made up to represent objective truth, because all truth is relative to the relationships and experiences of those who claim to know it. This means that meaning is not developed from what individuals intend to say, but it comes from the relationship of individuals, from within the society as a whole rather than from just the intentions of one person.
This is very unlike how western societies view speaking, where the general argument is that the sincerity conditions of a speech act must prevail in individual speaker's beliefs in the truth of their assertions, certainty of their promises, necessity of their commands (Bonvillain 2000.94). This is a prominent element in the study of western theoreticians on speech acts, and is evident in the works of John Austin, who proposed a typology that classify speech acts in terms of their purpose and effect (Austin 1962.94-101). John Searle (1976.10-13) went to great lengths to define and classify speech acts types, and Lakoff and Johnson (1980.64) argued that speech acts are designed

142 to result in an action by the hearer, and therefore they should be based on the respect for the rights of others, general sincerity, facility and conditions -- in other words, speech acts should be reasonable.
While this is all clear, and represents rational scientific thought, this is not what is important to every society. In societies like those of the Ilongots, Akawaio, and many other Amerindian societies, rules governing ways of speaking do not give first importance to such abstract definitions, classifications and considerations of truth and sincerity. Rather, in the case of the Ilongots, first importance follows from the very life that is led, and for the Akawaio, from the spiritual philosophy of life and speech. In both traditions, speech acts are considered based on the social bonds and interactive meanings that keep the society together as a collective group. Because of this way of thinking, both cultures assert that verbal actions should be divided into those categories of speech which correspond to social situations where norms of 'sameness' and autonomy prevail and those belonging to relationships defined by continuity and hierarchy in the sense of Rosaldo (1982: 222 cited in Bonvillain 2000: 95).
Rosaldo classified Ilongot speech acts into two groups: declaratives and directives. The first is the platform for making assertions and comments through which Ilongot speakers express their beliefs, opinions and feelings, while directives are commands and requests that hearers comply with. In Rosaldo's view, directive speech acts are important for the Ilongots because, within their society, they command the cooperative bonds between the people, because it is the pillar of their social systems.
In another sense, the rules governing speaking privileges in any context in Akawaio society consist of strict rules. Only elderly men and woman have the right to

143 speak first, during any function, as they are said to know all aspects of Akawaio tradition and to have experienced life fully. Akawaio elders are good story-tellers and can tell several stories at one sitting; they are qualified to give advice, settle family and other grievances, cure illnesses and are natural experienced leaders. Some of them are medicine men with ethnobotanical knowledge while others have established their reputation as
tareng 'healing chantyexperts . However, while this is understood, clearly the right to
speak, especially in public, is the domain of men in Akawaio society. This is also true for the Ilongot culture because beliefs about people's rights and obligations to speak are based on gender and age inequalities. Of course, this tends to affect the usage of directives in that men command women and elders command their juniors (Rosaldo 1982).
An Akawaio man is better accepted to talk about himself because of his status, first as a person, as head of a house hold, as a family man and as an accomplished ideal Akawaio man who has a wife or wives, children, several planted farmlands, houses, boats, and fishing and hunting implements. In addition, he should be a good hunter and an accomplished warrior and an expert in all aspects of Akawaio craftsmanship. Measured by all these qualities the Akawaio man is said to have the right and authority to speak as a 'real' person and a 'real' man. During the speech performance, he is said to be representing not just himself, but his entire family and whatever he owns, because he represents them as an extension of himself.
Spiritually, one can see parallels between the Akawaio conception of the person as an image of the unified cosmos (Chapter 2) and the presentation of a person at all levels as a unified entity in all the social settings of Akawaio culture. It is customary to

144 see an Akawaio man stand up in a village meeting or some other formal settings to make a point, but before he makes any contributions or suggestions, he first introduces himself and his family. He takes care to mention his status within his family, what he owns, and what he is engaged in to improve the lot of his family. This is important because he is seen as re-enforcing his established status of being an ideal Akawaio man and identifies himself as a meaningful contributor to his society, a team player who takes his place as the 'real person' he should be. This is what gives him the right to talk in any public forum.
As became evident during the investigator's visit to the field, it was very easy to collect data on personal narratives from men and harder to have women talk on behalf of themselves or their families. Thus, no matter what kind of data were being collected (stories, songs or procedural narratives), the men give this information after talking first about themselves. However, while there is great latitude for speaking by the men, they always take care that they do not say anything that will jeopardize the credibility of themselves, their families and communities, as this could undermine the authority with which they speak.
This emphasis on males being given the right to speak in Akawaio society is attributed to the strict social roles of men and women. Males are the initiators for making society possible, as the ones who protect what is considered important to the survival of the tribe and the family, as the socialisers of future males within Akawaio society, and the ones identified to hunt and fish, prepare cassava fields and to be leaders and warriors. For this reason, if a man is seen as stepping out of the bounds of this role, he is ridiculed

145 and embarrassed by his peers and the society at large. For instance, if an Akawaio man is caught cooking or processing cassava, he is mocked and made fun of even today.
Women, on the other hand, are seen as cultural bearers and procreators and in this way they are responsible for population growth, making society possible. In addition, they plant and tend the cassava (manioc) farms, process the cassava roots to feed their families and bartering or selling the excess with other interested Amerindian and nonAmerindian customers. In this way, they continuously stabilise their economies.
Women speak to their children and among themselves, and also with other women outside of those they interact with on a regular basis. One of the reasons they do not speak much otherwise is because they might attract unnecessary attention upon themselves. Until recently, Akawaio women lived under the shadows of their men folk and were thought to be invisible; they are socialised to be shy and not bold, since boldness attracts unwanted attention from other males. So they are always expected to be shy and quiet and never boisterous (Fox 2000:26). Most of the hard work falls on the Akawaio women: apart from all the regular chores, such as processing cassava, feeding the family, splitting or gathering firewood, tending to the wants of their husbands and children and time spent socialising the children, they are also expected to keep the fires burning during the night in order to provide light, keep the huts warm and keep the mosquitoes and other bugs away. Burdened in this way, there is very little leisure time for Akawaio women to simply talk or idle their time away. One European writer, Everard Im Thurn (1883), observed this practice in the 1800s, when he said that even after working so hard during the day, the women were not left alone to sleep in peace during the nights because they had to keep the fires burning while the men, having slept during the day,

146 told stories to one another in loud tones accompanied by loud laughter. Although it is quite okay for the men folk, only wild, idle, lawless and promiscuous women would engage in such raucous and highly forbidden behaviour. However, this is changing today, as the women themselves seem to be more interested in education and are becoming leaders within their communities, breaking their silence to speak.
4.1.2. Akawaio Definitions of Speech Akawaios speak in many ways, and so they define speech itself in different ways.
A subset of these are dealt with in this discussion in order to establish a point of reference for this study. An Akawaio definition of speaking could be traced through the many ways speaking is defined. This begins with zauro'nodok 'the act of speaking', where words are uttered, whether loudly or quietly (see Figure 4.1. for a classification of various types of speaking); through zenuminggang 'thinking', either silently or aloud, and through ereng 'song.'
The song category covers a wide range, including t'imaimugenang erengdong 'songs with words and melody', imaimub'ing erengdong 'songs with melody but no words', which are performed en masse by participants in a sacred ceremony or a social gathering, a 'kwa eremui 'sacred songs' with or without words, piyai'chang eremui 'sacred songs only learned and sung by shamans and spiritual leaders', and areruyah maimu eremui 'allelujah spiritual songs' (see Figure 4.1). Also classified within this category is warewadang 'ritual chanting', which has two subtypes. The first is either high pitch or low pitch, described as singing from the head. It could be compared to a falsetto and is similar to the chants performed by North American Native drummers and

147 rhythmic speech that has melody and timbre. The second is the type used in the tareng 'ritual healing chants' of the Akawaio, which is performed between taking deep breaths and blowing directly onto the sick person, the patient's food, or anything that a sick person owns. Timbre is important in the performance of tareng and could only be described here as emanating from a voice type such as a bass, with deep resonance or a kind of a rich strong contralto voice. This is why it is called warewadang, a concept associated with the wild loud howling of the baboon or the howler monkey, both very familiar to the Akawaios at Waramadong.
Anthony Seeger, in his study on the Suya of Brazil, commented that there was no way to describe timbre in western music and ethnomusicology, but pointed out that it was a very important part of Suya singing. They referred to singers as having either 'good throats' when a song was rendered loudly and well and 'big throats' when they sang with a full rich sound at a relatively low pitch (Seeger 1986:67). This is familiar to the Akawaios, who would describe a singer or a chanter with a loud, rich voice as ege diezeng 'big throat' or 'one with a big throat' and wagi diezeng 'one with good throat'. One important point to be made about tareng, however, is that it is performed only in the presence of the performer and a sick patient and is often performed very quietly. The only time it is performed loudly is during the coaching and teaching of a tareng apprentice (explained in greater detail in Sec. 4.3)' to ensure the correct use of timbre in the silent performance of the tareng.
Finally, there is wojidang ' high pitch wailing or shouting' particularly associated with tebogoimasang 'death mourners', oi'mane 'evil spirit of the dead', and sobai 'evil person'. This type is performed with words or without words. It is called ori 'evil'

148 because it is associated with the sobai, voodoo-like people who are known to portray general symptoms of madness, such as running wildly while weeping, screaming and wailing in an unkempt state with their eyes glazed, red and bulging out of their sockets. These sobai make people sick, and then the term sobai is also used to describe one who suffers from the effects of rituals performed to cure a victim of the sobai. The speech in the screams, shouts and the high-pitched wailing is rife with eerie, incoherent talk and shouting.
It is also called ori 'evil' because it is associated with the death monster oi'mane, who is found shouting, weeping and wailing on top of the grave of the victim of the killer kanaimo. He imitates the wails and shouts of the victim's relatives, including all the words used in the wailing. In a normal situation, a grieving person performs wojidang 'high-pitched wailing or shouting' through the production of high-pitched cries with intermittent speaking that recounts the sadness that a death has brought to the family. If the dead relative is a man, then the wailer recounts his entire life, why his presence will be missed, and regrets about the uncertainty of the future of his children, grandchildren, his farmlands and his boat and so on. A wife would wail about the sadness and loneliness she is left to face without the protection and care of her husband. The words of wojidang 'high pitch wailing or shouting7resemble a kind of a social commentary in song, which is performed to express extreme, soulful sadness.
In an earlier period, wojidang was a part of death restriction rituals observed by the families of a dead relative. During the restrictions, which lasted up to a year, the relatives of the dead were not allowed to socialise normally with other members of society. They were not allowed to eat in communal-oriented festivals and other such

149 occasions, and could only eat meals prepared by their immediate relatives, who were observing the same restrictions. A family observing such a restriction was also not allowed to cook or offer food to anyone because they were considered unclean. If this happened, the person who was offered the food could suffer from severe abdominal pains and diarrhoea. In another instance, if a person known to be suffering from an illness were to eat food cooked by the relatives of the dead undergoing restrictions, that person's illness would get worse, probably leading to death.
In general, the Akawaios believe everything in the environment speaks, so that natural elements, rocks, animals, plants, birds and fishes have their own language. This is why there is so much emphasis on unity and interdependency between humans, plants and animals, resulting in harmonious living. This is why some plants, animals, birds, fishes, rocks and stones are thought to contribute their attributes to cure illnesses through the tareng 'ritual healing chant'. The chants invoke the message a particular exemplar is contributing to cure an illness. For example, wind talk is a style whereby someone can talk to the elements or a specific plant in order to ask for help, grant a request or ask for permission to walk safely through the area where it is. In this way, many other nonhuman things are perceived as anthropomorphic beings capable of speaking.
Reviewing what has been said before, it is easy to see why speaking and the ground rules associated with it are so important to the Akawaios. Speaking is not just an attribute of a person, but an extension of his spiritual self, resulting in a philosophy or body of knowledge, if you will, that governs speaking. With this in mind, the discussion hereafter embodies the various approaches that are explored to explain how Akawaio ways of speaking are organised, categorised and classified.

4.1.3 Genre and its Usefulness in Categorising Speech in Akawaio Debates for the definition of the concept genre have continued to rage since the
time of Boas (see Radin 1926, Propp 1928, Sebeok 1953, 1994, George & Dundes 1963, Scott 1965, Dundes 1965, Hymes 1974, cited in Briggs & Bauman 1992: 131-72). The emergence of the Ethnography of speaking in the 1960s resulted in 'genre' assuming a very significant place in linguistic anthropology (Philips 1987). Consequently, 'genre' as a concept became useful both in defining the organisation of generic classifications from scientific taxonomy and in the ethnographic investigation of locally-constructed classification systems.
Hymes asserted that 'genres' are categories of speech, such as poems, myths, tales, proverbs, riddles, curses, prayers, orations, lectures, forms, and letters. The analysis of these speech forms as speech acts resulted in classifying them into distinct genres. It follows then, that the notion of genre implies that speech has formal characteristics which must be identified because they are linked to particular genres (Hymes 1974:61). This implies that 'speech acts' define speaking as a form of social action while 'genre' directs attention to routinised, conventionalised organisation of formal structures of language beyond the sentence (Hymes 1972b.48). In a general sense, Hymes is also saying that a speech event is different from a speech genre. Bauman and Sherzer (1974.141) argued that this is not an analytical distinction, because local conceptions for the organisation of domains of speaking could be defined both in terms of categorical systems of speech acts and genres. Swales gives a more precise definition of genre, as follows:
'A genre comprises a class of communicative events, the members of which share some set of communicative purposes. These

purposes are recognised by the expert members of the parent discourse community, and thereby constitute the rationale for genre. This rationale shapes the schematic structure of the discourse and influences and constrains choice of event and style. Communicative purpose is both a privileged criterion and one that operates to keep the scope of a genre as here conceived narrowly focused on comparable rhetorical action. In addition to purpose, exemplars of a genre exhibit various patterns of similarity in terms of structure, style, content and intended audience. If all high probability expectations are realised, the exemplar will be viewed as prototypical by the parent discourse community. The genre names inherited and produced by discourse communities and imported by others constitutes valuable ethnographic communication, but typically need further validation (Swales 1990.58, cited in Ruedas 2002: 457).
This definition unifies concepts from folklore, literary studies, linguistics and
rhetoric, explicitly revealing the three important elements that are required for a recurring
form of communication which can define a genre. Ruedas (2002.457) pinpoints these
elements: (1) a communicative purpose; (2) a pattern of similarity in structure, style,
content and intended audience; and (3) a genre name inherited and produced by the
discourse community. These elements represent an explicit way of defining genre, and
depart from Hyrnes in a very different way. For instance, Hymes' reasoning defines a
church service as an event and a sermon as genre, and in this way he separates them into
different domains and views them as two separate things. Swales thinks of speech event
and genre as both being communicative events, in that members within the category of
speech events tend to share some set of communicative purposes, and to be seen as
genres by the parent communities.
Whatever rationale led to the creation of the genres also defines the structure of
the discourse, and influences and constrains choice of event and style. Because each
exemplar exhibits various patterns of similarity in terms of structure, style, content and

152 intended audience, it is often seen as being prototypical by the parent discourse community. Consequently, the genre is given a name, is established inside the community, and may also be known by others outside the community. For all the reasons Swales has presented, it is no longer appropriate to utilize Hymes' early scientific parameters for the definition of a genre. Thus while 'genre' in a general Hymesian sense is useful as the primary tool for organising and placing the Akawaio speech forms into perspective, it is limited because of Hymes' strict division between genre and speech event, especially without giving consideration to the origins of such events within local speech classifications.
Ruedas (2002) expresses this position well: 'Genre is a type of event and therefore it is not just the words that are spoken, but also the arrangement of participants and their physical environment.' Ruedas pinpoints that his position is closer to SavilleTroike (1982), who argued that genre is a type of communicative event and that the distinction made by Hymes between event type and genre is misleading. This is because for Saville-Troike 'any genre can become an event type if one shifts the axis of comparison' (Saville-Troike in Ruedas 2002.458). Deducting from Saville-Troike's and Swales' argument, Ruedas points out that the notions of speech event type and genre are equivalent or the same. Because while it is true that a speech event, such as Hymes' church service or healing ritual, can consist of various sub genres having formal features such as hymn, prayer and sermon, the whole event is an example of a dialogic and multivocal discourse genre. In addition, the distinct structures of hymn, prayer and sermon are constituents of a broader discourse structure that encompasses them all (Ruedas 2002: 458).

153 In another sense 'genre' in this study also points out the inadequacy of earlier definitions for 'genre'. This is the component that led to the failure of genre becoming an overriding concept in the study of local classification of speech. Briggs and Bauman (1992.139) perceive of the inadequacy being based on the question of what portion of the speech economy, within a speech community, is generically organised and which areas escape regimentation. These questions were never addressed in the early attempts to define 'genre'. Gary Gossen and Brian Stress recognise this in their studies on the speech genres of the Chamula people of Highland Chiapas (Gossen 1972, 1974). They point out that the speech genres of the Chamula are locally constituted and systematically interrelated. This is in clear contrast to the scholarly tradition, which relied on the a priori, universalistic, Westem-based analytical genres, atomistically defined and ethically applied (Ben Amos 1976 [I9691 in Briggs and Bauman 1992.138). Thus, Gossen concluded that while some Chamula genres could be equated with Western genres, they are different in the way they are categorised and organized (Briggs & Bauman 1992: 139). In discriminating the Chamula system of generic categories, Gossen applied the structural-semantic techniques of ethnoscience to encourage the exploration of Chamula lexicalised category systems. This was to discover the comprehensive taxonomic organisation of the Chamula domain of Sk'op 'people speech' from everyday speech to the most highly forrnalised and densely meaningful genres (Briggs and Bauman 1992: 139). Gossen observed that speaking was a cultural focus in Chamula culture, and because of this the cultural organisation of the generic taxonomy is complex. It is also all

154 encompassing and interrelated at all levels, regardless of if they are formallinformal, functional, situational, social organisation, ethical and cosmological (ibid).
This observation resonated in later discussions and studies on 'genre' in the ethnography of speaking and posed two important questions: (1) To what extent are generic structures reducible in cultures? and (2) can they be combined in many other ways? Greg Urban's (1984) study on the semiotic of two speech styles in Shokleng was based on answering such questions. The two Shokleng speech styles exemplified the generic styles: origin-myth narration and ritual wailing. Extending the principle of cooccurrence, he revealed that Shokleng speech styles were inherently indexical, because their use co-occurred with some entity or subject matter (Urban 1984.313). Urban exemplified this by offering a close semiotic analysis of origin-myth narration and ritual wailing that pinpointed the interrelationship that linked the two genres together to other ways of speaking. This allowed Urban to explore the broad communicative range of Shokleng generic speech styles (Briggs & Bauman 1992:141).
Presently, the merger of genres and speech events, and the transference from their primary situational contexts of use to other speech events, predominates. This is evident in the work of Joel Sherzer, who traced the various contexts in which the i'karkana curing texts feature in San Bias Kuna culture within a range of events. Thus, its functions at different times are identified within a wide range of events. While its primary use is for magical curing, disease prevention, improving abilities and general control of the spiritual world, it also serves as the basis for ikar rehearsals by the specialists, the learning and teaching of the ikar, to the chanting of the ikar for entertainment on festive

155 occasions. Each of these performances is marked by formal and functional differences (Briggs & Bauman 1992: 3 13).
Similarly, Allessandro Duranti explored the formally and functionally contrastive uses of the Samoan genre of oratory, lauga, in ceremonial events and in a type of political meeting, fono. The studies of both Sherzer and Duranti established that the generic specification and boundaries of ikar and lauga cannot be determined by text alone, but resides in the interaction between the organisation of the discourse and the organisation of the event in which it is performed. These two studies also raised another important point: for Duranti the most salient difference between lauga infono and lauga in other ceremonial events was 'performance'. Therefore he argued that lauga was the socially recognised domain of performance par excellence (Duranti 1984:235). This was because it displayed verbal virtuosity while the lauga infono was delivered in a different way, in a more instrumentally oriented mode. Sherzer arrived at a parallel conclusion in his study of the Kuna, because, during festive occasions, ikar is defined as virtuosic performance, in practicing as rehearsal, and in teaching as demonstrative. This clearly shows the variability of relations between genres to performance and other frames. (Briggs & Bauman 1992:144).
The three studies by Urban, Sherzer, and Duranti reflected a useful turn in redefining the limited use of genre. Thus, instead of restricting the concept of genre to mutually exclusive generic categories, their studies extended its use to conclude that, at least in the Shokleng, Kuna and Samoan societies, generic categories can overlap and interpenetrate in many ways in all aspects of verbal production. It follows that aspects of verbal production in some non-western societies are resistant to orderly categorisation.

156 Given this realization within the discipline of ethnography of speaking, modem ethnographers are very cautious when they investigate locally constructed classification systems.
To conclude, this study utilises the notion of genre as influenced by the works of John Swales, Charles Briggs and Richard Bauman, Javier Ruedas, Joel Sherzer and Greg Urban, Muriel Saville-Troike and Richard Baurnan and Joel Sherzer. The concept of genre, though not a part of the Akawaio vocabulary, resonates in this study in the following ways: first, as suggested by John Swales, genre has specific elements to rationalize its existence. Second, in the sense of Saville-Troike, Javier Ruedas and Swales, genre and speech events are perceived as one and the same. Third, in the tradition of Charles Briggs, Richard Bauman, Joel Sherzer, Greg Urban, Gary Gossen and Allessandro Duranti, genre is perceived as exceeding its classical definitions in three important ways: (i) genres and speech events, when analysed, sometimes transfer from their primary situational contexts of use to other speech events; (ii) genre should be studied by establishing its specifications and boundaries, not by text alone, but in the interaction between the organisation of discourse and the organisation of speech events; and finally (iii) genre should be a concept that investigates generic categories to pinpoint how they overlap and interpenetrate in multiple ways of verbal production in non-westem societies.
This is in recognition of aspects of verbal production in such societies that are resistant to orderly categorization. More importantly the use of genre in this study goes beyond being just the tool for classification and organisation of speech. This chapter analyses: (a) the interaction between how speaking in Akawaio is organised and how the

157 event within which it is performed is organized. This is explored by paying attention the ways and degrees in which the Akawaio speech forms are grounded, examining what they might be detached from within the Akawaio cultural context. (b) How is the Akawaio performance of the speech genre socially defined and how is this important to defining it as a speech genre? And (c) what are the points of merger between the Akawaio speech genres and Akawaio speech events, and their transference from one primary situational context of use to other speech events, and to the broader domains of speaking in Akawaio?
This new focus on genre with its extended use embodies an alternative view set forth by Briggs and Bauman and it places speech genres in the ethnographic study of locally constructed classification systems rather than in a priori analytic categories. This is the underlying reason for scrutinizing the formal characteristics of Akawaio concept maing 'speech' (see discussion in Sec. 4.1.2) as the foundations of narrative discourse in Akawaio. In the first place, this reflects an attempt to assess the semiotic functions that influence the development of formal models of Akawaio speech and classification systems. The goal is to uncover the broader social/spiritual contexts and the semantic meanings that precedes these systems. The use of genre adopted here is crucial for identifying a point of reference within which the social and spiritual purposes of Akawaio speech acts and events must begin. This study deviates from studies which perceive of the broader social world and what is referred to as a non-linguistic world, because it does not only perceive of both the social and the non-linguistic world, but articulates Akawaio speech genres within Akawaio spirituality, within the non-linguistic world itself. The attempt in this study is to focus on four Akawaio speech genres which embody the

158 spiritual and cultural continuity of the Akawaios and represent how these genres are in fact models of spiritual and cultural continuity. Therefore? it seeks to uncover the continuity inherent in the semantic meanings of the genre texts themselves, to observe how these meanings reflect the broader views of cultural and spiritual continuity in Akawaio society.
Akawaio categories of speech and their use have never been studied before. Consequently, there is no existing literature anywhere on this topic upon which the present work could be based. The analysis of Akawaio ways of speaking that is being presented here is new information, and the main objective is the attempt to discuss Akawaio speech genres within a structured model of speech classifications. This is only available presently because it emerges from the investigator's own knowledge about the subject and comes out of her own experiences as a native Akawaio and speaker. Since Akawaio is not a written language, it has no literary tradition in which one might seek out a record of all aspects of their way of life, much less a record of how they categorise their ways of speaking. For both these reasons this study cannot pretend to be conclusiveybut represents work in progress. This study prepares the way for any future study on the subject and partially fills the continuing gap that exists in Amerindian studies and within the ethnography of speaking and sociolinguistics in the study of Amerindian 'ways of speaking', particularly in the Guianas.
4.1.4 Classifying Akawaio Ways of Speaking Conceptualisation of a structured classification for the Akawaio speech genres is
influenced by the works of many proponents of taxonomic systems in vocabulary: Berlin

159 and Kay (19691, Sherzer and Urban (19861, Kay (1965), Bloomfield (19461, Bonvillain (1989, 1990, 2000), Fillmore (19821, Kaa (19761, Labov (19731, Lakoff and Johnson (1980), Sapir (1912), Whorf (19561, Bauman and Sherzer (1974) and Atran (1999). These scholars have focused on how cultural speech classifications could be investigated crossculturally. The answer to this question was in the approach which most studies on speech classification in vocabularies have taken. First, there were the questions raised about the possibility of universality of linguistic and cognitive processes (Berlin & Kay 1969, Bloomfield 1964, Bonvillain 2000, Hallowell 1960, Hoijer 1951, Kay & Daniel 1978, Labov 1973, Lakoff 1972, Lakoff & Johnson 1980, MacLaury 1989, Mathiot 1962, Sapir 1949, Whorf 1956). In addition, the goal of these studies has been to describe how cultural values and symbols were encoded in words and expressions used by speakers to transmit emotional, attitudinal, and symbolic meanings (Bonvillain 2000.53). This leads to the main point of departure being the study of categories and taxonomies in vocabulary which focus on the analysis of 'semantic domains' or basic categories. Bonvillain defines semantic domains as "an aggregate of words, all sharing a core meaning, related to a specific topic, such as kinship terms, body part words and colours." In addition, semantic domains were united by similarities and contrast. Consequently, words within a domain are said to share certain features of meaning because they refer to the same type of object, person or event; but then, each word is unique in the sense that each one tends to contrast with all others in the set and labels a distinctive entity. These basic features and characteristics of semantic domains, when analysed, lead to the discovery of the semantic principles of similarity and contrast within a given domain. These in turn give way to

160 predictions and inferences about how speakers within a particular culture experience their world. (Bonvillain 2000:53).
Another useful concept enshrined in the systems for classif~ngvocabularies are 'focal meaning7and 'prototypes7,which have become relevant to ethno-linguistic studies. "The focal meaning of a word is its central sense within the whole range of meanings that it has.?' Thus, a word's focal meaning is the best example, or the most typical example of the possible meanings that it encompasses (Bonvillain 2000:62). For example, in colour terminology each word covers a graded range of different hues along a continuum. Therefore it does not have a discrete and absolute quality?but each word has some central meaning?a 'best example7(Berlin and Kay 1969).
Prototypes in another sense are useful for deciding on other categories of the basic speech domains and subcategories. Thus, a prototype is an idealized, intemalised conceptualisation of an object? quality or activity. Real life objects and activities are measured against these internalised concepts and are named according to how well they approximate the ideal (Bonvillain 2000:62).
Charles Fillmore (1982.32) argues that "a prototype approach to semantics seeks to represent the meaning of a linguistic expression, not through a statement of the
necessary and sufficient conditions for membership in a category.. . but rather through the
analysis of instances (or near instances) of the category in terms of approximations to the ~rototype.'~
While the discussion above reflected earlier theoretical approaches to classif~ng speech, it is already clear that there cannot be and single way to classify objects in the world? since classification schemes differ from culture to culture. While universality may

161 not be a lost cause altogether, for the sake of Western science there is need to be careful when considering judgements about universal principles of classification, especially as this relates to Amazonian Amerindians. For instance, this study observes that nowhere in the existing studies (Berlin & Kay 1969? Kay 1975, Hoijer 1951, Bonvillain 2000, Sherzer and Urban 1986) is there any attempt to study classification systems within Amerindian societies based on their spiritualities. This is an important component of Amerindian cultures both in North and South America, and it pervades all aspects of life. With the absence of such a citation?it is often hard to agree that there is universality in ways for classifjing the world across cultures.
In spite of this, there are a few studies that seem to allude to the spiritual ways in which some indigenous communities in South America classify their world, although this is often not clearly articulated. Thus, the work of Kensinger (Kensinger and Reina 1991) in his work on the Wai-Wais talked about colours and their classifications in Wai-Wai spirituality. Thus, the colour 'black' was said to come fiom the west, the black homelands of their spiritual ancestors, and this is why it was important to them. The 'black west' was also the place where the sun sets, giving way to darkness. Wai-Wais? like the Akawaiosyperceive of a spiritual cosmos that is divided into layers (refer to Sec. 2.4). This division resulted during the primordial time due to a number of catastrophic events. This is why the ancestors now live in the darkened west. For the Wai-Wais, there were certain birds that were spiritual because they were blessed by the Sun Father as the medium for colours. Such birds are the macaw, parrots, the toucan and the cock-of-therock (only found in Guyana). This is why feathers of these birds are fundamental components of Wai-Wai cosmology (Kensinger and Reina 1991, Fox 1995).

162 For example, the colour red is explained in Wai-Wai myths and legends as originating fiom spiritual birds who were painted by such agents as blood, fluids fiom the internal organs, and fire a long time ago. Such myths also explain the creation of present day colours in the feathers of birds. For example, the Wai Wai myth about petari 'anaconda' shows that after it was cut in half, the river banks swam with blood. The bird people bathed in the blood, hoping that they would be transformed into real birds. However, after they took the bath, there was a down pour of rain so kworo-yeuna (red and green macaw people) built a house to shelter, It did not hold all the bird people so some lost their red colours. The woodpecker people hurriedly placed some leaves over their heads, consequently these birds now have red heads. This is one example of why groups like the Wai-Wais (including the Akawaios, Bororos, Caribs, Patamunas, Warraus, and Wapishanas) believe that significant colours such as black and red were brought to them by spiritual entities. Thus, some Amerindian groups arguably depart fiom the spiritual way in which they view the origins of colours when they classify colours, rather than attending only to hue, lightness and saturation. In his study on three Suya (Brazil) genres ngere 'song', kaperni 'speech' and iaren 'telling', Seeger (1986) discovered that the classification ngere 'song' had archaic words, song syllables and phonetic alterations that were hard to understand. They were also symbolically dense with opaque meanings. These songs the Suya said were very old and that only the beings who taught these songs to the Suya originally knew what they meant. Some of this beings included spiritual jaguars, extinct enemies who live under the earth, and spiritual bees and birds. In his three dimensional classification of the Suya ways of speech, Seeger described the ngere 'song' category as having priority of melody

163 over text, and as having text and melody entirely fixed by non-human source. This is proof that the Suya perceive of a spirituality that influences the explanations of the characteristics of their songs with their origins (Seeger 1986:64-68). This is why Seeger encountered an objection from the Suya about categorising sangere 'curing chant' as simply song. Sangere cannot be a song for the Suya, considering that they are not performed aloud, their texts are hardly heard at all, and they were not learned from animals, even though attributes of animals and plants are central elements of sangere. These differences therefore led to classifying it as a separate speech form from the ngere 'song. '
Among Native Americans in California songs originate in the spiritual world, and so they perceive of two types of songs: songs with words and songs without words (Hinton 1994:145-151). Many of these are bird songs which are sung by different tribes and have meanings in one language but not in another. The songs that have no words and no meaning are said to exemplify spiritual language which humans no longer know, hence they belong to this genre (ibid). Among the Atsugewis, songs are seen as coming from spirits, so if a spirit liked a person, it sang to him and then the song is sung under appropriate circumstances (Hinton 1994:147). In addition, the names and words of Atsugewi shamanic songs were understood only by the guardian spirits to whom they were addressed (Hinton 1994:148). The important thing about these examples is the idea of an existing spiritual world which (though not clearly articulated) influences how the songs are learnt and classified. For instance, all songs, regardless of whether they have words or not, were considered songs because it is really the song itself that holds meaning, not just the words. This is why songs without words (Atsugewi, Havasupai

164 Wintu, Akawaio) can also be full of meaning, as they were handed down from spiritual ancestors.
In another sense, Western academics have been the only ones to study Amerindian and other systems of classification, and they do this from a purely scientific theoretical stand point. This is the point at which indigenous explanations for aspects of their culture should merge with scientific theory, in order to compare locally constructed categories with western scientific systems. Thereafter, there should be a joint portrayal of these systems as complementing each other (to the extent that they do). In this sense, this kind of approach would at least seem more productive and useful, and could lead to an all-embracing theory of classification systems, which might then truly support the idea of a universal theory of classifications.
This study attempts to utilise such an approach and departs from the tradition of reviewing the Akawaio speech classifications only within traditional scientific theory and as existing in an abstract form. Therefore, the analysis of Akawaio ways of speaking begins in the spiritual realm of the Akawaios (described in detail in Chapter 2). Thereafter it culminates in comparing and contrasting these Akawaio speech classification systems with western scientific theories. The approach to begin to explain Akawaio ways of speaking within spirituality may not be deemed as a method of scientific inquiry. However, within its own socio- cultural category, spirituality is the underpinning of the Akawaio worldview, which pervades all aspects of life. Thus, spirituality precedes the development of Akawaio ways of speaking. It follows that this study does not ignore scientific approaches altogether, but focuses first on what is important in the Akawaio world view is first, and then, within this context, paying

165 attention to how Akawaios define their own speech. The scientific approaches thereafter can offer direction to further analysis of locally constructed classification systems, but only if and whenever this is relevant. It is within this spirit that the classification of Akawaio speech genres in this study is discussed hereafter.

Figure 4.1. Classification of Akawaio Speech Genres
As illustrated in Figure 4.1, the basic category of Akawaio speech forms consists of two main concepts maing 'speech' and maimu 'language' which are both defined differently. Therefore, maing meaning 'speech' (generic) referring to everyday speech

166 forms performed by humans or any type of speech utterance; and (2) maimu meaning 'language7 or 'my language7(particular form) which refers to a specific language spoken by a human group. There is a basic distinction to be made between two main uses of these terms. Thus, maing 'speech' is a more general term for speech and the other maimu 'language7 is more restricted to referring to a specific type of speech performed by a specific group of people. Thus, in one sense maing is the main concept for defining speech as oppose to maimu which connotes the act of speaking during the performance of it. However, this is not always clear in its usage in the Akawaio language by many speakers. Hymes was aware of this vagueness when he said that speech has been used as a variation for language; but language as an act of speech does not mean for many writers a complex social act but a mere manifestation of speech (1974:445). To get away from such vagueness Sherzer and Darnell chose to call it 'speech use7 while Hymes called it 'ways of speaking' because it was analogous with 'ways of life' and the Whorfian concept of 'fashions of speaking'. This was deliberate for Hymes because he wanted to make a point to the anthropologists that ways of mankind included their ways of speaking and to remind the linguists that speaking came in many ways because it showed cultural patterning. Despite this complexity, maing 'speech' and maimu 'language' are individually thought of as being different while they are also viewed as being akin to each other. But there is one difference: rnaing 'speech' can be used to refer to any category of language but maimu 'language7 cannot be used to refer to maing 'speech7.
As an aggregate of words sharing a core meaning relating to speech, the words maing 'speech' and maimu 'language or my language' in Akawaio could be viewed as belonging to the same semantic domain. However, maing is the main lexemic name for

167 'speech' in Akawaio. This seems to be following the model set forth by Brent Berlin (1974.51) where this recognition is seen as an important clue for determining the lexemic status of an utterance. Because maing 'speechyhas this lexemic status, it could be seen as corresponding to the scientific taxonomic rank of order. But then, there are two questions which serve to determine if this is really the case: do the Akawaios perceive of the various usages of maing 'speech' when speaking about it, whereby this variation is designated to single words within this maing 'speech' category for defining the whole range of characteristics of maing 'speech' at different times? Or do the Akawaios view words within the maing category as displaying those characteristics idiosyncratically? The answer to the first question is 'yes' and to the second, 'no'. Yes, because the Akawaios perceive of maing 'speech' as having consistently multiple characteristics, such as in the co-variation and similarity in the morphological and behavioural traits of maing 'speech' and other subcategories of this word. This is why Figure 4.1 shows categories such as maimu 'language' with subcategories that describe how language is defined and classified: 67.6maimu 'serious language' containing its own subtypes and internal classification; arerujah maimu eremui 'hallelujah spiritual songsy,describing the types and classifications of songs in Akawaio repertoire; and ebadagang 'narration', which embodies the various ways of Akawaio speaking in narrative form.
Each one of these has a particular word to describe it, which leads to the idea that there are natural categories within maing 'speech' -- the subcategories of this word all share multiple characteristics and are therefore sublexical categories of maing 'speech'. In addition, the only time different characteristics could be applied in combination is when reference is made to maing 'speechy.This clearly shows that maing 'speechy as a

168 single word cannot be seen as constituting a set and this is why it cannot be analysed as being representative of a taxon or a null set (Kay 1971368).
In the second instance, a second criterion of taxon, which represents a natural category in a taxonomic structure, is the strict inclusion of sets only restricted to members
of T, that is to say that set ti strictly includes another set t, just only if every member of it
is a member of ti and there is at least one member of ti which is not a member oft, (ibid). In the Akawaio experience maing 'speech' could be representative of ti and maimu 'language', which is akin to it, as $. All other defining terms for maimu 'language' could be seen as belonging to set ti maing 'speech', which seems to be the superordinate category. However, the reverse is not possible in that maing 'speech' cannot be placed within the maimu 'language' category. This means that maing 'speech' is an entity unto itself and cannot be described interchangeably as maimu 'language' and its subcategories. Maimu 'language', because it has subcategories, seems to exhibit a formally definable set. This is clear in Figure 4.1, where maimu 'language' is used to express the different ways of speaking and is a productive part of the complex terms that cross-index and cross-reference the different speech types within different subcategories of maimu 'language'.
Regardless, it seems as though the Akawaios perceive of maing 'speech' in two ways: (1) maing 'speech' is the main generic form which could be defined as a superordinate category in scientific taxonomy. By 'generic' it is meant that maing means speech in general without reference to any specific speech and therefore has a special meaning. (2) maimu 'language' is the particular form, which displays a definable taxon because it is the point of reference for its subcategories. However, Akawaios do not

169 always treat maing 'speech' and maimu 'language' as separate words, and in this way their meanings are not always clear-cut and they tend to use these words interchangeably to mean the same thing. Despite this, there is much cross-indexing, cross-categorization and cross-referencing among all these subcategories, in terms of the generic term maing 'speech7 pinpointing that there is a hierarchical distinction between maing 'speech' and maimu 'language7in Akawaio speaking philosophy.
Because of this interplay and interdependency between maing, the generic name for speech, and maimu, the particular form, the entire domain of speech is presented as a collective category rather than as a taxon in the sense of western scientific theory. This is why Akawaio speakers seem to have a freedom of choice in using either the generic or particular forms in the sense of Dorothy Lee (1959:123). The Figure 4.1 reflects this view in that mains, the generic form, is illustrated as encircling the three particular forms of speech, which are in turn represented as encased in boxes, which exist side by side as separate collective categories within the broader superordinate category of maing. This way of categorising, organising and classifying speech and speaking seems to follow naturally from the Akawaio world view as represented in their lexicon. Central to this is the idea that the cosmic universe cannot be divided into individual items because it is a unified category, and all things within it are presented as collective categories but belonging to a larger superordinate category, the cosmic universe.
This conclusion for developing Figure 1.4 came together following an analysis of the components of each subcategory of maimu 'language' to determine if there were considerable contrasts in their definitions, characteristics and use. This was done by first comparing and contrasting their meanings, then their various uses and the contexts within

170 which they were used. This method of comparing and contrasting components of words, used to determine classifications such as the ones in Akawaio speech, is known as 'componential analysis' (Goodenough 1956, 1965), a method used by linguists and anthropologists to pinpoint the isolable components of words that occur in different combinations within a domain. In this way it compares distinct components that are used within the domain, or any system of terms, to allow for the understanding of what Bonvillain calls the ethnosemantics, or the indigenous systems of meaning (Bonvillain 2000: 55).
One important consideration was the Akawaio spiritual tradition of how language is viewed, which also gave clues to its importance and origins (see Chapter 2). Thus, mains 'speechy according to Akawaio spiritual explanations comes from mo awong 'the one within over therey interpreted in a spiritual sense as meaning from around the cosmos. Maing 'speechy is therefore pre-existing, and is acquired by humans at birth when the human infant breathes, making first contact with the air, the medium of communication. The air is the wind that represents light, and its sustenance comes from the spiritual 'Sun Fathery.It is developed into 'real' speech, mains, as the child grows within a relevant environment. One explanation for why speech exists out there is because it is believed that the wind transfers speech to everything in the environment. Hence everything speaks, but the only mediums that verbalise it audibly are humans.
Whether this rationale could be taken seriously as literally true is not the issue here; but as the point of departure for understanding ideas about language within the traditional Akawaio world view, it plays a central role in classifying their speech forms. Maing 'speech' must, therefore, be acknowledged as the main leading concept for

171 speaking in Akawaio society, since it is perceived as a sacred word in itself (as shown in Figure 4.1). Maing as a general concept also fulfils what is known as the 'focal meaning' of a word in linguistic anthropology. Because in a central sense, its focal meaning echoes throughout a whole range of other meanings that it has. In addition, what allows it to have a focal meaning is because maing 'speech' is the best example or the most typical example of all the possible meanings it has from a linguistic standpoint.
When accessed, the other word, maimu 'language' or 'my language', is closely akin to maing 'speech' -- in fact, a historical linguistic analysis of the two forms shows that both are modem reflexes of the same word. The possessed form carried a suffix marking its syntactic status as possessed, and when that suffix disappeared (described for all the Pembng group in Gildea 2000), the full form of the root was preserved as maimu 'language (possessed)'. The unpossessed form had no suffix to protect the end of the word from phonetic erosion, and so the final syllable lost its vowel and the resulting word-final nasal became velar (described for the Pemhng-Panare Macro-Group in Gildea 2000). Thus, the shortened form, maing, represents the more abstract concept because it was never specified as belonging to anybody or any situation, whereas the longer form, maimu, represents the more grounded and defined concept, language that could be possessed, either by an individual or by a situation.
However, it is not enough to look at the historical linguistic analysis if we are trying to do justice to the internal classification as the Akawaio see it. A better tool to get insight into the Akawaio point of view is the folk etymologies that they offer to explain the differences between the two words. In interviews with the elders, it was explained that mai- comes from maing 'speech' while '-mu' means 'son' which is equal to maimu

172 'language', literally meaning 'speech son' or 'the son of speech'. Thus, its meaning is 'an identifiable language spoken by some one or a group of people' in an Akawaio sense. Because it is referred to as the son of 'speech' maing, it is concluded that maing and maimu are often used interchangeably, although they are treated as separate concepts, one being generic and the other being a particular form in Akawaio speech classification.
As shown in Figure 4.1, there are four main Akawaio speech types that are subcategories of maimu 'language': (1) zauro'nodok 'talk' or 'to be able to speak in the sense of a human being'; (2) ozo maing 'serious talk', referring to structured, formal speech performed in organized settings; ( 3 ) areruyah maing eremu 'hallelujah spiritual songs' or, more literally, 'hallelujah speech songs'; and (4) ebadagangdok 'narration'.
Zauro'nodok is the exemplification of speech which enables a language (see the title of this dissertation). The ability to talk is held in high regard in any human society. Among the Akawaio people, a child who cannot talk is known as miaimu b'ing 'one without language' and not one without speech. In fact, there is no way anyone can say maing bfng 'without speech', since this is grammatically wrong and will not make sense. 'Talk' in a general sense is very essential to the Akawaio since children are said to be humans only after they start to talk. In their earlier years, they are considered spirits and not humans. It is for this very reason that young siblings of a baby were not allowed to see or be near their newborn brother or sister for some time. In fact, this is also why there are so many traditions, rites and rituals which must be observed both by a pregnant mother and a new mother and father. This example clearly shows the power of 'talk' in Akawaio culture, and the various ways in which they appreciate its functions. This will also become clear in the upcoming discussions on the categories and subcategories of

173 Akawaio ways of speaking. It follows that 'talk' gains its status of importance simply because it exemplifies speech that has meaning, spiritually and physically, and because it is the basis for communication in the every day life of the Akawaio people.
Subcategories of zauro'nodok 'talk' consist of seven types: (1) egama 'to tell (generally)' also to report an incident, to recite, to read a book, to foretell or predict an event. (2) ebanamang 'to give special advice or give counselling to an individual', perhaps to guide them when they are cheating, drinking too much or breaking the general rules of the society. It comes from the wordpana 'ear' and literally it means 'to give ears to someone'. (3) auro'ka ' to give advice' (in general) to anyone about any problems they might have tangible or abstract. It is a morphologically transitive form of the word zauro'no 'to talk'. ( 4 ) esabemangdok 'to mock', considered very bad speech. This type of talk can lead to fights and strained relationships. (5) pa'n'ik 'curse' the use of which is blamed for illnesses, death or bad luck in Akawaio communities; (6) e'jiranggang 'speak a foreign language', a skill well-known in Amerindians communities, where most people are known to speak several languages apart from their own. But this skill is not valued a lot next to the importance of being able to speak one's own language. Therefore, much cannot be said about this subcategory, except to say that it exists. Notice that these subcategories of maimu 'language' are very different from the main generic term mains 'speech' described before, because they have different functional uses. Nevertheless they are all consistently assessed in terms of it as the superordinate category.
0 z o maimu 'serious talk' refers to structured, formal speech forms which are performed in organised settings. These are of three main types: (1) miiding maimu 'meeting language', evident in village meetings, village election campaigns, wedding

174 ceremonies, oral reports, and speeches given at other important functions by village elders and teachers; (2) paba maimu or diegare 'Great Father's speech', 'God's words' or 'the Gospel', referring to speech only performed in a church when preaching or speech used in hallelujah spiritual gatherings; and (3) a'kwa maimu 'ritual language', which means literally' bright speech' or 'utterance' or 'the language of brightness'. A'kwa maimu consists of three subtypes of ritual speech: (i) tareng 'ritual blowing', which literally means 'words of fire' or 'fire words' (a compound of ta 'to say' and reng 'embers of fire'). Ritual blowing chants are used to cure all types of illnesses and can also be used to harm people. (ii) warewadang 'ritual shouting', 'singing in a ceremony', or 'chanting aloud', to place oneself into a spiritual mode; it can also refer to the loud, incoherent speeches of mad people. In some cases, some of these chants do not have words per se. (iii) tadok maing 'to say speech' also referred to as 'the silent ritual wind speech'. This refers to sayings or phrases that are uttered to the wind for safety, in order to appease spirits during travel in the deep forest or some unknown environment. They are also sayings used for getting out of harm's way, for example when walking through an area full of razor grass, one can repeat a saying or password, which would make it safe for the individual to walk through without getting cut. There are sayings that will stop the rain from falling heavily, others that make the rain fall, others for getting rid of evil spirits from around the surroundings of a home, others to encourage fish to bite to enable a good catch. From within the category of 026 maimu 'serious speech', this study chooses one subtypes, tareng 'ritual blowing chant', to focus on and deal with comprehensively (see Section 4.3).

A category distinct from

175 maimu 'serious language' is ebadagangdok

'narration', the act of speaking to narrate a story, a happening, a biography, history, one's

own life history or fiction. This is evident in the various Akawaio speech forms which are

classified within this category, as they represent the different types of narratives: (1)

pandong 'story'; ( 2 ) zegareme'nodok 'personal narratives'; (3) ye'ku'sak egamadok

'reported speech'; (4) go'mangno'pi egamadok 'historical narratives'; ( 5 ) igubi

egamadok 'procedural narratives'; (6) zauro 'no'p'iegamadok 'conversational narratives7

and (7) egaremedi' 'gossip'. Pandong 'story7 and zegareme'nodok 'personal narratives'

are two of the Akawaio speech genres which are being analysed in this study, therefore

they are described in great detail (sections 4.5 and 4.6, respectively). Ye'ku'sak

egamadok 'reported speech' is the act of narrating an event or happening based on

someone else's account. There are various ways for doing this in Akawaio and will be

discussed as a strategy in story telling (section 4.5). Go'mangno'pi'egamadok 'historical

narratives' refers to stories told about the remote past, or simply historical accounts of the

history of a place, its people and their origins. Igubi' egamadok 'procedural narratives'

represents speaking in the form of instructions, telling how to make handicrafts, process

cassava and all its products, or to perform various rituals such as puberty rites, manhood

rituals and funeral rites. Zauro'no'pi' egamadok 'conversational narratives' refers to

stories told during a conversation between two or more people in an informal setting.

This is also possible in a formal setting, as exemplified in a constructed conversation

between an informant and a researcher. Finally, egaremedi' 'gossip7 is the act of speaking

about others in a bad way, by indulging in idle talk or spreading rumours about them. It is

also the act of repeating idle talk and rumours, especially about the private affairs of

176 others. In Akawaio culture, egaremedi 'gossip' is considered ori maing 'bad speech', because it is used by jealous, malicious and envious people. Such people tend to talk about others in private rather than in a public forum.
Areruyah maimu eremui 'Hallelujah spiritual songs' (literally 'Hallelujah language songs') are mostly traditional Akawaio spiritual songs, which have been included in the repertoire of modem day hallelujah spiritual songs. Many of these songs are believed to be composed by the spiritual entities and spiritual guardians of the shamans. The shamans, who are the mediators between the real and the supernatural world, are taught these songs and they in turn introduce them to their society at appropriate times. This is why many of the spiritual songs are only sung by shamans and adults, and children are not allowed to learn them because their spirits could be led astray by the powerful spirits, the owners of the songs. The songs are also described as being too hot for the children because their very power can be fatal to them. This is because the songs are not of this world. Many of these types of songs are also learnt in visions by the shamans during their intense training. This is necessary because they must be able to lead in chants and songs in seance ceremonies, which is an integral part of this highly spiritual event.
Hallelujah, as the name suggests, refers to the only known syncretised religion practised by the Akawaios of the Upper Mazaruni District in the hinterlands of Guyana. It was developed in the early 1 7 c~ent~ury following the claim of a Makushi man named Bichiwing that he was given the name of the religion 'Hallelujah' by God through a vision. This vision took place at the home of a white missionary in England. Hallelujah is structured along the principles of Catholicism and Protestantism, acknowledging a

177 supreme being. During the development of the religion, this notion of a supreme being became a new dimension to the traditional Akawaio spiritual belief system. Therefore, prayers are said in the name of mama meri (Mother Mary), paba inggadi (father God) and uwi Jezek (elder brother Jesus). While such an assimilation exists, Akawaio style ritual forms of worship like feasting, dancing, healing ceremonies, ritualistic baths, drinking and days of general spreeing and chanting remain at the core of the religion. Akawaio spiritual leaders such as the piyai'ma (shaman) and other spiritual leaders selected through visions and callings preside over all the hallelujah ceremonies. Although it was founded by a Makushi man, many Arekunas, Kamarakotos, Taurepang, Patamunas and Akawaios were converted to it. Over time, only the Akawaios remained as practitioners of Hallelujah (see also Butt Colson 1954, Henfrey 1964, Butt-Colson 1967, Fox & Dams 1993, Fox 1996).
Category three, the areruya maimu eremui are hallelujah Spiritual Ritual Songs which are subdivided into three types. These consist of: (1) tamboronggong eremui 'congregation songs7which include egorgang 'ritual bath' songs, tuguik 'humming bird dance7 songs, ebiremang 'prayer7 songs, uruwaik 'funeral' songs, and sambura '???' songs. They are referred to as congregation songs because the congregation who makes up the Hallelujah church are all allowed to participate in performing these types of songs. They are ritual activities that allow participation en masse.
The second major category of areruya maimu eremui is ( 2 )piyai'chang eremui 'shaman songs', such as imawari 'spirit' songs, emba'ka 'invocation7 songs, zebi'tong 'ceremonial healing' songs, enu'no eremu 'song of the ascending spirit7,and a'kwari nu'to 'descending spirit' songs.

178 Finally, there are the toworo go'manno eremui 'every day activity songs' which are associated with everyday activities such as trawazo eremu 'work songs', associated with activities such as cassava (manioc) grating songs, planting, hauling a newly made canoe down to the river and paddling. It must be noted however, that at the present time these work songs are hardly ever used if at all. Also, there are mire we'numba eremu 'lullabies' (literally 'song for putting a child to sleep'). These are of two kinds: one is composed to frighten the child to sleep without crying and making a lot of fuss. These are mainly for toddlers who are already talking and understand the meaning of fright. Characters such as frogs, snakes ,tiger, the giant mountain man or the giant grasshopper are called upon in the song to come and get the crying and bad-behaved child and take himlher away. The other category is for little babies, lullabies that are more reassuring, soothing and pleasant. Most of these ask the baby to go to sleep so that hislher mother can cook food and prepare the game hisher father is bringing home. It also reassures the baby about the love the family has for himher. Another type of lullaby which is sung during the night refers to other babies in the animal kingdom, like baby tadpoles who never cry to go to sleep and baby birds who are never heard crying in the stillness of the night, so as to avoid the detection of the location of their nest by their prowling enemies. The idea here is to ask the baby to do the same. Next comes ji'nfnggang eremu 'love songs', the songs sung to woo lovers or songs sung by jilted lovers. Many of these songs tend to have a more contemporary melody, influenced by coastal Guyanese Creole folk rhythms, Christian spirituals and some aspects of Spanish and Brazilian rhythms. A prototypical traditional love song was

179 more wailing and dirge-like, and would be either sung slowly or played on the flute. The words of these songs were based on comparing love and beauty as reflecting nature and the environment and the relationship of man to these. Present-day love songs have words that are comparable to any mainstream lyrics that portray madwoman relationships as being based on general love, love-making, commitment, money and sustained loyalty to one another.
Next-to-last is pandong eremu 'story songs', which are of two types. One is a song that tells a story or songs that are sung to illustrate characters within stories.
Finally, mire aburobodi 'praising rhymes for children', is a way of rhythmic speaking to a child by hislher mother. It is performed on mainly young babies and toddlers. They consist of different types, depending on the gender of the child that is being praised, with distinct praising rhymes for male and female children. A full description of the praising rhymes for children is in section 4.4.
In relation to the foregoing discussion on how Akawaio speech genres are classified, the focus now narrows to the four speech genres that are selected for analysis in this study: (1) tareng 'ritual healing chants'; (2) mire aburobodi 'praising rhymes for children'; (3) pandong 'story' and (4) zegareme'nodok 'personal narratives. This is to give them a fuller treatment, to describe them as individual types of Akawaio speech categories, and to establish whether they each represent a genre and in this way how they are placed within the proposed Akawaio classifications of ways of speaking as exemplified in Figure 4.1. The above is achieved by comparing and contrasting the speech genres for several reasons: (1) to uncover patterns of the variation of the language among them; (2) to observe differences and similarities in the general features of each

180 genre; (3) to observe co-occurrences and redundancies in the performance of the genres and in their social status as speech acts and social events; (4) to show similarities in the points of references within which the speech acts are encoded and presented; (5) to assess the relationships and functions of these genres to Akawaio society as a whole; (6) to show the peculiarities of the language used within each genre; and (7) to show the social context within which each one is performed, and the interrelatedness that exists across the genres. The focus is now on describing each of the Akawaio speech forms.
4.3 Tareng 'Ritual Healing Chant' The first Akawaio speech genre, the tareng 'ritual healing chant', is represented
in this study by the six chants used to cure kwazuuk 'diarrhoea'; mingbok dong 'haemorrhage (as suffered by women)' ; ogi'ri'wa 'toothache; inggebra ingduung 'fast delivery'; W m a i k 'gingivitis' and mareriya 'malaria' (see appendix B, p.532).
The Akawaio tareng 'ritual healing chant7 is a speech act performed to cure an illness by a tareng ezak 'owner of tareng'; it is not a public performance. It is comprised of short verses performed as units, which are characterised by petitions or requests to animals, plants, fishes and natural elements by the healer, who then assigns himself to be the medium through which these act to cure the patient. For this reason, when chanted by the healer, the tareng constantly alludes to identifications of the self during the performance, as the medium through which the request granted by some appropriate animal or plant for curing the illness is filtered unto the patient.
Usually the tareng calls upon an appropriate animal or plant, whose attributes are known to be the opposite of what the patient is suffering from. For instance, the cure for

181 diarrhoea names the sloth because its faeces are always known to be hard; the cure for toothache names the otter because he has good teeth. This shows that the Akawaio tareng is based on metaphor, where animals, birds, fishes and plants are used as entities for their qualities as concrete objects with extended and transferred meaning for curing illnesses, as argued by Lakoff and Johnson (1980:5). Tareng in this case is a metaphoric strategy whereby animal attributes are directed unto a patient after assistance is sought from them through quiet chanting. The tareng chanter is the medium through which the various attributes of animals and objects are transferred and are invoked by the word power of the tareng ezak.
This is very similar to the Suya of Brazil as described in Anthony Seeger's work on sangere 'curing songs', where he argued that the naming of attributes of animals, plants and objects within these songs was a main characteristic. For this reason, a Suya child who is suffering from high fever and convulsions would have to be cured through a sangere which names the white caiman. This is because the Cayman is known to lie very still in the water without a tremor and never gets hot. The sangere for toothache would name the wild pig because, although it is an eater of hard roots, its teeth do not hurt. The one for 'easy birth' names a small fish because it is known to slip through the hands easily when one tries to hold it (Seeger 1986:70, 71).
Tareng is mostly performed only in the presence of the patient, very quietly, behind closed doors in a very quiet place. The sick person is not an active participant throughout the entire performance and could be asleep or moaning in great pain. The chanter turns hislher back on the patient, who would either be lying down in a hammock or, in the case of a baby, in the arms of the mother. Then he would bow his head and

182 begin to chants in very low tones and only fast rhythmic whispers could be heard by the patient. This is similar to the Suya of Brazil where the sangere 'curing song' is performed very quietly and is hard to hear (Seeger 1986: 70).
The only other time the patient will hear the tareng ezak is when helshe comes over and blows a strong gust of air onto the affected area before going back to sit and continue his chanting. The format is to chant a couple of verses, then blow on the patient at least three times after taking really deep breaths with eyes closed in a meditative fashion. It is effective when the tareng is performed either directly onto the patient or the patient's food or belongings. Among the Suya of Brazil the healer blows onto the patient as they perform the curing songs very quickly and quietly (ibid). Seeger describes the sangere 'curing song' and its effect on patients as an injection, because the blowing injects a particular powerful essence of animalism, distilled through metaphor, under the skin of the patient and into hislher body. For the Akawaio the tareng ritual blowing is a powerful force for curing, because it is transferred through the breath, the air of communication and the very spiritual life force of a person.
Other people are prohibited from being in the area where the tareng is performed because their negative energies can be a real obstacle to the effect of the tareng as a cure. The other reason is because the secrecy of the tareng itself is protected from those who may want to steal it by learning it or questioning the owner about it. Many times the tareng ezaks are not interested in sharing their tareng with anyone.
The chanter, or tareng ezak 'owner of tareng', is always an old Akawaio male or female. This is important because only older people are good candidates for taking on the sacred responsibilities that come with being a tareng healer. One of these responsibilities

183 is to be someone who is calm rather than temperamental? one who can demonstrate control over hislher own behaviour. This is because when someone has dedicated himlherself to become a tareng healer? he has to learn both good tareng and bad tareng; healers must not be tempted to harm other people?just because they have a knowledge of both. The other reason is because a tareng healer must be able to recognise and counteract the badlevil tareng when it is performed to harm a patient deliberately (i.e.?in the form of a curse).
That older people are the healers also has to do with membership in the sacred society of healers, where certain kinds of tareng are not shared with anyone outside this society. Individuals often have to work hard and convince the senior tareng healers that they were ready to be members of the scared society. Usually the Akawaio tareng healers have inherited the knowledge from their fore parents?who were also known to be tareng ezaks 'owners of tarengy.This is why it is very true that some families in Akawaio communities are owners and experts of particular types of tareng and therefore are specialised in specific types. This is an example of one of the ways the tareng is passed on fiom one generation to the next. Another way in which it is acquired is through having visions where spirits of plants? animals and the forest appear to teach the selected learner over time. FinallyyAkawaio tareng is also acquired through tareng exchanges with other tribes? which explains why sometimes tareng have different lexical and grammatical structures.
A candidate may become a tareng apprentice sometime around the age of 30-40 years old. Akawaio children are not taught tareng as a rule but this is known to happen within some families. Seeger (1986.71) pointed out that in Suya culture children are

184 allowed to learn by listening to adult performances because they are known to move in close to performances in a way that adults rarely do or can. Suya children only begin to perform the sangere when they are adults with children of their own. In Akawaio culture listening in to tareng performances by children is strictly prohibited. However, learning of tareng is open to young adults?20-30 years old?and when given permission, they must have the head for it. The Suya rationalisation for allowing children to learn the sangere 'curing songsyis that 'youth is the time when the ear is 'uncloggedy and learning is easy' (ibid).
The word tareng means 'words of fire' in Akawaio, with the etymology of it lying in a compound of two Akawaio words: ta 'sayy and reng 'embers of fire'. This is its meaning both in a concrete sense as tareng are real words of fire, which is why they can cure, and in a figurative sense as a word having the characteristics of fire; that is why it can both cure and harm anyone. In this way, tareng is viewed as the general name for the healing chant itself and tareng, the cure.
Tareng are classified as having different types according to their identity as representing specific cures? which results in a difference in their names and the type of cure they are for. For example? the tareng for toothache is known as ogoriwa edaremui 'toothache tarengy;tareng for malaria as mareriya edaremui 'malaria tarengy;tareng for sore eyes enguuk edaremui 'sore eye tarengy and the one for haemorrhage mfngbok dong edaremui and so on. Each one has its own type of tareng verses for chanting and there can be many different ways in which these verses are worded depending on who the performers are. This is based on which families they are fi-om or which area they are from. This points to the fact that the tareng is used for curing many illnesses and many

185 other conditions, which cover a wide area, and it is used to re-enforce herbal medicines and other things administered to cure a condition.
Such conditions include illnesses caused by diseases, such as tuberculosis, dysentery, diarrhoea, high blood pressure, arthntis, toothaches, all types of eczemas and conditions such as migraines, difficult pregnancies and deliveries, madness, trauma, conditions caused by evil spirits, conditions caused by accidents, such as cuts, bruises, snake bites, bee bites, fractures, abscesses and infected wounds. It can be use to enhance the attributes of people, so there are tareng healing chants for laziness, where it helps people to become more industrious, to make babies walk and talk faster than usual, keep them safe from evil spirits and to keep growing health. Young boys and girls who want to be runners could have a tareng administered upon them to make them good athletes. There is the tareng to make the boys better hunters and the girls pretty, and tareng for children to become good musicians. In addition, tareng is also used to influence love conditions such as bringing separated couples back together; how to make someone fall in love or want another person; to ruin a marriage; to trap a man or woman into wanting someone, and to make someone mad in retaliation. Finally, tareng is also used to control the natural elements, such as the rain from falling too heavily, the high winds from becoming too destructive, the river from rising too high, and calming down the thunderstorms.
Just as how they are different types of tareng, there are different types of tareng ezaks 'owners of tareng' in Akawaio communities, though there is no formality in identifying the types. Therefore, how these types are presented represents the interpretation and classifications formulated by the investigator. There are at least three

186 types of tareng ezaks 'owners of tareng7?assessed by recognising that there are two main types of tareng: wagf tareng 'good tareng' and ori tareng 'bad tareng'. The good tareng consists of tareng for illnesses caused by diseases? conditions caused by accidents? control of natural phenomena? cures for matters of the heart? putting love relationships into motion, enhancing physical and psychological attributes? controlling wild animals from attacking? and re-enforcing charms used to enhanced hunting and fishing skills. The bad tareng consists of tareng for making people sick? causing deterioration in loversy relationshipsy splitting couples apart? physically altering people's physical appearances? such as making someone bald? altering people7spersonality for the better or worse? and other causing conditions that make people sick?uncomfortable or unhappy.
The four types of tareng ezaks are: (1) The good tareng ezak; (2) the bad tareng ezak; ( 3 ) the student tareng ezak; and ( 4 ) the commercial tareng ezak. The good tareng ezak is one who uses tareng for curing people at all times and is dedicated to doing just that? despite the fact that they know both the good and the bad tareng. They hold a very high social status within Akawaio society and even today? they are allowed to assist in difficult medical situations. For Instance?if a patient is having difficulties in a delivery?a tareng ezak is allowed to administer tareng onto the patient by some Akawaio health workers. Each Akawaio community has their own quota of tareng healers and7 as mentioned before? different families are specialised in curing specific illnesses. This is not very obvious to outsiders when they are in these communities because tareng healing is outlawed by the Seventh-Day-Adventist religion at Waramadong and so must be practised secretly. Also? it is not recognised by the official medical institution set up to administer health care in Akawaio and other Amerindian communities. In general? the

187 good tareng ezak is a respected elder within the 60-80 year-old age range, and could be either a male or female, who is on call at all times and does not operate from any specific building or any kind of centre. They set out to heal the sick when called upon, not with a medical bag of paraphernalia in hand, but with a memory filled with the centuries-old traditions of tareng.
The bad tareng ezak specialises in bad tareng and, like the owner of the good tareng? helshe also knows the good ones. The age of such a person is between 30-50 years old and is one who is ridiculed and not very accepted by the larger Akawaio community. Many times this type lives away fiom the village and is not trusted by anyone. Hislher general disposition reflects a quiet person, who walks around with a bowed head, has blood-shot eyes and is generally irritable. In earlier times, helshe played a useful role in waging a silent war against enemies, as mandated by the leaders of the Akawaio tribe. In recent times? helshe fully is wickedly involved in hurting other people, a habit which comes out of either retaliation for some bad thing done against himher? envious feelings for someone, to carry out a bad deed as requested by someone7or to simply just test the strength of their tareng. Some of the things helshe is known to do with the bad tareng include breaking up a relationship?making someone ill with a form of disease? making a woman barren or a man impotent, making a woman or man become flirtatious, causing someone's teeth to fall out7 crippling someone, or making someone insane. This list could extend to nearly any evil thing someone can do to others.
Usually7 this character is easily identified, because helshe belongs to a particular family who also practises the use of bad tareng. When in public? helshe is always very quiet and has the habit of not looking anyone direct in the face during any form of

188 communication with himlher. Despite of the bad profile of the bad tareng ezak, helshe remains functional in Akawaio societyyand is effectively used when the need arises for revenge. Like the good tareng ezak?they do not operate from any fixed place or centre? and must be contacted at home.
The student tareng ezak is a learner of tareng between the ages of 20 and 30 years old. Helshe is doing this following a family tradition?or helshe has been inspired by a vision to do so, or does it as part of training exercises for tribal wars or leadership. Helshe is constantly under the tutor of the tareng teacher.
The commercial tareng ezak is a new category?and refers to one that is willing to use hisher tareng skills in return for financial gain. While helshe does not operate fkom an office, helshe is available anywhere and anytime to perform a requested tareng. The payment for such services is not fixed? and can range from a one-time payment to lifelong payments as mandated by himlher. This is sometimes a problem for hislher clients because the commercial tareng ezak's prices are not standardised?and any amount can be charged, with no concern for the financial status of clients. Sometimesy this way of charging clients has led to life-long serious conflictsyparticularly because the tareng ezak does not know the value of money, and so arbitrarily quotes prices for treatment. In summary, the commercial tareng ezak operates on hislher own and has hisher own financial rules governing the treatments. One important characteristic of the commercial tareng ezak type is that helshe can exploit both the good and bad tareng in full fi-eedom, because he is not committed to practicing either. Hislher main aim is to acquire money.
The tareng texts collected for this study presented three main characteristics: first? each tareng has a beginning?evident in the first set of verses that present the problemythe

189 nature of the illness, who or what has caused the illness, and how the illness is affecting the patient. This is exemplified in the first ten lines of the tareng for ogiriwa 'toothache' (see Appendix B, text B15a) which identifies the problem with the patient. The first line says a'kraraimo ega'nonggazak moro'kong amok a 'the young one has been harassed by some fishes'. The young one here refers metaphorically to the tooth in the patient's mouth, which was originally in good condition and thus young, until attacked by the toothache. Thereafter, several fishes are named as the cause for the ogfrfwa'toothache'. The patient has been eating all these fishes overtime, and so the tareng chanter blames them for causing the teeth to rot. Then, in the eleventh line of the ogirfwa tareng, the chanter repeats the first line again: a'krarimo eganonggazak 'the young one is being harassed,' to re-emphasise the problem or the illness to be cured and to close the introductory part of the tareng.
Part two of the tareng is where the tareng performer identifies himself as the one who is going after the illness, as the medium through which the condition would be cured, and how this will be done. This is exemplified in lines 12 through 14, where the tareng chanter says eborobok sa'ne eaik ko 'I am finding the cause myself,' i'nopangabok sa'ne eaik ko 'I am cooling it myself,' and uro bero eji'ma 'I am being myself.' The tareng performer who identifies himself as uro 'I' or me is a ka'pong 'person or human being', and is very powerful, since he identifies himself not just as being human but as the spiritual being that he is.
Finally, in part three the performer switches his identity to being the embodiment of the otter in the tareng for toothache, lines 15 and 16. At this point, he speaks on behalf of the otter, whose attributes are invoked for curing the toothache: nigaang sa'ne

190 bek uro do sarorowa'kong 'am I saying this as the waterdog?? The final verses are repeated twice.
The other characteristics of the tareng text have to do with the fiequency of some words in them, such as ega'nongga 'to seriously harass ~ o m e o n e 'e~borobok 'to find something7?e'aik 'I am', and independent emphatic particles like sa'ne, ko, and do. In addition? there are frequently uses of quoted speech that are peculiar to tareng? such as uro bero eji'ma 'while I am being myself and n@aang za'ne bek uro do 'Am I saying this as myself?' The repetition of these quoted speech forms appears twice at the end of the tareng, to reinforce the power of the cure as directed by the chanter. This is typical of all Akawaio tareng? and these quoted speeches reinforce the formality7 as well as the cohesion and rhythm of the tareng as an oral performance. The use of quoted speech here is to both detach the tareng ezak from his form as a physical person and to embody the powerful spiritual entity who is capable of healing an illness? as the medium through which animals?birds?reptiles?fishes and plants can give their assistance to cure an illness upon request. It follows that once a tareng healer says niga ang sa'ne bek uro do 'Am I saying this as myself?' he is not referring to his everyday physical self?but to his other spiritual self?or his identity as a plant?animal or fish.
Finally? tareng is not a public form of address and is classified as formal speech because its performances are fixed and predetermined. This is why the tareng ezak is expected to perform it exactly the same way as it was taught to hisher teachers by the Akawaio ancestors. This is clear to all members of Akawaio society? because the principles and rules of tareng are known to the entire community. It is performed only in the presence of the patients who are being healed, and sometimes their close relatives.

191 Outside of this, no one is allowed to listen in on the healing ceremony involving tareng. Among the San Blas Kunas and the Suyas of Brazil, the ikar 'curing chant' and the sangere 'curing song' also do not have an audience when they are performed. Like the
Akawaio tareng , the Kuna ikar 'curing song' has only two main people present during
the performance: the addressor, who is the knower of the ikar, and the addressee, known as the suar mimmi (Sherzer 1974.263-267). The Sun Blas Kunas also tend to perform some types of their ikar 'curing chants' in public and for entertainment purposes. For the Akawaio no type of tareng is perfomed in public, and even when a tareng chanter wants to do a tareng in a public place, for instance to send away the rain or a thunder storm, it is done quietly.
The other points about tareng are that it is not performed in everyday language, although there are some similarities between them. There are two major kinds of lexical differences to be found between the language used in a tareng and that used in colloquial Akawaio. First, some lexical items in the tareng are archaic Akawaio forms, which are never used in everyday speech. For example, the tareng form wannaburimo 'grass', shows the archaic full final syllable bu that has reduced to k in the everyday term wannak 'grass.
The second kind of change between everyday and tareng vocabulary is the addition of extra morphological material to make them sound more impressive and ritualistic. There are four morphemes that pervade the ritual in a tareng: -imo 'Augmentative', -gong/-kong 'Plural', -neri 'type of something', and -i 'Possessed item.' These are all nominal suffixes, used to portray specific extra meanings. While these morphemes are encountered in words in everyday Akawaio language, some of their

192 meanings are changed and are consistently used in the tareng text, so as to be characteristic of it. Thus, the -imo suffix means something giant-sized or bigger than usual; in everyday speech, it only shows up on lexicalised forms, like ogo-imo 'anaconda7 (literally oversized snake') and pakara-imo the name of the local mountain range (literally 'oversized testicles'), but in tareng speech, it appears to be used more productively, such as kwazugu-rim0 'excessive, serious form of diarrhoea7 fiom everysay kwazuk 'diarrhoea7. Similarly, -gong/-kong means tribe or species in tareng rather than just indicating plurality, like in everyday speech? and -ri indicates 'type of something' in tareng, whereas it is a non-productive marker of possessed status in everyday speech? restricted to a few nouns. Finally, -i indicates possession both in everyday language and in tareng, but in tareng it occurs on some words where it has been lost in everyday speech, e.g., wanabui 'the grassyinstead of wanak 'grass'.
The third type of change is substitution of ritualistic vocabulary for everyday vocabulary, either by changing one or more sounds in the everyday word or by having a completely different word. An example of a sound change is the word kidada 'grasshopper' in tareng speech, with the first sound changed from the everydaypidada 'grasshopper7. An example of substitution of the entire word is manjik 'girl' in tareng speech, as opposed to uri'chang 'girl' in everyday speech. The tareng ezak who have been interviewed insist that such substitutions all represent the use of archaic language in the tareng, an assertion that can only be tested with future comparative studies.
Generally, the language of the tareng 'ritual healing chant7 uses metaphor very effectively to develop a fixed ritual way of speaking in Akawaio. One reason is to prevent the spirits from understanding what is being said during the curing process. This is to

193 avoid an obstruction of the healer's powers by the spirits, which might result in a negative reaction on the patient being cured. The other reason why the language of tareng is disguised is to maintain its fixity and formal characteristics, since it was handed down in this way from generation to generation by Akawaio ancestors.
4.4 Mire aburobodi 'Praising Rhymes' for Male or Female Children The second type of Akawaio speech genre to be analysed in this study is mire
aburobodi 'praising rhymes for children'. There are only two distinct types of praising rhymes for children, both exemplified in this study: male and female praising rhymes. However, since both text examples of each type of praising rhyme (two for female and two for male) are so distinct from each other, this chapter analyses all four. Mire aburobodi' 'praising rhymes' is the act of ritual and playful praising of the male or female child within the age range of six months to two years old by a mother. It is only performed by mothers, and it is one of the activities which exemplifies a tangible way in which a mother shows her love for her child, and also it provides a medium to contribute to the socialization of her child as a malelfemale in Akawaio culture.
The performance takes place anywhere, but it is done more often near the fireside, after the bath of the child in the morning. Usually the bathing of the infant takes place around six o'clock in the morning; this bath extends into grooming activities and the shaping of the various body parts of the baby. This is done by rubbing, massaging and manipulating the feet, calves and arms, to guide them into the perceived ideal shapes acceptable by Akawaios. Thereafter, the baby's entire skin was rubbed with oils, then adorned. In earlier times, a necklace full of colourful macaw bird feathers and seeds with

194 matching armlets and anklets was put on around the neck of a baby boy. A baby girl wore necklaces made out of colourful seeds and beetle wings. Her anklets, made out of colourful beads, were tied in place. However, this elaborate preparation of the baby prior to a praising rhyme is no longer evident today.
The praising rhyme is then performed by the mother by holding up the infant on her lap in a standing position. She begins to repeat the praising rhyme loudly, rhythmically and playfully to the child while looking up at him or her directly. There are a lot of rhythmic head gestures and happy facial expressions during the performances. The child responds by enjoying this attention and would begin to laugh aloud, coo and dance up and down, while still on the mother's lap, to the rhythm of the praising rhyme. The baby does this throughout the performance of the rhyme.
There are two kinds of praising rhymes: warawok mire aburobo'tok 'praising rhymes for baby boys' and uri'chang mire aburobo'tok 'praising rhymes for baby girls' (see Appendix B, texts B17-18). Individually, the praising rhyme for the male and female centres around two gender specific roles. For the female, the main foci are on being beautiful, which is very different in Akawaio, and being an expert in processing cassava into various products, such as the cassava bread and local beer. Female beauty in Akawaio is based on the broadness of the back, wide hips, strong calves, long flowing hair and brute strength. Facial beauty is not very important. For the male, the main foci are on being handsome, on being an accomplished hunter of big game, such as the deer, wild pig and tapir, and having the physical body to successfully accomplish this. The emphasis on these two gender-specific activities (processing cassava and hunting) is ultimately based on their importance in Akawaio culture.

195 Cassava products are the main staple of the Akawaio people, and thus socialization of the women centres around production and processing of cassava~yucca/manioc.This is a root vegetable for which great skill is needed by the Akawaio woman to plant it, harvest it, fetch it from the farm, which is often located as much as six to ten miles away from the village, and to process it. Various rituals are associated with the processing of cassava, and without having the knowledge for processing it, an Akawaio woman is considered useless. Similarly, the male in Akawaio society is expected to be a great hunter and fisherman. Akawaio males are seen as being particularly enterprising and resourceful when they can hunt down big game. This is because it takes physical strength and endurance to catch and kill them for food, while requiring complex hunting rituals to enhance these attributes. The structure of the praising rhyme itself consists of two parts. In the first, the mother, the performer, establishes the gender and status of the child. Status of the child means that helshe is being spoken to as an adult and as one who has things to do on earth. The baby is also sometimes seen as the reincarnation of a dead relative, so that if it is a boy and he shows any attribute of a dead father or brother, he is treated like that relative. This is alluded to in some individual rhymes. The second part consists of praising the child with regards to hislher physical condition and other attributes. In particular, the mother emphasizes how these attributes are to be used to perform various gender-specific roles. For the male child, this means bringing game home for a mother by hunting and fishing, building a house, cutting down a farm, protecting his mother, and in all other ways being an ideal Akawaio male. For the baby girl, this means processing cassava,

196 cooking, making lots of beverages of all kinds, and making the young men cry because of her beauty.
There is much exaggeration about the male baby's physical attributes and during the performance the mother would ask questions like 'Where are your cute little feet or calves which you will use to bring home game for me? Are you the one who will shoot the yarrau fish for me? Where is your cute penis through which you urinate and one which looks like the beak of the bird?' The mother then answers these questions accordingly with much enthusiasm and pride. This preoccupation with the body is in keeping with Akawaio expectations of the physical male. Akawaio men must be wellbuilt, muscular, strong, with muscular calves and sturdy feet. These attributes are seen as being ideal for running down big game during hunting, fishing, preparing the fields for cassava, cutting and fetching lumber and other materials for building a house, paddling a canoe for long periods during travel, and generally for enduring all types of manual labour and feats. Reference is also made about the male penis as the symbol of his manhood, and is described in one male praising rhyme as resembling the beak of the birds hunted by the male (C.W Male praising rhymes).
Generally the praising rhyme is performed to the child as though helshe is an adult and as though helshe was understanding what was being said. Although the child at six months to two years old could be at different stages of growth, talking and having good comprehension for any kind of speaking is limited. This is obvious to the Akawaio mother and to counteract this, when the mother asks questions of the child in the rhyme, she does not await an answer, but answers them herself in a jocular fashion. In another sense, she is talking to the child as an adult because there is the perception that the child

197 represents the re-incarnation of a relative. Hence, although helshe is a baby the spirit in hirnlher is an adult.
A praising rhyme does not have fixed verses because a different one is developed for every child, created on the spot by the mother. Further, even this one is not going to be the one to be performed every time to the same child. This is because the mother has the freedom to create verses for the praising rhyme by ad libbing each time she praises the child. While they are all performed in the same way, each Akawaio mother is known to have her own repertoire and style for praising rhymes. Mothers can say anything to their children in the praising rhymes while ad-libbing and only they can decide on the length. Even so, there is a fixed template around which the creation of the praising rhymes must be developed, and this takes into consideration the general aims for performing the praising rhymes.
First, a praising rhyme is the medium through which an Akawaio mother shows her love for her child. At the same time it serves as the ideal way to (1) socialize her child; (2) place the child into a social position in relation to his mother; (3) teach the child hislher specific gender roles; (4) build up Akawaio pride and self esteem of the growing child; (5) initiate the child into feeling good about hislher own body and the functions of it as an Akawaio; (5) play with the baby; (6) give the baby a fond name, which can be used thereafter by relatives and (7) satisfy a mother who is fantasizing about having a child who she can be proud of (see examples of all this in the praising rhymes in appendix Bytexts B17-18). Praising rhymes reflect these values at all times, so the creativity of the Akawaio mother is constrained by the need to conform to these norms.

198 The languaged use in performing a praising rhyme sounds exactly like baby talk in Western societies. It is very rhythmic, repetitive and fond. The Akawaio mother would speak with a high pitched voice, in soft tones, and call every word like a child that is just learning to talk. This is done in a sing-song manner that expresses extreme fondness, marked by the frequent usage of the diminutive particle ri'kwo 'petite, cute, precious'. Certain everyday words are pronounced differently in praising rhymes, in some cases as apparent archaic forms, such as tuguruji for everyday tuguik 'humming birdy and pa'wiji for pawik 'powis currassow (crax alector)'. Others are simply augmented in ways that sound more precious, such as sawa'waru for pawaru 'toasted cassava bread drink', chinanggurii genang for tinanggu genang 'one with beverages'
and simoineridong for moinedong 'handsome men/boysY.
In summary, praising rhymes are a platform where a child is treated as a body, an individual with a distinct personality bearing important pro-Akawaio attributes which necessitate hislher acceptance into Akawaio society. This is clearly the preoccupation of the Akawaio mother, the performer who through this medium seeks to instil and portray the self images of an ideal Akawaio.
4.5 Pandong 'Story' The third and fourth Akawaio speech genres that are the subject of this study are
pandong 'storyy and zegareme'nodok 'personal narrativey. These both belong to the same category, ebadagangdok 'narration' (recall from Figure 4.1). They are distinct because a narrative is not a discrete category in Akawaio but a prototype (cf. Tannen 1984:95). By virtue of this, the term for storytelling acts and those of speech events such

199 as personal narratives are not autonomous. While all the speech events in the ebadagangdok 'narration' category could be referred as subtypes of a single genre, each one is distinctly identified as a separate speech event by the assignment in the Akawaio languages of special names (again, see Fig. 4.1). The important thing about ebadagangdok is that it presents itself and its subcategories as a collective belonging to the same type.
The analysis of pandong 'story' in the remainder of this section is not only limited to its strict definition as a way of speaking to recount events, but in addition by the sense that it consists of stories about birds, animals, fishes and non-human characters. In addition, pandong stories explain the relationship of Akawaio people to the environment and the non-human world and explain their place in such a world. Pandong 'story' is one of the mediums through which Akawaios classify their world generally. These terminological discriminations within the pandong 'story' and zegareme'nodok 'personal narrative' categories pinpoint that story-telling is viewed as an activity in its own right, and it does not always occur as part of another activity. In fact, telling stories for their own sake is particularly important for the Akawaios, because stories are used to express the values, mores and ideologies of Akawaio culture. For this reason, storytelling is always a very serious and important activity and is the medium through which cultural knowledge is passed on to the next generation.
This is why, although story-telling serves as a form of entertainment, it is also a forum for counselling and a medium for scolding, a means for developing and practising speaking skills, and for general education of the young. Stories reflect how the Akawaios explain their origins and existence, and are an important part of their world view. This is

200 in contrast with such cultures as the European Jewish culture, where telling stories for their own sake is seen as running counter to the professional speech ideals of the Jewish community (Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 1974: 284). This is because a lamdn 'learned man or scholar' is not expected to express Jewish ideals through the story medium. In fact, expressing anything through just a story medium was characteristic of people with lower status, such as women, lower class men and deviants. In this sense, European Jewish women are defined as gossipers who engage in idle talk and tell stories not just to make a point, but for their own sake (ibid).
First, pandong 'story' is said to be a connected narrative of important events of the remote past (history), for reporting previous experiences and narrating some incident or event. It is the act for making a statement or a report regarding facts pertinent to a particular situation, for giving a detailed account of the career of a particular individual (autobiographical narrative) or sequential facts about one's life (personal narratives). For the Akawaio, pandong 'story' is a way of speaking, which includes personal narratives and traditional stories in the sense of the Kalapalo of Brazil (as described by Basso 1986: 120).
There are different types of pandong 'story' in Akawaio. These include idobiya pandomii 'creation stories', zewa'nomang bandomii 'war stories', ebanamang bandomii 'stories based on morality', ka'pong bandomii 'stories about people', stories about piyai'ma 'mountain giant, kone'o 'rabbit', other ok 'animals', torong 'bird', a'kwar'i'pi' 'spiritlghost', and kanaimo 'Amerindian killer cult'. The stories in this study represent a wide range of these categories, with two stories about piyai'ma 'mountain giant', and also stories about makanaimo 'Akawaio hero', kanaimo 'Akawaio silent killer cult',

20 1 torong 'bird', and several about kone'o 'rabbit', kaiguji 'tiger', iwarga 'monkey', and wayamori 'turtle' (see Appendix B, texts B1-B9). Beyond those given here, there are stories that cannot be told at night, stories that should never be told in public, stories that are only meant to make people laugh, stories that cannot be told during a hot sunny day, and stories that could only be told by older people, men and women. One example of stories that cannot be told during late nights are snake stories. This is because it is believed that snakes can simply crawl into the storyteller's hammock later, while helshe is asleep. To avoid this, even the names for snakes should not be used in night stories, but they should only be referred to with the word chi'nak 'string'.
There are no major settings for telling a story and so it can be told anywhere except in a healing ceremony or a funeral. The settings for story-telling are very informal and so they are told during a visit to the home of a relative. Story-telling can take place at bedtime, as a form of relaxation when everyone is in their hammocks. This is the time jokes and stories are told late into the night by adult members of the family, taking turns. During this time, the teller is taunted and questioned about details in the story, to test its truth value or simply to evoke laughter. In another context, men who have just come back from long journeys, or hunting and fishing trips, tell each other stories about these expeditions, recounting their experiences to one another. These stories are usually told while sitting around the fireside at someone's home, while making handicrafts, when drinking, or as part of any conversation. Akawaio children are also known to tell stories to each other during moonlight nights. They sit around in a circle to listen to each other take turns telling stories. This is like a game for the children, and in this way each child is given the opportunity to show off his or her knowledge, and the number of stories that

202 they know. Story-telling sessions such as these are the beginnings to the nurturing of future story-tellers and orators. Finally story-telling can be told during community selfhelp activities such as building a house; cleaning up the village; clearing a field or building a boat. It is a common activity during village feasts, where adult men take turns telling funny stories to entertain everyone. However, in this context the stories are told in a very informal way, and no one is expected to stand in front of an audience just to tell a story.
So story-telling is a very impromptu type of performance, which can take place amidst other activities, without being especially planned to be performed in front of an audience. Sometimes it emerges out of the mood evoke by an informal social activity such as friendly gatherings and in settings where other social bonds are established as the essence of communal life. The duration of telling stories is variable, depending on the context within which they are told and the audience who the story is being told to. For example, the story selected to tell during a community activity should be relatively short and entertaining. Anyone recognising this should do the same when their turn comes around. In contrast, stories told at home to the family at bedtime, while everyone is in their hammocks or just sitting around the fire, can be of varying lengths. Therefore there is no special time frame, and storytelling can go on until the wee hours of the morning. This is only acceptable because storytelling in this instance serves to unify and bring families together, reinforcing kinship solidarity.
There are no professional story-tellers in Akawaio communities today, but there are individuals who are respected expert raconteurs, even though they are not paid for doing this. This means that there are individuals who are narrative specialists without

203 being professional narrators in Akawaio society, as parallel to Kirshenblatt-Gimblett's (1974.284) observations about storytellers in European Jewish culture. Regardless, not everyone is a good story-teller; but older Akawaio males and females tend to be good story-tellers, even though some are always better than others. The reason for this lies in their long experience in telling stories, and the collection of stories memorised over time. They also have the skill to use narrative devices to enhance the story's appeal. In addition, because of their seniority and experience, older Akawaios are aware of which stories are relevant to everyone within the Akawaio society. In this sense, they know which events or narrations are ideal for making a general or specific point and which ones have extra-situational value, such as the story's entertaining, enlightening and newsworthy value. This is why it is important for young people to learn from older story tellers in Akawaio society by simply listening to their narratives as often as possible.
The main characteristic of a good story teller is the skill of successfully delivering the content of a story. By this it is meant that the story teller must know the story well enough not to make digressions, present events in chronological order, keep listeners interested rather than bored, keep repetitions to a minimum, add witty components that would enhance the story told; but even this should be carefully done to avoid embarrassing the listeners. Finally, the story must be told with full use of drama evident in relevant expressions, energy, body movements, mimicking sounds of animals in the story or breaking in to a song when the need arises. It follows that a good Akawaio story teller is a talented dramatic speaker who has the skill for making other people listen and laugh.

204 Participants who listen to story telling tend to be the ones who constantly evaluate the story teller as the performance is taking place, as either telling a good story or not. They tend to participate in various ways, either by looking excited, happy, interested, bored, or by just paying attention. This is evident in the participant's laughter when the story is sweet, their prompting and cheering the story-teller on during the performance, giving supportive comments whenever necessary, and agreeing with the teller by giving loud verbal feedback or expressions which reflect agreement with or involvement in the narrator's performance. On the other hand, participants can promptly criticise the story teller when the performance is not good. There is no laughter, participants can stop the teller with clarifications and disagreements, participants can ignore the story teller and have a different conversation, and when the story is told at bedtime participants can simply fall asleep. The characteristics of Akawaio stories could be assessed within the model suggested by Labov and Waletsky (1967), who suggest six different components of narratives: (1) the abstract, which summarises the main point or result of a story; (2) orientation, which identifies characters, time and place; (3) complicating action, which recounts events in a chronological sequence; (4) evaluation, which is the process of transmitting attitudes or emotions of speaker and/or other characters; (5) result or resolution, which provides the point of the story and (6) coda, which terminates the story, so that listeners do not ask 'and then what happened?' For Labov and Waletsky, a narrative should always have complicating action and resolution, while all the other components are optional.

205 Placing one of the Akawaio pandong texts, Turtle Story (Appendix B, text B9) into Labov and Waletsky's model, it is found that the turtle story begins with an abstract. This is reflected in the story-teller's introduction, which says wayamori eji'pi mihG mig'i pandong ji "There was once a turtle and this is now the story', wayamori ya kaiguji engu'to'p'i 'The turtle fooled the tiger'. This second line (line 011 of the text) represents also the orientation of the story, since it identifies the main characters, time and place. What becomes evident here is that the turtle is the main focus of the story, as tiger is hardly ever referred to directly. The next four lines (012-015) summarize the complicating action of the turtle story, as it seeks to give a chronological sequence of the events in the story. Thus, the events in the story begin by the first thing the turtle says to the tiger: abine m'ig'imong padawaya ek ane mo bona mig'iyeno'mago t a w ya 'He said, "Please throw me away among those padawa trees!'" mong padawaya yek mo na'nek chiya "'Among those padawa trees, look them over there far away.'" In the first three sentences, there is no mention of who is to do the throwing and who is to be thrown. Only when the tiger actually throws the turtle away does the story teller make it clear that the turtle was asking the tiger to throw him away, so that the tiger would not eat him (016). Then in line 016, the tiger throws the turtle away, and in 017 the turtle falls into the water where the padawaya trees are. In 018 turtle swims and crawl out of the water. Suddenly, in line 019, the turtle is being described as still in the water and swimming to the surface. Then in line 020, the turtle is described as coming out of the water finally and going its way. In lines 021 and 022, the turtle is said to have met the tiger again, although the word 'tiger' is not mentioned directly, but rather as eno'maningni'pi 'the one who threw

206 him away7.Hereafter, the story teller seems to skip some relevant facts, but still seems to maintain some chronology. This is evident in line 023, where the turtle is described as being on the surface of the water, and is saying to the tiger abine domba amok migi egam 'pogo 'Wait ask my relatives'. Again, it is not clear that there was any conversation between the tiger and the turtle, about tiger wanting to eat the turtle. Despite this, only what the turtle said to the tiger is quoted by the storyteller, without any background. The storyteller explains that the turtle was lying to the tiger about the kamaraiwa birds being his relatives in entry 024. In entry 025 and 026, the turtle is described by the storyteller as still talking to the tiger, but this is not reflected in the sentence, since there is only the turtle saying abine diurumi ji kozo'kwak, kozo'kwak.. .kak...kak.. .kak egebe ji, 'Wait and listen to how they are squawking, they are squawking very loud', kamoro ji domba amok 'Those are my relatives7. Finally, as the story is about to end (as portrayed in entry 027), the tiger is indeed terrified with the strange squawking of the kamaraiwa birds, who the turtle said were his vicious relatives. As the tiger runs away in fear the turtle is said to continue saying domba amok kamoro kamoro domba amok 'They are my relatives, they are my relatives'. In entries 029, 030, and 031, the story ends by the storyteller saying moro gaza ro ye'podi'p'i moro na'nek 'That is how he use to be in that very way7, and moro rogeng moro gaza biandomii eji 'that is all, that is how his story is7.
The turtle story also contains the evaluation characteristics as suggested by Labov and Waletzsky (1967). Evaluation in a story refers to how a narrator transmits attitudes or emotions into his storytelling, and how he does this to other characters in the story. The storyteller became so involved in the story during the climatic juncture of the turtle story,

207 such as when the tiger agreed to throw the turtle away and when the turtle actually got away by playing a trick on the tiger. The storyteller talks faster and the various intonation patterns in his speech are more exaggerated. He also uses more sound symbolic
expressions in Akawaio, such as 6k! (entry 027), which tells the listeners to 'pay
attention', because something is about to happen in the story; haing!, an expression to describe sudden absence (entry 018); ong!(entry 016) describing a distance for throwing an object; sa'tuup! (entry 017) describing the sound of an object landing heavily into the water; and tarai-darai (entry 018) expression for describing crawling away. In addition, the story teller used a lot of gestures, such as hand movements and pointing with the lips to describe distance, and constant lowering of the voice to mimic the voices of the turtle or the tiger.
The turtle story also portrays Labov and Waletsky's (1967) result and resolution, the component that provides the point of a story. In the turtle story, it is clear that the great mighty tiger was fooled very easily when the turtle said to him that the kamaraiwa birds were his relatives. The turtle particularly selected these birds because they squawked so viciously and loudly. They were so loud that poor tiger had to run away in fear and give up his hope for eating turtle. The point of the story is to never think that because you are so big and strong, you are always smart and can always take advantage at all times. In fact there is always someone much smarter than you.
Finally, it is clear that the Akawaio turtle story has Labov and Waletsky's (1967) coda component as well. This refers to the termination in a story, it points to an ending where listeners do not have to ask 'and then what happened?' This is clearly evident in the ending of the turtle story, when he says m E rogeng moro gaza biandomii eji 'that is

208 all, that is how his story is'. When an Akawaio storyteller makes such a statement at the end of a story, it simply means that there is nothing more to tell.
The turtle story discussed above is the prototypical way of narrating stories by Akawaio story tellers. A summary of the general characteristics of this kind of story telling is necessary to understand the interaction between the speaker and hearers in Akawaio story telling sessions.
First, there are two types of story tellers; those that tell original stories meaning that the stories have originated with the storytellers. The stories were handed down to them by their immediate relatives over a period of time and so they are keepers of the original stories. The turtle story described before falls within the original type story, told by a seventy-nine year old Akawaio man from Waramadong Village. Families are known to specialise in some stories, which are only known to them. Storytellers within this category tend to be older people, about 61-90 years old. The non-original type consists of story tellers who relate stories of every kind, but none are original. The stories within this category were learned from other story tellers within the community, from other groups outside of the community, from the original story tellers or from peers during impromptu storytelling sessions. Many of these type of storytellers are younger, with ages ranging from as young as 8 to 60 years old. There is need now to focus on the main characteristics that are observed in Akawaio story telling and the differences in each story type identified as being either original or not original.
All Akawaio stories are told like a puzzle, and at all times listeners have to keep track of who is doing what to whom without interrupting the storyteller with questions. This because once the storyteller identifies the characters in the story at the beginning, as

209 was evident in the turtle story, they were seldom or no longer referred to by their proper names in the rest of the story. They are only referred to in terms of the 3rd person singular, which makes it hard sometimes to decide which character the story teller is talking about. In a similar fashion, the story is never fully chronological, leaving parts that are not clear even to the listener (see discussion above for the Turtle Story). Due to this non-specificity in the identity of the characters in the narration and the faltering in the chronology of the story, it is often very difficult for non-Akawaio people to appreciate the real gist of the story when reading an English translated Akawaio story. Also the free English translation often looks like itemized phrases with no coherence. This is because the English translation cannot fully capture the way a story is told by an Akawaio story teller. For example, Akawaio sound symbolic words and expressions do not have equivalents in English and cannot be translated while retaining its full effect in a story.
Some of examples of the main features observed in most of the story texts under study included intonation which was triggered by climactic and dramatic junctures in the story, such as when something is about to happen marked by op! an expression denoting something is about to happen or it says to pay attention to something important in the story. This is said in an aggressive, but excited tone. Hei! expression of glee asking listeners to pay attention to the leading character in the story, who is about to outwit the oppressor. This is said by lowering the voice and thereafter making an almost guttural sound. Aigo ri'kwo 'poor one' or 'poor little one' is an expression used by the story when empathising with a character, not necessarily in a genuine way. Aigo ri'kwo is said in soft tones similar to baby talk. Haing! is an expression denoting sudden action, or

2 10 disappearance of a character in the story. It is said while having the hands widely open and with a voice of surprise. Sungwarong-ng! is an expression used to indicate distance in a story. The extra -ng denotes style in speaking. The story teller would add this nasal to the ends of words while pointing towards a particular direction and speaking in a high pitched voice. 0..o..ou! describes shouting in a story and is said by opening the mouth partially, then producing the back vowel 6, then lowering the voice to produce the vowel u.
Many of the stories in this study are also full of sound symbolic words, such as tuu-ru-ruup 'describing an object or someone falling slowly onto the ground', pow-powpow 'describing the flying of a huge bird such as the eagle, sasang-sasang-pesou-pesou 'describing the clumsy dancing of a huge person such as a giant', sa'tuup 'describing an object or someone falling into the river'.
The difference in Akawaio storytelling is also observed in the dichotomy between the original and the non-original stories. This difference is based on some grammatical features that are peculiar to each type of original and non-original Akawaio stories. When original stories are told, the story teller has no reason to indicate in the story that he heard it from someone else. Consequently, the story teller's performance would reflect confidence. This is assessed by the long non-stop narration by the storyteller, which is devoid of repetition. Repetition indicates that the storyteller does not know the story well enough. It is also a strategy used by bad story tellers to take time out to think about what to say next without breaking the momentum. Confidence in a storyteller is also evident when reference in never made to hearing the story from anyone

21 1 or from any place. His performance is natural and funny without almost any effort and questions asked about anything in the story are always answered.
In summary, the original type stories such as the turtle story discussed in an earlier paragraph consist of full prose. It is told as an exemplary story, and so every sentence flows without any pauses and the story teller grips his audience with lots of gestures, singing and any other means that would keep the story alive. This leaves his sentences clear and clean, and there is no use of verb phrases such as ta dok ya 'so they say' or moro gaza tok ya egama'pi 'that is how they told it'. This is because the teller of original Akawaio stories is not depending on another source for his stories.
On the other hand, stories considered as not being original are rife with the repeated use of verb phrases such as ta dok ya 'so they say'; t a w dok ya 'so they said7; tawong moro 'so it says'; negadai dok 'so they said (in the distant past)'; nigabo'angne tok ko 'so they usually say'; taiya 'it says7;tawong ku ze 'this is what it really says'; nigabo'tai tok ko 'so they use to say' and nigabo'ai'nek tok 'they always say'. These phrases and more are in plentiful supply in Appendix B, texts B l , B5, B7, and B8.
Gnerre's analysis of Ashuar discourse encountered such a situation. He pointed out that such stories exemplified a kind of 'reported speech' story, which behaves in this way in contrast to an original story, which does not do this. He indicated that this was the kind told by storytelling performers to a researcher, someone from another tribe or a nonIndian (Gnerre 1986:335). In the case of the Akawaio, a reported speech story is not only confined to those told to a researcher or non-Indian, but is also characteristic of many stories told by young story telling apprentices. It also extends to some older people who are not in the habit of regular story telling and who really do not know the source of the

212 stories they tell. For example, one Akawaio story teller in his piyai'ma (mountain giant) story made this statement: wikpo sa'ji wik tau sa'ji te'seng 'On the mountains, he is one that is within the mountains'. This is followed quickly by tabodibok ne tok mans go 'so they often sayyor 'so they all say' (B8, T.L Piyai'ma Story 016-017). These quotative phrases appear constantly in non-original Akawaio stories because all these stories originated from Akawaio ancestors. By virtue of this, no one must claim the right to them or claim to know them well. Thus, the tok 'they' in ta dok ya 'so they say', and all the other 'theys' in the quotative phrases listed before, is seen as an acknowledgement of the Akawaio ancestors, who are the true knowers of the stories.
In addition, what the story teller is also doing is detaching himself from being the source of the story he is telling. One reason is to show that he cannot be challenged about the authenticity of the story and cannot be blamed for passing on an inaccurate story to anyone. Gnerre observed that for the Shaur, 'reported speech' type stories indicated that the narrator had limited knowledge about the story. It was a way of saying that 'somebody else more reliable than I, with more knowledge than me, told the story'. Gnerre further stated that this way of thinking among the Shuar story tellers was 'the act of embedding the temporal/aspectual frame of reference into a definite past in order to increase the distance between the narrator (in his function as an informant) and the narrative content, to state that somebody (or everybody) once said or use to say.' (Gnerre 1986: 335).
Finally, regardless of the context, place, formality and informality of the story telling performances, Akawaio story tellers continue to used ta dok ya 'so they say'; ta 'pi tok ya 'so they said' and so on, to indicate detachment from being the source of the story.

213 Among the Shaur, whenever a story was told out of context, it triggered the use of such forms as t-Ydu- in Shaur. One such context is the researcher/informant situation, which is considered formal, as opposed to a semantic one by the Shaur. This because it is a special interaction where the researcher (outsider) is silent most of the time and is not engaging in a dialogic way with the informant, in the way the Shaurs do it. For Gnerre, the Shaur forms t- W u - , in the out-of-context story telling represented substitutions for the dialogic interchange. In the Akawaio situation, this is not that clear.
4.6 Zegareme'nodok 'Personal Narrative' The fourth and final Akawaio speech genre that will be described and analysed is
Zegareme'nodok 'personal narrative', whose literal meaning is 'to talk about oneself or 'to gossip about oneself, and also means 'to talk about one's sexual prowess in public'. The last meaning will not be explored in this study, except to say that this is not an acceptable way of talking for the Akawaio. This is particularly so because the performer of such a talk would reveal graphic details of his sexual abilities and his experiences with various women in his life. It is performed by someone who is either drunk or a mere show off. Only males indulge in this act, which is a way of flirting with the women, taking the form of jokes and anecdotes. It is a very informal type of personal narrative and is performed during a public village feast, at a drinking spree or in some other public place in the presence of several women of marriageable age.
There are two types of personal narratives that are exemplified in the texts in this dissertation. The first is zegareme'nodok 'personal narrative', which is identified under ebadagangdok 'narration' and the second personal narrative performed at formal public

2 14 village meetings, identified as miiding maimu (B13-14, C B Personal Narrative, R. Personal Narrative). This second type is a subtype of ozo maimu 'serious language' (see Figure 4.1). Zegareme'nodok in Akawaio is the general term for describing the act of speaking solely about oneself, while miiding maimu refers to 'meeting language' within which a more formal type of personal narrative is performed.
The etymology of zegareme'nodok 'personal narrativey has it's roots in egaremed'i 'narration' and this is noted in the morpheme-by-morpheme breakdown of zegareme'nodok; z- denotes a reflexive morpheme, egareme' 'narrate' (a reduced form of egaremedi) and -nodok a combination of the infinitive -no with the nominalizer -dok. The discussion that follows will first look at zegareme'nodok 'personal narrative' and then contrast this description with a personal narrative performed using formal miiding maimu 'meeting language'. This is to show how these two types are different or similar to each other as genres and ways of speaking in Akawaio, especially with regard to being either formal or informal.
Zegareme'nodok 'personal narratives' are told within various contexts. Two more formal contexts are speaking in public meetings as part of a person's contribution to the discussions at a meeting and the response to a request to talk about him or herself, like the personal narratives told in response to direct questions asked by the researcher in the field. Completely informal contexts are during conversation, to support or to contradict a personal narrative told by someone else, or by simply taking a turn during a conversation. In such a situation, everyone tends to speak about themselves as part of an introduction, or as part of speakersy exchanging stories of personal experiences and of themselves. This is done to compare and illustrate similar points in their narratives (cf.

also Tannen 1984:100). Other less-formal examples are narration by someone who has
stayed away from the community for a long time, introductions when someone is
negotiating for a wife, perhaps by a father who is negotiating for a wife for his son or a
husband for his daughter, and, not least, during gossip sessions. Most personal narratives
are considered informal, the exceptions being the first two types identified above, the first
being performed at an in formant's home and the other at a formal public meeting. The
remainder are informal because they are not performed as structured events.
AE Personal Narrative (Appendix B, text B10) is a zegareme'nodok 'personal
narrative' where a speaker talks about him or herself as a prelude to answering the
researcher's questions about various aspects of Akawaio culture. Consider AE's personal
narrative (OOl), this informant begins to talk about herself and family after being asked to
do so by the researcher prior to talking about cassava (manioc) recipes. Here is the free
English translation of what the informant said;
I was born here at Waramadong. The name of my parents are TL and ML, they are my beloved parents. They are the ones but my father came from Venezuela and my mother came from a savannah tribe in the same Venezuela. This is where my mother, M, came from. This is why we are somehow mixed and can't say who we really are. I don't know but my grandmother was an Akawaio and that is why I can say that I am really an Akawaio and I am one who lives here at Waramadong. I have seven children and they are all girls. There is no boy although I have desperately tried to have one and so I live like this with no boy up to now. I live making children, there is my last child (pointing). She is three years old, my last little child. My age is forty-four years old and that is presently my age. My husband is L, and he and I met and got married. Pastor Abdool married us. That is how we live here at Waramadong. We all live here in a hard way and we are not doing very well, as we have not found a good house, although we are trying generally. We want a proper home. We also do not have a lot of house articles and things. There is nothing for us to work with, such as a dangerous tool like the power saw, it is just not there. This is why our home is like this, although we are trying our best. While this is so, I will now go on to this. That is how I am bringing up my children also, they identify and live as Akawaios. However they are far

away at this time. They are in Venezuela. They work in Caracas, they are helping me and supporting us. They even give us money and they send clothing for us, our shoes and everything. It is good that they send us everything. Our wares and everything and it is like that that our children are helping us. This they do although they are not males, and they are better than the males I say. The male children are always the ones to get drunk and they do this while being far away. But the female children do not do this and instead they bring their money straight home. Then they give me the money and it is enough because there are three of them. They have been paid and they bring the money home. For this reason we live a bit well. I am saying we are far away and this is why we live like this, I am saying. Well, here we make this thing called kashiri (manioc beer). (Informant switches to speak about the recipe for Kasiri)
Examples of the formal zegareme'nodok 'personal narrative' categorise under
miiding maimu 'meeting language' (see Figure 4.1). They are exemplified in Appendix
B, texts B13, CB Personal Narrative, and B14, R Personal Narrative. These are just two
of twelve formal zegareme'nodok which were performed at an honour ceremony meeting
at Wararnadong. The ceremony was to honour all those who contributed to the
development of Waramadong and those who have made the village proud. In this
ceremony, the audience was given the freedom to speak about how they felt about the
people who were being honoured. CB is a female Akawaio elder and R is a middle-aged
Akawaio man.
Both these individuals are particularly hurt about the retirement of the midwife in
the village, since, as she had reached the government age of retirement, she was asked to
leave her position at the health post. Both thought this move was not acceptable, since it
was done without consulting with the villagers. What was not in good taste for them was
the idea that, at the honour ceremony, people were expected not only to honour her
through speech, but to also rejoice with the retired midwife by giving her gifts, hugs and
praises. Both speakers begin by saying they are not happy with the circumstances under

which the midwife is leaving and they are not at the meeting to rejoice, because they are
very disturbed about the retirement. This feeling in both speakers is compounded by the
fact that the midwife was being replaced by a very young nurse with hardly any
experience. They both use everyday language, but a dialect of Akawaio peculiar to the
section of Wararnadong known as Wayawa'pai (see Chapter 2, section 2.3.2 and Chapter
5 throughout. This is not a problem, however, since the dialect is readily understood by
most.
The place where the personal narratives occur is in an open air village square
outside the home of the Deputy-Chief of the village. The meeting is conducted and
initiated by a village counsellor responsible for public events and village health issues.
While the counsellor outlined the rules for speaking at the meeting, he did not dominate
the right to speak. Every speaker was given all the time they needed to talk, but almost on
que, each speaker stopped to give enough time for all the other speakers. The speakers
are both loud and serious, and in R's case almost shouting. Both narratives are fiery and
edged with contempt. Both speakers sound very angry, as shown in their facial
expressions and the intonations in their speech. This is illustrated in the following free
English translation of CB Personal Narrative (Appendix Bytext B13).
You all have made me happy, all of you who spoke, you all sounded happy. However, I am thinking why that is so, since she (the midwife) has left, although I wanted her to stay on. You all said thank you for that, but me, I am not happy and I am in a serious state of sadness. I thought she would have stayed longer to teach me. I do not have anything and I cannot say thanks in that way.
I wonder about what type of person she has left in her place. I have seen her (midwife) make a fuss over those that were giving birth, especially over there where my daughter-in-law was giving birth. She (daughter-in-law) was having a breech birth. Thereafter she went back to look after her, this very one(midwife) again.

In her absence is this how it will be? How? Why? In whose hands will she leave us? We are the ones without a doctor and so let me point this out to you. She (midwife) was training a young health worker and she kept saying to her "DO it like this, like this I say' but this one kept making the same mistakes and kept asking "HOWare you doing it?" I then showed her (apprentice) by saying "Like this, like this!" So while I was thinking that this one (midwife) would be teaching those children (sarcasm referring to the young health worker as children) in this way, and while they have not taken in enough knowledge, ai'tou! (expression of putting down or slamming down an object. Here the speaker equates the sudden forced retirement of the midwife as a put down of the speaker herself.) Are these (the young health workers) the ones who will look after me? They are ones who will kill me and this is not how I have seen the ways of this
one (midwife)... There is also the time a baby was born big and was not
breathing properly and she said to the mother, "Rub the baby in a circular fashion to make it breathe.'' She (midwife) is leaving us with 'those' (rude reference made to the young health workers and a sign of detachment), who will give up on the stillborns and who will not help us in a manner like hers (midwife).
Just like that, in a snatch fashion, she is leaving. She has not said that she is leaving because her administrators want to. This is seriously
making me sad and I am not rejoicing... I thought she would have been
caring for me until I die. What is taking her off at this time? Is it maybe the sinful one? It is only the sinful one who can take you away suddenly, they say (they meaning someone else other than the narrator or Akawaio ancestors).
To such a situation, I am not saying thank you. My grandchildren will say thanks. As an old lady I will go with her. You have made me sad, you have all done it and my spirit is not happy. In her absence I do not even want to go and see the hospital, and the place where she was and the seat where she sat. I will not say, when I am sick, "Let me go and get some medicine," because the children (referring to the young health workers) will give me the wrong medicine and it seems they will poison
me. They are not really trained. That is why I have been sad.. .
Why is there a need to praise her at this sad time? In the meantime her child met me and ask me to come here and I was wondering what for? It is not my custom to come down here, not even to a meeting. However, I have said "Let me go and hear what they have to say," and here it is she (midwife) does not even know why she is being laid off and this does not sound good to me. I thought that she was going to be here longer, although I know she has said that one day her bosses would let her go. I would accept it if she goes in that way, but not in the Akawaio way, but fiom higher up. While I am aware of all of that, I still ask the question: "Who are the ones that are good to replace her?" That is what makes me sad and it worries me and so I am not happy. This feeling is solely on my side and maybe some people are happy. That is all'.

What is noticeable in this narrative is ihe way the speaker personalises the whole issue of the retiring midwife as having a direct impact on her and her family. She also recognises that it will have an impact on the whole community. She is scolding all those who praised the retiring midwife and said thank you by pointing out that it was not the time to be happy but to be sad. She mention several times that she was really sad over the situation. The speech itself was delivered in very angry tones, accompanied with hand gestures, voice changing and contortions of the face.
While the speech did not contain joking and use of expletives, there was a lot of sarcasm and some rude references in the speech about the young health workers who were to replace the retiring midwife. For example, the young medical apprentices were referred to as children who were untrained to help sick people, and as murderers who might poison and kill her because they lacked experience as health nurses. The narrator also alluded to stillborns or babies who are sometimes born not breathing properly. She points out that the young, inexperienced nurses will be the ones who will leave such babies to die because they will not know what to do. Narrator regrets that the retiring nurse would not be there to take of her until she dies, because she does not have any faith in the young nurses. Frequently, the narrator detaches herself fiom everyone who praised the retiring midwife, because she believes that the midwife was not retiring through official channels, but that it was the fault of the Akawaios at Waramadong
Both the miiding maimu personal narratives are performed in everyday language. CB does not take the time to identify the main characters in her narrative, but begins immediately using pronouns like tok 'they?, kfro 'she' and kamoro 'those' to refer to characters. Hearers are left to pick out which of the characters she was talking about

220 during the narration, just as is common in the telling of a prototypical pandong story. AE7s personal narrative is a bit more structured and has a chronology. It has sound coherence and is easy to follow7 with each character introduced explicitly within the narration.
Although both narrative use everyday language, both are considered 'formal speech'. AE's narration is formal because it was performed in answer to the researcher's questions during a recorded interview, a strange speech context in the village. AE's personal narrative is formal because the narrative was organised to happen in a very structured setting. In this case, the researcher made arrangements to meet the informant at her home. The interview was conducted while sitting with the informant at the table, as requested by the researcher. AE7spersonal narrative reflects this structured interview and in her speech she is making sure that she speaks right, so that events are recounted in chronological order and presented in a formal way.
CB7spersonal narrative is considered formal speech because it is performed in a structured event, in a formal Akawaio public village meeting. These meetings have rules of etiquette that require a certain type of behaviour and speech. For instance, some of the markers of formality in an Akawaio village public meeting include the stress on serious speech? which is delivered with a facial expression reflecting a serious appearance, in keeping with the seriousness of the overall themes of the meeting. The speech should not contain joking, teasing, taunting or use of expletives. There should be no lies told in such a personal narrative? because persons speaking in formal situations in Akawaio society are defined by their social status, public positions and personal identities in the sense of Judith Irvine (1979:776-779). These elements are the basis for invoking intimacy and

22 1 pride in Akawaio society. This is why whatever the speaker says in a public meeting is open to public scrutiny and evaluations for truth value.
In Western societies formal situations tend to focus on specific issues and happenings, which then constrains the speaker's topic choice, the speaker's right to change or introduce elements of his speech (ibid). In Akawaio society such restrictions are not emphasised and are irrelevant. Speakers have the right to address a topic the way they know it best, as part of their personal experience and in any way the topic might be relevant to the experiences of the entire Akawaio society. This way of speaking reflects a very personalised way for addressing public issues in Akawaio village meetings. This is done no matter how long it takes, and as long as the speaker's contribution is relevant to the topic at hand. Since most, if not all, of the social happenings and events are interrelated in Akawaio society, analysing one event detached fiom another is virtually impossible. This is why a formal personal narrative at a village meeting legitimises one's personal right to talk; participating in a meeting is seen as an extension of personhood, which is the symbol of all human activity, according to the Akawaios.

4.7 Summary: Why the four Akawaio speech types are 'genres' This section summarizes the characteristics of the Akawaio speech genres
discussed in the preceding sections in terms of three major questions: (1) how is each genre similar (or not) to each other, and in particular, how do they tend to overlap in terms of performance, setting, content, style, overlap in their occurrences and use of language? The answers to this question allow them to be classified as 'genres'. (2) How and why do the genres reflect aspects of Akawaio spirituality and the Akawaio philosophy of language? (3) In terms of this second question, why does every speech type tend to represent a collective, and how do they relate to other speech events and still belong to a wider speech domain within Akawaio society?
As mentioned before, Swales outlines three elements for defining genre, stressing the communicative purpose of the genre, patterns of similarity in structure, content, style and intended audience, and a genre name which is inherited and produced by the discourse community. How do are these elements revealed in the four Akawaio speech genres, tareBg 'ritual healing chant', m?re aburobod? 'praising rhymeas', pandong 'story' and zegareme'no 'persona1 narrative'?
Considering the first element of genre, the analysis of communicative purpose, is clear that all four Akawaio speech genres can be deemed to be speech events, each possessing a communicative purpose. All their main functions and purposes are achieved through speech. Tareng 'healing chant7 is used to cure illnesses, and this purpose is achieved through utterances made by a tareng ezak 'owner of tareng', through structured metaphorical verses consisting of petitions and self identifications, followed by blowing directly on a sick person or hisher food. The communicative purpose of mzre aburobod?

223 'praising rhymes' is clear in the series of gender-specific utterances made to a child by its mother, alluding to the physical make up of the male and female child's body parts to show the relevance of this physiology to becoming an ideal Akawaio male or female. The communicative element of the praising rhyme is embodied in its direct performance by a mother while looking up at the child, who is held up in a standing position on her lap. While praising rhymes are performed privately by a mother to a child, their implications resonate into the wider social world of the Akawaio, functioning as the earliest institution for socializing young Akawaios into their gender and adult roles in the very macho Akawaio society. Pandong 'story' has the communicative purposes of providing entertainment, recounting the past, disseminating knowledge about ancestors and heroes, and scolding wrong-doers in the community or in private homes. In Akawaio culture, stories are told everywhere, which means that an audience is available wherever a story is told, though in a very unstructured way. Finally, zegareme'no 'personal narrative' has the communicative purpose of establishing one's personal history in different social contexts, such as during a conversation, or when asked to speak about oneself, or when someone has returned to the village after being away for a length of time, during gossip sessions, or in public village meetings while contributing to discussions on important issues.
The second criterion that Swales proposes for defining a recurring genre is a pattern of similarity recognised in speech eventslgenres in structure, style, content and intended audience. When the four Akawaio speech genres are assessed against these four criteria, it produces mixed results.

224 First, the similarity in structure between tareng 'healing chant' and mire aburobodi 'praising rhymes' lies mostly in their shortness as a whole constructed unit. Both genres contain special ritual language, but the actual lexical items are very different and their usage also differs. In tareng, ritual language pervades each verse, meaning that there are more archaic verses and words within tareng. There is also greater reliance on quoted speech and metaphorical use of vocabulary to refer to properties of animals, birds, plants, spirits and fishes within the healing chant. In the praising rhymes, only certain words are ritualised to be phonologically different from everyday speech. There is no use of quoted speech, but there is metaphorical speech used to refer to the boy's penis, and all the fishes and animals which he will bring home to his mother as game have ritualised names. In a similar vein, the words to describe the beauty of the girl, and the drinks that she will make, are all referred to by their ritualised names. The only time lexical items in a pandong 'story' become metaphorical is that when stories are told about certain reptiles and monsters late at night, metaphorical terms are used instead of their names so that they will not appear in the dreams of participants, or even in their hammocks that same night. Both pandong and tareng use quoted speech in their language. Like tareng, pandong uses animals, birds, fishes, reptiles, plants and insects, among other entities, but not as metaphorical figures but as the subjects of some stories, and as anthropomorphic characters in nearly all of the stories. Tareng also treats animals, fishes, birds and plants as anthropomorphic beings with powers of various kinds, to assist in curing illness, but only in a metaphorical sense. Zegareme'nodok 'personal narratives' are similar to pandong in that there is no kind of ritualised speech, and they are performed in regular everyday speech. The other ways in which personal narratives

225 is similar to story telling is in its function as the medium for telling stories about oneself and about experiences. Personal narratives and pandong are different to each other because personal narratives personalise their stories, as opposed to traditional stories, where the tellers recognise that the stories being told do not originate with them, but from somewhere else, requiring the use of a lot of quoted speech in traditional story telling.
With regard to structure, the pandong 'story' is similar to tareng and different from praising rhymes in that the structure of apandong is fixed, and it is very important that the content of each story be told in the same way every time, just as is expected of tareng. This is to show respect for the stories, some of which are said to be handed down by Akawaio ancestors since the beginning of time, to be told to all the generations of the Akawaio over time. Therefore, although a storyteller can have a style of his own, they are not expected to change the facts of any story at will. This is also why anyone who is bent on telling a story should know it completely and well before trying to tell it. If this is not heeded, the teller could be faced with listeners who are familiar with the story, who also know how it should be performed, resulting in the denial of the truth value of the story told. This is also true for tareng, which must be performed without any alterations to its original form, since that would be disrespectful to the Akawaio ancestors with whom the tareng originated. In another sense, changing the form of a tareng could lead to viewing it with suspicion. So the performer always knows the tareng as a whole unit before every performance and its contents cannot be altered during the performances.
In contrast to tareng and pandong, the praising rhyme is more informal, because although it has ritualised metaphorical lexical items as a feature of its contents, and although it is not generally given in a public performance, the praising rhyme's structure

226 and content is not fixed; each praising rhyme is created specifically to praise only the one child in the one moment, and different rhymes would be made up to praise a different child, or to praise the same child on a different occasion. In this sense, a mother has the freedom to develop any type of praising rhymes based on the characteristics of each child and according to its gender. The mother does this by ad libbing and this is why she never knows the content of her praising rhymes before performing them to her baby. Similarly, the structure of zegareme'nodok 'personal narratives' is not similar to the fixity of tareng and pandong, because when speaking about themselves and their own experiences, people are not required to faithfully repeat utterances received from others. In this sense, anyone performing a personal narrative never needs to know what will be said beforehand.
In terms of style there is a difference between tareng and the praising rhymes in that tareng is performed using very quiet and secretive speech, in the privacy of a sick person's home. In a tareng healing ceremony, the tareng ezak 'owner of tareng' turns his back on his patient as he utters the tareng, then he walks over to the patient to blow on himlher before going back to continue his chanting. At no time is a sick patient seen as a participant in the tareng performance. This means that the tareng ezak 'owner of tareng' always dominates the ceremony in a powerful way. The only time tareng is performed aloud is when teaching it to students but what is performed is decoded prior to such a performance. This is done by talking about it in a story style, explaining what the archaic forms within its content mean and explaining the rules and regulations that govern tareng performances.

In contrast, the praising rhymes can be performed using a normal tone, similar to the one used for 'baby talk' in western societies. And while they can be performed privately at home, they can also be performed anywhere to entertain a baby, for example while waiting outside of the meeting house for the meeting to finish, or while visiting other relatives. Pandong and zegareme'nodok differ from tareng still more radically in style, with tareng performed by uttering verses very quietly, while pandong is performed loudly and accompanied by gestures, dramatization of characters, dramatic facial expressions, and heavy use of sound symbolic words, and zegareme'nodok may be performed differently, depending on which of the many contexts the performance takes place in. Some personal narratives are performed with great animation for an appreciative audience, while others can be quite private and intimate.
In terms of intended audience, both the tareng and praising rhymes are not public performances, that is, they are not performed in front of an audience as such. However, both have one-on-one contact with the addressee during the performance: the sick person is the only one the tareng is intended for and the only other person present is the performer, the tareng ezak 'owner of tareng'; similarly, the mire 'child' is the only one that the mire aburobod'i 'praising rhyme' is intended for, and the only other person present is the performer, the mother. In contrast, in the performance of the pandong 'story' the performer faces his audience, who will be active participants at all times. The zegareme'nodok audience differs from the other three genres because, while the audiences for the first three are relatively predictable, the audience for zegareme'nodok is so variable, both with regards to who is in the audience and with regards to how the audience participates in the narrative event.

228 With regards to content, each genre clearly has its own cultural and semantic domain that it expresses, and there is almost no overlap in content between the four. Swales7 third criterion is that a genre bear a particular name given to it by the parent discourse community. By this criterion, obviously each Akawaio speech form studied in this dissertation is a genre, as each possesses its own special name in the Akawaio language. In conclusion, it is claimed that all four of these Akawaio speech genres reflect the main aspects of Akawaio spirituality, and in turn, a philosophy of language. Obviously, tareng as a speech genre is so steeped in Akawaio spirituality as to need no further justification of this point, but for the other genres, the connections are not so obvious. In the interests of completeness, the final portion of this section explores how Akawaio spirituality is reflected in each of the Akawaio speech genres. First, all of the Akawaio speech genres reflect Akawaio spirituality in that each one is preoccupied with personhood. In tareng 'healing chant', the tareng ezak 'owner of tareng7embodies the spiritual person, one who can summon his own spiritual power and use his own erubaru 'breath7 as the air or the wind that gives life, to cure an illness. The spiritual importance of the erubaru 'breath7 in Akawaio spirituality lies in how it assists the soul in maintaining the life state of a person (see Section 2.4). It is within this tradition that the tareng speech genre finds itself, and so the tareng ezak 'owner of tareng' recognises the power of erubaru 'breath7 and widely employs it for curing illnesses and other kinds of conditions in Akawaio society. It follows that both acts blowing and making utterances in tareng are required for successfully healing someone. In addition, the tareng ezak is viewed as a wise and important man and very few people

229 in the Akawaio spiritual world are described as being wise and intelligent. This means that only shamans, tribal elders and leaders are destined to be wise because they have more shamanic powers and are suitable to be arbitrators of their society. In general the tareng ezak 'owner of tareng' sees himself as the embodiment of a spiritual being who is able to speak, an attribute only humans have.
Recall also from Chapter 2 that speech is pre-existing, and comes from breathing the air at birth by a human child, whence it is lodged in the brain until activated in later years, when the child becomes a proper human being, marked by being able to speak. This is why the tareng ezak is also capable of becoming the medium for cures petitioned from other living things and objects during the tareng ceremony. These petitions reflects the Akawaio spiritual beliefs about the interrelatedness and unity of the cosmic universe, and the interdependency of everything that exists in it. It is not strange, therefore, for the Akawaio tareng ezak 'owner of tareng' to ask for help during the performance of tareng from the animals, birds, natural phenomena, plants and fishes.
Mire aburobodi 'praising rhymes' are influenced by the notion of personhood in Akawaio spirituality. The baby, a young person, becomes the object of fantasy and a work of art for the Akawaio mother. This speech eventlgenre begins with the body of the child, who, in earlier times, used to be dressed up in appropriate costumes before the praising rhymes were performed. After a bath, certain parts of the baby's body were manipulated in ways that would allow the child, either male or female, to grow with large calves, broad backs, good feet not bowed, a well shaped face, proper biceps, strong ankles and a shapely nose. The body was oiled and then decorated with necklaces, amulets and anklets before a praising rhyme was performed by the mother. Today, the

230 manipulation of the body parts continues but costuming is optional. Clearly, the focus of the praising rhyme is the creation of the ideal Akawaio man or woman, both physically and spiritually, by an Akawaio mother. She utters what she expects of each child in several different ways, directly to them, in a very playful way; she addresses them as though they were already adults. However, the language sounds like baby talk and the child dances to the rhythm of the praising rhyme. Praising rhymes also put words into the mouth of the child and in this indirect way teach the child how to speak as a man or a woman. The importance of the praising rhyme is that it serves to socialise the Akawaio child very early in life to be an ideal and useful person in Akawaio society. In general, the child is thought to present himselflherself as a social whole in the likeness of the cosmic universe.
Pandong 'story' is the tradition that implicates the true nature of a person as defined by Akawaio spiritual philosophy. It has been noted that speaking and speech in Akawaio thought is a spiritual given and has its origins is the air in the spiritual cosmos. In addition, pandong 'story' was handed down by Akawaio ancestors, which means that telling a story must be delivered in a particular way, in the way of the spiritual ancestors. Hence, stories cannot be changed arbitrarily and no one has the right to a story. This means that the pandong egamaning 'story teller' has to know his story well to maintain his prestige as a speaker and must always maintain the truth-value of the stories he tells. Because he cannot claim ownership to the stories told, he resorts to using quoted speech in his stories as the strategy to detach himself from saying the story came from him. As a member of the Akawaio nation he cannot profess to own a story that belongs to everyone.

23 1 Finally, zegareme'nodok 'personal narrative' is a speech eventlgenre that places the person onto centre stage and in this way, it is an event that focuses on personhood. In Akawaio spirituality the person must always represent a unified form. Therefore anything a person does is done as an extension of himself. In Akawaio personal narratives, it is clear that a speaker is forced to define and identify himself and his family before speaking about other things in any given situation. In this study, two kinds of personal narratives are evident, the personal narrative which came about because of the researcher's request and the other personalised narrative, which was performed at a public village meeting. In the first, the speaker takes great care to give details about her family and her life, and the presentation is done in a chronological way. In a normal situation, because mostly men are expected to talk at all times in an impromptu situation, an Akawaio man would always start by identifying himself, his family, and what he has before contributing a point at a meeting or other social gatherings. This is the accepted way of the Akawaios. Again, this shows how important it is in Akawaio society to focus on the social units in the society to define solidarity and unity. In a similar vein, the Akawaio man is expected to present himself as the holistic person he is, and his family and all that belongs to him is seen as part of this whole. His speech is what allows him to contribute to the universe of discourse and is an important spiritual aspect of his personhood. In summary, there is no denying that speaking is the most important part of Akawaio life and this is why it is performed in many different ways for many different reasons. It is a highly institutionalised aspect of Akawaio cultural system and ways of

232 speaking have their origins in how Akawaios view and compartmentalise their highly spiritual world.

233 Chapter 5. Sociolinguistic Variation
In 1999 the first field trip was made to Waramadong village to begin to collect various Akawaio texts to amass data for the researcher's dissertation, which is to focus on traditional Akawaio speech genres, such as personal history, myths and legends, rituals, oral history, procedural narratives and conversational narratives. During this first trip, 40 Akawaio speakers were selected to be interviewed primarily on the basis of their reputation for knowing their language and culture. Secondary bases for selection were their neighbourhood of residence (in order to ensure representation of the entire village) and age (separated into 3 categories: 4 young people [20-30 yrs], 16 middle-aged [31-50 yrs] and 20 old people [51-80 yrs]. In initial inspection of the interviews, the researcher noted far more variation than she had expected, and a brief inspection of the social factors associated with each speaker made it clear that the variation correlated best with the region of Waramadong in which each speaker resided.
One topic of each interview was the personal history of the speaker and also what they knew about the history of Waramadong. Once it became clear that the variation had some bearing on the settlement patterns, the content of all the interviews (including the ones that had not been transcribed) became relevant to help in understanding the variation. Residents perceive Wararnadong as being divided into four distinct sections consisting of, from East to West, (1) Enemoroji'pai, (2) Samawa'pai, (3) Abamang and (4) Wayawa'pai (see Chapter 2, section 2.3.2). Waramadong is located in the Upland Pakaraima region in the Midwest of Guyana (see Appendix A, maps A2-A3), on the left bank of the Kamarang River (see Appendix A, map A4). The main village is occupied along the south bank of the river, with the unpaved Kamarang road coming into town

234 from the East and then ending in a bend in the river about 2-3 miles West of the centre of Waramadong (see Appendix A, Map A5). Section 3, Abamang, is the centre of Waramadong, larger in size and population than the other three sections combined, and housing all the major governmental institutions, including the primary and secondary schools, the Seventh Day Adventist church, the village government buildings and the Health Centre. Immediately to the East of Abamang is the second-largest section of Waramadong, Wayawa'pai, and about 3 miles to the West, separated by the last bit of the Kamarang road, lie the two communities of Enemoroji'pai and Samawa'pai.
The distribution of Akawaio speakers interviewed according to neighbourhood is given in Table 5.1.

Section (2) Samawa'pai .......10
Section (3) Abamang ..........15 Section (4) Wayawa'pai ....... 10
total = 40 Table 5.1 Distribution of Akawaio speakers interviewed in 1999
The preliminary findings of the data showed that the speakers from the other three section, Enemoroji'pai, Samawa'pai and Wayawa'pai, presented an alarming degree of linguistic variation from the variety the author grew up speaking in Abamang. Due to the large volume of recorded material, portions were transcribed from only 10 of the 40 interviews, then these transcriptions were entered into the computer, glossed and

analysed using the Shoebox program. Given that the speakers from Abamang represented little variation from the author's own speech, all 10 speakers chosen for further study were from Enemoroji'pai (3), Samawa'pai (2), and Wayawa'pai (5). The social category information for these 10 speakers is presented in Table 5.2.

During the process of analysis, 270 new Akawaio words presented themselves in the text data which were all unfamiliar to the researcher, herself a native speaker of Akawaio. Some of these also presented themselves during the interviews, prompting on the spot questions about what they meant. These were then recorded in a field notebook, in addition to capturing them on tape.
In November, 2001, the researcher made a second trip to Waramadong village for two weeks. The aim was to record more speech genres such as narratives and spontaneous conversations. Additionally, the task was to field test speaker familiarity with the 71 of the Akawaio words that the author had not recognized, and to elicit

236 Akawaio translations of 46 English sentences designed to highlight lexical, phonological and grammatical differences observed in the 1999 data. Fifteen Akawaio speakers were interviewed in 2001, of whom eight participated in the elicitation of the answers to the 46 English sentences. These eight were selected to represent a range of ages and distribution in the four sections of Waramadong, and four of the eight were not among the original 40 interviewees because these four had not been available during the first visit. Generally the methods for the collection of data both in 1999 and 2001 represented recorded spontaneous conversations (both on tape and as written notes in a field book) and recorded interviews with a questionnaire that combined translation tasks with questions
like 'Would you say.. ....?' or 'Who would say.. ....?'

The remainder of this chapter presents the actual observed variation in Akawaio speech patterns, and also how the variation correlates with neighbourhood of residence in Wararnadong. Section 5.5 presents an insider's description of the social networks of these Waramadong neighbourhoods. Section 5.5 concludes by suggesting that the notions of Speech Community and Community of Practice are useful for characterizing the patterns

237 of interaction in Waramadong that encourage the continued variation in Akawaio speech patterns.
The linguistic variation observed in the 1999 texts ran the gamut from phonology through lexicon to grammar. The translation task in the questionnaire was primarily designed to generate examples of phonological and grammatical variation, whereas the
questions about "Would you say.. .?I' and "Who would say ...?" were designed to elicit
speaker reaction to forms produced in all four sections of the village. Results to the
questions about "Who would say...?" and "Would you say...? ", actual examples
produced by the speakers, are divided into three sections, illustrating variation in pronunciation (section 5.1), vocabulary (section 5.2) and grammar (section 5.3).
5.1 Pronunciation Differences The differences in pronunciation divide into two categories: generalized patterns
and patterns found only with selected lexical items. Since one purpose of this study will be to identify which dialects are more conservative and which more innovative, and since variation can almost always be understood best as change in progress, Table 5.4 is offered, showing the table of Proto-Carib phonemes from Girard (1971):
Table 5.4 Proto-Carib Phoneme Inventory

238 Table 5.5 shows a table of the phones encountered in the author's own dialect of Akawaio, fi-om Abamang. As can be seen, Abamang Akawaio has greatly elaborated the inventory of consonants. The changes can be categorized in three major groups: palatalization, voicing, and debuccalization. Palatalization created J, tJ and JI; voicing created b, d, g, z, 3, and d3; debuccalization created ? and r~ (Gildea 2001). Makushi and Pemong dialects show both the palatalization and the debuccalization, but not the
voicing. In vowels, an apparently unconditioned split occurred in which many *o > a in
the Venezuelan branch of the Cariban family (Gildea 2001). In a more recent second split, a subset of *e > E and *o > 3.
Table 5.5 Inventory of Phones in Abamang Akawaio Table 5.6 shows the current orthography used for Abamang Akawaio, which conservatively indicates nearly all of the phonetic differences fiom Table 5.5. The examples throughout the rest of Section 2 use this orthography, rather than the P A , except in some cases where a particular phone is highlighted.

The distribution of these phones is complicated, and it is possible to have different

analyses of "underlying

some more abstract, some more closely identified with

surface form. The important allophonic patterns to note are (i) that [3] and [d3] are in fiee

variation, and hence are represented by the same orthographic symboly1, and (ii), that the actual pronunciation of the glottal stop may vary between a full glottal occlusiony gemination of a following voiceless obstruent, and omission (leaving only the otherwise anomalous intervocalic voiceless obstruent to indicate its presence). The orthography does not distinguish between these pronunciations, and it might even be argued that in more frequent lexical items, the glottal stop should no longer be indicated. No detailed analysis of Akawaio phonology has been published (although see Edwards 1978a-b)?and it is outside the scope of this paper? since the actual pronunciation is more relevant for understanding dialectal variation. The generalized patterns?discussed in section 5.1.1, are actually variations in how far the innovations in consonant inventory have progressed, one related to palatalization and manner, the other to voicing. The patterns linked to specific morphemes, discussed in section 5.1.2, are phonological innovations that only show up in certain words. In future research?it may be possible to find other examples of these sorts of changes?so these patterns may turn out to be more general as well.

- m; 5.1.1. Generalized patterns: [tN Intervocalic Post Sonorant Voicing
Across the lexicon and morphology of the four dialects, Wayawa'pai shows two differences when compared to the other three dialects: (i) where the other three show a voiceless postalveolar affricate [tfl, Wayawa'pai shows a voiceless postalveolar fhcative
[fl (1); (ii) where the other three show intervocalic voicing of all obstruents, Wayawa'pai shows no voicing (2).

It is impossible to determine whether [fl or [tfl is more innovative, since neither are attested (except as allophones) in either Makushi and Pembng. In the three dialects, [3] and [d3] are in free variation, like [tDl[fl, conditioned by proximity to lil. In Wayawa'pai, all three of these correspond to [fl, occasionally in fiee variation with [tfl. For the borrowing, it is clear that Wayawa'pai speakers changed the English [tfl to [fl.

Voiced obstruents are clearly innovative: most Carib languages don't have a voicing contrast for obstruents, and both Pembng and Makushi show the same lack of voicing that we see in Wayawa'pai. As is shown in section 3, Wayawa'pai speakers have extensive contact with Makushi speakers, so it is possible that the lack of voicing in Wayawa'pai is not conservative, but was borrowed back under the influence of their contact with Makushi speakers. But we would not expect this to be so consistent if it were just a property of borrowed words. The Samawa'pai and Enemoroji'pai speakers have a lot of contact with Pembng speakers, and their variety of Akawaio shows some inconsistency7usually voicing7but not always.

5.1.2 Patterns Linked to Specific Morphemes and Lexical Items Speakers from Wayawa'pai appear to be conservative in maintaining morpheme-
initial Iyl and word-internal unstressed /i,"l, whereas speakers from Enemorojifpai and Samawalpai only maintain them sometimes and they are consistently lost for speakers from Abamang.

5.2 Lexica1 Variation In reviewing the recorded texts, a number of lexical items were different beyond
both the regular and irregular sound changes listed in the previous sections. In some, the roots are completely different; in others, different pieces of morphology attached to the roots in derivational processes. It is a goal of fiture work to make as exhaustive a list as possible of words that vary between dialects, and then to compare this list with Makushi and Pemong dictionaries. Some borrowings are obvious, such as Samawa'pai pemongtong, which is exactly the Pemong word for 'people1,and taure mo, which is exactly how the Pemong say 'say it like that'. Some other good candidates for borrowings are the

One Samawa'pai speaker consistently used the term rawong in both narrative speech and conversation, but other Samawapai speakers did not confirm this as a feature of their way of speaking.

243 Samawa'pai words with intervocalic voiceless obstruents, like aka 'pick (fruits)', rokeng 'only' and misero 'this one', where we would expect voiced obstments like Abamang aga, rogeng, andpizer6

Table 5.7 Lexical variation between Abamang, Wayawa'pai and Samawa'pai

In 2001, responses were collected from the eight speakers (2 from each neighbourhood) to 71 of the 270 words from the 1999 trip that the author did not recognize. All eight of the speakers that were interviewed in 2001 were asked if they would use each of these 71 words. If they said no, they were asked if they had ever heard the word before, and if so, who they thought would use the word. The neighbourhoods

244 showed really different patterns, with Abamang alone using 34 of the words, Wayawa'pai alone using 6 of the words, and neither Enemoroji'pai nor Sarnawa'pai using any of the words alone (Table 5.7). This pattern suggests that Abamang and Wayawa'pai are the primary sources of innovation in Waramadong, and that each neighbourhood sustains their distinctive vocabulary without the need for support from the other neighbourhoods. It is not surprising that neither Enemoroji'pai nor Samawa'pai has unique vocabulary, since the two neighbourhoods seem to share most distinctive linguistic features.

Table 5.8 Vocabulary in only one neighborhood

When two neighbourhoods combined to share words that other neighbourhoods don't use, only four of the six possible combinations were attested: Enemoroji'pai and Samawa'pai combined for three words, then Abamang combined with each of the other

246 neighbourhoods for two words each (Table 5.9). While these numbers are very low, if the patterns hold over a larger sample, none of these results would be surprising: Enemoroji'pai and Samawa'pai share distinctive words, as if they were a single community, and each of the other dyads would be a word from Abamang that one member of a different neighbourhood has picked up due to Abamang's domination.

Table 5.9 Vocabulary used in only two neighborhoods

When three neighbourhoods combined to use a word, one neighbourhood gets excluded. Interestingly, Abamang is excluded the most (six times), with Wayawa'pai excluded four times and Samawa'pai excluded once (Table 5.10). The words that exclude Abamang are probably conservative, with Abamang now using innovative words for these same meanings. In Table 5.8, Abamang shows unique words as synonyms for five of the six words they don't share with the other three neighbourhoods. The parallel expectation would be for the four words that exclude Wayawa'pai to have synonyms in

247 the words exclusive to Wayawa'pai in Table 5.8, but only one shows such a synonym. These will need to be checked in future research. The one word that excludes Samawa'pai is an anomaly, and it also will be further checked in future research.

Table 5.1 1 Vocabulary used in all four neighbourhoods.

248 These findings indicate degree of variation between neighborhoods, including the lack of much variation between Enemoroji'pai and Samawa'pai, and they also show that Abamang is a major source of lexical innovationyat least for these 71 words.
5.3 Grammatical Variation The grammatical variation seen between different varieties of Akawaio is centred
around the two verbal inflectional systems. Following Gildea (1998), the grammar of Akawaio divides easily into two groupsySet I (modem reflexes of the Proto-Carib verbal inflectional system) and Set IIProgressive (modem reflexes of Proto-Carib nominalizations and derived adverbs that have been reanalysed as part of the new main clause inflectional system). Here we see one important area of variation in the Set I system, another in the Set I1 systemya third that occurs in both systems and a fourth that occurs with imperatives.
5.3.1 Set I '1Sa' > & '1Sa' in Abamang/Samawa'pa~Enemorojitpai
The Set I system consists of a specific set of personal prefixes that co-occur only with Set I TAM and number suffixes; other grammatical facts are summarized in Gildea (1998, ch. 5). Tables 12-13 give a brief inventory of both the Proto-Carib and Akawaio Set I personal prefixes, and Table 14 shows the Akawaio suffixes that uniquely co-occur with these prefixesy along with their Proto-Carib sources, where known (fiom Gildea 1998.80, modified per. Meira 2000a).

Table 5.14 Proto-Carib > Akawaio Set I Verbal Inflections

The Akawaio Set I system is greatly impoverished compared to the rich systems still encountered in languages like Kari'na (a.k.a. Carib, cf. Hoff 1968)? Hixkaryana (Derbyshire 1985) and Tiriy6 (Meira 1999). The Akawaio personal prefix system has lost the SA/So distinction, and the distinctive 1+2 personal prefixes have also disappeared, replaced by pronouns used in combination with the third person prefix nfi]-.

250 Also gone are the Proto-Carib Set I aspectual distinctions, further specification of distance in the past, and the future inflections (cf. Gildea 1998.96-103 for a summary of these distinctions in proto-Carib). For this paper, the primary interest is a consistent variation in the 1SAprefix: Wayawa'pai w-, Abamang/Enemoroji'pai 0-.(5) Wayawa'pai

5.3.2 Set I1 w- 'SA-' disappears in AbamangIEnemoroji'pai In Proto-Carib (and nearly all modem Cariban languages), nominalizations are
possessed by the notional absolutive of the nominalized verb, creating a series of possessive cum absolutive prefixes on nominalized verbs. Certain nominalizations could not be possessed, leading to a breakdown of the absolutive prefix pattern with those verb forms. The Split S system found in Set I person-marking also was marked in nominalized intransitive verbs, with a prefix *w- 'SAYthat occurred between the possessive prefix and the verb stem. In other Cariban languages, this prefix has the

25 1 following distribution (Meira 2000b: 204-207; Gildea 1994, 1998:89). It marks the subset

of intransitive verbs that are inherently SAor that are created by adding the detransitive

prefix to a transitive verb root. It only co-occurs with the following suffixes:

Action Nominalizer PatientlAction Nominalizer Patient Nominalizer Participle Nominalized Participle
Purpose of Motion

*-ri' > Ak. -0 *-tipi' > Ak. ->i+ *-sap0 > Ak. -zak/-sak *t-V-ce > Ak. t- V-ze/-se *t- V-ce-mi' > Ak. t- V-zeng/-seng
*-ce > Ak. -ik

'Present' 'Past' 'Perfect' 'Participle?' 'Absolutive Nominalization' 'Purpose of Motion'

Note that the first three of these suffixes now mark main clause verbal TAM distinctions in Akawaio. In all Akawaio dialects, the w- is preserved before consonantinitial intransitive roots when prefixed with one of 4 vowel-final possessivelabsolutive prefixes:

(6) 0-do-0 a-kdo-0 i-do-0

'I go' 'you go' 'it goes'

nya-kdo-0 a-ZJ-do-@-gong ti+-&do-0

'we go' 'y'all go' 'he(refl)goes9

Since the w- is lost in all other environments in Enemoroji'pai, Samawa'pai and Abamang Akawaio, it might be best to consider the u in these examples to be just part of allomorphy in the personal prefixes. However, the w- remains strong in many environments in Wayawa'pai Akawaio, including occurring on the verb between a full NP possessorlabsolutive and the verb:

5.3.3 Waywa'pai '30.1mperative1> AbamangJEnemoroji'pai&-
While it has not been reconstructed to proto-Carib, several other Cariban languages show the prefix i- '30' on consonant-initial verbs inflected in the imperative. Vowel-initial verbs usually are unmarked, which is often analysed as a prefix 0 - '30'. In Wayawa'pai, this same pattern of allomorphy is observed on at least one consonant-initial verb, whereas in the other 3 dialects, there is never a third person prefix in the imperative.

5.3.4 Doubling of - podi 'iterative' in Wayawa'pai
In two examples, one from text and the other from elicitation, speakers from Wayawa'pai doubled the derivational suffix -pod'i 'Iterative'. This suffix, like many other morphemes on the right edge of verbs, presents a reduced allomorph -PO' when it is followed by one from a certain set of inflectional suffixes (see Gildea 1995 for a

254 comparative treatment of syllable reduction in other Cariban languages), hence the doubled form is -pof-po' in front of -tai 'Past 2' (8) and -ang 'Present2' (9).

This concludes the presentation of the linguistic data. The distinctions between speakers from Wayawa'pai on the one hand, and E'nomorojipai, Samawa'pai and Abamang on the other, run through all domains of the language. The distinctions between Abamang on the one hand and Enemoroji'pai and Samawa'pai on the other are more limited, primarily seen in vocabulary and secondarily in phonological variation. No clear distinctions were observed between Enemoroji'pai and Samawa'pai. Section 3 presents the historical background to the settlement of the different sections of Wararnadong and the current social networks and group relationships within each section to help make sense of these patterns of variation.

3.4 Social tensions and language attitudes in Waramadong The two main sources of social tension in Waramadong as identified by this study
are both about inclusion in or exclusion from the dominant group: those who go to church (dominant) versus those who do not (stigmatised) and those who speak Kako-Akawaio (dominant) versus those who speak other dialects (stigmatised). These two issues are

255 closely intertwined, as the residents of Abamang are the main powers in the church and are also the speakers of Kako-Akawaio.
Recall that Abamang is also seen as the most educated section of Waramadong, that the various official institutions in Waramadong are all located in Abamang, and that the government functionaries are almost all residents of Abamang. Therefore, residents of Abamang boast about having political power, since (as stated by two speakers from Abamang), without their votes, Waramadong village elections cannot happen and it will cease to be a village. In particular, the Abamang Kako-Akawaio speakers are the leaders in the criticisms of the other groups, including their closest neighbours, the KukuiAkawaio speakers, for speaking " b a d Akawaio, and additionally of the Samawa'pai and Wayawa'pai residents for their non-Christian lifestyles. They frequently announce that all the other dialects spoken in the village are not "good Akawaio" but the language of 'those who are lost' idano 'maza 'kong or those that are leading the language astray. This is further substantiated by the response the researcher got whenever she was making a comparison of words or phrases from speakers in the other sections. For instance, when
- - the three variants awong yawong rawong 'inside (a contained space)' were cross-
checked with Abamang Kako-Akawaio speakers, they dismissed the Wayawa'pai version, yawong, and the Samawa'pai version, rawong, with an agitated ha---ng! ( expression of disgust) maing benno ning m&o 'that is not a language 1word!'
Inside Abamang, the Kukui-Akawaio speakers speak their own dialect only with each other, making the small shift to Kako-Akawaio when speaking with other members of the village. This makes them insiders in the dominant group.

256 The residents of Samawa'pai and Enemoroji'pai maintain their Pembng-Akawaio dialect despite pressure to conform to the Kako-Akawaio norms. Although there is tension between the two communities over the issue of religion and lifestyle, as described above, Enemoroji'pai and Samawa'pai have many closely knit relationships between them. This could be represented as Milroy and Milroy's 'dense networks.' Where there are dense networks, there is strength in interpersonal bonds and community pressure, and members of such networks maintain a distinctive form of speech even when it is severely stigrnatised by the society as a whole. Recall that the 'foreign' components of PembngAkawaio are also reinforced by the visits that residents of these two neighbourhoods make to their extended families in Venezuela. The residents at Enemoroji'pai make it clear that they speak a hybrid language consisting of elements of Kamarakoto (Pembng) and Akawaio, but they seem to be fluent in the Kako-Akawaio and the Kukui-Akawaio dialects as well. However, they care about the influence of these other dialects on their language, and they are not always happy about the way Akawaio is being spoken in Waramadong. They claim that their children are now confused about what is the correct way to speak Akawaio, which is further confused by the struggle to speak the English language, which all Akawaio children now study in school. The Samawa'pai residents feel good about speaking Pembng-Akawaio but they feel that they are superior to their close neighbours at Enemoroji'pai because they can speak English and they have money. However, the residents of Enemoroji'pai see both qualities as defining peoples who are deviants to the true Akawaio culture. Because the residents of Samawa'pai are more proud of being able to make money and speak English, they are accused of not caring enough about how their children speak. It

could be argued that they care more about their economic livelihoods, and are thus more open to collectively solving problems by presenting them to the village council. In fact, they are open to joining with not just Enemoroji'pai, but the rest of the village, to participate in village-planned self-help activities at Waramadong.
The greatest tension in the village is between the sections of Abamang and Wayawa'pai. From observations and conversations, there is not much inter-marrying between persons in Abamang and Wayawa'pai, while intermarriage is the norm between residents of Abamang and Enemoroji'pai and Samawa'pai. The reasons given were that the people at Wayawa'pai are backward and speak a backward language, they are not educated, they are not Christians, they eat and drink outlawed meat and traditional alcoholic drinks, they are dangerous bad ritual blowers and Kanaimos (shamanic Amerindian killers or a killer cult), and they have family ties to Makushis who are considered the worst Kanaimos by most Akawaios.
This group is aware that they are not appreciated because they referred to as 'backward strangers' who speak a strange language. Some of the speakers interviewed claimed that they were not always included in village activities because they are not Adventist and because they are 'dangerous strangers.' This was repeated to the researcher when she went to interview an elderly woman at Wayawa'pai. She was asked (in Akawaio), 'Why do you want to record me, I do not speak good Akawaio', Go and talk to those sebindeyamok (Seventh-Day-Adventist) who walk around with their paipiX (Bible). She was referring here directly to the residents of Abamang. The elder woman angrily continued and said that there were attempts by the Seventh-Day-Adventist to convert her and her family but has consistently resisted it. She claimed that this was

258 because she did not want to be associated with such self-righteous people who at the same time were the worst hypocrites. She continued and explained that she and her family did not come to Waramadong of their own free will but that they were brought to Waramadong by the now deceased father of the present village captain Joseph Isaacs, but now even the present captain was reportedly making statements about sending them back to where they belong. It was observed that statements of the kind the elderly woman described continue to create hostility between the residents of Wayawa'pai and Abamang in particular.
In fact, Wayawa'pai is the main location in the village for parties where alcoholic drinks are served. These parties are referred to by the Abamang church-goers as 'drinking sprees', and are severely criticized.
Language attitudes are almost a perfect reflection of the rest of the social attitudes. It is not surprising that we find the greatest contrast in Akawaio language variation between the Kwating-Akawaio spoken in Wayawa'pai and the dialects spoken in the rest of Waramadong. There is much greater lexical variation, and also strong grammatical differences. It may be that the Kwating-Akawaio variation is due to influences from Patamuna and Makushi, since Kwating people have been intermarrying with Patamuna and Makushi people - for example, the eldest daughter of one of Joji's wives was married to a Patamuna and the last two daughters of another wife were both married to Makushi husbands. However, there is need for more comparative work on Makushi and Patamuna (which has never been described at all) before we can conclude that Kwating-Akawaio is indeed different because of Makushi and Patamuna language influences. It is also possible that some aspects of Kwating-Akawaio are conservative,

259 and that Kako-Akawaio represents the more changed dialect, whether due to contact or to natural historical changes. For example, some of the phonological changes in KakoAkawaio are clearly more innovative than the phonological changes in KwatingAkawaio, but it is not clear whether Kwating-Akawaio conserves the older forms, or whether it borrowed back the older forms from contact with Makushi and Patamuna.
Regarding strength of dialects, Kako-Akawaio is the most predominant one within Waramadong, and it is only seriously challenged by the speakers of KwatingAkawaio in Wayawa'pai. In fact, the population of the Kwating-Akawaio speakers is much older than that of the Kako-Akawaio speakers, and the elders are very influential in raising the children, constantly reinforcing the home language of Kwating-Akawaio and never using either English or other varieties of Akawaio. Thus, Kwating-Akawaio continues to be passed on to the younger generations in Wayawa'pai.
We see here an example of the social dynamic described by Milroy and Milroy (1992), where internal dense social networks help maintain a stigmatized dialect against a hostile majority: residents of Wayawa'pai realize that they are defined as strangers by the rest of Waramadong, particularly Abamang, they are not Christians and do not wish to be converted, and they therefore continue to express themselves in their language, even though it, too, is constantly criticized (as a bad version of the Akawaio language). Nonetheless, a final observation that is interesting has to do with listening to a KwatingAkawaio speak, when it is realized that some speakers include components of the KakoAkawaio lexical items such as ene, ji, aga, ne'tai in free variation with the equivalents in their dialect such as eshi, ere'ma, yaka, and niwe'tai. So even though the group as a

260 whole resists Abamang and Kako-Akawaio norms, some individuals show variation that suggests movement in the direction of Kako-Akawaio.
5.4 Discussion: Social Networks Observed in Waramadong Communities The linguistic data analysis divides the Akawaio speakers of Waramadong into
three major categories, whereas in the residents' own perceptions of the village, they divide themselves into four major categories (refer to 2.3.2 and 2.3.3). These different conclusions can be reconciled with reference to established notions in sociolinguistics and ethnolinguistics: Speech Communities and Communities of Practice (see Figure 5.2).
The notion of Speech Community has been established since at least Bloomfield (1933.42) as a group of people who interact on a daily basis by means of a common speech, agreeing on what is considered proper and improper usage of the language. Hymes (1974.51) adds that members of a speech community share knowledge of rules governing the conduct and interpretation of speech. This sharing comprises knowledge of at least one form of speech with its patterns of use. But for Hyrnes, sharing grammatical knowledge of the form speech might take is not sufficient. In addition, a person who is a member of a speech community will know appropriate usage -what to say in particular situations.
Labov (1972.158, 248) sought to emphasize the social and evaluative norms shared by members of a speech community. Thus, he argued that a speech community should not be conceived as a group of speakers who all use the same languageforms, but would be better defined as a group who share the same norms with regard to a language,

26 1 and who share a set of social attitudes towards it. The norms Labov refers to here are the ways in which members of the community evaluate their own and other people's speech.
Beyond these criteria for identifying Speech Communities, the work of Lesley and James Milroy (1992) coins the concept of social network, which relates to the community and interpersonal level of social organisation. In this instance, close-knit networks, where members share geographic location, family ties, and work places, tend to exert strong pressures for maintaining group norms. These social networks are held together by consensus from social class, which is based on conflict, division and inequality. Therefore, linguistic variation of pronunciations and grammatical forms occurs between classes, whereas linguistic conformity tends to obtain within social networks.
Milroy and Milroy, following this trend of thought, came up with the notion of 'Speech network' to focus on people who have contact with each other on a regular basis. The frequency of these interactions, and thus the strength of these associations varied. They conceived of two types of speech networks: dense networks and weak networks. People in a dense network situation tend to have daily or frequent contact and are linked by more than one type of bond (i.e., they may be related, they may live in the same neighbourhood, they may work together and they may all know each other). Dense networks exert pressure on members to conform to the values that are shared, and because of this, individuals' behaviors could be easily detected and noted. Because linguistic behavior is one type of behavior that is often monitored and regulated within a dense network situation, members tend to maintain speech norms with very little variation. In contrast, people in weak networks tend to have less regular contact and do

262 not know all of their daily associates, therefore they do not share values as consistently. Weak networks do not have the mechanisms to enforce conformity on an individual basis, in spite of the societal exertion for conformity through the transmission of cultural values on both conscious and unconscious levels (see also Bonvillian 2000:3). The concept of social network and speech network is useful, since it focuses on actual speakers and explains the mechanisms for control that unify the establishment and maintenance of group norms in small-scale daily interactions (ibid).
Hymes (1974.45) argued that speech community was necessary and primary unit of description as a social rather than a linguistic entity. For Hymes, one starts with a social group and considers the entire organisation of linguistic means within that social group, rather than beginning with some partial, named organisation of linguistic means called language. This is vital because the term "language" can cany with it a confusion of several notions and attributes that have to be sorted out. Without such considerations, there could be a confusion between the notions of speech community and language. In fact, Bloomfield (1933) and Chomsky (1965) appear to equate the two. Thus, field workers attempting to describe "exotic languages" often appear to believe that they are capturing a "speech community" in their descriptions.
This resulted in the notion of speech community becoming redundant, and thus playing no part in research beyond honoring its definitional foundations. When speech community is defined in terms of language alone, it is inadequate since it does not include the boundaries, both within and around communities. For externally, the linguistic and communicative boundaries between communities cannot be defined only in terms of linguistic features (Hymes 19680). For instance, forms of speech of the same

263 degree of linguistic difference can be seen as dialects of the same language in one place and simultaneously as distinct languages in another, depending largely on the political and not the linguistic history of the region. When considering the internal bounding of a community it is generally assumed that a natural unity exists among members of a community based solely on identity or commonality of linguistic knowledge. But this is not so since no real community can be defined by mechanical replication of uniformity. Bloomfield and others following him suggested that the quantitative measure of frequency of interaction should instead be the basis for defining a community.
For the purposes of this paper one would like to extrapolate from the foregoing definitions and, drawing on Labov 1966, Hyrnes 1972, Eckert 1999 and Wolfram and Schilling-Estes 1999, choose to define speech community as follows:
A single speech community is one where a group of people interact daily by the use of a common speech. It is a common social unit that is the core for explaining the interpretation of contextual, social and shared meanings of language variation. In addition, the social unit is the foundation for constructing social meanings. A speech community is also a situation where a group of people are geographically distributed to give way to no break in intelligibility from one place to another.
Applying these concepts to the situation in Wararnadong, we find that the densest social networks observed are internal to each of the four communities. The ties that lead to the densest networks include shared extended family, shared farming plots and huntinglfishing grounds, and shared non-sustenance activities (church, social gatherings, community work parties). While the densest networks always appear inside each

264 neighbourhood, reasonably dense social networks are also found between Enemoroji'pai and Samawa'pai, a finding that makes sense of the conclusion that the two together share a single dialect of Akawaio (see Chapter 4).
Enemoroji'pai and Samawa'pai As described above, both Enemoroji'pai and Samawa'pai residents have Pem6ng ancestry, differing mainly in which groups of Akawaios intermarried with their Pem6ng ancestors, and which groups have provided additional immigrants since then. The two neighbourhoods are related to each other through marriage, they live closer to each other than to the other neighbourhoods, they all know each other and frequently work together to cultivate new farms, build new homes and build boats. The constant daily interaction forms many dense networks (in the sense of Milroy and Milroy) between the members of the two neighbourhoods.
Despite these many links, Enemoroji'pai and Samawa'pai are also different in several ways. For instance, they own farms in two different areas and cultivate these separately, and they go to different hunting grounds for regular hunting trips. Enemoroji'pai residents are purely traditional farmers and cultivate the cassava and other ground provisions such as dasheen, eddoes, yams and sweet potatoes. They own several farms which are located at Warimabia near the foot hills of the Pipitobu mountain and surrounding areas. They are also hunters and fishermen and choose to only hunt in the Ekereku area where there is lots of game. This area the Enemoroji'pai families claim were the traditional grounds of some of their ancestors, hence they have claims over it. In contrast, the farms of the Samawa'pai residents are located in selected areas such as

265 kono'obia, Ekereng and Mirawogo, locations which were the original farmlands of their ancestors. These farmlands are located inland about forty miles from the Kamarang river, down river from Waramadong on the right bank. They hunt in Ekereng and Mirawogo, and fish in ponds and small tributaries of the Kamarang around mirawogo. Both groups might band together to hunt bigger game for village celebrations, usually around Ekereku.
A major difference between the two neighbourhoods is that residents of Samawa'pai are also cash crop farmers, cultivating cash crops such as peanuts, onions and a variety of beans, which they sell to the miner shops at Kamarang, the centre of administration for the Upper Mazaruni District. In addition, one family at Samawa'pai makes extra money by baking and selling home-made wheat bread and coconut buns for sale to the rest of Waramadong. This cash crop enterprise has taught them shared ways of doing things, such as learning collectively modem techniques for cultivating cash crops (as taught to them by the government-appointed agricultural field officer), working out logistics for harvesting and transporting produce from Waramadong to Kamarang for sale, and balancing accounts. This they maintain in order to earn cash to buy other needed things such as outboard motors, a variety of farm tools and food such as the flour, sugar, salt and butter to sustain the bread-making venture. The English language is useful (even essential) for them, since they have constant contact with the buyers of their produce, who are non-Amerindians. These practices help to hold the Samawa'pai community together, at the same time that they distinguish it from all three of the other neighbourhoods in Waramadong. Both Enemoroji'pai and Samawa'pai residents occasionally sell extra fish and game in other neighbourhoods of Waramadong.

266 The greater economic activity in Samawa'pai gives Samawa'pai residents greater mobility: they travel to and fro from Waramadong to Kamarang by using an outboard engine, and walk from Waramadong to Venezuela. There are certain times during the year, such as the summer and Christmas seasons, when they are completely gone. They are only in one place to plant and harvest their farms, then get some money to travel again. Residents of Enemoroji'pai are more stable, although they also travel frequently to visit relatives. In fact, it was noted that most of the families living at Enemoroji'pai have children and other relatives living in Venezuela. One family has four daughters attending school in Caracas. Also, a major social/religious difference separates Enemoroji'pai from Samawa'pai. Most residents of Enemoroji'pai are Seventh Day Adventists, therefore they return from their farms on week-ends to attend church services on Saturday and do not participate in drinking parties. Samawa'pai residents are not Seventh-day Adventists and do not attend the village church even when they are invited. They separate themselves from time to time to have drinking sprees, which are not popular with residents of Enemoroji'pai and Abamang, who believe that these sprees encourage young people to drink and behave badly. Despite their differences, residents of Enemoroji'pai and Samawa'pai tend to present their community issues collectively to the village council. They do not care who is the chief at Wararnadong but would like someone from either Enemoroji'pai or Samawa'pai to be represented on the Village Council. They compete at sports as a united front and many times they ask for each other's assistance to cultivate their farms or build their houses. Due to marriage obligations, residents of both Enemoroji'pai and

267
Samawa'pai have to visit each other frequently and help each other in this way. hi
addition, working together for the common good of the community is not so hard in the Enemoroji'pai and Samawa'pai community because they are so linked to each other by marriage. Despite the close connections, residents of each section like to see themselves as being different from the other.
Enemoroji'pai and Samawa'pai residents recognize that their language is different from what is spoken in the rest of Waramadong but they are not willing to change it to suit any other form. The Pemong-Akawaio is passed on to their kids and because they travel frequently to Venezuela to visit relatives, there is continuity in this speech form. None of the elderly people from Enemoroji'pai can speak English and this could be a main reason why PemongIAkawaio will continue to thrive. Enemoroji'pai has a population that is much older as compared to residents at Samawa'pai, and this may be why there are strong sentiments about being the proud, mixed descendants of Pemong and Akawaio. Their claims extend to the idea that their ancestors settled Waramadong first. Of course, this is yet to be substantiated. Enemoroji'pai residents claimed that they do not wish to align themselves with speakers of the other Akawaio dialects although they can also speak these dialects when necessary.
Although Samawa'pai residents participate in the same way of life as the Enemoroji'pai residents, communicating through the same Pem6ng-Akawaio language and having shared values and attitudes towards it, we find that Samawa'pai residents are not so homogeneous a group: in addition to the Pemong-Akawaio speakers there are also migrants who came from Bartica 1 Potaro who claim to speak Patamuna/Akawaio, and many residents of Samawa'pai speak English Creole as a part of their economic activity,

268 and thus they feel superior to Enemoroji'pai residents, who are not English speakers. Therefore, in this way, Samawa'pai speakers engage in a variety of speech communities.
Abamang In Abamang the situation is different. While everyone occupies the same
geographical space, there are two different groups of speakers identified as the KakoAkawaio and the Kukui-Akawaio speakers. The Kako-Akawaio speakers are greater in number, therefore, the Kukui-Akawaio speakers - who are actually just a few families - are forced to communicate via Kako-Akawaio. This is easy for them since the two dialects are mostly similar. The two groups work together to cultivate farms, build houses and boats and assist in other self-help activities in the village, and they have the same basic life style. Given that both sectors speak the same language, live in the same geographical area, are related by marriage and hold similar values and attitudes toward their language, we can conclude that Abamang represents the second 'speech community7 at Waramadong.
Both the Kukui-Akawaio and the Kako-Akawaio speakers at Abamang are traditional farmers and so they cultivate cassava roots and other ground provisions. The men are craftsmen, hunters and fishermen. However, the sites where they cultivate their farms are located in two different areas. The Kako-Akawaio speakers predominate farmlands in the surrounding rainforest areas located about eight to twenty five miles away from Wararnadong, and also farmlands located two to twenty miles down river, in inland areas on the left and right banks of the Kamarang river. Like the Enemoroji'pai and Samawa'pai group, some of the farms of the Kako-Akawaio speakers are located in

269 areas where their ancestors farmed, such as Wayabidoi, Kwaibaru and Kaigujidoi. The farmlands of the Kukui-Akawaio speakers are located away from the village, also in areas where their ancestors farmed, including Sukabi, Warimabia and Kuzera7toi.
The hunting and fishing grounds of the Kako-Akawaio and Kukui-Akawaio speakers are very different from each other: Kako-Akawaio speakers go seasonally to fish in an area called 'Kako Head' which is located up the Kako river, a tributary of the Mazamni river. This area is clearly chosen because of ancestral rights and because they know the terrain well enough to know what type of game are plentiful during which seasons. They also travel to Membaru, a traditional fishing and hunting grounds. They hunt for big game such as deer and bush cow (tapir) in this area. The Kukui-Akawaio speakers have their fishing and hunting grounds located at Wenamu Head, an area also noted for its richness in gold. Sometimes they travel to the Kukui area when seasonally invited to go hunting and fishing with their relatives who still live there.
In addition to attending to traditional chores, a few of the men and women in Abamang are also wage earners. All of the main institutions are located in Abamang and this is probably why several residents in this area are offered the few jobs in these institutions. Residents of Abamang are employed as teachers: five at the Secondary School and three more at the Primary School, including the Headmistress. The carpenters, secretary and security guards at the secondary school come from Abamang. The present village chief and many of his councillors are from Abamang. In addition, the agricultural field officer, the health worker, and the elders of the church all hail from Abamang. There is also a general store in the centre of Abamang, which buys foodstuff from various people in Abamang and which sells imported foodstuffs and dry goods

270 (usually brought in by boat from Kamarang, site of the nearest active airstrip and numerous miner shops). If there is smoked meat or fish for sale in the village, it would be sold here.
Conversations with the village chief and with the head teachers at the primary and secondary schools revealed that more children from Abamang attend the schools. They also reported that more young people from this section were either studying in Georgetown on government scholarship or had finished their schooling and held important jobs in Georgetown. In addition, there was a big deal made about the researcher herself, who is studying in the United States, because she is from Abamang. It is no wonder that Abamang is labelled by the other sections as the most educated part of the village.
While the two Abamang groups see themselves as speaking a distinct type of Akawaio, this is no obstacle to the family ties which they have developed through marriage. They are easily unified when they have to make important decisions. Thus, while they define themselves as two distinct groups, this division is only reflective of the different speech forms and the attitudes they both have towards the total assimilation of their language by each other's group. The Kako-Akawaio speakers are particularly paranoid about this, hence the constant pressure on the other groups to speak their brand of Akawaio. The Kukui-Akawaio speakers use their dialect to communicate with their immediate group only since they are often forced to communicate to the Kako-Akawaio speakers by way of the Kako-Akawaio dialect. This explains the pattern observed in Chapter 4, that Kukui-Akawaio speakers are more likely to speak the Kako-Akawaio dialect as opposed to the Kako-Akawaio speakers, who never speak Kukui-Akawaio.

Wayawa'pai The Akawaios at Wayawa'pai are also traditional subsistence farmers and they
cultivate a variety of crops such as sugar cane, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, corn, bananas and plantains and yams, in addition to bitter cassava. They also grow tangerines and coconuts in the surrounding soils near their homes at Wayawa'pai. The farming sites of the Wayawa'pai are located in areas away from the village, in sites that were cultivated by their earlier relatives, such as Kamibaru'pai, Kanau Atiinzek, and Parana'pai, are all located down river from Waramadong, on the left and right banks of the Kamarang river. They also farm on lands surrounding the road from Waramadong to Kamarang. Their hunting grounds are near the Waramadong mountains, areas surrounding the Waramadong to Kako road and chose to go back to AtaroIKwating at least twice a year to hunt for big game.
One family in Wayawa'pai runs a small shop that sells things like flour, sugar, soda, cigarettes, and some clothing. People from Wayawa'pai often walk through Waramadong selling excess fish or game to whoever will buy.
Residents of Wayawa'pai cultivate lots of sugar-cane, which they use to make the traditional drink chigaru eugu and to sweeten their local beers kajiri, sak eugu and pawaru. All of these drinks, when deliberately left to ferment, become alcoholic and are served at drinking sprees. Drinking sprees can materialize during family visits, birthday parties and after the clearing and harvesting of crops from the farm. These days football victories, birthdays, wedding anniversaries and Christmas holidays can spur drinking

272 sprees. Since Wayawa'pai residents are fond of hosting drinking parties, it is the popular centre for these activities.
Generally, Wayawa'pai residents are unified and present themselves in this way. Also since most families are related to each other, they live the same mode of life holding on to the same values. None of the Wayawa'pai residents belong to the Seventh-DayAdventist church, which leads to some tension with residents of the more religious neighbourhoods, Enemoroji'pai and Abamang (more on this soon). Because their children attend the Primary and Secondary school, they are sometimes forced to attend the parentlteacher meetings but will seldom participate too much in village decisions. They keep the peace by adhering to whatever is expected of them as villagers of Waramadong, outside of being converted. When they don't want to participate they stay out of sight.
Therefore we find that most of the Kwating-Akawaio speakers are related to each other and so they know each other, because they also interact with each other on a daily basis. They communicate to each other only through Kwating-Akawaio and like to define themselves as being different from the rest of Waramadong. They are settled in the same geographical area to make sure that a common speech is sustained.
So the village of Waramadong clearly consists of not one single Speech Community, but three: those who speak Pemong-Akawaio, Kako-Akawaio and KwatingAkawaio. Two of these three speech communities overlap perfectly with neighbourhoods in Waramadong, Kako-Akawaio with Abamang and Kwating-Akawaio with Wayawa'pai. However, the third speech community, Pemong-Akawaio, overlaps with two distinct

273 neighbourhoods, Enemoroji'pai and Samawa'pai. As such, a different concept is necessary to capture the difference between these two communities.
In contrast to speech communities, the concept of Communities of Practice refers to a situation where there is a further division of a speech community into personal communities that will provide speakers with meaningful frameworks for solving the problems of their day to day existence. In this situation, people tend to concentrate on their social and linguistic activity. Individuals may engage in a variety of activities, each characterized by its own group of people who participate, and perhaps also by different means of communication. The term communities of practice captures these groups, since it refers to an aggregate of people who come together around some form of enterprise where they can develop shared ways of doing things, ways of speaking, and beliefs and values, which are referred to collectively as 'practices'(Lave 1991 & Wenger 1998 as cited in Eckert 1999: 35). This gives the idea that communities of practice tend to define smaller pockets of personal speech communities that exist within a larger single speech community. Clearly this is the case of the Samawa'pai inside the Pem6ng-Akawaio speech community: they engage in the cash crop economy, they travel more widely than any of the other groups, and they speak English Creole in both of these activities.
The final question to resolve is the status of the Kukui-Akawaio speakers in Abarnang. Clearly they do not form a distinct speech community, as they are in such a great minority and so they conform generally to the Kako-Akawaio speech norms. Nor do they engage in any distinctive separate activities, and as such, they do not qualify as a distinct community of practice. In fact, Kukui-Akawaio speakers and Kako-Akawaio speakers are virtually indistinguishable today: they speak the same language, live in the

274 same geographical area, are related by marriage and hold similar social values and attitudes towards language. Kukui-Akawaio is thus a submerged subset of Abamang, historically distinctive but on the verge of total assimilation. These conclusions are represented graphically in Figure 5.1.

Kako-Akawaio
Kw ating-Akaw aio Figure 5.1 Speech Communities of Akawaio

As we have seen, in Waramadong alone (with a population of 950 people) we have three distinct speech communities and another community of practice. Yet the only mention of this in the previous literature on Akawaio is a passing reference in Adam 1905 (presumably quoting Brett): "The dialects of this language vary considerably, owing to the vast territory over which it is spoken." While linguists will say that phrases like "of course every language has dialects", the results of formal study of the languages do not give any sense of the actual variation that can be encountered. This lack of information can have real consequences for the communities who speak such languages. For example, politicians have arbitrarily divided Amerindian reservations in Guyana into tribal groupings on the basis of the claim that they speak the "same language", even though no scientific study exists to validate these claims. Many of these same politicians refer to Amerindian languages as "dialects", saying that they are not real languages, with sophisticated grammar like English. And the same linguists who would certainly defend the Amerindian languages from such attacks still do not offer them the same recognition and respect as more established languages, in the sense that their work does not really acknowledge and value the variation that exists.
This study provides a small step in the right direction, in hopes of beginning to rectify the arbitrary way in which Amerindian communities have been and are classified. It is an effort to life the present confusion and mystery, recognizing both their oral and written history as an integral part of the task of describing their languages. As a final note, consider the fact that this study comes out of only one Akawaio community -there are another 6 in the Upper Mazaruni, plus one more in Mabura Great Falls, plus the

277 various Patamuna communities elsewhere in Guyana and the Ingariko communities in Brazil that purportedly speak the "same language", plus the many Pemong and Makushi communities that purportedly speak mutually intelligible varietiesllanguages. An important task for future research will be a survey of linguistic variation throughout the dialect chain(s) in Guyana, eastern Venezuela and northern Brazil. Hopefully, this survey will be informed by the importance of understanding the dynamics of social conflicts, relationships and group solidarity that arise from people's social and linguistic self-definitions.
