PRONOMINAL REFERENCE IN PARINTINTIN
In an attempt to understand the Parintintin pronominal reference system the following observations were made regarding identification, backgrouud, return to previous participant, lexical tie, semantical/logical conclusion, culture, and the pronoun itself.

Identification
Identification of some participants is made by insertion of "the one who" kiroki'ga followed by a declarative verb.
kirokihẽa, etc.

This pronominal form is always subject of the phrase in which it finds itself.

ex: DB 73

Aerẽ

po ki-'ga, kiroki-'ga nd-o-gweroviar-i-hu, "Ji

Afterwards indef that-he, the=one=who-he not-3rd-believe-not-big, "I

nd-a-roho-i te yhyga," e po1 ahe, avujipava.
not-1st-take-not really torch," say indef person, now=dead=one.
Afterwards that one, the one who did not believe [said] "I definitely am not taking a
torch," said the one now dead.

ex: DB 203
Oro ve po ae-'ga kiroki-'ga o-mondo Aruimbe-'ga pe, oro
And yet indef that-he, the=one=who-he 3rd-give Aruimbe-he to, and
ve po ga, "Avo t-õ-i."
yet indef he, "Here clmh-sit-cm." This man, that man who gave to Aruimbe, this man (said), "Here it sits."

Sometimes a clause following another referring to a certain person gives an explanation of who that certain person is. The ahe in DB 135 is identified in the expression kiroki ahe … in 136.

ex: DB 135

Kiroki-'ga

o-mbote ka'gwyra ahe

ve.

The=one=who-he 3rd-change jungle

dead one for.

ex: DB 136

Kiroki

ahe o-pyta a'ero.

The=one=who person 3rd-stay then.

That man who changed the jungle for the dead one… that dead one who stayed then.

The ahe in DB 163 is identified in a quote addressed to him in 164.

ex: DB 163

Oro po

ga n-o-nhi'ig-i ahe

ve, kiroki-'ga a.

And indefinite he not-3rd-speak-not dead one to, the=one=who-he actually.

2

ex: DB 164

"A'i nde h-a'o-uhua nde ere-r-u." e po

ga.

"Because you clmh-meat-big you 2nd-con-come," say indefinite he.

And he, actually that man, did not talk to the one now dead, "because you brought meat

(to me)," he said.

Background
Background clauses refer to incidents yet to occur in the text and give a highlight to the discourse by the very fact of referring to these ahead of time thus drawing the listener's interest as to what will happen:

ex: DB 135-136 (above) carried out in

ex: DB 227

"Aruimbe-'ga po gwereko ga naerõ."

"Aruimbe-he indef took

him then."

"Aruimbe took him then."

thus identifying the kiroki'ga of 135, i.e., Aruimbe, who turned everything into jungle for him.

Return to Previous Participant
After a sideline a participant is pulled back into the narration by means of placing it first and then making comments about it or having it make comments.

ex: CK-17
Oro ga, "Gã n-i-nhyro-gatu-i," ei ga heikwehe'i.
And he, "They not-clmi-tame-well-not," say he the other day. And he (said), "They are not very well tamed," he said the other day.

And he pulls one of the main participants who has not been mentioned for a while back into the narration after a sideline conversation had taken place.

ex: GX 6

Oro ga, avo nhimbiari pe ga ma'ema'ẽi.

And they, here port

in they awakened.

And they, here in the port, they awakened.

And they bring the sleeping children previously mentioned back into the narrative.

ex: ID 26

Oro hẽa, "A-'apti-pa ti inamutiga a'ero nehẽ,"

And she, "1st-kill-all

future chickens

than intent,"

And she (said), "I will kill all the chickens then," she said.

ei hẽa.
say she.

This she had been previously mentioned in the narrative.

3

Also, to refer back to a participant ki'ga

and ae'ga

hẽa, etc.

hẽa, etc.

can be used. For examples of this see DB 73 and 203 under Identification.

Lexical Ties
Pronouns are identified as referring to a noun or being the same as a preceding or following pronoun by means of lexical ties.

ex: CK 1, 2

Aerẽ

po ga ho-i ga ndepiag-a raikwehe'i.

Afterwards indef he go-cm them see-cm

the other day.

"Tapy'yitiga hoi ga ndepiag-a apoa

rupi,

"Brazilian

go them see-cm

whatchamacallit through,

Ambasonhia rupi," e ko

ga.

Amazoninha through," say definite he.

Afterwards he went to see them the other day. "A Brazilian, went to see them by means

of whatchamacallit, by means of Amazoninha," he said.

The he of the first utterance is identified as a member of the class tapy'yitiga , Brazilians, mentioned in the second utterance through the lexical tie ga ndepiag-a, them see-cm, of both utterances.
Semantical/Logical Conclusion Replies to questions or conversations in text give the identity of the pronouns as does
logical progression.
ex: CK 7, 8
"Pero pe nduvi?" ei ga.
"There you live?" say he. "Is that where you live?" he said.

"Agwa ore ruvi," ei ga heikwehe..."
"Here we live," say they the other day..." "This is where we live," they said the other day..."
The logical conclusion that the one answering the question is the one to whom it was addressed.

ex: HI 1, 2, 3 and 6

Kiro po ti ga j-apo-i

jiki'ia, Jire-'ga

Now indef future he clmi-make-cm trap,

Jiré-he.

Now he will make a trap, Peter.

4

Koi ga o-ho h-er-u-a

yhypoa heaji'i.

? he 3rd-go clmh-con-come-cm vine the other day.

He went to bring vine the other day.

Po ti ga kiro gw -ekihỹ

nehẽ.

Indef future he now clmh-block off intent.

He will now block it off.

Oro po ti ga h-ova-pytym-i ypytun-imo nehẽ.

And indef future he clmh-face-shut-cm dark-at

intent.

And he will shut the door at night.

This is an example of logical progression wherein the first man, Peter, is subsequently the he throughout the following verses.

Culture
Some pronouns not identified in a narrative prove to be in certain relationships with the narrator.

ex: CK 2

"Tapy'yitiga hoi ga ndepiag-a apoa

rupi,

"Brazilian

go them see-cm

whatchamacallit through,

Ambasonhia rupi," e ko

ga.

Amazoninha through," say definite he.

"A Brazilian went to see them by means of whatchamacallit, by means of

Amazoninha," he said.

The one speaking is the husband of the narrator and therefore, not mentioned by name.

ex: GY 5

Oro ga i-kyty-tehe-i

agw amo

And he clmi-scrape-in=vain-cm today

And he scraped the pulp in vain today.

ipyra.
pulp.

The one scraping the pulp is the husband of the narrator and therefore not mentioned by name.

Pronoun Itself The use of the first person plural inclusive and exclusive makes clear who is involved.

ex. GX

1. Oro ko

ore ho-i xave-'ga r-apyi

pe oji'i.

And definite we go-cm old-he

clmh-house to the other day.

We went to the old man's house the other day.

5

2. Oro ko

ka'aru hete ore jivyr-i oro-jo-a oji'i.

And definite later

really we return-cm 1st-come-cm other day.

After dark we returned the other day.

3. Oro ore r-ur-i

ya r-upi.

And we clmh-come-cm water clmh-through.

We came by water.

4. Oro t-a'yr-i-'ga

h-ova-vu-vavu

And clmh-child-little-they clmh-face-elevate-redup

reki up-a
finally be-cm

huruta-hu-a'ja o-ki-a

yhara r-embe'yva

r-ehe.

owl-big-similar

3rd-sleep-cm canoe clmh-edge

clmh-on.

The little children turned their faces up finally, like "mãe da lua" owls, sleeping on the

edge of the canoe.

5. "Oro kiro ti nhande i-mbo-ji-kog-i

nehẽ."

"And now future we

clmi-caus-reflexive-lean-cm intent."

"Now we're going to dock."

6. Oro ga avo nhimbiari pe ga ma'e-ma'ẽ-i.

And they here port

in they awaken-redup-cm.

And they, here in the port, they each awakened.

7. Eki ga h-opehyj-ahi. But they clmh-sleepy-intense But they were very sleepy.

In the narrative above the we (nhande) of 5 refers back to participants involved in the narrative. The addressee is not involved. Since the previous we's (ore) used were exclusive this showed that addressee was not a participant in the events related and there having been no change in addressee's relation to the story at this point, it is therefore known that the latter we (nhande), inclusive form, is part of a quote and that its reference is to all the participants in the story.

TOPIC AND DEVELOPMENT

Demonstrative and Declarative Verb Forms

(Parintintin)

Demonstrative and Declarative Verb Forms
In Parintintin, verbs can take three different forms. Two of these forms are dealt with in this writeup: the demonstrative and declarative. These forms are manifested as follows:

Declarative

Declarative transitives occur with pronominal prefix 2.

ex: ti - apo

we make

p2 make

Declarative intransitives occur with pronominal prefix 1.

ex: xa - ho

we go

p1 go

Declarative descripitives occur with pronominal prefix 4.

ex: ji - katu

I am pretty

p4 pretty

Demonstrative
Demonstrative transitives and intransitives occur with pronominal prefix 5 and with construction marker 1, which is the suffix -i.

ex: vt: ga i'u-i p5 eat-cml

he eats

vi: ore ho-i p5 go-cml

we go

Descriptives in the Demonstrative occur with pronominal prefix 5 and with construction marker 3, which is the suffix -ro or -amo.

ex: hẽa katu-ro p5 pretty-cm3

she is pretty

Problem
What governs the choice of the demonstrative and declarative verb forms? Is it free fluctuation? Is it based on form--i.e., by preceding morphemes? Is observer's viewpoint involved? Does it signal use of certain pronominal references?

7

Solution with short example
The demonstrative form of the verb presents the topic of the discourse, and the declarative form of the verb presents its development. As topic of the discourse the demonstrative gives direction and connectivity, guiding the listener step by step in a procession through the text. On the other hand, the declarative pads the demonstrative with additional information by means of enlarging on the demonstrative itself or carrying on a secondary line of thought which may or may not be tightly connected to that of the demonstrative.

ex from Text GY (Parintintin with translation to be found at the end of this write-up): It will be noted that lattice structure is used to make this example clear.

Dem

Quite a little time back we

1

brought manioc, putting it in

the water the other day.

• Manioc Declarative 2 In the end it had not softened. 3a It was very hard. 3b It did not soften.

And he grated in vain

5

today the (manioc) meat.

Day after tomorrow we will 8 toast it.

4 The frogs did not allow it to soften.
6 Tomorrow it will not be soft. 7 And we will not toast it first (thing)
tomorrow.
9 It makes a person take a long time (to finish) then.
10 It is very hard.

Clearly, whenever a discourse is given, the narrator must, from the grand total of everything that occurred, make a selection of what he feels he needs to narrate. The demonstrative-declarative distinction then enables the narrator to say which of these events he considers as topic (demonstrative) and which he considers to be a development of the topic (declarative). Thus, observer viewpoint is clearly involved, for there does not seem to be any unique way of making this choice from any given (etic) set of events. The same principle applies to non-narrative type discourses (e.g. procedural, explanatory, etc.). Sometimes, events given in two demonstrative clauses are connected to each other by what is said in a declarative clause (usually in between). In the matter of determining pronominal reference, then, the clause by clause progression has to be taken into account regardless of the form of the verb.
In the following cases it may appear that the case itself determines the use of the demonstrative or declarative verb form. However, it is more likely that it is inherent with certain types of question words, conjunctions, etc. for them to occur with the demonstrative or declarative verb form as the case may be, and that the narrator chooses these terms if he wishes to express that type of construction, i.e., topic or development.

8

1. Question words occur with the different verb forms as follows: a. The majority of question words almost always occur with demonstratives, (e.g: garamo, gara rehe, garakatu, marã, maraga tu, maraname, mome, manamo, mahã, ma pype, ma rupi, ma'ga pe, ma'ga pohe, ma'ga ga tu pohe) (also occuring with topic comment are: garamo, gara rehe, marã, maraname, maramomi, mome, manamo)
b. Fewer of the question words occur with declaratives. Of the above question words, a few may occur with declaratives. (e.g. mahã (found with 1st person); maraga tu; ma (found with 1st person); maramomi)
Gara has been found to occur with declaratives and topic comment, and ma'ga generally occurs with declaratives. However, it can also occur with demonstratives. (Mara'ngu occurs only with the qualifier and topic comment.)
2. Also, the conjunctions a'i and ereki/eki almost always occur with the declaratives as do the command forms of the verb.
3. The negative is not distinguishable as a demonstrative and therefore is grouped with the declaratives.
4. Verb forms occurring with -rẽ (after) and -ame (when) also are not distinguishable as a demonstrative or declarative and are classed as qualifier 2.
Display of Story
In order to show the use of the demonstrative and declarative verb forms and in an attempt at arriving at a method of paragraphing, the text HI was chosen. (Parintintin with translation is to be found at the end of this write-up.)

Comments on Surface structure
In G 1, 6, 7, 8, and 9 demonstrative verb forms occur setting forth the topics. In G 2-5 and G 10-12 declarative verb forms occur, giving the development of G 1 and G 9 respectively.
Various combinations of po (indefinite), ti (future) and kiro (now) occur presenting the different senses of time. All actual speech is in the "positive" future whereas narrated events are in the "probable" future. This is demonstrated by the absence and presence respectively of po. In G 12 po occurs with te and is therefore more probable future than without the te and therefore G 12 is considered a quote.
The exact uses of oro and nehẽ are not yet analyzed. Oro tends to connect tightly the following clause with the preceding and may have other meanings, since it has been noted that oro ve indicates a change of subject from that of the preceding clause and many times is used when first introducing a participant. nehẽ occurs with po and ti expressing an intent in the future as well as acting as some kind of a closer.
Participant Roles
The paragraph breaks I, II, and III are based on the change of the main actors: Peter, they, and she respectively. Fish, although an actor, never occurs with the demonstrative form of the verb and can possibly not be considered a main actor. The participants can be divided as follows into animate and inanimate:

10

I (Peter)

Animate Peter: initiator/actor fish: actor

II (they)
III (she)

they: fish:
she: fish:

actor goal
actor goal/benefactor?

Inanimate

trap:

goal

vine: goal

(creek): goal

door: goal

Logical Rules Between Propositions - Deep Structure L1 is a pre-event (past).
L2 is a coming event and is the "skeleton" of L1, L3, L4, and L4´. L3 is a comment sequential to L2. L4 is the declared purpose for making the trap by the participant Peter whereas L4´ is a comment made by the narrator agreeing that the purpose probably will be fulfilled. Since these two are on the same plane they are marked L4 and L4´.
L5 is a coming event and a ''skeleton."

L6 is a coming event and a "skeleton."

L7 is a coming event and a "skeleton."

L8 is a coming narrated event and is the "skeleton" of L9-11, which is reported speech. L9, a recap of L6, is the reason for L10. L10 is the reason for L11. L11, in turn, is a paraphrase of L8. Since these are steps to a conclusion they each have their separate number.

decl = declarative

r = fish - initiative subscript labels = which human participant it is; and parentheses indicate the quote content, those
outside of parenthesis indicate quote margin (e.g. I3 (I2, r3͡I3) wherein I3 is the quote margin and (I2, r3͡I3) is the quote content in which the half moon ͡ indicates r3 is followed by I3 ).
It will be noticed that the same paragraphing is kept in this solution divided between the human animates: actions regarding Peter make up paragraph one; they, paragraph two; she, paragraph three.

Each demonstrative comes with an I (declaratives are included in this, note paragraph one). r comes only with the declarative in this text (note paragraphs 1 and 3).

Logical sequence ties together I1 and r1 and subsequent I1, etc.

Other Considerations
Helen Pease suggested the text AZ, which is a series of storyettes, as a substitute means for checking to see if the narrator would always choose a demonstrative and declarative in the same places in identical narratives. As much as the storyettes could be lined up, the demonstratives and declaratives occurred in identical places in each storyette. In lining up the storyettes, other considerations were brought to the fore in regard to discourse breaks along the lines discussed (on paper in 1967) between Helen Pease and Margaret Sheffler concerning some network done on other texts.
In an attempt to present this bulky text AZ in a readable fashion, breaks were made in the order given below: (Parintintin with translation to be found at the end of this write-up.)
1. By the occurrence of the courting done by six separate lovers which resulted in six storyettes, the whole of which is preceded by an explanation for the courting (1-3) and the whole of which is followed by the result of the courting (353-355). These storyettes are typed in columns and are marked First Lover, Second Lover, etc. (To compare the storyettes, place all pages marked for each of the six lovers alongside each other.) The same procedure is to be followed for page marked (23), etc.
2. By the occurrence of the conjunction aerẽ 'afterwards' which by its very meaning can refer to a large area and sets up the entire discourse for possible breaks. The breaks made by aerẽ are marked in the chart by a heavy horizontal line ( _____ )
3. By the occurrence of other conjunctions, namely:
a. nani 'shortly'
b. nanime 'in a short time'
c. oro 'and' (in the sense of sequence)
and oro combinations:
1) oro ve 'and contrastively' (in the sense of a type of conflict and different subject than the immediately preceding subject)
2) oro kiro 'and now',
which are found in places where aerẽ might occur. These conjunctions can occur in identical places to where aerẽ actually occurs in another storyette … therefore the basis for the division by these conjunctions alone without a corresponding occurrence

13

by aerẽ in an identical place in another storyette. The breaks made by these conjunctions alone are marked _ _ _.
4. By the occurrence of identical parts to the lovers' feats in the daughter's recounting to the father and in the father's attempt at imitation. Although the daughter's recounting and the father's attempts are but scattered bits, and the storyette of the fifth lover is not complete, breaks in the same, identical places can be distinguished and are marked by corresponding circled numbers.
Although no division or break was marked on this chart on the basis of temporals and locatives alone, possible further breaks could have been made with them as a guide. Note that koro 'here', pero 'there', kiro 'now' in some storyettes ocurred without an aerẽ whereas in anothor storyette in an identical place they occurred with aerẽ immediately preceding. It also appears that a break could be expressed implicitly by a statement made by a participant initiating a reply or an action to a statement or question.
By considering that the aerẽ's in each of the storyettes run across all the storyettes in identical places, the storyettes are broken down into identical subjects which are labeled on the chart as Announcement of Lover, etc.; Greetings; Introduction of Daughter; Goes Near Daughter, Proposition; Parents tell her to go; and etc.... All the storyettes do not have all the different subject matters, e.g. the third and fifth lovers are the only two who have the subject Parents tell her to go.
Further, by considering that in each of the storyettes all other conjunctions, which are found in places where aerẽ might occur, run across the storyettes in identical places, additional subjects can be made, e.g. under the subject Method of Carrying out Proposition by second and fourth lovers and part of fifth and sixth lovers easily breaks into subdivisions marked by the encircled numbers two to six. Now, are these types of breaks to be considered other subjects, or are they to be considered subdivisions of the subjects derived from breaks made only on the basis of the presence of an aerẽ in at least one of the storyettes at that identical place?
At the writing of this paper it is not decided if aerẽ and these other conjunctions are on the same level or not. Suffice it to say that when any one of these conjunctions are used the narration passes into another section, although the sections may be very close in space or time – depending upon the meaning indicated by the conjunction used. When couplets of oro are used, however, as in 202 and 203, they are inseparable and the two of them together form one section. This is demonstrated in the daughter's recounting in 232-234 where oro occurs only in the second half (234). A freer translation of 202 and 203 is: 'He didn't cut it with an axe, but instead he cut it with his teeth.' It has been noted that if each storyette is observed independently of the others the aerẽ's have a tendency to set off large connected chunks throughout that storyette as a whole, whereas oro, by itself, does not appear to do this, nor does oro ve, oro kiro, nani, nor nanime. Judging from some of the other shorter texts, such as HI, where aerẽ does not occur, oro occurs more frequently and appears to take on the load of the aerẽ.
While the demonstrative verb form carries the Topic of the discourse, giving the overall movements or progression, it does not indicate of itself any "breaking" as such, although the breaks, in identical places in each of the storyettes governed by the occurrence of aerẽ in at least one of the storyettes, occurred simultaneously with the demonstrative verb form generally twice as much as with the declarative verb form. It was noted that the demonstrative verb form
14

occurred somewhere in each of the different subjects as entitled on the chart except in a couple of cases where the verb is missing, e.g. in the subject Suggestion to Go, the verb 'say' in the quotative is missing.
So, then, the Parintintin use another method of guiding their listeners through a discourse than the Topic and Development indicated by the demonstrative and declarative verb form, and that is the Change in Movement in Space and Time indicated explicitly by conjunctions (and possibly temporals and locatives) and perhaps implicitly by means of statements, etc., that may change time or location.
A possible third way of guiding their listeners may be by means of clause final morphemes listed as follows:
1. hako 'a long time ago' occurs in the first and last storyette and appears to be tying the entire text together as one unit.
2. raka'e 'a long time ago' In the first storyette, it occurs in clause 4 and 29 marking the arrival and leaving of the jirutia--the first lover--thus tying together this section of the first storyette. The noun jirutia occurs with 4, but not with 29. The occurrence of the raka'e in these two places only may also serve as a means of identification of the subject in 29. In the last storyette, it occurs in 290, 291 and 354 marking the arrival and leaving of the kingfisher--the last lover--thus tying together this section of the last storyette. The noun jatavotia 'kingfisher' occurs with 290, but not with 291 nor 354. The occurrences in these three places may also serve as a means of identification of the subject in 291 and 354. On this same basis, although the subject of 324b is not expressed, the presence of raka'e probably indicates that the kingfisher is the one who caused the daughter to be a woman.
From following the raka'e's in this text, the beginning and ending of the daughter's love affairs regarding her puberty can be seen.
3. no 'also' In the first storyette, it does not occur. In the second storyette, it occurs in 86 and 117 with the tick saying he's going, and in 82, 95, 98, 101 and 115 in regard to father. (115 could be in reference to the tick also.) In the third storyette, it occurs in 122 and 159 with the firefly coming and going and in 166 and 181 in regard to father. In the fourth storyette, it occurs in 183 and 225 with the beetle coming and going and in 190 referring to daughter and in 255 and 258 regarding father. In the fifth storyette, it occurs in 261 on quotative when daughter? speaking. In the sixth storyette, it occurs in 353 referring to daughter?
It is not clear at this point how, if no opens and closes sections as could be indicated in the third storyette (i.e., 122 and 159, 166 and 181), that intervening no's are distinguished as seen in the second storyette (i.e., 82, 95, 98, 101, 115 intervene with 86 and 117).
15

It was noticed that no is never preceded by a subject twice in any set of the above examples. There can be a no preceded by a verb twice in a set, e.g.
in 82. "Let's take them to your father no." in 86 "Now I'm going no." in 95 "I will go to see," father no prob. said. in 98 And he fell in the end, himself breaking no. in 101 "Climb, climb, climb," prob. went, picking no, standing, picking, being. Another solution that seems probable is that a clause ending in no only connects that clause with the immediately preceding one and thus carries a meaning of 'also', 'so', 'as'.
