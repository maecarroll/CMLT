A PHONOLOGICALOUTLINE OF MATACO-NOCTENES
KENNETH CLAESSON
UNIVERSITY OF STOCKHOLM
1.1. Introduction. Mataco is one of the Macro-Guaicuruanlanguages, which are considered to belong to the Macro-Panoan family within the Ge-Pano-Carib group (Crystal 1988:322-23). By "Noctenes" I refer to the dialect spoken by approximately two thousand Mataco Indians in southern Bolivia, who live mainly on the right bank of the Pilcomayo River (cf. Karsten 1932:26). This dialect remains scantily described, and when we compare it to what has been written about the Argentinean variants, Noctenes displays some quite remarkable differences concerning things like syllable structure, stress placement, vowel length, velar and uvular sounds, distributionof the glottal stop, characterof the glottalized sounds, and the influence exerted by /h/ over the voiced consonants and semivowels.
Opinions have diverged regarding the status of the velar fricative, [x], and the glottal fricative, [h], of the Mataco language. While, for instance, Hunt (1940) and Harrington (1948) treat them as separate phonological units, Viiias Urquiza (1970), in her more extensive phonetic and phonological description of a certain Argentinean Mataco dialect, finds them in complementary distribution and brings them together as a phoneme. Another puzzling area of the Mataco phonology concerns the velar and uvular stops, [k], [kw], and [q]. In this paper, I pay special attention to these problems and attempt to throw light on how they are presently resolved within the Noctenes dialect.1
1 The materialpresented in this paperis based on my own linguistic work in southernBolivia during the years 1981-87. In this period I was working as a Bible translatorwith the Swedish Free Mission's project for the Mataco-Noctenes group. My greatest debt of gratitude is to ?Noolnejen?, Mhanhyejas, and Lucas Cortez, who patiently taught me their language, and to Jan-Ake Alvarsson, who did initial linguistic work in this area, from which I have benefited. I am also grateful to Osten Dahl of the University of Stockholm for taking an interest in my material and encouraging me to write this paper. I also thank David S. Rood and two anonymous IJALreviewers for helpful comments that improved the paper.
For descriptions of Mataguayandialects and their extension, the readeris also referredto Alvarsson (1988), Braunstein (1990), Gerzenstein (1983), Henry (1936), Martin and Braunstein (1991), Messineo (1987), Messineo and Braunstein (1990), Najlis (1968; 1971; 1984), Seelwische (1980), Stell (1972), and Tovar (1951; 1964a; 1964b; 1981).

1.2. Orthography.2 The written representation used in this paper basically corresponds to the phonemic one presented in 2, but the unroundedback open vowel lal is written a (characterizedby a grave accent), the velar fricatives /x/ and /xw/ are writtenj andjw, respectively, and the /kw/ phoneme is represented by k. Long vowels are written with double letters, and stress is orthographically indicated with an acute accent if and only if it does not fall on the last syllable of a word. When stress must be indicated on a, the vowel is written with a circumflex, as in ?iyaahape?'we are'. On double vowel letters stress is marked with only one orthographicaccent (or circumflex). Thus, in ?ohooyeh 'I go to him/ her', the letters 6o representone long, stressed [o:]; in hiape?'(s)he is', da correspond to stressed [a:].
The orthographyused also reflects my view that the glottalized, aspirated, and certain unvoiced consonants may be considered clusters of two phonemes, in which one part is always a laryngeal. This interpretationis argued for below in 7, where the full presentation of the complex consonants is given. It is important,though, that the readerbe aware at the outset that ALLsequences of symbols for consonantal phonemes within one and the same syllable-and there are no such sequences which do not contain either ? or h-represent glottalized or aspirated stops and affricates, or glottalized or devoiced laterals, nasals, and semivowels. In particular, it should be observed that Ih represents a voiceless fricative lateral, and that mh, nh, yh, and wh represent voiceless nasals with bilabial, dental, palatal, and velar/labial places of articulation,respectively.
2. Phonemes. On the basis of their contrastive function, six syllabic sounds (vowels) and sixteen nonsyllabic sounds (consonants and semivowels) may be classified as phonemes. The contrasts of the vowel system are obtained by a three-termdistinction of aperture(height) at front and back tongue position, while consonantal oppositions are produced at six places of articulationand by six different mannersof articulation;velars, in addition, are differentiated by labialization (adding w) and palatalization (with y). The specifications of these systems are as shown in table 1.
The vowels are unmarked as to lip attitude, and there are no oppositions between rounded and unrounded vowel sounds. There is a vowel
length contrast, which is considered a prosodic phenomenon in this language. The heavy vowel nasalization is, in principle, noncontrastive and predictable on the basis of certain rules.
2 Note the use of the following symbols: + = morphemeboundary(except when used with distinctive features); [V:] = long vowel (in phonetic transcriptions);[V] = stressed vowel; [V] = nasalized vowel; [C] = devoiced consonant, used with laterals, nasals, and semivowels.

All the phonemes may also be described as unmarked with respect to the feature of voice. Thus, in addition to the vowels, the lateral, the nasals, and the semivowels are voiced, while other sounds are voiceless. (The
phonetically voiceless lateral and nasals are not considered phonemes.) Of the semivowels, /y/ represents a nonfricative palatal approximant,
while /w/ has a double articulation at the lips and at the velum. /ky/ denotes a palatalized velar stop, which in some dialects (and idiolects) is replaced by a palatal or palato-alveolar affricate ([c]).
3. Syllable structure. The dominant syllable structure of Noctenes is CV (consonant-vowel). A word-final syllable of an isolated word, i.e., before a pause, always terminates with a consonant, the minimum type being CVC. If the complex and devoiced consonants are interpreted as sequences of phonemes (rather than single phonemes of glottalized or aspirated stops and affricates or glottalized or voiceless laterals and nasals), there are, in addition, syllables consisting of CCV, CCVC, CVCC, and CCVCC. Syllables of these types are represented by, for example, ky?a$nhoo? ([ky?anno:?]) 'three-banded armadillo' (where the first syllablewith ky as one consonantal phoneme-is CCV, and the second one is CCVC), taa$yhi? ([ta:jyl?]) 'woods' (CV and CCVC), pha? 'up' (CCVC), hul? 'spear' (CVCC), lhaalh ([lla:l]) 'its light' (CCVCC), ?nal? 'it reveals itself' (CCVCC), and ky?uu$than? 'thistle' (CCV and CCVCC).
As seen, vowels may occur in syllable-internal or syllable-final position but cannot initiate a syllable. In many words, as well as at word boundaries, a sequence of vowels is blocked by the presence of a glottal stop, which evidently behaves like a regular, full consonant: ?aa$?a?

'drum tree', ?ilaa$?ah 'river otter', hoo$?oh 'hen', jwa$?aayh 'algarroba fruit',pi$?a? 'debt', ta$?aa?'teruterubird'.
According to the syllable structurestated above, the language also generally rejects clusters of vowel phonemes within the syllable.3 In the sequences wV, yV, CVw, and CVy the approximants/w/ and /y/, which are phonetically vowels, function as consonants. This interpretation is supported by the fact that /w/ and /y/ group with /1/, /m/, and /n/ to form a natural class of voiced consonantal sounds, which are all affected by a phonological rule of devoicing under the influence of /h/ (see further 7.3.2). This process does not affect vowels.
The consonantal function of the approximants also can be seen when certain role/case-marking morphemes are used in suffixation, as in the
following pairs:4

(la) ?i

+la

+?weet +eh.

(s)he be his/her place in

'(S)He is at home'.

(lb) ?i

+puule +yeh.

(s)he be heaven in

'(S)He is in heaven'.5

(2a) ?i (s)he

+wo +?ahuutsaj +a?.

do

caracara

ACCUSATIVE

'(S)He dances "caracara"'.

3 The only words I know in which vowel phonemes come together are ?atsiinhaukjwaj [?atsi:nnfakxwax] 'an old little woman' and hi?nooukjwaj[hi?no:ukxwax]'an old little man'. These are abbreviated variants of ?atsiinhawumekjwajand hi?noowumekjwajin which the morpheme wumek 'old'-inserted between the noun (hi?no?'man', ?atsiinha?'woman') and the diminutive morpheme (jwaj)-has been reduced. The nasalization of the vowel seque4nTceheisrvoelerymsatrroknegr.sare phonetically bound to their hosts. If one tries to pronounce locative -eh, for instance, as a separate form, it is perceived as a sequence of ?eh and is immediately rejected (as a locative marker)by a native speaker.
The role markersadhere to heads of phrases. In a verb phrase, then, the nominal constituents may be signaled by role markers which are attached to the verb itself. In (1) and (2), nominal complements are incorporated into verbs. In these cases, the noun position is between the verb stem and the role marker.
5 The verbs in my examples are mostly not temporally defined. Translationsgiven to such unmarkedand noncontextual forms are arbitrarywith respect to time.
Observe that ?i(i) in example (1) is a verb stem (with conjugation, as in ?o+?ii+hi?'I am in .. .', Ihee+hi? 'you are in . . .', ?ii+hi?'(s)he is in . . .', i.e., with zero morpheme for third person), whereas ?i in (2) represents a third-personsubject prefix.

In (la), the locative marker-eh is attached to the final consonant of the
previous morpheme, ?wet, whereby a permissible CVC syllable is obtained. The morpheme and the syllable in this case overlap each other, having the morpheme-final /t/ in common.7 (lb) shows the strategy generally used by the language to avoid a phonologically prohibited sequence of vowels. The solution in all such cases is the insertion of /y/ (or optionally sometimes /w/), which may be understood as a syllable structure process whereby a certain rule operates in order to impose the required

6 The verbs are always defined as to the grammatical person of the subject and the possible complement(s) (according to the argument structure of the verb). An empty complement position represents a third-person anaphoric relation. The language needs no overt pronominalforms for third-personnonreflexive complements. Yikehhas zero morphemes for both third-person subject and third-person complement; -eh is the role marker for the
complement. 7 According to an alternative interpretationof this type of border phenomenon, the final
consonant of the first of the two morphemes brought together would be doubled. My language consultants had earlier rejected that theory, but during my last visit to Bolivia (1992) some of them seemed convinced that in some cases a gemination process does take place. Among the examples were taajjah 'this' (with ti&j 'thing' and (n)ah 'DEMONSTRATIVE: touched'), tdjjej '(s)he hits it with it' (with taj '(s)he hits it' and -ej 'with'), yikkeh '(s)he goes for it' (with yik '(s)he goes' and -eh 'for'). This issue does not affect the main point of this section, namely, that the syllable must begin with a consonant, but if gemination really occurs, parts of the descriptions in other sections (in particular,6.2 and 6.3) would have to be modified. However, my descriptions are consonant with a general, very clear pattern of "interlacement"between syllables and morphemes, the typical case being that a syllable boundaryseparates a single segment from the rest of a morpheme, frequently with vowel reduction involved, as in ?o$waah$n+ej 'I allow him/her to do it' (with wahin 'allow'),
?no$waaq$l+ha$t+ej$?o+h$kya+h$1a?([?nowa:qllatex?6hkyahld?])'it has been preparedfor me' (with waq?alh 'ready', hat 'CAUSATIVE', hikya? 'down', hila? 'DEIXIS/TRANSITION'),
ya$qaa$lel+h$t+hi$la+h$kyA? ([yaqa:lelthilahkyd?]) '(s)he will judge him/her' (again with hat and hikya?;cf. yaqaalelhat '(s)he makes it clear'). This patterncould not possibly have been misinterpreted,but it must be an importanttask of future research to map out possible occurrences of consonant geminates before role markerswith initial vowel.

pattern.8 Similarly, in (2), the nouns ?ahuutsaj 'caracara falcon' and laha(?) 'its price' are incorporated into the verbal frame wo ... (y)a? 'do ... ACCUSATIVE'.9 In (3b) the same transitivizing morpheme as in (3a), -eh, is inserted between the markersfor irrealis (hi) and future (lah), and the y is then epenthesized again to maintain syllable shape.

4. Suprasegmentals.

4.1. Stress. Noctenes appears to have free, phonemic stress. Thus, at least on a phonetic level, it might not be possible to explain why, for instance, haiapeyej'(s)he is identical with him/her' is stressed on the first
syllable, while hap?dqej 'together with (with third-person subject and complement)' and yahaanej '(s)he knows it' (for the use of orthographic accents, see 1) are stressed on the second and third syllable respectively. Also phonetically unpredictable is the variation of stress placement in pairs like hadpe? '(s)he is' and haateh 'also (third person)', nikydateh '(s)he arrives there' and nikyaite? 'hook', taky?6oteh'(s)he helps him/her' and laky?oote?'his/her ear'.
The appearance of paroxitone and proparoxitone words is frequently due to the suffixation of transitivizers or other role markers. Since these
suffixes most often occur with verbs (cf. n. 4), the stress placement variation to some extent follows the lines of the grammatical separation of categories. The role markers are not consistently unstressed, however. The directional/transitivizing suffix -eh, used unstressed in nikyadteh and taky?6otehabove, is stressed in, for instance, yahaineh '(s)he takes him/ her there' and yacmeh '(s)he talks to him/her; (s)he tells it'.
The aspectual affix t?athas a strong prosodic value. Words with tPatare pronounced with stress in two places, and frequently with an unusually high-pitched voice in some part of the word. Compare also the features of stress and vowel length in the following pairs of words:

kyumah kyumdat?dt

'take it' 'just go on taking of it'

?otkyuumlhih

'I work'

?otkyuumlhit?dt 'I am just working'

8 Formally:0 -- y/V+ V. That this is a case of epenthesis ratherthan deletion can be

seen from the fact that the language also allows sequences of C+y. The argumentis as fol-

lows: if, for instance, the basic form of the locative markerin (la) and (lb) had been yeh,

this form would have been maintained, and parallel to ?ipuuleyehwe would have had *?il-

a?w9eF'eotrymehs.TwhiethstaruficntualreCt+Vyh ios rdCocVu?mseynlltaebdlien, ,

for like

example, ?nooky?otyaj'help'. laha? and puule?, lose their final

glottal

sound when anothermorphemeis added and in phrase-internalposition.

4.2. Vowel length. From what appears in 3 above, the long vowel in, for instance, naat 'it falls' should not be understood as a sequence of two
identical phonemes. Since diphthongs or triphthongs (phonologically) are not found in the language, it is evident that IFhomorganic sequences of vowels should exist, these would be the only vowel sequences permitted. If, on the other hand, the long vowels are not sequences of two identical phonemes, the rule that prevents forms like *neat or *noit applies more generally, without exception for homorganic sequences.
The following presentation also indicates that length cannot be interpreted as an inherent distinctive feature of Noctenes vowels, which would enable us to distinguish between short and long vowel phonemes.
One basic observation behind these conclusions is that there are special
constraintson the distributionof long vowels. If, for instance, aa occurs in a word, the same word cannothave ee, nor any other,additionallong vowel.
From this it follows that the morphemes of the language are not generally defined with respect to vowel length. The lengthening appears as an "overlaid," separable function at this level. For example, ?onaat 'I fall' includes an abstract unit, i.e., the morpheme nat 'fall', which in the firstperson inclusive plural form (referring to speaker[s] and listener[s]) is realized without the long vowel: ?iyaanathen? 'we fall'. Similarly, the monosyllabic morpheme wuk 'owner, master' takes the long vowel in its third-person form lawuuk 'his/her master', whereas in the first-person form, ?oowuk 'my master', the feature of added length goes to the first morpheme/syllable (?oo 'my'). In ?iikyajwih '(s)he is under it', the twosyllable morpheme kyajwih 'under'appears without a long vowel; in talhkyajwiih '(s)he has come out under the command of him/her', the same morpheme has a final long vowel. Comparing takyuumah'(s)he takes it' with kyumdat?dt'just go on taking of it' we see that the feature of vowel
lengthening changes its position within the two-syllable morpheme kyumah 'take'. In lataakyumah 'you take it', the same morpheme appears
without any long vowel. The same interactionbetween syllables is furtherillustratedin pairs like:

?oo+wuke? ?a+wuuke?

'my house' 'your house'

?noo+hih la+hiih
?o+p?aliitsaj ?aa+p?alitsaj
?o+?yaqaanh la+t?aaqanh

'receptacle' 'its receptacle'
'I am poor' 'you are poor'
'I like it' 'you like it'

ta+ky?aahu+yeh '(s)he listens to him/her' lataa+ky?ahu+yeh 'you listen to him/her'

ta+piilh yaapilh

'(s)he returnshere' '(s)he returnsthere'10

?oo+?wet+teh ha+?weet+teh

'my home long ago' 'your home long ago'

Despite these observations, vowel lengthening is nevertheless not generally predictable and has a clearly phonemic function. For example, lapaq 'his/her voice' differs minimally from lapaaq 'you paint';?oyik'I go' by the same token contrasts with ?ooyik 'my scar'. The noun ?atsiinha? 'woman' has the vocative form ?atsinhah.It appearsthat this feature does not correlate either with syllable position or heaviness, or with stress, or with the quantityof adjacentconsonants (see above examples). Moreover, it is not an obligatory feature of every word. Monosyllabic words may have a long vowel; polysyllables may lack it: hup 'hut',tooq 'toucan',talhp?antepepa kyeenaj '(s)he is said to have come from the mountain a long time ago', lakyeeyajanhat?noyejkyiinajt?aj'you lent me the money'.
As far as I understandit, the lengthening of vowels in Noctenes must be considered a suprasegmental feature of prominence, a "prosodeme," for which word boundaries are relevant in the sense that the language, in principle, assigns a maximum of one unit of added vowel length to each word. This point is important: even though the feature is assigned to vowel segments, it is significant only at the word level. It is comparable in this sense to the feature of stress.
A furtherillustration of the one word/one long vowel principle is found in compounds of nouns. Consider the following examples:

hi?no? maahse? hi?noomahse?

'man; human being' 'young (adolescent) man' 'young man'

?atsiinha? Ihuutsha? ?atsiinhalhutsha?

'woman'
'young (adolescent) woman' 'young woman'

taayhi? Iheeleyh taayhilheleyh

'forest' 'its inhabitants' 'forest inhabitants'

10This verb has the following (rathercommon) conjugational paradigm:?oyaapilh 'I return there'-lhaapilh 'you return there'-yaapilh '(s)he returns there'. Some kind of fusion of morphemes might have taken place in the second-person form, but at present it is not pos-
sible to separatepronominalprefixes for second and third person.

Maanhyejas

'PROPERNAME'

lakyuujwanek

'his disciple'

Maanhyejaskyujwanek 'Maanhyejas's disciple'

Once established, the principle mentioned aids in the understanding and perception of word structure and boundaries of the language. Two furtherexamples may illustrate this point:

nikydateh

'(s)he came to...'

p?anteh

'long ago/nonwitnessed'l1

?uujw

'/other/ side of river; shore'

Nikyatp?ante?uujweh. '(S)He came to the other side of the river a

long time ago (without my witnessing it)'.

yahooyeh naj ?aam?
Yahoonaj?dmeh.

'(s)he went to . . .'
'recently/witnessed' 'you' '(S)He recently (as I saw) went to you'.

The use of the long vowel feature in the two sentences above strongly supports the interpretationthat they are to be considered single words in which a noun and a pronoun, respectively, are incorporatedinto verbs of movement. The position of the incorporated form is between the verb
stem and the role marker((y)eh 'DIRECTION').
These examples are chosen to illustrate also that incorporatednouns and pronouns are treated differently with respect to the assignment of vowel lengthening. Nouns that otherwise have a long vowel retain it in the incorporation while the verb, as a consequence, loses its (if otherwise existing) long vowel. The incorporationof a pronoun, on the other hand, does not
affect the length of the vowels of the verb, but the pronounitself may have a long vowel in a position between the stem and the end of a verb if the
verb lacks the feature of lengthening (see 4 below). In other words, with
incorporationsinvolving nouns, the "right"to vowel lengthening belongs to the noun; with pronounsthis same "right"belongs to the verb.
Finally, it is a well-known fact that many languages mark grammatical categories with suprasegmental features such as stress and tone (see, for
instance, Anderson 1985:168-69). It should not be surprising, then, that vowel lengthening in Noctenes also plays a role within the inflectional

11The temporal markers have separate variants for nonwitnessed/nonexperimented ac-
tion. In the majority of cases, the difference is an initial glottal stop for nonwitnessed action: (?)ne?'immediate past', (?)mhe?'habitual action during the day of speaking or the night before', (?)mdt(hi?)'today, past night', (?)ndj(i?)'yesterday and back to some weeks (or even
months) previously', (?)mhdj(i?)'from yesterday back to remote past for habitual action'. Remote past for single action is markedp?anteh (nonwitnessed) or (h)teh (witnessed).

morphology of the language. Due to its apparentlymore stable (although not altogether fixed) character in grammatical morphemes, certain patterns arise that help identify grammatical categories of words. One such patternis seen in clauses like ?o?ween?oo?wet'I saw my home' and ?okyeeyas ?ookyeyas 'I lifted my grandson', where the variation of vowel length signals verbs and nouns. (Since the forms of noun stems and verb stems do not frequently coincide, minimal pairs of this kind should be few. What is claimed here is only that the vowel lengthening feature is grammatically significant and supplements the segmental and morphological categories at the word level.) The following are some generalizations:
(4) The vowel of a monosyllabic pronominal subject prefix of a verb is always short. In two-syllable subject prefixes, the second vowel is long.
Examples:

?o+huuminh la+huuminh
ya+huuminh ?iyaa+huminh

'I like it' 'you like it' '(s)he likes it' 'we (INCLUSIVE) like it'12

?ot+ky?6ot+eh lataa+ky?6t+eh ta+kyo?ot+eh ?iyaat+ky?6t+eh

'I help him/her' 'you help him/her' '(s)he helps him/her'
'we (INCLUSIVE)help him/her'

(5) Pronominal object morphemes have a long vowel when placed be-
fore the verbal stem: ?aa 'you', ?inaa 'us INCLUSIVE'. (These morphemes occur in the mentioned position when there is no overt role marker.) In other positions the pronominal complements (for object and oblique cases) have short vowels-?no(?) 'me', ?am 'you', ?inam 'us INCLUSIVE'whenever the simpler verb form to which they are affixed includes a vowel-lengthening unit; otherwise the complement takes this feature:

?o+?aa+ya+huminh ?aa+ya+huminh ?inaa+ya+huminh

'I like you'13 '(s)he likes you' '(s)he likes us (INCLUSIVE)'

12Otherplural forms are identical to the singularones (the difference being obtained with pronouns). Pronominal transitions (see Hunt 1940:86) also give rise to many forms that are
not included in this presentation. 13The thirdmorphemeof this form seems to representthird-personreference. This type of
construction is also seen in other cases, for instance: ?o+lhaa+?i+lanh 'I kill myself', where
lhaa marks reflexive form and ?i is the third-personsubject prefix; cf. ?olaanh 'I kill it', lalaanh 'you kill it', ?ilianh '(s)he kills it', ?oaaVilanh 'I kill you'. I cannot tell why this is so.

5. Vowels.

5.1. Vowel distinctions. Others who have studied the Mataco language family have reported more than the six vowels recorded here-corrobo-
rated in, for instance, taj 'SUBORDINATINGCONJUNCTION(a' lso tc?), taj 'it hits it', tej 'although',tij '(s)he digs it', -tojw 'distant',14tujw '(s)he eats it'. Harrington (1948:25), without any detailed phonetic description, indicates eight vowels, viz. a, , t, o, u, a, e, i. Similarly, Najlis (1984:15), in her reconstruction of the protolanguage("la protolengua mataguaya"),specifies eight vowels: i, E (front half-closed), e, a, u, O (back half-closed), o, A (back low). Najlis characterizesthis four-termscale of apertureas difficult and supposes that this has brought about changes whereby the "subsystems" ("los subsistemas vocalicos") have been reduced to five or six vowels. This is in agreement with Vinas Urquiza's (1970:35) reporting of six vowels for a southernMataco dialect and Gerzenstein's(1983:30) find-
ing of five vowels in the Chorote language. As for Noctenes, I have not detected any signs of phonemic or regular allophonic differentiation between half-closed and half-open vowels.
The Noctenes set of vowels differs from the surroundingSpanish system in the distinction between the open vowels, which is, incidentally, abundantly evidenced by many minimal pairs, as, e.g., ?Mq'your food' versus ?aq'yourfetter', ?noosilatyaj'greeting'versus ?noosilatyaj'beauty', lhaayh 'its colors' versus lhaayh 'its fruit'. It may be assumed that Spanish /a/, with its allophonic alternations,covers the whole phonetic area which in Noctenes is divided between /a/ and /a/. When Noctenes borrows
Spanish words, adapting them to its phonological system, the use of open vowel therefore alternates between the two possibilities; that is, Spanish /a/ is sometimes replaced by Noctenes /a/ (as in paanh 'pan (bread)', paale? 'padre (father)', tdawah 'taba game') and sometimes by /a/ (as in ?alos 'arroz (rice)', ?aasno? 'asno (donkey)', kaaye? 'calle (street)', naalanjwah 'naranja (orange)'). The latter alternative seems to be the more frequent one.

5.2. Vowel nasalization. The Mataco language is heavily nasalized. Interestingly, the nasal element with the vowels is due not only to the influence of the nasal consonants, as in:

[ma:h] [ma:t] [nek]

'go!' 'true' '(s)he comes'

14 Velars following rounded vowels are neutralized with respect to the feature of labialization.

[ni:ydkw] 'string'

[m6:p?i?] 'white heron'

but also stems from the effect of /h/:

[h :pe?] [ha?ydx] [nl:sahes] [?n6:hih] [h6onx] [hfip]

'it is him/her'
'jaguar' 'shoes' 'container' 'afternoon' 'hut'

Furthermore, the glottal fricative, through a regressive effect on the voiced consonants (including semivowels), produces an additional series of voiceless nasals at the corresponding places of articulation: [m], [n],
[j], and [ojw](cf. 1). These "secondary"nasals also exert a strong nasalizing influence on following vowels:

[n&:mmo?] '(s)he comes in here' [lanne:te?] 'his/her wound' [?n6:nnuis] 'nose' [ta:jpyT?] 'woods' [xwi:jyo6?] 'live coal' [laBjwa:y?] 'its time'

To conclude this section, another group of words needs to be mentioned. In examples like:

[?olla:m?] [?otuxw]

'I' 'I eat it'

[?o:q6h]

'my mother'

[?6:puhxwah] 'my brother'

[?U:h]

'yes'

the nasalization of the first vowel of each word does not follow any of the given principles, and we must ask if this nasality is conditioned and predictable at all. It would not be too strange, perhaps, to assume the same
nasalizing effect from the glottal stop as from the corresponding fricative, but the phenomenon appears very restricted. In the first place, only the back vowels /o/ and /u/ are affected. Secondly, this nasalization mostly occurs when these vowels follow 71in the first syllable of a word. If all instances of /o/ and /u/ were nasal in this position, there would exist a kind of complementary distribution, but this is not so.
A possible explanation may rather stem from the fact that all the given examples with [6] are related to the first person ('I, my'). The nasality might then be regarded as inherent in certain morphemes and could be

interpretedas a lingering result of an earlier influence from a now lost nasal consonant, or from /h/. Such an assumption is supported by Hunt's (1940:27) description of the historical development:15 "... the prefix O = HO = NO, and was originally used by a woman speaker, but is now common to both sexes. The form NO is still preserved in the objective affixes to verbs as chot no ye, help me, help us; and regularly used by the southern Matacos as no-kwe, my hand, no-tham, I. HO is a variant of NO (the change from N to H is very common in the Chaco tongues), the aspirate has been lost through carelessness of speech, and results in the use of the simple vowel O."
For an affirmativeanswer to a question-in Bolivia nowadays [?i:h]Hunt (1937) and Harrington (1948:26) use the form hu, which might be taken as an indication that this word has passed through a similar
development.
6. Consonant phonemes.
6.1. The palatalized velar stop and the dental affricate. The place of articulation for the initial stop of the Noctenes phoneme /ky/ can be compared to the place of articulation of English /k/ before a front vowel (as in keep). The phoneme is usually pronounced as a sequence of this stop and a following palatal approximant,and may be described, accordingly, as a palatalized fronted velar stop. Noctenes kyenh 'send it' is phonetically comparable to Spanish quien 'who'. This pronunciation is general among the old Mataco people of Bolivia.
In Argentinean dialects, there is, instead of [ky], a front palatal (or palato-alveolar) affricate, [c] (or [tc]), which resembles the Spanish sound in, for instance, chico 'small.'16This variant seems to be gaining ground, probably reinforced by the Spanish influence, and may also be heard among younger speakers in Bolivia. It is strongly rejected, though, by the older, leading Noctenes Indians of this region.
Noteworthy is the sound substitution that occurs when Noctenes borrows words from Spanish and Quechua:
15Furtherevidence is found in Tovar (1951:378). Tovar cites no-tepe as the first-person possessive form in a Noctenes paradigm for the noun 'face', rendering it 'mi cara'. He also mentions "la n como prefijo neutral, sin referencia a poseedor concreto." This latter statement agrees with the present situation. In current usage among the Bolivian Mataco the prefix ?no (apparently related to hi?no? 'man') conveys a general, impersonal meaning to nouns and verbs: ?noote?pe?'face' (but: ?oote?pe?'my face'), ?noyaameh'someone tells it, it is told'. The first-person reference of ?no? is preserved, though, in its suffixed position: yah&an?no?'(s)he follows me', naam?n6yeh'(s)he came to me here'.
16 CompareHarrington(1948:26): "The sound of tc in Matako is unaspirated,being evidently exactly the same as the ch of Spanish."

maatseta? from Spanish machete 'broadknife' kuutsi? from Quechuan khuchi 'pig'
That is, Noctenes does not use Ikyl (either as [ky] or as [c]) where Spanish or Quechua uses a palatal affricate, but chooses to put a dental affricate, /ts/, in its stead. From this we can conclude that the Noctenes phoneme /ky/ does not simply parallel the Spanish or Quechuan palatal affricate. In fact, it seems that the Noctenes Mataco interpreted palatal affricates as articulated at a more front position than their own /ky/, which confirms our description of /ky/ as a basically velar sound with secondary (palatal) articulation.
Both /ky/ and Its/ have defective distributions,occurringonly in syllableinitial positions.
6.2. Other velar and uvular stops.
6.2.1. A rough phonetic description further includes the phones [k], [kw], and [q]. According to the data given in table 2, these sounds occur in the following positions:
[kw] - at the beginning of syllables before /a/, /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/ - at the end of syllables after /a/, /a/, /o/, lul.
[k] - at the beginning of syllables-in free variationwith [kw]before /a/, /a/, /e/, /i/
- at the end of syllables after/e/, /i/; after/a/, /a/ in free variation with [kw].17
[q] - at the beginning of syllables before /a/, /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/ - at the end of syllables after /a/, /a/, lo/.
There are unexpected irregularities in this distributional pattern. Thus, the sequences [qu] and [uq] do not appear in my material.18
17 A previous process of contraction that eliminates a front vowel may block this rule of free variation between [k] and [kw] after [a] and [a]. This is seen in ?imak'thing', which is a reduced form of ?imaayek,and t?a-k, a contraction of the aspectual morpheme t?at and the
subordinatingconjunction kyek. 18These distributional gaps may be accidental or may be due to the limited number of
words collected, but we should not exclude the possibility of their connection to some significant diachronic process. As for the sequence [qi], only one example has been found. Najlis (1984:13), in her description of the protolanguage, observes that velar and postvelar plosives occur only rarely before nonlow vowels, which may, according to Najlis, suggest that these consonants in an early stage were changed into palatals ("k', k, q > q"). Word-final [q] is supposed to have passed to fricative [x], which was subsequently dropped in position after [o] (1984:24). However, Najlis's material is generally very divergent from Noctenes.
It may be noted, also, that the following sequences are found in my word lists: [q?u] (as in ?nooq?use?'chin'),[qhu] (as in taqhuujwiyej'(s)he swells with it'), and [qhi] (as in qhiit?ah'it is not so').

Apart from these gaps, the analysis shows a complete distributional overlapping for [kw] and [q]. It is not surprising, then, to find also some (almost) minimal pairs, such as:

[?6:kwey?] 'my hand' [?6:qey?] 'my habit'

[tokw] [to:q]

'not' 'toucan'

It also appears that [kw] and [q] have an almost equivalently defective distribution, since none of them occurs syllable-finally after the front vowels. The obvious conclusion to be drawn is that this gap in their distributionin both cases is filled by [k]; in other words, [k] is a complement
of two, different phonemes. On the grounds of distributional evidence, it may be stated, then, that
there are two phonemes, /kw/ and /q/, and that each of these phonemes may change its phonetic characteraccording to the following rules:

(8) q -k kl {e, i}

$, i.e., a syllable-final uvular stop becomes

velar when preceded by the front vowels.

(9) kw -+ kl {e, i}

$, i.e., a syllable-final labialized velar stop

loses its labialization when preceded by the front vowels.

It is assumed here that the phonemes are primarily represented by [q] and [kw]. While the first rule reflects a natural assimilation, the latter

17

probably can be understood as a subsequent neutralization between [k] and [kw] in the position referred to.
In the following I shall discuss some furtherevidence of the reality behind these rules.
6.2.2. If our analysis is correct, it means that [k] is sometimes a realization of an underlying /kw/, whereas in other instances it represents/q/. In fact, it is possible to observe, in some cases, "traces"of such a relation:19

la+teen+ek la+teen+q+ayh

'his/her song' 'his/her songs'

yik yi[k]+eh yi[kw]+eh

'(s)he goes' '(s)he goes for it' '(s)he goes for it'

?i+wo+la+teen+e[k]+a? '(s)he performs his/her song' *?iwolateene[kw]a?

The form lateenek (literally 'his/her imitated') includes the participial morpheme -ek. In lateenqayh this morpheme has lost its e in position before the plural morpheme (h)ayh, and as a consequence, the stop has "regained" its uvular place of articulation.20We understandfrom this that
the participial morpheme has the underlying structure *-eq. This example seems to confirm rule (8) above.
Yi[k]eh is representative of a great many words where there is a sort of
conflict between the syllabic structure and the morphemic structure (yi$keh and yik+eh, respectively). In these cases two theoretically possible principles are opposed with respect to the phonetic realization of the segment between the syllable boundary and the morpheme boundary ([k] in yi$k+eh). The general question concerns the function of $ in this particular configuration.
We are now interested in the structure Vfront$C+V(which occurs in yi[k]eh), and we want to know if [k] or [q] would be chosen for C if C represents /q/. Recall that this phoneme is generally realized as [k] when occurringafter front vowels within a syllable (rule 8), and we may also state thata front vowel may precede [q] when a syllable and a morphemeboundary occur in the same place between them (as in ?ii$qatsih'(s)he is there').
Now, does the syllable boundaryalone block the influence from a front vowel when the following consonant is morpheme-final?The comparison with ?iwolateene[k]a?is crucial here. In this word the participialmorpheme

19For the discussion here I use phonetic representationsto distinguish between [k] and [kw] in syllable-initial position.
20 In Noctenes, this is not the usual plural formation for participles. Cf. ?nookyujwanek 'disciple', ?nookyujwanhayh'disciples', ?nootetnek'sign', ?nootetnhayh'signs'.

-ek is split by a syllable boundaryand again the sequence Vfront$C+Vis found. We know that C represents /q/; still it is realized as [k]. So, the answer to the question must be "no" or "not necessarily."
As a matter of fact, Noctenes also adopts the strategy of maintaining the actual, surface form of a morpheme across an interfering syllable boundary in most similar cases where this strategy involves the violation of certain syllable-related rules of sound distribution. The morpheme boundary in such configurations seems to be more powerful than the syllable boundary(see further6.3).21
This result deprives us of one possible clue to the interpretationof the phonemic status of [k] in yik and yi[k]eh. If [q] had been used in the C position of Vfront$C+Vin ?iwolateene[k]a? (i.e., if *?iwolateeneqa?had been an attested form), and if in the two examples compared here the velar articulation had been maintained only in the case of yi[k]eh, this would have been a clear indication that the velar stops of -ek and yik must represent different phonemes, and we would have assumed that [k] in the morphemeyik must belong to the /kw/ phoneme.
There remains, however, another factor to be taken into account,
namely, the possibility of a free variation between [k] and [kw] in the C position of the mentioned sequence. This kind of fluctuationmight be less likely to occur in cases where [k] represents/q/. Checking our data, we see that the form *?iwolateene[kw]a?,with a labialized velar stop in the participial morpheme,has not been attested, whereas yi[kw]eh is a documented word. (The latter is occasionally used by old people.) This difference must be considered significant, and the existence of yi[kw]eh gives us reason to believe that [k] in yik must be ascribed to the phoneme /kw/.22
21 This statement might seem contradictory to certain alleged phonological universals. Hyman (1975:196-97), referring to Chomsky and Halle, states that "the simple morpheme boundary + is incapable of blocking a phonological rule" and says that "this claim about the status of + has not been contradictedby any reportedlanguage."
22 Assuming that the participial morpheme is derived from *-eq, I consider the unattested form *?iwolateene[kw]a?improbable. I argue that one would not expect new forms with [kw] in a stage of development where the language is losing its labialized velar stop.
I do not, however, categorically exclude the form as a possible expression. I understand rule (9) about loss of labialization as a process of analogy subsequent to the assimilation expressed in rule (8). When that process has reached a certain level, it blurs the distinction between the two phonemes involved and a new analogy might work in the opposite direction, giving rise, occasionally, to unexpected forms with [kw].
To me it seems that even though the lack of documentation of *?iwolateene[kw]a?(and other comparable forms) is due to rareness, ratherthan absolute exclusion, this may still be
significant. It must also be borne in mind that what is presented here is a theory that is exclusively
based on synchronic data from Bolivia. The conclusions still need to be weighed-if possible-against historical evidence.

PHONOLOGICAL OUTLINE OF MATACO-NOCTENES

The argument may appear somewhat weak in this part, but it is based on my strong impression that regular free variation between [k] and [kw] seems to be blocked in some particularinstances. This is not too strange, if two phonemes are involved. The idea is, in our example, that if *yi[kw] is an underlying form, this form MIGHaTppearagain (which sometimes actually happens) when a syllable boundary comes between the front vowel and the stop, as in yi$[kw]eh. The appearance of *?iwolateene[kw]a? would represent a totally different process. While the shift of the stops in yik versus yi[kw]eh may be seen as a variation within a phoneme, the corresponding shift in lateenek versus *?iwolateene[kw]a?would represent a substitution of phonemes (/q/ -+ /kw/). The former is a restoration, the latter is a further step away from an underlying phonological unit.
6.2.3. In summary, the main point of 6.2 is that [k] cannot be phonologically separatedfrom /kw/ and /q/, but should ratherbe ascribed sometimes to one, sometimes to the other of these phonemes. This conclusion seems well substantiatedby the distribution of the phones [k], [kw], and [q] and by the alternations between these sounds found in forms like lateenek and lateenqayh, yi[k]eh and yi[kw]eh.
It has been shown that syllable-initial [k] may represent /q/ when it is immediately followed by a morpheme boundary, as in the last syllable of ?iwolateene[k]a?,but [k] has not been found in free variation with [kw] in these special cases.
It should be added that in the currentphonetic development, the loss of labialization is an increasing phenomenon and has reached a level where the phoneme is affected in all positions, except those adjacent to rounded vowels within the syllable (cf. table 2). Forms like yi[k]eh, ?oowu[k]e?,and ?oo[k]ey?-as opposed to yi[kw]eh, ?oowu[kw]e?,?oo[kw]ey?-are nowadays the more popularones. Parallelto this trend, [k] standsout as distributionally more and more complete and is increasingly occupying a position as the dominantexponent of one of the two velar stops of the language.
6.3. Velar and postvelar fricatives. The standpoint to be argued for in this section is that each of the three phonetic units represented by [x], [xw], and [h] also corresponds to a phonological unit.23When the distribution of these units is examined, it is seen that:
23 One seeks in vain for a symmetrical arrangementof the velar and uvular stops and fricatives. Whereas the stops are phonologically separatedon the basis of their places of articulation, the fricatives seem to be distinguished by means of the labialization feature. With the stops, the labialization has become a redundantfeature; with the fricatives, the place of articulation varies according to the position of preceding vowels. For the discussion of 6.3 (and also elsewhere in this paper) we do not need to distinguish between [x] and [X] (cf. "The Principles of the InternationalPhonetic Association" 1949 [1984]:13), but the reader should be aware that there is a clear phonetic difference between the fricative sound of, for

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AMERICAN LINGUISTICS

[x] occurs in syllable-final position (with a few special exceptions) [xw] occurs most frequently at the beginning of syllables [h] is predominantlyfound in syllable-initial position
From such distributionalcriteriait is clear that [h] and [xw] cannot be reducedto a phonemicunit,since bothoccurin the samephoneticenvironment:

Woohus 'my sponge' ?oojwus 'my fingers'

-haj jwaj

'DIMINUTIVE'
'word of address between women'

hoot 'soil, good earth' -jwoot 'bolas (sort of weapon)'

-hut 'push; assemble' -jwut 'rub;sharpen'

It also appears that [xw] must be phonologically separated from [x], since these sounds, in some cases, contrast in analogous contexts:

Ihej Iheejw

'of course, to be sure' (?)24 'its wing'

tajkya? taajwkya? pitaaj

'it comes down'
'(s)he weeps over it' 'it is long'

tajlhdameh 'only' lhaajwlhdyeh 'rapidly, violently'

taje? ?istaajwe? pitsaajeh

'when (who, which) a moment ago' 'chachalacha (bird)' 'it sounds'

The to some extent complementaryrelationshipbetween [x] and [h] must be furtheranalyzed,since, on closer examination,disturbingdeparturesfrom
their typical behavior are found (i.e., [x] is not always syllable-final, [h] is not always syllable-initial). As in the case of the velar and uvularstops, it is helpful to extend the analysis and include morphologicalinformation.

instance, ?aj 'your skin' and the corresponding one in tij '(s)he digs it'. In the groups of sounds represented in this paper by [x] and [xw], the nonlabialized fricative produced after [a] seems to come nearest to the uvular position.
Also, Hunt (1940:13) distinguished between [x] (j) and [xw] (jw) and, in addition,
specified fw as a feminine equivalent to masculine jw. 24 I am not sure of the exact meaning of this word. It is frequently used in answers to wh-
questions, as in: Hdats?i tadjtsih? Lhej ta tuunte?.'Whatis that (horizontal thing)? ... (it is)
a stone'.

As previously pointed out, a morpheme-final consonant may begin a syllable whose vowel belongs to the following morpheme (as in yi$k+eh). A specific condition for this formation is seen in the fact that the language, in spite of its required CV(C) syllable structure, has a series of bound (always suffixed) morphemes with initial vowel. As was also stated earlier, the final consonant of the first of the juxtaposed morphemes in these cases normally retains its phonetic value, regardless of the rules for distribution of sounds in the syllable. Consequently, a syllable which in this way contains a morpheme boundarymay have an initial sound that is otherwise not permitted in initial position. In fact, this is the only construction in which [x] may appear at the beginning of a syllable:25

taajah
taaijih
tdjej tdjo?

'this one (touched)'; with taj 'thing, PRONOUNan' d (n)ah 'DEMONSTRATItVoEuc: hed'
'that one (sitting person or upright thing)'; with taj (see above) and (n)ih 'DEMONSTRATIVEs:itting, vertical' '(s)he hits it with it'; with taj '(s)he hits it' and -ej 'with' 'it hits into it'; with taj (see above) and (h)o?'into'26

The same phenomenon is frequently observed when nouns are incorporated into verbs, as in:

?iwola?naayfja? '(s)he parries it'; with iwo ... (y)a? '(s)he does ... ACCUSATIVaEn'd la?naayij 'his/her way'
or in the formation of negatives:

niiptdja? 'it is short'; with nii... (y)a? 'THIRD-PERSONNEGATIONan' d
pitaj 'long'
In some instances, however, the language utilizes the opposite strategy. The syllable boundary then signals a shift, and the morpheme is changed or reduced:

honahdji? 'yesterday';with honaj 'afternoon'and (n)dji?'RECENT'

niisahes 'shoes'; with niisaj 'shoe' and -es 'PLURAL'

tihaj

'when (who, which) recently'; with taj 'SUBORDINATING

CONJUNCTIONa'nd (n)aj 'RECENT'

These examples appear to be related to the strong tendency of the language toward complementarydistributionof [x] and [h], and seem to ver-
ify that these sounds really alternateas if they were mutuallyexclusive. As to the forms honahdji?and tahaj, the choice of strategy may be motivated

25 I know of no case where [x] occurs word-initially. In one exceptional case, [x] seems to occur before [h](!) at the beginning of a verb stem: tajhianky?oye?'(s)he buries it'.
26 The word is used in the expression tdjo la?wet 'it is fulfilled' (literally: it comes (hits) into its place).

by dissimilation between the last two consonants of the words. Tahaj can be compared with taje? 'when (who, which) a moment ago'. Each word consists of the subordinatortaj and a temporal marker-(n)aj 'recently' and (n)e?'just now,' respectively. Nevertheless, the bordersegment is realized in differentways. (Tajnaj and tajne?are equivalent alternativesto the forms mentioned.)
Now, for a wider understandingof the relation between [x] and [h], we must also look at situations where [h] occurs at the end of syllables, which is, after all, not very unusual. It may be stated, in fact, that syllable-final [h] may contrast with other units, including [x], or with 0, in identical or analogous environments. This is illustrated by the following examples (in which the relevant parts of the words are underlined):

?ahaayaj ?ekhaahyaj ?aqaijyaj

'mistol-fruit' 'your faith' 'your joy'

?iihkya? ?ijkyah

'it remains' 'father (addressing)'

?onuuhihkya? 'I go down to...' ?noohikya? 'oar'

yahoohkya? 'it goes down, it is drowned' yahookyajwih 'it enters under it'

ya__enh yaahyenh

'make him/her drink!' 'make him/her speak!'

It is possible to show that syllable-final [h] in many cases is related to a process of vowel reduction in unstressed syllables:27

?nowaahin 'one allows it' ?nowaahnej 'one allows him/her (to do) it'

?noyaahin 'one looks at it' ?nooyahnek 'looked at by someone; mirror'

?olhaa?ikyuyuhat 'I make myself hunger; I fast' ?olhaa?ikyuyuhthen?'we fast'

The morphemeswahin 'allow', yahin 'look at', and hat 'CAUSATIVarEe'here reduced to wahn, yahn, and ht in certain forms. In this way an additional

27 The alternative (or historically intermediate)forms *?nowaahinej(unattested but possible), *?nooyahinek(unattestedbut possible), and Wolhaa?ikyuyuhathen(a?lso used) must be stressed on the last syllable. Note that ?nowaahin and ?noyaahinare phrase-internalforms
(see 7.3.3).

monosyllabic morpheme may modify a word without increasing the num-
ber of syllables. When the vowel is lost, the syllable structurechanges, so
that the resultant sequence of consonants is distributedover two syllables. Thus, in the examples given, the [h] must be assigned to the first syllable, and the process generates the structureCVh$CV(C) (where C may be replaced by CC).28 The same pattern is seen in the following words:

?onuuhkya? ?olaatehteh ?oniihihla?
?noopuhjwah ?noonowahyaj hi?weenhohlah

'I go down' 'I heard him/her long ago' 'I wait for it'
'brother, sister' 'fear'
'(s)he will give it to him/her'

One characteristic feature of this group is that syllable-final [h] is added to morphemes which in other compounds do not need that segment. Analyzing the above words we find nuu 'move', -e (first occurrence) 'DEIXIS/ TRANSITION', niihi 'wait', pu 'be born', nowa 'be afraid', and ho 'DATIVE/
DIRECTION'.
The final elements of the words listed above are also easily identifiable morphemes: kya? 'down' (as in nikyaatkya?'it falls down'), teh 'TIME/WITNESS' (as in ?okyacajteh'I bought it long ago'), la? 'DEIXIS/TRANSITION' (as in ?olhaa?ithatla? 'I support him/her'), jwah 'PARTICIPANT('this suffix indicates someone who shares the content of the preceding morpheme, as in Iheejwah 'the one who shares his/her name, his/her namesake'; con-
structed with Iheey? 'his/her name'), yaj 'NOUN-FORMINGSUFFIX' (as in ?noo?isyaj'goodness'), lah 'FUTURE'(as in ?okyaajlah'I shall buy it').
Thus, in all the listed words, the segment [h] seemingly appears between two morphemes.
If we look again at the morphology of the language, it is possible to conclude, however, that these words too have undergone a process of vowel reduction and syllable modification. Kya? is semantically identical to hikya?, and the suffixes la? and lah may also be preceded by hi. There is, in fact, a partly conditioned, partly free alternationbetween forms with and without hi.29 Compare the following words (with relevant mor-
phemes underlined):

28 [h] cannot be interpreted as initiating the second syllable. Sequences like hth in lhaa?ikyuyuhthen?'(s)he fasts', hyh ([hj]) in ?noohyhinek'woven fabric', and hh in ?nooqanihhayaj 'hope' must reasonably be divided by a syllable boundary.
29 In future or conditional verb forms, hi seems to express irrealis mood; in other cases I do not separate it as a morpheme.

?o+waat+la_?

'I need it'

naam+h+lah

'(s)he will come here'

naam+hi+ye+lah '(s)he will come here to...'

(In the third example, la represents future; h between morpheme boundaries comes from hi.)
Similarly, yaj may be interpretedas a reduced form of hayaj. Compare the following verbs and nouns:

?oniihi?

'I wait'

?ooqanihhayaj 'my waiting'

?oteelayit

'I endure'

?ootelaythayaj 'my endurance'

?aalhelhet

'you try yourself'

?alheelhtshayaj 'your trial'

From these data, it seems obvious that the sequences CVh$kya?, CVh$la?, CVh$lah, and CVh$yaj contain reduced variants of hikya?, hila?, hilah, and hayaj. In the process of vowel reduction, the initial [h] goes to the preceding syllable. ?o$nuu$hih$kya?'I go down to it' takes the place of *?o$nuu$hi$hi$kya?;?o$nii$hih$la?'I wait for it' substitutes for *?o$nii$hi$hi$la?;?no$t?e$khaah$yaj'faith' for *?no$t?e$khaa$ha$yaj.
Regarding ?olaatehteh, it seems to be the case also that [h] belongs to the suffixed temporal/witness relation marker (hteh). I draw this conclusion from the fact that when this suffix is replaced by another temporal marker,[h] is eliminated too, as in ?olaatendji?'I recently heard him'.
In contrast, nothing indicates thatjwah should be considered a reduced allomorph of the participant morpheme. In words like laky?eejwah 'his wife, her husband',Ihoojwah'his male fellow creature',and lasuujwah 'her female fellow creature',this morphemeis preceded by vowels, whereas in ?noopuhjwahan [h] is inserted.In the latterword, consequently, the aspiration should be attributedto the root morpheme(pu(h)).3
Obviously it would be possible to deepen this type of morphological analysis, to "explain" the occurrence of syllable-final [h] in many other words. For instance:

30 For the Bermejo dialect, Vinas Urquiza (1970:36) documents the form [o'pfunha].

share the same structuralfeature, but they are morphologically less transparent. So the analysis would have to be increasingly abstract, and hypothetical underlying structures would have to be introduced. For the last three words cited above, we cannot even judge, for certain, whether they
are morphemically divisible at all.31 At present, then, we are not able to determine whether syllable-final
[h], like syllable-initial [x], might be generally considered a morphologically conditioned deviation from the main phonological principles of the language-or if a previously established, more general rule promotes the ratherspecial arrangementsof morphemes and syllables dealt with in this section. (In view of the facts presented in 6.4, I think the latter alternative must be considered the more likely one.) In any case, syllable-final [h] currently represents an established phonetic structure, and even though the two phones, [x] and [h], to some degree alternateat the morphological level (so that [h] occurs at the beginning of morphemes and [x] at the end of morphemes), it is not possible to classify them as one and the same phoneme by means of formal procedures at the phonetic level.

6.4. Glottals in word-final position. The glottal sounds differ from the other consonants in their "loose" final position. When words like:
?atsiinha? 'woman' tuunte? 'stone' ?fihi? 'it is in . ..'

are brought together in utterances, the final glottal stop is regularly omitted in all cases, except in the last word of the continuous sequence. In

31 Correspondingto our maahse?, Hunt (1940:19) writes majse; VinfasUrquiza (1970:74) gives the form /'manse/.
In Bolivia, young Mataco people frequently pronounce a voiceless nasal [n] instead of syllable-final [h]. The older Indians emphatically argue for the [h] as more "correct,"considering the new trenda distortion.Their position is supportedby the morphological background outlined in this section. It is reasonable that the contact between [n] and [h] in, for instance,
t?ianhla? '(s)he sends for him/her'(with the morphemest?aan+hila?)should give rise to a [n], but it is equally naturalthat the loss of the last [i] in *?inuuhikya?leaves a syllable-final [h] in the form ?inuuhkya?T. his distinction is becoming neutralized in the younger generation.

other words, the word-final glottal stop occurs most often only before a pause. Compare the following sentences:

?is, ?atsiinha?.

'She is good, the woman'.

Haape ?atsiinha ta ?is. 'She is a good woman'.

?iihi tuunte?. Tuunte ?iihi?.

'It is in the stone'. 'There is stone in it'.

This is not to say that the glottal stop occurs only as a boundary-marking complement. In principle, it belongs to the isolated form of a word but is
omitted before another, immediately following word. Another category of words is phonetically characterized by its mem-
bers having a final [h]:32

?ohooyeh 'I go to him/her' ?ooqoh 'my mother' t?uukeh '(s)he looks for...'
leetse?nih 'chafar fruit'

This glottal element is also lost in accordance with the same rule:

?ohooye ?ooqoh.

'I go to my mother'.

Wetta ?is ?ooqowet, ?ohooyeh. 'Andas my motheris good, I go to her'.

T?uukeleetse?nih.

'(S)He looks for chanar'.

Leetse?ni ta ?yo?, tatuukeh. 'It is the ripe chanar, that (s)he looks for'.

The same, sometimes minimal, contrastbetween "open" (aspirated)forms and forms with a final glottal stop is also observed in many monosyllabic words and morphemes:

-hi? 'in, inside' -hih '(enclosing object like) bottle, bowl, boat, car, book'

-ho? 'into, out of; DATIVE' -(y)eh 'to, from'

ha? 'what (did you say)?' haah 'word of address between spouses'

-ma? 'sleep' maah 'go away!'

Recall that Noctenes has no words that in phrase-final position end
with a vowel. Irrespective of the phonological status of the final [h], a phrase-internalform like hi (which ends with a vowel in such position) must represent either (phrase-final) hi? or hih but may never itself consti-

32 My language consultants insisted on the existence of word-final [h] and did not accept my pronunciationuntil I consciously produced the sound.

tute a third alternative in a way corresponding to, for example, the En-
glish words see, seed, and seethe. Contraryto the general rule of glottal sound omission, there are some
cases where the glottal stop must be retained, or even added, within the phrase. The following sentence (from a tape-recordednarrative)gives two examples of obligatory word-final [?] immediately before following words:

Wet t?isaan+tso?

tha?,

?ii+jhi?

and his body DEMONSTRATIVEbut (TOPIC) it be in ?fi+hi?.

it be in

ta
SUBORDINATOR

'And his body remained where it was'.
The conjunction tha? (also thdayej; here a topic marker) is always preceded by [?] when this is phonetically practicable (i.e., when the preceding word otherwise terminates with a vowel, a semivowel, a lateral, or a nasal). The glottal stop is here added to a demonstrative morpheme that in its isolated form has a final [h]: tsoh. If tha? is replaced by wet, which gives the same meaning, the glottal stop is not produced (t?isaantso wet.. .). This phenomenon might indicate a process of reduction in the initial part of the conjunction itself,
?iihi?ta ?iihi?'it is where it is; it is firm, immovable' represents a common type of expression where the word-final glottal stop before the subordinator ta(?) cannot be eliminated. It probably indicates an omitted word. In this phrase, for instance, it would be possible to insert honhat 'place, earth'after the first verb, thus: ?iihi honhat ta ?wihi?'(s)he is in the
place that (s)he is in it' (literally translated), and, as seen, the "irregular" glottal stop is then lost.
In the following, similar clauses, the unexpected glottal stop occurs before the subordinatorkyek:

?ii+kye? kyek

?ii+kye??

it be at SUBORDINATOR it be at33

'Where might it be?'

Tal+hi?

kyek

it come from within SUBORDINATOR

?imaak+nah?

thing this (touched)

tdl+hi?, it come from within

'From where might it come, this thing?'

33 As a locative marker,kye?may indicate indefiniteness of place. ?iikye?is also used as an intransitive verb, in which case it means 'exist (third person)'.
The subordinatorkyek is used for irrealis mood, as opposed to ta?.

Compare also the following sentences: Naam hi?no ta ?is. he come man that he good 'There came a good man'.

Hi?no?, ta ?is. man that he good
'It is the man who is good'.

Pajkye+ne

taajwlhih.

already RECENT/WITNESSED(s)he cry

'(S)He has just cried'.

Pajkye+ne?

taajwlhih.

already RECENT/WITNESSE(D...) (s)he cry

'(S)He has started to cry (and is still crying)'.
The last clause would perhaps more correctly be written Pajkyenet? taajwlhih, and one possible explanation here would be that the glottal termination can represent t?at, a morpheme which modifies the action of the verb, giving it a continuous, less definite character.

7. Complex consonants.
7.1. General rules for consonant clusters. Noctenes consonant clusters, within the syllable, are generally restricted to combinations of glottal sounds with other consonants. This property of the language results in a great number of differently modified, complex consonants. The following rules apply:
(10) // and /h/ may occur after every other consonant which is not a fricative.
(11) /7/ may occur before voiced consonants and semivowels.
According to these rules, nonglottal, interglottal, and fricative-glottal combinations are excluded. P/ also does not occur before voiceless consonants, and /h/ may not precede any other consonant.34
34 The sequences jk ([xk]) andjh ([xh]) in the morphemesjkyah 'father'andjhan 'bury' are exceptional. When preceded by vowels, as in lajkyah 'his/her father' and tajhaanky?oye? '(s)he buries it', the velar/uvularfricative probablybelongs to the first syllable. Cases where these morphemes follow consonants seem problematic: Toomas-xkyah 'Thomas's father', ?otjh/anky?oye?'I bury it'.
The sequences [xh] and [sh] are normally reduced to simple fricatives even across a morpheme boundary:?ikyaj+hen?becomes ?ikyiajen?'(s)he buys them', ?is+hen?becomes ?isen? 'they are well'. See also 8, where some other exceptions are mentioned.

7.2. Modified stops and affricates. Rule (10) applies to all the stops and the affricate of the language. The addition of laryngeal sounds to these gives rise to complete, parallel series of glottalized and aspirated consonants (see table 3).
The Bolivian Mataco Indians pronounce /p?/, /t?/, /k?/, and /q?/ as glottalic ingressives (implosives), whereas the sounds with fricative release, /ky?/ and /ts?/, are glottalic egressives (ejectives). /k?/ may also be pronounced as a labialized, velar implosive.35 The glottalized and aspirated sounds are distributionally restricted to the beginning of syllables:6

p?aliitsaj tii? hik?ees
siky?uus
q?aataq ?noots?e?

'(s)he is poor' 'its sap' 'it cracks'
'sabalo fish'
'fly (insect)' 'stomach'

?oneepha? 'I stand up'

?noothi?

'upper arm'

t?ekhdayeh '(s)he believes him/her'

takyhuujwiyej '(s)he gets dizzy from it'37

qhaa?

'no (negative answer)'

Vitshaawet 'animal'

The very generality of rule (10), with the resulting congruity of the pattern seen in table 3, is an argumenthere for the view that the above complex consonants are phonologically clusters of phonemes. The existence

35 This possibility of labialization, which confirms the identity of the initial stop phoneme (/kw/) and alters the characterof the glottalized sound as a whole (hi[kw?]eeskye?versus hi-
[k7]eeskye?'it was rent'), is one feature that strengthens my belief that the glottalized stops should be considered clusters of consonant phonemes. There is no doubt about the velar position and the implosive articulationhere, but the sound does not occur frequently.
36 A nonreleased dental plosive occurs at the end of certain reduced forms (written t?):
t?et?(from t?et?a?)'NONWITNESSED',p?at?(from p?at?a?)'indeed!', hat? (from hdats?i?)'INTER-
ROGATIVEw: ho, what'. Also, when stops come into contact at syllable boundaries, the first one is pronounced without release, as in ?otkyuumlhih'I work', niiptdja?'it is short'.
37 This word contrasts minimally with takyuujwiyej'(s)he eats together with him/her'.

of the implosive velar, /k?/, and the aspirated palatalized velar stop,
/kyh/, appearsparticularlyimpressive. There is another factor that may help evaluate this question. If we look
at the lexicon and compare the numberof forms that begin with a glottalized or aspirated stop to those that begin with the corresponding simple consonant, we find a striking discrepancy. In all cases, there are many more forms that begin with the simple consonant. Thus, from the point of view of economy of features, it must be preferable to analyze these complex consonants as sequences of phonemes.38
There are also some interesting cases where morphemes that terminate with a stop are followed by a morpheme with initial /7/. One example is the word ?imaak?isit?ah'it is insignificant', which is made up of ?imak 'thing', ?is 'it is good', and hit?ah 'NEGATIONM'. y language consultants assured me that it is completely acceptable and normal to pronounce this word with an implosive velar, /k?/.
Note that syllables and morphemes are arranged in such a way that their boundaries nowhere coincide within this word: ?i$maa$k+?i$s+i$-
t?ah. That the consonants of the sequence /k+?/ coalesce to a glottalized sound is consistent with a more general phonological pattern of the lan-
guage (cf. 7.3.2).

7.3. Modified laterals, nasals, and semivowels. 7.3.1. With initial glottal stop. According to rule (11), the lateral, the nasals, and the semivowels may be preceded by a glottal stop. These clusters always occur at the beginning of syllables:
?laataj 'horse'39 ?iyee?lah 'tapir'
-?mdthi? 'TIME/WITNESS:today/not seen' ?ooqa?mo?'my wound'
?nazyij 'road' woo?nah '(kind of) bee'

?wuye? si?wook
?yom? ha?yaj

'chaguar (plant)' '(kind of) woodpecker'
'it (the fire) has gone out'40 'jaguar'

38 I have looked at this theory in the presentationof Hyman (1975:132-35). 39 This is an abbreviatedform of augmentative ?iyee?lataj'big tapir'. 40 Interestingly, the subject conjugation paradigm of the "[?y]-verbs"-in this case W?oyom(?first person), lat?om?(second person), ?yom?(thirdperson)-differs from the corresponding one for verbs with a simple stem-initial [y]; compare ?oyom 'I make', Ihom 'you make', yom '(s)he makes'. (The latter is used as a prefix with adjectives.)

7.3.2. Voiceless laterals and nasals. At the phonetic level, there are four voiceless nasals, [m], [n], [pj],and [orw],and one voiceless, fricative lateral, [1]. These sounds occur within morphemes in, for instance:
[mme?] 'TIME/WITNESSr:ecent/seen/habitual'
[?o6:nns] 'my nose' [tagyi:n] '(s)he weaves' [laojwd:y?]'its time' [lla:met] 'his/her word'
However, in other cases the voiceless nasals develop through contact between two morphemes, of which the second one begins with an [h]. When, for example, the plural morpheme hen? is suffixed to the verbal form yaam (used phrase-internally) '(s)he comes there' to form yaamhen? 'they come there', the bilabial nasal loses its voiced character and the word is pronounced [ya:mmen?]. When the same suffix is added to ?ilaan '(s)he kills it', a voiceless dental nasal arises; the resulting word ?ilaanhen? '(s)he kills them' is pronounced [?ila:nnen?]. When the noun ?imaayek'thing'is combined with the plural morphemeheyh (or hayh) the ending -ek is lost, and the palatal semivowel becomes unvoiced. The plural ?imaayheyhis pronounced [7ima:jPyey].In a similar way, /w/ becomes voiceless before an [h]. The plural form of towej 'pot' is towhaayh, which is pronounced [toqowa:y]I. n all these examples, the voiced counterparts of the voiceless sounds reveal themselves in the transitional stage immediately before the (voiced) vowel.
Analogously to the above forms, the voiceless lateral in, for example, [tdllo?] '(s)he comes out of...' might be derived from tal+ho? (with directional ho? 'out of'). But this is a mere reconstruction, since in current pronunciation among the Bolivian Mataco the voiced lateral only sporadically occurs in word-final position. The first morpheme is nowadays normally pronounced [tal]. What is significant, however, is that the voiced lateral, like other voiced consonants, never precedes an [h].41
One may conclude, then, that all the voiced consonants become devoiced under the influence of a following glottal fricative.42 As shown in
41 The lateralis notfundamentallydifferentfromthe othervoiced consonants.Also, thenasals and semivowels may be voiceless in word-finalposition, as, for example, [ya:m] '(s)he comes there'and [7ila:n]'(s)he kills it' (see further7.3.3). From this fact, an alternativeinterpretation of the voicelessness phenomenonhere would be possible. Takingydamhen?'theycome there'as an example, one could say thatit contains [y&:m+] [en?] (with -en?as a pluralallomorph;cf. n. 34) ratherthan[ya:m]+[hen7].But in this case, it would be difficultto explain why [ya:m]+[eh] becomes [ya:meh]('hecomes to ... there'),not *[ya:mrmeh]O. bviously,the suffixesareattached to voiced, notmodified,consonants,andnumerousexampleshaveconvincedme that[h] is a constituentpartof the voiceless lateraland the voiceless nasals of the language.

the examples above, the regressive effect from the glottal fricative extends over the morpheme boundary and transformsthe final sound of the previous morpheme. The [h] as such is lost, "hiding" itself in the fusion of the two sounds. The morphological division is obscured and does not correspond to the syllabic structure: [ya:$mmen?] versus yaam+hen? 'they come there (with plural hen?)', [to$jwa:y] versus tow+haayh 'pots (with plural haayh)', etc.43
There is also anothertype of revealing forms, in which devoicing is associated with a process of vowel reduction. Such a form is, for instance, nhaandyej ([nna:nayex]) '(s)he does not know it', which is a reduced variant of niihandyej. The morphemes involved are the third-personnegative affix nii ... (y)a(?) and the transitive verb han ... (y)ej 'know'. In a similar way, nhuumna?([nnu:mna?]) '(s)he does not like it' is a frequently used alternative to niihumina?, which is composed of the same negation morpheme and the verb stem humin 'like'.44 A slightly different example is seen in the dependent (inalienable) noun laqhaajyhayaj ([laqha:x.pyayax]) 'his/her power', where the consonant cluster yh, which is pronounced as a voiceless palatal nasal, must also originate from two consecutive morphemes. Here the vowel reduction must take place before the y, which becomes evident on comparison with the corresponding adjective taqhaajay? '(s)he is strong'. From the root included, the noun is constructed with the noun-forming morpheme hayaj. The plural form of the adjective, taqhaajyhen?([taqha:xpyen?]) 'they are strong', also demonstrates the same type of contraction. Still another type is found in, for example, ?iwoomhkya?([?iwo:mkyd?])'it is raining', where the /h/ of the morpheme hikya?'down' has been fused with the /m/ of wom 'throw',giving rise to a bilabial voiceless nasal.
It must be observed, also, that the devoicing phenomenon dealt with here includes, in some cases, an additional change with respect to the manner of articulation. Whereas the voiced approximants are produced like vowels, i.e., without noticeable friction in the mouth, their voiceless
counterparts-at least when occurring in syllable-initial position-are palatal or labial-velar nasals with complete obstruction in the oral cavity
43 When the plural diminutive suffix has is attachedto a morpheme(probablyrestrictedto a plural form) ending with the palatal approximant,the sounds are transposed so thatyh becomes hy. This is the only construction I know of where metathesis occurs instead of devoicing and fusion. Examples: ?iilehyas 'tuberculosis' (with ?iiley(h) 'your bones' and has), ?itshaatahyas'small animals' (with ?itshaatay(h)'animals'and has).
44 It has been pointed out that the reduction of a stressed vowel is highly unusual. As a matter of fact, there is some degree of vacillation with respect to the placement of stress here. The word is sometimes pronounced with final stress, niihumina?,which might be the more original form.

(stops). In word-final position, though, more open, just devoiced variants ([w] and [y]) may occur (see next section). The four voiceless nasals are pronounced with an audible blow of air through the nose, and the voiceless lateral is articulated with a soft friction at the side of the tongue.
To conclude this section, I want to highlight three points of my argument. First, if the voiceless nasals and the voiceless lateral were to be
interpreted as separate phonemes, the generalization stated in rule (10) would be lost, and one would have to accept that /h/ might not occur after the lateral, the nasals, and the semivowels. My analysis provides a naturalexplanation of this seeming gap in the distribution of /h/.
Second, notice that there is also an absolute absence of sequences of [C+voice+h].This is strange in the light of the general distribution of the sounds involved ([h] may occur at the beginning of morphemes; the voiced consonants may occur at the end of morphemes), but is also naturally explained when one recognizes [1], [m], [n], [gw], and [jo] as representing underlying /lh/, /mh/, /nh/, /wh/, and /yh/. This insight provides a significant increase in the understandingand description of the morphemic structureof the language.
Third,whereas a sequence of [C+voiceh]would probablynot be contained within one syllable, none of the sounds [1], [m], [n], [ow], and [j] may be split by a syllable boundary. From this follows that when juxtaposition of morphemes gives rise to a /C+voice+h/ sequence, the resultant devoiced consonant must either terminate the first syllable involved or initiate the following one. But since vowels are not allowed in initial position, the devoiced consonant can be ascribed to the former syllable only if the following vowel is dropped, as in [nd:m$1ah] '(s)he will come here' (from naam+hilah). Otherwise,it is included in the latter,as in [na:$qmmen?']they have come here' (from niaam+hen?).Such cases constitute practically inevitable instances of the common phonological principle of noncoincidence between syllable and morpheme boundaries.
The next section suggests further arguments for the divisibility of the voiceless sounds treated here.45
7.3.3. Followed by glottals in word-final position. On closer examination, it is found that word-finallaterals, nasals, and approximantsin position before pause as a general rule must be completed with either /?/ or /h/. This means that the voiced consonants in this respect group with the vowels.
45 A diachronic study and a comparison between dialects would also be particularlyinteresting from this point of view. For example, the Noctenes words ?oonhus'my nose' and honhat 'earth' correspond to /on'7us/ and /hon'?at/ in the dialect described by Vifias Urquiza
(1970:53-54).

As was shown in 6.4, words that have an aspiratedor open ending, like ?ooqoh and leetse?nih, contrast with words with a final glottal stop, like ?atsiinha?and tuunte?.It was also demonstratedthat this contrast is sus-

pended when words are pronouncedinternal to a phrase. This patternalso applies to the voiced consonants:

?o?yel?.

'I get tired'.

?o?yel ta ?oniihi?. 'I get tired when I wait'.

?olhaam?

'I'

?olhaamwet ?ohaanej.'I know it'. (Literally: 'I and I know it'.)

?itshaatayyikhen?. 'The animals go away'. Yikhen?itshaatayh. 'They go away, the animals'.

Hdats?i ta hi?weenh? 'Whom does (s)he see?' (Literally: Who that

(s)he sees him/her?)

Hi?ween laqoh.

'(S)He sees his/her mother'.

Tatay?. Tatay Ihimphaj.

'It is missing'. 'Very little is missing'.

Obviously, these complex consonants cannot contrast with the corresponding simple sounds in word-final position. As with the vowel case, opposition is possible only between "h-forms", i.e., devoiced [1], [m],
[n], [w] (or [w]), and [y] (or [j]), and "?-forms,"i.e., glottalized 1?,m?,
n?, w?, and y?:46

laky?uulh lanaamh lahuuminh
lalaayh Iheeyh

'its horns'
'you come' 'you like it' 'his/her cattle'
'its thorns'

hul? lhaam? t?ekhen?
lalay? Iheey?

'spear' 'he, she, it'
'they eat' 'you have had enough (to eat)' 'his/her name'

The system as a whole appears somewhat confusing and may be in a stage of change or decomposition. For example, the voiced, glottalized lateral, 1/, in currentlanguage usage occurs only rarely and is frequently replaced

46 Contraryto this case, there are syllable-initial sequences with /h/, i.e., devoiced consonants, which contrastwith the simple voiced consonants (such as ?ilaanhi?'(s)he kills it in it' versus ?ilhaanhi?'(s)he lights it (the fire)'). The glottal stop may not follow a voiced conso-
nant in syllable-initial position.

by voiceless lh. Instead of hul?, hulh may be used. W?oyeli?s being replaced by W?oyelhW. ord-final Ih is also more permanent than the other voiceless clusters and is nowadays usually not decomposed within a continuous chain of words. Only in exceptional cases, especially among older speakers, do forms like lhaamel 'they' (instead of lhaamelh) appearbefore an immediately following word.
However, when morphemes are brought together, the general rule is that morphemes that begin with a vowel can only be suffixed to the simple, voiced variants of the lateral, the nasals, and the approximants:47

?yilh ?yilej

'(s)he died' '(s)he died from it'

?nal?

'it appears (becomes visible)'

hi?naalit '(s)he reveals it'

?aam? 'you' ?ii?dmej '(s)he is with you'

yahaanh '(s)he follows him/her' yahaaneh '(s)he takes him/her there'

taahuy? '(s)he talks' taahuyej '(s)he talks to him/her'

8. Final comments on the glottal sounds. During the preparationof this paper the question was raised whether it would be possible to define phonetic [7] as a "low-level, phrase-final (not word or morpheme-final) phenomenon." To address this question, I would simply like to summarize my basic point of view.
First, irrespective of cases like hi? 'in' versus hih 'receptacle', I have classified [?] and [h] as separate phonemes of the language; compare, for instance, ?ap 'again' and hap '(ANAPHORIC:)then, there, that', ?o?is 'I am well' and ?oohis 'my receptacles', hoo?oh 'hen'and ?oh6oho?'I enter it'. [7] also occurs-like [h]-in syllable-final position, as in ma?jwaalahi? 'hare', ?ooqaye?jwaj 'my friend (between women)', waaclhaj 'rhea', too?pe?'brushwood',yaqaa?tu?'it is yellow', nii?thaya?'it is not difficult', tiyaaje?tsih 'forever', ?nooqa?tshayaj'war', naa?tshas 'children'. So, if [?] is a phoneme, why should it not occur as such at the end of words?
Second, as far as I can judge now, [7] and [h] behave phonetically in the same way with respect to their "loose" word-final position. Wordfinal [h] (after vowels and consonants) is also lost within the phrase. I

47 Tdlh+eh '(s)he comes from . . .' violates this rule. The word is probably shaped on the analogy of tal+ho? '(s)he comes out of...' and tal+hi? '(s)he comes from (within) ...'.

know of no independent criterion by which I could tell which of the sounds should be regarded as a word-final phoneme rather than a low-
level, phrase-finalphenomenon. More generally, the broad distribution of the glottal stop and the im-
pressive sensitivity with which the Mataco react to the use of this sound conflict with every theory that detracts from the phonemic character of the unit. In addition to what has been stated earlier in this paper, I have found a couple of words in which /7/ occurs syllable-internally before a voiceless stop or fricative: nee?ktshanaj'lewd', tee?ktshanlhih'(s)he follows his/her passions', ?uusyu?jw'it is small'.
Let me say, finally, that since my first contact with a Mataco Indian (in 1978)-who taught me the word hi?no?'man'but rejected my pronunciation because I failed to produce the final glottal stop-the system of word-final glottals (appearing and disappearing [h] and [?]) has been of major concern to me, and I still consider this problem-also for orthographic reasons-one of the most complicated in the Mataco language.
9. Conclusion. A phonologically adequate representationof Noctenes requires twenty-two symbols, corresponding to the phonemes specified in this paper. It is claimed here that the velar fricative, [x], is phonemically distinct from the glottal fricative, [h], and that [k] is an allophone of both /kw/ and /q/.
In addition to the phonemes, the following twenty-seven consonant clusters have been described:
?l, ?m, ?n, ?w, ?y k?, ky?, 1?, m?, n?, p?, q?, t?, ts?, w?, y? kh, kyh, Ih, mh, nh, ph, qh, th, tsh, wh, yh
This way of analyzing the modified consonants involves obvious advantages for the description and writing of the language. The number of phonological units is drastically reduced, and the phonological representation will maximally correspond to the morphological structure. The clusters reflect a strong language-specific tendency of the glottal sounds to cling to other consonants, and there are practically no other consonant combinations in Noctenes.
In particular, there are good reasons for claiming that the glottalized and voiceless laterals, nasals, and approximantsshould not be considered simple, "primitive"sounds. These sounds are likely to be intuitively conceived of by native speakers as complex but dissoluble units.
Phonologically, the voicelessness of these sounds (as well as the glottalization) does not representa reduction but rathera complication, originating from an extra segment, [h], that is added to a primary sound and

which gives rise to a different unit by a process of consonant coalescence. The complex sounds are generally reduced when word-final [h] and [?]
are lost in utterance-internalposition. Articulatorily and auditorily the voiceless sounds must be considered
weaker than the corresponding voiced ones. In accordance with natural assimilatory processes, this fact supports their usage in the transition from speech to silence and might suggest an explanation, too, for the cases observed where a word-final sequence of 1?is being replaced by Ih.
