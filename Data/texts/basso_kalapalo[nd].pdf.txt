Chapter 1 The Language and its Speakers
1. 1 Genetic Affiliation and History
The language called Kalapalo is one of two existing so-called subdialects of the Southern Cariban family (Meira and Franchetto 2009). This and most other labels for Cariban groups in the region are taken from both Cariban and Tupian names for past ethnolinguistic communities. The name Akuku, apparently taken from an ancient settlement, was at the time of my original research a self-reference used by these Cariban speakers. The name ‗Kalapalo‘ was originally given by local people to a very old settlement (etu). But from the time of the nineteenth century German explorer-scholars Karl von den Steinen and Herman Meyer, researchers and Brazilian administrators began collecting the names of such places, both to develop linguistic classifications and to estimate the local population. These names came to be used in an essentialist way, to refer to Alto Xingu ‗local groups‘ or even ‗tribes‘. By the second half of the twentieth century, ‗Kalapalo‘ was sometimes used in self-reference when speaking to outsiders. Finally, ‗Kalapalo‘ came to be used more recently by the residents of the settlement called Aifa (‗ready.done‘) in self-reference, as a radio tag.
Other Southern Cariban sub-groups spoken in the region are called ―Nahukwa‖, ―Matipu‖ and ―Kuikuro‖. Nahukwa (probably taken from the name of a historical community Aŋafukua but more recently referring to the survivors of the southwestern community of Dyagamu) is most closely related to Kalapalo. The pair Matipu (from the local Tupian name, Matipuhy; referring to surviving members of the old settlement Wagifїtї) and Kufikugu (‗many kufi fish‘) together constitute the other sub-dialect. Differences between all four of these subdialects are not yet entirely clear, as only Kufikugu and Kalapalo have been studied. All four names came to be used by local residents of the Alto Xingu under the influence of Portuguese-speaking administrators and anthropologists. However, the more proximate community affiliations of residents are still used to refer to individuals, regardless of their language affiliation.
Recent comparative phonological analysis by Sergio Meira and Bruna Franchetto has led to the conclusion that Cariban languages found south of the Amazon should be divided into three groups, which they call Kuikuro, Arara-Ikpeng, and Bakairi. The latter two sub-groups are deemed related, while Kuikuro is considered an independent sub-branch. (Meira and Franchetto 2005). As Kuikuro is today a local word for a particular

2
residential-dialectical group, I prefer the more cumbersome but accurate ‗Alto Xingu Cariban‘.
Currently, there are approximately 1200 speakers of Alto Xingu Cariban sub-dialects living in a number of local communities on both sides of the Culuene River, a majority headwater tributary of the northern flowing Xingu River. People calling themselves ―Kalapalo‖ number approximately 500 and reside in three communities on the protected reserve in the Alto Xingu basin called the ―Xingu National Reserve‖. Kalapalo also live in small local Brazilian communities, particularly the town of Canarana, and in the city of São Carlos, in São Paulo state, where they attend school in a special program coordinated by anthropologists. A special literacy program organized by Brazilian academics in the late 20th century has encouraged literacy in local languages and has probably had an important role in maintaining indigenous language use. But while Kalapalo is still spoken by children and youths, the language has been increasingly supplemented by Portuguese not only in contacts with outsiders but as a local lingua franca since about 60 years ago; Portuguese is used in many situations within the reserve, where there are speakers (in the southern region) of four or five mutually unintelligible languages sharing a common culture. Speakers of at least three other languages do not participate to any extent in this cultural context but have some contact with groups in the southern region. Ritual genres are still performed by residents of the Alto Xingu, and there have been efforts to record and preserve little known ceremonial practices (e.g., as in Marina Herrero, Ulysses Fernandes, Joao Veridiano Franco Neto 2006). However, outside of the large scale ceremonial gatherings involving people from many different communities and focused upon the life-status events of hereditary leaders, youths are less interested than in the past and their attention has turned to new media (tv, email, Facebook and other social network sites).
The ‗Kalapalo‘ as seen in recent times appear to be an amalgamation of several different community groups (otomo), the members of which came as survivors after disease or attacks by enemies decimated their populations. Some of these people, having been raised in communities speaking Arawak or Tupi languages, came to use the particular variety of Southern Cariban in use by the majority of residents (and in particular their leaders), but as is clear from their children, still alive during the period of my research in the 1980‘s, kept speaking their own languages in some circumstances. The second problem with the idea of ‗the Kalapalo‘ as a distinct language group is that the people themselves often use this word in self-reference when speaking with outsiders, to the extent that the name has become a kind of

3
label used to distinguish them from other local settlement groups. Closely connected with this local usage seems to be a newly developed sense of a distinct identity that appears to be the result of actual multigenerational continuities, due to the population recovery that began to emerge after a devastating measles epidemic in 1954.
1.2.Linguistic profile
Kalapalo is a highly agglutinative language with minor tendencies towards some fusion due to pervasive vocalic elision at morphemic boundaries and to the resultant syllable reduction. There are also some fusional morphemes, particularly involving plurality with aspectual inflectional suffixes. However, there are usually clearly recognized internal morpheme boundaries and most affixes have syllabic autonomy. There are frequent word class changing derivational processes which result in somewhat flexible word class functioning, but predictable word orders and inflectional and derivational features usually allow easy identification of members of these classes. There are twelve basic word classes in Kalapalo; some of these have subclasses. The two largest and open classes verbs and nouns- are subject to derivational processes, as are adverbs, the next largest class. The smaller, closed classes include clitics, demonstratives, ideophones, expressives, adjectives interrogatives, discourse particles, deontics, and a connectorVerbal inflections include absolutive person prefixes as well as following: middle voice diathesis prefixes, the reflexive and thetic t-, contrastive, and valence decreasing object-backgrounding prefixes. Verbal suffixes form an elaborate set, including indicative aspectual and irrealis suffixes, causal and permissive valency increasing suffixes, and plural concordance suffixes referencing intransitive subject (S) and transitive object (O) alignments. There is a separate plural suffix for transitive subject (A) arguments.
Nouns can be inflected for syntactic oblique semantic directional cases, in possessor-possessed constructions with pronominal prefixes (with possession suffix), and one or more of a large number of nominalization suffixes including derivational markers of nominal aspect. Adverbs may be inflected with adverbial suffixes and derived from both verbs and nouns. Other morphemes—such as the primary topical participant –fa, the relative clause modifier –tsï and the subclasses of epistemic, affective, and locative clitics—may be hosted by morphemes associated with all three of the major word classes. Kalapalo is mainly an ergative language, though ‗ergativity‘ has been shown to have non-agentive ‗causal‘ meanings in Southern Cariban (Franchetto 2006; 2010). There are several minor splits. The first is conditioned by

4
illocutionary force. My data show a split between the nominativeaccusative hortative and imperative; and the ergative-absolutive in all persons in the indicative and interrogative illocutionary force. The second split involves valence-decreasing structures. Inverse marking and object-backgrounding structures are nominativeaccusative; direct marking of arguments on finite verb phrases are ergative-absolutive. Finite transitive clauses follow OV constituent order with the ergatively marked A postposed in the clause; while object-backgrounding and intransitive clauses follow SV order. Marked transitive clauses in which the transitive subject is fronted for pragmatic reasons, follow AOV order. Adverbial clauses generally precede main clauses. There are two types of non-finite verb constructions: the thetic, and the supine. The thetic may preserve the S or A argument of the verb.
Kalapalo is a predominantly suffixing language, with a smaller number of prefixes. There are several semantic types of clitics, all of which include a large number of morphemes. Some of these may act independently as lexical particles. Word stems include root+ radical combinations, the latter specifying world class function. Many (but probably not all) roots seem to be preclass forms, needing to be derived through the ―first level‖ infixes for transitive/intransitive verb, noun, and adverb functions. There are several ―second level‖ derivational paradigms through which words of one of these classes can become associated with any of the two other classes. There is pervasive use of derivational affixes involved in nominalization, renominalization, verbalization, and adverbialization. Inflectional and derivational paradigms are large, and as I have just mentioned, many root and stem morphemes can cross word class boundaries. While most morphemes in the language have their own distinctive functions or meanings there are about 4-5 homophonous suffixes and polyfunctional derivational affixes. Some multifunctional homophonous morphemes cross word class boundaries. Kalapalo, a head final language, exhibits mainly head marking, but also some dependent and adjunct marking.

Kalapalo displays several interesting typological features. - Prosodically, it is rare insofar as second syllables of phonological words are stressed. - It is a split-ergative language with splits conditioned by illocutionary force type and valence. Imperatives and valence-decreasing structures are nominativeaccusative. All other structures are ergative-absolutive. - There is a large set of epistemic clitics, which must

5
be distinguished both grammatically and semantically from the much smaller set of evidential suffixes. - Evidentials express the relation between a speaker and the source of traditional knowledge: inherited through hereditary leadership status, customary or traditional knowledge shared by all who listen to storytelling, and personal knowledge that has been passed down directly to the speaker by other authorities. - There is a copula suffix as well as several roots which appear in both copular and regular intransitive constructions, in de-verbal nominalizations, adverbializations, and a limited number of types of auxiliary verb constructions. - There are several sets of demonstratives. One set of demonstratives may be used to reference a noun phrase as S or A of a verb, but only when that verb (which may be a copula) is in irrealis anticipation aspect inflection, and further only when the noun phrase is fronted before the verb in a focalization process. Additionally, that verb may have been nominalized. - As with other Cariban languages, word-class changing derivations involving verbs, nouns and adverbs are pervasive. A subset of derivational de-verbal and renominalized noun forms have perfective and imperfective aspectual properties. These and other nominalizations may preserve S and A arguments of their verbs. - There is a perfect aspect in the active equative root in copular verb constructions. - There is a large set of interclausal reference marking clitics that are involved with clause chaining. Interclausal reference marking has both shift-reference and cross-clausal semantic functions. - Kalapalo is a tenseless language. In addition to the de-verbal nominal perfective and imperfective aspectual inflections, the active equative copular perfect and several purposive complement clause constructions allow for expression of futurity in the absence of such a tense marker. Reference to distant or recent ‗past‘ events may occur with several epistemic clitics.
1.2. 2 Linguistic Registers
Kalapalo speakers make use of two major distinctive registers. The first is associated with affinal civility, and includes name avoidance and the use of several morphemes distinctive to the

6
register. Morphemes that develop a sense of personal humility and modesty are common in this register (Basso 2007). The second register is what is called ‗leaders talk‘, used by hereditary leaders in multi-community ceremonial gatherings focused upon life-cycle events in leader‘s lives (marriage, youth ear-piercing, memorializing dead leaders). This is characterized by special speech rhythms, evidentials referencing leaders‘ inherited knowledge, pervasive reference to past leaders, and also involves morphemes emphasizing humility and personal modesty (Basso 2009). Finally, baby talk and men‘s whistling are minor registers in use in daily interaction.

1.3. Alto Xingu Society and History

In lowland South America, centuries of brutal invasion,

occupation, and enslavement by Europeans, as well as the repeated

decimation of populations that resulted from newly introduced

diseases, repeatedly led the survivors to flee from the centers of

European expansion to explore new places where they hoped to

settle. As these refugees encountered one another, mutual fear and

distrust sometimes resulted in violent conftrontations. Yet once

the sheer immediacy of survival was ensured, some of these

refugees tried to peacefully establish contacts leading to beneficial

relationships, often integrating themselves into existing

communities and adopting local cultural forms, as apparently

happened when Cariban speakers entered the Alto Xingu, occupied

by Arawak speaking communities (Heckenberger, 2001; 2005).

Thus, as happened in the Alto Xingu, people from very different

kinds

of

communities,

often

speaking

different kinds of languages, were able to establish new allegiances

and identities that transcended their own particular groups, forming

very new kinds of societies that seem to have been strategic

responses to the new conditions imposed upon them. Although not

always successful, such undertakings must have involved extended

and patient efforts, during which people subjected held notions of

moral commitment and obligation to particularly intense scrutiny.

Ideas regarding commitment to a newly forming community, the

organization of labor, exchanges of goods for trade, relationships

with parents and with in-laws, such crucial matters as what one ate,

the weapons one used for killing people and animals, the labels one

used to identity oneself (and one‘s enemies) and above all, the

typical demeanor required of men and women in their relations

with one another all reflected upon what it meant to be a member

of a newly formed moral community.

7
During the time of my research, the Kalapalo told stories that inform us of the specific character of events leading to their ancestor‘s incorporation into such communities. Local people focused attention upon one another and also inwardly, upon their own communities. Europeans, most remembered for their slaving raids in the Alto Xingu, were not however the only people who were present to be resisted and commented on, but other indigenous people. New challenges to values and especially notions of the public self and its duties developed. People created new social forms out of remnant, refugee groups who were forced away from their homelands, often finding themselves in violent confrontation with others they encountered. The Kalapalo stories have much to teach us about what happened to people during such time of disorientation and what it felt like to participate in events of those times.
While the Kalapalo did not appear to make use of an abstract notion of an Alto Xingu ‗society‘, they did see themselves participating in a larger moral whole, an ethical community, which was made to stand in marked contrast with the formerly hostile groups (called aɳikogo, ‗fierce people‘) in the region and who, it seemed, once surrounded them.
Alto Xingu communities are relatively permeable and all settlements include at least some people who were born elsewhere (and who are identified with other places and languages). Some of these people left their natal settlements to marry, others have been forced to flee after witchcraft accusations. Such people joined relatives in more distant places when that was possible. Yet others, now deceased elderly people, were the last survivors of communities that had been decimated by disease prior to the early 1960‘s. Since people have been moving around in these ways for generations, most Xinguanos participate in multiple and crosscutting relationships both within their own community and elsewhere. These ties form a network extending into every Alto Xingu settlement.
More recently, relationships with these other communities have changed as the local environment has been seriously degraded by cattle ranching in the immediately surrounding area. For example, men can no longer gather land snail shells used for ritual ornaments in territory long used for that purpose, but are now bought from the Shavante, who live to the east of the Alto Xingu and often met with in the Brazilian town Canarana.
1.3.1. Kalapalo language attitudes and language interaction
Residents of the Alto Xingu typically associate their communities (and especially their hereditary leadership) with particular single

8
languages and claim to only use those languages in public contexts. It was indeed the case that during the time of my research many people knew at least something of other local languages but most were basically monolingual. In some cases individuals, born into one community but resident in another (by virtue of marriage or resettlement away from a home community due to a witchcraft accusation), are bi- or even tri-lingual, although the latter is quite rare. Additionally, Brazilian Portuguese has long been used, with varying degrees of competence, as a lingua franca among speakers of the different local languages.
Integrated into most people‘s speech are words from other languages the Kalapalo use in various ways. Because of a requirement to avoid the names of relatives by marriage and those of the dead that have not been passed on the grandchildren, people often use words in the local Arawak and Tupi languages, or in Portuguese, as substitutes for the Cariban proper nouns.
There are also many instances of foreign language citations used by narrators who may be able to translate some words in another language that appear in songs they are quoting to a listener. I propose that citation forms, extracted from songs learned by rote, are the first stage in a process leading to incorporation of ―foreign‖ words into the local language. These have most likely already been modified in the songs, to accord with local phonological rules. The following are some such citation examples from a narrative: the speaker is a woman who has been asked by her husband to quote a song that women sing in connection with the narrative he is telling us. After she sings, she then tells us:
1. ikine - feke fegei nuGikidyu Ø-ta=i-feke bread-ERG DEM (foreign word) tell to-CI=3-ERG ‘nugikidyu‘, she was saying that to them about bread.
2. kuigiku-feke fegei nukaidyafinunitsa, Ø-ta=i-feke Manioc.Soup-ERG DEM (foreign word), 3-CI=3-ERG ‗nukaidyafinunitsa‘, she was saying that to them (about) manioc
soup
It seems the citation in line 2 is really something more complex than a simple noun but since the speaker doesn‘t speak the language of the song in question, she can only repeat some important words, probably with some Kalapalo phonological changes as well.
As the citation example shows, non-Cariban songs are an important source of linguistic material for Kalapalo speakers. Many ritual songs performed by the Kalapalo, are described by them as ―Mehinaku‖ (referencing a local community of Arawak

9
speakers); some are also Tupi. While most Kalapalo do not appear to understand the full content of these songs, many people can ―translate‖ noun-like content into Kalapalo. Usually these are single features treated as independent words (though they may not be such in the original song). The ―translations‖ are in what could be called ‗citation‘ forms, as they are not inflected. However, these forms are very often heard in actual use, incorporated into full Kalapalo utterances
Because of the importance of the affinal civility register, which involves avoidance of the names of certain relatives (some child names may be of natural species or ordinary household objects) , many such ‗ordinary‘ words are prohibited to most speakers. Therefore, words from other languages (including Portuguese) are also interesting to Kalapalo speakers because they are very useful to them in these situations. Thus a second stage of this language contact process probably involves substituting ―foreign‖ words for Kalapalo words in affinal civility situations. Portuguese names are now frequently used as older names become ‗used up‘ by an increasing population.
Finally, such ‗foreign‘ lexemes eventually acquire local grammatical functions (as for example, serving as complex noun roots) and are incorporated into the language when they are correctly grammaticalized. An example follows in which the Portuguese word cobertor, ‗blanket‘ is integrated (in Kalapalo pronunciation) into a clause chain construction, cliticized with an interclausal reference marker that serves a clause coordinating function:
3. lepene mbokï, Agifigu-na kombetoh=mbembale. afterwards (sound of placing item), Agifigu-ALL blanket=SSCAT.
kombetoh, ñalï-ma fu-nïmї-i-t≈i-feke. blanket, NEG-EM know-CONS-EV≈3-ERG ‗Later on mbokï, he put down before Agifigu a blanket as he had done with the others. A blanket, they say he didn‘t know what it was.‘
1.4. Research Conditions and Data
My original dissertation research among the Kalapalo began in the settlement called Aifa in 1966 where I lived until 1968, working on anthropological topics. Since that initial period of work, I returned in the Alto Xingu 1978-82, and again in 1998. I have always resided with several families in their communal residences (the

10
Kalapalo preference as well as my own), and traveled with Kalapalo to all the local communities during my stay, as well as to their old settlement sites.
I was originally trained in social anthropology at the University of Chicago during a time of serious criticism of the structuralist-functionalist approaches, and had a long-standing interest in relations between language, psychology and culture. During my earlier work, my Kalapalo assistants first listed parts of the house and names of plants and animals as a way of teaching me their language, but some also began to tell me traditional narratives, encouraging me to write down their words with what translations they could give me. It was this experience that led me to prepare a project involving the taping and transcription of these narratives between 1978-82 with the goal of preservation and translation. The patient help of my many Kalapalo assistants, particularly those whose ability to speak Portuguese enabled those early rough translations, was inestimable. Later my work on affinal civility and other forms of ritual discourse observed during ceremonial gatherings stimulated my interest in Kalapalo epistemic marking, evidentiality, and their relationship to stance processes This in turn led me to begin serious work on Kalapalo grammar. The present work is thus the result of a decades-long inquiry, in the main based upon the narrative materials that I recorded, and which were translated by me and several Kalapalo assistants in their communities. . These recorded data have been preserved at the University of Texas Archives of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America (AILLA) organized by Professor Joel Sherzer, and sponsored by the National Science Foundation.

Chapter 2 Phonology

2.1. Segmental Phonology

Kalapalo has a large inventory of phonemes, including twenty-one consonants (of which four are allophones) and six vowels. Three consonants are co-articulated, and there are three consonant clusters. Compared with other Cariban languages this unusually high number of consonants is motivated by allophonic voicing contrasts, a uvular allophone, and to a lesser degree, the inclusion of two fricatives and two affricates . It is possible these consonants appear due to contact with the local indigenous Arawak languages (from which many ritual terms originate) and with Brazilian Portuguese spoken in the Alto Xingu region. The first of

these fricatives sh [ʃ] was attested during my early research in 1978 for only one word taken from Brazilian Portuguese, but may now be

more common. The second of these, ž [ʒ], appears in at least one

name of a ritual practice associated with Arawakan speakers. The

third is an affricate /č/ attested from the use of a Portuguese loan-

word. Nonetheless, these consonants also appear as onsets in

ideophonic constructions., The number of vowels on the other hand

is comparable to the inventory of other Cariban languages (Gildea

ms; Meira and Franchetto 2005). Bruna Franchetto, who includes

“Kalapalo” as a subdialect of her general category of Alto Xingu

Southern Cariban “Kuikuro” (Kufikugu in more recent spelling in

some publications), attests 14 consonants and six vowels (Meira and

Franchetto 2005).

The basic syllable pattern in Kalapalo is (V)

CV. Initial (V) in a word is often dropped unless it forms the core of

a pronominal prefix; final (V) at a morpheme boundary is highly

subject to either regressive or progressive elision (according to

stress) (marked ≈ in all examples in this grammar). A restricted

syllable pattern is CVC. This is ideophonic only, with a final

lamino-palatal /m/ or an alveo-palatal /k/, a checked consonant

(marked with „).). In addition there are instances of syllabic

reduction within the grammatical word associated with vocalic

elision. These are noted where relevant in the text commenting on

particular examples.

2.1.1. Consonantal inventory

Kalapalo uses voiced and unvoiced stops, a voiced uvular flap,
voiceless and voiced fricatives, voiced affricates, nasals, one lateral,
and a semi-vowel. In addition, there are four co-articulated consonantal segments: a voiced post alveolar palatal stop (dy, written dy); a voiceless dorso-velar stop (kw); a voiced velar stop (gw); a prenasal voiced bilabial stop (mb, written mb) ; and three consonant
clusters involving an initial nasal consonant followed by a voiced
allophone of an unvoiced post alveolar stop; velar stop; or alveolar
fricative. The voiced uvular stop and flap are allophonic. These
consonantal segments are all shown in Table 1. Where the practical
orthography uses notation different from that of IPA, the latter is

12

included in square brackets. Where Franchetto‟s practical Kuikugu orthography is different from mine, her usage is included in plain brackets. The material in Table 1 indicates that bilabials (5), velars (5) and post-alveolars (8) are particularly common, as well as voiced and unvoiced contrasts. Kalapalo consonants only occur in onset, never coda; /h/ which often occurs in coda position appears to be an aspirant.

In the following examples, primary stressed syllables are marked with '. (.) marks a syllable boundary. 1. /p/
a. as onset: 'pi.dyu, name for a ritual mask; 'pu.pu, „great horned owl‟; 'a.pa „my father‟ (vocative); wi.gi'paŋ.a.gï, ‘my ear‟

2. /t/ a. as onset: ta.ta'ke.ge.ni, „four‟; ti'ku.Gi, „small parrot‟; 'tu.ku, „gourd‟; a'taũ, ‘ carrying basket‟; uŋ'a.ta „inside the house‟

3. /k/

a. as onset: 'kui,gi,‟manioc‟; 'ka.ŋa, „fish‟; ko'gopiñe, „we are return-ers‟; a'kiŋ.i „false scorpion‟; -'a.ke, „comitative‟ b. as coda:

4. / kw/ : In this co-articulated consonant, the first element is dominant.

13
a. This phoneme cannot appear as the initial element, and only appears in the medial position of initial VCV syllables following /u/: ukw'a.ŋi, „let‟s wait‟; Ukw'a.ka, woman‟s name; ku.kwe'ta, „we‟re going to get; ; =mukwe, ‟in vain‟ b. There are many examples of this phoneme being associated with a reduced syllable, as in the construction wherein the lexical adverbial ekugu, „fully‟ is followed by a morpheme with /a/ initial:
i. ekugu hosts the conformative clitic apa: ekugu=apa (fully=conformative) →ekukw≈apa
ii. ekugu hosts the comitative suffix ake: ikugu-ake →telo-a ikw-ake
5. /d/ post-alveolar voiced stop a. as onset: 'da.fa, „dove‟ Da‟ga, man‟s name
b. /d/ also appears co-articulated in the environment of the nasalized consonant /n/, as nd (see 8. and Section 1.1.2.3 on consonantal clusters for more discussion)
6. / g/ voiced velar plosive a. as onset followed by /e/: ge'ha.le, „again‟ 'a.ga, „large lizard‟ e'fi.gï, „your grandson‟ ke'kige'fa, „let‟s not go any further‟ Taɳgugu-kai, „on the Taɳ' gugu‟ aɳ' ikogo, „fierce people‟ i'gei, inanimate identificational demonstrative
7. /G/ This is an allophonic variation of /g/. It is a very strong uvular flap, first described by Bruna Franchetto (personal communication). This articulation seems most usual when followed by /a/, and is especially strong at onset for some speakers when followed by /i/, but there does not seem to be consistency in this regard and more statistical analysis is needed. It is interesting to see a serial articulation ranging from the more open articulation manifested by (6) through the tightened articulation of igei through examples in (7).
a. as onset followed by /e/: U'Getsu, woman‟s name o'ko.ge.tsi, „tomorrow‟
b. as onset followed by /i/: 'Gi.tï.gï, ‘the head‟ a'Gi:,‟skin disease‟ mu'Gi.ki, „grubs‟ a'Gi.Gi, „giant anteater‟, also, a bird name i'gei foGu, „always this‟

14

u'agGiɳo, „(a person) like me‟
In the following example, the speaker co-articulates a glide-like sound, much like the voiceless velar initiated sound in (4). Although this is repeated by the speaker, I do not currently have other examples of this usage and have not included it as a feature in Table 1.
j. afїtї≈Gwe-la denial 1-NEG „No, not me.‟
8. / mb/ : Prenasal bilabial voiced stop. The second element is dominant
a. as onset: =mbe.le: interclausal reference marker (clitic); 'Amb.o, woman‟s name
9. /f/ [ɸ] Tthis voiceless bilabial fricative has two allomorphs. The first, written /f/, has clear bilabial friction; the other shows less friction, more open mouthing and expelled aspiration. The latter should be interpreted as different from the phoneme /h/, whose pronunciation at onset is ingressive while aspirated and which cannot appear as onset except in ideophonic constructions.
a. 'fa.la, „mud cakes‟ (ritual item) fũ, „two headed (blind) snake‟ i'fa.nda, „comb‟, „centipede‟ i'faũ, ‘the cousin‟ a 'fa.sa, „forest monster‟ e'ke.ge.'fu.ŋu, „resembling the jaguar‟ tu'afi, mat strainer

10. /s/ voiceless alveolar fricative

a. as onset:

saɳ’a.ka.fi, a species of tall bamboo 'su.su, „pineapple‟ si.so'a.nï.gï, „completion of 3person‟s dry season‟ 'so. ''lo, „manioc cracker bread‟ 'si.ke, „tocandira ant‟ 'se.ga.ti, „that same place‟ is'aŋ.a.gï, „ 3person‟s genipapa (fruit)‟ i 'so.a, „dry season‟

This phoneme is voiced as /z/ in the environment of preceding nasalized consonant /n/ (see section 1.1.2.2).

11. /ts voiced post-alveolar affricate

a. as onset:

'its.u, „creek‟ i'tsa.he.ne, „3rd person‟s younger sister‟ i'tsu.fi „3rd person‟s clearing‟ i'tsaŋ.a.gï, „3rd person‟s fish catch‟

15

tsitsitsi, ideophone representing the ticking sound of a wristwatch.

12. č voiced velar affricate

This phoneme occurs as onset in ideophonic constructions: čiu čiu čiu čiu, „clearing brush‟ čiuk bom, čiuk bom, čiuk bom, „tearing bark off a tree trunk and dropping the pieces to the ground

There is one indigenous lexeme: apiči „grandson/grandfather‟.

č/ is also attested from a loan word from Portuguese, in one speaker‟s use: 'mbu.či.na from P. 'bo.ta, “boot”.

13. /h/ glottal voiceless fricative

Considering that /h/ is the only consonant that occurs in coda

position, it seems likely that that word final /h/ is actually phonetic,

resulting from aspiration.

14. /z/ This appears to be an

allophone of /s/ (10), appearing voiced after the nasal consonant /n/.

See Section 1.1.2.2 concerning consonant clusters for examples.

a. as onset: he‟ yes (simple agreement); this is an ingressive aspirated fricative. The unusual character of the phonemic inventory of the word (including the final glottal stop) suggests the word is an epistemic expletive.

b.as coda?: egressive aspiration as in eh 'he: very well (agreement response). It is common with expressives, such as akah, „frustration‟, koh, „unknown‟, u:ma:h, „lack of understanding‟.

15. /sh/ [ʃ] post-alveolar voiced fricative 1. As onset in the ideophonic construction for the sound of a snake: shiiiiiiiii 2. /sh/ was also used at the time of my research in 1978-82 only in borrowed words: sha 'vã.shi, the name for “bottle gourd”, from “Shavante”, the (Brazilian Portuguese) name of a nearby Ge-speaking group; 'shiŋ.u, from the Brazilian Portuguese name for the Rio Xingu.
16. /ž/ [ʒ]: Velar voiced fricative
I have only one example of this consonant, appearing on the onset of the important mask ritual name ža'kwi.ka.tu. As this ritual is associated with the Arawakan speaking communities in the Alto Xingu, the phoneme is interpreted as existing in Kalapalo as a consequence of language contact. Some speakers pronounce the word: dya 'kwi.ka.tu.

16
17. /dy/ [dy]: Post-alveolar voiced palatal stop. The first element is dominant.
a. on onset:
i 'dya.li, „tapir; =dye, „same event‟ clitic/particle as in, 'u.ge=dye-ta „me, from before‟ dye 'fu.dye 'fu, „bull roarer‟
18. /m/ bilabial nasal
a. on onset: 'ma.so.pe, „secluded maiden‟ 'mi.to.te, „pre- dawn‟ 'mu.gu, „man‟s son‟ ta'mi.tsi.la, „a short time‟ a'ma.ñu,’ dear mother‟ ku'ñi.to.mi, „so that we‟re able to see‟
9./ n/ alveolar nasal stop a. on onset): na.ka.ŋu'nda,’ 3p. is bathing‟ a'na, „corn‟ an'e.tu: leader; a'fo.na.le: you (were) crying i.fu'le.nï.gï: it is roasted 'le.pe.ne, „next‟, „then‟ a'ta.ni, „they are‟ (present).
20. /ñ/ [ɲ]; (nh): post-alveolar nasal
a. on onset: 'ña.tu.i, „five‟ 'a.ñu, „my dear little one‟
21. / ŋ/: velar nasal
a. on onset: 'ŋau.pu.au, „their grandfathers‟ 'ŋune, „moon‟. 'a.ŋa, „genipapa fruit‟ te.ŋe'lu.i.ŋo, „planning to go away‟
22. /l/: post-alveolar lateral a. on onset: 'la.mbe, „that‟s right‟ 'lu.mbe, „mouse‟ ah'la.su, „that‟s right‟ (pejorative)
23. /w/: bilabial semi-vowel
This semi-vowel may be distinguished from the first person pronominal prefix u- which is usually not clearly stressed;

17

speakers will make syllabic separation of /u/ when asked to speak slowly( as, u- ' ato), „my friend‟.
a. on onset: 'wa.Gi, „jatoba‟ wawawa. the call of the maned wolf wa'wa.tsi, „dog‟ (baby talk) 'a.wa, „my uncle‟ is'ũwĩ, „3p father‟

24, /y/: velar semi-vowel
This appears on onset in naming (f), but as such this phoneme may be allophonic with 3p possessor /i/ following preceding grammatical word ending in /ï/ or /o/ as in (a-e):
a. yeŋ'i.ko.gu, ‘their possessions‟ b, 'ya.tsi, „their “misery”‟ (expression of sympathy) c. yaŋ'a.tï.gï.ko, ‘their breasts‟
d. an'e.tu 'o.to ye=ŋa.pa=fal≈i'ge-i „Probably this is food for the leader this time.‟
e. 'ai.fa, i.fu'le-nï.gï „ye-tsa. „That was finished roasting.‟
f. names: 'Ya.nu.ma, Ya'lu.i. mens‟ names; 'Ya.mu.ri.ku.ma. lu, name for women‟s ceremony (probably of Arawakan origin)

2. 1.1.1 Consonant Clusters

All three Kalapalo consonant clusters ɳg, nd, and nz involve voicing of an unvoiced consonant in the environment of an initial nasal consonant. The voiced consonant is therefore treated as an allomorph of the unvoiced consonant with the same articulation, although there is little clear evidence for making this claim regarding 1.1.2. 3.

1. A common consonant cluster is ŋ+g. In Kalapalo, this appears on morphemic boundaries as with some names, and when /ŋ/ is followed by the imperative suffix (as –ke) or the plural suffix –ko where /k/ becomes velarized as /g/. There is no apparent possibility of *ɳk. Some examples are:

a iŋge, ‘look, see‟, „consider‟, not *iŋke ). Forming a minimal pair is aŋge, ‘rattle’, ‘small locust sp.’ b. with the potential plural aspect/mood suffix - iŋgoiŋo, not * iŋkoiŋo):. te.lu'ko-iŋg.o, „they are going away„; i'mi.nïŋg.o.fa.ta: „while 3ppl‟s dawn is starting‟

c. On the passing state perfective de-verbal nominalization -їŋgo:

u-ifo-gu-i

an-їŋgo at-e.he

18
„You are already my respect relatives‟.
d. This consonant cluster is attested in other semantically nonimperative and non-plural instances, e.g. Kalapalo ifaŋguiŋa, „river‟; uŋgati , „inside the house‟; Taŋg'u.gu (river name). Two examples of verb stems using ŋ+g follows. (ii) shows the use of the causative –Gi transitive verb infix followed by an active verb aspectual nominalization (see noun chapter for more information on this construction).
i. u-i.ŋgu-Gi-'ta=ki.ŋi=a.le≈'fe.ke 1-deceive-Vt-CI=EM=UT≈2-ERG

ii. e'fi.ña.no-fe.ke≈ka:h fi'gei e-i 'ka.ŋGi-pї.gї “It‟s looks like it was your older brother who made you go up.”
e. A rare example of this compound appearing on onset is the name for a kind of small swarming ant: ŋg'ï.ta.he.
2. (/nz/ [nz]) . This is the alveolar voicing of the fricative (/s/) in the environment of nasalized consonant /n/.
a. The combination appears as onset when followed by ï/u., and as one of the forms of the „object-backgrounding‟ (OB) valencedecreasing prefix, in which P is omitted and replaced by the prefix. In this process, several phonological variants are seen: ŋ-, ñ-, and nz (3rd person P); it is not clear what the morphophonemic reasons are for the different phonological forms except that nz is always 3rd person (note the third person anaphoric prefix is- (its-). (see also 1.2.3 for other similar phonological changes connected with this morphosyntactic process)

3 /nd/. In this cluster, there is a voiced consonant /d/ and never an unvoiced consonant /t/ in the environment of the nasal /n/. As with the other clusters discussed in this section, the second element is dominant. This cluster occurs in the vocalic environment of ï, e, and a. As to whether this is an allophonic change is difficult to assess as there are no attested morphemes (such as the plural suffix –ko discussed in 1.2.1) that have been changed in the presence of the

19
nasal. The relation between /d/ and /t/ is however certainly parallel to that of the other voiced/unvoiced allophones discussed above.

2.1.2.2 Vowel nasalization
Syllables consisting of a single vowel are stressed, resulting in nasalization of the vowel. These are uncommon. An example,of a verb root that is nasalized at onset is the verb õ-“reject”.
Nasalized /ї/ is not attested.
Where a vowel appears in onset, there can be syllabic stress without nasalization:.
/a/: 'a.ma, „my mother‟ /e/: 'e.ge, „you‟ (vocative) /i/: i.dyu, „the daughter‟ /ї/: 'ї.gї, „hook‟ /o/: 'o.go, „grill‟, „platform‟ Stress and resultant nasalization can be phonemic, as with the following minimal pairs:
a. /a/: 'a.ga, „mask ritual‟; ã: a'gã, „large bees‟ nest‟ b. /u/: 'tű.wa, „water‟; tu’wã-ku.a.ti, „into the water‟
2.1.2.3 Vowel lengthening
There are several instances of stress and vowel lengthening rather than nasalization being phonemic. Vowel lengthening occurs mainly with single syllable words, as the following to expressives: ko:h, “unknown; and u:m, “I‟m thinking”. If the word has more than one syllable,such phonological words have a lengthened syllable stressed

24
[Example (b)?]. In word-final /e/, a glide emerges as /ei/ (egei, proximate demonstrative; fugei, „arrow‟). Pragmatically, such stress occurs syllable final in certain content question predication constructions, as in (e). (f) shows a minimal pair in which stress is clearly phonemic, but this is rare. Furthermore, the first word in example (b) is an adverb that always occurs in clause initial position.
a.. ege „you‟ (vocative)_; ege, „proximate third person pronominal demonstrative‟; fegei, „proximate third person adnominal demonstrative‟ b. aifa, „ready.done‟; aifa:? (? indicates a rising intonation on the stressed syllable): „is it ready.done?‟ c. efu, „the canoe‟; efũ:gu, „your egg‟ d kwi:fi, “needle”; kwifi, ‟(witch's) dart„. e. una-laka utelї: „where shall I go?‟ f. i.ña’lï, „negation‟ i.ñalï, „will become‟ 2.1.2.5 Vowel aspiration
Final/a/ and /o/ when lengthened are aspirated with /h/ as in the expressives ka:h, „frustrative‟, and ko:h. „unknown‟. Final /a/ and /o/ that are not lengthened but stressed are usually nasalized, as akã, „quail; tõ, „ema‟. Final /e/ that is lengthened is not aspirated, as in the expressive iñee, „tiny‟. Other final vowels (i, ї, u) are not attested for lengthening or nasalization.
2.1.2.5 Initial vowel deletion
Often the initial (unstressed) vowel will be absent on an initial adverbial or ideophonic word in rapid speech. It is present when the word is repeated, or with more careful articulation. In contrast, the vocalic pronominal prefix is always heard wherever it occurs.
a. eteh, „nice‟, „beautiful‟ (ideophonic interjection) → teh b. ulepe- → lepe, „then‟, „next‟; lepene, „afterwards‟, „following that‟ c. iñalï → ñalï, „negative‟ d. okogetsi → kogetsi, „tomorrow‟ e. unalaka utelï → * unalaka telï , „where can I go far from here?‟ f. apitsiña utetani → *pistiña utetani, „I‟ll go to Grandfather‟ g. ila → la, ‘someplace far away’. Note: the morpheme la, „like that‟ might be confused with this adverb but usually occurs clause finally, whereas ila occurs clause initially (see Chapter 3, 3.4.6).

25

2.1.2.6 Vowel sequences

Dipthongs generally occur at morphemic boundaries, but as seen below can occur with pluralization and initially with some content question words (b). These dipthongs are broken by syllable breaks.

a. With person prefixes on a V initial verb or NP: ui: (u'i.gu: my tooth); e'i.ña: „for you‟ (BEN); oĩ- (o'ĩts.ï.gï; „their former hunger‟); o'ĩ.dyï: tied it up; eu: u.ike'u.te.la: „I‟m not bothered.‟

b. In the content question word: ua (u'a.ma)

c. With kinship noun plurals with stress on last vowel: aũ (i'fi.dyau, ‘the (his/her) brothers.‟)

d. The class inclusion copula –i will be stressed as when hosted by a nominal or demonstrative: i'ge-i, „this one‟. When the entire phonological word is stressed, a glide ensues: e'gei: „you‟,‟third person‟:

i.gei

ko.ko a'.ke-ts≈e.gei fe.u-fe.ke

u.ï.ї.gï

u.i'tsa.

‟This thing happens at night, (when) I‟m beseiged by peccaries.

e. On onset : ai: 'ai.fa, „ready, finished‟; au, a'ű.tu, ‘prea’; a'u.e: bamboo knife; au'ë.tï name of Tupian settlement; auGa: name of Arawakan settlement; au'ma.Gi: „man‟s name‟; aï in onset (mostly) names: Aïtï („rare‟, variant of Tupi-speaking people‟s settlement name Aweti in ethnographic publications); dipthongs in coda: eu: feu, „peccary‟; uo: kuo,„fruit name‟. tripthong: ue: -kuegï (augmentative nominal suffix). The pair *ae is unattested.

f. In coda: ao: u.i'mao.ku.gu: „my cheek‟; kai.ŋa, „beside‟, „at‟

2.2 Syllabification

Kalapalo syllable structure may be either single V (aspirated) or C initial (CV, as well as the more restricted CVC (ideophones and expressives only)). Only ideophonic words may show consonant final coda, and then only with /m/ and /k/. /k/ has a following „check‟ which may be a way of preserving the syllabic structure. As there are a widely varying number of syllables in the Kalapalo word, the language rhythm is stress-based rather than achieved through syllable weight. The following table shows types of syllable structure:

Using three narratives by three different speakers, I counted syllables in the first roughly 100 words (not counting ideophones but counting epistemic expletives and interjections). Table 4 shows the variation among these three examples, but also a fairly strong consistency. Most phonological words have from 3-5 syllables; many others have as few as 2 or as many as 6; but some have only one (usually these are epistemic expletives and interjections) and others as many as 11. Most phonological words with over 8 syllables are either adverbials or discourse segment markers with multiple clitics; some speakers are more adept at this kind of construction than others.
Examples follow the table.

2.2.1 Words consisting of a single vowel
These units are class inclusion copula suffixes and the listing word õ, „and‟
a. proper (class) inclusion copula suffixes –i (Cl): i'fi.tsu.i, „served as his wife‟.
b. unique suffix –a: u.ki.lï.a „I‟ve said‟ (quotative).
c. connector or listing word õ, “and”
Ah, i'ña.ŋo.mba.ha.le 'to.pu.fa, ah, mu'ku.tsi.fa, õ 'e.ŋu.fa, 'e.ŋï.mbe.dya, 'to.pu.fa
„But surely the only vegetables he (was going to plant) were squash, and surely red sweet potatoes, and um, he (did that to) um squash, „

2.2.2.2 Complex morpho-phonological words.

27

In each case the word in question initiates the sentence. Examples in this section illustrate the complexities developed with plural affixes, clitics (shift reference, affective and epistemic), as well as taxis morphemes.

1. Seven syllable words (bracketed):

a. eŋ 'i. ko.-mu.nde. le.fa a'ta.ni.ni. mba ha.le

„But there‟s no way of knowing where they ended

up‟.

b. tẽ '.ti.ko.su’ŋa.pa.fa „Probably they came up here in their usual way.”

c. e.mbu.ki.ne.nï.mi.ŋo i.fe.ke.ni „They will be the ones to betray you‟.

2. Eight syllable words a. e.te.lï.ko.dyo.gu.mbe.fa „Thoughtlessly, they went away after doing that.‟
3. Nine, ten and eleven syllable words. These extreme syllabic constructions are unusual and it is difficult to make generalizations of their typological features. The following seem to illustrate recurrent features.
a. More than one taxis clitic occurs at the end of the clause. (see following example b). This is especially true of some initial ule- (AFR) anaphoric focus referent clauses, which are often (though not always) polysyllabic:
u 'le.pe.ta.'ha.le'ge.fa.le „But while all that was going on, now...” (same example used in demonstrative section above)
b hyper-polysyllabic words include polysyllabic interclausal reference marking clitics:

i’fe.po.lï. mbe.ge.dya.ha.le i'fe.ke „(Even though) he (still) tried to hold on to him that person (did something else to him).‟

The following 10 syllable word is an example of a new segment introduced by an anaphoric topic referent clause. It is possible the final demonstrative is actually a separate word but it has become phonologically fused to the ule-clause.

c. u’le.f.i.ñe.ta.ha.le’gei.-fa.le

F

“But because they were always doing that to them...”

The following is a complex construction taken from a leader‟s oratorical speech. It is an example of a 10 syllable word with valence-increasing causal suffix -ɳu, absolutive plural suffix–ko,

28
and the plural purposive adverbial suffix ndokomi, followed by the immediate taxis clitic =fofo. This may also illustrate vocalic assimilation, as the expected continuous indicative suffix is -nda:
d. ku‘ne.ni.tsi.ŋu’ndo.ko.mi’fo.fo „Let‟s go hunting our game right away.‟
e. This example of a ten syllable word includes a construction with four clitics, including an adverbial and a compound interclausal reference clitic (IRM) followed by a final epistemic particle.
a.wï’-nda.ko’fu.ŋu.mbe.dya.mba.le ‘wã.ke „I know they were not lying to them, about what they kept (saying to them).‟
f Here is a possible 11 syllable word (in brackets), including both taxis and final clitic, but one could argue particle status for the clitic as it manifests stress on the first syllable, as do other two-syllable grammatical words: This example illustrates a complex adverbial word.
i‘fi.tse.ke.ku.a.le.ha.le ‘wã.ke tsi’sa.ge.le.. ‟We were still completely ignorant at that time.‟
2. 3 Stress in the Kalapalo phonological word
As I show in the preceding section, Kalapalo words may have from one to as many as ten syllables. The Kalapalo phonological word manifests a basic rhythmic stress and intonation pattern.
Preferred stress on disyllabic words is on the first syllable:
„ka.ɳa, „fish‟ „e.fu, „canoe‟ „fi.tsu, „wife‟ „Ka.pi, man‟s name „ue.ge, „2nd person pronominal demonstrative
On three or more syllable words, primary stress is on the second syllable from the left.
With three or more syllable words, primary stress normally falls on the second syllable, followed by a falling intonation. Subsequent syllables are unstressed. Some examples of words with stress on second syllable are included in the following clause construction, wherein each of the two words (bracketed) has stress on the second syllable.
d. [ŋe'ŋe.-tu] [fe'gei.le.fa] „And so he was someone they feared.‟
As a language with preferred stress on the second syllable of polysyllabic words, Kalapalo is relatively unusual typologically; this is a conclusion of Laver (1994: 519) following his presentation of

29

L. Hyman‟s (1977) statistics. Laver‟s explanation for stress as a demarcative function, “indicating where the word boundaries are without making the listener expend too much cognitive effort in calculating them”( p. 519) is interesting for understanding the relation of some of the Kalapalo boundary marking suffixes to what appears to be vowel lengthening and stress in the preceding syllable. Word stress seems to be shifted right with the addition of these suffixes. 2.3.1. Single syllable words
A single syllable word is stressed. These single syllable words are either ideophonic or epistemic expletives initiating an utterance, or the connector õ.

a. 'koh, i'ña.lu fu'nu.mu'fe.ke

„Not known. I have no knowledge of it.‟

b. 'u:m, an'e.tu its'oŋ.o.i

te’ta.ko.

„ I‟m thinking they are going engaged to the leader.‟

.

c. õ , „and‟. This is a used when listing items. This morpheme is

usually preceded by a clear pause, followed by the next item being

listed:

'u.mbe, 'õ uw'a.Gi.ke, 'õ a'ku.gi, 'õ a'gen.a.gi, ' õ

a'kï.gi.sa ' ai.fa

„mouse, and, packrat, and agouti, and paca, and, capivara.

that‟s all‟ 2.3.2 Pragmatic stress

There are several kinds of exceptions to the basic stress pattern of primary second syllable stress on polysyllabic (3 syllables or more) words. These include: words beginning with the pronominal prefix, demonstrative words, the dative case marker -iña, imperative constructions where the speaker uses the interrogative mirative suffix –ki, and in discourse segments wherein the nominal is emphasized but not topicalized for pragmatic reasons

2.3.1.3 Words initiated by pronominal prefixes
The presence of prefixes on verbal and possessive nominal constructions normally results in primary stress on third syllable because the pronominal prefix itself may be stressed for pragmatic reasons. The following example shows stress on the initial pronominal prefix of the first person free pronoun, as well as the third syllable:
a. u’ge.tsa’.ɳe „It must be me.‟
In the example below, the phonological word in brackets begins with a stressed pronominal prefix; the primary stress in this example is thus on the third syllable lu. The first (two syllable) word shows stress on the first syllable.

30

b. 'a.ŋi a.wa’dyu.ko “Our dear uncles are here

2.3.1.4 Demonstrative stress

Pronominal demonstratives (PDEM) are stressed on the first or second syllable. The adnominal demonstrative (ADEM) and identificational demonstrative (IDEM) receive stress on their second syllable, with an emergent vocalic glide.
In (a), the anaphoric demonstrative (ANA) receives stress on the first syllable (the initial u- is not heard at all) while the first person PDEM is stressed on the second syllable.

a.'eh, 'ŋe.le u 'ge „”Yes, that‟s me you were talking about”‟.

In (b) the initial syllable of the first stressed.

person PDEM is

b.„u.ge.dye.ta „That was me (doing that).‟

In (c) an anaphoric topic referent (ule) clause construction, the proximate identificational demonstrative ege is stressed and a vocalic glide emerges. The initial vowel of the demonstrative is elided due to retrogressive elision.

c. u 'le-pe-ta 'ha.le ≈'gei=fa.le, AFR
„But while all that was going on, now...”

2.3.1.5 Imperative word stress

Stress occurs on the first syllable of an imperative construction.

a. 'te.ke: „(2pp) go away‟ (rather rude; the following constructions are preferred)

b. eh ‘he 'ke.te.pa.pa „All right, I agree you should go if that‟s what you
want to do.‟

c. 'kí.ge.fa Ø- 'nï.gi' fe.ke, „Let‟s go‟, she said, „Let‟s go.‟

' kí.ge.fa

2.3.1.6 Interrogative stress

There is a rising intonation accompanying the final mirative suffix – ki. Rising intonation is characteristic of interrogative constructions that begin with question-type words (u 'wa, „what‟ in this example). (See more detail is in chapter on Interrogatives)

a. u 'wa.mbe. 'ki?

31
„You said WHAT??‟
2.3.1.7 Variation in stress on names
Kalapalo personal names, perhaps because of their varied language origins, exhibit a variety of stress patterns:
a. stress on syllable with onset fricative. The examples are both names of ancient personages. The latter was considered a „Kamaiura ancestor‟ (i.e., member of a Tupi-speaking group) by Kalapalo consultants.
A.ga'fu.ta.ŋa; Wa.pa.ge '.pu.nda.ka
b. stress on penultimate syllable. The example is an Arawak word in origin
Ya.mu.ri.ku'ma.lu
c. 'ka.lo.si: from Portuguese „Carlos‟
2.3.1.8 Vowel lengthening and Stress
There are several instances of stress and vowel lengthening rather than nasalization being phonemic. Longer lengthening with adjectival-like interjections and ideophones (:; ::) occurs frequently and often involves reduction of the preceding morpheme, leading to stress on the lengthened vowel-initiated syllable (a) .
a. u 'ma:, ‟what is it?‟; .i.ñe:: , ‟how tiny‟! (ideophone), .au::mbïk’: action of falling through the air and landing hard (ideophone), au:o:m, „extended action of flying through the air and
landing gently‟ (ideophone)
Vowel lengthening also occurs with single syllable words, as in (b), illustrating expressives.
b. ko:h, “unknown‟ u:m, „I‟m thinking‟.
If the word has more than one syllable,such phonological words have a lengthened syllable stressed (c), where in word-final /e/, a glide emerges as /ei/.
c.. 'e.ge, „you‟; e'ge, proximate third person demonstrative; fe 'gei: third person proximate adnominal demonstrative
fїgi,’penis’; fu’gei, „arrow‟
Pragmatically, such stress occurs syllable final in certain content question predication constructions, as in (d).

32
d. 'ai.fa, „ready.done‟; ai'fa:? (? indicates a rising intonation on the stressed syllable): „is it ready.done?‟ ' ko.ge.tsi u 'te.lї, „tomorrow I leave‟; 'u.na.la.ka u'te.lї, „where shall I go?”
(e) shows a minimal pair in which stress is clearly phonemic, but this is rare.
e. i'ña’lï, “negation”; 'i.ña.lï, “will become‟.
f. Pragmatic reasons may also govern the use of lexical stress to achieve prominence. Usually this occurs with expletives and where there is a shift from one to another narrative segment.
o.’koh, ‟watch out!‟; o 'koh.mbe.ni.le, ‟You‟re right, stay away (from him)‟
There is a final stressed syllable when mirative suffix -ki used: u’wa.mbe‘ki?, „what was that??‟
g. prominence achieved through stress where the grammatical word is inflected with the–tsï suffix.
This grammatical feature indexes a modifier of a NP. Because stress normally does not occur on other than a) the second syllable; or, b) the first syllable of a new two-syllable grammatical word, the prominence of the modifier and its “emphatic” semantics is reinforced or achieved through stress. (put examples here)
h. stress to introduce new narrative segments: aí 'fa = begins new chain versus 'ai.fa (end of clause chain)
i. Where a non-topical nominal or adverbial is emphasized for pragmatic reasons, the grammatical word will be stressed.
‘ka.ŋa ‘a.ge.tsi o'tu „Only one food, fish‟.
j. The following example is taken from a conversation to illustrate the two syllable emphases used by the same speaker on the word e 'fi.su, „your younger brother‟:
tsa‘ke.tsї.fa e'fi.su na’-ka-ŋu.nda “Listen that‟s your younger brother bathing.”
ah, efi'su- fїŋї, nї.gi. 'fe.ke „“Surely, that‟s no younger brother of your‟s‟,” he answered.‟
k. Where the adverbial aŋi „result, consequence‟ occurs as an independent question, the final syllable is strongly emphasized and lengthened, aŋ'i. Otherwise the initial syllable would be stressed,

33

'aŋi, as when the morpheme is used as a complement in complex clause constructions. (See examples in Chapter 13: Complex Clause Constructions).
l. In mourning (fatafisunda), the final syllable of the speaker‟s referenced relative is stressed as well as the second syllable, and the vowel lengthened:
u'fi'gї:, „my grandson‟ (more usually, u'fi.gї)

m. Clause final syllable stress for emphasis
Heavy stress occurs on the clause final syllable for emphasis in a situation difficult for the speaker.
The mother of a missing man asks a shaman to locate him:
'a.ɳi a 'fa.tũ.wĩ ta 'lĩ e 'fe.ke ‟Can you hear your nephew?‟
A mother asks her son why the son‟s enemy uncle has appeared suddenly:
. tї 'kima.le a 'wa.yu e 'ta „Is there some reason why your dear uncle comes?‟

In despair, a man describes a bad dream he has been having:

. uge ikoko ake-ts-ige’i

“At night this is how I must be,

feu-feke

u-iGї i’tsa,

feu-feke.

peccary-ERG 1-surround-Vt-CI, peccary-ERG

peccaries surround me, peccaries.”

2.3.2 Secondary stress
As the preceding examples show, in complex phonological words, primary stress remains on the second syllable. However, units with more than six syllables have secondary stress (usually at morphological boundaries), followed by falling intonation, and no other stress on subsequent syllables. These morphological boundaries involve syntactic units that are often in themselves phonological words. Secondary stress also occurs where one or more cliticized grammatical units follow a longer (host) grammatical word. Clitics may have from one to as many as five syllables. While they are distinct grammatical words, because of their phonological incorporation into the rhythmic pattern of their hosts, the phonological word actually encompasses clitics. There may also be secondary stress, when a normally unstressed syllable is emphasized for pragmatic reasons.

34
a.The following example shows primary (') and secondary ('') stress, as well as prominent stress on the final syllable of the ergative complement, which is being emphasized for pragmatic reasons (but is not topicalized)
u'iŋ.Gu.Gi-''ta=ki’ŋi’a.le’feke: ‟Too bad you‟re forever lying to me.‟
2.3.3 Stress on Portuguese derived words
Stress on words entering Kalapalo from rural Brazilian Portuguese may differ, as speakers tend to use the same stress as in the original language. Some examples that do not follow the usual stress rule in Kalapalo are: a) melan’zía: „water melon‟ (stress falls on the penultimate syllable) b) só:gro: „father-in-law‟ (stress falls on the first syllable, with a lengthened vowell) c) mus.ke’to: „musket‟, from mosquete d) a.fi’dyau: „airplane‟, from aviaõ e) bu‟či.na: „boots‟, from P bota.
2.4 Morphophonemic Processes
Kalapalo exhibits several morphophonemic processes, including regressive and progressive vocalic elision, vocalic assimilation, emergence of /p/, emergence of /m/, emergence of /g/ (velarization), emergence of /l/, epenthesis, and ablaut.
2.4.1. Regressive influence
This process (≈) occurs at morphemic boundaries. Where neither syllable is stressed or the same vowel appears twice at the boundary (as in a) there is regressive elision with stress placed on the first syllable final vowel.
a. fa 'ŋgu.i.ŋa 'a.tï ' 'po.ŋa → fa 'ŋgu.iŋ≈a.tï 'po.ŋa
The stressed syllable vowel which occurs at the beginning of the morpheme will predominate over the unstressed syllable with vowel ending. In the case of the ergative complement, there is frequently regressive influence, with resulting syllable reduction, as with an initial vowel prefix on the ERG suffix.
b. ï +i → i. As this example illustrates, there is very frequent vowel elision involving the ergative complement person prefix and the final vowel of a morpheme (usually this is an aspect/mood suffix or a clitic) on the verb phrase. When speaking quickly, many Kalapalo use the quotative „say.to‟ seen in (b) in a very reduced manner, with only the initial syllable uttered, as „nї.

35
'u.ntsi nï.g≈i 'fe.ke, “My young relative”, he addressed him. c. i + i → i, non-quotative example
itsufu-pe fo-te-lu-a ito-te-ga-ti≈feke. „He set fire to some of his slash that he wanted to burn up.‟
d.. a + u → a tama ukw-ogopiñalï ta.ma≈ kw-o .go 'pi.ña.lï ‟Why should we have to go back?‟
e. Regressive vowel elison may also occur with clitic compounds:
mbe=a.le →mba.le SS=UT
2.4.2. Progressive influence
Where there is an epistemic particle with stress on the second syllable, the elision influence is progressive. Here the perfective nominalized active equative copular verb at- looses the initial vowel:
c.. u 'kwo.to.fe.ke ki 'ŋi≈tï 'fï.gï.ko i 'ge.to,mi „I regret our relative insisted he needed to take us away‟.
2.4.3 Vocalic Assimilation
There are at least two types of vocalic assimilation: e→a and ї → o. As only a few examples are attested in my data, more work is needed to clarify Kalapalo vocalic assimilation.
2.4.3.1. Influence of the preventative prefix
This process occurs with the preventative verbal prefix ke-. When followed by syllables with /a/, ke →ka. The following are examples with the preventative prefix as ke-,
a. preceding syllable with /e/: ke.te.ŋa: ‟Don‟t go‟ (lit, „don‟t go-er‟)
b. preceding syllable with /i/:
u:m, ke.ki.ŋi 'fe.tsa.ŋe ‟It seems to me that you must stop saying that.‟

36
c. example preceding three syllables with /a/: ka≈g.ag.a.pa.ga.tsi.ŋe, u '-i.ku.gu ke 'ti.fi.ñe ‟Stop keeping things swept up,(so) you don‟t touch my semen.‟ (lit, my semen touch-er}
d. A second example of preventative prefix as ka-, preceding two syllables with /a/:
ka-g≈atsa-ki-ŋe ake-tsa-ŋe ‟I don‟t want you to run away‟.
2.4.2.2 Assimilation involving /o/
In the example, the first syllable under assimilation influence is –ko, followed by the nominalizer suffix –mbo, „without‟. This suffix would be expected as -mbї in other contexts.
a. a'fa.tu.wĩ.ko'a.ke ti.ñe.ta ' ñ-i.ko.mbo.gu'i el'ei a.ga.i'e.ni „I with your nephews, as we come to you, they are entering (the settlement) without any food.‟
2.4.3 /f/ surfaces as [p]
There is emergence of /p/ when the consonant is preceded by /u/ in a stressed syllable: ifis’uagï: „the older brother‟ → „kupis’uagï, „our older brother‟
a. u’fu.lu.nda, „I travel around‟ ah, ku.pi.ña.no.ko ku.p‘ulu-nda-ko u-itsa igei
EXP, 1+2-OBro-PL 1+2-travel-CI-PL 1-EX-CI IDEM
„I‟m (in this situation) as our brothers travel around.‟
2.4.4. Emergence of /m/ from /p/
In one instance, the environment of preceding /p/ initial syllable, /p/ surfaces as [m]d. There appears to be a phonological constraint on the use of /p/, as -api, the usual root for „hit‟ emerges as -mi when preceded by the essive nominalization –pe on the preceding adverb. More data are needed for a clear understanding of this process.
is'i.na.lï.ti, tiŋ'and.su.ko
u'gu.pe 'mi.ña.lï i'fe.ke.ni. „When she wanted to come back to them, they pushed their sister away.‟
2.4.5 Emergence of /g/ (velarization)

37
I have recorded one instance of /g/ appearing where /l/ would normally occur and several where /g/ appears between the two vowels.
u'li.mo, „my child‟ →ta.ta'ke.ge.ni, Sa.ga'na.fa 'gi.mo, „four, Saganafa‟s children‟. This may be an effect of the possessive suffix –gї following the name „Saganafa‟.
2.4.6 Emergence of /l/ connector (C)
I have two examples of [l] emerging between final a and initial a of adjoining syllables. In a) and also b), /g/ emerges between final /i/ and /ї/, and following /a/. This NP is then co-referenced with the clausally postposed ergative argument.
a. Ta'u.gi g ≈a'ma.ki.lї i'fe.ke, tugufi 'is.a'ma.ki.lї fe'gei „Taugi dropped Painted Catfish. Painted Catfish, he fell down, Painted Catfish fell.‟
→ tї 'ga.la'ma.ki.lï „Did someone drop him?‟
b. fu'go.mbo, „in the plaza‟→ o.lo.mbo.ni, „your (pl) plaza‟

2.4.7 Epenthesis

Due to stress assignment and sentential stress patterns, emergence of epenthentic vowels e, i occurs in a number of cases of suffixation and cliticization. Where a verb phrase suffix and (less commonly) a clitic is used, an epenthentic vowel will emerge to create a light syllable. Some examples follow.

a. In this example /e/ emerges before the clitic mukwe , apparently because of the stress preceding negative syllable –la, possibly because of the suffixed zero morpheme „consequential‟ (CONS):

'ui.keu.te.la

e.mu.kwe.ti.fa e.mu.gu

e.ta

u'pei.gï'i.ña

“I recall I didn‟t get angry with your son after he came to

shake me”.

b. In this example, there are two instances of the epithentic /i/ (both in boldface). The first appears between a de-verbal nominalization suffix -ndu, while the second occurs before the negative nominalization - ɳi.
ut.u.mi.dyї i'fe.ke tse'fe.su.ndu.i.ɳi, 'gei.fe.ke i'fit.su.i.-ɳi
„He was tied up by her so he couldn‟t walk around, so he couldn‟t touch this‟.

2.4.8. Ablaut

38

There are several types of ablaut processes. An initial front grade vowel in first person u- or second or third persons e- may show back grade variation a~o in first or second person “possessive” . This is particularly important in kinship terminology and with some nouns where there is 2nd person prefix. Some verbs have unusual ablaut with third person prefix (usually i- or Ø) taking the first person form (u-). There are also less common examples of u~e and a~o. More research is needed to clarify these processes.

2.4.8.1 Kinship terms

front grade: e-figï, „your grandson‟ u-figï, „my grandson‟

e-ŋiso, „your (pl?) husband‟ u-ño, „my husband‟

back grade ablaut:

a-fiñano, „your older brother‟ a-figï, „my grandson‟ (as in

mourning)

a-ma, „mother‟ (vocative)

a-pa: „father‟ (vocative)

a-ta: „your mother‟ (referential) o-wï: „your father‟ (referential)

2.4.8.2 Second person possessed nouns and perfective nominals. Back grade ablaut (e~a, o) occurs with these word types.
a. a-gu-gu-i 2-thin-POSS-CL
„your thinness‟
b. o-nofa-ne-nïgï figei 2-pregnant-cause-PS ADEM „this has made you pregnant.‟
c. o-ŋoŋo-gu-ko-iŋo=nale-fa ele te-lu=lefa, 2-land-POSS-PL-LOC-DT-PTP PDEM go.away-PI=MT ila-iña-lefa. far.away-DAT/BEN-MT „But your own land was where (he) went away for, a distant place.‟

2.4.8.3. Hortatives

With these forms, the ablaut process is o ~e/i

a. Examples with ogi, distal hortative (predicate is located

far away from speaker):

. ogi-fa k-ige-ke,

Ø-nïg≈i-feke

DH-PTP 1+2-go back-I, 3-PS≈3-ERG

„Let‟s all go back together now‟

ogi e-ŋe-te u-iña DH 2-bring-I 1-DAT/BEN

39

‟Go ahead and bring it for me.‟

ogi-atai-fa e-futisofo iŋati

e-its-ue

DH-URG-PTP 2-mo-in-law hammock-ADV 2-EX-I

‟Right now, go ahead and lie down with your mother-in-

law.‟

2.4.8.4 ohsi, proximate hortative;

a. ohsi- ni itsa-ke=ge PH-PL measure-I=again „Go ahead and measure it again.‟

2.4.8.4.. Imperatives.

Imperative ablaut appears as e~a,o.

a-tsa-ke-fa 2-listen.to-I-PTP „Listen to this.‟ o-ndï-ke: „blow into the flute‟

2.4.8. 5. Body parts With some body part words, second person pronominal prefix ablaut occurs as: e~a a-ŋakafugu, „your (women‟s) hair‟ e-tagiñu, „your speech‟ e-fĩgi, „your penis‟ e-iŋugu, „your eye‟

2.4.8.6. Other nouns

a. u~e In the environment of -na, the allative case marker

etu, „settlement‟, etu-pe, „one of the settlements‟ → ete-na ‘to the settlement‟:

lepene si-nïgï=lefa

asuti e-nïgï=lefa ete-na.

afterwards 3-come.to-PS-MT, frog come.to-PS=MT

settlement-ALL

b. a~o In this example, the existential copular verb itsa →tso in environment of the collective plural –go. This may also be an example of vocalic assimilation.

oĩ-tso-go

ite-pïgï-ko

oĩ:-pi i-tsa-ko

thirst-EX-COLL go away-VPE-PL thirst-ADV 3-EX-PL

„They all were thirsty, they went away, being thirsty‟.

2.4.9. Allophonic processes

40

a. ï and u alternation in medial and final vowels (never on initial first person prefix u-). This appears to have to do with stress. For example, the following pair shows /u/ on a stressed syllable: i 'dyu or 'i.dyї

b. f→h allophones in initial consonant or final syllable of affixes: aifa/ aiha: “finished, ready”; hale/ fale „different event‟.

c. examples of ŋ- →ñ-in reflexive contexts: 1) ŋune “moon”;

ñune-gu,‟his own moon (experienced length of time)‟); 2)

ïŋïne, ‟the house‟”; ñïne-gï, „her own house‟

d. dy→y at onset:

dyetsa → yetsa

2.4.10. Repetition and reduplication processes

These are partial reduplications. Reduplication tends to occur with initial morphemes. The initial vowel, which is subject to elision, is usually not reduplicated (in the syllable) is.

a. uwa-ma≈wa-ma itsa-le≈gei what-EM≈what-EM 3-EX-CI –MT≈IDEM
„What, oh what was that?‟

b. kete, ŋetefa, „go on, go on.‟ c. mbembege: „do that over again‟ (shift reference clitic) d. odyodyodyo, ‟don‟t don‟t don‟t‟

e. ŋele-fu ŋelefu ŋelefu „that person (being)-above-CAN, etc.‟ (jaguar creeping up on someone)

f. uwa-ma-wa-ma itsa-le ≈ ge-i? what-EM-what-EM 3-EX-UT ≈ADEM-CL „What in the world is this?‟

g. dyambedyambedyambe: in a story, the otters reflect on how they love to gobble up certain fish. Nonreduplicated forms would be simply the interclausal reference marking clitics =dya and =mbe (SS). However it is not clear how these clitics would relate semantically to the ideophonic expression.

2.5. Phonotactic Restrictions
The following two tables show phonotactic restrictions on consonants and vowels. The prosodic classes of morphemes relevant to the constraints shown include prefixes (one syllable only); roots (can be as many as three syllables); radicals (can be as many as two syllables); suffixes and prefixes (one or two syllables); and enclitics (one to four syllables).

2.6. Discourse influenced changes
1. whispering: when speaking about the irresponsible behaviour of an absent third person, the speaker often whispers. This is true even if the subject in question is no longer alive. 2. “tight” or “creaky” voicing occurs when the speaker is ridiculing someone‟s irresponsible, perhaps ridiculous speech. 3. ingressive aspiration. There is paralinguistic use of pulmonic ingressive with eh , „yes‟ or aifa , „ready, done‟, to emphasized (not simply to mark) agreement. 4. Expression of grief involves a softened voice and a slower rhythm.
2.7. Prosody in relation to leader’s talk (oratorical register)
Several features are distinctive to the oratorical register known as anetu itagiñu, „leader‟s (conversational) talk‟.
1. repetition of hortative: ogiogiogiogiogi::, „come here to me, here to me, here to me, here to mee....”

42
2. overlapping discourse with other leaders, particularly with greeting and departure ritual communication.
2.8. Baby talk
Older people teach children to talk using a set of very simple constructions. First, the phonological inventory is somewhat limited compared with adult speech, as there are no central or nasalized vowels and no velar or fricative consonants. Stress on the second of a very small sequence of syllables, and syllabic reduplication are common features. The same constructions are used both to reference an existing event or item in the child‟s immediate environment, as well as to indicate whether the child wants or needs something. In this regard a simplification or reduction of the dative/benefactive (iña) and allative (-na) cases occurs.
Looking at these constructions from the perspective of syllabification, it appears one of the first things the child learns is a single vowel syllable type, as well as the main three syllable structure possibilities, that is, VC, CV, and VCV. In addition, the second syllable stress occurs quite forcibly in every instance except one. The exception is, 'ma-ñí – „I want to be carried‟ and also, ‟I want to carry you‟, in each case a kind of simple imperative strategy which has stress on the first syllable like most adult imperatives.
a-'u – „drink.‟ (both noun and imperative) a-'u-na, a'u ‟Here‟s something for you to drink.‟ i-'u – ‟I want to drink.‟ i-'i – ‟I am going to defecate.‟ i-'i? (with rising tone), “ Did you defecate?” pa-'i – ‟Sit down.‟ pa-'í.na pa-'i – ‟Sit down here.‟ (urging) 'ma-ñí – ‟I want to be carried.‟ Also the caregiver says, 'ma-ñí 'mañí , ‟I want to carry you.‟ (encouraging) a-'mu– ‟Food, I want to eat.‟ mm 'mm – ‘itseke „reference to the masked figure during a ritual performance‟ (e.g. the forest monster afása) ta-'a.ta, „(here‟s) something nice to eat‟ wa‘wa.tsi, -„dog‟
2.9. Kalapalo whistling.
This is a minor register that is used by young men. It involves three tones: a) descending or low tone, b) emphasis neutral, b) high tone
1. Gender in relation to whistling. Performed by men only, this register is usually a sign that the participants are age mates who are brothers-in-law and/or “friends” (ato). Such persons would engage in various informal activities together; during the time of my research, whistling was used to call to people inside a house one doesn‟t enter, is too lazy to enter, or when one is outside a house, wanting to speak with someone inside but wishing to have an encounter outside (“secret planning”). Whistling is motivated by: a) affinal civility, which precludes using names and involves avoidance of certain relatives; and b) a general hesitation in using names, as well as c) the need to develop privacy in a very open community.

Phrases used in whistling: a. kin term, esp. ku-ña-du „bro-in-law‟ from Portuguese cunhado) (low, neutral emphasis, rising) b. ña-fe ‟come here‟ (rising, falling) c. o-ka-ŋi: ‟wait‟; (neutral, rising, neutral) d. ke-te-fa: ‟let‟s go‟ (rising, rising, falling) e. ah-mi-gu ‟friend‟ (neutral, rising, neutral)
3. Confusion: Whistling often leads to some interference as to the reason for a whistled call; who is being called (often answered verbally, in which case the caller, who doesn‟t always wish to be identified by people inside the house, repeats the whistle)
4. Hidden identity: 1) friend calls to his lover‟s brother; brother-inlaw calls to wife‟s brother who is his “friend”.
2.10 Some linguistic features of shamanic practice
Shamanic practice often involves the use of ideophonic seeming locutions. This practice may be performed by individuals visiting patients, but in serious cases a group of shamans will be collectively involved. In such times there will be special shamanic communication between them.
a. The shamanic cough
A highly marked feature of collective shamanic practice is sound of a „cough‟ older shamans use to call the others together for a curing ritual. The other participants respond in kind. This „cough‟ is a deep, aspirated and repeated vocalization with descending intonation.
b. The shamanic curing sound
The „sucking‟ practice of the shaman involved directly in curing a patient involves a loud and repeated „hu ah hu ah hu ah’ utterance as the shaman attempts to draw out the kwifi, „dart‟, which is causing the victim‟s problem. (Among the local Tupian speaking Kamaiura, this event is said to be called „hukahuka‟.)

Chapter 3 Clitics and Particles
Kalapalo is a language with a rich variety of clitics and a smaller number of morphologically identical independent units or ―particles‖. Clitics are one to three-syllable non-stressed, or lightly-stressed grammatical words but with no morphological categories of their own, that is, no inflectional or derivational possibilities. Exceptions to this rule are the (very occasional) presence on some affective clitics of the class inclusion copula suffix –i, the ‗unique‘ suffix –a, and the primary topical participant marker –fa, all of which must always appear in word final position. Clitics never stand alone and must be hosted by another grammatical word among which are a variety of syntactic units. All of the latter constitute a phonological word in themselves to which the clitic becomes attached without changing the stress pattern of the word. Clitics are syntactically free insofar as they do not change their hosts‘ functions, nor do they acquire a syntactic function by virtue of being hosted. Consequently, Kalapalo clitics have very broad scope, in some cases giving meaning not only to the independent clause or NP to which they are attached, but often to larger syntactic units involving subordinate clauses.
Particles are postposed to adverbial, nominal, or verbal phrasal constructions and like clitics cannot appear alone. They do not host any inflectional or derivational features. To contrast these morphemes with clitics, the term ―particle‖ seems justified by two features that distinguish them from clitic status. First is the fact that these morphemes are sometimes stressed on the first syllable. The class of affective particles are syntactically distinct from clitics because they all show stress on the first syllable, and those of one syllable have strong stress and vocalic extension. This does not, however, change the phonological shape of the preceding phonological word. Nonetheless, although independent words, they are still be in a constrained position, following the immediately preceding grammatical word. In this regard they are very similar to clitics. The second distinguishing feature is that particles may appear several times in an utterance, following several different (and different kinds of) phrasal constituents. Normally clitics appear only once (although maintaining full scope over the entire utterance). The particular morphemes that seem to achieve both particle and clitic status are reviewed in discussions in this chapter of the affective, epistemic and taxis sets. A set of discourse morphemes that function as particles is described in Chapter 12: Small Word Classes. The following table summarizes the features distinguishing Kalapalo clitics from particles:

3.1. General overview of Kalapalo clitics
There are several sets of Kalapalo clitics that follow an adverbial clause or VP. Each of these sets of enclitics contains many members. Enclitics generally take second position after the first non-permeable constituent, (which is normally a stem with one or more inflectional constituents.) Enclitics include affective, epistemic, taxis or phasal markers, and interclausal reference markers (discussed separately in Chapter 14). Some epistemic clitics are very free clitics, attaching themselves to various different kinds of constituents and to more than one phrase within a single utterance, and in some pragmatically defined instances even to every clause and NP in the utterance. In a few cases, an enclitic may have a non-clitic alternant which acts as an independent word or ―particle‖. Kalapalo clitics have basically lexical meaning, but the interclausal reference markers (IRM) also have important grammatical meaning.

3.1.1 The positioning of clitics on phonological words
Reviewing the analysis of stress presented in Chapter 1, the following examples of utterances with no clitics show that generally speaking phonological words have primary stress on the second syllable. There are pragmatically defined exceptions with heavy stress on the final syllable of a complete utterance. Where vowels at adjacent morphological boundaries are subject to vowel elision (the morphemes involved in vowel elision material are in brackets) the examples show regressive elision where a noun is followed by (as in a) another noun or (as in b) a VP. The comma (,) indicates a brief pause before a new clause:

46

a.

fe‟uluGi at-„ïfïgï [aŋ‟ifolo ≈ „fitsu-i,]

dung.beetle EQA-IMP [dawn person ≈wife-CL,]

fe‟uluGi i-ñ‟ïgï.

dung.beetle EX-TR

‗A dung beetle became (lit., ‗it‘s becoming‘) the wife of a

person from ancient times.‘

b.

[e-fisï≈ te-tomi]

ata-iti u-tiŋa-gï

2-ybr≈go.away.PURP EQA-DES 1-split.open.fruit.POSS

i-ti-gi. 3-o.get.SUP ‗Perhaps your younger brother could go get me some split-open fruit?‘

Where an enclitic occurs, the phonological word does not change stress patterning but there is obligatory secondary stress on the first syllable of the clitic. In (c) there is an ‗unending‘ taxis clitic =ale, „continuing on, always‘(UT) hosted by the head NP, together with an adverbial circumfix afïtï ...N-fuŋu, ―unlike N.‖ In this example, the first element of the circumfix is followed by the secondarily stressed ―primary topical participant‖ –fa.

c.

Ah kuigiñu=‟ale

figei afïtï-fa ,

EXP manioc.flour=UT ADEM denial-PTP ≈ŋiko ≈fuŋu

Ø- ta i-feke. wild.inedible.plant ≈R, tell-CI 3-ERG ‗Surely, this manioc flour will never be like those wild and inedible plants,‘ he told her.

Example (d) shows the same adverbial circumfix as in (c). The first constituent hosting the epistemic clitic =maki, ―reevaluation‖ or ―realization‖; this clitic has scope over the entire predication:

d. a‘fïtï=‘maki Tugumai-fuŋu ku-‗kuge

denial=EM Trumai-R

1+2-people

‗Now I realize, we are are not Trumai‘.

3.1.2. Semantic types of clitics
In this section, I look at the classes of Kalapalo enclitics, define them more closely from a semantic perspective, and examine the types of hosts to which clitics may attach. I will also look at the co-occurrence or pairing phenomena involved with enclitics, namely, what kinds of clitics can be paired and why, the order of these pairings, and the prosodic consequences of these phenomena.

47
Within the general class of enclitics are four basic ―closed‖ sets. I call these sets: 1) affective, 2) epistemic, 3) taxis (or phasal), and 4) interclausal reference markers (IRM). Some members of these sets must be treated as particles rather than clitics, as they manifest their own prosodic independence from the clause that hosts them, being separated by a noticeable pause and showing stress on their initial syllable. Otherwise, they are like clitics as they do not have their own inflectional or derivational features and must follow immediately after a phonological word.
Epistemic and affective clitics are basically distinguished semantically as morphemes that are highly relevant to stance practices. The taxis and interclausal reference markers have distinct clause chaining functions. Members of no more than three (or in the case of the presence of interclausal reference markers, four) different enclitic and particle sub-classes may follow upon other word classes. Where combinations of clitics and particles complement adverbials their scope covers the clause. With phasal and interclausal reference markers, the scope encompasses a partial or full clause chain, depending upon the morpheme in question. In complex clause constructions, some particles may occur repeatedly in an utterance, following each clause constituent.

3.2 Affective clitics and particles

These involve feelings of the speaker vis-à-vis an argument in the clause. With one exception , these are all negative feelings of one degree or another. The exception is the mirative clitic =seku. Many affective morphemes can be simply hosted by nominals (a, c). The scope of these morphemes is the entire utterance. Some may behave as particles, showing stress on the first syllable. Affective clitics are commonly paired with a particle (see examples 4.1.4c; 4.1.9a, b). Affective clitics are somewhat unusual insofar as some are attested as hosting –i, the class inclusion copula, –a ‗unique‘ copula and the –fa ‗primary topical participant‘ suffixes. These are exceptions to the rule of clitics not hosting any inflectional features. Table 10 shows the morphemes in this set. I have not used glosses for the independent particles, which appear at the end of the list. There is also a separate set of interjections, which I call ‗affective expressives‘ (see Chapter 12).

48

3.2.1. =su, pejorative (PEJ)

This clitic references an actor‘s pejorative, compulsive, expected but undesireable manner or action. Examples (a) and (c) show this in a verbal construction (following aspect/mood category), and example b shows su following a noun.

a.

In this example, =su hosts the primary topical participant suffix

3.2.3 =ki, negative mirative clitic (MIRN)
This clitic references something surprising that is strongly rejected. Note: there is also a ‗neutral‘ mirative clitic =seku, described below, which may host this clitic. Furthermore, /ki/ is homophonous to the instrumental case marker and an adverbial suffix.

49

a. A woman rejects a potential lover in a particularly rude manner

tï=ki: : (strong emphasis and lengthened vowel on last syllable): RQ-MIRN ‘You said what??‘

3.2.4 =seku (MIR), neutral or positive mirative

The speaker is expressing surprise but in a more neutral or positive manner. Note the semantic difference with the negative mirative clitic =ki, which can occur if the speaker has a strong negative reaction. However, the two may co-occur (this combination is seen in 3.2.7 (b).

3.2.6 nile, ‘beware‘.
This particle expresses the sense of needing to avoid something because it is inappropriate, or dangerous. .

atah =mbege nile e-gike-gï nice=SSR wrong 2-smell-POSS

‘But it would be wrong for me to do (i.e., say) that again, you smell nice to me!‘

3.2.7 dyogu, ‗unkind‘
This particle is a mild, sometimes comical malefactive, used when the speaker judges the referent to be momentarily inconsiderate or thoughtless, unaccepting of something a friend or other intimate has done. There may even be a noticeable pause before the speaker uses it.

a. The speaker thinks that what he sees is some kind of hallucination that doesn‘t have consideration for the people who would die just from seeing it.

b. The speaker admits to her son-in-law that she didn‘t let him know she was right behind him, the result being that he spoke salaciously to her, thinking she was his wife.

ah! uge dyogu≈tsa=ke-ts≈ege EXP me unkind≈EX-CL=SD-DEO≈PDEM ‗Oh no! Careless me who allowed you to do that!‘

c. In this example, the speaker is critical of what he is served as food. The clitic hosts the class inclusion copula –i.

eh, inde nago-faka Ø -ŋ-amba,

‗Yes, in this place they don‘t care what they consume.‘

51

3.2.8 eGitse. „unfortunate‘

This is one of the affective particles that may follow several clauses in a complex clause construction. The first example shows the particle Gitse following the pejorative clitic =su, described in 3.2.1. Note that the epistemic clitic =kiɳi described in the section 3.3.2.17 is also used to express an unfortunate circumstance but as a contraspective (‗were it not so‘).

3.3 Epistemic clitics and particles
Epistemology is defined here as the grammatical means of referencing a speaker‘s evaluation of information, particularly the degree of confidence that a speaker has in the veracity of information. In this regard, epistemology can be usefully contrasted with evidentiality, or the marking of sources of evidence (DeHaan 1999; Aikhenvald 2004). The terminological contrast is justified by the grammatically distinct types of morphemes in the language: epistemic clitics and particles and evidential suffixes. Kalapalo also has five expressives with epistemic meanings. Evidentials and the epistemic expressives are discussed in Chapter 12: Small Word Classes.
3.3.1 General overview Kalapalo grammaticalized epistemic markers belong to two different form classes. The first are epistemic expressives, discussed in Chapter 12, in the section on expressives (12. 2.2). The second, the larger group, are the clitics discussed here, though some may operate as particles as I

52

show below. In an earlier analysis (Basso 2008) I called all these morphemes ―particles‖ but have turned to calling them ―clitics‖ after further phonological analysis and understanding of the Kalapalo phonological word. There are 27 of these epistemic morphemes (EM). Epistemic clitics usually appear after the first element in a clause (Wackernagel‘s position); the scope of the clitic includes the entire clause. There is rarely any vowel reduction; excepting the morpheme aka, no epistemic clitic is vowel initial. The morpheme mukwe may show elision when followed by a vowel initial phonological word. Nonetheless, epistemic morphemes (EM) do function as clitics insofar as they are phonologically bound through stress patterning to the constructions they complement, thereby playing a key role in phonological word construction. A minimal epistemic clause is structured as [ADV+ EM] or [NP+EM]. While the EM itself is not a verbal element, it references one anaphorically through deictic semantics.
Some examples follow to show the syntactic relations of epistemic expressives (EXP), epistemic clitics (EM) and other grammatical features of Kalapalo sentences, especially person prefixes, finite verb aspectual or irrealis suffixes, and negation. For the sake of clarity, all EXP and EM forms are in boldface italics.
In (a) a speaker uses the EM maki. This morpheme indexes a kind of correction in which the speaker reevaluates a previously uncertain or denial utterance as correct. The speaker in this example realizes there is actually a river in a certain place, something he had been uncertain about earlier. In this example, maki is in second position following the location demonstrative ande (―here.now‖), which in turn has scope over the following noun phrase, fanguiŋga-lefa river=metonymic taxis):

a.

ande=maki fanguiŋga=lefa, Ø- nïg≈-feke.

here.now=EM river=MT, 3-PS≈3-ERG

‗Ok, now I see that the river is here after all‖, he said to (him)‘.

In some complex constructions more than one epistemic morpheme is used, as for example in (b). In this utterance, a single nominal clause is constructed from a negative adverbialization of the identificational demonstrative igei, The derived adverb includes the EM =taka, agreement with someone else‟s description of their experience; in the nominalization part of the construction, the speaker has used the evidential (EV) -tifa, a speaker confirming his own first-hand experience, including being told something. The speaker has returned from a trip to his wife‘s family. His mother notices that his eyes have turned red, the consequence of his living in a very stuffy, smoke-filled house. The speaker doesn‘t like the kind of living space he has been made to share with his wife‘s relatives and wants to create a different sort of house. As he is addressing his own mother, he uses the ―exclusive we‖ pronoun (tisuge) in reference to his affines and himself. The EM =taka references his mother‘s just-stated dismay at seeing his reddened eyes; the EM -tifa references the speaker‘s prior experience and thus has an evidential as well as epistemic quality.

certainly won‘t have to live this way in a different place ‗.)

c.

The following example shows the same EM =taka on an ―I told

you so‖ quotative. The quotation, which precedes the quotative,

is included in the scope of the EM =taka.

ukw-aŋi-fofo u-kwi-ta=taka egei. dual-result-IM 1-utter-CI=EM IDEM ‗Let's wait a while. You know I said that.‘

Example (e) includes both an EM (=laka: very weak inference, puzzlement, or a strong inability to understand) and the EXP uum, referencing thought of an imaginative nature (perhaps close to ―introspective‖, in Hoff‘s terminology; in De Haan‘s deictic model, the speaker has put himself into the sphere of action):

e.

u:m aŋi=laka

ukuge

ele, ukuge.

EXP result=EM

human being PDEM, human being

„I suppose that could have been human, a human being‘.

In (f) the EM =tiki (speaker denies alignment with the listener) modifies the contrastive prefix ta- (CONT). The speaker, a notorious warrior, has been accused of coming into a community in order to kill everybody there. Actually he is seeking a wife.

f.

ta=tiki ukw-oto e-ŋalï

u-feke.

CONT=EM dual-parent shoot-REV 1-ERG

‗It‘s not right that (as you say) I shoot back at our parent.‘

(g) is an example of an EM clitic followed by an EM particle. The first EM is =nika, appealing to the listener‟s experience. The particle, repeated several times, is wãke (marking strong confidence in first-hand evidence from the past that no longer exists). The example is taken from an historical narrative, a man reminds his younger brother of an event involving a third relative which took place when the brothers were children. This third person is at the time of the utterance in urgent need [of help?] during a battle with enemies, and the younger brother has suggested they go and help him. But the older brother cannot share his brother‘s suggestion that they go and help as he has good reason to dislike the other relative. This is how the older brother responds:

g. t-iŋ-i-la=nika

wãke ku-piñano-feke wãke

wãke]

dual-parent 3-head-SAL 3-throw away-VPE EM

‗Can it be that you don‘t remember what happened long ago

when our older brother threw away our father's head?‘

Several things are going on as the older brother answers. First, he uses the same EM (wãke) in the initial consideration (complement clause, in the ergative argument NP, and in the main clauses. This repetition is characteristic usage of wãke (see more discussion below). Second, the initial complement clause features =nika. As the first EM, the scope of nika actually falls over the entire utterance. But so does the repeated use of the second EM, wãke, which links the consideration complement construction to the first hand but no longer existing visual evidence in the main clause. Third, the speaker emphasizes the postposed transitive subject (A) NP by left-displacing it in the main clause (the structure would normally be OVA).

h.

In the following example, the contra-spective mukwe, ‗hope in

vain‘ is followed by the strong requirement for alignment =nifa

in an adverbial construction beginning with taloki, ‗useless‘, ‗no

reason‘. The locution is part of a ceremonial speech addressed to

ritual messengers (ɳeɳoku).

ah taloki=mukwe=nifa timbe-ɳa-ke

ɳeɳoku

EXP useless=EM=EM arrive-cause-I messenger(s)

‗Surely you must agree there‘s no reason in vain, enable your

arrival messengers.‘

3.3.2 Semantic parameters
In what follows, I delineate semantic parameters of the 28 members of the Kalapalo epistemic clitic sub-class (see Table 11); due to the complexity of this set, all morphemes are glossed EM. A number of the semantic parameters seem to closely match those specified by B.J. Hoff (1986) for Surinam Carib (Kari‘na). However, with one exception, I use different language to describe these features, in keeping with my emphasis on deixis, dialogicality and stance process. What Hoff calls “grade‖ (strong-weak-lacking); ―speaker‘s attitude‖, ―appeals on speaker‖, ―change of grade‖ and ―co-existence with supporting or conflicting evidence‖ are clearly epistemic parameters found in Kalapalo. Their respective Kalapalo equivalents are ―grades of confidence‖ (A, B, F): including strong, probable, possible, uncertain, incredulity, denial, knowledge lacking); ―focus on person in subjectivity‖ (C), ―intersubjectivity‖ (F): ―alignments, appeals to another‖ (D,F); ―focus on changing subjectivity; correctives (A, D)‖; and ―contraspective (E)‖. Hoff‘s specification of an underlying contrast in the Surinam Carib particle set between the origins of two types of evidence - i.e., “extraspective” (from the ―outside world‖, that is, evidence external to the speaker; public knowledge) and ―introspective‖ (evidence from the ―inner world of the speaker‖; evidence in the mind of the speaker; private

55
knowledge) - is an evidential feature that in Kalapalo can be understood with reference to Ferdinand De Haan‘s deictic perspective, an approach that allows for a semantic description subsuming these evidential and epistemic features.
De Haan (2001) distinguishes between two deictic categories relevant to evidentiality: in the first, the speaker is separated (or separates herself) from the action being described; in the second, the speaker includes himself in the description of the action. In fact, these make sense for Kalapalo epistemic marking, in the context of the stance object being foregrounded in the discourse segment. In my analysis I contrast forms (1; 3-6) where the speaker includes herself in the sphere of action; and others (7-10) where the speaker is separate or excludes herself from the sphere of action (see Table 9). A third deictic field also appears, involving a speaker referencing a second person subject‘s inclusion in the sphere of action (2; 12). As I discuss below, there are other participant frameworks relevant to Kalapalo epistemic markers in which the intersubjective relation is foregrounded and the object-subject relation recedes (sections D and F, below). Sections A, B, C, and F exhibit epistemic ―grades‖, while D and E do not. These ―grades‖ are appropriately described as ―degrees of confidence in judgment rather than representative of ―degrees of truth‖.

A. Focus on object, speaker is inside the description of object or is foregrounded.
With this set, the speaker is inside the description of the object, or foregrounded. This is accomplished through realis features (demonstratives and or the indicative mood, references to personal experience of motive or cause, as well as to accomplished or completed actions in the past). This set exhibits an epistemic scale of relative grades of understanding.
3.3.2.1 wãke.
This is a strong assertive form that usually functions as a particle. A speaker bears witness to evidence from the past that no longer exists. Wãke does not mark first-hand evidence, but strong and justifiable

58

conviction. For example, it is frequently used in anetu tagiñu, „hereditary leaders‘ talk‘, a style of ritual communication where the speaker references knowledge directly passed down from other leaders. (See further discussion in Basso, 1987; 2009). The syntactic, grammatical and semantic functions of wãke are more complex than most of the other epistemic morphemes. Considering the syntactic functions of wãke , in all examples the particle (like other EM) always modifies the first impermeable (phrasal) constituent. However, in many especially strong assertions (as in contexts of anger, shock or disappointment) wãke appears at the end of each phrasal constituent and clearly functions as a particle. In this regard, the syntactic functions of such repeated scoping seem to also suggest that wãke must have an important affective function that complements the epistemic function.

a. A woman accuses her husband of killing her mother; this example includes the mirative =seku, the EM =ŋapa (strong probability) and the EM wãke.
ege=seku=ŋapa wãke ukw- oto e-ni wãke tis-iña, you-MIR EM EM dual-parent kill-NEM 1+3-BEN

wege wãke. you EM ‗I was shocked to realize you, the killer of our parent, preyed on us, that it was you.‘

b. Someone tries to discover the identity of a person in disguise:

uwa=ma wãke efinano i-ñïgï wãke, uwa i-ñalï. Q-EM EM Obr EX-TR EM Q EX-MAL ‗What became of his older brother? Did something happen to him again?‘

c.

The leader Kambe tells about the ceremonial actions of his

ancestors; in this example the epistemic feature is highlighted by

the appearance of wãke in sentence final position and prosodic

emphasis; the epistemic feature is complemented by the initial

assertive EXP

ah figu-mbï-ki-ge-tu-al≈igei

wãke

EXP grandchild-FO-INST-again-N-UT≈IDEM EM

‘Surely, as I‘ve been told about the grandchildren from the past,

so again this same thing always here.‘

d. This is an extreme example of the use of this morpheme after virtually every clause (and an oblique argument) in the utterance. The context is an abducted woman‘s strong declaration to her brothers of what had happened to her in the past:

afïtï-e-ku-ti=mbale wãke ukuge-fïŋï wãke denial-EP-ADV=CAT EM human-unlike EM

e. In this example, upon hearing that his friend is the lone survivor of a massacre, the speaker declares that was why he didn‘t join them earlier, expecting to have to avenge them all.

3.3.2.2. =tifa:

The speaker asserts her memory of a recent event that she personally experienced, though there appears to be a bit of doubt. As I noted earlier, this translation emphasizes there is an evidential component to the meaning of this morpheme. On the other hand, the listener may judge the speaker‘s assertion as a lie.

a.

Here Grandmother Quail deliberately lies to her grandsons.

b. Here the speaker seems to be sincerely trying to remember:

‗I don‘t recall I was angry with your son when he came to shake me.‘
.‘

3.3.2.3 =nika:
The speaker recognizes a strong probability and is seeking confirmation, usually in the form of questions. This is often heard used in mourning when the grieving person wails to the deceased.
a. The following is a common greeting: The sudden appearance of a person can be somewhat problematic. The person could be, after all, an apparition, a dangerous itseke, a ‗powerful being‘ disguised as a loved one.
ande=nika wege. Here/now EM you ‘It seems as if you‘re here now.‘
(to which the listener answers, using the probability alignment EM =taka): Eh, ande=taka uge. Yes, here.now=EM me ‗―Yes, as you probably can tell, I‘m here now.‘
b. Upon seeing turtle‘s eggs that are much smaller than people anticipated, someone says:
ule=nika figei AFR=EM A ADEM ‗I guess this is just how they are.‘

c. A husband is anxiously looking for his wives and comes to a place where he expects to find them. He politely asks some other women if his wives are there:

aŋi=nika inde u-oku-ŋi-ta

i-ŋi-lë e-feke-ne

result=EM here 1-liquid food-Vt-CI 3-see-PI 2-ERG-PL

‗Perhaps you‘ve seen those who make my food around here.‘

3.3.2.4 =laka

The speaker suspects there is a possibility for understanding, but there is puzzlement in the face of evidence.

a. uwa=mbe=laka u-mugu i-ñïgï

Q-SS=E,

1-son EX-TR

‗How could this have happened to my son?‘

61

b. A person turned monstrous looks for another victim whom he obsessively calls his ―brother-in-law‖:

unde=laka u-fameti a-Ø-nïgï

kaah

where=EM 1-bro-in-law EXP-say to-PD FRUST

‗Where in the world is my brother-in-law?‘

c. In a story, the Trickster tells his friend to get some firewood, but friend only sees people. Trickster tells him that what he sees are the trees, and he then expresses wonder at the constant illusions and deceptions that now surround him in adult life (that are characteristic of himself as a trickster, in other words):

igei-a=laka u-at-їfїgї, igei-a≈gage. IDEM-U=EM 1-EQ-PAC, IDEM-U≈same ‗I don‘t know why I‘m behaving just like this, the same as this.‘

3.3.2.5 =ma

Used as a clitic, this form references the speaker‘s uncertainty due to lack of knowledge. It is used mainly, but not exclusively, with interrogative forms.

a.

A narrator questions how someone in his story could put a large

fish inside a small flute:

ta-me=ma

kuluta atati tu-i-ŋalï

i-feke?:

CONT-FACS=EM flute inside PB-put-REV 3-ERG

‗How could he have put it back inside something like that flute?‘

b. People are looking for a man who might have abducted their relative. The following section of the conversation is between the people being asked about it and the people searching for her:

tї=ma≈gei kuge Ø-nїgї-t=i-feke RQ-EM-IDEM person say.to-PS-EV=3-ERG ‗ ―Who is that person?‖ that‘s what they say he asked him.‘

u-funa-lї -feke 1-search -for-PI-ERG ‗Who knows? It seems we don‘t even know as yet which brother of ours we‘re looking for.‘ .

62

c. Discussing a story about an abducted woman, the narrator explains to me that the Kalapalo didn‘t want to kill the woman‘s abductor:

ñalї-tsї=ma tu-e-lu Kalapalo-feke Negative-M=EM O-kill-PI Kalapalo-ERG ‗I don‘t think the Kalapalo would have killed him‘.

tї –tomi=ma tu-e-lu RQ-PURP=EM REF-kill-PI ‗Was there some reason to kill him?‘

3.3.2.6 =maŋa

The speaker, while enunciating a proposition, at the same time denies any possibility of its occurrence; this form is used to express incredulity, often with the rhetorical (y/n) question prefix tї. (‗I can‟t believe you‟re asking/saying (X) as you and I both well know the answer‟.)

a.

The Trickster proposes that he make the same kinds of rare and

beautiful things given to his younger brother.

um tï-kïtsï=maŋa t-iŋuG-isi

Taugi ki-lї

‗Who says this is hard to make?‖ (=‖This is easy to make‖),

Taugi spoke.‟

b. A leader‘s ritual communication is often filled with this kind of ironic statement, a kind of respectful devaluation of the work of his own messengers:

tї-kaїŋa-fїŋï=maŋa Ø-atsa-ki-lї atehe= gele-fa

wãke

RQ-beside-unlike=EM 3-run-Vt-PI EQS-PER= PT-PTP EM

‗Who says they aren‘t still made to run up to a place as they had

done in the past? (i.e., ‗They do still run…‘)

c.

A man‘s wife finds it hard to believe her husband seduced her

younger sister.

3.3.2.7 =kaɳa

63

The event has occurred and the speaker is taking responsibility for a faulty decision.

a.

ukw-oto-feke kiŋi at-ïfïgï-ko

ige-tomi.

dual-relative-ERG EM EQA-IMP-PL take.away-PERM

‘How could I have let him take us away for this. I regret I let

our relative take us away‘.

B: Focus on object, speaker is outside the description of object or not
foregrounded
In this set, the focus is upon the object, but the speaker excludes herself from the sphere of the object description, usually drawn as irrealis through unobserved or unobservable 3P motivation or causality, and incompletive aspect. An epistemic scale of grades of understanding is present.

3.3.2. 8 =ŋapa

This is a strong, assertive form used where certainty is expressed. Some examples suggest ŋapa is used by speakers in their narratives as a ―hearsay‖ evidential strategy (See line 5 Appendix B).

a.

The speaker has been asked to identify something they‘ve found

on a sandbank:

koh, kuge ite=ŋapa-fa=le=gei EX, human feces=EM-PTP-UT=IDEM ‗I don't know, but it seems to be human shit to me‘.

b. The Trickster gets fire: He makes a decoy out of the rotten body of a deer to lure the vultures, whose messengers tell them:

anetu otu=dye=ŋapa-fa

felei

leader solid.food=SR=EM-PTP ADEM

‗That looks like someone put food for the leader down there.‘

next.day-LOCA ADEM ceremony REF-perform-DES-N-PURP

‗Apparently they came back at the very end of the day (because)

the following day they wanted to perform the ceremony‘.

3.3.2.9 =tata

64

There is some uncertainty, but probability from customary experience exists. The action involved a 3rd person and therefore the speaker could
not know for certain that the event took place.

a.

igifagafïtï anetu-gu uŋu a-nïgï=tata i-feke:

(settlement name) leader-POSS house EQ-PS=EM 1-ERG:

‗Possibly there‘s a house for the Igifagafiti leader.‘

b. A woman recounts another's actions based on common female experience, but since the event took place in the far distant past, the speaker isn‘t entirely certain of the accuracy of what she‘s saying.

lepene atu-ndi-li=tata i-feke then tap-Vt-PI=EM 3-ERG ‗Then I think she might have tapped on it‘

3.3.2.10 =fïna.

With this clitic, the speaker expresses the idea that there is some evidence but it is weak.

a.

The following is a typical remark after the Trickster does

something covertly:

Taugi-fïna-mbe Taugi - EM-SR ‗It might have been Taugi who did that‘

b. Grandmother Quail sees that some children have pulled up all her peanuts. =fïna appears in this example with the mirative =seku, which in this example has scope over both utterances. =fïna has scope over the last utterance only.

tï-seku- ma egei u-etigite-gï-ki-ga=tiga. RQ-MIR- EM DEM 1-peanuts-POSS-INST-CI=HAB

eŋï oto-ni-nïgï-ko=fïna=seku-fa. reason food-non.existent-PS-PL=EM-MIR-PTP ‗What do I see here? Someone's been messing with my peanuts. Could it be that‘s because they‘re having trouble finding food of their own?‘

c. The forest monster is frightened by a man who disguises himself as an owl in order to chase him away:

adyafi=fïna≈tsa (owl) EM≈EX;CL „That must be an adafi I‟m seeing„ (this owl is a bad sign to the observer).

65

3.3.2.11 koh

The speaker has no knowledge of what is being described. This morpheme is most often a particle. It is also included in the expressives list in Chapter 12.

a. Taugi teaches women how to use piqui. One of the women asks the Trickster:

aŋi- fogi=kalaka të-iñambe=nïm-iŋo koh result -response≈EM O-drink- Vt-POT EM ‗I don‘t know but could a drink be made out of this sometime?‘

b. A husband returns and begins to burn a pile of brush in which, unknowingly, his wife‘s lover is hiding. When the man runs away to escape the fire, the husband says to his wife:

ukuge wende e-ki-nu koh-i u-feke person over.there 2-utter-N EM-CL I-ERG ‗Why didn‘t you tell me there was someone over there?‘

c.

Several brothers, frustrated in not having found their sister in a

nearby settlement, say the following to one another:

uwa=m≈igei ukw-iŋandsu i-ñїgї. What -EM≈IDEM dual-sister EX-TR ‗What could have happened to our sister?‘

koh. la=gele-fa

ukw-iŋandsu i-tsa-ni

EM. like.that=PT-PTP dual-sister EX-CL-ANT

‗Who knows? Our sister will remain like that forever.‘

C. Focus on person in subjectivity In this epistemic set, the focus on the speaker‘s own self as an
affective actor, and thus the morpheme used is closely correlated with person status. The speaker‘s affect is also highlighted. Feelings of anger, fear, distress, worry are most usually not mentioned in a narrator‘s metacommentary unless she wishes to refer to the person‘s talk, not ―inner feelings‖.

3.3.2.12 =tafa

A first-person form, referencing the speaker‘s own subjectivity in an assertive way. (tafa is homophonic with the words for ―gourd water container‖, and ―duck‖).

a.

Cuckoo‘s mother tells him to come home right away if his

fiancée decides she doesn‘t want him after all, and he answers:

66

sagage-dye=tafa u-en-ïmi-ŋo

ama

3-same-SA=EM 1-come back-Vi-POT mother (vocative)

‗I will come back, Mother, just as you've described‘

b. The speaker describes how the Trickster copulated before he learned about erections from Lizard:

ule et- iku-ta=tafa≈le≈gei AFR MV-copulate-Vt-CI= EM≈UT≈IDEM i-ñatï-gï-ki, 3-finger-POSS-INST ‗That‘s how he made love all the time, with his finger,

Taugi-feke tu-fits-au iku-ta Taugi-ERG REF-wife-PL copulate--CI how Taugi made love to his wives.‘

c.

When the door isn‘t opened for a man who has turned himself

into a monster, he says to the people hiding inside:

ande=tafa u-a-nïgï here.now=EM 1-EQ-PS ‗I‘m here, I‘m telling you!‖ or, ―Can‘t you hear me? I‘m here.‘

3.3.2.13 =kafa

This morpheme is used when the speaker addresses a 2P assertively, seeking alignment with that person, but still focused on the 2P subject: ―now you (do) know”, “do you know?”; there may be worry or concern (kato, as in 4.12), but in the context of the speaker‘s own conviction perhaps not being shared or understood:

a.

A grandfather explains to his grandson why the younger man‘s

brother keeps sending him to dangerous places:

efiñano-feke= kafa fegei ege ku-ni-ta older bro-ERG=EM ADEM you envy-Vt-CR ‗I want you to know that‘s because your older brother enviess you‘.

b. Agouti is telling the Trickster where his wives are hiding:

aŋi=kafa tu-fu-ti

result=EM REF-know-ADV 2-ERG Agouti utter-PI

‗Don‘t you know what‘s going on?‘ Agouti asked.‘

c. The leader asks one of his fellows to participate in a ceremonial gathering, hoping he will agree but worrying that he will be turned down:

aŋi=kafa të-ip-ïgï

e-feke

67

‗Do you know if you can make payment?‘

d. A father asks men in a distant community if they know of anyone who for lack of a wife might have abducted his daughter:

aŋi=kafa inde iñaka-puŋu-fïgï-ko

iñandsu-ko-feke

i-tsa-ta-i-fofo EX-CL-DIS-CL-IM ‗Do you know of someone here among you who the sisters found unlikeable as a partner?‘

3.3.2.14 =kato The speaker aligns with a 3rd person, and thus the evidence is somewhat
weak, puzzling, or even worrisome.

a.

People are trying to kill jaguars. They come to a community to

see if some youths can be prepared as warriors:

e-ata-dye=kato ku-mugu-ko-feke ukw-opi-dyï-ko-iŋo 2-EQA-SA=EM 1+2-son PL-ERG 1+2-avenge-PI- PL-POT ‗I‘m not sure, but if you do (what we‘ve asked) to them, our children just might avenge us.‘

b. From a Kwambï ritual song sung by the song leader Kudyu:

oi-ñe-mbe=kato ti-ka-gi-ti-feke wind.up-N-SS= EM REFL-make-Vt-DES=3-ERG ‗I‘m worried he wants to make those wound-up things.‟

c. Relatives caution their younger nephew about nearby enemies.

d. This example uses =kato in a question:

uwa-ma egei oto=mbe=kato egei tue-ni nїg≈i-feke? Q-EM PDEM owner=SS=EM PDEM kill-AN 3-PS≈3-ERG

68

‗How do you think the owner was able to kill him?‘, he asked him.

3.3.2.15 =tiki

With this form, the speaker denies another‘s statement; or even the very evidence of her own eyes (with indicatives). This form often has mirative semantics (as examples (a) and (b) below suggest). In fact the form might be derived from the negative mirative clitic –ki (this is a highly polysemous morpheme).

a.

A warrior denies that he has come to kill people, because he‘s

only there to marry a woman.

ta=tiki e-lï-ko-iña

u-e-nalï

NEG=EM 2-kill-PI-DAT/BEN 1-come.to-REV

‗Why should anyone say I‘ve come back here to kill you all?‘

b. A grandfather sees his two grandsons for the first time. This example is interesting for its miraspective tone:

ah ande-ŋu=tiki

u-fi-dyau a-nïgï

EX here/now-DIM EM 1-g.child-PL EQS-PS

‗These little ones here can‘t be my grandchildren!‘

c.

A woman has been abducted by powerful beings and left in her

hammock tied to palms growing in the middle of a lake. When

she wakes up, she says:

una=tiki egei u-e-tïfïgï how= EM-DEM 1-come.to- PAC ‗How in the world did I get here?‘

D. Focus on changing subjectivity, correctives Forms in this set are used when the speaker‘s mind has changed
in response to another person‘s correction (or denial) of their original statement.

3.3.2.16 =maki

There is reevaluation from doubt or rejection to acceptance of a proposition: ‗I‘m right (or wrong) after all"; ―now I realize‘

a.

The speaker uses maki with the assertive expressive ah, ‗surely‘.

A person who thought the river was somewhere else sees it and

realizes his mistake:

ah, ande= maki fanguiŋa-lefa, Ø-nïg=i-feke EX here/now= EM river-MT say to-PERF=1-ERG ‗"Surely, that river‘s here after all", he said.‘

69

b. =maki used with the ―thinking, imagining, realizing‖ expressive uum. The speaker had rejected the proposition earlier, but has seen for himself how wrong he was to do so:

u:m, ande=maki fotugu-i- is-uwï a-tsa-ki-lï EX here.now=EM first-CL 3-father run-Vi-PI ‗It does now seem to me that his father was actually the first to run over here, as you said.‘ . c. A man who had been abducted as a child realizes he and his sister are actually members of another group:

afïtï =maki Tugumai-fïŋï ku-kuge denialEM Trumai-unlike 1+2-people) ‗I've been wrong, our people aren't Trumai.‘

3.3.2.17 =makina

With this form, the speaker moves from rejection to acceptance of a
negative proposition: ―you‟re right, it‟s not‖, past tense; demonstratives, 3rd person (cf. 4.19, the contra-spective kiŋi (“it‘s too bad…‖)

a.

A woman tells her lover that her husband has killed her mother.

She uses the ah expressive to assert her understanding, which

comes from her first-hand knowledge of evidence:

ah, aŋ-olo-dye-tsï=makina=k≈igei EX, EQS-ADV-SA-M=EM≈EM≈IDEM ‗Surely, I realize now that it‘s true, this is what happened to her after all as you can see for yourself.‘

b. A man uses the polite reference to his parent-in-law:
ukw-oto=fo-ko=makina ege, ukw-oto-fo-ko dual-parent-COLL-PL=EM PDEM, dual-parent-COLL-PL ‗Now I realize that‘s not our parent, our parent.‘

3.3.2.18 =pile

The speaker moves from acceptance to rejection of a proposition.

a. A young man has agreed to go to dangerous places to get something for his brother (whose wife is his lover), but finally realizes the brother is trying to kill him.

2. From a story about a female powerful being:

‗I mistakenly thought my pubic ornament would be here.‘

E. Contra-spective. I write ‗contra-spective‘ rather than ‗counter-factive‘ as these
morphemes are used in response to the imaginative subjectivity (overt or not) of the speaker. Something is observed or stated by another, but the mind of the speaker wishes against all evidence it were otherwise, knowing there is at best a very remote possibility of that happening. The use of these morphemes often marks the beginning of some wonderful stories! The two particles (kiŋi and mukwe) clearly have both epistemic and affective meanings but their second position location suggests they are properly placed with the other EM. However, there are some exceptions. In 4.3.18.(c) mukwe precedes nifa, suggesting the former is serving affective functions. Clearly more examples need to be examined for further clarification of the semantic roles of these and other particles.
3.3.2.19 =kiŋi negative contra-spective
The speaker wishes something were not what it actually is (in response to another); it can be glossed as “too bad”, “regrettably‖, ―were it not so”. This EM may be an idiom derived from the intransitive verb ki-, ―utter‖. There is a plural form with the suffix –ni. (See example 4). This generally occurs as a clitic.
a. A person from the Fish World decides he‘s going to put his own new field right next to the small clearing belonging to his wife‘s sister‘s

71
husband, who is a poor gardener but ridicules this character for not working. In fact he will make a magically large field with magical crops.
In this example =kiŋi is hosted by the deictic nominal ige-i-ŋa (IDEM-CL-N), ‗a place like this‘ yet the scope of the particle in this sentence covers the entire utterance, since the speaker emphasizes the work he will do in the future. The speaker‘s manner of describing the work itself is a typical self-abnegating affinal posturing that suggests he will actually do something extraordinary.

ige-i-ŋa=kiŋi=mbe-tsa-ŋe a-fasї-ŋiso tafau-ki-te-lї u-feke. PDEM-CL-N=EM=SS-EX-I 2-Oz-husband expand-ADV-PI 1-ERG ‗Unfortunately he‘s wanted to make a place like this, because I‘ve decided to increase the size of your older sister‘s husband (‗s clearing).‘

b. A man walking alone suddenly has what appears to be a dangerous apparition. He asks himself:

Uwa≈fitsa-tu=kiŋi fegei Q-hallucinate-N=EM ADEM ‗Why should it be me who sees this apparition?‘

c.

A person is going to do something to the Otters and asks them

not to call out to him even if it hurts them badly:

kaŋa-siŋi

ke-ke-ŋe=kiŋi= mba u-feke, Ø-ta

Fish-follow.behind NEG-utter-I =EM=XR 1-ERG, tell-CI 1-

i-feke. ERG ‗―Fish Follower,‘ even if you want to you‘re not to say that to me‖, he told (them).‘

3.3.2.20 mukwe
This may function as either a clitic or a particle. It references a positive contra-spective stance. The speaker ―wishes that something were so‖, appealing to the listener for agreement: ‗hope you agree‘ (though there is sometimes no direct conversation),. When used with imperative strategies, it has a polite sense of, ―I‘d like to do X (even if in vain)‖. The sense of something being done ―in vain‖ is also sometimes heard when mukwe appears repeatedly in the leader‘s ritual communication (3.3.2.18 c). This is another epistemic particle that often appears after each clause in an utterance (d.).

72

a. Some brothers reach the settlement of a man who has abducted their sister and tell this man they wish to take her back home with them. They are using a very polite register, much like affinal relatives would use:

ei-ŋoku 2-messenger(s) ‗surely, I hope they arrived quickly, your messengers‘

d. Another example of affinal civility; the speaker is making a suggestion but doesn‘t want to appear that he is too knowing:
eɳї=mukwe-tsї-fa fesoko apu-Gi-tsofo=mukwe-tsї-fa reason=EM-M-PTP fish flavor-PERM-USIN=EM-M-PTP

ku-pehe-ne. 1+2-ERG-PL ‗Because that might be how we could make some flavoring for our fesoko, though I doubt it will work out.‘

F. Intersubjectivity: Alignments; appeals to another with grades of confidence These forms reference various grades of alignments, during
which the speaker is including herself and the listener in the sphere of the action.

3.3.2.21 =aka

The speaker declares there is existing, positive alignment between herself and the listener:

73

a. The speaker plans to take revenge after hearing about the death of some comrades:

ande dy=aka

ti-ñ-en-ïm-iŋo

‗You‘re right about that, this time we others will go back in

c. The Dead are invited to return to the living but decline:

3.3.2.22 =taka

The speaker suggests the listener will most likely agree with her proposition. In my examples, taka is seen with rhetorical questions, indicative mood, and demonstratives.

a.

A man offers his daughters to a potential enemy; this example

has both mukw-e and taka. This utterance is typical of the affinal

civility register style, in which the speaker devalues a potential

gift (Basso 2007). Here, that gift is his daughters:

aŋi = mukwe= taka i taũ-go-pïngï fogi-tsïgï u- feke. result= EM=EM woman-PAU-DEF find-PAC 1-ERG ‗Though you might not really care, most likely you‘ll see there are some deficient women I‘ve found.‘

b. The speaker asks a listener to help him remember someone‘s name:

uwa=taka i-ñandsu ititï, Kamisu? What=EM 3-sister name, (name) ‗What did I say the sister‘s name was? Kamisu?‘

c.

The Maned Wolf reminds his abducted wife—now pregnant—

that he had told her to not walk over his semen; this example

illustrates the use of ki- (utter) as a hearsay evidentiality strategy.

74

inde fe-tsa-ŋe ke-te-ŋa u-ki-ta-ti=taka e-feke this place DEO-EX-I NEG-go-N 1-say-CI-EV=EM 2-ERG ‗I don‘t want you to even think about walking around here‘, I‘m pretty sure I heard myself telling you that.‘ (or, ―I‘m pretty sure you heard me keep telling you that‖)

3.3.2.23 = tsїna

There is strong probability for the speaker‘s assertion about the listener‘s experience, but no direct evidence.

a.

ti-ŋi=tsïna e-feke kuge-feke te-ŋelï.

REF-see-EM 2-ERG people-ERG eat.flesh-REP

‗You‘ve seen it I‘m sure, people eat it all the time.‘

3.3.2.24 =kalaka
With this form, the speaker suggests a possible alignment with a listener. This form is used with questions, demonstratives, passing state perfective nominal aspect, and potential mood.
a. Women ask the Trickster about how to use a new fruit:

aŋi fog=kalaka të-iñambe=nïm-iŋo result respond=EM O-drink-Vi-POT ‗Don‘t you think a drink could be made out of this sometime?‘

b. The speaker is speaking sadly as if to imply he‘s been turned down after he offered to go someplace.
aŋi=kalaka ukw-oto iŋu-kugu-mbo-lï result=EM dual-parent turn down-completely-Vi-PI ‗Has our parent decided not to go(someplace)?‘

c. Conversation between Ohe and EB about usage:

ege muku-gu ipo-pïgï=kalaka egei-i PDEM son-POSS pierce-PS=EM IDEM-CL ‗Don‘t you think her son‘s ears were pierced?‘

ah-la-tsï,

EXP-like.that-M, PDEM son-POSS 3- pierce-PS EX-CL IDEM

‗Surely that‘s right, her son‘s ears have been pierced.‘

3.3.2.25 =nipa

75

In the context of a dispute, this EM marks an offer (or possibility) of alignment on the part of the speaker, who suggests the two could agree with her proposition (if only the listener would think through the proposition carefully enough.) Here the complement verb, ‗see, think‘ in imperative mood (iŋ-ge), is used, as in 4.22.a. =nipa is also seen in examples that reference the distant past, where the speaker can only infer impressions of 3rd persons, as in 4.22.b.

a. A warrior is addressing his relative, a person with little experience:

iŋ-ge

elu-mbe-tsï=nipa

a-piga i-feke-ne

look/think-I kill-SR-M=EM

2-club-CI 3-ERG-PL

‗Think carefully, don‘t you realize if (that‘s what you were to

do) they would club us to death?‘

b. The narrator tells me how beautiful her ancestors were compared with some strangers they had encountered while out fishing. The speaker‘s use of the adverb ekugu (perfectly, fully, most intensive, completely) and the EM nipa references the impressions of others, no longer present:

teh ekugu-mbe= nipa u-kuge nice fully –SS=EM 1-people ‗My people might have looked really beautiful when that happened (=when other people saw them.)‘ or ‗When they did that they might have seen how beautiful our people were.‘

c.

In the context of a dispute about traveling, foreign visitors keep

insisting upon going in a certain direction, even though others

repeatedly show them the direction to travel so as to avoid

enemies:

la= nip≈e-te-ke,

Atatsinu-kai=nip≈e-te-ke

distant.place =EM=2-go-I, Atatsinu-LOC= EM≈2-go-I,

la.

distant.place

‗You should go way over there, along (the side of) the Atatsinu

(creek), you should go way over that way (even though you

don‘t want to).‘

3.3.2.26 =nafa
This morpheme is used when the speaker wishes to appeal to a listener who may have used a =nika question, such as 4.2.(c). =nafa then confirms 2P experience, as in ―as you know, as you have seen‖.

76

a.

e-fife-po-lï 2-bite-HYP-PI ‗You must know if you were to touch me, the tocandira ant would sting you‘

b. While introducing the character named Cuckoo, the storyteller confirms that I should already know what he‘s talking about, as he was keenly aware I had already worked with others identifying Kalapalo bird names:

fitsagu, tu-fu-ti-sï=nafa cuckoo, REF-know-ADV-PEJ=EM

‗Cuckoo‘, you must already know yourself what that is‘.

imït-oŋo-tsï=nafa face-NLOC-M=EM ‗‖Over to the surface on the other side is their customary place,‖ that‘s what I said, over to the (surface of) the sandbank on the other side.‘

3.3.2.27 =nifa

The speaker asserts alignment is necessary, that it must occur. This occurs with the imperative mood and also frequently the speaker uses the consideration complement iŋge, „see, think‘.

a. A person tells his mother to think about how he and his wife look:

iŋ-ge=nifa

ukw ï-iŋ-ge,

see.think-I =EM dual-see-I

‗Consider how we look to you‘.

b. The Trickster tells his brother they have to visit their grandmother right away:

ukw-atsa-ke=nifa dual-run-I=EM

ku-nitsu-na, 1+2-grandmother-ALL

77
‗We really should hurry over to that grandmother of ours". Or, ―This means we must hurry over to that grandmother of ours‘.

3.3.2.28 =(p)apa (CO), (CONF)

The speaker is completely agreeing with a previous speaker‘s proposal. The morpheme =apa is used when the speaker encourages the listener to perform a desired activity. =papa occurs when the speaker is cooperating, agreeing to join the listener in the proposed activity (CO is used as the gloss in this case).

a.

ohsi=papa

HORT=EM

―Let‘s do it as you say.‖

b. ah, e-fisï-tomi=papa ege-na

3.4. Taxis clitics
Following Roman Jakobson, I use the term ―taxis‖ for markers of phasal relations between events. Jakobson used this Greek term to refer to a set of morphemes that ―characterize the narrated event in relation to another narrated event and without reference to the speech event..‖ (1971: 135). This term seems particularly apt for the forms in Kalapalo. Cognate forms (sometimes referred to as ―non-modal‖ particles or clitics) have been described for Northern Carib languages (Carlin 2004; Derbyshire 1985, 1999; Hoff 1990; Meira 1999).
Taxis morphemes normally involve one kind of tenseless temporal marking of clauses within reference clause chains. The taxis clitic occurs hosted by a verb phrase describing an event in the marked clause; the clitic references the relation between this marked event and another event-description occurring in a preceding clause (i.e., an event constructed in a perfective or imperfective aspect); this second event may be alluded to anaphorically with the anaphoric topic referent, which will host the taxis clitic. As I describe in Chapters 5 and 7, aspectual temporal marking occurs on both verbs and nouns. These clitics bind with various clause constituents, are important for linking dominant and subordinate clauses, and play an important role in clause chaining processes (described in detail in Chapter 14 on Discourse Processes and Grammar). My data show 13 of these forms, summarized in Table 10.

3.4.1 Syntactic features

In this section I discuss the position of the taxis morpheme in the phonological word and taxis morpheme clustering.
The most frequently used taxis morphemes are =lefa (metonymic or contingent event; MT); =(h)fale (new, overlapping event; NO); and gehale, ‗again‘ which has particle status. Forms =koguwa (UN) and =tiga (HAB) carry strong affective meanings. In this regard these taxis forms overlap in semantic function with the separate set of affective clitics described in 3.2. In the following examples, I discuss syntactic features of taxis clitics, showing the use of the most frequent taxis forms. These examples are followed by examples of the less frequently used morphemes.
Taxis clitics appear in final position in the VP, as in (a) in which the marked VP is linked as a consequence to the immediately preceding clause (not shown here). In (a) this occurs by means of a metonymic taxis marker (=lefa: coordinate event). As the marked clause is repeated at the end of this utterance, both taxis marking and the verbal component of the main clause are optional in the repetition.

a.

u-api-lï=lefa i-feke-ni, u-api-lï.

1-beat-PI=MT 1-ERG-PL, 1-beat-PI

‗And so they beat me, beat me.‘

Taxis clitics may co-occur or cluster if the marked clause describes an event that is part of another larger event. In example (b), the different taxis clitic (DT) =tale is followed by the new overlapping event taxis (NO) marker =fale with a demonstrative following to end the clause. . The DT marker here makes reference to events in the immediately prior chain in which there is description of other things that are ongoing but which are going to take place somewhat differently.

b . angikogo-feke= tale=fale fegei i-fu-pïte-ga-ko gehale fierce people-ERG=DT=NO DEM-CL 3-run-Vt-CI-PL again ‗But this time it was from the fierce people that they were running away from again.‘

c.

In this ‗rhetorical, ‗yes-no‘ question‘ example, both local

adverbial demonstrative and VP are marked with the NO (‗new

overlapping taxis event) marker. In the VP the habitual taxis

marker =tiga (HAB) precedes the new event morpheme and

reappears on the following subordinate verb:

tï=ma inde=hale ti-tsa=tiga=hale i-fa-ta=tiga RQ=EM here-NO REF-EX-HAB-NO 3-tell-CI-HAB e-iña-ni? 2-DAT/BEN-PL ―Could it be that someone who stayed here came from time to time to talk with you?‖

80

d. In this example, the ‗new, overlapping event‘ clitic (h)fale (NO) achieves independent word (particle) status, perhaps being emphasized for discourse reasons:

tafa

ige-funde

iŋke,

bottle.gourd PDEM-ADV think/see,

iñalï=lefa=hale, ta≈gï-ti-lefa

tis-iña

no.longer-MT=NO, DIS≈throw-DES=MT 1+3-DAT/BEN

‗Draped around the bottle gourd, but now, consider that it‘s not

any longer (used) because we‘ve decided to throw it away.‘

Example (e) demonstrates a speaker‘s use of taxis clitics to link clauses in a chain with only one finite verb, appearing at the end of the chain. (The cluster of ideophones in the second clause of (e, i) may be treated as a pseudo-transitive construction, as it references the sounds of objects being acted upon: the arrow cane that is being cut down by the uncle.) While there is only one transitive verb, the action of the single actor in this chain is contrasted with that of others described earlier in the narrative by the taxis particles. This example shows how taxis particles can cluster and supplement one another. The speaker is contrasting the slow work of the untrained uncle (an ―ordinary person‖ and the villain in the story) with the quick and efficient harvesting of arrow cane by warriors who need to be always ready to enter into battle with enemies. In (i) there are three different taxis clitics, the new, sequential event taxis (NO) form (=fale ) being repeated three times. This form references the uncle‘s antithetical act of slowly (not quickly, as do his skillful relatives) cutting down the cane. In the second line, there is a compounded clitic; =gele marks the persistent action (PT) of the uncle cutting arrow cane. =fale (referencing a different event/state overlapping the event described in a preceding clause; NO) prepares us for the new finite verb (the stative verb –fu- ―know about‖) at the end of the chain: iñalï funïm≈ifeke, ―he didn‘t know about it”. (The uncle as actor is ignorant of something contextually important).

The speaker‘s reference in this example to the constant replacement of

administrative post) are, through use of the new, overlapping event (NO)

taxis clitic -fale), contrasted with the status of Kalapalo leaders, who are

hereditary and normally serve for much of their adult lives. In the final

line, a final intransitive clause (kagayfa anetu-gu eti-dyï=lefa: ‘the

Christian

leaders resign‘) hosts the metonymic =lefa clitic, which

marks the chain boundary and serves as the reference point for the entire

chain. In this way the taxis clitic enables listeners to compose a

coordinated whole of sequenced events. Further discussion of taxis and

embedded clause chains appears in Chapter 14: Grammar in Narrative

3.5. Interclausal reference markers
One final set of clitics must be mentioned here. Kalapalo is a language with a complex system of interclausal reference marker clitics (IRM) binding to nouns, verbs and adverbial constituents of clauses. Six of these are ―basic‖ operators, the rest are compounds (meaning the elements can function separately). In Chapter 14, where I describe the structures involved in clause chaining characteristic of extended narrative discourse, I describe this set in detail. In this chapter there are numerous examples used for other purposes that show instances of IRM usage.

3. 6 The clitic/particle distinction in Kalapalo
Particles have been considered by Carib linguists to be a distinct, closed word class (Carlin 2004: 69; Derbyshire 1999; Hoff 1990; Meira and Gildea nd). Derbyshire defines Carib particles as follows: “Most of these are always postposed to other constituents, never occurring alone or as the initial constituent in a phrase. They are never inflected, nor can they have derivational suffixes added (both of which are possible with other types of postpositions....)‖ (1999: 53). Carlin defines the particles of the Trio language as follows: ―Particles are defined by their lack of ability to take any morphology or undergo any morphological processes‖ (2004, p. 69). These definitions conform to most of the important features of both Kalapalo enclitics and particles. But another important feature of particles, relevant to the discussion in this chapter is that they stand alone as both a phonological word with their own stress pattern and as a grammatical word, in some cases being paired with a clitic or another particle. For these reasons particles differ from clitics. The latter not only have no distinct morphology and are hosted by the phonological word that immediately precedes their presence, but when paired with another clitic manifest regressive vocalic elision but do not manifest any special stress pattern. In Kalapalo, while there is a semantically distinct class of discourse particles (see Chapter 12: Small Word Classes), some morphemes discussed in this chapter may be regarded as either clitics or particles, depending upon their phonological behavior in a syllabic structure. Thus, it is not always easy to define a semantically distinct set of morphemes as a distinct particle word class in the language. Hoff recognized this problem in considering Carib (Karinya) elements, but defended his use of the term particle (1990: 495; see discussion in Derbyshire 1999: 53). While I used the term ―particle‖ to describe epistemic markers in an earlier study (Basso 2008), my work on the

86
Kalapalo phonological word has caused me to change my opinion, and to consider them (in the main, with a few exceptions) as clitics. I prefer to discuss the sets of clitics and particles together as a whole because of their shared morphosyntactic features and to make the distinction between ―clitic‖ and ―particle‖ in Kalapalo represent a continuum of morphophonemic processes.
3.7. Problems with the definition of „modality‟
The presence of the Kalapalo epistemic class of clitics is a typologically important feature of the language. First, here are both syntactic and semantic distinctions between epistemic morphemes and evidentiality in the language. This feature provides evidence for the difficulties that are posed when authorities alternate the terms ‗epistemic‘ and ‗evidential‘, ‗mood‘ and ‗modality‘ (cf Palmer 1986 and Timberlake 2007).
While Kalapalo epistemic morphemes reference an evidential contrast between what Hoff calls ‗introspective‘ and ‗extrospective‘ evidence. Their function is to mark a speaker‘s judgments about such evidence. Kalapalo uses distinct epistemic grammatical features from those marking source of evidence (evidential suffixes, described in Chapter 12:7). Also, Kalapalo illocutionary force types (indicative, imperative, interrogative) are distinct grammatical categories that operate on the verb stem, syntactically as well as semantically different from the set of Kalapalo epistemic clitics (only some of which should be considered ‗modal‘).
Degrees of confidence are usually called ―modality‖, ranging from certainty, through probability, to possibility, then to weak and finally, an absence of knowledge (Lyons 1977). The term ―modality‖ is often used by Carib linguists, who have called such features ―modal‖ particles or clitics (Carlin 2004; Derbyshire, 1999; Franchetto nd; Hoff, 1986; Meira 1999). While epistemic modality in the sense of a ―scale‖ or ―grade‖ does occur in Kalapalo epistemology, there are important nonmodal features that emerge as speakers evaluate information, including incredulity (an extreme skepticism or unwillingness to believe), changes in a person‘s understanding (such as correctives), and counter-factive or contra-spective wishing or hoping. I thus prefer to not use the term ‗modality‘ for any grammatical features marked on the verb. Epistemic marking can be understood best as a pragmatic process contributing to the speaking subject‘s self-awareness as a participant in contexts where people pay attention to one another in a reciprocal way so as to learn something about one another‘s worlds and the values they share or dispute. Epistemic judgment is essentially a stance procedure.

4 Introduction to Kalapalo Word Classes
4.1 Overview
In addition to the clitic/particle class of Kalapalo words, there are eleven other basic grammatical (word) classes. These classes are distinguished according to 1) their primary stem formation processes, 2) the categorial inflections that they accept, 3) whether they are subject to derivational processes, and 4) their word order position within clauses. Of these eleven word classes, nouns and verbs are the two largest and open classes; adverbs are a somewhat smaller open class. All three (with their sub-classes), host a great variety of inflectional and secondary word class changing derivational morphology. These word class changing processes with a few exceptions do not occur with most members of the smaller, closed classes whose inflectional possibilities are also very limited. Listed according to approximate size from largest to smallest, these eight closed classes include: ideophones ,adjectives, interrogatives, demonstratives, expressives (including interjections and epistemic expressives), discourse particles, deontics, and the coordinator. Table 11 shows the types of inflectionand derivational processes allowed for the members of each word class (and subclass, where appropriate), as well as the place of a member of each word class in clausal word orders. Note that verbs, nouns and some adverbs, interrogatives, and demonstratives may be inflected with many of the same morphemes. This makes grammatical word class boundaries somewhat flexible. The understanding of ―word class‖ is also complicated by the derivational constructions, as de-verbal nominalizations behave more like verbs than nouns due to the preservation of verbal arguments in the non-verbal clause, and de-nominalized verbs retain some properties of nouns. There are also a large number of de-verbalized (de)adverbialized nominalizations.

The following list provides a summary introduction to the syntactic, grammatical and word order features of the word classes.

4.2 The major word classes

The three major open word classes are verbs, nouns and adverbs. They share a number of features in common, most importantly their open functioning and derivational constructions. Verbs and nouns also share person prefix marking, and members of both word classes exhibit aspectual marking (though these are morphologically and semantically different for each class). A lesser feature shared is the use of the dative/benefactive case marker as a ‗goal‘ marker on subordinate verb clauses.

4.2.1. Nouns

- Nouns can serve as heads of NP.

- Nouns function as arguments (S, A, O, and oblique) of the VP (including copular verb phrases). Nouns can be intransitive subjects (S), transitive subjects (A), transitive (and ditransitive) objects (O),including direct objects (DO), and obliques (Ob). Nouns occupy the O position in transitive and extended intransitive clauses, which is either immediately before the verb or separated from the verb phrase by an identificational demonstrative. DO NP of speech act verbs are marked with the ergative case and appear postposed to the verbal clause finally.

- Nouns host pronominal prefixes and plural concordance morphemes; case marking suffixes; possession suffixes and possessor prefixes; the – tsï modifier suffix; the switch-function –fa primary topical participant suffix; affective, epistemic, and locative clitics; and the class inclusion copula, negative, and unique suffixes.

- Nouns are subject to word class changing processes, involving derivational suffixes, including aspectual derivations in de-verbal and renominalized constructions and de-adverbial nominalizations;

- Arguments of VP show case (marked Ø for absolutive) as follows: [N+case suffix]. Such full NP arguments precede the VP (see a) as if foregrounded unless they are non-focalized A, in which case the argument follows the verb. A and S may be marked with a pronominal prefix rather than a full NP. Oblique arguments (Ob) normally follow the verb‘s DO argument; in the case of extended intransitives, they follow the verb.

90
- Nouns can serve as heads of possessed NP [possessor [personal prefix+N+possessive suffix]]. Nouns occupy the possessed position in possessive constructions.
- Nouns can serve as modifying complements of other nouns; the modifier -tsï (M) marks a relative clause.
- Nouns can be predicates when coupled with the copular suffix or a demonstrative.
- De-verbal nominalizations may preserve some verbal syntactic function, particularly with regard to the preservation of the verbal A arguments in the clause, either overtly or in the choice of the nominalization suffix, and preservation of the middle voice prefix. Copular verb nominalizations appear to preserve some of an auxiliary function.
- NP can occur in several types of cleft constructions.
4.2.2. Verbs
- Finite main clause verbs are obligatorily inflected with indicative or irrealis suffixes, person marking prefixes, and plural concordance. Verbs may be inflected with the negative prefix and several types of enclitics. Verb phrases may also host the switch-function -fa primary topical participant suffix; evidential suffixes; and epistemic, affective, and interclausal reference marking clitics.
- Kalapalo verbs exhibit split-intransitive and split-ergative syntax. Intransitive constructions include the ‗plain‘ and the extended types. Transitive constructions include the following types of alignment in main clauses: nominative-accusative (hortative and imperatives), and ergative-absolutive.
- Verbs are subject to several valence-increasing and valence-decreasing processes and take corresponding derivational morphology.
- Verbs are subject to a large number of nominalization processes, with arguments often preserved in the resultant constructions.
- Verbs are subject to adverbialization processes, which often preserve the verbal arguments in the clause.
- Verbs may take dative/benefactive and instrumental case marking in certain ‗goal‘ and ‗purposive‘ constructions; this makes them noun-like even when in finite construction.

91
- Verbs serve as heads of transitive and intransitive VP clausal predicates. Verbs may appear in both main and complement clauses. Main clause verbs may be finite or non-finite (thetic). Some inflections are restricted to subordinate (‗true‘ complement) clauses.
- Kalapalo verbs exhibit split-intransitive and split-ergative syntax. Intransitive constructions include the ‗plain‘ and the extended types. Transitive constructions include the following types of alignment in main clauses: nominative-accusative (hortative and imperatives), and ergativeabsolutive.
Syntactically, predication is connected to constituent order: Intransitive verbs are preceded by S (SV). Transitive verb phrases are preceded by O, closely tied to the following verb phrase, and followed by a postposed A NP. The nominal-accusative constituent order is AOV).
- Verbs can serve as heads of subordinate clauses and receive arguments in absolutive, accusative, dative/benefactive, instrumental, comitative, allative, ablative, and locative cases.
- There are two non-finite verb constructions: 1) the subordinate supine (purpose of motion) and 2) the thetic (which is either an independent or main clause construction). The thetic hosts neither person prefix arguments, nor indicative or irrealis suffixes. Arguments of thetic verbs may occur as lexical NP.
- Verb phrases can take adverbial adjuncts, including in a variety of complementation strategies and subordination relations with other verbs.
- Verbs are involved in chaining functions (with grammaticalized relational grounding, referenced by taxis (phasal) and interclausal reference marking clitics, some of which substitute anaphorically or cataphorically, for immediately preceding or following clauses or even whole clause chains). Verbal clauses may also appear in coordination constructions in clause chaining.
4.2.3 Adverbs
- Kalapalo adverbs function as attributives of verbs as well as noun phrases. NPs that accept adverbial modifiers are demonstratives and deverbal aspectual nominalizations. - There are several sets of underived adverbs, as well as productive derivations of adverbs from the larger noun and verb classes. . Deverbalized adverbs preserve verbal arguments.
- Adverbs normally occur in first position in the clause. Where there is a clause chain adverbs have scope over the entire chain.

92
- The adverbial subtypes include negations, locatives, and manner attributives often used to code major segmental divisions (clause chain boundaries) in extended narratives.
- Adverbs – both underived and and derived, are subject to nominalized and verbalized derivational processes. These constructions may be readverbialized as well.
- There are two ‗denial‘ adverbials that occur circumfixed around main clause verbs and noun phrases. [Since there are only two, I would list them here.]
4.3 The small closed word classes
The closed word classes are readily distinguished from the main word classes (nouns, verbs, adverbs) by their very restricted syntactic functions and their very limited (or absent) inflectional and derivational possibilities. In contrast to the hundreds of words in the larger classes, the smaller classes have less than 40 members, and some have fewer than10. One class, the coordinator, has only one member. These small closed classes are listed according to the approximate size differences, beginning with the largest. Clitics, described in detail in the preceding chapter, are included in the list and table for comparative purposes. More detail on the other small word classes is seen in the specific chapters as noted.
4.3.1. Clitics and particles.
As I described in Chapter 3, Kalapalo has several large sets of clitics: affective; epistemic, taxis (phasal), and interclausal reference markers. Some members of the clitic word class may also function phonosyntactically as particles. Clitics and particles do not host inflectional or derivational morphemes except for copula suffixes and the primary topical participant marker.
4.3.2 Ideophones
This is a semi-closed word class that is mid-range (under 100?) in size and somewhat productive, as examples in the ideophone section show with regard to creative combinations of morphemes and speech regarding unusual or new items and their activities. Ideophones are important syntactically insofar as they function as what might be called ‗pseudointransitive‘ and ‗pseudo-transitive‘ clauses, in that they may act as predicates on their own. Ideophones may also complement verbs, and the particular sound configurations make them readily understood with regard to types of action that are referenced—including extended, abrupt, and repeated. Ideophones appear frequently in narrative discourse. Kalapalo ideophones are described in Chapter 12.
4.3.3 Interrogatives

93
Interrogatives consist of three types of roots which may stand alone but more usually are further inflected by a variety of suffixes to form grammatical words. These inflections include nominalizations, plural markers, the facsimile suffix and the negative mirative suffix. These roots also host epistemic, affective, taxis and interclausal reference marker (IRM) clitics. Interrogatives are described in Chapter 10.
4.3.4 Demonstratives
There are five types of demonstratives: pronominal, adnominal, identificational, local adjectival, and manner. Demonstratives host a limited range of taxis clitics and the mbe SS (same argument, same event) or dye (same argument, new event) interclausal reference markers. The identificational set also functions to mark a noun phrase as S or A of a following verbal construction, either lexical or copular. Pronominal demonstratives and the anaphoric pronominals may also function as independent personal pronouns. They are described in Chapter 6.
4.3.5 Adjectives
This class has approximately 30 members. Adjectives may modify NP by juxtaposition. There is very limited class inclusion copula suffixing on adjectives. Kalapalo adjectives are described in Chapter 12.
4.3.6 Expressives
The class of expressives includes the sub-classes of interjections and epistemic expressives. Interjections are two syllable adjective-like morphemes that express personal feeling, and usually occupy first position in an utterance. They may also stand alone in discourse. They do not host inflectional or derivational morphemes. Epistemic expressives are much like interjections in that they are one or two syllable and most occur at the beginning of an utterance; some may be suffixed to interrogatives or even occur at the end of an utterance. Because of this variation in word order and semantic differences, I treat interjections and epistemic expressives as sub-classes of the larger word class. Kalapalo expressives are described in Chapter 12.
4.3.7. Discourse lexemes
Members of this small closed class have discourse functions. The set includes six free-standing lexemes that do not form a phonological word with preceding units. They may host a limited number of taxis clitics. Kalapalo discourse lexemes are described in Chapter 12.
4.3.8 Deontics

94
Deontics are used to complement nominal arguments. They mark their heads with prefixes referencing the head as S or A on the one hand, or O on the other. Deontics are thus distinct from the verbal arguments in not having an person prefix; the head marking prefix may be omitted if there is a lexical NP head. Deontics are fused forms of the existential ‗be‘ verb with the verbal root followed either by an imperative suffix or an identificational demonstrative. No further categorizations or derivational processes occur on deontics. Kalapalo deontics are described in Chapter 12.
4.3.9 Coordinator
There is a single coordinator, õ, ‗and‘, used to form lists of proper names. Its use is described in Chapter 12.
4.4. The Syntactic Nature of the Major Kalapalo Word Classes
4.4.1. Word classes and stem formation
The major Kalapalo word classes (verbs, nouns and adverbs) are in the main syntactic rather than lexical in nature. At the core of the three major word types are roots. In general, Kalapalo roots are subject to two general kinds of derivational processes, as occur in other Carib languages (Camargo 2006; Carlin 2004; Ferreira dos Santos 2002; Franchetto 2006; Gildea ms.; Meira, 1999). What I call ―first level‖ derivations involve a large number of these ―precategorial‖ roots that must receive an immediately following monosyllabic morpheme or what I call the radical. Some roots are restricted to one or another class, but many are ―pre-categorial‖ insofar as they can appear in grammatical words of all three classes. Many roots are monosyllabic, but some are actually bi- or tri-syllabic underived nouns (e.g., akua, ―consciousness‖; see example below). There are three ‗be‘ verb roots that may function as copular verbs, and one root that appears to be adverbial (see chapter 8).
Radicals specify the word class to which the resultant stem belongs. This stem constitutes the head of the phrase. The root+radical construction achieves transitive, intransitive, adverbial, or nominal function. Some roots are ‗naked‘ (Franchetto 2006) or ‗bare‘ (Carlin 2004) in that they show more than one possibility for serving as roots for transitive and intransitive stems and functioning in nominal constructions. Once they have hosted a pronominal prefix and one or more suffixed morphemes, root+radical (=‗stem‘) compounds achieve grammatical word status.
4.4.2 First-level stem-formation processes: roots and radicals
With many intransitive verbs, there are zero-realized radicals. These occur with the roots for: hear (ifa-), touch (ifi-), attack (e-), slap (api-), and utter (ki-). In addition, some roots are homophonic, as they may serve as radicals with other roots. The following are some commonly used roots showing the types of grammatical words formed from

4.4.3 Ambitransitive Roots

Certain roots may take intransitive or transitive verbal radicals; the resultant stems with their subsequent prefix and suffix constructions head either intransitive or transitive verb clauses. Examples of such roots include ige- ‗handle, carry‘; ke- ‗cut‘; ŋi- ‗give‘; fipï-, ‗sell‘, ta-‗help‘.

As an example, I show a speech act root that is one such ambitransitive.

4.4.3.1. ki-utter

a. Quotative, followed by a quotation; intransitive:

ama ki-ta mother utter-CI ‗Mother is speaking‘

b. Quotation followed by imperative; transitive:

c.

4.4.3.2. fa-, ‗hear‘

The root fa-, ‗hear‘ discussed in section 3.2 (above) is another example of an ambitransitive‘ root.

4.4.4 Word class changing derivations and valence changing processes: Second level derivational processes

99
There are two general types of ―second level‖ derivational processes. The first are word class changing phenomena. Through these derivational processes, nouns become verbs and vice versa; adverbs can be derived from both verbs and nouns and vice versa; nouns may be re-nominalized; ideophones can become verbs or nouns; demonstratives can be nominalised. The second type of second level derivational process is valence-changing constructions. Valence increasing constructions involve the use of radicals to change syntactic functions of verbs from intransitive to transitive, and from 2-argument transitives to 3-argument transitives. Valence decreasing constructions involve the anti-passive, and the object-backgrounding construction. In addition verb clauses may be subject to inverse marking, the third valence decreasing process. Derivational processes are described in detail in the word class chapters that follow this overview chapter.
4.5 Person marking prefixes
Kalapalo has two paradigms of person-status marking pronominal prefixes. The first or ‗basic‘ set of prefixes occurs 1) on possessed nouns marking person status of possessor; 2) as ‗argument referents‘, marking S of intransitive and copular verbs, to mark O of transitive verbs; and to reference person status of a restricted set of case markers. This set of prefixes also appears on de-verbal nominalizations and adverbializations derived from possessed nouns. The second paradigm of person prefixes mark A>P relations governed by an inverse marking hierarchy. (These are discussed in Chapter 7.6). In addition, there is a multi-functional ―reflexive‖ prefix, tї- that is both anaphorical co-referencing and used in thetic construction and some adverbializations (see Chapter 7). There is also plurality agreement on the verb when second person plural members of Set 1 or 2 are used, or in the case of a third person NP. All pronominal prefixes appear in first position (unless there is a prohibitive prefix) and are unstressed, causing the following syllable (generally the first unit of a pre-categorial root) to be stressed. Person marking prefixes are distinct from a separate word class of pronominal demonstratives that may also operate as independent pronouns (described in Chapter 6).
4.5.1. Basic person marking prefixes
Person prefixes are bound phonologically with stems of verbs, nouns, and the ergative and dative/benefactive and comitative case markers. However, not all person categories are found marked in each of the three word categories. Verbs have the most elaborate system, nouns less so, and case markers the fewest distinctions. Table 12 illustrates the distinctions in person marking prefixes and co-referencing plurality markers. The reader is advised to refer to this table during the discussion on person marking in the examples that follow.

4.5.2. First person prefixes on intransitive verb and possessed noun phrases.
Person marking prefixes on the intransitive verb mark S. On possessed nouns, these prefixes occur to mark the person status of the possessor. The nominal stem is usually followed by either –gï or –pe, salient (member of a group) suffix. ( There are some examples with both suffixes ―one of her X‘s‖) which usually (but not in every instance) are suffixed with the possessive suffix –gu/gï. Most kinship nouns, which are considered inherently possessed, bear the possessor prefix but not the possessive suffix:
u-fïgi, ‗my arrow‘ e-tapïgï, ‗your foot‘ ku-mugu, ‗our (1+2) son‘ tis-efugu, ‗our (1+3) canoe(s)‘ te-tagiñugu, ‗her own speech‘ tï-Gipoŋagï, ‗his own knee‘ a-ta, ‗your mother‘

4.5.6. Person marking prefixes on kinship terms
Most of these are inherently possessed nouns without the usual –gї possessive suffix. Normally the possessive suffix cannot be deleted, though I have one example where this occurs, ukwoto: our (dual) parent (cited below).
u-fisï, ―my younger brother‖ (note; in informal speech, a man may call out ‗ufi‘ to his younger brother;

106
e-limo, ‗your son‘ i-si, ‗the mother‘ (the 2nd person form is suppletive a-ta, ―your mother‖ with second person singular /a/; ukwoto, ‗our (dual) parent‘ ku-pahene, ‗our (1+2) female cousin‘ tis-aũpuau, ‗our (1+3) grandfathers‘ tï-iñoi, ‗the one who served as her own husband‘.
There are some kin terms that do host a possessive suffix, but the stress pattern is the same as with other kin terms): i-fi-gï, ‗his grandson‘. See Chapter 5.2.3 for a complete list of kinship terminology.

4.5.7 Person marking prefixes on case morphemes
Person marking prefixes also appear with the ergative (-feke/pehe), dative/benefactive (-iña) and in a reduced way, the comitative (-ake) case markers. There is a reduced set of person categories, including only 1, 2 and 3 person singular markers. Pronominal prefixes appearing on the three case markers are listed above; other case suffixes do not take person or plurality marking.

4.5.8 Plural concordance suffixes
As shown in Table 13, there are two plural concordance suffixes. –ko is an absolutive that occurs on the verb or the NP head of the adverbial adjunct, as well as the intransitive S noun phrase. It is used to reference plurality of subject or patient arguments. –ni is used to reference the transitive subject (A) argument and occurs on the ergative case morpheme.

4.5.9 Third person co-referent reflexive prefix t(,ї)-
The Kalapalo reflexive prefix t(e,ї) - has several functions crossing word class categories. The first is to anaphorically co-reference the possessor of a noun on which it is prefixed and the verbal S or A argument, as:
tї-fiñafo-no REF-Obro-PL ‗His own brothers‘.
Second, the reflexive prefix is used without specifically reflexive meaning in non-finite thetic constructions, as:
t-e-ti REF-come.to-TH ‗the coming‘
Third, the reflexive prefix occurs with some adverbializations:
t-ugupo-tsi, REF-fill.up-ADV ‗filled up‘
4.6. Order of constituents in the verbal and nominal word
4.6.1 Overview
While Kalapalo is a language with few prefixes and many suffixes, the verb phrase normally is preceded by several clausal constituents other than the arguments: these include interjections, epistemic expressives, adverbs, and negative prefixes. Arguments tend to be closely adjacent to the verb phrase itself. Oblique NPs generally follow the head NP or the verb clause. According to features of transitivity, focalization, valencechanging processes, and illocutionary force grammar, there are several possibilities for word order in Kalapalo.
a. The verb phrase
i. Within a transitive VP, the head is normally located between the Pronoun NP or pronominal prefix and the postposed transitive subject NP (A) : [O-V-A].

109

However, A may be placed before O as a means of foregrounding (calling attention to and/or emphasizing) the A identity.

ii. Within an intransitive VP, S NP always comes before V: [SV] order.

iii. Equative and existential copular constructions generally operate like the intransitive predications they are [S-V]

b. Within the NP, the simplest noun phrase is a lexical noun or free pronoun; there are also noun phrases, with an initial noun being the possessor, the second the possessed; another simple type of noun phrase involves an adjective complementizer: [ADJ + N+POSS].

c.

Adverbial phrases: Adverbs typically occur to the left of verb

phrases (two are circumfixes). Many occur in first position

unless preceded by an interjection or epistemic expressive.

4.6.2. Focus of clausal argument

There are several types of focus structure in Kalapalo. Here I am concerned only with focalization that has influence on clausal constituent order. When focalization has only scope over one clause, it involves a temporary fronting of a NP in order to place attention on a new participant in narrative action. Both transitive subject (A) and oblique arguments may be focalized by a fronting such that one of these NP appears before both the verb and O clausal constituents which form an impermeable unit. Even with such fronting, adverbials and epistemic expressives maintain their position at the beginning of the clause. In any clause, only one focalized noun phrase is possible. A full review of Kalapalo focalization and topicalization (a process linking clauses) will be given in Chapter 14, after all structures have been described in the various chapters.

In a., the demonstrative is present because the speaker is answering a question about why he seems to be going off somewhere dangerous):

4.7 Morphological marking of grammatical relations

Kalapalo is characterized by head, dependent, and adjunct marking. Using J. Nichols terminology, Kalapalo may be described as a splitmarking language (1986: 75), although there is a tendency towards headmarking at all levels. In this regard, Kalapalo approximates the typological feature exhibited by the Northern Carib languages Trio (Tiriyo) and Carib (Kalina).
At the phrase level, there is dependent marking. The possessed noun phrase is marked by possessed suffix and possessor pronominal prefix (or possessor noun phrase) as well as co-referencing plural number and derivational suffixes.
At the clause level, there is head, dependent, as well as adjunct marking. The head is marked by coordinate plural suffixing. The majority of noun phrase arguments of the verb are marked with a case marker; absolutive (S/O) person prefixes appear on the verb unless there is an overtly expressed S or O noun phrase.
At the complex clause level (minimally, there are two clauses involved), there is also dependent marking. The relative NP is marked with a relative clause modifier suffix. Deontics lexically index person status of the S, A or O noun phrase. Adjunct noun phrases are marked with oblique case markers.
At the clause-chain level (minimally, there are three clauses involved), there is also both head and dependent marking. Medial clauses are marked with the shift-reference marker. Controlling clauses are marked with aspect/mood suffix and the taxis clitic. Many if not all of the features that appear on controlling clauses at the clause-chain level also occur on the anaphoric focus referent (ule-) clause which generally appears at major narrative discourse boundaries.
Table 14 shows the marked constituents at each level and the indexed grammatical categories and relational constructions.

4.8 Discussion: The emergent nature of Kalapalo word classes
Kalapalo data verify the findings of several Cariban linguists, who have described the realization of tokens of word classes in syntax and grammar (Franchetto and Ferreira dos Santos 2006 about Kuikuro; Elaine Camargo 2006: 160 and Catriona Hyslop 2006: 92, for northern Cariban languages). As the preceding table of Kalapalo word class grammatical features shows, many derivational and inflectional features (as well as ―pre-categorial‖ roots) cross word class boundaries. Stems are phonological words that must be inflected to form grammatical words; these inflectional features, together with first and second level derivational features, have syntactic functions that help define the main word classes as ‗not lexical‘. In other words, stems + inflectional and derivational morphemes → syntactic function of the word. The syntactic of word order and the morphological marking of grammatical relations all contribute to this understanding and justify the notion of the classes as syntactically emergent. Finally, but not secondarily, phonological processes such as stress patterns, vocalic elision, vocalic assimilation,

112
ablaut, and the inclusion of clitics within the phonological word must also be noted in any understanding of a particular word class (see Chapter 3: Clitics and Particles for full discussion).

Chapter 5
Nouns and Nominalizations
5.1. Syntactic functions and distributional features of Kalapalo nouns
Kalapalo nouns form a substantial and open class with a large variety of syntactic functions. Not only do Kalapalo nouns function as arguments of verbs, they may form predicates of many kinds, preserving properties of the heads of noun phrases in demonstrative, copular, de-verbal aspectual subordinate, and relative clauses. These constructions are a functionally important feature of Kalapalo nouns. In the first place, Kalapalo has relatively few adjectives. Second, de-verbal nominalization is an important subordinate construction. At the same time, nouns are obligatorily expressed as finite verbal arguments, either as pronominal absolutive prefixes or as lexical noun phrases, and as pronominal prefixes on case morphemes where there is no lexical NP.
Nouns have their own dependent marking which includes grammatical categories of possession, plurality, negation, dislocation, and case, a set of augmentative and diminutive suffixes, as well as the class inclusion copula, unique, salient and negative suffixes, and the relative clause modifier and the shift-function primary topical participant marker. Kalapalo uses many lexical ‗renominalizing‘, de-verbal and deadverbial derivational suffixes pertaining to S, O or A. Nouns may also be verbalized and adverbialized. There are nine aspectual derivational morphemes (morphologically and semantically different from verbal aspect suffixes). Grammatical categories shared with the class of verbs include absolutive prefixes, and absolutive head marking plurality concordance suffixes; plurality concordance suffixes in ergative case will also appear on the ergative, comitative and dative/benefactive case suffixes. Because of the pervasive word class changing derivations in Kalapalo, many roots and stems (root + radical) are also shared between verbs and nouns, and to a lesser extent with adverbs. The locative function is shared with adverbials. While there are some classes of underived nouns, nouns are frequently derived from verbs and adverbs as well as other nouns. Some nouns are renominalized from verbs constructed from nouns, and nouns share marking of aspect with verbs, though the morphology and semantics differ and nominal aspect is specifically connected with subordination. When specifically referring to derived forms, I use the terms nominalization, but otherwise use ―noun‖ or ―nominal‖ in a functionally and syntactically neutral way for any member of this word class.
5.1.1 Word order and nouns as core arguments of verbal clauses
Nouns can be intransitive subjects (S), transitive subjects (S), and transitive objects (O), as well as indirect objects (dative/benefactive or instrumental) of ditransitive verbs. Nouns may also be arguments of a

114
subordinate clause in an extended intransitive construction and oblique arguments in transitive and valence-decreasing object-backgrounding clauses.
The basic clausal constituent orders are SV and OVA. S in the intransitive construction may be either an absolutive pronominal prefix or a lexical noun. A in the finite transitive indicative and interrogative inflections is usually a post-posed ergatively marked A which can be either a pronominal prefix or a lexical noun. Once mentioned explicitly, the ergative marked A is marked with a pronominal prefix on the ergative suffix, the construction appearing in the postposed final position in the clause (d). Nouns modifying other nouns are simply juxtaposed. Full noun phrase arguments (of whatever case, and whether core or oblique) precede the verb phrase if topicalized, as in (a); examples are the ergative NP in (b) and the benefactive/dative marked noun phrase in (d). Full noun phrase A is usually topicalized in this way when first mentioned, then put in the post posed position in subsequent mentions.

Verbal arguments are marked with case suffixes (Ø for absolutive) as follows:
[N+case suffix+ plural concordance suffix].

a. Intransitive S: (Ø third person abolutive marking)

‗Was there a reason why you were always so stingy with your daughter?

e. NP as oblique argument of an extended intransitive verb ñi‗see‘, marked as such with the DAT/BEN case suffix.

f.

A deverbalized NP in which the noun is derived with the locative

nominalizer suffix -ɳu (LT). This NP is not oblique but a main

argument of the VP. The verbal construction -ti-ga

references the event of passing from one state to another.

tï-n=ege e-fiGa-ŋu RQ-OP=IDEM e-heat-LT

a-pi-sa-ti-ga 2-hit-Vi-DES-CI

‗Should there be a reason why you get sweaty‘ (why droplets are hitting you?).‘

g. NP as human recipient of a ditransitive verb, tu-‗give‘. R is marked by the dative/benefactive case suffix. In this example the verb has been nominalized in passing state perfective nominalization (bracketed).

‗The payment given to their mother, the shell belts, parrot feather

headdresses, all the toucan feather ornaments.‘

h. NP as non-human recipient of a ditransitive verb ‗eat flesh‘. R is marked with –ki instrumental case suffix.

i.

NP as theme of a ditransitive verb, ge-, ‗take away‘. T (here,

kwigiku) is Ø marked (T=P).

ukwoto-iña, ukwoto-iña. dual-parent-for, dual-parent-for ‗For our parent, for our parent.‘

j.

In this example, the adverbial suffix –kai, ‗on‘ appears to mark

‗this food‘ as an extended argument in a ditransitive speech act

context.

kagutu oto-feke s-aki-tsu-nda=lefa tu-iñaɳo-kai. trumpet sponsor-ERG 3-speak-Vi-CI=MT REF-food-on ‗The trumpet sponsor told him his food was (placed) out.‘

5.1.2. Nouns as heads of possessed noun phrases

The dependent NP in a possessive predication is marked with the possessed suffix (a). A possessor marking person prefix marks the dependent if there is no lexical possessor NP, as in (b).

a. Possessor nominal precedes the possessed nominal with possessed suffix:

ama-ñu

tolo-gu ege

mother-END pet-POSS PDEM

‗This one is dear mother‘s pet‘

b. Possessor prefix u, ‗me‘ and possessed suffix –gu, on N – tolo, ‗pet‘.

u-tolo-gu 1-pet-POSS-COM ‗my pet‘

5.1.3 Noun modification
The modifying NP (either preceding or following the head noun) is dependent marked with the modifier (M) –tsï (tї). This argument may be incorporated into a main verb clause by a pronominal prefix, or may be an explicit NP argument (a). The head of the NP that is being modified may be explicit, referenced through switch-reference interclausal reference markers, or through a demonstrative. The suffixed morpheme –tsï thus has a discourse metacommentary function insofar as the speaker is providing additional information regarding a preceding NP to the listener and marking it as such. A few examples are given here, with more examples presented in 5.3.16, Positions of Constituents in the

117

Nominal Word; 5.5 Relative Clauses; and Chapter 14, Grammar in Narrative Discourse. M appears in boldface in the examples.

a. The head noun is marked with the modifier (M):

uŋa-ta ti-lo-po,

masope-tsï-fa,

house-inside REFL-nearby-ADV, secluded.girl-M-PTP

i-ñ-uŋu-fa

3-PB-house-PTP

‗Inside the house someone close by, a maiden, the secluded one.

b. An example of a ‗new information‘ NP appearing initially in the non-verbal clause. Here it is the modifying noun that is marked with M, while the possessive head NP (Aulukuma fitsu) is unmarked. As the latter references the primary topical participant (PTP) (‗wives of Aulukuma‘), the shift-function primary topical participant suffix –fa VanValin, Jr. and La Polla 1997: 287) follows the modifier:

kuña itau-gu-tsï-fa

Aulukuma fitsu, kuña itau-gu.

añi women-POSS-M-PTP Aulukuma wife, añi woman-

POSS

‗I mean the Añi Women, Aulukuma‘s wives, the Añi Women‘.

c. In this example, M is suffixed to the oblique argument of a relative clause that modifies the head noun tũwa-kuegї, ‗Water Monster‘:

tũwa-kuegї=fale

ege ititu-i,

water-AUG=NT

PDEM name-CL,

‗Water Monster this time, that‘s its name,

eh, kafї-tsї-kaiɳa et-uwo-lї yes, sky-M-DEST MV-flood-PI yes, that (being) who floods up to the sky.‘

d. M is suffixed to the interclausal reference marker dye referencing same argument :

lepene

s-їɳїl≈u:m fufufu,

afterwards 3-sleep-(ideophone for extended action),

(sound of blowing spell),

apuɳu-lu=lefa

negation-EM die-RES

s-їɳї-lu=dye-tsї-fa, taloki s-їɳї-Ø 3-sleep-PI=SA-M-PTP just 3-sleep-RES

118
‗Afterwards she fell asleep with the spell on her and died, not died for good but (I mean) she fell asleep, she only slept.‘

5.1.4 Nouns as predicates with demonstratives

When paired with a demonstrative, nouns function as predicates. A demonstrative may relativize a noun phrase, usually with the class inclusion copula suffix –i (as in 5.1.2.c, 5.1.3 b). . The following examples illustrate the different kinds of interactions between types of demonstratives (described in Chapter 6) and nouns.

a.

Example of –i, class inclusion copula (CL) construction:

ukw-iñatї-gї-i

katote

1+2-hand-POSS-CL all

‗All our hands are this kind‘.

b. Example of –a, unique or special (U) construction:

ige-a=lefa

a-ŋakafu-gu-a at-ïfïgï

this.way-U=MT

2-hair-POSS-U EQA-IMP

‗Just like your special kind of hair, it‘s become soft‘.

tamaki, soft

c.

Example of –pe, salient (part of a whole) (SAL) construction:

Kalapalo itau-gu-pe

ele,

Kalapalo woman-POSS-SAL PDEM (distal)

‗she, one of the Kalapalo women‘

e.

Pronominal proximate demonstrative (PDEM) ege, ‗3rd person,‘

with renominalization referencing an experiencer of a state:

ege etu-ta-gï-iñe PDEM settlement-DIS-POSS-EXN ‗this person, (a member of ) a settlement somewhere else‘

f.

3rd person adnominal demonstrative (ADEM) fegei, with a de-

verbal nominal:

ku-mu-ŋe-tu fegei 1+2-son-Vi-N ADEM ‗This is one of our youths.‘

119

g. ‗Situational‘ identificational demonstrative (IDEM) igei in an interrogativeconstruction; in this case IDEM is suffixed by the class inclusion copula suffix–i:

tu-iti-gi-ma

igei-i?

RQ-hammock-ADV-EM this-CL?

‗This is someone‘s hammock here, right?‘

h.

De-verbal perfective nominalization with class inclusion copular

prefix suffix (boldface) and de-verbalized exstential copular verb

in ‗transformed state‘ inflection (boldface):

is-añatui-ɳo-gu-ko-i u-pїgї-i Tapoge≈ñїgї 3-five-NLOC-POSS-PL last-VPE-CL Tapoge≈EX-TR ‗Tapoge had become the last of the five of them.‘

i.

Adverbial predication ‗his hearing badly‘ (i.e., faulty

understanding). The demonstrative references the NP following

the verb as S. (Note this example shows an ergative following

the intransitive verb ‗go.away‘. this construction will be

discussed in Chapter 7: Verbs):

i-faŋa=fesu=fale

fegei te-lï-feke

3-ear =badly =DT ADEM go.away-PI-ERG

Matїga i-mï-te-Ø.

Matїga 3-face-3-go.away-RES.

‗But not understanding himi well, (and) set against Matїga, hej

left.‘

5.1.5 Nouns predicated by copula constructions

Copula constructions incude both copula suffixes and inflected ‗be‘ roots serving in copular function.

a. This example shows a lexical noun paired with a class inclusion copula suffix(boldfaced):

ukw-iñatї-gї-i

katote

1+2-hand-POSS-CL all

‗All our hands are this kind‘.

b.The following example shows a de-verbalized nominalization (boldfaced) paired with an active equative copula root construction:
[ñatui ake-tsa-ɳe tis-їɳї-pїgї Ø-ata-ni] te-lu-iɳo five DEO-EX-I 1+3-sleep-VPE 3-EQA-ANT go.away-PI-
POT ‘We must finish sleeping five days before going away‘. (lit., ‗five days of our sleeping must occur, then plan to go away)

120

5.1.6 Nouns and adjectival predications
a.Here is an example of a possessed numerical nominal. It bears the ‗third person‘ possessor prefix is-. Following the stem is the possessed suffix –gu and the class inclusion copula suffix –i (CL). The grammatical word hosts the metonymic phasal taxis =lefa.
is-atakegeni-ŋo-gu-i=lefa 3-four-NLOC-POSS-CL=MT ‗3rd person‘s fourth born.‘

b. Here there is a simple juxtaposition of the adjective and the noun. The adjective precedes the noun.

ego

fïgi

nice.behave arrow

‗nice behaving arrow‘

5.1.7 Relativization

Kalapalo relative clauses include demonstratives, verbs, adverbs, pronominal nouns and de-verbal nominalizations modifying a noun. The relative clause is marked with the modifier –tsї (-tї when suffixed to ATR). The common argument often is marked only on the main clause, and in some cases, does not appear in either main or relative clause if in third person.

In this example, M occurs on a NP that modifies the head NP which is S of the main clause. The common argument is explicit in the proper name used in the relative clause and the third person form of the verb ‗come.to‘ in the main clause.

fotugu-i ekugu egene Mbambaɳisu tїgїiɳi-tsї-fa first-CL fully this.side Mbambaɳisu REF-narrow-SN–M-PTP

ah s-i-nїgї=lefa EXP 3-come.to-PS=MT ‗Very first one who came this way was Mbambaɳisu, (on) the Rio 7 do Setembro, that is,‘

Here M appears on the NP modifier of the head noun that is P argument of a quotative complement.

b.

tї-tomi tũwa ifa-ta

e-feke-ni

RQ-PURP water tell.about-CI 2-ERG-PL

‗Why did you all tell about the water?‘

tu-fits-au-feke, kuña-feke-tsї-fa, kuña itau-gu. REF-wife-PL-ERG, añi-ERG-M-PTP, añi woman-POSS

121

‗To his wives, to the Añi that is, the Añi women.‘

c. In this example, there are two clauses marked with M. The first is a ‗denial‘ adverbial construction that is adjunct to the first main clause, while the second is a NP that modifies the head noun in the main clause. Both nouns reference the same P arguments.

afïtï la-tsï-ki

e-ŋits-au-ko iña-mba-ñalï

denial manner-M-MIRN 2-GM-PL-PL consume-Va-MAL

‗No, I‘m never going to devour your grandmothers that way!‘

e-ŋits-au-ko-tsï fe-tsa-ŋe ke-ku-dye-to 2-gm-Pl-PL-M OD-DEO PREV-INT-DE-COL ‗Your grandmothers should be left alone‘.

d. In this example, there is both an O and oblique argument, both of which are in clauses marked with M. The first is the oblique argument of the main clause, while the second is the O argument. The relative clause and the main clause common arguments are made explicit, first by an object- backgrounding prefix, and second by a lexical NP (both are in boldface). Note the speaker uses both tї and tsї forms of M (repeated from 5.4.2.2.3d).

ama-ñu –iña=mukwe-tï-fa

ñ-ïŋ-itsi-ga-ni

mother-END-DAT/BEN= EM-M-PTP OB-bit-pierce-Vt-PL

uguiŋï-mbïgï-pe= mukwe-tsï-fa. intestine-FS-SAL=EM-M-PTP ‗For poor dear Mother some of these skewers of their former intestines, though she may not care for them.‖

e. In this example, the main clause includes an ideophonic construction, which, because it is a bird call, references the bird itself. This type of ideophone may be considered a pseudonominal. This nominal morpheme is followed by a pair of adverbial adjuncts, the last of which hosts M.

õ ah õ

ifa-ki-la=fale

i-fudya-tsї-fa.

(call of the blue heron) far-ADV-NEG=NO tree-among-M-PTP

‗‖õ ah õ‘‘, this time not far away, (from) among the trees‘

f.

Here M is suffixed to the imperative complement of an

intransitive verb:

tsa-ke-tsї-fa e-fisu naka-ɳu-nda listen-I-M-PTP 2-Ybro bathe-Vi-CI

122

‗Listen to (him), your younger brother is bathing.‘

g. Here M is suffixed to the locative adverbial adjunct of the head noun of the main clause:

s-i-nï-ŋgo-lefa,

se-gati-tsï-fa

3-arrive-Vi-PI/PL-MT same.place-ALOC-M-PTP

i-ñaŋo-pe-ko-na

3-liquid.food-SAL-PL-ALL

‗They came, to that same place that is, to their food. ‘

Relativization also often occurs with adverbial predications, where the demonstrative substitutes for the head of a noun phrase; the latter may appear more explicitly at the end of the clause, as in the following example:

a.

Example of a negative (-la) construction:

iñalï-tï

Giti≈ ts≈i-la

kukuge

NEG-EV

sun≈EX-CL-NEG PDEM

‗It‘s said we (people) lived without sun.‘

5.1.8. Semantic types of nominal predications
The semantic types of nominal predications include: naming, possession, attribution, class inclusion, identification, location, negation (nonexistence), and aspect. Aspectual sub-categorical contrasts include inanimate/animate; positive/negative event or circumstance; and stative/active. Copular verb constructions in nominalized aspect are also used in active and stative verb derivational constructions. Active ditransitive verbs may be nominalized in various ways. These constructions are noun-like insofar as they may be linked to demonstrative adjuncts and function as heads of relative clauses, but on the other hand they preserve their verbal arguments, like other derived nominals. Deverbal nominalizations preserve verbal arguments and also may be used in clause chaining as reference clauses (see example 3b, Chapter 14: Grammatical Processes in Narrative Discourse). Table 15 lists the different types of predications and shows examples of different types of constructions associated with each. (Included in the table here are just a few examples of the many predications). More detail will be presented throughout the chapter, particularly in the section on derivational suffixes.

5. 2.Noun Types
Kalapalo nouns include both underived lexemes and nominalizations derived from other types of words. Nouns can be derived from verbs and adverbs, and can be de-nominalized to form verbs and adverbs. Some nouns are also re-nominalizations of other nouns. Nouns of both underived and derived types fall into two general typological groups according to their ability to be possessed or not. This is an important semantic feature as the same entity may be referred to by more than one noun according to whether or not the speaker wishes to declare the entity in a potentially intimate relationship with a human being (more on this in Basso 1975: 17-26).
5.2.1 Non-possessed nouns
Types of non-possessed nouns include: 1. personal names; 2. proper nouns; 3. ideophonic proper names, 4. spatially deictic third person nouns and 5. cardinal numbers. In addition, free pronominal demonstratives (described in Chapter 6) may be considered a subcategory of non-possessed nouns.
5.2.1.1 Personal names

126
Every Kalapalo has two sets of inherited names, one set given by each parent. A set contains at least one ‗child‘ name and one ‗adult‘ name, although usually several names of each type are contained in a single set. The names are given when an infant and mother exit from postpartum seclusion. Each parent gives to the child the names belonging to its own parent, according to the appropriate sex. Because of affinal name avoidance, a parent only uses the names that s(he) has bestowed on the child. Children‘s names are not generally distinguished according to gender and are often (but not always) names for natural species, places, and material objects. Adult names were traditionally used after puberty seclusion, when the name bestower (now technically in a grandparental generation) would also take a new name. Adult names are gender related; they sometimes are the names of mythological protagonists and may also be names associated with outsiders. Since the names of recently dead relatives are not used by close kin, a person needing to bestow a name may find what would be normally available to them ‗used up‘. For this reason, several women asked me for names to give to their own children. Alto Xingu people now use many names of European origin: Heinz, Lucia, Elena, Joel exist at the same generational level as Asuti (frog); Lumbe (mouse); Madyuta, Ugaki and Eusa (‗adult‘ names without lexical meanings). (See Basso 1973: 85-7 for more details on traditional naming).
5.2.1.2. Proper nouns
These may be derived using degree nominals and readily serve as roots for re-nominalization and for verbalization derivations. Subtypes may be distinguished semantically. There is some overlap between these words and personal names given to humans. However, there are a large set of personal names that are not also names for things and other living entities.
To illustrate the various means of creating words that function as proper nouns, I use several sets of terms relevant to particular semantic domains. These are: names for fish, names for frogs and toads, kinship and other relationship terms, and terms for body parts. Names for natural species are usually listed by consultants in order of their size. The remarkable knowledge of their environment exhibited by older men is illustrated by the ready listing of names of this type. Serious environmental degradation due to forest clearing and dam construction makes this knowledge highly endangered.
Example: Names for kaŋa, ‘fish‘
The following list includes the first 48 terms of a comprehensive list of 124 fish names elicited from a single elderly man in 1979. My consultant listed fish in order of size and (secondarily) frequency of contact. These initial 48 fish names in his list fall into several morphophonological types.

127

A. The largest set includes uninflected words. In the sample, with one exception, all are 2-3 syllables. There is a preference for final syllable –i, (final a, e, o, and u are rare). I do not have satisfactory idenitifications for all of these.

1. wagiti (matrincha)

2. kífagi (pacu)

3.

3. kwátagi – curimatá – Prochilahus – medium size, sucker

mouth

4. kïtïti

5. safundu - (tucurare) - chichla multifasciata

6.

6. tañe – (trairão) – Hoplias lacerdae

7. dyofí = tigúfi – (two names)

8. tugúfi – (pintado)

9. afí – (cachorro) – one of var. general to caracidae moë

acestronhampus

10. atígi

11. їgúfa

12. dyegú – (red piranha) – itseke, ‗powerful being‘

13. kuógo - giant catfish

14. kufatї– symphysodon – acarámorerê

15. atúi atitï – adyiti

16. adyámu, ugáke‟ – electric eel. Electrophorus electricus

17. túpaga

18. tagúfaŋa - with faint yellow line

19. afúaŋu

20. dyagápo‟ - aŋágu

21. augáúga‘

22. féte‟ fresh water oyster

23. fïtá fresh water crab

24. dyokó‘

25. fesoko

26. kéu or okópi- muçum. Symbrandues marmoratus –

25. ‗kafágasï – armored catfish – corcudo – loricaria

26. mbásïtï – Apteronotus albifrous

27. tifágï - stingray. Paratrygon motoro-

B. A second set involves names (many from set A) inflected with the augmentative suffix –kuegï. This morpheme often implies that the creature is a powerful being (itseke).
28. kwatagi- kuegï – large, long 29. dyïnápa- kuegï - Portuguese, jaraqui (Prochilodus insignis) 30. kagi- kuegï - Portuguese, jaú – paulicea lütkeni itseke 31. feŋi-kuegï - itseke – a large piranha 32. dyegu-kuegï - itseke – red piranha 33. djofi-kuegï – itseke

128
34. wagiti-kuegï – itseke – a large matrincha 35. afi-kuegï – itseke –a large cachorro 36. tagafa-kuegï – itseke 37. safundu-kuegï, also called tisa-kuegï
C. On the other hand, only three names were given that carried the diminuative suffix –kusïgï, and each inflected a name from Set A:
38. wagiti- kusïgï 39. ketútí -kusïgï 40. atїfu -kusïgï
D. Four terms involved reduplication:
42. tagutagu 43. kïgúkïgu 44. kagikági 45. físe‟físe‟
E. A small number involved associative, possessive and attributive nominal predications:
46. associative predication: fágu igiŋgogu – (igiŋgo of the riverine lake)
47. attributive predication: tafegiñe ,‗the beautiful one‘ (because of its red markings)
48. attributive predication: tatitsúñe: the sweet tasting one 49. possesive predication: iféu fogísu – peccary‘s fogí
5.2.1.3 Ideophonic proper names
Many proper names for natural species (esp. category names for birds and frogs) are ideophonic, such as: tsĩtsaha bem-tê-vi (tyrant flycatcher); fokueu‘ nightjar (frogmouth); bïgabïga a kind of frog. As an example of ideophonic naming, I include an elicited list of names for katagu,„ locusts and cicadas‘. As these insects are often distinguished by their call rather than their physical features (though these are, as shown below, sometimes part of the description), I have included this list as an example of the practice of ideophonic naming (though not all the names are ideophonic, the consultants‘ descriptions (givewn with the names) often include descriptions of the animals‘ ‗calls‘ (itsu).
Example 2: Names for katagu,„ locusts and cicadas‘
tïkotïko - the very large cicada (green head and brown body) sakaga - Akwakaŋa‘s sister; nzueŋi-fekugu atutu=fale

129
nzueŋi intse apïŋegï - ―it‘s smell of rotten piqui‖; blue wings, ―pretty‖
fïmbiku tupisuGiñe - ‗the red one‘ zuizui - very small zuitsitsi - large kue - very small ekege - small, lives in grass in oti, ‗grasslands‘: dark blue on
body Giti ataŋagï - ‗Sun‘s flute‘ fundiŋu - is said to sing to the kuake‟ (leaf cutter ants) just
before they swarm etsiGitsue , whose name is said to mean ―take off your (bark) leg
wrappings‖

5.2.1.4 Spatially deictic third person nouns

Several third person nouns have spatial deixis semantics. These are formally a class of pronouns. They are used to make third person distal/medial/proximate contrasts (the proximate may be used in direct address). As the examples attest, these words were particularly useful at a time when it was important to try and figure out who people were, whether possible enemies or ‗people like us‘. Like the independent pronominal demonstratives (see Chapter 5: Demonstratives), spatially deictic third person pronouns are unpossessed and both include the proximate/distal deictic distinction; however pronominal demonstratives do not have a ‗medial‘ category. Spatially deictic pronouns mark third person status but do not distinguish between singular and plural, whereas pronominal demonstratives mark first, second and third person singular and plural status. Finally, there is also an unmarked anaphoric pronominal demonstrative uɳele compared below (4c). The following table shows the four morphemes in the set of third person spatially deictic pronouns.

1. ago is a neutral noun, with the simple meaning ‗the person, people‘. It may be inflected with a person prefix, as in example (a) with the first person plural exclusive prefix tis-. Ago is often used in an anaphoric predication, as in (b), with a ‗consideration‘ (iɳi-ge) complement clause and the following

130

main clause. The primary topical participant marker –fa (PTP) references the head of the nominal predication as the same as S of the main verb kundata, ‗chopping wood‘:

a.

kefege-i, katote-tsï-fa tis-ago ŋi-pi

2. unago: third person, spatio-temporally distal. When clause initial /u/ is usually dropped.

a.

This example shows a simple example of the use of the distal

third person singular form unago. The immediately following

construction is a nominalized verb, now fully lexicalized,

meaning ‗offspring‘. It is the head of the NP, the nominative A

of the re-verbalized nominalization, whose root is ife-, ‗abduct‘.

‗I‘m thinking these people here have turned out to be the same as us‘.

b. As in the following, I have examples of this word being used as a politeness strategy in direct address to a person in an affinal situation:

Amago, amago. this.person, this.person

4. kago references a person, or people within hearing distance, but not visible:

a.

koko=gele≈kugu iɳila koko=gele, tok tok tok

night=PT≈fully early night=PT, (sound of axe)

kago-tsї-fa,

‗Still in the middle of the night, very early before dawn, still at

community (chopping wood).‘

b. uɳu-fuɳu-ma=laka akago-i Q-resemble-EM=EM those.people-CL ‗Do you have any idea what kind of people they could be?‘

To compare with the anaphoric demonstrative pronoun uɳele (ANA), the next example shows the use of this morpheme in a stretch of discourse. The anaphoric pronoun references first, the NP Taugi-fa ikene iŋiso-i, ‗the one who is the younger sister‘s husband‘, and then another related pair of NPs: ifasï-ŋiso-iŋo , ‘the person who was going to be the older sister‘s husband‘, and the name of this person, Akiŋi. These are also given in boldface. The speaker‘s husband is asked to use the man‘s name; his responses are in brackets.

5.2.1.5 Cardinal numbers
Kalapalo cardinal numbers one through twenty are non-possessed nouns. Numbers six through are non-possessed nominalizations, using the ‗place‘ suffix –tofo (PN) and when elicited, (but rarely in naturally occuring speech) the class inclusion copula suffix is often included as in the list of nominal cardinal numbers below.
Using a quinary system of numerals, Kalapalo traditionally counted with their fingers. The gesture of toucing the relevant left hand finger with the index finger of the right hand was used to indicate the cardinal or ordinal number. The first five cardinal numbers are uninflected lexical words, while the numbers six through 10 are inflected.. Ordinal numbers are possessed nominalizations described in 5.2.2.5.
Numbers one through five are: agetsi, ‗one‘ takiko, ‗two‘ tilako, ‗three‘ tatakegeni, ‗four‘

133
ñatui, ‗five‘. This may be formed from the noun iñatїgї, ‗hand‘ with the final possessive suffix replaced by the class inclusion copula suffix -i)
Numbers six through ten include:
agetsi ŋuGwe-tofo-i, one add.to?-PN-CL ‗The position added to one.‘ takiko ŋuGwe-tofoi,‟ seven‘ (‗the position added to two‘) tilako ŋuGwetofoi, ‗eight‘ (‗the position added to three‘) tatakegeni ŋuGwetofoi, ‗nine‘ (‗the position added to four‘) ñatui ŋuGwetofoi , ‗ten‘(‗ the position added to five‘)
Finally, the last number katote, ‗all‘ (i.e., twenty digits) is another uninflected noun. While there are no indigenous numbers for 11 through 19, when talking about ‗all‘, the speaker will bend over and, spreading the hands, superimpose the fingers over the toes, saying, katote fїgape, ‗all of the digits‘
5.2.2 Possessable nouns
These include: 1. cardinal numbers; 2. nominal time words; 3. geographical settings; 4. words for body parts (with a subcategory of body parts possessed only by non-living things; 5. taste and smell lexemes; 6.ordinal numbers.

5.2.2.2. Nominal time words

In addition to the nominal words discussed in this section, Kalapalo time words include certain kinds of verbs and adverbs. These three sets are distinguished grammatically. Nominal time words referencing seasonality are usually possessed (though they do not have to be) and may host the metonymic taxis clitic =lefa. While seasonal words may often be unpossessed when terminology is elicited, more often they are used by speakers with possessive nominalization, and completive aspect or potential irrealis verbal suffixes, suggesting that experiencing of a time of day is often more important than simple naming of the event itself. Adverbial time words complement either copular roots in verbal inflection or intransitive verbs; these are discussed in the section on adverbial time words in Chapter 12. Words for times of year, referencing the behavior of astral phenomena, and some words for the times of day, are verbs. These are listed in Chapter 7: 7.1-2 The possessed time words include:

a.

isoa: the dry season, isoatu, ‗dry‘; sisoanїgї: ‗3ps dry season‘;

sisoanїɳgo‟ 3pp dry season‘

b. tuwakunatu, ‗raining‘; tuwakunatuko: their rainy season

c.

ɳune: moon; aifa, tilako ɳunegї : after three (of 3p) months

134

Time words that are not possessed include ten words for time of day that function as nouns. They usually complement a copular verb or intransitive verb construction. Many are seen with the adverbial adjunct ekugu, ‗fully‘, ‗completely‘. As in (d), this adjunct may be shortened to ku.

a.

5.2.2.2 Words for geographic settings.
Another set of nouns that can be possessed are terms for geographic settings. The most common ones include:
faŋguiŋa: river netune: sand bank tuwa: watery environment ipa: lake itsu: creek itsuni: forest fagu: ox-bow lake tefu: rock face (cliff) kuiganda: place with manioc growing tuwaka: place where water is held (i.e, bathing place)

5.2.2.3 Words for body parts.

136
These are inherently possessed terms. There is a set for human beings (kuge) and another that includes body parts possessed by non-human animate beings (ago).
1.Human body parts.
Names for human body parts were always given to me with the speaker referencing his or her own body, or where there are gender differences, pointing to the body of another person as reference. Some of these, e.g., for head, hand, leg, foot, can be used with non-human beings where appropriate, and there is a separate set for body parts distinctive to nonhuman beings. The following list includes different person prefixes on the possessed nominal as they were given me by several Kalapalo men and women as we sat outside a house in Aifa talking about this subject. .

5.2.2.4 Ordinal numbers
Kalapalo ordinals are used not only to reference abstract ―first, second, third, etc.‖ but also birth order. These are inflected forms (except first and second which are clearly adverbials, ―the first, the following‖). Other are possessives formed from the root of a cardinal number prefixed by the ise(a)- 3rd person prefix (see 12.2.1.a). The root is followed by the locative (or deictic) affix, then the possessive suffix, then an optional final copula. As these are nominalizations, they will act like regular nouns with a copula and metonymic taxis clitic. I have included in this list words used to reference the fingers on a person‘s hand or to specify a ‗last-born‘ sibling, which are different from the abstract cardinals listed in section 5.2.1.5.

5.2.3 Kinship nouns
Kinship nouns are a closed subset of nouns that always refer to human relationships, even though the entities in question may have names of non-human beings. This subset of nouns has distinctive properties. The use of kinship nouns is governed by a civility register (Basso 2007), one of the main distinctive features of interpersonal relationships in the Alto Xingu. Kinship terms fall into two general pragmatically defined categories: those used vocatively and those used referentially. With close relatives and very small children, vocative terms are often used referentially as well. Full semantic details of Kalapalo kinship classification and terminology are found in Basso 1970, 1973.
Kinship nouns have special grammatical features. They form plurals in several distinctive ways not seen with other nouns or verbs. Kinship nouns exhibit a number of examples of suppletion, particularly the words in second person which also tend to show ablaut (see Chapter 2). Also, there are clear differences between vocative words and those used in reference. Vocative kinship terms cannot be possessed, whereas referential terms may indicate possession. Finally, only kinship nouns use endearment suffixes.
5.2.3.1 Endearment suffixes
There is a set of endearment suffixes (END) used only with kinship terms referencing particularly close relationships; these specific terms may be used either as vocatives or in reference by the relative speaking. Other than body part terms, and one kinship term, these are the only morphemes that mark gender differences.
1. -ñu is used for speaking to or about one‘s mother and speaking to or about a very young child. The ‗youngest child‘ word has an inherent

139

endearment suffix; there is no form *u. The terms using this endearment suffix are: u-ñu: my dear youngest child; a-ñu, ‗our dear youngest child‘; ama-ñu, ‗dear mother of mine‘.

2. -dyu/ dyï is generally used with male relationship terms, but there is an exception for the term ‗ĩ-dyu‟ ‗dear little daughter‘. Words using this suffix include: awa-dyu: dear uncle of mine; apa-dyu: my dear father; i-dyu: ‗my dear little daughter‘.

a.

ta-tsï egei awa-dyu-ko-iñalï

CONT-M DEM uncle-END-PL-EX-MAL

‗Those are not really my dear uncles.‘

3. -dyo: This endearment suffix is found only on the vocative for grandmother, oko-dyo. It appears as an example of u→o ablaut, or it may be a case of assimilation.

Table 17 shows the referential Kalapalo kinship terms used for various classes of kinsmen and the special terminology for relatives by marriage (affines). The glosses given for these terms are approximate as the identification of various relatives is based upon a classificatory rather than strictly genealogical system. The suppletive forms used as vocatives are listed in Table 18.
Four special terms are used to mark affinal relationships. They are normally used to reference a third party‘s relative, as it is somewhat embarrassing to use them in reference to one‘s own relations. These are generationally distinguished; some terms are used for cross-generational relatives. The words are usually not used in direct reference to an individual person unless to specify the relationship to an outsider. With direct reference, teknonyms such as ‗mother (father) of our child‘ are used; these are not included in the table.
Kalapalo preference is to use kinship terms instead of personal names, in keeping with the civility register but also due to a strong preference not to use a personal name openly. There is a strong name avoidance rule for more (but not all) of these relatives; a name may be openly used to assert there is no relationship between the speaker and referent, as with situations involving witchcraft accusations. Names of the dead are also avoided unless they have been passed on to people of the grandchild generation.

5.2.3.2 Suppletive kinship words

Many vocative kinship words are suppletive. Most are first person but there is a second person suppletive term for ‗mother‘ as well. The following table shows the suppletive kinship nouns. Vocative terms are also used for first person reference. They are shown in Table 18 with their associated endearment suffixes. Referential terms are given in third person.

5.2.4. Material possessions
These are inherently possessed, but marking of possession is often pragmatically related to a need for emphasizing the possessor. There is

142
no plurality. The following is a short list of manufactured items. As the possession inflections illustrate, there is some variation is how this can be constructed. Pets are also always possessed. Some ritual objects are inherently non-possessible; these are marked with an asterisk.
atau, ‗women‘s carrying basket‘, ataugu, ‗your carrying basket‘ fiŋi, ‗body scraper‘, efiŋigï, ‗your scraper‘ kuluta, ‗flute‘, kulutagï, ‗his flute‘ *kagutu: large trumpet hidden from women tige, ‗hammock‘ (inherently possessed) utologu, ‗my pet‘ (this noun is also used for an adopted child) tafakugu, ‗hardwood bow‘ fїgey, ‗arrow‘ efu, ‗canoe‘

5.2.5 Taste and smell lexemes

Kalapalo identify seven indigenous categories referencing smell and taste. These are a mixed group, the first five being possessed nominals, other adverbials, yet another often nominalized but without a clearly transparent stem. They may be further (or, re-) nominalized with the experiencer –iñe nominalizer (EXN).

a. tatitsu, ‗sweet‘

b. pïɳegї, ‗pungent‘ (in a dangerous, poisonous way)

c.

sikegї, ‗pleasant‘, ‗fragrant‘

d. uegï, ‗fishy‘, including breast milk, seminal substance

e.

fitseɳegї, ‗sour‘

f.

isini, ‗painful‘, ‗spicy‘. The root isi- is usually nominalized ( as

here, with the –ni active agent nominalization (AN).

g.

tatsiɳi, ‗bitter‘. The root of this morpheme is inflected with the

negative nominalizer suffix (NN)

In addition the Portuguese word salgado, ‗salty‘ was used frequently, especially in later years.

5.3 Morphological Properties of Nouns
5.3.1 Position of the morphological structures in the nominal word
According to the nature of their specific syntactic functions, Kalapalo noun phrases may have any number of constituent elements. Therefore, some nominal elements are mutually exclusive, others may co-occur. Yet others are strictly required according to the syntactic role of the nominal, while others are optional and may be considered related to semantic rather than syntactic function. The following diagram summarizes the noun structure of the Kalapalo noun, illustrating the position and general order of types of nominal elements in the nominal word. Those in the two large brackets (numbers 3-6; 7-11) do not normally co-occur. The

143
term ―and‖ means co-occurrence is allowed. The term ―or‖ means the constituent may not co-occur with the immediately following constituent. For example, a possessed noun must include a pronominal prefix + root+ radical, either an endearment suffix or a possessive, not both. Number is allowed and a case or copula inflection will be required according to the syntactic function of the possessed NP. Discussion follows the diagram.

Diagram 1. Order of constituents in nominal words

144

The following are examples of nominal grammatical words (bracketed) showing the positions numbered above. Glossing is shown in the third line, translation in the final line.
a. The grammatical word is a renominalization of a nominalized verb. These structural positions and their related morphological functions are discussed in the remainder of the chapter.
Afiñuka, [i-pondo-te-pïgï-pe] (name) [2-4-5-8-14-15] Afiñuka, [3-covering-Vt-VPE-ESS] bird gather-at-RES ‗Afiñuka, his (face) was concealed where all the birds came together.‘

b. An example showing two relative nominals. The second is a deverablized clause that has been nominalized with an aspectual suffix. The middle voiced verb is a noun incorporating construction, thus there are two elements in position 4, the incorporated noun root iñoti-, ‗cord‘ and the semantic root ke, ‗cut‘.

[is-ataɳa-gї-pe]

[et-iñoti-ke-nїgї]

3-4-10-15

MV-4-4-8

3-long.flute-POSS-ESS

MV-cord-cut-PS

‗Once his long.flutes cords have snapped.‘

5.3.2. The contrastive prefix ta- (CONT)
a. The stative verb is nominalized, thus being made into an attributive:

ta-tu-Gi-ñe

oĩz-a-tïfïgï

CONT-firm-cause-N tie.down-EQA-IMP

‗not (someone) whose body was firmly tied down‘

b. In this example CONT appears before the modifier, thereby referencing a NP in an immediately preceding conversational turn.

afïtï. ta-tsï

egei-a awa-dyu-ko iñalï

denial. CONT-M IDEM-U uncle-END-PL negation.

‗You‘re wrong. Those aren‘t my uncles‘

5.3.3 Absolutive person marking
The absolutive person marking prefix references the possessor status of possessed nominals together with the possessive suffix. Where there is no full lexical NP possessor, this prefix is required with the possessive suffix on the possessed NP. Possession is both a syntactic function in Kalapalo and an inherent semantic quality of

145
some nouns as described in 5.2.2. Possession has both complementation and inflection functions.

5.3.4 The reflexive prefix

The reflexive pronominal prefix is (required with de-adverbialized nominalizations; it is optional as anaphoric reference. The person marking prefix and the reflexive do not co-occur.
As noted in Chapter 4, the Kalapalo reflexive prefix t(ї) has several functions. The first is to anaphorically co-reference the noun on which it is prefixed (a). Second, the reflexive is used in nonfinite thetic constructions (b). Third, it occurs with some adverbializations (c).

a.

tї-mu-gu

REF-son-POSS

„his own son‘

b. te-tufu-ti kaah uege. REF-know-TH FRUST you ‗It‘s been known about you.‘

c.

Adverbialization of a noun:

tї-mї-fisu-Gi

.

REF-face-red-ADV

5.3.5 Stem constituents
As described in Chapter 4, stems consist of a root (position 4), a semantic feature that may be a noun itself as in (f), and a radical (position 5). The radical is a syntactic feature often associated with different verbal valences. Some also have semantic features, being used with certain semantic types of verbs or nouns. For convenience, an example is repeated from Chapter 4, 4.3.4.6.b. Stem elements are in boldface.
a. i-fo-tsi-lï i-feke 3-pierce-Vt-PI 3-ERG ‗He pierced it.‘

5.3.6 Valence increasing suffixes
These include various kinds of causatives and a permissive. They are suffixed to the stem and include several causatives as discussed in Chapter 7: Verbs. Only one may occur at a time. An example of a causative (-ga) suffixed to a verb stem is given below:

146

a. Akwakaŋa nduku-gu

u-ke-ŋi-ŋï

Akwakaŋa gourd.container-POSS 1 >3-fill-Vt-I

te-ga-ni go.away-CAUS- ANT ‗I intend to be the person who will fill Akwakaŋa‘s container.‘

5.3.7 Non-aspectual nominalizer suffixes
As discussed in the section on derivational processes, there are seventeen non-aspectual nominalizer suffixes some referencing the type of verbal argument (experiencer, active agent) and others having semantic references (for example benefactive, devalued, locative). These are listed in Table 21. An example of a noun with the augmentative suffix –kuegї follows.

a.

itau-kuegї ipa-gu felei.

woman-AUG lake-POSS ADEM

‗That‘s the Monstrous Women‘s lake‘.

5.3.8 Aspectual nominalizer suffixes

Twelve nominalizer morphemes have aspectual meanings. Some of

these appear as derivational suffixes in deverbal nominalizations, others

as renominalizations of simple underived or possessed nouns. Two are

negative morphemes. Kalapalo nominal aspect morphemes may be

sorted into different kinds of perfectives and imperfectives referencing

the nature of an eventuality or end of a situation, but differ

morphologically and semantically from verbal aspect/mood suffixes.

Some combinations of 7 and 8 are attested as shown in the examples in

Table 23 below and the discussion in 5.6.3. An example

of

theimperfective de-verbal nominalizer (IMP) follows:

a. lepene ndi-ga-tїfїgї afterwards drop-downward-IMP ‗Following that it was dropping down‘ (lit.,‘it was a drop down-er‘)

5.3.9 Endearment suffixes
As discussed in 5.2.3.1, endearment suffixes are used only with kin terms and are not optional with some kinship words. There is only one inflectional possibility as the suffix cannot co-occur with a possessive suffix. An example is: awa-dyu, ‗my dear uncle‘

5.3.10 Possessive suffixes

147

There are several allomorphs of the Kalapalo possessive suffix, which always appears on the possessed noun. Possession is a dependent marking feature of Kalapalo. Possessable nouns take the possessor personal prefix and the possessive suffix –gï or its allomorphs when possessed. From a semantic perspective, the term ―possession‖ actually subsumes a number of separate features. These follow from an initial contrast between ‗not possessable‘and ‗possessable.‘ Possessable nouns can be classed semantically according to inherent versus optional possession, and alienable versus inalienable possession. Semantic features that follow from ‗not possessable‘ include several partitives: temporal, reciprocal, paucal;, countable, augmentative, and diminutive. The general contrast between possessable and non-possessable nouns is a contextually or pragmatically varying feature for some sub-classes of nouns as it influences grammatical function, and there are a number of inflectional processes involved. The features in question and associated sub-classes of nouns are shown in Table 18.

Possessive suffixes include:
a. Associative, alienable: -gï/-gu
tsa-faku-gu, ‗their bows‘ i-ta-gu, ‗its leaf‘ (inherently possessed noun); i-tolo-gu, ‗pet, lover, younger person raised (adopted)‘ afe-gï, ‗the wing‘ kafoko-gu, ‗toucan feather headdress‘

148
ŋinïgï, „his gift‘ (thing given; from a detransitivized verb)
b. Inalienable: tï/sï (u) /tsï/tsu:
i-fitsï, „his wife‘ kafoko embufitsu, ‗toucan‘s pubic hair‘ ifisï, „tree‘s fruit‘ ititï ‗(her/his /its) name‘ tï-tafi-su REFL-processing.mat-POSS ‗her own processing mat‘

5.3.11. The facsimile suffix, -me

This morpheme expresses the idea that the noun in question is not full, or in essence a member of a particular class (‗ kind of‘, ‗sort of like‘) (FACS). It is very similar in meaning to what Carlin (2004: 123) calls the Trio language ―facsimile‖; I adopt her term here. The facsimile suffix occurs on nouns as well as in adverbials (j,m).

j. uwa-m ≈ e-itsa. eta-Gi-ñu-mbe≈gei. Q-EM ≈2-EX, speech-Vi-N-SS ≈IDEM. afïtï. iñalu-me tsa-l≈i-feke-ne. denial.negation-FACS hear-PI ≈3-ERG-PL

CONT-FACS-EM flute inside REFL-put-REV 3-ERG

‗How could he possibly put (them) back inside the flute?‘

5.3.12. –pe: „salient‟ suffix (SAL)

149

The salient copula suffix -pe is a multifunctional element, with both semantic and syntactic functions. It can reference a portion of a partitive noun (e.g., one of a group of wives, a fruit segment). But it (or its homophone) also functions as the essive ‗stative‘ nominalizer (see Position 15). often followed by a plurality marker. Finally, -pe marks the argument of a extended intransitive subordinate clause.

The salient copula suffix appears often on proper nouns, marking the salient part or segment of head NP :

a.

Kalapalo itaugu-pe, ‗a Kalapalo woman‘;

agu-pe, ‗one of its seeds‘;

alu-pe, ‗one of its segments‘ (of a fruit for example);

etu-pe, ‗one of the settlements‘;

kaŋikigo-pe, ‗some of the group of fishermen‘;

ifitsu-pe, ‗one of his wives‘;

masope: woman in seclusion after first menstruation (cf. imatso:

menstruating; from root ma- ―change of state‖)

The salient suffix also occurs on pronominal demonstratives as, ege-pe: one of these (proximate). The following is an imperative example, where the pronominal demonstrative hosts the ‗partitive‘ copula suffix –pe. (Same example 6.1.1.2.f)

b.

ege-pe ake-tsa-ŋe tuŋ-Gwe.

PDEM-SAL DEO-EX-I give-I

‗I want you to give one of these‘.

c.

The salient suffix inflected on the anaphoric pronominal

demonstrative:

uŋele-pe, ‗one of those‘ (anaphoric)

5.3.13. The suffix –fe

The meaning of this suffix is uncertain, and there are very few examples of its usage.

a.

ama nïg≈i-feke. ande-ŋu

a-fatuwï-feke

‗Mother‘, she said to her. ‗Here‘s a tiny bit of manioc your

nephew has been sending.‘

150

5.3.14. Plurality suffix

There are various types of plurals; including a number of suppletive plurals. All plural suffixes have human reference. Generally, plurality of both nominal and verbal arguments is expressed on the stem as a suffix, of which there are seven different morphological types, some allomorphs. The verbal ‗prospective imperfective aspect‘ also has a special plurality suffix: singular: -iŋgo; plural: -iŋgoiŋo. However, there are special markers of plural number on nouns, as described below.

1. -au plural suffix on human category and kin terms (PL) (itau, ifandau,fuandau, anetau, etc.). Some kinship terms in the plural have special changes from singular:

ifau →ifandau ifitsu → ifitsau

2. -fo, (PL). There are a few words with this plural suffix, referencing a small group of people related to the kinsperson whose kin word is suffixed in this way: ukwoto-fo, ‗our (dual) older relative‘; -fono seems to be used when the head noun is plural, as efiña-fo-no.

3. –ko generalized absolutive plural (PL). This suffix is used with verbs and is a simple plural with possessed nouns.

o. t-iŋ-iŋ-i-ko REF-look-Vi-IRR-PL They looked behind (themselves).

p. afїtї-ku-dya aketsaɳe kukuge-ko-la denial-INT-XA DEO-EX-I we (1+2)-PL-NEG ‗No, we really don‘t want to do that.‘

4. –mo, scattered collectivity (COLL) . This suffix references plural persons who are spread out, not clustered together:

oto-mo: ―owners‖ of a settlement, members of a leader‘s clique followers of a settlement leader) ukw-o-tofo-ko-mo: dual-parent-USIN-PL-COLL “those who serve as our elders” (different kind of kin nominalization than those ending in –ine) (with possessive and plural S ko); affinal civility register: husband to wife

uikenamo: my younger sisters (those like me) uiŋadyamo: ―My grandchildren‖ (term of address to people standing around, not all clustered together)

5.3.15 The class inclusion copula (-i), unique (-a), and negative (-la) suffixes

These must always appear in grammatical word final position. Only one of these suffixes occurs at a time (with one exception as in 5.3.14.3 when they all occur together).

5.3.15.1 –i class inclusion copula

The class inclusion copula suffix –i (CL) has both copular and irrealis functions. Here I present a few examples, with more discussion of copularity in general in Chapter 9.

a.

In this example, the copula suffix appears on a complement that

is a proper noun, which hosts two interclausal reference marking

clitics. The complement subject is a third person S (zero marked

on the verb, ‗go away‘).

kaɳa-i=mbele=mbale ete-lї fish-CL=CU=CAT go.away-PI ‗Finally in the end he went away as a fish.‘

5.3.15.2 -a, the „unique‟ or „special‟ suffix

5.3.14.2 -a unique predication (U

This marks distinction of the predicate on adverbs, nouns, and complement words. This morpheme has an emphatic semantic quality, as in English ―just‖ or ―only‖) ( U).

a. Here, The uniqueness of the result of a series of events is indexed by the –a suffix appearing on the resultative lexical

complement of a larger construction. The adverbial is nominalized and serves as adjunct to the main verb clause

b. Appearing on a locative adverb, referencing the (unique) quality of the sun‘s movement across the sky, with a sweeping arm gesture illustrating that trajectory.

inde-a Giti at-ani here-U sun EQA-ANT „The sun was moving right over here.‟

5.3.15.3 -la , „negation‟ (NEG) suffix

This suffix marks the noun as negated. It is possible for it to follow the –a ―unique‖ suffix. –la often appears as a negative suffix on adjectives and verbs and is also the final element in the ―denial‖ adverbial circumfix afïtï V+la and the negative adverbialization suffix kila. There are also several different negative predication suffixes that occur on nouns and some adverbials: -fiŋï (‗unlike‘); -mbïŋï („former, no longer‘).

a.

The negative suffix on the adjective ‗good‘:

atutu-la-ki

i-tsa igei

good.thing-NEG-MIR EX-CI IDEM

‗Unexpectedly bad, this situation. ‗

b. The negative suffix on the stative equative ‗be‘ root a-inflected as a nominalization::

afïtï Ø-a-nïgï –la denial 3-EQS-PS-NEG ‗That wasn‘t what it was.‘

5.3.15.4 The pe-i-la construction.
The three suffixes may occur as pe-i-la to mark an essive irrealis on the verb (Same example 6.1.3.1g)

5.3.16 Case suffixes
If a case marker is used, none of the features indicated after the position of the case marker (other than plurals) is allowed. Kalapalo has nine case morphemes. There are six syntactic (external structure) cases and seven semantic or internal structure cases. External structure cases include: 1) ergative (-feke; -pehe), 2) absolutive (Ø), 3) the syncretic dative/benefactive (-iña), and 4) instrumental (-ki). All of these combine strictly syntactic as well as semantic roles. Internal structure cases are used to mark oblique objects and are in the main locational or directional deictic categories. These include: 6) comitative, ‗together with‘ (-ake), 7) allative (direction towards), (-na), 8) ablative (direction out, following after, or away from) (-peŋine), and 9) destination (kaiŋa). Constraints on use of these morphemes concern an agency hierarchy: powerful beings/human>non-human living things > inanimates, but also the semantic character of the verbs. Many items that appear to be inanimate are actually animate beings, powerful beings who have transformed themselves. (See example 5.3.15.1.d ). In addition, there is a suffix –pe which marks the thematic (non-subject) argument of an extended intransitive verb. (5.3.15.8)

5.3.16.1 Ergative, -feke, -pehe

The ergative case morpheme –feke (-pehe for 1+2 person) may be suffixed to a noun phrase, or bear a person-marking prefix and (apparently optional) plural suffix –ne with plural A. The following are the person-marked forms:

ufeke:1ps efeke: 2ps ifeke: 3ps

ku-pehene: 1+2, inclusive ti-fekene: 1+3, exclusive efekene: 2pp ifekene: 3pp

The ergative case suffix usually marks A of an active verb. Here the plurality of the NP is marked in the noun not the ergative suffix.

a.

e-fameti-dyau-feke

kine -Ø

i-ki-dyu.

2-Z.in.law-POSS/PL-ERG manioc.bread make.breadVt-PI

‗Your sisters in law are making bread.‘

This morpheme can also mark a stimulus in the case of involuntary or emotional action and change of state verbs (For more discussion, see Chapter 7: Verbs).

b.

ifutisu-ki-tsa-kugu i-feke

shame-INST-EX-fully 3-ERG

155

‗She had made him thoroughly ashamed.‘

c.

oĩ-feke u-e-ta

thirst-ERG 1-kill-CI

‗I‘m very thirsty‘. (‗thirst is killing me‘)

The ergative can act with certain intransitive verbs in a valenceincreasing manner, to mark a second argument.

d. In the following example with the intransitive verb atsaku, ‗run away‘ the postposed ergative NP references the appearance of the runners in another guise than their usual selves. The verb hosts the reflexive prefix t- to reference the focalized actors in the preceding clause chains:

lepene aifa.

lepene t-atsaku-lu

afterwards ready.done. afterwards REF-run-PI

kanagit-au-feke ñatui

burity.mats-PL-ERG five

‗Following that, they were ready. Then they ran on as burity

mats. Five of them.‘

Note: my translator assistant explicity referred to these mats as

‗people‘. They were powerful beings who had transformed themselves

to escape fire.

e.

In this concessive example, the intransitive ‗utter‘ verb ki-

becomes transitivized by the first person plural ergative

construction kupehe (which initially appears with the verb ŋi-,

„see‟in concessive construction).

upe-feke fegei. upe-ERG ADEM ‗That‘s about upe. ‗

5.3.16.2 Absolutive Ø
The lexical patient arguments of ergative constructions do not carry an explicit case morpheme, as is true for the S argument of intransitive verbs.
a. Intransitive, S marked Ø (boldface):

156

fikutafa Ø-te-ta turtle 3-go.away-CI ‗The turtle goes away.‘

b. Transitive ergative, P NP marked Ø (boldface):

isũwї te-ɳe-lї i-feke 3;father eat.flesh-Vt-PI 3-ERG ‗He ate his father‘.

c. Transitive ergative, P as prefix on the verb stem (boldface). This occurs because there is no lexical noun or pronoun.

kohotsi u-ondi-ɳalї

i-feke

afternoon 1-leave.behind-REP 3-ERG

‗He always leaves me behind in the afternoon‘.

5.3.16.3. Dative/benefactive -iña.

This is the only example of Kalapalo case syncretism. When suffixed to a NP, the latter must reference a human or powerful being. The verbs concern activity that is directed towards a (human) goal or on behalf of a person. Where there is no NP, this case marker bears personal prefixes and when marking plural oblique objects (third arguments of transitive verbs) is pluralized with the case suffix –ni. (On the ergative and comitative suffixes this is an A plurality reference). When the case suffix marks a subordinate plural O ‗goal‘ verb clause, the absolutive plural suffix –ko occurs.

Table 20. Person and plurality marking on dative/benefactive case morpheme

uiña: eiña iña iñani kukiña, 1+2 (inclusive) tis-iña, 1+3 (exclusive) -ko -ni

a. This example shows the use of the dative/benefactive case marker on a NP used with the extended intransitive body action verb tsa- ―run (after)‖. The verb radical –ki has ambitransitive function.

itsa-ki-lu-iŋo-la.

157

b. This example shows the speaker‘s use of the dative/benefactive on a NP (in brackets) with a speech act verb in imperative mood. The dative marker is suffixed to the last constituent in the NP, the deontic postposition.

‘Our parent has to be told about it, (to) our parent.‘

c. Where the dative/benefactive oblique NP is plural, the accusative plural –ni is used. Both the following examples have a benefactive sense:

i. tї-kaɳa-gї-ko

ifa-nїgї i-feke-ni

d. The dative/benefactive case also occurs on a subordinate verb phrase, as a ‗goal‘ purposive marker (see also Chapter 13: Complex Clause Constructions) (Same example as 3.3.2.2.showing the use of two epistemic clitics in succession)

The following is a rare example of the subordinate verb inflected

as a possessed nominal (bracketed), before hosting the

dative/benefactive suffix.

―I don‘t recall I was angry at all when your son came to shake

me (literally, ‗for my shaking‘).

g. The following example shows the use of the dative/benefactive suffixed to a subordinate ‗goal‘ verb in punctate indicative mood/aspect; main verb is in potential mood:

u-t-imi-lu-iña

u-enïm-iŋo

1-REFL-revenge-PI-DAT/BEN 1-come-POT

‗I plan to come and avenge myself.

h. This example shows the dative/benefactive case marker on another subordinate verb in a ‗goal‘ purposive construction.

1+2-go away-Vt spell-INST REFL-put on-PI-DAT/BEN

‗We go away to put the spell on it.‘

i.

Where the dative/benefactive appears on the subordinate clause

and P is plural, the absolutive plural –ko is used on both the verb

and the dative/benefactive.

e-iŋi-lu-ko-iña-ko u-e-ta

‗I come this way in order to see you all‘, 3p said to 3p. ‗

j.

The following is a complex clause construction with

thedative/benefactive suffix appearing on both the ‗reason‘

complement clause and then on the oblique NP. Note that the

nominal hosting the suffix is a plural noun; thus the case suffix

does not take a plural suffix –ko though it is present on the noun.

159

k. Here the dative/benefactive marks the theme argument of a verb complementing ifatiGi, ‗take‘ in a non-finite supine ‗purpose of motion‘ construction:

ande-lefa Pañeta ete-ta=lefa

i-ŋi-lu-iña

i-fa-tiGi.

3-take-SUP

‗This time Pañeta went to see her to take her away.‘

l.

The date/benefactive morpheme used on certain postposed

adverbial locatives: (i)la ―over there‖. Similarly, this case

marker may be a source for adverbials: it is common for the

initial vowel to be dropped:

ogi ña ogi la-iña

e-ge-tue.

HORT-DAT HORT over there-DAT come.to-I-URG

‗Come over there, all of you, quickly.‘

m. (i)-ñafe: ―come.here‖ (can also be inflected with plural –ni and with full utterance include tete: ―come.in.sight-I‖, as in (i)-ñafe tete, ―come over here (towards me).‖

5.3.16.4 Instrumental –ki (INST)

This suffix occurs on both animate nouns (but only with certain verbs: die, marry, have shame, lie to; examples b, c) and inanimate nouns. Note that there is an homophonic valence-increasing affix –ki, an adverbializer -ki,and a negative mirative –ki. These are readily distinguishable by the type of morpheme hosting the suffix. The valence-increasing affix must follow a verb stem, and is followed by a aspect/mood suffix; the adverbial suffix appears on a noun stem ; the negative mirative suffix usually occurs on interrogative phrases word finally and is usually pronounced with a lengthened vowel for emphasis (–kii), as in uwambekii?.

The comitative case suffix is generally used with human persons, in particular oblique participants, not active agents or thematic participants. The accusative plural –ni occurs on the comitative morpheme. There is

at least one attested case of the comitative referencing ‗through‘ or ‗by means of‘ an environment (g).

5.3.16.6 Allative, -na. (ALL)
The Kalapalo allative references ‗direction towards‘ a locative goal of an active verb. These goals are either a geographical setting or an active verb nominalization. There doesn‘t seem to be a distinct location in word order in the utterance. Note there are two special directional morphemes 1) –ka used both with a hammock (as for example, etiŋa-ka: to lie down in the hammock, from etige, ‗hammock‘), and with water ( as for

163

example, tuwa-ka, ‗to the water‘,) and 2) -ta, used for containers as, efu-ta, ‗to the canoe‘, uɳa-ta, „to the house‘.

5.3.16.7 Ablative, -peŋine. „away (out, back) from‟ (ALL)

This case suffix can be used as an semantic case modifier of an adverbial or a nominal, and also as in (f) appearing on a verb. In the first instance it is also a perhaps a way of nominalizing the adverb. This case morpheme is used in extended intransitive or transitive clauses when the actor is human, as in a, b,d, f. In transitive clauses, if P is inanimate or a nominal attribute, the case marker may be used if the A is human (as in examples (c) and (g).

a.

alolatï-peŋine, ‗come out from the bottom‘ (of the water)

164

b. uŋalï-peŋine, ‗come out from the house‘

This example show the ablative suffix on a verb formed from an

5.3.16.8 Destination, -kaiŋa (DEST)
The NP hosting this construction may be animate or inanimate, but the actor who ‗arrives at‘ is always animate. This and the following two case morphemes are all hosted by NPs referencing a person or thing as a

165

locative goal of an agent‘s travel, including place names, or geographical features. Note: there is a locative adverbial -kai, ‗on‘,‘beside‘, where the final suffix -ŋa does not appear (discussed in 10.3.5.1).

5.3.16.9 –pe, marking non-subject argument

a.

In this example of –pe on a proper name, the suffix marks the

NP as the non-subject target of the subordinate verb, which is in

the ‗goal‘ marked dative/benefactive construction (Same

example as 5.5.1.2 g).

Madyawagi te-ta.

Madyawagi go.away-CI

‗He went away, Madyawagi went away to shoot Ugukutsu.‘

b. In this example the root li-, ‗drink‘ is in possessive nominal construction with t- ―reflexive‖ and the -pe construction marking a partial feature of the object argument of the subordinate verb ‗pull out‘:

tuwa-ka ete-lu, tu-li-tsu-pe

166

‗The very next thing she did was she went to the water‘s edge to draw some for his beverage.‘

f.

In this example of –pe on a de-verbal nominal, the NP is the

―stimulus‖ of the transitive verb ‗reject‘, hence bearing the

ergative suffix (see discussion of ergativity in Verb Chapter).

õ-lï-fa

‗She turned down the man who was her (bride-service) worker

(i.e., betrothed).‘

5.3.17 . Relative clause modifier suffix, -tsї (M)
The nominal modifier suffix (M) may occur on either the head or relative clause noun, but not both (but it may appear on a series of NPs that follow one another and modify the same head noun; and also occurs on a verbal clause or adverb that modifies a noun). M is usually often followed by the primary topical participant morpheme –fa (PTP) that occurs in final position on the grammatical nominal word. The modifier and the primary topical participant suffixes often co-occur; both have functions having to do with topicality. M references new information about the same head noun, while PTP preserves nominal topical continuity when the syntactic function of the noun changes. The nominal modifier suffix and the class inclusion copula suffix seem to always function as mutually distinctive morphemes, as they always appear in grammatical word final position and they never co-occur. In general, –tsï rarely ends a grammatical word; it seems to need one (but never more than one) suffixed or cliticized morpheme. Some examples include: the primary topical participant –fa; the immediate taxis clitic =fofo; the negative mirative suffix –ki; and the pejorative =su clitic. All these have an element of emphatic semantics. Similarly the evidential suffix and the desiderative suffix never occur with M.
a. Here the modified argument is A (marked with ergative case feke); the head noun is unmarked:
lepe tu-i-lï i-feke, ah Kusimefu-feke-tsï-fa next REF-do-PI 3-ERG, EXP Kusimefu- ERG-M-PTP ‗Next he did it, Kusimefu did.
b. Here the modifier of the head noun of the main clause is marked with M:
uɳa-ta ti-lo-po masope-tsї-fa, house-inside REF-nearby-ADV secluded.girl-M-PTP, i-ñ-uɳu-fa 3-PB-house-PTP

167

‗Inside the house someone near him, a secluded girl, the housed one.‘

In the following example M occurs on a pronominal demonstrative (ATR), which modifies the head noun of the main clause.

c.

tama-ki ekugu ule-tsї tsїgї-pe

e-iñїgї

soft-ADV fully AFR-M bone-POSS-SAL EX-TR

‗That one‘s bone‘s became soft forever.‘

Another type of modifier marking involves M on the NP that serves as the argument (P or A) of a subsequent transitive clause with P also marked with a pronominal prefix.

d. A ‗new information‘ de-verbalized NP (bracketed) preceding the verbal clause in which the NP is P argument‖:

[uk-ifugu e-ŋe- Ø-tsï-fa]

i-ña-mba-lї

.

1+2-ancestor eat.flesh-RES-M-PTP 3-consume-Va-PI

ukw-oto-feke

dual-parent-ERG

‗The result is our elders are devoured when our parent has a

meal.‘

In this example, the head noun (a proper name) receives the modifier as new information is given in a juxtaposition of the nouns.

e.

itoto felei, itseke

felei, Taugi-tsï toto.

man ADEM powerful being ADEM, Taugi-M man

‗Taugi changed himself, he turned into a woman. He is a man

(who did that), a powerful being, Taugi is (usually thought of as)

a man.

f.

In a patient-backgrounding construction, the relative noun is

suffixed with M; it is the same P as is ‗backgrounded‘.

ñ-aŋa-kaga-ni

fiatu-fu-le-tsï

PB-arm-contain-PL deer- just (only)-ATR-M

‗Holding in their arms only a deer.‘

g. The following is an example of complex utterance involving use of both class inclusion copula suffix -i and -tsï modifier morphemes in a complex NP construction. This construction may be represented as: [[[NP [[NP-M] [NP-CL]]]. In this example the class inclusion copula suffix –i on the final NP ―food‖ predicates the preceding NP, which is itself a relative clause showing the modifier –tsï. Note also that both the ‗old information‘ and ‗new information‘ NPs host the ‗pejorative‘ clitic su.

168
kuaku=su to-fo-pi-dyï-ku-i-la. nightjar=PEJ REF-point-Vi-PI-INT-CL-NEG
kuõ-tsï=su otu-i wild.plant.name-M-PEJ food-CL ‗Weird nightjar the one with the beak that‘s really not sharp, (Who has) weeds (serving for) food.‘

5.3.18 Primary topical participant –fa (PTP)

This suffix is required when the syntactic function of a noun phrase shifts but topicalization of old information needs to be preserved. For this reason, I refer to –fa as a ‗shift-function‘ morpheme as described by Van Valin Jr. and La Polla (1997: 207) This suffix occurs in what is generally the final position of the Kalapalo noun phrase. It functions to mark the primary topical participant in a clause chain, especially where the same referent occurs in a series of differently marked verbal arguments, such as not only with an explicit absolutive pronominal prefix on the verb phrase, but also as a pronominal demonstrative or with the anaphoric focus referent ule.

a.

In this example the first use of -fa appears on the focus shifting

ule-clause, which has major discourse segment scope. A new

action occurs but the same primary topical participant is

referenced. This participant is a woman who is the main actor in

the events. She has been told to prepare some food for her

husband, and so she now begins that work.

REFL-husband-DAT/BEN soak-Vt-VPE 3-ERG

‗Taking a handful, poki, she soaked it for her husband, they say,

she soaked it‘.

b. An example from the affinal civility register. Here the middle voice ‗see, think‘ consideration complement verb has been nominalized. The person under consideration is the ‗sister‘ the man is now being encouraged to ask for as his wife.
ah mukwe-tsï-fa, et-iŋGu-Gi=tofo-i EXP EM-M-PTP MV-see.think-CAUS=USIN-CL

169

c. In this example the reference of the demonstrative and the things ‗that have been put down‘ are the same.

ege-fa

i-pufi-tsi-ke-ge i-ña-ndo-ŋo-ko-tsï-fa

PDEM-PTP 3-skin-remove-Vt-I 3-put down-Vt-LOCN-PL-M-

PTP

‗―Skin these.‖ The ones that had been put down beside her, I

mean.‘

5. 4 Word class-changing nominal derivations

Kalapalo resembles other Cariban languages insofar as there is pervasive presence of nominalization processes. These include both structural and semantic nominal derivations operating on both the lexical and clausal levels. Structural derivations involve changes in the syntactic roles of the derived forms. These include grammatical or word-class changing derivations: de-verbalized and de-adverbialized nominalizations, and to a lesser degree, nominalized ideophones. Word class-changing nominalizations become changed syntactically to function as new verbal arguments. Semantic derivations are in general re-nominalized nouns, that is, nouns that have been derived from other nouns. Renominalized nouns may become place names, establish deictic and plurality details of objects and persons; and shift a speaker‘s reference from a fairly common natural species to that of a dangerous powerful being. Other important nominalizations reference the agent of a transitive verb, experiencer of a state, the consequence of an action, and the thing used to effect an action. To summarize Kalapalo nominalization functions:

a.

Operating at the clausal level to create predications regarding

stative and active verb arguments. In the case of de-verbal

nominalizations, the argument structure of verbs is preserved,

either overtly with the case-marked NP present in the clause, or

covertly, by the type of derivational suffix used.

b. Operating at the lexical level to create word-class changing nominalizations and also to re-nominalize other nouns.

c. Operating in predication regarding ideophonic and adverbial attributes. As a process enabling subordination, nominalization is an important means of creating subordinate clauses, often from main VP but also from other nouns and adverbials as well as stative and active verb nominalizations.

Table 21 shows seventeen attested types of non-aspectual nominal derivational suffixes, their glosses, and examples of derived forms. With the exception of Types 10, 11 (which are subsets), each of these is a single morpheme ‗type‘. As can be seen from Table 21, these non-aspectual suffixes operate on all three of the major open word classes. The seventeenth type of suffix occurs as two sets, pertaining to active and stative de-verbal aspectual nominalizations respectively. For

170
ease of description, these are presented in Table 22 with examples to follow the table. A separate discussion section examines the case for aspectual properties of this set. Plural, possessive, and copula suffixes (all of which appear on nouns) are also not included in Table 21 as they are discussed in earlier sections of this chapter and in Chapter 8: Copularity.

5.4.1 Non-aspectual nominalizations
Seventeen types of non-aspectual nominalization suffixes are attested. Description of the semantics of each morpheme and examples follow.

171

5.4.1.1 –(i)ɳa (SN), stative S

This nominalizer occurs on the existential copular stem its- and stative intransitive stems.

a.

ufitsu its-i-ɳa=mukwe ukuge

1-wife EX-CL-SN=EM human

‗If only this were human she could be a wife for me.‘

5.4.1.2. –ni (AN), active agent
This nominalizer appears on active verbs, both transitive and intransitive and on some lexicalized onstructions with roots that no longer have meanings. The morpheme is identical to the absolutive pluralizer that appears on both active verbs and ergative, dative/benefactive, and comitative case markers. Examples of this de-verbal nominalization process include: kueɳeni, ‗our eater‘; iñambani, ‗those who drink them‘; kuñiɳuGini: ‗those who see like us‘. Notice the nominalizer suffix replaces the expected verbal aspect/mood inflection.
ageni, „only a few‘ (from the numeral, agetsi, ‗one‘) ñafeni, ‗firm‘ (from the imperative lexeme, ñafe, ‗come here‘)
tї-eku-ni tuwa fuɳeni RQ-intensive-NEG water hardly.any ‗Why in the world isn‘t there enough water here?‘

5.4.1.3. –(i)ñe(ї) (EXN), ‗experiencer of a state‘

This suffix appears on -ki and t- adverbs; intransitive stative verbs; adverbials and underived nouns. I have one example of an ideophonic construction. Examples of nominalized de-verbal adverbials follow:

t-uŋ-is-iñe

.

REF-distribute-ADV-EXN

‗that which is shared (distributed)‘

t-et-idyi-pї-iñe

REF-MV-extract-SAL?-EXN

‗those who have come out separately (one by one)‘, i.e.,

‗offspring‘

Some examples of EXN on –ki and –t-adverbials (attributives formed of verbs and nouns) are in the following list.

u-ku-ki-ñe 1-prohibit-ADV-EXN ‗my being prohibited‘ (avoidance state)

172
t-ala-ki-ñe, REF-pale-ADV-EXN ‗3p whiteness‘
ti-teni-ñe ‗its heaviness‘ REF-heavy-EXN

173

tatokiñeko, REF-friend-ADV-EXN-PL), ‗their own friends‘ (‗those who are friendly with each other‘). is-uwї-ki-ñe 3-father-ADV-EXN, ‗a paternal man‘, ‗a father to someone‘ tї-fitse-ɳe-ki-ñe REF-rotten smell-CAUS-ADV-EXN ‗the rotten smelling one‘ takataka-ti-ñe takataka-ADV-EXN, ‗what goes takataka‘
(i.e., a gourd that is drying out). This is an an ideophonic nominalization ,

5.4.1.4 –pe (ESS), ‗essive‘

This essive nominalizer references the NP as ‗existing in a state or mode of existence‘. It may appear on a nominal or verbal word (thereby deverbalizing the construction). –pe also often appears on the P argument of a main resultative clause, or a de-verbal nominalization. The homophynous suffix referencing the non-subject ‗theme‘ of an extended intransitive subordinate clause verb is described in 5.4.15.9.

a.

Here -pe appears on both the kinship word and the proper name,

marking the thematic target of the thetic verb construction.

Here, there is no possibility of thinking of ‗daughter‘ as

something that existed in the past; she still exists; SAL has a

different function here. But why is the noun marked at all? I

believe this is because it could be a kind of essive

nominalization.

ekï

endisï-pe=lefa ti-mbi-Ø, Afuseti-pe.

unknown.name daughter-ESS=MT REF-steal-TH, Afuseti- ESS

‗What‘s his name‘s daughter, Afuseti, is stolen.‘

b. A similar example, in which –pe marks the essive status of a locative noun, the verb being non-finite (thetic).

lepe is-iŋï-ŋo-pe

t-e-ti.

next 3-behind-LOC-ESS REF-come.to-TH

‗Next one of those who were behind him came up towards

them.‘

c. In this example, ESS appears on a localization nominal word.

iŋila-ŋo-pe-fa

u-itsa≈tïfïgï kapaŋa-miti

beginning-NLOC-ESS-PTP 1-EX≈IMP different-ADV

‗At the beginning I used to behave differently.‘

174

d.

Here the verb stem pondo-te, ‗cover over‘ has been nominalized

with suffix –pe:

fiñuka, i--pondo-te-pïgï-pe Afiñuka, 3-covering-Vt-VPE-ESS ‗Afiñuka, whose (face) was concealed (who was covered over).‘

e.

ah, ufitsu-pe=lefa te-ŋe-Ø-feke.

EXP, 1-wife-ESS=MT eat.flesh-Vt-RES-ERG

‗Surely, in the end he was making a meal of my wife‘ (more lit,‘

parts of my wife were being eaten by him in the end‘).

f.

In this example the salient copula suffix is used as thematic

marker on the head of a subordinate clause.

igea=lefa a-ŋakafu-gu-a a-tïfïgï tamaki, this.way=MT 2-hair-POSS-U EQS-IMP soft ‗And just like your special kind of hair, it‘s become soft‘.

ule-pe atehe-tsï-fa. AFR-ESS EQA-PER-M-PTP ‗It has remained that way.‘

5.4.1.5 .-ne/nu(a) (CONT)

This is a pair of contrastive nominalizers. Examples include: uiɳinu, ‗my not being seen‘; iñalї tsakunu: ‗he‘s not one of the runners‘ (among a group):

5.4.1.6 -iɳi (NN), ‗negative‘ or ‗malefactive‘.
This morpheme references an experiencer of an active event. Examples include:
a. An adverbialized de-verbal causative that has become nominalized:

175

i-ɳi-tso-ɳa-tu-iɳi 3-see-Vt-CAUS-N-NN ‗person kept from being seen‘ (or, ‗experiencing being made invisible‘), i.e., in puberty seclusion.

5.4.1.7. –ofo, -tofo (USIN) ‗usitative‘

This is the usitative nominalizer. ―Usitative‖ is a general term for several related types of nominalizations that operate on nouns, adverbs and active, or stative verbs (but all involving voluntary processes). This morpheme is often used to de-verbalize an active verb. It often appears in place names constructed from verb phrases. (Note the morphologically similar ‗immediate‘ taxis clitic –fofo, ‗right now‘,‘immediate‘.) Where USIN de-verbalizes a transitive morpheme, the arguments of the deverbalized clauses are preserved.

b. tu-ge-kig-ofo: REF-poison-Vt-USIN ‗their would-be poisoners‘

c.

agetsi-ɳu-et-ofo, ‗one little one used to advance‘ (‗six‘);

d. An adverbial that has been verbalized, then nominalized with USIN, then re- verbalized as a transitive with the ergative marked A at clause final position.

aGipi-tsi-g≈ofo-iŋo bangs (fringe)-Vt≈allow-USIN-POT ‗I‘m planning to cut her bangs.‘

river where people grilled their larger fish).

g. In this example –tofo is used on the causativized verb, ‗envy‘ and express the sense of ‗source‘. In this example, the nominal is followed by the class inclusion copula suffix –i; both verbal arguments are present.

This example shows a denominalized intransitive verb: ‗enclose‘

that has been renominalized. The potential mood verb suffix is

preserved but follows the nominalizer.

5.4.1.8 -tsofo (BN)

177

This appears to be a behavioral attributive, but there are only a few examples so more work needs to be done to describe the semantic function more clearly.

a. This is a a formal term for relatives, not often used. Kalapalo speakers were not able to explain the meaning of the root of this word.

5.4.1.9. –tu (ATN)
This morpheme appears suffixed to many nouns and may be an archaic possessive that has been fused with the no longer meaningful stem. Examples include:
etu, ‗settlement‘ kwotu, ‗sad‘ itsotu, ‗angry‘ kumuŋetu ‗one of our immature persons‘, ‗our youngster‘ fonitu, ‗umbilical cord‘ otu, „solid food‘

5.4.1.10 Degree nominalizations: augmentatives and diminuatives
There are five morphemes in this set: -kusїgї (DIM); -kũegї;(AUG); -tsũegї (MAJ); -fũegї (EXCE); -ɳu, lesser, least (LT). Members of this set of morphemes are used to re-nominalize nouns. Examples include: 1) With kusїgї (DIM: simple diminuatives, used for both animates and inanimates: itau-kusïgï: little girl; atau-kusїgї, ‗little carrying basket‘; fїgei-kusїgї., ‗little arrow‘. 2) With-kũegї;(AUG): names of powerful beings that are often animal category names + kuegї (ekekuegï: Snake Monster; itaũ-kuegї, ‗Monstrous Women‘). 3) With -

178

kũegї;(AUG): animal category names with a sense of ‗unusual‘, ‗different from more common species‘ (kafugu-kuegï: wooly monkeys, that is ‗different howler monkeys‘). 4) With -fũegї (EXCE): the most extreme or excessive of a nominal reference; mostly very dangerous powerful beings: itofuegï: ‗firestorm‘; atu-fuegї, the very biggest peccary. 5). With -tsũegї (MAJ): also for types of the most extreme or excessive, this morpheme can be used itself as a nominal with et-middle voice prefix, etsũegї ‗the most extreme, greatest‘; Nitsuegї, (name of a powerful being, the Black Jaguar). 6) - ɳu (LT) Nominalizations consgtructed with thie ‗least‘ or ‗lesser‘ suffix have the sense not only of a very small size, but also with the sense of ‗a very few‘; ‗appealing, cute‘ (because, ―very small‖). This suffix may also occur with the anaphoric focus referent (ule) and to construct de-adverbializations. Some of the roots are not semantically transparent.

f.

There are other lexical forms with this suffix but they do not

reference ‗least‘ or ‗lesser‘; the suffix appears to be a generalized

stative attributive : ufiɳu, ‗alike‖; tetuɳu, ‗heavy‖, itotuɳu, ‗hot

to the touch‘, i woɳu, ‗wide tree‘.

g. As another example of how these augmentatives and diminuatives may be used, the following is a list of elicited

179
words for types of peccaries (the generic term for this animal is feu): atu (white-lipped peccary, a large species) atu-fuegї (the largest species) feu (collared peccary) feu-kuegї (described as itseke,„powerful being‘) etsuegї, („the most extreme‘).

5.4.1.11- ŋo, -mbo (NLOC)

Nominals with these suffixes are located in a flat surfaced environment. The locative suffixes are used to renominalize nouns.

5.4.1.12 mbїɳї, negative state, „without‟ (W)

This morpheme forms a negative on other nouns; it contrasts with the aspectual -mbїgї ‗former state‘ suffix (FO), the negative copula suffix – la, ‗not‘, and the de-verbal contrastive nominalizer –nu. Examples include:

a. i-fitsu-mbïŋï 3-wife-W ‗person without a wife‘

This nominalization suffix and the adverbial fїɳї ‟unlike‘ are remarkable antonyms with similar morphophonemic construction. The first example exhibits both: a nominalization of an identificational demonstrative which is then adverbialized.

5.4.1.15. –fu (CAND)

This nominalizer has the sense of ‗candidate for doing X‘. Many names and nominals take this suffix (e.g., kutufu: tree termites; ugufu: vulture; kafu: sky, Aɳafu; Kusimefu (personal names), but most seem to have undeconstructable stems.

‗someone who seemed to want to travel around‘, ‗explorer‘

5.4.1.16. –nїmi, (CONS), ‗consequential‘

This nominalizer suffix references the consequence of an activity. It occurs on semantic verbs (c,d) and also on the stative equative copular verb stem a- (a, b). Some examples include:

5.4.1.17. Aspectual nominalizations
Last in Table 21 are the aspectual nominalizations. These are discussed separately and appear for ease of reference in Table 22 with their glosses and translations. The table is followed by the discussion of Kalapalo nominal aspect, with examples.

182

5.4.2 Aspectual de-verbal nominalizations

Derivational processes create nominalizations from both static and active verbs. In a narrative, nominalized verbs shift attention away from the action and focus upon the nature of the event as described by the verb. Deverbal nominalizations thus have an important function as a clause chaining subordination strategy (see Chapter 14: Grammar and Narrative) and also interact with the de-transitive strategies in the language. Nominalizations tend to preserve the argument structures of the underlying verb constructions.
There are nine attested aspectual nominalizations. Seven of these are deverbal nominalizing suffixes, two others occur as renominalization suffixes. These are presented in Table 21 together with their glosses and translations.

-tsipїgї, ‗unending imperfective state‘ US --fopїgї, ‗almost but never accomplished‘ ICP

tїfїgї, imperfective
IMP

Kalapalo nominalizations using aspectual suffixes reference a number of de-verbal and two non-verbal predications concerning the end result or eventuality of situations, both perfective and imperfective. Some of these suffixes are used as active verb nominalizations. Others nominalize stative and copular verbs. Two are attested as re-nominalizers. The resultant nouns may be inflected with person prefixes or they may exist with a nominal modifier, and the final suffix is always –gї. These features suggest parallelism with possessive nominal constructions. Unlike possessive nominals, however, there are no plural suffixes possible, and it is important to remember that the roots of the nominalizations are always verbal.
Stative nominal aspect suffixes may be distinguished according to a variety of predicational features involving transformed, passing, unending, resultative, former or terminated (including deceased), and non-existent states. (The ‗consequential‘ nominalizer -nїmi is included in the non-aspectual group discussed in the previous section). Active

183
verb nominalizations include: end result of an involuntary process, end result of a voluntary process; incompletive, i.e., entity has not yet been achieved or come into being (as result of a process); entity involved in an initiated or attempted but never accomplished action; entity involved in an imperfective action The usage of some of these Kalapalo nominal aspect morphemes is governed by the animate or inanimate status of the entity concerned. One appears only with words for inanimate entities, others occur only with human entities. Following T. Payne I am using the idea of ―involuntary processes‖ to include one argument verbs involving change of state, no act of volition, no motion through space, and/or no motion of an object (1997:55). These verbs are nominalized with the locative suffix –ŋo.
Other than perfective nominalizations implicitly contrasting with imperfective and stative nominalizations (shown in Table 210), the correspondence between verbal and nominal aspects is purely semantic, and even then, verbal aspect is closely linked to mood which is not marked on nominals. Furthermore, as described in Chapter 7: Verbs and Verbalizations, aspect/mood inflections are an important marker of syntactic verb function. On the other hand, copular verbs occur in nominalized perfective and imperfective aspects (iñïgï; anïgï; atïfïgï), and these morphemes as well as the perfect atehe can occur as predicational modifiers of non-verbal clauses. Unlike verbal affect/mood suffixes, Kalapalo aspectual nominal morphemes do not take a plural suffix.
While the nominalizers described in section 5.6.2 appear to have phrasal derivational functions, aspectual nominalizations operate at the clausal level. An important piece of evidence for this is the presence of A and O verbal arguments preserved in the nominal clause. Second, as examples 5.6.3.1.4b, c, h, i; 5.6.3.1.5b (below) demonstrate, the aspectual nominalization suffix may be preceded by one of the nonaspectual nominalization suffixes listed in Table 21. However, there is also a case of the active A nominalizer (AN) following the VPE active verb nominalizer (5.6.3.1, 3g).

Chapter 6 Demonstratives
Demonstratives are a small, closed word class in Kalapalo, with very limited inflections. In this chapter, I examine in detail this word class and the functions the members play in nominal and verbal (including copular verb) predications. Demonstratives can be distinguished syntactically from nouns as they cannot be derived from members of other word classes, nor may they be subject to derivational processes. Fuirthermore they do not host case markers. Generally demonstratives appear at the end of the clause constructions.
6.1 Types of Demonstratives
There are five types of Kalapalo demonstratives, distinguished according to prosody, predicational function, and their place in clausal constituent order. I use Diessel‟s 1999; 2009 terminological distinctions for the first three and Dixon‟s (2010, Vol. 2, Chapter 15) terms for the fourth and fifth.
-Pronominal demonstratives and free personal pronouns. These morphemes are person marked and either operate as free personal pronouns or to head modified NP.s. As free pronouns, they substitute for nouns (especially name, kinship term or other relationship word). They may also be used as independent personal pronouns when personal identity requires emphasis for pragmatic reasons. Independent pronouns can be distinguished from pronominal demonstratives prosodically as the former are stressed on the initial syllable while the latter are stressed on the final syllable.
The stem shapes of pronominal demonstratives are distinguished by the presence of the full set of pronominal prefixes that distinguish person status on possessed nouns and verbs. Like other demonstratives they usually appear following their predicates. However, they do not take case suffixes When pronominal demonstratives occur in a possessive NP, however, they will precede their possessed predicates as do other possessor nouns. I include in this set of pronominal demonstratives two others that have general third person reference. The first is an anaphoric member uŋele (ANA) only used with animate arguments. The second is ule, a multifunctional anaphoric topic referent (ATR). These two morphemes seem related as both may be formed from the distal third person demonstrative ele. Finally, there is an indefinite pronominal demonstrative sei.

191

- Adnominal demonstratives may accompany a coreferential noun or de-verbal nominalization predicate, and in some cases a finite verb clause. The set distinguishes between inanimate and animate entities, but members of the set are not person marked. As they are stressed on the second syllable, they exhibit an emergent vocalic glide. The morpheme is preceded by /f/, or /s/ for the indefinite form. Definite animate entities are distinguished between (a) felei, 3p distal or remote (not in the environment of speaker or hearer), and (b) fegei, 3p proximate (in environment of speaker and hearer). The inanimate adnominal demonstrative (c) figei, has no distal-proximate contrast. The latter is used not only for inanimate entities but to index situations. Figei sometimes follows a finite verb, in which case it appears to function as a focus on the action. There is a fourth proximate „indefinite‟ adnominal demonstrative segei and an indefinite distal adnominal demonstrative selei. These appear to have very restricted use. Adnominal demonstratives may precede a deontic postposition. (See examples 6.1.1c; 6.1.2h).

-Identificational demonstratives: egei, elei, igei. Identificational demonstratives only appear with adverbs and copular verb clauses. They appear clause initially when followed by an adverb or clause final in copular verb clauses. As with other demonstrative types, they may also appear at the end of verbless clauses. The set distinguishes the same three types of entities found in the adnominal demonstrative set: 3p distal (elei), 3p proximate (egei), inanimate or situational (igei). With emphasis on the second syllable, there is an emergent glide as with adnominal demonstratives. However, the morphophonemic shape differs as there is no initial /f/.

-Local adverbial demonstratives: inde, ande, wende,

unde. These demonstratives point to the location of an

object or person‟s relation to a second noun, from the

speaker‟s perspective.

Locational adverbial

demonstratives usually appear clause initially with both

verbal clauses and in locative NP predications. The

locative demonstrative may be used directly to refer to

the person who is being „placed‟ by the word. In this

regard they are syntactically similar to the free personal

pronouns. However, they differ syntactically

from

personal pronouns in being able to host epistemic and

interclausal reference marking clitics

-Manner demonstrative: ige(i)a (proximate), ila (distal). The manner demonstrative always occurs

192
clause initially, and always with the –a „unique‟ copula suffix. It may be followed by another adverbial suffix.
6.1.1 Inflectional and word order features of demonstratives
With the exception of the adverbial locational demonstratives, Kalapalo demonstratives have the same or very similar stem shapes (adnominals have an initial /f/ or /s/) but have inflectional differences. The definite adnominal and identificational demonstratives may host the class inclusion copula suffix –i, the “unique” copula suffix –a (U) to reference “uniqueness” and the „salient‟ copula suffix –pe (SAL) to reference a partitive noun:
a. igei-i b.igei-a c. igei-pe
d. The „manner‟ demonstrative IDEM (igea, „this way‟) is always constructed with the –a suffix.
Only the „situational‟ identificational demonstrative igei may host an interclausal reference marker (=dya, DE), but then only with the „intensive‟ adverbial suffix –ku (INT) construction, as in (d). The situational identificational demonstrative and the manner demonstrative are thus very similar but have syntactic differences when it comes to word order.
d. igei-ku-dya IDEM-INT-DE „just like that (other event)...‟
In predicational clauses, the predicate (whether adverbial, nominal, or verbal) will appear directly before a demonstrative. (e) is an example showing the use of an adnominal demonstrative with a nominal predicate.
e. u-ititї fegei 1-name ADEM „This is my name.‟
Occasionally a demonstrative will precede the predicate. This will only occur when there is focalization. The following nominative-accusative imperative construction shows O in such a focalized position:
g. ege-pe ake-tsa-ŋe tuŋ-Gwe. PDEM-SAL SD-DEO give-I „One of these should be given by you.‟

193

Apparently the local adverbial demonstrative is always focalized as it normally always appears clause initially. (Lexical adverbs may occur in clause initial or clause final position).

6.2 Pronominal demonstratives or free personal pronouns
Members of this set substitute for NPs. They are often simply juxtaposed to the nominal or adverbial predicate. Pronominal demonstratives also function as verbal arguments. Third person forms may host copula suffixes. The set is summarized in the following table:

f.

An imperative example, where the third person

proximate pronominal demonstrative hosts the „partitive‟

salient suffix –pe (and is perhaps thereby re-nominalized

if demonstratives are considered a kind of noun) and

precedes the deontic postposition and the final verbal

imperative predication „give‟ (same example as 6.1.1.g):

ege-pe

ake-tsa-ŋe tuŋ-Gwe.

PDEM-SAL SD-DEO

give-I

„One of these should be given by you‟.

g. Use of 3p ege occurs as 2p vocative free pronoun in casual male speech, usually to call someone‟s attention to the speaker.
ege (response) ai „you‟ „Yes?‟ („I‟m listening‟)

h. Use of inanimate pronoun ige with class inclusion copula suffix -i in a rhetorical interrogative construction:

j.

The indefinite third person sei heading an existential

copular imperative construction:

ah, ege-te sei≈ts-e EXP you-URG PNOM-EX≈I „Now you‟re something who must live (up) there!‟

6.2.3. Other non-verbal predications using pronominal demonstratives

197

a. In a fusional type of construction, the first person pronominal demonstrative as a free pronoun is virtually prefixed to the deontic post-positional stem in imperative mood; there is, however, no deontic prefix ake-. This may mean the demonstrative substitutes for the prefix:
uge≈tsaŋe. me≈DEO „It must be (has to be) me‟

6.2.4. Pronominal demonstrative as verbal argument

a.

Use of pronominal 3p distal ele as S of active equative copular

verb with adverbial adjunct (bracketed):

.

[etefu-andi,] Uledyalu ata-ni,

PDEM EQA-CI [stomach-fill], Uledyalu EQS-CI

„She was pregnant, Uledyalu was,

b. In an extended transitive speech act („says something about you to us‟), the second person pronominal demonstrative uege references an oblique argument. Note there is no case marker.

„We‟re the only ones he‟s given it to.‟

6.3 Anaphoric pronominal demonstratives

There are two other pronominal demonstrative morphemes. These are not distinguished as to person or number. They are the anaphoric free pronoun uŋele, and the anaphoric focus referent ule (AFR). Both function syntactically to some degree like free pronouns insofar as they allow the –pe or –a copula suffixes, and exhibit relatively free order, either preceding or following a clause. They differ in accepting the primary topical participant marker –fa (see Chapter 14.3).

6.3.1 uŋele, free pronoun (ANA)

This may be translated ‘: that same person‟. The anaphorical

pronominal always appears utterance initially. It appears to

function to „continuity focus‟ a NP that has appeared previously

in focus by fronting. This is what happens to the NP iɳe, „bee

hive‟ in line ii.

b. lepene uŋele etimbe-pïgï at-ani=lefa. afterwards ANA arrive-VPE EQA-ANT=MT „Later on that person (will have) returned from working on his own place.‟

6.3.2 ule, anaphoric focus referent (AFR)
This morpheme references the focal status of a participant in a sequence of events. It has two major functions. First, as in examples (a) and (b), ule frequently occurs at the beginning of a major narrative segment,

199

marking a shift from immediately preceding focus to a new one. Second, when ule appears at the end of a subordinate clause as shown in brackets in (c), it marks the clause as subordinate and the O of the subordinate clause as equivalent to S of the main clause. The subordinator function of ule is discussed further in Chapter 13: 13.4.5).
a. ule anaphoric focus referent marking a major segment focal shift in a narrative. This function involves the suffix –fa, allowing ule to mark a primary topical participant. Where ule references an event context, it hosts a taxis clitic (b):

ule igiku-ni-ta=fale fegei Taugi-feke AFR envy-Vt-CI=NT ADEM Taugi-ERG
„Because of all that, now Taugi envied him‟.

b.

ule-tse-ŋuGi i-fïgi-pe ti-dyï≈lefa

„Suddenly stopping that, he removed his arrow

tafaku-gu ugupo-ŋo-peŋine. bow-POSS above-MAL-LOC-ABL from his bow (held) threateningly above (him)‟.

c. ule marking a subordinate clause:

a.

kuigiku etu-ki-lï

li-tsa-ule-tï

i-feke-ne.

hot.soup finished-PI drink-CI-AFR-M 3-ERG-PL

„When the hot soup was ready, it‟s said they all drank it‟.

6.4 Adnominal demonstratives
There are three adnominal demonstratives: figei (inanimate), fegei (proximate), and felei (distal). For at least three reasons, these must be distinguished from pronominal demonstratives. First, there is no person marking, only proximate/distal and animate/inanimate contrasts. Second, unlike pronominal demonstratives, adnominal demonstratives never themselves serve as arguments in transitive verb clauses. Third, in nominal predicational constructions, while their syntactic relation to the predicate appears to be the same as pronominal demonstratives (predicate NP + demonstrative; examples 1.a-d), there are however constructions where the adnominal demonstrative is used as a modifier of the head NP. Thus the adnominal demonstrative functions as a relative pronoun.

200

6.4.1 Nominal predications with adnominal demonstratives

In this function, an adnominal demonstrative serves as the head of the phrase, whether a NP (a, b) or a VP (c). Examples (d and e) show the adnominal demonstrative heading de-verbal nominalizations.

a.

An example of the distal adnominal demonstrative in

nominal predication:

iɳandsu felei,

iɳandsu.

the sister ADEM, the sister

„That was the sister, the sister.

b. This example shows a proximate adnominal demonstrative heading a NP to create an attributive predication:

ku-mu-ŋe-tu

fegei

1+2-son-Vi-ATN DEM„one of our youths‟

c.

The proximate adnominal demonstrative follows an intransitive

construction in this example, marking S:

auGї-nda fegei lie-CI ADEM „That‟s (3p) lying‟.

d. An example in which the proximate demonstrative appears with a deverbal nominalization, marking S
ukw-ege=su fegei 1-lazy=PEJ ADEM „my unwillingness to work‟

e. In another verbless clause, a proximate adnominal demonstrative following a nominalized transitive verb marks P:

ti-ŋene-ti-ñe

fegei

REF-fear-Vt-EXN ADEM

it‟s being frightened of something this is (i.e., „This one is afraid

6.4.2. Adnominal demonstratives as relative pronouns
In this function, the proximate adnominal demonstrative (or a homonym) marks a nominative-accusative relative clause construction, following the verb phrase even when there is a subsequent oblique argument (as in example (a). A point of interest is that the verb in the relative clause is

201

always in continuous/indicativeaspect/mood. A final feature is a pause between the two clauses.
The following (a) is one example of this type of construction. In this example, the O noun phrase is modified by the adnominal demonstrative appearing after the verb phrase. The clause in this example is in continuous indicative inflection. The adnominal demonstrative is modifying the NP in focus, tolo ipugu. The example is taken from a story about the trickster Taugi, who will turn himself into a woman in order to deceive a powerful being whose house he covets (see also example c).

Oblique Taugi-iña Taugi-BEN/DAT „“How beautiful the cover of bird feathers”. That‟s what someone told Taugi.‟

b. In this example, there is a cleft construction involving a copular clause built with the active equative „be‟ verb ata-. This is followed by a complement clause (in brackets). The copular subject igei-fuɳu, „unlike this‟ is separated from the adnominal modifier fegei by the verb phrase (boldfaced).

d. In this example, the main clause is highly abbreviated as there is only a discourse lexeme, „ready.done‟ and no

202

explicit argument, but there is no ambiguity as the preceding line of the story describes a woman going to see the piled-up remains of a snake she has cut into pieces; it is these piles that are moldering, „growing hair‟. The adnominal demonstrative follows the transitive relative clause. Also in this clause is an explicit argument structure referenced by the pronominal prefix its- (3S>3P). Again, the transitive verb is inflected in continuative indicative aspect/mood:

aifa,

its-upu-Gi-ta

fegei

ready.done, 3S>3P-mould-Vt-CI ADEM

„This was the result, the hair was growing on it.‟

6.4.3. Referencing a noun phrase as P argument

In some instances, the adnominal demonstrative references a noun phrase as P argument, of either an object-backgrounding (valence decreasing) clause, or a verb phrase in middle-voice construction.
In (a), the adnominal demonstrative (in boldface) references the preceding noun phrase as a P argument and as head noun of a relative clause, the adnominal demonstrative also functioning as a relative pronoun. This is possible because the immediately following valence decreasing object-backgrounding (OB) clause is actually a de-verbalized nominalization. As a de-verbal derivational construction,this is a type of subordination strategy (described further in Chapter 13:13.3.4). The distal adnominal demonstrative felei follows the noun phrase which is subsequently „backgrounded‟ in the final subordinate relative clause nominalized verb, „carry back‟ (bracketed). Again, as in preceding examples, the relative clause verb is in continuative/indicative aspect/mood.

[ñ-ige-ta-nïmi] [OB-bring.back-CI-CONS] „bringing back their older brother with the arrows sticking out of him.‟ (lit., „stick-out arrow their older brother whom they brought back‟)

b. In this example (similar to 6.4.2c) the inanimate or situational adnominal demonstrative references the preceding middle voice verbal construction as the argument of the relative „be‟ clause

203

that follows (in brackets). The verb „to change, transform oneself‟, like the other relative clauses in these examples, is inflected in continuative indicative aspect/mood. The relative clause describes an action that has resulted in the copular main clause. This main clause construction is a de-verbal „transformed state‟ (TR) nominal perfective NP.

6.4.4 Summary of relative clause marking by adnominal demonstratives

The following are the features of the use of adnominal demonstratives as relative pronouns, to mark relative clauses:

-The shared argument may be explicit in each clause, or only present in the relative clause, but not present only in the main clause.
-The arguments are either S or P; the main clause may have an extended argument but that is not shared with the relative clause.
-The relative clause verb is always in continuative indicative aspect/mood inflection
-The relative clause is always either middle voice intransitive, or if transitive nominative-accusative, or valence-decreased (patient backgrounding). This type of relative clause marking is thus an important aspect of the ergative split in the language.
-The main clause may be a single lexical word or an ideophone, with no explicit argument or verbal structure
-The main or subordinate clause can be a de-verbal nominalization, but not both.

6.5 Identificational demonstratives
As shown in Table 24, the stems of identificational demonstratives are the same as for pronominal and adnominal demonstratives. Identificational demonstratives show final glide as do adnominals, but unlike adnominals they lack the initial /f/ element. The indefinite identification begins with /s/. The identificational demonstratives appear in association with verbless, imperative or interrogative, or copular verb clauses, less commonly with finite transitive verb clauses. These demonstratives appear to mark the change of function of a NP appearing in two different clauses.

204

6.5.1. Referencing copula subject (CS)

Where the identificational demonstrative follows an adverbial adjunct, it references that adjunct as the situational condition of the existential copula verb in the clause. The copula construction in this case is always in continuous indicative aspect/mood (itsa).

a. Here, the situational demonstrative igei first directly follows an adverbial adjunct, then follows the NP in an oblique (locative) case construction preceding the main copula verb. The predication has two components: a) the speaker has no doubt about what is going on, and b) the person she married has turned out not to be human. Igei references both clauses as sharing the S argument of the copular verb. In this complex construction, the speaker uses the identificational demonstrative twice, because the predication has two components: The first instance of use is in the initial adverbial clause (bracketed), the second is the main existential copular (i-) verb clause with the locative adverbial adjunct. As the demonstrative morpheme is non-animate, but at least the second NP is clearly animate, I interpret igei as a „situational‟ demonstrative:

[afïtï-ku=maki igei] kuge-fïŋï-kai

[denial-INT=EM DEM] person-unlike-beside

igei

u-i-tsa.

DEM-CL 1-EX-CI

„There‟s no doubt at all, that this thing I‟ve come to

live with isn‟t human.

b. Another „situational‟ predication in which a deadverbialized nominalization and a second NP both reference an animate entity. These are linked to each other and to the final copular clause by the situational demonstrative. The de-adverbial nominalization occurs with the class inclusion and negative suffixes on the adverbial atutu, „good‟. (Here the class inclusion copula functions as irrealis, so is glossed IRR). As the demonstrative references the initial NP as the S of the copular verb, it appears to have scope over both NP; however the second NP (efisї, „your younger brother‟) is the head of this construction.

atutu-i-la

igei, e-fisï its-a

good-IRR-NEG IDEM, 2-YBro EX-CI

„This is not a good situation that your younger brother lives in.‟

c. Here, the first clause has a fronted ergative NP that is referenced by the proximate demonstrative as the shared

205

argument of the second de-adverbal nominalization clause (bracketed). There, the argument is S.

i-ñandsu-feke egei e-lu, 3-sister-ERG IDEM anger-PI „It was his sister who was angry with him,

[tї-ko-ti-ñї

ege ñandsu-i].

[REF-anger-Vt-N PDEM sister-CL]

the angry one was one of his sisters.‟

d. This is an example of the identificational demonstrative referencing a shared argument in a complement and subordinate clause. The argument in the main clause is S, but in the subordinate clause it is P. In this complex clause construction, the main „reason‟ complement clause includes the existential copular verb construction in continuous indicative mood. The subordinate clause is marked as such by the anaphoric topic referent in essive nominalization (ule-pe) appearing at the end of the utterance. This subordinate clause (bracketed) includes a fronted NP, the ideophone + local demonstrative + NP; the latter is an P argument. The third person copular verbal argument (elided) is marked by the proximate identificational demonstrative egei as A of the pseudotransitive ideophone tsiuk (referencing the action of the arrow slicing through the head of a fish).

eŋï=tsa≈l≈egei, [ u-fïgi-feke egei tsiuk

reason≈EX=UT≈IDEM 1-arrow-ERG IDEM (sound of slicing

inde ti-tsï-gï

ule-pe]

here REF-head-POSS AFR-SAL

„What was happening was my arrow cut right through its head

here.‟

f. In this interrogative example, the proximate identificational demonstrative egei hosts a class inclusion copula suffix and references the action of the S of the existential copular verb as reflexive:

uwa=su-ki apa-dyu-ko

i-tsa-ko egei-i

Q-PEJ-MIR father-END-PL EX-CL-PL IDEM-CL

„What in the world are our dear fathers doing to themselves?‟

g. An example of a rhetorical question construction with the proximate identificational demonstrative:

ah, tї-n≈egei

u-figї agi-ɳo-pe-i-la

EXP, RQ-CONT-IDEM 1-grandson like-SN-ESS-IRR-NEG

206

„Surely this can‟t be someone like my grandson, can it?‟

h. An example of the indefinite identificational demonstrative segei „once‟, „sometime:

ah u-te-lu

segei tafiɳa-i

EXP 1-go.away-PI IDEM caiman-CL

„Surely I once went away alligatoring‟.

Note: the expression „alligatoring‟ referring to a man going from house to house looking for a lover.

6.5.2 Referencing fronted NP as former S or A of a de-verbal nominalization
In these constructions, the clausal argument has been preserved even though the verb has been nominalized. The identificational demonstrative following the NP seems to be referencing a former S or A clausal argument. a. An infomational question with the equative copular
verb in active verb imperfective aspect nominalization:
uwa igei at-ïfïgï Q IDEM EQ-IMP „How is this being done?
b. With intransitive verb nominalization:
ifaki-la ekugu Aulukuma igei fuɳ-i-nїgї far-NEG fully (name) IDEM breath-Vi-PS „Not much farther on Aulukuma was gasping for breath.‟

6.5.3. Identificational demonstrative follows the semantic or copula verb
The identificational demonstrative also appears in clause final position. As seen in the following examples, a lexical or existential copular root in verbal construction is often followed by the identificational demonstrative (a and b). This may also occur where a NP in a preceding clause is linked to a subsequent verbal predication (as in b).
a. The identificational demonstrative elei,a remote or distal animate referent, is shown here linking the initial NP (in brackets) to the final (bracketed) noun, which is followed by a clear pause (marked with „,‟). Although the speaker pauses, the noun is not really „free floating‟. The entire nominal predication is also linked as S to itsa, the existential copular root in continuous indicative aspect/mood:

207

[aŋi-folo muku-gu-pe] its-a elei, [kaidyë]. original N son-POSS-CL EX-CI IDEM, monkey „The son of an Ancient woman was a monkey.„

b. The following is an example of the use of the identificational demonstrative in two interrogative constructions, where it appears at the end of each construction. A leader calls others out to the plaza and is asked for the reason:

uwa-m≈igei, uwa-ma≈ki-ta igei? Q-EM≈DEM, Q-EM≈2-utter-CI DEM „What‟s this (situation), what are you talking about?‟

c.

Here the identificational demonstrative follows the

copular verb. The copular verb + demonstrative

participates in an auxiliary construction. The utterance

is monoclausal. The copular verb is marked with first

person S and continuous indicative aspect/mood, while

the semantic verb is marked with 1st person plural S and

continuous indicative aspect/mood. (More discussion on

auxiliary constructions is found in the Chapter on

Copularity and the Chapter on complex constructions.)

ah, kup-iñano-ko ku-pulu-nda-ko u-itsa igei EXP, 1+2-OBro-PL 1+2-travel-CI-PL 1-EX DEM-CL „I‟m (in this situation) as our brothers travel around.‟

6.5.4. Identificational demonstratives in other kinds of constructions

a. An verbless rhetorical interrogative example with an identificational demonstrative:

tu-itigi-ma

who-hammock-POSS-EM this

“Whose hammock is this one here?”

b. This is an example of the adverbial+IRM construction distinctive to the identificational demonstrative . igeiku=dya, „just like that but...‟ The interclausal reference marker =dya references argument changes in the subsequent clause.

208

„The result was „the fishy ones‟, just as we call them, took pity on me.‟

. 6.5.5 Identificational demonstratives and comparative constructions

The identificational demonstrative also appears in many comparative constructions. In the following example, the speaker is naming two flutes, as a way of distinguishing them from each other. In (a), the identificational demonstrative is simply linking the name of one of the flutes to the existential copular verb (inflected with the “uninterrupted event” taxis clitic =ale; bearing a name is an active relation, one that will be used „forever‟.) In (b), the first (identificational) demonstrative is not associated with the copular verb. This NP is followed by a second (in brackets), which includes the adnominal demonstrative (fige-i); this second demonstrative links the named second flute to the idea of an older sister. In both lines, the final predicational element is made clear by a pause following the demonstrative. In (b), this is a repetition of the predication at the outset of the declarative.

a.

kagutu≈ts≈al≈igei,

kagutu, Taugi ki-lï

flute≈EX≈UT≈IDEM, kagutu, Taugi utter-PI

b. kuluta-fa igei, [ifasï figei, kuluta ]

younger sister=NO kagutu.

„This is the kagutu, kagutu, Taugi declared. And THIS

is the kuluta, the older sister, kuluta. The younger sister

though is kagutu.‟

6.6 Local adverbial demonstratives
These lexical words are involved in both verbal clauses and in locative NP predications and describe an object‟s relation to another object, from the speaker‟s perspective. The local adverbial demonstrative may be used directly to refer to the person who is being situated. In this regard it is similar to the free personal pronoun.
6.6.1 inde, „location close to speaker‟
a. In this example, the initial adverbial demonstrative modifies an oblique argument of the verb which occurs in clause final positiion (in brackets). The locative demonstrative is a compound of a locative and intensive „manner‟ adverbial suffix (-kugu), followed by the clause chaining IRM clitic mbe (SS)
[ inde-kugu-mbe] t-eŋe-lï-ko mbučina-feke [ ts-apïgï-ko-kai.]

b.

the following is a common way to describe the time of day of an

event being described (with a gesture of the arm extended

upward ):

6.6.2. wende, „location far from speaker‟

„I‟ve decided to keep my seat over there still‟.

6.6.3 ande, ‘location medially near the speaker‟

There is also a present temporal reference, hence the translation „here and now‟.

a.

ande=mak≈a-nïgï

„I‟m wrong, it‟s around here.‟

b. ande la-ikugu itsa=lefa here.now like.that-fully EX-CI=MT „(3p) been like that here and now‟.

c.

„Consider this, now Little Daughter is experiencing it here .‟

6.6.4 unde, ‘location unknown to speaker‟

a.

Locative demonstrative as head of an „unknown‟

complement clause:

iŋko-m≈unde

a-nïgï

unknown-EM-unknown.location EQS-PS

„I don‟t know where it is now‟.

210

b. When occurring in clause initial position (b), the „unknown location‟ demonstrative functions as one of the question words described in Chapter 10: Interrogatives.

unde-ma e-w-ato-go-ko

a-n-ïgï

where-EM 2-1-friend-PAU-PL EQS-PS

„Where is our friend located?‟

6.7 Manner demonstratives
The two manner demonstratives are distinguished deictically. Igea „this way, like this‟ references a proximate manner or situation, while ila „far away‟ references a deictically distant manner.

6.7.1 ila, „distal manner‟

a. la

6.7.2 ig(e,i)a, „proximate manner‟

The proximate manner demonstrative may be translated as, „manner‟, „this way‟, „like this‟. It is always suffixed with the „unique‟ copula suffix –a, which distinguishes it from the identificational demonstrative.

Chapter 7 Verbs and Verbalizations
7. 1. Overview
This chapter deals with Kalapalo verbs and verbalization structures. The preliminary overview discussion includes sections on syntax, grammatical features, and phonology of verb stems. Separate sections concern intransitive and transitive constructions, the issues concerning ergativity, voice, position of constituent segments in the verb phrase and in the verbal clause, valence changing constructions, non-finite constructions, speech act verbs and quotatives, verbs used in temporal deixis predication, and derivational processes.
7.1.1. Syntax
Kalapalo verbs appear in both nominative-accusative and ergativeabsolutive constructions. Nominative-accusative constructions involve a) the imperative and hortative illocutionary forces, b) two valencedecreasing processes (inverse-marking, and object-backgrounding or ‗deergative‘) in which the patient is backgrounded in favor of transitive subject (A) by a prefix on the verb phrase), and c) the use of demonstratives to mark a focalized NP as A when preceding the VP in continuous aspect indicative ergative-absolutive constructions include all other indicative aspects and the irrealis statuses as well as the transitive non-finite thetic construction (the thetic may also occur as intransitive, as described in the preceding chapter.
In Kalapalo, as many as three arguments in one transitive clause can occur. One of these (usually O) is referenced with either a NP preceding the verb, or a pronominal prefix on the verb stem, with the second verbal argument marked as a semantic oblique by one of several possible case markers.
Kalapalo also exhibits split-intransitivity, with a distinction between ‗plain‘ (one argument) and ‗extended‘ intransitive constructions with two arguments. Extended intransitive clauses include the second argument NP in dative/benefactive -iña or instrumental –ki case; this argument NP follows the verb phrase, unlike core O and oblique arguments of transitive verbs, which precede the verbal constituent. Extended intransitives often exhibit prefix diathesis marking of middle voice.
7.1.2. Constituent order
Syntactically, verbal predication is connected to constituent clausal order. The type of alignment constructions in main verb clauses is indicated by 1) phrase order and 2) argument marking. With respect to phrase order, core syntactic relations follow the order SV or OVS.

184
Oblique arguments normally follow the A NP (or the verb phrase in the case of extended intransitives.). When an oblique argument is focalized, it is placed in first position in the clausal word order; otherwise it appears following the O NP. Similarly, focalized A is left-shifted or fronted to create an SOV order. The ergative alignment construction follows an OVS construction, while nominative-accusative follows SOV. With regard to O argument plurality, O agreement marking occurs on the verb phrase with the –ko suffix on the verb phrase in final position. (This is an absolutive, that is, there is identical marking of O and S plurality). Plurality agreement is marked on the syntactic ergative and comitative case suffixes by the suffix -ne(i) (the same suffix occurs with the benefactive/dative case suffix). The instrumental –ki and semantic case markers (mainly different kinds of locatives) do not exhibit plurality.
7.1.3. Grammatical features
There are several degrees of finiteness. In order of finiteness, the list of verb constructions includes: a) fully finite clauses that involve aspectual or irrealis suffixes and core argument marking b) valence decreasing processes involving an unmarked argument (via patient-backgrounding or the ‗de-ergative‘ construction); inverse-marking; and the very rare anti-passive; c) in clause chains, a repeated clause often omits the ergative argument; d) non-finite thetic constructions where verbal aspect or irrealis inflections are absent and there are no A or O prefixed arguments; (if transitive, A is preserved in the clause as a lexical noun phrase if intransitive, there is usually a lexical S noun phrase); e) nonfinite supine purpose of motion constructions with no explicit arguments nor any aspect or irrealis suffixes (these only occur in subordinate clause combinations, described in Chapter 13.4). Both non-finite constructions have distinctive discourse as well as syntactic and grammatical functions.
The three types of illocutionary force in Kalapalo are indicative (unmarked), interrogative (constructed with preposed morphemes), and imperative (marked with a verbal suffix). The indicative may be constructed with several aspectual suffixes, or irrealis suffixes some of which occur only in subordinate clauses. With a limited number of verb stems, resultative aspect in Ø marked. Discussion of the inflectionary force, aspectual, and irrealis inflections is found in section 7.5.6, this chapter, and also (with regard to subordination in Chapter 13: Complex clause constructions. The imperative and interrogative illocutionary types are treated separately in Chapters 9 and 10 respectively.
7.1.4 Phonology of verb stems
My sample of approximately 256 verbal stems used with examples in this grammar show approximately 1.5 times the number of stems beginning with vowels than consonant initial stems. However, of the vowel initial morphemes, an overwhelming number (89 + 1 nasalized of 168) are /i/ initial, with a total of 87 examples showing /a/, /e/ ,/ї/, /o/ or /u/ initial (nasals shown on the table are included in this count). Both

185

vowel initial and consonant initial stems are subject to diathesis marking of middle voice, described in section 7.3.2. Among verbs, /ї/ and /u/ initial stems are very unusual, and their common rarity may have to do with the allophonic character of these two sounds. Despite their phonological rarity, the verbs in question are very commonly used. The following is a list of these stems.

/ї/ initial stems: їɳї-‗sleep‘ їgїɳGu-, ‗feel sick‘

/u/ initial stems: ufi-, ‗look for‘ ui-, ‗make‘ upuGi-, ‗grow body hair, mould‘ umi- ‗tie up‘

7.2 Alignment structures

Kalapalo alignment is complex. There are seven types of main and independent clause constructions distinguished by word order and the treatment of core arguments and prefixed and suffixed inflexions. These alignment types are:

1.

plain intransitive: S marked as full NP, pronoun, or

absolutive prefix (Ø for third person); the verb is inflected

with indicative, irrealis, or imperative inflection. Clausal

constituent order is SV.

2.

extended intransitive: S is treated morphologically as with

the plain intransitive; there is an oblique O marked with

dative/benefactive case (if animate) or instrumental case (if

inanimate); the verb is usually an active motion verb. Verbs

are inflected with an indicative or irrealis aspect/modal suffix;

there may be a goal subordinate clause. Clausal constituent

order is SVO.

3.

transitive with ergative marking of S and absolutive marking

of O; the verb is inflected with an aspect or irrealis suffix.

Constituent order is OV with postposed S. With ditransitives,

S is in ergative case marking, O is a full NP, pronominal

186

prefix, or pronoun, and the oblique argument is marked with a

locative case suffix; the verb is inflected with indicative or

irrealis aspect/modal suffix. The verbal phrase is OV, the

clausal constituent order is OVA. The oblique argument noun

phrase normally follows OVA construction.

4.

transitive with nominative marking of A (pronominal

prefix) and accusative marking of O (full noun phrase);

verb is inflected in imperative illocution. Clausal constituent

order is AOV.

5.

inverse marking: In nominalization structure, the verb is

prefixed by a portmanteau A/O morpheme; the verb is

inflected with an aspect or irrealis suffix; the verb may be in

nominalization derivation with perfective or imperfective

inflection. Clausal constituent order is A/OV

6.

object-backgrounding: the verb stem is prefixed by a

valence-decreasing compound formed from the absolutive

person prefix + the object-backgrounding ñ/ɳ prefix; A is not

included in the verb phrase; there may be a co-occurring full

NP referencing the O; the verb may be a finite construction or

a de-verbal nominalization with a perfective or imperfective

inflection. Phrasal constituent order is OV.

7.

non-finite thetic: t prefixed to the verb stem; one of several

possible suffixes follow the stem; where the verb is

intransitive, there is no S argument marking, but when

transitive the ergative transitive S often occurs in the clause;

but the verb has no aspectual or irrealis inflection nor any

pronominal prefixes . The non-finite thetic may occur as an

independent or main clause.

7.2.1. Plain intransitive

The Kalapalo plain intransitive occurs with a single argument (S) preceding the verb, either as a full NP, or marked by an absolutive person prefix on the verb stem. The verb stem is constructed with a semantic root and an intransitive verb radical. (See Table 26 for intransitive radicals). In (a) the intransitive verb radical is –mbe, appearing on roots expressing ideas of voluntary motion.

S

a. isi

i-ti-mbe-lu

3.mother 3-arrive-Vi-PI

‗3p‘s mother arrived‘

7.2.2 Extended intransitives
These are somewhat less common than plain intransitives. In addition to the intransitive S marked with a full demonstrative pronoun NP or pronominal prefix on the stem (Ø for 3rd person), there is an oblique argument (case marked as such) following the verb phrase. Verbs with this type of construction include: think, stir, tell about/teach, shoot, kill, bring, run, put on, marry, bring, shave, paint, and make (in the sense of

187
‗cut out‘). Many occur as imperatives. Several of these verbs (7.2.2..g,h) show diathesis marking of middle voice, with the prefix et-, or e when the verb stem begins with /t/. Where the argument is human as in examples given in 7.2.2.1, it is marked with –iña,the dative/benefactive case suffix or the ‗target‘ suffix -pe. Where the argument is inanimate as in examples in 7.2.2.2., the instrumental case suffix –ki is used. With intransitive ‗motion‘ verbs, as described in 7.2.2.3, there is often an oblique semantic argument or an adverbial referencing location and direction. Finally there are extended intransitive constructions with subordinate ‗goal‘ clauses whose argument is marked with the ‗target‘ suffix –pe. These are discussed in 7.2.2.4.

7.2.2.1 Animate extended arguments

Animate extended arguments are marked with –iña, the dative/benefactive case suffix. The first three examples (a-c) are in imperative illocution.

a. Ø-iŋu-Gi-ke

tis-iña

3-see.think-cause-I 1+3-DAT/BEN

‗Think on our behalf‘.

b. a-liŋu-tu-ete

a-ko-iŋo-ko-iña

2-stir-DIS-URG 2-companion-POT-PL-DAT/BEN

‗Go ahead and stir it up for both you and your companion.‘

c.

ukw-oto fe-tsa-ŋe-iña

i-fa-ke ukw-oto-iña.

dual-parent DEO-EX-I-DAT/BEN 3-tell-I dual-parent -DAT

‗Our parent has to be told about it, our parent.‘

d. This example is a hortative imperative; the verb has three arguments.

ogi e-ŋe-te u-iña HORT 2>3-bring-I1-DAT ‗You should bring that to me.‘

e. The verb is in continuous indicative (repeated from Chapter 5: 3.2.a.):

teh! tolo ipugu ule nice! bird feather, ATR

ka-gu-nda

fegei Taugi-iña

talk.about-Vt-CI ADEM Taugi-BEN/DAT

‗―How beautiful the cover of bird feathers‖. That‘s what

someone taught Taugi.‘

188

f.

Here the verb is in imperfective potential aspect (Example

repeated from Chapter 5: Nouns 10.2.1.a):

afïtï-fa itau-iña

itsa-ki-lu-iŋo-la

denial-PTP woman-DAT/BEN run-Vi-PI-POT-NEG

‗You won‘t run after a woman.‘

7.2.2.2 Inanimate extended arguments

Inanimate extended arguments are marked with the instrumental case suffix –ki.

a.

uege=kana te-ta-tiga u-fïgi

ï-ki.

you=EM

go.to-CI-HAB 1-arrow bring-IMP

‗If you think you can show yourself, bring some arrows to me.‘

b. Example with a second oblique argument placed at the beginning of the utterance.

t-iña

fi-ti-ñïgï

kefege-ki=mbe=hale

REFL- DAT/BEN blow.on-Vt-TR spell-INST=SS=NO

‗On her behalf it had been blown on with the spell (so that could

happen later).

c.

Oblique argument is human:

is-atu-nda=lefa

itau≈gu-pe-ki

3→3-marry-CI=MT woman-POSS-SAL-INST

‗He married one of his own women.‘

d.

kukw-efu-ki

ŋu-ndï-ŋi-fofo

1+2>1+2-canoe-INST make-Vt-I=IM

‗We should make canoes for ourselves right away.‘

e. lepe

uwã-ki=lefa ete-lï.

next enclosure-INST=MT go.away-PI

‗Then he went away for the enclosure.‘

f.

Repeated from Chapter 3: 4.5.3.b:

tamitsi-la=gele

agi-ke-nïgï=lefa

long.time-NEG=PT cut.hair-Vt.of-PS=MT

feŋi-ki=dye≈tsa scissors-INST=SA≈EX;CL ‗Still not very long after, her hair was cut with a cutting tool. ‗

g. This example is a marked exception as the extended argument of the verb ‗marry‘ is clearly human. This may be an exceptional example of an antipassive, apparently very rare in Kalapalo.

189
Insofar as anti-passives involve shifting a structural argument O to an oblique argument, I treat this extremely rare instance as an example of this type of valence-decreasing construction. This does not involve a reflexive morpheme, as in Dixon‘s ‗canonical antipassive‘ (Dixon, 1994: 164), but rather the co-referential 3p is- prefix on the verb. O is seemingly treated as an oblique argument with the instrumental (–ki) case marking. The semantic effect is to focus upon the event itself, not P. Thus the woman mentioned is treated as a peripheral participant in the event, with the focus upon the event itself. I have only found one example of this kind of construction in my data. (Franchetto 1990 also confirms the rarity of this form in her own Kufikugu data.)
is-atu-nda=lefa itau≈gu-pe-ki 3>3-marry-CI=MT woman-POSS-SAL-INST ‗He married one of his own women.‘

7.2.2.3 Motion verbs with oblique arguments

Motion verbs with oblique arguments are interesting because the oblique arguments are directional or locational places.

a.

Here the oblique is an adverbial construction, ‗on the way (path)

down to the water‘. Note the use of the special directional –ka

used for water:

fotugu-i=lefa iñ-їɳgo=lefa

tuwa-ka

first-CL=MT arrive-POT=MT water-to

ga-tu-nda-ti. downwards-N-CI- ADV ‗He intended to be the first one to arrive on the path down to the water.‘

b. In this example there is an allative marked NP, ‗towards Kutsu‘:

pupupupupu,

ete-lї-mbe,

(sound of paddling) go-away-PI-SS,

at-ake-i-lї=lefa. MV-curve.around-EP-CI=MT,

atake-i-lї=lefa,

kutsu-na..

MV-curve.around-EP-PI=MT, Kutsu-ALL

‗Paddling fast, he went away after that, curving around (the bend

in the river,) curving around (the bend in the river), towards

Kutsu.‘

190

7.3 Transitive constructions

Kalapalo transitive constructions include nominative-accusative and ergative-absolutive constructions. Most Kalapalo transitive verb stems are constructed with a transitivizing marking radical (sometimes this is Ø marked). Reflexivity on transitive verbs is marked by the reflexive prefix t(ї). This section illustrates the different types of alignment in transitive main clauses. Word orders associated with indicative, interrogative, and focalized S are included.

7.3.1. Ergative-absolutive constructions: general features

The ergative-absolutive is generally seen with all persons in A and P, and in all illocutionary types except the imperative. O is marked on the stem with a person prefix or by the full NP placed before the verb phrase. The following are characteristic of these constructions:
1) the person prefix on the verb stem marks O (Ø for 3rd person; reflexive for anaphoric argument) 2) the person prefix on the ergative post position marks S 3) Plurality agreement of O on the verb phrase is the absolutive –ko; plurality agreement on S is the ergative –ni/ne 4) the word order is OVS unless, as in (e), the S noun phrase is fronted for emphasis The ergative construction does not always reference active agency. In some cases, the ergative case is hosted by an inanimate or geographic setting NP. This may be interpreted as a ‗causal‘ use of the ergative in Kalapalo, but as will be seen ‗causality‘ itself may express different kinds of events involving A and P.

7.3.1.1 A as active agent

The agents in examples (a) and (b) are presented in boldface. Examples in singular A bearing ergative case marker:

a.

ta-t-e-ŋa-lu-ko

u-feke

CONT-REF-shoot-Vt-PI-PL 1-ERG

‗I won‘t kill any of them‘

b. lepe okoge-funda Ø-iki-dyu-fa

i-feke.

next next.day-ADV 3-cook.flatbread-PI-PTP 3-ERG

‗So the next day she made some flatbread.‘

(c) shows an example with plural 3 person plural A with ergative case marker:

c. iño-go-te-ga

i-feke-ni=lefa

skewer-PAU-Vt-CI 3-ERG-PL-MT

‗They skewered a few pieces, one by one.‘

191

Examples (d) and (e) show A as full NP, bearing ergative case marker:

d.

te-ŋe-ta=mukwe

is-uwï-feke=lefa.

eat.flesh-Vt-CI=EM 3.father-ERG=MT

‗3p father was nibbling at it.‘

e. A NP with ergative case marker fronted for emphasis:

isi-feke i:ña

nde-ta=lefa.

3;mo-ERG 3-DAT/BEN prepare.flatbread-CI=MT

‗It was her mother who made flatbread for her, piece by piece.‘

‗When that was done after a while she touched it from time to time to see if the griddle was heating up.‘

The following examples show anticipated/inchoative irrealis (ANT), ‗about to‘.

f.

Inflection is on the active equative copular root:

inde uagiɳo=mukwe at-ani here 1-resemble-N=EM EQA-ANT ‗In vain he would be like me.‘

g. Inflection is on an active intransitive verb:

lepene u-te-tani

kïŋamukwe

afterwards 1-go.away-ANT children

‗Afterwards, ―I‘m leaving Children‖.‘

h. Inflection on an active transitive verb:

lepe ku-ñi-tani i ŋi-l≈i-feke-ni. next 1+2=see-ANT 3-PB-PI≈ERG-PL ‗Next, ―Let‘s go look‖, and they saw him‘.

i.

Ergative-absolutive constructions with interrogative, 2nd person

plural A (not plural suffix follows the ergative):

.

aŋi-nika inde u-oku-ŋgi-ta

i-ŋi-lï e-feke-ni?

EQ-EM here 1-liquid.food-prepare-CI 3-see-PI 2-ERG-PL?

‗Could it be that you all have seen those who make my drinks

around here?‘

j

Another interrrogative ergative-absolutive example with 1st

person plural ergative:

uwa-ma-laka

t-ïi-lï

kupehe-ne

what-FACS-EM REF-do-PI 1+2.ERG-PL

‗What in the world can we do with (it)?‘

192

7.3.1.2 Ergativity and causation

In cases where the ergative marks clearly non-animate arguments of transitive verbs, the ergative morpheme seems (for semantic reasons) to reference causation. In some cases the cause is in some way active (a). However, (b), (c) and (d) express the idea of A influencing the action of P in some direct, causal manner. None of the verbs are constructed with causal suffixes on the stems.

a.

mbučina-feke teŋe-ta-ko

ts-apï-gï-ko.

boots-ERG eat.flesh-CI-PL 3p-feet-POSS-PL

‗The boots were tearing at their feet.‘

b. ifïgi-feke=ŋapa ta-fi-ta,

Ø-nïg=i-feke.

arrow-ERG=EM burdened-Vt-CI, say to-PERF=3-ERG

―Probably caused by the arrows being so heavy,‖ he answered.

c.

This example is taken from a story about canoes with a slippery

substance inside that makes the owners slip and fall down.

is-ama-ki-ta-ko figei efu-feke,

[ñ-efu-gu-ko]

3p-fall-Vt-CI-PL IDEM canoe-ERG, PB-canoe-POSS-PL

―Their canoes making them fall down like that, their own

canoes‖

d. Here, the speaker states that the lack of his food is what makes him hungry, even if there is something else available. Metaphorically, A (absence of food) is ‗shooting‘ or ‗killing‘ P.

igei-fuŋ≈ata-lї-a

fegei

IDEM-unlike≈EQA-CI-U ADEM

ŋiko-mbogu-feke u-e-ŋalu.

food-W-ERG

I-feel-PR

―When there‘s something different from this very thing, the lack

of food makes me hungry.‘

e. In this example, the ergatively marked subject in lines ii and iii is soup (in iii referred to as ‗liquid food‘), which has caused the drinker (who previously was afraid of it) to be pleased.

i. [kuigiku etu-ki-lï]

[li-tsa≈le-t≈i-feke-ne].

hot.soup finished/ready-Vi-PI drink-CI≈MT-DES≈3-ERG-PL

‗When the hot soup was ready, one by one they all sought to

drink some.

ii. [i-fe-ki-pïgï=mbedya-fa i-feke=lefa.] 3-nice-like-VPE=SDO-PTP 3-ERG=MT ‗It was something that pleased him (when he drank it)‘.

193

iii. ku-m-iñaŋo-feke=mbe,

uŋele-feke ki-pïgï,

1+2-C-liquid.food ERG-SS, ANA-ERG like-VPE,

iñaŋo-feke, Afanda iñaŋo-feke. liquid.food-ERG, Afanda liquid.food-ERG ‗(When he drank) our liquid food, that was what pleased him, the liquid food, Afanda‘s liquid food‘.

7.3.1.3 Ergativity on locative or directional noun phrases

In several examples the ergative suffix appears to mark S on a NP that is not an active agent, but some kind of locational or directional feature.This interesting use of the ergative occurs with both active and stative verbs. More data are needed to construct a clear explanation of this usage.

a.. In this example, the ergative-hosting deictic noun uña ‗outside the house‘ complements the noun ‗last one of them‘. The ergative case marker on the deictic noun ‗outside‘ marks that noun as a verbal argument; it is also a complement of the noun upїgї-ko, ‗the last one of them‘.

tok tok,

ifakila kugu=lefa

(sound of shooting arrows), far-NEG fully=MT

uña-feke

upïgï-ko

outside-ERG last.one-PS- PL

‗Tok tok, shooting not at all far from him, the last of them, just

outside the house‘

b. In this example, the middle voice diathesis marker e- appears on the intransitive consonant-initial verb te-,‗go away‘. Second, the river name Taɳgugu is followed by the ergative feke. While the river is a directional semantic argument of the verb, the question is why the allative –na is not used. The only explanation can be that the river has been an influence (a kind of cause, perhaps) that diverted the travellers (who had no canoe) into unknown territory, where they disappeared.

ɳiko-munde=ɳapa-fa

Taɳgugu-feke e-te-lї-ko.

unknown-where=EM-PTP Taɳgugu-ERG MV-go.away-PI-PL

‗I don‘t know where but maybe they were made to go that way

by the Taɳgugu.‗

c. In this example, the ergative suffix is hosted by a non-animate NP. The NP ‗on the path‘ is clearly a spatial deictic with a causal function, complementing the noun ‗father‘; the main verb is nominalized with the VPE (voluntary process resultative) suffix.

194

igea=lefa

ifaki-la aña-feke isuwï

this.way=MT far-NEG path-ERG 3;father

i-dya-te-pïgï 3-tie.hammock-Vt-VPE ‗And this way, not far from the path where her father‘s hammock was hung‘.

7.3.1.4 Marking interloctutors in speech act verb constructions with the ergative suffix

While I use the syntactic symbol A to reference a transitive subject NP marked with the ergative case, there are numerous examples in which the NP is semantically an interlocutor in a speech act verb construction. In this section I present different kinds of these uses of the ergative morpheme. These data support Franchetto‘s recent analysis of the Kuikuro ergative as ‗not syntactic‘ and referencing ‗cause‘. (2010). A polysemous interpretation of –feke seems justified by the Kalapalo data.
Seeming O arguments take the ergative with numerous quotatives and even when speech act verbs are not actually present, as ―grieve for‖, ―get fed up with‖, and example (c) ―discuss‖, ―try to figure out why‖ etc.:

a. kogetsi=gele fu-ni-ta=mbedya i-feke tï-ño-feke. next.day=PT miss-Vt-CI=PXA 3-ERG REFL-husband-ERG ‗And still on the next day, she grieved for him, for her husband.‘

b. With the simple quotatives:

uum, ah, Ø-nïg=i-feke,

oto-ke-fofo, oto-ke-fofo,

EM, EXP, 3-PS=3-ERG, smoke-I-IM, smoke-I-IM,

Iɳgeu-feke Iɳgeu-ERG ‗ ―I‘m thinking, certainly‖, she said to him, ―you must smoke it right now, smoke it right now‖, to Iɳgeu.‘

u-ige-lї ake-tsa-ɳe igei, ah Ø-nїgї t-ufitsu-feke 1-take-PI DEO-EX-I IDEM, EXP 3-PS REF-wife-ERG ― ‗I must take this one!‘ surely, he said that to his wife.‖

7.3.1.5 Comparison of different types of ergative-absolutive constructions
The following examples illustrate different types of constructions involving the same transitive verb iGiku-, ‗envy.‘ I have presented the examples in order of their appearance in a narrative. First, the verb in continuous indicative aspect and its arguments are presented, with the verb phrase topicalized (a). Then one of the arguments is foregrounded

195

(b). Following that, the root is used in a causal construction with a change of radical to signal a detrimental action (c). Later, the same verb appears with the agentive NP focalized (d), and right after that, in a ‗rhetorical question‘ with reversative aspect (e). Finally, the verb appears in the narrative conclusion, where it becomes nominalized as a usitative construction, in a reprise of the main situation in the story (f).

a. First, the VP is fronted because of a topicality shift. The shift of topic itself is indicated by initating the clause with the anaphoric topic referent ule, together with the ‗new and overlapping‘ taxis clitic =fale. O (a complex situation described in much detail in the immediately preceding segment of the narrative) is made explicit here through the adnominal demonstrative fegei, while the ergative marked S NP is in final clause position.

ule igiku-ni-ta=fale fegei Taugi-feke ATR envy-Vt-CI=NT ADEM Taugi-ERG ‗Because of all that, now Taugi is being made to envy him‘.

b. The speaker then foregrounds S by shifting the S NP ahead of the VP:

Taugi-feke iGiku-ni-ta. Taugi-ERG envy-Vt-CI ‗Taugi being made to envy him‘.

c.

A subsequent utterance presents the verb in a causal construction

followed by the existential copular verb in continuous indicative

aspect. The verb radical changes from -ni (used with stative

verbs) to -nu (referencing a detrimental action) followed by the

valence-increasing causal morpheme -ki:

iGiku-nu-ki≈tsa

fegei i-feke.

envy-Vt-CAUS ≈EX;CI ADEM 3-ERG

‗He was in a state of being made envious of that‘.

d. Here, the object of envy is directly spoken to and, by means of the epistemic clitic =kafa, is asked to agree with the speaker. The verb root encorporates the second person prefix e-, changing the meaning slightly from ‗envy‘ to ‗envy you‘.

efiñano-feke=kafa fegei e-Giku-ni-ta,

efiñano-feke.

OBr-ERG=EM ADEM you-envy-Vt-CI, Obr-ERG

‗It‘s you isn‘t it whom your older brother envies that (thing).‘

d. Here is the verb in reversative part of a rhetorical question construction.

tï-tomi-n ≈egei

efiñano-ko iGiku-ni-nalï

RQ-PER-CONT≈ADEM Obro-PL envy-Vt-REV

196

efeke-ni?, Kwatïŋï ki-lï 2-ERG-PL, Kwatïŋï utter-PI ―Is there some reason why you all made your older brother (feel) envy again (lit, ‗re-envy‘)?‖ Kwatïŋï asked.

e. In a characteristic means of ending a narrative, the story-teller once again reprises the main situation. The verb is now in a usitative nominalization (USIN); the S NP is no longer present, and O is referenced by the adnominal demonstrative preceding the de-verbal nominalization:

its-olo-gu

fegei iGiku-ni-ta-tofo-i,

its-olo-gu.

3-pet-POSS ADEM envy-Vt-CI-USIN-CL, 3-pet-POSS.

‗Hisi pet was what was making himj envious, that pet of

hisi

7.3.2 Nominative-accusative constructions
These are two argument constructions. Three argument constructions are always ergative-absolutive. Here I discuss the constructions with both arguments presented; other nominative-accusative constructions are the two valence-decreasing constructions disucssed in 7.3.4 (inversemarking) and 7.3.5 (object-backgrounding).
- Word order is (S)OV. S is either a pronominal demonstrative, a full NP, or a personal prefix on the verb, but like O, there is no case marking unless S is a comitative subject. In some constructions, there is no explicit S.
- Where O is a NP, there is a coreferential pronominal prefix ison the verb (Ø otherwise for 3p).
- Where S is plural, the absolutive –ko suffix is used.

a.

Here S is a nominalized verb (‗filler‘, bracketed) that is

subordinate to the intransitive clause te-ga-ni, ‗about to go away

to do X‘. One could also interpret this construction as a de-

verbal nominal that is re-verbalized as an imperfective

intransitive active verb through the –te verbal radical (‗voluntary

7.3.3 Ditransitive Verbs.
Three arguments are possible with Kalapalo verbs. With some verbs, the presence of a third argument involves ‗rearranging‘ the syntax of the arguments so they appear differently from those in other transitive constructions. Ditransitive verbs code two objects, one as theme (T), marked either with a zero-marked person marking prefix on the verb stem or as full NP suffixed with -pe, and the other as recipient (R) or goal (with –iña). In these constructions, the human recipient argument is marked with the dative case suffix –iña or if the theme is plural, the recipient argument is marked with the comitative case suffix –ake (7.3.2.1). If the recipient NP is inanimate, it is marked with the instrumental suffix –ki; no plural is possible with this case morpheme. The transitive S verbal argument receives ergative case marking. These

198
features of Kalapalo ditransitivity suggest the language is an example of what Haspelmath (2005) calls ―indirective‖ ditransitive marking.
In Kalapalo, it is possible as well to have causative constructions not only on regular transitives (as described above) but also on ditransitives (these are described later in this chapter in 7.6, Valence changing operations)
The following are examples of the ditransitive verbs ‗give‘, ‗blow on‘, ‗take‘, ‗carry away‘, ‗bring‘, ‗steal, abduct‘, and ‗eat‘.

a.

tu-, ‘give‗: The verb in a) is in voluntary action resultative aspect

nominalization. The DOtheme is in absolutive case, the oblique

object recipient in dative case, the plural A in ergative case.

(Same example 5,1,2,(h):

shell.belt, parrot.feather headdress, toucan.feather. ornament.

‗They gave the payment to their mother: shell belts, parrot

feather headdresses, toucan feather ornaments.‘

b. Here the verb fiti- ‗blow‘ has a co-referential reflexive t-prefix on the noun-incorporated verb, and postposed A (with ergative case marker). The recipient is inanimte, thus marked with the instrumental case operator -ki.

c.

In this example, the ditransitive verb –tun(ŋ) ‘give, share‘ is

constructed in consequential nominalization (-nїmi). Note that

despite the nominalization, the verbal

arguments are

preserved.

fïgey-ki arrow-INST ―It is our older relative who is taking me away (in this situation) to get arrows.‖

h. iŋi-‗bring‘: Here the verb is derived as a perfective nominal, with the pronominal demonstrative uege, ‗you‘ as the relative complement to the de-verbal noun. There is another oblique argument in semantic locative case:

kuaku iŋi-tïfïgï=nika-fa

nightjar bring-IMP=EM-PTP you, water-into

‗You, the Nightjar brought person aren‘t you, into the water.

‗You‘re the person the Nighjars brought into the water.‘

i.

ife, ‗steal‘, ‗abduct‘. This is a nominative-accusative construction

as P is first person (exclusive plural). The thematic target is

marked with –pe. there is also an oblique arguemnt marked with

–ki (INST). (same example as 5.2.1.4 (2a)).

7.3.4 The inverse-marking constructions

In this alignment construction, inverse marking occurs with a portmanteau prefix marking S > O relationship. This reflects a person hierarchy from which S is ―hidden‖ in relation to O as follows

1, 2>3

1+2, 1+3>1, 2,3

As 1st and 2nd persons are higher than 3rd persons, they are normally marked higher than any 3rd person, both as S and O. However in PB valence-decreasing nominative-accusatives, 1st person singular O is not marked; see example 2.4.4. When 1st or 2nd persons interact with each other, the accusative O is marked by the relevant person morpheme; 1st person is marked ahead of 2nd person S. For 3rd person S acting on 1 or 2, 1 or 2 pronominals are used even though they are O. Normally 3rd person O is marked Ø, but 3rd person S acting on 3O is marked is- or
its- in nominative-accusative clauses; with the OB construction
(discussed in section ) the affix appears as –nz-/-ns-. Finally, plural
inclusive and exclusive ‗we‘ have precedence over 1 and 2 (as well as 3)
singular. Table 26 summarizes these processes.

7.3.5 The object-backgrounding construction

The object-backgrounding construction uses a prefixed compound (OB) that consists of an inflectional pronominal prefix marking S (Ø for third person) and a semantically empty derivational velar nasal prefix which co-references an unnamed patient. By means of this 2-feature compound, a 2-argument ergative-absolutive clause ‗conceals‘ the O argument and there is no longer an S marked with the ergative case suffix. Franchetto (1990) has referred to this as a ‗de-ergative‘. While both arguments are still referenced, the process is valence-decreasing insofar as the O is

203

backgrounded and only marked by the person prefix in the prefix compound. The use of this compound seems important when S is hierarchically lower than O, and also when the speaker wishes to emphasize S. The semantic result is to make O an unspecified element in the description of the event.
The object-backgrounding compound is placed in the absolutive position. This occurs before the verb stem, which may be nominalized. There are several phonological variants: ŋ-, ñ-, and ns/nz (which appear where 3rd person O occurs with 3p A). The pronominal prefixes used with this prefix are all members of the transitive paradigm. To review, these are:

1st person

u-

1+2 inclusive

ku-

1st person 1+3 exclusive

tis-

2nd person

e-

3rd person

Ø

The expected 1p singular pronominal prefix u- does not appear with the patient-backgrounding prefix, even where the context indicates 1st person A (see example 4.2.1.d). More examples are needed to determine if it has been elided as interpreted for this example. Other than the absent u-, these pronominal prefixs are the usual prefix forms for S person marking in absolutive case (Ø), and on ergative (-feke), dative/benefactive (-iña), and comitative (-ake) case suffixes; they appear as well when needed to mark the possessor of possessed nominals.
With regard to the object-backgrounding construction, the agency hierarchy (powerful beings> human beings> living things> inanimates; plural 1>singular 1/2; 1/2>3) influences use of this compound in relation to O reference. If S in the immediately preceding clause, or the main clause, is lower on the hierarchy, O is referenced only by the prefix. If S is higher, O may be optionally referenced explicitly as NP as well as by the prefix; with two arguments at the same hierarchic level, explicit NP reference is optional.
As a compound form that is prefixed to the verb stem, the process is syntactially somewhat similar to the reflexive construction with t- described in section 4.2.2, insofar as the transitive construction is preserved but diminished by O not being made explicit. The co-referent does not appear with ergative marking, nor is there oblique marking of any other participant. When O is plural it is also co-referenced by the absolutive plural suffix –ko (this contrasts with the ergative plural suffix -ni/ne).
The object-backgrounding compound can appear on independent clause verbs, subordinate verbs, de-verbal relative clause nominals, or adverbials. In (a) (same example Chapter 5: 1.3.2b) the OB clause precedes a nominative clause in the chain. While there is no overtly expressed S, it is referenced by the proximate adnominal demonstrative fegei. As in this example the use of this compound seems important when S is hierarchically lower than O, and also when the speaker wishes to emphasize S.

‗Then it began to grow mould. Finally, mould was growing on

In (b) (same example Chapter 5: 8.2.15.c) the object-backgrounding
compound (1+2-n) co-references the possessors in the relative clause
(bracketed) and the unnamed A referenced by the proximate adnominal
demonstrative fegei. The plural possessors function in the recipient role in the action so the 1st and 2nd person plural prefix precedes n- on the verb. As this 3rd person singular S is lower on the hierarchy, reference to
S is only made through the n- affix.

‗These things of ours were the result of his paying us one by

The example in (c) is a complex construction in which the speaker at first uses the adnominal inanimate, situational demonstrative figei to reference S (efu, ‗canoes‘), which he makes explicit with the postposed ergative NP construction in the verb clause. But then in what seems to be a relative clause, the speaker uses the object-backgrounding construction. Again, slippery canoes are S in this relative clause (in brackets) as a possessed noun (―their canoe on them‖). In the relative clause, the 3rd person possessor O marked by ñ- is also pluralized and thereby co-referenced with the –ko absolutive suffix on the initial VP, as well as the co-referencing prefix on the final non-verbal clause. Because (in the main clause) S (canoes) is hierarchically lower that O (the powerful beings, who are being acted upon by the canoes) O is only referenced as ñ-. S has lost the ergative case marker in the final clause and appears as S in absolutive position (Ø- prefix because O is 3rd person). Note also the valence-increasing causative verb stem and use of ergative case marker –feke on the postposed NP in main clause. Having clearly specified the inanimate canoe as a causative S, the speaker then decreases valency by omitting O (the powerful beings) and focusing upon S (the canoes).

Example (d) shows the compound e+ŋ- on the copularized nominal derivation from the verb (ili- ―drink‖.) A appears as S with second person singular pronominal prefix e- preceding the co-referencing affix.

205

However, as S is hierarchically higher than P, the latter are made explicit (for pragmatic reasons) with NPs.

for you?‘

Example (e) shows the Ø-ŋ- compound on the verb in imperfective inchoative aspect (normally absolutive). S and P are hierarchically equivalent, so P is explicit. 1p prefix (u-) is most likely elided due to the final /u/ on the preceding word.

This example shows the 1+2- ñ- compound on the verb also in

anticipation aspect. The 3rd person P and 1+2 S are hierarchically

Kalapalo non-finite constructions are defined by the absence of the usual verbal inflections and argument complements. Neither pronominal prefixes nor verbal aspect or irrealis inflectional suffixes appear on the stem. Lexical argument NPs (S, A, O and oblique O) are preserved in

208
the clause. In this regard Kalapalo non-finite constructions behave similarly to the nominalized de-verbal derivational constructions in which the nominalizations (which reference the O arguments of the original verb) show verbal S or A arguments in the clause. There are two types of non-finite clausal constructions:
-supine participle clauses, transitive clauses subordinate to voluntary intransitive action clauses. Thease are constructed with a special supine suffix, and only occur in third person.
-thetic clauses. Depending on transitivity, S, A and O are included in the clause as lexical NPs.
In this section I discuss the thetic construction, as the supine is only found in subordinate clauses; it is described in detail in the section on subordination in Chapter 13, Complex Clause Constructions.
As noted by Eithne Carlin and Sergio Meira, characteristic of Northern Carib languages are certain non-finite verbs in thetic construction, where a semantically bleached reflexive prefix t- is followed by the verb stem, ending with –i or other allophonic suffixes (2004:485). Thetic constructions seemingly cognate to those in the Trio and Tiriyo languages occur in Kalapalo.
In Kalapalo, thetic intransitive constructions show no S argument as a pronominal prefix. There is only a semantically bleached t-prefix. Immediately following the verb stem is a noticable absence of any aspect or irrealis suffix. Instead is found a ‗thetic‘ suffix (glossed TH).
Kalapalo thetic constructions have the following possible forms:
1) t-√ -ti (where the stem ends in a consonant); 2) t-√ -te (where the stem ends in a vowel); and 3) t-√ -Ø (where the stem ends in /a/ or /i/ ).
The Kalapalo thetic verb is non-finite insofar as there is no marking of arguments on the verb phrase nor any aspect or irrealis suffix. However, where the verbal construction is ergative-absolutive the ergative case S NP is preserved (as in examples 7.3.6c, line iii; and 7.3.6.3a). S in intransitive constructions also may appear as a full NP. In the examples, the thetic is shown in boldface.
a.. t-√ -i.
This example involves the verb tit- ‗touch‘. A finite version of the verb is shown in (a).
a. i-tita i-feke 3- touch 3-ERG ‗He touched her.‘
Example (b) shows a thetic construction of the same verb:

209

b. wagiti t-it-i

tu-eu-ki

matrincha REF-touch-TH REF-tail-INST

‗The matrincha fish touched it with its tail‘.

b. t-√- te. In this example the thetic clause is a main clause followed by an oblique (allative) argument:

t-u-te

tu-nago-kuGi-na

T-come,to-TH REF-them-people-ALL

‗came towards his own people‘

c. t-√-Ø. The zero morpheme on the thetic consruction is distinguished from the Ø resultative verbal suffix by the presence of the t- prefix. I have no examples of a resultative aspectual inflection with this prefix on the verb stem. (see 7. 5.7.3 for discussion of the finite resultative)

i.

Afuseti-pe t-imbi-Ø

Afuseti-SAL REF-steal-TH

‗Afuseti is the one who has been stolen‘.

one-only agouti REF-flee-TH leg-between

t-atsaku-Ø. REF-run.away- Ø. ‗Only one agouti escaped by running between his legs.‘

iii. tuwa-ti t-apa-Ø water-EV REF-spread.apart-TH 3-ERG

i-feke,

toh, tiki tiki

(sound of emergence), (sounds of 2 arrivals)

‗He spread apart the water and toh, tiki tiki, they emerged and

arrived (at a place on land).‘

iv. afi-kuegї mugu-pe tu-e-Ø

i-feke

dogfish-AUG son-SAL REF-shoot-RES 3-ERG

‗He shot Dogfish‘s son.‘

7.3.6.3 Verbal arguments and thetic constructions

The thetic transitive verb may occur with the transitive subject (A) ergatively marked NP preserved in the usual postposed position in the clause:

a.

lepene t-iŋi-Ø≈feke

Taugi-feke.

afterwards REF-see-TH≈ERG Taugi-ERG

210 ‗Afterwards he, Taugi noticed it.‘

b. tĩ-teñiñĩ-gĩ

t-agi-Ø i-feke

REFL-tobacco-POSS REF-throw-TH 3-ERG

‗He threw himself (i.e., travelled on) his own tobacco smoke;

(his own tobacco, he threw himself).‘

7.3,6,4, Thetic constructions and repetition in discourse

Some speakers follow their use of a thetic construction with a repetition of the description using finite constructions. The following are two examples of this practice. In each example, line c contains the finite verb, which is followed by the adnominal demonstrative, apparently functioning to highlight the action.

1. Context: In a story, line (a) sets the scene in which a man is about to speak shamefully to his mother-in-law. Line (b) contains the thetic construction, line c the fully finite ergative verb construction.

a.

ifaki=dyeta=fale ah te-pïgï

ata-ni

far=SO=NT

EXP go.away-VPE EQA-ANT

‗Their having gone on further that way,

b. tufïgi

t-iŋi-Ø≈feke

REF-penis REF-see-TH≈ERG

he looked at his penis.‘

c.

tu-fïgi

iŋi-lï

fegei i-feke

REF-penis 3-see-PI ADEM 3-ERG

‗He looked at his penis. ‗

2. Context: Trickster uses a string tied onto King Vulture‘s leg to be able to reach his location in the sky:

a. lepene etiñï tï-ilu

i-feke Taugi-feke.

afterwards string tie.on-PI 3-ERG Taugi-ERG

‗Afterwards he Taugi tied on a string,

tiñi te-lu- lefa.

string go.away-PI-MT

and the string went away.

b. ule-pe-kai

tu-te-Ø

Taugi te-lï fegei.

ATR-SAL-DEST REF-go.away-TH Taugi go.away-PI ADEM

While (holding) onto that he went away, Taugi went away that

way .‘

211

3. In the last example, both the thetic and supine constructions appear in the same complex clause. The verb t-e-ti, ―go towards, within view of someone‖ is very unusual in Kalapalo insofar as it only seems to be inflected in a non-finite construction.

te-ti

u-et-igi,

come.within.sight-TH 1-come.to.get-DES-ADV

―Coming into sight to get me.‖

7.3.6.5 Thetic constructions and clause chaining

Certain types of verbs may occur as thetic constructions in complex clause constructions, including clause chaining with switch-referencing.

a.

This example shows a simple construction involving two chained

clauses.

lepene sïŋï-lu tilako lepene afterwards sleep-PI three afterwards

t-iŋi-Ø-feke-ni,

teh,

atïtï-i-lefa

REF-see-TH-ERG-PL, INTER, nice-CL-MT

intsene. fermented.piqui ‗After three days had passed, then they looked at it, and it was something very nice, fermented piqui.‘

b. Here is an example of a thetic clause with the verb in the same construction, occuring in a clause chain. The thetic clause is the main clause in a complex marking clause, where the subordinate clause is only marked with the ‗same arguments‘ inter-clausal reference marker mbe (SS). followed by the final, controlling clause. (clause chaining is described in more detail in chapter 14.)

lepene ito-mbe t-ẽt-i, following that fire-SS go.away-TH,

apu-ŋu-lefa die-Vi-PL ‗Afterwards when they did that the fire went away, and so (3p) died.‘

7.3.6.6 Discourse functions of thetic constructions
As we see in the examples above, in thetic non-finite constructions, the verb does not carry any argument, except for the ergative A NP where the verb is transitive. No aspect morphology occurs. It is the event itself which is ‗thematic‘. As in other languages, the Kalapalo thetic

212

construction has a ‗descriptive‘ function which must be understood from a discourse point of view. Kalapalo thetic constructions have typologically interesting functions in narratives, where they typically occur as descriptions of accidential or surprising events, often ending such episodes. Often thetic statements occur in connection with the narrator‘s description of the consequence of preceding events. The Kalapalo thetic construction typically occurs at the end of an episodic chain, when the narrator makes reference to an unexpected or nonpresupposed thematic event, often involving an object that is accidentially or involuntarily involved in the scene. Kalapalo thetic constructions, which are both transitive and intransitive, thus involve foregrounding or topicalizing an event. This functions much like Sasse‘s description of the thetic: ‗a new situation is presented as a whole‘. (2006: 256). In this regard there is remarkable similarity to the discourse functions of thetic constructions in Indo-European languages.
Thetic constructions often appear at the end of episodic clause chains, in which a surprising or unexpected conclusion occurs. (See text 1, line 7). Another way to end episodes is with the expression, ‗laitsani‘, but this implies an intentional result, not something accidential or surprising. (An example is 3.2.h in Chapter 13: Grammar and Discourse). There is no aspect suffixing as would occur in finite constructions, and the subject or object is only represented by a 'bleached' use of the reflexive. The following lines show the placing of thetic constructions (boldfaced) in clausal chaining.

a.

ŋike-fa u-iŋi-nu e-feke api,

7.4. Voice
Kalapalo features four voices: active, reflexive, middle, and the very rare antipassive. Active voice is marked with S prefix on the intransitive verb stem or marked with the ergative case marker in a post-posed construction following the transitive verb phrase. The reflexive voice is marked by the prefix t (ї) (u)-. The middle voice is marked on extended intransitives by one of several possible diathesis prefixes on the verb stem according to the initial vowel or consonant. In this section I review the reflexive, middle voice and antipassive constructions.

7.4.1 Reflexivity
Reflexivity on transitive verbs and NPs is marked by the reflexive prefix t(ї,u). This prefix has three distinct functions: It has a reflexive coreferential function on both nominal and verbal phrases. Without coreferential meaning it contributes to the non-finite thetic verb construction, and also appears on certain adverbializations. In this section, I review the co-referential and adverbial uses of the reflexive prefix, omitting the thetic contructions as the reflexive is bleached of its semantic function in those cases. More data on the thetic constructions appears later in this chapter, and the t-prefixed adverbials without apparent reflexive meaning are discussed also in Chapter 11.

7.4.1.1. Co-referential reflexivity
As seen in these examples, the prefix can appear on noun incorporated verb phrases, de-verbal adverbial clauses; and verbal clauses.
a. This example shows the tu- prefix on a noun with adverbial adjunct (foka). The co-referenced arguments are A, possessor of the arrows, and P, person who is about to be shot.

214

tu-fїgi foka

tu-fet-omi≈feke.

REF-arrow set.in.bow REF-shoot-PURP≈ERG

‗His own arrow set in the bow in order to shoot him.‘

b. Here the nominalization construction t-etu-ki-ñї-fїɳї, ‗not having their own settlements‘ contains the reflexive prefix:

ɳene

iñalї

t-etu-ki-ñї-fїɳї

animals negation REF-settlement-INST-N-unlike

i-tsa ele,

ɳene-i.

EX-CI PDEM, animals-CL

‗Animals out there don‘t live in their own settlements, they‘re

animals.‘

c. Reflexive on verb phrase; the co-reference is a prior O.

t-ifogi-tsa=kafa e-feke. REF-find-CI=EM 2-ERG ‗You‘re looking for her, aren‘t you?‘

7.4.1.2. Adverbial use of the reflexive prefix

Certain de-verbal adverbials are initiated with the reflexive prefix. These do not appear to be reflexive. In the following example there are two instances of this type of construction:

a.

lepene

t-ipoi-si

afterwards REF-carry-ADV

feke kuge-na ERG human-ALL

t-uGi-kї-mi

e-feke

REF-destroy-CAUS-ADV 2-ERG

‗Following that, while carrying it to the person, ―As for this

human being, you are the cause of his own destruction.‖‘

7.4.1.3 Use of reflexive or co-referential S t- before OB co-referential (A→S ) ñ- prefix.

These examples show the common use of t- to disambiguate S from the two 3rd person oblique arguments of the transitive verb ―search.for‖,
constructed as a de-ergagtive.

a.

ande-dyaka ti-ñ-enïm-iŋo

efiñano-ake

here/now-EM REFL-PB-search for-POT older bro-COM

―Now I‘ve decided searching with the older brother will take

place,

215

Ø-opi-dyï-ko-iña 3-avenge-PI-PL-DAT/BEN so they can be avenged.‖

b. With a plural S (―exclusive we‖) referenced:

tisuge-fa

ti-ñ-indu-te-gani

inde,

we (excl)-PTP REFL-PB-share-VT-ANT here,

iŋadyo-mo-ake, brothers-COLL-COM ‗We and the other group of brothers are about to share it

7.4.2. Middle voice

Middle voice in Kalapalo involves a prefix operator (MV) that occurs with bodily active or stative verbs, in which A and P are virtually the same and may be considered a simultaneous ‗undergoer‘. Middle voice prefix may be inherent in verbs referencing motion involving the whole body or inherent body parts; examples include: 'looking up ('lifting up one's face'), 'coiling up one's body' (as, a snake), 'cutting one's hair', 'rising up out of the water', 'being tied up'; a group forming itself into a pattern, 'lining up'; 'forming into a circle', illness events such as, 'vomiting', 'purging', 'having eye problems'; also, 'feeling shame', 'used up', 'finished', 'softening', 'avenging oneself', 'making an image of oneself'. Middle voice is also used with verbs that occur also in active voice. Examples are: 'shooting each other', 'painting the body', 'falling sick', 'looking for', 'leave'.
I use the expression 'middle voice diathesis' in reference to the use of MV on the verb root in both active and stative cases as the semantic effect appears to be important. The prefix always takes the form V(t). Because of the presence of /t/ in this prefix, middle voice marking may be diachronically related to the reflexive prefix t(i,e).

a. An example with the verb with middle voice e- diathesis which occurs when the verb is consonant initial, as here. The speaker is talking about using a piece of bamboo to shave a man‘s neck.

ule-ki

aŋifolo e-tsu-mbi-tsi-ga

ATR-INST first.people MV-shave-Vi-CI

‗With that thing the first people were shaved.‘

b. Another extended intransitive verb ï, ‗do‘ with middle voice etprefix:

uŋele-fa

tï-kiŋo-ki

et-ï-i-lï

same.person-PTP REF-design-INST MV-do-EP-PI

‗He was painted with his own design.‘

216
To mark middle voice undergoer, with roots beginning with /a/, the diathesis marking at- prefix occurs. With roots beginning with /i/, the diathesis marking et prefix occurs. With the very few roots beginning with /u/ and /i/, the diathesis marking ut prefix occurs. Finally, roots beginning with a consonant have diathesis e-. Stems with a verbal radical often become nominalized, in which case this middle voice diathesis persists. Occasionally an adverb also exhibits diathesis (see 7.4.2.1d).

7.4.2.1 Diathesis prefix at- on /a/ initial stems

I have several examples of middle voicing diathesis at-. The verbs are agi- ‗throw‘, ai-, ‗curl up‘ and aGi- ‗cut woman‘s hair‘ (make bangs). There is one adverbial example (d).

a.

This pair of examples illustrates diathesis with the root aGi-

‗women‘s hair‘. In the first construction, the transitive verb aGi-

pi-tsi-, ‗shorten a fringe‘ (‗make bangs‘) is nominalized by the

usuitative nominalizer, which is re-verbalized by the potential

aspect morpheme. The ergative argument appears clause finally.

aGi-pi-tsi-gofo-iŋo

u-feke

bangs-SAL-Vt-USIN-POT 1-ERG

‗I‘m planning to cut (make) her bangs‘

Here, diathesis occurs with the at- prefix. The construction is a nominalized clause.

eŋifolo at-agi-ke-ta-nïmi ancients MV-bangs- cut-CI=CONS ‗When the Ancients wanted to cut (shorten) their bangs.‘

b. Another pair illustrates diathesis with the root agi, ―throw away‘, ‗shoot a gun‘. Here is a simple use of the root as a reflexive transitive construction:

t-agi-lu

tifeke

REF-throw.away 1+3-ERG

‗We threw that away‘ (i.e., no longer made it).

The following illustrates the diathesis marking construction on the root with the intransitive radical -ɳa:

Kohotsi ekugu=ɳapa-fa iñїɳgo=lefa, Sunset fully=EM-PTP come.to-POT-PL=MT

is-їɳї-pїgї-na-fa ege-na-fa

at-agi-ɳa-tїfїgї-ko-na MV-shoot-Vt-IMP-PL-ALL ‗It could have been that they came to where they slept, to there, to the place we‘ve been naming, to where they had been shooting at each other.‘

c. An example with the nominalized construction of the verb ai-, ‗curl up‘:

at-ai-pïgï

eke-fa.

MV-curled.up-VPE snake-PTP

‗That curled up snake.‘

at-afi-tse-ko=lefa

ata-ɳe

MV-circle-Vi-PL=MT EQA-REP

‗They formed themselves into a circle again.‘

7.4.2.2 Diathesis prefix et- on /i/ initial stems

a.

et-i-mi-, avenge. The example shows the verb stem nominalized

with the ‗usitative‘ nominalizer (USIN).

b. This example involves the transitive verb imï-ke, ‗look up‘, ‗show one‘s face‘, with diathesis on the root imї- ‗face‘:

ene-fa

et-imï-ke-i-fo-lï,

218 d. Diathesis on the verb їi- ‗put on‘:

Diathesis on verb ïgi, ‗fall sick‘:

7.4.2.3. Diathesis prefix ut- on /i /initial stems. As these all have 1st person reference, the u- first person prefix may be involved.

219

a.

c.

u-tseku-Gi-ts-omi:

‗For letting my body be painted‖ ‗

u-t-eku-Gi-ts-omi 1-REFL-paint body-VI-CI-PURP ‗I intend someone to paint me.‘

u-t-igiñ-ïŋo

1-REFL-sing-CI-FUT, 1-REFL-sing-POT

‗I‘ll soon sing about myself, I plan to sing about myself.‘

7.4.2.4 Diathesis prefix ut- on initial / u/ stems
These examples reference a third person P experiencer of a bodily state verb. The examples are of the stem umi- tie up. (a) is a malefactive construction, ( b)shows the stem in adverbialization, with the reversative suffix.

a.

ut-umi- ñalї gehale i-feke

MV-tie.up-MAL again 3-ERG

‗He was tied up again by her‘.

b. ut-umi-tsi-ɳalї

i-feke

MV-tie.up-ADV-REV 3-ERG

‗He was re-tied by her.‘

7.4.2.5. Diathesis prefix e- on consonant initial stems
Most of these stems begin with /f/ or /t/. Example (a) is the only attested example of an /m/ initial stem with diathesis marking, and this is a noun incorporated verb stem.
a. This example shows diathesis e on the usually person marked time noun, mitote ‗at dawn‘:

220

e-mitote-ku=mbedye-ta=fale egei, ai-mbe-fa. MV-dawn-IN=PSA-DIS-NO IDEM, finally-SS-PTP ‗Even so just before dawn this time, finally that happened (to him)‘.

c.

Diathesis marked with e on the stem futisu-, ‗feel shame‘ and pї-

‗shoot‘ which has been nominalized. This is a typical clause

chain construction. In the chain, there are three different

constructions using futisu. The first, initial utterance is

intransitive; 3p S is marked by the i-prefix. The second clause

(bracketed) shows the diathesis marking of middle voice

construction with the immediately following O NP, then the

ergative case marked A. The immediately following third

construction is an adverbialization with the –ki suffix on the verb

stem; this adverbial is an adjunct of the existential copular verb

which is subordinate to the final main clause in the chain.

7.5 Position of constituent segments in the verbal word

In this section, I describe the verbal constructions and the coordinations possible between various inflections and derivational morphemes. I will begin with a schematic description of the morphological properties of the finite verbal word. A discussion of non-finite constructions concludes the chapter.
The core element of a verbal word is the stem, consisting of a root with semantic function, and a radical indicating ambitransitive, transitive or intransitive status of the stem. In the case of a finite verb, the stem is preceded by an optional preventative prefix and a required absolutive pronominal prefix. There is finally an unusual optional prefix ga- referencing downward activity. Following the stem of a finite verb is of of several possible optional valence increasing ‗causative‘ affixes, and an aspect suffix which may be inflected for plural number. A schematic representation of this simple finite verb construction is shown in Diagram 2. When ―or‖ appears in constraint* column, a feature may not be followed by the next numbered feature (i.e. the pronominal prefix and reflexive prefix do not co-occur). .

7.5.1. Preventative prefix, ke-. (PREV)

This prefix always occupies the first position in the verbal word. In the following example, there is also an oppositive -ne preceding the final desiderative adverbializer –ti. ke- appears as ka- where vocalic assimilation occurs (see Chapter 2: Phonology.)

7.4.2. Personal pronominal prefixes
Personal pronominal prefixes are generally the same as those on the possessed nominal word, with the exception of the reflexive t(i,u)prefix. The reflexive prefix may have several different functions when appearing on verbal words (see section 7.3.1, above).

7.5.3 Downward motion prefix ga-

This is quite unusual as it is the only prefix with a semantic function to operate on the verb stem. Its use is very limited.

7.5.4. Intransitive and transitive radical suffixes
Kalapalo verbs consist of stems formed from a root plus a morpheme referred to here as a ―radical‖. These radicals appear as suffixes immediately following the root. They include a large number of possiblities, establishing the status of the verb, including changing an intransitive verb to a transitive. For transitive verbs the radicals include speech acts, benefactives, positive manipulative, inchoative, malefactive, action on a patient, and oppositive. (see Table 28) For intransitives, the possibilities include: delocutive, bodily action, utterances, pass from one state to another, motion, directional motion (to or away from a reference point), psycho-benefactive, adversative, benefactive bodily action, reversative, benefactive stative, consciousness events, and possibly activity involving water. There is also an ambitransitive radical -ki which is listed in the intransitive table. (See Table 27).
Transitive status may be changed by derivational processes as described in the sections on valence-increasing (7.5.5) and valence decreasing (7.6) constructions. The following tables summarize the

224
types of radicals and their usage. Some radicals appear in the intransitive paradigm, but may also be used as valence-increasing causatives in a position after the intransitive verb stem. These cases are noted. The full set of causatives is discussed spearately in the valency-increasing section in this chapter.

7.5.5 Valence increasing suffixes
Valence increasing constructions involve increasing the number of arguments in a clause by 1) the use of a transitivizing ‗causative‘ radical on an intransitive verb stem, or 2) an inflectional process involving use of the ergative suffix -feke to mark a second verbal argument (not necessarily A). Kalapalo valence-increasing suffixes include the transitive –ŋe/ne radicals, and what in general I call the ‗causative‘ suffixes: -ki, -Gi, -ku, -ga and -nu. Here I give a simple example of the use of the causative suffix –Gi, ‗to allow/have someone do something to X‘ on the verb tseku-, ‗paint the body‘:
a. u-tseku-tsomi 1-paint.body-PURP

227
‗I want to paint my body.‘
b. u-t-eku-Gi-tsomi 1-MV-paint.body-CAUS-PURP ‗I intend to have someone make me painted.‘
Further discussion and detail regarding valence-increasing operations on Kalapalo verbs appear later in this chapter in section 7.6.7.5.6 Illocutionary force, aspect and irrealis status: overview
In Kalapalo there are no specific verbal markers of tense. Contextual indication of tense reference comes from adverbial and nominal temporal deixis, from the interclausal reference marker clitics, and to a lesser degree, from some epistemic clitics. Future is implied by some irrealis forms and the active equative root in ‗perfect of future‘ clause construction, but is not marked as such.
The three types of illocutionary force are marked differently. The indicative is unmarked on the verb. Imperatives (including hortatives) are marked with one of several imperative suffixes on the verb stem; imperatives are discussed in Chapter 8. Interrogatives are referenced by a complement construction preposed to the verb, containing an interrogative lexeme. These are discussed in Chapter 9. In addition, there is a set of irrealis conditions marked on the verb.
In the indicative, there are five aspectual distinctions and a malefactive. These aspectual distinctions are different from those found in nominal constructions. As discussed in the section on epistemic modality in Chapter 3, I make a strict distinction between the term ‗‗status‘ to refer to a non-aspectual irrealis grammatical feature suffixed to the verb, and ‗epistemic‘ which in Kalapalo is a cliticized category that has to do with the point of view or judgment of the speaker regarding the proposition under consideration; there is also a separate sub-class of expressives that are epistemic, described in 12.2.2.. As noted earlier in 3.3.7, Kalapalo ‗epistemic‘ clitics may sometimes reference modality in the sense of ‗degrees of confidence‘, but have a larger range of general features than that term would allow. I use the term status to avoid using ‗modality‘ for these two very different types of operators as well as for the deontic post-positions.
To make the contrast between the epistemic and the conditional marking of events clear, I use the term ‗irrealis‘ to refer specifically to an inflectional feature on the verb stem referencing varieties of conditions that precede events which have not occured. (I do not, however, use the term ‗conditional‘ for any grammatical feature). Future is not always implied by irrealis nor is it marked as a tense with these forms. Certain irrealis forms occur only in subordinate clauses or to link main and subordinate clauses.
Finally, Kalapalo ‗aspect‘ is an inflectional feature that marks the quality of the whole of an action in regard to time. While the malefactive is not an aspect, it is included in the indicative for semantic reasons, particularly with regard to its use with verbs referencing ‗antagonistic‘ action. . Many, though not all of these aspectual and irrealis inflections also appear on the ‗be‘ roots that are described in

228

Chapter 3: Copularity. As I show in that chapter, there is at least one copular inflection, atehe that is not present on the semantic verb, being distinctive to the active equative ‗be‘ root at- (EQA). As I have already described in Chapter 5, the aspectual suffixes and semantic references in nominal constructions are different from those seen in verbal constructions. Table 29 presents the verbal illocutionary forceaspect/irrealis paradigm.

7.5.7 The indicative
The Kalapalo indicative distinguishes six aspectual contrasts, including punctual, continuative, resultative, repetetive, reversative, and malefactive. I use the term ‗indicative‘ to reference an essentially unmarked illocutionary force type, where the listener is expected to take what the speaker says as described. This absence of verbal marking contrasts especially with speaker‘s frequent use of the epistemic ‗assertive‘ expletive ah ‗surely‘ (EXP), a kind of realis marking (see example 7.5.7.1.d).

229

7.5.7.1 Punctual indicative suffixes, -lï/lu; dyï/dyu

These suffixes reference a single, usually spontaneous event. If there is a plural subject or patient, the suffix is followed by the absolutive plural suffix –ko.

‗Surely, he has eaten this wife of mine.‘

e.

The punctual suffix is followed by the simultaneous taxis clitic –

fata (SIM); ATR marks the final subordinate clause (same as

Chapter 14 ex. 4.4.4f):

‗Afterwards it (i.e., fruit) was dropping down and while was

one of them.‘

7.5.7.2 Continuative indicative suffixes

The suffixes -ga, -ta, -nda,- tsa may be understood as progressive (especially with first person actor), or iterative with some transitive verbs in the case of plural patient, as ‗one by one‘ of a collectivity.

a. kogetsi ku-tufi ku-ñi-ta tomorrow 1+2-crops 1+2-see-CI ‗Tomorrow we‘ll look at our crops.‘

7.5.7.6 Malefactive, iñalї

The malefactive indicative suffix is the same negative form used as a monomorphemic ‗negation‘ adverb preposed to the main clause. As a suffix on the verb stem, the malefactive references a realis action that often involves the use of intentional force (‗try hard‘, ‗force‘) and/or which is ‗pathetic‘ or ‗pitiful‘ to the speaker or onlooker. This inflection occurs on both transitive and intransitive active verbs, and on intransitive stative verbs. Where the preceding suffix ends in a consonant, an epenthetic /i/ (EP) appears before the malefactive suffix (as in examples b, e)

a.

In this interrogative example, the malefactive appears on the

existential copular verb i-.

‗Something happened to you, didn‘t it, while this was going on?‘

b. Here the adverbial malefactive clause is subordinate to the main verb clause in a reversative construction that initiates the utterance (same example 2.4.5):

is-i-nalï-ti,

t-iŋandsu-ko

3-come to.-EP-REV-DES, REF-sister-PL

ugu-pe mi-ñalï i-feke-ni. on-SAL hit-MAL 3-ERG-PL ‗When she wanted to come back to them, they pushed their sister away.‘

afterwards, 3-drink-MAL=PT 3-ERG

‗Later on, he was still forcing him to drink it.‘

234

d. An interesting example of the malefactive on a verb stem igi-fes ‗head-ugly‘ used to express the idea of ‗bother‘, or ‗trouble‘ someone:

e-mugu igi-fes-i-ñalï

u-feke

2-son head-bother-EP-MAL 1-ERG

‗I never troubled your son.‘

e. The malefactive used on the stative causative transitive verb faŋa-tuŋ-Gi- ‗insult‘, incorporating the noun faŋa ‗ear‘. Although stative, the use of the inflection suggests the action of ‗insulting‘ is an effortful one on the part of the speaker.

‗That is nothing like what you gulp down so pathetically‘.

g. In this example with the active transitive verb iki-, ‗make manioc flat bread‘, there is also a sense of effortful work, somewhat in vain.

toki=lefa

i-fitsu-feke iki-ñalï.

remaining=MT 3-wife-ERG make.bread-MAL

‗There was hardly enough left for his wife to eke out some

h. In this example both the adverbial negation and the negative affix appear. The verb ifi-, ‗touch‘ is often used as a euphemism for the male role in copulation. Here the malefactive again lends a pejorative sense to the construction:

iñalï-ma Ø-ifi-ñalï

i-feke

NEG-EM 3-touch-MAL 3-ERG

‗He was never able to force himself on her.‘

In this example the malefactive appears on the existential ‗be‘

verb i-.

7.5.8 Irrealis status

Kalapalo has several irrealis markers on the verb stem, including potential, anticipative or inchoative, hypothetical, enabling purposive, and concessive. As stated earlier, I use the term ‗irrealis‘ to refer specifically to non-aspectual inflectional features on the verb stem that express conditions preceding events that have not occured. Future is not always implied nor is it marked as a tense with these forms. The enabling purposive (7.5.8.5, 7.5.8.6) occurs only in subordinate clauses, while the concessive is a coordinating inflection that links main and subordinate clauses. In addition, the final class inclusion copula suffix – i is sometimes used as an irrealis nominalizer, often appearing with negative, malefactive, desiderative, and hypothetical verbal constructions the following are two examples of the use of this suffix:

a.

In this example the malefactive adverbial clause is then

nominalized with the class inclusion copula –i.

itopu-i e-ŋi-li-ñalї-i?:

b. In this example where the malefactive is used on the the common verb ili, ‗drink‘, the construction takes on the sense of ‗gulp down pathetically‘

7.5.8.1 Potential
The potential irrealis is marked with the suffix -iŋo (POT). The ‗uncertainty‘ of this imperfective references a plan but without an initiative. If the S argument is plural the –go suffix precedes the potential suffix as: ŋgo-iŋo. The morpheme contrasts with the anticipated (inchoative) suffix (7.5.8.2) which marks greater certainty as the action as been initiated in some way.

‗In this direction some messengers met them, Piranha with

Barbed Catfish.‘

7.5.8.2 Anticipated (inchoative)
The anticipated status is marked with the suffix -(ta)(ga)ni (ANT). This imperfective operator references an event that might actually have begun or which is about to begin with certainty, for example, where there has been an initiated process consisting of several ―steps‖ the others of which have been completed. Thus the anticipated expresses the idea that an event will occur as the end point of the process, as a specified goal. It thus differs from 7.5.8.1 (potential), which has the sense of a planned, but not yet begun or fully confirmed, action.
If S is plural, accusative -ni suffix follows the aspect suffix. With the active equative copular verb stem at-, the suffix is –ani (b); with the existential copular verb stem in continuative indicative (i)tsa(a) and with stems followed by the causative suffix –ga (f), the root is simply –ni.

7.5.8.3 Hypothetical
The hypothetical is marked with the suffix –fo on the verb stem, followed by a punctual or continual aspect suffix. Many examples appear on main or subordinate clauses of complementation strategies. (See Chapter 13: Complex Clause Constructions).

7.5.8.4 Enabling purposive -omi-, -t(nd)omi

7.5.9 Plural concordance suffix.

The verbal plural concordance suffix is absolutive –ko or accusative –ni. They follow the indicative aspectual or irrealis inflectional suffixes.

Ø-at-ani-ni=lefa ifo-dyї-ko. 3-EQA-ANT-PL=MT approach-PI-PL ‗They were all approaching.‘

7.5.10 –ti, desiderative clause constructions

240

Desiderative clause constructions occur with the suffix –ti (DES) following the indicative (punctual or continuative) suffix on the verb stem. The clause may be a subordinate or main clause. Where the verb is nominalized, the desiderative may follow the nominalizer (7.5.1a)
In the first example, the –ti suffix on the verb is complemented by a complex NP (in brackets). Note the difference between the transitive verb fote-, ‗burn‘ and the causativized itote-‗set fire to‘; the latter is clearly a de-nominalized verb:

a.

7.5.11 Evidential suffixes
There are four Kalapalo verbal evidential suffixes, tї, fї, kilї, and kita. The first two appear on quotatives, while the second two appear on verbal or de-verbal constructions. These evidentials function to reference the speaker as a kind of authoritative source of information about the past. They also function to signal focus of the information being asserted. None of these seem to be required. Rather, they are used for a kind of rhetorical effect. It is important to know who is using these evidentials, as ‗source of information‘ is only one element in their semantic functions. Kalapalo evidentials are generally used in special contexts involving the transmission of knowledge, such as traditional narrative discourse and a hereditary leader‘s public speech making. Thus the ‗status‘ of the speaker (as hereditary leader or ordinary person) is important for knowing why a particular evidential is being used. If there is an evidential suffix on the verb, it may not be followed by the modifer –tsї. This would seem to support Franchetto‘s interpretation of the two morphemes as variants of an authoritative hearsay evidential (7.5.10.1). However, there is considerable evidence to support the idea that these are two functionally distinct morphemes. (One simple example is 5.3.2b, where -tsї cannot be understood as a hearsay—or any kind of—evidential, as the speaker is giving the listener more information about a phenomenon that is being observed by both speaker and listener).

7.5.11. 1. -tï, ‗authoritative hearsay‘

241
What I call the ―authoritative hearsay‖ suffix is an evidential that is commonly used by narrators of mythic stories and in some didactic contexts. If the speaker is an experienced hereditary leader, the quotative complement after speech about the anetu itagiñu, ‗leader‘s talk‘, is marked with this evidential suffix. This quoted speech is knowledge that cannot be personally attested to by the speaker, but has been learned from another authority. The value of –tї, often used with the quotative or suffixed to an adverbial introductory narrative segment marker, comes from the quoted speaker being indexed as an expert performer of the ancestral knowledge about which he is speaking. (Both men and women use it in narrative discourse.) According to Pace Franchetto (2003), the morpheme –tsї is a relativizing modifier in Kalapalo, not an allomorph of the present evidential.
a. ah, nïgï-t≈i-feke EXP, say.to-EV-3-ERG ‗Surely, that‘s what 3p said, they say‘.
b. The following example is taken from a leader‘s discourse, impressing on his listeners the traditional nature of his knowledge about leaders from the distant past, using the –tї suffix in the final quotative clause.
inde fegei at-iñe a-tagi-mba-tofo=mbedya=lefa here ADEM ask-SN 3-tell-Vi-USIN=PXA-MT
egei-fa, ta-wa-t≈i-feke IDEM-PTP tell-PPT-EV≈3-ERG ‗This is what (they) use for telling about what those others did, and they even tell about what has been learned about them. ‘

7.5.11.2 –fi , ‗non-authoritative hearsay‘

This suffix is only used in narrative discourse on the ‗say.to‘ quotative. None of the four speakers who used this in their narratives were hereditary leaders, though they were certainly competent and respected persons whose knowledge came from hereditary leaders, and three were ritual experts. I therefore interpret this provisionally as a ‗non-authoritative‘ hearsay evidential in contrast with form 7.5.10.1, which is always used by hereditary authorities.

a.

This example was a speaker‘s introduction to his story:

ah Ø-nїgї-fi-feke EXP, say.to-PS-EV-ERG ‗Surely, this was what was said.‘

b. ah Taugi nїgї-ki-tani

taifa, Ø-nїgї-fi-feke,

EXP Taugi say.to-CAUS-CI URG, say.to-PS-EV-ERG

242

‗Surely the utterance ‗Taugi‘ will be made urgent, it‘s said he said to him.‘
Ø-nїgї=mbembe-fi≈feke. say.to-PS=RSA-EV≈ERG ‗It‘s said he repeatedly said that to him.‘

7.5.11.3-kilï, kita, ‗inherited knowledge‘
These two morphemes, mark authoritative inherited knowledge, and are only used with leadership oratory and historical narratives. However, not all authorities use them. It does not seem to be restricted to speakers in a direct line of hereditary leadership, but the speakers were certainly authoritative figures. Kita occurs with the punctual indicative verbal inflection, while kila occurs on a de-verbal nominalization.

7.5.11.4.1 kita

In the following example, the verb imbi-, ‗steal‘ is inflected with the punctual indicative suffix –lï.

a.

katote=lefa kagaifa-fek

"And those who were there said that the Christians stole

7.5.11.4.2 kilïThis evidential appears in examples with de-verbal nominalizations.

a. This example comes from a historical narrative told by the late Kofoño, a very old woman, and expert in ritual and narrative traditions.

7.6. Valence-increasing operations
There are three strategies for increasing the number of arguments that a verb takes. This can occur by 1) the inflection of an intransitive root by a transitivizer radical, 2) the use of a causative suffix on the stem, and 3) the presence of the ergative argument to mark a new verbal argument when the verb stem has the suffix -ki. Table 30 summarizes the functions of the five morphemes.

244

7.6.1.1. Use of –ŋe/ne radical. There is one transitivizer verb radical which operates on ambitransitive verbal roots, changing an intransitive to a transitive. These processes include:

a.

SA, where S in intransitive becomes A in transitive derivation:

aŋu-‗perform→ aŋu -ɳe- play instrument‘; tseku-, ‗paint one‘s body‘ → tseku-Gi- ‘let someone paint one‘s own body‘, itsumbu-ɳe, ‗catch in one‘s throat‘.

b. SP, where S in intransitive becomes P in transitive derivation: alamaki-, fall → alamaki-ɳa- drop

Example (a) shows the verb –aŋu (‗play an instrument‘) in intransitive construction related to a valence-decreasing process (marked by objectbackgrounding affix –ñ-). (b) shows the same verb in transitive construction with A in ergative case.

Another pair (c, d) shows a similar contrast. (c) shows the verb –ti- ―get up‖ in nominative-accusative imperative form and then in (d), the same verb in ergative-absolutive construction with the transitive radical -ne.

7.6.1.2. Use of causative suffixes –ki ,-Gi, -ku, -ga (CAUS)
These are event- or state-changing operations that add one more argument to the predicated event that is caused. This is a derivational process that makes an intransitive verb into a transitive verb, or a ―two argument‖ transitive verb into a three argument verb. There are several possibilities. I treat -ki, ‗cause X‘ as an ambitransitive radical (glossed, Va) that may appear with both intransitive and transitive active verb stems. However, it also also occurs after a stem, in which case I consider it a valence-increasing morpheme (glossed, CAUS). -Gi, is a transitive radical on stative verbs which may occur as a causative, ‗cause X‘ (glossed CAUS), sometimes with a permissive sense (glossed CAUSP). The morpheme -ku, ‗do something to someone‘ is a suffix that seems to always immediately follow the verb stem. Which of these three is used as a causative is based on verb semantics, including whether causality is voluntary or involuntary. Thus -Gi often has the sense of ‗let, allow‘. The suffix –ga is a ‗stronger‘ causative with the sense of ‗determined to do X for Y‘.

7.6.1.2.1. –ki-: ―make someone do something to someone else, make someone be X‖ (CAUS)

This morpheme is most often seen as a radical on the stems of active intransitive verbs. Many of these verbs are ‗inherently caused‘ body action verbs such as ―vomit‖, ―fart‖, ―shit‖, ‗stink‘. It is also seen on the voluntary verb ‗squeeze‘ (manioc mash). This morpheme may be also used with ambitransitive verb roots as a transitive radical, and on the existential copular verb i-. Note: The same homophonous morpheme is used as the instrumental case suffix marker on oblique arguments (example c) and as a negative mirative clitic. The following examples show the use of the –ki radical on ‗inherently caused‘ intransitive verbs.

a.

On the root ẽ- ―stink‖:

kanasï eñe-ki-tsa figei giant.deer stink-CAUS-CI IDEM ‗This (situation) is the giant deer is made to stink‘.

b. The following three examples show the use of the radical –ki as a ―bodily action‖ verb radical (Va) on the verb root egua- ‘to squeeze (manioc mash)‘. At the same time, it is an example of the loss of ergative NP when the verb is repeated in a clause chain (see chapter on Discourse functions):

i. egua-ki-lï-lefa squeeze mash-Va-PI-MT ‗So she squeezed the mash.‘

246

ii. egua-ki-tomi squeeze mash-Va-PURP ‗Intending to squeeze the mash.‘

iii. Ah kum-iñaŋo egua-ki-ta-fa

=fameti-dyau-feke.

EM 2+food squeeze-Va-CI-PTP =Zinlaw+PL-ERG

‗Your sisters+in+law are really (working at) squeezing it.‘

c.

Example with the ‗inherently caused‘ intransitive verb, iŋgu-,

‗nurture‘:

lepene iŋgu-ki-ta-lefa ofiña-ki-lї-iña later grow-Va-CI-MT beneath-Vt-PI-DAT

ete-ŋalï-ko

tu-fitsu-ake.

go.away-REP-PL REFL-wife-COM

‗Then to nurture it by clearing beneath it (i.e., weeding) he and

his wifewent away again.‘

The ergative case may be used to mark a new verbal argument with –ki radical stems. This syntactic argument process involves valenceincreasing ambitransitive verbs, to mark a new verbal argument. The process involves use of the ergative suffix –feke (+ne, plural) to mark the A argument. Examples with the ‗inherently caused‘ stem ama-ki, ‗fall, slip‘are shon in (a) and (b).

a. Intransitive: (from example this chapter, 2.11.c):

is-ama-ki-ɳalї 3-fall-CAUS-CI-REP ‗She made herself fall again‘.

b. Transitivized: The example is taken from a story in which canoes with a slippery substance inside makes the owners slip and fall. The canoes are A, the beings falling are P.

3-fall-CAUS-CI-PL ADEM canoe-ERG,3-OB-canoe-POSS-PL

‗They were made to slip by the canoes, their canoes did that to

them.‘

7.6.1.2.2. –Gi causative ―let someone to do/feel X‖ (PERMC)
The verbs on which this causative appears all involve changes of bodily state. In contrast, the irrealis permissive inflection –tomi on the verb stem references in contrast an action that could be taken. The first example (a) shows –Gi as a transitive radical on the verb roots. The second line in (b), and the last three examples show –Gi as a permissive valence-increasing affix:

247

7.8 Speech act verbs and quotatives
Verbs that reference types of speech-acts and quotatives are somewhat unusual in several ways. First, the quotatives, commonly used, have no roots, only used with a very limited number of aspect suffixes. They are also restricted as to the pronominal prefixes they may take. The first three in the list below are direct report quotatives, important in all kinds of discourse as there is almost no indirect reporting of speech. The first two ‗say to‘, and ‗tell to‘ only occur in third person and usually with quoted speech from the ancient or historical past. They are unusual insofar as there is no verb stem morpheme, only an aspectual or nominalizer inflection. The third quotative is used with recent speech involving the speaker or listener, so it only occurs in first or second person. Intransitive speech act verbs may have their valence increased by the use of the ergative case marker on the target, such that P becomes ergatively marked.

249

7.8.1. -‗say.to X‘

This quotative occurs only with a 3 person A (often pluralized) and the perfective ‗passing state‘ nominalization. There ma also be a taxis clitic included (as in example d). The quotation appears to be the O in this construction, the third person speaker A. However, the person being spoken to is often mentioned in a subsequent ergative NP.

a. This is the standard construction:

(quotation)-nïgï i-feke (-ni) -PS 3-ERG (-PL)

b. Very often speakers use the following vowel elision construction:

nïg≈i-feke

c.

Also common in rapid speech is the complete nullification of

both the aspect suffix and the ergative NP, as: ‗X....‘, nï, X....‘,

nï.

d. The following example gives a full discourse segment using this quotative:

takugugu takugugu takugugu takugugu, (bird call)

ah -n-alï ≈-tsï la

i-feke

EXP say.to-UT≈M

like.that 3-ERG

―‗takugugu takugugu takugugu takugugu‖, believe me, that‘s

what it would say to them over and over‘

7.8.2. -ta. ‗tell to X‘.

This is also a quotative, always in third person. Its use is in contexts that are less conversational that (1) and more ‗declarative‘ in feeling. The quotative occurs in a continuous indicative aspect, also with the zero realized 3p prefix:

a. Ø-ta i-feke, tu-fitsu-feke 3-CI 3-ERG, REF-wife-ERG ‗He told her, his wife.‘

b. eɳї ak≈igei

e-limo-si-ko

ufi-dyu-iña

reason EM≈IDEM 2-child-mother-PL find-PI-DAT/BEN

t-iñe-ta,

–ta figei.

REF-come.to-CI, tell-CI ADEM

250

‗‖The reason we wanted to do this was to find your children‘s mother, so we came,‖ that‘s what he told (him).‘

7.8.3. ki-, ‗utter‘:

This is a ‗neutral‘ speech act verb that simply means ‗utter‘ or ‗speak‘. When a speaker wishes to emphasize the person who has spoken, this may be used after one of the preceding quotatives. There is an overt stem. This quotative may occur as an intransitive (a), or as in (b) a transitive construction. In the case of first or second person speech acts, an intransitive root is used. This verb can use a wider range of aspect suffixes than (7.8. 1) and (7.8.2). The verb may also be used for playing a musical intrument, in which case it is transitive (c):

a.

e-fiñano-feke e-їi-lї-ki-tani,

efiñano-feke.

2-Obr-ERG 2-do-PI-CAUS-ANT, 2-Obr-ERG

Kwatїɳї ki-lї (name) utter-PI ‗ ―Your older brother always made that happen to you, your older brother‖, Kwatїɳї said.‘

b. ki-dyu-iŋo e-feke utter-PI-POT 2-ERG ‗you will sound it (play it)‘

7.8.4. ifa- ‘tell about X‘

a.

tï -to-nїmi

i-fa-ta

RQ-RQ-NPURP 3-tell.about-CI 3-ERG

NEG-IT tell.about-POT-CL 3-ERG

‗It was not yet the teller about it‘.

The following two lines show the verb in two different forms. Example (a) shows an adverbialization with taxis clitic, and (b) an irrealis.

c. keñi fa-ta-ni-ti-ni-fofo PRV tell.about-CI-Vt-DES-PL-IT

251

7.8.5. ika- ‗teach, talk about X‘. The example shows the verb in a subordinate supine construction.

a.

lepe, ah Taugi=ña ti-ka-gi.

next EXP Taugi= D REF-tell.about-SUP

‗Then surely, someone told Taugi‘

7.8.6. Other speech act verbs.

These verbs are descriptive and noun-like, not used as quotatives. They usually appear in continuative indicative aspect as in the following examples:

tagiñunda-ko, ‗conversation‘ (talking to each other) i-fata-fis-unda, mourning chants ai-li-ta, ‘eremonial ‗noise‘, ‗cheering‘ ifetunalї, ‗repeatedly crying out‘, ‗shouting‘

ifetu-nalï. Akiŋi

fetu-nalï.

shout-REV Vinegaroon shout-REV

‗He shouted back. Vinegaroon shouted back.‘

7.9 Verbs used in temporal deixis predication.
A set of terms for the times of year and another for times of day and night, as they were distinguished in former times before use of Portuguese words for times of day and calendrical terms, are verbs.
7.9.1 Terms for times of year
A number of words are used to reference the appearance of Kalapalo astrological constellations, in so doing expressing the idea of different times of year when rain falls. These words occur with the simultaneous taxis clitic =fata, ‗while‘, ‗during‘ (SIM)
1-kofoŋo nakiŋufata: while Duck is bathing himself
2-undïtï nakiŋufata: while Motmot is bathing himself
3. Tiŋu-fisugiñe nakiŋufata; while the Red-Eyed One is bathing himself O-eyes-red-N
4. Ambisa nakiŋufata: while Ambisa is bathing himself
5. Tute nakiŋufata (igifïkïgï= in the middle)

252
6. Ogo nakiŋufata while Grill is bathing
7. To etimi-koŋilï-fata Ema face-wash=SIM ‗while Ema is washing her face‘
10. fikutafa etsuitsilïfata ‗while turtles are laying their eggs‘
11. isoa-ti (lefa): beginning of the dry season
12. kukw-aku-fis-ale: ‗when we look for turtle eggs (?)‘ (time just before the rains)
7.9.2. Terms for times of day with verbal suffixes. There are two commonly used expressions that are verbalizations of nouns for times of day.
1. iminïŋgolefa: early in the morning (sunrise)
2. afugutilïlefa: after sunset (―spend the night‖)
7.10. Second level derivational processes
Second level word class changing derivations include verbalizations of nouns and adverbs, and a few rare examples of ideophonic verbalizations. Compared with nominalizations, Kalapalo word class changing verbal derivations are far fewer. Noun incorporation is probably the most important second level derivational process involving verbs.
7.11.1. Nominal incorporation
Verbs constructed from nouns are derived using several verbal radicals on a nominal morpheme, as well as with radicals paired with valenceincreasing suffixes. These stems are then inflected with aspect suffixes. Arguments of transitive noun-incorporated verbalizations occur in the usual word order. Several semantic types nouns are frequently used in these constructions. These are 1. body parts (stomach, eye, head, ear, tail feathers); 2. personal functions (interactive self, image of self) 3. material objects that are handled; 4) words for times of day.
7.11.1.1 Examples with body part words

253

a. akah,

b. Ø- ŋ-upu-Gi-lï-fata=lefa 3-PB-mould-Vt-PI-SIM-MT ‗While it was growing mould.‘

c. (same as this chapter, 3.1.3.2.j)

ato

et-iɳu-ki-ta

ifekeni ege-te

canoe-launch-PIMT 3-ERG-PL over.there-at

‗from there they launched the canoe‘

7.11.1.3. Examples with words for personal functions:

a.

From akua: ‗interactive self‘ (often incorrectly translated ‗soul‘):

akua-ki-nïŋgo: self-ADV-EX;TR;PL ‗They were surprised‘

b. from ufutofo, ‗sign, image‘:

kuk-iŋandsu-ko et-ufu-tofo-nde-pïgï 1+2-sister-PL MV-know-USIN-Vi-VPE ‗Our sister‘s sign that she made‘.

7.11.1.4. Examples with words for times of day:
a. From afuguti: turning dusk:
at-afugu-idyï-ko MV-dusk-PI-PL ‗When they experienced ther sun set‘
b. From, mitote, ‗time of crepuscular light‘:

254

okogetsi imi-nïŋgo=lefa next.day dawn-PI;PL=MT ‗The next day at their dawning‘

c.

afugu-ti-lï=lefa

sun.set-ADV-PI=MT

‗When the sun had set...‖

7.11.1.5 Examples with natural species names.

In the first example, the species‘ name has become adverbialized, then, the construction verbalized:

a.

s-itafiɳa-ki-ɳu-nda si-ta=mb≈idyogu-nda

3-caiman-ADV-Vi-CI 3-ALOC=SS≈3;uncle-CI

‗Go around alligatoring, as he did that he came across his

uncle.‘

Note: the expression ‗alligatoring‘ refers to the young man going from house to house looking for lovers. Similarly does the male caiman go from one female to another.

b. In the second example, the indicative verbal suffixes are simply attached to the species name in the first two verb phrase. In the final phrase, the species name is followed by -ɳe, the intransitive ‗bodily action‘ verbal radical, adverbialized, and then renominalized as a performer of the action.

tafitse-ga-ko, tafitse-lї, tafitse-ɳe-ki-ñe macaw-CI-PL, macaw-PI, macaw-Vi-ADV-AN ‗One by one they entered macawing, macaw-ed, the macaw-ers.‘

Note the expression ‗macawing‘ refers to the young men entering a settlement in their ceremonial regalia, fully decorated in their macaw and toucan feather headdresses, feather earrings, body and face paint, cotton and beaded belts, shell belts and collars, ankle rattles, cotton armbands. their cheers evoke the sounds of a flock of magnificent macaws flying overhead.

7.11.2 The –te, ―go.away‖ derivation

While many complex clause constructions involve a verbal or adverbial clause subordinate to the main verb te-, ‗go.away‘, the suffix –te- may be used to create a distinct derivational construction with a similar meaning, ‗go away to do/be X‘. It may also be used to create verbs from nouns, particularly body part words:

a

With the root, indu-, ‗distribute‘, 1+3A, oblique comitative

argument and absolutive plural concordance on the verb phrase

255

tisuge-fa ti-ñ-indu-te-ga-ni

inde,

1+3-PTP REFL-PB-distribute-VT-CI-PL, here,

iŋadyo-mo-ake, brothers-COLL-COM ‗We and the other group of brothers here will soon share it.‘

b. Many –te verbs end with a Ø marked resultative inflection. In this example, there is an subordinate clause -te derivation on a noun incorporated verb with resultative inflection.

i-faŋa =fesu=fale fegei te-lï≈feke 3-ear=bad=DT ADEM go.away-PI≈ERG

Matїga i-mï-te-Ø. Matїga 3-face-go.away-RES ‗But he went away not understanding him well, set against Matїga‘. (i.e., ‗as his enemy. ‗)

c.

Here is another –te verb with Ø resultative; the speaker repeats

the verb phrase but in punctual indicative inflection:

lepene kogetsi ah, fipї-te-Ø afterwards next.day EXP, pay-Vt-RES

i-feke, fipї-te-lї. 3-ERG, pay-Vt-PI ‗Afterwards the next day, surely in the end he payed him, he paid.‘

d. In this example, the transitivizer radical –pa, referencing cyclical or turn taking action (CYC) precedes the -te derivational resultative construction:

tï-ge-pa-te-Ø

i-feke,

REF-pile.up-CYC-Vt-RES 3-ERG

‗She set them out in several different piles as a result.‘

Note the nominal form: is-e-pa-gï, ‗it‘s set out portions, groups‘ (e.g. of something larger that has been cut up);

7.11.3 Verbalizations of ideophones
I have three examples, heard in casual conversations. Undoubtedly there are more as ideophones are most probably a semi-closed class used in creative speech.

256

a.

takatakatelï: ‗make the takataka sound‘ (ideophone representing

the cracking of gourds that are drying out). This example shows

the speaker‘s use of the –te ‗motion‘ intransitive verb radical.

b. This example shows the speaker‘s use of the –ki verb stem transitivizing radical, followed by the punctual indicative aspectual suffix.

mboki-lï: put down something heavy (from mbok‘) (ideophone for bodily action)

c. tuk, tuku, sound of bones being broken

i-tuku- fe-is=a-le

i-feke,

3-(sound of breaking bones)-bad=UT break-CI=UT 3-ERG,

Chapter 8 ‘Be’ roots and copularity

In Kalapalo, there are four morphemes with copular functions belonging to two grammatical sets: the class inclusion copula suffix -i and the three ‗be‘ roots a-, ata-, and its- . They are copular insofar as they are able to link a copular complement to a copular subject. All copular morphemes have, in addition to their copular functions, other functions. The three ‗be‘ roots may be inflected as finite intransitive verbs, with one S argument, indicative aspect or irrealis verbal suffixes, and no linking of a copular complement to a copular subject. The roots in intransitive or copular verbal construction may also be de-verbalized with derivational nominalization suffixes. Both copular and non-copular functions of the four morphemes are discussed in this chapter.
Both verbal inflections and word-class changing derivational features used with all three ‗be‘ roots are limited compared with the large sets that occur with referential verbs and others appearing on nouns and adverbs. Kalapalo copular verb constructions involve permanent or temporary active and stative equative and existential predicates, which include the semantic properties of logical attribution, association, feeling, location, condition or situation. . Naming and possession are predicated by demonstratives, while quantification predicates are of the less common ―zero copula‖ (Givon 2001: 120; Stassen 2007), or ‗verbless clause‘ (Dixon 2010, II: 159-182) constructions in which two predicational elements are juxtaposed without a linking copular morpheme
‗ There are also a few copular verb predictions involving nonfinite verbs and subordinate verb constructions in which case I use the expression ‗auxiliary copular verb‘.

8.1. Copula suffix -i
The class inclusion copula suffix –i (CL). has both copular and irrealis functions. As a copula, it appears suffixed to the copular complement, which may be a proper noun that is the head of a noun phrase (a, d,e,f), or an identificational (b) or pronominal demonstrative (c), but not other kinds of demonstratives. The copular subject may be the person marking prefix of a possessive nominal construction (a), the A NP that follows a usitative de-verbal nominal construction (d), or a free pronoun (b).

In the first example, the copular complement follows the NP hosting the copula suffix.

a. ukw-iñatї-gї-i

katote

1+2-hand-POSS-CL all

‗All our hands are this kind‘.

In the next example, the copular complement marks an identificational demonstrative referencing the middle voiced verb +

288

adverbial adjunct ekugu, ‗everything‘. The copular free pronoun uege, ‗you‘.

subject is the

b. et-їɳa-ɳi-lї

uege≈kugu igei-i

MV-vomit-Vi-PI you-fully IDEM-CL

‗This is [everything] that you‘ve vomited up.‖

c. In this example, the class inclusion copula occurs on the proximate third person pronominal demonstrative (ege) copular complement, which is P argument of a transitive verb clause. The copular subject is the demonstrative igea ‗this way‘.

u-feke

this.way-M≈ EX≈PDEM-CL toss.off-Vt-HYP-PI 1-ERG

‗I mean, this is how I would toss you off.‘

d.

In this example, the copula suffix appears on a complement

that is a proper noun, which hosts two interclausal reference

marking clitics. The complement subject is a third person S

(zero marked on the verb, ‗go away‘).

kaɳa-i=mbele=mbale e-te-lї fish-CL=CU=CAT MV-go.away-PI ‗Finally in the end he went away as a fish.‘

e. The class inclusion suffix appearing on the copula complement, a deverbalized transitive verb nominalization, the head noun. A function is preserved with this nominalization, and the A NP is the copular subject.

f.

In an interrogative construction, the class inclusion copula

suffix occurs on another de-verbalized transitive verb, this

time derived with an ‗experiencer‘ nominalization suffix. The

complement subject is the ‗rhetorical‘ question subject tї.

The speaker is asking about a fire that appears to be drawing

near.

The class inclusion copula –i (glossed in all examples CL)is sometimes used as an irrealis, often appearing with negative (a, c), malefactive (b), desiderative, and hypothetical verbal constructions (d).

b. ñalï-ma s-ïŋï-lu-i, NEG-EM 3-sleep-PI-CL ‗I don‘t think he ever slept.‘

d. In this example the copula appears in a de-verbal (-mbuɳu, ‗without‘) (W) nominalization:

uwa-eku-ki≈gei

e-ima-gu-mbuŋu-i?

Q INT-MIR-ADEM 2-give.birth-Vi-W-CL

―Why in the world haven‘t you given birth yet?‖

e.

In this example of an active verb ‗contrastive‘ nominalization

-nu), the class inclusion copula suffix –i follows the

contrastive –nu. The narrative context of this statement would

not have allowed a positive nominalization. (Jaguar is

cautioned not to run after women).

ule-fa itaű-iña itsa-ki-nu-i ATR-PTP woman-DAT run.to-Vi-CONT-CL ‗(He was warned before) about being someone who runs after a woman‘

8.2. Zero copula
The absence of a copula suffix may occur in a quantificational predication with juxtaposition of the initial numeral adjective preceding the head noun. An example is illustrated in 8.2a. Pustet 2003:31-2 notes that cross-linguistically the latter are unusual.
a. takiko efu two canoes ‗two canoes‘

8.3 ‘Be’ root functions
The three Kalapalo roots that can be used in copular verb constructions may be inflected as intransitive verbs, with verbal

290

suffixes and pronominal prefixes and single S arguments. In their copular functioning, they join the clausal complement argument (CC) to a copula subject (CS). Influencing the choice of the particular root are semantic differences regarding the stative or active character, temporary or permanent character of the predication. However, such a choice does not seem to be based on the grammatical word class of CC and CS (i.e. whether they are noun, demonstrative, adjective, adverb or derivational forms). In this regard the copularity functions of these ‗be‘ roots is of typological interest, and must be understood in terms of the attributive and identificational predications of both Kalapalo adjectives, adverbials and nominals. In addition to their intransitive and copular functions, the three roots in question appear in de-verbal, and adverbial constructions. All three roots have nominalized forms. In the case of the stative equative copular verb root a- there are several of these nominalized forms and in the case of the active equative copular root ata- in addition to verbal constructions, the root has both nominalized and adverbialized forms. The existential root its- appears in both nominalization and verbalization constructions. All three of these copular roots are thus subject to many of the same (though far more limited) kinds of verbal inflectional processes and verb → noun/adverb derivational constructions as other roots. In terms of word order, a copular verb construction generally follows CC + CS which are simply juxtaposed. In complex constructions with two adverbial predications, the copular verb may occur between the two (see example 3.1.4b); it is not uncommon for complex Kalapalo adverbials (i.e., adverbs with their own adjuncts) to be circumfixed around a verbal construction. Like other verbs, some copular verb constructions can even be nominalized with the class inclusion copular suffix –i. Copular verbs use the same person inflectional categories as other verbs with the exception of the reflexive t-. In addition, plural marking suffixes are used to co-reference the plurality of the predicated NP. Table 31 illustrates the person prefixes and plurality suffixes used with copular roots.Table 31.

292

- Like many semantic verbs, ‗be‘ verbs may also be nominalized with derivational morphemes. In this case, the absolutive suffix –ko will be used in pluralization if in accord with their plural P. In the following example, O of the de-verbal nominalized ‗be‘verb in imperfective aspect is plural.

- Copular verb clauses often appear as subordinate clauses

with main active transitive verb clauses, as main verbs

with subordinate desiderative clauses, and as auxiliary

clause heads, often with non-finite lexical verbs. The

latter are discussed in section 8.7.

8.3.2 The noun-like character of ‗be‘ roots

- ‗‗Be‘ roots in copular construction take a lexical NP or pronominal absolutive prefixas a CS argument but when in de-verbal aspectual nominalizations, they may function as relative complements or nominal modifiers. When nominalized, the ‗be‘ roots take the –ko nominal plural suffix. (Same example as 8.3.1h)

‗Unfortunately it is our relative who is doing this to

us to take us away‖.

8.3.3. The adverbial-like character of ‗be‘ roots

- Derived roots in adverbial construction appear in clause initial position much like lexical complementations described in 13.1, whereasthe position of copular verb constructions in clausal constituent order is typically clause final.- The stative equative a- root often appears as an initial clausal complement construction, aɳi „result‟, and this itself may be

293
re-adverbialized with the adverbial attributive suffix, -pi, as uŋipi,‘possessed‘. All three roots a-, at(a) and i(ts)- occur as adverbial adjunct constructions; in desiderative construction, the first two convey a sense of extra politeness and are often used in the affinal civility register. The root a- may be fused to the epistemic clitic =nika, with lengthened initial vowel, as a:h=nika: “is that so?”.
8.4 Copular root constructions
In this section I review the three roots used as copular constructions, and their inflectional and derivational forms, both copular and noncopular. These roots may only occur with the inflections discussed in this section.
In copular clauses, the order of copula complement, copula subject and copular verb is always CC+CS+CV. Copular complements may include manner and locative demonstratives, identificational demonstratives, pronominal demonstratives (including the anaphoric), adjectives, adverbs (including de-verbal adverbializations), proper nouns, and lexical NPs (lexical nouns with their own complements or adjuncts). Copular subjects include pronominal prefixes, proper nouns, , possessed nouns, and the shift reference clitic =dya(XA) ‗new eventuality‘; they do not include demonstrative or free pronouns. Copula subjects may be first, second or third persons.
Copular clause constructions appear in indicative, imperative, and irrealis. In addition, the three roots may be used in indicative and irrealis main intransitive clauses, in subordinate clauses, and as nominalized and adverbalized constructions.
The active equative and stative existential roots have the most verbal inflection possibilities, while the stative equative root occurs in only a few inflections, two nominalizations and two adverbializations. The active equative and the stative existential roots have both copular and non-copular functions; the stative equative is mainly a copular verb but also occurs in intransitive constructions. The roots ata(‗equative‘) and its- (‗existential‘) each show a alternant form occurring with some inflections. There is no alternate for the root a- . Table 32 is an overview of these features. Plurals are in brackets.

8.4.1 ata- active equative root (EQA)

The active equative copular root has both copular and non-copular functions. It is often used in copular predications involving inherently moving objects, such as the sun and growing plants, and to relate a person to a particular way of acting (for example, clearing land, arriving at a canoe landing, becoming exhausted). Also, this root can predicate counting – but apparently only in connection with the verb uŋ-,‗sleep‘, where ‗counting‘ refers to the number of nights slept, or days ‗passed‘ in a particular place or situation. A special adverbial form of ata- is used in affinal and other strong civilities (see 8.3.1.5). Senses of the root include: ‗do‘, ‗act as‘, ‗reach‘, ‗move to‘

8.4.1.1. ata-ni, anticipated or inchoative (ANT)

The sense of this construction is, ―X has just begun or will be accomplished shortly‖. This inflection is the only form of the root at- that occurs in copula clause constructions.

ata-ni

landing.place-VPE EQA-ANT

296

‗(3rd p) arrived at the landing place‘

f. Here the emphatic suffix on the intransitive verb ( –a) seems to operate as an active verb nominalization ―his weakening‖, permitting the resultant deverbal derivation to modify the copula (the clause is bracketed):

[tu-fi-lï-a

‗When he was almost completely exhausted, she went away.‘

8.4.1.2 at-ehe, perfect aspect

While aspect is somewhat off topic, I include discussion of perfect aspect were as it only occurs with the active equative root. Some examples are given here with more extended discussion of the form in 8.9

a. An example is given here of a negative perfect of persistent situation. In the example, the copular complement is the nominalized verb, while the copular subject are the vegetables listed, followed by the copular verb in perfect inflection.

8.4.1.3. ata-nïgï: perfective passing state nominalization

Both of the following examples are taken from the register called anetu itagiñu, ‗leader‘s talk‖. The copular complements are initial complex NP with their own complements (bracketed), followed by the copular subject (ulimo), ending with the copular clause.

8.4.2.1 ata-i-ti, desiderative adverbialization adjunct

Here at- appears to have the following construction: EQA-IRR-DES, that is the root is followed by the irrealis suffix and the desiderative suffix. This is not a copular form but interpreted here as an irrealis adverbial adjunct, having the sense of ‗perhaps might want to do X‘. ataiti is a politeness marker used with direct (second person) requests, but also commonly heard in triadic communication, that is, permission requests regarding a third party, especially a respect relative who may not be directly addressed. As such ataiti appears as an adjunct to a purposive construction, discourse particle, or a lexical complement.

a. An example from the affinal civility register in which a mother-in-law asks her daughter to make a request to the daughter‘s husband. The adverbial complements the main purposive clause, and is followed by the supine subordinate clause:

‗Perhaps your younger brother might want to get some split

open (i.e., ripened) fruit for me.‘

b. Jaguar, whose eyes have been gouged out by Anteater, politely asks one of his little bird enemies to help him replace them . Here the politeness morpheme is an adjunct to the initial lexical ‗consideration‘ complement (this complex clause construction is described in 13.1.2). Note the presence of the perfect active equative verb (also in boldface), indicating a future perfect.

8.4.2.2.. ata-lï, punctual indicative intransitive verbal construction
Here, the active equative root appears as an intransitive verb with the sense of ‗grow up‘. In this single example from my data, there are two copula morphemes: atalї, active equative copular verb in punctual indicative inflection and the existential copular verb in continuative indicative inflection itsa. The latter is the head of the
construction. The equative, punctate indicative verb +unique suffix –a constitute a nominal predication (‗without anything growing like my special food‘) that is the complement to the

300

existential copular verb itsa. The copula subject is the first person prefix u-.

b. This is an example of ataɳe following a preventative

existential copular construction, suffixed with a negative and

hosting a PT clitic, ‗still‘. The de-verbal nominalization with

its preceding preventative adverbial adjunct (bracketed)

constitute the copula complement (‗my prevented from

arriving‘), while the complement subject is the first person

prefix u-.

8.4.1.8. ata-ŋa, attributive nominalization

This is another type of nominalization construction of the active equative root that may complement a main active verb. a. In the example, the active equative nominalization ‗is doing‘ and active stative in passing state nominalization ‗had been‘ are juxtaposed. Together they complement the final clause verb, imbata-, ‗approach‘.

8.4.3. a-, stative equative root, “be associated with‖ (EQS).

301
All constructions of this root have copular functions. This root relates stative conditions or situations with human beings. My data show a somewhat limited number of inflections, with the root appearing in consequential, former, and passing state nominalization, desiderative adverbialization, and the potential irrealis. There is one example ofthe root a- occurring fused to an epistemic clitic. While I use the gloss ―have‖, this root does not predicate ‗possession‘; though it does form the root of the nominal construction, ‗possession‘, where it takes the possessive suffix. More usually it predicates abstract notions of association, as in, ritual knowledge or competence (8.4.2.7.a, e); a state of being (8.4.4b,d) or a feeling (8.4.2); bearing a certain name (this is different from the naming predication in which the name is linked to the head noun) (8.4.2.4c) or a relationship of some kind (8.3.3).

8.4.3.3. a-nï-mb-iñe: de-verbal ‘former state’ nominalization Here is a somewhat unusual example of a nominalized copula; the apparent deleted syllable or shortened form of –mbïŋï, ―former, past‖ clearly references a past relationship, not an activity that was deliberately ended.

8.4.3.8 – (a,u)ŋ

This form of the stative equative root appears in an adverbialization and as the root of a nominalization, referencing ownership or association.

Examples (a) and (b) in adverbialization

a.

Note: the speaker uses the Tupian word for shaman used in Brazilian Portuguese, pajé)

c. Another adverbialized form of this root, acting as a lexical complement with a nominal ‗resultative‘ clause:

aŋi iŋe

ŋ-iŋi-pïgï

result bees‘. nest PB-see-VPE

‗There‘s a bees‘ nest, he‘s seen it‘.

d. The stative equative root as possessive in a possessed

nominal, constructed with the pronominal possessor prefix

and possessed suffix:

katote ye-ŋi-ko-gu all 3-own-PL-POSS ‗all their things‘

8.4.3.9 aɳ-olo
The precise meaning of this construction is not clear, but it is used with the hypothetical sense of ‗it can be‘, and also with an adnominal

304

demonstrative . Kalapalo translators speaking Portuguese said it meant verdade, ‗true‘.
The following example shows how it is used to initiate a question:

a.

aɳ-olo=nika ete-lї-ko?

EQS-HYP?=EM go.away-PI-PL

„Is it true you are going away?‖

b. The construction used in the introduction to a story:

tsa-ke-fa. ah nїgї-fi-feke.

aɳ-olo fegei

‗Listen to what has been told. This is true.‘

c.

Here the speaker is trying to determine if her husband has

been lying to her, but faced with evidence to the contrary (which she

suspects, correctly, is a deception), she wants to agree with him.

ah, aɳ-olo=dye-tsї=makina≈k≈igei. EXP, EQS-HYP?=SA-M=EM≈EM≈IDEM ‗Surely what I‘m seeing suggests he must be right after all about what happened to her. ‘

8.4.4 its-existential copular verb (EX)

This could be translated, ‗live as, exist as‘

A particularly large range of verbal aspect inflections and nominalizations appear with this root. It is generally and productively used for predications on NP involving a temporary state of existing, living, or a manner of being (such as qualities of self and feeling); 8.3.4.2b is a strong exception as there is a sense of permanence (even death) anticipated. The indicative inflections are morphologically different from semantic verb inflections. The verb refers to a The four derivational forms of this root (the change of state nominalization, the passing state nominalization, and the irrealis malefactive, and desiderative loose the /ts/ element on the root. The suppletive e- form of this root is described in 8.3. 4.12. Section 8.3.4.1. shows examples of the root in plain intransitive construction.

‗The next thing that happened was that as they stayed there they wanted to eat some flatbread, what the others had been making.‘

8.4.4.2 its-a in copular constructions

These may occur with subordinate desiderative clauses constituting the copular complement.

anticipated inflection. The copular complement is an adjective, the

copular subject the shift reference

8.4.4.8 its-iŋa, stative attributive nominalization

This type of nominalizaton of the existential root is used with the contra-spective epistemic clitic =mukwe to express a state of existing

8.5. The active equative copular and perfect aspect: atehe
The active equative perfect is adistinctive aspect in Kalapalo, relating an existing or prospective state to a preceding situation. The perfect can express present, past or future perfects. In Kalapalo, these temporal differences associated with ‗perfect‘ are seen in the interclausal reference marking clitics that precede the clause with the active equative copular verb form atehe (PER). While I have under thirty examples of the use of atehe, the contexts of their use appear to clearly conform to several distinctions described by Comrie (1976).

8.5.1. Perfect of experiential situation

Comrie defines the ‗perfect of experiential situation‘ as a construction that ―indicates that a given situation has held at least once at some time in the past leading up to the present‖ (1976: 58).

8.5.2 Perfect of persistant situation

Comrie descibes the perfect of persistant situation as ―a situation that started in the past but continues (persists) into the present‖ (1976: 60).

a.

Të-iñaŋo-i-mbe ege at-ehe,

REF-food-CL-SS PDEM EQA-PER, tell-CI 3-ERG

―That food of his is what you‘ve been using,‖ he told her

b.

In this example, the lexical verb timbe- „arrive‘ is inflected

in continuous indicative aspect/mood.

Ah timbe-ga=tehe tï-iñaŋgo kusiugu atehe, Øta-ifeke, EM arrive-CI=EX-PER Refl+food sweet. manioc PER, tell+3+ERG,
tu-fitsu-feke. Refl+wife+ERG ‗―Really, you show up day by day with that food of his, those sweet manioc roots‘ he told his wife.‘

Lines (c) and (d) occur in a narrative sequence. They illustrate the perfect of a persistent situation but this time the root is inflected in punctual indicative verbal aspect/mood. The persistant situation is marked by the ideophone indicating repeated action (which is the punctual event of pulling out a plant by its roots).

8.6. Auxiliary copular verb constructions
The ata- ‗active equative‘; an- ‗stative equative‘, and i(ts) ‗stative existential‘ roots when verbalized are also used in auxiliary constructions with thetic non-finite lexical verbs. These are presented in boldface in the examples below. As described in Chapter 7, the thetic type of verb construction does not include either aspect, or irrealis suffixes, nor person prefix marking, but when theticity occurs in a transitive clause, A will be preserved.. Person prefixes and aspector irrealis suffixes appear on the auxiliary verb. Following G. Anderson‘s (2006) terminology, such auxiliary verb constructions fall into his split, split/double and AUX head construction types. Anderson‘s split type means the lexical verb and auxiliary are constructed (in Kalapalo, inflected) differently. Anderson‘s split/double construction type means the lexical and auxiliary verbs share some but not all inflections. The AUX head construction involves an auxiliary in finite verb construction, which in Kalapalo are person and aspect suffix
In this example the active equative copular verb in imperfective anticipation aspect atani, „entering into a process,‘ is auxiliary with the lexical verb tsa-, ‗listen‘ in a thetic construction. This is an example of Anderson‘s AUX head construction, as the auxiliary carries the imperfective ‗anticipated‘ aspect marker and person marking features (3rd person, as here, is Ø), not present in the

313

lexical verb. When in a copular verb construction, the CC and CS are shared.

a.

iŋila=lefa ta-tsa-ti

Ø-ata-ni

long.time=MT REF-listen-TH 3-EQA-ANT

‗She was going to be listening for a long time.‘

The following is an example of the i(ts)- existential root in 2nd person imperative used as auxiliary with the non-finite thetic form of the verb fo-ŋi, ‗cry‘ in an intransitive clause construction. This is an example of Anderson‘s ‗split construction‘ as the negative morpheme appears only on the lexical verb and only the auxiliary is constructed as an imperative. This is not a copular verb construction as there is no sharing of argument between the lexical and existential ‗be‘ verb.

b. i-ñuku-gu fo-nu-nda to-fo-ŋi-Ø-la

e-its-ue

her son-POSS cry-Vi-CI REF-cry-cause-TH-NEG 2-EX-I

Her son was crying. ‗Stop crying‘.

The next example shows the existential its- copular verb as an auxiliary on the transitive fully finite lexical verb in a subordinate clause. The lexical verb is fuke-: ‗track‘, ‗look for the trail of someone‘ in punctual indicative mood. However, the existential copular is in continuous indicative, indicating a progressive activity. The construction falls into Anderson‘s ‗split/double‘ construction type as the aspect/mood inflections are different for each verb but the person prefix is repeated. The full clause chain is given in (c).

c.

Taugi-feke fuke-fi-dyï, Aulukuma fuke-fi-dyï i-feke.

Taugi-ERG track-Vt-PI, Aulukuma track-Vt-PI 3-ERG

‗Taugi tracked him, he tracked Aulukuma .‘

‗That‘s what he kept on doing, that was what the older

brother was doing, tracking him in one place after another, the

older brother.‘

8.7. Contrasts between demonstrative and ‘be’ root predicational constructions
There are many instances of a ‗be‘ root used in predicational function with de-verbal aspectual nominalizations. In these verbless clausal constructions, the de-verbal nominalization predication is constructed by means of a main copular verb (sometimes itself nominalized). These predicational constructions are distinct from predications involving Kalapalo demonstratives, as described in Chapter 6. Here, I summarize the main features of the two types of predicational constructions, emphasizing their differences.

314

- ‗Be‘ root constructions may predicate other nominalized copular stems with both non-aspectual and aspectual derivational suffixes. As nouns, these copular derivational constructions seem to operate similarly to the pronominal or adnominal demonstratives. However, such constructions link two different situations, predicating their relationship, whereas demonstratives function to predicate nominal constructions, including referencing A or S.

- Unlike demonstratives, ‗be‘ root subjects and complements often host interclausal reference markers specifying continuity or discontinuity of arguments, thus participating in clause chaining. This is especially the case with regard to referencing the consequences or outcomes of stative and active events, including new clausal arguments.

A useful way to see the differences is through examples in which both demonstratives and ‗be‘ root inflected constructions appear.

a.

In this example the identificational demonstrative is a

relative clause modifier that references the initial lexical NP

as S of the final verbal predication, in which the stative

equative an- root (‗association‘)—in first person passing state

perfective nominalization—references the experience of the

speaker. There is no subordinate clause. The immediately

preceding interclausal reference morpheme =dya marks a

new, successive event. Here the initial ‗experiencer‘

intransitive verb nominalization becomes the S of the final

de-verbalized ‗be‘ verb.

i-Ge-ki-ñu ku-ki-tofo igei=ku=dya si-te-Ø 3-fishy-Vi-EXN 1+2-utter-USIN IDEM= INT=XN pity-Vt-
RES u-a-nïgï 1-EQS-PS

‗By a ‗fishy person‘ (as we say)*, I was thus shown real pity. ‗

Note: In other words, humans would see, and therefore call the being a ‗fish‘, but in the other underwater world it appeared human.

b. Here, there is also a change of argument function but the de-

verbal nominalization has been used to create a subordinate

clause (bracketed) so a demonstrative is not necessary. ere

The active equative verbal construction ata-ni

follows

a ‗voluntary process end result‘ de-verbal nominalization, the

subordinate clause that is followed by the main verb te-‗go

away‘ in potential aspect. The active equative copular verb

appears in imperfective anticipation aspect ‗enter into an

activity‘. The construction links the initial subordinated state

of affairs (sleeping) with the subsequent main event, ‗going

away‘.

315

te-lu-iɳo go.away-PI‘We must finish sleeping away‘.

POT five days before going

c. In this example, an interrogative utterance includes both the consequential nominalization of the equative stative copular verb followed immediately by the identificational demonstrative. The latter marks the preceding copular verb predication, ‗what happened to dear mother‘ as the complement of the main verb igi-, ‗sing‘ (which has become nominalized). The speaker is expressing shocked surprise that the singer of a mourning song knows how her mother died.

8.8. Summary: Copular predicate sets
The material presented in this chapter can be summarized in terms of the semantic types of predications associated with each of the copula morphemes belonging to the two syntactic types: suffix and verb.
Predications with copula suffix -i
- pronominal attributive - identificational attributive on nouns and nominalizations, - active verbs in desiderative, malefactive, hypothetical and
negation constructions -stative existential copular verb constructions

Copular verb predications
The predicational types of ‗be‘ roots in copula function can be summarized as follows:
a-: - resultative state, involving a human being -entry into a state
at: - ‗possession‘ of inalienable body parts (―head‖), - relationships (as kinship) - feelings, - association with ritual practices - events, practices, experiences carrying over from past into present and future
its- - temporary existential states (nominalized)

316
- transformative states (nominalized) - living, existing - state of mind
Some of the copula stems appear to be losing their copular function and taking on the functional character of adverbs. This is perhaps most true of the adverbial ag- root discussed in Chapter 12. Further study of adverbs that refer to ‗possession‘ or ‗ownership‘ and especially the logical character of a verbal predication (―reason‖ or ―result‖; contrast or comparison, and perhaps also denial and negation) is needed to discern possible past copular functions of some roots.

Chapter 9 Imperatives and Imperative Strategies

Kalapalo has a variety of both positive and negative imperatives, several hortative and invitational forms, and a didactic form. All these may be classified as „imperative‟ as verbs are inflected with one of several possible imperative suffixes. This type of construction is nominalaccusative. There are also numerous imperative strategies, distinguished by the fact that they have persuasive semantic functions but do not use the imperative inflection on verbs. Such utterances carry the intention of asking someone to do something (positive strategies), or to avoid or stop doing something (negative strategies). The contexts in which imperative strategies appear provide important information on the stance-forming interpersonal relations governing speaker‟s choices of particular forms, and the responses of interlocutors. There are no “direct” third person imperatives. Negative imperatives for third person are actually strategies that involve the use of the “rhetorical question” prefix tï-. Positive thirdperson imperative strategies often use a deontic and are associated with registers which involve special politeness on the part of speakers. Overall, imperative types may be ordered in terms of degrees of politeness or “softening” of a request, a pragmatic function of considerable importance for interpersonal relations of all kinds. The data in this section are taken from private conversations, didactic speech, and leaders‟ talk; some examples have been taken from narrative discourse Table 33 shows the set of preposed imperative interjections. There are two degrees of prohibition, and the hortatives are distinguished according to a proximate/distal contrast. In addition, there is an advisory which is usually neutral in sentiment.

9.1. Positive imperatives
Positive imperatives make use of “simple” suffixes on the verb stem: ke/ge; tsi/te and a pronominal proclitic in 2nd person singular (e-/a-/Ø); or 1st person plural: ku-, kukw, ukw. Word order is SV, with second arguments either before or after the VP. I am not sure what the differences are between the four „simple

318

suffixes‟, as there are no clear cut differences in meaning and use, nor are there phonological contrasts in their usage. I therefore consider them allomorphic.

ohsi-fa kukw-etimba- tïŋi-fa HORT-S 1+2-drink-I-PTP ‟Let‟s take something to refresh ourselves.‟

9.2 Second and third person deontic constructions

Deontic constructions express the sense of „I need to, have decided to do X‟, or „I want you/3rd person to do (or „X must do‟) X‟. These locutions
are somewhat more polite or less abrupt sounding than the examples in
the preceding section, with the second/third person patient deontic fesaŋe used together with the verb in imperative inflection. There is no use of 1st
person A or S deontic ake- ”need to”, or the adverbial desiderative suffix
–ti.

a.

agetsi fe-tsa-ŋe e-fïgi e-ŋige-ke,

one DEO-EX-I 2-arrow 2-take-I ‟You need to take only one of your arrows „

b. In this example the imperative follows the urgency clitic:

iŋi-tue=ge

fe-tsa-ŋe,

see/think-URG=R DEO-EX-I

‟You need watch out for that again!‟

9.3 Negative imperatives

Negative imperatives in Kalapalo are initiated with the preventative prefix ka- (roots beginning with /a/) or ke- (all other roots). They do not necessarily all show an imperative suffix.

9.3.1 Preventative

The preventative imperative uses the preventative prefix ke- on the verb. Some constructions use the imperative suffix on the stem (a,c), but not all. Example (b) has the preventative prefixed to a purposive construction, while examples (d) and (e) have nominalized verbs that are prefixed.

a.

ke-te-ŋa:

PREV-go away-I

„Don‟t go‟

b. ah, ke-nde-fi-tsomi

a-titsï-fofo

EXP, PREV-scrape-ADV-PURP 2-all over-IMM

„Be sure to prevent him from scraping you all over‟

c.

ke-ki-ge-fa

PREV-come.along-I-PTP

„Stop his coming along.‟

d. ke-itsi-ni-tsa≈le PREV-bite-PL-EX-UT „Keep them from biting.‟

e.

ke-ŋe-ni≈ts-ale

PREV-eat-PL≈EX-UT

„Keep them from eating.‟

9.3.2 Prohibitive

The second negative imperative, a strong prohibitive, „stop‟, „don‟t‟, is more commonly used than the first. Prohibitives are formed with the preventative prefix ka-, ke-, or ku- (elision of /e/ and assimilation following /a/ or /u/), the negative imperative suffix –ŋe on the verb, negative nominalization -iɳi and the deontic. These are distinguished

322

from preventatives in their use of the deontic and are all addressed to a second person, often regarding the actions of a third person.

9.3.3 Cautionary, odyo

The third negative imperative type is a cautionary, initiated by the interjection odyo, “stop” or “do no longer” (which can be reduplicated for emphasis and suffixed by the conformative taxis clitic =apa). This important way of giving caution references actions that have already been performed and thus potentially could be continued by the addressee. There is no pause between this interjection and the rest of the clause.

a. This example shows the interjection followed by a finite transitive indicative verb e-, angry.

odyo-apa kuaku e-ŋalï

e-feke

stop-CONF nightjar angry-REP 2-ERG

„Don‟t be angry with the nightjars any longer the way you want

to.‟

Note: This example is ambiguous because it could also mean, „Don‟t make the nightjars angry with you.‟; and also because the conformative taxis can mean „as I do/want‟: „Do what I say and don‟t get angry with the nightjars.‟ The next example shows an intransitive verb in punctate indicative mood, and (c) shows a verb marked as a simple positive imperative.

b. odyo-apa ege-a e-ki-lï. stop-CONF DEM-E 2-utter-PI “Don‟t talk any more like this, the way you want.”

c.

odyo-apa egea la-fa

e-i-tse, odyo.

stop-CONF this way-NEG-PTP 2-be-I, don‟t

„You mustn‟t want to do that any longer, stay like this, stop.‟

My data include one example, shown in (d), that seems to combine the first and second types of negative imperatives; this example also shows how the initial lexeme can be reduplicated for intensification effect and also that with this reduplication there is no further inflection as there is a pause before the rest of the clause.

d. odyo-dyo, ke-ila-ki-ni EXP-EXP, PREV-like. that-utter-ANT „Stop, stop, don‟t speak that way any longer.‟

9.3.4. Warning, okoh
This is a similar construction to 9.3.3, but the warning is stronger because it is introduced by the the more intensive warning expressive okoh.
okoh-mbe-ni afïtï EXP-SS-ANT denial “You‟d better not want to do that, no.”(Be careful what you wish for).
9.3.5. Adversative, afïtï
The fifth negative imperative is an adversative, using the “denial” adverbial afïtï (which in clausal constructions appears as a circumfix” afïtï...la. (“I disagree that, it‟s not so that...”).; This morpheme can occur with first person (a) and (b) or second person (c) (in indicative inflections the third person is also possible). Example (b) also has the clause-chaining materials affixed to the adverbial; the special use of the copular verb in the final clause is a kind of curse “Let it be as it is”, or “so it shall remain” a. afïtï uge-la, afïtï uge-la
DEN me-NEG, DEN me-NEG „I won‟t, I won‟t.‟

324

b. afïtï-mbekudy=ake-tsaŋe la-mbe=tsa-ni. DEN-NOMR=SD-DEO like that-SS-EXCL-ANT „And that‟s why it looks like it would be bad for us to (eat it) when it‟s like this, leave it as it is.”(i.e., “Because it‟s so bitter to eat), leave it as it is.‟

c.

afïtï-fa itau-iña

itsa-ki-lu-iŋo-la

denial-PTP woman-DAT/BEN run-Vi-PI-POT-NEG

„You won‟t run after a woman/‟

9.4 Hortative and invitational forms
These begin with the proximate ohsi (action close by) or distal ogi (action away from the speaker) (both glossed HORT). They are always singular or plural (the latter with –ni suffix) second person (probably marked by the initial o proclitic). The inclusive/exclusive second person plural distinction is collapsed to inclusive; plural forms are commonly used to address a group of people. These initial forms are often inflected with the immediate taxis clitic =fofo "right now"; "before anything else", and apa, confirmational taxis. The verb is usually in imperative inflection.

9.4. 1 Proximates

a.

The first example is a 2nd person singular hortative.

ohsi e-ĩ-tse-apa efitsu ki-lï HORT 2-eat fruit-I-CONF wife utter-PI
“Go ahead and eat if you want (like everyone else),” his wife said.

b. The speaker here uses an interesting idiomatic plural word ña-fene formed with normally suffixed dative/benefactive - iña + what may be an irregular imperative suffix –fe + plural -ne. (“you all move in my direction”.)

ohsi =ña-fe-ne, uwa-ma i-kugu-pe i-nïgï? HORT DAT-I-PL, what-EM 3-arm-SAL do-PERF „Let‟s all get together here, should something be done with one of his arms?‟

c. ohsi-ni itsa-ke-ge HORT-PL measure-I “Go ahead and measure it, you all”.

Examples (3d) and (3e) are second person plural as marked with ne/ni

accusative suffix on the verb. d. una-ni ipï=wï

te-ŋalï

where-PL son-father go.away-MAL-PI

‟To where did our son‟s fathers go off?‟

e.

ohsi-fa te-ke-ne

ŋi-ta-ko-fofo

HORT-SR go away-I-PL see-CI-PL-IMM

„You should all go away to look at them right now.‟

f.

ohsi-fa kukwe-timba-tïŋi-fa

HORT-SR 1+2-drink-INC-I-PTP

„Let‟s all drink it.‟

9.4.2. Distals

The distal hortative, using ogi, involves a first person plural action to be performed elsewhere than the speech event.

a.

ogi-fa k-ige-ke,

Ø-nïg=i-feke

DH-S 1+2-go back-I, say to-PERF=3-ERG

„Let‟s all go back together now.‟

b. ogi ña

ogi la-iña

e-ge-tue.

HORT-DAT HORT over there-DAT 2-come.along-I-URG

„Go over there, all of you, come along quickly.‟

9.4.3 Leaders‟ hortatives

In the leaders‟ talk or shamanic oratorical style, rather than ohsi, hortatives regarding action to take place away from the settlement are often imperatives in which the second person collective is preceded by the vocative use of the word for “children”; and a first person inclusive imperative suffix –(t)ndïŋi co-referencing the 1+2 prefix.

The following example is taken from a shamanic leader‟s talk:

a.

kïŋamukwe, kïŋamukwe

„Children, children‟

ah, ukwa-iku-ndïŋi-fofo, ukwa-iku-ndïŋi-ni EXP, 1+2-perform-INC-IMM, 1+2-perform-INC-ANT ‟Believe me, the very next thing we will do is perform, we‟ll be performing very soon.‟

The following are some examples of a woman leader‟s oratorical style, in which the group is addressed vocatively as “my younger sisters”:

b

uum, u-ikena-mo, la ña-fofo

e-ge-tuete.

EXP, 1-yz-PL, over.there-DAT-IMM 2-come.to-URG

„I‟m thinking my younger sisters, you should all come over there

right away.’

326

c. uum u-ikena-mo, ipa-gï-fofo

ku- ñui-tïŋi

EXP 1-y sisters-PL, lake-POSS-IMM 1+2-make-I;PL

„I‟m thinking my sisters, the very next thing we will do is begin

to make a lake for ourselves.‟

9.5 Didactic warnings

The fourth general type of imperative is a didactic warning, urging the listener to do something correctly or well. These constructions begin with the complement iŋke “look/think/consider” in imperative inflection, followed by a verbal clause or noun phrase describing action over which the addressee will have some control.

a.

iŋke-fa

u-iñaŋo

look/think-EMP 1-starchy.food

„Think about my own food.‟

b. iŋ-ge-dye

fe-tsaŋe,

api-lu-iŋo e-feke

look.think-I-XA OD-DEO,club-PI-POT 2-ERG

e-iña isi-tote. 2-DAT 3-come.towards-HYP
„You‟ll have to (I want you to) look right at them (because) you will club them if they come towards you.‟

In 9.the complement “look/think about”, with its primary topical participant suffix and deontic, precedes the action desired by the speaker. That action is not framed directly in imperative mood, but in potential mood on the finite verb.

9.6 Imperative Strategies
Most of the imperatives described in the preceding sections are associated with extreme familiarity and informality, with speech to young children or intimates. This informal speech sounds somewhat abrupt in the context of the need for special civility to visitors and especially to relatives by marriage. (Abruptness may also be marked by the use of the “affective” clitics marking urgency or frustration). Negative strategies in third person make use of the yes-no “rhetorical question” interrogative, but in contrast to these, most imperative strategies are politeness strategies of one degree or another. This conforms to the reluctance of Kalapalo to make overtly strong demands on one another, to the question of to whom one may legitimately make requests in the first place, and what those requests may concern. Other pragmatic functions, such as triadic communication associated with affinal avoidance (Basso 2007), and hortatory discourse associated with both hereditary and shamanic leadership influence the actual use of imperatives. More polite imperative strategies (including negatives) may add deontics (as in earlier examples), or frame the required activity as a

potential or anticipated/inchoative event, avoiding the simple imperative form entirely (5.1).

9.6.1 Polite negative imperative strategy

1.

Negative with 2nd person uses a negative adverbial prefix

a. With the temporal negative adverbial and purposive verb inflection –tsomi on the equative copular verb:

opïgï ege its-omi last time you EX-PURP „This is the last time you‟ll want to be this way.‟

b. With denial circumflex adverb: there is an apparent negative emphasis with this form, as if the speaker is rejecting an idea of the addressee:

afïtï-fa itau-iña

itsaki-lu-iŋo-la

denial-PTP woman-DAT/BEN run to-PI-POT-NEG

„You will NOT try and run towards (i.e., in pursuit of) (any

woman).‟

9.6.2. Positive imperative strategies

9.6.2.1 okaŋi: , „you wait‟

This is an advisory imperative strategy; the verbal construction is not necessarily in imperative mood, as in the following example.

a. o-kaŋi-fofo ŋ-ita-ni

e-ŋis-au

ŋ-ita-ni

2-wait-T PB- get-ANT 2-grandmother-PL PB-get-ANT

„Wait just a while longer, while I go get your grandmothers, go

get (them).‟

9.6.2.2. Positive first person suggestion
This construction includes the reason in a dependent clause:
uge=fofo fotugu-i, ñ-i-tomi-fofo me=IM first-CL PB-see-PURP-IMM “I‟ll go first, in order to watch them”
9.6.2.3 Second person strategy
This occurs with the first or second person S or A deontic postposition aketsaŋe.

328

a.

t-ufitsu-feke, u-te-lu≈ke-tsaŋe

fuati-fofo

REFL-wife-ERG, 1-go.away-PI≈SD-DEO-EX-I shaman-IM

u-te-lu 1-go away-PI, „To his wife he said, “I must go (have decided to go) away to do my shamanic work, I‟m going”

(wife answers: te-ke=apa, Ø-nïg≈i--feke) go.away-I=CONF,

say.to-PS≈3-ERG

„Go if that‟s what you want to do”, she

answered.‟

b. ande-fa

ake-tsaŋe

e-me-ŋe-te here/now-PTP

SD-DEO-EX-I 2-soak-CAUS-I

‟Now it would be good for you

to (I want you to) soak this.‟

c.

In this example, the first person polite positive imperative

strategy (i) is followed (ii) by the reason complement:

i. kogetsi ake-tsaŋe

u-te-lu-iŋo

a-fatuwї-ake.

tomorrow SD-DEO-EX-I 1-go.away-PI-POT 2-nephew-

COM

„Tomorrow I‟ve decided to leave with your nephew.‟

ii. eŋï u-guwa-ki-tomi, reason 1-squeeze.mash-Vt-PURP „Because I want to prepare some starch.‟

d. Another example in which the purposive verbal construction suggests a first person imperative, not overtly marked

ah, ŋi-tomi

et-i-me-tofo-iŋo, ŋi-tofo

EM, PB-see-PURP 2-kill-Vt-USIN-POT, PB-see-USIN

„I surely want to see what you will use to kill (people), I want to

see that.‟

In this example a woman‟s mother agrees with the intention of her daughter:

e. ah, efisï- tomi-papa ege-na e-iña INT, 2- YBrPURP-CONF PDEM-ALL 2-DAT/BEN
„If you want him to go to you as your little brother (i.e., new husband), that‟s certainly all right with me.‟

9.6.2.4 The polite second person plural or dual imperative strategy
This strategy is used with triadic communication typical of the affinal civility register. The deontic postposition fetsaŋe implicitly references a third person who requests that the addressee perform an action. In this example the imperative is formed with the existential copula + desiderative deontic postposition followed by the intransitive verb

describing the event in question. Since the daughter is speaking to her father, it is all right for her to use the casual imperative.

a.

apa, Ø-nïg≈i-feke. e-iko-ŋuŋGe-tu

(voc), say.to-PS≈3-ERG 2-firewood-collect-I-DIS

father

fe-tsaŋe,

eiko-ŋuŋ-Ge

OD-DEO-EX-I, 2-firewood-collect-I

“Father”, she said to him. “You need to go get your firewood

somewhere, collect your firewood.”

9.6.2.5 First person suggestion with contra-spective epistemic

A kind of very soft first person suggestion in which the contra-factual epistemic clitic mukwe (hope in vain) is used. This imperative strategy is
particularly associated with leader‟s talk.

a.

A leader speaks to the father of a child expressing the wishes of

their community:

taloki= mukwe figei eŋï= mukwe-fa e-mugu tï-i-lï no reason-EM ADEM reason-EM-PTP 2-son put-VT-PI

ku-pehe, Ø-nïg≈i-feke 1+2-ERG, say.to-PS≈3-ERG “Although there‟s no reason to hope this will work, we could perhaps place (i.e., prepare, train) your son, “ he said to him.

b. From a leader‟s public ceremonial dialogue describing his provision of food to the community in the role of a kagutu oto, „flute sponsor‟. His use of the initial adverbial construction is a form of humbling himself:

taloki=mukwe-ku=aka Gitse

e-ui-ta u-feke

useless=EM-INT=EM unfortunate 1-make-CI 1-ERG

“Unfortunately although there‟s no reason at all, as you

can see I am making it badly.”

c. In this example it is not a leader speaking, but a mother to her daughter. Here the use of the epistemic marker seems to convey the sense of a mild suggestion rather than an epistemic “wish in vain”:

ohsi-muk≈aitaifa

ifiŋu

ka-ŋ-api-ga

HORT-EM≈URG-PTP salt plants CONT-PB-beat-CI

“Perhaps we should hurry before the salt plants have been beaten

(i.e., processed).”

9. 7. Grammatical features of imperatives

330
In this section I review the features of imperatives that are shared with other illocutionary force constructions, and those that are distinctive or particularly common to imperatives.
9.7.1. Shared features with the same meaning
Several features are shared by imperative constructions with the indicative mood. These include the affective clitic =su (compulsory, pejorative); the affective particle Gitse, „unfortunate‟; and the taxis clitic =fofo (immediately following); c) the negative circumfix afïtï...la (“wrong about X) and negative iñalï („didnt/isn‟t...X‟).
9.7.2. Features distinctive or particularly common to imperatives
1. Clitics: the conformative taxis –papa (past ref, „I agree‟); apa- (potential reference, „as you wish‟; „do as I/others do‟‟); affective clitics: impatience or frustrative copular verb –ata-i and the encouraging or “urging”–tïe.
2. Use of the imperative suffix (and the „urgency‟ affective clitic –tue) precludes presence of other aspect/mood suffixes; however, indicative, anticipated/ inchoative, and potential suffixes on the verb appear in imperative strategies
3. As seen in many examples above, the deontics aketsaɳe and fetsaɳe occur frequently with imperative strategies.
4. The epistemic marker -mukwe “perhaps” is sometimes used with a particular “soft” imperative strategy, as a “suggestion” rather than a counter-factual as in other moods.
9.7.3 Transitivity features
Split ergativity influences imperatives, which do not take ergative features; indicative and declarative ergative-absolutives becomes nominative-accusatives.
9.8. Comments
Imperatives share most pronominal prefixes with finite verbs, ,. but some pronominal prefix categories are not shared (particularly, the second person exclusive plural). Imperatives also share verbal

inflections. Some of the shared forms take slightly different extended meanings in the imperativ: =fofo can convey the sense of satisfaction with an action; (EM)conveys the sense of the speaker making a mild suggestion. There is no motion/non-motion distinction in positive imperatives (nor prohibitives) as in the Carib languages Apalaí or Hixkaryana. However, there is a proximate-distal contrast with hortatives. Kalapalo hortatives would be interesting to compare with the proximate-distal pronominal and adnominal demonstrative contrast.

331

Chapter 10 Interrogative Constructions
This chapter reviews the types of Kalapalo questions and the different kinds of constructions used in each type. Kalapalo question types include 1) “polar” questions requiring yes or no answers; 2) information questions, which use preposed u- initial ( “wh-”) lexical roots requiring specific indicative answers, and 3) „rhetorical questions‟ using the tïroot on preposed grammatical words. Each of the question words appears in clause initial position. The terms used by Carlin to describe similar material in Trio (2004: 229) are useful here, although the „rhetorical question‟ type was not distinguished for that language (some cognates do appear in her Table 7. 1, p. 234). As Carlin described for Trio, each question type in Kalapalo has both distinctive syntax and discursive function, as seen by the fact that each type of question tends to be answered in a particular way.

10. 1. Polar questions Polar questions only require an agreement response (eh he), a simple “yes” response (eh), or a “denial” (afïtï), though each of these may be followed by a repeat and elaboration of some of the content of the original question. Polar questions are shaped by a distinctive intonational contour, with rising intonation in final syllables (marked by “?” in the examples). Example (a) is a very common question of this form, consisting of the resultative complement adverb aɳi, „anything?‟ ‟result?; has it been accomplished?‟ in initial clause position. Lines (i-iii) are taken from a conversation between a small child and its aunt:

a.

i. aŋi tuwa a-fi-ta?:

result water 2-pour.in-CI?

„Are you pouring water?‟

ii. eh, tuwa a-hu-ne-ta

u-feke:

yes, water pou..in-CAUS-CI 1-ERG

„yes, I‟m making the water pour in.‟

iii. eh, a-hi-ta=lefa. yes, 2-pour-CI=MT „Yes, you‟re pouring.‟

b. Another brief conversation in which the result adverbial is used:
i. aŋi fogi-kafa fekite uege? result find-EM nice you „You were all right, weren‟t you?‟
ii. eh, ama, yes, mother (voc) „Yes (I was), Mother.‟

332

c. This example shows a more complex complement construction. The question in (c) has two parts: a) have the interloctors seen some third parties, and (b) have those persons come to the present location. The answer thus involves both parts: the responders haven‟t seen the third parties, and those persons haven‟t come to the present location.

i. aŋi-nika inde u-oku-ŋi-ta

i-ŋi-lї

result-EM here 1-liquid food=make-Vt-CI 3-see-PI

e-feke-ni 2-ERG-PL „Could it be that you‟ve all seen those who make my food around here?‟

ii. ñalï, ñalï inde s-in-ïŋ;go denial denial here 3-come-PS;PL „We haven‟t, no-one‟s (they haven‟t) come here.‟

d. This example shows the same adverbial copular root in the form aɳ-olo. It is not clear what the function of the final suffix may be.

aɳ-olo=nika ete-lї-ko? EQS-true?=EM go.away-PI-PL „Is it true you are both going away‟?

e.

A common greeting that is a kind of polar question involves the

use of the epistemic clitic =nika, „probably, appealing to the

listener‟s own experience‟ hosted by the local demonstrative

ande, „here.now‟. The speaker is asking for assurance that the

person she sees is really her brother (not some dangerous

powerful being in disguise, as Kalapalo thought could happen ).

The man arriving answers his sister using the conformation

epistemic clitic =taka:

dyadya ande=nika uege Obr, here.now=EM you ‘Older Brother, are you here now?‟

Eh ande=taka u-e-ta e-iŋi-lї-ko-iña. yes, here.now=EM 1-come-CI 2-see-PI-PL-DAT/BEN „Yes, as you see now I‟m coming here to see you all.‟

10.2 Informational and rhetorical question constructions
Information content questions and rhetorical question constructions (including the contrastive type of construction, which may be considered a rhetorical subtype) all use a variety of preposed lexical „question words‟ or prefixes.

333
Table 34 gives a list of the attested Kalapalo question words. Distinctive to these question words is the epistemic generalized „uncertainty‟ clitic – ma. Monomorphemic informational question words are all glossed „Q‟; the initial morpheme in rhetorical question words is glossed „RQ‟. There are in addition two contrastive question words listed in the Table. The initial morphemes of these words are seemingly related to RQ, and this gloss is used to mark them.

10.2.1. Information content questions
Speakers using u- (wh-) words (Q) emphasize the wish or need for information by setting the u- initial word this is always in first position in the clause. .. These words are usually compounded with an adverbial suffix and/or an epistemic and affective morpheme. Intonational contours are similar to indicative utterances, with a falling intonation at the end of the utterance. Furthermore, answers to questions using Q tend to be more elaborate, insofar as the question is a request for information about reason, source, location, time, direction, amount, identity. Q words often (but not invariably) host epistemic clitics, most frequently the „uncertainty‟ clitic =ma, which marks uncertainty about the topic (S, A or O), and the negative mirative suffix -ki . Also attested are constructions with the interclausal reference marker =mbe, (SS), the „facsimile‟ suffix -me, and a variety of nominal and adverbial suffixes. There is no pluralization marker on the question word even if the argument is plural.

10.2.1.1 uwa, ‘what’, ‘why’ questions

Use of the question word in isolation. This usage occurs without any immediately following pejorative, epistemic, negative mirative or interclausal reference morphemes:

a. uwa u-e-ŋal-ï e-feke-ni Q 1-shoot-REV 2-ERG-PL „Why did you all shoot back at me?‟

b. uwa fitsa-tu=kiŋi

fegei-i, Ø-nïg≈i-feke

Q hallucination-N=EM ADEM-CL, say. to-PS≈3-ERG

„“Why is this hallucination here?”, he asked himself.‟

Use of uwa with the negative mirative suffix -ki, „what in the world‟:

c. uwa-ki i-ña-l=igei what-MIR 3-ALL-UT=IDEM „What in the world is that which keeps coming here?‟

With the „uncertainty‟ epistemic clitic =ma:

d. uwa=ma uk-iŋandsu t-ï-i-ŋalï-lefa

ku-pehe-ne

Q=EM 1+2-sister REFL-do-Vt-REV-MT 1+2-ERG-PL

g. This example shows reduplication of the uwa-ma-word in a situation of puzzlement:

Uum, uwa=ma-wa=ma itsa ≈le egei EXP, Q=EM-Q=EM EX-CI=UT IDEM „I can‟t understand why in the word he‟s always like that.‟

„Look at me and you will see that an alligator bit me.‟

j. uwa=mbe-ki, „what in the world is going on‟.

This construction uses the interclausal reference clitic =mbe (SS) marking continuity of arguments and the negative mirative suffix –ki.:

a. uwa-mbe-ki ku-tsa-ko

figei

Q-SS-MIRN 1+2-EX;CL-PL ADEM

“What ever got us here?”

b. A person speaking to herself about her predicament. In the first line (i.), the speaker uses the negative mirative construction uwa-mbe-ki, „what in the world is going on...‟

i.uwa-mbe-ki i-tsa igei Q=SS-MIRN EX-CI IDEM
“What in the world is doing that”?

ii. u-iña=tale atïtï egei. 1-ALL=DD good ADEM “What‟s coming towards me isn‟t something good”.

k. uwa=me-ni, ‘what sort of thing did..X‟.

Showing the facsimile suffix –me and active agent nominalization –ni in the question word construction: ‟

uwa-me-ni tu-i-pïgï

l.. uwa-ne (Q-CONT) , „what difference‟ , uwa-n≈e-itsa. u-ïgï-nu-nda=mbe. Q-CONT≈ 2-be. 1-sick-PI-SS „What’s wrong with you?’ ‘I’m sick is what’s happening.’

m.. uwa=su-ki, ‘What in the world is this fool doing?‟

The use of the pejorative, compulsive affective clitic =su is a means of marking the S head of the interrogative. In addition, this construction includes a „negative mirative‟ –ki suffix:

a.

uwa=su-ki apa-dyu-ko

i-tsa-ko egei-i

Q-PEJ-MIRN father-END-PL EX-CL-PL IDEM-CL

„What in the world are those fools our dear fathers doing to

themselves?‟

n. uwa=su=ma , „ does this fool always do this??‟

This construction shows the Q word hosting the pejorative, compulsive clitic followed by the uncertainty epistemic clitic, so not used with a surprised response to an event as 10.2.1.5.

i.

uwa=su=ma-ku-tsa-ko

Q-PEJ=EM-INT-EX;CL-PL

„Why are they always like this?‟

ii.. With the contrastive suffix –na (CONT):

uwa=su=ma-na etsi t-u-i-lï=mbe-s≈i-ñïgï Q=PEJ=EM-CONT auntie REF-do-Vt-PI=SS-PEJ ≈ EX-TR „Instead he kept doing what to Auntie?, He‟s always doing something weird to himself.‟

10.2.1.2. unde “where” questions

This question word belongs to the set of local adverbial demonstratives described in Chapter 6.6.

a. unde „where‟ hosting clitics, no inflections

These constructions involve unde hosting epistemic and affective clitics, without inflectional suffixes:

i.

unde=ka:h a-nïgï

where=FRUST EQS-VPE

„Where in the world could he be?‟

338
ii. unde=laka saŋakafi Ø-nïg ≈i-feke where=EM bamboo say.to-PS ≈3-ERG „ “Is it possible there‟s some bamboo around here?”, he asked
her.‟
iii. With plural S, the plural suffix follows immediately upon the Q word:
unde-ko-ka:h=nïŋgo where-PL-FRUST-EX-PI;PL „Where could they all be?‟
iv. Plural S is marked but there is also the pejorative suffix following the plural suffix. In this case, the former maintains its pejorative meaning:
unde-ko-su=ma where-PL-PEJ-EM “Where are those fools?”
b. unde =ma
This is a question word that references doubt about a place.
i.. unde=ma e-fisï-ko a-nïgï Q=EM 2-Ybr-PL EQS-VPE „Where could your younger brother have gone?‟
ii.. This example has a declarative meaning though it is formed with the unde=ma question word, translated here “where-ever”:
unde=ma fïgi ata-ni Ø-api-ŋa-lï i-feke where-EM weapon ECL-PL 2-attack-NEG-PI 3-ERG „Where-ever my gun will be, he will (never?) attack you.‟
iii. In this example, the third person distal pronon ele follows immediately upon the Q word:
unde≈le=ma where-PDEM=EM “Where is he?‟
c. unde=mbe, „where done?’
This construction includes the interclausal reference marker =mbe (SS) referencing continuity of argument.
i.. unde-mbe=k=an-ïgï where=SS=FRUST-be-PERF „Where can he be after that?‟

339

ii. upï, unde=mbe-ku-ki a-nïgï EXPL, where=SS-INT-MIRN EQS-VPE „It‟s been a long time, where in the world could he be (having gone away)?‟

d. unde-ni, „where is the doer)?’

This construction uses the active nominalization derivation (-ni) suffixed to Q.

i.

unde-ni ku-pasï-ko

a-nïgï

where-AN 1+2-nephew-PL EQS-VPE

e.. und-oŋo, ‘from what place (whence)‟, source, origin

This is a compound in which the question word is joined with the nominative locative –oŋo (NLOC); the speaker requests information about a source or origin.

response: ande “Here by me”.

10.2.3. uŋu ,„who‟, „what questions

a. uŋu uninfected.

This Q word is often used alone, followed by the ergative suffix, thereby reference a question about a transitive subject (A):

uŋu-feke k≈ege,

Ø-nïg≈i-feke,

Q-ERG FRUST≈ADEM, 3-PERF-3-ERG

„Who‟s that (you‟re talking about)?” he asked to her.‟

b. uŋu-fuŋu, „what kind‟, „how many‟, „how much‟

This is a nominalization of the Q word, with the „resemble‟ suffix -fuɳu.

i.. uŋu-fuŋu e-їɳї-lu-iɳo inde Q-resemble 2-sleep-PI-POT here „How many days will you be here?‟ (lit, what kind of your sleeping here?)

ii. uŋu-fuŋu=ma-lak≈ige-i Q-resemble=EM=EM≈PDEM-CL „What kind of thing could this be?‟

iii. uŋu-fuŋu=ma-lak=ago-i what-resemble-EM-EM=person-CL „What kind of person could he be?‟

When requesting a person‟s ethnic identity, a Kalapalo speaker would say, uŋu-fuŋu=ma uege, “what kind of person are you?”

c. uŋu-fuŋu-ne, „what kind of X does...‟?

This construction uses the contrastive suffix –ne. The predicate is contrasted with something else the speaker has already referenced.

uŋu-fuŋu-ne

itopu-i e-ŋ-ili-ñalї-i

Q-resemble-CONT squash-CL 2-PB-drink-MAL-CL

„How can squash serve as your beverage?‟

10.2.4. una, ‘where to‟ questions
This Q word seems to be constructed from an archaic interrogative prefix u- and the allative case marker, -na.

a. una uninflected

una kaŋu-ti=tale≈gei

„That‟s why we two will go away.‟

c. una-ni., „Why do you do X‟?
This is an active nominalization of this question word. The active subject (S or A) is marked on una with –ni, active verb nominalizer („doer‟)

10.3. tï “rhetorical questions’
What I call „rhetorical questions‟ are interrogatives used when the speaker does not seem to want or need a specific answer, either because (s)he knows the answer, or because there is simply no appropriate response. Often the response to such a question is: eh, la-tsï, “yes, that‟s how it is” or, eh alati, „yes, that‟s what is wanted‟. However, responses do sometimes contain information (3.2.a,b; 3.3.b,c). Like the Q words, the rhetorical question morpheme is always initial in the clause construction. It may stand alone, but more usually it is followed by nominal and adverbial suffixes as well as the facsimile suffix -me. Like Q words, the tï forms are often immediately followed by the “uncertainty” epistemic marker –ma and the negative mirative suffix –ki. The assertive expressive ah, „surely‟, also often appears before the tïcompound. The intonational contour in the rhetorical type of question is the same as the indicative statement contour, that is, without a rising tone at the end. These locutions are not requests for information or explanations, and are often responses to events the speaker cannot understand (for example, unexpected mourning by people entering a settlement). Rhetorical questions can also be used rather scornfully, when the speaker‟s approval is lacking. In the following examples, I use the preceding utterance to make it clear why the speaker wishes to use the rhetorical question form.

a. t≈aɳo-ti=ma, „so that‟s where X was?‟ This seems to be a t-√-ti adverbial construction, but the presence of the „doubt‟ epistemic clitic =ma turns it into a rhetorical question.

t ≈aɳo-ti=ma

u-at-ehe

RQ≈NLOC-ADV=EM 1-EQA-PER

“So this is where I‟ve ended up?‟

b. tï-eku-ni, „so why ever did the doer..? ‟

In this construction, an adverbial eku-,„intensive‟ suffix follows the RQ morpheme, followed by the active nominalization.

10.4 Use of contrastive prefix ta-

Closely related to these rhetorical question constructions are others constructed with the contrastive prefix ta- (CONT). They resemble rhetorical questions insofar as the speaker is not really asking for information:

10.5 A conversational example
The following conversational excerpt is taken from a narrative told by Kudyu at Aifa in 1982, about a man who changed himself into a painted catfish. This example illustrates how different interrogatives are used and responded to. The excerpt also illustrates (in lines h-i) how epistemic markers are used to express puzzlement within the indicative mood. Line (b) illustrates people questioning sounds of grieving. Line (c) is the response of the mourners to them, that they are truly grieving for their relative. Line (d) begins with a Q word (uwa “what”), in which the speakers ask for concrete information about what happened to the man, followed by the indicative answers in lines (d-f). In line (g), those who remained behind in the settlement ask the returning mourners for more information, followed by the puzzled responses in lines (g-i).

10.6 Summary
The four types of questions may be distinguished by their discourse settings, particularly, the pragmatic goal of the speaker and the type of response from a listener. In addition, they appear in clause initial position, and are subject to similar syntactic and grammatical inflectional features. Finally, interrogative constructions reference S, A or O.
As seen from Table 33, the question morphemes uwa, unde, uɳu-, una, and tï-, and the contrastive ta- may be easily constructed

347
further with nominalizer, epistemic and adverbial suffixes. One set of Nominalizers include: -ni, active S or A nominalizer; fuŋu, „resemble‟, locative –(o)ŋo, -ne, oppositive nominalizer. Also used are the facsimile –me and =mbe, the „continuity of arguments‟ (SS) interclausal reference marker, and several epistemic and affective morphemes including the –ki negative mirative, and -su pejorative. Attested in these data are: the epistemic clitics =ma, „doubt‟, =male (adversative), =taka (agreement), and =laka (puzzlement) and the epistemic expletive ka:h (frustrative).

Chapter 11 Adverbs and Adverbializations
As in many languages, Kalapalo adverbs, one of the smaller word classes, is heterogeneous morphosyntactically, semantically, and grammatically. The class is essentially defined according to semantic features, including the usual adverbial meanings: time, place, manner, purpose, reason, and condition. In this chapter, I discuss monomorphemic adverbs, adverbial suffixes, adverbial postpositions, and three types of adverbial clauses. Many “adverbial meanings” in Kalapalo are conveyed through members of other word classes, including verbs, nouns, and especially affective and taxis clitics (the latter referencing phasal relations between events, described at length in Chapter 3.4) The place of adverbialization in word-class changing derivations is important. There is a closed sub-set of underived adverbs, but many Kalapalo adverbs have been derived from verbs and from nouns. At the same time, Kalapalo adverbs may themselves be nominalized, or re-nominalized, when they have been derived from nouns.

11.1. Distinctive features of Kalapalo adverbs

While heterogeneous, there are certain syntactic features which justify thinking of adverbs as a distinct word class. These special adverbial features are listed as follows:

11.1.1 Adverbs in clause constituent order

-

The most important and distinctive feature is the place of the

adverb in clause constituent order. Most adverbs and

adverbializations appear in utterance initial or final clausal

position

(but preceding an ergative-marked transitive

subject NP). The following example shows the use of the

adverb „no reason‟ initiating a single clause construction:

taloki ekugu-ŋu igia

u-ife-tu-ndomi.

useless fully-DIM manner 1-clear a planting area-N-PURP

„It‟s completely useless my trying to make a clearing like this.‟.

When in final clausal position, adverbs modify the specific VP they follow, as in the following example (modified VP in brackets):

349
tsiu tsiu tsiu (sound of scraping body) [is-aupï-gï fifi-dyu] katote ekugu tu-fa-ti 3-GF-POSS scrape-PI all fully REF-completely-ADV „Tsiu tsiu tsiu, his grandfather scraped him completely all over his body.‟
In utterance initial position, adverbs have scope over complex clause constructions that involve more than one clause. The next example shows the adverb aɳi, „result‟ initiating a complex chain:

aŋi-me si-tïfïgï

takwagï aŋu-ne-tigi,

result-FACS 3-come.to-IMP long flute play-Vt-SUP,

aŋi.

result.

„It seems as if they have come here to play the flutes,

that‟s why

In constructions initiated by an interrogative, interjection, demonstrative, or ideophone, the adverbs immediately follow. There are two adverbial constructions that appear as circumfixed.

The „denial‟ adverbs (afïtï V-la, which modifies verbs, and afïtï N-fïŋï, which modifies nouns) seem to be true circumfixes, the only ones attested in Kalapalo.

afïtï itau-fïŋï denial-woman-unlike „No, not women.‟

11.1.2 Adjunct functions

Adverbs function as adjuncts of noun phrases and verb phrases (including „be‟ verb phrases) and of ideophones. Noun phrases that accept adverbial modifiers are demonstratives and de-verbal aspectual nominalizations.

a. The example illustrates the use of an adverbial adjunct with a demonstrative (this is the anaphoric demonstrative (ANA):

tï-po-ngo

uɳele-fa ñïm-ingo.

REF-on.top-ADV ANA-PTP EX-TR-POT

„He will be on top of him‟.

350

b. This example shows an adverb as a verbal adjunct:

lepe kuG-iti=lefa

ifa-ga-ki-ga≈tïfïgï

i-feke-ni.

next all.together-ADV=MT pull.on-Vt-CAUS≈IMP 3-ERG-

PL

„Next, they had pulled up everything together.‟

c. This example is of an adverb adjunct of „be‟ verb:

ata-ni titafo, ata-ni. EQA-ANT standing, EQA-ANT „standing up there‟,

Adverbs can modify one another by simple juxtaposition, in which case one adverbial morpheme occupies first position and the other second position in the (single) clause that is being modified. There are some adverbs which may be followed by an adverbial suffix. The following example shows a string of adverbial morphemes: first the monomorphemic adverb ifaki, „far‟, followed by the negative suffix –la, and finally the postposed ekugu „fully, completely‟. In this example the first adverb is marked with the metonymic taxis clitic =lefa (MT); the pair modifies the final de-verbalized noun.

d. tok tok,

ifaki-la≈kugu=lefa

„Tok tok, shooting not at all far from him, the last of

11.1.3 t-√-ADV constructions -There are certain suffixed morphemes (-ki, -fi, -ti, -mi) distinctive to
adverbializations in their position in the grammatical word. However, many adverbial roots appear to have lost any crossclass meaning. Associated with these adverbial suffixes is the „reflexive‟ construction [t-√-ADV], in which the semantically bleached reflexive prefix occurs on the root, which is followed by one of these adverbial suffixes. the root may be a verb, noun, or adverbial construction. These constructions reference attributives of the head.
verbal root: t-ugupo-tsi, REF-fill.up-ADV „filled up‟
adverbial root: t-uguku-mi REF-bruise-ADV „the bruising‟

351

nominal root: t-imï-fisu-gi! REF-face-red-ADV „the sunburned faces‟

11.2 Inflections on adverbs

- Most adverbs may not host the important nominal and verbal inflectional features, but because of their clausal functions, adverbial words are like nouns and verbs insofar as they may host clitics, including interclausal reference markers, and several taxis, affective, and epistemic clitics. Because of this feature adverbs are clearly able to function not only at the clausal level, but also to manifest scope at a clause chain level. - Adverbs have special discourse functions when serving as adjuncts to an entire proposition (when part of a full agentive NP) and fronted/foregrounded in the utterance. Kalapalo time adverbial words often introduce a new clause chain. The adverbial words lepene, „afterwards, later on‟, lepe, „next‟, and aifa, „ready. done‟, are important narrative segment markers and form a separate word class described in Chapter 12.

itsu-Gi-ŋa ete-lï-ko

popopopo,

stream-on-go away-PI-PL (sound of paddling a canoe),

ta-kei-lï,

ta-kei-lï.

moving.around. the. bend, moving.around. the. bend

„As they went on paddling on the creek, they moved around the

bend, moved around the bend,

ifa-ki-tsetse-ku=dye-fa,

untsi.....

far-ADV-slightly-INT=SN-PTP, young. male.relative

when only a short distance farther along, that very person, “Hey,

Kid...”‟.

- Unlike nouns, with one sub-class exception (“likeness” words), adverbs cannot accept pronominal prefixes or possessive suffixes and are never inflected for aspect or irrealis status. Unlike verbs and nouns, no adverbs host plural suffixes. Only object-backgrounding (de-transitive) verb adverbializations may host person prefixes, as in the following example, wherein the de-transitive verb itso, „marry‟, has been nominalized, transitivized, then adverbialized:
. u-itso-ɳo-mb≈isi 1-marry-N-Vt-ADV ‘my marrying’

352

11.3 Adverbial derivations

Adverbs are often derived from nouns and verbs. De-nominal adverbial clauses may host the relative clause modifier suffix –tsï and „switch-function‟ primary topical participant suffix – fa (Van Valin, Jr. and La Polla 1997:287); described at length in Chapter 14.3). Some adverbs are inflected with the “facsimile” suffix –me (described in Chapter 5.3.11) . Adverbs may also be de-adverbialized and derived as nouns and verbs. The following example shows an adverb that has been verbalized, then de-verbalized as an imperfective nominalization, which serves as the head of a copular verb:

mbi:,

(sound of things thrown about),

t-apa-ga-lї=mbe-tїfїgї

a-tani

REF-thrown.about-CAUS- PI=SS-IMP EQS-CI

„Mbi: (having been thrown away) they were

scattered about.‟

To illustrate these syntactic features, I show the various uses of a very common Kalapalo adverb, ekugu, whose meanings include „fully‟, „completely‟, „perfectly‟, and „exemplary‟. At first sight this appears to be a nominal derivation from the root –ku „intensive, excessive‟, with what appears to be the possessive nominal suffix -gu. Example (a) shows this suffix -ku with the sense of „intensive‟ or „excessive‟ (INT) hosted by an interrogative (Q).
a. uwa eku-ki igia anïgï agu-ti-ta-tofo-i? Q intense-MIR like.this EQ-PERF thin-Vi-CI-USU-CL „What in the world made her become so thin like this?

However, ekugu does not function like a noun as it never heads a NP, nor occurs as host to case marking or any person possessor prefixes Also, like adverbs, ekugu only occurs juxtaposed to another member of a main word class: a verb (example b), a noun (examplesc, d, e, f ) or another adverb (g.ii).

b.

As an adjunct to a verb phrase, „made to feel shame‟. The

adverb follows the existential copular verb phrase, preceding the

ergative NP, which generally appears in final position in the

clause:

ifutisu-ki-tsa ≈kugu i-feke shame-cause-CI≈fully 3-ERG „(3p) had made (3p) feel thoroughly ashamed.‟

353

c. ekugu is the adjunct to a simple adnominal demonstrative NP:
anetu ekugu fegei. leader-fully ADEM „3p is fully („a real‟) leader.‟
d. ekugu as an adjunct to another simple NP, where it hosts the metonymic-taxis clitic:
mitote ekugu=lefa, aifa. before.dawn completely=MT, ready. „And just before dawn, they were ready.‟

e.

ekugu as an adjunct to another simple NP, where it hosts the

interclausal reference marker =mbedya (PXA).

adafa-foto-fïŋï

ekugu =mbedya.

dove-nest-resemble exemplary =PXA „It's just like a dove's nest (when it's made).‟

f.

semantic subclasses of adverbs („distance‟ and „manner‟). These

constructions may be used independently of any clausal feature

(particularly example ii):

g. i. ifaki ekugu far completely „really far‟

ii. iñalu ekugu negation completely „each and every one‟, „none left out (over)‟ (of a large number of items)

h. Appearing with the interclausal reference marker clitic mbe (SS):

kïtsï =mbe

ekugu ndisï

ki-lï

(expression of disgust) =SS fully 3:daughter utter-PI

„“That‟s really disgusting doing that,” her daughter said.‟

i.

Here ekugu hosts the interclausal reference marking clitic mbe

(SS), the adverbial phrase being an adjunct to the initial adverb

igi-tati „right inside there (i.e., watery environment)‟:

igi-tati

ekugu=mbe Ø-igifïkï-gï-na,

inside-ADV intensive=SS 3-center-POSS-ALL

„He had gone right inside its center (when he said that).‟

354
11.4. Underived adverbs
There is a small subclass of underived monomorphemic adverbs. These include locative indexicals, some manner (speed and time) adverbials, and negation adverbs. As for the other semantic categories often associated with adverbs, Kalapalo grammatical words referencing time, dimension or size, physical properties, age, color and pattern, quantity and order, and human propensities are in general nouns, often de-verbal nominalizations or re-nominalizations. However, it must be emphasized that virtually all these semantic subsets also include derived adverbials, both lexicalized derived morphemes and clear-cut derivational constructions from members of other word classes discussed. A list of underived adverbs follows:

11.4.1 Adverbs of manner

a. iñafe, ‘quickly‟ (urgency)

iñafe ata-i-fa

e-te-te

hurry EQ-SUB-PTP 2-go away-I

„Hurry up and leave‟

b. agetsïkï, „further‟, „more of same‟ (note, there is a numeral agetsi, „one‟)

c. ekugu, ‘completely‟, „fully‟, „perfectly‟ (as described above)

d. nzage,, „alone‟, „by one‟s self‟. This is a rare example of an adverb inflected with the person proclitic: uinzage, „by myself‟, einzage, „by yourself‟, inzage, „by 3p self‟ are attested.

e. iñalï, ‘negation‟

i.

iñalï owï-ko –feke e-ñaŋo-ko ufi-dyï at-ehe.

negation 2-father-PL-ERG 2-food-PL look.for-PI EQA-PER

„Your (pl) father hasn‟t ever looked for your food.‟

ii. iñalï inflected with facsimile copula –me, followed by deontic postposition, with the resultant sense of „nothing like that wanted‟:

iñalï-me-tsaŋe Ø-nïg≈i-feke, iñalï negation-FACS-DEO 3-PS≈3-ERG, negation „“I couldn‟t do anything like that,” 3p said, no.‟

f. afïtï.V+la, „no, not do X‟

The „denial‟ adverbial verb complement is a circumfix construction, very unusual and possibly unique in the language.

355

i.

afïtï ake-tsaŋe u-iño titï-pe-la=lefa

denial DS-DEO 1-husband name-SAL-NEG=MT

„No because I don‟t want to use that (particular) name of my

husband.‟

ii. Denial adverbial NP complement afïtï N-fïŋï, ‘no, not X‟:

afïtï itau-fïŋï denial-woman-unlike „No, not women.‟

g. (t)aifa, ‘finished/ready‟

This is an adverbial completive, “once and for all” . This adverbial has a sense of urgency.

i.

e-uŋï-t-aifa

2-sleep-Vi- ready.done

„You go to sleep once and for all‟

ii. ñ-o-ta-ni-mba-taifa: PB-return-Vi-CI-at.last „They returned to 3p once and for all‟

h. –fogu, „benefactive‟

igei- fogu fegei u-e-ga-tiga kum-iñaŋo-fogu IDEM- BEN ADEM 1-want-CI-HAB 1+2-food-BEN
„I haven‟t stopped craving this wonderful food of ours.‟

i.. tamitsi, „a long time‟

tseta itsa, tamitsi-mbedya Pañeta same.place EX-CL, a.long.time=SSCAT Pañeta „He, Pañeta, stayed there for a long time doing something else.‟

j. dyogu:, „thoughtlessly, uncaringly‟

a-fatuwї-wї-ko dyogu=mbebale wãke 2-nephew-father-PL thoughtless=SSCAT EM
„It turned out in the end this father of your nephews was thoughtlessly going to do that, I assure you.‟

k. telo, „another one‟ (of the same kind)

l. otohoɳo, „another (of a different kind)

m. atupohoɳo, „replacement‟ (as a leadership position) This references an old leadership ritual in which the new leader has a tonsure made.

356

i.

ai=lefa tupohoɳo

at-ani=lefa.

ready.done=MT replacement EQA-ANT=MT

tї-Gimiɳu-Gisi, kuguagi REF-pull.out.hair-ADV, vulture. „And so they were replacing him by pulling out his hair, the vulture.‟

n. sususu, „falling apart, decrepit‟

. u-iti-gї

sususu

1-hammock-POSS decrepit

„my decrepit hammock‟

o. tufugu, „all of them‟, no exception.

The position of the adverbial in this example is as a usual NP adjunct.

uwã-ko=tufugu=mbedya surround-PL=everyone=SSDE „All of them were competely surrounded.‟

In this example, tufugu occurs compounded with the interclausal reference marker =mbe. Further discussion of this compound occurs in Chapter 14: 14. 3.3.10.

kine ki-tsïgï uŋa-fi=mbetufugu flatbread make-IPE house-ADV=SSTOT „Flatbread had been made, that was done by all of the neighbors‟.

11.4.2 Adverbs referencing the movement of the sun

These adverbs refer to the movement of the sun, with arm gestures pointing to the sky showing the sun‟s trajectory. The motion of the sun is a copular verb predication, using the active equative copular verb in anticipation (inchoative) irrealis status.

a. inde Giti atani, „the sun was about to move over this way‟. Used in a narrative, the initial adverb, „here‟ may host the clause chaining metonymic taxis clitic, as in this example:

inde=lefa Giti ata-ni. lepene a-ti-su-fa

here=MT sun EQA-ANT. afterwards EQ-ADV-PEJ-PTP

isiŋi-ni s-ita,

isiŋi-ni tago e-ta.

behind-PL 3-come-CI, behind-PL otter come.to-CI.

„And the sun was about to be over this way when next, someone

was following behind them, the otters came, following behind

them.‟

357

b. kapoga Giti atani, „high noon‟, „sun about to fall‟ (?)

11.4.3 Basic color terms

There are four traditional basic Kalapalo color terms. These are found in adverbial form, as shown here, but are more often used in their nominalization forms with the –iñe „attributive‟ suffix; these noun forms appear in the third column.
At least one of these color terms appears to have a semantically permeable root. Talaki, „white‟ appears to be a t-√-ki adverb formed from the root for „pale‟, „ala-‟. The others do not appear to have roots that are any longer meaningful to contemporary speakers.

talaki fuseuki tukumilu tupisuGi

white black green/blue red

talaki iñe fuseukiñe tukumiluiñe tupisuGiiñe

In addition, Kalapalo people sometimes used the term kwadyapiɳo for yellow, with the root referencing a plant with a carrot-like root (kwadya) that could be used for dye of this color.

11.4.4 Other lexicalized adverbs

1. akїɳi, „many‟ 2. katote, „all, everyone‟ 3. amïnde, „alone‟, „empty‟

11.5 Adverbial suffixes

Most adverbial constructions occur with suffixes in grammatical wordfinal position There are a large number of these suffixes, some of which appear to have lost their meanings. However, many adverbials are derived from other adverbs, nouns, and verbs. The core of the derived adverb is a nouns phrase, verb phrase, or free pronoun plus a denominalizing, re-adverbializing, or de-verbalizing adverbializer. Negative adverbials are characterized by one of several circumfixed features, involving a prepositional adverb and a suffix that appears on the modified verb or noun. The following diagram is a schematic representation of the adverbial grammatical word construction.

existent, denial or negation morpheme

NP, free adverbializer pronoun, or suffix VP

Diagram 4. Order of constitutents in adverbialized words

358

11.5.1 The degree suffix –tsetse, ‘somewhat more‟
The degree suffix can appear with monomorphemic adverbial lexemes:
ifaki-tsetse te-lïfar-somewhat go.away-PI „She went on somewhat farther‟.

11.5.2 –la, „negative‟ in antonym constructions

This suffix may be a simple negation copula or used to create antonyms

kapehe, „tall katote, „alot‟

kapehe-la, „short‟ kotofo-la, „not alot‟

11.5.3. Attributive adverbial suffixes

There are a number of attributive adverbializer suffixes. These appear on roots that, in the main, no longer have independent meanings; most resultant constructions have become lexicalized. The suffixes include – ki, -mi, -pi, -ti, -fi, -tu, -tsi/tsu, -ku, -ɳu. The suffixes –mi, -pi, -ti, -fi, tsi/tsu, and -po appear to be non-productive. The adverbial suffixes –ki, kila, -ku, and -ɳu include sub-classes of derivational constructions. Many of these suffixes are also seen in the [t-√-ADV] construction. Table 36 lists these suffixes with their meanings. I use ADV as the gloss for all these with the exception of the intensive and diminuative suffixes.

11.5.3.1. Lexical –ki adverbials

359

There are both lexical –ki adverbs, most without semantically transparent roots, and other -ki adverbs that are clearly word-class changing derivations: de-verbalizations and de-nominalizations. The –ki morpheme is homophonous with the instrumental case morpheme and the negative mirative clitic. Here I list some lexical –ki adverbs:

a. tama-ki, „soften‟

igea=lefa a-ŋakafugu-a at-ïfïgï t-ama-ki like.this=MT 2-hair-U EQA-IMP REF- soft-ADV „Like your hair that is softened.‟

pokiti la like.that „We others go like that, frequently, easily, and without trouble, I assure you.‟

d. taloki, „useless‟. This adverb is often used by speakers as a marker of modesty, in effect expressing the imminent performance of an
amazing feat. The root talo cannot be used without the suffix.

11.5.3.2. Derived–ki adverbials

These adverbializations are derived from nouns and verbs. There are two subgroups: a) –ki, positive adverbializer used on both intransitive and transitive verbs; adverbialized nouns, and re-adverbialized adverbs; b) kila, negative adverbializer operating on nouns and demonstratives, as well as other adverbs.

1. positive –ki adverbializations of intransitive verbs:

a.

atsakuŋeki, „the manner of his running‟

b. utelïki, ‘the manner of my going‟

c.

b. uɳipi, „associated with‟

11.5.3.5 –ti adverbs A number of these adverbs may be verbalized, and then de-verbalized as adverbs with this suffix. Many reference manner, weather, and times of day. Note there is also the homophonous desiderative adverbial suffix – ti.

Other „manner‟ –ti adverbs:

keuti, „cold‟ taiti, „in a dangerous state‟ (referencing a woman who has to be careful not to have sexual relations when she shouldn‟t) egoti, „during the day‟, „daytime‟ iŋindati, ‘resembling‟ kuigandati, „in the manioc fields‟ The following two examples are of the t-√-ti construction: tïkoti, „angry‟ tilati, ‘briefly‟ The following –ti adverbial word is a t-√-ti construction from the root, fu, know: tufuti, „knowing‟ The following –ti adverbial word is a de-verbalization of a noun encorporated verb: ifaɳa-nda-ti, „whispering‟ (i.e., speaking into someone‟s ear) ear-CI-ADV

11.5.3.6 -fi adverbs This small set of adverbials reference attributive actions, and they are derived fromintransitive verbs.

364
ipufi, „covering‟ (this may also function as a nominal) ifisufi, „fruiting‟ talafi, „crouching down‟ tafefi, „floating‟

11.5.3.7 -tsu(ї) adverbs Like the –fi adverbs, the -tsu(ї) adverbs also reference
attributes;however, -tsu(ї) adverbs are derived from stative verbs.
1. itagitsu, „hungry‟. More usually this is seen as an intransitive verbalization, as itagi-tsu-nda, „she is hungry‟. 2. inapitsї, „lined up‟

11.5.3.8 - isi, -itsi adverbs Adverbs with these suffixes are stative or active transitive verb
de-verbalizations, mostly referencing the manner of experiencing by the O argument. These adverbs may host person prefixes, preserving the verbal O argument

a.

uum, tї-ki-tsї=maɳa t-iɳgu-G-isi.

EXP, RQ-NMIR-M=EM REF-see-PERM-ADV

„I can‟t believe this won‟t allow itself to be „seen‟ (i.e., figured

b. Other adverbs of this construction:

u-itso-ŋo-mb-isi, „the one who marries me‟ (my spouse) etinafikitsi, „capable of holding you‟ (as in wrestling) takwagï aŋunetigi, „performing long flute ceremony‟ et-etu-isi, „rubbing himself‟ tukugoisi, „rounded‟ tamisi, „wrapped up‟ tigiminugisi, „the one whose hair was plucked out‟; „the bald one‟ tugupotsi, „filled up‟ tidyuŋgi, „uncovered‟ tiposi uge, Yamurikumalu-feke, ‘I found myself being carried by Yamurikumalu‟

11.5.4 Adverbial spatial deictic constructions There is a large set of suffixes referencing location, place, and
direction. Distinctions referenced by adverbs formed from these suffixes are the following: beside a person;
a flat surface („in‟; „on‟,‟above‟), a container („in‟, „into‟), a watery environment („in‟, „into‟, „on the surface‟).

Most of these may be further nominalized with the suffix -ɳa (NLOC).

365

11.5.4.1 -kai, „on‟ or „beside‟

The –kai adverb means „on‟ or „beside‟ a person or human body part, or „on‟ an inanimate thing. Note the case suffix-kaiɳa,„destination‟ (DEST), discussed in 5.3.15.8.

e. Here, the morpheme appears to reference the extended argument „about‟ in a ditransitive speech act context; as I am not certain I have put a question mark in brackets at the end:

.

tu-iñaɳo-kai.

trumpet sponsor-ERG 3-speak-Vi-CI=MT REF-food-on (?)

„The trumpet sponsor spoke about his food.‟

11.5.4.2. –p(f)o „in relation to a flat surface‟ Adverbs with this locative suffix are often further inflected with the nominal locative -ɳa (NLOC). Some examples follow.

a.

ugupo, „on top of‟

ugupo-ɳa, „entity located on top of‟

366

tilopo, „nearby‟

tilopo-ɳa, „entity located

nearby‟

Aɳambїtї-tїpo, „near Aɳambїtї‟ otifo-ɳa, „located on the

grasslands‟

faɳguiɳa-tїpo,‟ near the river‟ faɳguiɳa-ge-po-ɳa, ‘all

alongside the river‟

fugombo, „the plaza‟

fugomboŋa, „in the central plaza‟

ŋikafo, „outside behind house‟ ikaŋaŋa, „fish lying‟ (on a grill)

akїfo:, „straightening‟ (as, a path) ŋatafoŋa, „beside them‟ (in an

open space)

isupoŋa, ‘underneath‟

b. –po „on‟ a rhetorical question, existential copular verb construction. In this case the notion of „on a flat surface‟ is a stretch of the imagination:

tї-tsi-po u-adyo Kanuakuma-me=nafa a-dyo-i RQ-EX-ADV 1-lover Kanuakuma-FACS=EM 2-lover-CL „Did I ever have a lover?‟ „Maybe a long time ago someone like Kanuakuma was your lover.‟‟

11.5.4.3 –pїga, „above a flat surface‟

ti-ɳi-mbe fugogo-pїga iɳi-pe-feke figei REF-see-SS plaza-above box-SAL-ERG ADEM imї-fidyo-nde-pїgї face-cover-Vt-PS „He saw him (floating) above the plaza his face covered with a box‟

11.5.4.4. –pa, „touching a flat surface‟

This is an unusual suffix with only a few examples from the data:

uña-pa, „on the floor of the house‟ aña-gï-pa,, „on your own path, trail‟

Note there is a possibly related „cyclical‟, or „turn taking‟ suffix, as in: ise-poŋo-pa: ‘partnering‟.

11.5.4.5.-kuati, ‘into a watery environment‟

As is typical of Amazonian languages, reference to a watery environment will take special adverbial suffixes in Kalapalo. ipa-kuati, ‘in the lake‟ tũwa-kuati, „in the water‟ afitagi-kua, „in the grasslands pond‟

11.5.4.6. –ka, in the direction of water

367
this is often heard during a very common greeting and response:
dyadya, una-ma te-ta? Oz (voc) Q-EM go-CI „Older sister, where are you going?‟
tuwa-ka water-direction „To the water.‟
11.5.4.7. -(g)ati, „into a container‟
efu-gati, „in the canoe‟ uŋ-ati „into the house‟, from uŋa, „house‟ ŋoŋg-ati, “into the (hole in the) ground” (i.e., a grave), from ŋoŋo, „ground‟
Each of the next two words includes the suffix –ka, „direction of the water‟. tuwaka-gati, „into the water‟ tuwaka-gati tseta iñïgï, „He appeared in the water.‟
11.5.4.8.- ta, „in a container‟ The examples show containers into which a person may fit.
efu-ta, „in the canoe‟ uɳa-ta, „in the house‟
11.5.4.9 (Gi)tati, „travelling on a surface by means of‟
This and the following morpheme (11.4.4.8) reference a manner of travelling: aña-Gitati, „by means of the path‟ faŋGuiŋa-Gitati, „by means of the river‟ Agifanugu-Gitati, „by means of the Agifanugu River‟
11.5.4.10 isatati, „travelling inside of a container‟
Taugi e-nïgï is-atati Taugi come.to-PS 3-inside „Taugi came towards (him) inside of it.‟

368
11.5.4.11. -tundati, „onto the surface of X leading to‟
This term seems to be used to reference the surface of a path on which people are travelling.
tuwa-tundati, „(path) leading to the water‟
11.5.4.12 –ofinati, „ underneath‟
This is used to describe something placed on a flat surface beneath another.
takiko≈finati tїilї i-feke, „He put both of them beneath her.‟
11.5.4.13 –nda, -ndo, „location‟
This adverb is used to describe the location of a crop or of prepared plants‟
kuiga-nda, „the place where manioc is found‟ (note final /i/ in kuigi, „manioc‟ becomes /a/ before the adverbial) ñe- ɳi-ko-ndo, ‘among their house posts‟ (that is, trees that had already been cut for use)
11.5.4.14. –fïtï, „gathered together‟
This adverb references a concentration or gathering of a natural species. It is often used to create settlement names, for example, Wagi-fïtï, ‘where the jatoba trees gather together‟, Tolo-fїtї, „where the Birds gather together‟. Other place names have nominal roots I was unable to identify, e.g. Fifi-fïtï, Aɳaga- fïtï,
11.5.5 The adverbial temporal deixis suffix -funda
There are very few adverbial temporal words. Most temporal words are nouns (see Chapter 5:Nouns). The only temporal deictic suffix attested in my data is –funda, „time of‟.
okoge-funda, „on the next day‟
11.6 The adverbial suffix -ku, „intensive‟
This adverbial suffix may inflect other word types, serving as an operator within an interclausal reference marker (a); an epistemic expletive (b); or another adverb (c).
The suffix –ku appears to be a compressed form of ekugu, „intensive‟. It appears in adverbial and interclausal reference marking as a kind of linking morpheme while preserving the sense of „intensive‟, „just‟.

369

Grammatical words other than monomorphemic nouns ending in -ku are not attested.

a. This example shows how -ku forms an integral part of the interclausal reference marker clitic mbe-ku=dya, (NOMR) „and for just that reason‟, referencing a logical association of the marked clause with a subsequent, new overlapping event.

teh

tupisu-i ekugu=mbekudya

(interjection, „nice‟) red-CL completely=NOMR

„It was lovely, really red all over, and for just that reason,

ule-fa i-gita-ke-ta-tiga. AFR-PTP 3-envy-Va-CI-HAB he whom I spoke of earlier was made to feel envious as usual.‟

b. The next example shows how ku may also following a question word in an interrogative construction. Here -ku links the question word u-ma with the evidential tifa suffix:

u-ma-i-ku-tifa e-futis-ofo iɳ-ati Q-EM-EP-INT-EV 2-shame-USIN lie.in.hammock-ADV

e-its-ue -ta i-feke. 2-EX-I -CI 3-ERG „Did I just hear him say, “Lie in the hammock with your motherin-law”?‟

c.

In this example –ku performs another „linking‟ function, between

the denial adverb and dya, the different nominal argument

switch-reference interclausal reference marker (DN):

afїtї-ku=dya

ake-tsa-ɳe kukuge-ko-la

denial-intensive=XA DEO-EX-I us-PL-NEG

„No, I don‟t want us to do that at all.‟

11.7 Adverbial Negation Negative moods marked in the verbal clause involve two different strategies. These include 1) use of the the adverbial negative (i)ñalï in adverbial first position and the class inclusion copula –i following an aspect/mood suffix; and 2) use of the adverbial circumfix afïtï+VP-la, as a denial of predication. As described in Chapter 7.5.7.6 the morpheme iñalï also functions as the malefactive derivational suffix on the verb stem.
11.7.1. Simple negation
This adverbial construction occurs with the class inclusion copula suffix functioning as an irrealis marker.

370

a.

iñalu u-te-lu-i

NEG 1-go.away-PI-Class.Incusion.Copula

„I won‟t go away.‟

b. ñalï wãke kaŋa eŋe-lu-i=wãke

negation EM fish eat-PI-CL=EM

si-tï-gï-pe,

3-head-POSS-SAL

afï-pe teŋe-lu-i

i-feke-ni.

guts-SAL eat.flesh-PI-CL 3-ERG-PL

„They were not the eaters of any fish heads, nor were

they eaters of any of the guts.‟

11.7.2. Denial of predication This construction uses the adverbial denial circumfix afït ï...la around the verb phrase.

a.

afïtï u-te-lu-la

denial 1-go.away-Vi-NEG

„No, I won‟t go away.‟

b. afïtï=aka kup-isua-gï

a-nïgï-la

denial=EM 1+2-brother-POSS EQS-PS-NEG

„We‟ve seen haven‟t we, that our brother is no longer alive.‟

11.8 The adverbialized root ag-

The „similarity‟ root morpheme ag- may at one time have had a copular function, but now it occurs only as a lexical adverb or as a derived nominalization. The evidence for this possible copular function is that the root always takes a pronominal prefix and also may take one of two possible nominalization suffixes.

a.

ag-age, „resemble‟: uagage, „like me‟, agage, „like you‟,

isagage, „like third person‟

b. ag-iɳo, „something resembling‟ (nominalized form)

Chapter 12 Small Word Classes
In this chapter, I examine the six small Kalapalo word classes. They are listed in approximate order of size: Ideophones, Expressives, Adjectives, Discourse particles, Deontics, and the single Coordinator. All are closed classes, and definable in a negative way by their very restricted ability to be inflected. Only ideophones may be subject to derivational processes.

12.1. Ideophones

This is the largest of the smaller classes of Kalapalo words discussed in this chapter. They probably number as many as 50 or even more. They may be combined and seem to have creative uses when a speaker wishes to reference the action or handling of a new or unfamiliar entity. However, this class should be considered closed as there appears to be only a limited number of morphemes attested.
Kalapalo ideophones do not share roots with words of other classes and are not inflected. They may be iconic, imitative sound images but also reference actions that don‟t have sounds in themselves. There are two possible types of reference. The first concerns actions in which body parts and inanimate objects are handled or act independently.

a. This example is imitative of a sound associated with an action.

lepene mbuk’

afterwards (sound of putting something down)

ege-na,

ege-na kïtsï tu-eki-ñe

otu.

PDEM-ALL, PDEM-ALL disgusting REF-smell-SN food

„Afterwards he gave something to this one, to that one, disgusting smelly

food.‟

b. This example shows two ideophones imitative of actions, neither of which has an associative sound:

iɳ-ati

tigi tigi tigi

eh eh eh

holding-ADV (shaking a small child in play) (heavy weight

being felt by the person holding the child)

„Holding him and shaking him playfully, she felt a great weight‟.

The second type of reference concerns animate entities. The ideophones imitate human calls or animal cries.

c. oi oi oi (A person crying).

d. pu:pu: (call of the great horned owl)

372

Members of this word class have important functions in narrative discourse. Ideophones may be used within clause chains so as to create complex clause constructions.

First, ideophonic clauses often initiate a clause chain.

e. tsuk’, itsake-t≈i-feke, tsuk’, tsuk’. tsuk’, cut.off-CI≈3-ERG, tsuk’, tsuk’ „tsuk’, she cut them off one by one.‟

f. kï kï kï

idyo-ka-ñe-nïgï

(sound of pulling on something) pull.up-Vt-MAL-PS

‘kï kï kï, what was pulled up.‟

Second, ideophones may create a link between an ideophonic cause and finite verb effect clauses.

g. lepene tate

tuk’ mboduk’ i-ñ-iɳ-atsi-lї

afterwards burity.shoot tuk’ mboduk’ 3-OB-inside-enter-PI

„Following that she fell on the burity shoot tuk’ mboduk’ and it

entered inside her.‟

Third, ideophones are often heard as recapitulation clauses, in which the ideophone references the sound of an entity involved in the action of a preceding verb, often with more information about that action than is actually contained in the verb.

g. tu-e-lï-ko=lefa

tïk tïk tïk,

mbisuk.

REF-shoot-PI-PL=MT (sound of arrows being shot), all gone.

„They were all shot at tïk tïk tïk, until there were none left.’

12.1.1. Ideophonic syllables
Kalapalo ideophones are words containing from one to four repeated syllables, and there is at least one extended syllable in which the vowel /u/ is lengthened and followed by /m/. Ideophones are often joined together to make more complex imaginative constructions. Kalapalo ideophones fall into several sub-types according to the syllabic structure. Many are 1-3 syllables that reference an abrupt or momentary action. Others are repeated syllables, in which the action referenced is repeated or continual. In this regard, Kalapalo ideophones may be distinguished aspectually and in some contexts are clearly adverbial in function.
When combined, ideophones of different sub-types can be said to iconically represent multiple actions that could elsewhere be referenced by a series of clauses. Because of these syntactic functions, ideophonic clauses should be considered to function as transitive or intransitive in that they reference the sounds of actions in which Subject, Agent, and Patient are involved. As in Lowland Quechua, so well described by Janis B. Nuckolls (1996, 2010), complex Kalapalo

373
ideophones readily substitute for or complement both transitive and intransitive clauses. Complex ideophones may link transitive and intransitive events. Finally, when a narrative is interrrupted, a listenerresponder often will use an ideophonic clause of this kind to prompt the narrator to continue. In the following examples, ideophones are given in boldface. The examples in this chapter are most likely a sample of the ideophones used by Kalapalo.
Before giving full discourse examples, I list examples of several attested ideophonic types based on syllabic structure. Forms listed for each type of syllabic structure are to be considered examples and not complete attestations of the frequent use of ideophones in Kalapalo discourse.

12.1.1.1. One or two syllables ending in checked consonant /k’/

Ideophones of this type reference abrupt action involving a body part or inanimate entity:

a.

tok’, „sound of man‟s arms beating on the water‟

b. mbok’, „sound of something falling‟

c.

tsuk’, „action of cutting or slicing something, tearing off a

fingernail‟

d. mbuk’/mbok’, „action of abruptly putting down something

heavy‟

e.

tauk’, heavy item penetrating into muck

f.

mboruk’, „something sharp entering a space‟

g. mbi:suk’, „items used up in some way‟. This ideophone may be

considered lexicalized, referencing „none left‟.

h. tik’, „entering a house‟ (the sound replicates what is heard when

a person‟s body brushes against the thatch of the doorway);

metaphorically, in narratives this ideophone references someone

arriving at a particular goal.

i.

kuduk’, „action of a stringer entering the mouth of a fish‟. In the

following example, the stringer is (magically) stringing up the

fish one by one. Note the verb is in punctual indicative

aspect/mood, as each event occurs instantly even though the

whole is aspectually continuous.

iño-ti-nde-li- ŋapa-fa i-feke kuduk’, string.up-Vt-PI=EM-PTP 3-ERG kuduk’, kuduk’, kuduk’, kuduk’, kuduk’, kuduk’ kuduk’ (sound of stringer catching many fish, one by one) „Probably it strung up (the fish) one by one kuduk’, kuduk’, kuduk’, kuduk’, kuduk’, kuduk’, kuduk’, kuduk’.

j.

sïk’ , „sound of pulling up grass‟

lepe tikű i-feke

sïk’ sïk’ sïk’, katote.

next pull.out-TH 3-ERG (sound of pulling up grass), all,

374

sïk’.

aifa

(sound of pulling up grass). ready.done

„Then he pulled them out sïk’sïk’ sïk’, all of them sïk’.

Finished.‟

12.1.1.2. One or two syllables ending in /m/
These ideophones reference the action of a body or entity falling softly onto the ground or into a watery environment.
a. tom, „action of diving or jumping into the water‟ b. mbom, „action of falling onto soft ground‟ c. u:bom, action of entity falling and then sinking into the mud. Here
the u: references extended action preceding the event marked by the second ideophone:

tue-lï i-feke itsi-lefa eke fuGi-mbe-ki ntsako, kill-PI 3-ERG die-MT snake arrow-SS-INST

u:

mbom.

(sound of shooting arrow), (sound of dead animal falling)

‘When he shot it with the snake‟s arrow ntsako, it died, uubom.’

ai=gehale si-nïgï asa-mukwe-tsu-fa mbom, ready=again come-PERF deer-EM-EV-PTP mbom, feu-mbe mbom, feu-mbe mbom akuGisa mbom. peccary-SS mbom, peccary-SS mbom, capivara mbom. ‘He got ready again, the poor little deer came they say mbom, same happened to a peccary mbom, the same happened to a peccary mbom, a capivara mbom.’ Aifa ready.done „that was all‟.

12.1.1.3 One syllable extended /u/

This ideophone is used to reference lengthened action.

a.

u:m, „extended flying action, voluntary or involuntary‟

lepene telu-lefa-ah-u:m,

afterwards go.away-PI-MT EXP-(extended flying action),

se-gati,

efu-Gati.

same place-ADV, canoe-ADV

„Afterwards it went awaaay, to that same place, to the canoe.‟

375

12.1.1.4. Reduplicated syllables Usually these ideophones consist of three or four reduplicated syllables. As the examples show, these ideophones generally reference extended motion. Speakers may use different sound images to reference different qualities of the same action (e.g., f and g). Where there are no spaces between syllables, the action represented is referenced as rapid. Where I have made spaces between syllables, it is because the speaker would use very slight pauses, references a slower type of action.

a.

tititi, „sound of bare feet on a cleared dirt path‟

b. tsatsatsa, „sound of feet walking through dried leaves in the

forested environment‟

c.

kukuku, „sound of something being chewed up‟

d. kulukulu, „sound of something being drunk‟

e.

behbehbeh, „sound of staggering‟

f.

puhpuhpuh, „sound of climbing up a tree‟

g. tsïgï tsïgï tsïgï, „another sound of climbing up a tree‟

h. tsik tsik, „sound of dragging one food behind while walking‟

i.

totototototototo, „sound of a snake moving‟

j.

čewčewčew, „sound of an animal eating with its mouth open‟

k. tïtïtïtï, „sound of a mollusc closing up its shell‟

l.

tututu, „sound of animal or person running‟

m. kï kï kï, „sound of something being pulled on‟

n. tsuk tsuk tsuk, „something being cut with a knife‟

n. tsitsitsi, „sound of a ticking watch‟

12.1.2 Referencing human calls or animal cries

Ideophones referencing human calls or animal cries (both are referred to as itsu), , are generally repeated several times to express the idea of continuous or repeated action.

a.

ka: (ka: ka:), „sound of calling‟ (e.g., a name or indicating the

death of someone away from the settlement)

b.

kao kao kao, „greeting call to signal the arrival of a visitor to a

settlement‟

c.

tsiu tsiu tsiu, „sound of whistling‟ (to get someone‟s attention)

d. wa wa wa, „sound of crying‟

e.

oi oi oi, „another sound of crying‟ (humorous)

f.

togotogo, „sound of something hard (such as, a turtle shell)

being dragged along the ground‟

g. buhruhruh, „sound of an animal running‟

376

h. tsutsutsu, „sound of an animal burrowing in the ground‟

i.

tsatsatsa: „sound of feet moving through dry leaves on the floor

of the forest‟ (i.e., in the wilderness, not on a cleared path)

j.

ŋa ŋa, „cry of the macaw‟

k. hmhmhmhmhm, „cry of the jaguar‟

l.

õ ah õ, „cry of the blue heron‟

m. The following example shows how the ideophone referencing a bird call functions as a kind of pseudo-nominal. As such, it may take an adverbial adjunct relative clause marked with the modifier tsї. (same example as Chapter 5.5e)

õ-a-õ

ifa-ki-la=fale

i-fudya-tsї-fa.

(call of the blue heron) far-ADV-NEG=NO tree-among-M-PTP

„õ-a-õ, this time not far away, (from) among the trees.‟

12.1.3. Complex ideophonic constructions

Complex ideophonic constructions are similar to complex clause constructions insofar as they reference multiple events that are phasally connected to each other. See also examples in Chapter 13.

a.

This example references a person suddenly jumping up (shu:),

running abruptly away (mbukah), and being grabbed hold of by

another (buh):

shu:mbukah! buh!

b. An example of three ideophones occurring as a clause, linking the initial „be‟ verb clause and final intransitive clause, marking with the taxis suffix –lefa (MT) as the end of this clause chain :

lepe te-ti-ñombi-gï-ki i

tsa-iŋa

next remove-REF-nail-POSS-INST EX-LOC

tsuk, toh, uubom,

(item thrown into air), (item slashes neck of victim), (victim

falling down),

Ø-apu-ŋu=lefa. 3-die-PI=MT „Next, her ripped-off claw tsuk, thrown at the one (seated) there, toh, and so she fell down and died.‟

c. An example of a repeated ideophone initiating a clause chain:

lepene tuk’, tuk’, tuk’

377

afterwards (sound of arms beating the water)

et-sumi-tsi-ŋu MV-beat.on-Vi-SN „Afterwards tuk’ tuk’ tuk’ (she heard the sound of) his beating on the water.‟

d. A repeated ideophone as a recapitulation clause:

lepe e-te-lu-lefa,

e-te-lu-lefa

next 3-go.away-PI-MT, 3-go.away-PI-MT

tititi.(sound of bare feet on a dirt path) „Next he went away, he walked away on the path.‟

e.

An extended action ideophone linking an explicitly described

action with another ideophonic construction. The notion of the

object falling „into a hole‟ is not referenced by the ideophone

directly, but was my Kalapalo assistant‟s explanation of what

happened:

u:m, ule-ke-tale

et-ïŋ-Gi-tsïgï

EXP, ATR-because.of-NT MV-pity-cause-VPE

t-iŋi-ti-feke

ah u:m, bïk!

REF-see-TH-ERG (sound of lengthened action) (sound of an

object landing on the ground)

„Well, because of all that this time he took pity on her and threw

it where she would see it, ahu:m, bïk! (Into a hole).‟

f.

tsoh,

(sound of ladle being dipped into liquid),

aliŋ-gu-ta i-feke efitsu-feke, Afanda fitsu-feke, ah Afanda fitsu.

stir-Vt-CR 3-ERG wife-ERG,Afanda wife-ERG, EM Afanda-

wife

„Dipping the ladle into the pot, she stirred it, his wife did,

Afanda‟s wife did that.‟

12.2. Expressives
The class of expressives is a very small adverbial-like word class with two sub-sets distinguished semantically and morphologically. The first subset is interjections. The eleven members of this set are all bisyllabic. They reference the speaker‟s affective reaction to an entity (human or non-human) that is either in the immediate presence of the speaker or that is being referenced by another speaker. These may host a nominal suffix. The following is an example in which the speaker is expressing disgust at a baby that has just relieved itself in the doorway.

378

kĩ.tsĩ-su disgusting-PEJ „Disgusting, as always.‟

The second subset consists of eight epistemic expressives, six of which are monosyllabic, and two of which are bisyllabic compounds. These are important elements in a speaker‟s stance positioning vis à vis the listener. A speaker‟s use of epistemic expressives involves an attempt to involve the listener in reacting to the speaker‟s opinion about something.

ah, ɳi-ke=apa ande ila-ña

its-apїgї its-a

EXP, see-I=CONF here.now distal.manner-ALL 3-footprint EX-

CL

„Surely, consider as I have their footprints here are (heading)

over that way.‟

Interjections on the other hand, have a more narrowly declarative function, asserting the speaker‟s reaction to something without specific regard for the listener‟s own opinion or reaction.
Together, these morphemes are adverbial in function, as they modify a NP or a member of the small class of adjectives. Interjections and epistemic expressives appear clause initially or clause finally in a few cases, typically have either very shortened or extended vowel endings, and. when initiating an utterance, are followed by a significant pause. They may be contrasted with the mono- or bisyllabic ideophones. One point of contrast is that the latter typically end with the checked consonant /k‟/ or with /m/. A second contrast is that (unlike ideophones) interjections and epistemic expressives reference arguments of verbs or modifying nouns. Both sub-sets of the expressive word class can be used to introduce further descriptive commentary.

12.2.1 Interjections
Eleven Kalapalo interjections are attested. These are summarized in the following table. All interjections are glossed „IJ‟.

12.2.2 Epistemic expressives

12.2.2.1. u:m, referencing imaginative thought
This expressive has unusual prosodic features, namely, an initial high tone followed by a descending tone. I have no examples in which u:m

382
appears by itself; it is always followed by a concrete reference to what the speaker is thinking about.
a The Trickster‟s ear-piercing companion, Kutsafugu, present in the Trickster‟s home, sees some fruit hanging up in the house and thinks it must be there for him to eat. He says to himself:
u:m, ege=mbe-ts-ŋa ñe-ku-tomi EXP, PDEM=SS-EX-I PB-eat.crunchy.food-PURP „If only this was done so it could be eaten.‟

b. In this example, there is included the epistemic clitic =laka, „correction in the mind of speaker’ (EM) The example is the same as Chapter 3: 3.3.1(d)

a. u:m aŋi=laka ukuge

ele, ukuge.

EXP result=EM human being PDEM, human being

‘I suppose that could have been human, a human being‟.

12.2.2.2. akah, ka:h, „frustrative’

This expressive may be used as a particle as well. It is often used in mourning, as in b), when a person returns home announcing the death or transformation of another person somewhere far from home, calling out to the rest of the group.

a. akah, u-gupu-ñe-nalï=lefa

ukw-an-їŋgo=lefa 1+2-EQSPOT;PL=MT „Why, why, no, we‟ll no longer be together.‟

12.2.2.3. koh, „don’t know’
Referencing the speaker‟s lack of knowledge, this morpheme may occur as an epistemic clitic or particle (and is listed as such in Chapter 3, Table 11), but can be used as an expressive, standing alone as a response to a

383
question. It is often followed by a clarification of why the speaker says she „doesn‟t know‟. These utterances may include EM‟s, but are more usually followed by a lexeme that elaborates the fact of this lack of knowledge (e.g., „who knows why X...‟, „no one knows who X‟).
Here, the speaker has been asked to identify something that‟s been found on a sandbank:
koh, kuge ite=ŋapa-fa=le=gei EX, human feces=EM-PTP-UT=IDEM „I don't know, but it seems to be human shit to me‟.

12.2.2.4. ah, assertive This expressive indexes strong conviction, and when used before a first person construction, the speaker‟s own memory. This expressive is followed by a full description of what the speaker is asserting. The example is a line that begins a first-hand narrative about a mishap.

a. ah, u-te-lu segei tafiŋa-i, tafiŋa-i, EXP, 2-go-PI ADEM alligator-CL, alligator-CL „Let me tell you, I went around like you as an alligator, as an alligator.‟

There are numerous examples in which ah introduces an utterance in which epistemic clitics (EM) appear. Examples of ah with some of these morphemes taken from Chapter 3 follow. b. A grandfather sees his two grandsons for the first time. This example
is interesting for its miraspective tone. (Same example as Chapter 3.3.2.15b):

ah ande-ŋu=tiki

u-fi-dyau a-nïgï

EX here/now-DIM EM 1-g.child-PL EQS-PS

„These little ones here can‟t be my grandchildren!‟

c. The speaker uses maki with the assertive expressive ah, „surely‟. A person who thought the river was somewhere else sees it and realizes his mistake (Same example as Chapter 3.3.2.16a).

ah, ande= maki fanguiŋa-lefa, Ø-nïg=i-feke EX here/now= EM river-MT say to-PERF=1-ERG „"Surely, that river‟s here after all", he said.‟

d. c. A woman tells her brothers her abductor was not one of their kind (same example as Chapter 3.3.2.17c).

ah, ukuge-fїŋї=makina wãke igei wãke, EX, 1-person-unlike =EM EM IDEM EM,

u-iki-dyu-lefa u-feke tsa=l=feke, i-ño-pe-feke. 1-abduct-PI-MT 1-ERG tell-UT=ERG, 3-husband-SAL-ERG

384
‟Believe me, the one who abducted me before wasn‟t a person like us‟, she kept telling them about her husband‟.
e. From a leader‟s ceremonial talk (Same example as Chapter 3.3.2.20c).
ah fitse-ke=mukwe=lefa timbe-ga≈ke EXP quickly-ADV= EM=MT arrive-Ci≈COM
ei-ŋoku 2-messenger(s) „surely, I hope they arrived quickly, your messengers‟

All these are strong assertive forms, either in the context of a negative response to another‟s assertion or corrections in the mind of the speaker. The seemingly anomalous use of ah with the contra-spective mukwe can be understood with regard to the fact that the speaker is asserting a strong wish through a series of semantically inverted metaphors (speaking pejoratively about a highly desired matter, for example), as are characteristic of the affinal civility register.

12.2.2.5. ma, uncertainty This expressive is typically found with questions. In the following example, a rhetorical (yes/no) question is used by the speaker, who is criticizing her daughter‟s husband for having taken a younger sister of his wife out of her puberty seclusion basket, suspended from the roof of their house.

ma, tï-tomi n=igey e-fisï-feke e-ikene EXP, RQ-PURP OP=IDEM 2-Ybro-ERG 2-yz i-tïtsine=tïfïgï 3-lower.down=IMP

tï-tomi, tï-tomi. RQ- PURP, RQ-PURP „Oh no! Why did your younger brother have to lower your younger sister down, why, why?‟

12.2.2.6. ekї, uncertainty regarding a name, „um‟

This expressive is used often to reference uncertainty when a speaker either does not know or has temporarily forgotten a name. In addition, when a name may not be used by the speaker because of avoidance constraints, ekї may be substituted, although metaphorical expressions are more commonly used, especially by older speakers.

EXP Afanda, Afanda „The black skimmer was flying overhead, the black skimmer was doing that, um, Afanda, Afanda.‟

12.2.2.7. u:m ma, uncertainty of understanding something seen

This co-joined expressive pair involving the initial expressive and the „doubt‟ epistemic (EM) appears to reference uncertainty of understanding (while observing some surprising or unusual situation). This is usually a straightforward interjection, sometimes followed by the –ku („intensive‟) adverbial; here the construction hosts the „selfconfirmation‟ epistemic clitic tifa.

a.

u:m ma=ku=tifa

efisua-gї-ko iɳ-ati u-iñalї.

EXP EM=INT=-EM Obr-POSS-PL lie.down-in 1-

MAL

„I never remember it being right for me to lie down with your

older brother.‟ (or, „How can I ever lie down with your older

brother?‟)

b. In this example the speaker is not only uncertain about what she is seeing, she is expressing exasperation that the person seen is misbehaving:

u:m ma:!, ete-ke-fa, e-te-ke-fa

Ø- ta i-feke.

XP EM! go.away-I-PTP, 2-go.away-I-PTP 3-CI 3-ERG

„What‟s this??‟. „Go away, go away‟, she said to him.‟

12.2.2.8. ah u:m, „certainty of imaginative thought’

In contrast with u:m ma (12.22.7), this compound expressive references the speaker‟s certainty (ah) coming from introspective understanding(u:m).

a.

ah u:m, aɳi=ka:

tis-agage amago.

EXP EXP result=FRUST 1+3-alike these.people

„But I‟m thinking surely these people (will) turn out to be just

12. 3. Adjectives In Kalapalo, there is a small class of probably no more than 20 underived monomorphemic adjectives. These adjectives fall into the following sets of Dixon‟s (2004) adjectival categories: physical attributes, dimension, age/value, human propensity, similarity, position. In Kalapalo, morphemes with semantic reference to Dixon‟s other adjectival categories (number, color; taste/smell categories; birth order, time) are nouns or de-verbal nominalizations; a very few are adverbs or verbs.

386

12.3.1. Syntactic and grammatical features Underived adjectives are defined through their syntactic and grammatical properties, as well as their position in word order. With respect to their word order, adjectives can be preceded by adverbials, but otherwise precede the NP and free pronouns they complement.

Nominalized adjectives always follow the NP. (Adverbials, which always take first position in the clause, do not have these syntactic restrictions.)

Syntactically, adjectives occur as modifiers of nouns and take a limited number of inflections. Kalapalo adjectives may be suffixed with a nominalizing suffix, which is the only derivational feature they allow.

a. tsїɳgi-ñї atu bitter-SN bitter.piqui.fruit „The bitter one, atu.‟

They are able to host the class inclusion (-i) suffix, the salient (-pe) suffix and (like adverbs) the negative property (–la) suffix. The appearance of a class inclusion copula suffix on an adjective usually occurs when the adjectival morpheme is repeated immediately after the original modified head NP. When adjectives host the copula suffix, they may be understood as nominalized words.

b. atutu-i, „a good one‟

c. atutu-la, „bad‟

d. atutu-pe, „one of the good ones‟

Adjectives may also host some taxis morphemes, such as the persistive taxis clitic gele, „still‟ (PT). In this construction they behave as adverbs.

e. atutu=gele, „still good, useful‟

f. atutu=fale, „good this time‟

12.3.2. Adjectives of quality and physical features

Adjectives referencing quality or physical attributes may host –i, the class inclusion copula suffix, or the negative suffix –la, forming antonyms.

a.

atutu, „good, nice‟ (atutu-i, „a nice one‟)

b. akïŋi,‟ many‟ (akïŋi-la, „not many‟)

c.

katote, „all of them‟ (kato-fo-la, „not all of them‟)

d. kapehe, „tall‟ (kapehe-la, „not tall‟, „short‟)

387

e.

intsoño, „little‟

f.

tsekegï, „large‟. If glossed as: „3p-large.size-poss‟, this may be

a possessed nominal, (derived from a root -eke meaning „large

size‟, as in the nouns, itseke „powerful being‟ and itseketu „the

power of a powerful being‟)

g. alaŋo, „pale‟

h. telo, „different‟ (telo-i, „a different kind‟)

i.

otohoɳo, „another one‟ (of the same kind)

j.

ifutugu, „dirty‟ (also may be possessed nominal)

k. fekite, „comfortable feeling‟

aŋi fekite uege result attractive you „Are you in good shape?‟

l.

ego, „good behavior‟, „well-behaved‟:

ego fïgi, „good arrow‟; ego fitsu, ‘good wife‟

m. isususu, „decrepit‟

u-itige isususu, „my decrepit hammock‟

n. tsue, „very many‟

i-tsїgї=mbe tsue

ekugu

3-bone=SS very.many fully

„It was full of its bones.‟

12.3.3. Comparison of adjectival and nominal complements Kalapalo adjectives contrast with nominal complements insofar as they 1) never are suffixed with nominalizing suffixes and b) never are predicated by demonstratives. Most syntactically nominal predications (i.e., modifiers of nouns) are underived nouns or nominalized and adverbialized roots (especially with, ekugu, „fully‟) derived at the lexical level. These morphemes can be re-nominalized with such suffixes as,mbїɳї, „former‟, ‟, -kusїgї, „lesser‟, -ko, „plural‟. There are also antonyms of members of this group which are derived nominals usually formed from one or another kind of negative nominalizing suffix. They may be predicated by pronominal demonstratives (a).
a. atutu-i-la ele good-CL-NEG 3.distal.PDEM

388
„that was a good kind of thing‟.
b. eɳe-ta-ti-ñї-mbїɳї eat.flesh-CI-DES-AN-W „(person) never wanting to eat meat‟.
c. –ñu, -ne, „possessor of attribute‟ suffixes
fesiñu elei, „he was ugly‟ („an ugly person‟) te-kafu-ki-ñu, „a thin person‟ (“herself made to be thin person”) tufiliñe, „strong‟ („his own strength‟). fai-nde-ne egei, „he is an old person‟

12.4. Discourse particles
This small closed class includes several free-standing morphemes that do not form a phonological word with preceding units. Generally, these words have discourse functions. They are listed in Table 39 followed by examples, most of which are from the narrative texts in the appendices.

12.4.1. eh he, „agreement‟ This particle marks conversational agreement. The speaker is confirming acceptance of a proposition or proposal offered by the interlocutor. The following example is taken from the narrative „Tree Termites‟ Arrow‟, told by Kakaku at Aifa (Appendix D, line 12).

12.4.2. eh, „yes‟ This is used in response to a question by the interlocutor, often followed by a confirmation of the proposition in the question.

a.

The following is an example from a narrative. The listener

repeats the word ‘iño’, „husband‟ to which the story-teller

answers, eh, „yes‟, and continues with her narrative.

iño-nïgï=lefa, iño-i=lefa,

eh, iño-i.

3;husband-PS=MT, 3;husband-CL=MT, yes, 3;husband-CL

„And so he became her huband, he was a husband to her, yes, a

husband to her.‟

12.4.3. aluale, ‘instead‟

This word may be uttered without further comment, but it can be used clause initially within a larger discourse construction, or in one particular construction, within a kind of „curse‟ (see b).

a.

Here, aluale begins the utterance after the listeners are

addressed.

kїɳamukwe aluale ata-i-ti

children, instead EQA-EP-DES 2-nephew-PL arrow

fo-po-a-lї-pe aim-HYP-EP-CI-SAL „Children, instead perhaps your nephew‟s arrows might have been aimed.‟

b. In this example, aluale is placed by the speaker between two parts of a curse, lafa itsani, „may 3p remain as he/she is‟ (often used when the speaker has become completely frustrated with the bad behavior of the subject). While the components of that construction may be readily analyzed, it is regarded here as an idiom with special narrative discourse segment marking functions, as it often concludes an unsuccessful effort on the part of the speaker to change the subject‟s behavior.

390
la-fa aluale kup-fiñano i-tsa-ni. like.that-PTP instead 1+2-Obro EX-CI-ANT „Instead, may our older brother stay the way he is.‟

12.4.4. aifa, „finished‟ This lexeme may be used as a question word without further comment, „is it done/ready?‟. This word may be formed from the root, ai-, „ready, done‟ with the primary topical participant suffix –fa. The clause chaining function of this root may also explain how it can host clause connecting clitics, particularly =lefa and =mbe. aifa is very commonly used in narratives to signal the end of one topic and the beginning of another involving a sequence of actions. All examples have been taken from the narrative „Mїti‟ (Appendix C), told by the late Kalapalo leader Kambe. Line references for this text are given with the examples.

a.

Use of the root ai- with metonymic taxis connecting this chain

with a preceding sequence of events :

line 37. ai=lefa t-aGi-mbi-dya-ki-ku=mbe-fa, ready.done=MT REF-cover-Vt-CI-INST-intensive=SS-PTP, ipufi at-ani, bark EQA-ANT

fala aGi-mbi-dyo, fala.tree cover-Vt-CI, „She was ready to pull off the fala tree‟s bark wrapping when,...‟

b. Use of ai- with the „same event arguments‟ inter-clausal reference marker =mbe:

line 82. t-eñu-tsi-tsi=mbe,

tsiuk’,

REF-crawl.down-Vi-ADV=SS, (sound of cutting)

ai=mbe-fa

ready.done=SS-PTP

„As it was crawling down after that tsiuk, she was ready to do

that to it.‟

c. Use of aifa to indicate preceding events have been completed and the actor is ready for a new action:

line 78. aifa, mbisuk’, ready.done (ideophone, something ended),

ts-ïmbï-ki-lï=mba=hale. 3-finish-Vi-PI=DS=DT. „It was done, mbisuk, but this time it came out completely.‟

d. Use of aifa following the particle lepene, „afterwards‟, in another common discourse segment marking construction:

391

line 123. lepene aifa afterwards ready.done
„Finally it ended.‟

e. Use of aifa to remind the listener to pay attention to important events to come:

line 59. e-tsa-ke-fa, aifa. 2-listen-I-PTP, ready.done
„So listen to what happened in the end.‟

f.

The use of aifa at the end of a narrative:

line 138. aifa≈nïgï

ake-ts-igei.

ready.done≈EQS-PS DEO-EX-IDEM

„This is how I need to end it. ‟

12.4.5. lepene, „afterwards‟

This lexeme is an important segment marking particle where the new

sequence of events does not directly follow from the preceding ones.

This and lepe (12.4.6) appear to have a common root, which

is

probably the anaphoric topic referent demonstrative ule.

a. Here a new sequence of events unrelated to the preceding is described.

„Later on a person approached, someone alone, tititi walking

until he came beside it.‟

12.4.6. lepe, „next‟

Some, but not all, speakers pronounce this ulepe, suggesting it is a form of the anaphoric topic referent used clause initially to shift topics. However, lepe is always used in descriptions of sequences of events, as example (a) attests. Line numbers are from Appendix C, „The Tree Termites‟ Arrow‟, told by Kakaku at Aifa.

12.5. Deontics

Kalapalo deontics are inflected morphemes, expressing a person‟s authoritative need or decision to do something. Often the use of deontics is related to events that are required or obligatory from the perspective of the speaker or a third party referent. They do not always reference a positive or friendly perspective (see example (c)). These morphemes are also frequently used in polite registers when direct requests would be inappropriate.
The core of a Kalapalo deontic is the existential verb construction itsa-, „existing‟, followed either by an imperative suffix -ɳe. or an identificational demonstrative igei. (I use DEO to gloss each of these constructions as a whole). The specific types are predicated by inflectional prefixes ake- (S or A reference, SD) which occurs with both the imperative and their identificational type, or fe- (O reference, OD), which only occurs with the imperative form. Deontic prefixes are different from the person prefixes otherwise used to reference verbal arguments or nominal possessors, exhibiting a nominative-accusative contrast, but this never influences the main clause alignment. Furthermore, the prefixes may be omitted where there is a free personal pronoun (12.5.2g) or other lexical noun phrase (12.5.1f,g).

12.5.1 ake-tsaŋe, SD-DEO

This construction co-references the S or A predicate that follows the . It may follow local demonstratives (a), (b), or pronominal demonstratives (c). Also, it may be negated (d), (e).

a. ande ake-tsa-ŋe dyadya Ø-nïgï, dyadya here.now SD-DEO Obro(voc) 3-PS, Obro(voc)

tu-nїm-iɳo e-feke. REF-give-POT 2-ERG „I want you to give this one to your older brother, you‟ll plan to give it.‟

d. This example is a deontic negation of a copular predicate. The copular complement is marked by SD, while the copular subject is referenced by the lexical NP.
afїtї ake-tsaɳe ї-fїgi-pe a-nїgї denial SD-DEO 1-arrow-SAL EQS-PS „No, I don‟t have any more arrows.‟

394

e. This is another deontic negation of a copular predicate, shown in brackets.

„No longer must your older brother be our deceiver,

There are examples of the SD-DEO used with SD substituted for by a full NP.

f.

Here the DEO construction is headed not by SD but by a lexical

NP NP (in brackets) hosting the „repetition‟ taxis clitic =ge.

This NP is the S argument of the clause. The clausal construction

hosts the persistive taxis clitic (PT) =gele,

„still‟.

12.5.2 fe-tsaŋe, OD-DEO

„You must consider carefully how this works.‟

e. The following is an example of a quoted imperative clause that includes the OD-DEO construction (bracketed). As the quotation is marked by the identificational demonstrative egei in clause final position, the deontic postposition appears to reference the quotation as O.

[inde fe-tsaŋe ke-te-ŋa,] u-ki-ta-ti-taka

“‟You must stop going around here‟, I‟m sure I was saying that.”

f. This example shows the OD-DEO construction included in a marking clause hosting =mbe, the „same argument‟ interclausal reference ( SS). The subordinate construction referencing O and A is an „agentive‟ nominalization (shown in brackets).

aŋi=nika. eŋï=mbe-ti fe-tsaŋe [u-ine-ni], exist=EM. reason-SS-DES OD-DEO 1-poison-AN.

„“Is that so? Because if I wanted to eat it, it must poison me

g. Here the accusative prefix fe- (OD) is substituted for by the first person pronominal demonstrative uge-, „me‟), O of the head de-verbal agentive nominalization (in brackets):
uge-tsaɳe ku-pisu-feke [u-ifi-tsa-ni] me-DEO 1+2-YBro-ERG 1=touch-Vt-AN „ I must be the one your younger brother will touch (lit., be my toucher).‟ (i.e.,have sex with).

12.5.3 ake-ts≈igei, deontic demonstrative construction
The second type of deontic construction which only occurs with the SD prefix is of the form: [SD-DEO-IDEM]. This construction makes use of the identificational demonstrative igei. This more nominal form has the sense of „this is the decision‟.

396

a

In this conversational example, the personal authority of each

speaker is expressed through the deontic, but the event

descriptions in question are not positively required. On the

contrary, it is the authoritative certainty (particularly of the

second speaker) about an unfortunate event to occur that is being

referenced. (i) and (ii) refer to the first and second speakers

respectively.

12.5.4. Deontics in complex clause constructions The following example shows how two of these deontics may occur in a complex clause construction. The lexical complement „reason‟ clause (bracketed) is followed by the main „useless‟ clause. A son has asked his mother to come sit beside him for a serious talk:

[eŋu fe-tsaŋe] talo-ki

muk≈ake-tsaŋe awa-dyu

reason OD-DEO useless-ADV EM≈SD-DEO uncle-END

i-ndisï-na

u-te-fo-ta.

397
„The reason I want to do this is I‟ve decided I should go to Uncle's daughter, though it probably won't work out the way I would like.

12.6 Coordinator õ, „and‟ The coordinator õ, „and‟ is only used with proper nouns to form lists. The coordinator is immediately followed by the referent, after which there is a short pause (marked as „,‟ in the examples) before the next use of the coordinator. It should be noted that there are many other Kalapalo morphemes with coordinating functions, including the taxis clitics described in Chapter 3, the comitative –ake (when used to mark coordinated S), the concessive verbal suffix –ote, the „additive‟ adverb gehale („also‟), and the „summary‟ adverb ekugu, „fully‟. In this regard, Haspelmath‟s assertion (2007:7-8) that non-written languages lacked coordinators before being influenced by written languages, is not borne out by these data.
In the first example of the coordinator õ (a) the speaker knows all the names of the group of siblings. In the second example (b), he was uncertain of the name of the second person. Note that in both examples, the primary topical participant marker –fa is used to indicate that the head of the marked noun phrase is the same head of a following noun phrase. These are boldfaced in the examples.

c. In this example from narrative discourse, items that are named as a list are not immediately conjoined, but are separated by commentary. Nonetheless, the coordinator is used to create the list. The members of the list are sometimes separated by a long pause (marked by „.‟ in the examples).

Chapter 13 Complex Clause Constructions
In earlier chapters, I described relative clauses, and verbal intransitive, extended intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, valence-decreasing, and copular verb main clause types. These data attest types of verbal main clauses that are distinguished in terms of their particular alignment feature configurations. These alignments emerge from splitintransitivity, split-ergativity and valency-changing processes. In the chapter on verbs, I also described the thetic non-finite verb constructions. In the present chapter, I describe complex clause constructions involving combinations of these and other kinds of clauses, showing the different syntactic relations involved and the different means of linking clauses to each other grammatically.
To use the model proposed by Dixon and Aikenvald (2008), Kalapalo is a language with both „true‟ complement clauses (i.e., subordination) in which the complement is constructed as a nominal argument of the main verb, and „complementation strategies‟ involving other types of clause combining (Dixon 2006; Dixon 2010,Vol. II, Chapter 18). In this chapter, Kalapalo clause combining materials are organized into three sections according to the degree of grammatical integration of the clause combining constructions. These sections discuss: lexical complementations, verbal complementation strategies, , , and subordination. A fourth type of clause combining involves the use of „be‟verb auxiliaries, described in Chapter 8.6. While these combinatory „types‟ illustrate degrees of integration, actual utterance examples may include more than one typological feature (as illustrated in 13.1.3.d, 1.5.a, and 2.4.f.). Clause chaining structures involving coordination between such combinatory types and switch-reference are described at length in Chapter 14. generally there are very few types of complement clauses, or what Dixon calls „true‟ complement clauses. Using Cristofaro‟s terminology, “modals” are deontic or marked by epistemic clitics and particles, “phasals” are marked by taxis clitics, “manipulatives” such as requests and commands occur with special imperative morphemes or imperative strategies, desideratives appear with –ti, su („compulsive pejorative‟) or -iñalï (malefactive) suffixes on the VP; “propositional attitudes” are expressed by epistemic clitics and particles; and “perception” predicates use the existential root its-in copular constructions. While Kalapalo is a language with both „true‟ complement clauses (that is, the complement is constructed as a nominal argument) and „complementation strategies‟ (Dixon and Aikhenvald 2008), virtually all of Dixon‟s „secondary verb‟ sub-type functions are taken over by the sort of verbal and derivational morphology mentioned above: suffixes, clitics and particles) Only Dixon‟s „primary B‟ verbs (those that may take complements) exist, and there are other Kalapalo verbs taking „true‟ complements (especially the verbs of motion) that are not included in Dixon‟s main categories of these verbs.
Finally in 13.5, I discuss a number of clefted clause constructions involving multiple clauses.

400

13.1. Lexical complementation

Lexical complementation strategies in Kalapalo involve the use of special lexicalized constructions which reference the semantic complementation type. There is no grammatical integration of the lexeme and the main clause, or any marker of complementation on the main clause. Most of these lexical complements precede the main clause,they are then followed by a distinct pause; utterance complements may either precede or follow the clause (in which case the pause follows the main clause). Lexical complementation include utterance complements (marked by quotatives, themselves reduced constructions); and ‟reason‟, „consideration‟; „accomplishment‟, or „suppositional‟ morphemes. Although some of these complement morphemes (such as some quotatives and probably the accomplishment morpheme) have verbal or copular verbal roots, they are clearly diminished in structure and with the exception of the „consideration‟ morpheme (iɳge, „see‟ in imperative mood), should be treated as lexemes. In preposed complement lexemes, the common argument of the relative clause is not stated, only in the main clause. In terms of clausal word order as well as the presence of special lexemes, most lexical complementation is similar to the preposed interrogative constructions described in Chapter 10, the imperatives described in Chapter 11, and the epistemic expressives described in Chapter 12.

13.1.1 Utterance complementation

In Kalapalo, utterance complements are quotatives in the form of finite speech act verb constructions. In Kalapalo, there are almost no indirect speech acts such that utterances are usually direct reports. As shown in Chapter 7: 7.8.4-6, there are other speech act verbs that are descriptive, not quotatives. A Kalapalo quotative is a complement clause that is preceded by a brief pause marked here with the comma, but as in (b) may precede the complement if the speech act itself is being focalized. Quotatives, which generally follow the utterance, have only limited person prefixes and aspect inflection and no overt stem.

a. The quotative nïg=i-feke always references the speech of a third person, and often occurs in narrative discourse regarding ancient or historical events.

tafaku oto, una-ma te-ta,

Ø-nïg≈i-feke,

bow master where-EM go.away-CI, 3-PS=3-ERG

“Bow Master, where are you going?”, he said to him.

b. The quotative Ø-ta-i-feke references a continuative commentary and like (a) must also only occur with third person speech acts. In this example, the quotative occurs at the beginning of the utterance. For pragmatic reasons, the quotative is elaborated by clarification of who is being spoken to.

[Ø-ta-i-feke,] tu-fitsu-feke

401

3-CI 3-ERG, O-wife-ERG

„He told her, his wife‟

c.

The ambitransitive verb ki-, „utter‟ may be in first, second, or

third person construction. The following example shows the

verb in an intransitive non-quotative construction. Speaking

somewhat informally, the speaker introduces something

important he wants to ask of the listener with this construction,

and the listener responds with a simple acknowledgment, as

shown:

ukwi-ta. dual-utter-CI „We are speaking.‟

(response): eh. „yes‟

d

Here is a second person example as a quotative, with the verb

used in transitive construction:

uño

its-iŋa egei Afanda, e-ki-ta-ti=nafa

1-husband EX-SN IDEM Afanda, 2-utter-CI-DES=EM

u-feke. e-ki-ta. 1-ERG. 2-utter-CI “You do know who I am because when you chose to say, “This guy here Afanda could be my husband,”, you were saying that about me weren‟t you?”

e.

A third person intransitive quotative construction with ki-,

„utter‟, must involve explicit use of the NP that references the

speaker (same example 7.8.3.a).

e-fiñano-feke e-їi-lї-ki-tani,

efiñano-feke. Kwatїɳї

2-Obr-ERG 2-do-PI-CAUS-ANT, 2-Obr-ERG, Kwatїɳї

ki-lї

utter-PI

„”Your older brother always made that happen to you, your older

brother”, Kwatїɳї spoke.‟

There are some speech act verbs that is used indirectly; a rare example of the indirect use of ki-,‟utter‟ is given in (f).

f.

The following is an example in first person.

inde fe-tsaŋe ke-te-ŋa, u-ki-ta-ti-taka

ege

here OD-DEO NEG-go-NEG 1-utter-CI-DES-EM PDEM

“‟You must stop going around here‟, I‟m sure I was saying that.”

402

g. Here, the verb stem -akitsu-,‟speech‟ in third person construction is a ditransitive verb that references formal conversational discourse (same example 5.1.1.j. quotative. Note the final NP is inflected with the adverb –kai; this is an unusual example of an adjunct-like argument.
kagutu oto-feke s-aki-tsu-nda=lefa tu-iñaɳo-kai. trumpet sponsor-ERG 3-speak-Vi-CI=MT REF-food-about (?) „The trumpet sponsor spoke to him about his food.‟

13.1.2. eŋ(ï)u-, „reason‟ complementations

Included in this section are preposed constructions that begin with stems expressing „reason‟, „unknown reason‟, „without a reason‟, or „bad reason‟, all constructed with the root eŋ(ï)u-, „reason‟. Reason lexemes host a variety of suffixes and clitics, including -iñalї, the malefactive verb suffix (13.1.2.a); -ti, the desiderative suffix (13.1.2.b); interclausal reference markers (13.1.2.b); epistemic clitics (13.1.2.c, 13.1.2.e); -ɳo locative and -omi „purposive‟ suffixes (13.1.2.h and 13.1.2.i); and -tsї, the relative clause marker (13.1.2.j) , and These phenomena suggest the „reason‟ complement is possibly an archaic verb stem that is being adverbialized.

a.

In this complex example the complement eŋu- is preceded by the

named agent. This „reason‟ morpheme hosts the malefactive +

copula nominalization –iñalu-i, and is then followed by the finite

verb clause‟ he hallucinated it‟ (which is the “reason”), then a

subordinate clause describing what he dreamed (in brackets).

Tamakafi eŋï-iñalu-i

[apu-ŋu-Ø=aka=fofo] die-VI-RES=EM=IM „Because (you can tell, can‟t you?) Tamakafi‟s reason was that he was (dreaming) he was going to die very soon.‟

b. The following example is part of an extended clause chain. Here, eŋu- hosts the same argument (SS) shift reference clitic =mbe, which is followed by the desiderative suffix –ti.

aŋi=nika. eŋï=mbe-ti fe-tsaŋe u-ine-ni. exist=EM. reason-SS-DES OD-DEO 1-poison-AN.

These are complements preceded by (e)iŋge “consider, think” (this is the same verb for “see” in second person singular imperatives; the second person prefix e- is often omitted as shown in most of the examples). In this construction, the verb acts much like a demonstrative, though appearing clause initially. Often this clause is suffixed with the „shiftfunction‟ primary topical participant morpheme –fa, (PTP) (13.1.4.a; b;c) which integrates the complement and main clause arguments in a topical continuity relation (Van Valin Jr. and La Polla 1997: 287. While the main clause is always in imperative illocutionary force, the complement clause may occur in indicative or interrogatives, or a non-finite construction. In examples (13.1.4e) and (13.1.4f), the main verb and complement clause verbs are both in the imperative, but this does not represent grammatical coordination as would sometimes occur with subordinated „true‟ complement clauses.

13.2. Verbal complementation strategies
Verbal complementation strategies involve some grammatical integration between a main and a complement clause. The head of the complement clause is marked as such with one of several possible suffixes. These include contrastives with –ne/nu morphemes (CONT) on the main clause adverb, enabling purposives -(nd)omi (PURP), concessives with the -ote suffix (CONC), and desideratives –ti suffix (DES) on the complement clause verb.

13.2.1 Contrastive clauses
Kalapalo contrastives are constructed with the pair of –nu and –ne suffixes (CONT) on complement clauses. Where the utterance contrasts a predication with something previously uttered, only –ne is used as in (a) and (b).

408

a.

The regular contrastive only uses –ne. Here, it occurs on an

irregular construction, (i)ñafe (often the initial vowel is elided),

probably involving the allative iña:

ohsi ñafe-ne

ku-ñi-ga-ke.

HORT come.toward.CONT 1+2-see-Vi-I

„Come back over here in my direction so we can all see.‟

b. In this example, -ne appears on a NP hosting the shift reference morpheme mbe („same event‟):

ande=gele-ta uge. u-iña-ta w-ato egei here/now=PT-DIS me, 1-DAT-DIS 1-friend ADEM

Afasa=mbe-ne Afasa)=SS-CONT “But I‟m still here. It was Afasa who (came) for me as my friend.”

c.

As in this example, where –ne is used in the prior utterance, -nu

occurs on the immediately following utterance.

13.2.2 Enabling purposive complements

The Kalapalo enabling purposive occurs as an inflected asuffix -omi, or t(nd)omi when preceded by a vowel. With plural S actors, the plural suffix –ko or collective -goko precedes the purposive suffix. The purposive has the sense of facilitating or enabling something, as in „try‟, or „intend to do‟. These purposive clauses reference the intended effect of an action that might only be understood from the context and may not be made explicit. The enabling purposive suffix may appear on verbs, adverbs, initial anaphoric topic referents, demonstratives, and „reason‟ complements. If there is a subordinate clause, it will be marked with the suffix, this clauseeither preceding or following the main clause.
With enabling purposive constructions, the stem formation persists, as well as the A or S person prefix. Where the verb is transitive, any A is replaced by a demonstrative. The purposive morpheme may also appear directly on pronominal demonstratives that are repeated after the purposive de-verbal adverbial. Where the purposive constructed verb is ditransitive, the (human) R(ecipient) noun receives a dative/benefactive case suffix. Where an oblique argument is inanimate, it is marked with the instrumental case –ki. The first four examples show the purposive suffix on a single clause verb.

a.

This and the following example (13.2.2b) show the causative –ki

and enabling purposive –omi morphemes on the derived

transitive verb stem ki- “to utter”, inflected with punctual-

indicative aspect. However, this combined form more usually

appears directly after the stem, with no other inflection. The

problem with the first interpretation is that –ki is more likely the

ambitransitive radical that has been displaced outside of the

stem. The several possible reasons for this displacement are

first) –ki can function as a valence-increasing causative, which

makes the –(nd))omi reference a “reason”; second, )

reduplication needs to be avoided. For example the verb root in

(13.2.2f) is ki- and there is a Ø radical in the stem‟s intransitive

form. But there is an ambiguity, because (as in both examples

13.2.2a and 13.2.2.b) the –ki radical can easily combine with the

purposive marker.

This example shows the purposive morpheme on the intransitive

first position, I interpret the marked constituent as a derived VP.

e. This example is a clause chain with a clause hosting the enabling purposive suffix on the existential copular verb stem its- that concludes a discourse string. The bracketed adnominal demonstrative in line (ii) “this (inanimate)” refers to the previous instrumental oblique argument „with the bee‟s spell‟ that ends (i). In (ii), that NP now becomes A of the purposive clause.

Here is an example of the appearance of -omi in a “reason”

construction. The following shows the purposive morpheme on

the pre-verb eŋi-ko- “unknown reason”.

eŋi-ko-ndomi ekuw≈apa-ha Ø-e-lï i-feke. reason-EM-PURP fully≈CONF-PTP 3-angry-PI 3-ERG „Who knows what could have made her so angry with him.‟

j.

Here the narrator uses the purposive morpheme on the

demonstrative-like anaphoric focus referent ule (initially

described in Chapter Chapter 4: 4.6.2.2; Chapter 6: 6.4.3.2) as

well as on the final subordinate verb (bracketed). She uses the

initial adverbial clause to „summarize‟ the previous narrative

topic, which she makes explicit in the final, subordinate clause.

In the summary description of what the demonstrative

references, the subordinate clause is formed with a transitive

verb, -ifi- “touch someone (i.e., have sex with)” also marked

with the purposive. The arguments in the adverbial clause are

referenced by demonstratives, „that (AFR)‟ and „this‟, rather

than full nouns. A appears in ergative case in the subordinate

clause(bracketed).

m. The following construction is a polite imperative strategy in which the permissive is put on an intransitive verb. Although the speaker is asking his wife to tell her father to do some work, the „stronger‟ imperative mood inflection on the verb would not be appropriate in this affinal civility context. The intransitive verb root ika - “collect firewood” is intransitivized by the radical -ŋu , indicating a voluntary bodily action (Note this radical is homo-phonous with the adverbial diminuative suffix, as seen in example 1)
ukw-oto i-ka-ŋu-ndomi. dual-parent wood-collect-N-PURP „Let our parent collect firewood. ‟ .

13.2.3 Concessive complements

Concessive complement clauses use the –ote (CONC), „even though‟, „although‟ suffix on the complement verb stem. The concessive marks an event that might preclude the action of the main verb but does not. The CONC suffix may occur on either the main or subordinate clauses.

a.

Here the O argument of the subordinate clause (bracketed) is

marked with both – pe (SAL) and also the case argument –

ki.

b. In this example the concessive is suffixed to the anaphoric topic referent as part of a segment marking, topical shifting clausal

413

construction. The „new, overlapping‟ and „different event‟ taxis clitics contribute to this discursive shift. The main clause is a de-verbal nominalization. (The full chain appears in Chapter 14: 14.5.2.).

c. This example shows a clause chain in which the initial marking

clause with the de-verbal nominal i-nïgï, „what was brought‟ is

followed by a second coordinated clause with the argument

marked by a postposed ule AFR. This AFR hosts the

concessive suffix.

13.2. 4 Desiderative

The desiderative, with the sense of „want‟, „like‟, is constructed with the suffix –ti (DES) following transitive verb constructions that include an aspectual suffix on the verb stem and an explicit O argument NP. When the latter includes quoted speech, the suffix may appear on the quotative with the resultant sense of „liked (wanted) to say‟. The clause may be subordinate or main. The desiderative is a construction that marks an event as „wished for‟. Note there is a homophonous –ti suffix on the non-finite supine or purpose of motion construction (7.7.1).
In example (a), there is a difference between the de-verbalized stem fote-, „burn‟ and itote-„set fire to‟.

13. 3. Subordination
Subordination is the most grammatically integrated clause combining process, involving „true‟ complementation clauses. There are grammatical features that indicate the subordinate function of a clause and its arguments shared with the main clause. Types of Kalapalo subordination include: 1) de-verbal stative and active nominalization; 2) non-adverbial „goal‟ with marking on the subordinate verb and salient – pe suffix on the subordinate oblique argument NP; 3) the supine purpose of motion clause in which there is a switch reference from S of main clause to A of the subordinate clause; 4) perception complements; 5) motion complements; and 6) the anaphoric focus referent ule appearing clause finally to mark subordinate status of the clause and S→O shift reference. Relative clause constructions are another type of subordination, considered in Chapter 5.5.
Each type of subordination involves particular morphological devices for marking the arguments within the subordinate clauses. These include core arguments as well as dative/benefactive, instrumental, and oblique semantic case markers; and the anaphoric focus referent ule- on the subordinate clause. In addition, there are often specific verb phrase constructions in use which are associated with the clause chaining function. Subordinate clauses may precede or follow main clauses.
Noun phrase density in clauses is not very high (though nouns may modify nouns). With three arguments in one transitive clause, P is normally pronominally prefixed, A is marked with the ergative suffix; and the third argument marked by an oblique case. With regard to complex verbal clause relations, as many as two separate subordinate clauses may occur, either with a finite verb clause or when the main clause is a copular verb construction.
A ditransitive example is given in (a) from the affinal civility register with a goal subordinate clause (in brackets) and an enabling

416

purposive main clause (which has its own relative clause). Note the modifier –tsї (M) marking the relative clause (bracketed) that modifies the NP „younger brother‟.This is also the common argument shared by the enabling purposive main clause and the subordinate goal oriented clause. :

13.3. 1 Motion complements

There are several types of motion complements. The main clause is often an intransitive te- „go away‟ construction; this is the most important complement taking verb. Other motion verbs that often appear in motion subordination constructions are „come‟, „leave, „arrive‟, „search for‟. Motion complements appear in apposition with their subordinate clauses. They may occur preceding or following the subordinate clause. Motion complement verbs may be constructed with aspectual or irrealis suffixes (as in 13.4.1.1.a), or as goal-oriented clauses with dative/benefactive suffix (as in 13.4.1.2a, b).

13.3.1.1. ‘A goes away while B does Y’

In this type of motion complement construction, there is a copular clause followed by the complement, and the main „go away‟ clause has an adverbial adjunct, „into hammock‟. The two clauses share marking for aspect.

a.

ah u-agiŋo=mukwe at-ani ti-ŋa-ka-ta

EXP 1-similar=EM EQA-ANT REF-lie.down-Vi-CI

u-te-tani 1-go.away-CL-ANT “I‟m telling you, in vain will he be like me since when I go away he‟s lying in his hammock.‟‟

13.3.1.2 „go away to do X‟
This type of construction (bracketed) uses a subordinating „goal‟ clause with the -iña dative/benefactive case suffix or a root with the transitive –nde radical, marking a benefactive action. The latter are often followed by a Ø suffix on the verb phrase, usually a marker of resultative semantics.

417

In (a), the subordinate clause references an action that is the goal of the main clause verb „go back‟. Both clauses share the 2nd person S argument expicit as pronominal prefix on the main clause. The initial frustrative expressive is addressed to that person. In this type of construction, in contrast with purposives discussed in 13.2.2, which place emphasis on the intention of the actor, the emphasis is on the effect of the action referenced in the main verb. The „target‟ argument of the subordinate clause is marked with the suffix –pe.

a.

With ipuGi- „prune up‟ limbs of a tree, so as to make a space

for planting (same example 12. 2.1.11). Here the main clause

follows the preceding subordinate clause, describing an activity

the speaker wishes to emphasis as useless and recurrent.

“But you‟re the fool who always goes back and forth to clear

away the brush around one tree was what he said to him, they

say‟.

b. The following is a indicative example with the subordinate verb
iŋi-‘ see‟ following the main verb clause, both clauses sharing aspectual inflection and 3rd person argument:

Ø-ete-lï-ko

gehale Ø-iŋi-lï-ko-iña

gehale.

3-go.away-PI-PL again 3-see-PI-PL-DAT/BEN again

„So they went again to see them again‟.

c.

In this example the subordinate clause verb (bracketed) has been

nominalized with the locative nominalizer, „place where‟ suffix

(LOCN), thereby creating a shared first person S argument with

the main verb. Both arguments of the nominalized verb are

preserved in this nominative-accusative construction. This may

be considered a „double‟ subordination construction, as it is both

a „go away to do X‟ as well as a de-verbal nominalization to

create a subordinate clause.

d. In this example, part of a clause chain, the subordinate clause hosts the „same subject, same event‟ interclausal reference marker =mbedye (SSE) as a „reason‟ reference:

13.3.1.3 „x comes to do y‟

The intransitive verb e- (si-, third person S), „come‟ takes many subordinate complements. The following example shows the dative/benefactive suffix on the subordinate verb, fe-lu- „break‟ (punctual indicative aspect). In (13.4.1.3a.i.), the main verb,„come‟ (suppletive 3p form si- is used here) appears in an initial clause in this chain, and is separated from the goal-oriented marked subordinate clause by a brief comment (bracketed) about the Snake beings who lived in the settlement. Otherwise, (a.i)-(a.iv) constitute a simple clause chain. The „target‟ argument of the subordinate clause is marked with the SAL copula suffix –pe (see also example 13.4.1.3d for a similar type of argument marking).

13.3.1.4 Extended intransitive with goal-oriented subordinate clause

Extended intransitives occur with the goal subordinate clause, marked as such with the dative/benefactive suffix –iña. The target argument of the subordinate clause is marked with the salient suffix –pe. The construction is attested for the verbs „shoot‟ and set fire‟. Subordinate clauses in the following examples are bracketed.

13.3. 2 Non-finite supine (purpose of motion) subordinate clauses

I follow Northern Carib linguists (Meira 1999: 329, 569; Carlin 2004: 336) in using the term “supine” to refer to constructions, which in Kalapalo function to reference „purpose of motion‟. Supine constructions always appear in subordinate clause function. They are participle like, insofar as they only use either a lexical noun phrase tp reference O or a third person pronominal absolutive prefix. An example of the latter is seen in (13.4.2a). Supine constructions never use finite verbal aspect or irrealis status suffixes, these being replaced by one of two supine morphemes: -iGi or -mbi, glossed SUP. Supine verbs occur with both main verb and de-verbal nominalization clauses. The main clause verbs are typically intransitive voluntary verbs of motion, such as e-, „come to‟, te-‘go away‟, ifa- ‘take away‟, and t-„find, get‟ (also ɳi, „see, watch‟). There is one example showing the supine as subordinate to an extended intransitive main clause with the „goal‟ (dative/benefactive) construction, (13.4.2.d). De-verbal nominalizations with supine verb subordinate clauses are also intransitive active verb nominalizations; an example is shown in (13.4.2.c).
The supine construction has a switch-reference function. S of the main clause verb is A of the supine transitive clause (S→A). All supine constructions are in boldface in the examples.

a.

This example shows a speaker‟s use of the supine „purpose of

motion‟ subordinate clause with the verb ife-, „clear tract of

land‟. In this case the subordinate verb only occurs with a 3rd

person pronominal prefix O argument. The supine clause in this

example precedes the main verb.

okogetsi i-fe-tiGi

u-te-lu-iŋo.

tomorrow 3-clear.land-SUP 1-go.away-POT

‟Tomorrow I‟m going away to clear a space.‟

b

Here the transitive supine clause precedes the intransitive main

verb. It appears O is highlighted by being foregrounded in the

construction. A in the supine clause is equivalent to S in the

main clause.

421

anetu

otu ifa-tiGi

u-ẽ-ta

leader‟s food tell.about-SUP 1-come.to-CI

“I am coming to tell about the leader‟s food‟.

c. Here the supine construction of the transitive verb ( bracketed) functions as subordinate to the nominalized intransitive motion verb. In the example, the supine clause fgollows the main clause. This construction creates an S argument from the original verb, with the sense of „the come-er‟. S in the first clause becomes A in the supine, where O is present as the NP, „long flute‟:

aŋi-me

si-tïfïgï

takwagï [aŋu-ne-tiGi]

result-FACS 3;come-IMP long.flute play-Vt-SUP

„Something to do with his being a visitor (lit., „the come-er‟) for

flute playing.‟

d. In this construction there is an extended intransitive main clause (using the DAT/BEN case suffix) and a supine subordinate clause (bracketed). Again S→A, marked by the following supine construction.

ande-lefa

Pañeta i-ŋi-lu-iña

[i-fa-tiGi]

here.now-MT (name) 3-see-PI-DAT/BEN 3-take-SUP

„Now here Paneta watched for her for (a chance to) take her.‟

The supine, in referencing „purpose of a motion‟, contrasts with the –(nd)omi „purposive‟ („try, intend‟) construction and the –iña („goal‟) construction, both of which occur with active verbs. The differences may be subtle as shown by example (13.4.2.d) in which the main clause is a „goal‟ construction and the supine indicates the reason for accomplishing that goal. Nonetheless the purposive of motion has a switch-reference function that only occurs with the supine clause construction.

13.3.3 Perception complements

Perception complements refer to the effects on a person (such as fear, thirst) of an action.

a.

oĩ, ‘be thirsty‟. This example shows plural concordance in all de-

verbal nominals and the existential copular verb clause (in

brackets), except the adverbial construction.

oĩ-tso-go

ite-pïgï-ko

[oĩ:-pi i-tsa-ko]

thirst-EX-COLL go away-VPE-PL thirst-ADV 3-EX-PL

„They all were thirsty, they had gone away, thirstily‟.

422

b. ŋe-, ‘fear X‟. Here the preposed „denial‟ adverbial afïtï-fa is the initial element of a circumfux, which is the adjunct to the complex clause construction. The main clause precedes the subordinate clause with the verb ŋe-, „be.afraid‟. The negative suffix on the subordinate clause completes the „denial‟ circumfix construction. Both clauses share the 2nd person argument, which is A in the main transitive clause, S in the intransitive subordinate clause.

e-ŋe-lu-iŋo-la 2-be afraid-POT-NEG, „You will not make the tree fall on you so you frightened.‟

shouldn‟t be

13.3.4 Nominalization subordination strategy.

De-verbal nominalizations using aspectual inflections are means of creating subordinate clauses in which the result is a P reference to the original verb.

a. In this example, the „voluntary perfective end result‟ nominalization (VPE) creates P of the original verb atsa-te-,’give to’ :

ah, ku-ñi-ta-fofo kunitsu atsa-te-pïgï, EXP, 1>1+2-see-CI-IM 1+2-GM give.to-Vt-VPE „Surely we should go right away to see our grandmother‟s gift.‟ (lit., „what grandmother gave‟)

b. In the example, there are two nominalizations. The first is
imperfective on the verb ke-, „cut‟, the second is „voluntary perfective
end result‟ on the main verb apïŋï- „die‟ („be unconscious‟). The two clauses share the 3rd person O argument.

s-igï ≈ke≈tïfïgï

Ø-apï-ŋï-fïgï=lefa

3-head≈cut≈IMP 3-die-Vi-VPE=MT

„She was unconscious as her head was almost cut off‟

c.

In this example, a „passing state‟ (PS) aspectual nominalization

of the verb iŋi-„bring‟ and the following verb fule-, „roast‟,

creates the P argument of the main verb api-, „pull up‟.

aifa api-lï=lefa, iŋi-nïgï=lefa i -feke-ne uŋ-ati. finish pull.up-PI-MT, bring-PS-MT 3-ERG-PL house-LOC,

ana fule-nïgï. corn roast-PS „After they pulled it up and they brought it into the house, the corn was roasted. „

423

d. This is the same example used in Chapter 6: 6.4.3 to illlustrate the use of the adnominal demonstrative as a relative pronoun. Here, I use the construction as an example of a complex construction in which the relative clause is also a subordination feature. The distal adnominal demonstrative felei functions as a relative pronoun, and referencing the preceding head noun tufisua-gï , „their own older brother‟, as O of the „objectbackgrounding‟ verb construction that follows. While the first two verbs of the complex main clause construction (linked by the „simultaneous‟ taxis =fata (SIM)) are both inflected in punctual/indicative aspect/mood, the relative clause verb is in continuative/indicative inflection. Also, it is a de-verbal nominalization in consequential derivation.

[ñ-ige-ta-nïmi] [OB-bring.back-CI-CONS] „bringing back their older brother with the arrows sticking out of him.‟ (lit., „stick-out arrow their older brother whom they brought back‟)

13.3.5 Anaphoric focus referent ule subordinate clause marker

When in the clause final position, AFR marks a subordinate clause boundary and has a switch reference function as it also references the the main clause S argument as the O argument of the subordinate clause. This is clearly a different function of the anaphoric focus referent than what is seen in major segment marking clauses, where the morpheme appears utterance initially and has major focus shifting function. (See more discussion of this function in Chapter 14:1.2.3; 14.4) . In the present case, tWith the present function of ule, he subordinate clause may precede or follow the main clause. The subordinate verb is aspectually suffixed. With this usage, the Aanaphoric focus referent is normally followed by the relative clause modifier suffix -tï, allomorph of the modifier -tsї. Note this allomorph is homophonous with the evidential „traditional hearsay‟ suffix.
In 13.4.5a, the main clause is intransitive, the subordinate clause is transitive. S in the main clause has become O in the subordinate clause.

In (b), the subordinate clause precedes the main clause. The subordinate verb (hosting ule) is reduced, and the main verb has been nominalized.

c. Here, the initial main intransitive clause in (i) is nominalized with the class inclusion copula. In lines ii and iii, the first subordinate verb S becomes A. In iii, the subordinate verb marked with ule is object-backgrounding.

d. Here the clause chain involves a plural A→S argumentswitch. The initial argument is ergatively marked A, the plural suffix –ko appears on the temporal adverbial adjunct, and the final argument in the concluding clause is pronominal prefix marked S, with the plural suffix on the verb stem.

An example with the main intransitive existential „be‟verbThe

13.4 Discussion: ‘Purposive’ and ‘reason’ constructions
As I explain in this chapter, there are four kinds of semantically variant purposive constructions representing three degrees of grammatical integration of main and complement clauses: a) semantic reason or goaloriented purposive subordinate clause marked with the dative/benefactive case morpheme; b) enabling purposive complementation, with a suffix on the subordinate verb; b) negative purposive complementation (with a special enabling purposive nominalization on the verb) and d) purpose of motion subordination. These different kinds of purposives may be understood not only in terms of differences in their grammatical and semantic features, but also with regard to the lack in Kalapalo of any „future‟ morpheme of any kind other than such temporal nouns as „tomorrow‟, „day after‟ and „much later‟. Use of the active „be‟ verb in perfect aspect (atehe), hosting one of three possible interclausal reference markers (IRM), is another important way of referencing futurity (see Chapter 14.2.3). Examples in this chapter illustrate what is required when the time of an event being described is to take place in the future.
Similarly, there are two attested types of „reason‟ clauses. The first is included in the lexical clause combining section (13.1) and involves the use of one of several initial „reason‟ (eŋ(ï)u) morphemes in the matrix clause. A second „reason‟ morpheme, the interclausal reference marker =mbekudya (described in chapter 14.2.2.8) has clause coorination functin, appearing cliticized to a chained clause, marking

426
the clause as the „consequential‟ event that follows from the preceding (main) clause in the chain.

Chapter 14 Clause chaining and interclausal reference in Kalapalo narratives
Discourse segmentation is an important characteristic of Kalapalo narrative genres (akiña). Speakers use a variety of resources, including references to the experiencing of time, and introductory and concluding discourse words to mark major narrative segment boundaries involving the introduction of new characters and important shifts of time and place. The dialogical interaction between narrators and their etïitsofo, the ‗listener-responders‘ who receive a story is also an important source of segment marking, especially the narrator‘s use of pausing to accommodate questions and other responses of the etïitsofo (Basso 1985, 1986, 1987, 1995). The texts presented in the appendices and many examples in this grammar illustrate the formation of separate lines, structured as a result of this kind of interaction.
Examination of Kalapalo extended narrative discourse reveals a number of important linguistic phenomena that cannot be clearly understood from elicited speech or informal conversational data alone. These phenomena include both grammatical functions and special syntactic functions of features seen elsewhere in Kalapalo discourse. The emergent hierarchic structuring of Kalapalo narratives is dependent upon such phenomena, which together contribute to listeners‘ competent tracking of the story, as well as to the speaker‘s mental control or ordering of the logic of the complex character and event developments. Segmental boundary marking in Kalapalo narratives gives a listener numerous clues to the relation between the rhetorical structure of the story and how characters are developed by sequences of events. Described in this chapter are the complex chaining and coordination of clauses, in which occur topical continuities and discontinuities, clausal argument cross referencing, including switch-reference. In this chapter, I describe these special features of Kalapalo narrative discourse.
14.1. General overview
―Clause chaining‖ is a term used by linguists to describe various systems in which a series of verb clauses are connected, with morphological devices on a final clause signalling the end of the unit (Longacre 2007: 400). Clausal morphology references the syntactic and semantic links between clauses. Switch-reference features are often associated in this way with clause chaining, marking verbal arguments as same or different (Munro 1980; Haiman and Munro 1983; Jacobsen, Jr. 1983; Matthews 1997:55), and also referencing semantic continuities or discontinuities. Kalapalo is such a clause chaining language in which speakers‘ ability to create extended narratives is enabled by the well-developed clause-linking morphology, the ‗interclausal reference system‘, a term first used by Franklin (1983), then by Margarete Sparing-Chavez to describe the complex referencing system of the Panoan language Amahuaca (1977). Chains of clauses in Kalapalo result from speakers‘ use of several morphosyntactic features. The first is the ule or anaphoric focus referent clause (first described in chapter 13) that

428
has a prominent higher-level segment (A, B) boundary function in narrative discourse. The second and most distinctive to narrative discourse is the set of anaphoric and cataphoric (or to use Givon‘s (1983) term, ―anticipatory‖) clitics, called here the ‗interclausal reference markers‘, (glossed here, IRM, ‗). The third clause chaining feature is the set of the taxis clitics which refer to phasal relations between events (described in Chapter 3). A fourth feature of interclausal deixis is the –fa ‗primary topical participant‘ switch-function marker (Van Valin, Jr. and La Polla, p. 287), described in section 14.3. With the exception of –fa, these features, and especially interclausal reference markers, are rare at best in elicited sentences and much reduced– though not entirely absent—in conversational speech. At more encompassing or ―higher‖ levels of narrative segment organization these chaining features interact with discourse segment boundary markers to create the complex structures distinctive to this Kalapalo discourse genre.
Kalapalo clause chains are organized hierarchically, so that one can speak of ―major‖ clause chains encompassed by shorter chains, some of which are embedded in others (these are listed in Table 40 as levels C and ―embedded‖ levels D). It is therefore important to understand these data not only in terms of grammatical function, but also with regard to narrative segmenting processes. In this chapter, the material is organized as follows:
1. Narrative segmentation, 2. The preposed ule, ‗anaphorical focus referent‘ focus shifting
clauses, 3. Taxis marking of phasal relations between events and clause
chaining, 4. Interclausal reference marking and clause chaining. 5 –fa primary topical participant ‗shift function‘ marker.
14.1.1. Narrative segmentation and clausal coordination
Table 40 summarizes the hierarchically ordered structural segmentation levels and clause chains that emerge in extended narrative discourse. These levels are labeled A-D. Table 40 shows the reference coordinates that are involved at each level, that is, the discourse and grammatical elements that index margins between segments. Thus A is the most encompassing level and the longest chain, whereas D is the least encompassing and shortest. The first column lists the segments of varying size and also segments which consist in functionally varied embedded chains at the lowest hierarchic level (section D, subtypes 1-3). I prefer to use the term ―embedded‖ rather than ―minor‖ to describe these shorter chain structures because of the absence of strict temporal linearity; also, these clauses are not necessarily structurally simple. Most of my examples that follow in the analysis of interclausal reference marking will be drawn from this level of segmentation. The reader can refer to the last column of Table 40 for the line numbers of texts in Appendices C, D and E that serve as examples of these and higher-level chaining boundaries within extended narrative contexts.
Table 40 illustrates how different kinds of non-derived adverbials mark important segment boundaries, a phenomenon previously remarked on by Longacre for many other languages (1985. 280; see discussion in

429
Thompson, Longacre, Hwang 2007: 271ff). In particular, temporal adverbials, nouns, and verb clauses involving references to the experiencing of time by characters in narratives, are crucial to segmenting larger clause chains (Level C in Table 40). These have specific semantic content that helps listeners understand motivation and other affective matters. For example reference to ―sleeping‖ refers to a character‘s experiencing of a period of time somewhat equivalent to an American ―day‖, but for a Kalapalo listener ‗sleeping‘ also implies the experience of dreaming, which in turn motivates new personal goals, or reinforces or confirms those stated in previous segments. References to actions taking place early before dawn index new, human goal-oriented activities, while actions taking place at the end of the day, after the sun has set but while there is still some light, involve itseke, ‗powerful beings‘ and their hyperanimate activities. The movement of the sun is often used by speakers to create boundaries between subordinate clause chains. A more comprehensive description of these boundary markers is in Basso 1985. Finally, the preposed ule clause is another feature often functioning as an important segment boundary marker at Level C, marking major topical shifts, particularly where new actors are introduced. However, as elsewhere (Longacre 1985; 2007), Kalapalo clause chains are not necessarily found in strict linear sequence, but with internally differentiated (segmented and embedded) chains. Longacre also comments aptly, ―The surface structure of chaining is (not) marking sentence or paragraph but is really co-extensive with the entire body of the discourse.‖ (1985: 283). From the perspective of the clausechaining features described in this chapter, the most encompassing structure of all is the entire narrative discourse, itself a kind of elaborate chain sequence introduced and concluded with segment boundary markers of the highest level (Table 40, Level A). In fact, the entire body of the narrative discourse could be treated as a single run-on chain (a point made by Longacre 1985: 283).
There are four procedures for clause linking in Kalapalo, resulting in the clause chaining structures characteristic of this language. These procedures involve a) the use of ideophonic constructions linking transitive and intransitive actions; b) taxis clitics on the verb phrase, which (as described in Chapter 3) mark phasal relations between events in each clause chain; c) the ule-fronted ‗consequential‘ complement clauses marking narrative shifts in focus, and a new primary topical participant and d) interclausal reference markers with cross-clausal argument marking (including switch-reference) and clausal coordination functions in extended narrative discourse. In this introductory section, the first three (which have been described in earlier chapters) are reviewed, after which I turn to a more detailed discussion of the system of clause chaining and interclausal reference markers.

14.1.2. Ideophonic clauses

Ideophonic clauses are predicational, that is, pseudo-transitive, pseudointransitive, or pseudo-nominal constructions. These constructions represent actions as if they had adverbial adjuncts, and were marked with certain phasal taxis clitics (such as those representing ‗repetition‘, ‗continual action‘, ‗cause-effect‘, and ‗abrupt action‘). Their use in clausal coordination occurs when there are two or more such clauses embedded in a clause chain, linking the preceding and following clauses.
I begin with a few simple examples to illustrate how ideophonic clauses should be interpreted as predicational.

a. Pseudo-intransitive. In this example, the two ideophones reference 1) the sound of bare feet walking quickly and repeatedly on a path; and 2) the sound of a person‘s body brushing against a doorway. In the latter instance, this ideophone has become a kind of metaphor for any sort of arrival at a reference point which is that of another person.

[titititi]

[tiki:]

walking fast arrive at destination

‗He came quickly to where the other was‘.

b. Pseudo-transitive ideophonic construction. After closely watching me put on my glasses, a young woman said:
ngu:guk‘

432

‗You‘ve settled the glasses on your face and ears‘.

Her use of the ideophonic combination, used in a new way and perhaps even made up by the speaker, references the somewhat extended action of the glasses being placed on my face and then quickly settled on my nose and ears.

c. This example demonstrates the use of several ideophones within a complex clause construction involving adverbial complementation. Several ideophonically described intransitive actions are coordinated with a finite transitive clause. These include the intransitive diving into the water, then the intransitive actions of the people emerging at the surface, and arriving at their destination:

lepene afterwards

tuwa-kaga-ti

tom,

water-at-ADV(sound of diving) EM

ah tuwa water

apai-lï

i-feke-ni

spread.apart-PI 3-ERG-Pl

poh, tiki:. (sound of coming up to the surface, sound of arriving). ‗Then at the water‘s edge, tom, (they dove in) and really, they spread it apart poh, and tikii arrived at their own place.‘

d. Pseudo-transitive and adverbial. This example illustrates an ideophone that references an object being handled. The specific ideophonic construction is used to express the idea of the object being put down firmly, but not in an abrupt manner.

Lepe opi-dyu

i-feke,

Next turn.over-PI 3-ERG,

mboki. aifa (sound of gentle putting down of object). done.ready ‗Next she turned it over, boki. It was done.‘

e. This example is offered to illustrate a linking function common to ideophonic clauses (same example as Chapter 12, 12.1.3b). The example shows three ideophones occurring together as a clause, linking the initial ‗be‘ verb clause and final intransitive clause, marking with the taxis suffix –lefa (MT) as the end of this clause chain:

lepe te-ti-ñombi-gï-ki

i-tsa-iŋa

next remove-REF-nail-POSS-INST 3-EX-LOC

‗Then with her torn-off nail,

tsuk,

toh,

uubom,

(item thrown into air), (item slashes neck of victim), (victim

falling down),

433

tsuk,thrown toh, and she fell down,

Ø-apu-ŋu=lefa. 3-die-PI=MT and so she died.‘

f.

Another example of ideophonic clause linking function (same

example as Chapter 12, 12.1f.). Here there is a three syllable

ideophone:

lepene afterwards

tate

tuk’ mbo duk’

burity.shoot tuk’ mbo duk’

i-ñ-iɳ-atsi-lї 3-OB-inside-enter-PI ‗Following that she fell on the burity shoot tuk’ mbo duk’ and it entered inside her.‘

14.1.3. Focus shifting ule clauses at level C
Focus shifting ule (‗anaphoric focus referent‘, AFR) clauses, first described in Chapter 13, 13.4.5, are another typologically interesting phenomenon relevant to hierarchic narrative structure. These clauses maintain discourse cohesion at higher level segment boundaries. Such clauses, while not uncommon in informal speech, are best understood in extended narrative discourse where formal segment organization and complex argument structures occur due to the many shifts of topic and focus. In this context, we begin to see some of the elaborate functions of these clauses within Kalapalo clause-chaining processes. Before turning to the focus shifting function, I review the other two functions of this morpheme.

14.1.3.1 Demonstrative function

As described in Chapter 6, demonstratives, ule operates as an anaphoric

demonstrative. In (a) the sense of ule is ―that other person‖ (of a

previously mentioned group). In informal or didactic speech, as in (a), ule

clauses are relatively short NP constructions where ule is inflected with the

primary topical participant suffix –fa, which has a topic continuity function;

here the suffix links ule to the de-verbal nominalization that references the

agent of the action, ―he who grasps the net‖. The adjunct i-ugu-po, ‗log-

on.flat.surface‘ is a spatial adverb that modifies the preceding VP, itself

marked as such with the SS interclausal reference marker =mbe.

a. tuwa-mbe-fa ege-te=lefa i-ugu-po,

ule-fa

water-SS-PTP PDEM-at=MT log-on.top.of-ADV AFR-PTP

feñe i-fo-te-pïgï net 3-grasp-Vt-VPE ‗Down there in the water, on top of a log, that person held on to the net‘.

434

14.1.3.2 Subordinate clause marker

As described in Chapter 13.4.3, when postposed to a clause, ule marks the O argument in the subordinate clause as the same as S in the main clause. In the following example, the initial main clause is intransitive; the following subordinate clause is transitive. Ule appears to switch-reference S→O.

kuigiku etu-ki-lï Ø-li-tsa-ule-tï

i-feke-ne.

hot.soup finished-PI 3-drink-CI-AFR-EV 3-ERG-PL

‗When the hot soup was ready, it‘s said they all drank it.‘

The supine purpose of motion non-finite construction is another type of subordinate clause with a switch-reference function (S→A). In the following example, the supine clause (boldfaced) precedes the main clause. The A of the supine clause is the same as S of the main clause, marked with a first person absolutive pronominal prefix on the verb stem.

anetu

otu ifa-tiGi

u-ẽ-ta

leader‘s food tell.about-SUP 1-come.to-CI

‗I am coming to tell about the leader‘s food‘.

As the supine construction has been discussed in Chapter 13, 13.3.2, it will not be considered further here.

14.1.3.3 Focus shifting functions
The most prominent kind of ule clause, and the type most relevant here for understanding clause-chaining and narrative structure, appears at the beginning of a major Level C (Table 40) clause chain as a segment boundary and topic discontinuity marker, though not all Level C chains begin with ule clauses. In this clause type, the anaphoric topic referent demonstrative ule is followed by one or more of the following features: a copular verb, aspect inflection, case marker, taxis clitic; or interclausal reference marker (IRM). The result is an adverbial-like adjunct to the first main clause of the new C-level narrative segment, separating that segment from the one preceding it. This clause type is recurrent in narrative discourse and has simultaneous segment boundary marking and topic discontinity marking function of great interest. ule clauses of this type appear to be like the Guanano (Tucanoan) ―initial link slot‖, consisting of ―conjugations or certain types of dependent clauses which recapitulate and refer back to a previous sentence‖ (Longacre 2007: 413).
a. The following Kalapalo example concerning a man doing brideservice who is being rejected by his secluded betrothed, should show virtually all the basic features. (i) and (ii) in this example are the immediately preceding lines that end the prior segment; in this segment, a girl matures and is put into puberty seclusion. (Note

435

that (iii) is a rare example of a 10-syllable word, probably only occurring as an ule clause construction.) Also of note is that clause in (iii) is followed by the independent clause (iv) with a fully inflected transitive verb. This and the following (v) are clauses that introduce the new locational and event sequence topical shifts which come in the next segment: the husband to be, now that he‘s been firmly rejected by his young bride, decides he has to leave (as he says later, he‘s going to ―run away‖.)

Because the first clause after the Level C segment boundary is fronted line iii), there is something happening that is treated by the speaker as particularly important. This pragmatic foregrounding function is an example of how such ule clauses mark a shift from old syntactic arguments to a new argument in the new clause chain, with, irrealis potential, imperative, or hortative illocutionary force, and desiderative and concessive adverbial clauses often appearing in the quoted conversations embedded in these new chains. Although the new argument is not marked by an IRM, the ule clause has a disambiguating or clarifying function with regard to the relation between the old and new arguments. This accords with Givon‘s argument (1983: 57) that switch-reference can be understood as a syntactic device used to code a high degree of topic discontinuity, or a context of surprise. The process of foregrounding ule clauses at major clause chain boundaries thus suggests their important relationships to switch-reference function.

b.. The following example is taken from another story about a young man who has been rejected by his wife. In (i) in the initial clause ule is inflected with the modifer suffix -tse; which shows this is a relative non-verbal clause modifying the NP in (ii), in which the man‘s stretched bow is described. This ule clause is also inflected with the interrupted taxis (=ŋugi) (IT) qualifying the immediately preceding action as interrupted (IT). The second clause in (a) is a reference clause with taxis =lefa, marking sequential action. What follows in (iii-vi) is a kind of hallucinatory experience on the part of the person marked as A in the reference clause. A Fish Person suddenly speaks as if he were human; the quotative (iv) is a marking clause, coordinating the interlocutor as a speech partner with the man (SS) who withdrew his arrow in (i) (=mbedye) AND what is said in (iii), which is also marked with the taxis form =tale (DT), referencing a new and surprisingly different event, that will take place in (vi-vii):

vi. eh.he

Ø-nïgï=dye-tsï

agreement 3-PS=SE-M

‗(The man) agreed (when he said that).‘

Ule in line (i) is a referent across the segment boundary. The clause anaphorically marks the previous segment focal agent, a man who has gone fishing, and also complements the preceding adverbial (the bow being withdrawn). The previously focal agent is for the time being foregrounded by the new fronted ule copula clause, but the conditions under which agency occurs are quite different. Now, instead of a wife who doesn‘t like him, he‘s talking with a Fish Person who invites him to the world beyond the water.
To summarize, ule clauses, as described in (14.4.3) and (14.4.4), have several important functions: first, they are segment boundary markers; second, they mark a new focal agent; third, because of these first two functions, ule when coupled with certain taxis particles contributes to the formation of mirative semantics, new (if not always surprising information) follows from that clause chain. ule in line (i) complements the existential ‗be‘ verb which is inflected for ―interrupted event‖ (IT) taxis (=ŋuGi ), which qualifies the action in the dominant clause as interrupted. This is another feature of Kalapalo that cannot be understood without a close look at the extended narrative frameworks in which such clauses occur. Examining ule in more ―informal‖ situations, only the first two functions appear.
Thompson, Longacre and Hwang propose that ―lexical overlap is a fundamental device of intersentential cohesion‖ and that adverbial clauses functioning as conjunctions ―can often be shown to be a substitute for the use of such overlap‖ (2007: 299). They continue ―It can further be shown that in some languages conjunctions are essentially combinations of verbal and demonstrative elements that have developed from such an overlap‖ (p.299). The functioning and structuring of ule clauses is highly relevant to this argument in several ways. First, ule clauses certainly play a critical role in cohesion, first, at the major segment boundaries of narratives

(though also intersententially), but also when appearing clause finally to mark a subordinate clause (as described at length in 13.4.3). Second, such major boundary markers do seem to be formed from combinations of elements that pertain to verbal clause structure, especially taxis, illocutionary force, nominalization, interclausal reference marking, and the equative ‗be‘ verb in resultative aspect. Third, while there is lexical overlap in Kalapalo discourse, particularly at the margins of higher level narrative discourse segments where ule clauses most often appear, the authors‘ suggestion that such forms perform a similar function makes sense as an explanation of the pervasive appearance of this clause type in extended Kalapalo narratives.

b. Here, rather than a taxis clitic the active equative copular root in perfect construction (atehe) follows ule (same example 8.6.4.3e).One or more taxis clitics hosted by the morpheme indicate the nature of the connection between the two events described by the clauses.

14.1.4 Taxis marking and embedded clause chains, Level D
This section is concerned with short clause chains at the lowest or least encompassing level of discourse segmentation (Table 40, Level D); that is, where embedded chains occur. Example (a) demonstrates a speaker‘s use of taxis clitics to link clauses in a chain with only one finite verb, appearing at the end of the chain. (The cluster of ideophones in the second clause of (a) may be treated as a pseudo-transitive construction, as it references the sounds of objects being acted upon: arrow cane being cut down by the uncle.) While there is only one transitive verb, the action of the single actor in this chain is contrasted with that of others described earlier in the narrative by the taxis particles. This example shows how taxis clitics can cluster and supplement one another. The speaker is contrasting the slow work of the untrained uncle (an ―ordinary person‖ and the villain in the story) with the quick and efficient harvesting of arrow cane by warriors who need to be always ready to enter into battle with enemies. In (b) there are three different taxis clitics, the new, sequential event taxis (NO) form (=fale) being repeated three times. This form references the uncle‘s antithetical act of slowly (not quickly, as do his skillful relatives) cutting down the cane. In the second line, there is a compounded clitic; =gele marks the persistive action (PT) of the uncle cutting arrow cane, while =fale (referencing a different event/state overlapping the event described in a preceding clause; NO) prepares us for the new finite verb (the stative verb –

439

fu- ―know about‖) at the end of the chain: iñalï funïm≈i-feke, ―he didn‘t know about it‖. (The uncle as actor is ignorant of something contextually important). My use of the term ―compound‖ implies that the elements in question can function separately.

a. [i-dyo-gu-ko≈tsa=fale] 3-uncle-POSS-PL≈EX=NO

[tsiu tsiu bok, tsiuk.] (sounds of repeated cutting and throwing down of items) ‗But their uncle being different (cutting them down slowly),

d. This example shows the how a cause-effect relation is referenced by two clauses marked with the metonymic taxis clitic =lefa (MT) (same example Chapter 3.3.4.a).

‗No longer will your older brother want to lie to us, because he‘s

e. In this example, the metonymic taxis marker =lefa links an adverbial (negation) adjunct and the main clause that follows. There is also a ‗new, overlapping event‘ clitic (h)fale (NO). (same example Chapter 3.3.4.1d):

14.2 Medial-final and initial-consecutive structures
Longacre‘s (2007) description of clause chaining distinguishes between ―medial-final‖ and ―initial-consecutive‖ structures. Longacre‘s terms ―medial‖, ―final‖, ―initial‖ and ―consecutive‖ refer to the different types of verbs and their position in a chain. The question of which types are present in which place in a chain concerns the differences between verbs that are fully inflected, and others which are ―deficient‖ in some way. (This is Longacre‘s term; I prefer not to use it as Kalapalo non-finite verbal constructions arenot fully inflected in the same way as finite verbs, but have their own special inflections). Longacre (1985) describes the presence of different kinds of verbs (or clauses), with a dominant finite verb clause appearing as the reference point for all others in the chain (hence the term ‗reference clause‘, also called the ‗controlling clause‘). In some languages these clauses appear before the ‗deficient‘ verbs (―initial-consecutive‖ structure), in others they follow the latter (―medial-final‖ structure). In In Kalapalo chains, both types of clause chains appear, and there are other types as well in which a marking clause bearing an interclausal reference marker marks features of both a preceding (‗event reference‘) and following (‗argument reference‘) clause. In such cases, marking clauses have a linking function. Considering the contrast between reference clauses and marking clauses, relative positions have to do with the marking function of the interclausal reference marker. Reference clauses (transitive or intransitive) may appear at the beginning or end of a chain, with the marking clause (which may or may not be also a fully finite clause) appearing chain medially, that is, between two finite clauses. The final clause in the chain may be the reference clause, but can also be an independent clause elaborating on the marked reference, often with a relative clause modifying construction
Regarding finite clauses, Longacre (1999:238) states ―A sentence ends typically in a dominating verb of fuller structure than any of the preceding verbs.‖ As I have described in earlier chapters, in Kalapalo, finite clauses may be either intransitive verbs with a NP lexeme or pronominal prefix that references S, or a middle voice construction, or transitive verb clauses which include (minimally) a lexical NP or pronominal prefix that references O on the verb, oblique argument lexemes + case marker, an aspect or irrealis status suffix on the verb stem (consisting of a root + radical), , and a postposed A NP that includes the

441

ergative suffix –feke (this is illustrated in 3c). This is illustrated by example.(a). Often, but not always, such clauses include a final metonymic taxis clitic, =lefa.
Example 14.1.2.2a, repeated below, illustrates the appearance of finite clauses at the end of chains, characteristic of what Longacre calls ―medial-final‖ clause-chaining. This example shows clauses linked by taxis clitics and an ideophonic clausal construction; there are no interclausal reference markers in the example.

a.

[i-dyo-gu-ko≈tsa=fale]

3-uncle-POSS-PL≈EX=NO

[tsiu tsiu bok, tsiuk.] (sounds of repeated cutting and throwing down of items) ‗But their uncle being different (cutting them down slowly),

b. [la≈tsa=fale

still ( working) differently (from the others) like that,

c.

[iñalï

Ø-fu-nïm≈i-feke]

negative 3-know.about-CONS≈3-ERG.

(since) he didn‘t know about it.‘

Another example of a ―medial-final structure‖ is seen in example

(b). This is a portion of didactic speech embedded in a long narrative, and

thus another example of a Level D chain (see Table 40). The speaker‘s

reference in (b) to the constant replacement of Christian leaders (such as

those who served at the local Brazilian administrative post) are, through

use of the new, overlapping event (NO) taxis clitic

=–fale (b.ii),

contrasted with the status of Kalapalo leaders, who are hereditary and

normally serve for much of their adult lives. In (b.iii) a final stative

intransitive clause (kagayfa anetu-gu eti-dyï=lefa: ‘the Christian leaders

resign‘) is marked with the metonymic =lefa clitic, which indicates the

chain boundary and serves as the reference point for the entire chain. In

this way the taxis clitic enables listeners to compose a coordinated whole of

sequenced events.

b. i. [iñalu=ma Kalapalo anetu-gu

iñalu. negative ‗I don‘t think a Kalapalo leader ever resigns, no.

442

iii. kagayfa anetu-gu

eti-dyï=lefa.

Christian leaders-POSS resign-PI=MT

But among the Christians, rarely by our own leaders, it‘s like this:

―Our leaders aren‘t working out‖, so the leaders of the Christians

resign.‘

Example (c) is an instance of an ―initial-consecutive‖ chain with several different arguments: in line (i), an initial main verb S, and a plural subordinate transitive subject (A) and O argument. The O argument was the S argument in the main verb clause. This is an example of how this switch from S→O is marked in the subordinate clause by the anaphoric topic referent ule (this type of subordinate clause is described in Chapter 13, 13.4.5). In line ii, there is a singular A and new O, a de-verbal nominalization (bracketed). The clause in line ii is also subordinate to the main clause in line i. As the O argument is shared by both these subordinate clauses, the subordination strategy in line ii is a de-verbal nominalization and the MT taxis clitic =lefa is hosted by the clausal A argument. This taxis clitic signals that the events are coordinate. But the chain has not ended. Line (ii) is the marking clause that links the preceding and following clauses by means of the interclausal reference marker mbedya (SSDE). This references ‗new successive event, same subject‘, marking a switch from what was done with the soup (it was drunk) to the second event (it became something the man has come to like). The soup, for which the proper name kuigiku is first used in line i) is also referenced in a de-verbal nominal construction in the final clause in line iii (bracketed). This derivational construction (bracketed) is the same kind of aspectual nominalization as in line ii, in which the speaker uses the active verb ‗end result of voluntary process‘ suffix –pïgï (VPE). The presence of this derivation in line iii is an interesting example of the use of the nominalized construction as a clause chain reference point.
The primary topical participant suffix -fa that follows SSDE in line ii references this second O as semantically the same as that in the final ‗argument‘ reference clause (line iii). The example is the same as in Chapter 7, 7.3.1.2e, where it is used to illustrate the ergative marker as a ‗causative‘ reference (as in lines ii and iii).

c. i. kuigiku etu-ki-lï hot.soup finished/ready-Vi-PI

Ø-li-tsa≈le-t≈i-feke-ne. 3- drink-CI≈AFR-DES≈3-ERG-PL ‗When the hot soup was ready, one by one they all sought to drink some.

ii. [i-fe-ki-pïgï=mbedya-fa i-feke=lefa.] 3-nice-like-VPE=SSDE-PTP 3-ERG=MT ‗And it was something that pleased him (when he drank it)‘.

liquid.food-ERG, Afanda liquid.food-ERG

‗(That same) liquid food of ours, that was what pleased him, the

liquid food, Afanda‘s liquid food‘.

(d) is another example illustrating how some chains end with a less than fully finite transitive clause, insofar as the A NP (A-ERG) does not appear (d. iv). This occurs because in narrative speech (in response to the listener-responder‘s own repetition of the finite verb clause), the speaker may repeat the preceding finite clause or as in 4d redescribe the preceding finite clause (d,iii), with a substitute, modifying O. This is a good example of the recursion that often occurs in clause-chaining; Longacre (1985; 2007) pointed out that strict linearity is not a property of that process. What is important for understanding Kalapalo clause chaining with this example, is that the metonymic taxis =lefa appears as expected in the final finite verb clause (in this clause, the A NP is fronted for topical emphasis; the normal word order is O-V with postposed A).

14.3. The interclausal reference marking complex
In this section I turn to the interclausal reference operators. The foundation of this system is a set of six clitics in three contrasting pairs (Set 1). These operators reference continuities or discontintuities of arguments and events. The first pair has A or S argument marking functions: same subject argument (=mbe, SS) or different subject argument (mba, DS). The second pair references event continuities (dye, SE) or discontinuities (dya, DE). The third pair are compounds of two of these otherwise independent morphemes, referencing same argument, prior event, (mbedye, SSE) or same argument, new, successive event (mbedya, SSDE). As I showed in example 14.2.c, these are clause linking operators coordinating preceding

444

and following clauses. These six features are summarized in Table 41 which includes a list of the host constituents of the marking clauses in my examples.

A second set (Set 2) of interclausal reference markers are compounded of the components from set 1 and morphemes which are otherwise independent. These compounds all begin with =mbe or =mba, which host one taxis clitic or an adverbial suffix; in some members of this set, =dye or =dya ends the construction. Set 2 forms have clause coordinating functions that are both syntactic and semantic. Syntactic functions that are referenced are arguments of the reference and marking clauses, continuities or discontinuities of transitivity, while the semantic references include prior or successive events, size, location, logical relations (such as cause-effect, reason, result, additive, cumulative, perpetuality, precision, totality), temporality, epistemic, mirative, and deontic continuity or discontintuity. Set 2 morphemes, probably not the complete set used by Kalapalo, but what I have found in a collection of 90 narratives recorded by ten speakers, is shown in Table 42. The table provides a summary orientation to the important clause coordinating features. Table 43 shows the semantic properties and temporal references of both Set 1 and Set 2.

14.3.1 Reference and marking clauses
Before looking more closely at this system of interclausal reference marking, I turn to a discussion of terminology. I use ―reference clause‖ to mean the clause that is explicitly referenced by an interclausal reference marker (IRM). While Kalapalo reference clauses are most usually finite

447
transitive or intransitive verb clauses, derived de-nominal verbalizations and thetic constructions also occur as reference clauses.
I use the term ―marking clause‖ for the clause that carries the IRM morpheme. Kalapalo marking clauses include almost any kind of syntactically dependent, complement clause, including non-finite subordinate clauses, intransitive or transitive clauses, quotative clauses, quotations, ideophonic clauses, object-backgrounding (decreased valence) clauses, and the segment marking initial anaphoric topic referent clause. The IRM may occur on nominal, adverbial adjuncts, and preposed hortative and lexical clausal complements de-verbal nominalizations, and nominalized clefted phrases derived from verbs. The latter also often carry their own ―event coordination‖ taxis clitic (usually =lefa, but also =fale). This suggests that, as with epistemic and affective clitics, Kalapalo IRMs have broad, even interclausal scope regardless of which constituent hosts them. Haiman and Munro (1983b) suggest that reference (or in their wording, ‗controlling‘) clauses typically end a chain, and also that marking clauses are located proximately to reference clauses. The Kalapalo data do not always conform to these generalities, as reference clauses may occur either prior to or following marking clauses according to the particular IRM used; as already shown, some IRM reference a preceding and following reference clause. There is also the possibility of clause skipping (Huang 2000:292) in which the reference and marking clauses are not directly adjacent to each other.
14.3.2 SET I interclausal reference markers
In this section I describe the six basic forms in Set 1, with examples of their use. The reader can refer to Tables 41 and 43 for summaries of the functions and translations of these markers.

14.3.2.1 (A) =mbe (SS) ―that same one‖ (same subject)

This is a basic form that links two clauses with the same subject arguments. If both marking and reference clauses are transitive, =mbe indicates their A arguments are the same; if both are intransitive, S is the same in each clause.

a.

The following is an example of an ―initial-consecutive

construction‖ involving use of =mbe. The entire chain is divided

into three sections (i-iii) to illustrate more clearly the reference and

marking clauses, and the consecutive position of the marking clause

in the chain. The initial clause in (i) is a thetic construction

describing the situation in which one group of enemies is about to

be ambushed by the other. There is an essive nominalized

adverbial adjunct to the thetic VP, which provides the controlling S

reference for SS in line ii. In (ii), SS appears on the marking

clause, referencing the same event and S as in the reference clause.

The marking clause is a medial clause in adverbial construction.

Without pause, this clause is immediately followed by the

independent clause (iii), in brackets, which includes an adverbial

448

adjunct marked with the anaphoric topic referent (ATR). The identificational demonstrative in (iii) references the group who are feared by those waiting in ambush.

i. [is-iɳi-ɳo-pe

t-ẽ-ti.]

3-follow-N-ESS REF-approach-TH.

is-iɳi-ɳo-pe

‗Those behind approached, those behind approached.‘

ii. t-atafi-ki=ale≈kugu=mbe REF-bow.drawn-ADV=UT≈fully=SS ‗doing that all the while with their bows drawn,‘

iii. tamitsi≈kugu

long.time≈fully unmoving-TR AFR=NO IDEM

te-ɳe-ni=fale. fear-VT-AN=NO ‗while frightened of them, for a long time the others had stood still.‘

b. In this example there is another ‗initial-consecutive‘ clause construction. In the marking clause (ii) the IRM is on the adverbial adjunct to the main clause. The marking clause links the preceding non-finite reference clause (the thetic form of the verb ifa-, ‗go outside‘) and the following finite marking clause (bracketed). The ideophone tiki in (i) represents the sound of someone brushing against the house thatch as he leaves his house. Just as he does this, the hero leaves his own house carrying a load of arrows. The the chain boundary clause marking lepe (‗next‘) in the (i) and the simultaneous event taxis (SIM) =fata on the final finite clause (ii) provide the temporal grounding for the whole.

i. epe tiki.

ifau ti-fa-ti.

ii. ai-kugu=mbe, [fugei ige-lï=fata i-feke.] finish-fully=SS, [arrow carry-PI=SIM 3-ERG] ‗Just has he1 finished doing that, he2 was bringing out his arrows.‘

c. Here the clause chaining also involves an initial-final construction. While there is no =lefa on the final clause, to mark the end of the chain, the Set 2 compound construction =mbele, marking ‗cumulative subjects‘ (CU) references the cumulative effect of a series of foods (see discussion of this morpheme under N, below). The links in this chain are marked by =mbe appearing several times in this clause chain. The same speaker references the several different aspects of the same general event (his living in a place

449

where he must eat strange food). The reference clause in (i) is an existential ‗be‘verb construction. In (ii), =mbe is hosted by a negative adverbial construction, adjunct to the VP; in (iii), the IRM is a set 2 construction =mbege, ‗even that‘, which follows the ergative NP in a fully transitive clause.

This form marks a switch from the marking clause event argument to a different argument function in the reference clause. The marking clause always precedes the reference clause.

a.

The new subject (‗our food) is marked with DS. There is a change

from the other kinds of food in the preceding lines to this different

subject. In this example, =mba is followed by the new overlapping

event taxis =hale (NO, ―while, as‖). The new event described in

(iii) is so worthy of notice, the speaking character (in the story)

marks it with this ―new event‖ taxis clitic twice in the marking

clauses in (i-ii) Again, the marking clauses precede the reference

clause, the last clause in (iii), which also represents a chain

boundary (not the presence of =lefa). Reference is to the reference

transitive verb clause (v): eating of the food by a woman who has

never seen it. It is interesting to see in this example that the

marking clauses (iii and iv) are P NP‘s within quoted speech, while

the reference clause is part of the narrator‘s description. (iii) and

(iv) together function as different subject for (v).

b. This medial-final example involves a di-transitive marking clause verb, ki-, ―utter, tell In (i), =mba , cliticized on the verb phrase, references the event and transitive subject (A) argument in the clause as different as the event in (iii). There is, additionally, another feature worth noticing in this example of =mba: there is an epistemic change between the marking and reference clauses. The first (i) is epistemically marked with the clitic =aka ―weak confirmation‖. The second, is epistemically marked with =taka as an even stronger ―suspicion‖ that the interlocutor does not share the information in question, information that has been spread by the discourteous speaker mentioned in (i) .

c. In this example, the speaker is talking about two men and their different settlements. The reference clause, which begins (i) is immediately followed by a relative clause, a class inclusion copula construction (bracketed). The use of =mba (DS) + new overlapping taxis =(f)hale (NO) in (ii) references the different place where the second man lives. The verb is not only

452

implied by the context but also in (i) by the morpheme –te, ―at‖ suffixed to the settlement name, and the proper or class inclusion copula suffix –i. The taxis clitic =fale is shared by the marking clause and the final independent clause (repeating information in (i)), functioning to crossreference the two different living sites.

14.3.2.3 (C) =dye (SE) ‗same event‘
=dye marks the predicates in the reference and marking clauses as being the same event. The marking clause precedes the reference clauses in both examples (a) and (b).
a. In (ii), the =dye ( SE) marking clause is in reversative mood (in brackets). This indicates that the immediately preceding finite clause in reversative mood (i) is the reference clause. Perhaps dye

453

is needed because in the final finite clause in (ii), there is a new A (ukw-oto-feke, ―our parent‖), but same P (ukw-ikene, ‗our younger
sister‘) as the argument of a de-verbal nominalization.

Atapa, ―Bee‖ is first introduced as S of the equative copular verb (i), and the speaker uses =dye in the relative clause that follows. The final independent clause (iii) references Bee‘s agentivity. The reference clause (in brackets, (i)) precedes the marking clause in (i).

14.3.2.4 (D) =dya (DE) ‗different successive event
=dya is used to reference a successive event that is different from the prior event of the reference clause. The marking clause precedes the reference clause when this IRM is used.
a. In this example, =dya on the marking clause in (ii) is hosted by the anaphoric demonstrative uɳele. Here =dya references the seduction by the man ‗who was going to be the older sister‘s husband.‘ He is different from Akiɳi who is named by the speaker‘s husband, in (ii). The speaker corrects him in (iii) where she calls Akiɳi ‗he, the one they were fed up with‘. The coarse language in my translation is in keeping with the use of the direct casual word for copulation used by the speaker.

Here is narrative example showing how the speaker uses =dya and =mbe keeping track of a participant in a story who is not one of the focal characters, whose naming is a brief diversion from the events of the narrative.

b. In this example, =dya references a new event (an arrival, line vi) from that of the ‗departure from the settlement‘ in (i). The subject is kuge, ‗a person‘. After describing the first event, the speaker reviews the main characters in the story, after which he returns to the events of story, and the arrival of the messenger.

14.3.2.5 (E) =mbedye (SSE) ―same prior event, same subject‖
With this compound form, the same predicate and argument in the marking clause is referenced as that appearing in the ‗event‘ reference clause and a following ‗argument‘ reference clause. In several examples the same argument is O, but in one example (d), the argument is an extended intransitive oblique configured adverbially. The ‗event‘ reference clause appears before the marking clause, while the ‗argument‘ clause follows immediately.
The following conversation example illustrates this use of SSE. Here in line (i), the reference clause predicate and argument is the phrase ‗worry about being killed by you‘. This is followed in line (ii) by the second speaker‘s denial of the predicate, through use of the contrastive ta=tiki construction (the epistemic clitic =tiki marks the speaker‘s denial of an alignment with the listener). Line (iii) is the marking clause, where the events are coordinated by the =lefa clitic. This clause is followed in line (iv) by the ‗argument‘ clause with same O (those who thought they were going to be killed) that provides further information about the speaker‘s reason for coming to the settlement, where he uses a ‗different taxis‘ clitic on the subordinate verb (bracketed). The use of mbedye in the chain also contributes to the epistemic shift that is being created by the speaker, which is from the initial speaker‘s suspicion about him to his strong denial of that predicate.

b. There are two operators in the following clause chain. =-mbedye in (ii) references the same event and same O of the (i) clause (the soup being sipped), which is also O in (iii). =mbe in the second reference clause (iii) again references the woman drinking what she thinks might be poisonous soup. Also of note are two important epistemic markers in (ii). The first is =maki, referencing the speaker‘s change from suspicious rejection of the soup to surprised agreement—the soup turns out to be good). The second, in line (iii) is =nika, referencing agreement. The speaker realizes she was wrong in (ii) (=maki) and expands that judgment as agreement with her interlocutor in (iii) (=nika). The same event is marked because there is a change of epistemic voice; the speaker changes her mind and agrees with her interlocutor after finding that the food she has tasted is safe (this is the ―result‖). In this example there is no final ‗argument‘ clause.

d. Here is an example of how the S and oblique arguments of reference and marking clause extended intransitives are referenced by the =mbedye operator.

The extended arguments in the example are adverbializations. The verb stem te-, ‗go away‘ is substituted for in line i by an ideophone, but appears explicitly in line (ii). In this example there is no particular marking of an epistemic shift but there is a sense of mirativity in the last line, unmarked perhaps because the events speak for themselves. The final ‗argument‘ clause follows immediately upon the marking clause.

14.3.2.6 (F) =mbedya (SSDE) ‗same subject, different successive event‘‗reason‘

461

This operator links two different clauses. The first is a reference clause involving the same subject as that described in the marking clause. The second, which follows the marking clause, is the clause referencing a new successive event. The discontinuity in the events, but continuity of the subject (a), thus occasions the use of =mbedya (‗same subject, different successive event‘). The reference and marking clauses are also linked by cause-effect relations and also a change in eventuality. All the examples in 14.3.2.6 (F) have the main participant surprised by an unexpected outcome, that is, a mirative response.
a. In this example, line (i) references the subject, a man who is remaining behind while his people are fleeing their settlement. The operator in line (ii) references the new event in (iii) the ‗remaining behind‘. These are the two reference clauses linked by line (ii), the marking clause.

In this example, the marking clause links (i), the clause referencing

an event that will be the same as referenced in the marking clause,

and also the subsequent clause (iii) where the O argument (a

deverbal nominalization) is different from that in the main clause of

(i). Both reference and marking clauses concern the same event,

but the named O in each are different; in the reference clause (iii)

there is ko-m-i-ñaɳo, ‗our liquid food‘, a name for hot manioc soup

(kwigiku) . In (ii), the pragmatics of the present example require

=mbedya since the new A in (ii) never was part of the plurality in

the first line.

Here is a clear example of what appears to be the same event

(blowing a spell), but as it is done on two different objects, a

woman‘s hands and then her processing mat, the speaker uses the

=mbedya operator to reference a new event (it is the spell that is the

same subject). There is a prior event reference clause preceding ,

and a discontinuous successive event reference clause following,

the marking clause.

This interesting example shows the use of =mbedya on the marking

clause which follows upon the immediately preceding reference

In this example the two reference clauses are intransitive, but there

is a change of subject argument in the first (line i) and second (line

ii) reference clauses. Also there is a change of location. The

mirative quality of the actor‘s experience is evidenced in (v) by a

very drawn out ―imaginative thought‖ epistemic expressive

This is a long chain with three changes in eventuality occasioned by

mirativity. Two shifts are marked by =mbedya (SSDE); the third in

(v) is marked by =mbegeledye (SSDURSE) with an unusual

interposed ‗persistant action‘ taxis marker =gele, (PT). This

apparently is linking the effect of the agent‘s actions (trying to

replace the basket lid) on the undergoer (the seduced girl). The

primary topical participant marker –fa is suffixed to the whole in

14.3.3 Compound forms (Set 2)
There are numerous compounded forms that speakers use as IRM. Most begin with the SS mbe; in my data only one begins with DS mba. Some (E and F) compound two of the Type I basic forms. Forms K and L compound two basic forms with the linking –ku- adverbial suffix ―'just, only‖. Forms I, J, N, and O are compound SS or DS forms with taxis markers; the forms of the mbembege- group seem to reference continuously repeated subjects. Forms N and O may perhaps be more properly called ―fused‖ forms, due to the language‘s vocalic fusion processes.
The compounds sometimes reference relations between three clauses (two reference, one marking), but more important, semantic properties that can be subsumed under Stirling‘s (1993) idea of ―continuity of eventuality‖ must be taken into account. These functions involve locational, temporal, and epistemic and deontic discontinuity, as well as event reference continuities or discontinuities that explain a Kalapalo speaker‘s use of Set 1 forms. Some of these compounds reference special logical cause-effect, result, and reason relationships among chained clauses, similar in function to conjunctions like English ―because‖ and ―if‖, and ‗so‘.
At this level of syllabic complication, it is possible to see a gradual transformation from clitic to lexeme. It is not a complete transformation; the switch-reference function is preserved where it is made present by the Set 1 operator used in the compound, but it is attenuated in the presence of a semantic property. It is not so unusual that a marking clause operator can have this property (see Huang 2000 for references; also discussion in Hopper and Traugott 2003 chapter 6, 7) but it is interesting that in Kalapalo, a language with few adjectives and many derivational processes, switchreference operators have this secondary adverbial-like function. This is helped by the ideophone words. As I noted earlier, in Amazonian languages, complex ideophones readily substitute for both transitive and intransitive clauses (see Nuckolls 1996). Kalapalo descriptive properties are most commonly found in noun phrases. But since many nominals are actually verbal derivations, could there be a connection between the adverbial-like tendencies of these compound IRMs?

14.3.3.1 (G) =mbege (SSR) ‗that again‘

466

The initial marking clause is subordinate, followed by the main

reference clause.

‗Hei did that again to look for her some more, hei went away

14.3.3.2 (H) =mbegedya (RDE) ‗ even though‘ ‗nevertheless‖

With this operator, a new event is distinguished from that of the preceding clause. Often =mbe is followed by the ―repeated taxis‖=ge as in 14.2.2.3 (I). Less commonly =mbe and =dya are linked with this same taxis marker.

a.

The following example shows both phenomena in (i and ii), as well

as an additional ―new overlapping event‖ (=hale) taxis (NO). As

elsewhere, the finite transitive reference clause suffixed with MT

=lefa appears in (iii) at the end of the chain.

14.3.3.3 ( I) =mbembege (PE) ‗and again and again as before‘-
This compounded form is a somewhat unusual example of Kalapalo reduplication. The same clause arguments are perpetually repeated, ‗over and over again‘. In (a) the children continue to cry over and over throughout

467

the events involving their mother, described in the chain. In (b), the woman is never able to finish clearing her field, as the manioc magically regrows each time she harvests it.

14.3.3.4 (J) =mbembegedya (PDE) ‗but even after doing all that‘

This compound is similar to (G) as the SS marker is repeated, and as in earlier examples, the repeated taxis marker -ge is infixed. Here, the =dya different event (DE) interclausal reference marker also appears. It may be that the reference clauses are now the entire prior and entire subsequent clause chains built into segments that form the story-line as a whole. The morpheme takes the postposition.
In (a), PDE follows the expressive interjection akah. The speaker is uncomfortable and expressing some frustration about her stiff legs, as well as the fact that the story she is telling us is very long, with many more interesting matters to come regarding a new focal character, the object of the main character‘s seduction, and finally new events involving the original focal character, the man‘s wife (hence the =dya)

‗I‘m exhausted from telling you about all this, (nevertheless even

14.3.3.5 (K) =mbekudye (INC) ‗without exception‘, ‗comprehensive‘

469

a.

In this example, the reference clause (iii) is marked with –mbe; the

ultimate reference of mbekudye in (iv) is an (intransitive) clause.

This is a good example of clause-skipping. Notice the marking

clause in (iv). The first three syllables constitute an ideophone

referring to the beautiful, clean appearance of the grass. This

ideophone is followed by -kugu, the intensive affix, and finally the

IRM =mbekudye. The whole is uttered in an elevated voice by the

narrator, Kudyu. He wants his listeners to know how excited and

happy people were to see thatching grass for the first time. As the

listeners have learned from the reference clause in (iii), ‗(what had

grown up) wasn‘t something prickly‘.

i. tu-ẽ-ndi. REF-approach-TH ‗Coming closer,

14.3.3.6 (L) .=mbegeledye (RSSE), ‗still as before‘
This form is constructed with the persistive taxis =gele (PT), ‗still‘. The marking clause references an event and argument that have been mentioned before in an immediately preceding clause. The following example (taken from 14.3.2.6f) shows this structure.
iv. afïtï ets-iŋi-i-ta=mbele, afïtï. denial MVsee-Vi-CI=CU denial ‗He couldn‘t. She could be seen still (after he did all that), he couldn‘t.‘

couldn‘t.‘

14.3.3.7 (M)=mbekudya (NOMR), ‗for just that reason‘, ‗that‘s why)‘

This frequently used form seems to connect the event in the (following) reference clause with the (prior) marking clause in a logical way; the marking clause is the ―reason‖ for the event in the reference clause.
This function occurs in example (a). The initial subject (a special house made by a powerful being mentioned in the preceding line, not included here) is marked in lines (i), (ii) and (iii) where =mbe appears. On the marking clause with the present operator (iv) =mbekudya references the logical connection between (i) and the immediately following reference clause (v) involving a successive event. Furthermore, the reference clause in (v) begins with an anaphoric focus marker ule referencing the original topic in (i), the house. Ule is suffixed with the primary topical participant – fa; this compound in (v) marks an important segment boundary where the focus will shift to Taugi, away from the house itself, the focus of the present clause chain.

b. Here as in (a) there are two reference clauses. In this example, the first clause in (i) describes people who are trying to eat the arm cut off from the body of a man they have just killed. In the marking clause in (ii) =mbekudya marks a switch to a new event in the

471

second reference clause (line iii), where they discard the bitter arm. Also, an epistemic and deontic change5 occurs from the reference clause (i) to the marking clause (ii); people found the arm was too bitter to eat even though they tried to do so. Line (iii) =mbele marks the cumulative effect on the undergoer (the dead man‘s arm); see further discussion of this operator in 14.3.3.8.

In this example, the marking clause (line iii) references an event

(trapping a victim in a net) that had been described at some

length in a previous narrative. The new subject in this story,

do that to him, too.

14.3.3.8 (N) =mbele (CU) , ‗cumulative effect‘, ‗in the end‘
This is an anaphoric operator marking the SS as does =mbe, but that operator is conjoined (and fused) to the continuative taxis/temporal

472

reference clitic. The event in the marking clause is directly tied to that in the reference clause as a cumulative consequence, an effect on the undergoer. It is not clear whether this is a true compound or not. While there are many examples of Set I forms followed by a taxis form, =mbele and =mbale (P) seem to have grammaticalized such a compound, as there is no clear boundary between either IRM and the taxis marker. They may be formed from Set I forms with a reduced taxis suffix; the most plausible candidate is =ale (uninterrupted event).
In (a), not only does =lefa in (v) mark the end of a clause chain, it also marks the final verb clause as a reference clause for the earlier marking clause in (i): igelu-mbel≈ifeke. Example (i) includes a transitive clause marked with =mbele, where prior event arguments continue. In the example, the first finite verb is at the beginning of the chain, and the last finite verb is at the end (v). (a) is also one of several examples of a Kalapalo marking clause exhibiting fully finite verb structure.

b. In the story from which this example is taken, a person uses an exceptionally long rope as a magical axe to cut down an enormous section of forest to make a manioc field. His wife is fearfully holding onto the other end of the rope, as he walks away to cut down the forest, while the trees fall down in front of her. There are two ideophonic pseudo-transitive clauses in this chain: (ii) and (iii), which begins with an interjection (this is a quoted clause, though

473

without a quotative). (iii) is the marking clause. The reference clause is the ideophonic clause in (ii).

In this example, there is a sequence of different actions leading to a

final, cumulative consequence. These are first, the man trying to

take something out of a net trap by using his hand, second, the trap

grabbing him, third, the trap dragging him inside itself, fourth, the

man being strung up in the air, inside the net trap. Most of the

actions of the trap are referenced by ideophonic constructions. In

line (iv), the appearance of =mbele references the cumulative effect

of the preceding actions. This is the taken by the net trap into which

the victim has been dragged and hung up. That he will be killed

later by the net‘s owner as been explained by the

This is an anticipatory or cataphoric S referent, with the same focus on consequential connection between prior and successive events, as with =mbele (CU).
In (a), the marking clause (i) is non-finite and contains an extended object dative/benefactive case marked noun phrase. There is no overt S. The referent in (ii) is the subject noun phrase. The latter is the verb nominalized with the transitive subject (A) nominalizer (AN) suffix –ni: uimbi-ni ‘he who stole me‘. Although the S argument in both the marking and reference noun phrases are the same, and the epistemic continuity is strongly marked on each clause constituent and noun phrase by repeated use of wãke (marking speaker‘s strong validation of past event descriptions), the fact that the outcome is unanticipated seems to require the =mbale rather than =mbele form.

In the following example (b) the woman and her abductor arrive at his settlement. She stops crying while something new is happening: her relatives are searching for her. In this example, =-mbale references both a shift from singular S to plural A and also an overlapping dislocated event. The same chain includes two proximate clauses with two different IRMs. First, this is because the first chain involves a sequence of events that need to be connected: the pair come out onto the abductor‘s territory, the woman arrives and then stops crying. Second, this sequence is contrasted in the initial clause, (iii) with the second, overlapping event; the relatives are looking for her. The finite final verb reference clause appears in (iv). The shifts in agency are: plural S (i) becomes singular S (iii), which then becomes a new plural A (iv).
This example also illustrates ―clause leaping‖, where the marking and reference clauses are not proximate but separated by another clause. In the second (marking) clause in (iii), reference is to the earlier clauses in the chain. The first marking clause in (iii) references the arguments in the final finite clause in (iv). Logically, there is no ambiguity as there are two different subjects; the first is S, the second A. But there is also a shift in location which may motivate use of the =mbale IRM as there is no ambiguity concerning agency in these chains. The new plural A in (iv) is focalized by being fronted in the clause before the verb. In this way, two separate short chains (i,ii; iii,iv) are linked to form a larger whole.

(c) is an interesting example showing the complementary and somewhat overlapping functions of the =lefa clitic and the IRM‘s. This time the speaker uses 3 IRMs in the same chain: =mbe, =mbale, and =mbehale. The =lefa taxis clitic serves to start a new segment, introducing the finite

476

verb event description in (i) and linking it to another event described in (iii) (initial clause). A is the same in both clauses. =lefa appears at the end of the chain (v), closing the chain. The finite transitive reference clause appears after the marking clause in (iv).
=mbehale in this clause also relates the previous descriptions of lots of huge manioc roots growing (more than could ever be used up), with the woman‘s (overlapping) ability to process them into huge amounts of starch, for which work she had made herself a special squeezing mat. Since there is no dislocation or logical discontinuity (indeed, this is a concessive construction), only =mbehale is needed, linking the first short chain (i-iii) to the second (iv-v), which ends with the finite transitive verb (suffixed with =–lefa). One must ask why =mbale appears in the second marking clause in (iii). It seems this IRM is needed because there is a shift in agency; it is not the woman and her skill that are enabling the production of large amounts of starch, it is the spell that has been put on her hands which works on the processing mat she is using.

14.3.3.11 (Q) -mbembale. (SSCAT) ‗so afterwards, elsewhere‘

With this compounded form, shorter chains are linked to form more complex chains. The same event becomes linked to a reference clause verb phrase hosting the =fale (NO) taxis (new and overlapping event) which is dislocated from the events in the marking clause. The marking clause S is equated with the same S of a previous reference clause but there is also anticipation of a new S who will appear in a new reference clause. In the new reference clause the overlapping event is also a logical consequence of the prior event described in the earlier reference clause. This is somewhat more complex than the kind of chain seen in (14.3.3.10c), where the same event appears in both reference and marking clauses. It is also different from simple overlapping events as in example (14.3.3.10b).
The situation in example (a) comes at the end of a Level C (major clause chain) segment and illustrates the texture of a complex chain in which there are three groups of people needing to be tracked. In this example, the elderly, highly experienced narrator makes good use of a variety of IRMs as he describes the actions of these three groups: his own Kalapalo relatives, strangers (―Englishmen‖) who are trying to reach a destination but defy the Kalapalo travelling instructions, and enemies or ―fierce people‖ who are not immediately present in the scene of activity but who are to be avoided at all costs. (I have added notes to enable to reader to follow this speaker‘s complex use of the IRM to reference these three groups). The same clause in (iii) serves as both a marking clause and it is also the reference clause for the operator in (v); the reference clause for the operator in (iii) is probably the speech event in (ii). Several features outlined in Table 40 occur here. There are two embedded quoted speech chains (Level D2) (i-ii; vi-viii), and there are at least two reprise chains (Level D3): the first is (ii), repeated from an earlier quote not in this example, and the second (vii-viii). The reference clause that introduces the chain in (i) is the grounding for all the other clauses marking by IRM features. The chain concludes with a final finite clause (xi), together with the concluding major clause chain (Table 40, Level C) segment marker aifa, ―finished‖.

14.3.4 Interclausal reference marking and atehe

In this section I review examples of the manner in which interclausal reference markers interact with atehe the equative copular verb in perfect of persistent situation construction. To repeat Comrie‘s (1976) definition, this is ―a situation that started in the past but continues (persists) into the present‖ (p. 60).
As described in chapter 8, atehe occurs in the Kalapalo ‗recent past perfect‘. Example (a) is an example of the co-occurrence of atehe and IRM =mbe (SS), involving marking the continuity of arguments. The reference clause verb u-tã-ta, ‗I‘ve been rejecting‘ in (i) is in continuous indicative aspect inflection.

14.3.5. Discussion of Kalapalo clause chaining and switch-reference
Interclausal reference marking in Kalapalo involves six basic and at least seventeen compounded interclausal reference markers (IRM) binding not only to verbs but also to various kinds of nouns, and in some cases to adverbial constituents of clauses (see Tables 42, 43). The basic IRM are operators referencing event and argument continuity or discontinuity (switch-reference), while the rest are compounds in which the ―basic‖ argument referencing operators are followed by taxis clitics and adverbial morphemes. Some IRM also include a final ‗event‘ referencing operator (=dye or =dya). In some cases, the compounded elements can function separately, but in others they appear to be fused. The result of this compounding is clause coordinating functions in which the compound morphemes mark both syntactic and semantic clinks between clauses in a chain.
The classic switch-reference systems first described by William H. Jacobsen Jr. (1967) involved cross-clausal reference between subjects or agents. During the last decades of the 20th century, more complex clause chaining and switch-reference systems have been described for world languages, including North American (Jacobsen Jr. 1983) and a number of Amazonian language families: Tucanoan (Guanano/Wanano, called more recently Kotiria, N.E. Waltz 1976), Northern Cariban (Panare (, Payne, 1987: 323-4; Payne and Payne 1999), Panoan (Matses or Mayoruna, Fleck 2003; Amahuaca, Sparing-Chavez 1998), Arawak (Tariana, Aikenvald 2003), Jivaroan, (Aguaruna, Overall, n.d.); Shibipo-Conibo, Valenzuela 2003. The material presented here appears to be the most complete description so far for any Cariban language.
As my many examples illustrate, it is only through examination of extensive narrative discourse that the complexity of the IRM system in Kalapalo grammar is revealed. There are important correlations between clause chaining constructions and the emergent discourse levels occurring in Kalapalo narrative speech. A speaker‘s use of the system is one important index of narrative competence.
Consideration of switch-reference and related compounded forms in the Kalapalo interclausal reference system indicates that what is marked

482
are grammatical relations as Jacobsen first described, but not only referencing subjects or agents. In Kalapalo, event continuity and discontinuity are also referenced. Another consideration is the fact that Kalapalo interclausal reference markers interact with other morphology. These include the =ale, ‗unending‘, =fale,‘new, overlapping‘, =tale, ‗different‘, =fata, ‗simultaneous‘ and =ge, ‗repeated‘ taxis clitics; the ―intensive‖ adverbial infix –ku and the ‗totality‘ adverbial –tufugu, and the active copular root in perfect inflection, atehe. These morphemes take on special meanings as elements of IRM compounds or as complements to the hosts of IRM. Specifically, they are marking both the phasal quality of the event in relation to another event, and also the consequence of the events on participants, particularly undergoers. Put somewhat differently, IRM compounds mark the logic of different kinds of cause-effect relations: anticipated, unanticipated, and resultative. Third, the specification of ―marking clause‖ in a chain reveals the presence of NP constituents of clause chains that cannot be otherwise easily understood as bearing argument functions, particularly in the case of de-verbal nominal aspect constructions. Fourth, while earlier commentary by Longacre declared that nominative-accusative patterns are most often marked by switch-reference, Kalapalo data show that ergative patterns are also involved. To conclude, it can be extremely difficult to predict the occurrence of IRM from purely referential information, as IRM interact with features that are not directly referential of arguments. These include morpho-semantic features motivating logical relations between events (cause-effect, cumulative effect, Perpetual repetition, reason, result); aspectual relations between clauses; and epistemic, mirative, and deontic, as well as locational continuities or changes. These data support Stirling‘s (1993) proposal that interclausal ―continuity of eventuality‖ must be assessed to account for the use of these systems.
The Kalapalo data both support and conflict with other recent discussions about clause-chaining and switch-reference. Longacre (2007:415) explains the presence of medial-final and initial-consecutive chaining structures in different languages, in terms of clausal constituent order differences. Initial-consecutive structures are claimed to be ―relatively uncommon‖. Longacre lists 6-7 world languages that manifest the latter structure, one of which is Panare–a Northern Cariban language spoken in Venezuela. Both types of clause chaining structures are attested for Kalapalo. Further work may elucidate this problem in terms of the presence of several clausal constituent orders related to transitivity, split ergativity, and valence-decreasing phenomena in the language. Also, there is some relation of clause chaining structures to narrative discourse structuring, as one or more initial-consecutive chaining structures are most often embedded (as Level D segments) within a medial-final chain, where object-backgrounding valence-decreasing phenomena often occur in the final clause. Kalapalo data also show examples of both finite and non-finite verb clauses serving as marking clauses (as well as reference clauses). In this regard, Kalapalo is clearly an exception to the notion (from work on other languages) that verbs in such clauses are normally ―deficient‖. Also, Kalapalo marking clauses include deverbal nominalizations, evidence that supports Gildea‘s (2008) argument regarding the parallelism between main

483
clauses and nominalized phrases in Cariban and other Amazonian languages (2008).
The contrast between finite and non-finite verbs influences which clause types can be used as either marking or reference clauses. Also, the pervasive use of word-class changing derivational processes, in particular deverbal nominalizations, but also adverbializations, including ule fronted segment marking clauses, have functions similar to many verbal constructions. While of course relevant for understanding syntactic arguments, these phenomena suggest that switch-reference and clause chaining interact with the multifunctional major Kalapalo word classes; nominal and adverbial, as well as verbal clauses are the hosts of IRM. Furthermore, the tremendous morphosyntactic flexibility these phenomena afford a speaker indicates the utility of an interclausal reference system that assists listeners to track complex arguments across extended discourse, often of considerable time and scope. Of much importance is the fact that the Kalapalo system also manifests ―secondary‖ non-referential semantic functions, of recent interest to linguists (Huang 2000; Jacobsen 1983; Mithun 1993; Stirling 1993; Watkins 1993), that have perhaps been the finding most important for reconceptualizing the nature of switch-reference in world languages. At least one of these functions—temporal simultaneity of an event—overlaps with the Kalapalo taxis marking system, but others– locational, logical, epistemic, mirative, and deontic discontinuity–do not.
The complexity of switch-reference marking in Kalapalo materials suggests the need for further research on the role of underlying de-verbal nominalization and split-ergative phenomena. The multiple means of marking A, P and S argument persistence or change within and across Kalapalo clause chains is a classic switch-reference feature of, but the present data do not show referencing of these as it is very rare to see interclausal alignments vary between reference and marking clauses. Kalapalo ergative casemarked transitive subject (A) often occurs in both reference and marking clauses. However, there are numerous examples of object-backgrounding constructions in the environment of switch-reference.
Haiman and Munro introduce their book on switch-reference (1983a:x) with the statement: ―Canonical switch-reference is an inflectional category of the verb, which indicates whether or not its subject is identical with the subject of some other verb‖. In Kalapalo, the boundaries between the major word classes are not strict insofar as first and second-level derivational processes are pervasive. Roots are shared across classes, which are basically defined syntactically through the formation of stems and inflectional constructions, and prefixed and suffixed inflections may apply to more than one word class. Word class changing derivations are pervasive; de-verbalizations are an important subordination strategy in the language.
Insofar as Kalapalo IRMs interact with taxis and adverbial operators and often have non-referential functions, the system functions more than to coordinate or ―switch‖ reference. Referential continuity in Kalapalo clause chains thus involves both syntactic argument and semantic function continuity or discontinuity. A different term is needed that will capture these clause chain level features, hence I follow Sparing-Chavez (1998) in her use of the label ―interclausal reference marking‖ and the features of interest ―interclausal reference markers‖ (IRM).

484
It is clear from recent work on the topic that switch-reference involves more than the marking of same or different subject. Stirling‘s review of switch-reference in a large number of world languages demonstrates that switch-reference morphemes often have non-referential functions (1993:2). These non-referential functions are sometimes called ―secondary‖, sometimes ―extended‖, suggesting that theoretically linguists consider the basic function to be syntactic (Van Valin Jr. and La Polla 1997). However, Stirling‘s work and that of Watkins (1993) and Mithun (1993) demonstrates that semantic features of interclausal relations are important, and indicates that switch-reference involves agreement or disagreement between clauses (or even larger discourse units; Woodbury 1983). These linguists see switch-reference functioning along various parameters contributing to discourse continuity. Kalapalo data strongly support this expanded view of switch-reference.
Northern Cariban grammars allow comparison of at least some of the Kalapalo IRM morphemes. Payne (1997: 323) lists Panare switchreference morphemes; while some appear to be semantically similar to Kalapalo, morphologically they appear quite different. Derbyshire (1979; 1985b: 247-54) describes several Hixkaryana ―discourse particles‖ that may function in ways similar to the Kalapalo IRM. These are: rma ―same referent, continuity‖; rye: ―sameness, togetherness, mutually related‖; ryhe: ―emphatic prominence, mild contrast‖; xa: ―contrast‖; xarha: ―additive‖; rmarha; ―likewise, in the same way as (something else)‘. (Derbyshire 1979 described these as ―anaphoric particles‖). Cognate morphemes similar in function to my ―taxis‖ set have been well described for the Northern Cariban languages Kalina or Surinam Carib (Hoff 1990); Tiriyo (Meira 1999), Trio (Carlin 2004), and Panare (Payne and Payne 1999).
Recent research on Amazonian languages belonging to different families has revealed clause-chaining and switch-reference systems of unusual complexity. Since the details of these systems are best understood through examination of extended narrative discourse, it is hoped that more data from such contexts will lead to a better typological understanding of these complex phenomena characterized by interaction of multiple features at the syntactic, grammatical, semantic, and discourse pragmatic levels. Indeed, discourse-centered linguistic description research is urgently needed on other Amazonian languages (and especially, Alto Xingu), which may reveal systems similar to Kalapalo interclausal reference marking. Finally, more comparative data from other Cariban languages is hoped for. The use of the interclausal reference system is an important sign of a Kalapalo speaker‘s competence, the ability to construct elaborate narratives that listeners are able to readily follow, and also to remember and tell to others. In the past, all knowledge and understanding of the external and internal worlds, fantasy, and speculative thought was developed and passed on from one generation to another through narrative discourse. This suggests that IRM must be considered a diachronic phenomenon related to the needs of a community of thinkers. As younger people lose interest in their ancestral narrative art form, the entire system described in this chapter has become the most endangered feature of the language, itself at considerable risk overall.

14.4 The primary topical participant marker –fa

Participant tracking of the primary topical participant (PTP) is an important feature in ordinary Kalapalo conversational discourse, and crucially important to the clause-chaining functions of interclausal reference marking. The suffix–fa references only animate beings in S or A function but may appear suffixed to the verb phrase. It is treated here as separate from the IRM system as –fa often occurs in simple imperative and in yes/no interrogative clauses, and it is commonly hosted by a demonstrative, by the relative clause modifer, and by the ‗reason‘ coordination clause lexeme (described in Chapter 13). PTP is also used in conversational turns, where the new primary topical participant is the 2nd person singular addressee. This function is illustrated in (1a) (an imperative), and (1b) (an interrogative); in both cases only a simple ‗yes‘ or ‗no´response is required:

1. a. a-tsa-ke-fa 2-listen-I-PTP ‗Listen.‘

b. te-lu-fa? go.away-PI-PTP (rising tone)
‗Are you leaving?‘

In cases where two adjacent clauses exhibit changes in topicality, or where the same topic participant appears but in a new argument function (S becomes A; A→O), -fa indicates topical continuity in the face of NP modification or clausal complementation. As the examples in the following sections demonstrate, -fa can appear on a subordinate or adverbial clause as well as a main clause, where it often appears on the S or A NP. –fa may also be suffixed to an IRM form, as in `14.3.2.a, line iii.

14.4.1. –fa in complement clause constructions

The primary topical participant marker –fa often is used to mark a switch from one A to another (and where the first A→O) in a complement clause
construction. In (a) the new marked A is the dangerous tocandira ant sike, which contrasts with the 2nd person human A in the immediately preceding
clause which is now 2p O in the final clause:

a. u-ifi-fo-lu=nafa

e-feke] sike-feke-fa

1-touch-MAL-PI-EM 2-ERG ant-ERG-PTP

e-fi-fe-po-lï 2-bite-Vt-HYP-PI ‗I‘m sure you know if you were to touch (i.e., copulate with) me, the ant would bite you‖.

14.4.2. –fa on subordinate clauses and adverbial adjuncts

a.

This example illustrates use of –fa marking the argument of an

adverbial clause that is adjunct to the main reference clause in line

486

(a), to signal the shift in topicality to a new S in the immediately following NP which initiates a new chain.

far-ADV-somewhat.farther-INT=SE-PTP 3-uncle-POSS

‗someone else not much farther away (from them), his

uncle.‘

b. This example illustrates another use of the primary topical participant suffix on a subordinate clause. The head of the reference clause is a valence-decreased transitive verb Ø-ñ-aŋu-nda-ko-lefa (‗and so they played them‘) in which P is backgrounded to become part of the action description. By means of this process, a 2argument ergative clause becomes nominative-accusative. There is no overt A NP and the Ø- realized 3rd person A proclitic is in S/O position. The syntactic function structure is thus nominativeaccusative. But in line (ii) the head of the main clause is a finite transitive verb; there is a subordinate clause hosting the –fa suffix. The same verb –aŋu- ―play a musical instrument‖ has become fully (or more) transitive by means of the transitive derivational affix -ŋe; the rgument structure is completed with the required final ergative NP, in which 3rd person plural A (marked by 3rd person proclitic i-; plural A suffix -ni) is inflected with the ergative case marker –feke. The –fa suffix marks topic continuity in the face of a switch from S in the reference clause to A in the marking clause.

and so they went away to play the long flutes‘.

14.4.3. Preserving continuity of primary topical participant

In (14.4.3.a), -fa preserves continuity of the topical participant (the thatching grass) at a boundary between the chain and an embedded quoted conversation.

14.4.4. Relation between -fa and the marking and reference clauses
The following example shows the relation between the primary topical participant marker -fa, and the marking and reference clauses in a sample of narrative discourse in which there is requirement for switch-reference. The primary topical participant is a magical arrow (an animate being, though with the appearance of an object). Initially, the semantic function of the arrow is as undergoer (‗feeling shame‘). Later, the primary topical participant is the object of a search by its temporary owner (Agakuni) who had kept it in his possession. What is also going on here is that –fa is marking switch function. In (14.3.4.1), there are two clause chains (a-b; cd). (a) shows –fa on the main intransitive verb clause, which is the initial clause in the chain. Also in (a), a marking clause in the chain ends with =mbedya (same subject, different successive event) which references a new event to appear in the immediately following clause in (b). This chain ends with a clause marked with the end of chain =lefa metonymic taxis. In the second chain, (c) describes the actions on O, and (as in a) the initial clause is suffixed with -fa. Example (d) includes its own coordinate medial marking clause (=mbele, CU); cumulative effect of events), and a final

488

clause marked with the end of chain marker =lefa. It seems that the presence of =lefa at the end of each smaller chain links the two into a larger one. Although in (d) the same adverb (ifaki, ―departed, left‖) is repeated first with the IRM =mbele (CU) and second, with the MT =lefa, the only possible reference clause is in (b) of the initial chain. As the marking clause in (d) references the reference clause in (b), both (b) and (d) are also linked phasally by the MT suffix. Although the reference clause verb in (b) is non-finite thetic, its role as reference clause is marked by the event coordinating taxis clitic =lefa (MT). All relevant markers and their glosses are in boldface. The semantic glosses for all switch-reference markers are in parentheses in the English translations.

‗Nothing. It has gone away (as a consequence of all that), it has

disappeared.‘

14.4.5 –fa and split-ergativity
The use of the –fa suffix seems to also have some relationship to splitergativity phenomona, as illustrated in (14.3.5.1), where both reference and marking clauses are nominative-accusative, and the latter is a valencedecreasing (object-backgrounding) clause. In the latter, P is backgrounded while A argument is preserved. This example is thus relevant to Givon‘s (1983) discussion of the topic-continuity function of switch-reference in the environment of ―de-transitivization‖, although Kapalo object-

489

backgrounding cannot be termed ―de-transitive‖ as A argument is still marked on the verb.
In example (a.v), A is explicitly marked in several ways: 1) in the NP tisuge, (1+3) ‗exclusive we‘, which is foregrounded (by placement in first position in the clause), and 2) by means of the pronominal reflexive/coreferential t- prefixed to the verb. In the sequence of lines in (14.3.5.), -fa preserves topical continuity in the environment of a change of argument function in which there is a switch from S in the imperative reference clause (i) to A in the object-backgrounding marking clause (v). -fa is suffixed to the 1+3 (exclusive ―we‖) independent pronoun (A of the marking clause). This valence-decreasing clause does not allow for ergative marking of A; marking of the semantic ―actor‖ function of the argument is achieved with object-backgrounding marker -ñ which here appears to function to maintain topic continuity. In this regard, -fa appears to function in a manner similar to the reference-tracking function of switch-reference insofar as it helps to minimize referential ambiguity.

14.5 Focus structures and topical expressions: review
To conclude, I briefly review the types of focus structures and topical expressions in Kalapalo that have been discussed in this

490
chapter as well as in earlier places in this grammar. There are several kinds of focus structure and topical expression distinguished syntactically and grammatically and also with regard to the size of the syntactic unit involved and the scope of the focal or topical function. Chapter references are given for each structure discussion in the list.
Focus structures involve assertions that differ from presupposed information. In Kalapalo they are succinct preposed syntactic elements. These include:
a) Preposed ule clauses, which mark a change from the prior focus on characters and event sequences to a new focus. This is the broadest thpe of focus structure as it references a prior narrative segment (Chapter 14).
b) The use of the identificational demonstrative igei, to focus upon a noun phrase that is the argument of a preceding clause (Chapter 6).
c) The use of the adnominal demonstrative to mark the head of a relative clause (Chapter 6).
d) Movement of the clausal constituent core or oblique argument to first position, before the O argument NP. This is the narrowest type of focus structure (Chapter 5).
Topical expressions involve assertions marked grammatically as different from presupposed information. In Kalapalo, the scope of topical marking always transcends the grammatical constituent hosting the marker. In Kalapalo, there are several of these topical structures.
a) The -fa suffix marks the primary topical participant in a switch function context. This generally occurs on a noun phrase, and references the marked NP as the same primary topical participant as one to follow in new syntactic function (Chapter 14).
b) The anaphoric focus referent ule, when postposed to a transitive subordinate clause, where the main clause is intransitive, functions to mark switch-reference, S→O. The scope includes both clauses (Chapter 13).
c) Taxis clitics marking relations between events occur on VP and other syntactic constituents; their scope includes more than one clause, usually two but sometimes more than two in cases of sequences of related events (Chapters 3 and14).
d) Interclausal reference markers which reference argument relations as continuous or discontinuous mark new information about a prior topical referent, or make a new topical referent accessible by linking it to old or presupposed information (Chapter 14).

Mïti, a story told by the Kalapalo leader Kambe at Aifa, /1/79

This unflattering story about the origin of some Kayapo people was told by Kambe, one of the main hereditary leaders living in Aifa during my visit during 1979-82. Tufule, another hereditary leader, told me this story is “not good”, and that in the past women did not listen to it because it was thought to cause the birth of twins. Consequently, he said, not many people know about it. As Kambe told it, this story has many good examples of the use of multiple epistemic morphemes as used in conversational interaction.

‘Upe, the ‘jaguar’s flanks were crushed’. Told by the song master and story master Kudyu at Aifa, August, 1979

This is a segment taken from a longer narrative, which includes a few didactic lines from Kudyu the storyteller, as was usual with this narrator. The explanation concerns upe, a plant medicine for a child who becomes sick when her father kills a jaguar.
