SECTION 2. NOUNS
Nouns as words and expressions always occur with the affix -a function marker for nouns (with the allomorph -e which occurs only after -e).

For a more detailed description of how nouns are formed, see grammar statement, and for a more complete list of nouns, see the lexicon file. Here are presented some of the shorter and more common nouns for quick mastery and use in the frames in the other sections.

Noun expressions made up of a single noun can fill the subject slot of verb less sentences. A good frame for learning is:

1. Q. 2. Q.

(noun) (noun)

pa.

A. (noun)

.

pa.

A. (anóhi) + noun base + y'ym + a)

"No, it isn't a ..."

Example:

Q. Nereómawa pa.

your pet

question

A. Sereómawa. my pet

or A. or A. or A. or A.

Há. Á'ee. Anóhi. Anóhi sereomawy'yma.

"Is it your pet?"
"Yes, it is."
"Yes." "Yes." "No." "No, it isn't my pet."

or A. A sharp intake of breath with slight lift of eyebrows signifies an affirmative answer.

Question:

Ipirí'as pa.

he hot

question

"Is he angry?"

Any of the descriptive verbs will yield the following types of answer:

1. Positive

- repeat verb or á'ee, etc.

2. Negative - + anóhi + verb + neg. suffix y'ym.

3. Negative - + anóhi + verb + affixes n-_____-ihi.

Person Prefixes are: se-
nei/h seneorepe-

I am _____ you are _____ he is _____ (on certain stems zero prefix with stem changes) we incl. are _____ we excl. are _____ you pl. are _____

Examples:

Sepiráhy. "I'm angry." Nepiráhy. "You're angry."
Ipiráhy. Senepiráhy. Orepiráhy. Pepiráhy.

Serorywéte. Nerorywéte.
Horywéte.
etc.

"I'm happy."

7

Before affix class 5 there is morphophonemic change in certain stems. The stems are grouped thus:
1. Vowel final, i.e. ipiráhy - ipirahyóho.
2. S final changes from submember [y] ipirí'as to submember S, ipiri'asóho.
3. Nasal consonant final changes to non-stop non-nasal of same point of articulation, i.e. íkam - ikawóho.
4. Nasal consonant final which does not change, ipóraŋ - iporaŋóho.

Frame Drill for learning descriptive verbs will be:

1. Question 2. Answer

(verb) pa. (verb) .

or 1. Question 2. Answer

(verb) pa. anóhi verb y'ym.

or 1. Question 2. Answer

(verb) pa. anóhi n- (verb) -ihi.

Examples: 1. 2. 3.

Íkam pa. Íkam pa. Íkam pa.

íkam. anóhi ikawý'ym. anóhi na(í)kawihi.

5th Order affixes of very frequent use are:

-y'ym -oho

negative
exaterative, possibly the most common of all, and used all over the place where we'd say, "He's really _____" or various other markers.

Either of these constitutes a good frame for these verbs:

Examples:

Í'am pa. I'awóho.

"Does he have much hair?" "Does he ever ..."

I'awý'ym. "No."

Very often nouns are used in conjunction with these verbs in an equative relationship, i.e.
Né'awa ipóko.
your hair it-is-long

8

Frame: Drill:

noun descriptive verb .
Use appropriate nouns with verbs. It would be good to write down in a notebook which nouns have an affinity for which verbs and learn them together for automatic use at a later date, so that there will be no problem of pondering semantic limitations right in the middle of a conversation.

Examples: a woman (kósoa) is beautiful (iáro). A young woman (kosé'ia) is beautiful (ipóraŋ). A girl
Food (hemí'oa) is good to eat (hé'e).
(Ywyrápara ikáto) A bow is useful, works.
(Akomá'ee háto) A man is strong, brave, hard.
i.e. the same quality that enables a man to move logs is the one that keeps him from running from enemy arrows. A house ... probably ikáto 'good' or iáro 'pretty'
The fatter the animal, the better (íkam) for eating.

Drill:

Run through various hypothetical situations where an utterance of surprise or wonder is called for.

Isn't it big! It really hurts!

Iwiseóho. Háhy.

The intonation and final length is best learned from a native speaker.

SECTION 4. INTRANSITIVE VERBS (More commom ones)

1. Frame + Subject: noun + pred.: intr. verb.
Drill Find nouns which have a semantic affinity for each of these verbs and learn the pairs in the frame with proper rhythm, etc.

Examples:

Sáwara óson.

dog

he-ran

Wýra
bird

owéwe.
it-flies

"The dog is running, ran." "The bird is flying, flew."

2. Frame + Verb + Affixes from Affix Order 5

Drill:

Group these verbs according to morphophonemic changes as in Section 3 and use the various suffixes as frames for learning.

Examples:
Óken. Okeráme. Okénta.

"He slept."

Okeróho. "He really slept, he slept big."

"He's sleeping now."

"He's going to sleep."

10

Examples:

Okerý'ym. "He didn't sleep."

Okery'ýmta. "He's not going to sleep."

Okentaráme. "He's going to sleep now."

Okeréte.

"He sleeps a lot."

(rare usage)

Okentaróho . "He's going to sleep now (but probably shouldn't be)."

3. Frame + Relational Phrase + Verb

Drill:

This will have to be tied in with the section on relationals. The main problem will be when the subject is 3rd person and the predicate comes after the relational phrase. The verb then takes the deemphasized form.

Examples:

(form: i- + stem /with morphophonemic change)

(h)

+ i/s

Kwé íhas. (instead of áha)

"He went far away."

far he went

Ká'aa pype iátas.
jungle in he walks

"He's hunting in the jungle."

Ywýkwara pype í'ari.

hole

in he fell

"He fell in the hole."

Tópawa pype íkeri.
hammock in he sleeps

"He's sleeping in the hammock."

4. Frame: Drill:

Person prefix + stem
Learn all of the regular verbs with all of the person prefixes so that control is automatic.

aereosaoropee-

I you he, she, it, they we inclusive we exclusive you plural and imperative imperative

Examples: verb: to sit

aápyŋ, ereápyŋ, oápyŋ,

saápyŋ, oroápyŋ, peápyŋ, eápyŋ.

11

Frame: (Negative..other) n/na verb

(He doesn't, can't, won't --linear-- as opposed to He didn't--punctiliar--, isn't)
ihi/shi

Drill:

Run through all in all the persons.

Examples: Nókerihi. "He doesn't sleep." Násonihi. "I don't run." (I can't run.)

11. Violent action opýhy grab onópo hit osóka kill owáhy make hurt oýwo shoot (with bow & arrow) oó'o bite

12. Cutting
okýsi okýtyŋ omasáraŋ omanáhaŋ omómoŋ okótoŋ omosýwaŋ

slice grate split chop, cut pierce pierce, sew, give injection write, carve?

Frame 1. + Object (noun) + Verb + Subject: noun

Examples: Áŋa oápo.

house he makes

Sáwara onópo.

dog he hits

Sáwara onópo akoma'e. dog he hits man

Maní'aŋa opýkos.

manioc he roasts

etc.

"The man hits the dog."

Frame 2. Person prefix + stem

Examples:

aápo

I make

ereápo you make

eápo

make!

oápo

he makes

saápo oroápo peápo

we incl. we excl. you pl.

senópo ± ipe
nenópo (onopo)
senenópo orenópo ± ipe penópo oronópo

I hit you hit we incl. we excl. you pl. you s/pl

Frame 3. Negative + stem
n/na______________ihi
Examples: noápoihi

Frame 4. Verb + Affix 5

Examples:
onopoóho

he hit big

onopóte (~ with ete after consonant final) really hit

13

Examples:
onoporáme onopopóta
onopoý'ym

right now future negative

Frame 5. + Relational Phrase + Verb + Object
This should be studied in conjunction with the section on relationals. The verb in the 3rd person subject will be in the de-emphasized form with the object indicated in the prefix.

Examples:

i-(h) 3 s/p se- 1 s ne- 2 s sene- 1 pi ore- 1 pe pe- 2 p

Séraŋa pype " " " " "

inópos. He was bit in my house. senópos. I was bit in my house. nenópos. You were bit in my house. senenópos. We(incl) were bit in my house. orenópos. We(excl) were bit in my house. penópos. You(pl) were bit in my house.

For other relevant and common types of frames, do combinations of the above, checking your ideas with an informant.

SECTION 6. NON-INITIATING VERBS This will make one of the big differences between your sounding like a native or like a
foreigner in communication of a series of predications. Best material can be gotten from texts. A few general rules apply:
(1) This type of verb forms the nucleus of a shorter (different) clause on the sentence level or of the main clause of non-initiating (dependent) sentences on the paragraph level.
(2) As a clausette, it usually occurs after the main clause (often more than one), as a list in a series of actions.
(3) If it occurs before the main clause, it is something of a subordinate condition or time clause.
(4) As predicate of non-initiating sentence, it carries the same weight as an initiating verb if the sentence were first in the sequence.

Frames: 1. 2. 3.

Object, Transitive Predicate, Non-init. pred., Non-init. pred.

Subject Intr.

, Non-init. pred., Non-init. pred...

Relat. phrase + either "

"

etc. in various combinations

14

Another type of verb which in most cases looks like the non-initiating type of verb is the auxiliary. It forms an expression with the main verb. It is made up of a limited list of directional type verbs. Learn to use these verbs in their various types of combinations. A dependent clause is usually made up of one verb and the object is different from that of the independent clause.

Examples of the above: (Note that many sentences are predominantly made up of verbs.)

1. Soówia amanáhaŋ oéka /

grass I-cut

I-here (now)

imanáhaka / ipéhita.

it-cutting

it-raking.

Initiating auxilary

non-init.

non-init.

2. Oatapóta oéha / isókao.

I walk will I go

it kill

Init.

aux. non-init.

3. Á'e-ramo ahapóta, oeátao, hérota,

This result of I go will "and so" Relational initiating

I hunt it bring non-init. non-init.

isókao mísara siwá'aa.
it kill deer wild pig non-init. object object "And so I'm going to go hunting and kill deer and wild pig to bring."

Non-initiating verbs (only of transitive and intransitive type) are made up thus: non-init. prefixes, stem, non-init. suffix

Intransitive Prefixes (reflect subject) oe- 1 s e- 2 s o- 3 s sere- 1 pi ore- 1 pe
? pese- 2 p

Transitive

Prefixes (reflect object)

se-

1s

ne-

2s

i (h)- 3 s/p

sene-

1 pi

ore-

1 pe

pe-

2p

Suffix 1. After multi-stem verbs, occurs with the one that ends in a stop. -a. Ex. ópam - ópapa, áken - oéketa, etc.

15

Suffix 2. After single stem consonant final verbs: just adds -a. Ex. óson - ósona
3. After vowel final stems: -o. Ex. áha - oéhao (Note: as auxiliary verb it does not occur with -o.) osóka - isókao, senópo - senópoo
4. After /s/ [y] final stems:-ta Ex. opýkos - ipykósta
When a verb with the suffix pota or ta (probably from the verb potan, potat-, potar- "to want, like...") occurs as non-init. verb, the suffix changes to stop final form.
á'opota - i'opótata opykósta - ipykóstata
Drill: Learn paradigms of all the verbs from the other sections in this frame:
ahapota oéketa oesáhoka oeátao
isókao + object etc.
Where semantically unlikely combinations result, find a frame that works better.
From here on, the possibilities are wide and limitations can be great on what combinations fit together. One should look for those verbs that have semantic affinity and learn them in pairs, triplets, etc. with object, subject or relational phrase.

SECTION 7. THE IRREGULAR VERBS
The irregular verbs have been given in earlier sections. Practice here is with paradigms for memorization in whatever frame the student finds suitable. (One regular verb is given for comparison--irregular forms are starred.)

The morphophonemics of ramo, ri and clitics following nouns or verbs:
1. In p, m, w, t, n, r, k, ŋ, ŋ verbs, they occur with w, r, and ŋ final stems and the first consonant of the clitic or postpositional drops.
2. In m, n, or ŋ verbs they occur with m, n, and ŋ and first consonant drops.
3. In /s/ [y] final verbs, the /s/ is in [y] form and the first consonant of postpositional or clitic is retained.
4. With vowel final verbs, the first consonant is retained and there is no change in verb stem.

Examples: 1. 2. 3. 4

ípaw-amo íson-amo íkas-ramo inópo-ramo

when it's finished (was finished) when he runs (ran) when it burns (burned) when he hits him (hit)

Nouns, when occuring with ramo, ri, etc. drop the -a and then act like verbs.

ó'ia ó'i-ramo

manioc flour

hósa hós-ramo etc. tooth

Meanings and other details are described in the grammar statement, but full control will eventually come only with extensive listening and experimentation.

SECTION 9. SATELLITE
The use of these words rounds out ideas in certain areas which would hardly be considered necessary to the average conversation, yet which are almost obligatory in the Asuriní sentence.

20

The most common word is no which has a little of the flavor of "again, also" but considering the number of times it is used, the meaning is much "thinner" than the English counterpart.

SEMANTIC PROBLEMS: 1. Some tense ideas:
Áha. Aháte. Ó'o. Ahapóta.
Ahay'ýmta. Nahapó'tarihi. Tahaéme. Nahapótarihi. Náhaihi. Oapoý'ym á'ee.

"He went." "He always goes." "He ate it. He eats it." (i.e. He likes it so doesn't refuse it, etc.) "He wants to go." "He will go." "He would like to go." "He doesn't want to go." "He isn't going to go." "He wanted to go (but couldn't)." "He didn't want to go." "He didn't go." "He isn't able to work, do..."

2. To know a person or fact or process, etc. okwáham

3. amána I give to you, him, etc. ómon, erémon, émon (imperative) you, he gives to me

4. To pass by or near má'owa ropi íhas.

5. Verbs that often occur with postpositional phrases

omá'e héhe;

emá'e seréhe; ama'epóta neréhe;

okyýse isóhi; akyýse neóhi; erekyýse seóhi.

6. Quote sentence í'i it (he) said ére (it) you said á'e (it) I said

Irregular verb

Frame: Quotation_________ í'i
ére á'e

Probably the very common oro'e "I tell you??" fits here.
Example: "Aóse" oró'e kos. Don't! I'm telling you ...

7. Foreign ideas (verbs; for nouns see dictionary file)

read - oésaŋ "see"

omá'e pápee rehe

"look at"

I don't really think they get the full idea yet but one did say,

omoŋéta "He causes the paper to express itself."

23

7. Foreign ideas (verbs; for nouns see dictionary file)

write

okanakánam "to bend"

omopínim

"to scrape little lines" ??

omosýwaŋ

"to cause arm to turn" ???

None of these make too much sense as I see the constituent parts, but they name

more for outward appearance as a rule instead of function.

play guitar onópo "hit"

buy osó'oŋ "fetch"?

sell owéne "yeah!" I have not yet found a way to say "It's worth much.", but one could say, one takes much money to buy.

8. The Asuriní use não presta instead of mau to translate the words
iawáspam not worth anything ikatoý'ym it's not good Moral judgments are scant. See paper on culture, etc.

9. Reduplication is a plural of sorts but the student should be careful to use it where the native speakers do.

Examples: Okwakwakwákwan. "It's all full of holes."

Onoponópo.

"He hit again and again." or "He claps."

Oseheséhen.

"(Water) splashed and splashed."

10. Greetings

1. ásan népyri -- eresan sepyri

I come you visit -- you come me visit

2. asaráme

-- eresarame

3. má'ee pa

(see first section)

11. Hortative and Command

Hortative:

Ére. Ére sasáhoŋ. É ke saata. Kwarahypýteripe ke sáha.

"Let's go." "Let's go bathe." "Let's go hunting." ?? "At noon let's go."

Command: e + verb "you___________!"

éken, esa-ésan, epyhyŋý'ym

sleep! run!

don't grab!

24

12. Problem concepts

a) Before and after clauses of English, i.e. in English we can say:

1. Before he comes, I'll go. subordinate-main

2. I'll go before he comes. main-subordinate

3. After I go he'll come.

subordinate-main

4. He'll come after I go.

main + subordinate

I have not found a way to say 1. and 2. above except to put them in the form of 3. or 4. They may have a way but I doubt it. You can express the above combinations thus:

Ahapóta ísee. Á'e-ramo itóntari no.

I go will I

then

he will come

Séha-ramo itóntari.
my going when he come will

b) Always . . . expressed by the suffix -te (order 5) Hahýte. "It hurts every day." (Of course "always" here is relative.)

Also expressed by áspa "always". This could bear more research since I have only heard it once in connection with Bible stories I was translating.
Áspa ítoni Eréosa. "Always was God."

c) never . . . is the negative n - ihi opposed to-y'ym.

Ipakória o'oý'ym.

"He didn't eat bacuri."

bacuri

he eat not

Ipakória nó'oshi.

bacurí

not-he-eat-not

"He doesn't eat bacuri." /but also he hasn't eaten bacuri/

d) today . . . expressed by suffix -rame "now" and/or aux. verb -ka

Má'ee pa

ereaporáme heréka.

what question you do now linear

e) tomorrow . . . expressed by the phrase osé'i we. This is such a closely knit bundle that the suffix -pota (fut.) goes on the -we instead of the ose'i.

f) two days from now . . . expressed by mókos ikéntari (sakénta etc). Here the subject of the verb -ken sleep, is the same as that of the whole theme.

i.e. Mókos orokénta,

á'e-ramo arahapóta.

two we (excl) sleep will then

we'll go

25

g) three days from now . . . Na'íroshi ikéntari.

three

he sleeps will

h) many days from now . . . Heta ikéntari. many he sleep will

i) one month . . . Here it is good to check a calendar and see what the moon will be doing and explain.
Sáhya ohémta á'eramo.
moon return will then . . .

j) two months etc.

Mókos ihémtari sáhya _____.
two returns moon . . . . . . .

k) yesterday or recent past . . . expressed by ýma we or the satellite words raka and ra'e. Thus:
Ýma we íhas.
yesterday he went (or some time ago he went)
Kwé raka heráhas ýhara.
far rec.past he took (the) canoe
A long time ago or a long time went by: ý::::ma we.

l) frequently . . . by héta + verb or -ete (suffix)

Okeréte.

"He sleeps a lot."

Héta íkeri. " " " "

(This area will bear some more analysis.)

m) causal relationship . . . this has already been discussed some but will bear a reminder. In English we like to join clauses by functional words to show this relationship. For the Asuriní, this is not necessary. Just the fact that you say two sentences together seems to signal that they are related. If and because clauses, quite different in English, seem to be somewhat alike in Asuriní.

Examples:

If he wants to eat, he'll go hunt. and He went hunting, because he wanted to eat.

When he was hungry, he went hunting. and When he's hungry, he goes hunting.

These types are basically different in English, yet the ground they have in common is substantial and the Asuriní way of saying them includes mainly the common ground, i.e., a sequence, with some dependence, some cause--effect from first predication to second.

26

Thus: Ity'aráhy-ramo iátas áha.
or Ity'aráhy oáta áha.
or Ity'aráhy. Á'e-ramo iátas áha. (Check these with an informant).

n) comparative and superlative . . . There is nothing here to equal the English good, better, best, etc.

ikáto good

ikatoéte very good

I have never heard anything like a comparative or superlative, and in conversations with the Post man, I've noted that the Indians look blank when he uses the Portuguese comparative. Their method of comparison might be reflected in a sentence I heard in Portuguese: "____sabe muito mas ________ também sabe um bocado," i.e. "____ knows really a lot, but _________ also knows quite a bit."

o) in vain, unfortunately . . . This is a very common satellite word and represents what I like to call negative attitude on the part of the speaker towards the situation or statement he's making. It indicates that the thing is prejudicial to the speaker.

Ýwa rehe pane

áha. "He went hunting (by sitting in a tree),

tree into but w/o result I went but without result, i.e., didn't get anything."

Tátoa pane

ón seópe. Oséwyr-owe

áha.

armadillo w/o result came to me

he returned however and went

(Here the situation is negative because it didn't come close enough to kill.)

Sasí'oa pane

seó'o no. "The mosquito bit me again

mosquito w/o result me bite (unfortunately)."

p) quickly: Kówe kówe-sowe _________________.

q) slowly: Meéwes __________________. Both are adverbs (generally occur first in sentence and exert de-emphasis on verb).

r) like this: this i.e.,

ésno, no
ésno + clause or just No. (demonstrating)

Ésno ke

isókao ma'éa'aa mo hérota.

thus hortative kill it game

some (we'll) bring it

(we'll)

27

s) perhaps: éspo + clause (an adverb) ________ + sawa Ahapóta sawa. "He might go."
Also attested, unattested here is by nature: rimo - probably (I didn't see) ripo - certain (I did see)

t) intensity: lots, bigly: -oho O'aróho.

hard :

-rahy Omamaráhy.

a little: pípi Amanáhaŋ.

"He really fell." "He threw it hard." "I cut a little (grass)."

u) only: sowe "which" and also means "like"

i.e., Tapí'ira sowe oáta. "He walks like a tapir."

Ísee sowe.

"It's like me." or "He's my likeness."

Oséwyr-owe áha.

"He only turned and went."

i.e. He didn't come any farther.

.

v) yes: ha or á'ee ± a clause built around the a'ee which refers back to

the subject/object of question

ha has more the flavor of a pleasurable affirmative rather than a'ee which is only informative

w) no:

anóhi - no ± and aóse

verb in

n-----------ihi

or

--------y'ym

--------eme

which means "stop it!"

and don't touch epyhyŋý'ym

x) rectification: (mistake)__________má'ee . . . (pause) . . . (correction)

y) thanks; There is no word but one can say ikatoéte "That's very good."

z) do what I say: Sesé'eŋa ropi eápo á'ee.

Akwawa sé'eŋa ropi pa

eresé'eŋ. "Can you talk Indian?"

Indian speech with question you talk

or Erekwaham pa

akwawa se'eŋa.

you know question Indian talk

"Do you know Indian talk?"

28

aa) You can try a transliterated Portuguese verb stem in an Asuriní verb frame and it almost always communicates and very often will get you the native equivalent. When we took a boy informant to Belém for a linguistic workshop, he said that he preferred the airplane to the "motor" because:

Somi'apápyŋa oparapára.

motor

it stopped-stopped

"It stopped so often."

bb) To ask about (perguntar) and ask for (pedir) are signalled by one word: Okwawé'eŋ.

cc) To date we have not found a word for "wait (for)" or "hope" but have found a word for "believe"--oatýwan.

dd) The word for "cry" represents sadness in adults. Eresaá'a pa. "Were you sad (when he went)?"

ee) For concepts like "work", they are always specific, as cutting grass, etc. The word oápo "to make, do, work at, work on" is transitive, so must refer to something specific. Ex. Maní'aŋa oroápo aráka. manioc we excl. worked at

MISCELLANEOUS a) Time expressions:

ypýton imo kwaráha ramo kwarahypípi

at night (relat. phrase) late afternoon " " late afternoon adverb dawn

b) The area where the investigator has done the least work is the specific meanings of all the demonstratives.

c) Verb "to be". People jokingly say "What's the word for 'to be' in your language?" It so

happens we have two: ítoni "to exist, be" or -ka "to be located". The difference is

something like haver and estar in Portuguese but used differently in most respects. For

the verb ser of quality and estar of temporary condition the descriptive verbs stand

alone as a complete predication.

estar of location is:

-ka as Mó pa hékas.

"Where is he?"

or

Ó'aŋa pype hékas.

"He is in his own house."

haver of being, existence: Á ítoni akýkya.

"There are guaribas

(here in this jungle)."

d) The day ypýton-imo : at night

ár-imo

: at day

CORRECTIONS--ADDITIONS TO MAIN GRAMMAR STATEMENT A. Check on 1. hatya pa iaro wa'e
2. pina emon a'ee B. Check -te (rete??) Affix 5 C. Check for words not in dictionary file. D. The Lexicon file contains words which in the large part are used so often as to be
inescapable. In the time I spent with the Asuriní, I concentrated on learning to talk, not on amassing a dictionary of taxonomic completeness. The vocabulary is functional but not complete by any means. Some day the job will have to be done, i.e., each part of the manioc plant has a name and all parts of the process are named. I do not have this kind of information. Plant names, of which there are many, are almost all derived from water yand earth ywy-. I have only a few of these. For the purposes of learning to communicate quickly, it is much more important to be able to say, "What do you call the hair of a manioc root?" than to know the exact name. For these purposes you will find that the words presented in this grammar are the most common short ones and are probably easily controllable in a short time. The Indians are extremely patient and make an effort to understand even the silliest mistakes. They are so impressed at any attempt to learn their language that they are quick to help wherever it is needed. The tendency has been to overestimate our progress, and I found many of them speeding up to normal speech before we were ready for it. At slow speed the language is easy to understand. At high speed, with any of the emotional hypermorphemes, we are in trouble. One of the most common features is what I call the features of pitch curve, laryngealization and centralization of vocoids. It leaves the contrastive signal system hanging on a few consonants, which all come out lenis, and so p and m sound like w, t and n sound like r, etc.
