1. Introduction
The study of pidgin and creole languages was a “matter of minor importance” (Holm 1988: 1-3) for many years and it is only in the 50s and 60s of the 20th century that it established itself as an academic discipline. Today it is believed that creole studies offer a unique perspective in several areas of linguistics, such as historical linguistics, sociolinguistics, language contact studies, language acquisition, language change and applied linguistics (Lefebvre 2000: 130). Moreover, creole studies are considered to be of practical value for the areas of language planning, lexicography and development of teaching materials (Holm 1988: 4).
In recent years, many aspects and areas of creole linguistics witnessed extensive study, and the last decades have seen an enormous increase in theoretical generalisations about creole genesis. However, the area of creole morphology, and especially word-formation, received relatively little attention so far. The long-lasting belief which shaped the debate in creole linguistics for years was that pidgin and creole languages have little or no morphology (Seuren and Wekker 1986: 66; Thomason 2001: 168), or that in language contact situations morphological markers are lost and never reconstituted later (Bickerton 1988: 278). Recent work on this topic (e.g. Plag 2003a; 2003b; in press) has shown that morphological markers and processes are neither non-existent nor marginal in creole languages and that morphological formatives can be either developed or preserved in language contact situations.
Despite useful recent contributions in the field of creole morphology (Braun and Plag 2003; Brousseau et al. 1989; DeGraff 2001; Dijkhoff 1993; Jones 1995; Lefebvre 1998; Mühlhäusler 1995a; Plag 2001; 2003a; 2003b; in press; Sebba 1981; Van den Berg 2000) which have helped us gain many insights into this terra incognito of creole studies, there is a range of issues which, to my knowledge, remain almost uninvestigated. Thus, very little is known about the emergence and development of word-formation systems as a whole in situations of language contact, and not many studies trace this development at the initial stages. This is, however, of crucial importance since it is at the very beginning of contact that most drastic restructuring of linguistic systems (morphological
11

systems included) takes place. Moreover, little has been said about the fate of derivation-compounding and compounding-syntax borderline in contact situations and whether distinctions usually made in non-contact languages can still be made after an extreme linguistic restructuring caused by contact. Finally, the seldom asked question is in how far the emergence of creole word-formation systems can be attributed to the universals of language acquisition, and how much they owe to the source languages, both substratum and superstratum.
The present study focuses on the emergence of word-formation devices and processes in Early Sranan, an English-based creole language spoken in the 18th-19th centuries in Suriname, a former Dutch colony on the north-east coast of South America. An investigation of Early Sranan word-formation is of especial interest on two grounds. On the one hand, Sranan is a radical creole which developed relatively rapidly and in relative isolation from its lexifier English. On the other hand, Sranan is one of the few creole languages on which a fairly large amount of reliable early data is available.
Based on the issues raised above, three major aims are pursued in the present study. The first aim is to show what word-formation devices and processes Early Sranan developed in the first 200 years of its existence and what happens to the derivational morphemes and word-formation means of the source languages in creolisation. The second aim is to identify and describe the major mechanisms operating in the genesis of word-formation devices and the major strategies used by creole creators in moulding their word-formation. The third aim is to investigate what types of influence, substratum, superstratum, or other, played a role in the emergence of word-formation and what factors constrained this influence.
The present investigation will gain us a better general understanding of the mechanisms, influences and constraints active in one linguistic subsystem, wordformation, during creole genesis. Besides, it will bear implications for some recent theories and approaches to creole formation, such as the superstratist hypothesis (Chaudenson 2001; 1992), the relexification hypothesis (Lefebvre 1998), the second language acquisition (SLA) scenario, the semantic transparency approach (Seuren and Wekker 1986) and some others. Finally, it will allow some generalisations about the nature of the input in creole formation in Suriname.
12

I will show that the emergence of Early Sranan word-formation was a rather complex process where different factors, such as substratum and superstratum structures, and universals of second language acquisition played a role. The creole creators acquired superstratum complex words, transferred items from their native languages, reanalysed them in terms of the superstratum wordorder, and created new words, partially by analogy to the transferred or acquired ones. These processes were constrained by a bundle of social and linguistic factors, such the limited access to the superstratum language, large numbers of new arrivals of African-born slaves, perceptual saliency, frequency of occurrence, semantic transparency etc.
The linguistic data for the analysis will be taken from three major early sources of Sranan: Van Dyk’s (c1765) language manual of Sranan, Schumann’s (1783) Dictionary of Sranan and Focke’s (1855) Dictionary of Sranan. Several other sources of Early Sranan, both early and modern, will be consulted for additional information and additional data.
The present investigation does not adhere to any particular theoretical framework in morphology. However, the model for the analysis of Early Sranan complex words elaborated in the present paper proceeds from some basic assumptions of the lexicalist theory in morphology (Lieber 1992; Selkirk 1982), especially of Höhle’s (1982) compounding theory of affixation and also draws on Booij’s (2004) Constructional Morphology. These assumptions and approaches are introduced or discussed in the pertinent chapter.
The structure of the present study is as follows. In the next chapter, I will address some basic issues in creole linguistics crucial for the present investigation. I will also introduce some recent theoretical claims about the nature of creolisation in general and about the nature of creole derivational morphology in particular. Since the socio-historical matrix of creolisation is crucial for understanding the linguistic processes underlying creole genesis, in chapter 3 I will provide an overview of the demographic and linguistic situation in Suriname in the 18th-19th centuries and identify the major substratum languages of Early Sranan. In chapter 4 the data sources used for the present analysis, as well as methodology are introduced. Chapter 5 addresses theoretical and practical problems arising with the analysis of complex words in general and in Early Sranan in particular. A theoretical framework for the analysis of Early Sranan
13

word-formation is then developed in the same chapter. Chapter 6 discusses the problem of multifunctionality of Early Sranan words and different ways of treating this phenomenon. In chapter 7 I will analyse structural and semantic properties of Early Sranan complex words. A special focus will be on tracing the origin of different word-formation patterns and devices, by their comparison with word-formation in the substratum languages. Chapter 8 presents a study of reduplication processes in Early Sranan, with a discussion of their potential sources and evaluation of some recent approaches to the identification of substratum influence. The final chapter contains a summary of the findings and their discussion in the light of the current theories of creole genesis.

2. Creolisation and the fate of derivational morphology in creole genesis
2.1. Introduction
Two aspects of creole linguistics have enjoyed considerable attention and triggered considerable controversy: defining the term ‘creole’ and the issue of creole genesis. The present chapter is designed to provide a brief overview of these aspects and of the state of research in the sphere of creole word-formation. First, problems arising with defining the term ‘creole’ will be addressed. Second, some current positions on creole genesis will be discussed. This will allow us to turn to a survey of the major claims about the ways of development and the nature of creole word-formation. A special focus will lie on pointing out where the need for further clarification or further research in word-formation lies.
2.2. ‘Creole languages’: definitional intricacies
What should be regarded as a ‘creole’ language remains a matter of dispute even after decades of extensive research. This has multiple reasons, the major of them lies in the fact that creole languages present a heterogeneous group and differ from each other in their origin, their ways of development and their structural features. As Winford (2003: 355) remarks, the term ‘creoles’ covers a whole continuum of contact varieties that range from close L2 varieties of the superstratum languages to ‘radical’ creoles that bear only little resemblance to the lexifier.
Mainly, two broad types of criteria, based on the origin and structural features of creoles, have been advanced to identify creole languages as a separate class.
15

One set of definitions based on the origin maintain that a creole is a language that develops out of a prior pidgin1 which became the mother tongue for a group of people in a contact situation, usually for the children who grow up in a community where this pidgin is used as the primary means of communication (DeCamp 1971: 16; Hall 1966: xii; Holm 1988: 6; Sebba 1997: 136; Todd 1984: 4; ). This is probably the commonest definition of a creole, and the presence of the native speakers is often regarded as a weighty argument for naming a pidgin language a creole. The problem with this definition lies in the difficulty to draw a clear demarcation line between first and second languages (Mühlhäusler 1997: 810). Mühlhäusler (1997: 9) argues that a number of pidgins, such as Bislama, Nigerian Pidgin English, and Tok Pisin remain the second languages for most of their speakers despite having a “viable creole community”. Besides, the notion ‘pidgin’ is by no means clear-cut and the assumed pidgin stage cannot be hypothesised for every creole language (Winford 2003: 307).
Another, related definition of the ‘origin’ type is the one according to which a creole is viewed as a language that develops out of a prior pidgin which has undergone qualitative and quantitative elaboration of the means of expression so that it is no longer used as a means of communication solely, but as a language whose system allows its speakers to satisfy all their verbal needs, just as it is the case with one’s mother tongue (DeCamp 1971: 16; Hellinger 1985: 1; Romaine 1988: 38). One problem with this definition lies in the fact that on the one hand, there are languages which possess the typological features of creoles, but do not have any pidgin as a predecessor (Mühlhäusler 1997: 10).2 Another problem is that there are pidgins, such as Nigerian and Ghanaian Pidgin English, that entered the creole stage without the alleged ‘elaboration’ (Winford 2003: 306).
In general, in view of the problems arising with the pidgin-oriented definitions, it would be a more fruitful way to allow for a broader view of creoles in terms of their ‘starting point’. For instance, viewing a creole as a contact vernacular that has either a jargon, a pidgin or an interlanguage variety as its basis
1 Hereafter I will stick to the definition provided by DeCamp according to which a pidgin is a “contact vernacular, normally not the native language of any of its speakers [...]. It is characterised by a limited vocabulary, an elimination of grammatical devices such as number and gender, and a drastic reduction of redundant features” (DeCamp 1971: 15). 2 In the 1960s the term ‘creoloid‘ was coined to refer to such languages, see the discussion in Mühlhäusler (1998).
16

(Holm 1988: 9; cf. Field 2004: 133) avoids at least some of the problems mentioned above.
There also have been attempts to define creoles on the basis of their structural characteristics. The major idea behind such attempts is that creoles constitute a specific typological class since they share a number of structural features.
Thus, Bickerton (1981) describes a set of features universally encountered in creoles, such as the TMA system consisting of three preverbal particles, no specific marking for definiteness within non-specific NPs, multiple negation. In a principally similar vein, McWhorter (1998: 792-799; cf. 2000: 86) argues that creoles are distinguishable as a “synchronic class of languages”, on the basis of three features which arise as the result of creoles’ young age: little or no use of inflectional morphology, no or marginal use of tones to “encode syntactic distinctions” and to “contrast monosyllables”, and predominantly compositional (and transparent) derivational morphology.
The general problem with such definitions is that they reduce the heterogeneity and complexity of creole features to a set which, first, is not applicable to all creole languages, and second, is manifested in different creoles in a different degree.
It has also been pointed out that there are no structural features akin to all creole languages and creoles are thus qualitatively indistinguishable from other languages, such as English and Chinese (Alleyne 1971: 183; Muysken 1988: 300; Muysken and Smith 1995: 4). Although this might be true in principle, the great similarities between creole languages all over the world cannot be underestimated either.
To sum up, both types of definitions, those based on origin, as well as those based on structural features, are problematic. In fact there are no, as Winford (2003: 355) argues, “absolute criteria”, to define creoles as a distinct type.
Taken the problems discussed above, and the structural and developmental heterogeneity of creole languages, the question arises whether it is still reasonable to regard them as a separate class of languages. In this case I agree with Winford (2003: 308) who argues that despite all this heterogeneity, creoles share the characteristic of being contact languages that arose within specific demographical
17

and social settings in the European colonies. The specific circumstances of their formation make them to a particular group.
The social and linguistic heterogeneity of creole languages, as well as the specific ways of their emergence as contact languages have made another issue to a central one in creolist disputes: the issue of creole genesis. I will address it in the following section.
2.3. The issue of creole genesis
The issue of creole genesis has been one of the most challenging issues in creole studies. Almost every investigation in the area of creole linguistics touches upon the question of how creole languages acquire their properties, or in other words, what mechanisms and influences operate in creole formation.
As it was the case with the different types of creole languages, the positions on creole genesis can also be arranged on a continuum, depending on the factors and the mechanisms to which the major role in creole genesis is ascribed and on intensity with which these factors and mechanisms are believed to participate in creolisation. This continuum ranges from positions that ascribe a rather strong role to the European input through positions that place the load of creole formation on substratum languages to those which deny substratum and superstratum influence in favour of the universals of language acquisition and/or language development .
The ‘superstratist’ pole of this continuum is represented by accounts such as that of Chaudenson (1979; 1992) who view creoles as modifications of nonstandard varieties of European superstrates with little influence from the native languages of the slaves. Imperfect learning of the European language repeated with every new arrival of slaves is believed to be the major mechanism operating in this process. Within this scenario, creolisation proceeds as a gradual shift away from the superstratum though subsequent stages of imperfect language learning: whereas the first group of slaves acquired, although imperfectly, the European language of their masters, the second generation targeted the variety spoken by the first group because of the shift to sugar economy and the resulting
18

reduced access to the superstratum. The second group’s output then became the input for the third group, and so on.
Chaudenson’s scenario has been criticised on mainly two grounds, sociohistorical and linguistic. First, the ‘smooth’ way of transmission assumed by Chaudenson is problematic since in many plantation economies ‘new’ slaves considerably outnumbered the ‘old’ slaves within a very short time span and the period of superstatum presence was extremely short (Arends 1995a; Thomason 2001: 185). Second, the outstanding role of superstratum structural features in creole genesis has been challenged in numerous works which show that a substantial portion of substratum structures traceable in creole languages (Keesing 1988; Lefebvre 1998; Migge 2003a; Siegel 1999).
The central position on the ‘substratist part’ of the continuum is occupied by the relexification hypothesis developed in Lefebvre and Lumsden (1994) and Lefebvre (1998). Within this hypothesis, creole genesis is regarded as the process of adult second language acquisition with limited exposure to the superstratum. Relexification, reanalysis and dialect levelling as crucial mechanisms operating in creole genesis. Relexification is regarded as a process by which creole creators replace the lexical entries of their substratum lexicons with phonetic strings they identify in the superstratum language (Lefebvre 1998: 35). Those substratum entries for which no corresponding superstratum form can be identified by creole creators, are relabelled with a null form. They are later assigned the phonological form through the process of reanalysis by which a major category lexical item is used in the function(s) of a minor category lexical item (Lefebvre 1998: 41-45). Speakers of different substratum languages relexify their lexicons individually. Relexified features common to all lexicons will be most likely maintained in the creole, whereas idiosyncratic featured will be levelled when the speakers target the creole variety (Lefebvre 1998: 46).
Three problems with the relexification account have been pointed out. First, it is largely based on a comparison of one creole language with only one substratum language. Involving the data from several substratum languages, as it will be shown in the present study, calls for more explanations other than those suggested in Lefebvre (1998). Second, the role of the superstratum is restricted mainly to the phonological strings of morphemes. However, it has been shown that the superstratum input also played a role on different levels of creole
19

grammar (Chaudenson 1992; Migge 2003a). Finally, it has been pointed out (Singler 1996: 218) that there are internally-motivated features which arise neither due to substratum nor to superstratum influence which cannot be accounted for within the relexification hypothesis.
One of the once extensively discussed theories within the ‘universalist’ pole of the continuum is Bickerton’s ‘language bioprogramme hypothesis’ (LBH). Bickerton (1980: 4-5; 1989: 13) argues that creoles emerge as the result of firstlanguage acquisition by children who receive a limited linguistic input (a pidgin) from their parents. Children elaborate this pidgin, which is perceived by them as a deficient means of communication, to the size and expressive power of a ‘normal’, or ‘natural’ language, and this ability is attributed to the geneticallytransmitted innate language bioprogramme common to all members of the human species. The superstratum and substratum languages of creole creators do not play any considerable role in this process (Bicketon 1989: 21-22).
Modern research on the socio-cultural situation of creolisation (Singler 1986; Arends 1995a), as well as on structural features of creole languages shows that Bickerton’s theory is untenable. First, most creoles were created by adults in the process of second language acquisition. Second, this theory is unable to account for the presence and interaction between substratum and superstratum features in creole genesis.
A more general problem with claims about the universals’ influence in creole genesis is that apart from mentioning the prominence of such processes as simplification and reduction of language structures, preference for unmarked variants and a tendency to maximise semantic transparency in creole genesis, they are rather vague. There is hardly a systematic account of what type of universals and how influence the development of creole properties (cf. Muysken and Veenstra 1995: 122).
Recently there is more and more consensus about the fact that creole formation is a process too complex to be attributed to one general mechanism or one type of influence (cf. DeGraff 1999: 497; Holm 1986: 259; Mufwene 1986; Roberts 2000). In a growing number of investigations creole formation is viewed as untutored second language acquisition with limited input where substratum and superstratum are regarded as influencing and interacting factors and contactinduced strategies or universals of different types as a driving force for
20

restructuring (Brousseau 2003; Migge 2003a; Siegel 1999; Winford 2002; Uffmann 2003). This tendency reflects a general agreement that one of the major tasks for the future research in creole linguistics is, as Winford (2003: 340) puts it, to integrate the conflicting phenomena, such as substrate, superstrate, and universals in creole genesis. Therefore, the present study will focus on the possible ways of such integration and will subsequently evaluate several of the current positions on creole genesis on the basis of the word-formation data from Early Sranan.
2.4. Word-formation in creole genesis: major claims
2.4.1. The fate of derivational markers and the development of wordformation devices in creole genesis
Investigations touching upon the issue of creole genesis have been largely based on syntactic, or more seldom, phonological data. In contrast, word-formation has been a neglected area of creole linguistics, and most investigations of wordformation have pursued a descriptive rather than a theoretical line. Despite this scarcity of investigations in the area of creole word-formation, several generalisations and claims about the nature of creole derivational morphology and its fate in creole genesis have been made. In what follows I will present an overview of these claims to show the state of research in creole word-formation up-to-date. I will return to these claims when analysing Early Sranan data.
One of the central claims made about the word-formation scenario of creolisation is the loss of affixes of the input languages. Mühlhäusler (1997: 169) insists that morphological markers are “the first victims of language contact and the last features to be restored” (cf. Jones 1995: 121). McWhorter notes that
Derivational apparatus, be this affixes or particles, tends to be semantically irregular and, especially in affix form, less salient than free, stressed items; therefore, it tends to be eschewed by creole creators or incorporated in fossilised form. (McWhorter 1998: 798)
21

Although Bickerton does not clearly distinguish between derivational and inflectional morphology in his morphological scenario of creolisation, some of his remarks may be applied to derivational morphology. Thus, Bickerton notes that creoles suffer a great number of lexical and morphological losses, and any lexical item is normally acquired with a drastically reduced range of meanings and grammatical functions. The reason for the loss of morphology of the target language, as given by Bickerton (1988: 276), lies in the already simplified and reduced morphological input which is “too impoverished for the original functions of surviving morphemes to be determined from”. Bickerton (1989: 23) argues that the loss of morphemes in creolisation is structured in such a way that bound morphemes will be lost before free morphemes and grammatical items before lexical ones. Therefore, as Bickerton (1988: 278) asserts, derivational morphemes are “almost never retained” and never reconstituted.
The loss of derivational morphemes is not, however, a process that operates wholesale, i.e. on all derivational morphemes, and blindly, i.e. in every creole language. There is ample evidence that the loss of morphological formatives is not always the case. Thomason (1986) demonstrates that morphophonologically and morphosemantically opaque elements can be copied by languages in contact situations from synthetic languages. Some of creole languages, such as Haitian and Papiamentu, have borrowed and productively use derivational morphemes from their lexifiers, French and Spanish respectively (Lefebvre 1998: 303-317; Dijkhoff 1993: 141). Therefore, the question that is crucial to, but hardly asked in word-formation research, is why some creole languages do not lose at least a part of the derivational inventory of the source languages and others do. I will address this issue in chapters 7 and 9.
Another set of claims is connected with the development of new morphological formatives and word-formation patterns in creoles. It has been shown that although creole languages show specific preference towards some means of word-formation, e.g. compounding, they in fact use the same range of processes as ‘older’ languages: affixation, reduplication, compounding and multifunctionality (DeGraff 2001; Dijkhoff 1993: 32-60; Mühlhäusler 1997: 192198; Sebba 1981: 101; Wekker 1996: 36-38).
As far as affixation is concerned, different assumptions have been made as to how derivational suffixes emerge in creoles. These assumptions range from an
22

extreme position that creoles do not use affixes for creating new words (Boretzky 1983: 79) to a number of detailed scenarios of this process. Processes most commonly cited as leading to the emergence of new morphological markers are grammaticalisation (Bickerton 1989: 23; McWhorter 1998: 798), relexification (Lefebvre 1998: 333) and borrowing of superstratum complex words followed by reanalysis of such words and productive affixation (DeGraff 2001). However, these claims have hardly been tested on different creole languages and on large amounts of data, so that the real role of these processes in the development of word-formation devices remains largely unclear.
Another claim about the nature of derivational morphology in creoles is that it is semantically regular and semantically transparent (McWhorter 1998: 798). In a similar vein, Seuren and Wekker (1986: 65; 68) maintain that due to the tendency to maximise semantic transparency generally characteristic of creoles, there are few arbitrary grammatical distinctions with derivational processes in morphology and few idiosyncrasies in these languages. These claims have been critically assessed in Braun and Plag (2003) who show that it is an oversimplification to assume that creole word-formation exhibits few idiosyncrasies. The present study will address such assertions once more, and provide new insights in this connection.
It has also been argued that morphological markers develop gradually and only when the language is “developmentally ready for them” (Jones 1995: 122). However, the substantiation of such suggestions demands a diachronic investigation of creole morphology, from early stages on. Such investigations are almost non-existent.
In respect to the generalisations about the nature of creole compounding, there are two extreme poles as well. For instance, Boretzky (1983: 79) argues that creoles do not have any nominal compounds: they make use of syntactic constructions instead in which nouns are attached attributively to head nouns. In contrast, Holm (2000: 130) considers compounding as a process especially favoured by creole word-formation systems. Apart from productive compounding, two other often cited sources of creole compounds are borrowing, or calquing, of complex words from substratum languages (Jones 1995: 126; Holm 1988: 86-87; Mühlhäusler 1997: 220; Wekker 1996: 37-38), and lexicalisation of phrases to word-level units (Dijkhoff 1993: 170-189; Mühlhäusler 1995a). However, it
23

remains unclear why compounding is a preferred device, and what its proportion in respect to other devices really is.
Reduplication is often regarded as a word-formation process typical of creoles and influenced by the substratum (Hall 1966: 65; Holm 1988: 88-89; Wekker 1996: 37). Reduplication has been devoted a comparatively greater attention among all the other creole word-formation processes. Thus, the role of different factors, such as markedness and substratum influence in the development of creole reduplication has received a detailed analysis in several recent works (Kouwenberg 2003; Kouwenberg and LaCharité 2004) some of which advance a rigid metric of assessing the probability of substratum and universals’ influence (Kouwenberg and LaCharité 2004). This metric will be used and evaluated in the present study.
Multifunctionality is another commonly cited wide-spread feature of creole languages (Holm 1988; Mühlhäusler 1997: 137). However, although many researchers mention the fact that multifunctionality is extensively used by pidgins and creoles, there is no account of why and to what extent it is attested in creoles and what role different factors, especially the substratum and the universals play in its emergence. It is also unclear what position multifunctionality really occupies within creole word-formation. Besides, there are very few investigations that deal with the theoretical conceptualisation of the phenomenon of word-class change without overt marking in creoles: the question to be clarified is whether it should be best conceptualised as a morphological or a syntactic process.
The sweeping examination of the major claims about the nature and development of creole word-formation shows an extreme need for investigations that focus not only on separate aspects of word-formation, but on the development of word-formation systems as a whole from the early stages on. Our knowledge about the emergence of creole word-formation is based on few investigations and several scattered assertions about different word-formation processes. A critical assessment of these claims based on large amounts of empirical data is largely missing. The situation is similar with the claims about the role of substratum, superstratum and universals in the emergence of creole word-formation. This will be the topic of the next section.
24

2.4.2. The role of substratum, universals and language-internal mechanisms in the development of creole word-formation
It has been shown above that the question about the role of the substratum and superstratum languages, universals and different mechanisms in creole genesis has been a central one to many investigations. However, the issue of how and to what extent substratum and superstratum languages, universals of first and second language acquisition and internal language change influence the development of word-formation devices has been seldom addressed systematically in creole linguistics. The present subchapter is designed to show what has been done in this respect so far and where the problems, as well as a need for further study lie.
As far as the substratum and superstratum influence on the emergence of creole word-formation devices is concerned, several conflicting assertions have been made in this respect.
On the one hand, it has been argued that derivational morphology is relatively independent of substratum or superstratum influences (Mühlhäusler 1995a: 119). The following quotation by Mühlhäusler (1997: 198) is interesting in this respect: “In fact, I have to see hard evidence to convince me that substratum languages have played an important role in the development of word-formation in any Creole.”
On the other hand, it has been observed that the substratum and superstratum languages play a role in the moulding of creole word-formation devices. However, claims about substratum or superstratum influence in creoles are often reduced to mere enumeration of processes that presumably develop due to substratum influence. Thus, reduplication, tonal phenomena, ideophones, some periphrastic and idiomatic expressions, some word combinations, and metaphors are usually attributed to substratum influence (Dijkhoff 1993: 44). However, it is not clear how exactly, and to what extent these processes are influenced by the substratum.
More detailed accounts of the mechanisms and influences in the emergence of creole word-formation are rather few and will be briefly presented below.
Thus, Stolz (1989: 52-53) asserts that morphosyntactic, semantic and/or phonetic properties of morphemes in a creole language can take their roots in the
25

substratum languages, although there is no absolute correspondence between the form and function of creole forms and substrate forms. According to Stolz (1989: 51-52), suffixes are introduced into a creole if the substrate also has such a suffix to mark a certain category. Partial phonetic, semantic and syntactic correspondences between sub- and superstrate forms play a role in the choice of elements creole morphology operates with.
Brousseau et al. (1989: 31) maintain that affixes of the language Y can enter the lexicon of a language X only indirectly since bound morphemes cannot be borrowed as such because they are not isolated entities. Therefore the mechanism by which creoles acquire derivational morphology is borrowing of fully inflected and derived words and subsequent reanalysis of parts of these words as affixes. According to Brousseau et al. (1989: 31-32) in the case of Haitian Creole, the substratum, i.e. Fongbe words were relexified by equivalent French words which resulted in Haitian lexicon. Later these phonological words were mapped onto word structures corresponding to those from the substratum languages. In this way the morphology of the lexical items of the Haitian lexicon came to parallel that of its substratum.
In a similar vein, Lefebvre (1998: 303-348) attributes a significant role to the substratum in the emergence of creole word-formation. She argues that the substratum languages contribute the structural and semantic properties of derivational affixes, the inventory of the derivational affixes and structural and semantic principles of concatenation of simplexes into compounds. Superstratum contributes the phonetic matrices and the order of elements in complex words since the creole creators target the superstratum and correspondingly acquire its order (Lefebvre 1998: 348). Lefebvre considers relexification as the major mechanism by which substratum morphology influences creole morphology: the lexical entries of substratum derivational affixes are copied and relabelled on the basis of the superstratum phonetic matrices.
Although the idea of relexification has been criticised in general (Mühlhäusler 1980: 34-35; 1997: 107-108; Myers-Scotton 1997) and Lefebvre’s relexification account of Haitian derivational morphology in particular (DeGraff 2001), there is hardly an investigation that would test the major claims of Lefebvre’s relexification hypothesis in a systematic way on large amounts of data.
26

Another remark due here is that although both Lefebvre’s (1998) and Brousseau’s et al. (1989) accounts consider principally the same mechanism, relexification, responsible for the substratum influence, there is a difference between the two accounts with respect to how this mechanism operates. Lefebvre (1998) argues that individual affixes can be relexified. Brousseau et al. (1989) maintain that the process of relexification operates on whole words, including those with complex morphological structure, with the subsequent reanalysis of certain elements as affixes. This difference will be shown to be crucial in explaining how substratum languages influence creole-word-formation.
The role of universals of any kind in the development of word formation system is a poorly researched issue. Bickerton (1989: 21-29), for instance, argues that the process of reconstitution of morphemes that immediately follows the process of loss, is governed by universal principles. Thus, what must be reconstituted and in what order is determined by the bioprogramme. However, Bickerton (1988: 278) does not specify at all how the bioprogramme influences the development of creole derivational morphology since he assumes that derivational morphemes are lost and never reconstituted. In general, remarks about universals’ influence are mainly limited to pointing out that factors such as markedness, simplicity and semantic transparency play a role in how morphological markers develop in pidgins and creoles (Jones 1995: 122; Mühlhäusler 1995a: 118; Seuren and Wekker 1986). However, such remarks mostly lack substantiated and detailed explanations of what this role exactly is or how, if at all, ‘universal factors’ interact with other factors. Besides, the very issue of what should be regarded under the notion ‘universals’ is rather vague: for instance, it is unclear which word-formation processes should be regarded as marked: those that are rare cross-linguistically or those that exhibit some other properties, such as ease of perception.
It has also been argued that language-internal mechanisms are the driving force for the development of pidgin and creole word-formation (Jones 1995; Mühlhäusler 1980; 1995a; 1997). The central mechanism referred to by Mühlhäusler (1995a: 119) is the reanalysis of syntactic structures to word-level units. Thus, in Tok Pisin, circumlocutions of the type he look daylight a long time meaning ‘to lie awake’, preferred during the initial stages of the pidgin-creole continuum gave way to lexicalised phrases, such as man bilong slip ‘sleepy, lazy
27

person’, which in their turn, were gradually substituted by word-level units, such as paitman (fight-man) ‘fighter/warrior’ during the later expansion and the creolisation stages (Mühlhäusler 1995a: 111; 1997: 177; 181). The problem with such accounts is that many creole languages do not go through such a clear-cut developmental continuum. Besides, the reanalysis mechanism as it is referred to by Mühlhäusler is unable to account for many other phenomena, such as substratum or superstratum-similar patterns in creole word-formation.
We can conclude that little is known about the mechanisms and influencing factors involved in the genesis of creole word-formation. It became clear above that substratum languages play a significant role in the emergence of creole word-formation. However, the exact mechanisms and constraints on substratum influence have enjoyed little study. An especially speculative issue is the role of universals, such as markedness, in this process. Therefore, in the present study a special focus will lie on investigating mechanisms and substratum/superstratum/universals’ traces in the emergence of Early Sranan word-formation.
2.5. Conclusion
In the present chapter, some basic issues of creole studies have been discussed. It has been shown that although creole languages display a considerable amount of heterogeneity in terms of their origin and their structural features, which makes a clear-cut definition problematic, they can be regarded as a particular class of languages, as outcomes of language contact that arose within specific demographical and social settings in the European colonies. Because of the specific nature of the emergence of creole languages, the issue of creole genesis has been devoted considerable attention in creole linguistics. Although there is no general consensus on what the ultimate scenario of creolisation might be, different theories and positions on this matter allow the insight that creolisation is a rather complex process, in which different mechanisms, such as relexification, reanalysis, dialect levelling, simplification, reduction, etc. and different types of
28

influence, such as substratum, superstratum, markedness, semantic transparency, etc. play a role.
It has also been demonstrated that creole word-formation is a relatively little investigated area of study. The rough scenario of the development of wordformation that can be reconstructed on the basis of the studies up to date is as follows. A great number of derivational morphemes of the input languages are lost in creolisation. New means of word-formation develop in creoles either under the influence of substratum languages and/or universals or as triggered by language internal mechanisms. Relexification, re-analysis, borrowing, grammaticalisation, reduction, calquing are possible mechanisms operating in the emergence of wordformation systems of creoles.
However, as it has been stressed above, despite a number of investigations of creole word-formation that allow a construction of this rough scenario, a whole range of issues remain underinvestigated and unclear. Systematic accounts of the ways and mechanisms by which different factors and different processes interact in the development of creole word-formation systems, as well as critical assessment and validity of some of the theoretical work, e.g. the relexification hypothesis, for the word-formation system of creole languages are virtually nonexistent. Therefore, many of the claims on the emergence and nature of creole word-formation mentioned above will be empirically tested in the present study.

3. The socio-historical background of Early Sranan
3.1. Introduction
Since the socio-historical circumstances have often been claimed to be crucial in the process of creole formation, the present chapter serves the purpose to describe the historical, social and ethno-linguistic situation in Suriname in the 17th and early 19th century: the time of Early Sranan. Throughout the present work, the term ‘Early Sranan’ will be used to refer to the ancestor of Modern Sranan, or Sranan Tongo, a creole language that emerged in Suriname by 1720 and was mainly used on the plantations along the coastal region and the capital Paramaribo till the middle of 19th century1. The major focus of the present chapter will lie on the type of varieties that have emerged during the early stages of Suriname’s existence and might have been the major input for the emerging creole languages. Another issue of importance will be consideration of historical information that allows the identification of the major substratum languages of Suriname. The information presented in the present chapter is based on Arends (1995a; 1999; 2002a), Migge (1998; 2003a), Postma (1990) and Rens (1953).
1 The time span for ‘Early Sranan’ assumed in the present study comprises the period between the end of the 17th–the middle of the 19th century. This assumption is based on purely practical considerations: since Focke (1855) is one of the valuable early sources of Sranan, I took the date of its publication as a temporal limit for ‘Early Sranan’.
30

3.2. The historical and socio-economic situation in Suriname in the 17th-19th centuries
The colony of Suriname was founded in 1651 by the English expedition sent by Lord Willoughby, the Governor of Barbados, with the purpose of finding new land for sugar plantations. Later the first settlers were joined by new English planters from Barbados, St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat (Rens 1953: 14). The English presumably brought a small number of slaves already from Barbados, whose exact numbers are, however, unknown (Arends 1995a: 240).
In the 1960s approximately 200 Sephardic Jews came to Suriname from northeast Brazil, Essequibo (Guyana) and Europe (Livorno and Amsterdam) (Arends 2002a: 118). The Jews started the plantation business along the upper Suriname and Commewijne Rivers. On the basis of socio-historical data, Arends (2002a: 118) assumes that the Jews could hardly bring any slaves with them since most of them came from Europe. Arends concludes that the proportion of Portuguese lexical items in the Surinamese creoles should have its origin in the variety of Portuguese spoken by the Sephardic Jews rather from a Portuguese creole existing in Brazil.
Socio-economically, Suriname was a small-scale agricultural society during the ‘English’ period (approximately 1652-1670), with small farms as the major socio-economic units. The farms were worked by the owner and his family or by planter and indentured labourers (e.g. convicts) from Europe, as well as by African and Amerindian slaves. The nature of small-farm economy and also the fact that indentured labourers must have worked together with the slaves allow a suggestion that there were frequent interactions between European indentured labourers and African slaves which were crucial in terms of the emergence and transmission of different contact varieties (Arends 2002a: 117; Migge 2003a: 29).
In 1667 Suriname was taken by the Dutch, and assigned to the Dutch under the treaty of Breda in 1668, as the result of the second Anglo-Dutch war. The English planters began to leave Suriname. Between 1668 and 1680 most of approximately 617 English planters and 1,693 slaves left Suriname. Only 39 Englishmen and some slaves are supposed to remain in Suriname of the Dutch rule (Arends 1995a: 237). The English were substituted by mainly Dutch, German
31

and Jewish planters. However, as Arends (2002a: 120) argues, some of the English planters returned to Suriname after some time and new English planters came from other Caribbean colonies after 1680. Linguistically, this has the consequence that English continued to be spoken at least by some proportion of the Surinamese European population after the English exodus.
In terms of the socio-economic development, the initial ‘post-English’ period, approximately between 1670 and 1684, was marked by the change from the small farming units to larger farms (Migge 1998: 227). This can be partially explained by the fact that the exodus of the English planters who were only allowed to take slaves they acquired till 1667 with them promoted an increase in the number of slaves available for purchase for the remaining planters.
The ‘farming unit’ was replaced by the half-industrial sugar plantation economy between 1680 and 1695. Plantation economy caused a different social structuring of the population which now consisted of three major groups. The owner, the resident manager, the White overseer, the basyia (the leader of the slave group), the elite slaves and the field workers were the main actors of the social scene on plantations (Migge 1998: 227-229). The European plantation owner and his European assistants occupied the highest position in the social hierarchy, old slaves the intermediate one and new slaves were placed on the lowest level. The different social structure also caused a difference in the nature of interaction between the groups which took place mainly among the members of the same social group. The contacts between the Europeans and the African field labourers were very limited. Plantation economy also caused dramatic demographic developments: the harsh conditions of sugar production resulted in high death rates of African slaves and low birth rates which linguistically lead to a marginal role of children in the emergence of the contact varieties in Suriname.
During the following approximately one hundred years, Suriname continued its path as a plantation economy until the financial crisis in the 1770s triggered an economic decline in terms of sugar production. This, in its turn, slowly lead to the end of the slave importation in 1830. However, it took several decades until slavery was officially abolished in 1863. In 1799 Suriname was seized by the British as the result of the Napoleon’s war and many British planters again settled in Suriname. In 1816 Suriname came back under the Dutch rule and remained a Dutch colony till 1975 when it gained full independence.

3.3. Demographic development of Suriname
Three types of demographic developments were crucial for the colony of Suriname at the end of the 17th – the beginning of the 18th century: the increase in the number of African slaves, the growing proportion of new-to-old slaves and the low numbers of locally born children.
Whereas the very initial years of Suriname’s existence were characterised by the equal number of Africans and Europeans, the black-to-white ratio was steady growing: during the first two decades, it increased up to 3:1 (Arends 1995a: 260; Migge 2003a: 28). The following years witnessed a drastic decrease in the Europeans-to-Africans ratio due to the emergence of sugar plantation economy: in the second half of the 1680-1690 decade, the African population “had more than quintupled” because of constant new arrivals of slaves (Arends 2002a: 121) reaching its culminating point of 1:25 in 1780. The linguistic consequence of this rapid growth was slaves’ limited access to the varieties spoken by the Europeans.
A similar, although not so dramatic development is traceable for the oldto-new slaves ratio. In the second decade (1660-1669) there were approximately 2,000 old slaves and 2,800 new slaves in Suriname (Arends 1995a: 264). The number of new slaves was constantly increasing because of the massive importations from Africa during the following two decades (1670-1690): the oldto-new slaves ratio changed drastically from 1:1.8 in 1679 to 1:6.6 by 1689 (Migge 2003a: 31, cf. Arends 1995a: 264). However, this ratio started to increase constantly since the 1700s on. In general, the fact that the number of new arrivals far exceeded the number of the old slaves already at the early stages of the colony’s history implies that the new slaves might have had little access to the language of the old slaves in the period between approximately 1670 and 1700 (Arends 1995a: 263).
Other two important demographic characteristics in the Suriname of the 17th – 18th centuries were high mortality rates of the blacks on plantations (at the end of the 18th century 40,7 out of 1000 blacks died according to Arends (1995a: 263)) and the low nativisation rate (the proportion of locally born blacks to the overall black population). The proportion of both locally-born and African-born
33

children in Suriname in 1720 was approximately 20 percent (Migge 1998: 222, based on Postma 1990: 185). Arends (1995a: 263) argues that nativisation rate remained low through the whole slavery period because of an extremely high death rate and an extremely low birth rate among the blacks. Since even in 1750, one hundred years after the establishment of the colony, three of every four blacks were African-born, Sranan is assumed by Arends (2002a: 123) to have been the second rather than the first language for the overwhelming proportion of the Surinamese population.
In conclusion, the specific demographic make-up of the Surinamese population had a crucial impact on the ways of development and the nature of linguistic outcomes in the contact situation. First, there were limited interactions between Europeans and Africans, as well as between old and new slaves in the formative years of Sranan which diminished the role of both Europeans and old slaves as transmitters of the contact variety during the crucial years. This, according to Arends (2002a: 116-117) had the consequence that the restructuring of English in Suriname started at an early point and was supposedly more drastic than in other colonies. Second, the role of children in this process was marginal which makes the emergence of Early Sranan the process of L2 rather than L1 acquisition.
3.4. Ethnolinguistic make-up of the Surinamese population
3.4.1. The European population
Suriname was a multiethnic and multilingual society not only in terms of African, but also in terms of European population from the very beginning on. This ethnic and linguistic heterogeneity had serious consequences for the development of Early Sranan.
Although in the first decade (1651-1660) the Surinamese European population consisted primarily of the English planters who spoke different regional dialects of English, the situation changed already in the 1660s with the
34

arrival of the Jews who were speakers of Portuguese, Spanish and some varieties of Judeo-Spanish (Migge 1998: 223).
After the English exodus in 1667, the situation became even more heterogeneous. Although Suriname was under the Dutch rule, the Dutch were not the numerical majority among the European population in Suriname. The white population consisted mainly of people of English, Dutch, French, German origin and Portuguese Jews. The latter constituted one third of the European population in Suriname from the 1670s till the second half of the 18th century (Arends 2002a: 121).
Linguistically, the heterogeneity of the European population had at least two consequences. First, as Arends (1995a: 262) suggests it may have promoted the use of Sranan as lingua franca. Second, because of the numeric significance of Sephardic Jews who were (mainly) speakers of Portuguese, Portuguese-based contact variety or varieties might have played a not unimportant role in the Surinamese linguistic scene.
3.4.2. The African population and its languages
African population of Suriname was also of diverse origin in both ethnic and linguistic terms. On the basis of extensive socio-historical research about slave trade conducted by the Dutch who were the main suppliers of slaves at that time (Arends 1995a; Postma 1990; Price 1976), it can be assumed that the slaves working on the Surinamese plantations came from three major areas: the Slave coast, the Loango region and the Gold coast. The Slave Coast refers to today’s Togo and Benin, Loango region to the area “north of the Zaire river, i.e. Cabinda”, the coastal regions of Congo and Zaire, and southern Gabon, and the Gold Coast to the central and eastern area of the present day Ghana up to Accra (Arends 1995a: 245). Besides, after 1730 some slaves also came from Windward Coast which is the name for the Grain Coast and Ivory Coast areas in the times of Dutch slave trade, and refers to today’s Liberia and the Ivory Coast.
Each of the areas can be associated with particular linguistic group(s) since their distribution hardly changed from the period of slave trade (cf. Arends 1995a: 247).
35

Thus, the Slave Coast was inhabited by the speakers of the Gbe cluster of the Kwa group which belongs to the Niger-Congo language family2. The Gbe cluster consists of the five branches of languages: the Ajagbe, Fongbe, Gengbe, Vhegbe (Ewe) and the Phla-Phera (Migge 1998: 225). Of the five it is Fon and Ewe that were of crucial importance in the linguistic scene in Suriname because many slaves coming from the Slave Coast are assumed to be the speakers of these two languages on the basis of historical evidence (Arends 1995a: 248-249).
In the Loango region, according to Postma (1990: 101), the Dutch recruited mainly Kikongo-speaking slaves. Kikongo belongs to the Kongo cluster of the Central Bantu group of the Niger-Congo language family. It is assumed that after 1740 some speakers of Kimbundu (Bantu) were imported from the noncoastal parts of Loango, but their influence was probably not significant because of the late arrival (Arends 1995a: 250; cf. Mufwene 2001: 44).
The slaves from the Gold Coast, according to Arends (1995a: 250), were speakers of Akuapem (Twi) and Abron of the Akan subgroup and of Ga of the Ga-Adangme subgroup of the Kwa group, as well as Anyi-Baule speakers. Arends is doubtful about Asante and Fante as possible substrate languages for Surinamese creoles because of the fact that the Asante and Fante kingdoms situated in the area of the Gold Coast were rather powerful in the 18th century, and thus very unlikely to become the object of slave raids (Arends 1995a: 249).
The slaves from Windward Coast were mainly the speakers of the coastal languages, such as Kru (e.g. Bassa, Grebo), southern Mande (e.g. Kpelle, Loma) and southern Atlantic (Gola), as well as speakers of western Kwa languages (e.g. Baule) (Arends 1995a: 250). Arends notes that the influence from the Windward Coast may have been rather small because of the late arrival of their speakers on the linguistic scene in Suriname.
The numerical distribution of slaves from one of the four areas just mentioned, and hence their impact on the emergence of the creole languages were different at different periods in the history of Suriname.
Although the information about the ethnolinguistic origin of the African slaves during the ‘English period’, prior to 1675 is rather scarce, Arends (1995a:
2 Since there is a great discrepancy between the classifications of African languages provided by different linguists (Gregersen 1977; Heine, Schadenberg and Wolff 1981; Lyovin 1997), I will adapt here the classification provided in Arends 1995a and Migge 1998.
36

340-341) admits that it is possible to make a prediction on the basis of the figures available for the Dutch slave trade in general that most of Africans came from the Slave Coast and Loango areas, i.e. were speakers of Gbe and Kikongo.
For the ‘post-English’ era, more reliable information is available on the origin of the slaves working on Surinamese plantations. Table 1, adapted from Arends (1995a: 243, Table 2) shows the areas of recruitment and the number of slaves coming from these areas.

As it can be inferred from Table 1, Gbe-speaking slaves from the Slave Coast and Kikongo-speaking slaves from the Loango region dominated the scene in the two decades between 1680 and 1700 which were crucial in terms of emergence of creole languages in Suriname. The two groups were of roughly equal numbers with a slight numerical preponderance of Kikongo-speaking slaves during 16801689. The number of slaves speaking other languages, e.g. Twi and Ga were rather small.
The following two decades, between 1700 and 1720 witnessed a considerable decrease in the number of slaves coming from the Loango region, i.e.

37

Kikongo-speaking. The Gbe speakers made up 70% of new arrivals. The speakers of Twi and Ga were rather few.
The post-1720 period is characterised by a steady decline of the Kikongospeaking, and even more of the Gbe speaking slaves. The Windward Coast and the Gold Coast became the major recruitment areas for new slaves whose main languages were Twi, Abron, Ga, Anyi and Baule. However, these languages, especially those spoken by the newcomers from the Windward Coast, which became numeral only after 1740, do not effect the matter of identification of the major substrate languages because of their late arrival (Arends 1995a: 244).
In conclusion, an important fact about the substrate languages in Suriname, mentioned by Arends (1995a: 248), is that the areas from which Surinamese slaves were recruited are linguistically much less diverse than West Africa as a whole, and the homogeneity of the substrate plays an important role in determining the extent of the substratum influence in creolisation. Out of quite a number of African languages, according to Arends (1995a: 253), it is only Gbe and Kikongo that can be regarded as “primary candidates for substrate influence in the Suriname creoles” on the basis of reliable demographic, ethnolinguistic and historical evidence. Other African languages involved into the formation of Surinamese creoles at different times and with different intensity, such as Twi, Abron, Ga, Anyi and Baule, can have played, as Arends (1995a: 250) asserts, only a secondary role. From the two major substrates of the Surinamese creoles, there are several indications for the fact that the Gbe varieties played a more important role in Suriname than Kikongo. First, as Migge (2003a: 55) argues, whereas between 1680-1695 the numbers of Gbe-speaking and Kikongo-speaking slaves were the same, during the period between 1695 and 1720, 70 percent of slaves came from the Gbe-speaking areas so that the overall number of the Gbe-speaking slaves in this period can be estimated as 80 percent, including the slaves from the previous setting. Second, as Migge (2003a) shows, quite a number of morphosyntactic features of Surinamese Creoles have their roots in the Gbe varieties. Finally, a considerable number of words in Surinamese creoles (approximately 150) are of Gbe origin (Smith to appear, quoted from Kouwenberg and LaCharité 2004: 321).
Taken the ethnolinguistic diversity of both European and African population that has been demonstrated above, the question that arises now is what
38

the primary means of communication between different ethnic groups in the multilingual setting of Suriname was. This question will be addressed in the next section.
3.5. The emergence of the creole languages of Suriname
It is generally assumed that by 1720, a common ancestor of the modern Surinamese creoles emerged on the plantations in Suriname. However, the question when and how it emerged is still a matter of dispute.
In respect to the issue of when this common ancestor emerged, two different positions can be distinguished.
On the one hand, it is assumed that a creole language must have come into existence in Suriname during the English period, approximately by 1680s (Voorhoeve and Lichtveld 1975: 276; cf. Smith 2002: 135). For instance, Smith (2002: 135) argues that Sranan must have arisen as a fully-fledged creole language in the first thirty years of the existence of the colony, i.e. between 1651 and 1680. His argumentation is based on the fact that Sranan must have been creolised before Saramaccan came into existence in 1680 since the two languages bear a rather close resemblance to each other. The old slaves are believed to have transmitted the contact language to the new slaves between 1668 and 1680, when most English planters and their slaves left Suriname (Voorhoeve and Lichtveld 1975). This, however, can hardly be supported socio-historically, since the new slaves outnumbered the old ones already by 1670, and this tendency continued in the next decades, making the situation for transmission highly unfavourable (Arends 1995a: 238).
On the other hand, it has been argued that not a creole language, but some kind of pidgin English or a second language variety of English existed in Suriname during the first decades of the 17th century out of which the creole languages of Suriname emerged (Arends 1995a: 237; Migge 1998: 230; Sebba 1997: 147).
39

In respect to the ways of emergence and the nature of the contact varieties used for inter-ethnic communication in Suriname between 1650 and 1720, three positions will be mentioned here.
Migge (2003a: 27-35) suggests that the emergence of contact varieties in Suriname at the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th century took place within three contact settings: the first setting lasted from 1652 to 1679, the second from 1680 till 1695, and the third from 1695 till 1720. Each setting was characterised by the differences in the nature of the contact varieties.
As Migge (2003a: 29) assumes, the major means of communication between the participants during the first contact setting (1652-1679) were L2 and pidgin varieties of English. She suggests that there might have been a continuum of such varieties: from reduced early L2 varieties to “close approximations to available L1 models”, and that the majority of speakers might have used L2 varieties characteristic of intermediate stages of language acquisition. These varieties, as Migge assumes, most likely did not become the starting basis for the formation of modern Surinamese creoles. One of the reasons for this might lie in the fact that because of the close contact between Europeans and Africans, the latter were able to learn these varieties of English.
The second contact setting (1680-1695), with its change to the plantation economy and the rapid and constant decrease of the whites-to-blacks ratio, favoured, as Migge (2003a: 32) assumes, the emergence of the early plantation creole which became the common ancestor for the modern creoles of Suriname. New slaves played the crucial role in this process. They had a limited access to the speakers of the earlier varieties and therefore could acquire only a reduced set of structures and elements from L2 varieties of English that were the means of communication during the first contact setting. As Migge (2003a: 32) suggests, they also retained their L1 structures and used general contact-induced strategies of communication. The creole varieties that emerged during the second contact setting were the major means of inter-ethnic communication. As Migge (2003a: 32) argues, the new slaves targeted the creole varieties and also used L1s strategies in their acquisition process.
During the subsequent period, between 1695 and 1720, the creole varieties that emerged during the second contact setting were the major means of interethnic communication since the newly arriving slaves had a close contact to
40

the speakers of these varieties. Migge (2003a: 35) asserts that the new slaves targeted the existing creole varieties and also used L1s strategies in their acquisition process.
A slightly different position is taken in Arends (2002a: 124-125). He suggests that since one of the earliest sources of Sranan, Herlein (1718), contains both features typical of creoles such as bi-morphemic question words, but also some pidgin-like features such as the absence of the copula and of articles, Sranan was probably not a stable creole language by the beginning of the 18th century. This, together with the socio-historical evidence, leads Arends to the conclusion that the contact variety spoken by the slaves in the last quarter of the 17th century was still “recognisable as English”. Arends also argues that the linguistic make-up of the later sources, such as Van Dyk (c1765) and Schumann (1783), is indicative of the emergence of an “autonomous creole language” by the middle of the 18th century.
Another account of the emergence of the creole languages of Suriname is advanced by Smith (1987). He argues, on the basis of a detailed study of phonology of the Surinamese creoles that the language variety used in Suriname during the first decades of the 17th century (which he refers to as ‘Proto-Sranan’) was a kind of “more or less expanded pidgin”. This pidgin is supposed to have developed on the basis of both, an English-based pidgin brought by the English and their slaves from Barbados, St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat and the “colonial” English of the planters which was spoken in Suriname (Smith 1987: 9; 151). It is from this variety that Surinamese creole languages descended. Smith (1987: 9; 151) additionally argues that the West African Pidgin English (WAPE) with an English-based vocabulary spoken in the 17th century in the coastal areas of West Africa may have become an indirect foundation for the pidgin English spoken in Barbados and other islands in the Atlantic from which the English colonisers came to Suriname.3
In general, the way of emergence and the nature of the early contact varieties used in Suriname is difficult to establish with a more or less high degree of precision since more investigations, especially of the early data, are necessary.
3 A similar account, which is not, however, limited to the Surinamese creoles, but comprises all Atlantic creoles is provided by Hancock (1986) who assumes a West African Creole English to be the ancestor of these creoles.
41

What becomes clear, however, is that by 1720, some kind of creole language was used as a common means of communication in Suriname. This language became the common ancestor for the several creole varieties that descended from it between 1680 and 1720, most of which as the result of the slaves’ escapes from the plantations: Sranan, Saramaccan, Matawai, Ndjuka, Boni (Aluku), Kwinti and Paramaccan.
Sranan was historically the language of the slaves living in the plantation zone of the coast and the lower reaches of the major river. Today Sranan is around Paramaribo, the capital of Suriname and along the coast. The speakers of all the other varieties live in the interior of the country. The emergence of the so-called ‘Djutongo’, the language variety used on the Jewish plantations along the midSurinam River became the starting point for Saramaccan, the creole language of one of the Maroon tribes formed at about 1690 in Suriname4. Smith (1987) argues that Djutongo is a kind of Proto-Sranan relexified with the words from a Portuguese creole spoken by the slaves of the Portuguese Jews who came to Suriname in the 1660s.5 In the 1730s the Matawai emerged as a separate tribe with a language which may be regarded as a dialect of Saramaccan (Bruyn 1995a: 12; Smith 1987: 4). Approximately after 1715 the creole languages of the Eastern Bush Negroes: Ndjuka (Aukaans), Boni (Aluku), Paramaccan and Kwinti emerged as “offshoots of Sranan” (Smith 1987: 152). According to Smith (1987: 4), the differences between Saramaccan and Matawai, as well as the differences between Ndjuka, Paramaccan and Boni are of dialectal nature.
4 The exact date is, however, unknown. For instance, Migge (2003a: 57) dates the split of Saramaccans at about 1680. Arends (2002a: 122) shows that the escapes from plantations took place already prior to 1690. Therefore, roughly, the last two decades of the 17th century can be regarded as the time-span for the split of Saramaccan. 5 Arends (1999) challenges the hypothesis advanced by Smith (1987) about the origin of Saramaccan as a result of relexification of Proto-Sranan by the Brazilian Portuguese Creole. Arends shows that very few if any Jews who came to Suriname in the 1660s came from Brazil. Since Saramaccan is not relevant for the present study, I will not discuss this issue here.
42

3.6. Conclusion
The discussion above shows how important socio-historical data are for the understanding and correct description of creolisation process, especially for the identification of the substratum languages of the Surinamese creoles.
It became clear that the large-scale sugar production triggered the specific social and demographic make-up of the colony of Suriname. Socially, Surinamese plantation society was hierarchically structured, with plantation owners and managers occupying the highest level of this hierarchy, and new slaves the lowest which triggered limited interaction between the two groups. Demographically, it was characterised by high Africans-to-Europeans ratios, low old-to-new slaves ratios, high mortality rates and low birth rates. The major linguistic consequences of these processes were a limited access to the superstratum varieties, high degree of reduction and restructuring of the input varieties, heavy influence of the slaves’ native languages, and the fact that the contact variety used as the means of the inter-ethnic communication in Suriname was a second language for the majority of the slave population.
It also became clear that despite extensive socio-historical research, several issues remain unclear or speculative. First, although there is an indication of the fact that the reduced L2 varieties of English presented the major input into creole creation, the exact nature of this input remains unclear. Second, establishing a more or less certain moment of time at which a ‘pre-creole’ variety, be it a pidgin, an L2 variety of English, or other become a creole is also a problematic matter.
The information provided in the present chapter will be extensively used in the subsequent chapters of the present work to verify or abandon certain analyses and arguments.

4. The data and methodology of the present study
4.1. Introduction
Two of the major purposes of the present investigation are to describe the development of Early Sranan word-formation during the initial 200 years and to compare it to the word-formation in the substratum and superstratum languages. This, on the one hand, raises the question of what reliable data are available for this kind of research. On the other hand, it necessitates the clarification of how such a ‘historical’ comparison can be carried out. The present chapter therefore serves a purely practical purpose of introducing the main sources of data and the methodology of the present study. Special attention is devoted to the problems encountered during the investigation.
4.2. Sources of Early Sranan
Early Sranan is one of the not many creole languages that boasts a considerable number of reliable early sources. The availability of such sources, as Arends (2002b: 56) notes, allows to “develop a historically realistic theory of creole formation”. The present study describes the word-formation devices and processes of Early Sranan on the basis of the analysis of complex words collected from the early sources in order to document what happens to word-formation at the very initial stages of creole formation.
The data on Early Sranan used in the present study come from three early sources of this language: Van Dyk’s Nieuwe en nooit bevoorens geziene onderwyzinge in het Bastert Engels, of Neeger Engels, zoo als het zelve in de Holladsze Colonien gebruikt word, etc (‘New and unprecedented instruction in Bastard English, or Negro English, as it is used in the Dutch colonies’) of c1765 (published in Arends and Perl 1995), Christian Ludwig Schumann’s Neger-
44

Englisches Wörterbuch of 1783, Editio Tertia (published in Kramp 1983) and Focke’s Neger-Engelsch Woordenboek (Negro-English Dictionary) of 1855.
Van Dyk (c1765; 1221 types, 11405 tokens) is the first manual on Sranan of 112 pages which includes a small vocabulary, twelve dialogues and a story about daily life on a plantation. It was written for those who did business in Surinam with the purpose of providing an opportunity to learn Sranan. The exact date of this manual is highly disputable, although it is assumed that it must have been written between 1740 and 1770. It has been suggested on the basis of sociohistorical and linguistic data that the manual must have been written in the 1760, and the common reference for this source is c1765 (Arends 1995c; Bruyn 1995b) which will be adapted in the present study. It is also highly disputable which variety of Sranan is reflected in Van Dyk’s manual. Schuchardt (1914: XXIII) argues that Van Dyk’s text reflects the language spoken on plantations. Smith (1987: 203) and Arends (1995b: 40) argue that Van Dyk represents an earlier and only partially creolised variety of Sranan. Bruyn (1995b: 156) suggests, on the basis of linguistic analysis, that it is closer to vernacular speech than other 18th century sources and reflects spontaneous spoken language. The particular value of Van Dyk (c1765) for the present work lies in the fact that it contains a relatively large body of text which is not the case with the other two sources, Schumann (1783) and Focke (1855). This allows a more reliable identification of the lexical categories of elements in complex words.
Schumann’s Dictionary (1783; 2391 types; 17731 tokens) is one of the best and the largest sources of Early Sranan. It is assumed that Schumann worked with the informants who were native speakers of Sranan and that he himself might have been very proficient in the creole since he provides accurate and exhaustive information, both linguistic and cultural, in his dictionary (Arends 1989: 19; Bruyn 1995b: 154-155; Plag 1993: 57-58). Schumann’s Dictionary is valuable since it makes reference to two major varieties of Sranan, Bakratongo (‘White man’s tongue’) and Ningretongo (‘Negro language’) and provides the author’s and the informants’ numerous comments on the differences between the two varieties. It is generally agreed that Schumann (1783) is a highly reliable source of Early Sranan (Arends 1989: 19; Bruyn 1995b: 154-155; Kramp 1983: 3; Plag 1993: 58).
45

Focke (1855; 3725 types, 14923 tokens) is a Sranan-Dutch dictionary by a Creole who is assumed to be a native speaker of Sranan (Arends 1989: 16). It is a highly reliable source, especially valuable for the present investigation because of the information on the lexical categories of the entry words and a considerable number of complex words it contains. It also provides information on the etymology of many Early Sranan words.
Beside these three major sources, additional sources of Early and Modern Sranan were used in the present study with the purpose of testing different hypotheses and gaining additional information about different simplex and complex words. These additional sources of Early Sranan comprise Van den Berg’s (2000) collection of Early Sranan words and sentences in court records of 1667-1767, a fragment from Herlein’s (1718) Description of the Colony of Suriname (published in Arends and Perl 1995), a fragment from Nepveu’s Annotations to Herlein’s (1718) Description of Suriname (1770) (2nd edition, published in Arends and Perl 1995), Wullschlägel’s Deutsch-Negerenglisches Wörterbuch (1856), and Wilner’s Wortubuku fu Sranan Tongo (Dictionary of Sranan) (1994).
Van den Berg (2000) is the investigation of 561 Early Sranan words and 54 sentences extracted from the court records found in the Algemeen Rijksarchief (ARA) in the city of the Hague, the Netherlands. This is an accurate and reliable source of information on Early Sranan, with chronological overview and linguistic description of all words and sentences found in the depositions, testimonies, statements and minutes of examinations of black slaves in the colony of Suriname between 1667 and 1767.
Herlein (1718) is a sample of Early Sranan containing several phrases and sentences. Nepveu (1770) is a correction of Herlein’s (1718) sample of Early Sranan, which contains, beside Herlein’s examples, an additional list of words, phrases and sentences. Both Herlein’s and Nepveu’s Sranan are probably examples of Bakkratongo, a variety of Sranan spoken by Europeans (Arends 1995b: 17; 19).
Wullschlägel’s dictionary of 1856 is the largest available dictionary of Sranan, written by the Moravian missionary who was the head of the Moravian Mission in Paramaribo for some time (Bruyn 1995a: 36). As Wullschlägel (1856: IV) notes, his dictionary is based on some previous work, such as Schumann’s
46

(1783) Dictionary, and the work by another Moravian missionary, Brother W. Treu. Besides, he mentions that his dictionary was looked through ‘word by word’ and commented on by H.C. Focke, who is assumed to be the native speaker of Sranan, Brother C. Döhrmann, who learnt Sranan through long-time communication with the blacks and Brother Ch. U. Graf, a black teacher, also presumably a native speaker of Sranan. Therefore, despite the fact that Wullschlägel’s Sranan was possibly heavily influenced by the missionary variety of Sranan, Church Sranan (Plag 1993: 60), it can be regarded as a reliable source.
Wilner (1994) is a dictionary of modern Sranan and a creation of the Summer Institute of Linguistics. The intention behind this dictionary is to serve as a help for language learners and as a part of the “synchronic description of the language” (Wilner 1994: i).
4.3. The procedure
Since the major units of analysis in word formation are complex words (see chapter 5 for details), the procedure used in the present study consisted mainly in extracting complex words from the sources.
The three major sources of Early Sranan, discussed above, were first computerized and word-lists were extracted from each source with the help of the text retrieval programme TACT. From each word-list, all putatively complex words were then extracted manually. In the next step, all the three sources were additionally searched manually for putatively complex words that had not made it into the word-list for orthographical reasons, for instance, words that were spelled without a hyphen, or as two orthographic words instead of a single orthographic word. Besides, I have eliminated those words form the data lists in which a combination of letters was homographic with a certain morpheme, as in kaiman ‘crocodile’, where the orthographic sequence man is a homograph of the Early Sranan person-forming morpheme -man, as in dressiman (cure-PM) ‘doctor’.
As it will be extensively discussed in the next chapter, the determination of what may count as a complex word is a matter of debate (cf. e.g. Bauer 1988: 109111; Katamba 1993: 19-21). Thus, the issue of whether compounds should be
47

regarded as morphological objects, i.e. complex words, or as syntactic objects, i.e. phrases, is still controversial. In order not to miss any potentially pertinent items, a rather generous policy of what might count as ‘putatively complex word’ was applied. In the next step, all non-complex words were excluded on the basis of a morphological analysis. Thus, only those items were regarded as complex which consisted of two and more elements where at least one element was attested elsewhere. Therefore words, that were complex in the superstratum languages, such as English and Dutch, but entered Early Sranan without morphological decomposition, as e.g. kukru (< Engl. cook room), were not treated as complex. This procedure naturally does not allow to sort out really borderline cases. Therefore, a more detailed discussion of problems with the notion of complex word and the policy of treating words as complex followed in the present study will be done in chapter 5. For the time being, suffice it to say that out of the items remaining after the procedure mentioned above, only those were considered complex words which, firstly, bear a syntactic category specification of the X°level (i.e. N, V, A, etc.) and, secondly, are syntactically inseparable. Thus, e.g. the Early Sranan word tinnatu ‘twelve’ was regarded as complex because it possesses a syntactic category specification of the X°-level (it is a numeral) and cannot be syntactically separated without a fundamental change in meaning. Of course, this type of classification does not exclude borderline cases, where firm evidence for or against a certain decision is lacking. Such cases will receive a detailed discussion in chapter 7.
Beside complex words, the sources were also manually searched for lexicalised phrases of the type feya fo Gado (fire-of-God) ‘lighting’, and circumlocutions, as e.g. wan zomma dissi nay klossi (a-person-who-sews-clothes) ‘tailor’. These were included into the data lists as well. The reason for this lies in the fact that such formations serve the same function as the typical products of word-formation, i.e. complex words, the naming, or referential, function. It will therefore be investigated in how far they were favoured and used in Early Sranan in comparison to complex words.
48

By this procedure, 293 items were obtained from Van Dyk (c1765), 690 from Schumann (1783) and 1300 from Focke (1855).1 All unclear and borderline cases, e.g. between compounding and syntax, as well as lexicalised phrases and circumlocutions are included in these numbers.
All complex words, as well as lexicalised phrases and circumlocutions obtained by the procedure described above were classified according to their structure in terms of the lexical categories, the semantics of the whole complex word/combination, and the semantics of the separate constituents, and process involved in their formation (concatenation, reduplication, etc.). They were then compared to the constructions from the substratum and superstratum languages in terms of their structure and their semantics. For purposes of this comparison, different sources of English and the substratum languages were used.
4.4. Sources of English
One of the major problems arising with comparative historical research is the lack of the necessary data on all varieties that are included in the comparison. To provide a reliable comparison between the word-formation processes and devices of English and Early Sranan, we should, ideally, use sources and data on those English dialects that were spoken by the colonisers in Suriname and other colonies that might have influenced Early Sranan in some respect. This is problematic on two grounds. First, the information on what English dialects were crucial for Early Sranan is very scarce. Second, it would burst the limits of the present investigation to do research on the word-formation processes in these dialects in the 16th-17th century.
The alternative, though not ideal, is then, to use contemporary sources dealing with diachronic research on English word-formation. This is the method used in the present work. The historical data on English word-formation, i.e. on the availability and productivity of certain affixational and compounding patterns
1 For the sake of simplicity, hereafter the three major sources of Early Sranan used in the present study will be referred to only by the name of the author, without mentioning the date of their publication. Only on special occasion, when the date of publication is necessary for the argument, it will be mentioned.
49

in the 16th-17th centuries, were mainly drawn from Marchand (1969) and Koziol (1972), both comprehensive and highly reliable overviews based on a vast variety of other sources, and the OED. Additionally, information on Middle English affixation was gained from a study by Dalton-Puffer (1996) which was especially valuable for the present analysis since it contains data on type and token frequencies of occurrence of different affixes in English between mainly 1150 and 1420, with additional information on the period between 1420-1500. This allowed me to formulate hypotheses about the probability to encounter certain affixes in the input creole creators were exposed to.
4.5. Sources of the substratum languages
The problem arising with the comparison between Early Sranan word-formation and word-formation in the major substratum languages Gbe and Kikongo is actually similar to that mentioned in respect to English in the previous section. The problem lies in the fact that, as Arends (2002b: 54) notes, substratum languages have influenced the creole three centuries ago, a time during which diachronic changes might have taken place in these languages. Thomason (1993) argues that in such cases conservative modern varieties of the input languages can be equally used. This is the method used by several creolists (cf. Arends 2002b: 55). The argument sometimes presented to justify this method is that some substratum languages did not experience extensive diachronic change. Thus, Migge (2003a: 61) argues that the present-day Gbe varieties are conservative descendants of the varieties used during the period of slave trade that did not undergo considerable contact-induced change. A similar claim is made by Westermann (1954: xxii, quoted in Arends 2002b: 54) who notes that the Gbe language Ge underwent little change in the last 300 years. However, as Arends (2002b: 55) stresses, the more reliable method is to use the available early sources on the substratum languages.
Although I agree with Arends (2002b) in this respect, the present investigation is based on the 19th and 20th century sources of the substratum languages because of one major reason. Since complex words from Early Sranan
50

will be compared structurally and semantically with substratum words, the sources of substratum containing large amounts of complex words with their detailed translation are necessary for the present investigation. Such sources, mainly dictionaries, are more ample for the 19th and 20th centuries.
Therefore, the major sources of Ewe come from the work done by the members of the North-German Missionary Society. These include Schlegel’s Schlüssel zur Eẃe Sprache (Key to the Ewe Language) (1856), Westermann’s Grammatik der Ewe-Sprache (Grammar of the Ewe Language) (1907), and Westermann’s Wörterbuch der Ewe-Sprache. I. Teil. Ewe-Deutsches Wörterbuch (Dictionary of the Ewe Language, Part I: Ewe-German Dictionary) (1905) and Wörterbuch der Ewe-Sprache. II. Teil. Deutsch-Ewe Wörterbuch (Dictionary of the Ewe Language, Part II: German-Ewe Dictionary) (1906). Besides, Westermann’s Evefiala or Ewe-English Dictionary. Gbesela Yeye or English-Ewe Dictionary (1928) and some other articles and work by Westermann were consulted for different purposes as well.
Schlegel (1856) was written with the purpose of providing a reference source in the Ewe grammar for other missionaries of the North-German Missionary Society (Schlegel 1856: iii). It was the result of approximately twoyear work during which the author learnt the language himself from the indigenous population. It contains an extensive grammatical information and a small Ewe-German and German-Ewe dictionary. I think it is a rather reliable source, because most of the information, especially on word-formation, I have checked it for corresponds to that contained in Westermann’s (1907) Grammar which is a reliable and widely used source of Ewe.
Westermann’s Grammatik der Ewe-Sprache (Grammar of the Ewe Language) (1907) is an excellent source for the Grammar of Ewe which serves the purpose of an “exhaustive description of the Ewe language” (Westermann 1907: 3*) and provides a rather sophisticated – for that time – description of all the major levels of the language, such as phonology, morphology, syntax.
Beside the sources on Ewe, two sources on another substratum language of the Gbe cluster, Fongbe, were used in the present study: Lefebvre and Brousseau’s A Grammar of Fongbe (2002) and Dictionnaire français-fon (1987) by Rassinoux.
51

The major sources for Kikongo were Bentley’s Dictionary and Grammar of the Kongo Language As Spoken at San Salvador, the Ancient Capital of the Old Kongo Empire, West Africa (1887) and Laman’s Grammar of the Kongo Language (Kikongo) (1912).
Bentley (1887) consists of an extensive dictionary and a grammar guide with detailed descriptions of different word-classes. It was written by a missionary of the English Baptist society who gained his knowledge of the language during a five years’ stay in Kongo. The data presented in the dictionary are based on the San Salvador dialect of Kikongo which is spoken at San Salvador, “the Ancient Capital of the old Kongo Empire” (Bentley 1887: the title page), and were collected by the author and his colleagues during their missionary work. The author also conducted some work in the interior parts of the Kongo state (Bentley 1887: xvi-xvii), but it is unclear in how far the information he gained on the language there entered the dictionary. Although in general, it is difficult to judge the reliability of this source, several facts indicate that it is a reliable source. Thus, Bentley and his colleagues took field notes when communicating with the natives (Bentley 1887: xvi). The information provided in the dictionary was checked for correctness by an informant, who was a native speaker of Kikongo (Bentley 1887: xviii) and with whom the author communicated in Kikongo which indicates authors knowledge of the language. Finally, Bentley’s work is considered “valuable and monumental” by Laman (1912: 8), another researcher of Kikongo.
Another Kikongo source, Laman’s Grammar of the Kongo Language (Kikongo) (1912) is written by a missionary of the Swedish Missionary Society. It contains a detailed description of the phonetics, morphology, and syntax of Kikongo. Laman (1912: 11) notes that his Grammar is based on the Mazinga dialect, which was spoken in the “lower Belgian Kongo” and is well understood in other parts of Kongo. The intention behind his Grammar was to be of help for the Missionary Institutes and general study of Kikongo. Beside his own field work, Laman checked other available work on Kikongo and other Bantu languages and used native informants (Laman 1912: 12).
Beside the sources on the two major substratum languages of Early Sranan, I have also used some sources on another substratum language that became prominent in Suriname after 1720, Twi. The major source for Twi used in the present investigation is Christaller’s A Grammar of the Asante and Fante
52

Language called Tshi [Chwee, Twi]: Based on the Akuapem Dialect with reference to the Other (Akan and Fante) Dialects (1875) which is a reliable source of this language (Reineke 1982: 2; 7; 11-12). It is based on both previous linguistic work on Twi and on field work with native speakers of this language (Christaller 1875: II). The grammatical descriptions it contains show the author’s high linguistic awareness and sophistication, since they raise problems that are still relevant today.
Beside these major sources, some other sources of the substratum languages were used as well. They are listed in the references.
4.6. Problems encountered with the sources of Early Sranan
4.6.1. General problems
Problems encountered in the present investigation mainly arose from the nature of early sources.
The first major problem lay in the difficulty to compare word-formation patterns from the three sources. Although all the three sources were written at different periods of time, and there is a not inconsiderable time-span between Schumann (1783) and Focke (1855), it was problematic to treat certain patterns as a result of a diachronic development, or to make comments on the productivity of certain patterns. Thus, for instance, some word-formation patterns attested in Schumann and Focke do not appear in Van Dyk. At first glace, it might be hypothesised that such patterns developed later. However, there is a significant difference between Van Dyk and the other two sources in terms of size and genre. First, Van Dyk is a much smaller source: it contains 1221 types in contrast to 2391 in Schumann and 3725 in Focke. Second, it is not a dictionary, as the other two, but a language manual, that contains word lists, dialogues, and texts. It rather represents spoken than written language. Therefore the absence of some patterns in this source might be merely accidental. In the course of the present
53

investigation, I will discuss the differences between the three sources with caution, resulting from the problem just discussed.
A related problem consisted in the fact that potential regional and social differences in the use of different complex words could not be taken into account in the present investigation. First, as it has already been pointed out above, for some sources, e.g. Van Dyk, it is unclear what variety it really represents. Second, even if the source contains comments on the differences between Bakkra-tongo and Ningretongo, as it is the case with Schumann, they are available in the area of simplex words and syntactic constructions, but are scarce for complex words. Therefore the difference between the two varieties could not be taken into account in the present investigation.
Another set of problems is connected to the ways of presenting translations of complex words by the authors of different sources.
For instance, in most cases complex words (primarily compounds) are not presented as separate entries in the sources, but are listed in the entry of one of the components, therefore sometimes the translations of complex words were missing. In other cases translations of one of the components are not provided which posed problems in making judgements about the structure and the semantic transparency of such words. In such cases I either established the translations myself, if it was possible on the basis of the context, or consulted other sources (e.g. Van den Berg 2000; Wullschlägel 1856). In those cases where no context necessary for the identification of the meaning of a word was provided, I put a question mark instead of a translation in front of the pertinent item.
The second translation problem is that Van Dyk often provides literary, but not literal translations of Sranan words and sentences, as is demonstrated in (1):
54

(1) a. Bekassi da koffi no tan klari na tappe tafelen da tem da because DEF coffee NEG stand clear on top table DEF time DEF ogeri mastra tan ope na slibi evil master stand up at/on sleep Arends (1995b: 167): ‘Because his coffee was not on the table when that wicked master got up.’ Van Dyk (c1765: 49): ‘Toen die kwaaije Meester uit zyn Slaap-Kaamer kwam, was de Koffi niet gereed.’
b. Ai mi zi ma zingi man no de yes 1SG see but sing person NEG be-there Arends (1995b: 234): ‘Yes I do, but there’s nobody to sing.’ Van Dyk (c1765: 108): ‘Ja dat zien ik wel, maar ik hoor jelui niet Zingen.’
In the example (1a) the portion tan ope na slibi is translated by Van Dyk as uit zyn Slaap-Kaamer kwam ‘came from the bedroom’ which does not render the original Sranan version tan ope na slibi meaning literally ‘got up from sleep’. The same is true about the example in (1b): the Sranan ma zingi man no de ‘but there are no singer(s)’ is translated by Van Dyk as ‘but I don’t hear you singing’. In such cases, I did not follow Van Dyk in translating Sranan items.
4.6.2. Problems with the orthographic presentation of complex words in the sources
Apart from the general problems discussed above, a more specific problem with the sources is a considerable inconsistency in the spelling of complex words. This partially lies in the lack of standardisation of Sranan’s spelling system that lasted for a long time. Kramp (1983: 21) argues that since the 18th century several spelling systems had been devised for Sranan, but no one had been standardised, and even the official “provisional spelling” introduced in 1960 did not result in greater consistency. This inconsistency manifests itself to a different extent in each of the three sources used for the present study.
55

As far as Van Dyk is concerned, two spelling conventions for complex items are attested in this source: writing the elements of a complex word separately, as e.g. blakke stom ‘vitriol’, hasi man ‘groom’, drinki hosse ‘inn’ or together, as e.g. tiriman ‘oarsman’ or koekroehoman ‘kitchen maid’. Interestingly enough, no hyphenated complex entities have been attested in Van Dyk (c1765) which makes this source different from the other two in this respect, Schumann (1783) and Focke (1855), where hyphenated complex items are quite common.
The general and most frequent tendency in Van Dyk (c1765) is that of spelling the constituent morphemes of a complex item separately and it seems to hold across various types of complex structures. Thus, out of 44 combinations of two simplex nouns analysed for the purposes of the present paper only three have spelling together as the only attested orthographic variant. The morphological status of complex items does not play any role in the spelling conventions. For instance, items with non-compositional meaning are written separately: e.g. kaka gout (to shit-gold) ‘squanderer’ or blakke stom (black-stone) meaning ‘vitriol’. Out of 22 concatenations with the person morpheme -man, only two: granman ‘governour/king’ and tiriman ‘steersman’ are written together, and one word has two spelling variants: together and separately: schrifi man/schribi man and schrifiman (to write-PM) ‘bookkeeper’. Even reduplications are spelt predominantly separately: out of 21 cases of reduplication none has writing together as the only variant, and only three have both spelling variants: together and separately: balibali/bali bali (shout-shout) ‘noise’, koni koni/konikoni ‘rabbit’ and wan wan/wawan ‘only/alone/by oneself’. Component morphemes in reduplicated words are written separately even in cases of opaque reduplication, where the reduplicated morpheme is not attested independently in any of the three sources used in the present study, as in kesi kesi ‘monkey’ or wiri wiri/werri weri ‘hair’. Similarly, words with bound morphemes can exhibit writing separately, such as the variants istre de and estre de of the Early Sranan word for ‘yesterday’ which also has the following variants: esteredé/estrede/estredé/es trede/estre de/isterede.
56

The number of items whose components are written together is rather small: only 10 out of 2182 complex items analysed have the ‘together’ variant as the only attested spelling variant. The group of these 10 items is not homogeneous in terms of structure since it comprises such types as N-N concatenations (e.g. koekroehoman ‘kitchen maid’), concatenations with the person morpheme -man (e.g. granman ‘governour/king’), and concatenations containing bound roots, such as lydom meaning ‘to lie (down)’, where ly- is a bound morpheme.3 There are also two words: mamamtem/mamantim/mammantim/manmantem/manmatim/man mantim ‘morning’ and kommote/kom motte/kommotte ‘to come from/to come out/come back from’ that have both spelling variants: together and separately, but in the ‘separate variant’ it is the syllables or letters of the first component that are written separately, and not the two constituent morphemes. These two words have not been included into the number of 10 items given above.
In very few cases, 16 out of 218 items analysed from Van Dyk, complex items exhibit both spelling variants: together and separately, as e.g. balibali/bali bali ‘noise’ or schrifi man/schribi man/schrifiman ‘bookkeeper’. Words belonging to this group have different types of structure, such as concatenations with the morpheme -man, concatenations with bound roots, reduplications, etc. so that no specific regularity can be observed in this respect.
Another general problem with orthography in Van Dyk is that complex words often have a number of orthographic variants which differ not only in the ‘together’ or ‘separate’ spelling of the constituent morphemes, but also in a number of other aspects. Thus, on the one hand, there are complex words exhibiting different orthographic variants based on the difference in the spelling of word segments (e.g. letters or syllables), as in (2):

(2) botte man/bootie man
go we/go wee/goe we hondi man/hontje man hossi homan/hosse homan wiri wiri/werri weri

‘oarsman’ ‘to go away’ ‘hunter’ ‘woman servant’ ‘hair’

2 Phrases and opaque formations have been excluded from this number, but borderline and unclear cases are included in here. 3 Note that the morpheme dom is not bound in Van Dyk (c1765) since it occurs independently, as
e.g in Zon dom kaba. (sun-be down-already) ‘The sun goes/is down already’ (Arends 1995b: 127: ‘The sun has gone down’; Van Dyk c1765: 22: ‘De Zon gaat onder’).

57

On the other hand, there are complex words whose orthographic variants are based on both different spellings of word segments and different ways of spelling together vs. spelling separately of word segments (e.g. letters or syllables), as in (3):

(3) dia metti/di ja metti
kommote/kom motte/kommotte krokte hant/kroeke te hand a rey tem/ry tem

‘venison’ ‘to come from/to come out/come back from’ ‘the left hand’ ‘the rainy season’

Besides, the problem of orthographic inconsistency in Van Dyk concerns not only complex, but simplex words as well. The same simplex word can also have different orthographic variants which differ either in the ‘together’ or ‘separate’ way of writing letters and syllables or in different ways of writing the same segment, or both. This made the electronic search for words in Van Dyk rather difficult.
The orthographic inconsistency of Van Dyk had two major consequences for the present investigation. First, the source was to a great extent searched manually for complex words. Second, orthography could not be used as a criterion for deciding what should count as a word.
The other two sources, Schumann and Focke, exhibit a greater degree of orthographic consistency. However, their orthography also posed similar problems to those discussed above, although to a lesser degree.
Thus, there are three conventions of spelling complex words in Schumann: words spelt together, e.g. dringihosso (to drink-house) ‘pub/guesthouse’, hyphenated: boy-areen (boy-rain) ‘small rain’; banna-watra banana-water ‘banana juice’ and separately, e.g. bunne heddi (good-head) ‘luck’; lala bredi (raw-bread) ‘bread dough’. Moreover, one and the same word may have two orthographical variants, e.g. honifrei/honi-frei (honey-fly) ‘bee’; kákkabrudu/kaka brudu (to excrement-blood) ‘dysentery’; krukkutu-tereh/krukkutu tereh (crookedtail) ‘scorpion’ or even three, e.g. Bakkratongo/Bakkra-tongo/Bakkra tongo (white-person-tongue) ‘White man’s tongue’. This discrepancy of spelling variants reminds of English where the problem of spelling compounds is a notorious one. Thus, Marchand (1969: 21; cf. also Katamba 1993: 293-294) notes that there is a complete “lack of uniformity” in the spelling of compounds in

58

English since they may be spelt together (wordformation), hyphenated (wordformation) and separately (word formation). This inconsistency made it difficult to search for complex words and to rely on orthographic information in defining the morphological status of a word.
However, in contrast to Van Dyk, there are certain regularities behind Schumann’s orthography. For instance, it is mainly words consisting of two free bases that have several spelling variants. In contrast to them, for those complex words in which one of the elements is a bound morpheme or a morpheme that serves a specific derivational function, e.g. forming numerals, spelling together dominates, whereas spelling with a hyphen or separately is rather rare. For instance, out of the 67 words with the person-forming morpheme -man only one has two spelling variants: boonjamman and boon-jam-man (gout-PM) ‘person who has gout’, all the other are written together. Note that this word does not have the spelling variant where the elements are written separately. Out of 8 words with the morpheme -tentîn (< Engl. time + Dutch tien), used to form tens from twenty to ninety, only one has two spelling variants where the elements are spelt separately (tu tentîn) and together (tutentîn). All 7 words with the bound morpheme -weh (< Engl. away/way) are spelt together. Note also that several words in Schumann’s Dictionary are defined by Schumann as ‘dictio enclitica’, e.g. peh (< Engl. place) ‘place’, tron (< Engl. turn) ‘time’, wan (< Engl. one) ‘one’, and such elements are spelt predominantly together when they occur in a combination with other words. Out of 23 words with the element -tron one word has two spelling variants: together: fotron ‘four times’ and separately fo tron, and there is one word in which the element -tron is written separately from the base: som tron ‘sometimes’.
The discussion above suggests that Schumann relied on his own linguistic knowledge and/or intuition in the spelling of complex words. This is demonstrated by the fact that words with bound morphemes are spelt together in most cases, whereas combinations of free bases are often spelt hyphenated or even separately. Interestingly, Kramp (1983: 21) remarks in respect to Schumann’s Dictionary that “the spelling and accents used in the manuscript are not necessarily an accurate representation of those of his (i.e. Schumann’s; note is mine, M.B.) informants”. It is arguable, however, in how far Schumann’s informants were consistent in their spelling and in how far their spelling reflects the morphological status of complex
59

words. It is an undeniable fact, however, that Schumann’s orthography of complex words is not totally random, and can therefore, although with due caution, be used in for the present analysis.
Similarly to Schumann, Focke has three spelling conventions for complex words: together, as in bégiman (beg-PM) ‘beggar’, hyphenated, as in doifi-pési (dove-pea) ‘a special kind of shrub (Sesbania picta)’ and separately, e.g. gran mamà (grand-mother) ‘grandmother’. As in Schumann, complex words in Focke may have different spelling variants, e.g. koni-kóni-bíta and konikoni-bíta (rabbitbitters) ‘a special kind of plant (Aristolochia Surinamensis)’ or krassi-krássi and kraskrassi (scratch-scratch) ‘rash’, or krobói-sódro and krobói sódro (last-ceiling) ‘attic’. This again posed the same problems with the search of complex words and the use of orthography for identifying the status of a given complex word as with the other two sources.
A specific problem with Focke’s orthography consisted in the fact that in contrast to the other two authors, Focke uses different accents to mark stress. Therefore, one and the same complex word may exhibit several variants that differ in the type of the accent or in the absence-presence of the stress marking, e.g. láitori/lái-tóri/lai-tóri (guess-story) ‘riddle’ or loángoe-tetéi/loängoe-tetéi (Loangorope) ‘name of a plant’. This made the electronic search, and thus the identification of all possible orthographic variants of one and the same complex word problematic.
In general, however, Focke’s orthography, similarly to Schumann, should not be left disregarded since it displays certain regularities and consistencies. For instance, none of reduplications or words with the person-forming morpheme man are written separately in Focke. The number of complex words written separately is in general rather small.
Beside the problem with complex words written separately, there were some non-complex words occasionally written together or hyphenated, e.g. Focke’s kómpe-bákka (friend-again) which is not a complex word. Such combinations were excluded from the data.
In conclusion, the inconsistency in the orthographic presentation of complex words resulted in the fact that orthographic information was only marginally involved in the analysis of Early Sranan word-formation in the present work.
60

4.6.3. Problems arising with stress assignment in the sources
Another problem arising with the Early Sranan data lies in the fact that the sources contain very little information on the phonology of Early Sranan complex words, especially stress assignment and availability of tones which are crucial for drawing some borderlines in morphology, e.g. between compounds and phrases.
In Van Dyk, for instance, several complex words bear accentuation marks, as e.g. zondè ‘Sunday’ or toe de workè ‘Tuesday’. However, such cases are very few and it is unclear whether these marks indicate stress, tone, vowel length or something else.
As far as Schumann’s Dictionary is concerned, Kramp (1983: 23) makes an observation that “the main stress of a word remains on the same syllable when it forms a compound4 with another word.” In (4) two examples provided by Kramp are listed:
(4) asêh→asêhman
kákka→mankákka
This statement, however, is a generalisation which needs further comment. The problem is that Schumann does not provide information on stress assignment for all simplex words in his dictionary, but mainly for those where, according to Kramp, stress assignment deviates from the general rule. This general rule is stated by Kramp as follows:
Like in present-day Sranan the stress in Early Sranan seems to fall generally on the penultimate syllable (Kramp 1983: 22; emphasis is mine, M.B.).
What can be concluded from Kramp’s remarks is that in Schumann’s Dictionary, stress is indicated in complex words only in those cases which deviate from this rule. It means that in the word mankákka it is in fact unclear whether the stress on the first syllable of the second component must be regarded as the main stress of the complex word and whether the first syllable is then unstressed or receives
4 It must be noted here that Kramp (1983) applies the term ‘compound’ to all kinds of complex words attested in the dictionary. I prefer the term ‘complex word’ on the grounds explained in the previous chapter.
61

secondary stress. It may well be the case that if Schumann marked stress in complex words he intended to show that the stress assignment of one of the elements deviates from the rule mentioned by Kramp above or just to provide additional information about stress in a particular word. This results in inconsistency of the information about the stress patterns of complex words and makes it impossible to use such information for the present analysis.
In contrast to the two other sources, in Focke (1855) complex words are marked for stress. In the introduction to his dictionary, Focke mentions the fact that he uses accent acute < ´ > to mark stress, accent grave < ` > to mark stress on the final sound thus showing the shortness of the vowel, and accent circumflex < ^ > to mark long stressed vowels. In general, four types of stress assignment in complex words can be singled out in Focke:

(5) a. the first element is stressed: b. the second element is
stressed:
c. both elements bear the same
type of stress:
d. no stress is marked:

boési-meti (bush-animal) ‘wild animal’ bobi-wátra (breast-water) ‘mother’s milk’
béri-plési (bury-place) ‘cemetery’
kwatta-pattoe (monkey of special kind-pot) ‘name of a fruit (Lecythis Zabucajo?5)

Besides, two other patterns can be distinguished depending on the position of the element marked for stress on the last short vowel:

(6) a. the first element is marked for stress kiskíssi-makà (monkey-thorn) ‘palm-

generally, and the second is marked for tree of special kind’

the final stress on the short vowel:

b. the first element is marked for the final pinà-wíki (suffer-week) ‘Passion

stress on the short vowel, and the

Week’

second is marked for stress generally:

c. both elements are marked for the final adjidjà-makkà (hedgehog-thorn)

stress on the short vowel:

‘spine of a hedgehog’

5 The question mark after the Latin terms for plants and animals is taken over from Focke (1855) and indicates the author’s indeterminacy about the correctness of the information provided.
62

However, despite the fact that almost each complex word is marked for stress, no connection between a particular stress pattern and the morphological type of the complex word, or its semantics could be established. For instance, among the 64 complex words containing the person marker -man, all variants enumerated in (5) are attested: stress on the first element, as in azéman (witchcraft-PM) ‘magician’, stress on the morpheme -man, as in ferfimán (paint-PM) ‘painter’, stress on both elements, e.g. bótomán (boat-PM) ‘oarsman’ and no stress marking at all, as in sidon-man (sit-PM) ‘person who sits’. The same is true with other types of complex words, e.g. N-N concatenations or reduplications. Besides, one and the same complex word may appear with different stress patterns in Focke, as e.g. bére-mán/beremán (belly-woman) ‘pregnant woman’ or boenhatti/boenhátti/bóen hatti (good-heart) ‘kind-hearted(ness)’ or lái-tori/lái-tóri/lai-tóri (guess-story) ‘riddle’. Again, it is unclear what triggers the use of a particular variant of the same word.
It can be concluded that because of the scarcity of the information on stress, the phonological criterion, e.g. of leftward stress, as in English, cannot not be used for distinguishing compounds and phrases in the present study.
4.7. Organisational remarks
Several remarks in respect to the organisation of this paper are due here. The original spelling of all Sranan words used in the present study has
been preserved. However, because of the reasons of space, I provide only one spelling variant, randomly chosen, for each complex word cited. The data lists in the appendix to the present study contain all spelling variants of the complex words and circumlocutions used.
The spelling of the substratum examples has been adopted without any changes from the substratum sources discussed above.
All German and Dutch translations have been translated into English by the author of the present study. However, all data sentences are provided in both, English and the original language of the author of the source, i.e. German or Dutch. Another remark due here is that translations for the numerous names of
63

plants and animals from Focke (1855) were often shortened for the sake of simplicity to ‘name of a plant’ or ‘name of an animal’ since nearer specifications of their biological properties were not necessary for the present study.
The data lists for a particular word-formation pattern provided in the course of discussion often contain only a choice of complex words built according to it. The exhaustive data lists are provided in the appendix.
The pages for citations and data sentences from the sources are the pages of the original manuscripts, and not the modern editions. For translations, the pages are cited from the modern editions.
The examples of Early Sranan words are often provided without any specific reference to the source since the complete data lists are provided in the appendix at the end of the present study.

5. The analysis of Early Sranan word-formation: theoretical background and practical considerations
5.1. Introduction
In the present chapter an array of theoretical and practical questions relevant for a study of word formation in general and in a creole language in particular will be addressed. First a number of key notions, such as ‘word-formation’, ‘word’ and ‘complex word’ will be clarified and specified for the purposes of the present study. Next, processes generally involved in word-formation will be discussed. Special focus will be on the problems connected with distinguishing two borderlines crucial in an investigation of word-formation: that between affixation and compounding, and that between compounding and phrasal syntax. This will help us to pursue the question which is of particular relevance for the present study: whether traditional distinctions and criteria, developed for the analysis of word-formation in ‘older’ languages, such as English, are applicable to creole languages, and if not what modifications are necessary to arrive at an adequate alternative. This will lead us to a development of a theoretical framework for the analysis of Early Sranan word-formation.
5.2. Word-formation, words and complex words
5.2.1. The boundaries of word-formation and the notion of word Word-formation is concerned with non-simplex forms and is defined as the “investigation and description of processes and rule-governed formation of new complex words on the basis of already existing linguistic resources” (Bussmann 1996: 522). Marchand (1969: 2) defines word-formation as “that branch of the
65

science of language which studies the patterns on which a language forms new lexical units, i.e. words”. As the definitions suggest, three issues are at stake in a study of word-formation. First, word-formation investigates the RESOURCES out of which a language coins new words. Second, it also describes the PROCESSES by which the resources are employed for the creation of words. And finally, WORDS, especially COMPLEX WORDS are vital to word-formation since their creation is the purpose of word-formation. Therefore, to develop a framework for the analysis of Early Sranan word-formation, we will first pursue the question of what a word is and what is usually regarded as a complex word, and how the two notions will be defined in the present study.
Defining a word is a notoriously controversial issue in linguistics (cf. Anderson 1992: 17-21; Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002; Packard 2000: 7-20; Plag 2003c: 4-9; Singleton 1999: 10-14). Since the decision on what should be defined as a word in Early Sranan and thus in the present study is of considerable importance here, I will discuss some of the common definitions of ‘word’ and their relevance in the context of the present investigation.
Thus, a word can be defined in the orthographic sense: as written material between two spaces. Although intuitively this might work as a definition for languages like Russian or German where written texts usually contain spaces between words, it creates problems for languages like Chinese where texts are segmented into characters which usually represent morphemes (cf. Packard 2000: 8). Besides, different language communities establish different orthographic conventions for the separation of words (e.g. Bantu languages of southern Africa (Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002: 8)). The way of presenting complex words may also be a matter of such an orthographic convention: thus, in German, spelling together of separate elements in a compound (Straßenbahnendhaltestelle; Wohnbaudefizitvermeidungsstrategie, taken from Motsch 1999: 8) is conventionalised. In English, however, it is not uncommon to write components in a compound separately, as in word formation (cf. Marchand 1969: 21; Katamba 1993: 293-294). This has the consequence that an orthographic notion of word is probably too restrictive to cover all wordlike entities of a language: orthographically instances like word formation in English are not words. However, by morphological, syntactic or semantic criteria they are. The situation in Early Sranan resembles that of English: in all the three sources used for the
66

present study some of the two-component compounds are written separately or have an orthographic variant where the components are written separately, which raises confusion with the orthographic notion of word. Another, more general problem lies in the inconsistent orthography of the sources, especially Van Dyk (c1765). Thus, in Van Dyk spaces are sometimes inserted between syllables of the same word, as e.g. in (1) where the syllables of the word wandi meaning ‘to want’ are separated by a space:

(1) Hendrik joe wan di wan zopi fossi. Hendrik 2SG want INDEF rum first ‘Hendrik, do you want a rum first?’ Arends (1995b: 179): ‘Hendrik, would you like a drink first?’ Van Dyk (c1765: 60): ‘Hendrik will je eerst een Mondje vol hebben.’

On the other hand, there are cases where spaces are missing between two words which are not compounds and which seem to be spelt together occasionally, as in (2), where two words: the indefinite article wan and the noun dija meaning ‘deer’ are spelt together:

(2) mi ben de

na

wandija

bakke

1SG PAST be-there at/on INDEF+deer back

Arends (1995b: 192): ‘I was after a deer.’

(Van Dyk c1765: 71): ‘..ik heb niets gezien als een Harten-Beest.’

Although, as I have shown in the previous chapter, this problem does not arise in the other two sources, Schumann (1783) and Focke (1855), to the same extent, it makes the notion of the orthographic word alone not reliable for the present analysis.
Beside an orthographic notion of word there have been attempts to define a word in phonological terms. A rather general definition of this kind appeared in Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002: 13) according to which a phonological word is a phonological unit of minimally a syllable or larger than a syllable which exhibits one and/or more phonological defining property(ies) from the areas of segmental (e.g. internal syllabic and segmental structure) or prosodic features (e.g. stress
67

phenomena) or of phonological rules (rules that apply within a phonological word). Thus, in English, for instance, words usually have one main stress, which is an important criterion for distinguishing words from e.g. phrases. As it has already been mentioned in chapter 4 above, the difficulty (or even impossibility) of applying this kind of concept to the data from Early Sranan lies in the scarceness of the information on stress and tone phenomena in the Early Sranan sources used in the present study, which hinders the application of e.g. the criterion of stress to Early Sranan complex words.
The word has also been defined in the lexical sense, as a listed item of a language. However, as pointed out by Packard (2000: 9), there are two problems with such a definition. First, not only words, but syntactic items with noncompositional meaning, such as idioms, are listed in the lexicon as well (Di Sciullo and Williams 1987: 5). The consequence of this fact for the lexical definition of word is that idioms must be regarded as words because of their listedness. Second, if a lexicon is conceived of as a list of idiosyncratic items, this then has the consequence that words built by rules and having a compositional meaning are not included into the lexicon and are thus not words. The lexical concept of word will not be what I will rely on in the present study, since both regular and idiosyncratic complex entities will be the focus of analysis here. However, the notion of listedness will be invoked in the description of complex items in Early Sranan since idiomaticity is a feature akin to a number of them.
Semantically, the word is defined as an expression of a “unified semantic concept” (Plag 2003c: 7). As Plag (2003c: 7) observes, this definition is problematic in two respects. First, the notion of ‘a unified semantic concept’ is not quite clear. Second, unified semantic concepts must not by necessity be expressed by one word. This makes the definition in question not suitable for the purposes of the present investigation.
Another concept to be commented on here is that of morphological word. Thus, Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 1) define morphological words (or, as they call it, “morphological object”) as a set of atoms (morphemes) and rules of morpheme combination (affixation and compounding). Packard (2000: 12) defines a morphological word for Chinese as a “proper output of word-formation rules in the language”. Packard argues that there is a “clear, discrete set of word-formation rules” in Chinese, whose output does not fully overlap with wordlike entities
68

which might be derived by using other criteria. The trouble with the morphological definition is then that it tells only half of the story: indeed, languages may also possess wordlike units created not through operation of morphological rules, but via reanalysis of syntactic phrases (cf. Dijkhoff 1993) or via lexicalisation and analogy (cf. Giegerich 2004). Such units are not morphological words in the sense of the definition by Di Sciullo and Williams above, but they appear to be a common word-formation strategy in a number of languages, such as Spanish, French, Papiamentu (Dijkhoff 1993). In a similar vein, word-formation strategies of a contact language like Early Sranan are not exhausted by rule-governed word-formation which makes the definition in question too restrictive for the present analysis.
Syntactically, words are viewed as minimal units of syntax which occupy X° category slots (Selkirk 1982: 6). Words have also been defined as syntactic atoms (Di Sciullo and Williams 1987: 1; 49-54) which can be moved in a sentence in accordance with syntactic rules but whose internal structure is invisible to these rules. As Plag (2003c: 8) argues, identification of words can be done by testing whether a given entity belongs to a certain syntactic category: noun, verb, adjective, etc. In a similar vein, Packard (2000: 13) notes that defining a syntactic word presupposes identification of basic class categories and the use of native speaker judgements for discovering entities that can occupy minimal category slots in sentences. Interestingly, Packard argues that it is the syntactic notion of word that is crucial in defining a word in the orthographic and lexical sense. In Early Sranan we can also identify words by their belonging to basic syntactic categories. Thus, in the Early Sranan sentence dissi netti mi drem (this-night-I-to dream) ‘I dream this night’ (Schumann 1783: 36) we can identify four different words by their different syntactic positions: dissi as a determiner in a prenominal position, netti as a noun, mi as a pronoun and drem as a verb. These words are also syntactically inseparable: *ne-dissi-tti is impossible. However, as I will show later, it is not always unproblematic to apply the notion of syntactic atomiticy on the early data. In general, I will largely rely on the syntactic definition of word in the present study.
The foregoing allows the following generalisation. Though orthographic, phonological, semantic and morphological aspects can be important for clarifying the notion of word in a particular language, in the case of Early Sranan it is the
69

syntactic definition that is crucial, and the one we will rely on in a overwhelming number of cases. However, there are a number of entities in Early Sranan that can hardly be defined as words in the sense of minimal units of syntax, but whose existence in Early Sranan makes us seriously think about where exactly we should draw the borders of word-formation in the present study. Thus, for instance, in Van Dyk a number of concepts, especially designations of occupations, are expressed by way of circumlocution, e.g. wan myki zoe zoe (one-to make-shoe(s)) ‘shoemaker’ or homan disi nay klossi (woman-who-to sew-clothes) meaning ‘seamstress’. Or consider the examples blakka vo tappo (black-of-heaven) ‘cloud’ and watra va hai (water-of-eye) ‘tear’ from Schumann (1783) which exhibit a phrasal structure, but function as naming or referring entities. It is a vexed issue whether such constructions are minimal units of syntax. Such examples can hardly be regarded as words according to the criteria surveyed above, but they can be argued to be similar to words in their function. They also suggest that beside some traditional word-formation devices, languages employ other strategies for creating word-like naming and referring units. This brings us back to the issue of where the boundaries of word-formation should be drawn. What I have tried until now is to define ‘word’ from the point of view of its properties. However, as the discussion above suggests, another angle, that of defining words through their function, can be important as well. In this respect, words can be viewed in the way defined by Bauer (1983: 86), as names for things, events or states of affairs. One of the most important functions of word-formation is then that of naming or, as Rainer (1993: 42-43) points out, of Begriffsbildung (‘formation of a concept’). Examples presented above might be argued to carry a very similar function, that of referring to things, states, etc. Therefore it appears as relevant to me to follow this ‘broader’ concept of word-formation in the present study and thus to include in the analysis not only words in the syntactic sense defined above and not only words as a naming units, but also entities that fulfill the function of referring to objects, states, processes etc. Thus word formation as it is conceived of in the present work is not only the study of processes by which new words are created, but also an investigation of strategies involved by creole speakers in naming and referring to objects, states, processes etc.
70

5.2.2. Defining complex words
The present section is devoted to the notion of complex words that are the major products of word formation and the object of the present study. I will first examine what is generally understood under the notion ‘complex word’, and will then turn to the question of what problems arise with this notion in the analysis of Early Sranan word-formation.
Basically, two types of definitions of complex words can be distinguished: those that concentrate on the structural aspect of this notion and those which define complex words in terms of the processes of their formation. It is relevant to comment on both types here.
Definitions of the first type are built on the ‘technical’ idea of complexity: certain units are described as formally complex because they can be divided into smaller units. Thus, Katamba (1993: 20) defines as ‘complex’ those words that “can be broken down into smaller units that are meaningful”. In a similar vein, Adams (2001: 2) considers complex those words in which more than one component is recognisable. Spencer (1991: 5) notes that a morphologically complex word contains a “central morpheme which contributes the basic meaning, and a collection of other morphemes serving to modify this meaning in various ways”. These definitions demand a prior clarification of what a unit/component/morpheme is. The commonest definition of a morpheme is the one in which it is regarded as the smallest grammatical or the smallest meaningful element of language. Besides, a morpheme is usually conceived of as a unit of form and meaning (Bauer 1988: 247; Bussmann 1996: 313; Haspelmath 2002: 16; Katamba 1993: 19-21; Matthews 1974: 11-12; Plag 2003c: 20). However, this kind of definition raises problems of two kinds.
First, there are units in a language that have a certain form, but to whom any specific meaning can hardly be attached. Thus, the so-called ‘cranberry’ or ‘unique’ morphs are units that do not have a clearly identifiable meaning or grammatical function but nevertheless differentiate one word from another, e.g. cran- and bil- in cranberry and bilberry. It creates difficulties to regard such units as meaningful, and thus to regard them as morphemes, but we would equally run into problems if we say that the units cran- and bil- are not morphemes: then we
71

must call the words containing cranberry morphemes simplex which again creates problems because the complexity of their structure is evident through comparison with such words, as blackberry, blueberry, goldenberry etc. (see Bauer 1983: 37; 1988: 40-41 for discussion). As Bauer (1988: 40) argues, however, the meaning of a cranberry morph can be determined by “subtracting the meanings associated with the known morphs in the construction from the meaning of the construction as a whole.”
A similar problem with the notion of morpheme arises when we consider formations such as blends: it might be difficult at first sight to associate any specific meaning with the element -idity in the blend fixidity (< fixity + rigidity), and thus, it is difficult to say that -idity is a morpheme, and hence, that the word fixidity is a complex one. However, it is also problematic to view such cases as simplex forms because it is evident that they are further analysable, by way of comparison with the words from which they have been created, and consist of smaller units. What is crucial in such forms as fixidity is the identifiable semantic and formal relation to the free morphemes fixity and rigidity, and it is this relation that allows to determine the meaning of the elements like -idity and thus view such words as complex. These two examples demonstrate, that in problematic cases, where a certain meaning cannot be straightforwardly associated with a particular element, additional hints should be searched for.
The second problem with the notion of morpheme arises from the fact that there are units in a language that have certain meaning but no ‘visible’ form for this meaning. Thus, in case of conversion wolf (N) – to wolf (V) there is no evident change in the form, which at first sight might lead to an assumption that the word to wolf contains only one morpheme. However, there is an evident change in meaning, which leads us to assume the presence of a formally empty form, and thus to consider the converted verb to wolf a polymorphemic word. Similarly, truncations lab, fridge, veg may also seem to be monomorphemic because only one unit is formally recognisable in them. But, as Plag (2003c: 117) argues, the process of deleting can be associated with a certain meaning, the marking of familiarity of the speaker with the referent, and a certain form: truncation itself. Hence one might argue that truncations consist of at least two morphemes, and are complex words. The next related case is the process of vowel alternation (foot-feet) where again a certain meaning can be pinned down, but no
72

‘visible’ morph through which this meaning is being conveyed. All these cases show clearly that the notions ‘complexity’ and ‘morpheme’ are interconnected: judgments about complexity of a particular word depend largely on the way in which the term ‘morpheme’ is approached. If morphemes are treated not only as visible elements, but also, as Plag (2003c: 23) and Spencer (1991: 15-20) note, as processes or rules that render certain meanings, then converted words, truncations, blends, words built by vowel alternation and the like (see Spencer 1991: 15-20 for an overview) must be viewed as complex words.
The foregoing allows two generalisations. First, a morpheme can be regarded either as a ‘physical’ entity of form and meaning or as a process. Second, in all the instances cited above complex words contain at least one morpheme that was an entity of form and meaning: thus, it is the case with berry in cranberry, wolf in to wolf, lab in lab etc. Upon this background, the definitions of the kind provided by Katamba (1993) and Adams (2001) are either too vague or inadequate. In this connection Spencer’s definition comes closest to the point I am making, namely that a complex word can be viewed as consisting of at least two elements one of which is a unit of form and meaning, and the second/other can be either a unit of form and meaning, or cranberry morph, or a process.
Complex words can also be defined in terms of processes of their formation. Thus, Marchand (1969: 2-3), uses the term ‘composites’ to denote words which are the result of one of the following processes: affixation, compounding, zero derivation, backformation, “expressive symbolism, blending, clipping, rime and ablaut germination, word-manufacturing”. Plag (2003c: 9-13) describes two major ways of producing complex forms: concatenation, i.e. combining bases and/or affixes “as in a chain” which are divided into affixation and compounding, and non-concatenative ways, such as conversion, truncation, blending (cf. Adams 2001: 2; Bauer 1983: 29-30).
The foregoing allows us to add another specification to the definition of ‘complex word’ provided above, that complex words can be produced by concatenative or non-concatenative word-formation processes. The next step to be made here is then to examine what should and will be regarded as a complex word in a creole language like Early Sranan.
73

5.2.3. What should be regarded as a ‘complex word’ in a creole language?

The problem of treating the internal structure of complex words in not new in creole linguistics. Lefebvre (1998: 303) mentions this problem in respect to Haitian complex words which may not exhibit an internal structure in contrast to their French counterparts with an internal structure. Indeed, morpheme boundary shift is regarded as a wide-spread phenomenon in language contact situations (Dijkhoff 1993: 37-38; Holm 2000: 127-130). As Holm (2000: 129) suggests, the frequent occurrence of free morphemes together in a phrase, as well as the frequent occurrence of a word in one of its forms are possible reasons of morpheme boundary shift. To uncover a similar tendency in Early Sranan, I will give regard to several groups of words which are of particular relevance in respect to their internal structure. The first group is exemplified in (3)1:

(3) Words with two bound elements not elsewhere attested

djusnu/jusnu ‘just now’

< Engl. just now

Sch2

kukru

‘kitchen/oven’

< Engl. cook room

Sch

paman

‘payment’

< Engl. payment

VD

kakoebén

‘chin’

< Dutch kaakbeen

Fo

kneiptang

‘pincers/nippers’ < Dutch knjiptang

All Early Sranan words in (3) are phonologically adapted borrowings of English and Dutch complex words or phrases which undoubtedly have an internal structure in the donor languages. However, whether any internal structure can be claimed for their Early Sranan correspondences is a vexed issue. The way I have defined the notion of complex word above presupposes that at least one of the potential morphemes in these words must have a clearly identifiable form and meaning. If we divide the words in (3) into hypothetical morphemes djus and nu, kuk and ru, pa and man etc., we have a hard time identifying their meaning from the synchronic, and not etymological perspective. In some cases there is an accidental phonological relation between the hypothetical ‘morphemes’ in (3) and

1 Most examples cited in this section are taken from Schumann (1783). Observations made here can be extended to the data from Van Dyk (c1765) and Focke (1855). 2 Hereafter, for reasons of space I use contractions to refer to the three major sources of data used for the present investigation: VD for Van Dyk (c1765), Sch for Schumann (1783) and Fo for Focke (1855).

free morphemes attested in Sranan, as e.g. in the case of man which is a noun meaning ‘man’. However, no semantic or etymological relation between the two can be established, and thus the problem of identifying the meaning of the element man in paman remains unsolved. In view of these facts we must raise the question of whether etymologically complex entities should be regarded as morphologically complex too. Plag (2003c: 25) notes in this connection that morphology should not be confused with etymology, and that morphemes having a certain meaning in a diachronic perspective, may not have it in a synchronic perspective as well. This is exactly the case with the examples from (3). Though they can be viewed as derived from complex entities, they are monomorphemic in Early Sranan because neither of their parts can be identified as a unit of form and meaning. Examples in (3) show that in creolisation, complex entities of the input languages may enter the emerging creole without morphological decomposition and undergo a radical reconstruction of their initial internal structure. Words of the type in (3) will not be included into the scope of investigation in the present work.
The second group consists of words where two elements can be hypothesised via comparison with other Early Sranan words where one of these elements is attested as well. Such ‘via parallels’ attested elements are set in bold.

(4) bambei
tamarra boltri

‘Wait! Be Patient!’ < Engl. by and by also: klossibei <Engl. close by

‘tomorrow’

< Engl. tomorrow also: gumarra<Engl. good morrow

‘tree of special kind’ < Engl. bully tree also: kattantri<Engl. cotton tree

The examples in (4) are phonologically adapted borrowings from complex units of the source language English. In contrast to the forms in (3), one of their hypothetical constituents is attested in another Early Sranan word and has a phonological and etymological relation to it. Interestingly, in the process of borrowing of English complex entities containing the same morpheme (such as bully tree and cotton tree) this English morpheme (e.g. tree) ended up as the same phonological sequence in different Early Sranan words, but not as a free morpheme. It is again unclear what meaning must be associated with these hypothetical elements: though it can be figured out etymologically, it is not identifiable from the synchronic point of view. And since the meaning of the second hypothetical element is also unclear, these words must be regarded as

75

containing two elements without an identifiable meaning, which makes them simplex according to our definition of ‘complex word’. Note also that nontransparent meanings of the hypothetical elements in (4) render the words they occur in opaque, which might be taken as another indication of their simplicity since, as psycholinguistic investigations show, non-transparent forms might be treated as simplex in the mental lexicon (McQueen and Cutler 1998).
The third group of words relevant here is presented in (5). Elements not elsewhere attested are set in bold.

(5) hurukuku/wurukuku
kumsakka sirrisirra

‘owl’

?huru (V)3

‘damp festering itching on the feet’ ?sakka (N/V)

‘crayfish’

?sirri (N)

‘to whore’
‘sack/to lower’ ‘seed’

The words in (5) might seem complex at first sight since at least one of their elements is attested independently. Upon closer inspection, however, the relation between the independently attested element and the one occurring as a part of entities in (5) is not always straightforward. Thus, it is not plausible that the meaning of huru in hurukuku is related to the verb huru ‘to whore’, and the same is true about the remaining examples. This allows an assumption that the relation between the free forms and those attested as a part of words in (5) is clearly phonological, but semantically or etymologically it cannot always be determined. Consequently, the forms in (5) should be regarded as consisting of two elements with no clearly identifiable meaning, and thus, as semantically opaque. Therefore they will be regarded as simplex and not treated in the present study.
Finally, there are words in Early Sranan, that contain a bound element (either attested as a part of another Early Sranan word or not attested at all), and an element that is a morpheme with a clearly identifiable form and meaning attested independently in Early Sranan:

(6) guneti
mammantem

‘good night’ ‘morning’

< Engl. good night, also in gumarra neti (N)

< Engl. good morrow

< Engl. morning time

tem (N)

‘night’ ‘time’

3 In (5) the question mark (?) before a base means that this base and the element of a complex word have the same phonological form, but seem to have no semantic relation with each other.
76

The meaning of the first elements in the examples in (6) can be established etymologically, but not synchronically. However, the second elements can be assigned a meaning uncontroversially. Therefore, according to our definition of ‘complex word’, words of the type in (6) must be regarded as morphologically complex and will be examined in the present work. Remarkably, words in (6) show one possible way by which borrowings from the source languages may enter a creole language: the borrowings can be partially reanalysed, thus rendering one of the elements non-transparent in a creole language.
In general, the foregoing allows several remarks on what can be regarded as complex in a creole language. As the discussion above shows, the idea of complexity in a creole language can be construed as similar to the complexity in non-creole languages. Thus, the notion of ‘morpheme’ in Early Sranan can be defined in the same way it was defined in general above. I have also shown that an etymological approach is problematic and that the notion of ‘complex word’ developed above can be used for identifying complex words in Early Sranan as well. Both definitions provide a clear basis for dealing with complex borrowings from input languages. The discussion also demonstrates that morphological complexity in creoles must not and should not be treated from the point of view of the source languages since much of the information from them is of etymological, and not of morphological interest. In this respect a parallel to the state of affairs in non-creole languages might be insightful. Thus, foreign complex words have also entered English in the course of time. The Russian samovar, for instance, which is a compound in Russian (created from the words sam ‘self’ and varit’ ‘to cook’, entered English without morphological decomposition and became a simplex word in English. This suggests that complexity or non-complexity of a particular (borrowed) item is measured from the perspective of the language into which it is borrowed and depends on the fact whether this item contains morphemes whose meaning is identifiable from the point of view of the borrowing language, and not from the perspective of the language from which a complex form has been borrowed that is rather the realm of etymological research. Thus, in non-creole languages complex entities can be borrowed in the same way as in Early Sranan: with and without morphological decomposition. The criteria for measuring complexity can thus be uniform and largely depend on the notion of morpheme.

5.2.4. Regarding complex words in terms of processes: puzzles from Early Sranan

It has been mentioned in the previous section that complex words can be produced by a variety of processes: affixation, compounding, conversion, truncation, blending etc. Three of these processes: affixation, compounding and conversion are employed in Early Sranan word-formation. This places us in front of the next set of issues that should be addressed in the present study. First, distinctions traditionally made between affixation and compounding and between compounds and phrases are often a matter of controversy in linguistics in general and it has been pointed out (Dijkhoff 1993: 109) that e.g. morphology-syntax distinction can be blurred in creolisation. I will demonstrate that drawing the borderlines in question is not unproblematic in Early Sranan.
Thus, some morphemes in Early Sranan seem to display properties that make it difficult to classify such morphemes straightforwardly as affixes or bases since such a classification would distort interesting facts about the nature of Early Sranan word-formation. The Early Sranan morpheme uman4 (< Engl. woman), for instance, exhibits a semantically consistent pattern where it can be argued to serve as a female gender marker:

(7) uman-doksi/uman doksi
uman-futuboi umankau/uman kau umanpikin/uman pikin umanplesi

‘female-duck’ ‘female-servant’ ‘female-cattle/cow’ ‘female-child’ ‘female-place’

‘duck’ ‘maid’ ‘cow’ ‘daughter’ ‘female genitals’

This pattern can be argued to be similar to affixation patterns in some other languages, consider the English feminine suffix -ess:

(8) waitress
lioness hostess actress manageress

4 The orthographic variant provided here is taken from Schumann (1783: 190) since the examples provided for demonstrating the point I am making here are taken from Schumann.
78

However, the problem with the Early Sranan uman is that it is attested as a free morpheme meaning ‘woman’, in contrast to the English -ess which is definitely a bound morpheme. Now, the puzzle is: how to treat the morpheme uman in Early Sranan? One approach might be to regard the formations in (7) as compounds. However, doing this, we somewhat distort the word-formation arsenal of Early Sranan: by disregarding the combinations with uman under a separate pattern, we will miss an important fact that uman can be used in Early Sranan in the similar way derivational feminine markers are used in other languages. By denying a specific pattern with uman and by considering it, for instance, under NN compounds/concatenations, we must admit that Sranan has no word-formation means for denoting female gender, which would be an inadequate description. However, by proclaiming that uman is a derivational gender marker, we would run into a number of problems, the main of them being that uman also occurs as a free morpheme. This raises the problem of treating an affixation-compounding borderline in Early Sranan in an adequate way. To do this, it is necessary to address the issue of how this borderline has been treated from the theoretical and empirical point of view in linguistics in general, and whether this treatment can be applied to the data I work with in the present work.
The second problem arises on a different borderline, that between compounding and syntax. Consider the following examples taken from Schumann (1783):

(9) a. b.

hufasi/hufa hupeh husanni husomma hutem hu biggi hudeh hu-hosso hu klossi

‘which-manner/kind’ ‘which-place’ ‘which-thing’ ‘which-person’ ‘which-time’ ‘which-big’ ‘which-day’ ‘which-house’ ‘which-clothes’

‘how?/how’ ‘where?/where from?/where to? ‘what?’ ‘who?/which one (person)?’ ‘when?/at what time?’ ‘how big?’ ‘(on) which day?’ ‘which house?’ ‘which clothes?’

The examples in (9a) and (9b) are produced by the same structural pattern: [hu-N/A], and they consistently have an interrogative meaning rendered by the morpheme hu (< Engl. which, according to Muysken and Smith 1990: 896-897). At first sight, one might argue that combinations in (9) are syntactic constructions. Upon closer inspection, however, the words in (9a) seem to display a slightly
79

different meaning, the one which might be viewed as lexicalised. In addition, their second elements can be reduced. However, these are the only clues we can use to establish the difference because information on stress or syntactic atomicity which are usually regarded as major criteria of morphological status in languages like English (see the discussion of such criteria below), can be applied to the early data we are dealing with here only to a limited degree. The question that emerges then is how to analyse such constructions if several important clues are missing, and in more general terms, how to distinguish between word-formation and syntax in Early Sranan. To answer this question, I will discuss the traditional criteria and theoretical assumptions on morphology-syntax distinction.
Besides affixation and compounding, reduplication is another important process of coining complex words in Early Sranan. Since reduplicated words can be regarded as either products of affixation or of compounding (see Bauer 1988: 25-26; Katamba 1993: 180-197; Spencer 1991: 150-156), and are the result of an interaction between morphology and phonology (Raimy 2000), the issue of treating reduplications in Early Sranan will also be addressed below.
Finally, multifunctionality of Early Sranan lexemes is another contentious issue that will receive consideration and analysis in the present study. Consider the case of the Early Sranan morpheme bun: it can be a verb meaning ‘to be good’, an adjective ‘good’, an adverb ‘well’, and a noun ‘luck/goodness’. Such multifunctional items are rather common in Early Sranan and raise the question of how such cases can be accounted for. Since several theoretical constructs have been designed to deal with this issue (Plag 2003c: 107-116; Vogel 1996), and since it is unclear whether multifunctionality in Early Sranan is a morphological process or a property of lexemes, I will devote a separate chapter to an analysis of multifunctionality in Early Sranan.
Truncation and blending are employed very marginally in the concatenation of Early Sranan complex words. Therefore, they will not receive a special treatment in the present study.
In general, it seems that the challenge in the case of the analysis of Early Sranan word-formation lies in finding an adequate way of describing all relevant phenomena and processes without getting lost in controversies. Therefore, in the sections to follow, the issue of distinguishing affixation and compounding, as well as compounding and syntax will be addressed in general. I will discuss a number
80

of theoretical positions and criteria developed for drawing the borderlines in question in order to investigate their relevance and usability for the Early Sranan data. This will allow us to elaborate a suitable framework for the study of Early Sranan word-formation.
5.3. Affixation and compounding: Establishing the borderline
5.3.1. Defining affixation and compounding
Affixation is usually regarded as the process of attaching affixes, such as suffixes, prefixes or infixes to a base5 (Bauer 1983: 18; Katamba 1993: 44-45). According to Katamba, an affix is a bound morpheme which occurs only with other morphemes, such as a root or stem or base (Katamba 1993: 44). Since we deal with the process of creating new words here, only derivational affixes are of relevance for the present study.
For the term ‘compound’, several distinct definitions have been proposed. A number of definitions try to explain the notion of compound though the notion of word. Thus, Fabb (1998: 66) regards a compound as “a word which consists of two or more words.” There are two problems with this definition. First, there are compounds whose elements can hardly be called words, as e.g. the neo-classical compounds electrophile and biocrat where the combining forms -phile and biodo not occur on their own, and thus can hardly be regarded as words, and compounds with the so-called cranberry or unique morphemes like cranberry and warmonger where the elements cran- and -monger are a real challenge for those who want to assign a word status to them. According to Fabb’s definition the words electrophile, biocrat, cranberry, and warmonger are not compounds. However, it would be equally problematic to regard words containing cranberry morphemes and neo-classical compounds as derivatives produced by affixation
5 Hereafter I follow Bauer’s definitions of the three terms: base, root and stem. Base is “any form to which affixes of any kind can be added,” root is the further unanalysable form, and stem is “the part of word form which remains when all inflectional affixes are removed” (Bauer 1983: 20-21).
81

(Adams 1973: 31-32; Bauer 1983: 213-214). On the one hand, there are complex words that consist of units larger than words, e.g. pipe-and-slipper husband (example taken from Plag (2003c: 134)), where the first element is a phrase. Such words are also not compounds, according to Fabb’s definition. The second problem with Fabb’s definition lies in the fact that the definition of word is highly problematic, be it an orthographic, phonological, semantic or grammatical one (see Packard 2000: 7-14 and Singleton 1999: 10-14 for discussion). Katamba (1993: 291) provides a somewhat similar definition where a prototypical compound is viewed as “...a word made up of at least two bases which can occur elsewhere as independent words...”. However, Katamba (1993: 292) also makes a note that the possibility of occurring as independent words is not a pre-requisite that all bases in compounds must satisfy because some compounds are built of morphemes which do not occur in isolation, e.g. neo-classical compounds. This remark is very important since it allows to treat the cases of neo-classical compounding and also words containing cranberry morphs as compounds.
Another group of definitions include those where the notion of compound is defined through the notions of a root, a base or a stem. Thus, CarstairsMcCarthy (2002: 59) defines compounds as words formed by combining roots. This definition has one undeniable advantage in comparison to the definitions regarded above: it allows to treat complex words with cranberry morphs and neoclassical compounds like electrophile as compounds since one might argue that the components of these words are further unanalysable forms. Note also that this definition also avoids problems with complex constructs of the kind Wohnzimmer (< wohnen (V) ‘to live’ and Zimmer (N) ‘room’) in German where the first element wohn- is a root, but does not occur as an independent word in this form. However, this definition raises problems with the forms of the kind cycle-friendly (e.g. “6,500 cycle-friendly miles”, example taken from Adams 2001: 96) where the element friendly is definitely not a root, i.e. a further unanalysable form, but a base. One might argue that the formation cycle-friendly is not a compound, but a derivative, but such an approach would create problems with the derivational base cycle-friend which does not exist. Note also German compounds of the kind Tonnenleger where the separate constituents of the whole word are both complex, i.e. they are not roots. It means that it might be more promising to define compounds as constructs containing two or more bases or stems. Thus, Bauer
82

(1983: 29) defines compound as “a lexeme containing two or more potential stems that has not subsequently been subjected to a derivational process”. According to this definition, such words as schoolmasterish and superhighway cannot be regarded as compounds because they have derivational affixes within their structure. Other linguists, however, do regard the forms which have been subjected to a derivational process as compounds and call (at least a part of) them ‘synthetic compounds’ (see the discussion in Spencer 1991: 324-343). To avoid this new problem we might look at Haspelmath’s (2002: 267) definition where a compound is regarded as “a complex lexeme that is made up of more than one other lexeme stem.” However, such a definition, although it avoids the undesirable notion of word or even the notion of root, creates a problem with forms like drugs courier where the first component is not a stem since it has an inflection -s.
Thus, it seems that the definitions discussed above bear certain problems and the notion of compound is not quite clear-cut. The major problem with the definitions lies in their restrictive nature: they try to underpin the components of compounds to a certain (one) type of morphological formatives. The discussion clearly shows that this is a difficult undertaking since components of compounds seem to embrace the whole range of morpheme types, such as bound roots, roots, stems, words and even phrases. Therefore a broader definition like the one suggested in Plag (2003c: 135) would probably yield a better idea of compounding for languages like English: “a compound is a word that consists of two elements, the first of which is either a stem, or a word, or a phrase, the second of which is either a stem or a word.”
The foregoing allows several concluding remarks on the nature of affixation and compounding. Thus, they share some similarities: both of them are processes by which complex words can be created and both of them involve concatenation of morphological elements. Also, both of them can involve morphemes that share some properties, such as boundness, which is a feature of affixes employed by affixation and bound roots employed by compounding. However, in most descriptive works on word-formation affixation and compounding are treated as separate processes, and their separation is done on a number of criteria that are mainly based on the presumably different properties of morphemes involved in the two processes. In morphological theory, positions on
83

this issue go chiefly in two different directions: those that conceptualise affixes as different from other types of morphemes and thus assume a crucial difference between affixation and compounding, and those that model affixes and elements of compounds as similar items, and argue that affixation and compounding are governed by the same set of grammatical principles. Since the analysis of affixation and compounding is of crucial importance in the present study, I will first discuss some general criteria advanced for distinguishing the two processes and the types of morphemes involved in them. I will then provide an overview of how affixation and compounding are conceptualised, and of how affixes are treated within some theories of word-formation.
5.3.2. General criteria for establishing the border between affixes and elements of compounds
A number of general criteria for distinguishing affixes from other types of morphemes have been suggested or discussed in numerous works on morphology (Adams 2001; Bauer 1983; Dalton-Puffer and Plag 2001; Fleischer and Barz 1992; Hansen and Hartmann 1991; Haspelmath 2002; Kastovsky 1982; Marchand 1969; Rainer 1993; Ten Hacken 1994). To find out whether the difference between affixation and compounding can be established on the basis of such criteria, I will provide a brief discussion of these criteria using examples from English and German.
5.3.2.1. Phonological Criteria
One of the phonological criteria often used to differentiate between affixes and bases is that of vowel reduction and loss of stress. Affixes tend to be more phonologically fused with the base and are said to have the reduced form and to receive either weak stress or no stress at all, as e.g. the English suffix -ful in dreadful, pitiful is pronounced /fl/ or /f´l/ (examples taken from Adams 1973: 30). In English compounds one element usually receives the primary stress, whereas 84

the other element bears secondary stress, as in wátchmàker, súnrìse, stéambòat (Marchand 1969: 20-30). This criterion is, however, rather problematic for distinguishing between elements of compounds and affixes, at least for the language like English. Thus, phonological integration is not uniform among affixes: vowel-initial suffixes in English seem to be more integrated into the phonological word, whereas most consonant-initial are not (Raffelsiefen 1999). Moreover, there are compounds whose components do undergo vowel reduction, as e.g. land in highland: [halnd] or berry in strawberry: [strbr] (cf. Allen 1980: 15-16). In English, many prefixes are considered to take secondary stress (Marchand 1969: 137-138). Besides, there are some suffixes in English that receive primary stress: e.g. -ee, -eer and -ette in the words trai´nee, refu´gee, nomi´nee; mountai´neer; engi´neer; kitche´nette, dine´rette. Moreover, there are compounds in English which deviate from the common stress pattern in that their final elements are reduced, as e.g. mádman, blúeberry, Scótland etc. (see Bauer 1983; Kastovsky 1982; Marchand 1969 for discussion). Note also that the fact whether a base is reduced and unstressed seems to be (at least partially) dependent on its position in a complex word: thus, the base man is stressed and has the full form in the initial position, e.g. manservant [mænsvnt]. The same base may be unstressed and reduced in the final position, e.g. brushman [brmn]. This points to the fact that unstressed and reduced form is not a consequence of the morphological status of a given morpheme, but rather a result of its position in a complex word. It means that though the property ‘reduced and unstressed form’ might be characteristic of some affixes, it is not an exclusive property of all affixes. This diminishes the value of the criterion in question for distinguishing between derivation and compounding. It means that in phonological terms, there is rather a cline than a dichotomy between affixes and elements of compounds.
However, there are cases where phonological evidence may become a crucial clue to the morphological status of a given morpheme. Thus, in one of the West African languages, Fongbe, the substratum language of Early Sranan, many affixes are often semantically related to free morphemes, and it is often the phonological properties of an affix that allow us to distinguish it from the homographous lexeme (cf. Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 185-195). Thus, e.g. the Fongbe diminutive suffix ví is semantically related to the noun ví meaning ‘child’.
85

However, in contrast to noun, the affix undergoes the phonological processes of nasalisation and rounding.
Unfortunately, phonological criteria, such as loss of stress, vowel reduction or tonal distinctions can hardly be applied to the data from Early Sranan because the information about stress patterns and pronunciation of complex words is either inconsistent or not available at all in the two main sources, Van Dyk and Schumann so that it is impossible to make reliable judgments about the reduction of the vowel and loss of stress in those morphemes that seem to be potential affixes. The third main source, Focke, contains information about stress patterns of almost all words. However, this information sometimes seems to be contradictory: thus, for example, three different patterns can be traced in the complex words with the element -man which displays an affix-like behaviour: there are examples where this element is unstressed, e.g. báiman (buy-PM) ‘buyer’; there are examples where this element is stressed, e.g. ferfimán (paintPM) ‘(house) painter’, there are examples where both the root to which the element -man is attached and the element -man itself are stressed: bótomán ‘oarsman’, and there are examples where the element -man has accent grave, which according to Focke (1855: xiii) is used to indicate the stress on the “final sound” and to express the shortness of this sound: djârimàn (garden-PM) ‘gardener’. Moreover, there are examples where one and the same word containing man displays different stress patterns: bótomán/boto-mán ‘oarsman’; djârimàn/djarimán ‘gardener’; tóriman/torimán ‘telltale’. The contradictions in the phonological information in the data from Focke make it hardly possible to apply the criterion in question reliably. Moreover, the criterion cannot be applied to our data also because it is the data from Early Sranan and we cannot, for instance, use informants to get the information which is missing.
5.3.2.2. Morphological and Syntactic Criteria
Boundness, serialness and selectivity are often mentioned as crucial for assigning the affixal status to a given morpheme (cf. Rainer 1993: 64-69).
The criterion of boundness is probably the most important one for the status ‘affix’. As it has been shown in the definitions above, affixes are considered
86

to be bound morphemes, whereas elements in compounds are usually free. However, as it has already been mentioned above, parts of compounds may also be bound, e.g. unique morphemes cran- and bel- in cranberry and belberry and combining forms bio- and -crat in the neo-classical compound biocrat (see Bauer 1983: 37-39 for discussion). This makes Wolff (1984: 86) argue that “while all affixes are bound forms, it would be grossly oversimplifying to equate bound forms with affixes”. Moreover, the answer to the question of whether a given morpheme is bound or free is not always straightforward since there are cases where one and the same element occurs freely and as an element in many complex words. It has been suggested (e.g. Erben 1975; Marchand 1969: 356-358; Stepanowa and Fleisher 1985: 141-143) that morphemes of this kind belong to a separate class called ‘semi-affixes’ or ‘affixoids’ since they occupy a position on the borderline between affixes and free bases. However, as Plag (2003c: 73) argues, in such cases two morphemes usually differ in their properties: thus, in the case of the element -wise which can occur on its own meaning ‘clever’ and in a number of complex words, e.g. education-wise, the independently occurring morpheme is an adjective, whereas the one occurring as part of complex words creates adverbs. Thus, as Plag assumes, we are dealing with two homonymous morphemes, an affix and a free base. Therefore there is no need to assume an additional category of an affixoid which is theoretically undesirable (see also Dalton-Puffer and Plag 2001). In general, as the discussion above shows, boundness is a property of all affixes, but it is not restricted to affixes only. It means then that the criterion of boundness can be used successfully in distinguishing between affixes and free bases, but not between affixes and other types of morphemes possible in a language. It follows then that there is no strict boundary between affixes and elements of compounds in terms of boundness, but rather a cline.
In Early Sranan such cases are abundant and the decision is not always easy. Thus, e.g. the morpheme sanni occurs independently and has the meaning ‘something/thing’ (Schumann 1783: 149-150). At the same time it occurs as an element in a number of complex words, e.g. leisanni ‘lie’ (< lei (V) ‘to lie’), korisanni ‘deceit’ (< kori (V) ‘to deceive’), prefurusanni ‘prank/tomfoolery’ (< prefuru (V) ‘to play fool’). It might be argued on the basis of these examples that -sanni is a nominalising suffix since it combines with verbal bases with a
87

certain semantic consistency to produce abstract nouns. On the other hand, one can also argue that the examples just mentioned are compounds and hence that the element sanni is a free base in them since the meaning of the lexeme sanni ‘something/thing’ is still discernible in them: korisanni can be paraphrased as ‘deceitful things’ or ‘something which is deceitful’; leisanni can be paraphrased as ‘something which is lie’, and prefurusanni as ‘something by which one is being fooled’. All this makes a decision about sanni being a suffix or a free base more difficult than it is the case with the English -wise: we do not have large amounts of data from native speakers of Early Sranan in all the three sources of data and we cannot test the case with a group of informants to give our decision more reliability. This raises the question of how such cases should be treated.
Another commonly used criterion is the criterion of a fixed position to the base. As Scalise (1984) notes, an affix cannot be a prefix in some words and a suffix in others. In other words, affixes are considered to have a fixed position to the base: they either occur in the pre-position to it (prefixes) or in the postposition to it (suffixes), or are inserted into it (infixes): the German suffix -chen: Kindchen, Liedchen, Bäumchen; the English prefix sub-: subconscious, subnormal. This property is important in the discussion about the status of combining forms where it is used to show that the forms philo- and -phile, which are synonymous, can hardly be analysed as affixes since they occur both pre- and postpositionally to the base (Ten Hacken 1994: 27). Fixed position to a base might be a good indication of an affixal status, since there are really no instances in English where a certain affix would be able to change its position in respect to a base. However, bound roots also seem to have a fixed position: the German bound root Schwieger- occurs only in preposition to the base: Schwiegermutter, Schwiegervater, Schwiegersohn etc. It might be argued therefore that probably fixed position to the base is a characteristic which goes hand in hand with the property of boundness, and consequently with the status of affix. In comparison to affixes and bound roots, free components of compounds seem to be able to vary their position: cold war vs. war crime or time-scale vs. dinner time. However, the issue of flexibility of elements of compounds seems to be hardly investigated, therefore it is arguable in how far the elements of compounds are indeed flexible as to their position.
88

One must be cautious while applying this criterion to the data from Early Sranan. Thus, there is a morpheme -man that, as it will be shown later, is a person marker and attaches postpositionally to nominal, adjectival and verbal bases: sussuman (shoe-PM) ‘shoemaker’, hondiman (hunt-PM) ‘hunter’. There is also a morpheme man(n)- which is a natural gender marker and attaches prepositionally to nominal bases: man-doksi (GM-duck) ‘drake’, man-Ningre (GM-black person) ‘male Black’. There is also the free lexeme man(n) meaning “man, a male person, husband, everything of male gender” (Schumann 1783: 107). A careful analysis shows that the two morphemes have different meanings: the morpheme -man has the meaning ‘person’, and the morpheme man(n)- ‘male’, and, as we have seen above, they have different functions. However, the fact alone that the one of them occurs only postpositionally and the other one only prepositionally does not allow us to decide about their affixal or non-affixal status. It may well be that the morpheme man(n)-, despite its fixed position to the base, is not an affix since its meaning is very close to the meaning of the lexeme man(n).
Serialness is another criterion used to differentiate between affixes and free morphemes. Affixes are said to combine with words “on a serial basis with semantic consistency” (Fleisher and Barz 1995: 28; Kintzel 1984: 46). Affixes can normally be attached to quite a number of elements of that word-class for which they are subcategorised. Thus, e.g. the English adjectival suffix -less occurs serially with common nouns, e.g. fieldless, breathless, spotless, pennyless etc. (Bauer 1983: 224; Koziol 1972: 200). This criterion, however, is not at all unproblematic. Thus, there are elements of compounds that occur serially. The English element -man, for instance, occurs serially in a great number of compounds, such as herdsman, postman, chairman, workman, but it is a matter of dispute whether -man should be treated as an affix or a base (Bauer 1983: 36-37; Marchand 1969: 60-61; 64; 66-67). The same is true about the element -type in the following compounds: question-type, skin-type, text-type, trial-type etc. (see Dalton-Puffer and Plag 2001 for discussion). Fleischer and Barz (1995: 29) regard the German bases -arm (fettarm, knitterarm, lichtarm), -voll (ausdrucksvoll, grauenvoll), -reich (gewürzreich, fischreich) as serial. In general it is not clear on what basis, quantitative or other, affixes can be viewed as serial. And what number of derivatives in which a certain affix occurs is necessary to call it serial: five, ten or more? However, this aspect is hardly discussed in works on word-
89

formation (see Hansen and Hartmann 1991: 68-70 for an overview). In conclusion, there is no clear borderline between affixes and elements of compounds in terms of serialness.
The criterion of serialness is also not unproblematic for Early Sranan as well: the data sources are early dictionaries, and therefore only a limited set of data can be used for the analysis. These data, for instance, may not contain all complex words that were actually in use in Early Sranan, and since we cannot search for additional information, the decision whether a given morpheme is serial or not becomes problematic. Thus, for instance, Schumann contains 67 words (types) with the element -man (< Engl. man) in final position, and 12 words (types) with the element man(n)- (< Engl. man) in the initial position. One might argue that the final -man is a serial morpheme since there are quite a number of words that contain this element. In comparison to the final -man the initial man(n)- may be viewed as non-serial since there are much fewer words that contain this element. However, one might also argue that both are serial and that it is rather by chance that much fewer words with the initial man(n)- were included into the dictionary by the author. And thus this fact does not reflect the real number of complex words in Early Sranan built by means of attaching the initial man(n)-.
The ability to change word class is another criterion used to draw the border between affixes and bases. Some affixes may change the syntactic category of the base they are attached to. Thus, e.g. the English suffix -ness is attached primarily (though not exclusively) to adjectives to produce abstract nouns, as kindness, selfishness, usefulness, happiness etc. (Bauer 1983: 222; Quirk et al. 1985: 1551). This criterion, however, should be treated with caution. Affixes may determine the word-class affiliation and other characteristics (both grammatical and semantic) of the derivatives they occur in not necessarily because it is an inherent property of affixes to do so, but because they often serve as heads in affixal derivatives. In compounds, however, the word-class affiliation and other characteristics of a compound are also determined by the head. Thus, e.g. in the German compound Butterbrot the second element is the head from which the following features are percolated to the whole compound: [+noun; –masc; –fem; –animate]. Moreover, there are affixes that do not change the syntactic category of the base, e.g. the English suffixes -ish and -dom in greyish and kingdom. The
90

situation is even more controversial with prefixes which are often (at least in English and German) not category-changing. In conclusion, the affixal status does not go hand in hand with a change in syntactic category which considerably diminishes the role of this criterion in drawing the border between derivation and compounding.
Selectiveness is viewed as another criterion to draw the borderline. Affixes often impose requirements of the phonological, morphological, semantic, syntactic and pragmatic nature on the shape of their bases, i.e. they are selective in respect to their bases6. It is widely assumed that certain affixes attach to bases of a certain syntactic category, i.e. they are usually subcategorised for a certain syntactic category or a subcategory of a certain category. This property of affixes is formulated in the unitary base hypothesis (UBH) by Aronoff (1976). Thus, e.g. the German suffix -bar cannot be attached to durative intransitive or reflexive verbs (Fleisher and Barz 1995: 28), and the English -ship attaches to predominantly to nouns: clerkship, friendship, courtship. The English deverbal negative prefix un- imposes semantic restrictions on its possible bases: it attaches to those bases whose meaning allows reversative or privative transformation, e.g. undo, untie. Barker (1998) shows that semantic factors constrain the use of the suffix -ee. But even selectivity does not seem to be restricted to affixes only. Thus, according to Hansen and Hartmann (1991: 69), the German bound roots Stief- and Schwieger- are selective: they combine only with those nouns which denote family relations, e.g. Stiefmutter, Stiefvater, Stiefsohn, Stieftochter; Schwiegermutter, Schwiegervater, Schwiegersohn, Schwiegertochter. It has also been suggested (Giegerich 1999; Plag 1998) that in a number of cases the incapability of a certain affix to attach to a certain base results rather from the properties of the base, and not from the properties of the affix. Thus, e.g. Plag (1998) shows that the fact that the English verbal derivatives in -ify, -ise and -ate all take the nominalising suffix -ation, and not one of the nominalising suffixes -age, -al, -ance, -ment and -y can be explained by the shape of the base of these verbal derivatives, especially by the occurrence of the verbal suffix in these bases,
6 It has been shown in some recent investigations on the constraints operating in affixation processes that semantic rather than syntactic analyses can provide better accounts of the nature of restrictions derivational affixes display (Plag 2004; Barker 1998). I will come back to this point in course of analysis of complex words in Early Sranan.
91

and not by selectional restrictions associated with the suffixes -age, -al, -ance, -ment and -y. It means that bases can also be selective in the context of affixation. The case of unique morphs might also be interesting in this respect: thus, the morpheme cran- attaches to the morpheme berry only. Can this then be regarded as an indication of cran’s selectiveness?
There are even greater problems with the notion of selectiveness itself since it is unclear what really allows us to call a given morpheme selective. Thus, if we compare the English suffix -er which attaches to bases of different lexical categories: verbs (mixer), nouns (sealer), numerals (fiver), and the English base wheel which attaches to nouns (water-wheel), adjectives (free-wheel) and verbs (dash-wheel), the question arises: Can we call the suffix -er selective and the base wheel not? There is no denying the fact that many affixes (e.g. -ee, -ery, -ism, -able etc. see Plag (2003c) for a discussion of individual affixes) attach to the bases of more than one lexical category and that for some affixes no specific semantic restrictions can be postulated (e.g. -er which attaches to a wide range of different bases). On the other hand, if we regard an inventory of compounds in English, we must assume that not every combination of two bases is available, as e.g. *snowy-sharp or *to walk-go, which is motivated, as I would suppose, by factors chiefly semantic or pragmatic in nature. This again indicates that bases might be selecting in the context of compounding, and not only in the context of affixation, but since the number of compounds in such a language as English is rather large, it is probably difficult to postulate combinatorial restrictions for each base. What might be hypothesised then is that affixes probably display greater and more specific restrictions than bases do so that selectivity might be regarded first, as a gradual notion, and second, as a property of individual morphemes, and not a general property of only one type of morphemes. It follows then that selectivity should be described not as a criterion for distinguishing between affixation and compounding, but as a property any morpheme may or may not have, in a greater or lesser degree.
The final criterion is that of productivity and regularity of affixes. Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 186) argue that affixed words tend to exhibit properties of productivity and regularity: the meaning of a productively derived word is predictable from the meaning of its affix whereas the meaning of a compound cannot always be derived from its compositional meaning since several
92

relations are possible between the two constituents of a compound. However, some affixes may exhibit different meanings, being polysemous as e.g. according to Plag (2003c: 93), the English verbal suffix -ise displays the range of some 7 meanings, such as locative, ornative, causative, resultative, inchoative, performative, similative. This again, renders this criterion as problematic.
5.3.2.3. Semantic criteria
One of the semantic criteria used to hold affixes and bases apart is that of abstractness and generalness of meaning of affixes. An affix is sometimes defined as a morpheme with an abstract meaning (e.g. Fleisher und Barz 1995: 28; Haspelmath 2002:18). Marchand (1969: 215) remarks that suffixes do not have any meaning on themselves, but acquire it only in combination with a free morpheme. This criterion is usually applied to cases when a free morpheme and an affix are homonyms (Fleischer and Barz 1995: 27; Hansen and Hartmann 1991: 74). If an affix and an element of a compound are homonyms then the meaning of the affix differs from the meaning of the homonymic element in a compound: it is usually more abstract and more general than the meaning of the corresponding free morphemes. Thus, e.g. the meaning of the German word Haupt (‘head/chief’) in the phrase der Haupt einer Bande is ‘Anführer einer Bande’ (‘the head of a gang’) and it differs from the meaning of the element Haupt- in the complex word Hauptangeklagte, which is ‘der wichtigste Angeklagte’ (‘the chief defendant’). In the second case the element Haupt- has a more general meaning and should thus be regarded as a prefix (see Hansen and Hartmann 1991: 74 for the discussion of such cases). There are, however, no clear criteria of defining the degree of difference of meaning between affixes and the elements of compounds which are their homonyms (see Hansen and Hartmann 1991: 40-41 for discussion).
The issue of whether affixes have more general and more abstract meanings than roots do seems to be rather controversial. Thus, Beard (1995) argues that the meanings encoded in affixes (derivational, inflectional and zero) are limited and similar across languages and they often can be paraphrased by very general words like ACTION, AGENT, EVENT, STATE, QUALITY.
93

Mithun (1996) challenges this view by showing that in many languages of North America, affixes express meanings that are expressed by nouns and verbs in IndoEuropean languages. Indeed, if we compare the meaning of the suffix -(e)ry in the derivatives bakery, pottery, and fishery, which is ‘place where a specific activity is carried out,’ with the meaning of the base place in the compounds meeting place, show-place or burial place it is difficult to say which of the two: the suffix -(e)ry or the base place has a more general meaning. On the other hand there is no denying the fact that some affixes really have a rather general or abstract meaning, e.g. the English suffix -hood has the meaning ‘state of’ in many of its derivatives: victimhood, farmerhood, bachelorhood, etc. But these facts again indicate that there is no clear border between affixes and elements of compounds in respect to the generalness of meaning: both bases and affixes may be general and specific.
5.3.3. Criteria for the affixation-compounding distinction: a summary
What conclusion about the distinction between affixation and compounding can we draw on the basis of the discussion above? The general picture that emerges is shown in Table 1:

Two assumptions can be made on the basis of Table 1. First, we might suppose that there must be something wrong about the criteria in question since as we have seen above there are counterexamples to each criterion. The second assumption is that there must be something wrong with the distinction between affixes and elements of compounds since we have seen that the discussion of each criterion does not show a clear border between the two.
Turning to the first assumption, we can state that considerations presented until now allow us to distinguish between three groups of criteria. The first group includes the criterion of the unstressed and reduced form and the criterion of syntactic category change. These criteria are based on the properties of

95

morphemes which do not result from their morphological status, but rather from their position in a complex word. It is therefore questionable if the criteria based on these properties can reliably show the difference between affixes and elements of compounds.
The second group includes the criteria of selectiveness, serialness and generalness of meaning. These criteria are problematic in the sense that they are difficult to define. For instance, it is often unclear when a morpheme should be considered serial or selecting or when the meaning of a morpheme should be regarded as general. An additional problem with the criterion of selectiveness is that though affixes are generally considered to be selecting, the selectiveness of bases in compounds remains unclear. In general it has been suggested above that selectiveness, serialness and generalness or specificity of meaning should be best regarded as properties of individual morphemes, and not of one certain type of morphemes only. The consequence we might draw from these observations is that the criteria just mentioned hide a number of problems for distinguishing affixes from elements of compounds.
Finally, the last group consists of the criteria of boundness and fixed position to the base. Although these criteria are well-defined and uncontroversial in themselves (a morpheme can be either bound or free), they present a problem for drawing the border between affixes and elements of compounds. Thus, the criterion of boundness allows to distinguish affixes from free bases, since all affixes are bound, but does not show the border between affixes and other bound forms which are used in compounding (as, e.g. unique morphs, bound roots and combining forms in English). Similarly, the criterion of fixed position to the base works fine for the distinction affix-free base/combining form, but does not always show the difference between affixes and bound roots since both may have a fixed position to the base.
Thus, the assumption that there must be something wrong with the criteria is true to a certain extent: some criteria are not quite suitable for drawing the border between affixes and elements of compounds, other criteria, e.g. that of boundness, allow to draw the border in some cases and not in other. It automatically leads us to our second assumption: that there must be something wrong with the distinction between affixes and elements of compounds. But what is really wrong?
96

The discussion of the criteria for distinguishing between affixes and morphemes that are used in compounding has shown that the two cannot be clearly distinguished per definitionem only: although all affixes are indeed bound morphemes, morphemes used in compounding can be bound as well. We have also discussed other properties of both classes of morphemes, such as their position within a complex word, selectiveness, serialness and meaning, and the discussion yields two remarks. First, there are quite a number of other properties, beside boundness, affixes and elements of compounds can possess. Second, compounding makes use not of one type of morphemes only, but of several. Third, since compounding makes use of a number of different morphemes, which possess different properties, partially similar to the properties of affixes, it becomes clear why the distinction between affixation and compounding cannot be drawn easily. To illustrate this more vividly, I will summarise in Table 2 the properties of different morphemes as they can be inferred from the discussion above:

Table 2 reflects some of the problems (already mentioned above) that we might face while deciding whether a given morpheme is selecting or not and whether it has a general meaning or not. But even if we ignore the problematic cases, we cannot resist the conclusion that there is an overlap in different properties between affixes and elements of compounds. Some morphemes compounding operates with, e.g. bound roots and free bases, have rather little in common with each
7 In Table 2 the question mark indicates that either it is unclear whether a given type of morphemes possesses this property or that there is a controversy around this property.
97

other. The consequence is then, that as long as there are similarities in properties between different morphemes, and as long as bound roots and combining forms are regarded as elements used in compounding, and affixes under a completely different process, we might be successful only in distinguishing some, especially the polar cases where an affix and a base bear an array of prototypical properties, but generally the clear border between affixation and compounding would remain difficult to draw. Moreover, a strict separation of affixation and compounding does not make tribute to the fact that a range of morphological formatives involved in word-formation in a given language is not exhausted by affixes and free bases only.
Drawing together the strands of the discussion above, we can say that there are differences in properties between morphemes involved in affixation and compounding. However, to draw the uncontroversial distinction between affixation and compounding along the lines of these properties is problematic: since some of the properties overlap, the rigid demarcation line fails. The application of the traditional criteria usually implies such a rigid line, therefore it comes as no surprise that it is doomed to failure. Besides, the discussion also shows that applying the criteria mentioned above to the data from Early Sranan is, first, not always possible, and second, not always desirable since the strict separation would distort the overall picture of Early Sranan word-formation. Therefore we must continue our search for a more adequate way of analysis. In this connection two questions should be put here. First, can we cope with the differences in properties of morphemes in a different way, without drawing a strict border, but still documenting both differences and similarities between different types of morphemes and processes? Second, can the distinction between affixation and compounding be drawn along different lines, such as, for instance, principles and mechanisms of their formation? The answers will be searched below where I will provide an overview of how affixation and compounding are modeled in some morphological theories in which issues relevant here received extensive treatment.
98

5.3.4. Affixation and compounding in word-formation theories: an overview
5.3.4.1. Aronoff (1976)
Within Aronoff’s theory, the lexicon is viewed as consisting of simplex and complex words that have a fully specified lexical entry, and of a system of wordformation rules which are completely separate from the rules of syntax and phonology. Aronoff (1976: 21) proceeds from the assumption that all wordformation processes are word-based, therefore all words must carry a lexical category specification and have lexical entries. Affixes, on the contrary, do not require a separate lexical entry, they are introduced only through word-formation rules and function as operators. Aronoff (1976: 22) regards a word-formation rule as a rule that specifies a set of words on which it can operate and which is termed “the base of that rule”. Every word-formation rule (WFR) specifies a unique phonological operation performed on the base, a syntactic label and subcategorisation for the resulting word and a semantic reading for it. Affixes are then phonological reflexes of word-formation rules, where their phonological form and position are specified. Thus, the rule for the negative prefix un- looks as follows according to Aronoff (1976: 63):
(10) [X]Adj → [un#[X]Adj]Adj semantics (roughly) un#X = not X
Aronoff (1976: 22) notes that the rules are applied only once, and they do not operate on morphemes, only on existing words. Affixes that can combine with bases of different lexical categories are considered homophonous and demand different sets of rules.
Since affixes do not have an independent existence in Aronoff’s model, their status is conceptualised as different from the status of words. Thus, there is a strict border between affixation and compounding, which has two major consequences. First, since affixes have a status different from, e.g. words, it presupposes that there cannot be any doubts about the affixal status of a given
99

morpheme and that, consequently, there must be some uncompromisingly stable and strict criteria according to which affixes can be distinguished from other types of morphemes. However, such criteria are not discussed in Aronoff (1976). The discussion in the preceding section has been a good demonstration of the fact that the existing criteria do not allow to draw this strict border, and that different types of morphological formatives, beside having differences also share interesting similarities which are hardly captured in Aronoff’s account. Second, it remains unclear whether affixation and compounding function according to different principles and different mechanisms. The difference in rules in Aronoff’s system results from different concepts of words and affixes. The difference between affixation and compounding is conceptualised through the difference in the types of morphemes the two processes operate in. And since the difference between affixes and other morphemes is rather strict, the distinction between affixation and compounding must be strict too. However, the weak chain in this type of argumentation is that even if affixes possess properties that render them distinct from, e.g. bases or words, this cannot be used as an argument that affixation and compounding are two completely different processes. Indeed, even if the two processes employ different kinds of formatives, they nevertheless may be governed by the same principles and function according to the same mechanism. And this is what Aronoff (1976) does not consider.
In the case of Early Sranan, Aronoff’s account would create the same problems, as the application of the traditional criteria presented above.
5.3.4.2. Selkirk (1982)
The major assumption behind Selkirk’s model (1982: 2) is that word structure has the same formal properties as syntactic structure and is generated by the same sort of rule system. Selkirk (1982: 4) assumes the existence of an independent morphological component that contains a set of “context-free rewriting rules”, a list of lexical items including affixes and other bound forms, and a (morpho)lexical insertion transformation. The context-free rewriting rules suggested by Selkirk (1982: 4) are as follows:
100

(11) a. b. c.

P → ϕ Q Af ψ P → ϕ Af Q ψ P→ϕQRψ

Note that Af stands for an affix of any sort and P, Q, and R are words of certain lexical categories. These rules are abstract and must be specified in accordance with morpholexical insertion transformations and subcategorisation frames of affixes. Selkirk (1982: 7) assumes that in English for instance, three categories are necessary to specify the rules: the category of word, of root and of affix. The categories of word and root are organised in a X-bar hierarchy: word is situated on the X° level, the root is on the X-2 level. The category of affix has a special position: it is not ordered in this hierarchy. A category of a higher level cannot be dominated by a category of a lower level. Selkirk also believes that complex words, like syntactic phrases, have heads. Selkirk argues that William’s (1981: 248) Right-Hand Head Rule according to which the head of a complex word is its right-hand member, is not adequate enough for English since it is unable to capture the cases like passer-by or enslave. Therefore Selkirk (1982: 20) modifies this rule in such a way that it becomes possible to describe the structures of the type passer-by and similar ones :

(12) in a word-internal configuration, Xn

P

Xm

Q

where X stands for a syntactic feature complex and where Q contains no category with the feature complex X, Xm is the head of Xn.

Selkirk (1982: 21) also states that syntactic and diacritic features of the head percolate to the dominating node so that both have identical features. Another

101

assumption made by Selkirk is that the principles of headedness and percolation operate in a similar way in both affixation and compounding in English.
What can be concluded so far is that Selkirk treats affixation and compounding in a similar way: in her model affixation and compounding (at least in English) function according to the same principle of headedness and to the same mechanism of percolation. However, as can be inferred from the contextfree rewriting rules and also from the discussion above, in Selkirk’s model, the overall status of affixes is treated as different from the status of the categories of word and root. Thus, it becomes clear from (11) that Selkirk assigns a separate category to affixes. In contrast to Aronoff, Selkirk considers affixes to be lexical items: they have lexical entries just as roots, stems and words do. Each affix thus has a listing of its category, its meaning, its phonological representation, and additionally, of its subcategorisation frame (syntactic environment in which it can be inserted). The difference between affixes and “nonaffixes” lies, according to Selkirk (1982: 64), in their boundness and in the fact that they are assigned the category type ‘Affix’. The necessity of assigning a separate category to affixes is explained by the fact that affixes have two properties which distinguish them from the categories of Word and Root (Selkirk 1982: 123-124):
(13) a. The category of Affix is preterminal: recursive embeddings of Affix within Affix have not been attested and affixes do not dominate words or roots.
b. Affix is always a sister to a nonaffix category type in word structure.
However, these two properties result from the basic assumptions of Selkirk’s theory and a different treatment of the category of affix might help to avoid problems arising from these properties. Thus, Hansen and Hartmann (1991: 64) show that if affixes can be represented in terms of lexical categories, such as V, A, N, then the problem that affixes cannot dominate words or roots disappears since bound V, A or N can dominate words or roots. The second statement in (13) rests on Selkirk’s observation that that the structures of the type Affix → Affix+Affix are not available, and if affixes were represented as bound V, A or N, this might lead to constructions of the type enance where the bound noun -ance attaches to the bound verb en-. Therefore, in Selkirk’s system, a separate category of Affix
102

serves to avoid the generation of such structures. However, as Hansen and Hartmann (1991: 64-65; 97-98) note, a different treatment of category-changing prefixes of the type de- and en- might enable the system to avoid the undesirable structures in question. Thus, if the category-changing prefixes are not treated as bound verbs then consequently formations of the kind enance cannot be produced. Another way of coping with this situation might be to define the subcategorisation of affixes in such a way that they cannot be subcategorised for the items that are bound. This would exclude formations of the type Affix + Affix.
Two further considerations lead Selkirk (1982: 123) to the postulation of a separate category of Affix:
(14) a. compound words do not have the same phonology as affixed words, and affixes are not treated as words by morphophonemic rules or rules of syntax-phonology mapping.
b. word structure rules are different for compounds and derivational morphology in English. Thus, the following structures available for affixed words in English are not available for compounds: V → N Vaf (e.g. winter-ize) V → A Vaf (e.g. soft-en) A → V Aaf (e.g. fidget-y)
On the basis of the observations in (13) and (14) Selkirk concludes that affixed word structures are different from compound word structures and therefore a separate category of Affix is necessary. She also notes (1982: 122) that if these observations were false, one might regard affixes as belonging to some other category, e.g. word or root (the only distinction between the two would lie in the boundness of affixes) and affixed structures might be regarded as special cases of compounds. It means that if we prove that the statements in (13) and (14) do not hold or if the properties mentioned in them might be dealt with in a different manner, we might come to a different theory of word-formation: the one where the distinction between affixes and other morphemes can be expressed entirely through lexical entries and the border between affixation and compounding can be eliminated. We have seen above that the properties of affixes mentioned in (13)
103

result from the basic assumptions of Selkirk’s theory and that problems connected with these properties can be avoided under a different theory. Considerations in (14) are built on the data from English and it is questionable whether the situation is the same in other languages. Thus, e.g. German compounds and derivatives can hardly be distinguished on the basis of their stress patterns (Hansen and Hartmann 1991: 63). As for word structure rules, the situation also seems to be different in other languages. Thus, Early Sranan has a greater variety of compound word structures than of affixed word structures. Similarly, the inventory of compounding in German displays a great number of various structures, but the inventory of affixation only some of them (Hansen and Hartmann 1991: 103) which makes it unnecessary to postulate separate rules for affixation and compounding. Note also that as Hansen and Hartmann (1991: 103) suggest, some independent principles, such as blocking can be an explanation of the fact why certain compound or affixed structures exist and others are not available. More recently Plag (2004) has suggested that the syntactic category specification of a base in derivational morphology may be only a by-product of the semantics of a given process. This suggestion would imply that word-formation rules should be based in the first place on semantic rather than syntactic category information. For Selkirk’s assertion in (14b) it would have the consequence that the difference between available compounding patterns and affixation patterns does not result from the fundamental difference between the two processes, but can be explained by the difference in individual semantic and other properties of affixes and elements of compounds. This has the further implication that the difference between affixation and compounding can be reduced to the properties of the morphemes involved which, in their turn, can be expressed through lexical entries. In general, the discussion presented here casts doubts on the assumption that affixation and compounding must be treated as fundamentally different processes because of the observations in (14).
In general Selkirk’s theory of word-formation yields several interesting insights into the nature of affixation and compounding. Thus, Selkirk’s account shows that affixation and compounding are processes which are governed by the same principles of percolation and headedness. Selkirk’s theory also renders affixes as similar to words and roots in that they have lexical entries which, like entries of roots and words, contain linguistic information about them. Such a view
104

of affixes offers two considerable advantages. First, it allows to integrate the idea, already mentioned above (section 5.3.3), that affixes bear similarities to other morphemes. Second, it suggests that drawing the strict border between affixes and elements of compounds is unnecessary, since all information about the linguistic properties of a given morpheme can be expressed in the lexical entry. However, despite these parallels, Selkirk draws a strict border between affixes and roots/words by assigning a separate category to affixes. This again results in the same general problems with the distinction between affixes and elements of compounds already discussed above. The question that arises in this connection is whether it might be possible to avoid the separate category ‘affix’ and to construct a theory that would make the advantage of the idea that affixes have lexical entries. Below I will discuss two theories where such an attempt has been made.
5.3.4.3. Höhle’s (1982) compounding theory of affixation
Höhle’s (1982) theory is based on the assumption that syntax and the lexicon interact in the formation of lexical items. In contrast to Selkirk, Höhle (1982: 77) assumes that both affixed words and compounds have the same internal structure which may be expressed as in (15a) and (15b):
(15) a. [N[Vswimm][Nbad]] is the structure of the compound Swimmbad b. [N[Vvermeid][Nung]] is the structure of the derivative Vermeidung
Höhle (1982: 80) argues that one more rule must be added to phrase structure rules on word level to enable them generate structures as in (15):
(16) X° → Y° ° Z°
For the rule to be able to produce the structures as in (15a) and (15b) two claims are necessary: first, that bound morphemes have an entry in the lexicon and second, that affixes are specified for word-class affiliation. Höhle (1982: 87) also
105

assumes that all semantic and distributional characteristics of morphemes are listed in their lexical entries and the entries of affixes contain additionally the information about their categorial environment, i.e. the category they attach to. Thus, for instance, the lexical entry of the German suffix -bar would contain the information that -bar attaches to the category of verbs and creates adjectives (Höhle 1982: 82). In contrast to affixes, the lexical entries of free morphemes do not contain the information about distributional restrictions in the categorial environment, but they do contain the specification of their lexical category.
Höhle (1982: 80) insists that there is a formal similarity between derivation and compounding and that the major difference between them lies in the properties of morphemes they operate with. He argues (1982: 88-96) that derivatives and compounds in German often behave in a similar way in terms of inflection and linking elements they take, as well as in terms of ellipsis procedures and the manner of argument linking. However, Höhle asserts that in some derivatives behave differently from compounds. The conclusion Höhle’s (1982: 1982: 91-93) draws is that this difference does not rest on the difference between derivation and compounding. Rather, it results from the fact that there are two types of affixes in German: those which behave like words and are thus similar to members of compounds (“Affixe mit einer starken Grenze”) and those which behave like affixes in a classical sense (“Affixe mit einer schwachen Grenze”). The central claim Höhle (1982: 82) makes in this respect is that the difference between the two can be reduced to the different properties of the morphemes involved. And since these properties are listed in the lexical entry, there is no need to draw the border between derivation and compounding since it can be expressed by means of the lexical entry.
In general Höhle’s theory differs considerably from both Aronoff’s and Selkirk’s accounts. Contrary to Aronoff (1976), Höhle shows considerable similarities between affixes and bases and contrary to Selkirk (1982) he integrates this idea of similarity into the overall system of word-formation by demonstrating that all the necessary linguistic information can be presented in the lexical entries of affixes. Moreover, Höhle goes even one step further than Selkirk (1982) by postulating a similar structure for derivatives and compounds and by assuming one general rule for both processes. In view of the problems arising with the distinction between affixes and elements of compounds discussed above, Höhle’s
106

account offers a good alternative which does not posit the necessity of drawing the border. However, there are several problems with Höhle’s account. Thus, Reis (1983) provides a critical analysis of Höhle’s theory and comes to the conclusion that this theory can be accepted for suffixation, but not for prefixation. Reis presents arguments of two kinds to show the shortcomings of Höhle’s theory. First, according to Reis (1983: 116-118; 122-123), the category of affix is necessary since:

(17) a. b.
c.

Without the category of affix, it is not possible to distinguish between affixes and bound roots. Without the category of affix, we cannot express the fact that affixes always have a fixed position within a complex word, whereas one and the same free root can occur both word-initially and wordfinally in different complex words. Without the category of affix, we face the difficulty to express the fact that bound roots with a fixed position in a complex word can also occur as free elements, as e.g. the German multi, whereas affixes cannot.

Hansen and Hartmann’s (1991: 96-101) discussion of Reis’ arguments, which cannot be presented here in detail, shows that all these problems can be solved by expanding the necessary information in the lexical entries of different morphemes and hence there is still no need to postulate an additional category of affix.
The second claim made by Reis is connected with Höhle’s assumption that both derivatives and compounds can be produced by one and the same rule since selectional restrictions of affixes can successfully be expressed through lexical entries. Reis (1983: 123-124) points out that though selectional restrictions of affixes can be expressed through lexical entries, there is still a need for two different systems of rules for affixation and compounding since otherwise selectional restrictions operating in compounding cannot be adequately presented. However, as Hansen and Hartmann (1991: 101-103) show, the selectional restrictions operating in compounding are rather triggered by some general principles, as e.g. blocking, and not determined by the nature of word-formation rules. Hence, there is no need to postulate them in a special system of word-
107

formation rules, and therefore, there is no need to draw the border between derivation and compounding.
Finally, Reis (1983: 113-115) casts doubts on the possibility to regard prefixes as word-like elements. Thus, Reis denies that prefixes can be assigned a lexical category on the basis of their relation to corresponding free forms and shows that such an attempt is highly problematic. Hansen and Hartmann (1991: 110) point out that this problem with prefixes has two consequences for Höhle’s theory. First, it undermines one of Höhle’s central ideas that affixes are bound words because in the case of prefixes the lexical category is difficult to determine. Second, if prefixes are indeed unmarked for their lexical category, then Höhle’s rule in (16) above does not function at least for prefixation since it is assumed to operate only on elements whose lexical category is marked. A possible solution to the problem with prefixes will be mentioned in the next section in connection with Lieber’s account.
5.3.4.4. Lieber (1992)
Lieber’s (1992) model bears certain similarities to the last two approaches discussed above. Thus, similarly to Selkirk (1982), Lieber (1992: 21) assumes that syntax and morphology are not two separate components of grammar and that there is one general set of principles that allows to generate both well-formed words and well-formed phrases. Lieber (1992: 21) assumes the existence of a lexicon that contains all idiosyncratic information about listemes and lists both free and bound morphemes. Each morpheme has a lexical entry that contains its phonological and semantic representation, as well as an indication of the syntactic category and a Predicate Argument Structure which gives the mapping between Lexical Conceptual Structure and syntactic structure. Bound morphemes are additionally supplied with information about their morphological subcategorisation, where the category of the morphemes they attach to is specified. The difference between affixes and morphemes of other types lies in the fact that the lexical entries of affixes additionally have information about the subcategorisation frame which indicates the environment where affixes can be inserted into word structure trees. Other bound morphemes, such as path (as in
108

psychopath) also acquire a corresponding indication of their boundness in their lexical entry. Thus, e.g. the three different types of morphemes: free base, bound root and affix will acquire different lexical entries, which are presented as follows by Lieber (1992: 22):

(18) a. run [V___] [rn] LCS: [Event GO ([Thing], [Path ])] PAS: x
b. -ize ]N,A___] [az] LCS: [CAUSE ([Thing], [BE (LCS of base)])] PAS: x
c. path [X[N___]] or [[N___]X] [pæ] LCS:...

words affixes roots

Thus, since in Lieber’s model all information about morphemes is expressed in lexical entries, the differences between morphemes are also expressed through their lexical entries. This has a considerable advantage: no separate category (e.g. similar to the category of affix in Selkirk (1982)) needs to be assumed and no long list of criteria for distinguishing between affixes and other morphemes is necessary. Also, in contrast to Aronoff’s model, affixes are not introduced through word-formation rules, but simply exist in the lexicon. This allows to avoid the necessity to conceptualise affixation rules as different from rules of compounding. However, there must be some mechanism (in Aronoff’s model this was done by word-formation rules) that would allow to produce certain word structures, and in Lieber’s theory this is done by employing the basic grammatical principles of Xbar (especially those of headedness), and by the mechanism of feature percolation.
Lieber (1992: 44) asserts that all logically possible structures in a language can be presented through the following conventions:

109

(19)

X°

X°

X°

X°

X° Y° Y° X°

X° YP YP X°

What structural configurations are possible and available in a given language is then, as Lieber shows, determined by the parameters of X-bar theory and related modules of grammar, which are general, and not syntactic or morphological, principles. The principles Lieber (1992: 38) uses for a uniform account of both morphological and syntactic structures are:

(20) a. b.
c.

Xn→...X{n-1,n}..., where recursion is allowed for n=0. Licensing Conditions: Heads are initial/final with respect to complements Theta-roles are assigned to left/right. Case is assigned to left/right. Heads are initial/final with respect to specifiers. Heads are initial/final with respect to modifiers. Pre- or post-head modifiers may be Xmax or X°.

These principles, especially the Licensing Conditions, are set once for a given language and apply both above and below word-level. Thus, the set of principles governing morphological and syntactic structures in English will be as follows (Lieber 1992: 54, emphasis original):

(21) a. b. c.

Heads are initial with respect to complements. Heads are final in respect to specifiers. Heads are final in respect to modifiers.

To show that not only compounds and phrases can be described by these uniform principles, but also derived words, Lieber suggests that sublexical elements, such as affixes, can be classified as specifiers, modifiers and complements in the way it is done with lexical elements. Thus, e.g. the prefix semi (as in semi-coherent) might be regarded as a specifier since it can be argued to function similarly to
110

specifiers in syntactic phrases (Lieber 1992: 39). Lieber admits, however, that the issue of describing stems in affixed words as specifiers, modifiers or other is not unproblematic. She argues that at least in some of such structures, as e.g. in happiness, the relation between the stem and the affix is hardly the one of restrictive modification and therefore can be treated as that of specification since the class of specifiers is rather heterogeneous.
A related issue is that of non-category changing prefixes. Whereas Lieber’s solution for coping with non-category changing suffixes lies in assigning them with a category through Feature Percolation Conventions, the situation is less clear with non-category changing prefixes. Here Lieber (1992: 56) suggests that some of the prefixes can be regarded as adjectives (ante-, co-) or adverbs (re-, mis-) and thus serve as modifiers, some others can be argued to be specifiers, as e.g. the English un-. Since all of them precede their heads, this assumption is consistent with the principles established for English in (22) above. By this line of argumentation Lieber avoids problems that were mentioned in connection with Höhle’s (1982) concept: within her theory it is not the lexical category of a prefix that is important, but its syntactic function (as a modifier, or complement, or other) since the principles established in (21) and (22) employ the notion of syntactic functions. This function can be identified by interpreting both the meaning of a given prefix and the meaning relation between it and the morpheme with which it occurs within a given construction. This diminishes the necessity of assigning a lexical category to an affix and does not affect the overall theory in the way it did in Höhle (1982).
As can be inferred from (20), in Lieber’s account, structural configurations available in a given language are actually explained and analysed uniformly in terms of the direction of headedness in this language. This direction, as Lieber shows, should not be set separately for morphology and syntax, since there is an interconnection between the position of the head in a word and in a phrase.
In general, Lieber argues that the principles of X-bar (mentioned in (21)), together with subcategorisation information about individual morphemes determine the basic linear order and hierarchical structure found in words and sentences. However, these principles do not determine the mechanism by which categorial information and other features are projected from lexical entries to fully
111

labelled word structures. This mechanism is determined through the following Feature Percolation Conventions (Lieber 1992: 92):
(22) a. Head Percolation Morphosyntactic features are passed from a head morpheme to the node dominating the head. Head Percolation propagates the categorial signature.
b. Backup Percolation If the node dominating the head remains unmarked for a given feature after Head Percolation, then a value for that feature is percolated from an immediately dominated nonhead branch marked for that feature. Backup Percolation propagates only values for unmarked features and is strictly local.
The conventions can be interpreted in such a way that if an affix has a value for some feature which is different from the value for that feature of its sister node in the tree, the value of the affix percolates to the mother node. If the opposite is the case, i.e. if an affix is not marked for some feature, then the value of the sister node of the affix is percolated to the mother node.
There are a number of overriding advantages in Lieber’s approach. First, it yields the tempting perspective of finding principles by which both processes, affixation and compounding, as well as processes in morphology and syntax in general can be uniformly explained. It also shows how both morphological and syntactic structures can be described by the same set of grammatical principles and by the same mechanism of inserting features inherent in morphemes into these structures. Second, by assigning lexical entries to affixes and all other morphemes of a given language and by assuming that sublexical elements can be classified in terms of specifiers, modifiers, etc it allows to ignore the border between affixation and compounding. Since all the information about a given morpheme is contained in its lexical entry, there is no necessity to repeat it in a rule, and since all morphemes have lexical entries, there is no need to postulate different rules for affixation and compounding. Both processes can then be described by showing how the information from the lexical entries will be
112

transferred to the structures in accordance with the mechanism of percolation and general grammatical principles (such as of headedness).
However, there are some ambiguous and controversial points in Lieber’s account. Thus, Sproat (1992: 241) is critical about Lieber’s explanation of why primarily left-headed English has quite a number of suffixal heads. As Sproat (1992: 241) notes, Lieber’s argument that at least some of derived words with suffixal heads can be analysed as specifier-head structures, which are right-headed in English syntax, is “less than satisfactory”. There are a number of other aspects Sproat (1992) subjects to criticism, which, however, are not crucial here.
Another point of criticism concerns not Lieber’s theory in particular, but the idea of affixes being lexical items which is part and parcel of other lexicalist theories as well. Thus, Beard (1982, 1987, 1988) raises a number of objections against this idea by arguing that affixes do differ from lexical items in a number of properties, as for instance:
1. There seem to exist such cases as zero affixes, but it is unclear whether we can uncontroversially speak of cases of zero lexical items.
2. Affixes seem not to undergo derivation in the sense lexical items do. 3. Lexical items usually belong to one syntactic category whereas affixes
can belong to different categories (as, e.g. -ing which can belong to the categories of result nominalisation, adjective, gerund etc). 4. Affixes are closed class items whereas lexemes belong to open class items.
I do not think that Beard’s arguments can seriously undermine accounts which regard affixes as lexical items. The idea behind such accounts is not that affixes are exactly the same as lexical items, but rather that they can be treated in the same way lexical items can, by acquiring lexical entries. Their specific properties can be fixed within the lexical entries and it is through lexical entries that differences between affixes and morphemes of other types can be figured out. Thus, the fact mentioned in point 3 above can be described as a part of a lexical entry of an affix, and shows that in this particular property a given morpheme differs from all the other ones. In sum then, accounts like the one by Lieber (1992) do not claim that all morphemes are alike, but show that different types of
113

morphemes can be described in a uniform way without postulating additional categories.
In general, main insights behind Lieber’s (1992) approach open a promising way of analysing Early Sranan word-formation since it allows us to eliminate the problematic border and to describe the different word-formation phenomena more accurately by paying attention to the properties of individual morphemes. The details of such an analysis will be discussed below, after a general summary on affixation and compounding.
5.3.5. Demarcation line between affixation and compounding: a summary
The overview of the traditional criteria provided above shows that a strict border between affixation and compounding is not easy to draw, and it is even more problematic in the case of Early Sranan data. The discussion of different word-formation theories above demonstrates that depending on the theory, affixation and compounding are conceptualised as totally different (Aronoff 1976), as more or less different (Selkirk 1982) and as rather similar (Höhle 1982, Lieber 1992). Remarkably, in most theories introduced above affixation and compounding are investigated and compared mainly in three aspects: the morphemes they operate with, the structures of the words they produce, and the principles and mechanisms that govern them.
Thus, in Aronoff’s theory affixation and compounding are conceptualised as different because affixes are conceptualised as fundamentally different from words. The difference in conceptualisation triggers the different ways of presenting word-formation rules and structures for affixation and compounding.
In Selkirk’s account affixation and compounding are viewed as different also because of the difference in the morphemes they deal with, as well as because of the difference in the structures of compound and affixed words. However, Selkirk also succeeds in showing two important similarities between derivation and compounding. She demonstrates that affixation and compounding can be described as governed by the same principle of headedness and by the same
114

mechanism of percolation, and that affixes, like free morphemes, are lexical items (although bound ones). The major point of difference between affixation and compounding as it arises from Selkirk’s work is then exactly the same as in Aronoff’s model: the difference in the properties of morphemes involved in the two processes.
Finally, it is in Lieber’s (1992) theory that we get a consistent analysis of both affixation and compounding by employing the same set of grammatical principles and the same mechanism of feature percolation. The remaining difference between affixation and compounding is then exactly the same as in Aronoff’s (1976) and Selkirk’s (1982) accounts: the one in the properties of morphemes involved. Thus, it is PROPERTIES OF INDIVIDUAL MORPHEMES the two processes actually differ in. ALL THE OTHER DIFFERENCES just follow from this crucial difference. This has one important consequence for an investigation of word-formation in Early Sranan. It means that different word-formation processes in a language can be analysed without drawing a strict demarcation line between derivation and compounding, by showing the major word-formation patterns and by describing the properties of morphemes involved in these patterns. I will go into the details of such an analysis in the next section.
5.3.6. How can affixation-compounding borderline be analysed in Early Sranan?
As it has been shown above, the border between affixation and compounding is difficult to draw in Early Sranan, partially because of the nature of the early sources which often do not contain the necessary information on pertinent words or phenomena. Below I will give regard to these problems in greater detail with the purpose of showing which framework offers a more adequate analysis of the phenomena that lie on the borderline between affixation and compounding in Early Sranan.
115

Early Sranan makes use of a number of morphemes that stand in between affixes and free bases. These morphemes and the constructs within which they occur are listed in (23):

(23) a. the person marker -man (< Engl. man)
[N/A/V-man]N
b. gender markers man(n)- and uman-
(< Engl. man/woman) [man(n)/uman-N]N

bótomán (boat-PM) ‘oarsman’ lésiman (lazy-PM) ‘lazybones’ hóntiman (hunt-PM) ‘hunter’ mann-doksi (GM-duck) ‘drake’ uman doksi (GM-duck) ‘duck’

c. diminutive marker pikíen- (< Port. pequeno) pikíen hási (DM-horse) ‘colt’
[pikíen-N]N

d. abstract noun markers -sanni and -fasi
(< Engl. something/fashion)
[A/V-fasi/-sanni]N

korisanni (deceive-AN) ‘deceit’ laufasi (stupid-AN) ‘stupidity’

e. augmentative marker mammá-

mammá-ston (AM-stone) ‘huge stone’

On the one hand, these morphemes bear a number of properties of prototypical affixes. First, as prototypical affixes, they fulfill the specific function of marking certain categories, such as ‘person’, ‘natural gender’, ‘diminutive’, abstract notions, and ‘augmentative’. Second, they have the fixed position in respect to the base when fulfilling these functions, and occur serially with semantic consistency. On the other hand, however, their status as bound morphemes is controversial since all of them have ‘free’ counterparts. In some cases, the difference in meaning between the free counterpart and the morphemes in question can be established, as in the case of the person marker -man whose meaning can be identified as ‘person’ in most cases, in contrast to its free counterpart man which means ‘adult human being’. However, in other cases, such as the gender marker man(n)-, or the nominaliser -fasi, this difference in not straightforward or it is difficult to establish it because of the lack of sufficient information or data.
Because of the borderline nature of such morphemes on the one hand and lack of sufficient information on the other hand, it is problematic to uncontroversially classify constructs containing such morphemes as in (23) as products of affixation or compounding. Since we have seen above that the difference between compounding and affixation does not lie in the mechanisms and principles of their construction, but rather in the properties of the morphemes, we have to develop a framework which would adequately capture the fact that
116

there are morphemes in Early Sranan that carry specific functions similar to affixes in other languages and occur serially with semantic consistency in a number of constructs.
The question that arises now is why should we regard constructs containing morphemes in (23) as something specific and not just analyse them as instances of compounding. My answer is based on functional considerations. In my view, there is a considerable difference between constructs containing morphemes in (23) and other Early Sranan complex words. This difference lies in the specific function of the morphemes in (23), that of marking certain derivational categories. By classifying constructs containing such morphemes as compounds, we would miss the important fact about Early Sranan wordformation: that it uses primarily analytical constructions to express typical ‘affixational’ concepts.
I will therefore not draw the border between affixation and compounding in the present study. Following Booij (2002; 2004; 2005) and Jackendoff (2002), I suggest that structures containing specific markers as in (23) can be conceptualised in the form of constructional idioms, i.e. multiword units of which some positions are fixed by being filled by specific morphemes. According to Booij (2004), constructional idioms occupy an intermediate position between more abstract patterns of word-formation and individual complex words in the lexicon. As Booij shows for Dutch, the structure of the combinations with the Dutch suffixoid boer ‘seller’ can be presented as the constructional idiom [[X]N[boer]N]N which occupies an intermediate position between more abstract patterns of word-formation, such as [[X]N[Y]N]N, and individual complex words in the lexicon, such as [[cigaren]N[boer]N]N ‘cigar seller’ and [[kolen]N[boer]N]N ‘coal merchant’.
Projecting Booij’s approach onto the data from Early Sranan, we can assume the following constructional idioms for Early Sranan:
117

(24) [[X]N,V,A[man]]N [[man(n)][X]N]N [[uman][X]N]N [[pikíen][X]N]N [[mammá][X]N]N [[X]V/A[sanni]]N [[X]V/A[fasi]]N

‘person connected with X’ ‘male X’ ‘female X’ ‘young/small X’ ‘huge X’ ‘state of (being) X’ ‘state of (being) X’

I did not specify the lexical categories of the specific morphemes in (24) because their identification cannot always be done straightforwardly, as it will be shown in chapter 7.
The terminological consequence of such an approach is that the wordformation products will mainly be referred to as constructs, and not as ‘derivatives’ and ‘compounds’ in the present study. The morphemes serving a specific derivational function, such as ‘agentive’, ‘diminutive’, etc. will be called ‘markers’, and not ‘affixes’ or ‘bases’ as in the traditional framework. Early Sranan word-formation will be analysed from the point of view of attested constructs. Each type of construct will be described in terms of its structure, its semantics, as well as the semantic and structural properties of its constituent morphemes.
Beside affixation-compounding distinction, another demarcation line essential in an investigation of Early Sranan word-formation: the one between compounds and syntactic constructions. Since the discussion of Lieber’s (1992) theory has shown that not only affixation and compounding in particular, but also morphology and syntax in general can be described as using the same set of grammatical principles, I will take a closer look at the morphology-syntax borderline in the following sections.

118

5.4. Compounding and the morphology-syntax distinction
5.4.1. Morphology-syntax interface in creole and non-creole languages
The relation between morphology and syntax in creole languages has often been viewed as being of some special nature. On the one hand, it has been observed that the very notion of compound is not as clear in creoles as it is in other languages (Mühlhäusler 1976). The following remark on compounds in creole languages made in Boretzky (1983: 79) might be of interest in this respect: “Es gibt keine Nominalkomposita im eigentlichen Sinne, sondern nur attributivisch an ein head noun angefügte Substantiva, eine Konstruktion, die in die Syntax gehört.” (There are not nominal compounds proper, there are only nouns that are attached attributively to other nouns, a construction belonging to syntax).
On the other hand, it has been pointed out that syntactic constructions play a special role in creole (and pidgin) word-formation. Thus, Mühlhäusler (1997: 158) notes that at the stabilisation stage of pidgin development one of the main mechanisms of lexical expansion consists of the use of syntactic paraphrases, circumlocutions and “phrase-like formulas for naming new concepts”, such as the Hiri Motu kuku ania gauna (smoke-eat-thing) meaning ‘pipe’ or lahi gabua gauna (fire-burn-thing) ‘match’. Mühlhäusler (1997: 179-181) argues that with the expansion of a pidgin, phrase-level derived lexical items that tend to dominate the initial stages of language contact gradually give way to word-level ones at the creolisation stage, e.g. the Tok Pisin phrase-level man bilong save ‘wise person’ was substituted by word-level saveman with the same meaning. Notably, lexicalisation of phrases to word-level units, as Holm (1988) observes, is more widely spread among creole languages than among other languages. Romaine (1988: 36) notes that employing circumlocutions and paraphrases is a common way to compensate for the lack of productive morphology in pidgin languages. Dijkhoff (1993: 10) argues for Papiamentu that most word-formation in this creole language is of syntactic, i.e. phrasal nature and that the scarce number of
119

derivational affixes make Papiamentu a language with “an almost empty morphological component”.
It remains to be tested whether such and similar remarks about the morphology-syntax relation in pidgins and creoles are really true and whether the nature of this relation is indeed special and extraordinary in comparison to other languages. What is uncontroversial in any case is that the problem of drawing a borderline between morphology and syntax has been a subject of almost any investigation that deals with word-formation, be it on creole or on ‘old’ languages. Indeed, the problem of demarcating the border between morphology and syntax, and the related problem of describing the status of compounds in a language is not new in linguistics. In general, compounds and phrases are supposed to differ in two respects.
First, compounds as morphological objects and phrases as syntactic objects are believed to have diverging properties in which they can be distinguished on a number of traditionally established, but not uncontroversial criteria. Much of empirical research on the compounding/morphology-syntax issue (Bauer 1998; Giegerich 2004; Liberman and Sproat 1992; Olsen 2000, 2001) goes in the direction of describing these properties in order to establish the points of difference.
Second, morphological objects and syntactic objects are argued to differ in the principles of their construction. Therefore, theoretical works on the issue at point try to anchor compounds within a certain area of grammar and investigate the issue of whether the principles of word-formation are fundamentally different from or fundamentally similar to the principles of syntax.
The issue of generation of compounds has a long tradition within morphological theory. The early accounts of compounding (Lees 1963) proceed from the assumption that compounds are generated from kernel sentences via transformation rules, thus rendering sentence- and word-formation essentially similar. However, the problem with such an account was that a reliable and predicable relation between compounds and the corresponding paraphrase sentences can often not be established. This idea is reflected in Chomsky’s lexicalist hypothesis (1970) according to which category changing transformations do not belong into the area of syntax. The subsequent research in this area went into two directions, the one assuming the fundamental difference
120

between word-formation processes and phrase-formation processes, the other proclaiming a principled similarity between these two processes though admitting a difference in the properties between phrases and words. The proponents of the first position (Allen 1978; Aronoff 1976; Bisetto and Scalise 1999; Di Sciullo and Williams 1987; Jackendoff 1975) thus view morphology and syntax as two different areas of grammar, and consequently, words and phrases as constructed by two different types of rule systems, whereas the supporters of the second view (Ackema 1994; Hale and Keyser 1993; Lieber 1992) believe that syntax as a single component of grammar is able to generate phrases and sentences as well as words even if words and phrases have different properties.
The essentials of the second position have already been introduced above in connection with Lieber’s theory. Therefore, below, I will first give regard to a model representing the first position before turning to the discussion of different criteria traditionally used to draw the borderline between compounds and phrases. All this, together with the insights gained in the discussion of the derivationcompounding distinction, will finally lead me to the elaboration of a framework for analysis of Early Sranan word-formation.
5.4.2. Compounds and phrases as two different constructs: Di Sciullo and Williams (1987)
The fundamental assumption behind Di Sciullo and Williams’ model (1987: 1) is that although both morphology and syntax possess a set of atoms and rules of combinations, they crucially differ in these atoms and in the properties of the rules of their formation. Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 19) argue that the sets of objects referred to by syntax and morphology are distinct: syntax deals with phrases whereas morphology with stems, affixes, morphemes; and that there is a binary distinction between morphemes, roots, stems, words and compounds on the one hand (which are collectively regarded as “the words”) and phrases and sentences (together regarded as “the phrases”) on the other hand. As Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 19) suggest, the difference between words and phrases can be made on two grounds. First, the differ in the rules of their formation: the rules
121

of word-formation are a “coherent whole” (they are right-headed), whereas rules of phrase formation are another “coherent whole” (in English they are leftheaded). The second basis is, according to Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 19), the syntactic atomicity of words: words are said to be opaque to syntactic descriptions and operations, but phrases are not. The concept of syntactic atomicity is expressed in the thesis of the atomicity of words postulated by Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 49) according to which the internal composition of a derived or compound word is always irrelevant to features higher up in the linguistic hierarchy, unless it appears in head position. It follows then that what is formally a word is also syntactically and semantically opaque, and hence transformational or syntactic rules have no access to the internal constituency of words. According to Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 48), the rules of syntax can access the categorial status and argument structure of a lexical item, they do not “see” how these features came into being. The arguments for the atomicity of words presented by Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 50-52) are as follows:
1. Words are generic in the way phrases are not. Thus, as Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 50) argue, it is impossible to say ‘John is a bank robber’ to mean ‘John is robbing the bank at this very moment’ because words lack reference to time which might be explained by their generic character.
2. Pronominal reference is not allowed in words. In the compound bank robber, the reference of the kind it robber is not attested. This is explained by the inaccessibility of the internal components of X° to syntactic rules.
3. Words are “referential islands” for proper names: *Bill admirer. 4. Affixed words and compounds are atomic in respect to wh-movement.
Within their concept, Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 1; 46) distinguish between three “conceptually and empirically” distinct notions of word:
1. word as a morphological object; 2. word as a syntactic atom; 3. word as a listeme.
122

Thus all words, morphemes, affixes, and derived words which can be subdivided into smaller components such as root, stem etc. are morphological objects and they are syntactically atomic in the sense described above. All right-headed compounds are also words in morphological sense (because of their formal similarity to words in their head-final structure) and they are also syntactic atoms. Whereas all morphological objects are syntactic atoms, there are also syntactic atoms that are not morphological objects, but which have the general properties of X° in other respects. Syntactic atoms of this kind are called syntactic words. Syntactic words do not have a morphological, but a phrasal form and they exhibit the general properties of X°s and are inserted into X° positions. They are therefore regarded as instances of X°. Syntactic rules cannot insert or move a category in the structure of syntactic words, they are referentially opaque and have a generic interpretation. Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 79) consider them marked objects because of the fact that their properties are not derived by morphological rules, but by special reanalysis rules through which phrases are reanalysed as words. According to Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 79), these rules are a part of the grammar of word-formation. Syntactic words are exemplified by constructions of two types. Thus, the first type is exemplified in Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 79-83) by Romance compounds that contain a verb and a complement of some kind and which are argued to have no clear heads. These types of words are marked and they are created by reanalysis of syntactic phrases to X° words through a non-morphological word-creating rule: N → VP (Di Sciullo and Williams 1987: 82). These syntactic words have the following structure: VP → V+XP, where XP stands for any category in the complement position of V, i.e. NP, AP, Adv or PP. Exocentric V+N compounds, such as the French essui-glace (to wipe off-mirror) ‘windscreen’ or the English V+Prep combinations of the type push-up also belong to this category and have the structure VP → V+XP. Another type of syntactic words created by reanalysis of syntactic phrases are, according to Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 83), cases in French where full syntactic phrases like NP or PP are reanalysed and function as X° lexical items, as e.g. V+NP=N: trompe-l’oeil (to deceive-DET-eye) ‘optical illusion’, V+PP=N: pince-sans rire (tongs-without-laugh) ‘wry comedian’. Di Sciullo and Williams
123

argue that these cases are created by another generalised rule: N→X+XP where XP= NP, PP.
Listemes are, according to Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 7), syntactic objects that are listed because of their unpredictable, non-compositional meaning, they have quite regular internal syntax which is given by phrasal syntax and not by morphology. As Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 1; 6) assert, listemes are neither syntactic atoms, nor morphological objects, but they are units which have the internal structure of other syntactic units and behave as other units do in syntax. There are different kinds of listemes :NP, AP; PP, VP, S, as e.g. all wet (AP), take to task, look up (VP), the cat that has got NP’s tongue (S), the Big Apple (NP) (Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 5-7). Listemes differ from syntactic words in that they are not syntactically atomic, they are structurally Xmax projections which happen to be listed because of their non-compositional meaning. A generalising overview of the three concepts of word provided by Di Sciullo and Williams (1987) is given in Table 3:

As it becomes clear from the discussion and also from the summary in Table 3, the border is actually drawn along two lines: the rules of formation in morphology

124

vs. syntax (in particular, rules of headedness) and the properties of morphological vs. syntactic constructions, especially the property of syntactic atomicity.
The first of the two distinctions is not unproblematic. As a matter of fact Di Sciullo and Williams’ assumption that positions of head are different in syntax and morphology is based on the state of affairs encountered in English, but this state of affairs is different for other languages. Thus, Dijkhoff (1993: 130-131) shows that Spanish has a number of left-headed endocentric NN combinations which have the properties of X°, but must be treated as listemes, i.e. Xmax phrases within Di Sciullo and Williams’ framework on the basis of their left-headedness. Lieber (1992: 31, 40) notes that there are languages with a “robust left-headed morphology” such as Vietnamese, or Tagalog which have predominantly leftheaded word-formation. The same is true about some African languages, where, as Dijkhoff (1993: 125) describes, it is a common phenomenon to have categorychanging prefixes on the left. Moreover, as Liberman and Sproat (1992: 170-171) argue, Di Sciullo and Williams’s account misses the fact that even in English modifier-head constructions can be right-headed. This has the implication that the issue of headedness depends on a kind of structural relation between the elements of a complex construction and not simply on a certain position. All this runs counter to the predictions of Di Sciullo and Williams’ theory where morphology is rendered as essentially right-headed and syntax as essentially left-headed. And since Di Sciullo and Williams build the major assumption of their theory: that morphology and syntax are different areas of grammar on the notion of headedness, the fact that morphology and syntax can actually share the rules of headedness casts doubts on this difference. Indeed, a different account of headedness then leads to a different concept of the relation between morphology and syntax (as in Lieber 1992; Selkirk 1982). Note also that another difference between morphological and syntactic constructs that arises from Di Sciullo and Williams’ account and is connected with their model of headedness is the one in structure: thus, VN is a syntactic structure, whereas NN can be both syntactic and morphological. However, a different modeling of the headedness concept may also result in a different treatment of the structure issue. In more general terms, the border between morphology and syntax is difficult to draw unambiguously along the lines of headedness (and consequently, structure) as it is advocated by Di Sciullo and Williams (1987). This casts a serious doubt on Di Sciullo and
125

Williams’ basic assertion: that syntax and morphology are two separate components of grammar.
Now, turning to the second type of distinction, that concerning properties, we can make another important observation about the nature of difference between morphology and syntax. According to Di Sciullo and Williams, syntactic structures differ crucially from morphological structures in terms of atomicity. Syntactic atomicity seems to be an undeniable property of morphological constructs, and therefore a good criterion for distinguishing between morphology and syntax. But can the border between the two be really drawn strictly even in terms of atomicity?
A closer look at the three types of constructs presented in Table 3 shows that syntactic and morphological constructs can share the property of atomicity. Thus, morphological words and syntactic words (e.g. reanalysed phrases) differ in their structures, but both can be syntactically atomic. Moreover, Di Sciullo and Williams’ account also demonstrates that beside syntactic atomicity there are other properties that morphological and syntactic objects share. For instance, morphological words can share the property of non-compositional meanings with idioms. Both morphological words and reanalysed X° phrases are referentially opaque and generic in meaning.
In general, what arises as a by-product of Di Sciullo and Williams’ description of differences between syntactic and morphological constructs is that beside these differences, there is also an overlap in their properties. This has the consequence that the border between morphology and syntax can hardly be conceptualised as a dichotomy. If one still insists on morphology and syntax being different modules, one should at least present the relation between the two as a continuum with different items (morphological words, syntactic words, listemes) occupying different positions according to their properties. And, since Di Sciullo and Williams show that syntactic words can arise from phrases via reanalysis, one should allow items to move on this continuum from one point (syntax) to another (morphology) promoted by e.g. reanalysis.
In general the discussion above shows that even if syntax and morphology are conceptualised as two distinct modules of grammar, their distinction is not absolute, and cannot be drawn as a strict demarcation line since there is an interaction between morphology and syntax in at least two aspects: the rules of
126

headedness and some properties of their constructs. In the sections to come I will take a closer look at how compounds and phrases differ in terms of their properties. I will do this by discussing some traditional criteria aimed at drawing the borderline.
5.4.3. Criteria for distinguishing between lexical and syntactic constructions
5.4.3.1. Introduction
It has been pointed out above that empirical work on the morphology-syntax distinction often concentrated on the properties various constructions exhibit, and tried to correlate a certain behaviour with a certain type of construction, morphological/lexical vs. syntactic. In what follows I will examine how the morphological vs. syntactic status of a particular combination can be tested on the basis of morphological, syntactic and semantic criteria. The overview will be based on the discussion of the criteria done in numerous works on morphology (Bauer 1798; 1998; Brousseau 1990; Haspelmath 2002; Matthews 1974; Rainer 1993; Ten Hacken 1994).
5.4.3.2. The phonological criterion: left-hand vs. right-hand stress
It has been formalised in Chomsky and Halle (1968: 17) and often mentioned in works on morphology (Bloomfield 1933; Lees 1963; Marchand 1969) that compounds and syntactic phrases have different stress patterns. Compounds are said to be stressed according to the so-called compound stress rule: ‘stress is on the left-hand member of a compound’. On the contrary, syntactic phrases are stressed according to the so-called nuclear stress rule: ‘phrasal stress is on the last word of the phrase’. Thus, e.g. ápple cake must be a compound whereas apple píe must be a syntactic phrase. However, the empirical situation is not that straightforward.
127

On the one hand, it is not always clear which stress rule a given construction indeed obeys. It seems that there is variation of diverse kinds as to the stress patterns of complex units. Thus, Matthews (1974: 192) remarks that there is a free variation between different forms so that both mílk-shake or mílk sháke can occur. In a similar vein, Bauer (1998: 70) notes that experimental evidence suggests that there is no consistency in stress assignment in two-word combinations among groups of speakers and among individual speakers. Other studies in this direction confirm much inter- and intra-individual, as well as dialectal variation in stress assignment (Levi 1978; Liberman and Sproat 1992). It has also been pointed out (Liberman and Sproat 1992: 134; Matthews 1974: 192) that discourse phenomena such as focus and contrast may interfere with the stress pattern.
On the other hand, there seem to be compounds that do not obey the compound stress rule. Thus, for instance Marchand (1969: 28-29) notes that there are certain groups of compounds (e.g. some adjectival types of the kind grássgréen) that have “double stress”. There have been several attempts to systematically explain the origin of the exceptions to the compound stress rule, and they mainly go in three directions.
The advocates of the first position (Fudge 1984; Olsen 2000, 2001) point to the fact that there are a number of exceptions to the compound stress rule which seem to be rather systematic and restricted to certain types of meaning relations. Thus, e.g. copulative compounds of the type scholar-activist and combinations of words with temporal or locative meaning relations (e.g. summer níght, Boston márathon) usually have phrasal stress. However, Bauer (1998: 71) remarks that although important trends in this direction have been noticed, no precise and reliable set of such semantic relations has ever been established. In his critical assessment of the phonological criterion Bauer (1978: 93-94) comes to the conclusion that both initially and finally stressed N+N collocations are indistinguishable in terms of standard criteria for wordhood. Note also that some other studies (e.g. Liberman and Sproat 1992) of potential correlations between stress on the one hand and semantic and discourse factors, as well as lexicalisation on the other hand, show that none of these factors makes correct and reliable predictions about the difference in the stress pattern.
128

The second position has been recently given a new light by Giegerich (2004) who suggests that a particular type of structure correlates with a particular stress pattern: thus, complement-head NN constructions in English are lexical and therefore bear left-hand stress, whereas attributive constructions are syntactic and usually bear right-hand stress. However, as Giegerich (2004) argues, some modifier-head constructions can move into the lexicon via lexicalisation and thus acquire fore-stress or ‘copy’ the right-hand stress pattern on analogy with constructions with the same rightward elements.
Finally, the third approach tries to explain the occurrence of a particular stress pattern in terms of analogy (see Plag 2003c: 139). Thus, the fact that English complex constructions with the final noun ‘avenue’ bear righthand stress whereas all those with street bear lefthand stress can be assigned to the influence of analogy: all avenue-formations acquire right-hand stress on analogy to already existing forms with final avenue.
As it has already been pointed out in the previous chpater, the application of the criterion of stress is problematic for Early Sranan: the early sources do not provide consistent and sufficient information about the stress pattern of combinations that might potentially be compounds. Thus, almost no information on stress can be reliably discerned from Van Dyk (c1765): though some words do bear what might be called accentuation marks, but first, it is unclear what function these marks really fulfill, and second, with most word combinations these marks do not occur. In Kramp’s (1983) version of Schumann (1783) used for the present paper accentuation marks are rare with complex words or word combinations so that solid generalisations are not possible. In Focke (1855) the information on stress is abundant: for almost every word, stress is shown. However, in most cases it is unclear whether the stress assigned in word combinations reflects the stress pattern of the combination or whether stress assignment in individual words is just preserved in complex words. Because of this specific feature of early data the criterion of stress cannot be applied for distinguishing between compounds and phrases in the present study.
129

5.4.3.3. Morphological and Syntactic Criteria
5.4.3.3.1. The dependent element cannot be pluralised
Compounds are often said to function as words and thus to exhibit greater morphological cohesion than phrases. Thus, it has been argued (e.g. in Allen 1980: 12; Bloomfield 1933) that inflection does not occur inside compounds. Among different instances of inflection, plural marking has been taken as one of the favourite examples to demonstrate morphological cohesion in compounds: usually it is the final (head) component that acquires the plural marking: fruit cakes (vs. fruits cake). However, this view does not really mirror the empirical situation. Thus, Matthews (1974: 189) notes that there is a considerable variation in the plural forms of compounds: in the case of solicitor general, for instance, both plural forms: solicitor generals and solicitors general are acceptable. Ten Hacken (1994: 30-31) cites a number of examples from different languages where compounds deviate from the ‘no plural inflection inside’-pattern. Bauer (1998: 73) (see also Bauer and Renouf 2001: 115-117) argues that the examples with the plural marking on the first element become more rather than less common, and it is difficult to assign games mistress to one type of construction and art mistress to another so that nothing seems to correlate with this distinction, and hence, it becomes a pure matter of definition. Moreover, Bauer notes that it is not always clear that one or the other type must be used: drug courier and drugs courier seem synonymous, take the same stress pattern and seem to be free variants of each other. In connection with this, Bongartz (2000: 36) notes that actually, restrictions on pluralisation in compounds are not absolute since plurality can be used within compounds to, for instance, mark heterogeneity, as e.g. in claims applications, parks commissioner, programs coordinator. Sproat (1992: 237) remarks that it is not only in the compound parks commissioner that the marking of plurality on the non-head noun is irrelevant to the syntactic principle of subject-verb agreement, but also in the phrase the commissioner of parks, which shows that it is not the syntactic atomicity of compounds (as suggested by Di Sciullo and Williams 1987) that is responsible for this fact. Sproat’s reasoning suggests that explanations for a specific kind of behaviour of a given construction can be searched for in factors
130

other than its being a morphological or syntactic object. This observation will be also made in several other cases below.
In the specific case of Early Sranan, the criterion of morphological cohesion cannot be applied to the data because plurality in Sranan is not marked on the nouns themselves (cf. Bruyn 2002: 177).
5.4.3.3.2. Syntactic atomicity
One of the major characteristics of words as morphological objects especially propagated within the framework developed by Di Sciullo and Williams (1987) is syntactic atomicity. The idea of atomicity is actually based on the assumption behind the Lexicalist Hypothesis (formulated in Lapointe 1980: 8) that no syntactic rule can refer to elements of morphological structure. The thesis of atomicity as formulated in Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 49) holds that words are atomic on the level of phrasal syntax and phrasal semantics: the features of words have no structure, and the relation of these features to the internal composition of the word are not relevant in syntax. It follows then that compounds are said to be inseparable, no element can be inserted or replaced in a compound. Syntactic phrases, on the contrary, seem to be syntactically separable. The criterion of syntactic atomicity presupposes a number of tests that must allow to state whether a unit is syntactically atomic or not.
Coordination Test. It has been asserted that components of compounds cannot be co-ordinated: as Bauer (1998: 74) asserts *bread and buttercups, where the righthand element is removed or *buttercup and saucer, where the left-hand element is removed, do not seem possible. However, there are a number of combinations that do allow co-ordination. Thus, Matthews (1974: 192) provides some co-ordination examples for English compounds and Booij (1985) for Dutch. It seems that coordination is a process compounds can undergo, but under certain constraints.
Thus, co-ordination seems possible only where nouns to be co-ordinated belong to the same domain. Bauer (1998:74) notes that cat and dog shows sounds normal because the nouns dog and cat belong to the same domain, whereas antique and dog shows sounds odd. Another constraint, according to Bauer (1998:
131

74-75) holds that co-ordination of N+N constructions is possible when the semantic relationship between the elements co-ordinated is parallel. Thus, in steel bars and weights the relation of ‘B is made of A’ is constant which makes coordination possible. However, as Bauer (1998: 75) notes this constraint “bans zeugma from normal language” and it applies more generally than just to N+N constructions. The arguments presented lead Bauer to the assumption that the possibility or impossibility of co-ordination does not result from the fundamental difference in the construction (compounds vs. syntactic phrases) but from general constraints on co-ordination and varying degrees of lexicalisation. In a similar vein, Giegerich (2004) suggests that coordination is possibly not a reliable test for lexical status of a construction since first, according to Wiese’s (1996: 69-71) it might be regarded as a phonological process whereby identical phonological material (phonological word is the minimum unit) is deleted, and second, operation of some pragmatic factors may constrain coordination in English .
In general, it seems that, as in the case of ‘no-plurality-inside’ feature, we can find other explanations that do not necessarily result from a principled morphology-syntax distinction.

The Insertion Test. Brousseau (2002: 186) argues that the syntactic atomicity of compounds can be tested by inserting a lexical item inside a complex structure. Whereas syntactic phrases allow this insertion, compounds cannot be interrupted in this way:

(25) a. b.

We bought [black satin sheets]NP. *We bought [black-sweet-berries]Compound N

In a similar vein, Ten Hacken (1994: 52) notes that elements of compounds cannot be separated by parentheticals, e.g. Shakespeare has written several classical love *so-called stories. However, as Ten Hacken remarks, it is unclear how ordering restrictions on adjectives may interact with this property. Thus, it can hypothetically be the case that the failure to insert an item between components of a combination is blocked by such ordering or semantic restrictions and not by the fact that a combination is generated by morphological rules. In an alternative account of the atomicity issue, Lieber (1992: 140-145) shows that the
132

impossibility of movement into and out of words can be explained by the operation of some general syntactic constraints which restrict movement out of phrases in the same way.
I would suggest another possible explanation for the inseparability of blackberry in (25b). I think that the lexicalised meaning of blackberry which is perceived not as ‘berry which is black in colour’, but rather as ‘a special kind of berries’, blocks separation. Note that it is only in the second, and not in the first type of meaning that (25b) is ungrammatical, which supports my assumption. A similar line of reasoning might be advanced for other examples. Thus, the phrase big house is separable as in big new house because such separation does not destroy the meaning of the combination big house, but merely changes it in a grammatically acceptable way. The combination pickpocket is inseparable because a separation would destroy its idiomatic meaning, and the same is equally true about the idiomatic phrase to kick the bucket. In the phrase the house of my parents it is hardly possible to insert an adjective between house and of: house big of my parents does not sound well-formed. Does it mean that the phrase in question is atomic? An explanation, I would suppose, lies rather in a syntactic principle of English that adjectives are usually placed prenominally in such phrases. In the same way, it might be supposed that the atomicity of blackberry in the meaning ‘a specific kind of berry’ might lie in some principle of grammar that prohibits insertion of elements into complex items with lexicalised meanings which would result in the destruction of this meaning. What I want to suggest here is not a denial of syntactic atomicity of words. Rather, I believe that this property should not necessarily be viewed as resulting from their being produced in a different component of grammar. I think, atomicity of complex forms is closely connected with lexicalisation of meaning: words usually acquire specific meanings that make them fulfill a naming function, whereas phrases usually have descriptive compositional meanings that can be modified in a number of ways. I believe that syntactic atomicity test can show us that a given unit is a word. It does not show, however, that this property results from the fact that words are created in a different component of grammar.
Compounds as Referential Islands. It has been argued (Di Sciullo and Williams 1987) that pronominal reference is impossible in words: in the compound bank
133

robber, as Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 50) assert, it is impossible to replace the first element bank by the pronoun it. However, Liberman and Sproat (1992: 173) suggest that referential expressions of the kind it robber may be ruled out by a constraint that does not allow derivation from closed-class items or by the fact that projections of functional categories cannot serve as modifiers. Another explanation for this phenomenon is given by Haspelmath (2002: 159), who notes that the failure of referential expressions to occur inside compounds results from the semantic condition that the dependent component of a compound must be generic: anaphoric pronouns cannot be interpreted generically, so they cannot occur as dependent members of compounds.
There is also a different type of reference which has been discussed as a potential test for compoundhood. Thus, Bongartz (2002: 35) argues that while nouns in nominal phrases of the type the driver of the truck filled it with gas have full referential properties, non-head nouns in compounds (e.g. in *the truck-driver filled it with gas) cannot be the antecedents for it. Similarly, Ten Hacken (1994: 75-77) claims the use of anaphora as in the sentence He’s a ladyi-killer because he likes themi so much (from Matthews 1974: 192) to be rather odd and a case of “doubtful normality”. Proceeding from this idea, Ten Hacken (1994: 75-76) develops a Pronominal Reference Test by which a compoundhood of a given construction can be tested:
“Construct a discourse with the alleged H-compound (headed or determinative compound, MB) Z in one sentence and a pronoun referring to the non-head of Z in the next sentence. If the discourse is correct, Z is not an H-compound.”
The example of such a test given in Ten Hacken (1994: 76) is as follows:
(26) Yesterday, we watched a wari film. *Iti was very cruel.
However, it is arguable in how far this test really shows the difference in the morphosyntactic status of complex constructions. Thus, in examples provided by Bongartz, two structurally different constructions are compared: in the phrasal construction the antecedent of the pronoun it is not simply a N° truck, but the
134

whole NP the truck. In the case of the compound truck-driver it is a N° that it refers to. Note that Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 50) advance a hypothesis (beside the idea that impossibility of reference is the result of the atomicity of words) that reference can be assigned only to NPs and not to N°. This is exactly the point with the examples given by Bongartz.
With respect to Ten Hacken’s test I doubt that it is of use for distinguishing between morphological and syntactic constructions that have the same, e.g. NN, structure. Thus, if we try to apply this test to the combination steel bridge which is considered a syntactic construction (Giegerich 2004: 6) we must admit that it can be argued to refer to the whole combination steel bridge, and not to the noun steel only:
(27) This is a steel bridge. ?It is stainless.
A different position on the issue of referentiality is taken by Ward, Sproat and McKoon (1991) and Lieber (1992). Ward, Sproat and McKoon (1991) provide a number of examples similar to the Matthews’ sentence above and argue that there is no grammatical restriction on the use of complex words as antecedents of pronouns. Instead, judgments about acceptability of a given example are influenced by other various factors: pragmatic, semantic, lexical.8
Upon this background, the pronominal reference also does not allow to draw a strict demarcation line.
The Submodification Test. It has been assumed (e.g. in Bloomfield 1933) that elements of compounds cannot be submodified independently, thus e.g. a broad river-bed will be interpreted as ‘a broad bed for a river’ rather than as ‘a bed for a broad river’. Bauer (1998: 73) argues that beside constructions in which the submodification of the first element seems to be difficult or sounds ungrammatical, as e.g. in slow walking stick, there are a number of cases where the submodification seems to be possible, as e.g. in public lending right, big-ticket
8 Note also that it has been demonstrated by Ward , Sproat and McKoon (1991), and also argued for in Bauer (1998) and Liberman and Sproat (1992) that compounds with proper names as their first components allow a kind of reference where the name is an antecedent for a pronoun.
135

items, light-rail system. Bauer further argues that if this criterion should be used to distinguish between the two sets of constructions there must be N+N syntactic phrases where the default reading is for an adjectival modification to apply to the first noun only. But as Bauer argues, in many constructions two interpretations are possible: [Sweedish steel] blade and Sweedish [steel blade] and he considers the latter one to be the default case. This, in Bauer’s view, weakens the criterion since no considerable difference can be established between such constructions and those of the kind lending right or river-bed. Haspelmath (2002: 158-159), contrary to Bauer, notes that the cases where adjectival modification is possible, as in open-air concert, African history teacher, small claims court are quite unusual cross-linguistically and are normally restricted to fixed phrases, if one considers the following examples *thin-air concert, *recent history teacher, *large court claims. Note that the relatively small number of such examples may have pragmatic reasons: it is unclear what the communicative purpose of the combination *thin-air concert might be. Ten Hacken (1994: 54) discusses instances similar to those enumerated by Haspelmath and suggests that cases of the kind travel book shop or the Dutch mooi-weer-versie (‘good weather version’) do not violate the non-modifiability criterion since the combinations travel book and mooi weer are separate constructions formed prior to the compounds in question.
The analysis advanced by Ten Hacken, however, suggests that modification is a problematic terrain to take it as a criterion for distinguishing between compounding and syntax. Thus, if cases like mooi-weer-versie should be regarded as having the [[AN]N] structure and thus as not violating the nonmodifiability criterion, then the same can potentially be done with any other construction of this type. It has the consequence that in the case of broad river bed a possible interpretation might be [[broad river]bed] where the modifier broad refers to the noun river only. Thus, the question of possible or impossible modification becomes largely a matter of interpretation and possibly, of context. This, on the whole, makes the criterion of non-modifiability problematic for distinguishing between compounds and phrases.
There is also a different case of modification that has been used as a test for compoundhood: Thus Brousseau (1989b) has pointed out for Haitian that
136

compounds containing an adjective can be modified by a semantically incompatible adjective, as in (32):
(28) yon [gwo-dwèt]N piti ‘a big-finger small’ ‘a small toe’
However, even in this case it is questionable whether the possibility of modification results from the fact that gwo-dwèt is a morphological object. An alternative explanation that I would suggest is that since the meaning of gwo-dwèt is perceived metaphorically ‘toe’, and not literally as ‘big finger’, it comes as no surprise that modification is possible. It is this specific metaphorical meaning that makes gwo-dwèt an inseparable entity that is prone to modification of the kind in (28).
Syntactic atomicity: a summary. It has been shown above that syntactic atomicity is often considered to be the major criterion for wordhood, and thus a crucial one for distinguishing compounds. However, it has also been mentioned that it is not quite clear whether syntactic atomicity of a given entity necessarily results from its status as a morphological object. In some cases, alternative accounts for atomicity have been explored. The position I would adhere to in this respect is not that compounds (or morphological objects in general) are non-atomic, but rather that the feature of being or not being atomic might be a result of some other factors than the mere assumption that atomic items are produced in morphology only. I have also shown that most tests of atomicity, such as coordination test, submodification test, referential opacity test, are problematic by their nature. The test that seems to be less problematic and that shows that something is a unit in the lexical sense is the separability test. However, the question that arises now is: how to apply this test to early data? The strategy I will use is two-faceted. I will first, search the sources for cases where units under analysis occur in a separated form. If such cases exist, I will next test whether the specific meaning of a combination is destroyed. If this is the case, a given unit will be regarded as X° unit. If the meaning is not destroyed, this unit will not be regarded as a word. Second, if cases of separation will be unattested in the sources, I will carry the separation test by inserting an intervening lexeme between parts of a given unit. If
137

the meaning remains only modified, but not destroyed, this unit will not be regarded as word.
5.4.3.4. The semantic criterion of non-compositionality of meaning
Already Jespersen (1942: 137) noted that a combination of words should be regarded as a compound if “the meaning of the whole cannot be logically deduced from the meaning of the elements separately”. Compounds are often said to have idiomatic meaning which cannot be determined from the meaning of the constituents. However, as Haspelmath (2002: 156) notes, idiomaticity is “neither a necessary nor a sufficient criterion for compound status” since there are quite a number of compounds with semantically regular, compositional meaning, e.g. piano-turner, spring festival. On the other hand, there are idioms which are not compounds, as to kick the bucket or to buy a white horse. In fact, the process of developing an idiomatic meaning must not be a result of a morphological vs. syntactic status, but can be viewed as a feature that arises under such processes as metaphorical extension, lexicalisation or, as Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 14) put it, a need for short encoding of a complicated idea. Therefore, noncompositionality of meaning is difficult to be used in a reliable separation of morphology and syntax.
Note also that the notion of compositionality is a gradual one (cf. Grimm 1991: 99-100). Thus, it is a vexed question whether we should regard the Early Sranan fowloe-mamà (hen-mother) meaning ‘the maid who takes care of the poultry’ as compositional, non-compositional or an in-between case. Another point is that the perception of a word in terms of compositionality might differ among languages. Thus, the Early Sranan examples lalla bréde (raw bread) meaning ‘bread dough’ or dondrofaija (thunder fire) meaning ‘lightning’ might not be transparent for the speakers of English, but it is questionable and unclear whether the same is true about the speakers of Early Sranan for whom their West African background might have made such formations compositional. Upon this background, I would use the notion of non-compositionality as a gradable one in the analysis of Early Sranan word-formation.
138

5.4.4. Compounds vs. phrases: a summary
Several generalisations arise from the discussion above. First, some of the criteria (non-compositional meaning) are problematic to apply for a clear separation of morphological and syntactic objects. Other criteria are language-specific and can be well applicable in some languages (e.g. the criterion of stress in German), but more problematic in other, as it is the case with the stress criterion in English where it is unable to draw a strict demarcation line. Second, it seems not always clear what really triggers a specific feature of a given construction: its status in grammar or some other factors. Thus, in quite a number of cases (coordination test, separability test, no-plurality-inside-test, referential properties etc.) differences in behaviour of a particular construction might be explained by reasons other than its originating from a some different module of grammar. And although in general it seems that compounds and phrases can have different properties it is also an irrefutable fact that they cannot be unambiguously and clearly distinguished through these properties because of the evident overlap in them. Therefore, the strict borderline between compounds and phrases is hard to draw. This makes us doubt whether the existing differences in properties really justify the traditional distinction into compounds and phrases. This doubt is corroborated by the fact that it is still, as it was presented above, a vexed issue whether the two do differ in the principles of their construction. Note also that some of the criteria or tests (e.g. stress) cannot be applied to the data from Early Sranan for reasons already mentioned.
Despite these problems we can imagine at least two possible scenarios of dealing with the compounding-syntax borderline in general and in the present work in particular.
The first scenario rests on the idea of morphology and syntax being two separate, but interacting areas of grammar with different sets of rules. In the specific case of compounds-phrases distinction, morphology would be responsible for the production of compounds, and syntax for the production of phrases. The relation between the two could be conceptualised as a continuum on which items can move from one polar point (syntax) to another (morphology) via e.g. lexicalisation or analogy (as e.g. suggested by Giegerich 2004).
139

By adopting the first scenario we must convincingly show that the principles involved in the construction of morphological and syntactic objects are indeed different. Besides, we have to assume that products of syntax and products of morphology also exhibit different properties and we have to explain how and why they come to possess these properties. We must then show how the differences attested in the properties of such objects correlate with these different principles of construction.
According to the second scenario, morphology and syntax belong to the same area of grammar and have one set of principles for the construction of different types of complex structures.
By adopting the second scenario, we are actually facing two tasks. First, the general principles governing construction of different complex units in a language must be established. Second, properties of different constructions must be investigated and explained. This approach avoids drawing strict borderlines, but demands an accurate elaboration of principles and a detailed description of properties of the constructions under investigation.
The question that arises now is: Which scenario is more suitable for the data from Early Sranan? In the section to follow I will test both of them on the data from Early Sranan and develop an approach which enables us to analyse the data in the least problematic way.
5.5. The framework for the analysis of Early Sranan wordformation
The test of the scenarios presented in the previous section presupposes a comparison of words and phrases of a given language in terms of the principles of their construction and their properties, as well as establishment of a correlation between these principles and properties. To carry out this type of test for Early Sranan, I will compare different types of words with different types of phrases in four aspects: their structure in terms of lexical categories, the position of the head, the type of syntactic relation between their components, their semantics and their pragmatic function. I have chosen these aspects for two reasons. Some of them,
140

such as their structure and the position of the head were the point of departure for different lines of reasoning in theories discussed above, especially in Di Sciullo and Williams (1987) and Lieber (1992). Others, such as semantics and pragmatic function have been chosen because I believe that different constructs differ considerably in respect to their semantics and pragmatic function and it is often semantics and pragmatics of compounds that makes them different from syntactic phrases.
Since the comparison I want to make here will also concern the type of syntactic relation between components in words and phrases, it is necessary to remark that I assume modification and complementation as the two basic relations between components of complex words, as well as between components of phrases in Early Sranan. Modification will be viewed as the relation in which one word more closely specifies or determines the meaning of another word or unit (nice in nice house or walk in the field, in the field is a modifier). In contrast to Lieber, I will not distinguish between modifiers and specifiers because the definition of modification just provided allows us to include specifiers as well. Complementation will be viewed as dependency of NPs on prepositions (the garden in in the garden) and of NPs and other complements on predicators (the money in collects the money).
In the left-hand column in (29) I provide the data on common types of complex words attested in Early Sranan. In the right-hand column, I provide examples of common types of syntactic phrases available in Early Sranan.

There are three types of similarities between the constructs on the left and those on the right. First, they have exactly the same structure in terms of syntactic

9 In this unit na is the short form of nanga ‘and/with’ (cf. Focke 1855: 86).
142

categories: both examples in (29a) have the N+N structure, those in (29b) exhibit the A+N structure, those in (29c) have the Num+N+N structure and so on. Second, the constructs on the left and those on the right exhibit very similar syntactic relations between the constituents. Thus, the elements in the first six pairs exhibit the modification relation between the head and the non-head, those in (29g) stand in a non-hierarchical relation of coordination, those in (29h) exhibit the relation of complementation. The final similarity lies in the headedness of the examples on the left and on the right. The first three pairs are right-headed, whereas the following three are left-headed.
There are, on the other hand, also differences between the examples on the left and those on the right. One remarkable difference is that the items on the left are single referential units10 comparable to simplex words. Those on the right are not: each constituent word in them is a single referential unit, but together they do not form such units.
The second difference lies in the fact that all combinations on the left are syntactically atomic. However, this atomicity is not a result of their being produced by a different module of grammar, but the outcome of the fact that the items are single referential units. The unit wan de worké ‘Monday’ is syntactically atomic not because it is a morphological construct produced by a different rule in a different module of grammar. If we argue in this way, then we cannot reasonably explain the fact why the unit with exactly the same structure such as wan pisi gron ‘one piece of earth’ is separable. As I have already argued above, the compositional semantics of wan pisi gron allows a separation, whereas the specific meaning of wan de worké does not.
The third difference lies in the different pragmatic functions: whereas the items on the left serve the purpose of NAMING objects (as in (29a), (29b), (29c), (29d), (29e)) or persons (as in (29f) or numeric concepts (as in (29g)), the items on the right do not fulfill such a function. Instead, they DESCRIBE persons (as in (29a)), or objects (as in (29d)), or states (as in (29h)), or locations (as in (29i) etc.
The forth difference is that some of the structures on the right do not have correspondences on the left, as it is the case in (29i).
10 This term is taken from Lieber (2004: 10).
143

Finally, there is a difference in the frequency of use of certain structures in certain functions. The structures in (29a) and (29b) are very commonly used to name objects or persons and serve as single referential units. All the remaining structures on the left in (29) are rarely used in this function. The last two differences are related. The advocates of the separationist position towards morphology-syntax distinction would attribute these two differences to the different areas of grammar in which these constructs are produced: the left-headed constructs are phrasal and syntactic in nature, whereas the right-headed ones in (29a) and (29b) are morphological formations. I maintain that the absence of such constructions as in (29i) or the difference in the frequency might lie in the fact that some structures in a language are pragmatically more preferred for fulfilling the naming function whereas others are less so. How can it be?
Thus, condensation of information is one of the major functions of wordformation: instead of using long sentences and phrases speakers prefer shorter alternatives, such as complex words (Motsch 1999: 26; Plag 2003c: 59-60; cf. also Di Sciullo and Williams 1987: 14). Therefore, longer constructs, as those in (29d) to (29i) are less favorable for the naming function.
Another reason may lie in the other two pragmatic principles that constrain possible word-formation: the principle of useful and meaningful word and the principle of interpretability of the outputs of word-formation (Motsch 1999: 25). According to the first principle, newly created words must denote communicatively useful and acceptable concepts. According to the second principle, newly created words must be interpretable and acceptable semantically. Turning to our Early Sranan examples, we can assume that some structures, e.g. N-N or A-N compounds exhibit a higher potential of semantic interpretability that others, e.g. N-Conj-N. Thus, the absence of the complex words with the structure Prep-Det-N may be explained by the fact that it is unclear what object, quality, or state such a structure could name.
Let us now turn to the initial question: how can the observations just made be treated within the two scenarios presented in the previous section?
If we follow the first scenario, where morphology is a separate module of grammar (in Di Sciullo and Williams’ (1987) sense), we have to admit that the principles of construction are different for morphological and syntactic objects, and that morphological objects are right-headed. It has the consequence that we
144

have to regard the examples in (29d), (29e) and (29f) as syntactic constructions which moved from syntax to morphology via reanalysis or lexicalisation. Their specific properties, such as inseparability or non-compositional meaning will then be a result of reanalysis and lexicalisation. However, the controversial fact about such a scenario is that both types of examples in (29a), (29b), (29c) are rightheaded and exhibit the same type of component ordering (modifier-head) and structure (N-N, A-N, NP-N). In syntactic and structural terms, therefore, I do not see a difference between them. There is, however a pragmatic difference: those on the left function as single referential entities, and name new concepts whereas those on the right do not. Besides, the constructs on the left are syntactically atomic and may have non-compositional semantics, in contrast to those on the right. However, these properties can be viewed as a consequence of their pragmatic function: as naming units they function on the level of syntax as simplex words which are naming units as well. Note also that the differences do not follow from the difference in the principles of construction, which is assumed within the first scenario, and actually within any work that claims a separation of morphology and syntax. Rather, these properties come into being out of reasons semantic and pragmatic in nature.
The discussion above shows that at least for Early Sranan, the second type of scenario, within which morphology and syntax are not conceptualized as two different areas of grammar, appears to be more suitable. However, in contrast to Lieber (1992) whose approach mainly uses syntactic tools as explanatory mechanisms, the position I advocate here is largely based on pragmatic considerations.
I maintain that every language has a certain number of structural possibilities, a ‘pool’ of constructions of different types. When speakers use language, these abstract constructions become differentiated in terms of their functions. Some types of constructions will be used more often in the conceptnaming and reference-establishing functions, others will be less so or not at all. Which types of constructions are more preferred in which function is to a great extent regulated by pragmatic principles, such as condensation of information, semantic interpretability and pragmatic usefulness of a certain concept. The different functions in which different constructs appear will then shape their properties. Thus, the syntactic atomicity and frequently occurring non-
145

compositional or only partially compositional meaning are usual outcomes of the concept-naming function.
Taking these assumptions as a basis, word-formation resources of Early Sranan will be viewed as a collection of constructions serving the naming function. Therefore, the traditional distinction between compounding and syntax will be abandoned in the present study. I will describe the different constructions which can be used to name objects, states, qualities in Early Sranan in terms of their structure, the syntactic relation between their components, the semantics of the components and the semantics of the whole construction. As it was the case with the examples involving specific markers above, I will mainly use the term ‘construct’ to refer to the outputs of different structural and semantic patterns serving the naming function. Some other terms, such as ‘concatenation’, or ‘compound’ will be used to refer to these outputs as well, especially when they resemble compounds in the traditional sense. Those constructs where certain positions are fixed, such as N-fo-N phrases (e.g. kassi fo klossi (box-for-clothes) ‘wardrobe’) will be presented in the form of Booij’s (2002; 2004) constructional idioms, i.e. multiword units with certain positions fixed.
5.6. Conclusion
This chapter started out with the discussion of the notions of ‘word-formation’, ‘word’ and ‘complex word’. It has been shown that though we can mainly rely on the syntactic notion of word throughout the present study, this notion is unable to cover the range of entities with word-like functions employed for effective communication in Early Sranan. We have seen that in the specific case of creolisation of Early Sranan (and possibly in creolisation in general) what gains importance are not only words in the traditional sense, but also strategies and units for naming and referring to things, states and processes. Since these units cannot always be regarded as words, we adopted a somewhat broader concept of wordformation which not only investigates how new words are created in a language but also what other constructions speakers may use for naming objects, states and processes.
146

It has also been made clear that the notion of ‘morpheme’ is crucial in defining the notion of ‘complex word’ and that complexity in Early Sranan can be treated in the same way as in non-creole languages. A point made essential in this respect was drawing apart etymological and morphological evidence. I have argued that words in which neither of the constituents can be identified as a unit of form and meaning from the synchronic point of view should be treated as monomorphemic in Early Sranan even if etymologically they invite morphological analysis.
Besides, major problems arising with the analysis of complex words created by affixation and compounding were discussed in general and in Early Sranan in particular. I have shown that the problem of distinguishing affixation and compounding, as well as compounding and phrasal syntax has not been satisfactorily resolved either in theoretical works or in empirical investigations. The major generalisation was that the products of affixation and the products of compounding differ in the properties of individual constituent morphemes rather than in general mechanisms and principles of their formation. In a similar vein, compounds and phrases also differ in terms of their properties, especially in the property of syntactic atomicity akin to compounds rather than phrases. However, it has also been pointed out that different syntactic constructions can be involved by the speakers to serve the naming function, typical of word-formation and thus acquire syntactic atomicity. Such constructions will be taken into analysis of Early Sranan as well.
I have demonstrated that beside these general problems, a specific problem with drawing the traditional borderlines in Early Sranan often hinges on the scarcity of information provided in the early sources. I have argued therefore that it is possible to analyse word-formation of Early Sranan without drawing the traditional borderline between derivation and compounding and compounding and syntax. Word-formation devices of Early Sranan can be regarded as a set of constructs that serve the referential, or naming, function. These constructs can then formally be presented as more or less abstract schemes. For instance, complex units that contain morphemes which fulfill functions similar to derivational affixes in other languages, such ‘agentive’, ‘augmentative’, ‘dimunitive’, etc. can be modeled as constructional idioms: multiword units with some position(s) fixed for certain morpheme(s). The same can be done for other
147

naming units with fixed positions, such as N-fo-N phrases (e.g. kassi fo klossi (box-for-clothes) ‘wardrobe’). All constructs attested in Early Sranan can then be analysed in terms of their structure, the syntactic relation between their components, the semantics of the components and the semantics of the whole construction.
Such an analysis will be done in chapter 7, after another problem arising with the analysis of Early Sranan complex words has been addressed: the problem of multifunctionality of lexical items, to which the next chapter is devoted.
148

6. Multifunctionality of lexical items in Early Sranan
6.1. Introduction
Multifunctionality, the ability of lexical items to occur in more than one syntactic position, is, according to Lefebvre (2001: 107), “a property of all human lexicons.” Multifunctionality is wide-spread in creole languages (Lefebvre 2001; Voorhoeve 1981: 25). Early Sranan does not make an exception in this respect: many lexical items in this language are attested in more than one syntactic function. Although this property of Sranan words has been touched upon or dealt with in several works (Bruyn 1995a, 1996; Plag 1993, 1994; Sebba 1981; 1986; Seuren 1986; Voorhoeve 1981), there is no detailed general account of multifunctionality in Early Sranan. Such an account is necessary in the present study for two reasons. First, multifunctionality is one of the crucial sources of expanding the lexicon and is therefore worthwhile dealing with in an investigation of word-formation. Second, the problem of assigning a lexical category to separate constituents within a complex word is a serious one in the present investigation, and this problem can be solved only when it is clear how multifunctionality can be adequately treated theoretically and practically within the present work.
The present chapter therefore deals with searching for an adequate account of multifunctionality in Early Sranan. I will first list methodological problems arising with the study of multifunctionality in Early Sranan and introduce the phenomenon of multifunctionality. I will then turn to the discussion of existing theories and accounts of word-class change phenomena without overt marking, before I finally address the question of which kind of account is optimal for the Early Sranan data. Given the limits of the present work, my discussion can hardly provide ultimate solutions to the problems raised by multifunctionality. Rather, it is aimed at showing into which direction a potential solution might go and where real problems with the existing accounts lie.

6.2. Methodological aspects of the study of multifunctionality in Early Sranan
Several methodological problems arise with the analysis of multifunctional items in Early Sranan.
The first problem lies in the not uncommon lack of examples which would allow to establish different functions and hence different properties of a multifunctional item in context. Although the sources contain examples for a number of lexical items, in most cases the context is not provided. Thus, it is often the case that the translations and syntactic category classifications given by the authors of the sources (especially Schumann and Focke) for certain items point to their multifunctional character. Unfortunately, attestations of actual usage of a given item in different functions are often missing. For instance, in the entry for the word spóiti, Focke (1855: 126) indicates that it can be the verb spuiten (‘to squirt’) and the noun spuit (‘squirt’). However, neither Focke nor the other two sources contain any sentences where the two functions are exemplified. In Schumann (1783: 181), the item tjendji is translated as tauschen (‘to change’) and Wechsel (‘change’), but only the verbal usage is demonstrated by way of examples. This raises the question whether we can rely on the information provided by the authors in those cases where examples illustrating the use of an item in a specific function are not available. Taken the general reliability of the two sources, Schumann (1783) and Focke (1855) (see chapter 4), I suggest that it makes sense to follow the linguistic knowledge of the authors in the cases where the context is not provided. Therefore, whenever I give examples of multifunctional items in the present paper, they are based not only on my own investigation of the context, but also on the information about the syntactic category provided by the authors. It must be noted, though, that in those cases where there are examples for different functions of a given item, my judgements about the type of syntactic category are based on the examples, not on the remarks of the authors. Thus, for instance, Focke (1855: 61) classifies komm, which is normally the verb ‘to come’, as an adverb ‘here’ in examples such as tjári komm (to carry-to come), and wakka komm (to walk-to come). However, in these
150

examples komm is the second verb of the serial verb construction that indicates the direction towards the point of reference (cf. Migge 2003a: 90-99).
The second problem arises with the fact that three different, chronologically heterogeneous sources have been used for the present study. Hence, there are certain discrepancies between the number and type of functions of the same lexical items in different sources. Consider the example brei in (1):

(1) a. brei

V

‘to knit’

Sch

A

‘knitted’

b. brei

V

‘to knit’

Fo

N

‘knitting’

In Schumann (1783), brei functions as a verb and as an adjectival modifier of a noun. In Focke (1855), brei is attested as a verb and a noun. This raises the question of whether the non-occurrence of the noun brei in Schumann and the adjective in Focke is accidental, or whether the noun developed after Schumann completed his dictionary. Since the answer to this question would be highly speculative, it does not seem reasonable to investigate multifunctionality in each source separately. Taken the wide range of multifunctionality in Early Sranan, it makes sense to assume in cases like brei above that it can function as a verb, a noun and an adjective in Early Sranan. Therefore the study of multifunctionality done here is general, rather than source-specific.
The final problem arises with multifunctionality within complex words. In a number of occurrences, a specific function of a word is realised not in a syntactic slot, but in a ‘word-slot’, i.e. within a complex word. Thus, the word bronn is attested as a verb in Early Sranan. However, as a part of the complex word hattibronn (heart-burn) ‘anger’ it is a noun. In such cases, I will assume that bronn can be both a noun and a verb in Early Sranan.

6.3. Identifying syntactic categories in Early Sranan
Before proceeding to the description of multifunctionality in Early Sranan, I want to show what syntactic categories can be identified in this language. The question of which criteria could be used to classify items of a given language into word classes or parts of speech is still an object of heated debate in linguistics (cf. Knobloch und Schaeder 2000, Vogel and Comrie 2000). Generally, three types of criteria can be distinguished: the morphological make-up of lexemes (e.g. the presence of inflection), their syntactic properties (different syntactic positions and functions; combinability with other lexical items) and their semantics. These criteria have been used separately and in combination with each other, which results in systems that differ in both the types and the number of word classes. Each set of criteria bears a number of problems and until now there is no adequate and uncontroversial classification (for discussion, see Evans 2000; Kaltz 2000; Knobloch and Schaeder 2000). There is a growing tendency, however, to accept that the semantic meaning of a word correlates with its syntactic behaviour (Beck 2002; Bhat 1994; Croft 2000) and that a word’s morpho-syntax is a mere overt encoding of syntactic characteristics (Croft 2000). This points to the necessity of combining the different criteria when classifying items in terms of lexical and functional categories.
Since Early Sranan, like Classical Chinese, does not mark syntactic categories morphologically, I will suggest a classification of Early Sranan lexemes based on syntactic and semantic criteria. It will become clear, however, in the course of discussion that even combining these two criteria does not always allow us to draw a clear-cut borderline between different classes of lexemes.
On the basis of syntactic and semantic characteristics, the following lexical and functional categories can be identified in Early Sranan: nouns, adjectives, verbs, numerals, prepositions, adverbs, pronouns, determiners, conjunctions. In what follows I will discuss the characteristics of each category in turn.
A great number of items in Early Sranan can take a pronominal modifier, as it is the case with the lexeme bakka ‘back’ in (2a), or occur with the definite determiner as the lexeme mann ‘man’ in (2b), or be pluralised, as boi ‘boy’ in
152

(2c). Most of them denote persons or objects. They therefore exhibit typical nominal behaviour and can be viewed as nouns:

(2) a. mi bakka hati mi

my back hurt me

‘My back hurts me.’

Schumann (1783: 9): ‘Der Rücken tut mir weh.’

b. da mann gi mi da belle

DEF man give me DEF belly

‘The man made me pregnant.’

Schumann (1783: 14): ‘Ich bin von diesem Mann schwanger.’

c. pratì

dem boi, joe no si demm de féti

separate DEF PL boy 2PL NEG see 3PL CNT fight

‘Separate the boys, don’t you see that they are fighting?’

Focke (1855: 108): ‘Scheidt die knapen, ziet gij dan niet dat zij

vechten?’

Several items denote properties and occur in the modification position in respect to a noun. This is demonstrated by means of the example of óuwroe ‘old’ in (3). Such items have traditionally been regarded as adjectives.

(3) wan óuwroe mamà INDEF old woman ‘an old woman’ Focke (1855: 94): ‘een oude bes’

Items like óuwroe, which are able to occupy the modification position in Early Sranan, are also attested in the predicative position where they take a subject and an adverbial modifier, such as so ‘so’, for instance, as it is demonstrated in (4):

153

(4) a óuwroe so té a fou 3SG old so till he be-wrinkled ‘He/she is so old that he/she is wrinkled.’ Focke (1855: 35): ‘hij (zij) is krom van ouderdom.’
Examples of the type given in (4) have been a matter of discussion in several studies of Sranan. The major problem with óuwroe and similar words, such as trange ‘strong’, kouwere ‘cold’, heh ‘high’, lála ‘raw’, blakka ‘black’, ougri ‘evil’ and many others lies in their syntactic behaviour: they can function as modifiers of nouns, which is typical of adjectives, but they can also appear in the predicative position without a copula, which is characteristic of verbs. The question therefore is whether óuwroe and similar lexical items should be regarded as verbs or as adjectives when occurring in the predicative position. In general, the problem with classifying words as adjectives in the languages of the world is not new in linguistics (Bhat 1994; Dixon 1982; Rijkhoff 2000). For modern Sranan, two distinct positions have been taken.
Advocates of the first position (Migge 2000; Sebba 1986; Winford 1993; 1997) argue that items of the óuwroe type should be regarded as verbs when occurring in the predicative position without a copula, whereas in the attributive position they should be regarded as adjectives.1 The argumentation for this position is based on a number of syntactic and semantic properties these items exhibit. Thus, when occurring in the predicative position they behave like all other verbs: they take TMA markers, they can be predicate clefted, they take adverbial modifiers, and they allow for inchoative use and occur without the copula de. When used in the modification position, on the other hand, they behave like adjectives: they can occur with other adjectives in the NP and may be modified by degree adverbs (Migge 2000: 223).
1 Note that there is a difference in terminology applied to such lexemes. Sebba (1981) calls such verbs ‘stative’, whereas Migge (2000) uses the term ‘property items’. Migge (2000: 216) shows that such verbs as óuwroe, siki ‘to be sick’, biggi ‘to be big’ etc. may display inchoative and completive meanings, and concludes that they should be regarded as non-stative. Since that is also the case with such items in Early Sranan, as it will become clear below, I will use the term ‘property items’ in the present investigation when it is necessary to differentiate between them and other, non-property verbs, such as kotti ‘to cut’.
154

Advocates of the second position (Seuren 1981; 1986) argue that adjectives in the predicative slot should be treated as adjectives with an underlying copula. This copula either fails to manifest itself or surfaces as de in some constructions, e.g. questions like O bradi a liba de? meaning ‘How broad is the river?’. Seuren insists that since the position of predication is the typical adjectival position, items like óuwroe, when occurring in this position, must be regarded as adjectives. Note that similar cases in Chinese have been approached from yet another perspective. Thus, Hengeveld (1992) suggests the existence of an intermediate category for Chinese which combines the functions of two parts of speech: the adjective and the verb.
What is the way out of the adjective-verb controversy? Following Migge (2000), Sebba (1981), and Winford (1993; 1997), I will regard Early Sranan property items as adjectives in the attributive position and as verbs in the predicative position on the basis of the following considerations. First, contrary to what Seuren reports, the predication position is prototypically verbal, and not adjectival (cf. Bhat 1994; 2000; Evans 2000: 714; Vogel 1996: 193). Bhat (2000: 53), for instance, argues that in languages with no overt distinction between nouns, verbs and adjectives, adjectives are often recategorised and decategorised as verbs when occupying the predicative position, which means that they retain some of the characteristics of their basic category, and also acquire the properties of the category which is prototypically reserved for this position. Second, Early Sranan verbs of the óuwroe-type display the typical verbal characteristics, mentioned above. Thus, e.g., they allow inchoative use. Although items that can be adjectives are attested with de as well, de serves as the continuous marker in such cases. Consider the following examples which Schumann (1783: 174) provides as a pattern:

(5) tappo de blakka tappo de krini tappo de bari

‘The heaven is getting black.’ ‘The heaven is getting clear.’ ‘The heaven is crying.’ (It is thundering.’)

De is used with bari ‘to cry’ in the examples above. However, bari is not attested as an adjective, as the remaining two lexemes, blakka ‘to be black’ and krini ‘to be clean/to be clear’. I therefore suggest that de marks continuous aspect in those
155

cases when it occurs with verbs which are also attested as adjectives. Another evidence in favour of this hypothesis is provided by the occurrence of other TMA markers with items that can be both adjectives and verbs, such as ben (< Engl. been) which is the past tense marker:

(6) No pikin siki ju ben siki NEG small illness 2SG PST be-sick ‘Not a small illness you were ill with.’ Schumann (1783: 155): ‘Du bist sehr hart krank gewesen.’

In (6) the lexeme siki ‘sick’ occurs with the past tense marker ben (< Engl. been) without any mediation through de which we would have expected if siki usually took de as a copula. This assumption is supported by such sentences as Wi ben de na hem (Schumann 1783: 27) ‘We were at his place.’ where ben is the past tense marker and de is the copula.
Another argument for viewing lexemes such as siki as verbs in the predicative position is that the Early Sranan property verbs also take adverbs as modifiers, as the adverb te moessi ‘very’ in (7) below:

(7) Joe lau

te moesi.

2SG be-crazy very

Arends (1995b: 126): ‘You are completely crazy.’

Van Dyk (c1765: 22): ‘Je bent al te gek.’

The final argument for the verbal nature of the lexemes in question is semantic. Verbs prototypically denote processes and states, while adjectives typically denote qualities and properties (cf. Vogel 1996: 193). In the example (3) above the lexeme óuwroe designates the quality of the noun it modifies, whereas in (4), it indicates the state of the referent of the subject. All in all, the observations indicate that Early Sranan property items such as óuwroe are A-V multifunctional.

156

A related problem arises with the examples in (8) below:
(8) a. go bóli dem baäna go boil DEF/PL banana ‘Go to boil the bananas.’ Focke (1855: 15): ‘Ga die Banannen koken.’
b. bóli-wátra boil water ‘boiled water’ Focke (1855: 15): ‘gekookt water’
In (8a) we have the verb which occurs in the predicative position, in (8b) we have the same lexeme boli, but in the modifying position in a NP. This problem resembles the one with classifying participles in English where they exhibit both adjectival and verbal characteristics (cf. Bhat 1994: 141-143). Bhat argues that this problem can hardly be solved unless we postulate some intermediate stages in de- and re-categorisation of lexemes. I do not consider postulating an intermediate category necessary since, like in the case of property items above, several observations help to keep the two categories apart. I will treat the first members in NPs such as in (8b) as adjectives for three reasons. First, they appear in the modification position which I have shown to be prototypical for adjectives. Second, following Bhat (1994: 43-44), I will argue that, like prototypical adjectives, they denote permanent properties and are dependent on nouns. Verbs, on the contrary, designate changing processes or events and are not dependent on other items in a sentence. The third argument is based on headedness. If the first components in the examples of the type as in (8b) are verbs, the whole phrase must be a VP, and thus left-headed. What we have in (8b) is, however, a rightheaded NP, which suggests that boli is an adjective in (8b).
Yet another similar problem arises in differentiating nouns and adjectives in the modification position. Here, two different cases can be singled out. On the one hand, there are items like soutu, which can be a noun, ‘salt’, an adjective, ‘salted’, and a verb, ‘to be salted/to salt’, i.e. these items form a multifunctional string N-A-V. The use of soutu in the modifying position is demonstrated in (9a) below. On the other hand, there are cases like djoe, which can be a noun, ‘Jew’,
157

and an adjective, ‘Jewish’, according to a remark made by Focke (1855: 24), but which is not attested as a verb. So djoe must be a part of a N-A multifunctional set.
(9) a. soutu meti salt/salted meat ‘salted meat’ Schumann (1783: 164): ‘Salzfleisch, Pöckelfleisch’
b. wan Djoé-misi INDEF Jew/Jewish woman ‘a Jewish woman’ Focke (1855: 24): ‘eene jodin’
Again, since the items in (9) are multifunctional in Early Sranan, and since there is no morphological marking of syntactic categories, it is difficult to decide what syntactic category soutu in (9a) and djoé in (9b) should be assigned: adjective or noun. Traditionally, several criteria have been advanced to hold nouns in the modification position apart from adjectives.
Bhat (1994: 31) suggests that adjectives denote a property whereas nouns introduce a participant. Applying this to the two cases above would lead to the classification of soutu as an adjective, since it indicates that the noun meti ‘meat’ has the property of being salted. The case of djoe, however, is still controversial: it is unclear whether it introduces a participant or denotes a property of being Jewish. Another difference between the two classes is pointed out by Wierzbicka (1980: 468) who argues that nouns denote a large number of properties, whereas adjectives denote a single property. In the two examples above, soutu should then be regarded as an adjective since it denotes a single property, that of being salted, rather than the properties of the noun ‘salt’, whereas it is again unclear in the case of djoe whether it denotes a single property of being Jewish or a class of properties associated with ‘Jew’.
Since the semantic properties do not yield a clear solution, we might try the syntactic evidence. Huddleston and Pullum (2002: 536-538) argue for English that there is no predicative construction for nouns occurring as modifiers of nouns, as the following examples show: a red jacket – the jacket is red vs. a government
158

inquiry – *the inquiry is government. Testing the Early Sranan data in this way leads to interesting results. Indeed, we can create a predicative construction with the item soutu: meti soutu meaning ‘meat is salted’. This is possible exactly because soutu is a member of the multifunctional set N-A-V, and thus can also be a verb meaning ‘to be salted’. However, in the case of djoe, such a construction is not attested, and it is unclear whether an item such as djoe can be used as a verb meaning ‘to be Jewish’. The following explanation for this phenomenon can be advanced. In Early Sranan, there are no non-multifunctional adjectives whereas there are a lot of items that are non-multifunctional nouns. Early Sranan items corresponding to English adjectives such as ill, good, bad, beautiful, are never independent, i.e. they occur only as parts of multifunctional sets necessarily including verbs, and often also nouns. Thus, for instance, the Early Sranan reti is attested in the modification position and may have the typical adjectival meaning ‘right/correct’. But it is also attested as a noun, ‘right’, and as the verb ‘to be right/to be correct’. The same is true for many other lexemes with typical adjectival meanings and functions, such as siki ‘ill’, pikin ‘small’, moi ‘beautiful’, tru ‘true’, tschattu ‘short’, langa ‘long’, koure ‘cold’ etc. Similarly, items corresponding to participles in English, such as boiled, salted, roasted, singing are also available in Early Sranan, and also only as parts of multifunctional sets V-A, as e.g. brokko meaning ‘to break’ and ‘broken’, or bákka ‘to bake’ and ‘baked’. In contrast, items such as djoe, but also izri ‘iron’, iéngí ‘Indian’, góutoe ‘gold/golden’ which are classified by the sources as both nouns and adjectives2, are not attested as verbs: whereas phrases like wan izri-pattoe and wan góutoe riénga are attested in Focke (1855: 49; 39), sentences like *da pattoe izri meaning ‘this pot is of iron’ or *da riénga góutoe meaning ‘this ring is golden’, where izri and góutoe could be used predicatively without a copula and take a subject, are not attested. To sum up, I assume that all Sranan adjectives allow predicative use as verbs, and the majority of verbs allow modification use as adjectives. For the distinction between adjectives and nouns in the modifying position, this has the consequence that the ability to occur as a verb is indicative of the adjectival status
2 Note that there is a certain difference between the sources as far as this classification is concerned. Thus, Schumann (1783: 74; 32) translates Indjin, Dju as nouns only, but Focke (1855: 48; 23) classifies them as both adjectives and nouns. However, both sources are similar in providing a nominal and an adjectival translation for izri and góutoe.
159

since almost all adjectives can be verbs, and vice versa. Therefore, whenever a word occurring in the modification position to a noun is not attested as a verb in Early Sranan, it will be regarded as a noun.
Another criterion that can be used to differentiate nouns and adjectives in the modification position is the following. Adjectives that allow for verbal use also allow for the use in the nominalising construction with the postposed pronoun wan ‘one’, as e.g. wan biggiwan ‘a big one’, lossiwan ‘roasted one’, moiwan ‘beautiful one’3. Items like djoe, izri, etc. are not attested in this construction: *djoewan, *izriwan. This is again indicative of their nominal nature.
The discussion so far has shown that because one and the same item can occur in different syntactic positions in Early Sranan, a clear-cut border between different categories is sometimes difficult to draw. This problem also arises in complex words where multifunctional items occur in the modification position. I will identify the syntactic categories of elements in complex words along the lines suggested above.
Beside nouns and adjectives there are a number of items that share some features with these two classes, but also exhibit some distinct properties. For this reason, I will distinguish the class of numerals in Early Sranan. Syntactically Early Sranan numerals behave either like nouns serving as heads of the noun phrases, as in (10a), or like adjectives, modifying a noun, as in (10b). The syntactic behaviour of numerals has been taken as a ground to regard them as a subclass of nouns (Greenberg 2000: 770). However, semantically numerals differ both from nouns, which denote objects, and from adjectives, which denote qualities, in that numerals designate ordering and indicate a property of a set of objects (Greenberg 2000: 770). Besides, the position of the numerals in Early Sranan is not exactly the same as that of adjectives since numerals precede adjectives in noun phrases, as is shown in (10c).
3 Determiners can also be used in this construction, as e.g. alla meaning ‘all’: allawan (Schumann 1783: 49).
160

(10) a. toe joe ben hábi, en wan mi gi joe de, a komm dri two 1SG PST have and one 1SG give 2SG there 3SG come three ‘You had two, and I gave you one, together it makes three.’ Focke (1855: 61): ‘Twee hadt gij er reeds, nu geef ik u er een bij, – dat maakt drie.’
b. Mi za kom bakke toe offe drie moen. 1SG FUT come back two or three month Arends (1995b: 144): ‘I’ll be back in two or three months.’ Van Dyk (c1765: 33): ‘Ik kom over twee of drie Maanden weêrom.’
c. effi tu tarra somma go if two other people go ‘If two other people go.’ Schumann (1783: 189): ‘Wenn 2 andere Leute gehen.’

Apart from numerals, there is another group of items that is similar to nouns, but deserves a category of its own: pronouns. As in many other languages of the world, pronouns in Early Sranan replace noun phrases. Early Sranan pronouns can be divided into several sub-classes: personal pronouns, such as mi ‘I’ in (11a), demonstrative pronouns, such as datti ‘that’ in (11b), indefinite pronouns, such as ini-wan ‘anyone’ in (11c), interrogative pronouns as in (11d) and relative pronouns, as in (11e):

(11) a. b.

161

c. Gi mi ini-wan

Arends (1995b: 120): ‘Whose child?’

e. a go we lange den bakkera

Van Dyk (c1765: 93): ‘Hy is uitgegaan met de Blanken, die hier

geweest zyn.’

Another class of words which shares its modification position with adjectives, but has its own distinctive characteristics, is that of determiners. In Early Sranan they often serve as indicators of reference and/or definiteness4. Some determiners, such as da ‘the’, wan ‘a’ and alla ‘all’, usually occur in the outmost position in the NP, others such as disi ‘this’ appear both pre- and post-positionally. The determiner datti ‘that’, which is attested in the determiner function in Focke (1855) only, also occurs post-positionally. According to Bruyn (1995a: 129-130; 1998: 34), this post-position might have been influenced by the substratum. The examples in (12) demonstrate the different types of determiners in Early Sranan:

(12) a.

hutem da biggi areên sa setti? QM-time DEF big rain FUT to start ‘When will the big rain-season begin?’ Schumann (1783: 7): ‘Wann wird die große Regenzeit anfangen?’

4 For details on the functions of determiners, see Bruyn (1995a).
162

b. Joe za jam ale da briddi. 1SG FUT eat all DEF bread ‘Will you eat all that bread?’ Arends (1995b: 135): ‘Are you going to eat all that bread?’ Van Dyk (c1765: 27): ‘Zal je al dat Brood Eeten.’

d. dissi netti mi drem this night 1SG dream ‘I dreamt this night.’ Schumann (1783: 36): ‘Diese Nacht träumte ich.’
e. da Ningre dissi DEF Black this ‘this Black’ Schumann (1783: 32): ‘dieser Neger’
f. da wan tákroe doe datti it-be INDEF evil deed that ‘That is bad behaviour.’ Focke (1855: 24): ‘Dat zijn slechte manieren.’
Verbs is another category amply represented in Early Sranan. Verbs occupy the predication position, and semantically express processes and actions. They can be transitive, as in (13a), and intransitive, as in (13b):
(13) a. dem fumm mi 3PL beat 1SG ‘They have beaten me.’ Schumann (1783: 47): ‘Ich bin geschlagen worden.’
163

b. hufa

ju de gaku so?

QM-manner 2SG CNT stutter so

‘Why are you stuttering in such a way?’

Schumann (1783: 49): no translation provided

A number of items in Early Sranan can be classified as adverbs since they modify VPs, as is shown by the example of zo in (14a), or adjectives, as zo in (14b), or whole clauses, as the lexeme issredei ‘yesterday’ in (14c):

(14) a. hoe fa

joe kan takki zo

QM fashion 2SG can talk so

‘How can you say so?’

Arends (1995b: 163): ‘How can you say that?’

Van Dyk (c1765: 46): ‘How kan U Ed. zulks zeggen.’

b. Mi slibi zo lange tem

1SG sleep so long time

‘Did I sleep for so long time?’

Arends (1995b: 183): ‘Did I sleep for so long?’

Van Dyk (c1765: 63): ‘Heb ik zoo lang Geslaapen.’

c. issredeh mi planti da siri

yesterday 1SG plant DEF seed

‘I planted the seeds yesterday.’

Schumann (1783: 139): ‘Gestern habe ich den Saamen gesäet, od.

die Körnen gesteckt.’

Prepositions can also be distinguished as a class in Early Sranan on the basis of their ability to take an NP complement and to function as indicators of discourse roles. In (15) several examples are provided:

(15) a. b. c.

Potti hatti na hede. put hat on head ‘Put a hat on the head.’ Arends (1995b: 124): ‘Put on your hat.’ Van Dyk (c1765: 20): ‘Zet uw Hoed op.’ wan va dem ben du one of 3PL PST do ‘One of them did it.’ Schumann (1783: 191): ‘Einer von Ihnen hats getan.’ pótti na táppoe táfra put on top table ‘Put (it) on the table.’ Focke (1855: 86): ‘Zet het op de tafel.’

The last example needs a more careful examination. Since the lexeme táppoe (< Engl. top) is also attested as a noun, ‘top/heaven’, there has been a discussion as to whether táppoe and similar items, such as fesi ‘face/in front of’, middri ‘middle/in the middle of’, bakka ‘back/behind/after’ etc. that exhibit similar behaviour, should be regarded as prepositions when occurring in the position between the preposition na ‘on/at/in’ and a noun. The nominal use of táppoe is exemplified in (16):

(16) A didón na mi táppoe 3SG sit on my top ‘He/she/it sits on me/on my top.’ Focke (1855: 132): ‘Hij (zij, het) ligt op mij.’

A comprehensive analysis of examples of the táppoe-type is suggested in Plag (1994). On the basis of various syntactic tests (independent occurrence as a sentence fragment, coordination, stranding, pied-piping) Plag suggests that táppoe in sentences of the kind as in (15c) must be regarded as a preposition that takes the complement NP táfra. According to Plag (1994: 339), the structure of the phrases of the type na táppoe táfra can be presented as follows (exemplified here on the basis of (15c):
165

(17) [PP na [PP táppoe [NP táfra]]]
Bruyn (1996: 33) suggests that locative items like táppoe or bak(k)a ‘behind’ should be regarded as compound prepositions when they occur with the preposition na ‘on/at/to’, and as simple prepositions when they occur without na, which is, however, only the case in the 20th century. For the sake of simplicity, I will call táppoe and bakka prepositions, bearing in mind that in this function they always occur with na.
Finally, there is a group of items that serve to subordinate or coordinate two or more clauses within a sentence. Semantically, they express disjunctive, copulative, adversative, temporal etc. relations between clauses. This is demonstrated by the examples of kaba ‘but/and’ in (18a), bifósi ‘before’ and tê ‘till’ in (18b) and (18c):
(18) a. ju teki sanni, kaba ju no pai mi 1SG take thing but 2SG NEG pay 1SG ‘You take things, but you do not pay.’ Schumann (1783: 129): no translation provided
b. Aránja moe groen, bifósi a lépi orange must be-green before 3SG be-ripe ‘An orange must be green, before it becomes ripe.’ Focke (1855: 11): ‘Een oranjeappel moet eerst groen zijn, eer hij rijp wordt.’
c. Tê joe kabà, joe kann go. when 2SG finish 2SG can go ‘When you have finished, you can go.’ Focke (1855: 133): ‘Als gij ‘t afhebt, kunt gij gaan.’
Items like those in (18) have been traditionally classified as conjunctions. Within such a traditional approach, prepositions are argued to take NPs, PPs, AdvPs, and AdjPs as complements, whereas conjunctions take clauses as complements. Thus, before in (19a) below takes a NP complement and is thus regarded as a preposition, whereas in (19b) it is regarded as a conjunction since it has a clause complement:
166

(19) a. They wanted to arrive before dawn. b. Before they went back to Italy, they visited Mary.
However, this distinction has become a matter of dispute. Huddleston and Pullum (2002: 599-600), for instance, argue that there is no principled ground to draw the borderline between prepositions and conjunctions which is based on the difference in the types of complements the two take. In this connection Huddleston and Pullum show a parallel to verbs which generally can take both NP and clause complements, and which are not divided into two different lexical categories on this ground. In the present study, however, I will differentiate between prepositions and conjunctions in Early Sranan for two reasons. Firstly, although there are cases in Early Sranan where the same item can take both NP and clausal complements, such as tê in (18c), there are also items that are not used to connect NPs, as e.g. kaba ‘and/but’ in (18a). Thus, for instance, to connect two NPs the preposition nanga ‘with’ is used, and not kaba. Another reason is that I believe it makes sense to distinguish the two groups on semantics grounds. Whereas prepositions denote relations, especially between participants in a discourse, conjunctions connect propositions in Early Sranan.
As a conclusion, I have shown that it is often difficult to draw a clear-cut distinction between different categories especially in a language where morphological criteria cannot be applied. However, in many cases a combination of both syntactic and semantic criteria brings more light into the nature of the items under analysis. The classification provided allows us to show in the next section how the phenomenon of multifunctionality manifests itself in Early Sranan, and in what combinations lexical and functional categories identified above occur in the Early Sranan sources.
167

6.4. The phenomenon and the range of multifunctionality in Early Sranan
It became clear in the previous section already that one and the same lexeme in Early Sranan can occur in several different syntactic slots thus exhibiting multifunctionality. In the present section, I will first present a typical example of a multifunctional lexeme and then show what multifunctional sets are attested in Early Sranan. Besides, I will draw parallels between the multifunctional sets and items in Early Sranan and its substratum languages to be able to make suggestions on the potential source of multifunctionality in Early Sranan.
The lexical item pikin (< Portug. pequeno) is one of the most vivid examples of multifunctionality: it occurs in four different syntactic slots, fulfils four different syntactic functions and has four distinct semantic properties. Thus, it can be identified as a noun in Early Sranan since it denotes a person and can take a pronominal modifier, as in (20a), or occur with the definite determiner as in (20b), or be pluralised as in (20c):
(20) a. da mi pikin it-be my child ‘That is my child.’ Schumann (1783: 135): ‘Das ist mein Kind.’
b. da pikin dringi bobbi DEF child drink breast ‘The child drinks from the breast.’ Schumann (1783: 19): ‘Das Kind trinkt an der Brust.’
c. dem pikin DEF PL child ‘the children’ Schumann (1783: 29): ‘die Kinder’
The same lexical item can designate a property and modify a noun thus functioning as an adjective, as is illustrated in (21):
168

(21) wan pikin hangisa INDEF small towel ‘a small towel’ Schumann (1783: 136): ‘ein kleines Tuch’
Pikin can also denote a state, take a subject and be modified by an adverb thus displaying a behaviour typical of verbs, as in (22):
(22) da hosso pikin tumussi DEF house be-small very much ‘The house is too small.’ Schumann (1783: 136): ‘das Haus ist allzuklein.’
Besides, pikin can also modify a VP, as in (23a), or an adjective, as in (23b). In these two positions it provides additional information about the event expressed by the predicate fumm ‘to beat’, as in (23a), or about the property expressed by the adjective langa ‘long’, as in (23b). In these two cases pikin functions as an adverb.
(23) a. fumm hem pikin beat 3SG a little ‘Beat him a little.’ Schumann (1783: 136): ‘Schlag ihn ein bisgen!’
b. mi wanni wan pikin-langawan 1SG want INDEF a little long-one ‘I want a bit long one.’ Schumann (1783: 195): ‘Ich möchte einen etwas langen (z.B. Stock).’
In sum, the lexical item pikin has the same form, but can occur in different syntactic slots and should therefore be identified as multifunctional. Beside the set of the type N-A-V-Adv, there is a whole range of other sets in Early Sranan that encompass both lexical and functional categories. These sets will be discussed below.
Thus, there are quite a number of units in Early Sranan that can be used as both nouns and verbs, as is presented in (24):
169

(24) a. drinki V

N

b. du

V

N

c. wánni V

N

‘to drink’ ‘drink’ ‘to do’ ‘deed’ ‘to want’ ‘will/desire’

Verbs in multifunctional chains as in (24) can belong to different subcategories. Thus, the word bronn, beside functioning as a noun, is attested as a transitive, and an intransitive verb:

(25) bronn

Vtr/Vintr N

‘to burn/to burn/to be burnt’ ‘burning’

An interesting comparison to substratum languages can be drawn in this respect. In Ewe and Fongbe, nouns can be created from verbs through reduplication and often denote results or actions expressed by the corresponding verbs, as e.g. gba@ ‘to construct’, gbı-$ gba@ ‘construction’ (Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 200; also Westermann 1907: 67). In Early Sranan, in contrast, reduplication as a device for forming nouns from verbs is unproductive, whereas multifunctionality is preferred. Remarkably, Clark (1993: 116-117) reports a similar phenomenon for first language acquisition: children acquiring English as their first language, often use noun-roots to designate an activity into which the object expressed by the noun is involved, such as to button in the meaning ‘to press the button on a calculator’, to flag ‘to wave like a flag’, to cello ‘to play the cello’, to key ‘to put a key into’. This can be explained first, by the fact that the input children get contains such items, and second, by the structural simplicity of such items in comparison to the root-affix combinations which can be sometimes marred by morphophonological processes. Therefore, on the one hand, we can assume that the preference for multifunctionality might be a phenomenon characteristic of the initial stages of acquisition. On the other hand, however, despite the preference for reduplication as a device for creating nouns from verbs, some of the substratum

170

languages, for instance, Ewe, do have some N-V multifunctional sets (Schlegel 1856: 18), as is shown in (26):

(26) fia

N

V

gbe

N

V

gbo

N

V

nyi

N

‘king’ ‘to lead’ ‘word/language’ ‘to say/to talk’ ‘side’ ‘to come/to arrive’ ‘awareness/knowledge’ ‘to know/to understand’

It means that the preference for multifunctionality in Early Sranan might have had multiple reasons: the availability of similar multifunctional items in the substratum, structural simplicity of such structures and the lack of nominalising reduplication in the target variety.
Other frequent instances of multifunctionality are units that can be used as verbs and adjectives, as in (27):

(27) a. rosi b. lépi

Vtr/Vintr A Vintr A

‘to roast/to be roasted’ ‘roasted’ ‘to be, to become ripe’ ‘ripe’

Multifunctional chains including adjectives and verbs, especially property verbs, also have parallels in Gbe varieties. Migge (2000) shows that the syntactic and semantic characteristics of what she calls ‘property items’, i.e. items that can occur as attributive adjectives and verbs, are very similar in Ndyuka and several Gbe varieties. One significant difference lies in the fact that most Gbe verbs are reduplicated when occurring in the attributive position (Migge 2000: 227, also Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 349 for Fongbe, Westermann 1907: 67; 77 for Ewe), as it was the case with V-N multifunctional sets above. As Migge (2000: 230) suggests, the unreduplicated form of attributive adjectives in Surinamese Plantation Creole might have been modeled on the pidgin or second-language
171

varieties of English. However, Christaller (1875: 47) shows that in another substratum language of Early Sranan, Twi, verbs and adjectives can appear both reduplicated and unreduplicated when occurring predicatively and attributively, as the following examples show:
(28) a. obó dènnén5* ‘a hard stone’ b. n*kõdén* ‘a hard fighting’ c. dadé yè den* ‘iron is hard’

In (28) the property item den* ‘hard’ appears both reduplicated and unreduplicated in the attributive position. This again means that the appearance of Early Sranan adjectives in the unreduplicated form might have been influenced by a number of different factors.
A considerable number of multifunctional items functioning as verbs and adjectives are also attested as nouns and, in some cases, as adverbs:

(29) a. krien b. krukkutu

A

‘clean/pure/clear/light’

Vintr/Vtr ‘to be clean or pure/to clean/to shine’

N

‘light/shine’

A

‘crooked/wrong’

Vintr

‘to be crooked, wrong’

N

‘injustice’

Adv ‘wrong’

Several items function as an adjective, an adverb, and a verb, as is illustrated in (30):

(30) a. róntoe

A

‘round’

Adv ‘around/round about’

V

‘to stand around/to surround’

5 Hereafter, the dot above a letter in the substratum sources is rendered as *on technical grounds.
172

b. nuffe

A

‘enough/many’

Adv ‘enough’

V

‘to be enough’

In respect to the sets in (29) and (30), a note on the parallels to the substratum should be made. Thus, Ewe has a very similar item to the Early Sranan krien in (29a) (Schlegel 1856: 251):

(31) kò kòkò kòkò

V

‘to shine’

A

‘clear/light/shining/holly’

N

‘light/shine’

The difference again lies in the fact that the Early Sranan krien has the same unreduplicated form in all the three functions, whereas the Ewe verb kò is reduplicated to become an adjective or a noun. This example in general shows that some of the multifunctional items might have been the result of transfer from the substratum languages and the subsequent restructuring of reduplicated forms into unreduplicated ones, possibly under the influence of both the models from the target variety and factors such as structural simplicity.
Note that other substratum languages also have similar multifunctional sets. Christaller (1875: 47) shows that some Twi adjectives can be used as verbs, nouns, and adverbs. In some cases, they have a reduplicated form. This is illustrated by the example of the Twi items den* ‘hard’ and fè (few) ‘fine/nice’ in (32):

(32) a. obó dènnén* nk* õdén* dadé yè den* né dén* óhyèno denné(nn)ennen*

‘a hard stone’ ‘a hard fighting’ ‘iron is hard’ ‘his hardness’ ‘he forces him very hard’

173

b. mfoníni fèfé agoruféw duá yi yè fe né féw wógòru feféfe

‘a fine picture’ ‘a fine play’ ‘this tree is fine’ ‘its beauty’ ‘they play very nicely’

According to Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 384), some Fongbe verbs, nouns, and adjectives can be used as adverbs, as it is shown in (33):

(33) a. suk$ pç@

V

‘to be numerous’

Adv

‘a lot’

b. nu$gbo@

N

‘truth’

c. xwı@ ı@

Adv

‘frankly’

A

‘quiet’

Adv

‘quietly’

The parallels between Early Sranan and its substratum languages again allow the suggestion that substratum influence might have played a role in the emergence of multifunctionality of Early Sranan items.
A small number of Early Sranan words can occupy the syntactic position of both a preposition and a noun. Some of such words are additionally attested as adverbs and/or adjectives:

(34) a. tappo b. bilo c. bákka

N

‘top/heaven’

Prep

‘on/on top of’

N

‘the under side’

Adv

‘below’

N

‘back/the back part’

Prep (with na- ‘on’) ‘after/behind’

Adv

‘back/again’

A

‘back/last’

174

Items that are attested as both nouns and prepositions are also attested in Ewe and Fongbe, two of Early Sranan’s substratum languages. Thus, e.g. the Ewe item megbé occurs as both a noun, ‘back’, and a preposition, ‘behind’ (Heine, Claudi and Hünnemeyer 1991: 134, a detailed account of the parallels may be found in Bruyn 1996: 36-37). Fongbe has a number of postpositions that have a corresponding noun, such as ta$ ‘at the top of/head’, glu@w$ ‘under/bottom’ or tE@ntìn ‘in the middle of/centre/middle’ (Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 323).
Several verbs are also attested in the function of conjunctions. Thus, the verb tak(k)i ‘to say/to talk’ can also function as a noun and as a conjunction:

(35) tak(k)i

V

N

Conj

‘to say/to mean’ ‘talk’ ‘that’

Takki is identical in its syntactic behaviour to corresponding items in one of its substratum languages, Fongbe. Thus, according to Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 115), complements of the verbs of saying such as ‘to remember’, ‘to say’, ‘to see’, ‘to think’, ‘to know’ are introduced by the conjunction › which at the same time is the verb ‘to say’.
The Early Sranan word leki is attested as a verb, a conjunction and as a preposition:

(36) leki

V

‘to resemble/to be similar to’

Prep

‘like/than’

Conj

‘than/like/as’

The item kaba, besides being a verb and a conjunction, can also be an adverb:

(37) kaba

V

‘to finish/to be finished’

Adv

‘already’

Conj

‘but/and’

175

Cases where verbs are used as adverbs are also attested in the substratum. Thus, e.g. the Fongbe verb dın@ can be both the verb ‘to surpass’ and the adverb ‘too much’ (Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 384).
A few other sets also present a mixture of lexical and functional categories. The item tê is attested as a preposition, a conjunction and an adverb.

(38) tê

Conj

Prep

Adv

‘till’ ‘till’ ‘much/for a long’

A number of sets comprise primarily functional categories. Thus, the lexeme wan has three different functions, as in (39):

(39) wan

Det Pron Num

‘a’ ‘one’ ‘one’

Interestingly, in Fongbe, according to Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 39), the indefinite determiner e@ seems to be the reduced form of the numeral o@ e@ ‘one’.
The lexeme morro is attested as an adverb and a determiner:

(40) morro Det Adv

‘more’ ‘more’

Some multifunctional sets include items of functional categories only. Bruyn (1998) argues that Early Sranan dissi can be a relativiser and a conjunction. It can also be a demonstrative pronoun:

(41) dissi Det Pron Conj

‘this’ ‘who/the one(s) that’ ‘when/since/because/while’

176

According to Bruyn (1998: 30), the functions of dissi have direct correspondences in several substratum languages of Early Sranan, such as Ewe, Gbe and Kikongo. As Bruyn shows, in Ewe, e.g. the demonstrative pronoun es@ ı$ can also be a conjunction meaning ‘when/since/because/while’ (cf. also Westermann 1907: 6162).
As a summary, the common multifunctional sets attested in Early Sranan are listed in (42)6. Note that the order of the categories in the set is random and has been arranged to achieve a better overview. Therefore, it should not be interpreted as an indication of a derivational direction.

As I have shown in the present section, many of the sets and individual items discussed in the present section have striking parallels in the substratum languages of Early Sranan. This points to the fact that the multifunctionality of a number of Early Sranan items has its roots in the substratum languages and is the result of transfer of multifunctional items from the native languages of creole creators. This

6 This list has no pretension to be exhaustive. It serves to demonstrate how wide the range of the phenomenon of multifunctionality is in Early Sranan. A more extensive and detailed investigation of multifunctional sets in Early Sranan is still a task for the future.
177

is a very important observation for the kind of argument I will develop in the present chapter with respect to the optimal multifunctionality approach, to which I will turn later.
6.5. Theoretical problems with the study of multifunctionality in Early Sranan
The wide range of multifunctionality in Early Sranan raises the question which theoretical perspective can optimally account for this phenomenon.
Until now I have used the term ‘multifunctionality’ to describe multiple word-class phenomena of Early Sranan. However, there are quite a number of other terms, such as ‘transcategoriality’, ‘categorial underspecification’, ‘zeroderivation’, ‘conversion’, ‘functional shift’, or ‘recategorisation’ that have been used to describe the process of word-class change without overt marking (cf. Bauer 2003: 38; Vogel 1996). Although some of these terms, such as ‘multifunctionality’ and ‘transcategoriality’, are used interchangeably, most of them reflect essentially different concepts of approaching one and the same phenomenon.
The terms ‘multifunctionality’ and ‘transcategoriality’ are often used to refer to languages such as Chinese where almost every lexeme is attested in different syntactic functions. Multifunctionality and transcategoriality are defined as indeterminacy of lexical items with respect to their occurrence in a specific syntactic function (Bisang forthcoming; Vogel 1996: 231). Vogel (1996: 231) argues that it is more reasonable to speak of multifunctionality than of word-class change in those cases where there is much overlap between different categories. Whereas the two terms are primarily used to describe the phenomenon itself, the term ‘underspecification’ is used to denote an approach according to which multifunctional items are conceptualised as being semantically and/or syntactically underspecified with respect to the functional distinction. The concept of underspecification treats word-class change as an essentially lexical process.
A different concept lies behind the term ‘conversion’. Conversion is viewed as ‘the derivation of a new word without any overt marking’ (Plag 2003c:
178

107). The crucial aspect here is that the phenomenon of word-class change is regarded as a morphological process by which a new lexeme is derived without any change in form. Although there is much confusion in the use of the term ‘conversion’, since many linguists often apply it as a cover term for word-class change phenomena without overt marking, I will use this term in the meaning ‘directional derivational process’ throughout the present investigation.
Zero derivation is another concept used in connection with the change of word-class without any overt marking. Within this concept the process of wordclass change is viewed as a derivational (affixational) process by which a zero morph is attached to a base word. This zero morph has a certain meaning or function, like any ‘non-zero’ affix, but no overt form (Bauer 2003: 37; Plag 2003c: 111). Thus, in the case of the Sranan example pikin above, one would assume that one of the pikin-words, e.g. the noun, is the base, whereas all the other pikin-words: the adjective, the verb and the adverb are derivatives formed by attaching a zero morph. Although the concepts of conversion and zero derivation are different, they have one feature in common: both of them bear the idea of word-class change being a kind of derivational, and thus word-formation process, similar to other derivational processes, such as affixation.
The question that arises now is under which concept word-class change phenomena in Early Sranan, such as pikin, can be described. Two hypotheses can be developed in this connection. On the one hand, we might suggest that there are four different lexical items that have the same overt form pikin and that one of them is the derivational basis for all the other. This would lead us to the assumption that pikin is built by zero derivation or conversion and consequently we would have to establish the derivational rules and the derivational basis for the morphological process by which the transformation of pikin into a noun, an adjective, a verb, and an adverb takes place. On the other hand, taken the pervasiveness of multifunctionality in Early Sranan, one could assume that items such as pikin have one lexical entry and are semantically and syntactically underspecified. In this case, the challenge is to find a proper description of this underspecification.
In what follows I will give regard to both hypotheses in order to find out which of them allows a more suitable account of multifunctionality phenomena in Early Sranan.
179

6.6. Multifunctionality as a morphological process
6.6.1. The concept of zero derivation
As I have already mentioned above, the concept of zero derivation presupposes the existence of zero morphs. It is generally acknowledged that the postulation of a zero morph makes sense in those cases where there is a corresponding overt form that serves the same function or bears the same meaning (Marchand 1969: 360; Plag 2003c: 111). Thus, the morphological analysis of the verb to hospitalise shows that it has been created from the noun hospital by means of attaching the derivational suffix -ise that transforms nouns into verbs and has the meaning ‘to put into’. By virtue of similarity, the advocates of the zero derivation account would analyse the verb to can as formed from the noun can by means of the zero morph with the same meaning.
Beside some general problems connected with this type of argumentation (Don, Trommelen, and Zonnenveld 2000; Plag 2003c), applying this kind of analysis to the Early Sranan data bears one major problem. This problem is that in most cases no corresponding overt affixes exist in Early Sranan.7 For instance, in the example pikin treated above the zero derivation analysis would mean looking for three different overt affixes that transform nouns into adjectives, adverbs, and verbs respectively. Or, if we assume that the verb or the adjective might have served as the basis of derivation in the case of pikin, we must then look for affixes that derive either nouns, adjectives, and adverbs from verbs, or nouns, verbs, and adverbs from adjectives. In fact, no such affixes are attested in Early Sranan. The only morpheme which can be regarded as an suffix, the person marker -man that transforms adjectives, nouns and verbs into nouns, has no ‘zero parallel’ since there is no multifunctional string where the derived noun has the same meaning as the man-complex words. There are, however, certain parallels to reduplication. A number of nouns with instrumental and result meanings are produced by reduplication, such as zibi zibi (N) ‘broom’ from zibi (V) ‘to wipe’ or fom fom (N) ‘beating’ from fom (V) ‘to beat’. However, as the number of such reduplications
7 Remarkably, Sanders (1988: 168) points to the same problem in Chinese which exhibits multifunctionality in a way similar to Early Sranan.
180

remained almost constant in all the three sources (cf. also Smith 1990: 265), such formations can be regarded as being unproductive. There are also attestations of several adjectives created from verbs via reduplication, such as brokko-broko (A) ‘broken’ from brokko (V) ‘to break’ and a few reduplicated adverbs formed from adjectives, such as krien krien (Adv) ‘very closely’ from krien (A) ‘clean’. If we regard reduplication as a type of affixation (cf. Lieber 1992), then we might argue that there are two overt affixes creating adjectives and adverbs from verbs and adjectives respectively. Consequently, we could also assume that there are corresponding zero affixes. However, such a line of argumentation bears a number of problems. For the case of pikin and similar items we must admit then that pikin (A) and pikin (V) are created via zero derivation, but pikin (N) by some different process, which is not logical. Besides, a number of other multifunctional sets, such as N-Prep-A, or V-Conj have no corresponding overt affixes, be they reduplicated or non-reduplicated. These considerations rule out the application of the concept of zero derivation to Early Sranan data.
6.6.2. The concept of conversion
According to the concept of conversion, multifunctional strings of the type pikin should be viewed as created by a morphological process where one lexeme is the basis of derivation and all the other are derivatives. Therefore, within such an approach, the primacy is given to establishing the derivational direction and the rules of derivation.
It is generally assumed that there are a number of criteria by which directionality of conversion can be established (Plag 2003c: 108-111). I will discuss each of them in turn pointing to the specific problems arising for the Early Sranan data.
The first criterion is based on tracing the historical evidence for establishing the basis of derivation. Thus, in the case of pikin, it would mean that we should search the sources to find out whether the verb, the noun, the adjective, or the adverb was attested first. This is not an easy task. Three major problems arise here. The first problem lies in the lack of sufficient data to make reliable judgments. Thus, the word wassi is attested as a verb, ‘to wash’, in Van Dyk
181

(c1765: 26), and it is attested as both the noun ‘washing/wash’, and the verb ‘to wash’ in Schumann (1783: 297). Etymologically, one might argue that the direction of conversion would be verb to noun, since Van Dyk is an earlier source and he lists the word wassi only as a verb. However, this seems to be a vacuous argument since it might be a mere coincidence that certain words were not included in one of the sources. Moreover, the size of the sources plays an important role here as well. Thus, the earliest source, Van Dyk, is the smallest one, whereas the latest, Focke, is the largest one in terms of the number of types and tokens (see chapter 4). It seems natural then that the possibility to encounter new words in Focke is greater.
Or consider the somewhat different example of hebbi for which Schumann (1783) provides three lexical categories: the noun ‘heaviness/burden’, the verb ‘to be heavy’ and the adjective ‘heavy’, whereas Focke (1855), a later source, provides only two: the adjective and the noun. The second problem is that a given word may be attested in the same functions in an earlier and a later source. This is the case of the lexical item pikin discussed above: it is attested as a noun, an adjective, a stative verb and an adverb in both Van Dyk and Schumann. In this case no etymological evidence can be used for establishing directionality. The final problem lies in the fact that most multifunctional sets consist of more than two members. This makes etymological search even more difficult for two reasons. First, the chance of finding all members of a given set in the earliest source is rather low because of the smaller size of this source and of the different quality of this source: Van Dyk consists of short dialogues or conversation stretches whereas Schumann and Focke are dictionaries. Second, it is unclear how exactly directionality can be established within multi-member sets. For instance, should the rules be worked out for each member of the set, or can we assume that one member of the set is the basis and all the others are derivatives? Establishing rules would mean that an enormous load of etymological work must be done which, in view of what I have already mentioned above, would be almost impossible to carry out. Fixing one member as the basis and all other members as derivatives would mean that one input form might have a number of possible outputs which would go against the very idea of a derivational rule.
Note that there has been yet another suggestion concerning the use of historical evidence for establishing derivational direction in Modern Sranan. Thus,
182

Sebba (1981: 108) approaches this problem by comparing the multifunctional items in Sranan with those in its lexifier languages English and Dutch. He argues that in those cases where the items are multifunctional in both Sranan and one of the lexifier languages, the derivational direction is impossible to establish. Thus, e.g. the lexical item sribi can be a verb, ‘to sleep’, and a noun, ‘sleep’, in Sranan, similarly to its English etymon sleep which has exactly the same functions. However, Sebba (1981: 108) asserts that for words which are multifunctional in Sranan, but not in the lexifier languages, the derivational direction can be established on etymological grounds. Sebba illustrates this for the Sranan item prisiri, which is attested as the verb ‘to be happy’ and the noun ‘pleasure’ and comes from the Dutch plezier which can only be a noun. Thus, according to Sebba, the fact that prisiri was borrowed as a noun from Dutch and that Dutch does not have a corresponding verb can be interpreted as evidence in favour of the derivational direction N → V. Although Sebba’s suggestion sounds plausible, there are two problems with it. First, the etymological evidence used by Sebba allows us to establish rules for only a limited set of data since many Sranan items do have corresponding multifunctional items in the lexifier, especially English. This has the consequence that for some sets, rules can be established, while for many others it is impossible. Second, even for items like prisiri it is unclear whether they were indeed borrowed in the lexical category of the lexifier and then another function was derived or whether they were relexified as having two or more functions immediately. Taken the evidence that at least one of the substratum languages of Early Sranan, Fongbe, has quite a number of multifunctional items, this hypothesis does not seem impossible. In sum, the discussion shows that the etymological solution suggested by Sebba does not allow to establish a comprehensive system of conversion rules. In general, the etymological criterion cannot be used for establishing directionality of conversion in Early Sranan.
The second criterion for establishing the derivational direction in conversion is based on the idea that derivatives are usually semantically more complex than their bases. To apply this criterion to our example pikin we must investigate which of the four words, the adjective, the noun, the adverb or the verb, is semantically more complex than the other one. This, again, turns out to be a difficult undertaking. Thus, it seems to be almost impossible to judge which of
183

the lexemes, ‘child’, ‘to be small’, ‘young’ or ‘very much’, is more complex than the other. An additional problem arises again with the number of members in the multifunctional string. Thus, in English, the ‘conversional’ pairs usually consist of two members only, such as to guess – a guess, whereas in Early Sranan many strings contain more than two members. This makes judgements about the semantic complexity even more problematic. Moreover, the semantic complexity criterion cannot always be applied even in English, where there are pairs for which it yields no solution of the directionality problem (cf. Plag 2003c: 111).
The next criterion is that of formal complexity, according to which derived words tend to be inflected regularly, whereas the base forms can have irregular inflection. This criterion is completely ruled out for Early Sranan since nouns and verbs are not inflected in this language.
The final criterion is based on the general assumption that the derived words usually occur less frequently than their base words. Again this criterion might work for the data from English where large corpora allow a more or less reliable investigation of the frequency of occurrence of certain lexemes. However, in the case of Early Sranan, the problem is that in many cases the potential derivative and its base occur only once in the sources or they are only mentioned as multifunctional items in dictionary entries in, e.g. Schumann and Focke, but no examples of their actual usage are provided.
Generally speaking, the problems discussed above make the decision about the directionality of conversion in Early Sranan highly speculative. Consequently, this raises the question of whether the concept of conversion is suitable for Early Sranan. To answer this question, I will discuss one earlier attempt to describe multifunctionality in Sranan by using the concept of conversion.
6.6.3. Voorhoeve’s (1981) conversion rules
Voorhoeve (1981) aims at establishing guidelines for derivational rules for multifunctional sets in Modern Sranan. The analysis is based on a small data sample from the Woordenlijst van het Sranan Tongo (1961), which includes nouns, adjectives, and verbs beginning with letters from A to F. Voorhoeve argues that the relations between lexical items in Sranan are regular and that this
184

regularity can be captured only within what he calls ‘multifunctionality rules’.8 This idea is prompted by the observation that there are quite a number of lexical items in Sranan that belong to two different multifunctional sets presented in (43):

(43) a. [siki]A, [siki]N, [siki]Vintr, [siki]Vtrans b. [dede]A, [dede]N, [dede]Vintr

The difference between the two, pointed out by Voorhoeve, lies in the fact that the string in (43a) contains a transitive verb, whereas the one in (43b) does not. Voorhoeve advances the hypothesis that this difference is triggered by the derivational direction: in (43a) the transitive verb is the basis of derivation, whereas in (43b) it is the intransitive verb. On the basis of these observations Voorhoeve (1981: 28) assumes [V]tr → [V]intr to be the derivational direction and establishes the following derivational rules for Sranan:

(44) a. [V]tr → [V]intr, [A], [N] siki: to make sick; to be sick; sick; sickness

b. [V]intr → [A], [N]

dede: to die; dead; death

Two problems with the rules in (44) should be pointed out here. First, the basis of derivation as it is presented in (44) is, as Voorhoeve (1981: 28) notes himself, “completely hypothetical”. Although Voorhoeve tries to justify his position by arguing that only the derivational direction can be responsible for the difference between the two strings in (43), he provides no further arguments in favour of his analysis. He mentions, however, that justification of his account can be provided if one succeeds in establishing all multifunctional sets of Sranan in this way. I have shown above that a number of criteria can be applied to define the direction of conversion which is necessary for establishing derivational rules. Voorhoeve, however, uses none of the criteria to prove his argument. Besides, the data he uses are very limited, and to convincingly claim the non-existence of a word, an investigation based on large corpora is necessary. Thus, the absence of items in a

8 In fact, Voorhoeve’s terminology is somewhat confusing. He uses the terms ‘multifunctionality’ and ‘derivation’, but not the term ‘conversion’. However, his approach is based on the idea that multifunctionality is a derivational process for which direction and rules can be worked out. Therefore, his account treats the whole matter from the perspective of the concept of conversion.
185

dictionary does not mean that they are unattested words of a language. All this makes Voorhoeve’s hypothesis theoretically and methodologically untenable.
Second, the question arises whether the absence of the Vtr in multifunctional sets such as (43b) can have other grounds. Voorhoeve mentions the fact that the absence of the transitive verb in the string involving the lexeme dede might lie in the presence of the verb kiri ‘to kill’ that blocks the occurrence of dede as a transitive verb. Thus, blocking might be an alternative and more plausible reason for the absence of transitive verbs in the strings of the type presented in (43b). Another potential explanation could be of pragmatic nature: words are usually created when there is a communicative need for them. Besides, as I have already mentioned above, to really prove this absence, much larger amounts of data are necessary. This can be supported by Migge’s research (2000; 2003a) on what she calls ‘property items’ (which I have termed ‘adjectives’ in section 6.3. above). On the basis of informant work in Eastern Maroon Creole, Migge (2003a: 86-87) argues that almost all property items, i.e. adjectives, may function as transitive verbs. The few exceptions Migge mentions are bun ‘good’, lountu ‘round’, nyun ‘new’, as well as adjectives denoting age and human propensity, such as ‘lazy’. Migge (2000: 215) explains that the transitive use is attested in those A-V pairs where the property the adjective denotes is viewed by the native speakers as “acquirable through intervention of another entity, especially humans”. This means that it does not depend on a general rule, but on the item’s individual semantics, whether an item displays a certain kind of multifunctionality or not.
Further on Voorhoeve revises the rules in (44) since he notes that there are multifunctional sets that contradict them. He notes that there is, for instance, a difference between the following multifunctional strings:

(45) a. [bro]V→ [bro]N b. [bosro]N→ [bosro]V

to breathe-breath brush-to brush

According to Voorhoeve, this difference lies in the fact that bro as a noun is the product of bro as a verb whereas the noun bosro is the instrument of the verb bosro. Voorhoeve insists that in (45a) it is the verb that serves as the basis of derivation, in accordance to the rules in (44), whereas in (45b) the noun is the
186

basis, which does not correspond to the rules in (44). To solve this problem, Voorhoeve introduces subcategorisations which serve to capture fine-grained distinctions between different lexical items and thus different multifunctional sets. As Voorhoeve (1981: 29-30) argues, such a subcategorisation would allow us to describe the noun in (45a) as ‘product’, and the noun in (45b) as ‘instrument’. Voorhoeve then classifies all verbs in his data into different ‘subcategories’. His subcategorisation is based, as he notes (1981: 32), on the number of arguments the verb takes and on the semantic case of the objects, such as ‘nominative’, ‘ergative’ and ‘locative’. Note that Voorhoeve provides no explanation why he uses these semantic cases and not some others and where they come from. Thus, the intransitive verbs siki ‘ill’ and wroko ‘work’ are considered by Voorhoeve to have one argument: in the nominative case and in the ergative case respectively, and are presented as [V]nom and [V]erg respectively. The verb wasi ‘wash’ is categorised by Voorhoeve as a verb with two arguments, one in the ergative case and the other in the nominative case, and it is notated as [V]erg + nom. The verb brasa ‘embrace’ is also characterised as having two arguments, in the ergative and the locative case, notated as [V]erg + loc. Finally, verbs like gi ‘give’ are presented by Voorhoeve as possessing three arguments: in the ergative, the nominative and the locative case: [V]erg + nom + loc. On the basis of such a classification of the data, Voorhoeve argues that the following derivational rules are available in Sranan (for greater clarity I have matched the examples Voorhoeve gives with the rules):

(46) a. b. c. d. e. f. g. h.

[N]inst → [V](erg+) nom [V]erg + nom → [N] [V]nom → [N] [V]nom → [A] [V]nom → [V] erg + nom [A] → [N] [A] → [V]nom [V]erg + nom → [V]nom

bosro: brush; to brush bro: to breathe; breath siki: to be sick; sickness siki: to be sick; sick or dede: to die; dead siki: to be ill; to make ill siki: sick; sickness siki: sick; to be sick or dede: dead, to die wasi: to wash; to be washed

Here again, a number of problems with Voorhoeve’s suggestions and also a number of questions emerge. First of all, the rules in (46) have the same problem

187

as those presented in (44): the derivational direction has no theoretical or methodological justification. An interesting fact is that some of the rules in (46), e.g. (46d) and (46g) or (46e) and (46h) differ in the derivational direction only. This raises the question of what the purpose of differentiating between the two sets in each case might be and why the derivational direction differs especially in these cases. Unfortunately, Voorhoeve provides examples only for the sets in (46e) and (46h): the rule in (46e) should account, as Voorhoeve suggests, for the examples in (47a), and the rule (46h) for the examples in (47b) below:

(47) a. a man siki Leba siki a man
b. a wasi den krosi den krosi wasi

‘The man is ill.’ ‘Leba (a God) has made the man ill.’ ‘He washed the clothes.’ ‘The clothes are washed.’

Even these examples do not provide an explanation for the differentiation Voorhoeve makes. In both cases we are dealing with the transitive verbs ‘to wash’ and ‘to make ill’ on the one hand, and the intransitive, or more exactly, stative verbs ‘to be ill’ and ‘to be washed’. The reason why the two pairs in (47) should require different derivational rules is unclear. Since Voorhoeve neither uses the criteria for establishing directionality, nor provides any other plausible explanation for the direction of the rules in (46), I see no justification for his rules. Besides, the rules in (46) also do not fulfill the function rules usually have to fulfill: they do not really show restrictions. Although Voorhoeve (1981: 30) mentions one such restriction, namely that a derived word cannot function as the basis of further derivation, his rules in (46d) and (46f) contradict this statement: the output of (46d), an adjective, is the input for the rule (46f).
Another problem with Voorhoeve’s account lies in the absence of any connection between the rules in (44) and those in (46), which Voorhoeve presents in the final section of his paper. Voorhoeve does not mention that the former should be substituted by the latter or that (46) is the revised version of (44). In fact, the two systems seem to be somewhat contradicting. The central point Voorhoeve makes when presenting the rules in (44) is that the derivational direction goes from Vtr or Vintr to N and A. However, the rule in (46g) shows exactly the opposite direction. The rule in (46e) is similarly confusing since it
188

allows the derivational direction from Vintr into Vtr which should also be impossible according to the rules in (44).
Another set of problems is connected with Voorhoeve’s use of subcategorisations. The first unclear aspect is the number of subcategorisations: why does Voorhoeve provide verbs with a more fine-graded subcategorisation into at least 5 different categories, such as [V] erg + nom, [V]nom, [V]erg + loc etc., but does not elaborate further subcategories for nouns in multifunctional strings, such as ‘result’ or ‘process’? Second, it is unclear what the purpose of such subcategorisations might be. Thus, Voorhoeve provides no explanation for the fact that he first makes the distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs only, whereas later he classifies verbs according to the number of their arguments and the semantic case of their objects. Furthermore, the subcategorisations do not lead to generalisations concerning specific derivational directions. For example, the verb wasi ‘to wash’ and the verb siki ‘to make ill’ are subcategorisied in the same manner as [V]erg + nom. However, Voorhoeve argues that the rules they participate in are different: wasi is the basis of derivation in the rule (46h): [V]erg + nom → [V]nom, whereas siki is the derivative, the product of the rule (46e): [V]nom → [V] erg + nom. Since the problem of the derivational basis is not clarified, the purpose of the subcategorisation is also unclear.
The final general problem to be mentioned here is the number of rules used by Voorhoeve: in (44) there are only two rules, in (46), where subcategorisations are used, the number of rules increases to 8. Since Voorhoeve analysed only verbs, nouns and adjectives, and only a limited set of data, his rules in (46) present only a subset of possible derivations. I have shown in section 6.4. above what a wide range multifunctionality has in Early Sranan if we take more data into consideration. Voorhoeve’s system of rules in (46) would have to be extended to comprise adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions and other possible types which his data did not yield. This, in its turn, raises doubts as to the usefulness of such an extensive system in which rules describe attested sets rather than document restrictions.
In conclusion, Voorhoeve’s account is problematic in several respects. It shows that to establish conversion rules, one must work out a plausible method for defining the derivational direction. Without derivational direction, the rules, and thus the application of the concept of conversion itself, make little sense.
189

Voorhoeve’s major motivation for postulating rules lies in the assumption that rules can capture regularities and restrictions. Interestingly, as the foregoing discussion demonstrates, the regularities and restrictions Voorhoeve tries to capture with his rules are often connected with the semantics of lexical items. His subcategorisations are in fact an attempt to classify the data in semantic terms, e.g. nouns as ‘products’ or ‘instruments’. However, as the discussion above shows, such a classification does not help us understand why certain multifunctional sets do not occur or why certain lexical items are not multifunctional at all. Therefore, an alternative to establishing conversion rules might lie in looking for a different way of capturing the semantic restrictions and regularities in the lexicon and in combining the semantic information with the categorial properties of lexical items. All in all, the discussion allows the conclusion that multifunctionality in Early Sranan is not a morphological, rule-driven process.
6.7. The concept of underspecification
6.7.1. Introduction
A serious alternative to conversion accounts is the underspecification approach which is gaining ground in the last years. The major idea behind an approach based on the idea of underspecification is that lexical forms can be minimally specified for a category or a semantic feature in the lexicon, thus allowing for multiple class membership and the surfacing of the form in different syntactic slots. Although elaboration of a detailed underspecification account for languages where multifunctionality is a common phenomenon still remains a task for future research, there are several accounts that might be helpful in this case. These accounts may differ in respect to what is being considered underspecified: syntactic-categorial features, semantic features, or both. Therefore, in the sections to follow I will deal with three different underspecification accounts.
190

6.7.2. Syntactic category underspecification: Lefebvre (2001)

Lefebvre (2001) suggests an account which is designed to show how lexical items can be described as underspecified in terms of syntactic categories. Lefebvre (2001: 123) assumes that major syntactic categories are defined by the features [αN, ßV], where the variables α and ß can take the values + or –. Combinations of these features give rise to the following major categories (Lefebvre 2001: 123):

(48) [+N, –V] = noun [+N, +V] = adjective [–N, +V] = verb [–N, –V] = preposition

Thus, if a major category lexical item is underspecified for the nominal feature, it will be notified as [αN, –V]. This underspecified feature can then be given the value +, and will be a noun, or it can be given the value –, and therefore will be a preposition. Lefebvre (2001: 124) lists the following combinations, which are possible when either [αN] or [ßV], but not both, are underspecified9:

(49) [αN, –V]:
[αN, +V]: [+N, ßV]: [–N, ßV]:

[+N, –V] (N) or [–N, –V] (Prep) kay ‘house’/’at the house of’ [–N, +V] (V) or [+N, +V] (A) gate ‘to rot/rotten’ [+N, –V] (N) or [+N, +V] (A) ansyen ‘old person/old’ [–V, +N] (V) or [–N, –V] (Prep) bay/ba ‘to give/for’

Lefebvre suggests that not all major category items can give rise to multifunctionality: whereas nouns or verbs can give rise to adjectives or prepositions, adjectives and prepositions cannot be the basis for multifunctional sets. Besides, since Lefebvre also assumes that N or V cannot be underspecified simultaneously, additional combinations of features, and thus, additional multifunctional pairs become impossible. All in all, the following list of impossible pairs is provided by Lefebvre (2001: 125):

9 All examples in (49) come from Haitian and are taken from Lefebvre (2001: 110-118).
191

(50) *A or V *A or Prep *Prep or N *Prep or V *Prep or A
Lefebvre makes two conclusions on the basis of a comparison between the possible sets in (49) and the impossible ones in (50). The first conclusion is that underspecification is not a “multidirectional phenomenon”, i.e. that a direction is involved in multifuntionality. The second conclusion is that there are certain combinations, such as A-Prep or Prep-A which are strictly impossible, however, this time not on a directional basis. Although Lefebvre assumes that the reason for this might lie in the mixed nature of the categories A and Prep, and insists that a more grounded explanation of this fact is still not available.
There are several problems with Lefebvre’s underspecification account. First, I see no reason for Lefebvre’s assumption that nouns or verbs should be basic in (49), and that therefore a derivational direction must be involved in the underspecification account she provides. It is the advantage of the underpecification account in comparison to the conversion account discussed above that it does not establish the derivational direction. The second problem with (49) is that it does not list some frequently attested multifunctional sets, such as N-V. The reason for this lies in Lefebvre’s assumption that either [αN] or [ßV], but not both can be underspecified. However, to make such pairs as N-V possible, both [αN] and [ßV] must be underspecified. Further it is unclear why Lefebvre makes such an assumption, but it will become plausible in the course of further discussion below. The final problem lies in the fact that the list in (49) encompasses only two-member multifunctional sets. As I have shown above for Early Sranan, and as Lefebvre (2001) shows for Haitian, there are three- and fourmember sets as well, such as Prep-N-A-Adv or A-Adv-V. The question that arises then is how, if at all, the underspecification approach advanced by Lefebvre can be refined to account for such sets as well.
Beside the account introduced above, Lefebvre also pursues an alternative one. She shows that by abandoning the assumption that only [αN] or [ßV], but not
192

both, can be underspecified for the values + or –, a different range of possible multifunctional sets emerges, as is presented in (51):
(51) [αN, ßV]: [+N, –V] N [+N, +V] A [–N, –V] Prep [–N, +V] V
At first sight, the underspecification account in (51) seems to avoid the directionality problem arising with (49), already mentioned above and also allows the attested sets of the type N↔V. However, as Lefebvre (2001: 126) argues, it bears a different problem: it does not allow to rule out multifunctional pairs, such as A-Prep, which Lefebvre claims to be unattested. Note that this explains why Lefebvre first assumes that either [αN] or [ßV] can be underspecified, and not both. Lefebvre suggests that such cases as A-Prep, could, however, be ruled out within a zero affixation account since such an account would allow the assumption that there are no zero affixes with the features [+N, +V] or [–N, –V]. These observations lead Lefebvre to the conclusion that categorial underspecification would account for cases where only one major feature, i.e. N or V, is changed, and zero derivation approach for cases of a complete change of categorial features, e.g. from [+N, +V] to [–N, –V].
Two problematic aspects about the suggestion just mentioned can be pointed out. First, the classification of categories in (48) is not unproblematic (cf. Knobloch and Schaeder 2000: 681). Croft (2000: 66) argues that the features [±N,±V] have been invented to document similarities and differences in syntactic behaviour among the four types of lexical categories: N, A, V, Prep, but these features give no information about what behaviour could be used to determine these parts of speech. Croft further mentions that it is often assumed within the tradition of generative syntax that these parts of speech are universal and that the features in question are “innately given”. In fact, as Croft (2000: 66) insists, the syntactic theory has never elaborated guidelines for differentiating parts of speech in a given language. Apart from this general problem, it is also unclear how the category of adverbs and other functional categories, such as determiners, can be integrated into such a classification.
193

Second, I see a contradiction in applying both the underspecification and the zero derivation concepts to account for multifunctionality. By doing so we admit that essentially the same phenomenon is triggered by two essentially different mechanisms: a lexical and a morphological one. Thus, if we indeed assume that no zero affixes with the features [+N, +V] or [–N, –V] are available, we are still in the need of explaining why items with exactly the same features can be produced by a lexical mechanism, e.g. in the case of N-Prep multifunctional pairs.
Third, I doubt that the concept of zero derivation can really account for the absence of A↔Prep multifunctional sets. I have already shown above that postulating a zero affix is justified in those cases where there is a corresponding overt affix. It would be interesting to know whether there are affixes in the languages of the world which produce prepositions from adjectives and vice versa. To answer this question, an extensive typological study encompassing several languages is needed, which is of course beyond the scope of the present investigation. The answer can, however, be given at least for the languages crucial for the present analysis, English and Early Sranan. In these languages there is no such affixational possibility. This fact leads us to the conclusion that if there is no overt affix of this type, then postulating a corresponding zero affix in these languages makes little sense. Postulating its absence seems even less reasonable since we must deny something that is already ruled out on theoretical grounds.
Two questions arise on the basis of the foregoing discussion. The first question is in how far it is necessary at all to explain each non-occurring combination of lexical categories in multifunctional sets. Here a parallel to derivational rules seems useful. Thus, when word-formation rules are established for a given language, we usually do not ask why, for instance, there is no such affix as -*plum in English that would derive conjunctions from adverbs. A more important question is, however, why a certain lexeme can be attested in some combinations, but not in others. For instance, we might ask why the Early Sranan word pikin ‘child/small/to be small’ does not occur as a preposition. It seems that a categorial approach of the type in (51) cannot explain such cases: since it postulates everything as underspecified, it automatically allows any possible combination of syntactic categories within one multifunctional set. This is why Lefebvre (2001) involves the concept of zero-derivation in such cases. Since I
194

have discarded the zero-affixation solution, we are left with the necessity to seek a different, non-categorial explanation for such phenomena.
Let us first pursue the issue of why A-Prep sets are not attested. As I have already mentioned above, Lefebvre (2001: 125; 127) assumes that A and Prep are mixed categories in terms of their features: adjectives share their [+N] feature with nouns and their [+V] feature with verbs, whereas prepositions share their [–N] feature with verbs and their [–V] feature with nouns. As I have shown above, this type of explanation is problematic since it makes use of the categorial feature classification, and does not explain why adjectives and prepositions do not build multifunctional pairs together. Since this categorial explanation does not work, it makes sense to seek a reason for this fact in semantics.
In this connection Croft (2000: 96) remarks that when an item is used in more than one pragmatic function, it experiences a semantic shift towards the semantic class prototypically associated with this function. According to Croft, property words experience a shift to the meaning ‘object associated with this property’ when taking on the function of reference. An object word used in the predication function acquires the meaning of an action typically connected with this object. The conclusion I will draw from this is that there is a certain amount of association between items of different semantic classes. Thus, objects can be associated with actions they can fulfill and with properties they can possess. This might be taken as an explanation for the fact that N-V or N-A multifunctionality is rather common among the languages of the world. Properties, on the other hand, can be associated with actions characterized by a certain property and with objects that possess a certain property. This would account for the existence of A-V sets. If we assume that the function of prepositions is to relate, then again, we can explain why verbs and nouns are also attested as prepositions: both objects and actions can express relations. However, it is unclear whether properties can be associated with relations. This allows a suggestion that probably multifunctional sets of the type A↔Prep can be ruled out through semantic underspecification. Let us now see how this argument works for the case of siki. We can try the same line of argument as for A-Prep sets: since siki has the meanings ‘illness/ill/to be ill’ it is difficult to imagine an adverb that might mean something like *illy or even more difficult to imagine a preposition with a meaning having something to do with illness. Further support for the idea that the multifunctionality potential of
195

a given item could be dependent on its semantics might be found in the observation that items denoting animals and plants are never multifunctional in Early Sranan.
In conclusion, the foregoing discussion demonstrates that the concept of syntactic category underspecification as it is presented in (51) has the advantage of avoiding one serious methodological problem arising with the Early Sranan data: the problem of establishing the derivational direction. The discussion questions the usefulness of syntactic category information as it is used by Lefebvre for a multifunctionality account and suggests that semantics of lexemes is another realm with a potential of reliable explanations.
6.7.3. Functional underspecification: Vogel (2000)
Although the second account to be considered here deals mainly with grammaticalisation and degrammaticalisation in part-of speech systems, it contains a number of valuable insights about underspecification. Thus, while describing part of speech systems in English, German and Tongan, Vogel (2000) categorises lexemes not in terms of the traditional categories such as [±N] or [±V], but in terms of their functions, such as reference, predication and modification. This model is based on the assumptions made in Broschart (1997). As Vogel (2000: 261) remarks, in languages where the greatest part of lexemes can appear in different syntactic positions without specific marking, lexemes are neutral with regard to syntactic position and function. In such languages the lexemes must then be regarded as underspecified on the lexical level. This underspecification can be expressed in terms of the features ‘predicatability’ (pred) and ‘reference’ (ref) which reflect pragmatic functions associated with lexemes and are formalised as [–ref/–pred]. On the syntactic level, however, lexemes become specified as either [+ref/+pred] (verbal) and [+ref/–pred] (nominal). Vogel suggests, that in such languages “syntactic specification takes place on the phrase level when lexical types are transformed into syntactic tokens”. She argues that only syntactic phrases are syntactically specified and not the lexemes themselves.
196

It should be mentioned at this point that the perspective Vogel takes is not new in linguistics. Thus, Hopper and Thompson (1984) advance what they call a ‘categoriality hypothesis’ which states that lexemes lack categoriality and that they may acquire it by fulfilling certain discourse functions. Hopper and Thompson (1984: 708-709) suggest that when a lexeme “asserts the occurrence of an event of the discourse’ it can be categorised as a verb and when it introduces a participant in discourse, it is categorised as a noun. Remarkably, within this account the semantics of syntactic categories is viewed as secondary to their discourse roles. Another work going in a similar direction is Croft (2000; 2001). Croft argues within his theory, called Radical Construction Grammar, that the syntactic behaviour of word-classes is a reflection of cross-linguistic functions such as reference, modification, and predication on the one hand, and semantic classes, such as object, property, action on the other. One of the major claims Croft makes is that syntactic categories are “derivative from the constructions that define them”, and not vice versa.
In general, the suggestions by Vogel (2000), Hopper and Thompson (1984) and Croft (2000) are helpful in that they avoid the problems of classifying lexemes in terms of their syntactic categories. Whereas such a classification can be language-specific and controversial, as it might have become clear in the course of discussion in the present chapter, the functions such as modification, reference, etc. are universal and hardly a matter of dispute. Applying this idea to Early Sranan, one might say that as long as we try to find a definite answer to the question whether óuwroe or pikin are adjectives or verbs in the predication slot, we run into problems. However, the fact that óuwroe and pikin can function as modifiers of nouns and as predicates is uncontroversial. Furthermore, in respect to the semantics of such items, one might argue that when occurring in the modification position they acquire the meaning ‘property’, whereas when they act as predicates, they acquire the interpretation ‘state’. All in all, it seems that an account in terms of functions allows a completely different view of part-of-speech classification. Such a classification would divide lexemes in a given language into those that fulfil the function of modification, of reference, of predication etc. Accounting for multifunctionality in Early Sranan along the lines suggested by Vogel (2000) is less problematic than what is suggested by Voorhoeve (1981) and Lefebvre (2001) because on the one hand, there is no need to postulate rules, and
197

on the other hand, there is no urge to decide whether a given item should be categorised as [+N, –V] or as something else. However, a number of questions still remain unanswered.
Since, Vogel (2000) and also Hopper and Thompson (1984) deal with nouns and verbs primarily, the question is how the underspecification of items occurring in more than two functions should be modelled. Or, how different items fulfilling the same function, e.g. that of modification, which is ascribed to at least three classes: determiners, adjectives and adverbs, can be treated. Besides, while I believe that lexemes traditionally classified as pronouns and determiners can be integrated into this system since they may be associated with reference and modification respectively, it is unclear what the function of prepositions might be. The final problem is similar to the one with Lefebvre’s underspecification account in (51): if every lexeme is underspecified for every function, how can we explain the fact that the Early Sranan siki is not attested as a preposition and an adverb, although it is attested as a noun, a verb and an adjective; or that the item areisi meaning ‘rice’ is attested as a noun only? In other words, how can unattested sets and combinations of categories within a given set be accounted for? Although a hint in this respect might be drawn from Vogel’s remark that some lexemes are specified syntactically, as e.g. adverbs in English are [+mod], such an approach is problematic for Early Sranan. Thus, in the case of siki we must assume that it is underspecifed for all the three functions: [–ref/–pred/–mod], since it can occur in all of them. However, since it is underspecified for the function of modification it presupposes that it might occur as both a modificator of nouns, i.e. an adjective, and as a modificator of verbs, i.e. an adverb. However, this is not the case, which means that we should either invent a new function for adverbs or dispose of this category altogether, which is not reasonable in view of the fact that it has its own purpose to fulfil: to modify clauses and adjectives. Another suggestion might be to differentiate between modification of nouns and modification of other categories. In doing so, we can, for instance, render siki as underspecified for the feature ‘modification of nouns’ thus enabling it to occur as an adjective. We can also exclude ‘modification of other categories’ from the bundle of its potential features, thus ruling out its occurrence as an adverb. Of course, this is a highly hypothetical solution and leaves many questions open. An alternative might again
198

lie in the semantics, where the same argumentation I have used above can be applied.
In conclusion, the functional approach to multifuntionality avoids several problems arising with the syntactic category account, but it is similar to it in that it leaves the explanation for unattested formations open. The issue to be addressed next then is what solutions a semantic underspecification account might offer. The following section is devoted to this issue.
6.7.4. Semantic underspecification: Lefebvre (2001), Farell (2001)
The problem of semantic underspecification has been approached from at least two different poles. Thus, Lefebvre (2001) suggests that the related meanings of a multifunctional item can be grasped within the same lexical entry via semantic underspecification of a lexical conceptual structure (LCS). As Lefebvre (2001: 122) remarks, different meanings of a lexical entry must have a “semantic core which can be represented by a single lexical conceptual structure.” LCSs of certain entries must be rendered more abstract or more specific in accordance with more abstract or more specific meanings of multifunctional items. Unfortunately, Lefebvre does not provide examples of how such an underspecified LCS might look like, but mentions that this is a task for future research (Lefebvre 2001: 122; 132). Moreover, Jackendoff’s (1990) lexical conceptual structure approach has been designed primarily for verbs, which leaves us with the serious problem of how such an approach should be altered to encompass a greater number of other lexical and functional categories (cf. Lieber 2004: 6).
Another way of approaching the matter under regard has been introduced by Farell (2001) who suggests a semantic underspecification analysis of N-V multifunctional pairs in English within the framework of cognitive grammar. Farell argues that verbs and nouns have an elaborate conceptual structure which is compatible with both a ‘process’ and a ‘thing’ meaning and their surfacing as a noun or a verb is dictated by the context they occur in. Thus, e.g. the meaning of the noun sneeze and the verb sneeze in the sentences That was a loud sneeze and They sneezed loudly is essentially the same. The difference lies in the fact that in
199

one case sneeze occurs in a nominal slot and acquires the ‘thing’ interpretation, whereas in the second sentence it occurs in the verbal slot and designates a process. Farell (2001: 113) further observes that such words as sneeze are not necessarily associated with the categories ‘noun’ and ‘verb’, but with meanings that can surface as either of these categories because of their being compatible with different contextually imposed interpretations. The phenomenon of alternation between nouns and verbs is, according to Farell, common and semantically predictable in most cases, and for cases where nouns do not shift to verbs, there is a plausible explanation. Farell notes that this shift can, for instance, be blocked by an already existing verb. The verb sweep, e.g., blocks the shift from the noun broom to the verb broom. On the other hand, nouns containing the suffix -er also do not become verbs because this suffix “fixes them as nouns”.10
Farell’s approach has two advantages in general. First, as Farell points out, it precludes us from postulating word-formation rules for multifunctionality which in the case of Early Sranan means avoiding problems listed for Voorhoeve’s account. The second, and probably the most important feature of this account, is that it raises doubts about the necessity of elaborating a categorial underspecification account by giving primacy to the semantic information a given lexical item bears. Thus, under Farell’s analysis, we have to render the semantics of siki ‘ill’, for instance, in such a way as to allow its use as an item indicating an object (‘illness’), i.e. a noun in reference function, and as an item indicating a property (‘ill’), i.e. an adjective modifying a noun, and as an item indicating state (‘to be ill’), i.e. a verb in the predication function. The semantics of the item areisi ‘rice’, on the other hand, should be underspecified to allow it to occur as an item indicating an object, i.e. a noun in the reference function, only. If semantic underspecification can be elaborated as Farell argues, to allow multiple meanings and thus multiple functions, the categorial account, be it based on syntactic categories or on pragmatic functions, becomes a matter of secondary importance.
Though Farell’s account sounds rather attractive since it advances explanations for unattested sets, at least two issues remain unclear. First, if a
10 Note that the idea of blocking has already been mentioned in connection with Voorhoeve’s account, and I believe that a careful investigation of certain unattested combinations which Voorhoeve tries to predict through his rules, could provide further insights in this respect.
200

certain context triggers a certain interpretation, such as ‘object’ or ‘process’, how should we treat cases where a word has, as bronn in Early Sranan, three different verbal meanings: a transitive ‘to burn’, an intransitive ‘to burn’ and a stative ‘to be burnt’ which would then simultaneously suit the category ‘process’ when occurring in the predication context? A detailed account of how a specific context triggers or blocks a certain interpretation is certainly necessary to explain for such cases. Second, it is unclear how lexemes belonging to functional categories can be described in terms of the semantic underspecification. Indeed, functional categories do not render such semantic concepts as ‘thing’ or ‘property’, and are actually rather general from the point of view of their semantics.
6.8. How can multifunctionality be analysed in Early Sranan?
The discussions in the present chapter allow a number of generalisations concerning the optimal account of multifunctionality in Early Sranan.
Multifunctionality in Early Sranan cannot be accounted for in terms of the concept of zero derivation since Early Sranan has very few overt affixes for which corresponding zero morphs can be postulated. The majority of multifunctional pairs have no overt affixal correspondences.
The concept of conversion also does not allow to cover all multifunctionality phenomena chiefly because establishing the derivational direction and derivational rules is problematic in view of the wide range of Early Sranan multifunctionality.
The previous considerations lead to the assumption that multifunctional items in Early Sranan are not created morphologically, but are generally underspecified for a syntactic category, a pragmatic function, and semantics. I maintain that applying the concept of underspecification is a viable alternative to both zero-derivation and conversion accounts. This suggestion is prompted by a number of observations already mentioned in the discussions above and summarised here for convenience. First, most items in Early Sranan are multifunctional. Second, many multifunctional sets consist of more than two
201

members. Third, the range of multifunctionality is rather wide and encompasses both lexical and functional categories. A final consideration concerns substratum influence. In section 6.4. I have shown some parallels between multifunctionality in Early Sranan and its substratum languages, such as Fongbe or Ewe. In many cases, the multifunctionality of the corresponding substratum items offers a possible explanation for Early Sranan multifunctionality. If we assume, following Lefebvre (1998), that substratum lexical entries can be relexified in a creole, then the multifunctionality of many Early Sranan items, such as bakka, dissi, wan, takki comes as no surprise. All in all, this means that multifunctionality of at least those pairs for which there are one-to-one multifunctional correspondences in the substratum, is not the result of a directional, language-internal morphological process, but a consequence of L1 transfer.
Since elaboration of an underspecification analysis is a complex issue, and is still in need of refinement, it is impossible for me to cover it fully within the present investigation. Therefore, what I am going to suggest here is a direction which an account of multifunctionality in Early Sranan might take.
The central suggestion I will make is that a semantic underspecification concept is of primary importance in an investigation of multifunctionality in Early Sranan since it seems to be the semantic profile that allows or disallows an item to occur in certain functions. It is an open question whether such a concept should operate with categories of cognitive grammar as in Farell’s (2001) model or with any other categories, such as, for instance, semantic primitives suggested by Wierzbicka (1996) or within some other cognitive or semantic framework (e.g. a recently advanced approach by Lieber 2004). The concept of semantic underspecification itself and the problems connected with it deserve a closer examination, which is beyond the scope of the present study.
What I would like to show, however, is a highly simplified sketch of how such an account might function. Consider the Early Sranan example siki. To account for its multifunctionality, we could render this lexeme underspecified as having something to do with a specific physical state, that of being ill. We further have to assume that when siki is used in a nominal slot, the underspecified semantics will get associated with the semantic category ‘thing or person’ and will allow for two meanings such as ‘illness’ and ‘sick person’. Since the word sikiman ‘sick person’ already exists in Early Sranan, it will block the ‘person’
202

interpretation and allow the ‘thing’ interpretation only. If, on the other hand, the context is that of modification, then the property meaning will be activated, i.e. ‘ill’. Finally, in the predication context, the state interpretation is demanded and therefore siki will acquire the meaning ‘to be ill’. The same procedure can be imagined for other items. To take another example, bakka, which is attested as a noun, ‘back’, an adjective, ‘back/last’, a preposition, ‘after/behind’ and an adverb, ‘back/again’, we again must describe its semantics in underspecified terms, for instance, as ‘dorsal location in physical space’. When used in a syntactic slot typical of a noun, the ‘thing’ interpretation will be activated, and thus the meaning ‘back part’ will be specified. When used in a modification position to a noun, the property interpretation is activated, and the word will acquire the meaning ‘back/last’. Appearance in the modification position to an adjective or a verb requires the interpretation ‘manner/circumstance’, and bakka will be activated with the adverbial meaning ‘back’. Finally, a prepositional slot will demand a relation interpretation, and thus bakka will be specified as ‘after/behind’.
6.9. Conclusion
In the present chapter, the phenomenon of multifunctionality has been introduced and discussed in the light of several current theories. It has been shown that whereas the concepts based on the notions of conversion and zero derivation bear a number of theoretical and methodological problems, underspecification accounts suggest a less problematic treatment of the issue in Early Sranan. The discussions presented throughout the chapter raise doubts about the morphological, directional nature of multifunctionality in Early Sranan, and prompt an analysis in terms of semantic and categorial underspecification, suggesting that multifunctionality is an inherent property of many Early Sranan lexemes.

7. Word-formation in Early Sranan
7.1. Introduction
The present chapter deals with the analysis of word-formation processes in Early Sranan. Complex words and other constructs serving the referential function attested in the three early sources of Sranan, Van Dyk (c1765), Schumann (1783), and Focke (1855), will be described according to their structural, semantic and syntactic properties. A special focus will be on drawing parallels between the Early Sranan patterns and those available in the source languages.
Since different terms are used to refer to the use of L1 features in learner varieties, such as retention (Migge 2003a; Winford 2002), transfer (Siegel 1999; 2004a), and relexification (Lefebvre 1998; Lumsden 1999b), I will first clarify in which sense these terms will be used in the present work.
Relexification is defined as “copying the lexical entries of an already established lexicon and replacing their phonological representations with representations derived from another language” (Lefebvre 1998: 16). It is also regarded as a specific type of transfer and a crucial tool used by second language learners. As Lefebvre (1998: 34) puts it, relexification is the type of transfer that is attested in creole genesis. Although it has been argued that relexification is one of the several possible strategies used in language acquisition (Lumsden 1999a), Lefebvre (1998: 35) asserts that for creole genesis, it is the main tool. However, Siegel (2004a: 346-347) notes, that relexification cannot be regarded as a synonymous term for transfer, since transfer covers a wider range of L1 influence phenomena, such as phonological interference and changes in word-order. Besides, Siegel mentions that transfer can refer to those cases where the overlap between L1 and the contact variety structures is not one-to-one. In the present work, the term relexification will be applied only to those cases for which there is a one-to-one correspondence in structural and semantic properties between the substratum and the creole lexical entries. Contrary to Lefebvre (1998: 40), I will regard those cases where the creole complex items differ from those of the
204

substrate only in the word order of their constituents as cases of transfer, and not as cases of relexification.
The use of the term ‘transfer’ is not uniform in the literature on SLA and pidgins and creoles (Siegel 2004a). In the present work, I will define the term following Siegel (2004a: 345), who views transfer as a psycholinguistic process of language learning during which speakers “use the linguistic features of their first language (L1) either to provide a basis for constructing the grammar of the second language (L2), or to compensate for insufficient linguistic resources when communicating in the L2”.
Another focus of the present chapter will lie on discussing factors that trigger or constrain the substratum and superstratum influence on the emerging creole. Such factors are often referred to as ‘universal’. However, it is rarely the case in works in creole linguistics that a clear definition of what should count as ‘universal’ is given. For instance, markedness is often referred to as an influencing factor in creole formation, but commonly, it is not specified what exactly is meant by this term: cross-linguistic frequency of a certain feature, its structural or semantic simplicity or something else. Therefore, in what follows I will define the ‘universal’ factors which I consider to play an important role in the emergence of creole word-formation. These factors comprise perceptual saliency, frequency of occurrence, structural and semantic congruence between L1 and L2 morphemes, structural complexity, semantic and morphotactic transparency. Since definitions of some of these terms involve a considerable amount of controversy and variability (cf. Siegel 1999) in what follows I will specify the ways in which they will be used in the present investigation.
The concept of perceptual saliency is based on the assumption that free morphemes are easier to recognise and to process than bound morphemes (cf. Siegel 1999: 23-24). The reasons for this can lie in the different phonological properties of these two types of morphemes. As Vainikka and Young-Scholten (1995: 12) (cited from DeGraff 1999: 518) maintain, free morphemes often constitute at least one phonological foot, whereas bound morphemes are usually smaller than a foot. According to Vainikka and Young-Scholten, this may lead to difficulties in the analysis of L2 constituents that are smaller than a foot.
Structural simplicity is another universal factor crucial in the development of creole word-formation. Structural simplicity of word-formation processes will
205

be defined as a continuum which ranges from a minimum amount of root change, such as conversion (the term favoured in the present work, ‘multifunctionality’), to the maximum amount of change, such as vowel change or suppletion. The basis for this definition is drawn from Clark (1993: 120-121) who argues that language learners rely on formal simplicity during the initial stages since they “find it easier to interpret and coin a new word the simpler it is in form – that is, the less its root changes in its construction.” As Clark notes, however, the concept of simplicity is dependent on the typological class of language and is therefore not uniform for all languages. Drawing mainly on the work by Clark (1993), but also some assumptions from Siegel (2004b: 144), and Wurzel (1984), and on the assumption that Early Sranan and most of its input languages such as English, Twi and the Gbe varieties are analytical languages, I will work with the following continuum of structural simplicity in Early Sranan:

(1) more simple

more complex

multi

compounding

functionali- with bare roots;

ty

full

reduplication

affixation with affixation vowel

affixes that with change alternation,

require no root of root

other root

change

changes

Semantic transparency has also been cited as a universal factor in creolisation (Seuren and Wekker 1986). The definition of semantic transparency in the present study will be based on the work by Dressler (1994; 1987; 1981) and Dalton-Puffer (1996). In general a morphological operation is regarded as more iconic, the more the addition of meaning is reflected in the change of form (Dressler 1994: 97). Dalton-Puffer (1996: 55) views semantic transparency as an instrument for measuring “how well the formal operation reflects the semantic compositionality of the derived word”. Dalton-Puffer places the word-formation process in the following way reflecting their growing non-transparency: affixation (freedom) – modification of base (sing – song) – conversion (cut (V) – cut (N)) – subtraction (cf. Dressler 1994: 97). In general, additive processes (affixation, compounding) and iconic reduplication are regarded as more transparent than conversion, base

206

modification or subtraction. Since vowel change, suppletion and subtraction are not attested as word-formation processes in Early Sranan, I will use the following two-dimensional scale of semantic transparency in the present investigation:

(2) more semantically transparent

less semantically transparent

compounding, affixation with no root changes, iconic reduplication

conversion, non-iconic reduplication, base modification, suppletion

Another ‘universal’ factor that will be applied in the present work is that of morphotactic transparency, which is defined by Dalton-Puffer (1996: 56) as a scale for complex words which reflects “how well their morphophonemic shape reflects their morphosemantic compositionality”. Dalton-Puffer presents a rather detailed, eight-level scale of morphotactic transparency which is, however, not necessary for the purposes of the present analysis. I will therefore use a simplified version of Dalton-Puffer’s scale by dividing complex words in two broad classes:

(3) more morphotactically transparent

less morphotactically transparent

complex words containing morphemes that do not trigger morphophonological alternations and exhibiting no allmorphy

complex words containing morphemes that trigger resyllabification, vowel alternation, stress change, suppletion etc.

Markedness will be viewed as a combinations of the concepts just mentioned. Thus, structures that are more structurally complex, and less semantically and morphotactically transparent, will be regarded as marked.

207

In the present chapter, the factors just specified will be employed in discussing and explaining different phenomena and processes that took place in the emergence of Early Sranan word-formation.
7.2. Formation of nouns

The morpheme man is attested independently in Early Sranan in the meaning ‘man (male person)/husband’:

1 For reasons of space, only one orthographic variant of a given word, randomly chosen, will be presented in the present study even if several different variants are found in the sources. The full list of all variants is provided in the appendix. 2 I have written the morpheme man in brackets here to indicate the fact that Van Dyk (c1765: 5) does not mention this morpheme explicitly in combination with lessi, but only implies it via enumeration: ‘Worke man, lessi.’
208

(5) a. mi habi man 1SG have ø husband Arends (1995b: 185): ‘I have a husband.’ Van Dyk (c1765: 65): ‘Ik heb een Man.’
b. Humenni man ju ben habi kaba? QM-many man 2SG PST have already ‘How many men have you had already?’ Schumann (1783: 107): ‘Wie viele Männer hast du schon gehabt?’
The independently occurring lexeme man and the morpheme -man as in (4), however, differ in their meaning. Whereas the lexeme man in (5) has a clearly male reference and means ‘man/husband’, the meaning of the morpheme -man in (4) should be regarded as ‘person’ since it is used to refer to both female and male referents. Thus, bére-mán ‘pregnant woman’, troke man ‘woman who accompanies dancing with solo singing’ are nouns with female reference, whereas hondiman ‘hunter’ is a noun that refers to an activity that must have been carried out by male referents. Although there are some complex words for which one might argue that the meaning of the morpheme -man in them is ‘man (male person)’, and not ‘person’, as in jájoman ‘ein luderlicher Kerl’; njuman ‘junge ledige Mannperson’, and obiaman ‘ein Hexenmeister’ (Schumann 1783: 70; 123; 126)3, such items are rather rare: e.g. in Schumann there are only 3 such words out of 67 man-types attested. Interestingly, there is also a difference in the orthography of the two morphemes in Schumann (cf. Van den Berg 2003: 244): when the morpheme in question has the meaning ‘man’, it is written predominantly with double <nn>, whereas -man as the second element in complex words is written with one <n> in all but one case where a complex word has two spelling variants: <obiaman> and <obiamann>. This complex word, remarkably, has the meaning ‘male magician’ which prompts a suggestion that the morpheme man(n) might have the meaning ‘man’ rather than ‘person’ in it.
In Early Sranan, therefore, the morpheme -man fulfils the specific function of a person marker, similarly to the agentive or person markers in other languages

Of all the four patterns, the one in (6b) is the most productive one in Early Sranan. It yields 12 words (types) of the total 23 types attested in Van Dyk, 33 out of 67 in Schumann and 33 out of 64 in Focke. Man-words created by the five patterns are attested in all the three sources. Although a number of the same man-words occur through all the three sources, such as granman ‘governor’, ferviman ‘painter’, djariman ‘gardener’ etc., each source also contains man-words that are not attested in the other two.
Structurally, man-constructs in Early Sranan can be subdivided into three different types. The first type comprises words with the structure [N-man]N, where the first nouns can be both common concrete (e.g. botte ‘boat’ as in botteman) and abstract (e.g. asêh ‘witchcraft’ as in aséhman). The first elements are primarily simplex non-multifunctional bases, although a few complex ones are attested as well, as in boonjamman ‘person who has gout’ where the noun boonjam (boneeat) ‘gout’ is complex. On the level of syntax, the complex nouns of the [N-man]N type function as syntactic atoms, and are right-headed constructs with a modifierhead structure.

210

The second structural type, [V-man]N, is exemplified in (4b) and comprises words, whose first elements are simplex verbs denoting an activity. These verbs can be both transitive (schrifi ‘to write’; hondi ‘to hunt’) and intransitive (kry ‘to cry’).
In a number of man-attestations, the first elements are multifunctional items attested as both verbs and nouns in the sources, such as dóeman ‘doer’, where the first element can be both a noun, ‘deed’, and a verb, ‘to do’, or gongossaman ‘hypocrite/betrayer’, where gongossa is attested as both a verb, ‘to betray/to be hypocritical, traitorous’, and a noun, ‘hypocrisy/betrayal’.
In the words exhibiting the third structural type, [A-man]N, presented in (4c), the first slot is occupied by elements that can be both adjectives and verbs in Early Sranan. Since, however, they fulfil the modification function and usually denote a physical or psychic characteristic of the referent, such as lessi ‘lazy’, grídi ‘greedy’, siki ‘ill’ etc, I will regard them as adjectives.
Different types of man-constucts can be generally formalised in terms of constructional idioms in the following way:

(7) [[X]N[man]]N [[X]A[man]]N [[X]V[man]]N

‘connected with X’/possessor of X’ ‘characterised by X’ ‘doer of X’

The question that arises now is what influenced the emergence of the patterns in (7) and how -man came to function as a person marker in Early Sranan. For this purpose, the marker -man will be compared with the person markers attested in its source languages. Since English has an item that is homophonous with the Early Sranan -man, it will be the starting point for the discussion.
According to the OED, the English man, beside the meaning ‘adult male person’ also has the meaning ‘a human being irrespective of sex or age’, which was the prevailing meaning of this word in Old English and is also attested in a few instances from later periods. The English man is also a part of quite a number of compounds, such as chapman, landsman, craftsman, doomsman, coalman, milkman. According to Marchand (1969: 60-61), the English compounds with -man go back to the Old English period and have been in use ever since. There are both structural and semantic parallels between the English and the Early Sranan
211

man-constructs. Thus, like the Early Sranan -man, the English man is attested in combination with nouns, as e.g. countryman, harvestman, horseman and adjectives, as e.g. freeman, deadman, Englishman. Semantically, the English mancompounds exhibit the following major patterns, all of which are attested in Middle English:
(8) a. ‘man whose occupation is connected with BASE, where BASE is an object,
an institution, a place’ milkman, coalman, timber-man, churchman, boatman, headman
b. ‘man who is BASE, where BASE denotes a quality or a characteristic’
freeman, old man, poor man, sickman, deadman, blindman
c. ‘man who uses BASE as an instrument’
axe-man, swordsman
Out of the patterns in (8), the first two have correspondences in Early Sranan, as the comparison with (6) reveals. Interestingly, a number of Early Sranan manwords, such as friman, gendriman, kondreman, heddiman, workoman, sikiman and potiman display striking phonological similarities to their English equivalents: freeman, gentleman, countryman, headman, workman, sick man, and poor man. Some of these words have the same meaning as in English, e.g. friman or workoman. However, sometimes there may be a semantic difference between the Early Sranan words and their English equivalents. As Van den Berg (2003: 238) suggests, the Sranan kondreman does not refer to a person from the same country only, but also to a person from the same village. On the one hand, this indicates that formal similarity should be treated with caution since words that exhibit such a similarity might have been Sranan’s own creations, and not just borrowings from English. On the other hand, it can be suggested that at least some of the man-items have entered Sranan through borrowing from English.
In general, there are three major differences between the English and the Early Sranan man-constructs. First, the English noun man has the features [+male], [+human], [+adult] in the compounds above, whereas in Early Sranan -man is not specified for the feature [+male] in the complex words under analysis. Second, man-constructs in Early Sranan exhibit three semantic patterns which have no parallels among the English man-compounds: ‘person involved in BASE’, ‘person who possesses BASE’ and ‘person who has illness BASE’. The former pattern is attested with the suffix -er in English, the person marker which
212

occurs with verbs, as in seller, writer, singer, and which did not survive in Early Sranan. The third difference is of structural nature: whereas the Early Sranan manwords may have verbs in their first position, there are no English man-compounds with verbs as first elements. As a generalisation, one can say that Early Sranan man-constructs differ from the English ones both in the semantics and function of the morpheme -man and in the semantics and structure of constructs this marker surfaces in.
Let us now turn to the the question of whether substratum languages might have been the source for the person marker -man. Substratum languages of Early Sranan have a variety of person markers. Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 189) show that Fongbe has an agentive suffix, -tç@, an attributive suffix, -nç$, that also occur as nouns meaning ‘father’ and ‘mother’ respectively, and the provenance suffixes -tç@ and -nu.$ Ewe also makes use of at least three different person markers, -la (originally the verb ‘be’), -to (originally the noun ‘father’) and -no (originally the noun ‘mother’) (Schlegel 1856: 25-29). Another substratum language, Twi exhibits two different person markers -ni and -fọ which were originally independent nouns meaning ‘people/person’ (Christaller 1875: 24). Strikingly, the person markers from all the three languages exhibit the same range of functions presented in (9) (examples for Fongbe are from Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 189-191; 230-232); for Ewe from Schlegel (1856: 25-29); for Twi from Christaller (1875: 24-25)):

All semantic types of constructs in (9), except for the one in (9f), are attested in Early Sranan. The pattern in (9f) is, however, attested in the modern Surinamese creoles, such as Eastern Maroon Creole: saanan-man (Suriname-PM) ‘citizen of Suriname’ (Migge 2003a: 80). It can be hypothesised therefore that either this type did not exist in Early Sranan and developed later, or it existed, but was possibly not frequently used.
Beside the general similarity between the semantic types of constructs with the person markers, there are also striking semantic parallels on the level of individual items. Thus, some of the substratum items from (9) have direct Early Sranan equivalents, such as bére-mán and a$dç$go-$ nç$ (which both consist of the elements meaning ‘belly’ and a person marker and both mean ‘pregnant woman’) or boasiman and gùdù-nç$ that both consist of an element with the meaning ‘leprosy’ and a person marker and both have the meaning ‘person who has leprosy’, or aséhman and a$ze@-tç@, both meaning ‘magician’ where the first elements denote ‘magic’. Because of these one-to-one structural and semantic parallels between Early Sranan and substratum words, we can assume that they entered Early Sranan through calquing.
There are, however, also examples, where Early Sranan items differ from the equivalent substratum items in the semantics of their components, as illustrated by the Sranan helpiman (help-PM) and the Fon vı-@ jı-@ tç@ (child-yieldPM), both meaning ‘midwife’, or the Sranan doofuman (deaf-PM) and the Fongbe to@-(ku@)ku@-nç (ear-die/dead-PM), both meaning ‘deaf person’. Interestingly, most substratum words that do not have direct correspondences in Early Sranan have the N-V-PM structure. All substratum N-V-PM words are rendered by V-PM, A-PM or N-PM combinations. This development can be explained in terms of simplification on the one hand, and I will discuss it in greater detail below. On the

214

other hand, there are no English man-compounds with this structure. Therefore, there was no corresponding model for the transfer of N-V-PM structures from the substratum. In general, it can be suggested that in developing their lexicons, creole creators transferred items from their first languages on the one hand, and coined innovations on the other, especially when the substratum patterns were more complex.
From the structural point of view, both similarities and differences between Early Sranan man-constructs and the substratum ones are also evident. (10) presents an overview of structural patterns attested with the person markers in different substratum languages:

Both in the substratum languages and in Early Sranan, person markers occur in combination with nouns and verbs. Remarkably, the substratum markers do not combine with adjectives, as the marker -man does. This, however, is not a principled difference, since in Early Sranan, adjectives are multifunctional and are also attested as verbs. Therefore, forms like akufiato (be lazy-PM) ‘lazybones’ in Ewe and lesiman (lazy-PM) can be regarded as identical from the structural point of view. A real difference, on the other hand, lies in the fact that the substratum languages have a lot of words of the type N-V-PM, while Early Sranan makes use of V-PM or A-PM constructs instead. Even if we assume that the absence of such structures in the early sources is accidental, and they indeed existed in Early Sranan, we must admit that their frequency must have been very low in

215

comparison with other patterns which are amply presented in the data5. How can this fact be accounted for?
Brousseau (1989a) explains the similar absence of N-V-PM structures in Haitian with the fact that verbs in Fongbe require a direct object obligatorily and many of its verbal concepts are combinations of a verb and an object, whereas that is not the case in Haitian. The same explanation can be applied to Early Sranan, where verbs do not obligatorily require objects and are predominantly simplex. However, this type of argumentation does not explain why Early Sranan (and Haitian) did not show or make use of this feature to the extent to which it is done in the substratum languages. Note that English also makes use of the structures in question, such as law-maker, paper-hanger, fire-eater, water-drinker etc, which have been frequently used since Old English period (Koziol 1972: 58), so that the absence in the lexifier cannot be taken as a reason either. The reason might lie in a greater structural complexity of such structures and the prediction I will make here is that structures which are formally more complex will tend to develop later in the creole. The support for such an assumption comes from first language acquisition. Clark (1993: 150) shows that children learning English as their first language also start with producing compounds of the type pull-man or wash-man, and it is only later that the synthetic structures such as wagon-puller emerge in children’s lexicons. Clark accounts for this phenomenon in terms of simplicity: combining two bare roots such as pull and man is a simpler option than combining a root, or two roots and an affix which is not as transparent and as salient as a bare root. Projecting this onto Early Sranan, one might suggest that Sranan’s creators also preferred the bare-root option at the initial stages and turned to the more complex V-N-man combinations later.
To sum up, I have shown that both semantically and structurally, the Early Sranan person marker exhibits much greater similarities to the markers from substratum languages than to those from the lexifier. Remarkably, semantic properties seem to be more crucial, and thus more salient in transfer: whereas there are structural differences between the substratum and the Early Sranan
5 Van den Berg (2003: 242) mentions that synthetic compounds such as figi-strati-man (sweepstreet-PM) ‘street sweeper’ are attested in modern Sranan. However, this does not allow any definite suggestions about the time of their origin since they still might have developed later.
216

constructs with the person marker, semantically, there is almost a one-to-one correspondence between them.
Let us now turn to the second question meantioned above, the question of how -man came to be the person marker in Early Sranan. Several different scenarios can be imagined here.
Since relexification is employed as an explanation in one of the current creolisation theories (Lefebvre 1998), we can assume that the Early Sranan -man emerged through relexification of a substratum person marker. Within the Relexification Hypothesis, relexification of an item is viewed as copying of its substratum entry and relabelling it with a lexifier form. The problem with this scenario is that it is difficult to prove that the Early Sranan -man has one-to-one correspondence to a certain substratum suffix. Even though -man exhibits very close similarity to some substratum suffixes such as the Gbe -tç@/to and Twi -fo,∞ it is questionable whether it can be regarded as their copy. In Fongbe, for instance, -tç@ can render the meanings ‘doer/maker of the base’ and ‘inhabitant of N’, but not the meaning ‘person characterised by BASE, where BASE denotes a property/characteristic’. In Ewe, -to is not used to render the meaning ‘person involved in activity BASE’. The Twi -fo∞ is not used to denote inhabitants of some place.
Another argument against the exact copying of a given substratum affix is that substratum words containing suffixes other than -to and -fo, such as the Fongbe suffix -no or the Ewe -la correspond to items with the suffix -man in Early Sranan. One can assume that this might have been the result of dialect levelling and that different substratum suffixes have been relexified by different suffixes in Sranan which have been levelled to one suffix -man later. This scenario cannot be supported on several grounds. First, the data we are dealing with come from three different sources, but all of them uniformly use -man. All the other creoles that are related to Sranan, such as Saramaccan or Ndjuka, also use -man as the only person marker. Finally, if there were any variation, the probability to trace it at the early stages of Sranan’s development must have been much greater than at later stages. This potentially reduces the possibility of variation.
217

All in all, the discussion above suggests that to maintain the relexification hypothesis of -man, we have to admit that several substratum lexical entries were merged into one in the creole language. However, this is against the definition of relexification provided above. This scenario also does not take into account the parallels to the superstratum, which are evident.
Another possible scenario involves grammaticalisation. Since the morpheme man is also attested as the noun ‘man’ in Early Sranan, we are tempted to suggest that the semantics of -man has undergone the process of conceptual expansion from the meaning ‘man’ to the meaning ‘person’, which is an indicator of grammaticalisation process (Hopper and Tragott 1993; Heine, Claudi and Hünnermeyer 1991). In this type of expansion the meaning is bleached from the more concrete ‘man’ to the more abstract ‘person’. Such development has parallels in other languages of the world where items with the meaning ‘man’ are used as classifiers for human beings (Heine and Kuteva 2002: 207-208). However, in the case of Early Sranan -man, the process of grammaticalisation must have taken place within a very short time span, since constructs with -man as a person marker have been attested as early as 1807, and, as Van den Berg (2003: 247) suggests, -man might have functioned as the person marker at the very onset of creolisation, already in the 17th century. In this connection Van den Berg (2003: 248) argues that the grammaticalisation of man might be regarded as ‘instantaneous grammaticalisation’, the term used by Bruyn (1996: 42) to refer to grammaticalisation-like processes that took place within a very short time span, often under the influence of the corresponding substratum patterns.
There is one problem with the grammaticalisation scenario. The term ‘grammaticalisation’, even if labelled ‘instantaneous’ in the case of the Early Sranan -man, presupposes that the emergence of -man as a person marker was a directional process: first an item man(n) meaning ‘adult human person’ existed in the creole language which was then turned into or used as a person marker. However, we have no firm evidence whether any such directionality was involved in the case of -man. Therefore, the term ‘instantaneous grammaticalisation’ might be useful in those cases where the directionality is possible to establish, but the process still took place within a very short period of time. An alternative might be that the item man had these two different functions at the very beginning: that of the noun meaning ‘adult male human being’ and that of a person marker. Note
218

that creole creators had evidence for the use of the English morpheme man as a person marker in compounds such as headman, countryman, etc. This points to the fact that reanalysis of structures, and not necessarily some kind of grammaticalisation, might have played a role.
Indeed, a scenario with an emphasis on structures and not on individual morphemes is advanced by Migge (2003a: 84; cf. also Braun 2001: 54-56) who suggests that creole creators reanalysed the English morpheme man in compounds such as boatman, workman etc. as a suffix according to the corresponding derivational models available in their L1. She argues that creole creators projected the structural patterns of their L1 words into the English compound words and reinterpreted them as consisting of a stem and an affix rather than of two free morphemes. They then associated the free morpheme man with the suffixes in their L1 languages and reanalysed it as a nominal suffix. This scenario differs from the grammaticalisation and the relexification scenario presented above in one crucial point: it gives the major role not to the individual marker, but to constructs this marker surfaces in: the creole creators encountered the English man-words, identified them as similar to the equivalent words in their native languages, isolated man in them, associated it with the person markers in the native languages and used it as a person marker in new formations. As Migge supposes, the English man-compounds served as the frames for the new creole structures. This is supported by the fact that the morpheme man and not somma ‘person’, for instance, was used in the person marker function: for somma, there were no person-marking structures with somma (< Engl. somebody) in the input to model new creole words on.
Although I agree with Migge in principle, I have two objections to her scenario in particular. First, the number and type of the English man-compounds is both semantically and structurally a different one than the number and types of the Early Sranan patterns with -man. In this connection it is unclear what Migge views as ‘frame’: only the general X-man structure of man-compounds in English or the more concrete structures. The second problem is that the meaning of the element -man in the English compounds is ‘male adult’ and not ‘person’. Therefore, I suggest that crucially, two processes were involved in the emergence of the man-patterns in Early Sranan: acquisition of some English man-compounds and transfer of a number of substratum words.
219

Creole creators might have acquired the lexifier item man as having at least two functions: the noun ‘man’, and the person marker. Two facts might have determined the acquisition of man in this manner. First, as I have mentioned above, the noun man was sometimes used in the meaning ‘person’ in English, so that the creole creators might have had the evidence for the meaning ‘person’. Second, English compounds with -man bear similarity to the substratum structures with person markers. Parallel to the acquisition of the superstratum man, the creole creators also acquired several English man-compounds. This is corroborated by the fact that there are a number of Early Sranan compounds that have a one-to-one correspondence to English. In this way, the role of -man as a person marker came to be established in Early Sranan. Additionally, creole creators transfered (or calqued6) a number of substratum words, substituting different person markers by the morpheme -man. This is confirmed by the fact that there are a number of Early Sranan words that have one-to-one correspondences to substratum words. Since speakers of different substratum languages and varieties were involved in this process, it explains why words with person affixes from different substratum languages uniformly entered the creole with the person marker -man. These two initial processes, acquisition of man and man-compounds, and transfer of substratum constructs with person markers, lead to the use of the person marker -man analogically in the formation of innovations in Early Sranan.
This scenario would then account for facts that remain unclear within other scenarios. Thus, in contrast to the relexification scenario of the individual person marker, this scenario accounts for the fact why there are structural and semantic discrepancies between individual substratum markers and the Early Sranan -man. It would explain, for instance, that there are only few, if at all, V-N-man constructs in Early Sranan, whereas in the substratum languages they are abundant. Supposedly, only few of such structures were transferred, in contrast to other ones, such as N-man or V-man. The preference for N-man and V-man structures instead of V-N-man structures has been already discussed above. Second, it would explain why -man combines the semantic properties of many
6 Hereafer the term ‘calque’ is defined following Sebba (1997: 119) as “a literal translation of a lexical item or pattern, which produces a word or phrase that in form resembles the lexifier language, but semantically reproduces the structure of the substrate.”
220

substratum affixes, and not just of one. We have seen above that some Early Sranan words have equivalent words in different substratum varieties and languages, and not just in one. All these words with different substratum affixes have Early Sranan correspondences with -man, and not with some other marker. If we view relexification of an item as copying of its substratum entry, such phenomena remain unclear. However, if we assume that whole words, and not the lexical entries of separate markers were transferred, it does not come as a surprise. After having identified man as a person marker, different substratum words with person markers were uniformly transferred with it.
The final question I would like to address here is why the creole creators chose -man, and not some English agentive suffix, such as -er. I suppose that three factors can be made responsible here: saliency, morphotactic transparency and frequency of man-compound types in the input. The task learners are usually facing in the acquisition of vocabulary is to isolate the words and elements crucial for communication and for formation of new words (Clark 1993: 126). The process of isolation proceeds faster when the forms are easily identifiable, and this is the case when the forms are stressed, free and not marred by morphophonological processes (cf. Siegel 1999 on linguistic constraints for transfer). In this respect, the English -man is a better option than the agentive suffix -er: it is more morphotactically transparent. The short period of English presence in Suriname might have been an obstacle to the appearance of -er or other English agentive suffixes in Early Sranan. Besides, man is a frequently occurring item in English which might also have facilitated its choice as a person marker.
This development has parallels in both first and second language acquisition. Clark (1993: 150) shows that in the L1 acquisition of English, children first use compounds with man and only later start using affixes. Compounds with man, such as brood-man (bread-man) ‘baker’ or shop-man is also the first choice L2 learners of English make in creating agentive nouns (Broeder et al. 1993: 47). Besides, -man, and not -er, or other English agentive suffix is used in quite a number of creole languages, e.g. in Tok Pisin: draiwaman ‘driver’, gavman ‘government official’ (Hellinger 1985: 119); in Krio: tifman ‘thief’, sikman ‘patient’, badman ‘pleasant rascal’, belman ‘convincing talker’ (Jones 1995: 123, 125, 133), and in Jamaican Creole: hontaman ‘hunter’,

amerika(n)man ‘American’ (Dijkhoff 1993: 56). This further supports my hypothesis.
In conclusion, I have shown that Early Sranan made use of the person marker -man to express a number of different meanings. Its emergence was a rather complex process that cannot be reduced to one type of influence only, be it substratum influence, or universals of language acquisition.

7.2.2. Constructs with the gender marker man(n)-

Beside complex words with the person marker -man, there are a number of complex words in Early Sranan where man(n)- (< Engl. man) occurs in the leftmost position:

(11) a. man-anéisi ‘a kind of anise’
mannsanni ‘male genitals’ mán-skapoe ‘ram’
b. mann-futuboi ‘male servant’
man-Ningre ‘male Black’ mannpikin ‘boy/son’ mán-soema ‘male person’

anéisi (N)7 sanni (N) skápoe (N) futuboi (N) Ningre (N) pikin (N) soema (N)

‘anise’

Fo

‘thing’

Sch

‘sheep’

Fo

‘servant’

Sch

‘Black’

Sch

‘child’

Sch

‘human being/person’ Fo

It has already been mentioned above that the lexeme man(n) has the meaning ‘adult male person/husband’ in Early Sranan. However, in the examples in (11a), the meaning of man(n)- is not ‘adult male person’, but ‘male’. Man(n) is also attested in the meaning ‘male of an animal or a plant’ outside complex words in Focke and Schumann, as it is shown in (12):

7 For the sake of simplicity, I hereafter usually indicate only one lexical category of the base the one I consider the derivational basis for the pertinent word, despite the fact that many lexical items are multifunctional in Early Sranan. In those cases, where the lexical category of the derivational basis cannot be uncontroversially established, I provide two or more indications of lexical categories the given item can have in Early Sranan.
222

(12) a. Tu doifi, mann nanga uman. two dove male with female ‘Two doves, male and female.’ Schumann (1783: 33): ‘Ein paar Tauben.’
b. Dissi ha weti heddi, dem no meki, da mann. this have white head 3PL NEG make it-be male ‘These (trees) have white buds, they bear no fruit for they are males.’ Schumann (1783: 63): ‘...aber die mit weissen Knospen tragen keine Frucht, sie sind männlichen Geschlechts.’
c. dà man-wan nannga dà hóeman-wan DEF male-one with DEF female-one ‘the male and the female (of animals)’ Focke (1855: 46): ‘het mannetje en het wijfje (van dieren)’
In contrast to the examples in (11a), in the examples in (11b) man(n) is used with nouns denoting human beings and its meaning is ambiguous between ‘man’ and ‘male’. The word mannpikin, for instance, can be paraphrased as ‘a child of male sex’ rather than ‘a child who is an adult male being’. This is corroborated by the translation provided in Focke (1855: 76): ‘kind van ‘t mannelijk geslacht’ (‘child of male sex’). In the case of man-Ningre, however, the situation is not that clear: we can paraphrase it as ‘a Black who is an adult male human being’ and as ‘male Black’. Focke (1855: 76) remarks in this respect that this word stands in contrast to the word Ningr’oeman which he translates as ‘Negerin’, i.e. ‘female Black’. Remarkably, the two Early Sranan words with man(n)- where the second noun denotes a person’s ethnicity, such as man-Ningre and man-kabúgru have corresponding words with uman/hóeman where uman/hoeman occurs postpositionally to the base noun, and not prepositionally. As it will be shown in the next section, in nouns in which uman/hóeman is used postpositionally, the meaning of uman/hóeman is not ‘female’, but rather ‘female adult’. I will argue here that by analogy, in the nouns with man(n)- where the base denotes a person’s ethnicity, the meaning of man(n)- is ‘adult male human being’. Naturally, one should ask why then man(n)- occurs prepositionally in such nouns, whereas in the corresponding words denoting females uman/hoeman is postposed. This fixed initial position of man(n) in the meaning ‘male adult’ may be explained by the
223

fact that the rightmost position in complex words is possibly reserved for the person marker -man. In general it can be assumed that in nouns with preposed man(n)- that have equivalent nouns with postposed uman/hóeman the meaning of man(n)- is not ‘male’, but ‘male adult’. It has a further consequence that in the meaning ‘male’ man(n) can be regarded as a natural gender marker in words in (11), since it serves the function of differentiating the objects/persons according to sex. In contrast, in words where man(n) means ‘man’, i.e. ‘adult male human being’, man(n) does not serve this function, but indicates that a certain person belongs to the class of ‘adult male human beings’.
Let us now take a closer look at the semantic and structural properties of man(n)- constructs.
Semantically, several patterns with man(n)- can be distinguished, depending on the meaning of the second elements:

(13) a. ‘male BASE, where BASE denotes an animal’

man-dâgoe

‘male-dog’

‘male dog’

Fo

man-doksi

‘male-anise’

‘a kind of anise’

Fo

mán-slábbiki ‘male-a special plant’

c. ‘male BASE, where BASE denotes a human being’

Sch

‘male-child’

mán-soema ‘male-human being/person’ ‘male person’

Fo

d. ‘male BASE, where BASE denotes a person’s occupation’

mann-futuboi ‘male-servant’

‘male servant’

Sch

e. ‘male BASE, where BASE denotes a thing’

mannplesi

‘male genitals’

Sch

mannsanni

‘male-thing’

‘male genitals’

Sch

mannskin

‘male-body’

‘male genitals’

Sch

The last pattern deserves a special comment. All man(n)-constructs in (13e) correspond to this pattern, and all of them have the meaning ‘male genitals’. Although the words skin ‘body’, sanni ‘thing’ and plesi ‘place’ are not attested in the meaning ‘genitals’ in the sources, their meaning might have undergone a

224

conceptual expansion to ‘genitals’. Therefore, alternatively, the semantic pattern in (9e) can also be presented as ‘male BASE, where BASE denotes a body part’.
As the overview in (13) shows, most words to which man(n)- attaches have the feature [+animate] and all of them are able to bear the feature [+male]. In general we can say that the element man(n)- combines only with words denoting objects able to bear the feature [+male].
Structurally man(n)-constructs are combinations of man(n)- and mostly simplex, non-multifunctional nouns. The second elements are both semantic and syntactic heads of man(n)-constructs.
To summarise, the structural and semantic characteristics of man(n)constructs can be presented in the following constructional idiom:

(14) [[man(n)][X]N]N

‘male X’

Constructs in which a noun denoting an adult human being is used as a natural gender marker are attested in both the lexifier and the substratum languages. Thus, the English noun man can be used appositively meaning ‘male’ in the following patterns, all of which are attested already in Middle English:

(15) a. ‘male BASE, where BASE denotes a person’s occupation’
man nurse, man-midwife, manservant
b. ‘male BASE, where BASE denotes a human being’
man-child, man-friend
c. ‘male BASE, where BASE denotes an animal’
man seal
All the three patterns have parallels in Early Sranan. However, the use of the English man with names of animals, as in (15c), is defined by OED as occasional, whereas in Early Sranan quite a number of words exhibit this pattern. Remarkably, all Early Sranan examples in (11a) correspond to simplex words in English, such as drake, cock, ram, etc. Besides, the English man is very rarely attested with names of plants, which is not the case with the Early Sranan man(n)-. Structurally, both Early Sranan words in (11a) and the English examples in (15) are combinations of the gender marker and a noun, where this second noun is the head.

225

English is not unique is using the noun meaning ‘man’ in the genderindicating function. Boretzky (1983: 85-87) argues that the words with the meaning ‘male/man’ and ‘female/woman’ are often used in the languages of South-East Asia and West Africa to indicate the natural gender, and provides relevant examples from a number of West African languages. Moreover, Boretzky (1983: 86-87) shows that this pattern is found in several creole languages other than Sranan, e.g. Krio, Saramaccan, and Sao Tomé Angolar Príncipe, a Portuguese-based creole of the Gulf of Guinea. Heine and Kuteva (2002: 209) mention that in some languages, including Ewe, nouns with the meaning ‘man’ have been grammaticalised to derive items denoting male participants. In Ewe the noun atsú ‘husband’ is used as the suffix ‘male’ with nouns denoting animal, plant and river names, as it is shown in (16a) and (16b), and the noun útsu ‘man’ is used as the suffix meaning ‘male’ with nouns denoting animate beings, as it is shown in (16c) (Heine and Kuteva 2002: 209, cf. Westermann 1907: 48). The data in (16) are taken from Schlegel (1856: 225; 235; 250; 269; 289; 310) and Westermann (1907: 48-49):

(16) a. ‘male BASE, where BASE denotes an animal’

gbagbaχe-tšu gbõ-tšu koklo-tšú nyi-tšu só-tšu

‘drake’ ‘goat’ ‘cock’ ‘ox’ ‘stallion’

gbagbaχe (e)gbõ koklo nyi so

‘duck’ ‘nanny goat’ ‘chicken’ ‘cow’ ‘horse’

b. ‘male BASE, where BASE denotes a plant’

adibā-@ tsú

‘male papaya’ adibā¤

‘papaya’

c. ‘male BASE, where BASE denotes a human being’

vi-nũtšu

‘son’

vi

‘child’

d. ‘male BASE where BASE denotes a person’s occupation’

dolá-nutsǔ ‘man servant’ dola

‘servant/messenger’

Similar patterns exist in two other substratum languages of Early Sranan. In Twi the noun obarímá ‘man’ and oníni ‘male of animals’ can be added to nouns denoting persons and animals respectively, as in abofrá bàrímá (child-man) ‘boy’ and okókonini (chicken-male) ‘cock’ (Christaller 1875: 32). In Kikongo the adjective ekoko ‘male’ can be attached to the nouns denoting animals, as in ebokolo diekoko (sheep-male) ‘ram’, and the noun ayakala ‘man’ to nouns denoting persons, as in nleke a eyakala (child-man) ‘a male child’, to indicate the male gender (Bentley 1887: 172; 563).

226

A comparison of the Early Sranan man(n)-constructs in (11) and the substratum data in (16) shows striking parallels, both semantically and structurally. Thus, almost all semantic types of man(n)-constructs exist in the substratum as well. Besides, almost all Ewe words in (16) have direct complex correspondences in Early Sranan, in contrast to English, where most equivalents are simplex. Structurally both the Early Sranan constructs and the substratum words consist of a gender marker and a noun, where the noun serves as the head.
There are, however, also two differences between the Early Sranan man(n)- and the gender markers of the substratum languages.
First, in most substratum languages, two different items are employed as gender markers, depending on the semantics of the noun with which they combine: one marker is used for nouns denoting animals, plants and rivers, and a different one with nouns denoting human beings. In Early Sranan, one form, man(n), is used in both functions. Why is it so? One reason might be that the creole creators did not identify the English equivalent for the substratum gender marker used with names of plants and animals, which would be male. Possibly, this word did not enter the creole language because of first, its lower frequency of occurrence in comparison to man, and second, because it does not belong to the core communicative vocabulary which is usually preserved in pidginisation and creolisation. Finally, the short period of English presence and the limited access to the target variety might have played its role as well. Another reason can lie in the fact that the English man is also used in the gender-indicating function. Creole creators might, for instance, have identified it as the item that can have the meaning ‘male’ beside the meaning ‘adult male human being’ and used it as the noun meaning ‘man’ and a gender-indicating marker. Remarkably, the substratum forms might have facilitated this process. In Ewe, for instance, the gender markers nũtšu ‘man’ and tšu ‘male’ are related: the latter is a component of the former which is literally a combination of n*ũ ‘figure’ and tšu ‘male’. This might also have triggered the association of the English man with both the meaning ‘adult male human being’ and ‘male’.
The second difference lies in the position of this marker in the creole language and its substratum: it is a preposed element in Early Sranan and a postposed one in all substratum languages. A potential explanation is advanced by Lefebvre (1998: 39) who argues that the creole creators identify the major
227

category lexical items of the substratum language and therefore acquire the directionality properties of the superstratum major category lexical items. Therefore, the order of major category lexical items in the creole parallels the order of such items in the superstratum language. The position of the head in compounds, for instance, must be the same in both the creole and the superstratum language because it is determined by the position of the syntactic head in phrases, which, in its turn, comes from the superstratum (Lefebvre 1998: 341-342). Lefebvre’s predictions about word order explain why there is a discrepancy between the position of the gender markers in Sranan and in its substratum languages: the Sranan element order in man(n)-constructs follows that of English, in which the morphological heads are usually set in the rightmost position in word structure. The element man(n)- in the Sranan complex words in (11) is not the head because the only feature these words inherit from the element man(n)- is [+male], while all the other features are inherited from the second elements. It explains why the element man(n)- occupies the leftmost position in the complex words in (11).
Since the parallels to the substratum languages are very close, I will again suggest that man(n) entered Early Sranan as a gender marker through transfer (calquing in particular) of corresponding substratum words with gender markers. This process might have been facilitated by the fact that English has similar constructs so that the creole creators had evidence for the use of man in the meaning ‘male’ in the input. The interesting fact about the transfer is that the two different markers available in the substratum languages were uniformly transferred with one phonetic string man(n)-. One can argue then that two substratum lexical entries ended up as one in the creole language. It again supports the hypothesis that the Early Sranan man(n)- did not enter the creole through copying of the corresponding substratum entry, but via transfer of corresponding substratum words.
228

7.2.3. Constructs with the gender marker (h)oéman-/uman-

Beside the nouns with the gender marker man(n)-, several Early Sranan complex words contain the morpheme uman/homan/hóeman/óeman8 (< Engl. ‘woman’) in the leftmost position:

(17) a. hoéman-dâgoe ‘bitch (female dog)’

dâgoe (N) ‘dog’

Fo

hóeman-slábbiki ‘a plant (Cassia humilis)’ slábbiki (N) ‘a plant’

futuboi (N) ‘servant’

Sch

umanpikin

‘daughter’

pikin (N)

‘child’

Sch

As it was the case with the marker man(n)-, uman- is used with nouns denoting animals and plants, as in (17a), and with nouns denoting human beings as in (17b). Uman is also attested independently in Early Sranan, as the noun ‘woman/wife’, as is shown in (18a) and (18b) and also in the meaning ‘female’ in reference to plants and animals, as it is shown in (18c) and (18d):

(18) a. wi beri da homan disi ben lassi 1PL bury DEF woman REL PST leave Arends (1995b: 234): Let us bury the woman who’s deceased.’ Van Dyk (c1765: 109): ‘Of wy die Neegerin Begraaven moogen die het in de Agter-Middag afgeleid heeft.’
b. Grandeweh a platti nanga hem uman kaba. long ago 3SG separate with his wife already ‘He separated from his wife already long ago.’ Schumann (1783: 140): ‘Schon vor langer Zeit hat er sich von seinem Weib geschieden.’

8 Hereafter, I will refer to this item using mainly the orthographic variant uman-, taken from Schumann (1783), for the sake of simplicity.
229

c. Mammi nanga redi heddi (de) meki, da uman. mammi with red head CNT make it-be female ‘The ‘mammi’ trees with red buds bear fruit, they are females.’ Schumann (1783: 63): ‘Die Mammibäume mit rothen Knospen tragen Frucht, sie sind weiblichen Geschlechts.’
d. Tu doifi, mann nanga uman. two dove male with female ‘Two doves, male and female.’ Schumann (1783: 33): ‘Ein paar Tauben.’

Turning back to the examples in (17), we can observe that the meaning of the preposed uman- is ‘female’ in (17a), but is ambiguous between ‘woman’ and ‘female’ in (17b). In some cases, as e.g. in umanpikin, we can argue that the meaning of uman is ‘female’ and not ‘woman’, because the meaning of the word is ‘child of female sex’ and not ‘a child who is an adult female human being’. In the case of hóeman-soema, however, two interpretations are possible: ‘person of female sex’ and ‘person who is an adult female human being’. Early Sranan also has a number of words where uman/hoeman is used as the second, and not the first element:

(19) a. bakrà-hoeman ‘white lady’

Dju uman

‘Jewish woman’

kabúgru-uman
malatta uman Ningre uman
b. hossi homan
koekroehoman

‘woman with a mixed Indian and mulatto descent’ ‘mulatto woman’
‘black woman’
‘woman servant’
‘kitchen maid’

bakrà (N) ‘White’

kabúgru (N) ‘a person with a Sch

Ningre (N) ‘Black’

Sch

hossi (N)

‘house’

VD

koekroe (N) ‘kitchen’

VD

The constructs in (19a) form the semantic pattern ‘woman whose ethnicity is BASE’, constructs in (19b) have the meaning ‘woman whose occupation is connected with BASE’. It means that the postposed uman/homan/hóeman has the meaning ‘woman’ rather than ‘female’. The item uman/homan/hóeman/oéman should then be regarded as multifunctional in Early Sranan: it functions as a noun, ‘woman/wife’, in postposition and as an adjectival gender marker, ‘female’, when used prepositionally to nouns. Interestingly, the positions of this item in the

230

meaning ‘woman’ and in the meaning ‘female’ are different, in contrast to man(n), where it is the same for the gender marker and the noun ‘adult male human being’. This can be explained by the fact that in contrast to the morpheme -mann, the morpheme uman/homan/hóeman/oéman does not have a homonymous morpheme functioning as the person marker in the rightmost position of complex words.
The semantic types of constructs with the marker uman- are listed in (20):

Structurally, all uman-constructs have a noun in the second position, which is the semantic and syntactic head.
The discussion above allows us to postulate the following constructional idiom for the gender marker uman-:

(21) [[uman][X]N]N

‘female-X’

The question to be persued now is how uman- came to function as the gender marker in Early Sranan, and what parallels to the source languages exist.
Thus, the English noun woman can be attached to nouns denoting occupations appositively to emphasise gender, e.g. a woman doctor, a woman driver. According to the OED, however, the female gender marker is not used unless you need to emphasise which sex the person is or if it is still unusual for the job to be done by a woman. In Early Sranan, on the contrary, uman- is used with a much wider semantic range of nouns, especially those denoting animals
231

and plants. Besides, all Early Sranan words in (20) correspond to simplexes in English. This suggests that English played a very marginal, if any at all, role in the emergence of the Early Sranan uman-constructs.
In contrast to English, there are several languages in which nouns meaning ‘woman’ or ‘wife’ are used as adjectival or derivative markers meaning ‘female’ (Heine and Kuteva 2002: 314). It is exactly the case in Early Sranan’s substratum languages. In Kikongo, for instance, natural female gender is expressed by means of attaching the noun nkento ‘woman’ to the nouns denoting persons and the adjective ankento ‘female’ to nouns denoting animals, e.g. nleke a nkento (childwoman) ‘woman child’, ngombe ankento (ox-female) ‘cow’ (Bentley 1887: 48; 562-563). In Twi, the elements obéa/obā ‘woman’ and obérè ‘the female of animals’ are used to mark natural gender distinctions on nouns, as in abofrá bea (child-GM) or akókoberé (chick-GM) ‘hen’. Twi also marks natural feminine gender by adding the diminutive affix -wa9 to the masculine form, as in aborowa (European-DM) ‘a female European’ or okărā (slave-DM) ‘female slave’ (Christaller 1875: 33). In Ewe, natural female gender is indicated by attaching the morpheme no/= nu meaning ‘female’ to the nouns denoting animals and plants and the noun nyõnù ‘woman’ to the nouns denoting human beings (Westermann 1961: 53; Westermann 1907: 48-49; cf. Heine and Kuteva 2002: 314). The semantic types of constructs with gender markers attested in Ewe are demonstrated in (22). The data are from Schlegel (1856: 235; 250; 269) and Westermann (1907: 48-49).

Almost all Early Sranan words listed in (20) have direct complex equivalents in (22) which indicates that they are calques of corresponding substratum words. As

9 This suffix surfaces as ā when the base it is attached to ends in a/o/e (Christaller 1875: 23).
232

it was the case with man(n)-constructs, there are two major differences between the Early Sranan words with the female gender marker and the substratum words: the position of the markers and the use of two different items, such as nyõnǔ and no, in contrast to one item uman in Early Sranan. The explanations for these discrepancies have been already advanced above in connection to the marker man(n)-. The difference in the position can be explained by the fact that creole creators acquire the word order of the superstratum, and therefore order the morphemes in accordance with superstratum rules. One possible reason for the use of only one male gender marker in Early Sranan instead of two in the substratum languages might lie in the fact that the creole creators failed to identify two gender markers in the superstratum.
In conclusion, transfer of complex items with gender markers from the substratum was one of the major mechanisms in the emergence of Early Sranan female gender marker uman-. As it was the case with the male gender marker man(n)-, two different gender markers used in substratum languages ended up in Sranan as one item.

10 Hereafter, for the sake of convenience, I will mainly refer to the item under analysis by using the orthographic variant pikíen taken from Focke (1855) since most complex words cited in this section contain this orthographic variant.

Pikíen/pikin is attested in a number of different meanings and functions in Early Sranan: as a noun, ‘child’, as in (24a), an adjective, ‘small’, as in (24b), a verb, ‘to be small’, as in (24c), and an adverb in (24d):
(24) a. da mi pikin it-be my child ‘That is my child.’ Schumann (1783: 135): ‘Das ist mein Kind.’
b. wan pikin hangisa INDEF small towel ‘a small towel’ Schumann (1783: 136): ‘ein kleines Tuch’
c. da hosso pikin tumussi DEF house be-small very much ‘The house is too small.’ Schumann (1783: 136): ‘das Haus ist allzuklein.’
d. fumm hem pikin beat 3SG a little ‘Beat him a little.’ Schumann (1783: 136): ‘Schlag ihn ein bisgen!’
Several interesting observations can be made about the item pikíen/pikin in Early Sranan. As the examples in (23a) show, pikin has the meaning ‘young’ primarily in combination with nouns denoting animate objects, such as names of animals (and plants) and human beings. In such cases it is never used predicatively: *Da mann pikin is unattested. In contrast, in the meaning ‘small’ pikin/pikíen is attested with names of inanimate objects, and it is used both predicatively, as the verb ‘to be small’, and attributively, as the adjective ‘small’. Taken the different meanings, especially ‘young’ and ‘small’, and different functions of pikíen, the question arises whether different pikíen-items are related to each other via homonymy, or whether pikíen is a multifunctional item whose lexical entry comprises all these meanings.
A rather similar case exists in Ewe, where the morpheme vı', which is a noun meaning ‘child’, is also used as the marker of diminutivity whose two core
234

meanings are ‘young’ and ‘small’, and as an adverb meaning ‘little/a bit’ (Heine, Claudi and Hünnemeyer 1991: 79-87; 90-91). As Heine, Claudi and Hünnemeyer (1991) show, the emergence of vı@ as a diminutive marker is a complex process involving categorial metaphor, semantic expansion, creativity, context manipulation etc. They suggest that the meanings ‘young’ and ‘small’ are rather polysemous than homophonous. Indeed, there are quite a number of objects in the surrounding world for which the features [YOUNG] and [SMALL] go hand in hand. The names of animals with which pikíen is used often combine these features: pikíen-hagoe (DM-pig) ‘piglet’ is not only a pig that is young, but also a pig that is small. It seems that semantically, these features are related (cf. Wierzbicka 1972: 44-45). I will therefore suggest that pikíen/pikin is a multifunctional item.
Since the meanings such as ‘young’ and ‘small’ are often attributes of diminutive markers, we might ask whether pikíen is a diminutive marker in Early Sranan. To pursue this question, I will take a look at the semantic types of constructs with pikíen-, which are listed in (25)11:

11 In (25) I have used the same names for semantic patterns Heine, Claudi and Hünnemeyer (1991) use for the Ewe vı@ in order to make the Early Sranan data comparable to the Ewe data. 12 Schumann (1783: 59) translates the word pikin hasi as “Ezel”, i.e. ‘donkey’.

The patterns in (25) show that the core meanings of pikíen in complex words are ‘young’ and ‘small’. These are meanings typical of diminutive markers in many other languages of the world (Heine, Claudi and Hünnemeyer 1991: 86). We can therefore regard pikíen as the diminutive marker in constructs in (25). Formally, constructs with the diminutive pikíen- can be presented as the following constructional idiom:

(26) [[pikíen][X]N]N

‘young/small X’

In respect to the origin of the diminutive marker, we must state that in contrast to all the other markers discussed above, which are English-based, it is derived from the Portuguese morpheme pequeno meaning ‘small’, and not from an English morpheme, such as little or small. Since Portuguese was not a major lexifier of Early Sranan, it can be assumed that the item entered Early Sranan through the varieties spoken by Sephardic Jews. This suggests, that the input to creole formation must have contained not only English-based varieties, but also other, e.g. Portuguese-based ones, or there must have been contact between the two that allowed borrowing of the items of Portuguese origin. A different assumption can be advanced on the basis of the fact that pikíen is a rather common word that English sailors and colonists used to denote ‘child’ and which is wide-spead in other English-based creole languages, such as Krio, Cameroon PE, Jamaican (Aceto 1997: 230-231). It shows the variety the creole creators targeted contained many mixed items from different languages that one way or another were involved in the contact situation in Suriname and outside it.
In any case, Portuguese does not seem to deliver a model for Early Sranan constructs with the diminutive marker since the Early Sranan pikíen corresponds to three different words in Portuguese: menino/criança meaning ‘child’, pequeno ‘small’ and jovem/novo ‘young’. In contrast, the substratum languages bear

236

significant similarities to Early Sranan in terms of functions of the diminutive markers. Consider the overview of constructs with the Ewe diminutive vı@ listed in

A comparison of the Early Sranan and the substratum data shows that many patterns, such as ‘young’/‘descendant of BASE’, ‘inexperienced BASE’, ‘small BASE’, ‘smaller, less conspicuous body part than BASE’, etc. are available in both languages. In general, it seems that both the Ewe diminutive marker vı@ and the Early Sranan pikíen share at least two core meanings: ‘young’ and ‘small’.

237

Apart from Ewe, parallels to other substratum languages can be established as well. Fongbe also has the diminutive marker vı@ which combines with animal names in the meaning ‘young BASE’, as in dan$ -vı@ (snake-DM) ‘young snake’, or with other nouns in the meaning ‘small BASE’, e.g. at$ in-vı@ (tree-DM) ‘small tree’ (Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 187-188). In Twi, the diminutive suffix -wa (or ba13), originally the noun oba ‘child’, renders the meanings ‘young’, ‘small’ and also ‘female’, as e.g. abábā´ (woman-DM) ‘a young woman’ or inbépowa (mountain-DM) ‘small mountain’ (Christaller 1875: 23-24; 32). Kikongo makes use of two diminutive markers: kin/kim- meaning ‘small’, as in kinkokokoko (DM-RED-arm) and fi- meaning ‘tiny’, as in finzo (DM-house) ‘a tiny house’ (Bentley 1887: 535-536).
As the discussion above shows, among all substratum languages, the Early Sranan diminutive marker bears close functional parallels to the diminutive affixes in Ewe and Fon. Because of the almost one-to-one semantic correspondences between Early Sranan constructs with pikíen- and the Ewe vı@, one might suggest that the lexical entry of vı@ was copied into Early Sranan by creole creators and relabeled with the lexifier item pikíen. However, there is one problem with this relexification scenario.
The similarity between the Ewe affix vı@ and the Early Sranan pikíen is really great in semantic and functional terms: the Early Sranan pikíen, like the Ewe vı@ can be a noun, ‘child’, the diminutive marker with a range of different meanings, ‘young’ and ‘small’ being the major ones, and an adverb, ‘little/a bit’. However, the Early Sranan pikíen has two additional types of use, which the Ewe item vı@ does not have: the attributive use with inanimate objects in the meaning ‘small size’, and the predicative use ‘to be small’. In Ewe, these functions are fulfilled by a different item, the adjective suE ¤ ‘small’. Heine, Claudi and Hünnermeyer (1991: 83) show that the Ewe vı@ does not indicate that an item is of small size, but rather that it has “the gestalt concept” of small size. The item suE ¤ , which can be used both predicatively and attributively, indicates small size. For instance, if vı@ is attached to the noun Bu¤ meaning ‘drum’, the combination Bu-vı@
13 The form of the diminutive suffix in Twi undergoes different phonological alternations, depending on the preceding sound (for more details, see Christaller 1875: 23).
238

means ‘a small type of drum that is held under the armpit’. If, however, it occurs in combination with suE ,¤ as in Bu¤ suE ¤ (drum-small), the meaning of the combination is ‘a drum of small size’. In Early Sranan, pikíen alone evidently fulfills both functions. Thus, it can combine with nouns to render the meaning ‘the gestalt concept of a small size’, as in pikin aksi (DM-axe) meaning ‘hatchet’ or pikin spûn (DM-spoon) ‘teaspoon’. It can also render the meaning ‘of small size’, as in wan pikin hangisa ‘a small towel’. Beside, like the Ewe suE ¤ , and not like vı@ it can also be the verb ‘to be small’. It means that the Early Sranan pikíen combines the functions and meanings of two different substratum items: vı@ and suE ¤ .
We might of course assume that it must not be necessarily Ewe the Early Sranan creators copied the item pikíen from. In Fongbe, the item vı@ is also a noun, ‘child’, and the diminutive marker ‘young/small’. However, as in Ewe, it is not attested in the predicative use ‘to be small’. The Fongbe adjectives vu¤ and kpE›-vı@ meaning ‘young/small’ that can be used both attributively and predicatively (Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 350-351) differ from the Early Sranan pikíen in the fact that first, they can be used predicatively in the meaning ‘young’, which is not the case with pikíen, and second, they need a copula, e.g. Ío› ‘to be at’, whereas pikíen is used predicatively without any copula.
In conclusion, it can be suggested that the following processes were involved in the emergence of pikíen as the diminutive marker in Early Sranan. Creole creators identified the Portuguese-based element pikíen as corresponding to the diminutive in their native languages because of the partial overlap in meaning. They used this item to transfer substratum words containing the diminutive markers from their L1s. In addition, they identified pikíen as corresponding to the adjectives like Ewe suE ¤ ‘small’ and transferred them using the same phonological form, pikíen. This resulted in a new lexical entry for pikíen that combines the properties of two lexical items in the substratum, such as vı@ and suE .¤ This transfer was also accompanied by reanalysis of such words in terms of the superstratum word-order: whereas Ewe and Fongbe diminutive follows the base, Early Sranan pikíen- precedes the base. This was probably influenced by the fact that in the superstratum, adjectives precede nouns.

7.2.5. Constructs with the augmentative marker mammá-

A few nouns attested in the data contain the morpheme mammá:

(28) mamà arén
mammá-boom

‘ rainshower’ ‘ a huge tree’

arén (N) ‘rain’

Fo

boom (N) ‘tree’

Sch

mammá-sanni ‘a huge thing’

sanni (N) ‘thing’

Sch

mammá-ston

‘a huge stone/big rock’

ston (N) ‘stone’

Sch

This morpheme is attested in the meaning ‘mother of human beings and animals’, ‘foster mother’ (Schumann 1783: 106), and ‘the female of animals’ (Focke 1855: 75). In some complex words its meaning is ‘idol/protecting spirit’. The following examples demonstrate the different uses of mamma:
(29) a. mi mamma ben meki mi my mother PST make 1SG ‘My mother gave birth to me.’ Schumann (1783: 106): ‘Meine Mutter hat mich geboren.’
b. wan mamà-fowloe INDEF mother-hen ‘an egg-laying hen’ Focke (1855: 75): ‘eene eijerleggende hen, klokhen’
c. mamà foe gron mother of ground/plantation ‘the protecting spirit of a place or a plantation’ Focke (1855: 75): ‘beschermgodin, der plaats, der plantaadje, van het erf of der plek gronds’
The meaning of the morpheme mammá in the constructs in (28) is ‘huge’, and thus different from the meaning in the examples in (29). Note also that Schumann spells the two words differently: in the meaning ‘huge’ it is spelt with acute accent: mammá, whereas in the meaning ‘mother’ without: mamma. In Focke, however, both are spelt in the same way: mamà. Taken the high linguistic awareness of Schumann, we can assume that he possibly wanted to differentiate

240

the two meanings. Remarkably, however, both Schumann (1783: 106) and Focke (1855: 75) provide the two meanings under one dictionary entry. This points to an at least etymological relation between them.
The meaning ‘huge’ is usually associated with augmentative markers. Unfortunately, the data are so few that we cannot say with certainty in how far mammá was employed as an augmentative marker in Early Sranan. Wullschlägel’s (1856: 113) remark can be useful in this respect: “um etwas sehr großes auszudrücken, wird das Wort mamà (Mutter) vorgesetzt.’ (to express something very big, the word mamà (mother) is preposed). However, Wullschlägel provides only two examples: mamà-stoon (mother-stone) ‘huge stone’ and mamà-boom (mother-tree) ‘huge tree’, which are the same as the examples in Schumann. In general, the semantic consistency with which mammá combines with nouns and also its non-occurrence in this meaning independently speaks in favour of the augmentative marker interpretation. Therefore, the following constructional idiom can be stated for Early Sranan:

(30) [[mammá][X]N]N

‘huge X’

Remarkably, Saramaccan also makes use of the morpheme mammâ in the augmentative function, as in mammâtchuba (AM-rain) ‘extremely heavy rain’, or mammâpau (AM-tree) ‘huge tree’. The Saramaccan examples are based on words of Portuguese-origin: tchuba ‘rain’ and pau ‘tree’ which indicates that mammâ might have been used in Saramaccan to create new words which have no parallels in Sranan. This confirms its status as an augmentative marker. Since Saramaccan split from Sranan around 1690, we can hypothesise that mammá might have functioned as an augmentative marker relatively early in Sranan.
The origin of this marker is unclear. English does not have any comparable unit. Portuguese makes use of augmentative affixes (Gärtner 1998: 165-166), but none of them bears a relation to the noun ‘mother’. The substratum sources for Fongbe, Ewe or Twi contain no indication of the use of the notion ‘mother’ in the meaning ‘huge’ or some other type of augmentative markers. It is also unclear whether any such markers are used in Kikongo. According to Laman (1912: 50), there is a certain group of nouns in this language which are used to indicate that an object (person, house, animal) is “very large, huge, or inspiring fear”, such as
241

kiemba, kiengele, kiongolo, bobolo, bodongo, bwengo meaning ‘large/gigantic’. I did not find any clue whether at least one of the markers enumerated in Laman (1912) is related to something denoting ‘mother’ or any human being. Laman (1912: 50) also mentions that other Bantu languages make use of augmentative prefixes.14 Comrie and Thompson (1985: 396) show that Si-Luyana, a Bantu language, for instance, has the augmentative prefix si-, as in si-ana ‘big/ungainly/naughty child’ (< mw-ana ‘child’) or si-tondo ‘big/ugly/useless tree’ (< mu-tondo ‘tree’). All in all, it is difficult to make any reliable judgements in respect to the origin of the augmentative marker in Early Sranan.
7.2.6. Constructs with the abstract nominaliser -sanni
There are quite a number of combinations with the morpheme -sanni/zanti in Early Sranan that deserve special attention. Sanni has been derived from the English indefinite pronoun something (Smith 1987: 225) and, as Bruyn (1995a: 153-154) suggests, acquired the status of a content word, namely, a noun in Early Sranan, a development which is rare in a language. The range of functions of the lexeme sanni in Early Sranan is rather wide since it can function as a noun, ‘thing’, an interrogative pronoun, ‘what’, a relative pronoun, ‘what’, and a personal pronoun, ‘it’, as it is shown in (31):
(31) a. noun: gi mi da blakkasanni give me DEF black-thing ‘Give me the black thing.’ (Schumann 1783: 149): ‘Gib mir das schwarze Ding.’
b. joe hakkesi zoo lauw zanti 2SG ask such silly thing Arends (1995b: 171): ‘Don’t ask such a silly question.’ Van Dyk (c1765: 53): ‘Vraag je zoo een Gekken Zaak.’
14 Laman (1912: 50) refers to such prefixes as ‘amplificative prefixes’.
242

c. interrogative pronoun: san’ datti what that ‘What is that?’ Focke (1855: 113): ‘Wat is dat?’
d. relative pronoun: mi gi ju sanni mi habbi 1SG give 2SG what 1SG have ‘I give you what I have.’ (Schumann 1783: 149): ‘Ich gebe dir was ich habe.’
e. personal pronoun: pulu sanni take-away it ‘Take it away!’ Schumann (1783: 149): ‘Nimm es weg.’

Besides, in Schumann primarily, sanni also occurs in combination with a wide variety of items, such as pronouns, numerals, adjectives, verbs, nouns, quantifiers, as in (32):

(32) a. hemsanni

‘he/she/it-thing’ ‘his/hers/its’

Sch

jusanni

‘you-thing’

‘yours’

Sch

b. drisanni

‘three-thing’ ‘three things’

Sch

tusanni

‘two-thing’

‘two things’

Sch

c. biggisanni

‘big-thing’

‘something big/a big thing’ Sch

lauw zanti

‘silly-thing’

‘something silly’

VD

d. brokkosanni

‘to break-thing’ ‘something broken’

Sch

fufursanni

‘to steal-thing’ ‘something stolen’

Sch

e. Gadosanni

‘god-thing’

‘divine things’

Sch

pikkadosanni

‘sin-thing’

‘something sinful’

Sch

f. mennisanni
sosanni

‘many-thing’ ‘various things’

Sch

‘such-thing’ ‘something like that’

Sch

g. alla sorte sanni

‘all-sort-thing’ ‘things of all kinds’

Sch

brokko-broko sanni ‘broken-thing’ ‘something broken’

Sch

Most combinations in (32) are written together or hyphenated, which raises the question of whether sanni carries a specific function in them. Bruyn (1995a: 154) calls sanni a ‘nominalising proform’ in such examples and notes that it is

243

specified for the feature [–human]. I will argue that constructs in (32) are not complex words since they do not name a specific concept and thus do not bear the referential function typical of word-formation.
There are, however, constructs with -sanni that serve the referential function, as in (33):

(33) a. dattrasanni

‘doctor-thing’

‘medicine’

Sch

didrübrisanni

‘devil-thing’

‘devil’s tricks’

Sch

Sch

pikíen-níngre-sanì ‘young creoles-thing’ ‘childishness’

Fo

prefurusanni

‘to play fool-thing’ ‘prank/tomfoolery’

Sch

sóso sanì

‘insignificant-thing’ ‘trifle/insignificance’

Fo

The constructs in (33a) render the meaning ‘thing used for BASE’ or ‘thing used by BASE’. In these meanings, sanni is not used serially with semantic consistency. Therefore, such constructs do not form a specific pattern and are similar to N-N constructs which will be regarded in one of the following sections. In contrast, examples in (33b) form a specific pattern: -sanni functions as an abstract nominaliser in them and creates abstract nouns from items belonging to different lexical categories, such as nouns, as in níngre-sannì ‘childishness’, or verbs as in prefurusanni ‘prank/tomfoolery’, or multifunctional A-V items, such as lau in lausanni ‘folly/stupidity’, which can be both an adjective, ‘stupid’ and a verb, ‘to be stupid.’ Therefore, the following constructional idiom can be postulated for Early Sranan:

(34) [[X]V/A[sanni]]N ‘state of (being) X’

Sanni-formations are not numerous in Early Sranan. Abstract notions are more commonly rendered by nouns in multifunctional sets, such as pródo, which can be an adjective, ‘proud’, a verb, ‘to be proud’ and a noun, ‘proudness’, or grídi which
244

is an adjective, ‘greedy’ and a noun, ‘greed’, pre which occurs as the verb ‘to play/to be pleased or glad’ and the noun ‘pleasure’. According to the continuum of structural complexity established above, creating a new item without any overt marking is a structurally simpler option than combining two bases (cf. Clark 1993). In terms of semantic transparency, however, combining two roots is a more transparent process than multifunctionality. The fact that -sanni came to be used an abstract nominaliser in Early Sranan is the result of substratum influence. Remarkably, the noun ‘thing’ surfaces in a number of forms in several substratum languages of Early Sranan. For instance, in Ewe, it is used to express abstract notions in the same way as in Early Sranan, as the examples in (35) show. Fon also has some constructs of such a type. The data for Ewe are from Schlegel (1856) and Westermann (1905; 1906), the Fon data are from Rassinoux (1987):

(35) nǔ agç$

‘thing-be crooked’

‘injustice’

Fon

nu-flo

‘thing-right’

‘rightness’

Ewe

nú-nyà

‘thing-to know’

‘wisdom’

Ewe

nũ* se-nu

‘power/strength-thing’

‘violence’

Ewe

nu-võ@

‘thing-evil’

‘sin’

Ewe

nyo-nyõ@

‘thing-be beautiful’

‘beauty’

Ewe

Besides, Christaller (1875: 27) mentions that in Twi the noun asem ‘word/thing/matter’ is used to derive abstract notions. The examples he provides include ahen-sém (king-thing) ‘king’s doings’ and atete-sém ‘old time-thing’ ‘story of ancient times’. In contrast to Early Sranan examples in (33b), the Twi examples Christaller gives do not denote abstract notions so that it is difficult to assess a possibility of substratum influence from Twi. I also found no evidence of such use of the noun denoting ‘thing’ in Kikongo.
It can be concluded so far that first, Early Sranan sanni-constructs bear a strong semantic similarity to constructs with the noun ‘thing’ from the substratum languages Ewe and Fon. Besides, at least two of the Early Sranan sanni-words have one-to-one semantic correspondences in Ewe and Fon: krukuttusanni (thing(be) crooked) is equivalent to the Fon nǔ agç$ (thing-be crooked) both meaning ‘injustice’ and moisanni (thing-(be) beautiful) is similar to the Ewe nyo-nyõ@ (thing-be beautiful) both meaning ‘beauty’. As in many items discussed in the present chapter, the creole language differs from its substratum in the order of

245

elements: the item ‘thing’ usually precedes the base in the Ewe examples in (35). Only in one example it follows the base, as in Early Sranan.
In view of the evidence that Ewe and Fon have words created according to the same semantic principle, we can hypothesise that the emergence of Sranan sanni-constructs was influenced by the substratum. Some of the sanni-constructs in (33b) are calques of substratum words, others, for which no equivalents are attested, are most likely modelled on corresponding substratum items.

7.2.7. Constructs with the abstract nominaliser -fasi

Similarly to the case of the morpheme -sanni above, there are two types of constructs with the morpheme -fasi/fássi/fassi/fási15 (< Engl. fashion (Smith 1987: 244) attested in Schumann (1783) which are interesting in respect to their semantics and the function of the morpheme -fasi in them. They are listed in (36):

15 The spelling variant of this morpheme used hereafter is fasi and is based on Schumann (1783: 40). The variants from Van Dyk (c1765) are fasi and fassi, from Focke (1855) fasi/fássi/fassi/fási.
246

Fasi is attested as a noun in Early Sranan that, according to Schumann (1783: 40), has the following meanings: ‘kind/manner/fashion/way/form/nature’, as is shown in (37):

(37) a. sofa

mi no libi na fotto, mi no sabi fasi va une

so-manner 1SG NEG live on fort 1SG NEG know manner of 2PL

‘Since I an not living in Paramaribo, I do not know their habits.’

Schumann (1783: 159): ‘Weil ich nicht hier an Paramaribo wohne, so

weiss ich eure Einrichtungen u. Gewohnheiten nicht.’

b. mi si na alla fasi va ju, ju go na kerki

1SG see on all manner of 2SG 2SG go to church

‘I see on all your manner (outlook) that you are going to church.’

Schumann (1783: 119): ‘Ich sehe an deinem ganzen Betragen, dass du

in die Kirche gehst.’

There are two differences between the examples in (36a) and those in (36b). The first difference lies in their semantics. The examples in (36a) can be paraphrased as ‘X manner’, e.g. kíbri-fasi could be paraphrased as ‘secret manner’, djalusufasi as ‘jealous manner’, tarrafa(s)si as ‘different manner’, etc. Note that they are often translated by Schumann (1783) and Focke (1855) with the words Weise and wijze respectively which both mean ‘manner’ or by means of adverbs. For instance, retifasi is translated as ‘gut’ (well) by Schumann (1783: 190), kómpefási is translated by Focke (1855: 62) as ‘familiaar, op eene vriendschappelijke wijze’ (familiarly, in a friendly manner). In contrast, the meaning of the constructs in (36b) is ‘state of (being) X’. For instance, santafasi can be paraphrased as ‘state of being holly’, porifasi as ‘state of being spoilt’, etc. Remarkably, all examples from (36b) are consistently translated by Schumann (1783) into German by means of abstract nouns, as I have shown in (36b). Thus, the meaning ‘manner’ in clearly traceable in the examples in (36a), and much less so in those in (36b).
The second difference lies in the fact, that in Schumann (1783) and Wullschlägel (1856) examples in (36a) are often attested with the preposition na, as is demonstrated in (38). Two of the fasi-examples from Schumann, however, occur without na: retifasi and tarrafasi, as in (38c) and (38d). Note that numerically cases where fasi-examples from (36a) are attested with the
247

preposition na ‘in’ dominate: out of 9 fasi-examples from Schumann for which context is provided, only two, retifasi and tarrafasi, occur without this preposition.

(38) a. b. c. d.

a lukku mi na djalusu-fasi

3SG look 1SG on (be)-jealous manner

‘He looks at me in a jealous manner.’

Schumann (1783: 30): no translation provided

a takki datti na odofasi

3SG talk this on mystery/puzzle-manner

‘He says this in a mysterious manner.’

Schumann (1783: 126): no translation provided

dem tu uman holi

meti

retifasi

DEF/PL two woman hold/stand second wife right-manner

‘The two wives of the same husband live well with each other.’

Schumann (1783: 111): ‘Die 2 Weiber des einen Mannes vertragen

sich gut mit einander.’

ju no kann meki datti tarrafasi?

2SG NEG can make that different-manner

‘Can’t you do it differently?’

Schumann (1783: 175): ‘Kanst du dieses nicht anders machen?’

Interestingly, tarrafasi consistently occurs without the preposition na in Schumann’s dictionary. Besides, he provides this item under a separate entry in his dictionary. This is possibly the result of the frequent occurrence of this item.
Unfortunately, Focke (1855) does not provide a broader context for the examples in (36a) so that it is unclear whether they are used with or without the preposition na ‘in/on’ in this source. Interestingly, however, the majority of the examples with the morpheme fasi in Focke occur with the indefinite determiner wan ‘a’, and they are mainly translated by Focke by means of the Dutch preposition op which has, among other meanings, the following ones: ‘in/upon/by’. Consider the following examples:

248

(39) a. b.

wan kóni fási

INDEF clever manner

‘in a skillful manner’

Focke (1855: 62): ‘op eene behendige wijze’

wan dângra

fási

INDEF disordered/confused manner

‘in a disordered/confused/ manner’

Focke (1855: 20): ‘op eene verwarde wijze’

As far as the examples in (36b) are concerned, it is difficult to say whether they are used with the preposition na ‘in’, since only for one of them, pori fasi, a broader context is provided, as in (40):

(40) da pori fasi va wi DEF spoil(ed) manner of 3PL ‘the depravity of ours’ Schumann (1783: 140): ‘unsere Verdorbenheit’

To sum up, we can say that the adverbial translations, the use of the preposition na ‘in’ and the determiner wan points to the fact that the examples in (36a) do not function as single referential units. In contrast, those in (36b) seem so: in them the element -fasi serves a specific function of generating abstract nouns with the meaning ‘state of being X’ from verbs and adjectives denoting abstract notions. Therefore, -fasi can be regarded as an abstract nominaliser in (36b), and the following constructional idiom can be singled out for Early Sranan:

(41) [[X]V/A[fasi]]N

‘state of (being) X’

However, there are several aspects that make fasi-constructs different from those built according to all the other idioms discussed above.
First, there are only five items created according to the constructional idiom in (41) in the data. Interestingly, however, such fasi-items are rather numerous in Wullschlägel (1856), as the examples in (42) show:

249

(42) bedaari-fasi
getroùw-fasi
kibri-fasi
kori-fasi
mandi fasi
mooi-fasi prodo-fasi reti-fasi stoutoe-fasi switi-fasi

‘calmness’
‘faithfulness/devotedness’
‘secretness’
‘deceit’
‘ill-humour/displeasure’
‘beauty’ ‘proudness’ ‘uprightness/honesty’ ‘stubbornness’ ‘gracefulness/beauty’

bedaari (A/V)
getroùw (A)
kibri (V)
kori (V)
mandi (V)
moi (A/V) prodo (V) reti (A/V) stoutoe (A/V) switi (A)

‘calm’
‘faithful/devoted’
‘to keep/to hide’
‘to deceit’
‘to be ill-humoured’
‘beautiful’ ‘to be proud’ ‘right/to be right’ ‘to be stubborn’ ‘graceful’

Second, fasi-items built according to (41) are not attested in the earlier sources, such as Herlein (1718), Court Records (1667-1767, Van den Berg 2000), Van Dyk (c1765) and Nepveu (1770). Focke (1855: 18) contains only one example of this type which is also attested in Schumann: (so wan) broejà-fasi (disorderedmanner) which he, however, translates by using the preposition op ‘in/by’: ‘op zulk eene verwarde wijze’ (in such a disordered manner).
The third interesting aspect is that constructs involving the noun ‘manner’ in a way similar to (41) are not attested in the major substratum languages of Early Sranan.
The assumption that can be made on the basis of these observations is that possibly, the constructional idiom in (41) was introduced by the missionaries. Two arguments can be presented to support this assumption. First, fasi-constructs occur only in Schumann (1783) and Wullschlägel (1856), i.e. sources written by the missionaries, in contrast to all the other sources mentioned above, whose authors were not missionaries. Second, most fasi-examples from Schumann, presented in (36b), and many of those from Wullschlägel denote religious and moral notions, such as ‘holiness’, ‘depravity’, ‘worldliness’, ‘pride’ etc. Another interesting fact is that a very similar pattern to that in (41) exists in Tok Pisin which does not share any substratum language with Early Sranan. Mühlhäusler (1995b: 625, cited from McWhorter 1998: 797) notes that there is a suffix pasin, etymologically related to the English noun ‘fashion’, which produces abstract nouns: gutpasin (< gut ‘good’) ‘virtue’, isipasin (< isi ‘slow’) ‘slowness’, proutpasin (< prout ‘proud’) ‘pride’, paitfasin (< pait ‘fight’) ‘warfare’. This shows that the noun meaning ‘manner/fashion’ is possibly semantically a good candidate for functioning as an abstract nominaliser.
It can be suggested in conclusion that the function of -fasi as an abstract nominaliser is the result of an influence on the part of the missionaries. They

250

possibly were in the need of naming religious, moral notions when preaching or interacting with the black population. In this connection we might ask whether the constructional idiom in (41) should indeed be postulated for Early Sranan, taken the evidence, that the words created by its means are possibly ‘artificial’ in that they do not come from the creators of Early Sranan. However, it can equally be assumed that such words were adopted by the black population from the missionaries and used. Besides, the Early Sranan data used in the present study come from rather different sources which most likely represent different geographic, as well as social, varieties of Early Sranan, as I made it clear in chapter 4. Since no differentiation between different varieties can be done in this investigation because of the lack of the necessary information, it makes sense to include the pattern in (41) into the overall inventory of Early Sranan wordformation.
In general, the discussion above shows that beside the substratum or superstratum influence, certain patterns can emerge in the creole as the result of the innovation on the part of the users of this language. The fasi-pattern in (41) is interesting in that its creators were presumably white speakers.

7.2.8. N-N constructs
Complex words consisting of two nouns are rather common in all the three sources of Early Sranan. In (43) several examples have been chosen for the analysis:

(43) a.

anansi-hosso bakkera bassia boonki-tíki bótro-wátra físi-marki fóetoe-tapoe zoute bali kandele tikki muffe neti sorro watra watere moffe

In terms of structural complexity, N-N constructs in Early Sranan may consist of two simplex nouns, as in (43a), or of a complex and a simplex noun, as (43b), or of two complex nouns, as in (43c). Complex nouns used as constituents in (43b) and (43c) exhibit a wide variety of constituent structure: N-N, as Ningrekondre in Ningrekondre-fattu, A-N, as njoen-kâroe in njoen-kâroe tontomm, RED-V, as njanjámm in njanjámm-báksi, etc. This wide variety of structural types in (43) shows that in respect to the structure of N-N constructs, Early Sranan displays an inventory which is neither simple nor reduced.
A comparison between the structural complexity of N-N constructs in the three sources might be interesting here. In Van Dyk, N-N constructs with a complex member are very marginal: only 4 examples out of all N-N words are combinations of a complex and a simplex noun. In Schumann and Focke the number of such constructs is much greater. In respect to the structural complexity Early Sranan does not differ from its input languages, such as English, Ewe, Fongbe, and Twi which all have N-N compounds containing complex elements, as it is shown in (44) (examples from Christaller 1875: 29; Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 227; Marchand 1969: 80; Schlegel 1856: 176; Westermann 1907: 123):

A comparison of (43) and (44) shows that both Sranan and some substratum languages, such as Ewe, have multi-member N-N compounds, where the second noun is a reduplicated verb: cf. Bakkrakondre-jamjam, where the second element is the reduplicated verb ‘to eat’, and the Ewe afé-tsò-tso, where the second element is the reduplicated verb ‘to found’.
Besides, if we compare the frequency of occurrence of multimember compounds, in both Early Sranan and English, the combinations of two simplex nouns dominate. Thus, e.g. Koziol (1972: 52) mentions that although compounds consisting of more than two bases often occur in written language and professional registers, they are rare in spoken language. In Fongbe, N-N forms are much more frequent than, e.g. N-N-N forms (Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 227).
Syntactically, N-N concatenations function as X°, none of them has been attested separated by another lexical item. They are also syntactically endocentric: they bear the category of the syntactic head.
The overwhelming majority of N-N constructs in Early Sranan are rightheaded, with the modifier-head structure. There are, however, a few examples of semantically left-headed units, such as watere moffe (water-mouth) ‘saliva’, flamm faija (flame-fire) ‘fireflame’, fotto-kriolo (fort-creole) ‘local fort’ or watrahai (water-eye) ‘tears’. Some N-N complex words have ‘shifting heads’: they are attested both with the head on the right and on the left, such as horrowatra ~ watrahorro17 ‘well/spring/spring-water’ or janjam-sakka ~ sakka janjam ‘stomach’. In some substratum languages of Early Sranan, such as Ewe and Fongbe, N-N compounds are predominantly right-headed (Schlegel 1856: 37; Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 226-227). However, Twi has several N-N

17 In respect to these two compounds, Schumann (1783: 67) remarks that although both can be used, the Black people prefer horrowatra.
253

compounds consisting of a noun and an appositive noun where the head is on the left, as e.g. nk* wan-tá (road-double) ‘a crossway’ (Christaller 1875: 25). So, we can assume, although with caution, that substratum influence might have played a role in such cases.
Almost all N-N constructs from the three sources are semantically endocentric forms where the first component has a modifying function in respect to the second, head component. The whole unit is a hyponym of the head noun: e.g. físi-marki (fish-market) ‘fish market’ is the hyponym of marki ‘market’, Ningrekondre-fattu (Guinea/Africa-oil/fat) ‘genuine palm oil’ is the hyponym of fattu ‘oil’, etc.
Exocentric constructs are rather few. In Van Dyk, for instance, none of the N-N concatenations is exocentric. Schumann contains a limited number of them as well. Although Focke has the greatest number of exocentric items in comparison to the other two sources, they are rather rare: out of 442 N-N constructs attested in this source, only 27 are exocentric units. Most of such constructs are names of plants, as in (45a), and a few are names of animals, as in (45b), and two or three miscellaneous formations, such as, e.g. names of stars, diseases etc, as in (45c). The rich flora and fauna of Suriname thus offered one of the major fields for metaphoric creations.

Exocentric N-N constructs are also not numerous in the input languages of Early Sranan. English exocentric compounds of the N-N type, such as hatchback and skinhead are very few (Bauer 1983: 203-204). Besides, they refer to persons, and

254

not to plants and animals, as it is predominantly the case in Early Sranan. Fongbe has very few exocentric N-N compounds as well (Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 229).
Beside a few exocentric N-N compounds, all the three sources contain almost no copulative N-N constructs. One unit from Van Dyk: bakkera bassia (White-person overseer) ‘white overseer’ can be regarded as copulative: it can be paraphrased as ‘a person who is both an overseer and a white person’. In English, copulative compounds are attested from Old English times on, e.g. werwolf ‘werwolf, someone who is a wolf and a human being’, merchant-adventurer, giant-dwarf, etc. (Koziol 1972: 52-53). However, such forms are not as numerous as, for instance, endocentric compounds are. Copulative items do not occur among the examples of Fongbe compounds cited in Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 221234). The overviews of compounds in Twi and Ewe provided in Christaller (1875: 25-30) and in Westermann (1907: 118-123) contain several examples that can be regarded as copulative in nature, e.g. the Twi onua-barímá (sibling-man) ‘brother’ (Christaller 1875: 32) or the Ewe awu-tewui (dress-petticoat) ‘petticoat’, nçvı-@ nyçnù (sibling-woman) ‘sister’ (Westermann 1907: 121; 1943: 21). It seems therefore that copulative N-N constructs were rare in both Early Sranan and its source languages.
Many N-N constructs in Early Sranan are transparent in the sense that it is possible to infer their meaning from the meaning of the constituent parts (Ronneberger-Sibold 2001: 98), as e.g. aránja-bomm (orange-tree) ‘orange tree’, brede-bákki (bread-box) ‘bread-bin’, banna-buba (banana-skin) ‘banana skin’. There are also quite a number of N-N compounds in Early Sranan that are created on a metaphorical basis, as is shown in (46):

Examples in (46a) have only the metaphoric meaning. The examples in (46b) have two meanings, a literal and a metaphoric one. Such examples are attested in Focke only. They indicate that metaphoric extension was operative on already existing complex words in Early Sranan as a strategy to enrich the lexicon. In this respect Early Sranan again does not differ from ‘older’ languages.
Remarkably, Van Dyk contains very few metaphoric N-N constructs whereas Schumann and Focke have quite a number of them. The explanation for this might lie in the fact that Van Dyk (c1765) contains primarily reported spoken speech. In contrast, Schumann (1783) and Focke (1855) are dictionaries containing many more lexical entries, with a higher probability of finding metaphorical items. Besides, both Schumann (1783) and Focke (1855) contain a large number of words denoting objects of flora and fauna of Suriname, among which the percentage of metaphorical formations is much higher than in other areas of the lexicon.
There is a wide range of meaning relations between components of N-N concatenations, and I will illustrate only some of them in (47), where N1 and N2 refer to the first and to the second noun respectively:

Though (47) presents only a part of attested semantic patterns, it suggests that Early Sranan’s inventory of semantic relations between components in N-N compounds is not of a limited or reduced nature. In fact, it is comparable both in size and types with similar overviews done for ‘older languages’, such as English (Koziol 1972: 52-58), German (Fleisher and Barz 1995: 98-99 ), or Chinese (Packard 2000: 85-89).
Two further observations can be made on the basis of (47). First, semantic extension plays a important role in the naming of new concepts in Early Sranan. In many complex words in (47), especially second components have undergone semantic extension. The lexeme grón, beside the common meaning ‘ground/earth’ has the meaning ‘plantation’ in some complex words, e.g. santi-grón (sandground) ‘plantation with sandy soil’. The noun hosse ‘house’ may have the

257

meaning ‘nest’ in N-N compounds, as e.g. in wassiwassi-hosso (wasp-house) ‘wasp-nest’. The noun wirriwirri ‘leaves/hair’ is commonly used in N-N compounds in the meaning ‘hair of the animals’ or ‘herb’, e.g. vool-wirriwirri (hen-hair) ‘feather’, sisíbi-wiwíri (broom-herb) ‘name of a herb (Scoparia dulcis)’. Semantic extension is a common means of lexical expansion in the languages of the world, both creole and non-creole (Hancock 1980; Holm 1988: 101). Meaning extension is also common among nouns denoting objects in Fongbe (Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 225). As the data above show, Sranan does not make an exception in this respect. However, the question that arises is whether the semantic extension attested in Early Sranan took place in the creole itself or whether at least in some cases it is the result of transfer from the substratum languages. Although the exact extent of substratum influence cannot be established within the present study, a very superficial look at the substratum data shows that indeed what looks as semantic extension in Early Sranan is actually the result of transfer of a certain item from a substratum language. For instance, the Early Sranan noun watra ‘water’ has the following meanings: ‘water/juice/dampness/liquid’. Ewe has the word tsi that has almost the same range of meanings: ‘water/juice/liquid’ (Westermann 1906: 68; 147; 210).
Another observation due here is that one and the same lexeme is often used in quite a number of N-N constructs denoting a certain class of objects, such as instruments, habitation places, containers, etc. The word tiki ‘stick’ is often used in names of instruments especially of long and thin form, as it is shown in (48a). The lexeme bali ‘barrel’ is employed in words referring to containers of different kinds, as in (48b). Watra ‘water’ refers to different fluids, such as ‘water’, ‘milk’, ‘juice’, as in (48c), and the lexeme hosso ‘house’ is used to denote locations, buildings, habitation places of human beings and animals, and institutions, as in (48d):

Examples in (48) show that the creators of Early Sranan did not acquire English words denoting such specific concepts as ‘churn’, ‘cask’, ‘shed’, ‘nest’, ‘juice’. The explanation for this fact can lie in the socio-demographic situation of creolisation in Suriname, such as the short period of the English presence and the continuous arrivals of new slaves from Africa, discussed in chapter 3. An additional reason can be that such words might have much lower frequency of occurrence in the input than the words house, water, barrel and stick. Finally, substratum influence cannot be excluded here as well. Thus, e.g. in Fongbe, the lexeme tın@ ‘tree/wood/stick’ is used in a number of compounds referring to long, thin objects, as it is shown in (49) (taken from Lefebvre 1998: 338):

(49) wem› a¤-tı@n
wE›n-gan¤ -tı@n wo$-tın@

‘paper-stick’ ‘sending-metal-stick’ ‘dough-stick’

‘pencil’ ‘antenna’ ‘spatula’

Another related phenomenon is the use of basic concepts to create units referring to more complex ones. Thus, a more complex concept of ‘mother-in-law’ is expressed by means of combining the two basic ones, such as homan ‘woman18’

18 Although the word homan is not attested in the meaning ‘wife’ in Van Dyk, I would suggest that this word might have had this meaning in Van Dyk’s time. My suggestion is based on Schumann’s
259

and ‘mother’, or the more complex ‘pork’ is created by concatenation of the more basic concepts hago ‘pig’ and metti ‘meat’, and the more complex ‘hospital’ by combining the more basic ziki man ‘sick person/patient’ and hosse ‘house’. Again, the reasons for this phenomenon can be the same as mentioned above. I think, substratum influence must have played a role here, because an overview of compounding provided in Schlegel (1856), Westermann (1907) for Ewe and in Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002) for Fongbe, allows a conclusion that in a number of N-N combinations more complex concepts are rendered through concatenation of nouns denoting more simplex concepts, as the examples in (50) show (examples for Ewe are taken from Schlegel (1856: 39; 297); examples for Fongbe from Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 233):

Turning back to the consideration of semantic properties of Early Sranan N-N constructs, we can further mention that most of them denote objects, persons, animals and plants. (51) presents a more differentiated overview of semantic fields Early Sranan N-N combinations belong to.

(1873: 200) remark that the word weifi has the meaning ‘wife (of a man)’, but is Bakkratongo, and that Black speakers prefer uman rather than weifi even in the meaning ‘wife’. Focke (1855: 46; 149) contains the noun hóeman which means both ‘woman’ and ‘wife’ and wéfi meaning (among others) ‘wife’.

The overview in (51) shows that the lexicon of even such a relatively young language like Early Sranan comprises words belonging to a rather wide range of semantic fields. In this respect it does not differ from ‘older languages’, such as English, Russian, German, Chinese or Fongbe (for the latter, see Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 232-233).
It is noteworthy that the three sources differ in the range of semantic fields N-N constructs belong to. In Van Dyk, predominantly concrete nouns are involved in N-N constructs and the resultant complex nouns denote primarily concrete, physical objects. No names of plants, animals and diseases, so abundant in Schumann (1783) and especially Focke (1855) are attested among N-N concatenations in Van Dyk (c1765). This can be explained by the fact that Van Dyk (c1765) is, first, a source containing a smaller number of types than Schumann (1783) and Focke (1855) and second, it is not a dictionary. Since it

261

contains large portions of reported speech: dialogues and a play, the probability to account specific terms for fauna and flora in this source is low.
Concerning the origin of N-N constructs in Early Sranan, several remarks are due here. A few of them bear strong similarity to corresponding English compounds, e.g. areen-bo ‘rainbow’, arén-watra ‘rainwater’, fissinetti ‘fishnet’, firi-worko (field-work) ‘field-work’ or kandele tikki ‘candle stick’. There are also a few compounds that bear similarity to Dutch constructs, such as Dutch brievenpagaal and Early Sranan brífi-pagála ‘brief-basket’ or the Dutch koffijloots and the Early Sranan koffì-lósoe ‘coffee-shoot’, or koffijwaag and the Early Sranan koffi-wâgi ‘coffee-balance’. In general, however, N-N constructs having English or Dutch one-to-one equivalents are few. In contrast, the parallels to substratum N-N constructs are more numerous, as it is shown in (52) below. The data for Ewe are taken from Schlegel (1856), and Westermann (1906; 1907; 1961), the data for Fongbe from Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002) and Roussinoux (1987) and the data for Twi from Christaller (1875).

Although the list in (52) shows that a number of N-N constructs are calques from the native languages of creole creators, it is difficult to define the exact number of such transferred items, and thus to define the exact extent of substratum influence in this case. In this respect it is interesting to mention Lefebvre’s claim (1998: 335) that the Haitian simplex words are “concatenated on the model of the substratum languages’ and that the creators of Haitian used the principles of their native grammars in compounding simplexes. Indeed, Haitian and Fongbe exhibit a number of striking similarities. For instance, many Haitian names of body-parts, of trees, as well as Haitian constructs containing the word for ‘head’ have one-toone complex equivalents in Fongbe, as is illustrated in (53):

262

(53) Haitian
plim-je po-bouch pye-palmis

‘hair-eye’ ‘skin-mouth’ ‘tree-palm’

‘eye-hair’ ‘mouth-skin’ ‘palm-tree’

French cil lèvre palmier

‘eyelash’ ‘lip’ ‘palm tree’

Two remarks should be made here. First, it is no denying the fact that a number of creole N-N constructs are modeled on the substratum. However, it does not mean that the creole creators made use of concatenation principles of their native languages only. In the case of Early Sranan it is in fact difficult to say with certainty whether a particular item has been taken from the substratum or whether it is Sranan’s own creation. Second, the question arises whether the creole creators transferred separate words and then concatenated them using the models of their native languages or whether they transferred whole complex words from their native languages. In view of several one-to-one correspondences between the Early Sranan N-N constructs and those from the substratum, I will argue for the latter.

7.2.9. A-N constructs

Another numerically significant group of Early Sranan complex words are concatenations of an adjective and a noun:

(54) a. gran mastra ‘great-master’

‘owner’

krukkutu tatta ‘crooked/wrong-father’ ‘stepfather’

‘virgin who has not had a man Sch yet’

d. soso-takkitakki ‘useless-talk’

‘prattle’

Sch

First it is necessary to remark on the status of the A-N constructs that will be regarded in the present section. The problem with such combinations is that their status in English, for instance, is controversial between compounds and phrases since they exhibit a number of properties typical of phrasal units, such as rightward stress, ability to be substituted by a similar constituent, or to undergo

263

coordination (Adams 2001: 81). On this basis, it is assumed that combinations such as happy hour, hothouse, tight rope etc. are lexicalised phrases rather than compounds (Adams 2001: 81). A-N constructs that will be the focus of analysis in the present chapter are complex words, and not phrases because they function as syntactic atoms in a sentence, and they have a specific meaning that is destroyed when some other element is inserted between the members of A-N construct. They are single referential units.
Structurally, the overwhelming majority of Early Sranan A-N units consist of free, simplex bases, an adjectival and a nominal one. A similar situation can be found in English where the majority of constructs consisting of an adjective and a noun involve simplex elements (Koziol 1972: 62). Very few of the attested A-N concatenations in Early Sranan are composed of complex forms, either a simple adjective and a complex noun, as in (54b) or a complex adjective and a simplex noun, as in (54c) or a complex adjective and a complex noun, as in (54d). Most of the complex adjectives or nouns in A-N constructs are reduplications of verbs or adjectives. In this respect Early Sranan parallels some of its substratum languages, such as Ewe and Fongbe, where A-N constructs can contain an adjective which is a reduplicated verb, as in (55) (examples for Fongbe from Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 229); for Ewe from Schlegel (1856: 43)):

(55) am$ ı$ -kpı$kpE$n

‘motor-oil’

Fon

nu@-tıt@ E@

‘thing-swollen’

‘abscess’

Fon

bubu-me

‘lost-person’

‘lost person’

Ewe

All Early Sranan examples in (54) are syntactically atomic, as I have already mentioned above. Their second nouns function as syntactic heads: they determine the category of the whole unit: [A-N]N. All Early Sranan A-N concatenations exhibit the modifier-head order: in the units from (54) above, such as gran mastra, spaansze bok, swíti-sópi etc. the adjectives gran, spaansze, swíti have the modifying function and determine the scope of reference of the head noun. This order is exactly the same as the order of syntactic modifier-head structures of the A-N type, as it is shown in (56), which is the same as in English and the opposite to that of Fongbe, where such constructs are left-headed (Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 228-229):

264

Semantically, Early Sranan A-N constructs can be both endocentric and exocentric. Endocentric units denote different semantic concepts, such as objects, persons, animals, plants etc. Many of them are compositional formations, where the meaning of both elements allows us to discern the meaning of the whole compound, as in (57a). Others are semi-compositional constructions: they are hyponyms of the heads, but the meaning of the whole compound is not directly discernable from the meanings of separate components, as in (57b).

Exocentric A-N formations are more numerous than it was the case with N-N constructs. In contrast to exocentric N-N combinations, most exocentric A-N compounds denote abstract qualities, as it is shown in (58a), and only very few of them are names of animals, as in (58b), and (58c). Among 81 A-N constructs attested in Schumann, for instance, only three are exocentric forms referring to animals, and none to plants. In all the three sources, there are two exocentric A-N compounds that refer to human beings, as in (58d).

Early Sranan exocentric A-N forms thus considerably differ from such forms in English, where most compounds of this type refer to persons, e.g. bluebeard, redneck, longtongue, redneck. However, there are similarities to the substratum. The examples of exocentric N-A compounds from Fongbe presented in Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 230) contain many constructs that refer to abstract qualities or physical states, some of which are shown in (59):

(59) ah$ ç$n-sus@ u@
wu$-kuk@ u@ xo$mE$-hu$nhu$n

‘brain-closed’ ‘body-dead’ ‘belly-open’

‘baldness’ ‘paralysis’ ‘joy’

Another interesting feature of exocentric A-N compounds is that those denoting abstract qualities of persons (in (58a) above) involve only nouns denoting bodyparts, such as hai ‘eye’, hatti ‘heart’, heddi ‘head’, jési ‘ear(s)’, and mófo ‘mouth’.

19 In (58a) I have provided translations from both Focke and Schumann, since they often differ in one respect. In Schumann the examples in (58a) are identifiable as nouns since several sentences with them are given. Focke often either translates them as both nouns and adjectives, or as adjectives only. Since Focke contains very few example sentences with the words from (58a), it is unclear whether these words can indeed be used as adjectives, or whether the adjectival translations should be interpreted as references to persons possessing the characteristic expressed in a given A-N construct, e.g. whether bigi-hái can be used in the meaning ‘greedy person’.
266

This phenomenon is evidently different from what we have in English: all English equivalents of A-N constructs in (58a) are simplexes that have nothing to do with body parts. Such forms, however, have striking parallels in the substratum. Lefebvre (1998: 337) mentions that Fongbe has several compounds involving the noun for ‘head’. In his description of Ewe, Schlegel (1856: 31; 33-34) points out that Ewe makes use of the names of all organs and body parts, such as dši ‘heart’, nu ‘mouth’, mo ‘face’, tome ‘the inner of the ear’, dòme ‘the inner of the belly’ to express primarily abstract notions, especially spiritual states and feelings. In such cases, as Schlegel notes, the language uses physical, bodily notions to express spirituality. Similar items are attested in Twi as well (Christaller 1881: 241), as the following examples show:

(60) dši-dšo

‘heart-to be somewhere’

‘joy’

Ewe

‘heart-to dig’

Twi

tome-fáfá ‘inner ear-cool/fresh/soft’

Ewe

Schlegel (1856: 35) mentions that it is a specific feature of Ewe and other WestAfrican languages to build all abstract and spiritual notions on the basis of concrete ones, thus expressing the everyday physical perception of the world. The same tendency is traceable in the Early Sranan examples in (58a). Although the correspondences are not one-to-one, the parallels between the Ewe words in (60) and the Sranan examples in (58a) are evident: both use names for body parts to express abstract, spiritual states, and also structurally many are combinations of adjectives and nouns. It means that either the words in (58a) are transferred from one of the substratum languages, or they are Sranan’s own formations which have been influenced both structurally and semantically by similar constructs from the native languages of creole creators.
Semantic categories to which A-N combinations belong exhibit nearly the same range as N-N concatenations, as it is shown in (61). However, there are

267

quantitative differences between different classes. For instance, names of animals and plants are not so numerous among A-N constructs as among N-N constructs.

The groups just listed are again comparable with semantic groups of A-N compounds in ‘older’ languages like English or German (cf. e.g. Fleisher und Barz 1995: 106-108 for German).
In general, in the majority of cases, the semantic pattern behind Early Sranan A-N constructs can presented as follows:

(62) ‘N characterised by a quality A’

268

Adjectives used in A-N constructs express a number of different semantic categories, some of them are enumerated in (63):

Certain adjectives reoccur in many Early Sranan A-N formations, such as bígi ‘big’, blakka ‘black’, gran ‘big/great/important’, krukkutu ‘wrong/false/crooked’, njoen ‘new/young’, ougri ‘bad/evil’, redi ‘red’, switti ‘sweet’ and tranga ‘strong’. For instance, in Focke, there are four combinations involving bígi ‘big’, ten constructs with gran ‘great’, six compounds with króektoe ‘crooked/wrong’, six combinations involving redi ‘red’, and eleven with switti ‘sweet’. For illustration, A-N constructs containing switti are listed in (64):

(64) swíti bóonki
swíti kassába switi-mófo
switi patatta switi rósoe swíti-sópi swíti tíki swíti tóri switi-wátra switi-wien

‘sweet-bean’ ‘sweet-cassava’ ‘sweet-mouth/word’ ‘sweet-oil’ ‘sweet-potato ‘sweet-rose’ ‘sweet-dram’ ‘sweet-stick’ ‘sweet-story’ ‘sweet-water’ ‘sweet-wine’

‘sweet pulse’ ‘sweet cassava’ ‘hearty, salt dishes, such as meat, bacon etc.’ ‘train oil’ ‘Batatas edulis’ ‘European rose’ ‘liqueur’ ‘liquorice (Liquiritia)’ ‘pleasant talk’ ‘water with sugar or syrup’ ‘sweet wine’

The use of certain adjectives in quite a number of compounds serially, is, however, not an exclusive feature of Early Sranan. In German, as Fleisher and

269

Barz (1995: 107) note, certain adjectives, such as neu ‘new’, alt ‘old’, jung ‘young’, klein ‘small’, süß ‘sweet’, rot ‘red’, schwarz ‘black,’ fein ‘fine’, frei ‘free’ also belong to the most common ones in A-N constructs. The explanation might be that the semantics of these adjectives poses less restrictions on the types of nouns with which they can occur, whereas adjectives with more specific semantics like ungehorsam ‘disobedient’, antik ‘antique’ do not readily occur with every noun. Another reason for the frequent use of certain adjectives might lie in the fact that Early Sranan has a much smaller inventory of adjectives than, e.g. English or German, but one comparable to languages like Fongbe20 (Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 348-350). In Early Sranan some concepts expressed by one adjective in languages such as English are rendered by a combination of at least two concepts in a complex word. For instance, the English concept ‘cheeky’ is expressed by the combination tranga-mófo (strong-mouth/word), and the concept ‘disobedient’ by the construct tranga-jési (strong-ear).
What role did the input languages play in the formation of A-N constructs in Early Sranan? A-N constructs are available in all major source languages of Early Sranan, such as English21, Dutch, Fongbe, Ewe and Twi. Several of Early Sranan A-N constructs exhibit both formal and semantic similarity to English, such as njujari ‘New Year’, nju mune ‘new moon’, retti han ‘right hand’, blakke briddi ‘black bread’, riddi wini ‘red wine’. At least one form from Focke can be an adoption from the Dutch noun roodborstje: redi-bórsoe ‘redbreast’. But in general, as it was the case with N-N constructs, the parallels to the substratum languages are greater. I have already mentioned several parallels, such as the use of body parts to express abstract states and characteristics of persons. Besides, some Early Sranan A-N concatenations have close correspondences in the substratum (examples for Fongbe are taken from Lefebvre (1998: 336) and Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 229); for Ewe from Westermann (1906: 175)):
20 In Fongbe, however, there are very few adjectives, and concepts expressed by adjectives in other languages are rendered by stative verbs (Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 348). Early Sranan differs from Fongbe in the fact that most items expressing adjectival concepts are multifunctional: they fulfill functions of adjectives, verbs and often also of nouns, as it has been shown in chapter 6. 21 I have already mentioned above, that the status of English A-N combinations is controversial between compounds and phrases. This, however, is not crucial for the argument here since if English combinations such as blackboard or new moon served as a model for creole creators, the status made no difference for creole creators.

The Early Sranan and the substratum forms in (65) are similar both structurally and semantically. In contrast, all English equivalents of Early Sranan words are either simplexes or phrases that do not bear one-to-one correspondence to the creole forms. However, the Early Sranan and the substratum A-N constructs differ in the order of elements: whereas in Early Sranan the modifying adjective precedes the head noun, in the substratum languages, such as Ewe, Fongbe, and Twi the order is usually the reverse one. An explanation for this order advanced by Lefebvre (1998) can again be employed here: since creole creators acquired the order of the elements in the lexifier forms, the creole A-N forms will have the same order as English A-N phrases, which is exactly the case with Early Sranan A-N constructs. In general the parallels once again allow the conclusion that both transfer of words from the substratum languages, borrowing from the superstratum, and creation of innovations played a role in the emergence of A-N constructs in Early Sranan.

7.2.10. V-N constructs with the meaning ‘object for Ving’

There are a number of complex nouns in the Early Sranan data whose first components are attested primarily as verbs:

(66) brokke hosse
naitetei passà-brifi siengi-bóekoe slibi jakki

‘to break-house’
‘to sew-thread’ ‘to pass-letter/ticket’ ‘to sing-book’ ‘to sleep-jacket’

‘break house where coffee was broken VD

in order to get out the coffee beans’

‘sewing thread’

Sch

‘ticket/pass of a slave’

Fo

‘music-book/hymn-book’

Fo

‘night-gown’

VD

All constructs in (66) are inseparable X° units and consist of simplex elements. The interesting fact about them is that they do not have a verb-complement structure and are not left-headed, as one might expect in V-N combinations, taken

271

the fact that VPs are left-headed in Early Sranan. The final nouns in the examples in (66) function as heads thus making the examples right-headed nouns: slibi jakki (sleep-jacket) is not a verb, but a noun which is a hyponym of the second noun: ‘night-gown’, and the same is true about all the other examples in (66). Besides, the semantic interpretation of the examples in (66) yields the modifier-head order in which the first components restrict the reference scope of the second nouns: brokke hosse is ‘a house for breaking coffee’, naitetei is ‘a thread for sewing’ etc. Since many lexemes are multifunctional in Early Sranan, the question arises whether the first elements in (66) are indeed verbs.
Some of the first elements in (66), such as brokko ‘to break’, passa ‘to pass’, nai ‘to sew’ are attested in the sources as verbs only. Others are attested in more than one syntactic function, such as slibi ‘to sleep/sleep’, and sheki ‘to shake/shaking’ which occur as verbs and nouns. I have shown in chapter 6 that most verbs can occur as either nouns or adjectives, or as both. It means that potentially, the first elements in (66) can be nouns or adjectives as well. I will argue that in (66) the first elements can be regarded as nouns on two grounds. First, they denote an activity: in brokke hosse, brokke denotes the activity of breaking, slibi in slibi jakki denotes the activity of sleeping, nai in naitetei indicates the activity of sewing etc. Second, they occupy the prenominal, modifying position. Remarkably, the same problem arises with English and German V-N compounds, where it is difficult to decide whether the first elements are indeed verbs (Bauer 1983: 205; Fleisher and Barz 1995: 109; Koziol 1972: 66).
Semantically, all of such combinations attested in Early Sranan are endocentric: they are hyponyms of the head: siengi-bóekoe (sing-book) ‘music book’ is a kind of book, zére plessi (sell-place) ‘market’ is a kind of place, and so on.
Constructs in (66) denote different types of objects. No names of persons, plants, or animals are attested among them. In general, the semantic pattern they reflect can be expressed as ‘object for activity X’, where X is the first element. (67) presents a more detailed overview of the semantic categories V-N combinations belong to.
272

Fo

Examples in (67) reflect the tendency to create more complex concepts by employing more basic ones: the concept ‘market’, for instance, is rendered through more basic concepts ‘selling’ and ‘place’, the concept ‘stationary’ by combining the basic ‘writing’ and ‘thing’. Besides, units in (67) also show another tendency, already observed above: to use certain nouns serially to denote a particular semantic category. For instance, the nouns hosso ‘house’ and plessi ‘place’ are employed to denote institutions or locations, the noun páttoe ‘pot’ containers, and zanti ‘thing’ instruments and products. In general it means that the creole creators did not acquire corresponding English words for all these concepts, such as stationary, market, cemetery, pub, razor etc.
What might have influenced the emergence of such compounds in Early Sranan? English has endocentric V-N constructs which existed since old English times (Koziol 1972: 65-66): hwetstān ‘whetstone’ (OE), drawbridge (ME), grindstone (ME), shakefork (ME), sheargrass (1483), tread-wheel (1573). However, as the examples in (67) show, there are no one-to-one correspondences between Early Sranan V-N constructs and their English translations which are either simplexes or non-equivalent phrases. Besides, the Early Sranan V-N constructs in (67) are built according to one semantic pattern: ‘object for activity X’ whereas English V-N compounds exhibit a wider variety of patterns, as the examples enumerated above show: e.g. tread-wheel can be interpreted as ‘wheel that is tread’ rather than ‘wheel for treading’. In fact compounds that more commonly express the semantic pattern ‘object for activity X’ in English are Ving-N compounds, as e.g. dressing-board (ME), frying-pan (ME), landing place

273

(1512) etc. (Koziol 1972: 60). Early Sranan forms in (67), however, do not have any such marking as the English -ing. In general we can say that English did not serve as a model for the Early Sranan V-N constructs in (67).
Fongbe can hardly be a model either. According to Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 230), Fongbe has some exocentric N-V compounds, such as as$ íkpE@ (hand-beat) ‘applause’ or ta$-bla@ (head-tie) ‘bandana’, but they differ semantically from Early Sranan endocentric V-N compounds since they do not follow the ‘object for activity X’-pattern. There are, however, evident parallels to Ewe, which has endocentric V-N compounds (Schlegel 1856: 40), and Twi (Christaller 1875: 26), as it is shown in (68):

(68) dà-ti

‘shoot/throw-stick’

mlo-ẃe ‘go sleeping-place’

nyi-ẃe ‘graze-place’

‘a measure, a stick which they take and measure Twi

things’

‘a stone by which gold is tried’

Twi

‘burry-place’

Ewe

The substratum examples in (68) are similar to the Early Sranan V-N constructs not only in their structure, but also in the semantic pattern according to which they are built: ‘object used for activity X’. Remarkably, in both Ewe and Early Sranan the word denoting ‘place’ is often used in V-N constructs under regard. In general we can say then that substratum V-N constructs might have played a role in the emergence of Early Sranan V-N constructs.

7.2.11. V-N constructs meaning ‘object characterised by Ving’
Beside the constructs investigated above, there are also a number of other examples in the sources where the first elements are verbs. However, in contrast to the constructs regarded above, those in (69) are not built according to the semantic pattern ‘object for activity X’:

274

kapâdoe-hágoe ‘to cut/to castrate-pig’ ‘castrated pig/fattening pig’

Fo

As it was the case with the V-N constructs above, it is unclear whether the first elements in (69) are indeed verbs, because the examples in (69) do not have verbcomplement, but modifier-head structure and are right-headed. The question arises whether they belong to some other syntactic category. Some of their first elements, such as brokko ‘to break’, ron ‘to run’, kapâdoe ‘to cut/to castrate’ are attested in the sources as verbs only. Others are attested in more than one syntactic function, such as sheki ‘to shake/shaking’, which is attested as a verb and a noun, and tingi ‘to stink/bad smell/bad-smelling’, which can be a verb, a noun, and an adjective. Since most verbs in Early Sranan can occur as either nouns or adjectives, or as both, the question arises, what lexical category the first elements in (69) should belong to.
I will suggest that the first elements in (69) are adjectives. First, they have an adjective-typical prenominal, modifying position. Second, though they express an activity, they describe and qualify persons and objects expressed by the second components. For instance, ron negere (run-Black/slave) as ‘slaves characterised by having run away’, kapâdoe-hágoe (castrate-pig) as ‘pig that has been castrated’ etc. In this respect they resemble the category of participles in English, although, contrary to English, they do not bear any marking, such as the English -ed or -ing. Notably, constructs in (69a) can be paraphrased by using English present participles: zikke hede as ‘shaking head’, tingi oli as ‘stinking oil’, wákka-wákka sóro as ‘wandering sore’ etc. Formations in (69b) can be paraphrased with English past participles: ron negere as ‘run-away Blacks’, brokko-klossi as ‘broken clothes’, kapâdoe-hágoe as ‘castrated pig’.
Most V-N formations of this type are names of objects and persons. As I have already mentioned before, they are built according to a different semantic pattern than the V-N constructs regarded above: ‘person/object characterised by activity X, where X=first element’. A more differentiated overview of semantic categories is presented in (70):

275

(70) names of persons

huru uman

‘whore-woman’

‘prostitute/whore’

Sch

jajò-hóeman

‘wander-woman’

‘slut’

Fo

names of artefacts

brei-kousse

‘knit-stockings/socks’ ‘knitted stockings or socks’

Sch

slibi-bredi

‘sleep-bread’

‘bread that is baked the night before Sch and therefore no longer fresh’

names of plants

sidòn-pattáta

‘sit-potato’

‘kind of potatoes (Batatas edulis)’ Fo

tiengi gódo

‘stink-pumpkin’

‘name of a plant’

Fo

names of animals

jajò-kraboe

‘wander-crab’

‘a crab species’

Fo

krabbodago

‘scratch-dog’

‘savannah dog (a kind of fox)’

Sch

names of diseases

krabbojassi

‘scratch-rash’

‘a kind of rash that causes a lot of Sch

itching’

wákka-wákka sóro ‘to walk to and fro-sore’ ‘a disease (Impetigo confluens)’ Fo

Most V-N constructs under regard are endocentric forms, where the second elements serve as semantic heads, as e.g. in slibi-bredi (sleep-bread) ‘bread that is no longer fresh’ or wippi-snekki (whip-snake) ‘a kind of snake’. Exocentric forms are rather few, (71) is an exhaustive list:

(71) broko-bakka ‘break-back’
broko-hai ‘break-eye’
djompo-hátti ‘jump-heart’

‘name of a creeper-plant (Mikania atriplicifolia)’ Fo

‘glance of contempt/grumpy glance’

Fo

‘fidgety or uneasy nature’

Fo

Examples of V-N constructs in (70) and (71) have no one-to-one equivalents in English. The semantic pattern according to which they are built is expressed in English by Present Participle-Noun compounds which are attested since Middle English times, e.g. serving man (ME), flying bridge (1489), flying fish (1511), falling sickness (1527) (Koziol 1972: 63) or by phrasal combinations of past participles with nouns, as e.g. broken heart, knitted hat etc. Early Sranan V-N combinations where V=A do not have any -ing or -ed marking. The absence of such a marking is not surprising, since all English derivational and inflectional markers were lost in the process of creolisation of Early Sranan.
In contrast, there are certain parallels to Fongbe, where the following compounds are attested (taken from Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 229):

276

(72) nu@-tı@tE@
nu@-wı@wlan@ xo-@ ÍıÍ@ ç@

‘thing-swollen’ ‘thing-written’ ‘saying-said’

‘abscess’ ‘writing/written form’ ‘discourse’

The Fongbe compounds in (72) consist of a noun and an adjective, which is created through reduplication of verbs. Such adjectives correspond to past participles in English, and are thus similar to the first elements in such Sranan compounds as brokko-klossi ‘broken clothes’, or kapâdoe-hágoe ‘castrated pig’. However, there are three differences between the Early Sranan V-N forms as in (70) and (71) and the Fongbe examples in (72). First, the first elements in many Early Sranan forms of this type correspond to present participles, and not past participles, i.e. they express on-going activities, such as ‘sleeping’, ‘scratching’, ‘wandering’ etc, and not only resultative activities, such as ‘broken’, ‘run-away’, ‘knitted’, as it seems to be the case with the Fongbe examples in (72). Besides, the Early Sranan adjectives of this type are not reduplicated, but are simplex in form. Finally, the Fongbe forms of N-A-type where A is a reduplicated verb, often contain the noun for ‘thing’, which is not the case in Early Sranan. The Ewe sources, such as Westermann (1907) and Schlegel (1856) also do not contain an indication of such patterns. Because of these discrepancies, it is unclear whether Fongbe or Ewe played any role in the emergence of Early Sranan V-N forms.

7.2.12. N-V constructs

There are a few combinations in Early Sranan whose second members are attested either as verbs only or as verbs and nouns:

(73) a. hattibronn ‘heart-to burn’

‘anger/wrath’

Sch

hâtti fadón ‘heart-to fall/fall’

‘stomach cramp’

Fo

tappobari ‘top/heaven-to cry’

‘thunder’

Sch

b. boon-jam

‘bone(s)-to eat/to hurt’

‘gout’

Sch

grunn sheki ‘earth-shake/shaking’

‘earthquake’

Sch

hái-drai

‘eye-to twist’

‘giddiness’

Fo

c. vool-kweki ‘hen-to breed/stock-breeding’ ‘chicken breeding’

Sch

277

Three second elements from (73): fadón ‘to fall/fall’, sheki ‘to shake/shaking’, and kweki ‘to breed/stock-breeding’ are multifunctional according to the information provided in their entries by Schumann (1783) and/or Focke (1855). For all the other second elements in (73), only verbal usage is attested or glossed. However, all second elements can be regarded as nouns since the constructs in (73) are right-headed complex nouns, and not verbs. They differ from other N-N compounds regarded above in terms of the syntactic relation between the two members. Whereas all other N-N constructs exhibit the modifier-head relation, the examples in (73) have the verb-argument relation, where the argument is either external, as in (73a) or internal, as in (73c). The examples in (73b) are ambiguous between these two types: as the paraphrases show, the first elements can be either subjects or objects of the verbs that surface in the paraphrases, e.g. boon-jam can be paraphrased as ‘to eat bones’ or as ‘bones hurt’, grunn sheki can be paraphrased as ‘to shake the earth’ or ‘the earth shakes’, etc.
There are both endocentric constructs among those in (73), as e.g. grunn sheki ‘earthquake’, and exocentric combinations, as e.g. hâtti fadón ‘stomach cramp’. Most of the examples in (73) are metaphoric formations and denote psychic states, as e.g. hattibronn ‘anger’, or physical states, as e.g. hái-drai ‘giddiness’, or natural phenomena, as e.g. tappobari ‘thunder’.
In general, the pattern according to which the N-V constructs are created seems to be unproductive in Early Sranan, since (73) is an exhaustive list.
The constructs in (73a) correspond to the root N-N compounds in English: nosebleed, sunshine (Bauer 1983: 205) which also have the verb-argument structure. Those in (73c) resemble English synthetic compounds of the type foxhunting, which are attested since Old English, e.g. blood-shedding (ME), childbearing (ME), thank-offering (1530), wool-gathering (1553) (Koziol 1972: 59).
The complex nouns under analysis do not come from English, but have several corresponding items in the substratum, as demonstrated in (74) (examples from Westermann 1905: 79; 78; 389):

(74) E. Sranan
grunn sheki hái-drai hattibronn tappobari

‘earth-to shake’ ‘eye-to twist’ ‘heart-to burn’ ‘top/heaven- to shout’

substratum

anyígba-ẃuẃu (Ewe) ‘earth-shaking’ nuku@n(mE) lE@lEﬂ (Fon) ‘eye-to twist’

dzi-bíbi (Ewe)

‘heart-burning’

dzí-d∞è-gbe (Ewe)

‘the heaven shouts’

English ‘earthquake’ giddiness ‘anger’ ‘thunder’

278

The parallels evident in (74) suggest that at least four out of seven Early Sranan N-V constructs have their roots in the substratum and are relexifications of the substratum complex items with the same meaning. I would suggest in this respect that the N-V pattern according to which the examples in (73) are created is not a genuine word-formation pattern, but is a result of transfer of several substratum items exhibiting the same structure. The most striking parallel between the creole and the substratum examples in (74) is the order of elements which is exactly the same in both languages.

7.2.13. Exocentric V-N constructs

A small group of Early Sranan complex nouns are V-N concatenations where the first elements can be regarded as verbs:

(75) diki gron

‘to dig-ground’

‘digger’

VD

drai-hai

‘to twist-eye’

‘giddiness’

Sch

drai-heddi ‘to twist-head’

‘giddiness’

Sch

kaka gout ‘to excrement-gold’ ‘squanderer’

VD

kákkabrudu ‘to excrement-blood’ ‘dysentery’

Sch

kakkawatra ‘to excrement-water’ ‘diarrhoea’

Sch

likki-han

‘to lick-hand’

‘name of a four-footed animal

Fo

(Myrmecophaga didactyla)’

njamm dótti ‘to eat-earth’

‘disease found among Blacks,

Fo

especially chlorosis, or green sickness

or worm-illness’

poeloe-pánngi ‘to pull-a wide cloth, ‘name of a military post near

Fo

the underskirt of Black Paramaribo, ‘Poelepaantje’’

women’

Two of the examples in (75) are ambiguous in terms of their syntactic structure: drai-hai and drai-heddi can be interpreted as constructs with the modifier-head structure: ‘twisted eye’ and ‘twisted head’ respectively or as having verbargument structure. Most examples in (75), however, have the verb-argument structure where the argument is an internal argument of the verb. They have the same order of elements as syntactic VPs in Early Sranan:

279

(76) pikien morre mi hieti den alle na hede lange da biki pletti little more 1SG hit DEF/PL all on head with DEF big plate Arends (1995b: 180): ‘One more thing and I’ll hit them all in the head with that big bowl.’ Van Dyk (c1765: 61): ‘Een beetje meer gooi ik jouluy na je Kop met die groote Schootel.’
In contrast to syntactic VPs, however, the examples in (75) function as X° nouns. In fact they are similar to the V-N pattern common in Romance languages and Papiamentu: cf. Papiamentu kargapilon (to carry-trunk) ‘elephant/camel’ (Dijkhoff 1993: 137-138). English also has a number of examples of this type: cut-throat, pickpocket, spoilsport, kill-joy (Bauer 1983: 205) which often, like the Early Sranan examples, denote persons. There is a controversy about their status. Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 79-83) claim that such forms do not have morphological structure but acquire it through a reanalysis rule that turns a VP into a noun. Rohrer (1977) suggests that the French VN compounds, such as e.g. essuie-glace (to wipe-windshield) ‘windshield wiper’ have agentive and instrumental meanings and can thus be regarded as formed by means of a zerosuffix. The zero-suffix is category-changing and acts as the head of the construction. In the case of Early Sranan, the postulation of the zero-suffix is problematic since there is no semantic consistency with which this zero suffix combines with the bases: in most cases in (75) the meanings are idiosyncratic.
Most examples in (75) are semantically exocentric, and denote persons, diseases, geographic names, and physical states. This pattern seems to be marginal in Early Sranan word-formation.
7.2.14. V-N-N constructs
Another type of constructs attested in the data have the structure V-N-N, as in (77):
280

(77) tápoe-sikién-pânngi ‘to close-body-an underdress ‘shawl’

Fo

of Black women/a wide cloth’

wassi-hán-kómiki ‘to wash-hand-basin’

‘basin for washing hands’ Fo

The examples in (77) are right-headed units with the modifier head structure. They are built according to the semantic pattern ‘object for doing X’. The nouns immediately following the verbs are their direct objects.
Both examples in (77) come from Focke (1855) and are the only ones of the V-N-N type attested in Early Sranan. Remarkably, a similar type of structure is very common among Ewe and Fongbe compounds, as the data in (78) demonstrate (examples for Fongbe are from Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 227); examples for Ewe from Westermann (1907: 124)):

(78) akplẽ-da-tsi
ati-tso-gbe
nu-tu-nu nu-$ tç@-nu@ xo-@ jla-@ we@ma$ yE$yE@-kpç@n-xwe@

‘dumpling-cook-spoon’ ‘tree-fell-day’ ‘thing-forge-thing’ ‘thing-sew-thing’ ‘story-spread-paper’ ‘baby-watch-house’

‘spoon for cooking dumplings’ Ewe

‘day for felling trees’

Ewe

‘blacksmith’s tool(s)’

Ewe

‘needle’

Fon

‘newspaper’

Fon

‘nursery’

Fon

The constructs in (78) are similar to the Early Sranan examples in (77) in that they are built according to the same semantic pattern. The difference lies in the order of the elements: whereas in Early Sranan examples the object of the verb follows it, in Fongbe and Ewe it precedes the verb. The substratum order is then similar to that of the English synthetic compounds of the type truck-driving or fox-hunting, where the objects truck and fox precede the verbs drive and hunt. However, English synthetic compounds do not correspond to the substratum items semantically, since they do not have the meaning ‘object for doing X’. In fact, English did not provide the model for Early Sranan constructs in (77) since it does not have a structurally and semantically similar pattern. Since the parallels to the substratum languages are evident, we can assume that the emergence of the pattern in question is the result of substratum influence. However, the substratum pattern was reanalysed in terms of the superstratum word order. Since in English, objects follow the verb in syntactic structures, as e.g. to close the door, to wash hands, etc., Early Sranan creators changed the substratum structures of the N-V-N type to have the V-N-N order in accordance with the evidence they had in the input.

281

The remarkable fact about the pattern in question is that there are only two attestations built according to it in the sources of Early Sranan which allows us an assumption about its marginality in Early Sranan word-formation. The explanation for this might lie in the relative structural and semantic complexity of such structures. Thus, it takes more time to process and produce such constructs semantically than, for instance, N-N constructs, or V-N constructs, since they involve two operations, combining a verb and a noun on the one hand, and [V-N]combination with another noun on the other. Besides, these two operations are also different in terms of the syntactic relation between the components. The [V-N] combination involves the verb-argument relation, whereas the combination of [V-N] and another noun demands the modification relation. This probably requires an extra effort in terms of processing and production. Note also that generally, items and patterns that are more complex semantically and structurally tend to be less productive since they bear additional semantic features and are therefore more restricted in meaning (cf. Baayen 1997: 194; Martin 1988: 147).

7.2.15. Constructs denoting day names

In all the three sources names of the days of the week are built according to the same pattern: [Num-de-worké]N, where the second element de (< Engl. day) is an independently attested noun meaning ‘day’ and the element worké is a noun meaning ‘work’ (< Engl. work). The only difference between the sources lies in the fact that Schumann uses the ordinal numeral fossi, and not the cardinal numeral wan, in the noun meaning ‘Monday’. These nouns, presented in (79), are taken from Van Dyk. For the item ‘Monday’ the examples from both Van Dyk and Schumann are provided:

(79) wan de worké
fossi deh worko toe de worké drie de worké fo de worké vyfi de worké zikkisi de worké

‘Monday’ ‘Monday’ ‘Tuesday’ ‘Wednesday’ ‘Thursday’ ‘Friday’ ‘Saturday’

wan (Num)

‘one’

VD

fossi (Num)

‘first’

Sch

toe (Num)

‘two/second’

VD

drie (Num)

‘three/third’

VD

fo (Num)

‘four/fourth’

VD

fyfi (Num)

‘five/fifth’

VD

zikkizi (Num) ‘six/sixth’

VD

282

Almost all first elements in (79) are multifunctional, with the exception of the numeral wan, which can be cardinal only, and the numeral fossi which is attested as an ordinal numeral only. Numerals beginning with toe can be interpreted as either cardinal or ordinal. Depending on this interpretation, constructs in (79) can be paraphrased either as ‘two days of work’ or ‘second day of work’, etc. However, in Schumann (1783: 189) the example na tu deh worko is translated as ‘am zweyten Werktag in der Woche’ (‘on the second workday of the week’). This implies the ordinal character of numerals in (79). However, it is unclear in this respect why the cardinal numeral wan, and not the ordinal numeral fossi ‘first’ is used in Van Dyk’s example wan de worké.
No matter what the interpretation actually is, complex words in (79) are semantically left-headed units, where the noun de is the head. Structurally and semantically they resemble the following syntactic constructions in Early Sranan, which I will call ‘partitive’ since they show a portion/quantity of some substance or objects:
(80) wan battra riddi wini one bottle red wine Arends (1995b: 180): ‘a bottle of red wine’ Van Dyk (c1765: 61): ‘een Fles Roode Wyn’
However, in contrast to phrases of the type exemplified in (80), complex words in (79) are single referential units: they function as inseparable N° items on the level of syntax and name a specific concept, ‘days of the week’. The pattern for their creation can be formalised as follows:
(81) [[X]Num[de][worké]]N ‘day of the week’
The origin of the pattern under regard is interesting. English did not provide the model for Early Sranan day names. However, Ewe has a similar pattern for the creation of days of the week which are viewed in connection to field work and are counted successively (Westermann 1907: 81):
283

(82) agble-toe-gbe ‘Monday’

agble-vee-gbe ‘Tuesday’

tõ-gbe

‘Wednesday’

vie-gbe

‘Thursday’

vie-toe-gbe

‘Friday’

agble-amie-gbe ‘Saturday’

‘field work-?22-day’
‘field work-two-day’ ‘three-day’ ‘?-day’ ‘?-day’ ‘field-work-?-day’

Ewe names of days of the week and those from Early Sranan are similar semantically in that they involve the noun ‘day’, numerals and the concept ‘work’. However, in Early Sranan all day names except for Sunday are created according to the same pattern, presented in (81) and are all semantically transparent. In Ewe, in contrast, the pattern is not as regular as in Early Sranan and includes some semi-transparent items. Other substratum languages also do not have a uniform pattern. Therefore, it can be concluded that Early Sranan creators transferred the day names from Ewe, but regularised the overall pattern. Besides, they reanalysed them in terms of the constituent order: whereas in Ewe the noun for ‘work’ precedes the combination of the numeral and the noun for ‘day’, in Early Sranan it follows this combination. In this case, the order is influenced by the superstratum, and follows the order of partitive syntactic phrases, as in (80). In general, the discussion shows that both substratum and superstratum can interact in the emergence of creole patterns and that regularisation of semi-transparent patterns is one of the processes operating in the transfer.

7.2.16. Constructs containing bound elements
There are two types of constructs containing bound elements in Early Sranan. The first type is exemplified in (83). Words belonging to this type have correspondent phrases or complex words in the lexifier languages:

22 The question mark in (82) indicates that the meaning of the element substituted by the question mark is unclear and not identifiable in Ewe.

All words in (83) are morphologically complex, because one of their elements is independently attested in one of the sources. The bold elements in (83) are bound. Some of them, such as binni, isre, jara, etc. can be regarded as unique morphemes: they are not attested in any other words and usually have parallel words on whose basis the uniqueness can be established, e.g. allamal is parallel to alla deh ‘daily’ and allatem ‘always’; bitem has parallels in dissitem ‘now’, areentem ‘rain-time’, dre-tem ‘drought’, etc. Some of the bound elements in (83), e.g. harti, are not attested independently, but occur in one more word, e.g. harti occurs in bróinharti ‘tree that yields wood used in carpentry’. In one case, nem ziki the element ziki is homonymous with the free morpheme meaning ‘to shake’ (Van Dyk c1765: 108). However, the relation is first, only phonogical, and second, accidental: the two different lexifier morphemes: sake and shake ended up with the same phonological makeup in the creole.
The bound elements in (83) are the result of partial decomposition of the equivalent complex words and phrases from the input languages. There are crucially two factors that trigger the appearance of bound elements in Early Sranan. First, the opacity and boundness of one of the constituent morphemes in the lexifier word itself can lead to the fact that only one, free and transparent, element is identified in the complex word to be borrowed, whereas the second remains bound and opaque. This is the case with the English yesterday, where day

285

was identified as a morpheme meaning ‘day’, whereas yester ended up as a bound and opaque morpheme. Second, the existence of a free morpheme with the same meaning in the creole can make certain morpheme from the lexifier end up as bound in the creole. This is what happened to the items such as konnetti ‘good night’, binnifóto ‘a name of a fort’ and dusentbeen ‘centipede’ in which the bound morphemes kon, binni and been have corresponding free morphemes in the creole, bun ‘good’, ini ‘inner’ and fóetoe ‘foot/leg’.
The bound elements in (83) make the complex words they occur in either semi-transparent, as in the case of tokofisi ‘stockfish’ where the whole word is still a hyponym of the second element, despite the opacity of the first element, or totally opaque, as e.g. in dusentbeen where the original Dutch word is metaphorical and this metaphorical relation is no longer perceivable in Early Sranan because of the boundness and non-interpretability of the morpheme been. Such examples confirm the assertion expressed in Braun and Plag (2003) that semantic opacity does exist in creole languages, and that one of its sources is the adaptation of complex words from the input languages and their partial decomposition.
The second type of Early Sranan words with bound morphemes is presented in (84). Most of these items differ from the examples in (83) in that they cannot be straightforwardly associated with complex words or phrases from the input languages.

The morphemes in bold are not attested independently in any of the three sources used. They can occur in some other words, as mussu which is attested in mussudeh ‘sunrise’ and mussudina ‘time before lunch’, or tri, which occurs in baboéntri ‘name of a tree’, boltri ‘name of heavy and hard wood’, kattantri ‘cottontree’. Or they are unique, like jabà in jabà-foetoe, or kro in krofaija.
For some of the bound elements in (84), the origin can be assumed, as for lifi in bradilifi which evidently comes from English. For others, such as mussu in mussudeh, the source is unclear. The origin of whole complex words in (84) is also uncertain in most cases. Some of the examples seem to be mixtures of items from two different input languages: in jabà-foetoe, e.g. the morpheme foetoe ‘foot/leg’ comes from English, whereas the origin of the element jabà is not English.
Two hypotheses can be advanced as to the existence of the bound elements in (84). On the one hand, we can assume that in some examples, bound elements might have been free and transparent some time in the language history, but lost their transparency and became bound in the course of language development. This, for instance, could be the case with the morpheme tri which, as I have shown above, occurs in a number of words in the meaning either ‘tree’ or ‘wood’. The free morpheme with the same meaning commonly used in Early Sranan is boom, which is of Dutch origin. It can be assumed that tri was a free morpheme at a very early stage of Sranan’s existence before Early Sranan came under the Dutch influence and adopted boom. However, we have no firm justification of such a scenario because of the lack of very early data.
Another hypothesis is that some of the complex items in (84) are loanblends, where one, non-bound, element was translated by a corresponding lexifier item, but another, the bound one, was not.
Nouns with bound elements discussed in this section reveal yet another strategy used by the creators of Early Sranan in forming their lexicons: borrowing of input language items with partial decomposition. This happened primarily to items borrowed from the superstratum languages, since all examples with bound elements in (83) have their source in either English or Dutch. This stands in contrast to the strategy used in respect to many substratum items which, as I have shown throughout this chapter, tended to be transferred fully, i.e. each of their
287

constituents was substituted by free and transparent elements from the lexifier. All in all, it shows how multi-faceted the process of creating the creole lexicon was.

7.2.17. Sentences, NPs and VPs rendering nominal concepts

Several examples attested in the sources are phrases or whole sentences that render nominal concepts. Most of them are attested in Van Dyk, none in Schumann, and only two in Focke.

In terms of their structure, examples in (85) can be divided into several groups. Those in (85a) are sentences consisting of a NP and a VP. Items in (85b) are also sentences with NP-VP structure, but differ from those in (85a) in that their NPs are expressed by a combination of the definite determiner da with the nouns

288

homan ‘woman’ or man ‘man’, or the indefinite determiner wan with the noun zomma/somma ‘person’23. The examples in (85c) consist of a NP and a relative clause introduced by the relativiser dissi ‘who/that’. The example in (85d) is a VP, and the one in (85e) consists of two sentences.
Semantically, two types of constructs can be differentiated in (85). Sentences and phrases in (85a) to (85d) are periphrastic constructions for names of persons, especially in terms of their occupation or physical abilities. They can be either idiomatic, as kalebassi no brokko jeti ‘calabash-not-break-yet’ meaning ‘virgin’, or semi-transparent, as all the other examples in (85a) to (85d). Examples in (85d) and (85e) are idiomatic items denoting a dish and a plant respectively, whose meanings cannot be figured out from the meanings of the separate elements.
Idiomatic expressions having a phrasal or sentential structure can be encountered in many languages, and the input languages of Early Sranan do not make an exception in this respect: consider the English merry-go-round or forgetme-not, or the Ewe and the Twi examples in (86), taken from Westermann (1907: 124) and Christaller (1875: 29) respectively:

Besides, the use of circumlocutions is viewed as common for the jargon stage of the pidgin-creole continuum. Mühlhäusler (1997: 137) observes that “rudimentary circumlocutions”, such as in (87), are exploited by the speakers of jargons to compensate for the small number of lexical items.

23 Arends (1995b: 70) suggests that such constructions can alternatively be regarded as NPs containing a relative clause without the relative pronoun. The support for this alternative analysis comes, according to Arends, from the fact that relative clauses without relative pronouns are attested in Early Sranan (cf. Bruyn 1995a: 160-172).

Chinese Pidgin English

‘he is bald’ (lit. ‘there is no grass Beach-la Mar on his coconut’) ‘egg’ (lit. ‘little one is inside’) Beach-la Mar

Although Mühlhäusler refers to the forms in (87) as ‘rudimentary circumlocutions’, they are rather complex in the sense that their meaning does not emerge uncontroversially from the meaning of their constituents.
Examples from other languages presented in (86) and (87) are all nontransparent constructs and therefore can be regarded as similar to only three examples from Early Sranan. The presence of such examples in Early Sranan shows that despite being a relatively young language, it has (although very few) structures which are complex both in structural and semantic terms.
The case of the remaining periphrastic constructions is a significantly different one. They are non-idiomatic paraphrases for concepts they denote. Remarkably, most of such constructions are attested in the earliest of the investigated sources, Van Dyk.
The question that arises now is why most periphrastic constructions denoting persons are attested in Van Dyk, and not in the later sources. In this respect, two hypotheses can be formulated here. On the one hand, one can assume that Van Dyk represents the stage of Sranan’s development where word-formation devices such as compounding and derivation were not fully-fledged and the use of periphrastic constructions was a compensation. Such a suggestion has been advanced by Arends (1995b: 42). At first sight, two issues would support this suggestion. Paraphrasing is a common strategy used by both native speakers in their L1s, e.g. in cases, where a certain word does not readily come to mind, and by L2 learners to compensate for the gaps in their L2 lexicons (Zimmermann 1990). For instance, in Zimmermann’s study (1990: 435), German learners of English paraphrase the German Kutscherhaus ‘coachman’s house’ with the English ‘house where a carriage driver used to live’. The second argument in favour of this hypothesis is that many of the periphrastic constructions from Van Dyk are expressed by complex words in the later sources. Only four periphrastic constructions from Van Dyk have corresponding periphrastic constructions in later sources. For instance, the periphrastic constructions expressing the fact of

290

somebody’s blindness in Van Dyk: anno habbe hay or joe hay tappe have two equivalents in Schumann (1783: 18): the construction wan somma nanga hai tappa (a person with eye closed) and the complex word blindeman (blind-PM), but only one in Focke (1855: 18): brínniman (blind-PM). Van Dyk’s da homan habi bile (the woman has belly), i.e. ‘pregnant woman’ is expressed by the NP uman nanga belle (woman with belly) in Schumann (1783: 14), but by the complex word bére-mán (belly-PM) in Focke (1855: 10). The circumlocution jessi tappe (ears closed) ‘deaf (person)’ is expressed by the complex word doofuman in Schumann and Wullschlägel, but Wullschlägel (1856: 224) also contains the same periphrastic construction hem jesi tapo (his ears are closed) ‘he is deaf’. Finally, Van Dyk’s circumlocution wan pikien disi mama lange tatà lassi (a child whose mother and father left) meaning ‘orphan’ is expressed in Wullschlägel (1856: 273) by the periphrastic construction wan pikìen, disi no habi tatà en mamà (lit. ‘a child who does not have father and mother’) and by the complex word wees-pikìen. We see that even if later sources contain periphrastic constructions which are similar to those in Van Dyk, they also contain nonperiphrastic ones. The remaining periphrastic constructions from Van Dyk either have no correspondences in later sources, or their equivalents are simplex or complex words, as is demonstrated in (88):

‘seamstress’ ‘widower’ ‘tailor’
‘clerk’

As the overview in (88) shows, in the later sources the preference is given to words, and not to periphrastic constructions, thus supporting our first hypothesis.

291

Let us now consider the alternative hypothesis. Van Dyk’s numerous circumlocutions can be viewed not as indicators of the early developmental stage, but as a normal language phenomenon that shows that Early Sranan speakers exploited different structural and semantic possibilities for expressing the same notion: coining complex words, inventing or borrowing simplex words, and naming concepts by paraphrasing them in the form of sentences. This phenomenon is not unknown for other languages as well, e.g. in English, beside using the complex word writer to signal that a given person is a writer, we can also express the same idea by giving it a sentence structure: ‘He writes books.’ What evidence do we have for this hypothesis?
First of all, we have already seen above that in later sources, the same notion, such as ‘deaf person’, ‘blind person’, ‘pregnant person’ can be expressed both by way of paraphrasing and by complex words. A closer look at the case of ‘pregnant woman’ shows that both Schumann and Focke use periphrastic constructions to express the idea of being pregnant, as it is demonstrated in (89), although Focke also has the complex word bére-mán (belly-PM).
(89) a habi belle 3SG have belly ‘She is pregnant.’ Schumann (1783: 14): ‘Sie ist schwanger.’ Dà hoeman ha’ bére DEF woman have belly ‘The woman is pregnant.’ Focke (1855: 10): ‘Die vrouw is zwanger.’ a de nánga bére 3SG COP with belly ‘She is pregnant.’ Focke (1855: 10): ‘Die vrouw is zwanger.’
Or consider the ways of expressing the concept of being deaf illustrated in (90):
292

(90) a. a doofoe 3SG be-deaf ‘He is deaf.’ Wullschlägel (1856: 224): ‘Er ist taub.’
b. hem jesi tapo 3SG ear closed ‘He is deaf.’ Wullschlägel (1856: 224): ‘Er ist taub.’
Examples in (89) and (90) show that in Early Sranan, like in any other language, different possibilities are used to express the same idea, and periphrastic constructions do not make an exception.
Another argument in favour of the second hypothesis is that beside using circumlocutions for denoting persons’ occupation, Van Dyk also contains quite a number of complex words, precisely 22, with the person marker -man. This indicates that creating complex words denoting persons by means of attaching the person marker -man must have been a productive process already in Van Dyk’s times. Besides, I have also shown above that Van Dyk contains other possibilities of creating new words, such as N-N, A-N, V-N compounding so that it can hardly be argued that it documents the stage when word-formation was still underdeveloped. In general it seems that even if a language has a great number of wordformation devices and processes, language users also make use of periphrastic constructions. The fact that later sources contain more non-periphrastic constructions can then be explained by the difference in the text type of these sources: whereas Schumann, Focke and Wullschlägel are dictionaries, i.e. lists of words, which probably document written register, Van Dyk is a language manual that largely reports spoken speech.
Besides, from the point of view of structural complexity, circumlocutions are more semantically and structurally complex than concatenations of two roots or of roots and affixes, and require an extra effort in production and processing. This fact might explain why in general circumlocutions are not a wide-spread phenomenon in Early Sranan.

7.2.18. N-fo/va/foe-N constructs

Beside sentences that express nominal concepts, all the three sources have a considerable number of phrases that contain the preposition fo/va/foe ‘of/for’ (further referred to as foe, for the sake of simplicity):

(91) bakki fo watieren ‘basin-for-water’

Sch

wirriwirri va grunn ‘hair-of-earth’

‘grass’

Sch

Most of the constructs in (91) consist of two nouns connected by the preposition foe. In some cases, the nouns can be modified either by an adjective, as in blakka dotti va kukru, where the noun dotti ‘dirt’ is modified by the adjective blakka ‘black’, or by a determiner, as in pikíen foe da slóto, where slóto ‘lock’ occurs with the definite determiner da. These constructs function as single referential units and are, like complex words, syntactically inseparable. The structure of the majority of foe-constructs can be formalised in the constructional idiom in (92):

(92) [[X]N[foe][X]N]N

Note, however, that in contrast to other idioms discussed above, the one in (92) does not generate constructs with one certain meaning since semantically, foeconstructs comprise diverse groups, such as names of persons, as bassiafo fiskale ‘bailiff’, objects, as kassi fo klossi ‘wardrobe’, and body parts, e.g. hai foe fóetoe

294

‘ankle(s)’, The latter are especially numerous: out of the 18 examples in (91), five are names of body parts. Most of foe-constructs are metaphorical creations.
In respect to the occurrence of phrase-like constructions in pidgins and creoles, Mühlhäusler (1997: 158) mentions that the lengthy circumlocutions of the jargon stage are gradually substituted by phrase-like formulas during the stabilisation stage, as the examples in (93) from Hiri Motu show:

(93) kuku ania gauna
godo abia gauna
traka abiaisi gauna

‘smoke-eat-thing’ ‘pipe’ ‘voice-take-thing’ ‘tape recorder’ ‘truck-raise-thing’ ‘jack’

Mühlhäusler (1997: 177) argues that with the progressing expansion of pidgins, there is a tendency to derive word-level constructs instead of phrase-level constructs: whereas the jargon stage is characterized by the use of unstable, rudimentary circumlocutions, the expansion stage is marked by the increasing use of compounding. In the case of Early Sranan, foe-constructs are often used both in Van Dyk, the earliest of the investigated sources, and in Focke, the latest. This again means that Van Dyk is similar to other sources in its use of phrasal constructions as names for concepts, and possibly does not represent an earlier, less complex stage of development. It further indicates that in Early Sranan, foeconstructs did not give way to compounding or derivation at some time of language development, but co-existed with them, as one of the possible ways of naming concepts.

The only item in (94) which is not complex in its structure is twáalfoe ‘twelve’, attested in Focke, which originates from the Dutch numeral twaalf and evidently substituted the initial complex form such as tînnatu. Besides, Focke also does not contain any form for ‘eleven’. In modern Sranan, both ‘eleven’ and ‘twelve’ are expressed by the items of Dutch origin: erfu and twarfu respectively (Wilner 1994: 28; 88). This allows the conclusion that under the influence of Dutch, some of Early Sranan lexical items used at the initial stages got out of use and were exchanged for Dutch items which possibly had high frequency of occurrence.
All the other examples in (94) consist of the numeral tîn (in Schumann’s examples) or tien (in Van Dyk’s and Focke’s examples), the element a (in Van Dyk’s examples) or na (in Schumann’s and Focke’s examples), and cardinal numerals from ‘one’ to ‘nine’. Tîn/tien comes from the Dutch tien and is an independently attested numeral, ‘ten’. The status of the element a/na deserves closer examination.
The morpheme a is attested independently in Van Dyk (c1765), but in the meaning of the third person singular pronoun ‘he/she/it’, which is definitely not the meaning surfacing in the items in (94). In Schumann (1783: 119) and Focke (1855: 85) na is attested as a preposition rendering general locative meaning, but this is also not the meaning that can be associated with the examples in (94).

296

However, Focke (1855: 86) also provides another entry for na: as the short form of the preposition nanga (< Engl. along) meaning ‘with/and’. In both Schumann and Van Dyk, the same preposition is attested. In Van Dyk, though, it has the form langa. The meaning of this preposition suits the numerals in (94): it indicates the addition of the cardinal numeral to the numeral ‘ten’, as in tien a wan ‘ten and one’, tien a toe ‘ten and two’ etc. It can be supposed therefore that in all the three sources, a/na is the contracted form of the preposition nanga/langa. Note that the difference between Van Dyk’s presentation of the contracted form, as a, and its presentation as na in Schumann and Focke is a purely orthographic difference since phonetically, combinations tien na and tien a are the same.
To summarise, constructs in (94) can be presented in the form of the following idiom:
(95) [[tien][na/a][X]Cardinal Num]Num ‘numerals from eleven to nineteen’
Numerals in (94) structurally differ from their English counterparts, which consist of the cardinal numeral and the element -teen, originally an inflected form of ten, meaning ‘ten’ (OED). The English examples do not contain any preposition. Moreover, whereas English also has two simplex forms, such as eleven and twelve, Early Sranan correspondences, at least from Van Dyk and Schumann, are complex items built according to the same pattern as all the other numerals in (94).
In the substratum languages different patterns are used. Thus, Fongbe uses a system where the numerals from eleven to fourteen are created by adding the numerals ‘one’, ‘two’, ‘three’ and ‘four’ to the numeral ‘ten’. However, numerals from ‘sixteen’ to ‘nineteen’ are built according to a different pattern: by combining the numeral a$fç$tç$n ‘fifteen’ (lit. ‘three feet’ which is perceived as three times a foot of five toes), the word nuk$ u@n ‘eye’ which is the coordinative marker in this construction, and the numerals ‘one’, ‘two’, ‘three’ and ‘four’ (Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 365-366), as in (96):

‘eleven’ ‘twelve’ ‘thirteen’ ‘fourteen’ ‘fifteen’ ‘sixteen’ ‘seventeen’ ‘eighteen’
‘nineteen’

It is evident that Fongbe and Sranan are similar in that both involve the decimal numbers and the addition principle in numerals from ‘eleven’ to ‘fourteen’. Besides, both languages use coordinative markers. However, Early Sranan pattern in (95) is not modelled on Fon. First, in Fon the conjoining element means ‘eye’, and the meaning of the Sranan a/na is ‘and/with’. Besides, the two also differ in function. The Sranan a/na is used to conjoin NPs, as in (97):

(97) mi de kali ju nanga hem 1SG CNT call 2SG with 3SG ‘I am calling you and him’ Schumann (1783: 120): ‘Ich rufe dich und ihn.’

The Fongbe correspondence to the Sranan a/na is the prepositional phrase headed by kpo@Ío@ ‘with’, and not nu$ku@n (Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 56):

(98) A$síba@ kpo@Ío@ Kç$ku@ kpo@ yì ax$ ì mE$ Asiba with Koku with go market in ‘Asiba with Koku went to the market.’

Second, the Fongbe numeral ‘fifteen’ is semantically and structurally completely different from ‘fifteen’ in Sranan, which is built according to the same structural and semantic pattern as all the other numerals of this type. Finally, Fongbe numerals from ‘sixteen’ to ‘nineteen’ are built according to a different principle: instead of adding to the numeral ‘ten’, the addition is made to the numeral ‘fifteen’.

298

In contrast to Fon, Ewe numerals from ‘eleven’ to ‘nineteen’ are formed according to a uniform pattern: by combining the morpheme ewo ‘ten’ with cardinal numerals from ‘one’ to ‘nine’ (Schlegel 1856: 98; Westermann 1907: 78):

(99)

wui-deka
wui eve wui eto wui ene wui atõ wui ade wui adre wui nyi wui nyide/wui ašieke

‘ten-one’
‘ten-two’ ‘ten-three’ ‘ten-four’ ‘ten-five’ ‘ten-six’ ‘ten-seven’ ‘ten-eight’ ‘ten-nine’

‘eleven’
‘twelve’ ‘thirteen’ ‘fourteen’ ‘fifteen’ ‘sixteen’ ‘seventeen’ ‘eighteen’ ‘nineteen’

Twi has the same system as Ewe: numerals from ‘eleven’ to ‘nineteen’ are combinations of the numeral edu ‘ten’ and the cardinal numerals from ‘one’ to ‘nine’, as e.g. in dúbā$kõ@ (ten-one) ‘eleven’, dúmìenú (ten-two) ‘twelve’, etc. (Christaller 1875: 50).
The principle of creating the numerals in question in Twi and Ewe is similar to Early Sranan: in all the three languages, cardinal numerals are added to the numeral expressing ‘ten’. But structurally, neither Twi nor Ewe numerals contain a conjoining element such as a/na in Early Sranan.
Another substratum language of Early Sranan, Kikongo, has exactly the same pattern as Early Sranan (Bentley 1887: 572):

(100) kumi ye moxi
kumi ye zole kumi ye tatu kumi ye ya kumi ye tanu kumi ye sambanu kumi ye nsambwadi kumi ye nana kumi ye vwa

‘ten-and-one’
‘ten-and-two’ ‘ten-and-three’ ‘ten-and-four’ ‘ten-and-five’ ‘ten-and-six’ ‘ten-and-seven’ ‘ten-and-eight’ ‘ten-and-nine’

‘eleven’
‘twelve’ ‘thirteen’ ‘fourteen’ ‘fifteen’ ‘sixteen’ ‘seventeen’ ‘eighteen’ ‘nineteen’

First, structurally, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the Kikongo and the Early Sranan numerals from ‘eleven’ to ‘nineteen’. Besides, there is a striking similarity between the coordinative markers used in the two languages. The

299

Kikongo ye24 in (100) is a preposition that has exactly the same meaning and functions as the Early Sranan nanga: it can conjoin NPs meaning ‘and’ and serve as a preposition meaning ‘with’ (Bentley 1887: 468; Laman 1912: 229; 231). It can be argued therefore that the Early Sranan numerals developed via transfer of the corresponding Kikongo numerals. The question arises why Early Sranan did not choose the Ewe or the Twi systems, which consist of two elements only and are thus less complex structurally. Indeed, the use of the addition principle and the numeral ‘ten’ in the formation of the numerals from ‘eleven’ to ‘nineteen’ is widespread among the languages of the world (Greenberg 2000: 774-776) showing that this is an unmarked option. However, as Greenberg (2000: 777) argues, mere juxtaposition of the mathematical components, without any linking morpheme is common, but not universal for numeric systems exploiting addition and multiplication. What seems to be more common for such systems is the use of a linking morpheme, as in Greek treis-kaí-deka (three-and-ten) ‘thirteen’. Greenberg (2000: 777) notes that one of the two most common links for addition is the associative ‘and’ or ‘with’. This is exactly what we find in Kikongo and in Early Sranan. It can be argued then, that the use of the linking ‘and/with’ presents a more transparent option than the mere juxtaposition. This might be the reason, why Early Sranan numerals resemble the Kikongo pattern and not the one from Ewe or Twi: although the Kikongo pattern seems to be more complex structurally, since it contains three, and not only two elements, it is more semantically transparent since the relation between the two numerals is overtly expressed by the linking element ‘and/with’.
The discussion above can provide a valuable insight into the factors influencing dialect levelling in creole formation. If we assume that there were several varieties of Sranan at the beginning, and some of them possibly used a different pattern for numerals from ‘eleven’ to ‘nineteen’, we can hypothesise that is was the more transparent one that survived out of the range of different options.
24 The default form of this preposition is ya. It acquires different other forms, such as ye or yo when combining with the articles of the nouns it is used with (Bentley 1887: 468).

The only exception to the pattern in question is the item twínti from Focke, which is evidently moulded on the lexifier word twenty. All the other examples in (101) contain a cardinal numeral and the morpheme combination ten tien/tentîn/temmtien. This morpheme combination consists of the numeral tien (< Dutch tien) meaning ‘ten’, which is independently attested in all the three sources, and the morpheme ten (in Van Dyk’s and Schumann’s examples) or temm (in Focke’s examples). The last two can be considered as phonological variants of the same morpheme ‘time’ since in Early Sranan there was a widespread confusion between the final /n/ and /m/, so that the English dream was rendered as dreen and drem, and them as dem and den (Smith 1987: 200). The morpheme tem(m) (< English time) is independently attested as a noun in all the three sources:

301

(102) a Za tan lange tem da plessi 3SG FUT stay long time DET place Arends (1995b: 130): ‘Will she stay there for a long time?’ Van Dyk (c1765: 24): ‘Zal zy lang op die Plaats blyven.’ gi dem tem va jam give 3PL time for eat ‘Give them time to eat.’ Schumann (1783: 29): ‘Gib ihnen doch Zeit zum Essen.’ Mi no ha’ temm 1SG NEG have time ‘I don’t have time.’ Focke (1855: 134): ‘Ik heb geen tijd.’

However, the meaning of the morpheme ten/temm in the numerals in (101) differs from the meaning of the free morpheme tem(m) in (102). The meaning of the noun tem in (102) can be described as ‘what is measured in minutes, hours, days, etc; amount of time’ (in German ‘Zeit’). The meaning of the element -ten/-temm in numerals from 20 to 90 is ‘multiplied by’ (in German ‘mal’). The independently attested noun tem(m) does not occur in the latter meaning in any of the three sources. Combinations of the kind tu tem(m) or dri tem(m) meaning ‘two times’ or ‘three times’ are not attested either in Early or in Modern Sranan. Instead, the noun tron/trom (< English turn) is used to render the meaning ‘multiplied by’, e.g. tutron ‘two times’, dritron ‘three times’, fotron ‘four times’ etc. (Schumann 1783: 187; cf. Focke 1855: 143; Van Dyk c1765: 29). Beside the examples in (101), the element -ten/-temm also occurs in the constructs of the type toe ten tien a vyfi ‘twenty five’.
The element -ten/-temm is used as a multiplication marker in the examples in (101). The constructional idiom behind these examples is as follows:

(103) [[X]Num[ten][tien]]Num

‘numerals from twenty to ninety’

The origin of this idiom is interesting in terms of the interplay between the substratum and universal factors, and will be discussed below.

302

In both Dutch and English numerals from ‘twenty’ to ‘ninety’ are created by means of the bound morphemes -tig and -ty respectively: Dutch twintig, dertig, veertig, vijftig etc.; English twenty, thirty, forty, fifty etc. Though the principle used in these two languages is similar to the one in Early Sranan: multiplication involving the number ‘ten’, the pattern according to which numerals from ‘twenty’ to ‘ninety’ are created in Early Sranan does not come from either Dutch or English. Although both -tig and -ty derive etymologically from the free morpheme meaning ‘ten’ (cf. Old Norse tigr and Gothic tigus ‘decade’ (OED)), this morpheme was bound already in Middle English and its meaning was no longer perceivable as ‘ten’. Therefore, on the one hand, it is improbable that the creators of Sranan could have identified English or Dutch numerals as complex words containing the morpheme -tig or -ty meaning ‘ten’. Second, whereas Early Sranan uses a special morpheme, -ten/-temm, to designate the mathematical operation of multiplication in the numerals in (101), in Dutch and English the pertinent numerals are connected by a mere juxtaposition, without any specific marker.
The pattern in the Gbe varieties such as Ewe and Fon also differs from what we encounter in Early Sranan. In Ewe the verb bla ‘to tie’ is attached to the cardinal numerals from ‘two’ to ‘nine’ to produce the tens from ‘twenty’ to ‘ninety’ (Schlegel 1856: 98-99; also Westermann 1907: 79), as it is shown in (104a). In Fongbe the numerals ‘twenty’ and ‘thirty’ are simplexes: ko$ and gba$n respectively (Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 365-366). Numerals from forty to one hundred sixty are formed on multiples of ‘forty’ and include the morpheme kan$ meaning ‘cord’25, as in (104b):

(104) a. b.

blave blato blane blaatõ kan$ Íe@ ka$n we@

‘tie-two’ ‘tie-three’ ‘tie-four’ ‘tie-five’ ‘cord-one’ ‘cord-two’

‘twenty’ ‘thirty’ ‘forty’ ‘fifty’ ‘forty’ ‘eighty’

25 As Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 366) note, the word ka$n denotes a cord that consists of “forty cowries strung onto a palm tree stick.” The meaning of this word allows us to better understand the multiplication principle behind the formation of numerals from ‘forty’ to ‘one hundred sixty’ in Fongbe.
303

However, other substratum languages of Early Sranan, such as Twi and Kikongo, have a similar, though not exactly identical pattern. In Twi, numerals from ‘twenty’ to ‘sixty’ are formed by means of attaching the plural form of the numeral adu ‘ten’ edu to numerals from ‘two’ to ‘nine’, as in adùonu (pl. of tentwo) ‘twenty’, adùasã (pl. of ten-three) ‘thirty’, etc. (Christaller 1875: 51). In Kikongo, the same pattern is used: the plural of the numeral kumi ‘ten’ makuma is combined with numerals from ‘twenty’ to ‘sixty’26 (Bentley 1887: 572; Seidel and Struyf 1910: 49), as in (105):

(105) ma-kumo-ole27
ma-kuma-tatu ma-kuma-ya ma-kuma-tanu ma-kuma-sambanu

‘plural prefix-ten-two’
‘plural prefix-ten-three’ ‘plural prefix-ten-three’ ‘plural prefix-ten-three’ ‘plural prefix-ten-three’

‘twenty’
‘thirty’ ‘forty’ ‘fifty’ ‘sixty’

Apart from the discrepancy in the order of elements between Early Sranan on the one hand, and Twi and Kikongo numerals on the other hand, the principle is similar in both languages: the cardinal numbers are multiplied by ten. However, Sranan differs from the two substratum languages in its use of the marker -ten/ -temm that indicates the mathematical operation of multiplication. Both substratum languages do not use such a marker, but pluralise the numeral for ‘ten’ instead. It can be concluded therefore that Early Sranan modelled the numerals in question on Kikongo and Twi in principle, but additionally used a special marker to designate the operation of multiplication explicitly. Why should it be so?
A pattern based on the number ‘ten’ and multiplication principle is rather wide-spread in the numeric systems of the world’s languages (Greenberg 2000: 773). Greenberg (2000: 773) points out that a numeric system based on the arithmetic functions such as addition and multiplication is one of the simplest systems attested. A pattern using a marker indicating the operation of multiplication is more semantically transparent than the one without any marker.

26 Numerals from ‘seventy’ to ‘ninety’ follow the same principle, but seem to undergo a stronger phonological reduction so that the form makuma (the plural of ‘ten’) does not surface in them. In fact, the information Bentley (1887) provides on these numerals is controversial: in his dictionary (1887: 336), he lists forms such as eighty and ninety which follow exactly the same pattern as all the other numerals in (105) and are uncontracted, whereas in his grammar notes (1887: 572), he lists the contracted forms. 27 The words that undergo different grammatical operations in Sranan’s substratum languages often suffer some phonological changes, hence the difference in the input and output forms of the examples provided. These changes cannot be explained here.
304

In this respect, the Early Sranan -ten/-temm serves as such a marker, making the multiplication principle more transparent. Remarkably, Greek uses a very similar strategy for higher numerals: hex-akis-khíli-oi (six-times-thousand-NOM.PL.M.) ‘six thousand’ (Greenberg 2000: 778).
In general, we can argue that the development of the numerals from ‘twenty’ to ‘ninety’ has been influenced both by the substratum and universal factors, such as semantic transparency. The creators of Early Sranan possibly have chosen the pattern in (103) because a similar one was available in two of the substratum languages, Kikongo and Twi, and presented a more semantically transparent option than the patterns of the Gbe varieties Ewe and Fon. This yields the same insight as mentioned in respect to the numerals from ‘eleven’ to ‘nineteen’ in the preceding section that the outcome of the competition in dialect levelling is most likely influenced by factors such as semantic transparency.

7.3.3. Numerals which are combinations of decimal numerals with cardinal numerals from ‘one’ to ‘nine’

Another group of complex numerals attested in Early Sranan is presented in (106):

VD

Sch

Numerals in (106) combine elements and structural principles from the numerals discussed in the two preceding sections. They consist of the numerals from ‘twenty’ to ‘ninety’, the coordination marker na ‘with/and’, which also surfaces in numerals from ‘eleven’ to ‘nineteen’, and cardinal numerals from ‘one’ to ‘nine’. Their structure can be formalised as follows:

305

(107) [[X]Num from 20 to 90[na][X]Num from 1 to 9]Num ‘numerals from ‘twenty one’ to ‘twenty nine’, and so on’
Like numerals from ‘eleven’ to ‘nineteen’, those in (106) employ the mathematical operation of addition to combine the two numbers, the decimal and the non-decimal ones. This operation is overtly expressed by the marker na, the contracted form of the preposition nanga ‘with/and’. As I have already mentioned above, the use of such a marker makes the mathematical operation clear, and thus renders the structure of numerals more transparent. The strategy to use such a marker is common among the world’s languages (Greenberg (2000: 777), cf. the German zweiunddreißig (two-and-thirty) ‘thirty two’).
The pattern in (107) is definitely not influenced by English, since English does not use any coordination marker between the decimal and the cardinal numerals from ‘one’ to ‘nine’, as in twenty-one, twenty-two, etc. Therefore, again, it makes sense to look for the parallels in the substratum languages.
Fongbe has a complex system for creating numerals corresponding to the Early Sranan ones under analysis. I will illustrate this system on the example of the cardinal numbers from ‘twenty one’ to ‘twenty nine’. Numerals from ‘twenty one’ to ‘twenty four’ are formed by combining the cardinal numeral ko$ ‘twenty’ with cardinal numerals from ‘one’ to ‘four’ by means of the coordinative marker nuk$ un@ (lit. ‘eye’), as it is shown in (108a). The numeral ‘twenty five’ is built in a different way: it consists of the numeral ‘twenty’ and the numeral ‘five’, without the coordinative marker nuk$ u@n, as in (108b). Numerals from ‘twenty six’ to ‘twenty nine’ follow a different pattern: they are combinations of the numeral ko$ at$ ç@n ‘twenty five’, the coordinative marker nuk$ u@n, and the cardinal numerals from ‘one’ to ‘four’, as in (108c). The data are taken from Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 366).

‘twenty one’ ‘twenty two’ ‘twenty three’ ‘twenty four’ ‘twenty-five’ ‘twenty six’ ‘twenty seven’ ‘twenty eight’ ‘twenty nine’

There are both similarities and differences between the Early Sranan numerals in (106) and the Fongbe system in (108). Although both languages seem to use the addition principle, indicated by a special marker, they differ in the ways of exploiting this principle and in the nature of the marker. Early Sranan uses the same principle of adding the same decimal number to cardinal numerals from ‘one’ to ‘nine’. Fongbe, in contrast, has three different patterns. The one in (108c) uses a rather different principle than Early Sranan: adding cardinal numbers from ‘one’ to ‘four’ to the combination of the decimal numerals with the numeral ‘five’. Besides, whereas Early Sranan’s marker is the preposition meaning ‘with/and’, the Fongbe marker is originally the item meaning ‘eye’. Therefore, we can conclude that Fongbe numerals did not serve as a model for Early Sranan numerals in (106).
In Ewe, the numerals like those in (106) are created by combining decimal numbers with cardinal numerals from ‘one’ to ‘nine’ through the item vo, whose exact meaning is unclear. Schlegel (1856: 99) suggests that vo means ‘to be different’, whereas Westermann (1907: 79) notes that it is identical with vo meaning ‘to be finished’, although it is unclear whether it is indeed the same item. Several examples taken from Schlegel (1856: 98) are shown in (109):

(109) blave vo deka
blave vo eve blave vo eto

‘twenty-CM-one’
‘twenty-CM-two’ ‘twenty-CM-three’

‘twenty one’
‘twenty two’ ‘twenty three’

The Ewe and the Early Sranan patterns are similar in two respects. First, in contrast to Fongbe, one and the same principle is used for all numerals. Second, both Ewe and Early Sranan use the addition principle indicated by a special marker. The major difference lies in the nature of the marker: whereas the Sranan

307

na comes from the preposition nanga meaning ‘with/and’, the Ewe vo seems to have a different origin: possibly from the verb ‘to be different’ or ‘to be finished’.
Kikongo, however, has exactly the same pattern as Early Sranan: it combines decimal numbers with cardinal numerals from ‘one’ to ‘nine’ uniformly by means of the preposition ye ‘and/with’: makumole ye ya (twenty-and-four) ‘twenty four’, makumole ye tanu (twenty-and-five) ‘twenty five’, etc. There is also a one-to-one correspondence in meaning and function between the Early Sranan coordination marker a/na and the Kikongo marker ye. Remarkably, in both Kikongo and Early Sranan, the same principle is used for creating numerals from ‘eleven’ to ‘nineteen’.
Although both Kikongo and Ewe use the same operation of addition, and the same structural principle of combining decimal numbers with cardinal numerals from ‘one’ to ‘nine’, the Kikongo pattern is more semantically transparent, since the meaning of the marker ye ‘with/and’ is clear and it uncontroversially expresses the operation of addition, which is not the case with the Ewe vo.
In conclusion, the Early Sranan numerals in (106) have been created by transfer of the corresponding Kikongo numerals. As it was the case with other Early Sranan complex numerals, the Kikongo numerals were chosen possibly because they are created according to a more semantically transparent pattern than patterns attested in other substratum languages, such as Fongbe or Ewe.
7.4. Formation of verbs
7.4.1. V-deictic element constructs
In Early Sranan, very few verbs are morphologically complex. Indeed, most verbs are members of multifunctional sets, so that multifunctionality is the major source of new verbs. However, a few groups of verbs with a further analysable structure can be distinguished. The group to be regarded in the present section contains examples that have a verb as their left-hand member and an element semantically
308

and etymologically corresponding to particles in English as their right-hand member. They are exemplified in (110)28:

(110) a. kommote ‘come-out’

komoto

‘come-out’

soékoe óto ‘seek-out’

b. tan oppe ‘stand-up’

c. bukudumm ‘bend-down’

fadom

‘fall-down’

liddom

‘lie-down’

zitdom

‘sit-down’

‘to come from/to come out/come back VD

from/to come up/to separate’

‘to go out/to stand up’

Sch

‘to look for/to seek-out’

Fo

‘to stand/to stand up/to get up (awake)’

‘to bend to the earth’

Sch

‘to fall (down)’

VD

‘to lie (down)’

Sch

‘to sit (down)’

VD

d. giwèh

‘give-away’ ‘to give away’

Sch

go we

‘go-away’

‘to go away/to leave/to run away’

VD

hitiwèh

‘throw-away’ ‘to throw away’

Sch

kongo we ‘let’s go-away’ ‘Let us go (away)’

Fo

póeloe we ‘to pull-away’ ‘to take away’

Fo

ron we

‘to run away’ ‘to run away’

VD

According to their origin, examples in (110) can be divided into three groups. The first group comprises items such as kommote, tan oppe, go we, ron we that come from English phrasal verbs: to come out, to stand up, to go away, to run away, and share at least one of their meanings with their English equivalents. Such items can be regarded as borrowings from English which, however, have gained additional meanings in the creole language. Their borrowing is not surprising because of the high frequency of occurrence of such items in English. Away, for instance, has the frequency of occurrence of at least 200 times per million words both in conversation and academic prose (Biber 1999: 561).
The second group consists of hitiwèh and póeloe we. The separate components of these items, such as hiti, póeloe and wèh/we also have English origin. However, the meaning of the items hitiwèh and póeloe we in Early Sranan is different from the meaning of the corresponding English phrasal verbs to hit away and to pull away. These two items can be either regarded as borrowings from English which have entered the language with a meaning different from their meanings in the lexifier. Or they were created independently from English, by combining the constituent morphemes in the creole language itself.

28 In the fourth column in (110), the etymological composition of the items is provided. The morphological composition will be discussed in the present section.
309

The last group comprises items such as kongo we, soékoe óto and bukudumm which do not have direct equivalents in English or Dutch. The first of them consists of elements of English origin only, whereas the last two combine elements of Dutch origin, such as soékoe (< Dutch zoeken) and buku (< Dutch bukken), and of English origin, such as óto (< Engl. out) and dumm (< Engl. down). The items from this last group cannot be regarded as direct borrowings from the lexifiers.
Three questions arise with respect to constructs in (110). First, what is the status of their right-hand elements in Early Sranan? Second, how can such forms be accounted for in terms of structure and headedness? Finally, what is the status of these formations in Early Sranan: are they X° naming units or separable syntactic phrases? I will give regard to each of these issues in turn.
In connection to the first question, we should investigate whether the second elements in (110) are bound or free. This is in fact a vexed issue. The elements ote/oto and we/wèh are not attested independently in Van Dyk (c1765) or Schumann (1783). In Focke (1855: 149; 94) there are separate entries for both we and oto which are defined as adverbs with the meanings ‘away’ and ‘out’ respectively. However, in Focke’s dictionary these two morphemes occur only in combination with other morphemes: in verbs, which are all listed in (110), and in the adverb réti óto (right-out) ‘straight on’. Focke (1855: 94) remarks in respect to oto that it occurs predominantly in combination with something else. Moreover, despite a number of words in which the two morphemes in question occur, sentences of the kind *A we. or *A oto. which would be equivalent to the English He is away, He is out, and thus would allow us to assume that the morphemes we and ote/oto are free in Early Sranan, are not attested in any of the early sources. The separate element we/wèh meaning ‘away’ is also not attested in Wilner (1994). In fact, to indicate the direction of a motion expressed by ‘out’ and ‘away’, serial verb constructions as in (111) are employed, where items like kommote, or go we and not ote/oto and we/wèh are used in Van Dyk, Schumann, Focke, and Wullschlägel:
310

(111)

a. poele loete kommotte. pull root come-out Arends (1995b: 177): ‘...pull the roots out.’ Van Dyk (c1765: 58): ‘.. haalen de Wortels wel uit de Grond.’
b. Jari joe ziza go we na fotte. carry your sister go-away to fort Arends (1995b: 130): ‘Take your sister to the ‘fort’ (i.e. Paramaribo).’ Van Dyk (c1765: 24): ‘Brengt u Zuster aan Paramaribo.’
c. tjarri goweh carry go-away ‘carry away’ Schumann (1783: 180): ‘wegtragen, webringen, wegführen’
d. A fadón komópo na mi hánoe 3SG fall come-out on my hand ‘It fell out of my hand.’ Focke (1855: 38): ‘Het is mij uit de hand gevallen, het is mij ontvallen.’
e. kali hem komoto call 3SG come-out ‘Call him away.’ Wullschlägel (1856: 275): ‘wegrufen’

Notably, in Modern Sranan the motion away from the point of reference can also be rendered by the verb gwe used in serial verb constructions, e.g. seni gwe ‘send away’, tyari gwe ‘carry away’ (Wilner 1994: 38; cf. also Migge 2003a: 92).
The foregoing evidence suggests that oto/ote and we/wèh are bound morphemes in Early Sranan. However, in Wullschlägel (1856: 275), there is an example sentence where wei is separated from the verb it belongs to by other words:

311

(112)

a gi alla hem sani wei 3SG give all his thing away ‘He gave all his things away.’ Wullschlägel (1856: 275): ‘Er gab Alles weg.’

This example is strange, taken the fact that in all the three sources of Early Sranan used for the present analysis, such cases of separation are not attested. Since Wullschlägel is not as reliable a source as, for instance, Focke or Schumann, it is difficult to assess the credibility of this example. This separation might have been applicable to some verbs, such as giwei, but not to others, such as gowe. Therefore, it can be suggested that we/wèh is a bound morpheme in Early Sranan, despite the example in (112). The foregoing allows a generalisation that the elements we and oto/ot(t)e are not free in Early Sranan.
The case of the morpheme oppe occurring in the unit tan oppe is different. In all the three sources, oppe is attested independently as a verb in the meaning ‘to open’, as in (113a), and also as a verb meaning ‘to lift up’, as in (113b):

(113) a. b.

ope wan battra ridi wini. open INDEF bottle red wine Arends (1995b: 224): ‘Open a bottle of red wine.’ Van Dyk (c1765: 100): ‘Geef ... een Fles Roode Wyn.’ ..oenno zikkesi zomma ope da homen. 2PL six people lift up DEF woman Arends (1995b: 237): ‘The six of you lift up the woman.’ Van Dyk (c1765: 111): ‘...neemt met jou zeszen de Kist op.’

These two instances, however, differ from oppe in tan oppe in their meaning. Besides, oppe can occur in combination with the verb ope ‘to lift’: opo tanápoe ‘to stand up’ (Focke 1855: 131).
Beside the two functions in (113), oppe is also cited in different sources with the meaning ‘up’. Schumann (1783: 67), who spells ope as hoppo, provides the meaning ‘up’ for this item, beside the meanings ‘to stand up’, ‘to lift’, ‘to open/open/to be open’. Wullschlägel (1856: 19-20; 24; 25) also provides opo, opoe as the morpheme meaning ‘up’ which is used in such constructs as broko
312

opo ‘to break out’, djompo opo ‘to jump up’, gro opo ‘to grow up’. Focke (1855: 94) provides an entry for what he calls ‘adverb’ opo meaning ‘up’ and makes the remark that it is used in connection with a river or a water stream. Examples provided by Focke for the adverbial opo, however, reveal that the syntactic slots in which the adverb opo occurs are typical of nouns and adjectives:

(114)

Mi de go na ópo, na ópo-séi 1SG CNT to go on up on up-side ‘I go up, up the river.’ Focke (1855: 94): ‘Ik vaar naar boven, ik ga de rivier op.’

In (114) ópo is similar to what Migge (2003a: 101) calls “locational specifier” in a locational phrase and is a noun. There are two differences between ópo in (114) and oppe in tan oppe. First, although both seem to indicate a motion, ópo in (114) indicates a movement up the river, which is not the case with ope in tan oppe. Second, the spelling of oppe in tanoppe and as a free element meaning ‘up’ is different in some cases. In Schumann (1783: 172; 85) the spelling of the etymologically the same element is different in different words: it is appe in tannappe, oppo in kommoppo ‘to come out’, and hoppo when it has the meaning ‘up the river’ or ‘to lift’. In Focke (1855: 131), this element has two spelling variants: ápoe and ópo in tanápoe/tanópo, and opo ‘up’. The spelling discrepancies might also be indicative of fact that the link between oppe in tan oppe and when meaning ‘up’, as in (114), was blurred. In general, the foregoing allows us to make a conclusion that oppe is a bound element in tan oppe.
The element dumm (< Engl. down) differs from those regarded above in that it is attested independently in one sentence in Van Dyk and also in Nepveu (1770):

(115) a.

Zon dom kaba. sun down already ‘The sun is down already.’ Arends (1995b: 122): ‘The sun has gone down.’ Van Dyk (c1765: 127): ‘De Zon gaat onder.’

313

b. Moen go don. moon go down ‘The moon goes down.’ (Nepveu 1770: 282): ‘De Maan gaat onder.’

However, in Schumann and Focke it is not attested independently. There are also no entries for dumm/dom in these two sources, and the meaning ‘down’ is rendered by the word bilò. It can be suggested therefore that the morpheme dumm is bound in Early Sranan.
The conclusion we can make so far about the status of the final elements in (110) is that they are bound morphemes. They have a specific meaning that modifies the meaning of the preceding verb. They function as deictic markers indicating the direction of the action denoted by the left-hand verbs.
Turning now to the second of the three questions raised at the beginning of the present section, we can now suggest that the items in (110) are complex words consisting of a verb, mostly denoting motion, and a bound morpheme that carries a deictic meaning. Syntactically, they are X°, functioning either as verbs, or as serial verbs29, as it is shown in (116):

(116)

putti dem battra tannappe put DEF.PL bottle up/upright ‘Put the things up(right).’ Schumann (1783: 106): ‘stell die Bouteillen aufrecht.’ Pótti dem sanì tanápoe put DEF.PL thing up/upright ‘Put the things up(right).’ Focke (1855: 106): ‘Zet die dingen overeind.’

The left-hand elements in (110) can be regarded as heads, whereas the right-hand elements are direction adjuncts. The two stand in the relation of complementation to each other, which explains the left-hand position of the verb.

29 The actual status of serial verbs is controversial because they may exhibit some properties untypical of verbs. For a discussion, see Migge (2003a: 90-99), Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 299-346; 399-443).
314

Semantically, most verbs in (110) are activity verbs denoting motion. When functioning as serial verbs they indicate the direction of motion. In most cases they have additional meanings, different from their English counterparts (e.g. kommote, tan op(p)e).
As to the origin of such verbs in Early Sranan, we have seen that some of them entered the creole via borrowing from English, and a high frequency of occurrence of such phrasal verbs, as to go away, to run away, to stand up in English might have promoted their borrowing as entities. However, they must have been reanalysed as complex entities by creole creators since they have been further used for the creation of other items, such as bukudumm ‘bend down’ and soékoe óto ‘to look for/to seek out’ which have no direct correspondences in English. Such constructs are marginal in Early Sranan word-formation, since the list in (110) is exhaustive.
In general, it can be concluded that borrowing of complex words from the superstratum, their subsequent reanalysis and analogical creation of innovations was one of the ways by which new items entered the creole lexicon.

7.4.2. V-V constructs

Another group of complex verbs attested in Early Sranan are combinations of two verbs:

(117) ja go

‘carry-go’

‘to bring (away from the point of reference)’

VD

jarri kom

‘carry-come’ ‘to bring (in the direction to the point of

VD

reference)’

kongo/kon go ‘come-go’ ‘come! let’s go/to go’

VD

ron go

‘run-go’

‘to run away’

VD

tróesoe go ‘push-go’

‘to push away’

Fo

troesoe komm ‘push-come’ ‘to push open’

Fo

wakka komm ‘walk-come’ ‘to come here’

Fo

Units in (117) consist of two elements each of which is independently attested in Early Sranan as a verb of motion. However, the second elements go and kom do not maintain their full verbal meaning ‘to go’ and ‘to come’, but rather function as deictic markers, indicating the direction of motion: whereas go points to the

315

motion away from the point of reference, kom indicates the direction to the point of reference.
The major question that arises in respect to the units in (117) is about their status. At first sight they appear to be complex naming units: they have a specific meaning and consist of two elements. Indeed, like complex words, some of the units in (117) are not attested in the separated form, as the following examples show:

(118)

a. Wi ja go na watere zy

1PL to carry to go to water side

‘We brought to the water-side.’

Arends (1995b: 236): ‘We brought them ...by waterside.’

Van Dyk (c1765: 110): ‘Wy hebben hem aan de Waaterkant gebrogt.’

b. Kongo

myki wi go na hosse

to come-to go to make 1PL to go to house

Arends (1995b: 230): ‘Come, let’s go into the house.’

Van Dyk (c1765: 105): ‘Laat ons na Huis gaan.’

c. Mastra Hendrik ron go hessi na hosse

Master Hendrik to run to go quickly on/to house

Arends (1995b: 217): ‘Master Hendrik, go home quickly.’

Van Dyk (c1765: 94): ‘Meester Hendrik loop gaauw na Huis.’

d. mi za ron go na fotte

1SG FUT to run to go to fort

Arends (1995b: 205): ‘I’ll go to the fort.’

Van Dyk (c1765: 83): ‘Ik will gaauw na het Fort.’

However, the unit ja go in its full form jarri go is attested in a separated form. Jarri kom is attested both with an intervening element between the two components and without:

316

(119)

a. Da zo wi jarri didde zomma go that so 1PL to carry dead person to go Arends (1995b: 237): ‘That is how we carry our dead away.’ Van Dyk (c1765: 111): ‘Zo brengen wy onze Dooden weg.’
b. Na dinatim jarri kom. on/at dinner-time to carry to come Arends (1995b: 151): ‘Bring it in the afternoon.’ Van Dyk (c1765: 38): ‘Brengt het van Middag meê.’
c. jarri hem kom carry 3SG come Arends (1995b: 194): ‘Bring him here.’ Van Dyk (c1765: 74): ‘Breng hem hier.’

There is a straightforward explanation for the discrepancy between the examples in (118) and in (119). Those in (118) have primarily intransitive verbs such as kon ‘to come’ and ron ‘to run’ as their first elements, whereas those in (119) contain the transitive jarri ‘to carry’ as their second element. Since intransitive verbs do not take any objects, it is clear that they will show a tendency not to be separated, because usually, it is an object that separates the first and the second components in (119).
Since at least some units in (117) are attested in a separated form, they cannot be regarded as complex words. In fact, they should be considered as examples of serial verb constructions where two or more verbs are combined to form a complex predicate (Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 399). Since all the other forms, even those which are not attested in the separated form, like kongo and ron go, have the same syntactic and semantic structure, they should also be regarded as instances of serial verb construction. This type of construction is not regarded as an instance of compounding by Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 221, 234, note 1) who suggest that concatenations of two verbs in Fongbe should be best analysed as complex predicates. Examples of serial verb constructions from Fongbe presented in Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 409-410) bear a striking similarity to the Early Sranan examples in (118) and (119):

317

(120) a. Kç$ku@ sç@/ze@ a$s@n yı$ a$xì mε$

Koku take crab go market in Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 409): ‘Koku brought crab to the market.’ (direction away from the speaker) b. Kç$ku@ sç@/ze@ a$sn@ wa@ ax$ ı$ mε$

Koku take crab come market in Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 410): ‘Koku brought crab to the market.’ (direction towards the speaker) c. Kç$ku@ kan@ -wez$ un$ yı$

Koku run

leave

Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 425): ‘Koku ran away.’ (from the

speaker)

Migge (2003a: 90-99) provides similar examples of serial verb constructions from Eastern Maroon Creole of Suriname and also shows striking parallels to the constructions in some Gbe varieties. Remarkably, the Fongbe examples show that the two verbs can occur with and without intervening elements, in the same way as in Early Sranan.
To summarise, combinations such as those in (117) should be regarded not as words, i.e. X° naming units, but as syntactic constructions. However, it seems that some of them, such as kongo, acquired lexicalised meanings and function as inseparable units.

7.5. Formation of items corresponding to adverbs in English
The Early Sranan data contain a number of complex items that correspond semantically and functionally to adverbs in languages like English. Such items usually express locative and temporal concepts or describe the manner of action and function as clausal modifiers. However, in contrast to English, where adverbs are often created by a specific suffix, Early Sranan items rendering locative and
318

temporal concepts are often combinations of determiners and nouns. In the present section I will give regard to different types of concatenations attested in Early Sranan by which meanings usually associated with adverbs in languages like English are expressed. I will often refer to such items as ‘adverb-like’ items for the sake of simplicity.

In terms of their structure Early Sranan items rendering locative and temporal concepts make up a rather heterogeneous group. They can consist of two adverbs,

30 It is unclear whether the base gran(oe) in grán-we/gránoe-we indeed corresponds to the adjective gran meaning ‘big/great’, because of the temporal meaning of grán-we.
319

as in (121a), of a determiner and an adverb, as in (121b), or of a determiner and a noun, as in (121c), and of the negator nebre ‘never’ and a noun, as in (121d), or of a negative of the negative particle nó and an adverb, as in (121e), or of an adjective and a bound deictic marker, such as we (< Engl. (a)way) ‘away’, óto (< Engl. out) ‘out’, and ópoe (< Engl. up) ‘up’, as in (121f). The status of ini and nebre as free morphemes is controversial: although they are attested in several complex items, they never occur independently in the way they occur in English, for instance. Therefore, I regard them as bound. The final structural group presented in (121g) comprises items consisting of three elements.
Two further remarks on the structure of the complex words in (121) can be made. As I have already mentioned above, a considerable number of Early Sranan ‘adverbs’ are combinations of determiners and nouns, as in (121c). The determiners do not specify the accompanying nouns, but rather modify them. Besides, they are not used for the purposes of deixis or anaphora. In fact they bear a greater similarity to adjectives. Combinations of determiners and nouns rendering locative and temporal concepts are also not uncommon in Ewe (Schlegel 1856: 108; Westermann 1907: 81-82) and Fongbe (Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 385-386).
All items in (121) are X° syntactic units. Although there are examples where some items are attested with an intervening element between the two components, a closer inspection shows that in such cases there is a difference in meaning between the complex word and the separated syntactic phrase: the meaning of the latter is not specific, as it is shown in (122):

(122)

a. wan bon plessi INDEF nice place Arends (1995b: 134): ‘a good place’ Van Dyk (c1765: 27): ‘een goeje plaats’
b. alle toe wikki tem all two week time Arends (1995b: 145): ‘every two weeks’ Van Dyk (c1765: 34): ‘alle veertien Daagen’

320

Items in (121) usually modify clauses and can occupy a variety of positions in a clause:

(123)

a. clause initial position: pikin morro, da banna sa meki little more DEF banana FUT make ‘Soon this banana will make fruit.’ Schumann (1783: 110): ‘In kurzem wird diese Bananne Frucht haben.’
b. clause final position: Mi zi joe noefetrom 1SG to see 2SG enough-time Arends (1995b: 98): ‘I see you often.’ Van Dyk (c1765: 6): ‘Ik zie haar dikwils.’ ju sa du datti wantem 2SG FUT do that once ‘Will you do it once?’ Schumann (1783: 196): ‘Wierst du das wol irgend einmal thun?’
c. between the subject and VP: ...maar pranasie alle tem takkere but plantation all-time to be bad Arends (1995b: 201): ‘...but the plantation is in bad shape all the time...’ Van Dyk (c1765: 79): ‘maar dat de Plantagie ‘er slegt uit ziet.’
d. between V and its object: Joe takki ale de fransze tonge. 2SG to talk all-day French language Arends (1995b: 151): ‘Do you speak French every day?’ Van Dyk (c1765: 38): ‘Spreek je alle Daagen wel Frans.’

Usually, the items in question (e.g. alle tem, alle de, pikin morro) have variable positions in a sentence.
Semantically, components of combinations in (121) express primarily temporal or locative concepts. Nouns used in these concatenations are abstract and have rather generalised meanings, such as ‘time’, ‘place’, ‘day’. The semantic range of determiners involved in concatenations in (121c) is rather wide: assertive
321

(zom), quantitative (alle, noefe), demonstrative (da), indefinite (wan). The following semantic groups of adverb-like items can be distinguished:

The examples in (124) show that the semantic range of Early Sranan adverb-like items is neither simplex nor reduced. There is an interesting correlation between the semantic type of an adverb-like item and its components: temporal and habitual items often contain the nouns tem ‘time’ and deh ‘day’, whereas many locative items have the noun plessi ‘place’ as their second component. The same nouns are used in these types of adverb-like items in Ewe (Westermann 1907: 8182), Fongbe (Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 385-386) and Twi (Christaller 1875: 42; 84).
Another interesting observation that arises on the basis of (124) is that there are very few items expressing manner among the Early Sranan adverb-like items. This can be explained by the fact that meanings which are usually rendered by manner adverbs in -ly in English, such as nicely, secretly, slowly, can either be expressed by multifunctional items, such as krin meaning ‘clearly’ which can also be a noun, ‘light/shine’, a verb, ‘to be clear/to shine’, and an adjective, ‘clear’, or by the prepositional phrase with the structure ‘na-A-fasi’ (in-A-manner), as e.g. na odofasi (in-mysterious-manner) ‘mysteriously’ (Schumann 1783: 126).
As to the origin of the adverb-like items in (121), some of them, such as zomtem ‘sometime(s)’, fára-we ‘far away’, initem ‘at any time/always’ and nómo

322

‘no more’ can be attributed to English. However, the latter has two additional meanings, not attested in English. Most of the other items in (121) have no direct parallels in English. In contrast, the parallels to substratum languages are evident. In Fongbe, Ewe and Twi, adverbial concepts can also be expressed by morphologically complex units that are concatenations of different types of lexical categories, such as verbs, adjectives, nouns (Christaller 1875: 77-89; Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 384-391; Schlegel 1856: 108-117). The following parallels between some of the Early Sranan and substratum adverb-like items appear as especially striking:

(125)

‘every day’
‘daily’ ‘everywhere’
‘any time’
‘any time’ ‘there’ ‘anywhere’
‘anywhere’ ‘anywhere’ ‘one time’

Similarities between the Early Sranan and the Gbe items in (125) again allow a generalisation that creators of Early Sranan calqued several complex adverb-like items from their mother languages, beside creating innovations.

7.6. Formation of functional categories

7.6.1. Indefinite pronouns

Several complex words in Early Sranan function as indefinite pronouns:

(126) alle zanti

‘all-thing’

‘everything/anything’

VD

alle zomma ‘all-person’

‘everyone’

VD

ibriwansanni ‘each-thing’

‘each separate thing’

Sch

iniwan somma ‘every-person’ ‘everyone’

Sch

wan zanti

‘INDEF-thing’ ‘something’

VD

wan zomma ‘INDEF-person’ ‘someone’

VD

323

All complex words in (126) are combinations of determiners, such as the universal determiners alle ‘all’, and ibriwan ‘each’, and the indefinite determiner wan ‘a’, with the nouns zanti ‘thing’ and zomma ‘person’.
Pronouns containing zanti/sanni ‘thing’ have non-personal reference, whereas those containing zomma ‘person’ have personal reference. All examples in (126) substitute noun phrases and have a generalised meaning, as is shown in (127):

(127)

a. mi za myki alle zanti klari fo joe 1SG FUT make everything clear for 2SG Arends (1995b: 214): ‘I’ll make everything ready for you.’ Van Dyk (c1765: 91): ‘Ik zal alles klaar maaken.’
b. somma gi ju wansanni, ju musse takki tangi person give 2SG something 2SG must say thanks ‘When somebody gives you something, you must thank him.’ Schumann (1783: 160): ‘Wenn dir jemand was gibt, so must du danken.’
c. Mi zi wan zomma. 1SG see someone Arends (1995b: 118): ‘I see someone.’ Van Dyk (c1765: 17): ‘Ik zie iemand.’

Some of the items in (126) are attested in a separated form, as the examples in (128) show:

(128)

a. Miki wie doe wan tra zanti. make 1PL do INDEF other thing Arends (1995b: 137): ‘Let’s do something else.’ Van Dyk (c1765: 29): ‘Laat ons wat anders doen.’

324

b. Mikki den ga na da kamere fo mi en tikki alle da zanti fo mi make 3PL go on DEF room of me and take all DEF/PL thing of me fo ja go na boote. for carry go to boat Arends (1995b: 229): ‘Let them go to my room and bring all my things into the boat.’ Van Dyk (c1765): ‘Laat ze in myn Kamer gaan om al myn Goed te krygen en brengen dat in de Boot.’
c. da wan biggi somma it-be INDEF thick person ‘It is a big person.’ Schumann (1783: 16): ‘Das ist ein dicker Mensch.’

However, such examples differ from the pronouns in (126) in that the nouns zanti and zomma/somma preserve their full meaning in them, whereas in (126) this meaning is generalised. Besides, phrases in (128) are full NPs, and not pronouns, as in the examples in (127).
The source of the pronouns in (126) lies in the substratum languages of Early Sranan where indefinite pronouns are primarily combinations of determiners, especially of the indefinite determiner, and the nouns ‘person’ and ‘thing’, as in (129) (examples for Ewe are from Schlegel (1856: 94) and Westermann (1907: 134); examples for Fongbe from Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 368; 370); and examples for Kikongo are from Bentley (1887: 73; 199); and Laman (1912: 150)):

(129) a. lekwa yawanso ‘thing-every/all’
mE$-Ío$kpoÍ@ o$kpo@ ‘person-each’

b. lekwa

c. ame-d∞e

muntu

‘person’

‘everything’ ‘everyone’ ‘something’ ‘something’ ‘something’ ‘something’ ‘someone’ ‘someone’ ‘someone’

Kikongo Fon Kikongo Kikongo Ewe Fon Ewe Fon Kikongo

As it becomes clear from (129), the closest correspondences exist between Early Sranan and Gbe pronouns: in both languages the indefinite determiner is

325

combined with the nouns denoting ‘thing’ and ‘person’, whereas Kikongo uses these nouns without any determiner. The only difference between the Early Sranan pronouns in (126) and the substratum forms is in the constituent order: whereas in Early Sranan, as in English, the determiner precedes zanti/sanni and zomma/somma, in the Gbe languages it follows them. Because of the close parallels between the substratum and the creole forms, we can conclude that the Early Sranan indefinite pronouns in (126) are the result of the transfer of equivalent substratum items.

7.6.2. Negative pronouns

The following Early Sranan combinations have a function similar to negative pronouns in English:

(130) a. no wan

‘no-one’

‘nobody’

VD

b. no wansanni

‘no-INDEF/one-thing’ ‘nothing’

Sch

no wan zomma ‘no-INDEF/one-person’ ‘nobody’

VD

The example no wan consists of the negative marker no, and the pronoun wan ‘one’. The remaining two examples also contain the negative marker and the item wan, and additionally, the nouns sanni ‘thing’ and zomma ‘person’. However, in these examples, it is unclear whether wan is a determiner or a pronoun, since two structural interpretations are possible. On the one hand, we can assume that wan is a pronoun in (130b) that builds an entity with the negator no, together they modify the nouns sanni and zomma. In this case, the bracketing for (130b) is as follows: [[no wan] sanni] and [[no wan] zomma]. This interpretation can be supported by the fact that the combination no wan is also attested without any noun, as in (131a), or with other nouns, as in (131b):

(131)

a. no wan habbi hatti fo open wan moffe. no one have heart for open INDEF mouth Arends (1995b: 203): ‘Nobody will dare say a thing.’ Van Dyk (c1765: 82): ‘Geen een durft zyn Mond oopen doen.’

326

b. no wan hai watra dea NEG INDEF drop water there ‘There is no drop of water here.’ Schumann (1783: 56): ‘Es ist kein Tropfen Wasser hier.’
On the other hand, it is possible to interpret items in (130b) as consisting of the negation marker no and the indefinite pronouns wan sanni ‘something’ and wan zomma ‘someone’ which have been discussed in the previous section. Then the bracketing would be: [no [wansanni]] and [no [wan zomma]]. Support for this position can be found in the fact that in Schumann, for instance, wansanni is written together only when its meaning is ‘something’ and when it functions as the indefinite pronoun. Besides, Schumann cites no wansanni under the entry for wansanni. Remarkably, in Van Dyk the item no wan zanti is attested only once, and in most cases the notion ‘nothing’ is rendered by sentences where the indefinite pronoun wan zanti occurs with the negated predicate, as in (132):
(132) mino habi wan zanti fo takki. 1SG-NEG have anything for say Arends (1995b: 176): ‘I’ve got nothing to say.’ Van Dyk (c1765: 57): ‘Dan heb ik ummers niet te zeggen.’
Another clue in this direction comes from the substratum language Ewe, which, according to Schlegel (1856: 94), does not have any negative pronouns, but uses indefinite pronouns with sentence negation instead, as in (133):
(133) a. amade meyi-o somebody go-NEG ‘Nobody goes.’ Schlegel (1856: 94): ‘Jemand geht nicht.’
b. nyemekpo amad∞eke o 1SG see somebody NEG ‘I saw nobody.’ Westermann (1906: 132): ‘Ich sah niemand.’
327

In Westermann (1906: 131-132) the items ‘nobody’ and ‘nothing’ are as follows:

(134) me-amad∞eke ‘NEGM-someone’

‘nobody’

Ewe

naneke-o

‘something-NEGM’

‘nothing’

Ewe

The items amade∞ ke (person-anyone) and naneke (thing-any one) have the same structure, meaning and function, as the Early Sranan wan zomma ‘someone’ and wansanni ‘something’. This allows a conclusion that the Early Sranan negative pronouns in (130b) have been modelled on the corresponding items in Ewe. Interestingly, other substratum languages, such as Kikongo and Fon, also bear a certain similarity to Early Sranan in this respect, since they use the nouns ‘person’ and ‘thing’, as in (135) (examples for Kikongo are from Bentley (1887: 145-146); examples for Fongbe from Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 371)):

(135)

ke vena muntu ko mE$-tı@ ke kuima ko nu-$ tı@

‘NEGM-there is-person-NEGM’ ‘person-nothing/null’ ‘NEGM-thing-NEGM’ ‘thing-nothing/null’

‘nobody’ ‘nobody’ ‘nothing’ ‘nothing’

Kikongo Fon Kikongo Fon

However, the correspondence between the Early Sranan negative pronouns and the Ewe items in (134) is the greatest both from the structural and semantic point of view.
In general the evidence just presented points to the fact that the negative pronouns in (130b) consist of the negator no and the indefinite pronouns wansanni ‘something’ and wan zomma ‘someone’.
The negative pronoun no wansanni is attested in only one sentence in Focke, as in (136a). The negative pronoun no wan zomma is attested in affirmative sentences in Van Dyk and Schumann, but in negative sentences in Focke, as is shown in the examples (136b) to (136d):

(136) a.

‘You should do injustice to nobody.’

Focke (1855: 67): ‘Gij moogt tegen niemand onregtvaardig zijn,

tegen niemand onregt plegen.’

7.6.3. Wh-words

Question words in Early Sranan are created by means of attaching the morpheme hoe/hu/ho31 (< Engl. which, according to Muysken and Smith 1990: 896-897). It is written separately from the morpheme or word it appears with in Van Dyk and Focke, and it is written predominantly together in Schumann. Since the ‘core’ whwords are the same through all the three sources, I have presented only those from Schumann in (137a) for the sake of simplicity.

The morpheme hu- is not attested independently in any of the sources used for the present study, nor is it attested independently in any other earlier sources, such as Herlein (1718), or Nepveu (1770). It thus must be regarded as bound. However, the question arises why hu- is non-existent in Early Sranan as a free morpheme with the meaning similar e.g. to the English interrogative pronoun/determiner which. Bruyn (1995a: 149) argues that the existence of bimorphemic forms in the substratum languages of Sranan might have been a factor for the loss of the English monomorphemic wh-words and non-occurrence of hu as an independent wh-word. That Bruyn’s hypothesis goes in the correct direction can be evidenced by the data on the wh-system of Fongbe presented in Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 72-74). The majority of Fongbe wh-forms (both wh-words and whphrases33) contain the morpheme -tE@ meaning ‘which’, however, there is no whword ‘which’ in Fongbe that would consist of this morpheme only. The situation in Early Sranan then seems to parallel that of Fongbe: there is a morpheme by which wh-forms as in (137) can be produced, but this morpheme does not occur on its own. This hypothesis calls forth another assumption: even if we assume that some question morpheme was retained from English at very early stages (see Bruyn 1995a: 149 for discussion) the parallel to wh-system of Fongbe might make it clear why it was replaced by the bimorphemic forms: because the corresponding substratum morpheme occurs as a part of complex entities only.

32 Menni, however, does not occur on its own in Early Sranan, but in combinations with other morphemes, such as hu, so, morro, etc. (cf. Bruyn 1995a: 151). 33 Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 72-73) distinguish between wh-words which are morphological objects that function as syntactic atoms, i.e. their component morphemes cannot be separated by another morpheme or word, and wh-phrases which are formed by syntactic rules and can be separated, e.g. by an adjective.
330

As it can be inferred from (137), hu- can attach to a wide range of syntactic categories, such as concrete nouns, e.g. bakkera ‘white person’, abstract nouns, e.g. sóortoe ‘kind’, adjectives, e.g. biggi ‘big’, adverbs, e.g. lati ‘late’, and pronouns, such as dissi ‘that/this’.
The meaning of the morpheme hu- can be interpreted as ‘which/what’ in most cases in (137), except for hulanga, hulati and humenni where it is ‘how’. In all examples in (137) the element hu- functions as an interrogative marker rendering an interrogative meaning to the second elements it occurs with. It must be stressed, however, that the process of attaching hu- does not result in the creation of a new notion, as is usually the case in word-formation. Rather, husignals that the word it attaches to acquires another function, that of being interrogative.
In the Early Sranan data, two different types of hu-items are attested. Those in (137a) correspond to monomorphemic wh-words in English. Items in (137b) correspond to English wh-phrases and are regular, productive and fully transparent which is characteristic of syntax rather than word-formation. This consideration raises the question of the nature of the morpheme hu- and the morphosyntactic nature of the items in (137b) in contrast to those in (137a). In what follows I will discuss several observations that can clarify this matter.
The first difference lies in the fact that wh-items in (137a) are often attested in a phonologically contracted form, which is never the case for those in (137b). Several wh-items in (137a) are attested in both full and contracted forms, as it is shown in (138):

Phonological erosion often accompanies the process by which a lexical unit acquires grammatical function (Hopper and Traugott 1993: 147). In the case of Early Sranan wh-items in (137a), phonological erosion can be regarded as an indication of their morphological status.
The second difference between (137a) and (137b) lies in semantics. The meaning of wh-items in (137a) is more general since nouns used in them, ‘place’, ‘manner’, ‘time’, are generic in nature. To demonstrate the point, I will provide two examples from Van Dyk:

(139)

a. Hoe zanti joe wandi. QM thing 2SG want Arends (1995b: 123): ‘What do you want?’ Van Dyk (c1765: 20): ‘Wat will je hebben.’
b. Hoe nuwsi joe habbi. QM news 2SG have ‘What news do you have?’ Arends (1995b: 142): ‘What’s new?’ Van Dyk (c1765: 32): ‘Wat nieuws heb je.’

The meaning of hoe zanti in (139a) is ‘what’, and not ‘which thing’, whereas the meaning of hoe nuwsi is more specific. In a similar way, it can be argued that the meaning of hufasi/hoe fa(s(s)i) ‘how’ is more general than the meaning of hulanga ‘how long’ or hulati ‘how late’, the meaning of husomma ‘who’ is more general than hoe bakkera ‘which white person’, and hoe klossi ‘which cloth’ is more concrete than husanni ‘what’. Additionally, some wh-items in (137a) acquired more opaque meanings, such as hoe fa(s)si, which can also mean ‘why’, as is shown in (140):

(140)

hoe fassi joe pieki da koffi zoo haffe QM manner 2SG pick DEF coffee so half Arends (1995b: 178): ‘Why do you pick the coffee so poorly?’ Van Dyk (c1765: 59): ‘hoe komt dat je de Koffi zoo ongelyk plukt...’

332

Besides, in some cases the two types of hu-combinations diverge as to their referential scope: in the two examples below the combination hoe zomma ‘who’ has indefinite reference, i.e. does not imply that a choice is made from a limited number of alternatives. In contrast, the combination hoe passi has a definite reference, i.e. the choice here is made from a limited set of alternatives which exist in the context and are known to the interlocutors:

(141)

a. Hoe zomma dé.

– Da mi.

QM person be-there it-be 1SG

Arends (1995b: 123): ‘Who’s there?’ – ‘That’s me’

Van Dyk (c1765: 20): ‘Wie is dat. – Dat ben ik.’

b. Hoe passi wi za wakki. – Myki wi wake na watere mili passi.

QM route 1PL FUT walk make 1PL walk on water mill route

Arends (1995b: 140): ‘Which route shall we take? – ‘Let’s go through

Water-Mill-Street.’

Van Dyk (c1765: 30-31): ‘Wat Weg zullen wy gaan. – Laaten wy de

Waater-Moolen-Straat op gaan.’

We can thus conclude that wh-items in (137a) differ from those in (137b) in their ability to undergo phonological erosion and in their more general meaning. All in all, it is indicative of the fact that hu-combinations in (137a) fulfil a function similar to interrogative pronouns in English and are morphological entities.
The discussion above supports the major theoretical assumption behind the present investigation: that their no principled structural difference between syntactic and morphological constructions, but there is a difference in the properties some given constructions may have. The explanation why there are two different types of hu-combinations in Early Sranan does not lie in the fact that some of them have been generated in syntax whereas others by morphological rules. Rather, the two differ in their properties and in their functions.
The origin of the wh-words in Early Sranan, as in many other creole languages, is a matter of debate. On the one hand, their development is argued to follow the universals of language acquisition, such as semantic transparency. On the other hand, there are also strong similarities between the creole and the substratum wh-system. Thus, Muysken and Smith (1990: 895) view the system of
333

Sranan question words as highly transparent since the wh-words can be analysed into a wh-marker and an element indicating what is questioned. They argue that since there are also parallels to the substratum languages, and since the whsystems of some substratum languages, such as Fongbe, are also transparent, it is difficult to distinguish between the tendency for semantic transparency and relexification of corresponding substratum items as influencing factors in the development of wh-words. Bruyn (1995a: 149) stresses that substratum influence cannot be excluded for the development of bi-morphemic question words.
Indeed, whereas Kikongo has a non-transparent wh-words system where most forms are simplexes (Muysken and Smith 1990: 891), the Gbe languages have wh-words that are rather similar to those in Early Sranan. A comparison between the Gbe and the Early Sranan wh-words is drawn in (142). For the sake of greater clarity, in (142a) Early Sranan wh-words are listed with equivalents from Ewe, and in (142b) they are listed once more with equivalents from Fon. Examples for Fon are taken from Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 72-74), examples for Ewe from Schlegel (1856: 93) and Westermann (1905; 1906).

There are both striking correspondences and differences between the Early Sranan wh-system and those of Ewe and Fon. Though the Early Sranan wh-system is not the exact copy of either the Fon or the Ewe system, there are many similarities between individual items. Thus, Early Sranan items for ‘when’, ‘who’, ‘what’, ‘where’ and ‘how’ have direct equivalents in either Fon, or Ewe, or both. Besides, both Early Sranan and Ewe have two similar items for rendering the concept ‘where’: by combining the question marker and the noun for ‘place’, and by combining the question marker and the noun for ‘side’. Finally, there is a very close similarity between the two Sranan items for ‘why’ va huheddi (for-QMhead/reason) and va husanni heddi (for-what(QM-thing)-head/reason) and the Ewe tsie ta (QM-head) and nu-ka ta (what(thing-QM)-head): their structure is exactly the same in both languages, and both use the item meaning ‘head’ to render the meaning ‘why’. The only difference between the two languages with respect to these items consists in Sranan’s use of the preposition va ‘for’. Because of this evident parallel, it makes sense to argue that in the case of the item ‘why’ we deal with transfer of the equivalent Ewe items.
As to the discrepancies, one of them lies in the fact that where Fon or Ewe have several items to express the same meaning, as e.g. in the case of the Fon ‘why’ or ‘what’, Early Sranan has one item only, and it is the most transparent
34 Muysken and Smith (1990: 890), following Segurola (1963) and Rassinoux (1974), translate gbç$n as ‘by’. However, Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 312-313) argue that it is the verb meaning ‘happen’. 35 Muysken and Smith (1990: 890), citing Segurola (1963) and Rassinoux (1974), translate the Fon (w)u@tu@ as ‘body’.

335

one. Another discrepancy is that whereas Fon, for instance, has simplex or semitransparent wh-items, such as an$ í ‘what’ or nE@gbç$n ‘how’ where the element nE@ is a contraction of nǔ tE@ (thing-which) ‘what’, Early Sranan wh-forms are consistently bi-morphemic and transparent.
As a conclusion, it can be suggested that both substratum and the universal factors, such as semantic transparency, played a role in the emergence of the whsystem in Early Sranan. The problem pointed out by Muysken and Smith (1990: 900) about the difficulty to distinguish between semantic transparency and relexification from the substratum source in the emergence of the creole whsystem can be solved if semantic transparency and relexification are not regarded as contradictory, but as interconnected processes. In general, the view integrating transfer and universals is not a new idea, and it is gaining more and more ground in creole investigations. Thus, Mufwene (1991: 137) argues that creoles inherit their morphosyntactic features from some of the languages in contact and universals of SLA act as “regulatory principles” that determine which of the features of these languages will end up in the creole. Markedness values act as one of such central regulatory principles, and it has often been pointed out that in many cases, it is the less marked or the unmarked structures that are more likely to be transferred (Hyltenstam 1987; Kellerman 1987). Applying this to the Early Sranan wh-system, we can suggest, that transfer of substratum wh-words into Early Sranan was constrained by the factor of semantic transparency.
7.7. Conclusion
In the present chapter, major word-formation processes in Early Sranan have been discussed. The large variety of different word-formation patterns in Early Sranan renders untenable any claims about the poverty and marginality of morphology in creoles. The complete loss of the lexifier’s derivational morphemes, transfer of patterns and items from substratum languages, such as Fon, Ewe, Kikongo and Twi, and creation of innovations are the major mechanisms that played a crucial role in the emergence of Early Sranan word-formation. Transfer was in some
336

cases accompanied by reduction and simplification of patterns, and influenced by universals of language acquisition, such as saliency or semantic transparency. In general, the discussions throughout this chapter show that the emergence of Early Sranan word-formation was a complex process that cannot be explained in terms of relexification or simplification only.

8. Reduplication in Early Sranan
8.1. Introduction
Reduplication is asserted to be a much more common type of word-formation among the languages of the world than different types of affixation (Bauer 1988: 25; see also Moravcsik 1978 for an overview of reduplication types in the languages of the world). Reduplication is also claimed to be a mechanism favoured by creoles (Holm 2000: 121; Huttar and Huttar 1997: 395, see also Sebba 1981 for brief discussion). The present chapter assesses the latter claim for Early Sranan, and provides an overview of reduplication processes, as well as an analysis of structural and semantic properties of reduplicated items in this language.
One of the highly debated issues in descriptions of reduplication in creoles is the issue of its origin. More specifically, the question that is raised by many is to which extent, if at all, substratum influence can be made responsible for the emergence of reduplication in creoles (see different contributions to the volume by Kouwenberg 2003). Thus, Boretzky (1983: 83) notes that although many African languages make use of reduplication as a word-formation strategy, the inventory of reduplication patterns creoles use is not necessarily the copy of what can be encountered in the substratum languages. On a similar note, Bakker (1987: 36) remarks that since many African languages use reduplication it is impossible to make any firm conclusions about the substratum influence in this sphere. Jones (1990: 121) notes that universals of language acquisition, universals of pidginisation and creolisation, as well as substratum influence may account for the origin of reduplicated constructions in creoles. More recently, Kouwenberg and LaCharité (2003: 12) advanced a “credibility hierarchy” for substratist claims in respect to reduplication processes. They argue that the more unmarked and transparent a reduplication type is, the less credible the claims about the substratum influence are. For instance, reduplication processes that involve full copying of the morphemes and iconic meaning (i.e. ‘more of the same content in
338

more of the same form’ (Kouwenberg and LaCharitè 2003: 8)), most probably develop independently of any substratum influence. Taking this debate into consideration, a special focus in the present chapter will be on tracing parallels to the substratum and evaluating the probability of substratum influence. The “credibility hierarchy” of Kouwenberg and LaCharitè (2003) will be used in the present analysis to assess the probability of the substratum influence for different types of reduplication in Early Sranan.
A final note that has to be made here concerns the definition of the term ‘reduplication’ and the ways this notion will be defined and treated in this chapter.
First, this notion should be distinguished from the notion ‘iteration’. As Hutter and Hutter (1997: 395) argue, reduplication is a repetition of all or part of the word resulting in a phonological word with a certain pitch and stress pattern. Iteration is usually regarded as a stylistic feature, “the mere repetition of a formative, a word or phrase, essentially for emphasis” (Jones 1990: 119) by which each word preserves its phonological characteristics (Hutter and Hutter 1997: 395396). Since the phonological aspects of reduplication in Early Sranan cannot be taken into consideration here due to the lack of necessary information on stress, tone and intonation in the sources, the distinction between reduplications and iterations cannot be made in the present study. Besides, I assume that iterations can hardly be encountered in the early sources at hand in the same or comparable degree as reduplications because iterations are a feature of natural discourse, and since the two of the three sources used for the present study are dictionaries, they, by virtue of their nature, do not contain large portions of such discourse. Therefore, all complex items consisting of two identical bases or (in very few cases) of parts of the base attested in the early sources are treated as cases of reduplication in the present investigation.
Second, since reduplication can be regarded either as a kind of compounding (especially when the entire base is reduplicated) or as a type of affixation (especially when parts of the word which are repeated are added postor prepositionally to the base) (Bauer 1988: 25, cf. Katamba 1993: 180), it should be clarified which of the two ways will be preferred hereafter. Since full reduplications make up the overwhelming majority of reduplication cases in Early Sranan, and since no strict border is assumed between affixation and compounding in the present study, this controversy is largely irrelevant here. I
339

will refer to the process of copying a base with a specific semantic effect as reduplication throughout the present analysis.

8.2. Nominalising reduplication

A number of nouns attested in Early Sranan are produced by reduplication from verbal bases which occur as free morphemes. Two nouns are reduplications of items that are attested as adjectives. (1) is the exhaustive list of such nouns attested in the three sources:

All examples in (1) are cases of category-changing, lexical reduplication that creates a word with a new derivational, and not grammatical meaning. Almost all forms in (1) are full reduplications. The example sibisibi meaning ‘broom’ is attested in the partial form sisibi in Schumann (1783: 155) and Focke (1855: 116). Focke remarks that sisíbi is the contracted form of sibi-síbi. It means that the form sisíbi is not a partial reduplication, but a shortening of the original form, possibly caused by frequent use.

340

Although almost all examples in (1) are built according to the same structural pattern: [RED-V]N, they differ considerably in their semantic properties. The noun in (1a) denotes an act or a process, the nouns in (1b) denote results or causes of the actions expressed by the respective base verb, those in (1c) are nouns expressing abstract notions. The items in (1d) name instruments with which actions denoted by the base verbs can be carried out, and finally, items in (1e) are metaphoric creations denoting an animal and a plant. Several of the constructs in (1), such as tjarritjarri ‘ring for carrying baskets’, groen-gróen ‘moss’ are semitransparent in that the relation between the derived, reduplicated form, and the simple verb form is not straightforward.
All patterns exemplified in (1) are unproductive in Early Sranan. Although Schumann contains more deverbal reduplicated nouns than Van Dyk, where only 5 of such nouns are attested, this cannot be taken as an indication of the productivity of this pattern, since Schumann in general contains more types. In Focke, which is the latest source for Early Sranan used for the present investigation, only two new reduplications of this type are attested in comparison to Schumann. Actions and results are more commonly expressed in Early Sranan by nouns in V-N multifunctional sets, as e.g. platì ‘to separate/separation’, preki ‘to preach/sermon’, sheki ‘to shake/shaking’. Multifunctional sets containing instrumental nouns are, in contrast, less common: sa ‘to saw/saw’.
Nominalising reduplication is also attested in other creole languages, such as Jamaican (Kouwenberg, LaCharité and Gooden 2003: 108), Krio (Nylander 2003: 133), and Saramaccan (Bakker 2003b). It is remarkable that in Saramaccan, the instrumental pattern is unproductive, similarly to Early Sranan. In Jamaican, which exhibits nearly the same semantic patterns as Early Sranan, instrumental, resultative, etc., nominalising reduplications are unproductive as well (Kouwenberg, LaCharité and Gooden 2003: 108). One might assume in this respect that non-productive nominalising reduplication in creoles might have been productive diachronically, and became unproductive with time. However, since the data used here come from the early stages of creolisation, and since they show that there were rather few formations of this type, we can conclude that nominalising reduplication was unproductive from the very beginning in Early Sranan. This confirms Parkvall’s (2003: 26) idea that idyosyncratic reduplication
341

attested in some languages was not necessarily productive some time in their history.
The issue to be addressed next is how nominalising reduplication might have developed in Early Sranan. Reduplications of verbs to express nominal concepts are definitely not a feature of English word-formation. However, they are common in the West African languages, such as Ewe, Fon, Yoruba, Wolof and Kikongo (Parkvall 2003: 26), which makes substratum influence possible. Besides, since nominalising reduplication is characterised by semantic inconsistency, idiosyncracy and unproductivity, i.e. features typical of non-iconic reduplication (Kouwenberg and LaCharité 2003: 8; 11), the substratum claims are highly credible on the credibility hierarchy by Kouwenberg and LaCharité (2003: 12). However, Parkvall (2003: 26) mentions that it is not certain that the substratum influence is responsible for the existence of verb reduplications resulting in nouns and adverbs in creole languages since this type of reduplication seems to be “more common globally” than, e.g. reduplication of verbs resulting in adjectives, and is attested in other languages of the world, especially Asian languages. To test both suggestions, let us take a closer look at the data from the substratum languages.
In Fongbe, reduplication is used to create nouns denoting actions and results of the actions denoted by the verb (Lefebvre 1998: 319; Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 196; 207-215). In Ewe, nouns created by full and partial reduplication of verbs and denoting results and actions are wide-spread (Schlegel 1856: 22-23). Kikongo verbs can be reduplicated to create nouns with abstract meanings (Laman 1912: 243). The data from the substratum languages are presented in (2):

342

In general, it becomes clear that some types of nominalising reduplication, e.g. those expressing the result of an action or an abstract process, are attested both in the substratum languages and in Early Sranan. Taken the non-iconic, marked nature of nominalising reduplication, we can assume that this type of reduplication entered Early Sranan under substratum influence. However, there is also one type, creation of instrumental nouns, which does not have credible parallels in the major substratum languages: most Early Sranan instrumental nouns from (1) are rendered by non-reduplicated forms in Ewe (Schlegel 1856), Fon (Rassinoux 1987), Kikongo (Bentley 1887) or Twi (Kotey 1998). Kouwenberg and LaCharité (2004: 310) also show, on the basis of an investigation of several Niger-Congo languages, that instrumental nominalising reduplication is not attested in the Gbe and Bantu languages. It is, however, attested in Igbo, a language belonging to the non-Bantoid subgroup of BenueCongo languages (Kouwenberg and LaCharité 2004: 312). Nothing reliable, however, is known about the presence of Igbo-speaking slaves in Suriname, which makes it rather difficult to determine the possibility of transfer from this language. We can thus conclude that either such words present a case for lexical transfer from Igbo, or they developed independently in Early Sranan.
In general, the discussion shows that even if nominalising reduplication expressing results and abstract processes is a residue from the substratum languages, it did not become a productive and common way of creating nouns in the creole language, in contrast to the substratum languages, where it is productive. Instead, as I have mentioned above, nouns expressing abstract notions, as well as results of some actions, are normally created via multifunctionality.
8.3. Resultative (stative) reduplication
There is no special affix to create adjectives in Early Sranan. Indeed, most adjectives appear as members of multifunctional sets (see chapter 6). However, a few are also created through reduplication:
343

(3) brokko-broko ‘broken’

brokko (V) ‘to break’

Sch

bron-brón ‘burnt/very burnt’

bron (V) ‘to burn’

Fo

kottikotti

‘cut into small pieces’

kotti (V) ‘to cut’

Sch

loesoe-lóesoe ‘loosely’

lóesoe (V) ‘to let loose/to release’ Fo

priti-príti

‘torn/split’

príti (V) ‘to tear/to split’

Fo

proi proi

‘full of wrinkles/wrinkled’ proi (V/A) ‘to be wrinkled/wrinkle’ Sch

sa-sâ

‘sharp/sawing’

sâ (V)

‘to saw’

Fo

sakkasakka ‘light’

sakka (V) ‘to lower/to decrease/to Sch

lose weight’

tifi-tífi

‘toothed’

tífi (N)

‘tooth’

Fo

The adjectives in (3) are produced via full reduplication of verbs primarily. One example, tifi-tífi ‘toothed’ is built from a noun. In one case: proi proi ‘wrinkled/full of wrinkles’, it is difficult to establish the lexical category of the base of reduplication since the item proi ‘to be wrinkled/wrinkle’ is multifunctional: it can be a noun and a verb, and the meaning of the respective reduplicated adjective allows two interpretations.
Most of the adjectives in (3) are attested as nominal modifiers, one of them, proi proi, ‘wrinkled’ is attested as a verbal modifier. The examples in (4) demonstrate these two functions:

(4) a. hem fesi kom proi

proi

his face come be wrinkled be wrinkled

‘His face is wrinkled/full of wrinkes.’

Schumann (1783: 142): ‘Sein Gesicht ist voller Runzeln.’ b. Fa Joe kan tjári so bron-brón baäna gi mi?

QW 2SG can carry such burn-burn banana give me?

‘How can you bring me such burnt bananas?’

Focke (1855: 19): ‘Hoe durft gij mij zulke verbrande banannen

brengen?’

However, since many items in Early Sranan are multifunctional, it can be hypothesised that adjectives attested in the attributive function could also occupy the predicative slot and vice versa.
All reduplicated items in (3) are transparent formations and express resultative states associated with the activity denoted by the verb or the noun from which they originate: brokko-broko expresses the state of being broken, tifi-tífi the

344

state of being toothed, etc. In the case of kottikotti ‘cut into small pieces’ a diminutive meaning is added.
It is difficult to make any reliable judgements on how productive resultative reduplication might have been in Early Sranan. Only nine adjectives of the type in question are attested in all the three sources. Most attributive adjectives in Early Sranan are unreduplicated items that are members of A-V, A-V-N, or A-V-Adv multifunctional sets. It can be assumed therefore that the strategy to use multifunctional items in attributive position was more dominant than creating adjectives via reduplication. Remarkably, the same is true for modern Surinamese Creoles, such as Eastern Maroon Creole, Sranan, and Saramaccan, in which usually unreduplicated items are used in attributive functions (Migge 2003b: 65). Why is that so? This leads us to the question of the emergence of the reduplicated items in question.
The origin of resultative adjectival reduplication in Early Sranan cannot be attributed to English since English did not and still does not have reduplicated items of this type. The evidence from the substratum is, in contrast, ample. Parkvall (2003: 26) notes that the formation of adjectives from verbs through reduplication is attested both in the Kwa languages, such as Twi, Kposso, Ewe, and Fon, and in the Benuic languages, such as Bekwarra, Obolo, Yoruba, etc. In (5), several examples from Ewe (Schlegel 1856: 21; Westermann 1907: 67; 127) and Fon (Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 206) are presented to illustrate this fact:

(5) beble

‘betrayed’

ble (V)

‘to betray’

Ewe

d∞ud∞ǔ

‘edible’

‘to crumple’

Fon

Migge (2003b) takes a closer look at this type of reduplication in order to establish the true extent of substratum influence. She (2003b: 62) argues that in Eastern Maroon Creole, Sranan and the Gbe varieties, stative reduplicated items are productively formed from verbs that denote an activity resulting in a “visible or ascertainable state” or from verbs that denote human propensity. Reduplicated

345

adjectives formed in this way in Surinamese Creoles may indicate unusual and resultative states, and are attested in the predicative, postnominal and prenominal position, as is demonstrated with the examples from Eastern Maroon Creole in (6) (examples taken from Migge 2003b: 63-65):

(6) a. resultative state, predicative position A uwii fu mi de lusu-lusu kaba

DET hair POSS 1SG COP loose-loose finish

‘My hair is already (in an) unbraided (state).’

b. resultative state, attributive position: Te i wani da i kon anga lusu-lusu uwii

when 2SG want then 2SG come with loose-loose hair

‘When you are ready (to braid your hair), come by with unbraided

hair.’

c. unusual state: A wagi baka de

opo-opo

DET car back COP open-open

(A group of people is driving along a road. Suddenly one of the passengers notices that the back of the car is wide open. He says to his fellow passengers:)
‘The back of the car is (in an) open (state) (but I don’t know why or

how).’

Although there are striking similarities between Gbe and the Surinamese Creoles in respect to stative adjectival reduplication, Migge (2003b: 65) also shows that in contrast to Gbe, where monosyllabic verbs must always be reduplicated when occupying the attributive position, Eastern Maroon Creole and Sranan usually make use of unreduplicated forms in the prenominal position. For instance, the phrase ‘an old boat’ is rendered by wan gaandi boto ‘one old boat’ and not by *wan gaandi-gaandi boto in Eastern Maroon Creole (Migge 2003b: 65). Besides, whereas attributive reduplicated adjectives in the Gbe varieties can refer to resultative, unusual and inherent states, in Eastern Maroon Creole and Sranan they have the resultative meaning only. As we have seen above, the same is true for Early Sranan, where attributive reduplicated adjectives express resultative states only. However, there is also a discrepancy between modern Surinamese Creoles
346

and Gbe on the one hand, and Early Sranan on the other. Whereas the former use reduplicated adjectives expressing resultative and unusual states also in the predicative position, the data from Early Sranan do not contain reduplicated predicative adjectives.
The correspondences between stative reduplicated items in Gbe and in the Surinames Creoles lead Migge to a suggestion that the emergence of such items in the latter is the result of retention from the substratum. She attributes the difference between prenominal modifying reduplicated adjectives in the Surinamese Creoles and in Gbe to reanalysis and levelling. Migge argues that in the predecessor of the modern Suriname Creoles, ‘Early Suriname Plantation Creole’, both reduplicated and unreduplicated attributive adjectives might have been used because of the diverging evidence in the source languages: whereas in Kikongo and English attributive reduplicated adjectives do not seem to have been used, in the Gbe varieties they were used. The modern creoles then preserved both ways of producing prenominal modifiers: via reduplication and via multifunctionality. The same suggestion is made by Lefebvre (1998: 325-326) for Haitian, which uses exclusively conversion, and not reduplication, for the derivation of attributive adjectives from verbs. As Lefebvre assumes, the reduplicated affix of Fongbe was assigned a null form in Haitian in the process of creolisation.
The evidence from Early Sranan presented above supports Migge’s idea that the existence of attributive resultative reduplications can be assigned to the influence of the Gbe varieties. The credibility of this claim is supported by the fact that adjectival reduplication, as the nominalising reduplication, belongs to the non-iconic type (Kouwenberg and LaCharité 2003: 9). As Kouwenberg and LaCharité (2003: 11) argue, reduplicated adjectives expressing resultative processes trigger a change from event to attribute. This change cannot be inferred straightforwardly from the semantic properties of the identical morphemes. Kouwenberg and LaCharité (2003: 11) conclude that reduplications of this type can be considered semantically more complex than iconic reduplications and therefore marked. In terms of formal simplicity, reduplicated adjectives can also be regarded as more complex than the alternative simplex adjectives. Thus, being non-iconic, more marked, and more complex, resultative reduplication is a good candidate for a transfer from the substratum.
347

However, Migge’s suggestion that reanalysis and levelling might be responsible for the use of both strategies, reduplication and non-reduplication, leaves two questions open. First, it does not explain why, although both strategies are possible, the non-reduplication strategy is definitely the preferred one for attributive adjectives in both the Early Sranan data and in Eastern Maroon Creole, modern Sranan and Saramaccan (Migge 2003b: 65). Second, it is unclear why the unchanged root, and not some affix, became the alternative to adjectival reduplication. Taken the greater markedness and structural complexity of reduplication in comparison to the simple form, it is possible to assume that in the process of dialect levelling, the less marked and more structurally simple option was given preference to.

8.4. Approximative reduplication

Although cases of approximative reduplication are attested in a number of creole languages, including modern Sranan, Eastern Maroon Creole and Saramaccan (Migge 2003b: 65-68; Bakker 2003b: 76), there are very few reduplicated items with approximative meaning attested in the three early sources:

(7) jóngoe-jongoe ‘youngish’

redi-rédi

‘reddish’

siki-síki

‘sickly’

jóngoe (A) rédi (A/V) siki (A/V)

‘young’

Fo

‘red/to be red’ Fo

‘(be) sick’

Fo

Jóngoe is attested as an adjective only, whereas rédi and siki are attested as an adjective and a verb each (Focke 1855: 51; 109; 117). Migge (2003b: 66-68) argues that only verbs that express a gradable property and qualify for denoting intermediate states in a given culture can be the basis for approximative reduplication. The data in (7) support Migge’s assertion.
Remarkably, approximative reduplication is not attested in the Gbe cluster and Kikongo (Migge 2003b: 69). This leads Migge to the assumption that approximative reduplication in Eastern Maroon Creole emerged via reanalysis of a strategy for expressing the progressive aspect which in its turn developed under the influence of the Gbe varieties. Kouwenberg and LaCharité (2004: 316) show a
348

few examples from the Kwa languages, including Twi, for which attributive reduplication can be argued, e.g. the Twi abo-abó (stone-stone) ‘stony’ or nsoensoé (thorns-thorns) ‘thorny’. Besides, they note that several cases allowing approximative interpretation are attested in Kikongo, e.g. nsóngi-nsóngi (pointpoint) ‘pointed’, or nkoyi-nkoyi (leopard-leopard) ‘speckled’. The Kikongo type, however, differs from the approximative reduplication in Early Sranan structurally since it takes nouns as input, and not verbs/adjectives, which again makes the probability of substratum influence unlikely.
Since there are no attestations of this type of reduplication in Van Dyk (c1765) and Schumann (1783), and the only approximative items attested are from Focke (1855), approximative reduplication can be regarded as marginal in Early Sranan word-formation. Possibly, there is a correlation between the nonavailability of this pattern in the major substratum languages and its marginality in the creole.

8.5. Intensifying reduplication
Intensifying reduplication is a rather common type of reduplication attested in many languages of the world (Parkvall 2003: 19), and Early Sranan does not make an exception in this respect, as is evidenced by (8)1:

(8) a.

1 The bases of the reduplicated items in (8a) are multifunctional, and can function as adjectives, verbs, and in several cases also as adverbs and nouns. I have indicated adjectives as the basis for the sake of simplicity and also because the reduplicated items in (8a) are often attested as adjectives, i.e. modifying nouns in NPs.

All items in (8) are cases of full reduplication. Almost all bases of the reduplicated items in (8a) are members of the A-V-(N-Adv) multifunctional sets. Since most reduplications from (8a) are attested as modifiers of nouns or verbs, I assume that either adjectives or adverbs serve as a basis of reduplication in (8a). Other types attested are intensifying reduplications of adverbs, particles or verbs, as in (8b).
Most reduplicated items from (8a) modify nouns, as in (9a), or verbs, as in (9b):

(9) a. Fa joe wéri so wan dótti dotti pângi so? QM 2SG wear such INDEF dirty-dirty dress so ‘Why do you wear such a dirty dress?’ Focke (1855: 26): ‘Hoe hebt gij zulk een vuil paantje aan?’
b. a ben du datti faijafaija 3SG PST do that hot-hot ‘He did this in a very hot-headed manner.’ Schumann (1783: 39): ‘Er ist sehr hitzig.’

All examples in (8) denote that the quality or action expressed by the simplex adjectives, adverbs or verbs appears in an intensified degree. In this sense, they are examples of iconic reduplication since they follow the principle ‘more of the same form stands for more of the same content’ mentioned above. As

2 Although the translations of the reduplicated item srefisrefi ‘oneself/personally’ do not render the intensifying meaning at first sight if compared to the base form srefi ‘self/own’, I have included this item under the ‘intensifying’ category because of Schumann’s (1783: 166) remark that srefisrefi expresses “repeated emphasis”.
350

Kouwenberg and LaCharité (2003: 11) suggest, iconic reduplication of the intensifying type produces semantically transparent items and can therefore be considered unmarked. There are, however, several items whose meaning is not directly inferable from the meaning of the base. For instance, krien has the meaning ‘clean’, but the corresponding reduplicated item means ‘very closely’. Another reduplicated item, tanki tanki, beside the intensified meaning ‘thank you very much’, has also the meaning ‘please’, which is one of the meanings of its unreduplicated base tanki.
Since intensifying reduplication is common cross-linguistically, the question arises where the source of Early Sranan intensifying reduplication might lie. Since many West African languages including the substratum languages of Early Sranan, such as Ewe, Twi, and Kikongo, make use of intensifying reduplication (Parkvall 2003: 20), I will take a closer look at the data from these languages.
In Ewe and Twi, adjectives can be reduplicated to express a high intensity of the quality (Christaller 1875: 48; Westermann 1943: 12) similarly to Early Sranan:

(10) pE@pEEpE ‘absolutely exact(ly)’

Ewe

tátaata

‘absolutely white’

Ewe

dèdédede ‘exceedingly sweet’

Twi

Intensifying reduplication in Kikongo comprises not only adjectives, but also verbs. Reduplicated adjectives express intensified quality, as in (11a) (Laman 1912: 106). Verbs can be reduplicated to express either that the action is carried out as quickly as possible, or that it is carried out as carefully as possible (Laman 1912: 178), as in (11b):

(11) a. b.

ngulu anene nene ‘pig-large-large’

muntu andanda ‘person-tall-tall’

nzo yamona ‘house-new-new’

mona

tunga-tunga

‘build-build’

lamba-lamba ‘cook-cook’

keba-keba

‘keep-keep’

‘a very large pig’ ‘a very tall person’ ‘an entirely new house’
‘to build fast’ ‘to cook quickly’ ‘to keep very carefully’

351

Whereas Kikongo and Early Sranan share the same type of intensifying reduplication for adjectives, this is not the case with verbs: the Kikongo type of reduplication, which denotes quick action, is not attested in Early Sranan. In general, reduplication of verbs with an intensification effect is rather marginal in the creole. Interestingly, the intensifying reduplication of adjectives and adverbs is the most common type cross-linguistically, whereas intensifying reduplication of verbs seems to be less common (Parkvall 2003: 19). If we assume transfer from the substratum sources, we must admit that only the most common type of intensifying reduplication was transferred.
In conclusion, the substratum evidence shows that transfer cannot be excluded for the emergence of intensifying reduplication in Early Sranan. However, intensifying reduplication is a rather wide-spread type among the languages of the world, both creole (including all Atlantic creoles) and non-creole (Parkvall 2003: 19-20). This means that although substratum influence cannot be excluded altogether, it can also be argued that intensifying reduplication might be a universal feature of creole languages. Since intensifying reduplication is iconic and unmarked (Kouwenberg and LaCharité 2003: 12), there is a high probability of it emerging independently from substratum influence.

8.6. Iterative reduplication
A small number of items attested in the early sources can be classified as iterative reduplications:

(12) a. píengi-píengi ‘to pinch continuously’

seki-séki

‘to shake repeatedly, again

and again’

wakki-wákki ‘to watch for a long time’

píenngi (V) séki (V)
wákki (V)

b. shekisheki ‘to sway back and forth’

sheki (V)

wakkawakka ‘to go to and fro/to run/to go wakka (V)

around or about’

‘to pinch’

Fo

‘to shake’

Fo

‘to look on/to Fo

take care/to

watch/to wake’

‘to shake’

Sch

‘to walk/to go’ Sch

The examples in (12a) are reduplications of verbs that express either continuous actions, as in (13a), or lengthy actions, as in (13b), or repeated actions, as in (13c).

352

Here the temporal aspect, i.e. the length or repetition of the action in time, is crucial:

(13) a. joe moe’ píengi-píengi hemm, nóso a no de go kísi

2SG must pinch-pinch 3SG, otherwise 3SG NEG CTN go catch

‘You must pinch him continuously, otherwise he is not sufficient.’

Focke (1855: 100): ‘Gij dient er zuinig mede te werk te gaan, anders zal

het niet toereikend zijn.’ b. A wakki-wákki so tê, – di a

no si no wan soema,

3SG watch-watch so till then 3SG NEG see NEG INDEF person,

a lon go we.

3SG run go-away

‘He was watching secretly for a long time, when he saw nobody, he ran

away.’

Focke (1855: 146): ‘Hij heeft lang liggen loeren, toen hij niemand zag, is

hij weggeloopen.’ c. Mófo seki-séki, ódo

komópo.

mouth move-move, proverb come-out

‘When the mouth moves repeatedly, sneers see the daylight.’

Focke (1855: 115): ‘Wanneer de mond zich veel beweegt (d.i. wanneer

het gesprek levendig, warm, driftig wordt) komen er kernspreuken of

schampere zetten voor den dag.’

The examples in (12b) can also be viewed as expressing repeated actions. However, here not the temporal, but rather the spatial aspect is crucial since the action is a repeated movement in space from one point to another:
(14) da boto de shekisheki DEF boat CTN sway-sway ‘The boat is swaying back and forth.’ Schumann (1783: 153): ‘Das Boot schwanckt, wackelt sehr hin und her.’

The spatial aspect makes the examples in (12b) similar to instances of distributive reduplication. Indeed, the distinction between iterative and distributive
353

reduplication is not always straightforward and can, as Huber (2003) suggests for Ghanaian Pidgin English, be better modeled as a continuum. For the sake of simplicity, I will regard the two examples in (12b) as cases of iterative reduplication because of their repetitive character.
Iterative reduplication is attested in a number of creole languages, such as Jamaican, Saramaccan, Ndjuka, Krio, Papiamentu, and Berbice Dutch, and is also common cross-linguistically (Parkvall 2003: 21). This leads Parkvall (2003: 21) to assume that substrate influence in the case of iterative reduplication in Atlantic creoles “cannot be taken for granted’. To test this claim, I will investigate the substratum data.
Interestingly, the data show that iterative reduplication is not as widespread in the substratum languages of Early Sranan, as, for instance, intensifying reduplication.
Thus, in Kikongo, repetitive, frequentative or lengthy actions are expressed by means of different affixes, and not by reduplication (Laman 1912: 208-211). For instance, the Kikongo correspondence to the Early Sranan wakkawakka ‘to go to and fro’, viong-uluka ‘to go hither and thither/to be crooked, winding’, is built from the verb viongula ‘to stir about’ by means of the suffix -uluka (Laman 1912: 208).
Evidence for the presence of iterative reduplication in Ewe is controversial. Westermann (1943: 11) notes that expressing repetitive actions is one of the functions of reduplication in Ewe. However, he gives only one example, which he translates into German by means of the present participle so that the iterative nature of this example remains unclear: toη toη toη ‘dripping’ (Germ. tropfend). Schlegel (1856: 22) also notes that reduplication in Ewe functions to denote frequentative, repetitive actions. Although he gives examples, their repetitive character does not become evident. Besides, the semantic relation between the base and the reduplicated item is not always straightforward:

(15) bobo
tutu
kókó

‘to humble oneself’ ‘to rub off’ ‘to stutter’

bo

‘to bend’

tu

‘to rub’

kó

‘to be high’3

3 The link between the meaning of the simple base kó meaning ‘to be high’ and the reduplicated item kókó meaning ‘to stutter’ is that the stutterer speaks in a high tone (Schlegel 1856: 21).
354

It seems that Schlegel views reduplication in (15) as expressing frequentative actions because the semantics of such items as ‘to stutter’ or ‘rub off’ already presupposes an action that either happens repeatedly: the process of stuttering is a lengthy process, the same is true about the process of rubbing off. Therefore, the genuine sense of iterative reduplication, i.e. showing that an action is repeated, frequent or lengthy, is not present in the examples in (15). It is therefore difficult to say whether reduplication is regularly used to render iterative meanings in Ewe. A single repetition of an action is expressed in Ewe by inserting the morpheme ga which originates from the verb gba ‘turn back/come back’ between the verb and the pronoun, as in me-ga-gi ‘I went again.’ (Westermann 1907: 73; 67).
There is, however, evidence that Twi makes use of iterative reduplication (Christaller 1875: 64; also Huber 2003: 149; Westermann 1943: 11). Iterative reduplication denotes a repeated process:

(16) tẽetẽem’ ‘to cry out (repeatedly)’

tẽem’ ‘to cry out’

Twi

bobo

‘to knock repeatedly’

bo

‘to beat/to break’

Twi

Although reduplicated items expressing a repeated process are also attested in Early Sranan, the range of iterative reduplication demonstrated in (12) is bigger than in Twi. Besides, although Twi speakers were numerous in Suriname after 1920 (Arends 1995a), Twi was not the major substratum language of Early Sranan from the very beginning. Therefore, it is arguable in how far it might have influenced Sranan in respect to this type of reduplication.
In view of the evidence presented here, it can be concluded that most likely, iterative reduplication emerged independently in Early Sranan. Additional support for this hypothesis comes from the fact that iterative reduplication is iconic, and thus unmarked and semantically transparent.

8.7. Distributive reduplication
Another type of reduplication amply attested in Early Sranan is distributive reduplication which chiefly indicates either distribution of an action over a certain space or the way in which certain objects are grouped:
355

(17)

a. bussu bussu
drie-drie hipi hipi pisi-pisi tóe-toe tu tu
b. horro-horro

‘gradually/little by little’

pikíen (Adv) ‘a little’ Fo

‘little by little/gradually’

safri (A/Adv) ‘soft/mild/ Sch quiet’

Although all items in (17) can be regarded as expressing distribution, there are several semantic and structural differences between them. Structurally, the examples in (17) present a rather heterogeneous group: they have been created from numerals, nouns, adverbs, and verbs. Numerals and quantifying nouns are the most common bases for distributive reduplication.
In general, reduplications in (17) indicate the distributive character of an action. There are, however, slight differences in the ways by which they express distribution. Examples in (17a), for instance, render the sense of grouping and indicate the way by which objects or agents expressed by the subject or the object are grouped, as is shown in (18):

(18) a. dem tai datti na bussu bussu 3PL tie that on bundle-bundle ‘They tie that in bundles.’ Schumann (1783: 26): ‘Sie binden das in Bündel, bündelweise zusammen.’
b. demm de wákka drie-drie 3PL CNT walk three-three ‘They walk in threes.’ Focke (1855: 27): ‘Zij gaan met drieën, of drie aan drie.’

356

Interestingly, beside the distributive meaning, the plural meaning is automatically added to numerals and nouns rendering the ‘grouping’ meaning: Thus, bussu bussu ‘in bundles’ does not only mean that the object has been grouped into bundles, but also that there are several bundles available. Besides, the item pisipisi also bears a diminutive meaning: ‘in separate small pieces’ (Schumann 1783: 88).
The examples in (17b), horro-horro and koendóe-koendóe, also combine distributive and plural meanings. In contrast to the items in (17a), however, they indicate the distribution of some object (bumps, holes) over a fixed space. Besides, they also indicate, similarly to the examples in (17a), that a given object is distributed in great numbers:
(19) a. dasanni habi horro-horro DEF-thing have hole-hole ‘It has holes all over, it is full of holes.’ Schumann (1783: 67): ‘Das ist ganz durchlöchert.’
b. a hábi koendóe-koendóe 3SG have bump-bump ‘He has bumps all over.’ Focke (1855: 59): ‘Het is met knobbels bezet.’
The only verb with distributive meaning is fíli-fili ‘to feel, to grope around’. It shows that the action is distributed over a certain space:
(20) Fíli-fili, effi joe kan fínni hem feel-feel if 2SG can find it ‘Feel around, whether you can find it.’ Focke (1855: 32): ‘Tast eens rond, en zie, of gij het vinden kunt.’
The examples in (17d) indicate in what kind of succession the action expressed by the predicate will take place. This succession can be either spatial, as in (21a), or temporal, as in (21b):
357

(21) a. hem sweti tronn brudu, fadomm na grunn hai hai his sweat turn blood fall-down on ground drop-drop ‘His sweat turned into blood, and fell down to earth drop by drop.’ Schumann (1783: 56): ‘Sein Schweiss ward Blut, u. fiel Tropfenweise auf die Erde.’
b. mi sa pai ju na juru juru 1SG FUT pay 2SG on hour-hour ‘I will pay you by hour.’ Schumann (1783: 76): ‘Ich will dich Stundenweise (nicht Tagweise) bezahlen.’

Reduplications in (17e), such as morromorro ‘more and more’ or pikien-pikíen ‘little by little’, express gradual progression of an action:

(22) mi ben njusudatti

morromorro

1SG PST get used to-that more-more

‘I got used to this more and more.’

Schumann (1783: 115): no translation provided

Since distributive reduplication is wide-spread both among the Atlantic creoles and many West African languages (Parkvall 2003: 22), and is at the same time iconic, the question arises whether its development is independent of or influenced by the substratum. The data on the substratum languages of Early Sranan show that many of them make use of distributive reduplication.
In Kikongo, at least three different types of distributive reduplication are cited in the sources (Bentley 1895: 973-974; Laman 1912: 115; 242): reduplications of nouns expressing the way of object/subject grouping, as in (23a), reduplications of numerals rendering the meaning ‘each/every’, as in (23b), and reduplication of nouns indicating spatial distribution of some object, as in (23c) (examples are taken from Bentley (1887: 605; 948) and Laman (1912: 115; 242)):

358

(23) a.
b. c.

bela-bela e ndambu ndambu e tini tini bole bole zo-zole/zole-zole mangò-mangò matuti-matuti

‘in strips’ ‘in parts’ ‘in pieces’ ‘every two’ ‘two each’ ‘spots all over’ ‘clouds all over’

Several illustrations for the use of Kikongo distributives in context are given in (24):

(24) a. b. c.

Vana bole bole kwanga kwanga Laman (1912: 115): ‘Give to every two a cassava loaf.’ Muntu muntu kanata makumatatumatatu mabimbundi Laman (1912: 115): ‘Let each one carry thirty pieces of cloth.’ Basumba zole zole. Laman (1912: 115): ‘They bought two each.’

There are both similarities and differences between Early Sranan and Kikongo in respect to the structure and meanings expressed by distributive reduplication. In both languages nouns can be reduplicated to express the way of grouping and the distribution of an object over a certain space. However, in contrast to Kikongo, Early Sranan reduplicated numerals do not bear the meaning ‘each/every’. Besides, Early Sranan has one type of distributive reduplication which I did not find in the Kikongo sources: expressing successiveness of an action, such as hai hai ‘drop after drop’.
Ewe also makes use of distributive reduplication of nouns and numerals, with the meanings ‘way of grouping’, ‘each’, and ‘successiveness’ (Ansre 1963; Westermann 1907: 79; 1943: 12):

(25) a.

lã foNfóN lá nám abaabae cut sugercane DEF for-me node-node Ansre (1963: 131): ‘Cut up the sugercane node by node for me.’

359

b. wómá

3PL-divide two-two

Ansre (1963: 131): ‘They have divided in pairs.’ c. Íó wó hámè hámè

Westermann (1928: 66): ‘to place them in groups’

d. wódyç$

tyíwo tyíwo

3PL-collect cowry cowry

‘They collected one from each separate cowry.’

Westermann (1943: 12): ‘Sie sammelten von jedem einzelnen Kauri

3PL-get bread four four ‘They got four bread loaves each.’ Westermann (1943: 12): ‘Sie erhielten jeder vier Brote.’ f. Íeká Íeká

one-one Westermann (1928: 206): ‘one by one’

Again, all types of distributive reduplication in Ewe, except for the ‘each’ type, are attested in Early Sranan. It is noteworthy that Ewe does not seem to have distributives of the type horro-horro ‘holes all over’. Besides, there is a one-toone correspondence between the Sranan tu tu ‘in pairs/in twos’, and the Ewe eveeve ‘in pairs/in twos’.
Finally, distributive reduplication of numerals is attested in Twi as well (Christaller 1875: 53). In (26a), reduplication expresses succession, in (26b) its meaning is ‘each’, and the example (26c) has a direct correspondence in Early Sranan: pikien-pikíen (little-little) ‘little by little’. Again, all types except for the ‘each’ type are attested in Early Sranan.

In general, it can be argued that types of Early Sranan distributive reduplications are similar to those attested in the substratum languages. Besides, there are several one-to-one correspondences between Early Sranan distributive reduplicated items and those from the substratum languages. It can be concluded therefore that although distributive reduplication is iconic, and thus might have developed independently, substratum influence cannot be excluded either. For instance, some of the individual items might have been transferred from the substratum languages. The emergence of distributive reduplication in Early Sranan can be best regarded to be influenced by both the substratum and universal factors.

8.8. Reduplication expressing variety, collectivity and plurality
Apart from items combining distributive and plural meaning discussed in the previous section, there are also a few other cases where reduplication expresses plurality and variety, as in (27a), or plurality and collectivity, as in (27b). The list in (27) is exhaustive:

(27) a. b.

fasi fasi ‘different kinds’

lo lo

‘different classes’

boesi-boési ‘collection of bushes’

fasi (N) ‘manner/kind’

Sch

lo (N)

‘row/line/class’ Sch

bóesi (N) ‘bush’

Fo

361

As it was the case with distributive reduplication above, the plural meaning results from the variety and collectivity meaning. The reduplicated items in (27a) are formed from abstract nouns and their chief function is to indicate that the object expressed by the simplex form appears in a variety:
(28) a. dasanni habi fasi fasi DEF-thing have kind-kind ‘This can be done in different ways.’ Schumann (1783: 40): ‘Das wird auf mehr als einerley Art gemacht, od. das hat verschiedene Arten.’
b. mi go platti une na lo lo 1SG go separate 2PL in class-class ‘I will separate you in different classes.’ Schumann (1783: 102): ‘Ich will euch in verschiedene classen abtheilen.’
Since there are very few reduplicated items of the type under regard, the question about their origin arises. Pluralising reduplication is iconic: it expresses more content with more form, and therefore, we might expect it to be wide-spread among creole languages. However, although it is attested in its ‘pure form’, i.e. rendering the meaning ‘many’ in some creoles, mainly those with Austronesian substrate languages, it is not, according to Parkvall (2003: 24), the “normal way of expressing plurality” in creoles. Besides, Parkvall (2003: 24) argues that it may be more reasonable to apply the labels ‘distributive’ or ‘collective’ to the functions of ‘plural’ reduplication in many languages. As I have shown above, in reduplications in (27), plurality is only the by-product of the meanings ‘variety’ and ‘collectivity’. Such a type of reduplication is not as wide-spread as the ‘pure’ plural type, but it is also documented for Jamaican (Kouwenberg, LaCharité and Gooden 2003: 105) and Ndjuka (Hutter and Hutter 1997: 397-398). It can also be regarded as iconic, since it follows the principle ‘more content in more form’. Therefore, it might have emerged independently of substratum influence. To give this claim more credibility, it makes sense to look for potential parallels to substratum languages.
362

Some substratum languages of Early Sranan do not make use of the reduplication type under analysis: I did not find any evidence for reduplication of nouns expressing variety/collectivity and plurality in either Ewe or Fongbe. For Kikongo, one example that can be related to the Early Sranan cases in (27a) is provided in Laman (1912: 242): mawa mawa ‘of all kinds’. In Twi, the plural forms of nouns can be reduplicated (Christaller 1875: 34), as in (29a). Christaller notes that such reduplications can denote different sorts of a thing, as in (29b). Unfortunately, he does not provide translations for the examples in (29a) so that it is unclear what meaning the reduplicated form has in such cases: whether it can be interpreted as denoting different sorts of an object, as in the (29b) example, or whether it serves a different function. Other sources on Akan (Dolphyne 1988: 136-138) also cite cases of plurality-indicating reduplication. Moreover, Christaller also provides examples as in (29c), where reduplicated nouns combine the meanings of plurality and repetition. The question marks in (29) indicate that the exact translation is unclear since it is not provided by the author.

(29) a. akuwakúw

‘?different sorts of heaps’

afĩafĩ

‘?different sorts of sheaves’

apowapów

‘?different sorts of knots’

b. mmoawa-mmóawa ‘insects and animalcules of all kinds’

c. akõkõ-akõ@kõ@
akotokótów

‘repeated fightings/quarrels’ ‘repeated bows’

okotow

‘heap’ ‘heaps’ ‘sheaf’ ‘sheaves’ ‘knot’ ‘knots’ ‘insect’ ‘insects’ ‘fighting’
‘bowing down’

In general, it can be argued then that among the substratum languages of Early Sranan at least one, Twi, makes use of reduplication to express plurality, and plurality and variety. However, since, as I have already mentioned above, reduplication expressing variety and plurality is iconic, it is difficult to prove the substratum influence in this case.

363

8.9. Reduplications without attested bases
A number of nouns attested in Early Sranan are opaque reduplications, whose base forms do not exist as free morphemes in the creole:

(30) a. boetà-boetà ‘a night bird (Caprimulgus)’

Fo

gobbogobbo ‘small peanuts’

Sch

jen jen

‘clock’

VD

koni koni ‘rabbit’

Sch

mati mati ‘mat’

VD

miti-míti

Fo

VD

wassiwassi ‘wasps’

Sch

b. afoefoè

‘pudding made of cooked and finely mashed bananas’

Fo

atoetóe

‘a dish made by Blacks’

Fo

matoetóe ‘basket made of palm leaves’

Fo

sirrisirra ‘crayfish’

Sch

The majority of the opaque reduplications are full reduplications, although several partial reduplications also occur, as in (30b). In some partial reduplications, as in atoetóe ‘a special dish made by Blacks’, the second syllable is reduplicated, in others, like in sirrisirra ‘crayfish’ one vowel is alternated. Partial reduplications are common in both Fongbe and Ewe (Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 197; Schlegel 1856: 20; Westermann 1943: 10-11). Besides, reduplications of the type afoefoè or atoetóe may be borrowings from the substratum languages: many West African languages make use of the prefix a- (Westermann 1907: 118; cf. Schlegel 1856: 18-19; Christaller 1875: 18; 22), and there are items where this prefix is attested with a reduplicated form, as in (31):

(31) abobo
alélé

‘snail’ ‘rat’

bobo (A) ‘soft’

lé (V)

‘to seize/to hold’

(Westermann 1907: 119) (Schlegel 1856: 171)

Some of the reduplicated bases in (30) are homophonous with words attested independently in Early Sranan. The base koni, for instance, is attested as the noun koni meaning ‘cleverness’. The base toe is also attested as the numeral ‘two’ and the adverb ‘too’ (Van Dyk c1765: 86; 96; 95). The lexeme wassi is a verb meaning ‘to wash’ and a noun, ‘wax’. Other lexemes also have homonyms: sirri is attested as a noun, ‘seed’, mati is a noun meaning ‘friend’ (Schumann 1783:
364

198; 156; 109), and the lexeme míti occurs as the verb with the meaning ‘meet’ (Focke 1855: 82). Sebba (1981: 104) suggests in this respect that such forms might have been reduplicated with the purpose of avoiding homophony. Bakker (2003b: 75) argues for Saramaccan, where the same phenomenon occurs, that many reduplications do not have corresponding simplex forms. Bakker suggests that an iconic explanation, i.e. the ability of reduplication to establish a link between the form and the meaning in the quantitative way, provides a better explanation for such cases. Besides, one can argue that all languages have homonymous items, and many of them (including English) do not employ reduplication as a strategy of avoiding homonymy. The majority of Early Sranan opaque reduplications do not have any corresponding simplex forms, therefore hymonymy avoidance cannot be taken as an explanation for their emergence. Since both opaque and transparent reduplications are abundant in the substratum languages of Early Sranan (Lefebvre and Brousseau 2002: 195; 197; Westermann 1907: 126; 1943: 9-10), we might regard a transfer from the substratum as a potential source of opaque forms: e.g. the reduplicated items might have been transferred from the creators’ native languages without transferring the corresponding simple forms. Another explanation may be that some of the reduplicated forms were already opaque in the substratum languages and entered the creole language as non-transparent forms.
Semantically, non-transparent reduplications express a wide range of notions. Quite a number of such nouns denote animals and plants, as in (32a) and (32b). In this respect Bakker (2003b: 74-75) notes for Saramaccan, where many reduplications without a base form also refer to animals, that such reduplications often describe animals which occur in “flocks, herds or swarms”, or animals to which one does not ascribe individuality. Many of such examples are given in (32):

Some of the reduplicated items denote objects that consist of more than one part, or objects that are collections of (many) separate items, as in (33):

(33) foggofoggo ‘lungs’

Sch

gogo

VD

VD

Several non-transparent reduplications are onomatopoetic, as in (34):

(34) boebóe
gen-gén koffokoffo pupù tikotíko tjóntjon tumtum tutu

‘horror (used to frighten children)/monster/name of an insect’ Fo

Fo

Sch

Sch

‘hiccup’

Fo

‘name of a bird’

Fo

‘mash’

Sch

‘horn’

Sch

As Zimmermann (1987: 411) observes, onomatopoeia is viewed as a transitory stage to lexical acquisition: children, for instance, often imitate what they hear, e.g. brumm-brumm for cars, choo-choo for trains, and adults who try to replace a word also use onomatopoetic formations. Onomatopoetic constructions are also attested at the early stages of pidgins, where they may compensate for the “referential inadequacies” (Mühlhäusler 1983: 56-57). However, it also seems that

366

many human languages, creole and non-creole make use of onomatopoetic words, as the English ding-dong, flip-flop, zig-zag, mish-mash (Koziol 1972: 299). Westermann mentions that West African languages make extensive use of onomatopoeitic formations (cf. also Bakker 2003b: 75-76). Examples he cites for Ewe are baa ‘wide open’, bóo ‘far away’, dãã ‘tight/firm’, bii ‘rotten’, etc. (Westermann 1943: 12-13). Some of the Early Sranan items in (34) have direct correspondences in the substratum languages, as will be shown below. Others, such as gen-gén ‘bell’ do not have any correspondences in Ewe, Twi or Kikongo. Therefore, the emergence of onomatopoetic constructs in Early Sranan is likely to have been influenced by both universals and substratum.
Beside the semantic groups identified above, there are several items that express miscellaneous notions, both concrete and abstract, as in (35):

(35) fufur/furfur

‘to steal’

Sch

jeje

‘spirit’

Sch

kekè

‘spindle’

Sch

kroesoe-króesoe

‘plantation ferry-boat’

Fo

kurrukurru

‘a container for crabs/baskets woven out of cane’

Sch

matta-mátta

‘floor-mat’

Fo

pepé

‘cap’

Fo

tokkotokko

‘marsh/mud/swamp’

Sch

wete-wéte

‘quarrel/disagreement’

Fo

Several items can be regarded as pseudo-reduplications, i.e. words whose reduplicated form is the result of a phonological restructuring of a word adopted from English or Dutch, e.g. kuku (< Dutch koek) ‘cake’, kíki (< English kick) ‘to kick’, or the so-called lull-words (Koziol 1972: 40) such as mámma ‘mother’, papa ‘father’.
The origin of most opaque reduplications in Early Sranan is not clear. Sebba (1981: 103) suggests that the etyma of some words were adapted from the lexifier languages, e.g. the word konikoni is the reduplication of the English obsolete coney, and the word wirriwirri ‘herbs/leaves’ is the reduplication of the English weed. This, however, does not explain why the English words became reduplicated in Early Sranan. Another question is in how far the African languages might have served as a source for such items. Hutter (1985) provides a list of Ndjuka words with their potential African sources from a wide variety of West African languages, especially from Kwa and Bantu. Although the parallels are not always one-to-one, there are certain phonological and structural similarity
367

to the data from the African languages. This implies that African sources must be taken into consideration when the question about the origin of the Early Sranan reduplicated items without attested bases arises. Some of the Ewe examples are from Westermann (1928), Twi examples from Kotey (1998) and Akrofi and Botchey (1980). All the other examples are from Hutter (1985).

‘bamboo/tube/pipe’ ‘foule/multitude’

In general, non-transparent reduplications show that semantic opacity is present in creole languages, contrary to earlier claims, e.g. by Seuren and Wekker (1986: 65), and that borrowing is a viable source of opaque structures, as suggested by Braun and Plag (2003: 99).

8.10. Unclear cases
In several reduplications the relation between the base word and the reduplicated form cannot be classified into one of the categories discussed above because it is either not straightforward or the necessary context is missing. Some of these items are presented in (37):

368

(37) kibrí-kíbri ‘secretly/in secrecy’

kíbri (V)

koli-kóle
koli-kóli
saffoe-sáffoe safri-sâfri

‘Supposed...(used in children’s games)’ ‘to try using soft soap to get smth.’ ‘watery/thin (about food)’ ‘gradually/carefully’

kóli (V)
kóli (V)

Fo

Fo

‘soft/tender’

Fo

‘calmly/calmness/ Fo

slow/gentle/soft’

‘shame’

Fo

‘one’

Sch

The reduplications in (37) make up a very heterogeneous group, structurally, syntactically and semantically. In many cases, it is difficult to establish the lexical category of the reduplicated item because the necessary context is not provided in the sources. The meanings of the reduplicated items are chiefly lexicalised, as in sjémm-sjemm (shame-shame) ‘mimosa’, or saffoe-sáffoe (tender-tender) ‘thin/watery’. In a few cases, however, the relation seems to be more straightforward: for instance, the reduplication of the verb kíbri ‘to keep/to hide’ results in the creation of the adverb kibrí-kíbri ‘secretly’.
It can be supposed, on the basis of the semi-transparent or non-transparent nature of the reduplications in (37), that the items might have been transferred from the substratum. Unfortunately, I have found only two parallels in the substratum sources at hand (Westermann 1907: 128-129):

(38) Early Sranan
wawan
safri-sâfri

‘one-one’
‘slow/gentleslow/gentle’

substratum
d∞ed∞é (Ewe) do∞ d∞ōdo∞ (Ewe)

‘one-one’

‘alone/only’

‘be slow, gentle- ‘slowly/gently/ be slow, gentle’ gradually’

The examples in (38) show that, beside borrowings from the superstratum, transfer from substratum can be a source of opacity or semi-transparency of reduplicated items in Early Sranan.

369

8.11. Conclusion
It has been shown throughout the present chapter that Early Sranan makes abundant use of a wide range of reduplication processes, such as nominalising, predicative, approximative, intensifying, iterative, distributive, expressing variety, etc.
It has also been demonstrated that structurally, the most common type of reduplication in Early Sranan is full reduplication, which stands in contrast to its substratum languages, where partial reduplications are rather numerous. Early Sranan partial reduplications are often semantically semi- or non-transparent.
Another crucial fact about Early Sranan reduplication is that it comprises both non-iconic types, such as nominalising and adjectival (resultative and approximative) reduplication and iconic types, such as intensifying, iterative and distributive. Besides, a considerable number of items are non-transparent reduplications that lack independently attested bases and deliver a source of opacity in the creole. It is remarkable that numerically, items produced by iconic reduplication processes considerably overweigh those produced by non-iconic reduplication in the sources.
One of the central issues raised in the present chapter was the issue of substratum influence in the development of different types of reduplication which is a matter of controversy in creole studies. It is generally argued (Bakker 2003b: 79; Kouwenberg and LaCharité 2003: 12) that substratum influence is most credible for the cases of non-iconic reduplication, because of their markedness and non-transparency. Substratum influence is, on the other hand, less credible, or more difficult to prove for iconic reduplications, taken their unmarked and transparent character. In order to evaluate these claims for Early Sranan, I will present in (39) an overview of reduplication types attested in the creole in comparison to its substratum languages:
370

(39) Early Sranan
nominalising resultative approximative intensifying iterative distributive variety/plurality

Ewe KK Twi iconic good evidence for substratum influence
yes yes no no yes yes – – no yes no no no no no yes yes yes yes no – – yes yes no yes yes yes yes no – – yes yes no

Using the credibility hierarchy by Kouwenberg and LaCharité (2003), we can say that non-iconic types, such as nominalising and resultative reduplication, most likely emerged under the influence of the substratum. For the iconic types, such as intensifying, iterative, distributive, variety/plurality reduplication, the substratum influence should be regarded as less likely since they are unmarked, less complex, and more transparent. Therefore, it is often argued for the iconic types, that they are, or may be the result of an independent development.
Although such a treatment is reasonable and plausible in principle, there are two questions that must be asked in this respect. First, if the emergence of iconic reduplication should be attributed to an independent development, how can we explain the fact that all iconic reduplication types attested in Early Sranan are also attested in at least one of the substratum languages? Why does Early Sranan, for instance, have intensifying and distributive reduplication, just like Kikongo and Ewe, but not the equally iconic plural reduplication of the type *uman-uman meaning ‘women’, which, surprisingly or not, is also absent in both Kikongo and Ewe? Second, if we assume that creoles are instances of second language acquisition, a claim gaining more and more ground in the last decades, then we must ask why German or Russian learners of English do not use iterative, distributive, and intensifying reduplication in their learner varieties, whereas Early Sranan speakers evidently did. Another, related question, is why reduplication is not used in pidgins (Bakker 2003a) which is surprising if we believe in iconic reduplication as something influenced by universals of some kind. One might argue of course that iconic reduplication develops in the expansion stage and is therefore lacking in pidgins. However, even in this case, it has to be explained

371

why the ‘post-basic’ varieties of German or Russian learners of English are never expanded to the degree including intensifying or iterative reduplication.
It seems that to answer these questions, additional arguments for or against substratum influence should be searched for, beside the iconicity/unmarkedness/transparency argument advanced by Kouwenberg and LaCharité (2003).
In the case of Early Sranan, three kinds of arguments can be used for this purpose: the comparison of the overall distribution of patterns in the creole and the substratum, the distribution of the semantic subtypes of the major types of iconic reduplication and the role of a given substratum language in the emergence of the creole language.
As far as the overall distribution of patterns of iconic reduplication in (39) is concerned, we can conclude that intensifying and distributive reduplication are attested in every major substratum language of Early Sranan, whereas iterative reduplication and reduplication expressing variety/plurality are attested only in one substratum language, Twi. This means that substratum influence most likely played a role in the emergence of intensifying and distributive reduplication, and it is much less likely for the iterative reduplication and reduplication expressing variety/plurality.
Let us now turn to the second type of evidence, the distribution of the semantic subtypes of iconic reduplications in Early Sranan and in the substratum languages, which is presented in (40):
372

(40) Early Sranan
intensifying adjectives/adverbs verbs (very rare) distributive grouping distribution all over a certain space succession gradual character of an action – iterative repeated actions lengthy actions continuous actions

Ewe yes
yes yes ‘each’

Kikongo Twi

yes

yes

verbs

yes yes
‘each’

yes yes ‘each’

yes

As it can be inferred from (40), almost all types of intensifying and distributive reduplication attested in Early Sranan, are also attested in the substratum languages. This can hardly be a coincidence, and can be interpreted as a strong evidence in favour of substratum influence. In contrast, the situation is different with iterative reduplication: only one of the three types of reduplication attested in the creole is also attested in the substratum. This is an indication of the fact that substratum influence is less likely in the case of iterative reduplication.
The final argument that can be used is the role of a given substratum language in the emergence of the creole. If a specific iconic type of reduplication is not attested the major substratum languages, but is attested in a substratum language that played a less crucial role in the emergence of a given creole, the credibility of the substratum claims must be assessed as low. Taking again the case of Early Sranan, we can argue that iterative reduplication and reduplication expressing variety and plurality are less reliable candidates for substratum influence because these types are attested in Twi only, which is assessed as a less crucial substratum language of Early Sranan (Arends 1995a).
On the basis of the foregoing discussion, we can develop a modified version of the “credibility hierarchy” advanced by Kouwenberg and LaCharité (2003: 12), which assesses the credibility of substratum claims specifically for iconic reduplication:

373

In general, it can be concluded that whenever the question of the origin of reduplication in creoles in raised, caution should be taken not only in making too vague claims about substratum influence. The same caution must be taken in making too vague claims about universal or independent development of iconic reduplication in creoles. Therefore, a detailed comparison between reduplication types in the creole and in the substratum is necessary, in order to advance more reliable evidence in favour of or against substratum influence.

Several generalisations about the word-formation system of Early Sranan can be made on the basis of (1).
First, all derivational morphemes of the superstratum language disappeared in the process of creole formation. Besides, none of the substratum derivational morphemes was transferred in its original phonological form into the creole.
Second, free morphemes came to be used in Early Sranan in functions such as ‘agentive’, ‘diminutive’, ‘augmentative’, ‘natural gender’, ‘abstract notion’ that are typically expressed by derivational bound morphemes in other languages, including Sranan’s superstratum English and its substratum languages, such as Fongbe, Ewe, Twi and Kikongo.
Third, there is a preference for analytical structures among Early Sranan word-formation patterns: concatenation of at least two free morphemes is the most commonly used strategy of word-formation. The other two amply represented

376

strategies are multifunctionality2 and reduplication. Finally, a less common strategy is that of naming concepts through paraphrasing and circumlocution.
In what follows I will discuss these processes in detail, focusing on the major mechanisms responsible for the emergence of word-formation system of Early Sranan and key strategies used by Sranan creators in the process of moulding their word-formation devices. Since the amount of superstratum and substratum influence in creole genesis is still a matter of controversy (see Winford 2005: 1-2 for an overview), the focus in the present chapter will lie on discussing the range of superstratum and substratum influence on Early Sranan wordformation.
The chapter draws on the main findings about Early Sranan wordformation presented in the preceding chapters. Two major assumptions underlying the discussions in the present chapter will be that socio-historically and linguistically the development of Early Sranan resembles second language acquisition (Arends 2002a: 123; Migge 2003a: 121; Winford 2003: 329; 2005: 25) and that the varieties targeted by creole creators in the formative years were reduced (Arends 1995a; Migge 2003a: 27; Winford 2005: 25). Definitions of universal factors, such as structural complexity, saliency, morphotactic and semantic transparency, etc., provided in chapter 7, section 7.1., will be used in the present chapter as well.
9.2. Disappearance of the superstratum bound morphemes
One of the crucial facts about the word-formation system of Early Sranan emerging from the present investigation is the absence of all superstratum derivational markers. It is difficult to say whether at least some superstratum derivational affixes entered the contact varieties at the initial stages, or when and how they disappeared.
Interestingly, Migge (2003a: 51) suggests that “the members of the plantation establishment must have exposed the new slaves mainly to structurally
2 Although I have shown in chapter 6 that multifunctionality should rather be regarded as underspecification of items in terms of syntactic categories, and not as conversion or zeroderivation, i.e. a morphological process, I will include multifunctionality in the discussion in this chapter as a strategy of expressing different concepts, and thus of expanding lexicon.
377

relatively reduced structures” and that they “probably stripped away all the structural features they considered to be opaque when they communicated with the new slaves”. This suggestion, however, cannot be confirmed in the case of creole derivational morphemes on two major grounds.
First, it is difficult to imagine that the “members of plantation establishment” were able to sort out all derivational affixes, such as -er, -ery, -ness, -dom, -less etc. and to eliminate them on purpose because of their opacity. Second, creators of several other creole languages, as e.g. Haitian and Papiamentu, did acquire superstratum bound derivational morphology which means that no such simplification strategies might have been involved on the part of the speakers of French and Spanish involved in the emergence of these creoles.
It can be suggested that since derivational affixes are in general not very frequent in spoken language (cf. Plag, Dalton-Puffer and Baayen 1999), the superstratum input into creole formation in Suriname did not contain many affixes even during the initial stages when the British settlers were still in the colony. Besides, as Winford (2005: 5) suggests, independently of the fact whether the input to creole formation consisted of close approximations to the lexifier language or a pidginised variety of the lexifier, individual interlanguage construction normally begins with a basic variety which is a “highly reduced, pidgin-like system”. We can assume therefore that even the contact varieties used during the first setting (1652-1679), when the access to the superstratum was not so limited, contained very few derivational affixes or none at all. Winford also suggests that the basic variety system is expanded at the subsequent stages of language acquisition. Since the creole creators did not have much contact with the speakers of English after the withdrawal of the British, they had hardly a possibility to borrow some of the derivational morphology later, at the expansion stage.
The disappearance of the lexifier’s derivational morphemes is not altogether surprising. Reduction and simplification of derivational and inflectional markers has often been cited as characteristic of the initial stages of pidginisation and creolisation (Bickerton 1988: 278; Jones 1995: 121; McWhorter 1998: 798; Mühlhäusler 1997: 142-143) and of SLA (Broeder et al. 1993: 56; Clements 2003; cf. Meisel 1983: 126). Both psycholinguistic and socio-historical factors can be invoked as explanations for this phenomenon.
378

From the psycholinguistic point of view, the disappearance of bound derivational markers is not surprising since unstressed bound morphemes are less perceptually salient (Siegel 1999: 23). Besides, many of the English derivational affixes are not morphotactically transparent since they trigger resyllabification and vowel change. Therefore, it is more difficult for the speakers of other languages to isolate them. Finally, the learners target content morphemes before they start targeting functional morphemes (Clements 2003).
Socio-historically, the dominance of the sugar plantation economy with its limited interaction between members of different social groups during the second, presumably formative period of Early Sranan (1680-1695), led to a limited access to the target varieties and thus might have triggered the disappearance of the bound morphemes (cf. Migge 2003a: 32). Other socio-historical factors, such as the high proportion of new to old slaves and high death rates of Africans on the plantations (Arends 1995a; 2002a) also reduced the access to the target variety and the possibility of its transmission from one social group to another, thus contributing to this process.
Another generalisation emerging from the present investigation is that creole creators also did not directly transfer in their original phonetic form any of the substratum derivational morphemes. This type of transfer is not at all uncommon in creole languages in general. For example, it is amply attested in Berbice Dutch where many morphological markers have been transferred from Eastern Ijo in their original phonetic form, or in Guinea-Bissau Portuguese Creole which makes use of a Manjaku causative suffix (McWhorter 2004: 113). It is unclear under which circumstances this type of borrowing occurs, but it is an indicator of less successful SLA, whereas the survival of the superstratum derivational affixes in Haitian and Papiamentu is a sign of more successful SLA.
379

9.3. Strategies used to express derivational concepts
Disappearance of superstratum derivational morphemes was compensated by employing different strategies to create new words to mark derivational concepts and categories usually expressed by bound morphemes in other languages, including the input languages of Early Sranan. The overview in (2) shows what strategies are used in Early Sranan to express the most frequent nominal derivational categories documented for a sample of 42 different languages from six geographical areas, such as Africa, Eurasia, South East Asia and Oceania, Australia-New Guinea, North America and South America (Bauer 2002: 40). The categories are presented in the decreasing frequency of occurrence.

(2) typologically most frequently attested
derivational categories abstract noun < verb

nominalisers -fasi, -sanni [RED-V]N multifunctionality person marker -man diminutive marker pikíennominalisers -fasi, -sanni multifunctionality – concatenations with sanni (< Engl. something) [RED-V]N multifunctionality

As I have shown in the preceding chapters (especially chapters 5 and 7), Early Sranan uses constructs with specific markers, such as the person marker -man, to express derivational categories, such as ‘agentive’, ‘diminutive’, etc., which are usualy marked by affixes in other languages. Besides, multifunctionality and reduplication are employed for such purposes as well.
There is nothing surprising in the employment of such strategies. Many languages of the world have more than one possibility to render a certain semantic concept. Languages with extensive derivational morphology, such as English, also make use of strategies other than affixation to convey certain semantic concepts. For instance, the concept of diminutivity can be expressed in English, beside the suffixes -ette, -ling and -let, by combinations with the adjective little (see Schneider 2003 for a detailed analysis). The concept ‘result or process of an

380

action’ can be rendered not only by employing the affix -ing, as in writing, but also by multifunctionality, as in to call – a call. Besides, when a derivational concept is not expressed by a specific derivational affix, it can be rendered by free morphemes in such ‘older languages’ as English. Thus, for instance, there is no augmentative affix in English. However, augmentative meaning can be rendered analytically by employing the free morphemes big or huge. Left with no bound derivational morphology from the source languages, Sranan creators employed other strategies.
In general, it can be concluded that compared to English and other ‘older languages’, Early Sranan lacks more elaborate derivational morphology. However, it is erroneous to call Sranan’s system impoverished, since many derivational concepts can be expressed in Early Sranan by strategies other than traditional derivation. Quantitatively the system is more simple, since it uses fewer number of different processes. Interestingly, Dalton-Puffer (1996: 73; 131) lists 16 abstract noun suffixes and 14 agent noun suffixes for English in the period between 1150 and 1420. In contrast, Sranan uses two markers and one reduplication pattern to express abstract concepts and one person marker. However, quantitative comparison is often based on written sources. In spoken language, derivation is not as frequent as in written language (Plag, Dalton-Puffer and Baayen 1999) and therefore, if we compare Sranan’s inventory of markers with English derivational affixes really used in spoken language, the difference might not loom as colossal as it seems to be at first sight. Qualitatively, Sranan’s system of markers equals some of the systems of its substratum languages by being able to express approximately the same range of derivational concepts. This will be shown in more detail in the following sections.
381

9.4. The emergence of Early Sranan markers

9.4.1. The use of free morphemes to mark derivational concepts
As demonstrated in the previous section, the use of specific morphemes to mark derivational concepts is one of the compensatory strategies for the disappearance of bound morphemes from the input languages. It has been shown in the analysis of Early Sranan word-formation that the status of these morphemes is controversial: all of them are attested independently, but they are used serially to express categories commonly rendered by derivational morphemes in other languages and sometimes show a difference in meaning to their free counterparts. I have therefore argued in chapter 5 that they should be assigned a special status in Early Sranan word-formation and be referred to as ‘markers’. In (3) I again present the inventory of Early Sranan markers for the subsequent discussion.

[mammá-N]N

augmentative marker mammá-stoon (AM-stone) ‘huge stone’

[hu-N]wh-word (< Engl. which)

wh-marker

hufasi/hufa (QM-manner) ‘how/why’

All markers in (3) correspond to free content morphemes, mainly of English origin. Thus, the person marker -man has the free correspondence man meaning
382

‘male adult human being’, the diminutive marker pikíen- has the same form as the free morpheme pikíen ‘child/small’, the augmentative marker mammá- has the equivalent free morpheme ‘mother’, etc.
Again, two types of reasons for the use of this strategy can be provided: socio-historical and psycholinguistic. It can be assumed that Early Sranan creators could not properly identify bound derivational morphemes and their corresponding functions in the target varieties because of the limited access to them or because of the already reduced input they got (cf. Migge 2003a: 51). This, in its turn, can be explained by the lesser perceptual saliency and lesser morphotactic transparency of bound morphemes. In contrast, the form, the meaning, and the functions of free content morphemes are easier to identify on the grounds of their greater perceptual salience.
The use of content morphemes to express derivational and inflectional concepts is a phenomenon common for pidginisation/creolisation and for language acquisition in general (cf. Meisel 1983: 126). English inflectional categories, such as ‘past tense’, ‘plural’, ‘progressive’, expressed by bound morphemes are rendered by free content morphemes in Early Sranan and also in Eastern Maroon Creole (Migge 2003a: 41-42). In Melanesian Pidgin all substratum markers, such as subject referencing marker, transitive suffix, preverbal causative marker, etc., are expressed by morphemes that originate from the free morphemes in its lexifier English (Siegel 1999: 24).
The process by which a free content morpheme acquires a grammatical function is generally referred to as grammaticalisation (Heine and Reh 1984: 96; Hopper and Traugott 1993: 2). Another term used in this respect, especially in the context of creole formation, is ‘reanalysis’ (Lefebvre 1998: 41). However, the development of Early Sranan markers is difficult to underpin to one of the two processes.
The problem with the term ‘grammaticalisation’ is, as Bruyn (1995a; 1996) has convincingly shown, that it is commonly used to refer to long-time language-internal drift. However, grammaticalisation in creole languages often takes place within a very short period of time and can be influenced by similar processes in substratum languages. Therefore, Bruyn (1996: 42) suggests that it is reasonable to differentiate between three types of grammaticalisation, such as ‘ordinary’, i.e. language internal diachronic change, ‘instantaneous’, i.e. taking
383

place within a very short time-span, and ‘apparent’, which results from transfer of an item that has already undergone the process of grammaticalisation in another language.
Both aspects, relatively short time-span and substratum influence are also characteristic of the emergence of Early Sranan markers. Thus, all the markers developed during the initial 150 years since they are attested in Schumann (1783) already. For some of them, a rather early point of emergence can be hypothesised: the person marker -man and the augmentative mammá- might have existed at the end of the 17th century, since both are attested in Saramaccan in the same function. Besides, Saramaccan also has quite a number of Sranan man-words which suggests that they might have existed in the lexicon of the slaves before they escaped from the plantations. One can dispute, of course, whether this is a short period for the development of markers (cf. Plag 2002: 239). But even if we assume that it is, and stick the label ‘instantaneous grammaticalisation’ to it, we do not solve other, more crucial problems. In fact, Plag (2002: 239) is right in pointing out that the question about rapidity or gradualness of grammaticalisation is only secondary to the question about the qualitative aspects of grammaticalisation, which I will discuss below.
Some of Sranan’s markers also bear evident and close parallels to those from substratum languages, as it has been shown in chapter 7. For instance, the diminutive marker pikíen- resembles diminutives in Ewe and Fon in both its structural and semantic properties: it has the meanings ‘young’ and ‘small’ as the diminutive and is also attested as the noun ‘child’. One can argue then that the grammaticalisation from the noun denoting ‘child’ to the diminutive suffix that took place in Ewe (Heine, Claudi and Hünnemeyer 1991) gave rise to the fact that pikíen- is not only a content morpheme in Early Sranan, but also the diminutive marker. Using Bruyn’s (1996) terms, we could call this an instance of ‘apparent grammaticalisation’.
However, the problem with applying grammaticalisation as an explanatory mechanism in the case of Early Sranan does not lie in the non-adequacy of conventional labels. Rather, the problem lies in the conceptualisation of grammaticalisation as a directional process which operates on the level of individual morphemes. In the case of Early Sranan, we have to assume, under this scenario, that first, creole creators adopted the morpheme -man from the lexifier,
384

and then started to use it as a person marker. However, this is a gross oversimplification of what actually took place in Early Sranan. As I have shown in the present work, several different processes must have been involved in the emergence of -man as the person marker, e.g. the adoption of some English complex words containing -man, such as headman, countryman, etc., the calquing of substratum words containing person markers by means of -man, and creation of innovations. It seems that transfer of complex words, and not so much of individual morphemes was crucial in the emergence of -man as the person marker. The transferred words provided a model for the creation of new complex words. Therefore, instead of the simplified traditional grammaticalisation chain as in (4), the multidimentional model in (5) better renders the process by which -man developed as the person marker. I do not use a ‘chain’ presentation in (5), since it is difficult to say in which succession the processes operated in Early Sranan, and there is no evidence against the fact that they might have taken place more or less simultaneously:

(4)
free morpheme man: ‘adult human being’

functional morpheme man: person marker

(5) borrowing of associating man- transfer (calquing) of
superstratum compounds with substratum words with man-compounds patterns available in person markers
the source languages employing -man

creation of innovations

the person marker -man
A somewhat different scenario can be advanced for the diminutive marker pikíenor the gender markers man(n)- and uman-, which also show striking parallels to substratum, but for which no superstratum compounds can be assumed as models. Once creole creators identified a superstratum morpheme that was similar in
385

meaning and/or function to corresponding diminutive and gender markers in their native languages, they started using it for transfer from their L1s. The transferred items from the substratum languages then might have been taken as models for innovations. Again, it is rather whole words and patterns that trigger the establishment of the diminutive and gender markers in Early Sranan.
Another problem with applying grammaticalisation as a tool lies in the notion ‘functional morpheme’. As I have shown, the status of Early Sranan markers is controversial between free morphemes and affixes. Although there are sometimes differences in meaning between the markers and their free correspondences, e.g. the person marker -man has the meaning ‘person’ rather than ‘male adult being’, the augmentative mammá- has the meaning ‘huge’, and not ‘mother’. However, pikíen- has the meaning ‘small’ as a diminutive marker and as a free morpheme. Affix-typical phonological erosion, one of the steady signs of grammaticalisation, is not attested with any of the Early Sranan markers. On the one hand, we clearly have cases where certain morphemes are serially employed in one specific function typically fulfilled by derivational morphemes. On the other hand, we have few really firm indices of their affixal status. For such cases, it is unclear whether the term grammaticalisation is suitable at all.
In general, it seems that labels such as ‘grammaticalisation’ blur the true nature of a given phenomenon by ready-made placing it into a specific classificational ‘cell’ of linguistic analysis. To understand the emergence of Early Sranan markers, we should not only take into account what happened to individual morphemes, but also what was contributed by word-formation patterns and complex words with certain morphemes available in the input languages to this process. By simply assigning the term grammaticalisation, even in its more adequate modifications, such as ‘instantaneous’ or ‘apparent’, to the case of Early Sranan markers, we miss insights about the variety and complexity of processes that are involved in creole formation.
We can of course assume that the fault lies in the term ‘grammaticalisation’ and in the definition usually adopted for it. Another term mentioned in relation to the use of content morphemes in specific functions is reanalysis. Reanalysis is defined as “a mental process by which the phonological form of one lexical entry becomes the phonological form of another lexical entry” and is argued to be one of the major processes in creole formation, connected to
386

relexification (Lefebvre 1998: 41; 44). Lefebvre (1998: 44) argues that in creole genesis, speakers of substratum languages copy a functional category lexical entry from their L1 and assign it a phonologically null form because they fail to identify a suitable corresponding superstratum form for this lexical entry. Therefore, creole creators start to employ, or ‘reanalyse’ a major category lexical item as a label for the ‘zero-marked’ functional category entry from the substratum.
There is a general problem with connecting reanalysis to relexification: the problem of zero. As McWhorter (2004: 113-114) rightly observes, it is unclear why creole creators should first assign a null form to a lexical item. For instance, in the case of the person marker -man or the diminutive pikíen- we have to assume that the creole creators first could not identify the English derivational morphemes expressing ‘agentive’, such as -er, and ‘diminutive’, such as -ling, or any other suitable affixes, from whatever input they got, and assigned a null form to the corresponding substratum markers. However, this is rather improbable on two grounds. First, creole creators used free morphemes that are comparable in functions and meanings to substratum derivational affixes already at the very initial stages of creolisation. Second, which is a logical consequence of the first, why should they use zero forms if there are enough free morphemes that can be employed to fulfill similar functions?
There is also a more specific problem with connecting reanalysis to relexification in Early Sranan. First, it has been shown in chapter 7 that none of the Sranan markers can really be regarded as a relexified version of corresponding substratum derivational affixes. This means that for reanalysis to be employed as an explanation for the emergence of Early Sranan markers, we must revise the definition of ‘relexification’ to include cases where there is only partial overlap between lexical entries of substratum and creole items. Or, we must admit that reanalysis can and should be regarded as a process that can operate independently to relexification. The latter seems to be a more promising alternative. Thus, we can assume that in many cases, at the initial stages, when the speakers of Early Sranan were in need for a new word which they did not have or could not identify in the input, they resorted to their L1s. If, for example, the L1 word was complex they searched for the suitable words in the input that were congruent in meaning with the components of this word and transferred (or calqued) it. When several of such transferred items were available, these formed a model for new formations.
387

If the L1 complex words contained the diminutive marker, this diminutive marker was then calqued uniformly by using a certain input morpheme, such as pikíen, which already existed in the input and was congruent in meaning with the substratum diminutive markers. Thus pikíen was reanalysed as the target variety word that had all the prerequisites for the diminutive marker because of its congruence in meaning with substratum diminutive markers. Within such a scenario, reanalysis operates not on the lexical entries, but on the functions of lexical items: the functions of the item pikíen-, which was originally a noun and an adjective in the target variety, are expanded to include the additional functions of the diminutive which are projected onto this item via transfer from the substratum. Reanalysis is in this case a restructuring of the functions of a lexical item.
The development I have just sketched for the marker pikíen- is of course not the only mechanism operating in the emergence of markers. Each of the markers in Early Sranan slightly differs from others in the scope of different processes and influences, such as substratum and superstratum influence, borrowing, functional restructuring, etc. However, almost all of them undergo reanalysis in the scope of functions. Therefore, we can conclude that reanalysis as it is described above was one of the major mechanisms for the emergence of the Early Sranan inventory of markers.
9.4.2. Factors determining the emergence of the inventory of markers
A crucial question in connection to Early Sranan markers is which factors determined the emergence of some markers and non-emergence of others and what role the substratum and superstratum languages might have played in this process. Why, for instance, is there a person marker in Early Sranan, but no specific marker for forming ordinal numerals, as in Fongbe, or no adjectiveforming suffix -ful, productive and rather frequent in Middle and Early Modern English (Dalton-Puffer 1996: 168-170)? Therefore, in what follows I will compare the inventory of markers used in Early Sranan with the inventories of derivational

affixes from the input languages. The overview in (6) shows whether the input languages of Early Sranan use specific affixes to render the derivational concepts that are expressed by specific markers in Early Sranan. ‘Yes’ means that a language has one or several derivational affixes to mark a derivational category, such as ‘person’, ‘diminutive’, etc. I did not include adjectival and verbal derivation in (6) since there are no specific markers in Early Sranan that derive adjectives or verbs. In the case of English, I provide not only affixes, i.e. derivational markers, but also free morphemes that are frequently used to mark certain concepts. This is done in order to show what models for such markers English offers and which were chosen, if at all, by Early Sranan creators as forms for markers. If a substratum language does not have a specific affix to mark a certain semantic category, but has a free content morpheme that is often employed in this function, I denote it by ‘free’. In those cases, where Early Sranan uses a different strategy, for instance reduplication or multifunctionality, for marking a certain derivational concept, I indicate this by (RED) and (MF) respectively. The data on Fongbe are from Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 72; 187), the data on Ewe from Westermann (1709: 62; 79; 120-123), and on Twi from Christaller (1875: 17-18; 42; 54). The information on Kikongo derivational suffixes was taken from Bentley (1887: 528-538; 584; 637).

3 It is unclear whether Fongbe has specific gender markers. Taken close parallels between Fon and Ewe, and the fact that gender markers are common among West African languages (Boretzky 1983: 85-87), it is not improbable after all. 4 For the sake of simplicity, the English affixes that are still in use are given in their modern spelling here, and not in the one they occur in Middle or Early Modern English. 5 The list of abstract nominalising suffixes used in Middle and Early Modern English which is presented here is not exhaustive. I have included only those affixes that have rather high token frequency in Dalton-Puffer’s (1996) data which makes higher the probability of their occurrence in the input for Early Sranan creators. 6 The ordinal numerals in Ewe are created by means of the verb le/li ‘to be’ and the article a: eve (two) > eveleá ‘second’. One could therefore regard them as compounds meaning ‘be two’, ‘be three’, etc. (cf. Schlegel 1856: 99). Since the combination lea is used consistently to mark ordinal numerals, I included it into (6). 7 Ordinal numerals in Kikongo are formed from cardinal numerals by means of the prefix a- which is however, not a specific prefix used exclusively for forming ordinal numerals. This is a prefix used to form adjectives from nouns and since ordinal numerals are treated as adjectives in Kikongo, they are also formed by means of the typical adjectival prefix (Bentley 1887: 558; 575). Therefore, I do not include this prefix in (6). 8 Migge (2003a: 81) argues that there is a locative suffix -pe in Eastern Maroon Creole. It derives place names from verbs, as in siibi-pe (sleep-place), and wooko-pe (work-place) ‘location where one works’. However, my data contain only 5 items where the morpheme plesi/prési ‘place’ is used in the meaning ‘location’, as e.g. beriplesi (bury-place) ‘cemetery’ and lo-plesi (low-place) ‘lowland’, and one item with pe (a reduced form of plesi) in the same meaning: slibe-pe' (sleepplace) ‘sleeping-place’. Therefore, I do not regard plesi as a locative marker because of the scarcity of the data.

The first generalisation emerging from (6) is that all categories for which Early Sranan uses specific markers, except for the augmentative, are also specifically marked by affixes in at least three of the four substratum languages. On the other hand, the semantic categories, such as ‘inversive’, instrumental’, etc., attested in only two or one of the substratum languages, are not attested in Early Sranan. A tentative conclusion we can make so far is that the availability of a marker expressing a certain derivational category in all or the overwhelming majority of substratum languages is an important factor for the emergence of such a marker in the creole. This would at first sight support Lefebvre’s (1998: 46) assumption that features common to all relexified lexicons, and thus to all substratum languages, will most probably be maintained in the creole. Lefebvre (1998: 46) also argues that the idiosyncratic features, i.e. those that are not common to all relexified lexicons, will undergo levelling when creole creators stop targeting the superstratum variety and start targeting relexified lexicons (cf. Siegel 1997). In accordance with Lefebvre’s scenario, the absence of the inversive, instrumental, etc. markers in Early Sranan would be explained by the fact that they possibly existed in Early Sranan, but disappeared through levelling. Although I do not exclude dialect levelling as an explanatory mechanism for the disappearance of some substratum features, I assume that it might well be the case that the features from substratum languages that do not appear as a part of Early Sranan inventory of markers might have been absent from the very beginning. There is one argument to support this position.
Levelling is regarded as a process that often takes place over several generations (Siegel 1997: 128). It might, however, be rather rapid in those cases where children participate as active agents in creolisation (Siegel 1997: 128). Since this was not the case for Early Sranan, we can assume that if levelling took place, it must have been a gradual process. The data for Sranan used in the present investigation come from rather early stages of this creole language, in contrast to most other studies which are based on the data from the modern varieties. These data, as well as the data from one even earlier recent source of Early Sranan, Court records (1667-1767), do not have any traces of these features. This points to the fact that features not common to all substratum lexicons, such as ‘inversive’, or ‘manner of action’, were most likely absent from the very beginning.
391

This leaves us with the necessity of looking for other explanations of the fact why certain substratum features made their way into the creole, whereas others did not. As it will become clear below, there is an array of different other factors that can be employed as explanatory tools for this purpose.
Thus, beside the availability in the substratum, mentioned above, crosslinguistic occurrence of markers for certain derivational categories cannot be disregarded as a factor either. Remarkably, Sranan has developed markers for derivational categories that are rather wide-spread among the world’s languages: ‘agentive’, ‘gender/feminine’, ‘diminutive’, ‘abstract nominaliser’ (Bauer 2002: 40; Bauer 1997 for diminutives; Comrie and Thompson 1985: 351). Apart from this fact, the agentive marker -man and the gender markers which originate from the nouns meaning ‘man’ and ‘woman’ are attested in a number of creole languages (Boretzky 1983: 86-87; Jones 1995: 123). In contrast, categories which are not morphologically marked in Early Sranan, such as ‘nature of X’ or ‘inversive’, are less common cross-linguistically. It points to the fact that beside availability in all substratum languages, the relative unmarkedness of such markers might have contributed to their emergence in Early Sranan.
Availability or non-availability of a certain affix for a certain category in the superstratum was only a minor factor in the emergence of the inventory of Early Sranan markers, contrary to Lefebvre’s (1998: 37-38) assumption that transfer does not take place when the lexifier has no item identifiable with the corresponding substratum form. The data in (6) rather support McWhorter’s (2004: 112-113) observation that even if the superstratum languages provided such a item, there were substratum features that were nevertheless not incorporated into the creole languages. For instance, English has affixes marking inversive, ordinal numeral, instrumental and collective, that are congruent in meaning with those from the substratum languages, but none of these entered Early Sranan. The factors more crucial in this respect are limited access to the target variety and availability of a perceptually salient morpheme in the superstratum that is congruent in meaning with the substratum markers. Thus, English had perceptually salient morphemes that could be used as markers for ‘agentive’, or ‘gender’, whose meanings were congruent with correspondent substratum models and these were chosen as forms for specific derivational categories. With some of the markers that did not enter Early Sranan the situation
392

is different: both Ewe and Fon have specific markers for ordinal numerals, whereas Sranan does not have any. The English equivalent, the suffix -th, is perceptually non-salient, and I cannot imagine any free salient English morpheme that might be a good candidate for this function. The same argument holds for the inversive markers, which are attested in Fongbe and Kikongo, but expressed by the non-salient prefix un- in English.
In general, the impact of English on the emergence of Early Sranan markers was relatively limited. Thus, the first four derivational categories in (6) are also marked by specific affixes or free morphemes in English. However, the form for the diminutive pikíen- is of Portuguese, and not English origin. The English candidate for the augmentative meaning, big, is also not chosen for the Early Sranan augmentative marker, and none of the English abstract nominalisers is traceable in Early Sranan. In general, we can conclude that the presence of a certain marker in English had little or no influence on the emergence of Early Sranan markers. Even if English had free salient morphemes such as little or big, or extremely frequent suffixes such as -ness, which are rather transparent in morphophonological terms since they often operate on invariable bases (DaltonPuffer 1996: 112), such morphemes were not chosen by Early Sranan creators as markers of derivational categories. This has two implications. First, that access to the lexifier was limited and that the variety acquired was already a contact variety containing mixed elements and possibly rather few items with derivational morphology. Second, it shows that access to the lexifier is more crucial than perceptual saliency, congruency and frequency in the input: even salient, congruent and frequent items from the lexifier were not always adopted in Early Sranan as forms for the markers.
The fact that Early Sranan creators also did not transfer any of the substratum affixes in their original form indicates that possibly not only the perceptual salience of these morphemes in the superstratum, but also perceptual salience of the markers in the substratum languages and the resulting greater structural simplicity and semantic transparency of substratum structures containing such markers might have been an influencial factor as well. The surprising fact about the substratum categories which have equivalents in Early Sranan is that most of them are expressed by morphemes that are either homophonous with some free morphemes in these languages or are free
393

morphemes. For instance, the agentive and diminutive suffixes in Fon and Ewe have homophonous content morphemes, such as ‘father’, ‘mother’ and ‘child’. The gender and wh-markers are also perceptually salient morphemes in the majority of substratum languages. Complex words in which such morphemes are used exhibit greater semantic and morphotactic transparency. In contrast, the inversive markers of Kikongo and Fongbe, or the instrumental markers in Twi and Kikongo are not salient. Interestingly, among the four substratum languages, most of the affixes that did not enter Early Sranan come from Kikongo. Of course, this may be explained by a more marginal role of Kikongo in the emergence of Early Sranan in comparison to the Gbe dialects (cf. Migge 2003a: 55). Another argument could be that Kikongo, in contrast to the Gbe varieties, has morphotactically much less transparent complex words: Kikongo affixes usually exhibit a great deal of allomorphy and trigger vowel alternation and other phonological changes (Bentley 1887: 528-538). It can be hypothesized therefore that morpheme recognition and ‘isolation’ is easier in complex words which are structurally more simplex and semantically and morphotactically more transparent.
In general, the emergence or non-emergence of a marker for the given derivational category should be best explained not by a sole factor, but by a number of different, possibly interacting factors. For instance, the fact that an inversive affix did not emerge in Early Sranan can be explained by at least four factors: its availability in two substratum languages only, perceptual non-salience of the superstratum candidate un-, the absence of a suitable semantically and structurally congruent alternative, and morphotactic opacity of this affix in the substratum languages, e.g. in Kikongo.
In conclusion, the emergence of the inventory of Early Sranan markers was a rather complex process that involved an interplay of several factors, such as availability in all substratum languages, availability of perceptually salient congruent morpheme in the superstratum, cross-linguistic occurrence of a derivational category, morphotactic transparency and salience of the substratum morphemes.
The discussion above allows two conclusions about some current assumptions concerning the inventory of creole affixes and the influence of substratum and superstratum on it.
394

The first assumption is that creole languages are less complex than ‘older languages’ in the sense that they exhibit less ‘overspecification’ (McWhorter 2004). In respect to derivational morphology, McWhorter argues that Saramaccan is less complex than Fongbe since it uses only two derivational markers whereas Fongbe has eight or nine. The case of Early Sranan is similar to that of Saramaccan since it has fewer number of markers than the major substratum languages Ewe, Fon or Kikongo. So, in purely quantitative terms, it is less complex. On the other hand, however, if approached not in terms of the number of markers, but in terms of the number of categories that are expressed, the Sranan inventory is not less complex. Besides, compared to Twi, it has almost the same number of markers. A more general implication of these facts is that morphological simplicity or complexity cannot be approached from one angle only and that mere counting does not tell the whole story (cf. Siegel 2004b).
The second set of assumptions concerns substratum and superstratum influence on the inventory of creole affixes. In this connection Lefebvre (1998: 333) argues that the inventory of derivational affixes is determined to a great extent by that of the substratum language, and not by universal principles. Another claim advanced by Lefebvre (1998: 325) is that the superstratum affixes which do not have any correspondences in the substratum will not enter the creole lexicon since the creole speakers do not have corresponding entries in their L1s.
In principle, the data presented here support both assumptions. Although Early Sranan inventory of markers does not have a one-to-one correspondence to any of the substratum languages, it is comparable in size with the inventories of Fon, Twi and Ewe. None of the English affixes entered the creole. However, the explanations for these two processes advanced here go in a different direction than Lefebvre’s, who mainly explains it using the notion ‘relexification’. Besides, Lefebvre’s account is based on a comparison to one substratum language. As I have shown, taking different substratum languages into account makes explanations more difficult and more complex.
Thus, whereas Early Sranan has an inventory comparable to Ewe, Fon and Twi, it is much less comparable to the Kikongo inventory. Lefebvre’s account would explain this by levelling. However, levelling alone cannot account for why it was the Gbe system that exercised a greater influence on Early Sranan. As demonstrated above, Kikongo derivational system is characterised by the
395

preponderance of non-salient, morphotactically less transparent affixes and also by a number of categories that are not attested in other substratum languages. The Gbe system is less marked: it contains several morphotactically transparent affixes, marks rather common derivational categories and has a greater number of analytical structures. Besides, socio-historically, Kikongo might have played a less significant role in the emergence of the Surinamese creoles than the Gbe varieties (Migge 2003a). Without denying Lefebvre’s claim in principle, it can be concluded that the way in which substratum influence is favoured or constrained depends largely on both universal and socio-historical factors, and not on mere presence of a given affix in the substratum.
Turning now to the claim that superstratum affixes without substratum correspondences will not enter the creole, we can conclude that the absence of equivalent superstratum entries cannot be taken as the sole reason. In the case of Early Sranan, even if superstratum had equivalent entries, the creole creators did not adopt them or even chose forms originating from a different contact language. In general, it is difficult to say which of the several possible factors might have been responsible for the non-emergence of superstratum affixes in Early Sranan: reduced target variety(s), limited contact to the superstratum, perceptual nonsalience and low semantic and morphotactic transparency of certain derivational morphemes.
9.4.3. The role of substratum and superstratum languages in the emergence of Early Sranan markers
In the previous sections an overall comparison of the Early Sranan inventory of markers and those of its source languages was done. The purpose of the present section is to take a close look at each individual marker, to define the extent of substratum and superstratum influence and the mechanisms that played a role in the emergence of each marker.
The overview in (7) shows structural characteristics and major functions of the Early Sranan person marker -man and the person affixes from all major input languages of Early Sranan.

As it can be inferred from (7), on the one hand, the Early Sranan person marker shares several structural and semantic properties with the English marker -man: both can be used with verbs and adjectives, and surface in the functions ‘connected with X’ and ‘characterised by X’. On the other hand, there are even more significant similarities to the Gbe languages in terms of functions: Early Sranan -man is attested in almost all functions which are characteristic of different person markers in the Gbe languages.
However, the Early Sranan marker -man cannot be regarded as an exact copy of any of the substratum affixes. Although it shares functions and structural properties with many Gbe suffixes, it alone combines functions and structural properties which are characteristic of at least two different suffixes in the Gbe languages. This points to the fact that -man did not emerge through relexification of one substratum affix. Since Early Sranan man-words have several equivalents in different substratum languages, which were uniformly transferred into Sranan by means of -man, it means that structural and semantic patterns with person markers rather than lexical entries of individual morphemes played a crucial role in the emergence of -man.
To conclude, substratum languages alone were not responsible for the emergence of the person marker -man. Rather, both the superstratum and the substratum interacted in this process. English contributed the form for the marker,

9 It is unclear whether the Early Sranan -man was used in the function ‘inhabitant of X’ since no instances of such use are attested in the early sources. In modern Surinamese creoles, e.g. EMC, it is used in this function (Migge 2003a: 80).
397

and also provided the patterns that were structurally and semantically similar to those from the substratum. Some of the English man-compounds such as gentleman, free man, sick man might have been borrowed into Early Sranan. Once the creole creators identified man as a person-marking element, they started transferring words from their source languages using uniformly this one marker. Parallelly to this, they created new words that bore similarity to both superstratum and substratum forms because of the available models from both languages.
The fact that the great variety of different substratum affixes was ‘reduced’ to only one marker in the creole, but with a similar range of functions of all substratum affixes combined, shows that the way in which substratum languages influence the emerging creole can be constrained by the models available in the input. Since English man-patterns provided the only salient, analytical, structurally and semantically congruent models with what was available in the substratum, -man became the only person marker in Early Sranan.
The emergence of the gender markers man(n)- and uman- partially parallels that of the person marker -man. The overview in (8) presents a comparison between the functions of the gender markers in Early Sranan and in its contributing languages:

The Early Sranan gender markers again originate from the English forms man and woman. However, there is only a partial overlap between them in function:
398

whereas the English man is used marginally in names of animals and plants, and woman not at all, the Early Sranan gender markers often occur in this function. In general, the English patterns with the gender marking man- and woman-, such as man-nurse, manservant, man-child, woman-doctor can hardly be considered as models for the Sranan words. First, they are relatively infrequent in English. Second, none of the Early Sranan complex words with the gender markers has been borrowed from English.
In contrast, the range of functions attested for the gender markers in Early Sranan is exactly the same as the range of functions gender markers exhibit in the substratum languages. Besides, there are quite a number of complex words with gender markers in Early Sranan which are calques of substratum items with gender markers. However, the Early Sranan gender markers cannot be regarded as copies of corresponding substratum lexical entries since all substratum languages have two different sets of markers for human beings and animals/plants respectively whereas Early Sranan uses one set, but in two different functions.
In conclusion, the superstratum provided the form for the gender markers, but not the models for gender-marking constructions. The choice of the form was determined by the semantic congruency between the substratum and superstratum markers, most of which come from the nouns meaning ‘man’ and ‘woman’. Substratum provided a number of complex words that have been uniformly transferred into Early Sranan with man(n)- and uman- and served as models for the creation of new words with gender markers. Again, the input might have constrained substratum influence in such a way that only one set of markers emerged instead of two: man and woman were the only semantically congruent, salient and frequent forms the target variety provided.
The diminutive marker pikin- shows yet a different development. Its form is taken from the Portuguese adjective pequeno ‘small’. Portuguese, however, can hardly have provided a model for the use of pequeno in the diminutive function in the way it is used in Early Sranan: in Portuguese, it is an adjective meaning ‘small’ and not the noun meaning ‘child’ or the verb ‘to be small’. Again, the functions for pikíen- come from the substratum languages Fongbe and Ewe, which have diminutives with exactly the same range of meanings, whereas Kikongo has diminutive markers with a different range of functions:
399

(9) diminutive markers
pikíen- (Early Sranan) -vı@ (Fongbe) -vı@ (Ewe) kin/kim- (Ki) fi- (Ki)

‘small N’ 9 9 9 9

‘young N’ 9 910 9

‘tiny N’ 9

At first sight, the diminutive pikíen- looks like a good candidate for relexification from either Ewe or Fongbe since it exhibits exactly the same range of meanings and combines with nouns only. However, as I have shown in Chapter 7, beside functioning as the diminutive marker, it is also attested as the noun ‘child’, the adjective ‘small’ and the verb ‘to be small’. Neither Fongbe -vı@ nor the Ewe -vı@ exhibit the same range of functions. One can assume that there are two lexical entries for pikíen in Early Sranan: one for the diminutive pikíen-, the other for the noun/verb/adjective. The same must then be admitted for Ewe and Fongbe, where even three different lexical entries must be hypothesised: one for the diminutive, one for the noun ‘child’, and one for the adjective/verb ‘small/to be small’ which is expressed by yet different items in Fongbe: kpE›-vı@ and vu¤ , as well as in Ewe: suE .¤ Then, however, it is surprising that Sranan creators relexified three different lexical entries by using the same phonological form pikíen. An interesting fact about pikíen is that it was, according to Aceto (1997: 230-231), a rather common word that English sailors and colonists used to denote ‘child’ and which is widespread in other English-based creole languages, such as Krio, Cameroon PE, and Jamaican. We can assume therefore that the meanings of pikíen-, such as ‘child’ and ‘small’, did not emerge as the result of relexification from substratum languages, but existed already in the very early contact varieties in Suriname as a result of early borrowing from Portuguese or other contact varieties in the Caribbean. When the Gbe speakers targeted the contact variety, they learned the item pikíen- as having the two meanings, and associated it with three different items in their L1s. They then transferred items containing the diminutive -vı@ using pikíen- since it was the only item the target variety offered that was congruent in meaning with the corresponding items from their L1s since both shared the
10 According to Lefebvre (1998: 318).
400

meanings ‘small’ and ‘child’. In conclusion, the emergence of pikíen- as the diminutive marker included the following steps: identification of the item already available in the target variety as semantically congruent with items in the source languages of creole creators, transfer of substratum words by using this item, and creation of innovations possibly by analogy to the transferred substratum words. A more general implication of this is that the ways by which substratum items and structures enter the creole depend on the fact what congruent items the target variety offers.
The emergence of the abstract nominaliser -sanni is similar to the cases described above. In Ewe and Fon the items with the meaning ‘thing’ are also used to create abstract nouns. Some of Early Sranan items containing -sanni have direct equivalents in Ewe and Fon. English, however, does not provide any similar pattern. Again, we can assume that once sanni was identified as an item corresponding to the substratum nyo (Ewe) and nǔ (Fon), some of the substratum complex words containing these items were transferred into Early Sranan and new formations were created according to this model. As in the cases above, the role of the superstratum is confined to providing the form, whereas the substratum languages provided the functions of the morpheme and the pattern in which -sanni is used as an abstract nominaliser.
The emergence of the augmentative mammá- remains largely unclear. Words containing augmentative markers similar to Early Sranan constructs with mammá- are not attested either in the superstratum or in the major substratum languages of Early Sranan. However, they exist in other related African languages, e.g. Bantu languages (Laman 1912: 50), which means that the substratum influence cannot be excluded for the augmentative mammá altogether.
The pattern with the abstract nominaliser -fasi does not have parallels in the major substratum languages. The superstratum also does not have structures with ‘fashion’ which might have served as models for creating abstract nouns of the type laufasi (stupid-manner) ‘stupidity’. With due caution, one can assume that this marker is the result of an innovation on the part of the missionaries (see chapter 7 for details). It shows that beside the influence from the superstratum and substratum, structural expansion also took place. However, since -fasi is the only marker in whose emergence substratum and superstratum influence did not play a role, we can conclude that contrary to Mühlhäusler (1995a), structural expansion
401

cannot be regarded as the central driving force for the emergence of new wordformation markers in Early Sranan.
The following generalisations about the role of the superstratum and substratum in the emergence of Early Sranan markers can be made. The superstratum provided some of the forms and in one case, that of the person marker, the models for the creole structures. In general, however, the discussion above shows that the role of English in the emergence of creole structures with different markers was marginal. Of the seven morphemes used as markers for the derivational concepts, the influence of English in terms of structure and function can be claimed for one only, the person marker -man and hypothesised, with due caution, for the other two: the gender markers man(n)- and uman-. These considerations go against Migge’s (2003a) assumption that the superstratum generally provides the frames for creole structures.
However, the discussion also shows that the ways in which substratum markers influenced or entered Early Sranan are determined by the range and meanings of the items the target variety offered as suitable equivalents for substratum affixes. In the case of the three markers, -man, pikíen- and man(n)/uman-, the L1 models were restructured to comprise several functions, fulfilled by different items in the substratum languages, under one target form. Thus, formal reduction went hand in hand with functional expansion of the markers. This also shows that claims about ‘simplicity’ of creole structures must be much more specific: what looks as simple on the surface might be complex on a closer and more detailed inspection. I will return to the problems with the notion of simplicity in the concluding section of the present chapter.
Substratum languages provided the functions of several markers. However, the evidence presented here contradicts the assumption that derivational morphology of creole languages develops as a result of relexification. The assumption made in the present investigation is that the way by which creole markers acquire the same functions as the substratum markers is not necessarily via relexification of the lexical entries, but by transfer of a number of substratum complex items and their subsequent functioning as models for creating innovations. A more general implication of this is that the creation of wordformation does not necessarily operate on the level of individual morphemes, as it is assumed within the Relexification Hypothesis, but on the level of structures
402

these morphemes surface in. Rather than copying individual morphemes, creole creators first identified the superstratum lexical items, then copied whole words using the items learned, which lead to the crystallisation of certain patterns in the creole that then served as models for the formation of new complex words.
In conclusion, the emergence of Early Sranan markers was a complex process which involved not only a variety of sometimes interacting influences from the contributing languages, but also a variety of different mechanisms.
9.5. The emergence of concatenative patterns: influencing factors and mechanisms
In the preceding sections the emphasis was on the emergence of Early Sranan derivational markers. In the sections to follow, the discussion will center around another strategy amply used by creole creators for expanding their wordformation system: concatenation of free morphemes. The purpose of this discussion is to demonstrate what influenced the development of most common concatenative patterns, what mechanisms and constraints played a role in this process.
In (10) the inventory of productive and common compounding patterns in Early Sranan and its major source languages are presented. The data on Twi and Kikongo compounds available to me were not substantial, therefore they are excluded from the comparison. The data for Ewe are taken from Schlegel (1856: 29-45) and Westermann (1907: 118-131), the data on Fongbe are from Lefebvre and Brousseau (2002: 221-234).

The inventory of productive compounding patterns used in Early Sranan consists of nominal compounding only. It is thus smaller in size than the English inventory which also contains adjectival compounding and Prep-N compounding. On the other hand, it is comparable in the size with the inventory of the substratum languages which also make productive use of nominal compounding only.
As it can be inferred from (10), several of the English compounding strategies did not enter Early Sranan. On the one hand, one can assume that since reduction is a common mechanism that operates at the initial stages of SLA, Early Sranan creators adopted only the most common compounding strategies from the target variety. On the other hand, since the superstratum input was already reduced, it was rather the case that the variety of patterns was limited already in the target variety.
Since the inventory of Early Sranan compounding exhibits almost the same number and even types of patterns as the substratum languages, one is tempted to suggest that the size of the creole inventory was determined by the substratum: only those patterns that were available in the substratum as well as superstratum entered Early Sranan. However, this claim is difficult to substantiate since the major three types of compounding are rather common crosslinguistically (cf. Bongartz 2002: 16). Besides, evidence from SLA shows that on the initial stages, N-N compounding prevails over all the other types, independently of source and target languages (Broeder et al. 1993: 50).

11 Although English also has verbal compounds, such as to backbite and to whitewash, these are excluded from the overview in (10) since they were not productive and common before the 16th century (Marchand 1969: 102; 104). Besides, it is argued that they are mainly formed via conversion and backformation (Marchand 1969: 101).
404

In general, the size of the inventory of compounding patterns was determined by a variety of factors: availability in the superstratum and in the substratum, limited access to the superstratum varieties, the reduced nature of these varieties, and the general unmarkedness of these patterns.
Let us now take a closer look at the individual patterns. To define the extent of superstratum or substratum influence for the each separate type of compounding, I provide a more detailed overview of compounding in Early Sranan, English and Fongbe in (11). I have chosen Fongbe as a basis for a comparison because it is the only substratum language for which detailed and reliable information on compounding is available12.

There are striking parallels between Early Sranan nominal compounding and that of both English and Fongbe. Thus, English has the same types of compounds as Early Sranan with the exception of three patterns: A-N (A=Re-V) compounds, as e.g. wakkawakka-müra (walking ants) ‘ants of special kind’, N-N compounds, as e.g. watere moffe (water-mouth) ‘saliva’, and V-N-N compounds, as e.g. wassi-
12 Syntactic heads of the compounds in (11) are marked by underlining. Unattested patterns are marked by a horizontal slash.
405

hán-kómiki (wash-hand-basin) ‘basin for washing hands’. These types are, however, also rare in Early Sranan. Besides, English employs synthetic compounds, whereas Early Sranan does not.
Parallels to Fongbe are closer, as far as the different types of compounds are concerned. With the exception of synthetic compounds in (11d), all types of nominal compounding attested in Early Sranan are also attested in Fongbe. However, there are three major differences between compounding in Early Sranan and Fongbe.
First, in a number of patterns there is a difference in productivity between Fongbe and Early Sranan. Thus, the N-V-N compounding is productive in Fongbe, but seems to be a later development in Early Sranan since the only two examples attested are from Focke (1855). This can be explained by the fact that N-V-N compounding has a more complex semantic structure and it is also not attested in English. Instead of using this pattern, creole creators gave preference to the more semantically and structurally simple one, V-N. Besides, items exhibiting A-N (A=RED-V) structure, as well as left-headed N-N compounds are very rare in Early Sranan. This implies that the presence of a compounding pattern in the creole can be the result of an occasional calquing of substratum items.
Second, Early Sranan lacks synthetic compounds of the type gle$-lE$-tç@ (field-grow-PM) ‘farmer’ and gives preference to binary N/V/A-man constructs instead. Substratum words with N-V-PM structure are usually rendered by words with N/V/A-PM structure in Early Sranan. Given the same situation in Haitian, for whom Fongbe is a major substratum language, Lefebvre (1998: 347-348), citing Brousseau (1989a), provides two explanations for this fact. Lefebvre argues that on the one hand, direct objects of verbs must be obligatorily realised in Fongbe even in generic contexts and need not so in Haitian. On the other hand, Fongbe has many inherent object verbs (e.g. jı-$ han$ (produce-song) ‘to sing’), whereas Haitian employs simplex verbs. Since Early Sranan resembles Haitian in these two respects, i.e. the direct objects must both be realised obligatorily in Early Sranan and the majority of verbs are simplexes, e.g. singi ‘to sing’, slibi ‘to sleep’, etc., the same kind of explanation can be advanced for Early Sranan’s lack of synthetic compounds. However, such an explanation does not account for the fact that synthetic compounds of the type figi-strati-man (sweep-street-PM) ‘street-
406

sweeper’ exist in Modern Sranan (Van den Berg 2003: 242). Besides, synthetic compounds also exist in Saramaccan (Veenstra to appear), but are not attested in the early sources, such as the Saramaccan dictionary by Schumann (1778). The explanation may rather lie in the relative complexity of such structures and their subsequent avoidance at the early stages of acquisition or their simplification into V/N/A-man structures. A similar phenomenon is observed in first language acquisition of English-learning children who first start producing compounds of the type pull-man or wash-man, and use synthetic structures such as wagon-puller only later (Clark 1993: 150). Combining two bare roots such as pull and man is a formally and semantically simpler option than combining two roots and an affix. In general it means that Sranan creators employed simplification strategies to the structures from their L1s.
Finally, there is also a difference in the order of elements between some of Early Sranan and Fongbe compounds, especially between exocentric ones. The order of elements in Early Sranan compounds follows the order of elements in Early Sranan syntactic phrases which in its turn follows the order of elements in English syntactic phrases, as in (12):

(12) N-N order in NP
mi brara wyfie my brother wife ‘my brother’s wife’ (Van Dyk c1765: 10)

A-N order in NP

V-O order

INDEF good medicine to break plantation

‘a good medicine’

‘to break plantation’

(Schumann 1783: 130)

(Schumann 1783: 23)

This is in line with Lefebvre’s (1998: 341) assumption that the order of major category lexical items parallels the order of the superstratum language since creole creators target items and structures of the lexifier and hence adopt its order of elements. The same phenomenon is observed for SLA. Thus, in the study by Broeder et al. (1993: 50), the learners of English had a clear predominance of head-final structures in N-N and N-Prep-N constructions. This can be explained by the fact that English is rather uncontroversial in terms of word order so that learners can easily identify and thus acquire this order early. The creators of Early Sranan must also have identified the target language order early since left-headed compounds are rather few in Early Sranan. They then restructured the

407

constructions from their L1 in respect to word order under the influence of the target variety. Note that all substratum languages of Early Sranan have both leftheaded and right-headed compounds. This might have facilitated a relatively early and uniform adaptation of the target word-order.
In general the discussion above shows that it is not easy to establish a case for substratum transfer or superstratum influence since Early Sranan compounding patterns are common cross-linguistically, structurally simple, and transparent both morphotactically and semantically. However, what also becomes clear is that in some cases, factors such as structural and semantic complexity constrain transfer or lead either to a marginality of a given pattern or to its total absence, at least during the initial stages of creole genesis. Besides, creole creators restructured their L1 constructions in terms of word order under the influence of the target variety.
Beside the most common concatenation patterns presented in (11), Early Sranan has a number of other patterns, whose emergence is rather interesting in terms of substratum and superstratum influence. Such patterns are listed in (13). For the sake of better comparability and simplicity I present the Sranan and the substratum patterns by way of English translations. Question marks indicate opaque constituents.

The overview in (13) allows several generalisations about the factors that determine what patterns from those available in the substratum or superstratum will make their way into the creole.
The role of English in the emergence of the patterns in (13) was rather marginal: hardly any pattern in (13) is modeled on the superstratum. Even if the same patterns can be used in English and in the creole, as, for instance, [Det-N] patterns, the creole words created by these patterns correspond to those from the substratum languages. Beside the general factors already mentioned above, such as limited access to the superstratum and reduced input, several other factors can be made responsible for disfavoring of the superstratum models and preference for the substratum patterns.
One crucial factor for the emergence of a certain pattern or for the preference for a certain pattern from a variety of available ones in the source languages is its analytical, and thus semantically and morphotactically transparent character. For instance, whereas numerals are formed by means of suffixes, suppletion and vowel change in English, the substratum patterns are concatenative, i.e. analytical. The creole thus has the same patterns as the substratum languages.
Another possible factor is the regularity of the patterns provided by the source languages. If a given pattern is both analytical and transparent, it is the factor of regularity that determines its emergence in the creole. The interaction of the two factors: transparency and regularity can be demonstrated on the example of numerals from ‘eleven’ to ‘nineteen’. English uses the suffix -teen, vowel alternation and suppletion for the formation of such numerals which is a less semantically and morphotactically transparent pattern than the patterns of the substratum languages. Therefore, this pattern does not surface in the creole. All the substratum patterns have concatenative patterns which are semantically and morphotactically transparent. The pattern used in Early Sranan is transferred from Kikongo because it combines both semantic and morphotactic transparency and is regular.

409

If none of the substratum languages could offer a structurally simple, semantically transparent and regular pattern for a certain type of word-formation, regularisation of the L1 patterns took place. This is what happened to names of the days in Early Sranan. English has a semi-transparent pattern where only the meaning of the second element is discernible: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday etc. Fongbe uses different transparent words which all contain the noun ‘day’, therefore it is a transparent, but not a regular pattern. All Kikongo day names except for ‘Sunday’ are uniformly created by combining the nominalising prefix and ordinal numerals, but they are less transparent since they involve affixation often triggering root changes. The Ewe system is both semi-transparent and semiregular: it uses transparent pattern such as [Num-day] and [field work-Num-day] and semi-transparent one [field work-?-day]. Early Sranan pattern is similar to that of Ewe, [Num-day-work], since both Early Sranan and Ewe employ a numeral, the noun ‘day’ and the concept ‘work’. However, the Ewe pattern was restructured in Early Sranan to become more regular and more transparent: all day names except for ‘Sunday’ are formed by the same pattern, and more semantically transparent since they uniformly involve numerals.
Cross-substratum occurrence of a given pattern can also contribute to the fact that a pattern will emerge in the creole. This might have been the case with the [Det-N] patterns for the formation of adverbs or indefinite pronouns in Early Sranan. However, cross-substratum occurrence is only secondary to the transparency factor.
In general, most of the patterns in (13) emerged under substratum influence, whereas the role of the superstratum in this process was very limited. The choice of certain substratum structures was determined largely by factors of semantic and morphotactic transparency and regularity. Regularisation was one of the mechanisms by which the substratum input was restructured in the emerging creole word-formation.

9.6. Conclusion 1: The emergence of Early Sranan wordformation as a many-faceted process
The present investigation shows that the emergence of Early Sranan wordformation was a rather complex and multi-faceted process in which different mechanisms and different types of influences interacted in a complex manner being favoured or constrained by a variety of factors.
Disappearance of all superstratum derivational morphemes, as well as of some superstratum compounding patterns, and elaboration of new, compensatory strategies of word-formation were two major processes involved in the creation of Early Sranan word-formation. These processes closely resemble two developmental stages in SLA where learners first create the so-called ‘basic variety’ characterized by reduction and simplification of structures and later restructure this initial system in the direction of greater complexity and greater expressive power (Klein and Perdue 1997; Winford 2005 for an overview). It is difficult to establish the exact point of time when the elimination of English derivational morphology and some compounding strategies took place: during the first contact setting (1652-1679) or later, when new slaves started targeting the already existing contact variety. However, the fact that reduction and simplification took place at some point is relatively uncontroversial. This supports Winford’s (2005: 5) assumption that independently of the type of input, individual learners in both SLA and creole formation start with the ‘basic variety’.
The elaboration stage involved the emergence of new word-formation devices and processes. Free morphemes available in the target variety came to be used in functions typical of derivational morphemes in ‘older’ languages. Other processes, such as compounding, reduplication and multifunctionality were used to compensate for the lack of adequate word-formation resources and to expand the lexicon necessary for inter-ethnic communication.
The development of new word-formation resources was accompanied by restructuring of the patterns of the source languages. Thus, Early Sranan creators simplified structurally complex L1 patterns (V-N-N>V-N), reduced the number of markers for the same derivational category with a parallel expansion of their
411

functions, reanalysed L1 structures in terms of the target variety word-order and regularised some semi-transparent and semi-regular patterns.
The elaboration stage was characterized by two major types of influence: that from the target variety and the substratum languages. The target variety influence is traceable in the forms of the Early Sranan markers for derivational categories, in borrowings of English (and Dutch) complex words, in the righthand order of elements in complex structures, and, rarely, in providing models for transfer of substratum patterns (the person marker -man).
The influence of the substratum languages is more substantial and extensive. It comprises the suppliance of functions for several derivational markers, of a number of complex words that have been calqued by using the target variety morphemes, and of some word-formation patterns (reduplication, V-N-N, A-N (A=RED-V) compounding).
Substratum influence was constrained by a number of factors, such as structural and more often, semantic congruence between the target variety and substratum morphemes, structural simplicity, semantic and morphotactic transparency of the substratum patterns, salience of substratum morphemes and more marginally, cross-substratum occurrence of a pattern and its availability in the target variety.
The patterns that emerged as the result of substratum (and superstratum) influence gave rise to the creation of innovations, i.e. complex words that had no parallels either in the target variety or in the substratum languages. However, in general there were relatively few innovations in terms of word-formation means and processes (cf. Mühlhäusler 1995a). Thus, of all types of word-formation patterns only two, instrumental and approximative reduplication, do not have parallels in the substratum and/or superstratum. And of all word-formation markers again only two, the nominaliser-fasi and the augmentative marker mammá-, have no evident correspondences in the substratum and/or superstratum languages. On the one hand, this can be explained by the fact that the time-span of the present investigation included only the first 200 years which is a relatively short period for many cases of the expansion in terms of expressive power to take place. On the other hand, there must be a need for such an expansion. As I have shown for the case of Early Sranan, its word-formation devices are capable of expressing a wide range of semantic concepts, which possibly reduced such need.
412

Communication strategies employed by Early Sranan creators resemble those used by second language learners on the early stages, such as avoidance of certain structures, retention of L1 structures, innovative use of already existing means (Poulisse 1996). Thus, formally and semantically more complex structures, such as synthetic compounds were avoided, many of L1 structures were used, and many new complex words were created by using resources available in the creole, such as free morphemes to render specific derivational concepts.
All in all, the scenario presented here allows a conclusion that the emergence of Early Sranan word-formation resembled cases of SLA in a number of aspects, such as the developmental stages in the creation of word-formation system, the communication strategies employed by learners, the type of influence the emerging learner system(s) undergo and the type of constraints on L1 transfer. It differs from SLA, however, in the range of L1 influence, the reduced target language input and the overall outcome of acquisition. First, whereas in SLA individual learners stop heavy reliance on L1 as they advance in the acquisition process (Winford 2003: 335), Early Sranan creators extensively used L1 structures in the elaboration stage. This lies in the fact that SLA is usually an individual process whereas creole formation is a collective process. Second, as the evidence presented throughout the present investigation shows, English word-formation patterns and derivational morphemes played a marginal role in the development of Early Sranan word-formation. Finally, the outcome of SLA is usually a more or less close approximation to the target language. In the case of Early Sranan wordformation, a system rather different from English emerged. All in all this shows that creoles should be viewed as early interlanguages (cf. Plag 2005).
Three other conclusions arise from the present investigation. First, the present study confirms the significant role of socio-historical factors in the outcome of language contact. The absence of the superstratum derivational morphology, the relatively small amount of complex words borrowed from English, and overall scarcity of the superstratum influence on Early Sranan word-formation are indicative of the fact that the socio-historical factors, such as the type of community setting (plantation economy), the demographics of the population (high ratios of the African slaves, continuous new arrivals) and most of all, the intensity of contact played a crucial role in the final outcome of Early Sranan word-formation and largely reduced the extent of the superstratum
413

influence. This is what makes Early Sranan so different from other creole languages such as Haitian or Papiamentu which had a more intensive and/or prolonged contact with its superstratum and thus experienced a more considerable influence in the sphere of word-formation.
The second implication arising from the present investigation is that the varieties of English the creole creators targeted must have been rather reduced in terms of derivational morphology and other word-formation processes so that creole creators had to rely mainly on the L1 structures (cf. Winford 2005: 13). The evidence for this lies in the fact that first, none of the English derivational morphology survived in Early Sranan, and second, there is in general little influence of English word-formation on that of Early Sranan, even in terms of borrowing of individual complex words. Third, most word-formation patterns of Early Sranan have parallels in one of the substratum languages. This evidence confirms both Migge’s (1998; 2003a) assumption that the varieties serving as the input for creole creators in Suriname were rather reduced and Arends’ (1995a) argument that the target of acquisition for the slaves during the formative years of Sranan were varieties quite distinct from English.
Third, the data analysis done in the present work also shows that the Gbe languages have played a more crucial role in the emergence of Early Sranan wordformation than Kikongo. On the one hand, this can be explained by the numerical preponderance of the Gbe-speaking slaves during the third contact setting (16951720) (Migge 2003a) and the resulting frequency of the Gbe input (cf. Mufwene 2001: 44). On the other hand, the greater typological similarity between the Gbe languages and the target variety creole creators acquired, as well as greater structural, semantic and morphotactic transparency of the Gbe models facilitated perception, production and thus transfer of patterns into the emerging creole word-formation system (cf. Mufwene 2001: 44).
In general, the present research shows that a reconstruction of the process of the emergence of creole word-formation is possible only when a great variety of factors, influences and mechanisms are taken into account.
414

9.7. Conclusion 2: Implications for theories of creolisation
The present study bears a number of implications for current theories of creole genesis.
The present study does not confirm the major tenets of the superstratist theory of creolisation as it is elaborated in Chaudenson (2001; 1992) (cf. Mufwene 2001; 1997). One of the central claims of this theory is that the starting point for creole languages are the second language varieties rather similar to the superstratum, which gradually diverged from the superstratum in the course of time and experienced some interference from the native languages of each new generation of slaves. The investigation of Early Sranan word-formation shows that the starting point for Sranan were rather reduced varieties characterised by a mixture of elements and structures typical of contact situations in extreme social settings.
Another claim advanced by Chaudenson is that there has been little influence by the native languages of creole creators. It has, however, been shown throughout the present paper that Early Sranan word-formation drew only marginally on the superstratum sources, and that parallels to substratum languages are much more numerous. Thus, all superstratum bound morphemes were lost, and most of the Early Sranan markers either acquired their functions from the substratum or are language-internal innovations. Markers for which superstratum models might have played a role (the person marker and the male gender marker), diverge from them both structurally and functionally. Besides, several superstratum compounding patterns do not feature in Early Sranan, and there are also rather few borrowings of complex words from English.
The present investigation also does not confirm some of the major assumptions of the Relexification Hypothesis of Lefebvre (1998) in respect to the emergence of creole word-formation.
The central claim behind the Relexification Hypothesis is that creole languages arise via relexification, a mental process by which properties of substratum lexical items are copied and replaced with the superstratum phonetic strings in the creole (Lefebvre 1998: 17). With respect to affixational derivation, Lefebvre (1998: 333) claims that first, creole derivational affixes arise as a result of relexification of the substratum affixes and second, the inventory of creole
415

derivational affixes is largely determined by that of the substratum and not by universal factors.
The first claim cannot be substantiated by evidence from the present work, since in most cases, we do not find one-to-one correspondences between the functions and combinatorial properties of Early Sranan markers and substratum affixes. Besides, there are markers for which no correspondences in the substratum exist. It has therefore been argued in the present analysis that the substratum mainly influenced the development of Early Sranan word-formation not via relexification of individual lexical entries, but via the process of transfer of complex words and functional reanalysis of the target morphemes on the basis of L1 models. Therefore, substratum influence should be better described not as relexification, but as transfer, since the latter term does not presuppose a one-toone mapping of lexical entries, functions, patterns, etc.
The second claim is problematic as well. The inventory of Early Sranan markers is indeed comparable to some of the substratum languages in both the size and the type of derivational categories marked, although it is not exactly the same. There is also no denying the fact that substratum languages influenced Early Sranan in respect to the type of the markers that emerged. However, contrary to Lefebvre, it has been shown in the present study that substratum inventory of markers is not the sole factor that played a role in this process, and that substratum models were interacting in a complex way with the models and morphemes available in the target variety, as well as with the factors of semantic and morphotactic transparency and structural complexity.
With respect to compounding, Lefebvre (1998: 348) suggests that creole creators use the principles of concatenation of their own grammar in creating complex words. For instance, concepts rendered as compounds in the substratum are often rendered as compounds in the creole, but as simplexes in the superstratum. Simplexes are compounded according to the semantics of the substratum. Besides, as Lefebvre asserts, the types of compounds in the creole parallel those of the substratum languages. These claims are difficult to maintain in the view of the evidence presented here on a number of grounds.
First, the fact that quite a number of creole compounds have one-to-one correspondences in the substratum can be explained by transfer, or more specifically, calquing of L1 complex words into the creole. This process is amply
416

attested in language contact situations (Winford 2003: 44) and is a natural compensatory strategy for the lack of lexical items. This means that what looks as concatenation principles and the semantics of the substratum can be a result of calquing of a number of words. Beside complex words that resemble the substratum words semantically, there are also a number of words which bear great similarities to English, or to no source at all. I have also shown that most semantic patterns of Early Sranan N-N, A-N and V-N compounds are also attested crosslinguistically. In general, many of Early Sranan words cannot be traced to any source, and are innovations coined according to the word-formation patterns that arose as a result of different types of processes and influences.
Second, most types of compounds attested in Early Sranan are also attested in the substratum. However, the claim that the creole compounding is determined by or modelled on the substratum is difficult to maintain since most of the Early Sranan productive compounding patterns are attested in both substratum and superstratum, and are also common cross-linguistically.
Beside these specific problems with the emergence of creole wordformation within Relexification Hypothesis, there are some general problems. First, Lefebvre’s (1998: 303-348) account of relexification in word-formation is based on a comparison between Haitian and mainly one of its substratum languages, Fongbe. As I have shown for Early Sranan here, involving other major substratum languages into analysis causes a much more complex picture, and calls for explanations of several phenomena, such as interaction between different substratum languages. Although Lefebvre (1998) uses the concept of levelling to account for such interactions, I have shown that levelling can be used to explain how the differences might have disappeared, but not why they did so. Involving other factors, such as processing factors and socio-historical ones, is crucial in this respect.
The findings of the present investigation also bear implications for creolisation accounts that view semantic transparency as the determining factor of creole genesis (Seuren and Wekker 1986: 64; 68) or regard structural reduction as crucial attribute of creole genesis (McWhorter 2004: 77).
The problem with the ‘semantic transparency approach’ is that it tries to explain all the complexity of creole formation with one factor, or one mechanism. Seuren and Wekker (1986: 64) argue that the maximisation of semantic
417

transparency involves three strategies: uniformity, i.e. maximal uniformity in treating semantic categories and few arbitrary grammatical distinctions; universality, i.e. minimal reliance on language-particular rules; and simplicity, i.e. minimal processing needed to get from semantic analyses to surface structures and vice versa. Although it has been demonstrated that such factors as semantic and morphotactic transparency and structural simplicity played a role in the emergence of Early Sranan word-formation, especially in constraining transfer from L1, it is erroneous to assume that Early Sranan word-formation system was created under the premise of maximum transparency.
First, as every language, Early Sranan tolerates a number of less transparent processes, such as non-iconic reduplications, multifunctionality and numerous non-transparent complex words (see also Braun and Plag 2003 for a more detailed overview) which must have emerged already at the very initial stages of creolisation.
Second, semantic and morphotactic transparency are factors that play a role especially at the early stages of the emerging creole. However, they seem to be less crucial during later stages, especially when language-internal developments take place and when semantically and structurally more complex constructions, such non-iconic approximative reduplication and V-N-N compounding in Early Sranan come into being.
Third, it has also been shown that some of the major substratum languages of Early Sranan, the Gbe languages, are characterized by a fair amount of analytical and transparent word-formation processes, which makes it difficult to hold the influence of the substratum and the semantic transparency apart.
In conclusion, Seuren and Wekker’s tendency towards maximum transparency can be regarded as only one of the many factors that influence the emerging creole system, but not the decisive one, and also not the end-point of the creole systems.
Turning now to the ‘simplification’ position held by McWhorter (2004), several remarks can be drawn in its respect from the present work. McWhorter argues that creole languages exhibit less elaborate, or ‘younger’ grammars compared to both their lexifiers and their substratum languages, as well as other ‘older’ languages of the world. This lesser degree of complexity is, among other things, manifested in creoles’ lesser overt specification of grammatical
418

distinctions that are “ornamental, rather than vital, to human expression” (McWhorter 2004: 78). By comparing Saramaccan and its substratum language Fongbe in different areas of grammar, McWhorter (2004) shows that one of the significant processes operating in creolisation is overall structural reduction on different linguistic levels. McWhorter shows that in comparison to Fongbe, Saramaccan shows less ‘overspecification’ in that it, for instance, has two tones whereas Fongbe has two phonological and two phonetic tones, or one case marker instead of two in Fongbe, or only two derivational markers instead of eight or nine in Fongbe etc. McWhorter (2004: 79) attributes these differences in overspecification to their social history, in particular, to their young age.
The results of the analysis done in the present work support McWhorter’s assumption that reduction was one of the processes involved in the emergence of Early Sranan word-formation. Thus, several of the substratum and all of the superstratum markers, as well as some of compounding patterns did not enter the creole system, at least at the beginning. In the sense of the general number of specific markers for derivational categories, the Early Sranan system shows less overspecification: whereas Fongbe, English, and Kikongo use affixes or specific markers to create ordinal numerals, or inversive, Early Sranan does not mark them overtly.
However, applying the concept of overspecification to creole wordformation along the lines presented in McWhorter (2004) bears some problematic points.
First, the mere quantitative comparison of the creole markers and those of the substratum languages is problematic on methodological grounds. Thus, different creole languages have different inventories which are sometimes comparable to the creole inventory. It is unclear then how different substratum languages can be weighted in such a comparison.
Second, the reduction processes in Early Sranan word-formation went hand in hand with other processes which make it difficult to decide whether we can indeed speak of underspecification. For instance, in the case of the Early Sranan gender markers and the person marker, the reduction in the overt form went hand in hand with the expansion in functions. Thus, Fongbe, Ewe, Twi, Kikongo and English, all use more than one person marker and more than one set of gender markers. Early Sranan uses one form for each, but with the same range
419

of functions that is fulfilled by several markers in the source languages. It means then that overt reduction was paralleled by covert functional expansion.
Third, the reduction process was also paralleled by the emergence of different compensatory processes in the area of word-formation. For instance, Twi and Kikongo make use of instrumental affixes. Sranan does not have such an affix. However, Sranan uses reduplication, compounding with -sanni (‘thing’) and multifunctionality to create nouns with instrumental meanings. The question that arises then is: should the availability of a certain affix for a certain derivational category be treated as a sign of overspecification, whereas the use of free morphemes and compounding in the same function as a sign of underspecification?
Finally, it is arguable whether underspecification is attributable to creole’s young age alone. In the case of Early Sranan word-formation, it can be attributed to at least two factors. First, some of the substratum languages, such as Ewe and Twi, can also be argued to lack ‘overspecification’ since they use a relatively small number of markers which is comparable to Early Sranan. Second, the possible lack of such overspecification already in the superstratum input because of the dramatic socio-historical situation (cf. Migge 2003a: 125). The presence of overspecifed features in older languages is then possibly attributable not only to their old age, but also to the fact that they do not emerge in the socio-historical situations comparable to radical creole genesis and are not instances of SLA (cf. Plag 2005). Besides, if overspecification should be a feature of more mature age, we must expect older languages not to lose it over time. However, this is not necessarily the case. English for instance, gradually developed towards less overspecification in some areas of its grammar, e.g. grammatical gender.
To sum up, the problems presented here cannot, and do not aim to undermine McWhorter’s approach. They are solely meant to show that since creole formation is an extremely complex and many-sided process, a rather rigorous methodology is necessary to provide a uniform explanation for most phenomena of creole grammar.
In general, one of the major implications of the present research is that a ‘pure view’ of creole formation, be it ‘superstratist’, ‘substratist’ or ‘universalist’ cannot be maintained because creole languages undergo influence from both substratum and superstratum languages, and they do not use one specific strategy
420

in the process of their emergence. The challenge for the future research is then to unify the different approaches within an ‘intermediate’ framework that pays tribute to the complexity of the creolisation process.
One of such ‘intermediate views’ has recently been given a clear and substantiated form in Migge’s (2003a) account of the emergence of Surinamese creoles (cf. also Siegel 1999, Thomason 2001: 180-183; Winford 2002; 2003 for similar views). Migge regards creolisation as akin to SLA and assumes that creole creators targeted the contact varieties of the superstratum and reinterpreted them using their L1s models and general contact-specific strategies such as simplification, regularisation, etc. As Migge (2003a: 51; 129) puts it, the basic structures of the European language functioned as the main frame upon which L1 structures were projected. Therefore, target variety structures that could not be interpreted by creole creators did not enter the emerging creole system, and L1 models for which a corresponding structure in the target variety could not be identified were not preserved.
In terms of the processes involved in creolisation the findings of the present study confirm the essential aspects of this position. First, it has been shown here that the mechanisms and constraints underlying the development of Early Sranan word-formation are similar to those documented for SLA (Broeder et al. 1993). Second, Early Sranan creators borrowed some English complex words, used at least some of the target variety structures (e.g. English mancompounds) and the target variety order of elements in compounds as models for the emerging word-formation patterns. This speaks in favour of the assumption that creole creators targeted the varieties of the superstratum. Third, the present analysis has also shown that creole creators extensively involved their L1 knowledge and simplification strategies when creating word-formation means and expanding their lexicon.
However, Migge’s assertion (2003a: 129) that the European structures functioned as “building blocks” for creole structures can only partially be supported for Early Sranan word-formation. Although in one case, that of the person marker, it can be suggested that English structures functioned as frames into which substratum patterns were ‘inserted’, no superstratum structures could have served as such frames in the case of all the other markers and of some wordformation patterns, such as V-N-N compounding or reduplication. This fact also
421

shows that Migge’s (2003a: 128) assumption that only those L1 structures were retained for which functional and formal parallels in the target variety could be identified cannot be confirmed for the word-formation system of Early Sranan.
Besides, I see a general problem with Migge’s term ‘frame’ or ‘building block’ when applied to word-formation. It is not clear when we can speak of a European structure functioning as a ‘frame’ for the substratum structure. Taking the example of the diminutive marker pikíen-, we can assume that creole creators encountered structures in the target variety, where the meaning of pikíen was identifiable as ‘small’ and as ‘child’. Since these are the meanings the diminutive markers had in the substratum languages, creole creators started transferring complex words containing the diminutive markers in their L1 using the item pikíen-. Can we argue then that superstratum structures with pikíen- served as ‘frames’ into which substratum words containing diminutive markers were inserted? The answer is no, since de facto, it is not the structures with pikíen in the target variety, but its meaning that came to play a crucial role in its association with the diminutive markers from the L1s of creole creators.
Nevertheless, Migge’s approach is generally valuable in that it shows how complex the interaction between different input structures in creole formation is and what multiple mechanisms are operating in it.
To conclude, without denying the value of theoretical generalisations in respect to creole genesis, I believe that the general problem with each type of creolisation theory lies in the strive to work out the ultimate, universally applicable scenario of creolisation. This, however, is a problematic task since different creoles underwent different ways of emergence in socio-historical terms, and different linguistic systems within one language may also undergo different developments. For instance, Sranan had a rather different development in the sphere of derivational morphology than Haitian. And the emergence of word formation of a given creole language can go a different path than, the emergence of the TMA system. As a matter of fact, there is no one ‘recipe’ for creolisation of different languages and even different linguistic systems. Quite often, unfortunately, we are also plainly unable to put all the stones of the creolisation mosaic together because of the lack of the necessary information, be it historical, linguistic or other. The challenge is then not to show what the ‘ultimate, everholding’ scenario of creolisation might be, but to describe, for each particular
422

language and language system, the mechanisms, strategies, influencing factors and constraints leading to their emergence in all their interacting and interconnected complexity.

Appendix

Conventions
a question mark (?)

indicates that a given morpheme is not attested independently in the three sources used in the present study and that its meaning is therefore not synchronically identifiable.

exclamation mark (!) indicates that a morpheme is not attested independently, but its meaning is identifiable since it is attested in a number of other words.

a question mark (?) after a Latin term for animal and plant names

is adopted from Focke (1855) and indicates that the author was unsure about the correcness of the information provided.

an asterisk (*)

means that the exact translation of a word or an expression was not provided by the author of the source and/or the translation is unclear because, for instance, of the lack of the necessary context.

opaque

refers to cases of reduplication without independently attested bases.
