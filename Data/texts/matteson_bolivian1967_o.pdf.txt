Ten grammars of indigenous Bolivian languages are presented in the two volumes of Bolivian Indian Grammars. The data were gathered and analyzed by members of the Bolivia Branch of the summer Institute of Linguistics, which has carried on l i m i s t i o investigations in this country since 1955.
The corpus on which each grammar has been baaed was closed far short of an exhaustive treatment. Nevertheless each analysis is based on a minlmum of ZOO pages of text dictated spontaneously. Gaps in the patterns have been filled in by elicited materials, but no patterns have been established on the basls of ellcited materials alone. Most of the linguists have not only gathered far more than the minimum amount of texts, but have also become fluent in speaking the languages, and intimately acquainted with the culture through years of living In the tribal villages.
The grammars are presented in the tagmemic model1 of Pike with adaptatlon of the matrices2 and syntax paradigms3 developed by him, as well aa the basic concepts which characterize the tagmemic model: (1)the postulation of three hierarchies, the phonologioal, grammatical, and lexical o r semantic: (2) the segmentation of the construction occurring on a given level into a string4 of tagmemes manifested by lower-level constructions or units: (3) the definition of the tagmeme as a class-slot correlative with an obligatory versus optional (+or?) characteristic; (4) the assumption that units and patterns exist in a language: (5) the stipulation that a well-defined unit be described in t e r m of identificational-contrastive features, variants, and distribution: and (6) the establishment of emic (versus etic) units.

BOLIVIAN INDIAN GRAMMARS: I

The grammars begin with a description of the highest level f o r which a formal definition has been described, and proceed from level to level, ending with roots and affixes. Each construction which' manifests a tagmeme in the formulas i s analysed on a lower level, o r , in case of recursive constructions, on the same o r a hlgher level. Rewrite operations5 for the generation of sentences from the formulas a r e not explicit, but a r e implicit in the grammars. By substituting each formula o r lexical unit for its symbol, from the highest level to the root and affix, the grammar generates the grammatical sequences of the language insofar as the grammar and lexicon are correct and complete.
In these volumes of grammars which are uniform in underlying theory and general form of presentation, a comparison of sets of matrices might serve as a guide o r outline for typological studies. For example, a glance at the clause matrices of Chacobo and Quechua immediately calls attention to major structural differences between the two languages: the basic cleavage between transitive and intransitive, and between complete and incomplete in the Chacobo, whereas these categories a r e relatively unimportant in Quechua, which emphasizes an dfirmative-negative set of contraste. Both of these languages have very complex clause structures, but the complexity in the Chacobo is in markedly different areas than that in the Quechua. A comparison of the clause matrices of these two languages with that of Movima again emphasizes the differences in the general structure of the languages.
On Ule other hand a comparison of sets of matrices for the purpose of establishing o r corroborating a genetic relationship is sometimes or in some areas fruitful, sometimes not. It would be difficult to argue a relationship between the Tupi-guaranlan Sirion6 and Guarani on the basis of Chart I of the Guaranigrammar (Guaran[ 1.1) and Chart I, which most nearly corresponds to it in the Sirion6 grammar (Sirion6 2.3.1), although minor features of the grammars a r e strikingly alike. The combination of function words on the clause level (Sirion6 2.3.3. and 4.12) and of particles in the verb phrase (Sirion6 3.1.2) which a r e peculiar to Sirion6 corresponds very closely to the clutter of clitic particles of the verb phrase periphery which i s characteristic of Guarani (Guarani 2.1.3). Likewise the series of predicates P I , P2, P3, P4 and the anteverb within one clause in Guarani (1.1.2) a r e parallel to the series of dependent clauses filling

Sat slots in the content string (Sirion6 2.3.1.2) and the preverb in the verb phrase (Sirion6 3.1.2) of Sirion6.
The comparison of clause matrices in the Arawakan languages is more encouraging. Those of Baure (Chart JI, 2.1.1) and Ignaoiano (Chart 1, 2.1.1.1) show noteworthy similarities as well as dWerences. In the Taoanan family the matrices of the clause, verb phrase, and verb of Taoana and Eseejja suggest similarity of structure, al&ugh some major differences appear (Eseejja Chart I, 2.1. l , Chart 11, 3.1.1, and Chart III, 4.1.1: Tacana Chart I, 2.1, Chart Il 3.2;1, andChartN, 4.1.1.1).
In noting both oontrasts and similarities consideration must he given to dlfferencee in presentation which reflect the linguist's preferenoes rather than structural contrasts. An instance is the apparent difference between the Eseejja and Taoana verb oharts, due to the presenoe of the quotative verbs 40 and 50 in Eseejja and the auxiliary verbs 50 in Taoana. This difference is eaeily determined to be primarily one of presentation by comparing the roots of the two sets of verbs (Eseejja 4.1.8.1 and Taoana 4.1.4), and their ultimate distribution in the quotative clauses (Eseejja 2.1.2 and 9.1.2.1; Taoana
2.2.2).
The comparison of the independent, dependent, and included clause matrices of Queohua (Chart I, 2.1.1 with those of Aymara (unpublished grammar notes by Warkentin, Heaalip, McNeil of the Summer Institute of Linguistics) shows a very strlklng similarity.
Below are listed a few of the features which for theoretical reasons or as a demonstration of techniques cbarecteristic of the tagmemic model may be of special interest.
(1)In Baure the formation of verbs from nominal bases is of suoh high frequewy that it is economical to classlfy the noun roots to correspondwiththeverbroots (Baure 4.1.1.2.3.1 and4.1.4.1).
(2) In lgnaoiano the skewing of hierarchies is noteworthy (Igna-
ciano, end of 2). Also the Ignaaiano grammar demonstrates devices for separatiw distribution from composition classes, introduoing the former at the first level on whbh they are relevant, rather than carrying them through various levels for which they have no slgniflcance as has sometimes been done beoause of their correlation o r partial correlation to composition classes. (Jgnaoiano 4.2.2.1, 4.2.4.1, 4.2.6. 4.3.1.1.1. 4.3.1.2). Suoh devbee are not limited to use in the Ignaaiano grammar.
(3) Complex and discontinuous verb phrases in Tacana reoeive quite diffarent treatment from that given very similar ones in Eswjja (Tacana 3.1 and 3.2; Eseejja 3.1).

(4) In Eseejja postclitics previously considered to he affixes are

interpreted as separate words each capable of affiiation, in order to

solve an otherwise baffling problem of affix order (Eseejja 3.1.2.3.3).

(5) In Chacobo the extension of the transitive-intransitive oleav-

age extends from sentence level (Chacobo 2.1.2) to verb root

(6.1.1.5. I), even being marked in the clause margin8 (3.1.1 and 3.2)

and noun phrases (4.31.

explained by means of notes and illustrations.

Generally in the tagmemic model units are conaidered to be in

emic contrast on the basis of two structural differences6. These

may be two differences in composition (one of which may be reccg-

nized by differerne in transform potential) which necessitate the

writing of separate formulas, or, following Pike, they may be one

structural difference and one difference in distribution. For the

purposes of these volumes we have further defined the basis of emic

distinction as follows: A difference in distribution together with a

difference in class of slot fillers which is relevant on different levels

and/or is correlated with other emic distinctions (such as the differ-

ence in the lists of transitive and intransitive verbs in most languages)

establishes emic contrast: however, a difference in distribution plus

a difference in lists of slot fillers which are primariiy semantically

determined doea not establish emic contrast. For example, we may

describe one phrase, N 1, as manifesting both time and looation tag-

memes, although the time slot i s filled only by a list of those phrases

whioh include a word indicating time, while the location slot is filled

by a different list of those phrases which include a word indicating

... place : ...+ T:N 1 +L:N 1

When only one difference between the formulas of two emic

classes is apparent, a difference in distribution is to be assumed.

In two of the grammars, the Chaoobo and Baure, it was found

economical to desoribe the nuclei of the clauses separately from the

margins. The resultant distinction between clause and clause nucleus

is not considered to be a bona fide difference in level. The clauses

are therefore shown as emioally different, although the formula8 com-

bining nuclei and margins show that only the nuclei contrast.

We have not tested ail combinations implied in the formulas. In

a language with a great many clause classes with numerous marginal

'Pike, 1962 and Longacre, 1964.

tagmemes each manifested by a variety of classes of construotions,

the potential number of combinations is astronomical. In such cases

when no restriction is apparent we have assumed that all possible

combinations occur.

Wherever it has been a matter of ohoice we have kept the hlgher

levels simple at the expense of complexiQr on the lower levels.

Pike's technique of multipllcation'l is frequently used: that is,

each unit of,amatrix (or each formula of a paradigm) is modified in

the same way so that a corresponding matrix is established.

Co-occurrent tagmemes are said to be in portmanteau relatlon-

ship when they are manifested sirmtltaneously by the same oonstruc-

tion.

When the formulas of a tagmemic paradlgm are identical with the

formulas of the tagmatic paradlgm except for the slot fillers, the

fillers are shown in the tagmendo paradlgm, and the tagmatic para-

dlgm is omitted.

When there is variation of order of tagmemes the most frequent

m rase order is shown in the formula, and the variations are described.

In tagmemic grammars a

is generally described as a oon-

structlon involving an obllgatory tagmeme and at least one other tag-

meme, obligatory or optional. For the grammars in these volumes

the phrase is better defined as a unlt of the level between clause and

word, whloh characteristically manifests a clause-level tagmeme.

For economy of description in some instances we have treated as a

phrase a single tagmeme manifested by one word, a unit which cannot

be expanded, when it shares the distribution of a class of phrases.

In many of the grammars there are hesitation words did may

interrupt any construction on any level. We have described the oc-

currence of the hesitation only where it is frequent or characteristic.

In the matrices each vector is represented by a millenlum, cen-

tury, decade or unlt, in an arrangement such that the item in each

cell is deslgnatad by a combination of the numerical symbols of the

row and vector. For example in Chart I, Emic Clause Classes, of

Quechua (2. I), the Intr column is numbered 30, and the ig oorr row

is numbered 02. The symbol C 1 30 refers to any intransitive clause;

that is, to any of the clauses 31a to 34b. The symbol C1 02 refers to

any interrogative corroborative clause, that is, to C1 12, 22, 32,

42, or 52. The symbol C1 38 refers to the intransitive interrogative

corroborative clause. Slmllarly a row symbol 103 may be oombined

BOLIVIAN INDIAN GRAMMARS: I
with decade symbols of the columna to produce the symbols 113, 123, etc.
In general the order of formulas in the paradigms follows column by column the order of the corresponding matrix.
In the abbreviations lower case letters symbolize units which fill slots on the morphological level. The symbols of all higher level units and of all tagmemes begin with capitals. l'he sentence is labeled Sent, and the clause, C1: a construction whose symbol begins with a capital and whioh has no other indioation of level, may be assured to be a phrase: i.e. N is to be read " ~ u pnhrase, " n is to be read "noun." The list of abbreviations gives only the forms with capitals. except in those oases in whioh the form with capital is not employed.
In citations of the indigenous language, however, capital letters a r e morphophonemic symbols, which a r e explained in the morphophonemic section of each grammar. Citations are written morphophonemioally only where the morphophonemic form 1s particularly relevant.
In citations of the indigenous languages, the intonation contours are approximately marked by punctuation. Beyond that the contours a r e identified only to the extent that they are essential to the description of the grammar.
Class and numerical symbols a r e generally given together, except that affixes are symbolized by the numerical symbol alone. When, however, an affix numbered under a particular word class occurs in the composition of a different word class, that affix is shown with class symbol a s well as numerical symbol:
vb stem 1 2 = ...+Caw: 3217, but
nstem4=+...-Caus:vb affk3217. Distribution classes of roots and constmctions as well as mor-
phophonemic classes are to be marked in the lexicon of a language. Loans a r e generally treated as roots.
N not followed by a numerical symbol, symdolizes any noun phrase.
A series designated by a hyphen refers to any one member of the series unless otherwise specified. The symbol C1 11-34 refers to any one clause numbered from 11 to 34. The symbol vb A-L refers to any one verb with a letter symbol from A to L of the alphabet.
If the formula of C1 11-34 includes a corresponding series, for example if it contains the tagmeme +P: Vb 11-34,it is to be assumed that in each clause of the series the numerical symbol within the formula will be identical with the numerical symbol of the clause. This means that in the example above the predicate of C1 23 will be manifested by Vb 23.

+(+A +B) indicates that the occurrence together of the tagmemes A and B is optional but that neither occurs without the other.
+(+A +B) indicates that the occurrence of tagmeme A or of the two tagmemes together is optional, but that tagmeme B does not occur without tagmeme A.
+(+A +B) indicates that the occurrence of either one of the tagmemzsor of the two tagmemes together is obligatory.
+/+/ - indicates that the occurrence d a tagmeme is optional
under stated conditions, and obligatory under other conditions, and
... that it does not fficur under other stated conditions. ( )" indicates that the parenthetical item is optionally repeated an indefinite number of times.
T~ indicates that the tagmeme T optionally occurs up to three times in a construction. In mcrphophonemic writing a superscript merely distinguishes symbols.
T 1, T 2 symbolize hvo tagmemes which are formally contrastive although they are similar in function.
The formula +Base: n r 1/4 Resl8jvb r 10 +Cpd: n r 3 AS is to
be read as follows: the obligatory Base tagmeme manifested by a
noun root of class 1, by members of a restricted list of noun roots 4. by a noun r w t of class 8, or by a verb root 10: plus the obligatory tagmeme Compound manifested by members of noun root claes 3 which arbltrarlly select flllers of the Base slot with which to occur.
The symbol Res is thus employed of an etic class which is rele-
vant at only one point in the grammar. The list of n r 2 Res in one
formula is assumed to be a different list from that of n r 2 Res in another formula in the same language.
In the tagmeme +Base: n r 2 (imo), the form cited in the parenthesls is the only n r 2 which manifests the Base.
when corresponding slot symbols are diiferentiated by number in tagmemic formulas, the number may be omitted in the tagmatic formula when the fillers clearly show the diiferentiation: P 22 and
P 23 in the tagmemic formulas may be written as P: Vb 22 and P: Vb 23 respectively in the tagmatic formulas.

In the following formulas, the tagmemes listed before the P tagmeme a r e fixed in order. The mutual order of all other tagmemes i s optional. The tagmeme which i s emphasized occurs after the Intro and before the Neg tagmernes. The S tagrneme, when manifested by a pronoun, optionally occurs before the Intro tagmeme. The Voc tagmeme optionally occurs between the Neg and P tagmemes. The Hes tagmerne optionally interrupts any construction on any level, any number of times. When manifested by the hesitation word pro 10, it occurs only before nouns o r pronouns. In C1 33 the Neg tagmeme obligatorily occurs immediately preceding the P.
In the following formulas, the tagmeme which is emphasized in the Ig Clauses 03 occurs in portrnanteau relationship with the Q tagmeme, being manifested by the same word o r phrase which manifests the Q tagmeme.

We so generally expect intonation to group clauses into sentences that intonation i s conventionally included a s a feature of grammar, a s in the various articles of this volume. We have indeed included it in this grammar. However, in Ignaciano the intonation does not serve a s a criterion for joining or separating clauses. The typical sentenceclosure intonation, a contour ending with 1-2-I+, frequently occurs dep-clausef inal. It also occurs only a little less frequently phrase-final on the filler of a subject, time, location, o r other slot. A non-

final contour 1-2-2J. occurs sometimes on phrases in series, on dependent clauses, and on the first of two clauses of the type which we would prefer to join on a semantic basis; however, series of clauses not
closely related semantically not infrequently occur
with this same non-final contour. Examples of the type cited above have been
treated in the grammar a s two separate clauses. We have sought in vain for any grammatical basis on which to join the semantically related clauses.
Some sequences have been joined a s complex clauses (see 2.1.2.) on the basis of a construction
overtly shared by two consecutive clauses, usually a common negative o r an object of one clause serving
a s the subject of the other. Some sequences have been joined by positing an auxiliary-head relationship between the two verbs (see 3.1). This latter attempted solution is particularly unsatisfactory. One of the two differences between two verbs mani-
festing the predicates of consecutive independent
clauses, and two verbs with the posited relationship, i s the arbitrary listing of thirty-six verbs a s "auxiliary "; the other difference is a partial restriction on the inflectional affixation of the auxiliary
verb. Some of the auxiliaries occur with two principal verbs, analyzed as"Head " and "Coordinate ". The verb phrase including the auxiliary occurs with the frequency of one instance per 11 clauses of text and i s occasionally discontinuous.

2. 2.2. Tagmatic independent clause paradigm
In the following formulas, the order of the tagmemes i s free, with the following exceptions: The tagmeme i/-Abil follows the Dub, which occupies the third position in the clause. Neg 1 and Neg 3 precede the P tagmeme; Neg 2 follows the P tagmeme. The C1 j occurs either clause-initial, clause-final, o r both.
Collocational restrictions a r e indicated in the formulas of C1 01, 02, and 03 a s follows: */-Abil indicates that the tagmeme i s optional when part 2 kua Abilitative occurs in the verb phrase; it does not otherwise occur. The symbol +/-Neg 3 indicates that the tagmeme is obligatory when the affix 1131 -hi

In general not more than 5 tagmemes occur in the independent clause.
When a S tagmeme i s manifested by a pronoun it most frequently occurs contiguous to the P tagmeme.
In the tr clauses when the S, 0, and Ref tagmemes precede the P, their mutual order varies freely; in clauses 02b and 04b the 0 and R tagmemes optionally follow the P. Tagmemes of Margin B a r e optionally interspersed among the nuclear tagmemes.
Subjects of clauses 02a and 04a may also occur after the P tagmeme. When they a r e the only tagmemes in a sentence the order is P followed by S. C1 nuc 11 = [&:N nuc 401/403 +P:Vb 11 *S:N nuc
