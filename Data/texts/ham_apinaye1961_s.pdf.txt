1. Introduction.
The levels in the Apinaye grammatical hierachy to be discussed in this paper are as follows: Sentence, Clause, Phrase, Word, Stem, Morpheme. Phonologically determined MorphoPhonemics will be written only within words.

1.1. Sentence level.
1.1.1. Definition. A sentence may be a single clause or a sequence of clauses, ± certain slots relevant only
at sentence level. Any such sentence may constitute a complete utterance or fill a slot at some higher level.

1.1.2. There are both simple and complex sentences. 1.1.2.1. Complex sentences.
1.1.2.1.1. Independent + Independent.
iñmʌ̃ pico ŋõ+pa kukrɛ̃ me to banana give I it-eat

"Give me a banana and I'll eat it."

1.1.2.1.2. Independent + Dependent. nã pa ɔmu nɛ̃ ʔapro did I it-see and it-buy
1.1.2.2. Simple sentences. 1.1.2.2.1. Independent clause.
nã pa pico zapro did I banana buy

"I saw it and bought it." "I bought a banana."

1.1.2.2.2. Independent clause + certain sentence level spots such as address, quotation.

cʌ nã Sit apumu query did Sit you-see

"Did Sit see you?"

1.2. Clause level.
1.2.1. Definition. The clause is a unit filling a slot on the sentence level which has as its minimum either a
Subject-Predicate, Subject-Complement, or Topic-Comment relationship.

2

1.2.2. There are two major types of clauses. 1.2.2.1. Predicative. 1.2.2.1.1. Predicative clauses are of two major types. 1.2.2.1.1.1. Temporal. 1.2.2.1.1.2. Habitual.
1.2.2.1.2. Temporal and Habitual clauses. Both Temporal and Habitual are further sub-divided into Transitive and Intransitive type
clauses. 1.2.2.1.3. Temporal clauses types are of three basic types. 1.2.2.1.3.1. Indicative. 1.2.2.1.3.2. Intentive. 1.2.2.1.3.3. Imperative.
1.2.2.2. Non-Predicative. 1.2.2.2.1. Equational. 1.2.2.2.2. Existential.
1.3. Phrase level. The phrase is a potential sequence of two or more words, which function as a unit and fill
a slot on the clause level. The two types of phrases are: 1.3.1. Noun phrases. 1.3.2. Verb phrases.
1.4. Word level. A word consists of one or more stems ± affixes filling a slot in a phrase. There are four
classes of words. 1.4.l. Noun Words. 1.4.2. Verb Words. 1.3.3. Descriptive Words. 1.4.4. Relational Words.
1.5. Stem level. A stem consists of one or more morphemes, which form a unit with potential for
affixation, filling a slot on the word level. There are four classes of stems:
3

1.5.1. Noun stems. 1.5.2. Verb stems. 1.5.3. Descriptive stems. 1.5.4. Relational stems.

1.6. Morpheme level. Morphemes are minimal meaningful units. They are divided into three classes, each
filling slots at different levels,
1.6.1. Functionals. Functional morphemes fill slots on the clause level. They are phonologically free, but do
not occur in isolation.
1.6.2. Affixes. Affixes are morphemes which fill slots on the word level.
1.6.3. Roots. Roots are morphemes which fill slots on the stem level. There are four classes of roots.
1.6.3.1. Noun roots. 1.6.3.2. Verb roots. 1.6.3.3. Descriptive roots. 1.6.3.4. Relational roots.

2. The hierarchical structure in detail.
2.1. Sentence level structure.
2.1.1. Definition. A sentence may be a single clause or a sequence of clauses, ± certain slots relevant only
at sentence level. Any such sentence may constitute a complete utterance or fill a slot at some higher level.

2.1.2. Internal structure. 2.1.2.1. Simple sentences consist of one independent clause.

nã pa ñɨ ̃ did I sit

"I sat."

2.1.2.2. Complex sentences consist of:
2.1.2.2.1. Independent + Independent clauses. kɔt iñne ket pa ma tɛ̃ fut. me-keep neg. I away go

"If he doesn't keep me, I'll go."

4

N.B. nɛ̃ clause "being" type marker, only occurs pause group final, therefore when the first clause in a complex sentence is a "being" type (+nɛ)̃ (the nɛ̃ then would be pause group medial), the nɛ̃ disappears. Any two independent clauses can be together in one sentence with the only change being the absence of this nɛ.̃

2.1.2.2.2. Independent + Dependent, joined by connector nɛ̃ or ñũm.

iñmʌ̃ ʔɔ amɛc̃ krut nɛ̃ aŋõ

me-to with two

and it-give

"give me two" (lit. "two it and give it to me")

pa mã tɛ̃ nɛ̃ nõ I away go and lie

"I'm going and lie down."

N.B. As mentioned in 2.1.2.2.2., Being clause type nɛ̃ also disappears when followed in the same sentence by a dependent clause. The nɛ̃ left in this case is the connector "and", which only occurs pause group medial.
2.1.2.2.3. Independent clause + Sentence Level tagmeme. 2.1.2.2.3.1. Address tagmeme.
This slot always occurs initial in a sentence.

mʌz̃ pa kapɛ kapõ mother I outdoors sweep

"Mother, I'll sweep outdoors."

2.1.2.2.3.2. Response tagmeme. This always occurs initial also.

ə nã pa ra

ɔmu

yes did I already it-see

"Yes, I've already seen it."

2.1.2.2.3.3. Question tagmeme. This may be preceded by the Address slot.
2.1.2.2.3.3.1. Independent clause + question marker. cʌ nã ka ɔmu query did you it-see

"Did you see it?"

mɔ kacɨv nã ka ʔapro

why

did you it-buy

"Why did you buy it?"

5

2.1.2.2.3.3.2. Independent clause in which the Object slot is taken out of the clause and replaced initially with a question word.

mɔ nã ka ʔapro what did you it-buy

"What did you buy?"

2.1.2.2.3.4. Quotation tagmeme. This is composed of a Relational1 slot (filled by kʌ̃m) preceded by ± Tense ± Subject
slots. The end of the quotation is usually followed by an "end quote" nɛ.̃

nã kʌm̃ nã pa ra

ŋõr nɛ̃

did to-her did I already sleep

"He said, 'I've already slept.' "

This may be reduced by dropping the Tense and Relational slots, leaving Subject only.

ka nã pa ɔmu nɛ̃ you did I it-see

"You say, 'I saw it.'"

Or by dropping the Tense and Subject slots, leaving the Relational slot.

kʌ̃m nã pa nɨ ̃ nɛ̃ to her did I sit

"Tell her, 'I've already sat.' "

2.1.2.2.3.5. Emphasis tagmeme.
A slot may be emphasized by taking it out of its normal place within a sentence and putting it at the beginning in an Emphasis slot. The slots, which may occur in the Emphasis slot, are: Subject, Object, Relational, and occasionally Aspect. Words in this slot are emphatically stressed, and there is a slight break before the rest of the sentence.

kokoz nã pa ɔmu monkey did I it-see

"It was a monkey that I saw."

2.1.2.2.3.5.1. When the Subject in the Emphasis slot is a pronoun (ka, pa) the Subject is repeated in its normal place after the Tense slot.

pa nã pa ʔapro I did I it-buy

"I was the one who bought it."

6

2.1.2.2.3.5.2. When, in a Habitual clause type, the Subject or Object is in the Emphasis slot, certain obligatory slots must occur with it. The occurrence of the additional slots is conditioned by the alternate order (presence of Emphasis slot).

2.2. The clause level structure.
2.2.1. Introduction. 2.2.1.1. Definition.
The clause is a unit filling a slot on the sentence level, which has as its minimum either a Subject-Predicate, Subject-Complement, or Topic-Comment relationship.

2.2.1.2. There are two main independent clause types: Predicative and Non-Predicative.
2.2.1.2.1. Predicative. Predicative has as a minimum some type of predication. Predicative clauses are of two
types.

2.2.1.2.1.1. Transitive
Transitive clauses, which have an obligatory object. This object may be manifested in one of three ways in any given clause:

2.2.1.2.1.1.1. In a separate object slot. Tense Subj. Obj. Pred. nã pa pico zapro did I banana buy

"I bought a banana."

2.2.1.2.1.1.2. As a person prefix object, bound to the verb in the Predicate slot.

Tense Subj. Obj.-Pred.

nã pa a-pumu did I you-see

"I saw you."

7

2.2.1.2.1.1.3. In the verb itself, when the object is not specifically expressed.

Tense Subj. Pred.

nã pa kuka did I it-roast

"I roasted it."

2.2.1.2.1.2. Intransitive Intransitive clauses, which never take an object, and which usually repeat the subject as a
person prefix on the verb. N.B. It should be noted at this point that in this language there is a difference between first and second person and third person on all levels. This will be explained as relevant.
N.B.B. Verb stems usually have two allomorphs. Allomorph 1 is used in Temporal clause types when the verb occurs slot final.

nã pa ʔapro did I it-buy

"I bought it."

Allomorph 2 is used slot medial, and in Habitual clause types.

nã pa ʔapror ket nɛ̃ did I it-buy neg.

"I didn't buy it."

ictɛ ʔapror I it-buy

"I buy it."

VS1 will refer to verb stems with allomorph 1.
VS2 will refer to verb stems with allomorph 2 of all verbs which have 2 allomorphs, and to allomorph 1 of the others.
2.2.1.2.2. Non-Predicative. Non-Predicative clause types have as a minimum a Subject-Complement or Topic-
Comment relationship. These, as the name states, carry no form of predication, differing in internal structure from the Predicative clause types mainly by the absence of a Predicate slot.
2.2.2. Description of clause types. 2.2.2.1. Predicative clause types are sub-divided into two main types.
2.2.2.1.1. Temporal clause types. This type has the idea of a single action, completed in time. These are further divided
into three classes;
2.2.2.1.1.1. Indicative. 2.2.2.1.1.2. Intentive - intention to carry out an action. 2.2.2.1.1.3. Imperative.
Each of the above sub-classes is further sub-divide into two sub classes:

8

action being - this type has an obligatory nɛ̃ clause marker, occurring final in the clause. 2.2.2.1.2. Habitual clause types. This type carries the idea of a continual action, or something that always occurs,
2.2.2.2. Non-Predicate clause types. These carry no form of predication. There are two types.
2.2.2.2.1. Equational. 2.2.2.2.2. Existential.

2.2.3. Formulas 2.2.3.1. Temporal Indicative

2.2.3.1.1. Two classes of Temporal Indicative clauses

2.2.3.2. Temporal Intentive clause types. 2.2.3.2.1. These are divided into two classes. 2.2.3.2.1.1. Action. Formulas are:
TRANSITIVE 1. Subj. Obj. Pred.1
pa kuveñ pumu I bird see "I'm going to see the bird."
TRANSITIVE 2. Subj. Relat.1 Obj. Pred.1

INTRANSITIVE Subj. Relat.1 Pred.1 pa kʌm̃ icʌkzer ket nɛ̃ I to-her I-call neg. "I'm not going to call her."

N.B. It is possible that there are two more possibilities of formulas in both "temporal Intentive" above and also in "Temporal Imperative" below. Two possibilities in action and being both are probable, and need checking.

2.2.3.2.2. Reduced Minimums. These clauses may be reduced by dropping the Object slot. (Transitive only)

2.2.3.2.2.1. Action clauses.

1. Subj. Pred.1

2.2.3.4. Expansions.
Temporal clause types may be expanded by adding an Aspect slot, which usually follows the Subject; a Number slot which may follow the Subject or precede the Object, Relational, or Predicate slot (precedes Aspect following Subject), a Directional slot which precedes the Predicate or Object, and up to two relational slots which normally precede the object.

24

2.6. Morpheme level structure.
Morphemes are minimal meaningful units, divided into three classes which fill slots at different levels.

2.6.1. Morpheme classes.
2.6.1.1. Function Morphemes are items which fill slots on a clause level. They are phonologically free, but do not occur in isolation. The underlined morphemes below are function morphemes.

nã kʌ̃m kuŋõ "He gave it to her."

nã ʌ̃m mɛ̃ ɔmu "He only saw them."

2.6.2.1. Affixes are morphemes which fill slots on the word level. There are both prefixes and suffixes.

2.6.1.2.1. Prefixes are confined to person markers. 1st and 2nd person markers may occur on any class of word. 3rd person prefixes occur initially or are inherent within the stem.

ic- iaiʔ ʔ

1st person 2rd person 3rd person

(i- before words beginning with c, ñ, z., ic- elsewhere) (iʔ- pause group initial before stops, ʔ- elsewhere)

apa "your arm"

icpɨtĩ "I'm heavy."

iʔpa "his arm"

2.6.1.2.2. Suffixes are divided into two classes, those which occur with all classes of words, and those which occur only with verbs.
2.6.1.2.2.1. Suffixes which occur on all words are size suffixes.

picoti picorɛ

"big banana" (-ti -augmentative) "little banana" (-rɛ - Diminuative)

2.6.1.2.2.2. Suffixes which occur only on verb words are further sub-divided as to occurrence on VS1 or VS2 or Verb II.

2.6.1.2.2.2.1. Suffixes which occur only with VS1.

mʌñ "desiderative"

pa ɔmu mʌñ "I want to see it."

2.6.1.2.2.2.2. Suffixes which occur only with VS2 and Verb Class II.

2.6.1.2.2.2.2.1. Nominalizer.
kuvɨ nĩpeccʌ fire make thing

"fire making thing"

25

2.6.1.2.2.2.2.2. Clause type marker (Mark Being clause).

nã pa iñmʌ̃ pico cʌñ nɛ̃ do I me-to bananas like

"I like bananas."

2.6.1.2.2.2.2.3. Modals. ŋɨ "stop" ñĩ "always"

aceeñi you-lie-always "you habitually lie"

2.6.1.3. Roots are morphemes which fill slots on the stem level. There are four classes of roots.

2.6.1.3.1. Noun roots.

pĩ

"stick"

2.6.1.3.2. Verb roots.

muv

"to cry"

2.6.1.3.3. Descriptive roots.

rac

"big"

2.6.1.3.4. Relational roots.

kep

"from"

ʔipɨ

"on top of"

2.6.1.3.2. There is within and cutting thru the above classes a class of morphemes which change shape on a Morpho-Phonemic basis according to the following rules:
2.6.1.3.2.1. When two morphemes of this class meet, the 1st being an "explicit specifier" (either separate stem of prefix) relationship to the 2nd, the 2nd morpheme changes shape initially. This change may be the addition or change of the initial phoneme, or the drop or change of the initial syllable. The chart below shows each different type of possibility of change in each class. This change may occur between: Object and Predicate, Possessor and Head, Noun and Modifier, Noun and Relational. (The underscored words change shape initially)

2.6.1.3.3.

There is also some phonologically determined Morpho-Phonemics which occurs when two consonants come together at a morpheme juncture. For complete write-up on this occurrence, see the following Linguistic Report of November 1960, Section I.

27

LINGUISTIC REPORT OF NOVEMBER 1960, SECTION I.
BY PAT HAM

I. Morpho-Phonemics: Consonant + Consonant.
A. Compensatory Length. When stops and nasals meet consonants or a glottal stop plus another consonant at the same point of articulation, and when 2 r's meet, the vowel immediately preceding these consonants is lengthened and the first of the 2 consonants drops out unless it is a nasal preceding a stop or a z. The nasal under these conditions is retained.

['ton] [ tɛp] ['pur] ['peñ]

+ [ndɨv] + [mbɛc] + [rac] + [cet]

= [to•'ndɨv] = [tɛ•'mbɛc] = [pu•'rac] = [pe•ñ'cet]

"tatú novo" "good fish" "big field" "burned ball"

Note: /k/ acts like a homo-organic consonant to all consonants except /r/ and /ʔ/, and freely fluctuates as a homo-organic consonant with /v/ and /z/.

['kok] + [pic] = [ko•'pic] ['kok] + [mbɛc] = [ko•'mbɛc]

"just wind" "good wind"

Exceptions: m + v = mv [tɔm] + [vər] = [tɔm'vər]

"to the frickle"

t + r: Vt + r = Vdr ['krit] + [rac] = [krid'rac] Vt̃ + r = Ṽnr ['prõt] + [rac] = [prõn'rac]

"big bug" "big run"

n + r = nr ['ton] + [rac] = [ton'rac]

"big armadillo"

B. Assimilation. At different points of articulation:
1. Stop + Nasal = Nasal + Nasal [mboc] + [ndɨv] = [mboñ'ndɨv]

"new calf

28

2. Stop + Stop = Vl. Stop + Vl. Stop [mboc] + [bɨci] = [mbocpɨ'ci]

"just one cow"

3. Stop + v/z/r = Vd. Stop + v/z/r [mboc] + [rac] = [mboj'rac]

"big cow"

Exceptions: Ṽc + r = Ṽñr [ictõc] + [rac] = [ictõñ'rac]
Both consonants retaining original point of articulation.

"my big sister"
