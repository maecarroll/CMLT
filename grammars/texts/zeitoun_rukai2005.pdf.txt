Abbreviations and conventions

GLOSSING CONVENTIONS Affix boundaries are indicated by a hyphen -. I have not attempted to make any distinction
between clitics (usually preceded or followed by an equals sign) and affixes. Angled brackets <…> are used for infixes. Semi-columns indicate that the word in question is made up of an affix that is not conveniently divisible, e.g., ‘Red:Dyn.NFin:eat’. A dot . stands for a portmanteau morpheme, e.g., ‘Stat.NFin’.
Bound roots are also followed or preceded by a hyphen -, e.g., lili- ‘(female) friend’, -poli ‘white’.
Glosses for pronominal clitics include person and number (if necessary inclusivity and exclusivity) and combine with case, e.g., 1S.Nom = 1st person singular nominative.

Introduction
1.1 GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION A variety of indigenous languages are spoken in Taiwan. They are traditionally referred to as
the “Formosan languages” by opposition to Taiwanese, a term commonly used of one of the dominant Chinese dialects spoken in the island (Ross 1995). They belong to the Austronesian family, which includes a diversity of languages stretching east to west from Madagascar to Hawai‘i and north to south from Taiwan to New Zealand.
Fourteen Formosan languages are still spoken today: Atayal, Saisiyat, Pazeh, Thao, Bunun, Tsou, Saaroa, Kanakanavu, Rukai, Paiwan, Puyuma, Amis, Kavalan, Seediq. Yami counts as the fifteenth language. It is usually included in the literature on “Formosan” languages, as the Orchid Island where this language is spoken politically depends from Taiwan but it actually belongs to the Batanic group (Philippine sub-branch).
Among these fourteen languages, Rukai forms a small communalect, both in terms of population (estimated at 11,200 as of 2005)1 and diffusion of the language (see Map 1 for the geographical distribution of Formosan languages). However, it differs from these by its overall complexity. It includes only six dialects (Tanan, Labuan, Budai, Maolin, Tona and Mantauran) but their internal relationships have, to date, not been completely clarified. It exhibits a voice dichotomy (cf. active vs. passive) not found in other Formosan languages. These are generally characterized by a more complex focus/voice system (see, among others, Tung et al. 1964, Tsuchida 1976, Yeh 1991, Huang 1995 and Chang 1997 for details descriptions regarding some of these languages).

The Rukai dialects stretch across the south of Taiwan (see Map 2 below): Tanan is located in the east (Taitung county); Budai and Labuan are situated in the south (Pingtung county); Maga, Mantauran and Tona of the “Lower three villages” are found in the north (Kaohsiung county). According to Kaneko (2005:149), who cites earlier Japanese sources (Utsurikawa et al., 1935:260-262 and Mabuchi, 1974:348-354, 511), “the Mantauran originally settled in She-pu-nuk (內本鹿), where they were attacked, moved to the area of the present Bunun village Varisan, and then settled in the location they left when they relocated to the present-day villages” in 1957, after various attempts by the Japanese and the Chinese to make them move from their earlier settlement. Nowadays, the village where Mantauran is spoken is split in two: the lower village is called ‘Wanshan’ (萬山村) in Chinese, and the upper village is known as ‘Fengli’ (鳳利村). There is no phonological, lexical or morpho-syntactic variation between these two settlements, about one kilometer apart.

Among the six dialects, Mantauran is the most endangered. The main reasons for its on-going decline lie in the passing away of elder speakers, the lost of this language as a mean of daily communication due to a fifty year governmental policy imposing Mandarin Chinese as the only official language and because of the emigration of younger villagers to neighboring towns. The primary school that had very few students in the 1990’s finally closed its doors in 2000. The population amounts to about 250~300 persons, but few good speakers of Mantauran are now left. The gradual loss of this language has had another disastrous consequence: speeding up linguistic change, readily perceived at all levels of the grammar.
The term “Mantauran”2 was first introduced by the Japanese (cf. Ogawa and Asai 1935) and it has since been then widely adopted in the literature. However, as pointed out by Li (1973), the local Rukai communities identify themselves by the name given to their village (see table 1.1) and the Mantauran are known among this linguistic group as [swa-]ponogo (’oponoho3 [/oponoho] in Mantauran).

1.2 POSITION OF MANTAURAN WITHIN RUKAI
Since Li's (1977) reconstruction of Proto Rukai (PR), it has become generally accepted that Tanan, Labuan and Budai on the one hand, Maga and Tona on the other, form two distinct subgroups. The position of Mantauran in the Rukai family remains controversial because the structure of the language has been obscured by drastic phonological and syntactic changes.
Li (1977) showed that phonologically, the PR voiced stops have been weakened and spirantized. Hence, PR *b, *Í and *d, *g correspond to Mt v, D and h respectively. Syntactically, though Mantauran shares some structural resemblances with the Formosan languages and the Rukai dialects, it also displays a number of morpho-syntactic features not found elsewhere: (i) it has bound pronouns which tend to coalesce with the verb stem and (ii) the third person oblique pronoun has been reanalyzed as an “agreement” marker.
Three hypotheses have been advanced regarding the position of Mantauran in the Rukai family. In the first, Mantauran is believed to subgroup immediately with Maga and Tona (see Li,
4 In the past years, the Rukai have migrated to other places and formed new communities in areas occupied by other populations, cf. Tewen, Chinye and Sanhe (Pingtung county, originally Paiwan settlements), and Fengshan (Kaohsiung county, mainly Taiwanese). 5 The earlier Wanshan settlement is referred to as ka’oponohae in Mantauran. The new Wanshan village is known as tavele’eve’e; the upper village is called tapangodhalae. ’oponoho is the generic appellation for the Mantauran people and the place they inhabit (i.e., there is no specific reference to the old or new location). For the sake of convenience, I will be referring throughout this study to the ‘old Wanshan village’ and the ‘new Wanshan village’.

1977). In the second, it is regarded as the first offshoot of the Rukai family (see Tu and Cheng 1991; Li 1995 & 1996, Starosta 1994 and 1995). I myself believe that Mantauran forms a subgroup with the Tanan-Labuan-Budai cluster6 but the question regarding the internal relationships of the Rukai dialects will not be discussed in this book as this issue is taken up elsewhere (Zeitoun forthcoming).7
1.3 PREVIOUS STUDIES ON MANTAURAN
Earlier studies on Mantauran 8 fall into two main categories: (i) most offer lexical comparative data and draw phonological implications (e.g., reconstruction and subgrouping hypotheses) or provide comparative/typological descriptions of the morpho-syntax of the Rukai dialects; (ii) fewer describe in detail aspects of the Mantauran phonology and/or morpho-syntax. The list of references that follows is based on this dichotomy, each study being summarized succintly.
As far as comparative and typological studies are concerned, four major works must be retained:
Tsuchida9 (1976) presented lexical comparative data on the Rukai dialects of the “Lower three villages” to support the claim that Rukai and Tsou are closely related.
Li (1977) provided a list of about 800 cognates in five dialects (Mantauran, Maga, Tona, Budai and Tanan) in order to reconstruct the phonological system of Proto-Rukai and determine the internal relationships of Rukai.
The second part of my Ph.D dissertation (see Zeitoun 1995a) was dedicated to the comparative study of the Rukai dialects and included an account of their main phonological and morpho-syntactic characteristics and variations as well as a discussion on their subgrouping. A large corpus of elicited vocabulary, sentences as well as texts were provided in the appendices. I later tried to enhance some aspects of this preliminary work: in Zeitoun (1995b) for instance, I reconsidered the pronominal system of Rukai, and provided a reconstruction of the pronominal system of Proto-Rukai.
6 Ross (2003) also reaches this conclusion. 7 The position of Rukai among the Formosan languages, and in particular its relationship to Tsouic and Paiwan remains a controversial issue. Three major hypotheses have been postulated that views Rukai as: (1) subgrouping with Tsouic and forming a higher group Rukai-Tsouic (Tsuchida 1976), (2) being closer to Paiwan (Ho 1983), (3) forming a linguistic group distinct from both Tsouic and Paiwan (Starosta 1994, 1995). 8 See Chen (1999), Hsin (2000) and Zeitoun (2000 and forthcoming) for a more complete literature review on the whole Rukai family. 9 Iin August 2005, Prof. S. Tsuchida generously gave me a copy of the data and stories he had recorded in July and August 1970.

Elizabeth Zeitoun
Li’s article (1996) concerning the pronominal system of Rukai was written as a response to my own paper (1995b) and illustrates the major resemblances and differences of the Rukai dialects, with a reflection on their internal relationships and a reconstruction of the pronominal system of Proto-Rukai, that differs slightly from mine.
Ross’ (2003) study has not been published. It draws on (un)published sources and proposes another reconstruction of the pronominal system of Rukai with further implications for subgrouping, and in particular the position of Mantauran within this linguistic group.
Data on Mantauran were also cited in other papers relating to the typological study of the syntax of the Formosan languages (cf. Yeh et al. 1998, Huang et al. 1998, Zeitoun et al. 1999, Zeitoun 2000, Zeitoun and Huang 2000, Zeitoun and Wu 2005). There are fewer descriptions regarding the phonology and morpho-syntax of Mantauran (cf. Ogawa and Asai 1935 and Zeitoun 1997ff). Ogawa and Asai (1935) were the first to describe the Rukai dialects and provided a comparative analysis of the phonology and morpho-syntax of Budai-Tanan and Maolin-Tona as well as a phonological reconstruction of Proto-Rukai, with each dialect illustrated by a series of texts. In Zeitoun (1997a-b) I re-investigated (i) the case marking system and (ii) the pronominal system of Mantauran. In other papers (see Zeitoun 2000, 2001, 2002 and Zeitoun and Hsin 2002), I have examined phonological and morpho-syntactic aspects of Mantauran that had not been investigated before: verb(al) classification and alternations, plurality, nominalization and glottal hoping.
1.4 DATA GATHERING PROCEDURES AND THEORETICAL ORIENTATIONS
I was asked to study Mantauran as part of a project headed by Paul Jen-kuei Li in August 1992. I could have worked on that dialect just for the duration of that year-long project. I decided otherwise, though, because of the controversial position of Mantauran in the Rukai family (cf. §1.2), its seemingly “aberrant” grammar and because before the early 1990’s, it had been hardly worked on (cf. §1.3).
Indeed, when I started fieldwork, the only data that was available to me was Li (1977a) and Ogawa and Asai (1935). There was virtually no information whatsoever on the morpho-syntax of this dialect. This study mainly draws on my own fieldwork, which was conducted on and off since August 1992. Some fieldwork sessions were carried out with a Mantauran assistant, Lin Hui-chuan (林惠娟), I trained in ethnolinguistics and who published a series of textbooks on her language (see Lin 1999).
The data provided here are to a large extent extracted from texts, which comprise over 600 pages of transcribed narratives that relate our late informant’s memories (Vol. 1) and traditional folktales (Vol. 2) that were collected over a seven-year period. These texts were enriched by elicited vocabulary and sentences. My first and principal informant, Mrs. Lü Yu-zhi (呂玉枝), died in 2000 at the age of 76. She narrated the stories that were later published in 2003 (see Zeitoun and
6

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)
Lin 2003). Mrs Guan Yue-ying (關月英) – born in 1938 – provided numerous folktales. Over the years, I have also worked with other informants, Mrs Lan Gui-ying (藍貴英) – born in 1947 – and Tsai Ching-mei （蔡清妹） – born in 1935 – more particularly on the vocabulary and on the morpho-syntax of this language. Since 2003, I have made use of new available textbooks, edited under the direction of the Ministry of Education of Taiwan and published with the support of the Council of Indigenous Peoples, Executive Yuan. 1.5 AIMS OF THE PRESENT STUDY AND BRIEF OUTLINE
The aim of the present book – which partly draws on these earlier studies – is to present a comprehensive grammar of Mantauran. It is highly descriptive and heavily data oriented. My goals are two-fold: first, provide a description of the most salient characteristics of the grammar of Mantauran in order to reach a better understanding of this language and second, make available enough empirical data to show in what respect Mantauran differs from the other Rukai dialects and other Formosan languages as a whole.
This grammar is divided into nine chapters that cover the phonology and morpho-syntax of Mantauran.

Phonology

In this chapter, the most important aspects of Mantauran phonology are discussed. Section 2.1 deals with the segments of this dialect. Besides giving an inventory of consonants and vowels and their distribution, it also deals with major (past and on-going) phonological changes and the phonology of loan words. Section 2.2 discusses its stress assignment, syllable structure and intonation. Section 2.3 deals with major morphophonemic alternations. Section 2.4 mentions remaining problems, and section 2.5 introduces the orthographic system that will be used throughout the present volume.

2.1 PHONEME INVENTORY Mantauran has 15 consonants and four vowels, as shown in Tables 2.1 and 2.2. TABLE 2.1 CONSONANTS

2.1.1 Description of the phonemes
In this section, the Mantauran consonantal and vocalic segments and their major allophonic variants (if any) are listed and exemplified in (2.1) and (2.3) respectively. Minimal contrasts are provided in (2.2)-(2.4).
(2.1) /p/ is a voiceless bilabial stop, e.g., mapipi ‘drop’ /t/ is a voiceless alveolar stop, e.g., titina ‘middle-aged woman’ /k/ is a voiceless velar stop, e.g., ka/ac´ ‘bite’ The three voiceless stops are unaspirated. /// is a glottal stop, e.g., /a´Ò´N´ ‘flower’ /m/ is a voiced bilabial nasal, e.g., mam´Ò´/´ ‘cheap, easy’ /n/ is a voiced alveolar nasal, e.g, nana ‘pus’ /N/ is a voiced velar nasal, e.g., Nalai ‘saliva’ /s/ is a voiceless alveolar fricative, e.g, paiso ‘money’ It is palatalized and pronounced as [S] before [i], e.g., masi/i [maSi/i]‘small’ /h/ is a voiceless glottal fricative, e.g., Ò´n´h´ ‘rock’ /v/ is a voiced labio-dental fricative, e.g., ovilivili ‘pull’ /D/ is a voiced interdental fricative, e.g., Da/an´ ‘house’ /ts/ is voiceless palatal affricate, e.g., tsaviri ‘throw away’ It is palatalized and pronounced as [tS] before [i], e.g., tsikitsiki [tSikitSiki] ‘tattoo’ /l/ is a voiced lateral, e.g., Dapal´ ‘foot, leg’ It has been described as a voiceless fricative by Tsuchida (1976), and as a voiced fricative in Li (1977a) and in my earlier works (e.g., Zeitoun 1995). However, when compared to a language such as Amis, for instance, it becomes clear that there is usually no frication whatsoever, except when /l/ precedes the vowel /i/, as in lili-li [¬i¬i-¬i]‘my friend’ /Ò/ is a voiced lateral retroflex, e.g., oÒaÒam´ ‘run’ Tsuchida (1976) believes that this consonant is a flap rather than a retroflex. /r/ is a trill, e.g., rihi ‘horse’ (cf. below the on-going sound change, from r to h and Ò)

In earlier works (Zeitoun 1995), I had recognized the existence of the glide /y/, but I now follow Li’s (1977a) analysis in assuming that the two glides /y/ and /w/ are the allophones of the high vowels /i/ and /u/ in postvocalic positions or are phonetically introduced (cf. the brief discussion on the distribution of vocalic phonemes in section 2.1.2).

(2.3) /i/ is a high front unrounded vowel, e.g., icivi ‘bake in stone’
It is pronounced as [e] after [/], e.g., kii/i [kii/e] ‘goat’ /o/ is a back rounded vowel, e.g., omoko(o) ‘grandpa!/grandma!’
/´/ is a mid unrounded central vowel, e.g., ´rai ‘blood’ /a/ is low unrounded vowel, e.g. aaÒam´ ‘bird’

In Mantauran (as in other Rukai dialects and in the Tsouic languages, see Li (1973), Tsuchida
(1976) and Hsin (2000)), words end in an open syllable. The last vowel of the word might be (i) an echo vowel, e.g., tipitipi ‘slap, beat’, v´l´v´l´ ‘banana’ or (ii) the last vowel of the word (occurring before or not the drop of an earlier consonant), e.g., MT cavo ‘wrap’ < PAN cabuq, Do/a ‘two’ < PAN duSa. The rules for determining echo vowels in Mantauran are quite similar to those
provided for Tsou by Tsuchida (1976:88). The value of the echo vowel is determined by the
preceding vowel: it is i if the preceding vowel is /i/, as in vilivili ‘pull’, o if the preceding vowel is /o/, as in Da/olo ‘rain’, ´ if the preceding vowel is /´/ or /a/, as in v´N´v´N´ ‘roll into, encircle’, val´val´ ‘a type of bamboo’. As mentioned in Li (1997a), echo vowels must be treated as phonemic. This claim is supported by the deletion of echo vowel (in comparison to the non-deletion of other vowels) when the base is suffixed. Compare: o-a/ipi ‘count’ ~ o/ip-a! ‘count!’ vs. o-/ipi ‘dream’ ~ /ipi-a! ‘dream!’.

2.1.2 Distribution

All the consonants occur in word-initial and medial position but not in word-final position
since, as a rule, words end in an open syllable, the last vowel being usually an echo vowel Consonants occurring in word-final position are only found in loans, e.g., takiloloN ‘Bunun name place’. There are no attested consonant clusters.

Vowels appear in clusters, usually forming sequence of two (and more rarely three) vowels. They are two types of vowel clusters: geminates and clusters of two different vowels. Geminates were shown to be phonemic in the preceding section. Attested vocalic sequences are shown in Table 2.7 and are further illustrated in Table 2.8.

Clusters of two distinct vowels may either form a single syllable or constitute two different syllables.
They form a single syllable in the following two cases: 1) when the low vowel a is followed by /i/ or /o/ or if the mid vowel /o/ is followed by /i/, e.g., in lamolai [lámolày], maDao [máDaw], topoi [tópoy].

11 I believe that the non-occurring of these vocalic sequences might represent a gap in my data collection rather than an absence in the language.

16

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

2) when the vowels /i/ and /o/ precede the low vowel /a/, as there is a tendency in rapid speech to have the high(er) vowels phonetically realized as prevocalic glides, as in: poa [pwa] ‘make’, toa [twa], /ia [/ya], etc.
They constitute two distinct syllables: 1) in normal speech; a glide is inserted in intervocalic position, as in: ia´ [iya´], osiav´ [osiyav´], toipi [toyipi], movaÒio [movaÒiyo] etc. 2) when schwa follows or precedes another vowel, e.g., ta./a.´Ò´ ‘together’, ´.m´.ao ‘charcoal’.

13 Li (1977:585) stipulates that in Mantauran it is not PR *y but PR *D coalesced with Pr *Ò in non-final positions. In my mind, Pan *y is retained as Pr *y. It has become Budai (Tanan and Labuan) D, Mantauran Ò
and Maga r. 14 But the suffix -an´ occurs in certain forms, e.g., /olrongan´! ‘Stupid!’

2.2 SYLLABLE LEVEL PROCESSES

Stress has been difficult to analyze and it would certainly deserves an in-depth study I am
unable to provide here. Stress usually falls on the first syllable as in tamatama [támatama] ‘middle-aged man’, Da/an´ [Dá/an´] ‘house’, koap´ [kóap´] ‘sock’ and shifts to the first syllable if the base is prefixed, e.g., titina [títina] ‘middle-aged woman’ > aitina [áitina] ‘middle-aged women’. There is also a secondary stress in multisyllabic words, e.g., v´l´v´l´ [v´@l´v´$l´]. It has

been treated as non-phonemic in earlier works (cf. Tsuchida 1976 and Li 1977a), and I follow this treatment here.
Most Formosan languages exhibit a CVC syllable structure. At an earlier stage of their history, echo vowels were added in Mantauran (cf. section 2.1), altering the PAn canonical CVC syllable structure. The currently attested syllable structure can be represented by the formula (C)V. The occurrence of the onset is optional and there is no coda. The minimal Mantauran syllable consists of just a vowel (usually in word-initial position), and the maximal syllable structure is CVV, underlying CVG, where G stands for the phonetic glide (allophone of /i/ or /o/) occurring after or before the low vowel /a/ or the mid vowel /o/. Monosyllables are rare, e.g., -i ‘s/he’, la ‘and’ lo ‘if’ and usually represent grammatical words. Lexical roots might be disyllabic, trisyllabic but might even count four syllables or more.

Intonation is another phonological area that needs further investigation, as I did not collect
any data related to this topic. It contrasts undoubtedly in a following pair of (and similar) examples: a-/oNol-a´! ‘Don’t drink (Imperative)’ vs. a-/oNol-a´ ‘drink (Objective nominalization)’ but I did not attempt at all to represent any intonation contour.

2.3 MAJOR MORPHOPHONEMIC ALTERNATIONS
There are a number of morphophonemic alternations in Mantauran which all result from the affixation of a morpheme in a word. They include: (i) vowel deletion (§ 2.3.1), (ii) an anticipatory (leftward) copying process (§ 2.3.2), (iii) the alternation between i/o and Ò (§ 2.3.3), (iv) the coalescence of -o- (from earlier -o- insertion) in certain verbal stems (§ 2.3.4), (v) haplology of identical segments (§ 2.3.5) and (vi) glottal hopping (§ 2.3.6).
2.3.1 Vowel deletion

As in Tanan Rukai (see Li 1973:56ff), vowel deletion is yielded by the attachment of a prefix or a suffix to the base (either a root or a stem). It involves the deletion of identical or non identical vowels.

1) Vowel deletion following prefixation:

(2.16) a. ta- ~ t- ‘inalienable’

-ecelrange ‘black’

~

but

ama- ‘father’

~

ina-

‘mother’

~

omo- ‘grandparent’ ~

ta-ecelrange -t-ama -t-ina -t-omo

‘black(ness), black’ ‘father’ ‘mother’ ‘grandparent’

b. and

la- ~ l- ‘plural’

ivoko- ‘(male) friend’ ~

ahan´ ‘grandchild’ ~

cf. also

ina-

‘mother’

omo- ‘grandparent’ ~

la-/ivoko la-ahan´ l-ahan´ l-iina
l-oomo

‘(male) friends’16 ‘grandchildren’
‘mothers’ ‘grandparents’

16 The insertion in this particular example is ill-understood at this stage.

21

Elizabeth Zeitoun

2) Vowel deletion following suffixation, involving either the deletion of the last vowel of the base – usually an echo vowel as in (2.17) – or the first vowel of the suffix (2.18):

(2.17) a. but

kan´ /oNolo tipitipiti
aÒa pato/o kilisi

‘eat’ ‘drink’ ‘slap, beat’ ‘take’ ‘tell’ ‘tighten’

~ kon-a!
~ /oNol-a! ~ tipitip-a!
~ aÒ(a)-a! ~ pato/o-a! ~ kilisi-a!

‘eat!’ ‘drink!’ ‘slap, beat!’ ‘take!’ ‘tell!’ ‘tighten (your belt)!’

(2.18) but

a-…-a´ ~ a-…-´ ‘objective nominalization’

a. om-iki ‘exist, be at’ ~ a-iki-´(-/o) ‘where are (you)?’

and not * a-iki-a´(-/o)

b. /aNato ‘brushwood’ ~ ta-/aNato-´ ‘woodshed’

and not * ta-/aNato-a´

c. om-oa ‘go’

~ ta-oa-´

‘place where (one) goes...’

and not * ta-oa-a´

d. om-iki ‘exist, be at’

~ kiki-a´ ‘space’ and not *kiki-´

~ ta-iki-a´ ‘room’

vs.

ta-iki-´

‘the place where...is’

and

to-ta-ikiki-´ ‘build a room/ bed’

(Lit: build a place to stay...)

2.3.2 Anticipatory (leftward) copying process

There is an anticipatory (leftward) copying process yielded by the reduplication of a iCo syllabic sequence, whereby: (i) the second vowel of the CiCo- reduplicated segment becomes i thus resulting in a CiCi-CiCo sequence, as in (2.19a-b), (ii) the vowel o become i when the stem undergoes CVV reduplication, thus producing a iCii-Co, as in (2.19c):

(2.19) a. to-alipoho ‘draw a head’ ~ to-alipilipoho ‘draw heads’

b. o-lriho/o ‘know’

~ /aiÒihiÒiho/o ‘watch’

c. la-ma/-ivoko ‘(male) friends’ ~ la-ma/-ivi/ivoko ‘(male) friends’

d. /ipaiso ‘make/get, withdraw money’~ /ipaisiiso ‘make/get, withdraw

money (hab.)’17

17 The forms given in (2.19) seem to represent more “archaic” forms. Informants also accepted to-alipolipoho ‘draw heads’, /aiÒihoÒiho/o ‘watch’, lama/ivo/ivoko ‘(male) friends’ and /ipaisoiso

2.3.3 Alternation between i/o ~ Ò

Li (1973 and 1977b) showed that glides (among other types of consonants) might alternate with liquids as a result of suffixation in many Formosan languages. Indeed, the suffixation of -a in imperative constructions or in derived nominals triggers the alternation between i (occurring after a and o, thus yielding an underlying glide /y/) and Ò:

display an apparent alternation between a and o. They are characterized by the fact that they either start with the low vowel /a/, as in amece ‘bring’ or have their first syllable contain /a/, as in kane ‘eat’. Comparative data shows that an epenthetic /-o-/ (> Tona and Tanan -w-) was inserted in these types of verbs, the vocalic sequence (cf. -oa-) coalesced into o in Mantauran (cf. § 2.2), yielding the apparent “alternation” between a and o.

Two identical syllables coalesce as a result of haplology. This phenomena was first noticed by Li (1977a) on the historical level. Haplology is also evidenced by synchronic data: when two circumfixes co-occur together or if part of the circumfix is identical to the base it attaches to, one of the identical parts is deleted.

2.3.6 Glottal hopping19

The term “glottal hopping” is used to refer to the change of the position of the glottal stop within a word. After having given evidence for the phonemic status of the glottal stop in Mantauran (cf. § 2.3.6.1), I mention four different cases of affixation yielding glottal hopping (cf. § 2.3.6.2~2.3.6.5). In section 2.3.6.6, I list out cases where glottal hopping does not occur. In section 2.3.6.7, generalizations are captured and explanations provided.

2.3.6.1 Phonemic status of the glottal stop revisited The phonemic status of the glottal stop is well established. It occurs in initial and medial
positions before any vowel:

(2.27) a. b. c. d.

/oÒipoco /aÒo /iko /´kai

‘unwrap’ ‘person name’ ‘tail’ ‘worm’

vs. oÒipoco ‘wrap’

vs. alo

‘bee, honey’

vs. iki

‘exist, be at’

vs. ´rai

‘blood’

It also occurs between two like or unlike vowels:

(2.28) a. b. c. d.

ka/olo Da/an´ ana/i ia/´

‘commoner’ ‘house’ ‘that’ ‘yes’

vs. kaolo ‘hoe’

vs. /aan´ ‘noon’

vs. aangai ‘who’

vs. ia´

‘I’

Sequences such as /V1/V1/2, whereby the second vowel can be identical or distinct from the first, are also found though there are rare. They include: /i/ias´ ‘bird name’, aÒ´/´/´ ‘nit’, /o/o ‘wash (one’s) hair’.

2.3.6.2 Prefixation yielding apparent rightward glottal hopping in word-initial position The prefix a- attaches to [+common, + human] nouns to indicate plurality. The base usually
undergoes reduplication unless it attaches to a lexicalized reduplicated root (cf. § 3.2.2).

(2.29) a. tamatama ‘middle aged-man’ ~

b. tomotomo ‘old (wo)man’

~

c. vaÒovaÒo ‘young woman’ ~

a-tamatama a-tomotomo a-vaÒovaÒo

‘middle-aged men’ ‘old (wo)men’ ‘young women’

19 The present section is drawn on a co-authored paper I wrote with Tien-hsin Hsin (see Zeitoun and Hsin 2002).

25

Elizabeth Zeitoun

d. savar´ ‘young man’

~ a-savasavar´ ‘young men’

The prefixation of a- causes the glottal stop occurring in word-initial position as onset to move rightward:

(2.30) a. /avai b. /aolai

‘girl, female, woman’ ~ a/ivivai ‘girls, females, women’ ‘boy, male, man’ ~ a/olalai ‘boys, males, men’

In (2.30a), note the irregular reduplication pattern, cf. vi instead of the expected syllable **va
and the insertion of i after the glottal stop. In (2.30b), note the correspondence between Mantauran /aolai ‘boy, male, man’ and Budai saovalay, showing three attested sound changes in the former dialect: PR *s > MT /; PR *v > MT Ø and PR *oa > MT o.
The prefix /i- is homophonous. It might indicate a passive (2.31a), or entail such meanings as “take, wear, put on” (2.31b), “gather” (2.31c) or “look for” (2.31d), all subsumed under
“obtain-N”:

/i-kipiNi

‘put on clothes’

/i-pahai

‘harvest rice’

/i-omoomoma ‘look for (new) fields (to cultivate)’

The prefixation of /i- causes the glottal stop occurring in word-initial position to move rightward:

(2.32) /a´Ò´N´

‘flower’ ~ /i-a/´Ò´/´Ò´N´ ‘pick up flowers’ and not */i/a´Ò´/´Ò´N´

2.3.6.3 Prefixation yielding apparent leftward glottal hopping in word-initial position Unlike the above example, the prefixation of /i- in (2.33) causes the glottal stop occurring in
word-initial position to apparently move leftward:

(2.33) a. /aN´/aN´ ‘hurt’

~

/iaN´/aN´

‘be/get hurt’

and not */i/aN´/aN´

b. /onoro ‘cut hair’ ~

/ionoro

and not */i/onoro

‘have an haircut’

26

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

c. /aNato ‘wood, brushwood’ /iaNato and not */i/aNato

‘gather brushwood’

d. /oÒa/a ‘snake’ ~

/ioÒa/oÒa/a ‘look for snakes’

and not */i/oÒa/oÒa/a

The nominalizer /a- derives an instrumental noun from a verb stem:

(2.34) a. b. c. d.

o-c´Na/a ‘drive in a nail’

~

o-DaÒi ‘pave the floor with slates’ ~

o-pana ‘shoot’

~

o-taN´taN´ ‘beat (with a board)’

~

/a-c´Na-c´Na/a ‘nail’

/a-DaÒi-DaÒi ‘floor, slate

/a-pana

‘arrow’

/a-taN´taN´ ‘washboard’

It also causes the glottal stop occurring in word-initial position to apparently move leftward:

(2.35) a. o-/´nao ‘wash (clothes)’

~ /a´na/´nao ‘washing powder’

and not */a/´na/´nao

b. o-/oDooDo ‘mop (the floor)’ ~ /aoDooDooDo ‘mop’ and not */i/oDooDooDo

c. o-/osario ‘play’

~ /aosarisario ‘toy’ and not */i/osarisario

The prefix /ini- followed by Ca-reduplication indicates “reflexivity”:

(2.36) a. colo

‘kill a pig’

b. pat´/´t´ ‘kill (s.o)’

c. kaDalam´ ‘love (s.o)’

~ /ini-ca-colo

‘kill a pig oneself’

~ /ini-pa-pat´/´t´ ‘kill oneself’

~ /ini-ka-kaDalam´ ‘love oneself’

When this prefix attaches to a base with a glottal stop as onset, it causes the glottal stop occurring in word-medial position in the derived word to move leftward.

(2.37) a. /okoloDo ‘be frightened’ ~ /ini/aokoloDo ‘to frighten oneself’ and not */ini/a/okoloDo

b. /onoro ‘cut hair’

~ /ini/aonoro ‘cut one’s hair oneself’

and not */ini/a/onoro

2.3.6.4 Circumfixation yielding apparent rightward glottal hopping in word-final position
Nominalization in Mantauran is a very productive and fairly predictable derivational process cf. § 6.3). The circumfixation of two nominalizers, (a-)...-a´ ‘objective nominalization’ and ta-...-a´ ‘locative nominalization’ causes glottal hopping, as further shown below.
The circumfix (a-)…-ae derives a verb into its object counterpart. There is a distinction between dynamic verbs, which are circumfixed by a-...-a´ and stative verbs that just take ...-a´. Note in these examples the deletion of the last vowel of the base after the suffixation with
vowel-initial morpheme.

a-lop-a´ a-v´Ò´t-a´ ka-Dalam-a´ ka-s´k´Ò-a´

‘game’ ‘wall’ ‘the loved one’ ‘the one being angered at’

Locative nominalization (which implies that “X is the place where Y did/does something”) usually manifests itself through the circumfixation of ta-...-(a)´ to the verb base.

As shown in the following examples, the circumfixation of (a-)...-a´ and ta-...-(a)´ to the base causes the glottal stop occurring in word-final position to move rightward and yields the “break-up” of the morpheme -a´.

2.3.6.5 Change of verb stem yielding apparent rightward glottal hopping in word-final position Mantauran is characterized by a rich verbal morphology. Verbs undergo different
morpho-phonological alternations depending on whether they are dynamic or stative and whether they occur as finite, non-finite or subjunctive (cf. § 7.1). Subjunctive verbs beginning with a syllable containing /a/ usually undergo an alternation between a and o (cf. § 2.4.2)

2.3.6.6 No glottal hopping It has been shown above that in Mantauran the glottal stop apparently “moves” rightward or
leftward in word-initial, -medial and -final positions after a word has undergone affixation. In the following examples, glottal hopping does not happen.
In (2.45)-(2.46), the circumfixation of a-...-a´ ‘objective nominalization’ does not produce glottal hopping.

The above examples show that the verb va/ai ‘give’ exhibits two non-finite and two subjunctive forms. When and why glottal hopping occurs or not in these different examples must
be accounted for.

More intriguing is the non-occurrence of glottal hopping in (2.49a) and (2.49b), which
contrasts with (2.49a’) and (2.49b’) and poses challenge for any explanatory analysis. In (2.49a), the root is circumfixed by the locative nominalizer ta-…a´ to form a derived nominal whereas in (2.49b), the locative meaning is obtained through (i) the reduplication of the base and (ii) the suffixation of -a´.

2.3.6.7 Generalizations and explanations A number of generalizations can be made. 1) Glottal hopping is only found in morphologically derived contexts – i.e., it is induced by

31

Elizabeth Zeitoun

affixation – but not in the lexicon. 2) It might induce the “break-up” of a morpheme boundary in final position, e.g.,
takataaDia/´ ‘advantage’ (< kataaDi/i ‘good’). Two counter-examples were given, which I cannot account for at this point, cf. (2.49a-b).
3) It usually occurs when a glottal stop is situated between either a high vowel /o/ or /i/ (less frequently /´/) and the low vowel /a/.
4) Glottal hopping might simultaneously occur with another common process, whereby the final vowel of the stem is deleted when attached by a vowel-initial suffix.
A straightforward solution to glottal hopping is to posit that it results from an epenthesis process. This is not the case, however.

An analysis invoking Deletion fails somehow to capture the contrast in (2.50a-b) and (2.51a-b):

(2.50) a. /a + /oNolo b. a + /oNolo + a´

→ /a-oNo-/oNolo → a-/oNo-/oNol-a´

‘glass’ ‘drink’

(2.51) a. /i + /aN´/aN´ b. /i + /a´Ò´N´

→ /iaN´/aN´ → /ia/´Ò´/´Ò´/´N´

‘get hurt’ ‘look for flowers’

In (2.51a-b), both stems begin with a glottal stop and are prefixed by /i-. However, while in (2.51a), the glottal stop is deleted, it is preserved in (2.50b) and there is no way to account for the (non-)appearance of the glottal stop in these examples.
Alternatively, the surface alternation of the glottal segment can be treated as the result of a process of metathesis that inverts the order of a glottal stop and the adjacent low vowel /a/. This inversion induces four possible situations, schematically represented in (2.52a-d), depending on the segment (either a consonant or a vowel) following the low vowel and the segment undergoing glottal hopping occurs in word-initial or word-final position.

(2.52) A. Word-initial position
a. /V-/aC → /V-a/C → /V-a_C b. /V-/aV → /V-a/V → /V-a/V B. Word-final position
c. V/V-a´ → V/-a´ → Va/-´ d. V/VV → VV/V

In the first scenario, the glottal stop is placed before another consonant. It is deleted since neither word-final codas nor complex onsets are allowed in Mantauran.

32

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

(2.53) a. //i-/aN´/aN´/ → /i-a/N´/aN´ b. //i-/apa/a/ → /i-a/pa/a

→ /i-aN´/aN´ → /i-apa/a

In the second scenario, the inverted glottal stop is followed by a vowel; hence it is realized as the onset of the following nucleus.

(2.54) //i-/a´Ò´/´Ò´N´/ → /i-a/´Ò´/´Ò´N´

→ /ia/´Ò´/´Ò´N´

In the third, the glottal stop is inverted with the first vowel of the suffix after the deletion of the last vowel of the base.

(2.55) /ki-Òiho/o-a´(-li)/ → ki-Òiho/-a´(-li)

→ ki-Òihoa/-´(-li)

In the last, the vowel and the glottal stop also undergo inversion.

(2.56) /o-va/ai/

→ va/ai

→ vaa/i

Though in sections 2.3.6.2~2.3.6.5, glottal hopping was treated as applying in rightward and leftward position, these four scenarios show that the glottal stop only moves rightward.
There appears to be a morphophonemic factor, whereby the word-final high vowel becomes a lateral retroflex before /a/, (cf. § 2.4.1), that blocks metathesis from applying in certain forms, cf. voa/i ‘give (Subj)’ vs. vo/aÒ-a ‘give (Imp)’ and vaa/i ‘give (NFin)’ vs. a-va/aÒ-a´ ‘give (ObjNmz)’. The variations between these surface forms seem to result from the blocking effect of a morphophonemic alternation.

2.4 Remaining problems
There are a number of “exceptional” phonological processes going on in Mantauran, which require an account I am unable to offer at this stage.
2.4.1 The epenthetic vowel -a-

An epenthetic vowel -a- seems to be inserted in (2.57a):

(2.57) a. /aolai

‘male, man, boy’ ~ /aolaÒ-a-na´ ‘groom’s family’ and not */aolai-na´

33

Elizabeth Zeitoun

but b. /avai

‘female, woman, girl’ ~ /avai-na´

‘bride’s family’

and not */avaÒ-a-na´

cf. also c. m´n´ ‘now, day’

~ m´n-a-na´

and

m´n´-na´

‘day, time’ ‘which day?’

I am actually not too sure whether to treat -a- as an epenthetic vowel in (2.57a) because -a also
represents a suffix that attaches to temporal or locative nouns and can be glossed as ‘beyond (in
time or space)’, cf. dha/an´ ‘house’ ~ Da/an-a-na´ ‘(one) household’, hoÒolo ‘mountain’ ~ hoÒol-a-na´ ‘(one) mountain’, m´n´ ‘now, today’ ~ m´n-a-na´ ‘(one) day’. On the other hand, if we do not do so, there is no way to account for the contrast between /aolaÒana´ ‘groom’s family’ vs. /avaina´ ‘bride’s family’.

2.4.2 Irregular forms

Irregular forms after the prefixation of the plural marker a- include:

(2.58) a. b. c. d.

/avai Òoolai ka/olo
titina

‘female, girl, woman’ ~

‘baby, child ’ ~

2.5 Orthographic system

The present section presents a brief retrospective on the orthographic systems of the Formosan languages that led to the orthographic system agreed for Mantauran Rukai and is adopted in the present study.

2.5.1 Brief retrospective

Different writing systems (alphabetic, syllabic and logographic) have been adopted to transcribe the Formosan languages during the past four hundred years. Four stages can be distinguished that reflect the history of Taiwan, the last of which is, by far, the most complex:
(1) Dutch colonization (1629-1661): the Roman alphabet was first introduced in Taiwan to record primarily Siraya and Favorlang.

(2) Chinese colonization (1661-1895): many land contracts, songs, place or family names were transcribed in Chinese characters; the phonetic value of these Chinese characters is somewhat complex, sometimes referring to Mandarin Chinese and at other times to the Minnan pronunciation.
(3) Japanese colonization (1895-1945): From 1895 to 1945, Taiwan was a Japanese colony. Aboriginal children were enrolled in schools (up to the age of 12) and learnt Japanese, so they were able, in later years, to transcribe their own language in katakana.
(4) Post-1945: With the arrival of the Nationalist Chinese under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese government imposed Mandarin Chinese as the sole official language. The Zhuyin fuhao system more popularly known as Bopomofo, was introduced and used in textbooks, dictionaries etc. At one time, it was also used to transcribe the Formosan languages (e.g., the Bible, songs and textbooks). Bopomofo consists of 37 symbols derived from Chinese characters, and some of these symbols were slightly altered to convey sounds recorded in the Formosan languages that are not found in Chinese. Different writing systems (all Romanized) were devised by the Catholic and the Protestant Church and used during the same period. The lack of adherence to common principles had the unfortunate consequence of producing different writing systems for different tribes. In 1991, Prof. Li Jen-kuei (cf. Li 1992) was asked by the Ministry of Education of Taiwan to devise writing systems for the Formosan languages and proposed different solutions (e.g., replacing IPA symbols such as N with a capital letter N or with two symbols, ng). In 2002, linguists were asked by the Council of [Taiwan] Indigenous Peoples, Executive Yuan, to work in collaboration with each tribe according to their individual expertise and finalize the orthographic system(s) of all the aboriginal languages of Taiwan. This has also led to a variety of Romanized systems that have tried to improve on the Romanization systems of the Catholic and Protestant Church while taking into account Li’s (1992) recommendations.
2.5.2 Orthographic system adopted in this work
The following chart shows the correspondence between the orthographic system adopted in this study and the Mantauran phonemes and their actual phonetic representation. It follows the orthographic system that has been adopted by the Rukai in 2002 and that is now commonly used.

Chapter 3
Morphological units and morphological processes
This chapter introduces major morphological units in Mantauran (§ 3.1) and discusses three morphological processes (affixation, reduplication, compounding) (§ 3.2.1-3.2.3) as a backdrop for the study of nominal and verbal morphology in Chapters 6 and 7 respectively. A fourth phenomena, namely incorporation, is introduced in section 3.2.4, but I show that so far, no incorporation process has been detected in Mantauran Rukai.
3.1 MORPHOLOGICAL UNITS
This section includes a discussion on morphemes, allormorphs, homophones, polysemous morphs, portmanteau morphs, roots, stems, affixes and clitics.
3.1.1 Morphemes
A morpheme represents a minimal lexical or grammatical unit, the term “minimal” referring to a single morpheme. Morphemes include roots, affixes and clitics.
3.1.1.1 Dependency contrast A distinction must be made between “non-dependent” and “dependent” morphemes.
Non-dependent morphemes are free morphemes. They include free lexical items such as tomotomo ‘old person/old (wo)man’, ta’olro ‘dog’ or kane ‘eat’ and function (or grammatical) words like mani ‘then’ or la ‘and’. Dependent morphemes consist of affixes, clitics and bound (lexical and grammatical) roots, all of which cannot occur as independent words: affixes (e.g., a- ‘plural’) and clitics (e.g., -lrao ‘1S.Nom’) must be attached to a base, either a root (cf. a-tomotomo ‘old persons/old (wo)men’), a stem (cf. a-sava-savare ‘young men’) or a phrase (cf. o-kane-lrao ‘I eat’); lexical bound roots such as -valre ‘smelly’ or ama- ‘father’ must occur with an affix (cf. ma-valre ‘smelly’, ama-li ‘my father’); grammatical bound roots must also appear with an affix (cf. alaka-i ‘because’).
3.1.1.2 Phonotactic and morphological contrast Besides this contrast in dependency, lexical and grammatical morphemes share different
phonotactic and morphological properties, because they fulfill distinctive functions. Lexical morphemes (i.e., free and bound lexical roots) are usually disyllabic, trisyllabic or
quadrisyllabic, typically CVCV(CVCV), e.g., ka.ne ‘eat’, ’o.ngo.lo ‘drink’, ve.nge.ve.nge ‘roll
37

into, encircle’. They bear stress (e.g., sávare ‘young man’) and can undergo various morphological processes, most commonly affixation and reduplication, as in: á-sava-savare ‘young men’. Grammatical morphemes (i.e., functions words, clitics and affixes) are most commonly monosyllabic or disyllabic (e.g., function words: la ‘and’, mani ‘then’, clitics: -li ‘my/Gen’, -lrao ‘I/Nom’, affixes: to- ‘produce, build’, tali- ‘belong to/originate from’). In Mantauran, only prefixes seem to have an incidence on stress (cf., títina ‘middle-aged woman’ > áitina ‘middle-aged women’).20 Grammatical morphemes can be subject to affixation or to reduplication, but such processes occur under very restricted conditions. For instance, while demonstratives such as ’ina ‘this’, ana ‘that (+vis)’, dhona ‘that (-vis)’ can be suffixed with -lo, to mark plurality, cf. ’ina-lo ‘these’, ana-lo ‘those (+vis)’, dhona-lo ‘those (-vis)’, their morpho-syntactic distribution is less free than unaffixed demonstratives (see Chapter 6 for details). Certain prefixes can be reduplicated21, cf. MT to-dha’ane ‘build a house’ > ’ini-ta-to-dha’ane ‘build a house oneself’ but other types of affixes, clitics and function words never are.
3.1.2 Allomorphs

The same way as an allophone is a sound variant of a phoneme, an allomorph is the morphemic variant of a morpheme; it has thus no repercussion on meaning. Allomorphs might be phonologically, grammatically or lexically conditioned (Katamba 1993).

3.1.2.1 Phonologically conditioned allomorphs Paiwan and Saisiyat exhibit “prototypical” cases of phonologically conditioned allomorphs
in verbal morphology. Ho (1977:615) and H. Chang (1992:14) show that in Northern Paiwan, the AF infix <em>
has two allomorphs: m- and <en>. It is the phonological properties of the first segment of the verb to which is attached the infix <em> that determines the choice of the allomorph:

(3.1) a.

<em> is inserted after the first consonant of the root (except if that consonant is /v/) e.g., t<em>ekelr ‘drink<AF>’

b. <en> occurs when that consonant is a labial e.g., p<en>elri ‘choose <AF>’, b<en>uan ‘drill <AF>’, v<en>elri ‘buy<AF>’

20 In most other Formosan languages (e.g., Tsou, Seediq), it is the suffix that causes stress shift. Compare:
Tsou émi ‘wine’ with me-émi ‘make wine’ and ámo ‘father’ with amó-’u ‘my father’. 21 The same is true in Thao (Blust 2003b) and Saisiyat (Yeh 2000b, Zeitoun and Wu 2005).

38

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

c. m- attaches to roots that begin with an open syllable e.g., m-alrim ‘AF-forget’

In Saisiyat, the PF suffix -en has three allomorphs -on, -in, -oen (Yeh 1991:25 and 2000a:55): if the last vowel of the root is a non-low vowel other than e, then schwa is completely assimilated to it. Compare:

(3.2) a. shebet-en ‘beat-PF’

b. tobok-on ‘kill-PF’

c. ra’oe-oen ‘drink-PF’

d. mari’-in ‘take-PF’

In Mantauran, one clear-cut case of phonological allomorphy concerns the distribution of the personal pronoun -mo’o, which displays an allomorph, -mi’-. -mo’o attaches to a verb and is never followed by another (oblique) pronoun. -mi’- is always followed by another oblique pronoun except -imite ‘1PI.Obl’.22 The distribution of -mo’o and -mi’- is illustrated through the following examples:

(3.3) a.

o-omale-mo’o. Dyn.Fin-sing-2S.Nom ‘You sing/sang.’

b. o-tiptipi-mi’-iae. Dyn.Fin-beat-2S.Nom-1S.Nom ‘You beat me.’

Other examples of phonological allomorphy are introduced in the course of this study.

22 -mo’o and -imite merge together as -mite. (i) o-tipitipi-mite. Dyn.Fin-beat-2S.Nom:1PI.Obl ‘You beat us.’

3.1.2.2 Grammatically conditioned allomorphs Mantauran exhibits grammatically conditioned allomorphs, a phenomena I illustrate with
three examples below.

3.1.2.2.1 o-, om-, m- and Ø Verbs in Mantauran divide into two major categories, dynamic verbs vs. stative verbs (cf. §
7.1). Dynamic verbs occur as bare roots in various constructions, whenever: (i) they are in matrix position (i.e., they occupy the first verbal position) but appear with a prefix (e.g., with the causative pa-, the negator ki-, the irrealis prefix amo- ‘will’ etc…):

‘If (one of the) younger brother(s) built (his own) house, he (would) kill a pig for the

house warning, to let the villagers know that he had moved.’

‘We will give you that/those land(s)…’

(ii) they occur after the conjunction mani ‘then’ or la ‘and’:

(3.5) a.

mani lapo-nai

ove’eke…

then

Dyn.NFin:raise-1PE.Nom pig

‘Then we (would) raise pigs…’

b. ana ocao tako-kane-kane

la lralrame.

that person while-Red-Dyn.NFin:eat and Dyn.NFin:run

‘That person is eating and running at the same time.’

In the above examples, bare verbal roots are treated as “non-finite” in opposition to “finite” verbal stems which occur when: (i) the verb is in matrix position and is not prefixed, i.e., it thus refers to a past or present event (realis) and (ii) it does not follow any conjunction.

(3.6) a.

ove’eke. pig

b. o-lralrame ma-ridhahe ana ocao. Dyn.Fin-run Stat.Subj-fast that person ‘That person runs fast.’

As shown in the following examples, a majority of (dynamic) verbs take an o- prefix ‘Dyn.Fin’ (from PR *o-a- ‘active-Real-’23). However, the occurrence of certain verb types as main verbs requires the selection of a special allomorph of the dynamic/finite morpheme o-, cf. om-, m- or Ø.

Katamba (1993:27) proposes to “classify a set of morphs as allomorphs of the same morpheme if they are in complementary distribution. Morphs are said to be in complementary distribution if (i) they represent the same meaning or serve the same grammatical function and (ii) are never found in identical contexts.” In the examples given above, o-, om-, m- and Ø- serve the same grammatical function, i.e., they indicate that a verb is dynamic and finite (thus in the realis), and they never occur in identical contexts. The occurrence of these prefixes is not phonologically but rather grammatically conditioned.

3.1.2.2.2 ma- ~ kaUnlike dynamic verbs, stative verb stems are marked with ka- in their non-finite forms. The
grammatical contexts in which stative non-finite verb forms occur are the same as above. As finite verbs, they are usually marked with ma-. I also treat ma- as a grammatically conditioned allomorph of ka-.

3.1.2.2.3 a-…-ae and -ae Another instance of grammatically conditonned allomorph concerns the objective
nominalization of (prototypical) dynamic verbs vs. that of stative verbs. The circumfix a-…-ae is used to obtain the nominalization of dynamic verbs, e.g., kane ‘eat’ > a-kan-ae ‘food’, ’ongolo ‘drink’ > a-’ongol-ae ‘(a) drink’. This circumfix surfaces as -ae, when attached to stative verb roots (prefixed with the non-finite stative marker ka-), e.g., kadhalame ‘love, like’ > kadhalam-ae ‘(who/which) is loved’, ka-sekelre ‘angry at’ > ka-sekelr-ae ‘(who) is being angered at’.

3.1.2.3 Lexically conditioned allomorphs There are also cases of lexically conditioned allomorphs in Mantauran. One such case
involves the formation of plural common nouns, that refer to humans24. To form the plural of such nouns, e.g., valrovalro ‘young woman’, tamatama ‘middle-aged man’, the prefix a- is attached to the root (or the stem), thus yielding forms like a-valrovalro ‘young women’, a-tamatama ‘middle-aged men’. The plural for the word lalake ‘child’ is different. It surfaces as: la-a-lake ‘children’ (see section 6.1).

3.1.2.4 Suppletion There is a rather complex case of suppletion in Mantauran. lili- is the singular form of the
term meaning a ‘(female) friend’. While the plural of kinship terms is expressed through the prefixation of la- to the root, e.g., ivoko- ‘(male) friend’ > la-’ivoko ‘(male) friends’ (cf. § 5.1.4), lili- does not have a plural form like *la-lili. Instead, its plural counterpart is laidhae ‘(female)

24 Plural formation will be discussed in more details in Chapter 5.

45

Elizabeth Zeitoun

friends’. Morphologically speaking, laidhae seems to contain the plural prefix la- but there is actually no root such as idhae with the entailed meaning ‘(female) friend’. laidhae can be used both as a non-vocative or a vocative term. lili-, on the other hand, has a restricted non-vocative usage. Its vocative counterpart is lamae. These facts are summarized in Table 3.1 and further illustrated in the examples that follow.

It is sometimes difficult to decide whether certain morphemes are polysemous or homophonous. This is the case of the morpheme ’i (< PR ki-), which attaches to nouns and verbs.27 As in Puyuma (cf. Ross 2003, Teng Forthcoming), the interpretation of ’i-N can be shown to share the same “semantic core”, cf. “get, obtain”, with the derived stem functioning as a verb. When ’i- attaches to a verbal root, on the other hand, the meaning of the derived stem ’i-V is passive and the subject is the patient or undergoer. Though these two different meanings, cf. ‘get/obtain-N’ and ‘be V-en) might be historically related, I treat the morpheme ’i- in (a) as polysemous and in (b) as homophonous (§ 7.2.2).

’i-vaha ‘accept’ (Lit.: get word), ’i-sasingi ‘take a picture’ ’i-pahai ‘harvest rice’ ’i-vecenge ‘harvest millet’ ’i-valra ‘kill (an) enemy’ ’i-comai ‘kill (a) bear’

b. ’i- ‘passive’, as in:

’i-kane ‘be eaten’ ’i-ange’ange ‘be hurt’

27 Another ’i- ‘wear, take care’ comes from Pan *si-, e.g., ’i- ‘wear’, as in: ’i-pacavo ‘wear leggings’, ’i-kipingi ‘wear clothes’ etc.

There are also polysemous roots, such as the following two antonyms, cf. ma-kocingai ‘difficult, expensive’ and ma-melre’e ‘easy, cheap’, whose specific meanings must be retrieved in context.

3.1.5 Portmanteau morphemes

There are a number of important portmanteau morphemes in Mantauran, among others oand ’i-, ma- and ka- which historically derive from the Proto-Rukai morphemes *w-a-, ky-a-, *ma- and *ka-. Historically, PR *w- indicated the active voice, in contrast to *ki- which marked the (agentive) passive (see Zeitoun 1995, 2003). The prefix a- specified mood, i.e., realis. The

49

Elizabeth Zeitoun

bimorphemic prefixes w-a- adjoined to dynamic verbs while ky-a- could attach to both dynamic and stative verbs (the latter being preceded by ka-). This is still true in other Rukai dialects, as external evidence from Tona illustrates.

(3.22) Tona a. w-a-ba’ay Act-Real-Dyn.NFin:give ‘I gave him money.’

kake mosoa 1S.Nom 2S.Obl

na paiso. Obl money

pasilikay nakoa

Pass-Real-Dyn.NFin:give 2S.Nom from 1S.Obl

‘You were given money by me.’

na paiso. Obl money

In Mantauran, the PR diphtongs *w-a- and *y-a coalesced into o and i, and in this particular instance k has become a glottal ’. As a consequence of these phonological changes, o- has come to indicate in Mantauran that a dynamic/finite verb is in the realis mood and the active voice. Unless necessary, I gloss o- as ‘Dyn.Fin’ even though this gloss renders opaque the original portmanteau function of the morpheme o-, because the opposition in Mantauran between dynamic and stative verbs seems to be prevalent over the distinction between active and passive. The two prefixes maand ka- (respectively glossed as ‘Stat.Fin’ and ‘Stat.NFin’) also carry portmanteau functions: they indicate that a verb is stative, finite and realis.
The prefixes o-, ma- and ka- were introduced and exemplified in the foregoing discussion in relation to grammatically conditioned allormorphs. Their uses and functions will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 7, cf. § 7.1).

3.1.6 Roots

Morphologically, a root is a minimal lexically (non-)dependent unit, i.e., it cannot be divided into smaller sequences. Roots might represent free morphemes, e.g., amece ‘take’, dha’olo ‘rain’, ecenge ‘grasp’, irovo ‘pile up’, kacia ‘scissors’, lamolai ‘story’, ocao ‘person’ etc.), or bound morphemes, which cannot appear unaffixed, e.g., -dhi’i ‘good’ but ma-taa-dhi’i ‘Stat-*-good’ and to-dhi’i ‘put away’ (Lit.: ‘do-good’).
Bound roots include nearly all stative verbs (except ’okolodho ‘afraid’, which might actually not be a stative verb, but rather a dynamic verb), colour terms, two sets of kinship terms used for reference and a set of numeral from one to nine distinct from the set of numerals used in serial counting. Stative verb roots need to be prefixed with ka-/ma- ‘stative’ and these derived stems can undergo further derivations (e.g., causativization, imperativization etc.), (cf. § 7.1). Colour terms can be prefixed by ta- to form a noun, or by a verbal prefix, most commonly ma- (~ka-) ‘stative’ ,

50

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

(cf. § 4.6). There are two sets of kin terms used for reference that are bound: the first set (cf. -tama ‘father’, -tina ‘mother’, -tomo ‘grandfather/grandmother’, -kaka ‘elder sibling’) occurs only in so-called reciprocal constructions (e.g., lama’atama ‘father and son’), the second (cf. ama- ‘father’, ina- ‘mother’, omo- ‘grandfather/grandmother’, kaka- ‘elder sibling’) must be suffixed with a genitive pronoun expressing possession (e.g., ama-li ‘my father’), (cf. § 4.9). Numerals can be used with a verbal prefix, e.g., ma- (~ka-) ‘stative’, to- ‘make, produce, build’, ordinal prefixes, e.g., ’aka- ‘the Nth’ or numeral classifiers, e.g., matara- ‘take, catch, get’, (cf. § 5.10). Some of these bound roots are listed in Table 3.2.

Stems represent derived roots. It happens that derived roots are identical in form to roots. Both pato’o ‘tell’ and okane ‘eat’ are examples of stems. The first is also a root, but can be used as such in an utterance as its form is invariable, e.g., pato’o-lra-imia’e ‘I told you’. The second is further decomposed into a root kane ‘eat’ and a verbal prefix o-.
It is sometimes rather difficult to distinguish roots from stems. So-called “roots” might actually be derived stems which contain an affix that is no further divisible because it has become fossilized and is no longer productively used. I will provide three examples to illustrate this point.
The word ’oponoho ‘self-reference (to the Mantauran people and/or to the place they live)’ might be analyzed, from a synchronic point of view, as a “root” because it can be treated as a “minimal lexically non-dependent unit”. Historically, though, it is derived from the prefixation of ’o- (< PR *swa- ‘from’) to the root ponoho (< PR *ponogo ‘(originally a) name place’).
Identically, it seems that the invariable verb tila, which carries various though related meanings, cf. ‘Let’s go!’~‘Leave!’~‘Get away’, might historically represent the combination of the nominative prefix ta- ‘1PI.Nom’ and the verb ila ‘go’. I first believed that the pronoun -ta attaches to tila, but we actually never get: tila-ta ‘let’s go!’, as in Budai Rukai, cf. ila-ta ki-kali [go-1PI.Nom gather-wild sweet potatoes] ‘Let go and gather sweet potatoes’. Rather, ta- occurs on the following verb, which is therefore marked as non-finite, cf. tila, ta-dhaace-nga! [let’s go 1PI.Nom-Dyn.NFin-leave-already] ‘Let’s go, let’s go!’.
Another case involves the two roots valrovalro ‘young woman’ and savare ‘young man’ and their derived stems avalrovalro and asavasavare, which are, somehow, ambiguous. Both roots can be prefixed with a- to indicate plurality, e.g., a-valrovalro ‘young women’ and a-sava-savare

52

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

‘young men’. This new base, however, when followed by a genitive pronominal suffix, might also carry a particular meaning, cf. avalrovalro-li ‘my girlfriend(s)’ (and not *valrovalro-li) or asavasavare-’o ‘your boyfriend(s)’ (and not *(sava)savare-’o) and seems to constitute an indivisible word. In this case, it is rather difficult to interpret a- as a marker of plurality, because the whole phrase might refer to one person in particular or many persons, as the following examples show:

(3.23) a. la dhona’i ’aolai a-lriho’o-dha

“om-oa

maava’i

avalrovalro-dha...

Dyn.Subj:come girlfriend-3S.Gen

Two reasons can be advanced to explain the lexicalization of a-valrovalro ‘young women’ and a-sava-savare ‘young men’ into avalrovalro ‘girlfriend(s)’ and asavasavare ‘boyfriend(s)’. The first is linguistic, and the second anthropological. From a linguistic point of view, it is not rare in the world languages to employ a plural as a polite form, cf. the distinction in French between tu ‘you (sing)’ and vous ‘you (plur)’. Though that might account for the data at hand, however, I tend to think that the answer has to be fetched in the social organization of the Mantauran, whereby there was no recognition of one’s (unique) girlfriend or boyfriend. Instead, young men and women met in groups and were chaperoned by elders (see Zeitoun and Lin 2003). The terms “young women-Gen”/“young men-Gen” referred to a group of “girls” or “boys”, rending opaque the question of who was whose girlfriend/boyfriend before later being used to refer to a specific and unique person.

3.1.8 Affixes

Affixes are a closed class of bound morphemes. I mean by “closed class” the fact that they can be listed exhaustively if such a task is pursued. They are bound, since they cannot occur independently and must be attached to a root (or a stem), through affixation. They are distinguished in terms of the position they occupy in a word and the function they perform.

53

Elizabeth Zeitoun

A distinction is usually made between “inflectional” and “derivational” affixes. Inflectional affixes are said to exhibit more regular and paradigmatic patterns of affixation; they do not really alter the meaning of the word they attach to, nor do they change its lexical category. By opposition, derivational affixes are irregular, i.e., their applications might be lexically restricted or unpredictable; besides, they usually yield greater semantic, syntactic and morphological changes. Thus, they might cause a change in the valency of a word (as in the case of causativization) or might transform its lexical category (as in the case of verbalization or nominalization).
In the literature on Formosan languages, there has been no real attempt to distinguish inflectional from derivational affixes, except in the work of Starosta (1988 and subsequent studies). I am not in a measure for the time being to distinguish between inflectional and derivational affixes in Mantauran, and no attempt of this kind is made in this study.
3.1.9 Clitics

Clitics are distinguished from affixes in that they do not select their hosts. Affixes, on the contrary, exhibit a high degree of selection with respect to the roots/stems they attach to (Zwicky 1985). As shown in (3.24), in Mantauran, the pronominal clitic -ine29 ‘3S.Obl’ can appear on either sequential verbs, ’atoloro ‘so’ or madhiliange ‘red’ (cf. § 8.4.1.1). One major class of clitics in Mantauran is composed of (im)personal pronouns, which will be further discussed in section 6.2.

(3.24) a. ma-vo’oko ’atolor-ine ma-dhiliange

Stat.Fin-drunk so-3S.Obl

Stat.Fin-red

‘He is drunk so his eyes are red.’

maca-ni. eye-3S.Gen

b. ma-vo’oko ’atoloro

ma-dhiliang-ine

Stat.Fin-drunk so

Stat.Fin-red-3S.Obl

‘He is drunk so his eyes are red.’

maca-ni. eye-3S.Gen

Clitics are distinguished in terms of their relative position at the beginning or at the end of a word and in terms of their relationship with the constituent they attach to. Pro-clitics occur at the beginning of a word (or a phrase/clause), while enclitics (as in the case of -ine ‘3S.Obl’) appear at the end of it. Mantauran only exhibits two pronominal pro-clitics, nao- ‘1S.Nom’ and ta‘1PI.Nom’.

29 Clitics are usually distinguished from affixes through the use of the sign =. No attempt at a written distinction between clitics and affixes will be made here.

(3.25) a. nao-’apece. 1S.Nom-Dyn.NFin:sleep ‘I want to sleep.’

b. ta-dhaace! 1PI.Nom-Dyn.NFin:leave ‘Let’s go.’

It has also been argued that clitics may attach to a phrase as in (3.25a) while others dominate a clause, as in (3.25b). The first are called “phrasal” clitics, and the second are referred to as “clausal” clitics. I am not aware of the existence of “clausal” clitics in Mantauran.

3.2 MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES
This section introduces four morphological processes in Mantauran, affixation, reduplication, compounding and incorporation, the first two being more productive than the last two.
3.2.1 Affixation

Affixes are usually monosyllabic bound morphemes. They are numerous prefixes and suffixes in Mantauran. Only one infix, cf. <in>, has been found; the meaning of this infix is not only opaque; its usage is extremely limited. It has been found in only one instance, cf. c<in>ekelae ‘villager(s)’ (< cekelae ‘all’, though cekel(e) means ‘village’ in the other Rukai dialects) and in combination with another affix, cf. k<in>a-…-ae ‘more and more’. Combinations of affixes as in (3.27a) are also very common in Mantauran. Circumfixes, as in (3.27b), are distinguished from combinations of affixes in that they form a single affix, i.e., neither part can appear independently of the other. Combinations of affixes, on the other hand, may appear independently.

55

Elizabeth Zeitoun

(3.27) a. valrio ‘village’ → ta-i-valrivalri-ae ‘resting time, week-end’ < ta-…ae ‘LocNmz’ + i- ‘at’
b. talropongo ‘hat’ → ki-talropong-ae ‘whose hat?’ < ki-…-ae ‘whose’

3.2.1.1 Different types of prefixes Adelaar (2004) distinguishes different types of prefixes, which are said to represent various
stages in the development of bound morphemes, from ‘anticipating sequences’ to ‘full grammaticalized prefixes’.
‘Anticipating sequences’ are defined as forms derived from a lexical verb, that are prefixed on an auxiliary verb or on the first verb in a series of two, as in (3.28). As they become more independent from the verb they are derived to, they become ‘lexical prefixes’ with a meaning on their own (3.29). At the latest stage, lexical prefixes (such as orientation or directional prefixes) become part of the verbal morphology (3.30). Anticipating sequences have been reported in only four languages, cf. Tsou (Tsuchida 1990), Bunun (Nojima 1996), Siraya (Tsuchida 2000; Adelaar 1997 and 2004) and Thao (Blust 2003), though they have been referred to differently, cf. ‘prefix harmony’ (Tsuchida 2000), ‘affix echoing’ (Blust 2003). In any case, they can be treated as less typical than lexical and orientation prefixes, rather common in the Formosan languages, and in particular Mantauran.

In Mantauran, there is only one prefix that yields “prefix harmony”, cf. to- ‘make, produce, build’. “Prefix harmony” is compulosory if the sequence to-+Num is followed by another denominal verb that relates to ‘making, producing, building’:

To my knowledge, only a few prefixes derive from an independent verb:

Prefix ’ali’irato’a-

Gloss ‘from’ ‘for’ ‘with’

Related verb ’aliki ’iraki to’araki

Gloss ‘(come) from’ ‘(do) for’ ‘use’

but as pointed out by Adelaar (2004), a number of lexical prefixes exhibit verbal alternations identical to that of verbs (most notably o~Ø and m~p). For instance:

(3.34) A. a. b. c. B. a. b.

2) a- is used to form action/state nominalization31 (cf. § 6.3.1).

(3.37) a. a-pa-sola-solate ‘education’ < pa-sola-solate ‘educate’ (Lit.: ‘make-study (hab.)’)

30 Though this analysis might be premature and perhaps incorrect, a morpheme is not treated as a prefix but

rather as an independent morpheme if it does not yield stress shift. Compare:

(i) a. támatama ‘middle-aged man’ ~ á-tamatama ‘middle-aged men’

b. ’ídha

‘yesterday’

~ lo ’ídha

‘tomorrow’

and not *ló’idha 31 It is sometimes difficult to distinguish action/state nominalization from clausal nominalization.

The two usages of a- as a plural marker on nouns and verbs is certainly related, but it is rather difficult to determine whether they should be treated as the same morpheme or as distinct morphemes.

5) -a can be glossed as ‘beyond (in time or space)’. It only occurs with nominals (derived from nouns). As mentioned in Chapter 2 (cf. § 2.4.1), it is rather difficult to distinguish the epenthetic vowel -a inserted in certain nominalized form from this -a prefix. In effect, the occurrence of ain ’aolalr-a-nae ‘groom’s family’ and its non-occurrence in ’avai-nae ‘bride’s family’ cannot be really accounted for. Besides, it should perhaps be more economical to treat a- ‘beyond’ and a‘irrealis’ as the same prefix, but I treat them so far as distinct (though related) morphemes for lack of evidence.

8) -ae is used to form ‘state nominalization’ (cf. § 6.3.1 and § 8.4). The distinction between state nominalization and objective nominalization lies in the (non-)occurrence of the stative prefix ka-. Compare: dhalam-ae ‘affection, love’ and ka-dhalam-ae ‘(who/which) liked/loved’, takolr-ae ‘badness, evilness’ and ka-takolr-ae ‘(who/which) is bad’.

12) -ane is a suffix of restricted usage. It occurs on one dynamic and a few stative verb roots and is used to insult someone (cf. § 4.15). The derived form must be treated as a verb, not as a nominal, as the occurrence of genitive pronouns is ungrammatical. In that respect, it seems that -ane can be opposed to -ae ‘objective nominalization’, but even so, its meaning remains ill-understood.

20) i- ‘at’ is a locative prefix used as a verbalizer. It never occurs as a free (locative) morpheme in Mantauran, as it does in other Formosan languages, e.g., Paiwan or Amis. The occurrence of i- is restricted to locative nouns, as the following examples show (cf. § 4.8 and 5.3):

(3.71) a. b. c. d.

i-valrio ‘rest’ (Lit.: ‘be in the village’) < valrio ‘village’ i-aleve ‘be below’ < aleve ‘below’ i-lraodho ‘be down(wards)’ < lraodho ‘down(wards)’ i-latadhe ‘be outside’ < latadhe ‘outside’

29) kapa…-nga ‘all, every’ represents the combination of kapa- and -nga ‘Sup’. It attaches to common nouns to mark collectivity. When it attaches to [+human] nouns, the occurrence of the plural a- and the reduplication of the root (if not a lexicalized reduplicated root) is usually necessary. The occurrence of kapa-…-nga on nouns yields plural agreement on the verb on the lexical or the morphological level. On the lexical level, kapa-N-nga usually occurs with the (quantifier) verb (o-)cekelae ‘all’. On the morphological level, it yields the reduplication of the predicate,(cf. § 6.1.5).

34) lama’a- is a bimorphemic prefix (< la- ‘plural’ + ma’a- ‘reciprocal’) that occurs on kinship terms that function as arguments to express a ‘converse’ relationship (following Litchenberk’s (2000) terminology) (cf. § 4.9, 6.1.6 and 7.2.6). In co-occurrence with a base that is not reduplicated, lama’a- marks a ‘dual’ reciprocal (two persons are involved), e.g., la-ma’a-tama ‘father and child (daughter or son)’. It expresses a ‘pluractional’ reciprocal (three persons or more involved) when followed by a reduplicated base, e.g., la-ma’a-tama-tama ‘father and children’.

132) ’asi- is a prefix of restricted usage, that has been found in only one occurrence, attaching to the noun ka’olo to form a verb, ’asi-ka’olo. The meaning of ’asi- is still unaccounted for, and whether it is composed of a bi-morphemic prefix is an open question.

3.2.2 Reduplication

Mantauran displays a large array of reduplication patterns, many of which are also found in other Formosan languages (cf. Blust 1998, 2001 and 2003b, Chang 1998, Adelaar 2000, Li and Tsuchida 2001, Lu 2003, Tseng 2003, Yeh 2003, Zeitoun and Wu 2005 and forthcoming, Lee

forthcoming). Despite this apparent variety, it seems that reduplication applies more productively on verbs than on nouns. Marantz (1982:437) defines reduplication as a “morphological process relating a base form of a morpheme or stem to a derived form that may be analyzed as being constructed from the base via the affixation (or infixation) of phonemic material which is necessarily [my emphasis, EZ] identical in whole or in part to the phonemic content of the base form.” For the sake of convenience, I will stick to this definition in the discussion of reduplication in Mantauran

3.2.2.1 Lexicalized reduplication Lexicalized reduplication consists of historically reduplicated monosyllables. These
reduplicated forms are usually characterized by the fact that: 1) they do not have attested simplex counterpart:

(3.325) a. valrovalro b. velevele

‘young woman’ ‘banana’

(<*valro) (<*vele)

(3.326) a. o-hisihisi b. o-kelrakelrange c. o-moromoro d. o-pangepange e. o-petepete f. o-ringiringi g. o-savesave h. o-vengevenge i. o-ve’eve’e

‘saw’ ‘beat’ ‘rinse (one’s mouth)’ ‘blossom’ ‘cover with a cloth’ ‘fry’ ‘rinse’ ‘roll into, encircle’ ‘windy’

(<*o-hisi) (<*o-kelrange) (<*o-moro) (<*o-pange) (<*o-pete) (<*o-ringi) (<*o-save) (<*o-venge) (<*o-ve’e)

2) they can undergo quite productively the same reduplicated patterns (e.g., CVCVreduplication and Ca- reduplication) as other words do.

(3.327) a. o-kelra-kelrakelrange ’ini-ka-kelrakelrange
b. o-venge-vengevenge ’ini-va-vengevenge
c. ta-ve’e-ve’eve’-ae d. ’a-hisi-hisihisi e. ’a-moro-moromoro

‘beat (often), keep on beating’

‘beat oneself’

‘(often) roll (into)/encircle’

‘encircle oneself’

‘windy place’

(ta-…-ae ‘LocNmz’)

‘saw’

(< ’a- ‘InstNmz’)

‘toothpaste, toothbrush’

I also classify among lexicalized reduplication terms used as:

130

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

1) generic reference for humans (e.g., ‘middle-aged man’, ‘middle-aged woman’, ‘old man/woman’, ‘relative’ etc.) as well as their derived verbal counterparts. These forms, though historically derived from kinship terms, exhibit quite different morpho-syntactic characteristics that make them a “whole” and no longer divisible entity (cf. § 4.9):

(3.328) a. tamatama b. takataka c. palrapalra d. titina

‘middle-aged man’ ‘older (sibling, cousin)’ ‘relative’ ‘middle aged woman’

(cf. -tama ‘father’) (cf. taka- ‘older sibling’) (cf. palra- ‘spouse’) (cf. -tina ‘mother’)40

(3.329) a. ma-tamatama ‘be a middle-aged man’

b. ma-takataka ‘be older’

c. ma-palrapalra ‘be a relative’

d. ma-titina

‘be a middle aged woman’

(< *ma-tama) (< *ma-taka) (< *ma-palra) (< *ma-tina)

2) certain verbs such as: o-dhaadhaace ‘walk’, o-’ape’apece ‘lie down’, o-’apa’apa’a ‘lay a mat’, om-alraalra ‘greet’ which either have a different (though related) lexical meaning from the original verb they derive from, or do not have any corresponding non-reduplicated form:

(3.330) a. o-dhaadhaace b. o-’ape’apece c. o-’apa’apa d. om-alraalra

‘walk’ ‘lie down’ ‘lay a mat’ ‘greet’

(< o-dhaace ‘leave’) (< o-’apece ‘sleep’) (< *o-’apa’a; cf. ’apa’a ‘mat’) (< om-alra ‘take’)

3.2.2.2 Full vs. partial reduplication Other patterns of reduplication occur more productively and to each reduplicated form
corresponds a simplex counterpart.

(3.331) a. o-solate ‘study’ ~ o-sola-solate ‘be studying’

b. o-kane ‘eat’

~ o-kane-kane ‘keep on eating’

Two major reduplicative patterns can be distinguished: full reduplication and partial reduplication.
Full reduplication further subsumes three subpatterns, CVCV- reduplication, CV.Vreduplication and rightward reduplication.

40 titina does not fit well in this pattern as having evolved from a reduplicated monosyllable but there is actually no form as *tinatina. At this stage, I am not sure whether it should be treated as a loan word but I am including it in this section because it is, like other lexical items, a lexicalized reduplicated form.

The semantic functions carried out by full, CVCV- and rightward reduplication are rather quite similar. These three reduplication patterns indicate plurality in nouns along with the plural marker a- for common human nouns and la- for non-common nouns, continuative or repetitive aspect with dynamic verbs and intensification with stative verbs. They can also refer to a plurality of participants in reciprocals (both in co-occurrence with dynamic and stative verbs as well as nouns), and frequently co-occur with three types of nominalizers, a-…-ae ‘objective nominalization’, ta-…-ae ‘locative nominalization’ and ’a- ‘instrumental nominalization’.
The meanings carried out by CV.V-reduplication are slightly different. It entails a diminutive or collective meaning in nouns, a comparative degree in stative verbs, and habitual or repetitive aspect in dynamic verbs.
Partial reduplication includes CV- reduplication and Ca- reduplication. The semantic function(s) is/are rather difficult to define with precision. The co-occurrence of a prefix (that actually yields Ca- reduplication) determines the interpretation of the whole sequence, e.g., in co-occurrence with ’ini- ‘self’, ’ini-Ca- implies reflexivity’.

3.2.2.2.1 Full reduplication The term “full reduplication” refers to the copy of the whole disyllabic root:

(3.332) a. -taka ‘older sibling’ ~ la-ma’a-taka-taka ‘three (or more) siblings’

b. -tama ‘father’

~ la-ma’a-tama-tama ‘father and children’

c. -tomo ‘father’

~ la-ma’a-tomo-tomo ‘grandparent and grandchildren’

(<la- ‘plural for non-common nouns’; ma’a- ‘reciprocal for stative verbs and kinship terms)

~

b. o-kane ‘eat’

~

c. o-cenga’a ‘drive in a nail’ ~ d. o-odho ‘carry on back’ ~

o-lrodho-lrodho ‘be mixing’

o-kane-kane

‘keep on eating’

kane-kane

‘(s.o’s) eating’

makini-kana-kan-ae ‘all keep on eating’41

(< makini-kan-ae ‘all eat’)

o-cenga-cenga’a ‘be driving in a nail’

o-’odho-’odho

‘be carrying on back’

(3.334) a. o-lrodho ‘mix’

~ a-lrodho-lrodh-ae ‘mixture’ (<a-…-ae ‘ObjNmz’)

41 There has been a debate in the literature (cf. for instance Tseng 2003, Lu 2003, Blust 2003b, Lee 2005) about whether the reduplicated portion is on the left or on the right (cf. ‘leftward’ vs. ‘rightward reduplication’). This instance shows that (i) reduplication takes place after suffixation (thus makini-kan-ae > makini-kana-kan-ae), and that the reduplicated portion is on the left of the root, as it copies the derived stem (cf. kan-ae).

As mentioned above, I include under “full reduplication” three subpatterns, CVCV-, CV.V and rightward reduplication.
CVCV- reduplication applies to tri- and quadri-syllabic roots and copies the first two syllables, CVCV- or CVV- (if the second syllable starts with a vowel), leaving out the last or last two syllables. The final syllable might be composed of a consonant and an echo vowel or a vowel. As pointed out by Blust (2003), reduplicated syllables are always disyllabic and I believe that it is this constraint that prevents tri- or quadri-syllabic roots from undergoing complete (or “full”) reduplication.

CV.V- applies to disyllabic and trisyllabic roots. It copies the first two syllables but leaves out the second consonant, if any.

(3.342) a. dha’ane b. o-dhodho’o c. ma-dhalame

3.2.2.2.2 Partial reduplication I divide “partial” reduplication into two main sub-patterns, CV- reduplication and Ca-
reduplication. Partial reduplication is less productive than full reduplication in Mantauran. Ca-reduplication (as defined by Blust 1998) refers to the copy of the first consonant of the
root and the addition of a fixed vowel /a/ or the occurrence of /a/ if the word begins with a vowel. Whilst it is reported to be extremely productive in a fairly number of Formosan languages (Amis, Thao, Saisiyat, Siraya, Pazeh, Puyuma, Atayal, Paiwan), it is always yielded by prefixation in Mantauran (cf. ’ini-Ca- + verb ‘oneself’, ma-Ca- + verb ‘reciprocal’). These are the only cases where affixes can also undergo reduplication.

(3.347) a. o-aha’a b. o-colo c. ma-dhalame d. to-dha’ane

‘cook’

~

‘kill a pig’

~

‘like, love’ ~

‘build a house’ ~

’ini-a-aha’a ’ini-ca-colo ’ini-ka-kadhalame ’ini-ta-todha’ane

‘cook oneself’ ‘kill (a pig) onself’ ‘like, love oneself’ ‘build a house oneself’

CV reduplication involves the reduplication of the first syllable of a root. It is extremely rare in Mantauran.

(3.348) a. ma-oloho-nga ‘grown up’

b. lrima

‘five’

~ ma-a-lo-loho-nga ‘all grown up’

~ apa’a-lri-lrima

‘five for each’

3.2.2.2.3 Triplication I hereby follow Blust (2001) in defining triplication as involving the reduplication of the same part
or the totality of the root twice in a unitary process, e.g., Thao apa ‘carry’ > /apa-apa-apa-n/ [apapápan] ‘be carried’ (Blust, 2003b:196). This term is to be distinguished from serial reduplication, which consists of the reduplication of a segment that has already been reduplicated (Blust 2001), e.g.,

1 35

Mantauran ma-ta-tobi ‘cry for each other’ > ma-ta-tobi-tobi ‘cry for one another’. I have found a few instances of reduplication in Mantauran.

(3.349) a. mena-mena-menanae ‘every day’ < men-a-nae ‘(one) day’ b. laha-laha-lahane ‘great grandchildren’ < l(a)-ahane ‘grandchildren’ c. kama-ka-vahe-vahe-vahe’e ‘continuously tired’ < ma-vahe’e ‘tired’

Bowden (2001:91) defines compounding in Taba as follows: “Compounding occurs when two words, neither of which is a clitic, fuse together phonologically to create a new form which now behaves as a single phonological [my emphasis, EZ] word.” For instance:

(3.350)

ntonololan n-tono-lolan 3S.Gen-look at-path/road ‘lizard’

3.2.3.1 Simplex and complex compounds In Mantauran, the most (and perhaps sole ?) productive pattern of compounding consists of
two separate words that are linked in a lexical compound but in which each of the constituent remains phonologically separate. Katamba (1993:321) refers to this kind of compounds as “copulative compounds because they have two words which are coupled (or conjoined).” These words might be simplex, i.e., unaffixed as in (3.187) or complex as in (3.188). The meaning of such compounds is usually straightforward, except in the case of (3.189), treated as a lexicalized compound.

Though any compound can be actually created – cf. for instance the occurrence of lamolai solate ‘story book’ (< lamolai ‘story’, solate ‘paper, book’), ’aaico’ono solate ‘diary’ (< ’aico’ono ‘remember, remembrance’) in the newly edited Mantauran textbooks (2004), compounding remains rather rare. Besides, only nouns (or derived nominals) are found to fit such a construction. There are two examples that seem to contradict this claim, though: in the following examples, aloalopo ‘hunt/hunting’ and pi’api’a ‘make/making’ could be analyzed as verbs. However, they function as derived nominals in these two examples:

(3.355) a. alo-alopo

3.2.3.2 Nominal head in compounds The head of the compound is not easy to identify, because the ordering of the two nouns is
rather free:

(3.356) a. kipingi ovale ~ clothes body hair ‘pull-over’

There is a test that seems to permit to identify the head, though. The noun that is the head cannot be coordinated. The noun that does not function as the head can:

3.2.4 Incorporation

Incorporation is described as a phenomenon by which a word, usually a verb forms a compound with its direct object. Such a phenomena has just started to receive a little attention in the study of the Formosan languages (cf. Wu and Chang 2005). Incorporation has two consequences. The first is syntactic and the second is semantic. On the syntactic leve, it leads to the deletion of an argument of the verb. On the semantic level, the incorporated nominal argument is understood as generic and indefinite. So far, I am unaware of such a phenomena in Mantauran.

Lexico-semantic categories
This chapter introduces focuses on lexically “marked” words42: loan words, doublets, (near) synonyms, lexically “empty” words, baby talk, colour terms, shape terms, directionals, kin terms (and related words), age terminology, social hierarchy, personal names and households’ names, language names and ethnonyms, greetings and related formulaic expressions as well as insults. The morpho-syntax of most of these “marked” words is explained in Chapters 5 through 8. 4.1 LOAN WORDS
There are numerous loan words in Mantauran, most of which were introduced during the Japanese period. Though loans from Taiwanese and Mandarin Chinese are also used in daily conversation, reference to Japanese is persistent. Other loans have been borrowed from neighbouring villages (e.g., mairange ‘sweet potato’, drekai ‘Rukai’, solate ‘paper’). Table 4.1 lists out well-established loan words, their origin and their known equivalent or near-equivalent in Mantauran.43
42 I use the term “marked” for want of a better term. 43 Other loans include -ali ‘(female) friend’ (that only occurs in la-ma’a-ali-ali ‘three (or more) friends together’), cf. Mt lili- ‘(female) friend’ and -palange ‘spouse’ (only found in la-ma’a-palange ‘husband and wife’), cf. Mt palra-~lamengae- ‘spouse’, both likely borrowed from Tona. Compare:
(i) a. la-ma’a-ali-ali ~ la-ma’a-lili-li ‘three (or more) friends together’ b. lili-li ‘my friend’ ~ *ali-li
(ii) a. la-ma’a-palange ~ *la-ma’a-lamengae ~ *la-ma’a-palra ‘husband and wife’ b. palra-li ~ lamengae-li ‘my husband/wife’ ~ *palange-li

44 Informants pronounce dekai ‘Budai’ as drekai and dekai. Since both /d/ and /dr/ have merged into /dh/
in Mantauran, that’s perhaps the source of the confusion between /d/ and /dr/. 45 In both Mantauran and Tona, koli’i has replaced the PAN inherited word *vaLi ‘sun’. It is difficult to
determine whether Mantauran has borrowed from Tona or whether Tona has borrowed from Mantauran. 46 I presume it is a loan from Tona Rukai, as k- (preserved in a majority of lexical words) is reflected as ’- in
this particular instance.

4.2 DOUBLETS
Doublets are defined as “phonologically similar forms with identical glosses occurring within the same dialect” (Ferrell, 1982:47). Ferrell (1982) reports that doublets occur fairly commonly in Paiwan. That does not seem to be the case in Mantauran, though there are examples of doublets. The most intruiguing one is ’angato ~ nga’ato ‘tree, wood, brushwood’, as these two forms share quite the same morphological derivations:

4.3 SYNONYMS AND NEAR SYNONYMS

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

There are numerous synonyms and near synonyms in Mantauran. The semantic distinction between some of these is rather easy to explain. Others are more difficult to account for.
Those that are discussed in this section are of interest because they will be mentioned in other parts of this grammar.

4.3.1 Synonyms with rather clear-cut semantic distinction 4.3.1.1 aha’a~akanae~va’oro ‘food’
aha’a~akanae~va’oro can all be glossed as ‘food’, as in (4.4) though they bear rather distinct semantic distinction: aha’a ‘(cooked) food, cooking’ is an action nominal; akanae ‘food’ is the nominalized form of kane ‘eat’ and va’oro refers to ‘(cooked) rice’.

4.3.1.2 (o-)lrivate~(m-)olravele ‘surpass’ To form complex numbers, (m-)olravate47 or o-lrivate ‘surpass, exceed’ can be introduced
after la ‘and’ as in:

ta-ka-ma-lrima-le

SubjNmz-Stat.NFin-tens-five-tens

‘250’

olravale and olrivate can also substitute in the following example:

(4.7) a.

olravale-ng-iae

moni

Dyn.Fin:surpass-already-1S.Obl Moni

‘Moni surpasses me.’

= b. o-lrivate-ng-iae

moni

Dyn.Fin-surpass-already-1S.Obl Moni

‘Moni surpasses me.’

This is not always the case, though, because (m-)olravale refers to a degree while (o-)lrivate refers to an action.

(4.8) a.

olravale-ng-iae Dyn.Fin:surpass-already-1S.Obl ‘Moni surpasses me in heigth.’

4.4 LEXICALLY “EMPTY WORDS”

There are at least three lexically “empty” words in Mantauran: o-poa ‘make, do’, omi ‘like that’ and ani’ia ‘as pointed out’. I mean by “empty” the fact that they are losing their lexical meaning (or have no lexical meaning), and are progressively being used as grammatical words.

4.4.1 The verb o-poa ‘make, do’: toward the grammaticalization of an “auxiliary” verb There is no doubt that o-poa ‘make, do, put’ is a verb: it shares the morphological
characteristics and syntactic distribution of other verbs. Morphologically, it has an o- marking in finite clauses, and a Ø- marking in non-finite and subjunctive contexts. Syntactically, it can (i) occur in matrix or embedded position, (ii) follow conjunctions such as mani ‘then’ and la ‘and’, (iii) be followed by pronouns, aspectual markers, object complements or verbs.

Though o-poa can function as a full lexical verb meaning ‘make, do, put’ – it functions like a periphrastic causative verb (cf. § 7.2.3) – it also occurs redundantly after or before a verb. In that case, its semantic meaning is not so clear.

In these latter examples, o-poa functions somehow like a supporting verb, thus my treatment of o-poa as being grammaticalized into an auxiliary verb. This grammaticalization process is still on-going52, as the pre- and post-verbal position of o-poa in (4.23) attests.
It should be noted that the occurrence of o-poa as a full lexical verb evolving into a supporting/auxiliary verb is not specific to Mantauran. It is also found at least in Tona and Maga, as the following examples illustrate:

(4.24) Tona

rice

‘When people cooked, they put one grain of rice.’ (Hsin, 2002)

52 My wording in Zeitoun and Lin (2003:202) was certainly too strong, as I suggested that opoa~poa (and related forms in other dialects) “seems to function as [my emphasis] an auxiliary verb in all the Rukai dialects.”

nono

tbalngani-dra…

and Dyn.NFin:make

Dyn.Subj:stir shoulder-3S.Gen

‘He stirred with his arm…’

I consider this process as a parallel drift, though. It can be stated, based on external evidence, that MT poa derives from the prefixation of the causative pa- to the verb oa ‘go’, cf. *pa-oa ‘Caus-Dyn.NFin:go’53. As shown above, the resulting stem shares the same morphological derivations as that of any other dynamic verbs. This morphological formation (i.e., the prefixation of pa- to a root, yielding to the lexicalization of a new verb form) is found in another verb, cf. o-piki~piki ‘put’ that reflects *pa-i-kay. In Tona, on the contrary, paowa does not take the bimorphemic prefix w-a- (cf. *w-a-paowa) – it is thus invariable – and the formation of this verb parallels that of ‘put’, cf. pa-’ikay (and not *w-a-pa-’ikay). Besides, in that dialect, the “causative” meaning implied by paowa is more transparent than in Mantauran.

4.4.2 The distinction between omi ‘like that’ and mani ‘then’ Mantauran is undergoing other syntactic changes. This is readily seen in the comparison of
mani ‘then’ with omi ‘like that’. mani ‘then’ occurs in clause-final or clause-initial position to link two clauses, though its
omission is not rare. In discourse, it is also employed to mark a pause (e.g., mani…). It can be followed by another verb but it must be treated as a conjunction, as unlike verbs in that it never attracts pronouns (cf. *mani-lrao *‘then-1S.Nom’), aspectual suffixes (cf. *mani-nga *‘then-already’) or negators (cf. *mani-ka-i *‘then-Neg-3S.Gen’) and must be followed by a non-finite verb. The examples given in (4.26a-d) form a whole paragraph. The clauses are numbered as C1, C2, C3 etc…

‘(That’s how) we Mantauran learnt that actually we were (Rukai).’

The use of mani ‘then’ was very productive in the speech of my older informant (Lü Yu-zhi). It shows to be still quite productive in the speech of younger informants, though they prefer to make use of another form, omi ‘like that’. I never heard that form in the conversations I had with Lü Yu-zhi and I have no such record in my fieldnotes. As mentioned in the introduction, she passed away in 2000, before I had realized this on-going syntactic change, so I never had the chance to confirm with her whether she did or not use this form and whether this latter form belongs to a newer register. In any case, only mani (but not omi) is found in Ogawa and Asai’s (1935) texts (pp. 390-393).
Unlike mani ‘then’, omi, which does not seem to have any lexical content, occurs in any position. In final position, it serves to link two clauses. In any other position, it usually serves to indicate “hearsay”. In a few examples, it is also used as a verb of saying. It must be analyzed as a verb because (i) it seems to share (at least to some extent) the same inflections, cf. om-i and (ii) it can be followed by a pronoun. That pronoun is usually an oblique pronoun. In most examples, it co-refers rather quite unexpectedly with the subject in visibility and plurality. omi differs from verbs, though and behaves like mani in that (i) it cannot be followed by an aspectual suffix (cf. *omi-nga ‘like that-already’) and (ii) it must be followed by a non-finite verb. omi always precedes

‘(They) asked him/her (again): “Why did you laugh at us?”’

Historically, omi might be derived from om-ia ‘(say) so’. om-ia usually occurs in initial or final position as a verb of saying. It can follow mani (and be suffixed with pronouns and aspectual suffixes) but never occurs after omi. It can precede it though.

The distinction between omi and om-ia is sometimes difficult to make, as in the following example, for instance. mani follows the sequential form i-idhe, and though I analyze i- as the alternation of om-ia ‘(say) so’, it could be also treated as deriving from omi ‘like that’.

4.4.3 Distribution of the verb ani’ia ‘as pointed out’ The semantically empty verb ani’ia (which is tentatively glossed as ‘as pointed out’ is
another form that never appeared in the speech of my late informant, Lü Yu-zhi, but is used rather quite frequently (though not so much productively as omi) by my other informant, Guan Yue-yin, when she narrates a story and wants to refer to what has been said earlier. This form is treated as a verb because the subjunctive form oni’ia has been found in the corpus. I have not been able to uncover occurrences of ani’ia followed by aspectual suffixes or pronominal clitics, though. It can also function as a noun.

4.5 BABY TALK
There used to be a special lexical register employed by adults as a mean of comMonication with children until they reached three or four years of age. Tsuchida (1998) was the first to draw the attention to this register. I was, however, only able to record a few nursery words, which younger informants do not understand or remember anymore55:

4.6 COLOUR TERMS

There are only five colour terms in Mantauran, -dhiliange ‘red’, -ecelrange ‘black’, -poli ‘white’, -vala’ava’a ‘yellow’ and -’aleke’eke ‘green/blue’. The root is bound. It can function as a noun if prefixed by ta- ‘inalienable’ and as a verb when prefixed (among others) by the ma- (~ka-) ‘stative’.

Verb ma- (stative) madhiliange maecelrange mapoli mavala’ava’a ma’aleke’eke

Sole the distinction between dark and light colours is made, through the prefixation of mati‘very’ and ’ako- ‘barely’ to the verbal stem.

‘dark blue/green’ ’ako-ka-’aleke’eke

‘light red’56 ‘barely black’ ‘barely white’57 ‘light yellow’ ‘light blue/green’

The noun tadhiliange ‘red’ can be used to refer to foreigners (i.e., white people from the US or Europe)58, cf.:

(4.36) a. ta-dhiliange-mo’o ocao. Inal-red-2S.Nom person ‘You are a foreigner.’

b. ta-dhiliange

ocao-’o.

Inal-red

person-2S.Gen

‘You are a foreigner.’

56 Equated to ‘pink’. 57 Equated to ‘creamy white’, not really/completely white. 58 The use of ‘red’ to refer to foreigners from the US or Europe must date back from the XVIIth century,
when the aborigines of Taiwan starting to encounter foreigners, the Dutch established in the South of Taiwan
(for a short recapitulation of the history of Taiwan and in particular the settlement of the Dutch in the South
of Taiwan, refer to Adelaar (1997:362-363)).

166

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

and serves as a base to form makatadhiliange ‘a red sweet potato’. tapoli refers the white of the eye. ma-ecelrange can be used to refer to black people, cf.:

(4.37) a. ta-ecelrange

‘He is (a) black (person).’

and derives as ta-ka-ecelrang-ae to signify ‘dirt’ (Lit.: ‘black spot’).

4.7 TERMS RELATED TO SHAPE
Terms related to shapes are nearly all bound forms. Some of them can be prefixed by ta‘inalienable’ and form a noun (the base undergoes CV.V reduplication). They can be prefixed by the stative marker ma- (~ka-) and function as verbs or be dynamicized by the prefixation of to‘make, produce’ to the root e.g., to-lrimocoho ‘make round’.

4.8 DIRECTIONALS
There are no preposition-like elements (in, at, from, to, on top of, behind etc.) in Mantauran (see section 5.3 for a justification of this claim), these notions being rendered either by affixes or nouns.59
4.8.1 Orientation and directional affixes Orientation and directional affixes were exemplified in section 3.2.1.2. They are given in
Table 4.6.

59 This is true of other Formosan languages, e.g., Tsou (see Zeitoun, 2005:265) and Seediq (see Tsukida, 2005:305-306). In Tsou, for instance, locational notions are rendered either by nouns, as in (i) or by verbs, as in (ii):
(i) ta skovskovna-si ‘on top of’

(ii) pan to mo

con ci evi ci mo

bicibi

to

exist Obl AV.RLS one Rel tree Rel AV.RLS adjacent to:AV Obl

emoo

house

‘There is a tree beside the house.’

In Seediq, prepositional phrases are derived from verbs, e.g., pa’ah ‘come from; ~ p<en>a’ah ‘came from’, as in (iii), or nouns as quri ‘toward, about, in the direction of’.

(iii) p<en>a’ah tehipaq ka laqi niyi. <Prf>from Taipei Nom child Prx ‘This child is from Taipei.’

(iv) ’ini biyaw bu-an hidaw ka quri

prefixation of verbal prefixes, e.g., ma- ‘stative’, m-o- ‘to’, po- ‘Mouvement causative’. Their (possible and impossible) derivations are given in Table 4.7 and further illustrated in the examples that follow.

These two sets of lexical items behave quite similarly, but are discussed in turn in the following section.

4.9.1 Nearest (older) relatives Mantauran Rukai exhibits three different but related words for kin terms, used in a
non-vocative context:

bound form -tama -tina -tomo -taka

bound form+ProGen ama-+ProGen ina-+ProGen omo-+ProGen taka-(+ProGen)

free form aamae iinae oomoe taakae

-tama, -tina, -tomo and -taka are bound forms which occur only in reciprocal construction, e.g., ‘father and son(s)/daughter(s), ‘mother and daughter(s)/son(s)’, ‘grandparent and grandchild(ren)’, ‘two (or more) siblings’. The reciprocal construction (for details, see section 6.1.6 and 7.2.6) can be schematically represented as follows:

(4.40) a. (la-)ma’a-bound kin root ‘dual’ (one adult/elder and one child/grandchild)

b. (la-)ma’a-Red-bound kin root ‘plural’ (one adult/elder and at least two

children/youngsters)

aamae, iinae, oomoe, taakae are free forms but their usage is extremely restricted in that they can only refer to one’s (grand)parent/older sibling and are respective synonyms of: ama-li ‘my father’, ina-li ‘my mother’, omo-li ‘my grandparent’ and taka-li. Thus, in the above example, omo-li can be replaced by oomoe:

The lexeme ’adhi ‘younger sibling’ exhibits the following characteristics: 1) It functions like words for nearest (older) relatives in that (i) it is a bound root; (ii) ’aadhi is an equivalent to ’adhi-li.

60 palra- can be used as a base to form a reciprocal, but the sequence: (la-)ma’a-palra does not refer to ‘husband and wife’ but rather to ‘(two) relatives’. The reason for this semantic shift is ill-understood at this stage.

4.9.3 Lexicalized root forms Lexemes referring to generic terms such as ‘middle-aged (wo)man’, ‘old (wo)man’, relatives
etc. are actually derived from kin terms, but synchronically behave like common nouns on the morphosyntactic level (cf. section 6.1). Thus, I treat them as lexicalized root forms. They include:

61 Doublet form: la-ma-’ivo-’ivoko ‘three (or more) friends’.

4.9.4 The terms for ‘child’ and their derivations The term to designate one’s child (either own child, adopted or in-law) is lalake. The generic
term for ‘child’ is lroolai. Both function as common nouns. Their respective derivational forms also occur in complementary distribution: cf. toalake ‘give birth’, ’iolrolai ‘bear a child, give birth, take care of a baby’.62

4.10 AGE TERMINOLOGY

In table 4.12, I have listed the different words to designate people at different stages of their life. All these words function as common words, but because they refer to human referents, they differ form other common words in their intrinsic morpho-sytnactic properties (cf. section 6.1).

4.11 SOCIAL HIERARCHY The traditional society included different levels: (i) nobles and chieves, (ii) commoners (who
served as servants to the nobles and chieves), (iii) “middle-class” people (neither nobles nor commoners), who were “free” (i.e., they did not need to work for nobles and chieves) and (iv) “brave” hunters.

The Mantauran also make an egocentric distinction between what belongs to or is located around them and what is “outside”. Such a division is a very pervasive one and includes distinct terms for persons, house(holds), villagers, territory etc….

The Mantauran choose their personal names according to the “noble/chief-commoner” hierarchy (“noble” names are preceded by an asterisk in the tables that follow), i.e., if a baby is born in a noble household, s/he is entitled to a “noble” name; otherwise, the parents need to “buy a

As shown in Table 4.15 and 4.16, names are sex-specific and are usually chosen among one’s ancestors, preferably grandmothers or grandfathers. Less commonly, names can be “borrowed” from another Rukai village, from which one of the parents originate. To each adult name usually corresponds a “juvenile” name, a name used during enfancy. Names that serve when scolding someone can be used also during adulthood. I was not able to determine the lexical origin of personal names in Mantauran and ignore whether they correspond to nature (as in Tsou, for instance).

The Mantauran also have household’s names (or more commonly “family” names), provided in Table 4.17. It is easier to understand the word formation of household’s names and identify the root (e.g., la-savar-ae < savare ‘young man’; la-ma’a-valrio < valrio ‘village’) but even so, I was unable to get the stories that originated in the naming of these households. Each household name is prefixed by the plural marker la-, which occurs in specific circumstances, as explained in section 5.1.

4.13 LANGUAGE NAMES AND ETHNONYMS
Ethnonyms, which are usually derived from name places (cf. §6.1 for a discussion on noun classes), are often used for language names, as the following table shows. These names can further be derived with a number of affixes, e.g., maka- ‘from’, tali- ‘belong to’, ’ako-…(-ae) ‘speak’.

4.14 GREETINGS AND RELATED FORMULAIC EXPRESSIONS
Blust (Forthcoming: Chap 4) remarks: “Greetings constitute perhaps the most universal type of formulaic speech, and as such can be regarded as part of the lexicon of a language. The common greeting of encounters over much of the Austronesian world is literally ‘where are you going?’.” This formulae is only used in Mantauran when two persons meet on the road. Reference to the past as in (4.52a) is more likely than to the future as in (4.53b):
(4.52) a. a-o-a-’o? ObjNmz-Dyn.NFin:go-ObjNmz:Real-2S.Gen ‘Where did you go?’
b. o-a-i-’o? Dyn.NFin:go-ObjNmz-Irr-2S.Gen ‘Where are you going?’
Other greetings can be pronounced when meeting someone, depending on the context. In a same family, early in the morning, one might say:
(4.53) a. ’omaca-nga-ka-’o? Dyn.Fin:wake up-already-Neg-2S.Gen ‘Good morning’ (Lit.: ‘Have you waken up already?’)
b. ka-’omaca-nga-’o? in fact-Dyn.NFin:wake up-already-2S.Gen ‘Good morning’ (Lit.: ‘You are indeed awake!’)
If meeting someone in the street and if s/he has not met that person for some time (one or two days), s/he will utter:
(4.54) a. sarivo-nga-’o miss-already-2S.Gen ‘Miss you/Long time no see’
b. ma-sarivo-lra-imia’e. Stat.Fin-miss-1S.Nom-2S.Obl ‘I miss you.’
182

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

When coming back to the village (after a long absence), one can hear:

(4.55)

ka-kaava’i-nga-’o! in fact-Dyn.NFin:come-already-2S.Gen Lit.: ‘Indeed, you have come!’

If that person is not responding or did not hear, his/her interlocutor will say:

(4.56)

’oidhai-lra-imia’e! say hello-1S.Nom-2.Obl Lit.: ‘I say hello to you!’

If knowing that a person has encountered difficulties or is ill, s/he will ask:

(4.57) a. ki-polringao-mo’o? Neg-matter-2S.Nom ‘How are you?’

a’. a-ik-a-’o ObjNmz-Dyn.NFin:exist-ObjNmz:Irr-2S.Gen ‘How are you?’

ka polringao? Neg matter

b. o-dhalrimi-nga-ka-’o? Dyn.Fin-endure-already-Neg-2S.Gen ‘How are you?’ (Lit.: ‘Can you endure?’—said to an ill person)

m-iki

valrio?

why

have time-2S.Gen Dyn.Subj-be at

village

‘You have time to stay at home?/You seldom are at home!’

There are also different formulaic expressions for goodbyes and farewells: - at night:

(4.59) a. ta-’apece-nga! 1PI.Nom-Dyn.NFin:sleep-already ‘Let’s go to sleep!’

183

b. maongo-nga, kai

’apece-a-nga!

late-already should Dyn.Subj:sleep-Imp-already

‘It’s late already, you should sleep!’

- when leaving: (4.60) a. oaramac-a!
Dyn.Subj:be careful-Imp ‘Be careful!’

b. langa’o-ng-imia’e! goodbye-already-2S.Obl ‘Goodbye to you.’

b’. olanga’o-nga’o-nga-lra-imia’e! goodbye-Red-already-1S.Nom-2S.Obl ‘Goodbye to you.’

To express thanks, one can say:

(4.61) a. icongo-nga-’o! hopefully-already-2S.Gen ‘Thank you!’

or b. icongo-nga-’-iae! hopefully-already-2S.Gen-1S.Obl ‘I thank you.’

4.15 INSULTS
Insults are either derived from verbs (e.g., ma-’olrongo ‘(be) stupid’ ~ ’olrongane! ‘stupid!’), or to body parts referring to genitals. If they function as nouns, they can be used vocatively and be marked for plurality through the prefixation of la- to the root.
4.15.1 Insults derived from verbs There seems to be only one word that functions as a noun.

184

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

(4.62) (la-)kalaici! bastard(s)!

Most other insults are derived from verbs and usually function as verbs. Some of these are nouns (functioning as predicates), and can further be marked as plural by the prefixation of la- to the base. Grammatical and ungrammatical derivations are indicated in Table 4.20 with examples illustrating the usage of these insults given afterwards.

Chapter 5
Word classes

In this chapter, major word classes of Mantauran are discussed, mostly 66 from a morphological perspective. The syntactic behavior of these different lexical categories is further examined in Chapter 8.
Nine word classes can be distinguished in Mantauran, which might further comprise subclasses: nouns, verbs, pronouns, numerals, phrasal, clausal and interclausal elements, exclamations and interjections. Nouns and verbs constitute the two open word classes of this dialect; pronouns, numerals, phrasal, clausal and interclausal elements, exclamations and interjections compose the closed word classes. Lexical categories such as “adjectives”, “prepositions”, “quantifiers” and “interrogative words” are not postulated because these concepts are expressed through morphemes or lexemes that belong to other well-defined classes. Two other classes cf. “auxiliary verbs” and “case markers” will be shown not to exist at all in this dialect.
The distinction between nouns and verbs, and their overlap in terms of categorial function is dealt with in section 5.1. Sections 5.2 - 5.8 show that Mantauran has no distinct classes of “adjectives”, “prepositions”, “auxiliary verbs”, “case markers”, “quantifiers”, “adverbs” and “interrogative words”. Section 5.9 briefly introduces pronouns. Section 5.10 deals with numerals and related derivations. Sections 5.11 - 5.13 provide an overview of phrasal/clausal elements (§5.11), interclausal (§ 5.12) elements, exclamations and interjections (§ 5.13).
5.1 Morphological distinction between nouns and verbs and functional overlap
Mantauran has just two open word classes, nouns and verbs, which undergo a large array of derivations. These will be introduced in Chapters 6 and 7 respectively.
5.1.1 Morpho-syntactic criteria that distinguish verbs from nouns

Formal distinctions between these two categories include: 1. the modification of nouns by demonstratives:

(5.1) a.

dhona’i that ‘that child’

lalake child

66 It is sometimes difficult to draw a boundary between morphology and syntax and whenever such a distinction would have rendered opaque the data analyzed, syntactic criteria have been included.

b. *dhona’i that

o-kane Dyn.Fin-eat

2. the modification of verbs by the irrealis prefix amo- ‘will’ and the two “aspectual” suffixes -nga ‘already’ and -na ‘still’. Bare nouns cannot occur with such affixes unless they are marked as stative verbs, through the prefixation of ma- or ka-:

(5.2) a.

amo-’ongolo

vavaa

‘Dhipolo will drink wine.’

3. the modification of verbs by toramoro ‘very’:

(5.4) a.

b. *toramoro very

but b.’ toramoro

ka ’a-ka-valrovalro

very

Lig ManNmz-Stat.NFin-young woman

‘a very good/beautiful girl’

4. the negativization of verbs by the prefix ki- (modal negation):

(5.5) a. *ki-tamatama Neg-middle-aged man

b. ki-kaava’i Neg-Dyn.NFin:come ‘did not/do not want come’

These formal morpho-syntactic distinctions are summarized in Table 5.1.

They do not represent “absolute” criteria, though, as nouns related to nature and most especially weather (a short list is given in § 7.1.1.3), e.g., dha’olo rain, dhedhere ‘thunder’ etc… can undergo verbal modification, as the following examples show. The noun in (5.6a) occurring as a predicate in (5.6b) is verbalized with the prefix o-, one the most common verbal prefix (cf. (5.6c)), while the verb in (5.7a) is nominalized through the circumfixation of kala-…ae (cf. (5.7b)) as other abstract nouns (5.7c).

The morphological resemblance between verbs and nouns has been recognized by many scholars (cf. Starosta et al. 1982, Ferrell 1982, Cauquelin 1991a-b, Ross 1995, among others) and has led to a questioning of the nominal nature of what apparently seem to be verbal sentences (Haudricourt 1979). The Rukai dialects – and Mantauran in particular – differ from the other Formosan languages in their verbal morphology, in that they primarily distinguish two voices, active vs. passive (see Chapter 7). As was shown above, in Mantauran, the distinction between a verb and its nominal counterpart is, to some extent, easy to establish. In cases where ambiguity arises, e.g., bare roots might be treated either as verbs or nouns, the categorial nature of a word must be determined through its syntactic distribution. Thus, the examples provided in (5.6) and (5.7) cannot refute the morphosyntactic criteria mentioned above. Rather, they illustrate the fact that the distinction between nouns and verbs remains, to some extent, morphologically opaque.

5.1.2 Ambiguous nominal/verbal instances

The same form (i) can be used with no derivational morphology as a noun or as a verb or (ii) might undergo the same derivational processes when occurring in either predicative or nominal slots.
In the following examples, lalake ‘child’ and velrete ‘pile up/wall’67 function as verbs in (a) but as nouns in (b). It is their position in the sentence that helps determine their syntactic function. As a verbal predicate, lalake appears in initial position in (5.8a); as a nominal argument, it follows the verb and is co-indexed on the verb (cf. ine ‘3S.Obl’) in (5.8b). As a verb, velrete appears in a serial verb construction just after the verb (o)poa ‘make’ in (5.9a); as a nominal argument, it is preceded by the particle ’i and modified by another NP, cf. dhona’i dha’ane (lit.) ‘that house’ in (5.9b).

‘When we still were in the old village, we (would) first (have to) dig (the foundations to

walls).’

67 I gloss velrete as “wall” to show that it is a noun. Actually, velrete represents a nominalized form (cf. § 6.3).

Another example can be given with colour terms, which can either function as ‘nouns’ or ‘verbs’ depending on the prefixes or circumfixes occurring on their root/stem.
To the bound root, cf. -dhiliange ‘red’, -ecelrenge ‘black’, -poli ‘white’, -vala’ava’a ‘yellow’, -’aleke’eke ‘blue/green’ can be attached the prefix ta- ‘inalienable’ to form a noun, as in tadhiliange ‘red’, taecelrenge ‘black’, tapoli ‘white’, tavala’ava’a ‘yellow’, ta’aleke’eke ‘blue/green’. Tests to show that the sequence ta-+colour term forms a noun include those given above: (i) the stem ta-+colour term can be preceded by a demonstrative, (ii) it cannot serve a predicate, (iii) it cannot be preceded by ki- but (iv) can be modified by a genitive pronoun as the head of a nominal complement.

The same root may undergo other derivational processes. It functions as a verb when prefixed by ma- ‘stative’ or to- ‘produce’, e.g., madhiliange ‘be red’, tovala’ava’a ‘produce (a) yellow (colour)’. A stative verb form might further be causativized, e.g., pakapoli ‘make …white’ or nominalized. Two nominalization patterns are found productively: subjective nominalization, e.g., takaecelrenge ‘who/which is black’ (which might be used as an equivalent to ta-+colour term, as shown in (5.10) above) and locative nominalization, e.g., takaecelrenge ‘black spot, dirt’. These derivational processes are summarized in table 5.2 and illustrated in the examples that follow.

5.2 Absence of adjectives

It has been long recognized that “not all languages have the major word class Adjective”, (cf. Dixon, 1972:20; cf. also Dixon 1982). Mantauran is one language that lacks a morphological class of adjectival-like morphemes. Adjectival concepts are, in fact, expressed through stative verbs. This section first briefly summarizes Ross’ (1998) study on adjectives in Oceanic languages as a review of the evidence that must be advanced if adjectives and verbs formed distinct categories.
5.2.1 Earlier studies

Ross (1998) examines the morpho-syntactic properties of “adjectives” across the Oceanic languages in order to reconstruct Proto-Oceanic adjectival categories. In so doing, he distinguishes four groups of languages:

2 01

Elizabeth Zeitoun

1. languages which possess a word class of “adjectives”, 2. languages which do not have a class of adjectives at all, 3. languages which possess adjective-like modifiers that actually represent a subclass of stative verbs and are labelled “adjectival verbs” 5. languages which exhibit adjective-like modifiers, which behave like nouns and are referred to as “adjectival nouns”. He shows that some languages (e.g., Takia) possess a class of adjectives. Ross (1998:90) defines adjectives as “a word class distinct from the classes “noun” and “verb” whose members (i) serve as modifier of a noun and (ii) may predicate a property of a noun in a construction that differs from a verbal or nominal predicate.” Ross shows that in Takia, the adjective uya ‘good’ takes an invariant suffix -n when it functions as modifier. As a predicate, it is followed by a possessor pronominal suffix which cross-references the person and number of the subject. Verbs, on the other hand, are not followed but rather preceded by a subject marker.

He contrasts Takia with two other languages, Kiribati and Woleaian. Kiribati is shown not to possess adjectives at all, i.e., it does not have a well-defined word class whose members serve as attributes. So-called “adjectives” are actually stative verbs. As such, they share the same morpho-syntactic properties of other (non-stative) verbs.

Woleaian, on the other hand, possesses a separate class of “adjectives” whose members serve as modifiers, but which function like other verbs in predicative constructions. Ross (1998:91) labels these adjective-like modifiers which form a subclass of verbs “adjectival verbs”, since they form “a subclass of stative verbs whose members (i) serve as modifier of a noun (i.e., need no relative-clause marking) and (ii) have the predicate syntax of a stative verb.” (Ross, 1998:91)

In Mangap-Mbula, so-called “adjectives” are usually derived from stative verbs, but they form a subclass of “nouns”. Ross (1998:94-97) labels these nominal-like modifiers “adjectival nouns” as they form “a subclass of nouns whose members (i) serve as modifier of a noun and (ii) have the predicate syntax of a noun.”

5.2.2 Morphosyntactic properties of stative verbs

As mentioned above, Mantauran lacks a morphological class of adjectival-like morphemes. Adjectival concepts are, in fact, expressed through stative verbs, which form a subclass of verbs as a whole. The distinction between stative verbs and other classes of verbs will be discussed in Chapter 6. Below, I examine the morphological properties (cf. § 5.2.2.1) and syntactic distribution (cf. § 5.2.2.2) they share in common.
5.2.2.1 Morphological properties of stative verbs

Stative verbs and more prototypical verbs, such as dynamic verbs, co-occur with the same types of verbal(izing) and nominalizing affixes.
Verbalizing affixes include: 1. -a ‘imperative’ – (both stative and dynamic) verbs are marked as subjunctive
(5.16) a. kon-a! Dyn.Subj:eat-Imp ‘Eat!’
b. ma-raveraver-a! Stat.Subj-happy-Imp ‘Be happy!’

They are at least two nominalizing affixes that can co-occur with dynamic and stative verbs: (i) a- ‘when’ (clausal nominalization), (ii) ta-…-ae ‘place where…’ (locative nominalization).

1. a- ‘when…’attaches to the verb to nominalize a clause:

Another prefix ka- ‘in fact, indeed, actually’ nominalizes the verb:

b. ka-ka-vahe’e-ni in fact-Stat.NFin-tired-3S.Gen ‘Dhipolo is actually tired.’

dhipolo. Dhipolo

Both stative and dynamic verbs exhibit the same reduplicative patterns, e.g.:

(5.29) a. ma-pa-pana ‘shoot at each other’ ~ ma-pa-pana-pana ‘shoot at one another’ b. ma’a-ka-dhalame ‘like/love each other’ ~ ma’a-ka-dhala-dhalame ‘like/love one another’

They undergo the same derivational processes (i.e., reduplication) in comparative and superlative constructions.

b. ma-taadhi’i-nga-lrao. Stat.Fin-good-Sup-1S.Nom ‘I am the best/most beautiful.’

5.2.2.2 Syntactic distribution of stative verbs

Predicatively, stative verbs, like dynamic verbs, might either be intransitive or transitive:

(5.32) a. ta’asa-lrao kone. just-1S.Nom Dyn.Subj:eat ‘I have just eaten.’

b. o-ravisili-lrao

‘Dhipolo is good/kind/beautiful.’

b. ma-salrai

dhipolo lalake-ni.

Stat.Fin-love deeply Dhipolo child-3S.Gen

‘Dhipolo loves her child deeply.’

As transitive verbs, stative verbs co-index the (in)direct object if it is a proper noun via the suffixation of an oblique pronoun, just like dynamic transitive verbs do:

(5.34) a. taotao ’a o-tipitip-ine

dhipolo.

Taotao Top Dyn.Fin-beat-3S.Obl Dhipolo

‘(As for) Taotao, (he) beats/beat Dhipolo.’

Elizabeth Zeitoun

b. taotao ’a ma-dhalam-ine Taotao Top Stat.Fin-like/love-3S.Obl ‘(As for) Taotao, (he) loves Dhipolo.’

They can be modified by toramoro ‘very’:

(5.35) a.

…’atoloro-nga-nai

ki-cengele-nga-nai

In their attributive function, stative verbs are nominalized like other dynamic verbs (for details, see section 6.3).

5.3 Absence of prepositions

Prepositional concepts in Mantauran are expressed through orientation/directional prefixes or nouns, which were introduced in Chapter 4 (cf. § 4.8). Mantauran also exhibits a few orientation/directional verbs, cf. ‘be at/exist’, ‘come from’, ‘reach’, ‘use’, ‘do for’), but there is no ground for setting up prepositions as a distinct word class.
A number of studies on Formosan languages deal in detail with the discussion on the presence or absence of prepositions in the Formosan languages (cf. Li 1973, Starosta 1988, Yeh 1991, Huang 1995, Tang 2002, Wu 2004). Li (1973), for instance, argues that Tanan (Rukai) exhibits prepositions, which have evolved from verbs. Wu (2004) concludes that Paiwan might only possess one preposition, cf. ka “which can undergo ‘pipe-piping’, as prepositions do, but cannot occur in pre-verbal position” (p. 150). Huang (1995), on the other hand, analyzes

210

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

morphemes that translate as ‘on’, ‘at’, ‘to’ and ‘with’ in English as case markers. I will not review each of these studies. Instead, I will briefly summarize Li’s (1973) study and show that the grammaticalization that has taken place in Tanan (Rukai) is not visible in Mantauran (Rukai).
5.3.1 From verbs to prepositions in Tanan (Rukai)

Li (1973:121ff) mentions the existence of four prepositions in Tanan (Rukai) – ’akai ‘at’, twalay ‘from’, ’akela ‘to’ and ara ‘with’ – presumably all historically derived from non-finite verbs. The following examples illustrate the distribution of prepositions (cf. examples in (a)) as compared to that of verbs (cf. examples in (b)).

Table 5.3 is based on Li’s (1973) data:

VERB y-a-kai arakai w-a-’akela pa-twalay

GLOSS ‘be at, exist’ ‘use’ ‘arrive’ ‘get from’

DERIVED PREPOSITION ’akai ara ’akela twalay

GLOSS ‘at’ ‘with’ ‘to’ ‘from’

Since prepositions and verbs occur in the same sentential position, Li (1973:145) provides four criteria to distinguish these two lexical categories:
(1) non-finite verbs can be followed by a determiner preceding the object; prepositions cannot:

(5.41) a.

Tanan [Adapted from Li, 1973:126, ex 13-15]

c. ki-a-’a’acay kay comay arakai sa kwang.

Pass-Real-kill this bear

with

gun

‘This bear was killed with a gun.’

(2) non-finite verbs can occur without their object69; prepositions cannot:

(5.42) Tanan

a. kadroa-ako

oa’ec ∅.

Neg-1S.Nom

sleep ∅

‘I did not sleep.’ [Adapted from Li, 1973:227]

b. *am-oa Dyn.Fin-go

’akai at

∅ koadra marodrang.

∅ that

old man

(3) non-finite verbs are inflected for person and tense etc. when shifted in initial position as main verbs; prepositions never undergo any morphological alternations in initial or medial position:

(5.43) Tanan

a. w-a-tobi

ikai

inia daan kay lrolay.

Act-Real-cry be at

that house this child

‘This child cried in that house.’ [Adapted from Li, 1973:120, ex.2]

b. i-a-kai inia daan tobi stayed that house cry ‘This child cried in that house.’

kay lrolay. this child

69 This is not always true, however, as the ungrammaticality of the following example demonstrates:

(i) Tanan

a. w-a-tobi

ikai daan

kay lrolay.

Act-Real-Dyn.NFin: be at house

‘This child cried in a house.’ [Adapted from Li, 1973: 120, ex. 1]

b. * w-a-tobi Act-Real-Dyn.NFin:cry

b. ’akela ino

kay daedae-so?

to

where this land-2S.Gen

‘How far is this land of yours?’

(4) non-finite verbs must always take the infix /o-/ in embedded position if the stem begins with a consonant followed by the low vowel /a/; prepositions never do:

(5.45) Tanan

b. * koani that

ababay swaswa’ ’a-o-kai ino?

woman sweep at

where

Last, but not least, Li (1973:121) also mentions that both a verb and its derived preposition may occur in sequence in the same sentence – the verb occurring before the preposition – though they cannot be used interchangeably:

214

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

‘Where is that woman sweeping?’

ino? where

Arguments (1) and (2) are somehow problematic. While in Tanan, Li (1973) argues that prepositions cannot be followed by a determiner, it has been demonstrated that in other Formosan languages (e.g., Paiwan, Amis), prepositions are distinguished from case markers [Li’s ‘determiners’] because they can co-occur simultaneously.

The non-occurrence of an object after a verb depends of the subcategorization of that verb, as the following pair of example shows. The verb yakai ‘be at’ is embbeded and thus appears as ikai. It must be followed by an object.

These two pieces of counter-evidence should not be taken as a rejection of Li’s (1973) analysis, though. The data provided in Table 5.3 and most of the arguments that follow show that prepositions have been grammaticalized in Tanan (Rukai).

5.3.2 English equivalents of ‘at’, ‘to’, ‘from’ and ‘for’ in Mantauran

In Mantauran, no convincing argument can be advanced to posit the existence of prepositions. As mentioned above, Mantauran exhibits orientation/directional prefixes, nouns and verbs. These verbs – and the prefixes that derived from these or are attached to them – are provided in Table 5.4.

The only counter-evidence one may raise against treating the Mantauran equivalents to English prepositions as verbs is the fact that omiki can also occur in its bare form (that is iki), as the following examples illustrate:

(5.65) a.

mani ’aela

Elizabeth Zeitoun

I have glossed and am still glossing iki as subjunctive, as the same bare form occurs in places where a subjunctive form is expected, i.e., in conditional and imperative sentences. Thus, we can get the following variants, which I am still quite unable to account for:

(5.66) a. lo m-iki-ni

‘If [a middle-aged man] went head-hunting…’

look:Imp Dyn.Subj-be at-Imp-still

‘Look! Stay here!’

5.4 Absence of auxiliary verbs

Synchronically, only few Formosan languages (to my knowledge, Tsou, Atayal and Seediq) have auxiliary verbs. Mantauran has none. It has been shown in Chapter 4 (cf. § 4.4.1) opoa, is undergoing grammaticalization and is developing into an auxiliary verb. However, it can only be treated at this stage as a supporting verb, as (i) it can occur both as the first verb of the clause and in an embedded position (in a series of two or three verbs), (ii) it does not carry over modal or aspectual distinctions as is rather common in the languages that exhibit auxiliary verbs.
Auxiliary verbs can be defined as a closed subset of verbs, that can be immediately followed by pronouns (or other grammatical preverbs, as in Tsou), and thus constitute the head of the clause, and which carry over distinctions in modality, aspectuality and/or focus.

(5.68) a.

Tsou m-i-ta AF-Real.Imm-3S.Nom ‘He is drinking water.’

m-imo ta chumu. AF-drink Obl water

ras-un

Auxiliary verbs in Tsou, Atayal and Seediq do not exhibit the same morphosyntactic properties, but this does not concern us here.
In Mantauran, the head of the clause is usually a full lexical verb, as the following examples show:

(5.69) a. o-dhaace

o’i

a’ivivai

Dyn.Fin-leave that

Dyn.Fin-buy-Neg-Impers.Nom Neg Red:side dish

‘We did not buy (any) vegetables (there).’

5.5 Absence of case markers

Nearly all Formosan languages possess a system of case markers (see among others Huang et al. 1998). They typically occur before the noun (or the noun phrase) and fulfill two functions, the first, syntactic and the second, semantic. Syntactically speaking, they indicate the syntactic role of the noun (or noun phrase) they precede; semantically speaking, they encode distinctions between:
- personal vs. non-personal/common nouns - singular vs. plural nouns - referential vs. non-referential nouns - visible/near vs. non-visible/far-away participants The first of these distinctions is certainly the most common among the Formosan languages, with the exception of Tsou. Thus, while case markers referring to personal nouns are generally suffixed with -i, the vowels -o~-u or -a appear on case markers referring to common nouns (Blust 1977, Y. Chang et al. 1998):

223

~ Ía/kana ‘Obl’

c. Paiwan

a ‘Nom’

~ t(u)a ‘Obl’ ~

no ‘Gen’ n(u)a ‘Gen’

The other three distinctions are less prototypical: plurality is marked on case markers through the suffixation of -a in Amis, Puyuma and Paiwan; notions of referentiality, identifiability, visibility and distance are best developed in Tsou (see Zeitoun 1992, 1993 and 2005).

(5.72) Marking of plurality (on case markers referring to human participants)

na ‘Nom’

~ kana ‘Obl’

c. Paiwan

tia ‘Nom’

~ taia

‘Obl’ ~ nia ‘Gen’

Mantauran has a very restricted case marking system (see chapter 6), and no case marker per se. There is a particle ’i, which historically might be related to the Tona and Maga (Rukai) morpheme ki. In these two dialects, ki still functions as a nominative case marker. In Mantauran, however, ’i no longer serves to indicate a case relation. Besides, while Mantauran case marking system distinguishes between “common” and “personal” nouns, ’i can occur before nearly any type of nouns.

5.7 Adverbs as verbal prefixes and verbs

In a recent study, Chang (2005) shows that so-called “adverbs” in Kavalan actually function as matrix verbs (or lexical heads) and that adverbial modification involves complementation. In Mantauran, there is no evidence to posit a distinct class of “adverbs” either.
Adverbs can either modify a verb, a verb phrase or a clause. Verb-modifying adverbs are rendered by affixes in Mantauran:

Two verbal prefixes, cf. ’ako- ‘speak’ and to- ‘make’ do not refer by themselves to any adverbial expression. However, in co-occurrence with stative verb roots, cf. -dhao ‘many, a lot’and -sasi’i ‘very few, very little’, they form a derived verb (with an adverbial meaning) that can modify another verb:

Manner expressions including ‘carefully’, ‘slowly’, ‘quickly’, ‘just’, ‘early’, ‘straight away’, ‘first’, ‘intentionally’, ‘violently’, ‘wrongly’, ‘attentively’, ‘especially’, ‘suddenly’ function as verbs in Mantauran.

5.8 Interrogative words as derived nominals

Interrogative words are discussed in detail in Chapter 8 (cf. § 8.6). Most of them, cf. ‘who’, ‘whom’, ‘whose’, ‘what’, ‘where’, ‘when’ constitute derived nominals. The status of kani ‘why’ is difficult to determine, and I have not been able to decide whether it is a verb or a derived nominal because of lack of morphological evidence (e.g., no occurrence of a genitive pronoun on the interrogative word, no nominalization device etc.).

5.9 Pronouns

Pronouns will be discussed in detail in Chapter 6 (cf. § 6.2). There are three sets of pronouns: personal pronouns, impersonal pronouns and demonstrative pronouns.
Personal pronouns are constituted of four sets: one set, the “topic” set, refers to pre-verbal free pronouns:

234

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

(5.91)

iname ’a ma-raveravere-nga-nai. 1PE.Top Top Stat.Fin-happy-already-1PE.Nom ‘As for us, we were very happy.’

The three others sets, “nominative”, “oblique” and “genitive” all constitute bound forms that appear post-verbally (the only exceptions are the first person singular and plural nominative pronouns, cf. nao- ‘1S.Nom’, ta- ‘1PI. Nom’ and nai- ‘1PE.Nom’).

(5.92) a. o-kane-nga-lrao. Dyn.Fin-eat-already-1S.Nom ‘I have eaten already.’

b. o-tipitip-iae. Dyn.Fin-beat-1S.Obl ‘S/he beat(s) me.’

c. pa-kane-nga-lrao

lalake-li.

Caus-Dyn.NFin:eat-already-1S.Nom child-1S.Gen

‘I have fed my child already.’

Mantauran is rather unique among the Formosan languages in that it exhibits, as in Tona Rukai, a series of impersonal pronouns. Impersonal pronouns do not have a topic form – a grammatical function that clashes with their inherent generic/non-referential meaning – but exhibit a nominative, genitive and oblique declinaison cf. -mao ‘Nom/Gen’ and -imae ‘Obl’.

’i

if Dyn.Subj:come-3S.Gen-Impers.Obl

‘If one’s boyfriend came to one’s home…’

asavasavare-mao… boyfriend-Impers.Gen

Demonstrative pronouns (as opposed to “adnominal” demonstratives, following Diessel’s (1999) terminology) carry over different functions. They include: ’ina~’ina’i ‘this’, ana~ana’i ‘that [+vis, -far]’, ona~ona’i ‘that [±vis, ±far]’, dhona~dhona’i ‘that [-vis, +far]. They are free

235

Elizabeth Zeitoun

forms that are used to refer to third person participants, occurring either in topic position or in subject position. Demonstrative pronouns can, in that case, be marked for plurality by the suffixation of -lo to the base, e.g., dhona ‘that, they’ ~ dhona-lo ‘these, they’.

(5.94) a. ana(-lo) ’a o-omale-na. that(-plur) Top Dyn.Fin-sing-still ‘As for him/her/them, he/she/they is/are still singing.’

b. o-omale-na

ana(-lo).

Dyn.Fin-sing-still that(-plur)

‘He/she/they are still singing.’

Demonstrative pronouns can also refer to a temporal or spatial location, in which case the occurrence of the plural suffix -lo is ungrammatical.

5.10 Numerals and their derivations

5.10.1 Numerals

Numerals form a closed word class in Mantauran,71 which exhibits a decimal system.72 Numerals used in serial counting from 1 to 10 are mostly inherited from PAN (Blust 2003). Phonological changes and innovations account for the forms neka ‘one’, nosa ‘two’73 and vangate ‘nine’ (< PR *bangate). The word for ‘ten’, cf. polroko (< PAN *sa-puluq) is a false

71 For a study on the typology of numerals in Formosan languages, see Li (2005). 72 There is no word for zero. The only substitute is the existential verb (o-)kaodho~ikaodho~akaodho ‘not
exist’ 73 As mentioned in Blust (1995:452) “there is assimilation of the voiced interdental fricative dho’a to the
alveolar nasal of ‘one’.” Compare Mantauran Rukai neka ‘1’, nosa ‘2’ with Tona Rukai nega ‘1’, dosa ‘2’.

236

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

cognate and should be treated as a loan word because it is phonologically irregular: PAN q has been lost in PR so the expected form should have been *pulru.

Blust (2003:205) suggests that PAN “had two morphologically related sets of numerals, an unaffixed set used in serial counting and in the enumeration of non-human referents, and a second set derived from the first by Ca- reduplication and used in counting human referents” as in Thao or Amis.

There is, indeed, another set of suffixed numeral forms with numbers from 1 to 9 in Mantauran, which differs slightly from the first that is used for serial counting.

three Stat.Fin-three person

ta-iki

ana.

SubjNmz-Dyn.NFin:be at that

‘One, two, three, there are three persons over there.’

However, the set of suffixed numerals is not exploited to only count human referents. The following examples show that there is actually no distinction in Mantauran between [-human] and [+human] counting.

(5.100) a. ma-eaea

ta’olro ta-iki

dhona.

Stat.Fin-one person SubjNmz-Dyn.NFin:be at that

‘There is one person over there.’74

Rather, bound numeral forms attach to different verbal prefixes and numeral classifiers to form cardinals (1 to 9), ordinals (the first, the second…), complex numbers (10 to 90, 100 to 900 and above), and to refer to different classes of objects (see section 5.10.2).75
Suffixed numeral forms exhibit a few phonological and morphological variations (cf. the alternation between -(ea)ea ~ a- ~ -nge(a) and -dho’a ~ -po’a; the deletion of the first syllable for ‘six’) that require further explanations:

74 For an approximative figure, e.g., ‘five or six’, the two numerals appear in adposition, for instance:

(i) ma-lrima,

ma-eneme ocao

ta-iki

dhona.

Stat.Fin-five Stat.Fin-six person SubjNmz-Dyn.NFin:be at that

‘There five or six persons over there.’

75 Among these numeral classifiers, a few sets are used to refer only to humans, cf. (o-)ta’a‘with’, ’ano-Ca- ‘along, with (< 4 persons)’, (o-)taro- and tao- ‘along, with (> 4 persons)’

238

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

The distinction between -(ea)ea, a- and -nge(a) is as follows: -ea is always reduplicated when it follows the verbal prefixes ma- (ka-) ‘stative’ (in sentence-initial position) and to- ‘make, produce, build’, cf. ma-eaea ‘one’ (and not *ma-ea) and to-eaea ‘(make/produce/give birth to) one’ (and not *to-ea). It occurs unreduplicated as -ea after other prefixes (either ordinals or numeral classifiers), e.g., ’aka-ea ‘the first’, (o-)tar-ea caili ‘one year old’. -a is an allomorph of -ea that co-occurs with circumfixes (ordinals or numeral classifiers), e.g., ’apaka-a-le ‘the first day’, maatali-a-le ‘one floor’, o-ka’a-a-le ‘one bowl’. -ea can also undergo triplication, e.g., to-ea-ea-ea but in that case it refers to a repetitive action ‘make one (after the other)’. -nge is used for ten as in ma-nge-le ‘ten’ (lit., one ten). As for -ngea, it implies the notion of ‘loneliness’; it attaches to the prefixes ta’a- ‘with’, taka- ‘with’, ’ano- ‘with’ yielding ta’angea~takangea~’anongangea ‘alone’, and ma’ohi- ‘split’, apa’ohi- ‘make/let…split’, cf. ma’ohingea ‘(split in) one’, apa’ohingea ‘make/let (split in) one’.
The distinction between -dho’a and -po’a ‘two’ lies in the type of affixes they take: -dho’a is only preceded by prefixes, while -po’a co-occurs with circumfixes, for instance:

(5.101) a. o-tara-dho’a b. o-ka’a-po’a-le

‘two (months/years)’ ‘(drink/eat) two bowls’

*o-tara-po’a *o-ka’a-dho’a-le

The suffixed form for ‘ten’ is -ma-nge-le, composed of the circumfix ma-…-le/-lo used for ‘tens’. Note that (i) in co-occurrence with ma-ma-…-le, eneme is reduced to neme and that (ii) the suffixal form for ‘nine’ is never suffixed with -le, though it takes the same prefixes as the other numerals with the same meanings. Tens are preceded by the stative prefix ma- (which alternates with the non-finite form ka-), unless used with numeral classifiers or ordinals.

The word for ‘hundred’ is idhai (< PR *idai, cf. Li, 1977:56). It combines with the suffixal numeral forms from one to nine preceded by the stative prefix ma- to form higher numbers, from 100 to 900.

The word for ‘thousand’ is kodholo (< PR *kodrolo, cf. Li, 1977:76).

5.10.2 Verbal prefixes, ordinal affixes and numeral classifiers

As mentioned above, bound numeral forms (whether they refer to simple or complex numerals) attach to different verbal prefixes, ordinal affixes and numeral classifiers.

5.10.2.1 Verbal prefixes There are a number of verbal prefixes that can co-occur with numerals: the stative prefix
ma-(~ ka-), the prefix to- ‘make’, the two causative prefixes pa- ‘let…have’ (generic causative) and po- ‘make, put, bring’ (movement causative), maaraka- (~ paaraka-) ‘each’, makini-…-(a)e (~ pakini-…-(a)e) ‘all’, the reciprocal prefixes ma’a- ‘…for each’ (non causative) and apa’a‘make/let…for each’ (causative) and the two prefixes ma’ohi- ‘split’ ~ apa’ohi ‘make/let…split’. ma- (~ ka-) is the most productive prefix in terms of distribution (it can replace different numeral classifiers) and frequency (cf. section 5.3.8.2.3).

The two causative prefixes, pa- ‘(generic) causative’ and po- ‘mouvement causative’ can co-occur with a suffixed numeral form. pa- must be followed by the stative prefix ka-; po- never is. It attaches directly to a numeral. The sequence pa-ka-Num can be glossed as ‘make…(give) N’; po-Num can translated as ‘make, put, bring N’.

5.10.2.2 Ordinal affixes In my opinion, there is one ordinal prefix ’a- ‘the Nth’, that further combines with different
verbal affixes or numeral classifiers (cf. ’aka- ‘the Nth’, ’ao- ‘the Nth time’, ’apaka-…-le ‘the Nth
day/month/year’). The ordinal ’aka- ‘the Nth’ is a bi-morphemic prefix, composed of ’a- ‘ordinal’ + ka-

5.10.2.3 Numeral classifiers Some of these numeral classifiers are circumfixes of the form X-…-le/-lo (where X =
classifier). When attaching to complex numerals (formed by ma-…-le), the form X-ma-…-le/-lo-le/-lo is reduced to X-ma-…-le/-lo through haplology (cf. § 2.4.5), i.e., the two -le/-lo fuse together. Thus, while maatali-ma-valro-lo ‘eighty-storeyed (house)’ is correct, *maatali-ma-valro-lo-lo is ungrammatical. Numeral classifiers can function as predicates, and thus usually exhibit the same verbal alternation as other verbs (cf. o- ~ ∅- and m-~p- for dynamic verbs and ma-~ka- for stative verbs).
I have found five types of numeral classifiers referring to (i) humans, (ii) time and frequency, (iii) measure, (iv) the number of (referents) taken or caught, (v) the number of (referents) contained in a recipient (e.g., a glass or a bowl), (vi) the number of floors. Whenever the verbal prefix ma(~ka-) can replace any of these numeral classifiers, an example is provided. The occurrence of ma(~ka-) usually yields a meaning less precise than that of a specific numeral classifier.

5.10.2.3.1 Numeral classifiers for ‘persons’ There are at least three numeral classifiers for persons: ta’a-, ’ano- + Ca-, taro-/tao- and
(maa-…)-e. ta’a- refers to a group of persons (above 2); ’ano-Ca- and taro-/tao- both refer to a number
of persons (or animate referents) in movement. They occur somehow in complementary distribution: ’ano-Ca- with numeral suffixes below four and taro-/tao- with numeral suffixes

249

Elizabeth Zeitoun

above four 76 . Thus, ’ano-ta-tolro ‘the three of them’ is correct, *taro-tolro/*tao-tolro is ungrammatical; conversely, while taro-lrima/tao-lrima is accurate, ’ano-lra-lrima is inexact. The two prefixes taro/tao- must occur with movement verbs (e.g., o-dhaace ‘leave’, maava’i ‘come’), while there is no such constraint on the occurrence of ’ano-Ca-.

A few nominal and verbal stems referring mostly to quantification can be used in co-occurrence with the numeral classifiers referring to humans. These can attach to bound nominal roots, e.g., -elre ‘companion’, as in ’ano-a-elre ~ (o-)ta’a-elre ‘with’, -palra ‘spouse’, as in ’ano-pa-palra ‘along with’ and bound stative verb roots, e.g., -maidhai78 ‘many (persons)’ as in ta’a-maidhai ~ taro-maidhai79 ‘with many (persons)’, -dhao ‘many’ as in to-dhao ‘make

78 < from idhai ‘hundred’. -maidhai ‘many’ involves a higher number (of participants) than -dhao ‘many’. 79 But not *taro-maidha-ae.

The circumfix maa-…-e 80 (~ paa-…-e) is used exclusively with -dho’a ‘two’, cf. maa-dho’a-e to refer to two persons working or owning a field in common. Only three and four can be used in this construction, by adding the suffix to the base -e.

5.10.2.3.2 Numeral classifiers for time and frequency There are at least four numeral classifiers for time and frequency: o-tara- ~ tara-, o-taka- ~
taka-, pa-, maka-…-le/-lo ~ paka-…-le/-lo, ’o-…-le/-lo, ’ako-…-le/-lo. o-tara- (~ tara-) refers to a number of months or years. It can thus be used to refer to the age
of a person, to the school grade of a student or to any other time length (e.g., work).

80 < maa- ‘dual reciprocal’ prefix for dynamic verbs. 253

There are two ways to express age: in the first, o-tara-(ma-)N(-le/-lo) functions as a predicate as in the above examples; in the second, it is preceded by (om-oa) mokela ‘(go and) reach’. This is further illustrated in the example that follows:

5.11 Phrasal and clausal elements

Phrasal and clausal elements will be further discussed in Chapters 5-8 in relation to the morpho-syntactic study of noun phrases, verb phrases and clauses. They include:
(1) adnominal demonstratives, which are quasi-identical in form to demonstrative pronouns.

263

Elizabeth Zeitoun

(5.160) Demonstrative pronouns/adnominal demonstratives

a. ’ina~’ina’i

‘this [+vis, -far from the speaker]’

b. ana~ana’i

‘that [+vis, + far from the speaker, -far from the hearer]’

c. ona~ona’i

‘that [±vis, ±far from the speaker and the hearer]’

d. dhona~dhona’i

‘that [-vis, + far from the speaker and the hearer]’

Demonstrative adjectives

e. o’i (but not *o)

‘that [±vis, ±far from the speaker and the hearer]’

f. dho’i (but not *dho)

‘that [-vis, + far from the speaker and the hearer]’

g. dhodho’i (but not *dhodho) ‘that [-vis, + far from the speaker and the hearer]’

Adnominal demonstratives precede noun phrases, while demonstrative pronouns replace them. There are at least two major differences between adnominal demonstratives and demonstrative pronouns:
1) Not all adnominal demonstratives can function as demonstrative pronouns:

(5.161) a. o-lralrame-nga

ana ocao.

Dyn.Fin-run-already that person

‘That person has already run.’

a’. o-lralrame-nga

ana.

Dyn.Fin-run-already that

‘S/he has already run.’

b. o-lralrame-nga

o’i ocao.

Dyn.Fin-run-already that person

‘That person has already run.’

b’. *o-lralrame-nga o’i. Dyn.Fin-run-already that ‘S/he has already run.’

2) Adnominal demonstratives cannot be marked as plural, though younger informants now accept this type of construction for adnominal demonstratives that also function as demonstrative pronouns.85

85 The occurrence of -lo on o’i, dho’i and dhodho’i is unheard of, cf. *o’i-lo, *dho’i-lo, *dhodho’i-lo.

(2) modal and aspectual affixes (examples were given in section 3.2.1.2):

(5.163)

amo- ‘will’ (irrealis – occurs on the verb) -a/-i ‘will’ (irrealis – occurs on a derived nominal) ni- ‘would’ (counterfactual) ni-…-a ‘even if’ (concessive) -na ‘still’ -nga ‘already’

5.12 Interclausal elements

Interclausal elements are treated here as conjunctions. They will be further discussed in Chapters 9 when dealing with complex sentences. They include:

i’a

‘besides’87

b. Subordinating conjunctions

lo, olo, alo

‘if’

86 When followed by a genitive pronoun, la ‘and’ has a slightly different meaning and can be glossed by ‘so
that’ or ‘if’. 87 It seems that this conjunction is now rarely used.

Chapter 6 Nominal morphology

Nouns/nominals include the forms which function as the head of a nominal phrase or as the argument of a predicate/verb. The syntactic structure of noun (phrases) is described in chapter 8 (§ 8.2). In this chapter, I deal with nominal morphology.
Nominals can be subcategorized into two major subclasses, nouns and pronouns, which are discussed in turn in sections 6.1 and 6.2. In section 6.3, different nominalization processes are introduced.

6.1 Nouns
Nouns can be divided into three major categories – common nouns (§ 6.1.1), locative/temporal nouns (§ 6.1.2) and non-common nouns (§ 6.1.3) – which further divide into ubcategories, based on the different derivational processes88. These derivational processes include the marking of: (i) plurality (§ 6.1.4), (ii) quantification (‘each’ vs. ‘all’) (§ 6.1.5) and, (iii) (dual/plural) reciprocity (§ 6.1.6).89 A brief summary is given in section 6.1.7.
6.1.1 Common nouns

Common nouns include all nouns referring to human and non-human referents (e.g., ’aolai ‘male, man’, ta’olro ‘dog’, apoto ‘stone’), with the exception of given names, households’ names, insults if these function as nominals, kinship terms, locative and temporal nouns.
A short list of common nouns is given below, relating to different semantic categories:

(6.1) Humans a. katalrisie b. valra c. valravalrae d. tokapi

‘aborigine’ ‘enemy’ ‘guest’ ‘twin’

88 Both morphological and syntactic criteria help determine noun classes in Mantauran, even if they are discussed separately in this grammar. For instance, while personal names are never marked for plural, they must be cross-referenced on the verb if they function as oblique arguments. 89 Li (1973: 107) argues that in Tanan Rukai, “the features “dual”, “plural” and “collective” have little or no syntactic consequence aside from the semantic content.” This claim does not stand any longer, with regard to the linguistic facts presented in this chapter, most of which also hold for the other Rukai dialects.

There is no overt distinction in gender. There is, on the other hand, a distinction between human and non-human referents in terms of the marking of plurality and case (see § 6.1.4 and 7.2.1 for detail).
Common nouns may be underived, e.g., ove’eke ‘pig’ or derived through various processes, the most common of which is nominalization, cf. tave’ekae ‘pigpen’, further discussed in section 6.3.

6.1.2 Locative and temporal nouns

Locative nouns include orientation and directional nouns as in (6.8) (cf. also Table 4.6), place names as in (6.9) (cf. also Tables 4.17-4.18) and derived common nouns being used to refer to a location ‘a place full of’ as in (6.10).

6.1.3 Non-common nouns

Noun-common nouns include vocative and non-vocative kin terms as in (6.12) – a detailed account of the use of non-vocative kin terms was given in Chap 4 (cf. § 4.10) – personal names, as in (6.13) (cf. Tables 4.14 and 4.15), households’ names as in (6.14) (cf. Table 4.16). Insults that function as nominals as in (6.15) also behave as non-common nouns (cf. Table 4.19).

6.1.4 Marking of plurality

Plurality in Mantauran is triggered by morphological, syntactic and semantic factors. Plural formation is expressed through morphological means (affixation or reduplication). Syntactically, plural formation is both subject-sensitive and object-sensitive, i.e., it is triggered by the quantification of a subject and yielded by the occurrence of a non-volitional/human/oblique participant. Semantically, the notion of plurality is closely associated to that of “humanness”, i.e., only nouns referring to humans are overtly marked as plural. Rules for the marking of plurality are given below.

6.1.4.1 Rules for plural marking Common nouns can be divided in at least the two following types: common nouns referring to
non-human participants92 and common nouns referring to human participants. Common nouns referring to non-human participants are never marked for plural, i.e., they are
always grammatical singular no matter the number of referents involved. Compare:

(6.18) a. om-iki

latadhe ta-ka-eaea

Dyn.NFin-exist outside SubjNmz-Stat.NFin-one

‘There is one dog outside.’

ta’olro. dog

b. om-iki

latadhe ta-ka-dhao

ta’olro.

Dyn.NFin-exist outside SubjNmz-Stat.NFin-many dog

‘They are many dogs outside.’

They might, however, be circumfixed with kapa-...-nga ‘all’ to express a notion of “quantification/collectivity”, e.g., kapa-ta’olro-nga ‘all the dogs’, kapa-dha’ane-nga ‘all the houses’ (see section 6.1.4 for details).

92 Common nouns referring to non-human referents can further be divided according to whether they are countable/non-countable or refer to a single entity.

(6.18) c. om-iki

latadhe kapa-ta’olro-nga.

Dyn.NFin:exist outside all-dog-Sup

‘All the dogs are outside.’

Many (underived or derived) common nouns referring to a human participant can appear in a plural form. They include nouns referring to a human entity (e.g., lroolai ‘child’, ’avai ‘woman’, ’aolai ‘man’ etc…) and abstract or derived nouns obtained through nominalization, e.g., takarodhange ‘(who is) old (cf. section 6.1.4.2).

Underived locative and temporal nouns are never marked for plurality nor can they be quantified through kapa-…-nga, cf. *kapa-’idha-nga, *kapa-menanae-nga. Derived locative and temporal nouns may undergo reduplication to express a notion of collectivity or quantification, cf. tai ‘taro’ ~ taitaie ‘a place full of taros’, menanae ‘(one) day’ ~ menamenamenanae ‘every day’:

(6.21) a. * kapa-’idha-nga b. * kapa-’idhanae-nga c. *?kapa-menanae-nga d. kapa-kalakecelrae-nga e. kapa-kalalrapa’ae-nga f. kapa-kalapahalrae-nga

In the following subsections, I focus specifically on plural marking on human common nouns and non-common nouns through the suffixation of a-/la- to the base. A summary is given in section 6.1.4.6.

6.1.4.2 Common nouns referring to a human participant Plural nouns referring to human participants are usually derived through the prefixation of a-
to the base. Nouns referring to human participants might represent basic/underived forms, as in (6.21) or
more abstract entities derived through nominalization as in (6.22). Among basic/underived nouns, a distinction might be made between base forms that undergo
overt reduplication and those which do not. The prefixation of the plural marker a- usually yields the reduplication of the root, cf. savare ‘young man’ ~ a-sava-savare ‘young men’. If the plural marker attaches to a lexicalized reduplicated root as in valrovalro ‘young woman’ ~ a-valrovalro ‘young women, the base form does not undergo further reduplication.

(6.24) a. ’avai b. ’aolai c. lroolai

‘female, girl, woman’ ~ ‘male, boy, man’ ~ ‘baby, child (gen.) ~

a-’ivivai a-’olalai a-olrolai

‘chieves’ ‘middle-aged women’ ‘middle-aged men’ ‘old men’ ‘young men’ ‘young women’ ‘older (cousins, relatives)’ ‘commoners’ ‘guests, outsiders ‘children (own)’

There are at least one type of derived/abstract common nouns obtained through nominalization – cf. subjective nominals – that can occur in the plural form, through the prefixation of a- to the base. Note that the position of the plural marker is slightly different in nominals derived from dynamic verbs and and those derived from stative verbs: the plural prefix occurs just after the nominalizer ta- in nominals derived from dynamic verbs, but follows the stative prefix ka- in nominals derived from stative verbs.

(6.25) Dynamic verbs

a. ta-ki-kane ‘who does not eat’ ~ ta-a-ki-kane

‘who do not eat’

b. ta-’acakelae ‘who is married’ ~ ta-a-’acakelae

‘who are married’

Stative verbs

c. ta-ka-rodhange ‘who is old’

~ ta-ka-a-rodhange ‘who are old’

d. ta-ka-lrihili ‘who is clever’

~ ta-ka-a-lrihili

‘who are clever’

A number of (underived/derived) common nouns referring to human nouns cannot be marked for plural, and thus are grammatically singular whatever the number of referents involved.93 They cannot undergo reduplication either

(6.26) a. b. c. d. e. f.

katalrisie valra tokapi ’alriasao cara’e ta-ka-ca’eme

93 The non-occurrence of the plural prefix a- on these forms is ill-understood at this stage.

6.1.4.3 Vocative and non-vocative kin terms Plural reference/non-vocative and address/vocative kin terms are derived through the
prefixation of l(a)-.

While iinae ‘my mother’ can be used as a near synonym of ina-li ‘my mother’ (cf. § 4.9.1), there is no plural counterpart to iinae (and the like) such as *l-iinae.

(6.29) a. b. c. d.

Singular ina-li~iinae ‘my mother’ ~ ama-li~ammae ‘my father’ ~ omo-li~oomoe ‘my grandparent’ ~ taka-li~taakae ‘my elder sibling!’ ~

94 Cf. lina ‘parents’ (no singular counterpart).

6.1.4.4 Nouns referring to a person or a household Given names never appear in the plural form, though a group of person bearing the same
name might be referred to with the prefix tali- ‘belong to’ adjoined to the given name, e.g., tali-dhipolo ‘group of persons which are called dhipolo’.
Households’ names (cf. Table 4.16), on the other, hand, are marked as plural through the prefixation of la- to the base. The plural form must be used when the name refers to the whole family/household. A non-plural form occurs when a single referent of that family/household is introduced.

6.1.4.5 Insults As mentioned in Chapter 4 (cf. § 4.15), insults are either derived from verbs (e.g.,
ma-’olrongo ‘(be) stupid’ ~ ’olrongane! ‘stupid!’), or to body parts referring to genitals (e.g., elrele ‘penis’ ~ elrele-’o ‘you’re bloody foolish!’).
Insults derived from verbs may be verbs or nouns. If they are nouns, they can be used vocatively and be marked for plurality through the prefixation of la- to the root, just like insults derived from body parts.

b. la-’olro-’olrongo! plur-Red-stupid ‘Stupid!’

b. la-ngapolo! plur-foreskin/prepuce ‘Blockhead!’

6.1.4.6 Summary Mantauran exhibits two distinct prefixes to mark plurality: a- and la-. The prefix a- usually attaches to (underived or derived) common nouns referring to a human
participant. Underived common nouns usually simultaneously undergo reduplication, unless the root is a lexicalized reduplicated root.
The prefix la- attaches to non-common nouns, (vocative and non-vocative) kin terms, households’ names, and if they functions as nouns, insults. Nouns referring to a person are never marked for plurality.
The morphological marking of plurality on nouns is summarized in a tabular form as follows:

Quantification is indicated through the circumfixation to the root/stem of kapa-…-nga.

Reciprocity in Mantauran is expressed by different prefixes, cf. ma-Ca- (where Ca represents the reduplication of the first consonant of the base followed by the vowel a), ma(a)- and ma’a- that attach to dynamic verb roots (cf. ma-Ca- and ma(a)-) or stative stems (cf. ma’a-) (cf. Chapter 7, section 7.2.9 for an account for the distribution and usage of reciprocal prefixes on verbs).
The prefix ma’a- can also attach to kinship terms to express “converse” relationship, in Lichtenberk’s (2000) terms. The relation can be “symmetrical” or “asymmetrical”. It is symmetrical when it involves two participants in an equal (inter)relationship, e.g. -palange ‘spouse’ > (la-) ma’a-palange ‘husband and wife’. It is an asymmetrical relation when it involves two participants in an unequal (inter)relationship, i.e., the base specifically refers to only one of them. In Mantauran, the base always corresponds to an elder, e.g., tama ‘father’ > (la)ma’a-tama ‘father and child’.
The prefixation of ma’a- (and its derived forms) in different scenarios: (i) the sequence ma’a-+bound kin root forms a predicate, e.g., ma’a-tina ‘(be in a) mother-daughter (relationship)’. This construction is dealt with in section 7.2.9.3. (ii) the prefix ma’a- alternates with pa’a-, but under the following two circumstances: (i) the predicate appears in a non-finite form, e.g., amo-pa’a-tina ‘will (be in a) mother-daughter
95 The grammaticality of kama-keme’e-nga is controversial among informants, since some of them treat it as a non-countable entity. 96 This form is acceptable if it refers to ‘month’ and can be glossed as: ‘all the months’ (cf. above). 97 This form is acceptable if it refers to the ‘Mantauran people’ and can be glossed as: ‘all the Mantauran’

(relationship), (ii) the sequence pa’a-+bound kin root functions as a noun, e.g., pa’a-tina-lidha ‘mother and daughter’.
(iii) the prefix ma’a- is preceded by the plural prefix la- yielding la-ma’a-+bound kin root and the resulting sequence functions as a noun.
In this section, I will focus on reciprocals functioning as nouns/nominal arguments, that is, on the following two constructions: pa’a-+kinship*(-ProGEN) and la-ma’a-+kinship-(*ProGEN). As mentioned in section 4.9, only specific kin roots can be used as a base in nominal-based reciprocal constructions. They include:

(6.38) Bound kin roots Base
a. -tina b. -tama c. -tomo d. -taka e. -ivoko f. -lili g. -palange h. -palra

Gloss ‘mother’ ‘father’ ‘grandparent (grandfather/grandmother)’ ‘elder sibling’ ‘(male) friend’ ‘(female) friend’98 ‘spouse’ ‘spouse’

As shown below, if the root is unreduplicated, then it refers to two persons at most (‘dual’ reciprocal). If the root is reduplicated, it refers to at least three persons (‘pluractional’99 reciprocal).

98 -ali also occurs in folktales, as in lama’a-ali ‘(two) friends’ pa’a-ali-lidha ‘(two) friends’ but it is usually
disregarded as a loan from Tona, cf. Chapter 4. 99 Cf. section 7.2.7 for a distinction between ‘plural’ and ‘pluractional’.

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)
6.2 Pronouns This section is dedicated to a morphological description of three pronominal sets in
Mantauran: (i) personal pronouns, (ii) impersonal pronouns and (iii) demonstrative pronouns. A detailed syntactic account of these three categories is given in section 8.2. 6.2.1 Personal pronouns
In this subsection, I list the inventory of personal pronouns of Mantauran, by concentrating on important morphological characteristics while pointing out notational discrepancies and providing an analytic reassessment of earlier studies (cf. § 6.2.1.1). Three main issues are discussed: the morphological formation of personal pronouns (cf. § 6.2.1.2), the occurrence of pronominal variants (cf. § 6.2.1.3) and the “free” vs. “bound” status of Mantauran pronominal forms (cf. § 6.2.1.4).
Mantauran personal pronouns include four sets, which are labelled as follows: Topic, Nominative, Oblique and Genitive. These four sets are listed in Table 6.4 and further illustrated in the paradigmatic examples that follow. Their use and function will be explained in section 8.2.

to fit the general pronominal system in Mantauran”. He suspects that they “are probably demonstrative

pronouns”. While this last statement is correct, the transcription of these two forms is, on the other hand,

rather inaccurate, and should be transcribed as ana and ana-lu [ana-lo].

6.2.1.1 Reassessment of earlier analyses Li (1977 and 1996) provides two other sets of pronouns both treated as “independent/free”.
The first set, mentionned in Li (1977) comprises the following forms: aanga-li, aanga-’o, aanga-ni, aanga-dha, aanga-ta, aanga-nai, aanga-nomi, aanga-lini and aanga-lidha. The second set, cited in Li (1996), includes: ka-li, ka-’o, ka-i, ka-dha, ka-ta, ka-nai, ka-nomi, ka-lini and ka-lidha. In both sets, the forms aanga- ‘who’103 and -ka ‘not’ can be treated as a base to which is suffixed a genitive pronoun. Li (1977) does not comment on the first pronominal set. He mentions in his later

103 The meaning of aanga- remains unclear, as I have been unable to find the root of this nominalized form.

2 95

Elizabeth Zeitoun

publication that ka-li (and the rest of the paradigm) only “occurs in negative sentences and yes/no questions” (1996:211), as illustrated below:

(6.48) a. ’oponoho-ka-’o? Mantauran-Neg-2S.Gen ‘Are you Mantauran?’

b. ka ’oponoho-ka-li. Neg Mantauran-Neg-1S.Gen ‘I am not Mantauran.’

I have not included either of these forms in the above table because they do not fit into the system of Mantauran personal pronouns. As shown in Zeitoun (1997), the reasons that can be advanced to sustain this claim are both lexical and distributional/syntactic.
On the lexical level, aanga-ni or ka-i, for instance, are never given as the counterparts of ‘s/he’. The former translates as ‘who’ and the latter as ‘not’. Besides, there are a few instances where -ka is followed by an oblique pronoun:

(6.49)

om-iki-ka-imia’e

lalake valrovalro?

Dyn.Fin-exist-Neg-2S.Obl child young woman

‘Do you have (grown up) daughter(s)?’

On the syntactic level, it appears that the form aanga-+Gen: (i) occurs in a number of related paradigms (cf. § 8.4):

(6.50) a. aanga-’o? aanga-2S.Gen ‘Who are you?’~‘Is that yours?’

b. aanga-li! aanga-1S.Gen ‘It’s me!’~‘It’s mine’

c’. aanga-li

ta-langai

dha’ane.

aanga-1S.Gen SubjNmz-Dyn.NFin:buy house

‘It is I who bought a house?’ (as an answer to (c))

but never substitutes with any other pronominal forms:

(6.51) a. o-lralrame-nga-lrao. Dyn.Fin-run-already-1S.Nom ‘I have already run.’

b. o-lralrame-nga

ana.

Dyn.Fin-run-already that

‘He has already run’

c. * o-lralrame-nga aanga-li/aanga-i. Dyn.Fin-run-already aanga-1S.Gen/aanga-3S.Gen

(ii) it shares the same morphological shape and syntactic distribution as other interrogative words, e.g., aanga-i ‘who?, whom?’, kana-ni ‘what?’, aikie-ni ‘which?, where? (Lit: ‘its existence?’)’, omi-ni ‘what’s (his/her) name (Lit.: ‘its calling?’)’.
Li (1996) treats the sequence ka-+Gen as “free”. However, as mentioned in Zeitoun (1997:322), since (i) an NP cannot be inserted between the verb and the sequence ka-+Gen, (ii) ka-+Gen must precede oblique pronouns that are bound, (iii) it cannot be used independently as an answer to a question, (iv) when preposed in initial position, it must be preceded by i, I believe that the form -ka+Gen should be regarded as bound. These distributional constraints are illustrated in the examples that follow:

(6.52) a. o-kane-ka-li

ka velevele.

Dyn.Fin-eat-Neg-1S.Gen

Neg banana

I will come back on the sequence -ka+Gen in other sections, in particular when discussing (i) the syntactic distribution of pronouns (cf. § 8.2) and (ii) the distribution and functions of Mantauran negators (cf. § 8.3.5).

6.2.1.2 Major morphological characteristics Morphologically, Mantauran personal pronouns exhibit the following characteristics, some of
which are common to many Formosan languages, some of which are much more peculiar. They include the following
1. lexical innovations: compare, for instance, the form -lrao instead of –aku, found in many Formosan (e.g., Saisiyat y-ako ‘I’) and in the other Rukai dialects (e.g., Budai/Tanan (n-)aku ‘I’).

2. case making: there is no morphological marking for nominative pronouns though oblique pronouns display such a marking, cf. i-…-e. This observation is not surprising in itself, since in Mantauran, (full) nominative NPs are unmarked for case, as shown below.

(6.56) a. o-lralrame-nga

taotao.

Dyn.Fin-run-already Taotao

‘Taotao ran.’

298

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

b. dhipolo ’a ma-’amadhe taotao. Dhipolo Top Stat.Fin-dislike Taotao ‘As for Dhipolo, she dislikes Taotao.’

In the other Rukai dialects and in many Formosan languages, the prefixes k, t or c are prototypically used to encode the nominative (cf. Tona Rukai kake ‘1S.Nom’, koso’2S.Nom’, kita ‘1PI.Nom’ etc.; ), while the suffix an generally indicates a “location” and subsumes the “oblique”, “accusative” and “locative” cases (cf. Tona Rukai nakoa ‘1S.Obl’, mosoa ‘2S.Obl’, mitia ‘1PI.Obl’ etc.), see Huang et al. (1999).

3. gaps: the gap in the nominative set for third person participants is filled by the use of demonstrative pronouns.

(6.57) Mantauran

a. o-kane-nga

velevele Ø.

Dyn.Fin-eat-already banana Ø

‘(S/he) ate a banana.’

b. o-kane-nga

velevele ana.

Dyn.Fin-eat-already banana that

‘S/he ate a banana.’

4. exclusive/non-exclusive distinction: This distinction is common not only to the Formosan languages but also to most Austronesian languages (cf. -mita ‘we (me and you)’ vs. -nai ‘we (me and him/her but not you)’.

5. visibility distinction: The distinction with respect to visibility (cf. -ni ‘his (+vis)’ vs. -dha ‘his (-invis)’) is not that common in the Formosan languages (see Huang et al. 1999) and is not found in all the Rukai dialects (e.g., there is no such distinction in Budai Rukai).

6. number distinction: The number distinction is made for third person pronouns, cf. -ine/-idhe ‘s/he (Obl)’ vs. -iline/-ilidhe ‘they (Obl)’ and -ni/-dha ‘his/her’ vs. -lini ‘their’.
The plural formation differs for oblique/genitive pronominal forms and demonstrative pronouns, cf. l(a)- as in l-i-ni ‘their’ vs. -lo as in dhona-lo ‘those, they’. As shown above (cf. § 6.1.4), while la- occurs in a number of non-common nouns, e.g., la-’ivoko ‘friends’, no other usage of -lo as a plural suffix has ever been reported. lo- must be viewed as an innovation in Mantauran because this prefix is found in no other Rukai dialects and the formation and grammaticalization of

2 99

Elizabeth Zeitoun

demonstratives in Mantauran does not correspond to that found in Labuan or Tanan,104 whereby the case marker is incorporated into the demonstrative form and further grammaticalized to refer to a third person participant, cf. for instance Tanan ko-ani/ko-adra ‘that, s/he’ vs. ko-l-ini/ko-l-idra ‘those, they’ (< ko ‘Nom’).

7. similar pronominal shapes: “Topic” pronouns and “oblique” pronouns exhibit similar morphological shapes, cf. -imia’e, -iname and -inome. These two pronominal sets must be treated as distinct, however, because of the occurrence of ilrae vs. -iae. The formation of ilrae leads to posit that “topic” pronouns are formed on the following pattern: i-+base, the identical vowel i being deleted in sequences such as i-imia’e. Third person pronouns – actually demonstrative pronouns – do not fit into this paradigm: they are never preceded by i-, even if they occur in initial position (§ 8.1.1.1.1.4).

6.2.1.3 Occurrence of pronominal variants There are a number of pronominal “variants” in Mantauran, cf. -lrao vs. nao-, -’o vs. -ko, -ni
vs. -i, -mita vs. ta-, -nai vs. nai- and imite vs. ita. The major goal of this section is to determine whether these forms: (i) occur in free variations,
(ii) represent allomorphs or (iii) are syntactically or semantically constrained. These three possibilities are not unheard of in the Formosan languages. In Tsou, while the reportedly two different dialectal forms (cf. Chang 1997) -ko and -su
‘2S.Nom’ occur in free variations in the Tfuya dialect, ’u and -’o ‘1S.Nom’ can be treated as allomorphs, since -’u co-occurs with auxiliary verbs ending in /a, o/ and -’o with auxiliary verbs ending in /e, i/ (see Zeitoun 1992, 1995a and 2005).
The occurrence of pronominal prefixes, on the other hand, is syntactically constrained in

6.2.1.3.1 -mo’o vs. -mi’ The distinction between -mo’o and mi’- was discussed in section 3.1.2.1: -mo’o is never
followed by another clitic, while -mi’- is always followed by another clitic (except -imite, which merges with -mo’o as -mite).

The main variation between Mantauran and Tona (or Maga) is that while Mantauran exhibits gaps (i.e., there is no prefixal forms for the 2nd and 3rd person pronouns), Tona (and Maga) possess a
nearly complete paradigm.

The occurrence of the genitive pronoun -ko, as opposed to -’o is very restricted: it only appears in counterfactual and causal clauses, and is usually attached to la ‘and, so that’:

105 Wang (2003:86) points out that ni- in Tona can also refer to a non-visible referent, but only provides a few examples. Since there is no overt morphological marking, I therefore assume that there is a gap in the third person plural.

It seems rather difficult to account for the variation between -ni vs. -i, either on the phonological or on the morpho-syntactic level. Compare: aanga-i ‘who’ (and not *aanga-ni) vs. kana-ni ‘what’ (and not *kana-i) and dha’ane-ni ‘his/her house’ (and not *dha’ane-i) vs. kapadha’anenga-i ‘all his/her houses’ (and not *kapadha’anenga-ni).
The distinction between imite, as opposed to ita is also a tricky one: while imite functions as ‘topic’, ita can be treated as the topical counterpart of ta- + V. Thus, they usually do not substitute for one another. Compare:

6.2.1.4 The “free” vs. “bound” status of Mantauran pronominal forms Divergent conclusions have been drawn regarding the status of Mantauran pronominal forms
as “free” or “bound”. Li (1996) argues that the nominative forms -lrao, -mo’o etc. are “free”. The underlying
assumption that pertains this claim is that “long” pronominal forms should be treated as “free” forms, and “short” forms as “bound”. In Zeitoun (1997), I raised a number of arguments against Li’s (1996) analysis in an attempt to show that Mantauran nominative pronouns should morphologically be treated as “bound”. These arguments are repeated below, corrections being brought to mistakes that may have appeared in this earlier publication.
Li (1996) proposes two pieces of evidence to support his claim: the first has to do with stress, the second with the sentential position of these pronouns.
Li assumes that nominative pronouns are free because they “receive a primary stress” (1996:212). Though we consulted the same informant, she never confirmed such a statement, neither did any of the other informants I later worked with. Stress usually falls on the first syllable of the predicate on which the nominative pronoun is attached to. Thus, ókane-nga-lrao ‘I have eaten already’ is perfectly grammatical while *ókane-nga-lráo is not.
His second argument is that a lexical form may be inserted between the verb and the pronoun. As an illustration, Li (ibid) provides only one example:

(6.69)

Adapted from Li (1996:212)

matara dho’a lrao.

catch two

1S.Nom

‘I took two.’

If nominative pronouns were “free”, then they should appear either after or before the verb and after the second verb in a so-called serial verb construction. That is, they should share the same distribution as full lexical NPs. This is not true, however: lrao cannot appear between matara and

3 05

Elizabeth Zeitoun

dho’a:

(6.70) * matara lrao

dho’a.

catch 1S.Nom two

The “fixed” position of lrao is confirmed by the fact that (6.71b) and (6.71d) – where lrao is positioned after the second verb of the clause – are also ungrammatical.

d. * ’o-tolro-lo-nga times-three-times-already

kone-lrao. Dyn.Subj:eat-1S.Nom

Li’s claim is based on the assumption that matara and dho’a are two verbs, while they form, in fact, a complex predicate, formed by the numeral classifier matara- and the bound numeral form -dho’a (cf. 5.9). This analysis is supported by a number of lexical and morpho-syntactic tests. First, the lexical item given in isolated elicitation for ‘take, catch’ is omalra, not matara-. Besides, if omalra is substituted for matara, the sentence becomes ungrammatical.

b. om-alra-lrao Dyn.Fin-catch-1S.Nom ‘I caught two.’

dho’a. two

Third, as shown in section 5.10, different numeral forms are used when counting and in that respect, nosa ‘two’ constrasts with dho’a ‘two’. The first occurs in serial counting, as in one, two, three, four etc. (cf. neka, nosa, tolro, pate etc.); the second set is composed of bound numeral forms

Two more distributional tests support the claim that Mantauran nominative pronouns should be treated as bound:
First, they cannot be used independently in answers to questions like ‘Who is it? Me!’

(6.74) a. aanga-’o? aanga-2S.Gen ‘Who are you?’

b. aanga-li/*aanga-lrao! aanga-1S.Gen/*aanga-1S.Nom ‘It’s me!’

Second, they can never be moved in sentence-initial position:

If one goes a step further in comparing Mantauran with other Formosan languages, e.g., Amis and Kavalan– where nominative pronouns have been shown to be “free” (cf. Huang 1995, Y. Chang 2000b) – and Tsou – where nominative pronouns are “bound” (cf. Tung et al. 1964, Zeitoun 1992, Szakos 1994 and Chang 1997) – one is forced to conlude that Mantauran nominative pronouns exhibit the characteristics of “bound” pronouns.

Mantauran oblique pronouns should also be treated as “bound”, because they tend to phonologically merge with the preceding nominative or genitive pronoun they attached to, yielding either the deletion of the last vowel of the preceding pronominal form or its morphological reshaping.106

Genitive pronouns are also “bound” to the preceding noun or negator they attach to:

106 Li comes up with nearly the same conclusion, suggesting that “nominative pronouns are bound to the

following accusative pronouns” (1996:212). However, the example he mentions to illustrate his claim is

misanalyzed: Li treats ’ ‘you’ as a nominative pronoun, but it functions actually as a genitive pronoun.

I turn now to the status of Mantauran personal pronouns, i.e., should they be treated as “affixes” or “clitics”? An approximative definition of clitics vs. affixes goes as follows: clitics are syntactically free, though phonologically bound to their host, affixes are syntactically and phonologically bound.
I have shown in Zeitoun (1997b) that nominative and oblique pronouns should be regarded as clitics, and this analysis is briefly summarized below.
Two types of arguments have been advanced to distinguish between clitics and affixes, the first is morphological in nature, the second is syntactic.
Zwicky and Pullum (1983) argue that clitics usually exhibit a low degree of selection with respect to their hosts, while affixes are highly restrictive in their selection. As far as their distribution is concerned, these two types of pronouns are rather insensitive to their hosts.

Moore (1994:338) argues that clitics cannot cross over other clitics and that they never move out of a finite clause, if headed by Infl. In Mantauran, nominative and genitive pronouns occur closer to the verb – in that case, they occur in complementary distribution – than oblique pronouns, i.e., the former two never cross over the latter; nominative and genitive pronouns always occur on the first verb, i.e., they never move out of a finite clause.

Another difference between “pronominal clitics” vs. “pronominal suffixes” lies in the fact that the former fill argument positions on the verb while the latter do not play any syntactic function, i.e., they express redundantly the semantic features (person, number and gender) of the NP they corefer with. Thus, both suffixes and clitics play a role in agreement, but the notion of “grammatical” (carried out by suffixes) vs. “anaphoric/pronominal” (played by clitics) agreement must be distinguished. The definition proposed by Bresnan and Mchombo (1987:741) goes as follows: “in grammatical agreement, a NP bears an argument relation to the verb, while the verbal affix expresses redundantly the person, number, and gender of the NP. In anaphoric agreement, the verbal affix is an incorporated pronominal argument of the verb, and the coreferential NP has a nonargument function – it is either an adjunct of the pronominal argument, or as a topic or focus of the clause or discourse structure.”
Bresnan and Mchombo (1987) make a number of syntactic predictions concerning the (im)possible occurrence of the S(ubject) M(arker) and O(bject) M(arker) in Chichewa, and some of

these can account for the distribution of nominative/oblique pronouns in Mantauran. First, they show that the anaphorically bounded antecedent is a Topic. Mantauran free pronouns, which function as Topics, must corefer with a bound nominative pronoun attached to the verb.

(6.87) a. ilrae

o-kane-nga-lrao

1S.Top Dyn.Fin-eat-already-1S.Nom

‘As for me, I ate a banana.’

velevele. banana

b. * ilrae

o-kane-nga-Ø

1S.Top Dyn.Fin-eat-already

velevele. banana

Second, anaphoric agreement can be nonlocal. In Mantauran, oblique pronouns may occur on any verb in a series of two.

(6.88) a.

ma-rimoro-lra-idhe

pato’o

Stat.Fin-forget-1S.Nom-3S.Obl

Dyn.Subj:tell

ni-tipitip-idhe

dhipolo.

Cntrfct-Dyn.NFin:beat-3S.Obl

Dhipolo

‘I forgot to tell Taotao to beat Dhipolo.’

taotao Taotao

b. ma-rimoro-lrao

pato’o-idhe

Stat.Fin-forget -1S.Nom Dyn.Subj:tell-3S.Obl

ni-tipitipi-idhe

dhipolo.

Cntrfct-Dyn.NFin:beat-3S.Obl

Dhipolo

‘I forgot to tell Taotao to beat Dhipolo.’

taotao Taotao

Third, they state that it is impossible to question the subject or the object of a clause if it is cross-referenced within the same clause by a SM or an OM. In Mantauran, neither nominative nor oblique pronouns can be questioned.

(6.89) a. * aanga-i

a-cengel-ae-’-ine?

who-3S.Gen ObjNmz-Dyn.NFin:see-ObjNmz-2S.Gen-3S.Obl

b. aanga-i

a-cengel-ae-’o?

who-3S.Gen ObjNmz-Dyn.NFin:see-ObjNmz-2S.Gen

‘Whom did you see?’

Fourth, they argue that only agreement affixes carry over the semantic features (e.g., person,

313

Elizabeth Zeitoun

number and gender) redundantly expressed on the verb. If it was true that Mantauran nominative pronouns were agreement markers, then the following example should be incorrect. It is perfectly grammatical, though, nai co-referring with dhipolo.

(6.90)

ma’a-taka-taka-na-ine

dhipolo.

Dyn.Fin:Rec-Red-elder sibling-1PE.Nom-3S.Obl Dhipolo

‘Dhipolo and I are sisters.’

Finally, such pronominal arguments usually increase the transitivity of the clause. In Mantauran, the additional occurrence of an oblique pronoun increases the syntactic and semantic transitivity of the verb/sentence. Oblique pronouns must be treated as arguments of the verbs – thus clitics – because their non-occurrence yields either the ungrammaticality of the derived sentence or variations in meaning.

6.2.2 Impersonal pronouns

Impersonal pronouns, which do not designate a specific participant but rather refer to an indefinite entity, only occur in certain generic contexts but are used quite productively in Mantauran (see Zeitoun and Lin 2003). They have only been reported in Mantauran and Tona Rukai (cf. Zeitoun 2003, Wang 2003).
In Mantauran, there are three impersonal pronouns, -mao ‘Nom’, -mao ‘Gen’ and -imae ‘Obl’.107 Their morphological behavior is identical to that of personal nominative, genitive and oblique pronouns.

‘If one went to other villages, one had to walk all (the way).’

107 In my opinion, there are no “topic” impersonal pronouns, as claimed by Wang (2003).

6.2.3 Demonstrative pronouns

In this section, I deal with demonstrative pronouns.108 They are distinguished in terms of: visibility (cf. visible/invisible) and distance (cf. near to the speaker, near the hearer but far from the speaker, far from both). I have not been able to detect any semantic variation between demonstrative that have incorporated ’i and those which have not and thus treat them here as variants.

(6.94) a. b. c. d.

’ina~’ina’i ana~ana’i ona~ona’i dhona~dhona’i

‘this [+vis, -far from the speaker]’ ‘that [+vis, + far from the speaker, -far from the hearer]’ ‘that [±vis, ±far from the speaker and the hearer]’ ‘that [-vis, + far from the speaker and the hearer]’

(6.95) aanga-i

ana/ana’i?

who-3S.Gen that

‘Who is s/he?’

They can all occur in the plural form through the suffixation of -lo to the base:

(6.96) a. b. c. d.

’ina-lo~’ina’i-lo ‘these’ ana~ana’i-lo ‘those’ ona~ona’i-lo ‘those’ dhona~dhona-lo ‘those’

(6.97) aanga-i

ana-lo/ana’i-lo?

who-3S.Gen that-plur

‘Who are they?’

108 Cf. section 5.11 for a discussion on the distinction between demonstrative pronouns and adominal demonstratives.

316

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

As mentioned in section 5.9, demonstrative pronouns can also refer to a temporal or spatial location, in which case the occurrence of the plural suffix -lo is ungrammatical.

There is only one demonstrative pronoun, cf. reea ‘there’ that functions as a locative demonstrative.

‘It is (over) there.’

6.2.4 Summary

I have tried to show in this section that while the Mantauran personal pronouns still preserve certain morphological characteristics found in the other Rukai dialects as well as the Formosan languages, it also exhibits a number of peculiar/innovated features: cf. the replacement of aku by -lrao ‘1S.Nom’, the coalescence of nominative/genitive and oblique pronouns onto the verbal stem, the occurrence of impersonal pronouns, the use of the plural suffix -lo on demonstrative pronouns.

6.3 NOMINALIZATION109
Nominalization is a very productive process in Mantauran, readily seen on the morphological level.
Derived nominals are identified as such based on their identical distribution with other
109 This section is based on a paper that was published in 2002 (cf. Zeitoun 2002). The data and the analysis proposed here have been refined and augmented. Some of the ideas that were published in 2002 have proved to be incorrect, and whenever there is a discrepancy between that earlier publication and the ideas presented here, there is a brief note about it.

nominal arguments (cf. § 8.2), and their sharing the same morpho-syntactic properties:

1. They occur in an argument position of a verb/predicate:

(6.100) a. o-kaodh-iname

ka paiso.

Dyn.Fin-not exist-1PE.Obl Neg money

‘We did not have any money.’

b. akaodho ka ki-lrihoa’-e-li. not exist Neg Neg-Dyn.NFin:know-ObjNmz-1S.Gen ‘There is nothing that I do not know.’

2. They can be modified by another noun, i.e., they function as the head of the nominal phrase:
(6.101) a. velevele-ni taotao. banana-3S.Gen Taotao ‘Taotao’s banana’

b. kane-ni Dyn.NFin:eat-3S.Gen ‘Taotao’s eating’

taotao. Taotao

3. They may co-occur with a genitive pronoun:110
(6.102) a. ina-li mother-1S.Gen ‘my mother’

b. a-pa-solate-nai ActNmz-Caus-Dyn.NFin:study-1PE.Gen ‘our education’

4. They can undergo topicalization:

110 “Subjective” nouns – formed by the prefixation of ta- to the verb stem – cannot be followed by a genitive pronoun (see § 6.3.7).

Following Comrie and Thompson (1985), I examine different nominalization processes whereby nouns are derived from (i) verbs and turn into action/state nominals (§ 6.3.1), gerunds (§ 6.3.2) or argument nominals (§ 6.3.3); (ii) nouns (§ 6.3.4), and (iii) verb phrases or clauses, which turn into nominalized phrases/clauses (§ 6.3.5). A summary is given in section 6.3.6. In section 6.3.7, a number of morpho-syntactic tests are proposed that permit to differentiate lexically and syntactically derived nominals.

6.3.1 Action/state nominals

While I had lumped together action/state nominals and gerunds – their morphological marking overlap to some extent – I make a distinction between these two types of nominals, as they behave differently on the syntactic level (cf. § 6.3.6). More specifically, while action/state nominals are treated as lexically derived, gerunds are analyzed as syntactically derived.
Three nominalization processes are involved in the derivation of action/state nominals: zero derivation on dynamic verb roots, prefixation of a- on dynamic and stative verb roots/stems, prefixation of -ae on stative verb roots. The overlap between these two different processes on stative verbs (cf. a- vs. -ae) is pending further investigation. They are summarized in Tables 6.5-6.7 and further illustrated in examples that follow.

dhipolo. Dhipolo

Argument nominals may be divided into: subject(ive), objective, locative, instrumental/manner/result and temporal nouns.
6.3.3.1 Subject(ive) nominals

Subject(ive) nominalization is rendered by the prefixation of ta- to the verb base (see Table 6.9) and yields the meaning ‘one who/which…’. The “noun need not be in an ‘agent’ relationship with the verb” (Comrie and Thompson 1985:350). Thus the adoption of the term “subjective”, suggested by M.-C. Paris, in place of “agentive” that narrows down the usage of ta-.

Another process has been reported in the Southeastern Rukai dialects as well as in other Formosan languages (Saisiyat, Atayal, Puyuma, Kavalan): the infixation of <in> that correlates an aspectual/modal distinction, i.e., perfective/realis vs. imperfective/irrealis (Teng 2000 and forthcoming, Yeh 2000c, Chen 1999). In Saisiyat, for instance, the distinction between “past” and “future” is usually expressed through a different device, e.g., <in> vs. ka-...-en.

The infix <in> is found in a very few fossilized lexical items in the Northern Rukai dialects (Mantauran, Tona and Maga). In Mantauran, the realis/irrealis distinction is also found but while realis is not overtly marked (cf. the occurrence of (a-)…-ae), the irrealis is expressed by -a or -i.

6.3.3.3 Locative nominals

Locative nominalization (which implies that “X is the place where Y did/does something”) manifests itself through the circumfixation of ta-...-ae to the verb base.
Only one locative nominal – derived from the verb omiki ‘be at, exist’ – was found to be formed by the suffixation of -ae (and not the circumfixation of ta-...-ae); cf. kiki-ae ‘space’.

6.3.3.4 Instrumental, manner and result nominals

Morphologically speaking, instrumental, manner and result nominals are treated the same in Mantauran (cf. Tables 6.12-6.13). This type of nominalization is indicated through the prefixing

334

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

of ’a- (< P(roto) R(ukai) *sa-, cf. Starosta (1995)) to the verb base. The main distinction lies in the fact that an “instrumental”114 meaning is obtained if the verb is dynamic (Table 6.12) while a “manner” interpretation is perceived if the verb is inherently stative (Table 6.13). If a stative verb has previously undergone another morpho-syntactic process (e.g., causativization), then the derived nominal might be instrumental, cf. ma-poli ‘white’ > pa-ka-poli ‘make...white’ > ’a-pa-ka-poli-poli ‘detergent’, ma-’ete > pa-ka-’ete > ’a-pa-ka-’ete-’ete ‘anesthesia’. In co-occurrence with other prefixes (e.g., po- ‘put, give, make’), ’a- conveys another interpretation: “as a result of...” (Table 6.14).

6.3.4 Nouns turning into other (more abstract) nouns

Two major classes of nouns turning into other (abstract) nouns through a process of nominalization have been found: locative and temporal nouns. These are examined in turn below.
6.3.4.1 Locative nominals

I showed in Zeitoun (1995:143) that there are three major ways of referring to a location in Mantauran: the suffix -ae (PR *-ane) is added to non-human nouns, e.g., i-vililr-ae ‘behind’; -nae (<-n-ae) is generally added to human118 common nouns, e.g., dha’an-a-nae ‘household’; and -ine is added to human non-common/personal nouns occurring in the oblique case, e.g., ipol-ine ‘Ipolo (Obl)’. Among these, the first two represent instances of nominalization, whereby a noun turns into another noun. There are two other nominalization processes: the first consists of the circumfixation of ta-...-ae to a non-human base; the second does not allow any type of affixation, but reduplication of the human base implies a location. These four types of nominalization—ta-N[–human]…-ae, (Red-)N[±human]…-ae, N[+human]…-nae, Red-N[+human]—do not only differ in terms of the morphological

118 As shown in Chapter 3, -nae may also appear on non-human common nouns, e.g., holrol-a-nae ‘(one) mountain’.

6.3.4.2 Temporal nominals

At least two morphological processes whereby temporal nouns turn into other (temporal) nouns have been identified.
The first, which consists of the circumfixation of kala-...-ae ‘season’ to [–temporal] nouns, is productive to the extent that even loans (e.g., ’aomo ‘Japanese’, ciokoko ‘Chinese’) can be taken as the base of derivation (cf. § 4.1). The second consists of the suffixation of -nae to the base to form temporal adjuncts.

6.3.5 Clausal nominalization

Comrie and Thompson (1985:392) use the term “clausal nominalization” to refer to the process by which clauses are nominalized. Though I have dubbed this process “adverbial nominalization” (so-called because one of the structures in question can be glossed as “when X happened/happens”) in a recent paper (see Zeitoun, 2000), I am adopting Comrie and Thompson’s terminology for the sake of clarity.
This type of nominalization process is readily seen in temporal, conditional, and concessive clauses in Mantauran. Three different processes are involved:
(i) If the verb refers to a situation that has already taken place, it is prefixed by a- (temporal clauses); see Table 6.18.
(ii) If the verb refers to a situation that is to happen or may happen, it appears in its subjunctive form (conditional/hypothetical clauses); see Table 6.19.
(iii) If the verb indicates a concession, it is circumfixed by ni-...-a(e) (concessive clauses); see Table 6.20.

6.3.6 Summary

In the foregoing subsections, I have outlined the different nominalization processes that have been uncovered in Mantauran so far. This derivational process, which is very productive and fairly predictable, can be said to be unconstrained because:
(i) loan words and compounds can undergo nominalization (§ 4.1 and § 3.2.3), cf. kala-’aom-ae ‘Japanese era/occupation’ and ta-pa-’ototalo-e solate ‘schoolbag’;
(ii) a verb can undergo different types of nominalization; e.g., gerund kane ‘eating’, Subject(ive) nominalization ta-kane ‘(who) eats/ate’, objective nominalization a-kan-ae ‘food’, locative nominalization ta-kanekan-ae ‘restaurant’, instrumental nominalization ’a-kane ‘instrument used to eat; e.g., fork’, etc.;
(iii) it is not blocked because of the existence of lexical items “already filling the ‘slot’ which the derived form” might occupy, as argued by Comrie and Thompson (1985:358), cf. ’a-pana ‘arrow’ (< o-pana ‘shoot with a bow’) vs. lraili ‘arrow’.

Table 6.21 provides a recapitulation of these different processes.

6.3.7 Distinction between syntactically and lexically derived nominals

The following examples show that the same morphological processes are actually used to derive nominals both through lexical and syntactic processes:

(6.133) a. Lexically derived action nominal

kala-’aom-ae

a-pa-sola-solate

TempNmz-Japanese-TempNmz ActNmz-Caus-Red-Dyn.NFin:study

‘Japanese education’

a’. Syntactically derived clausal nominal dhona'i a-pa-sola-solate-dh-iname... that ClsNmz-Caus-Red-Dyn.NFin:study-3S.Gen-1PE.Obl ‘At that time, when they taught us...’

b. Lexically derived objective nominal

dhona’i ’a kasa-dha

dhona’i

that Top only-3S.Gen that

a-kan-ae-nai. ObjNmz-Dyn.NFin:eat-ObjNmz-1PE.Gen ‘That was the only food we had.’

b’. Syntactically derived objective nominal

ma-taadhi’i kone

a-kan-ae-ni

Dyn.Fin-good Dyn.Subj:eat ObjNmz-Dyn.NFin:eat-ObjzNmz

mairange.

sweet potato
‘The sweet potato he ate was good.’

These two types of nominals exhibit different morpho-syntactic properties that are enumerated and illustrated in turn below.
1. The occurrence of a genitive pronoun after syntactically derived nominals is obligatory, optional with lexically derived nominals.

Chapter 7 Verbal morphology
This chapter deals with verbal morphology. The major morpho-syntactic characteristics of verbs (as opposed to nouns) were given in section 5.1, and a justification for the absence of adjectives (as opposed to stative verbs) was provided in section 5.2.
Section 7.1 deals with verb formation, verb classification and verbal alternations. It focuses more particularly on the dynamic/stative dichotomy and on the notion of “verbalization” (as opposed to nominalization). In section 7.2, various valency change operations are discussed, including: (i) dynamicization/stativization, (ii) passivization, (iii) causativization, (iv) anticausativization, (v) reflexivity and (vi) reciprocity. Section 7.3 deals with imperatives. Section 7.4 introduces the modal and aspectual system of Mantauran. Section 7.5 probes into negation. In section 7.6, a distinction is made between plurality and pluractionality. In section 7.7, the marking of collectivity/quantification is examined. Section 7.8 offers an overview on comparatives and superlatives.
7.1 Verb formation, verb classification and verbal alternations This section deals with verb formation, verb classification and verbal alternations. As the
notion of transitivity is not overtly marked on the verb, it won’t be further discussed here unless necessary. 7.1.1 Verb formation and verb classification
Mantauran, like many other Formosan languages exhibits a dichotomy between dynamic and stative verbs. Verbs can, of course, be derived from nouns through the prefixation to the base of verbalizing prefixes, e.g., to- ‘make, produce, build’ as in to-dha’ane ‘build a house’ (< dha’ane ‘house’), ’a-…-ae ‘(have) a lot’ as in ’a-cakel-ae ‘marry’ (< cakele ‘sexual partner’). 7.1.1.1 Dynamic verbs
The prefixes o-, om-, m- and Ø- attach to dynamic verbal roots. It was shown in section 3.1.2.2.1 that these four prefixes must be regarded as grammatical allomorphs. Among these, o- is the most productive prefix; om- and Ø the least productive. Examples are given below:

7.1.1.2 Stative verbs Stative verbs are characterized by the fact that they represent bound roots. Unlike other
Formosan languages whereby stative verbs can be marked by Ø- or ma- (cf. Huang 2000 on Atayal, Zeitoun 2001 on Saisiyat), nearly all stative verbs are marked by ma- in their finite form. To my knowledge the only stative verb that differs is ’osangedha’a ‘long’ (< -sangedha’a).

7.1.1.3 Verbalizing affixes There are a number of verbalizing affixes in Mantauran, i.e., verbal prefixes that turn a noun
into a verb. An exhaustive list with illustrative examples was given in section 3.2.1.2. A sample is provided below for reference:
The less productive verbalizing affixes include: 1. o-…-e ‘dress well’, e.g., o-sava-savar-ae ‘dress well (as of a young man)’ from savare ‘young man’, o-valrovalro-e ‘dress well (as of a young woman)’ from valrovalro ‘young woman’.

7.1.2 Verbal alternations

The dynamic/stative contrast is a very pervasive one and that it reflects in many constructions. Most dynamic and stative verbs exhibit three verbal alternations: finite, non-finite and subjunctive.124 Denominal verbs, on the other hand, are invariable and won’t be further discussed in this section.
The three verbal alternation, finite, non-finite and subjunctive are defined and illustrated in section 7.2.1. In sections 7.2.2-7.2.3, all the constructions that induce a non-finite and a subjunctive verb form are listed, with a brief summary given in section 7.2.4.

123 Other noun~verb alternations include:

(i) cipi

‘small taro’

~ o-cipi

‘flatten’

kacekace ‘skin’

~ o-kacekace

‘peel off skin’

halacehace ‘comb’

~ o-halacehace ‘(to) comb’

coloko ‘glutinous cake’ ~ o-coloko

‘make glutinous cake’

cf. also to-coloko

‘make glutinous cake’

124 Scholars have referred to verbal alternations differently in the literature on Formosan languages. Li

(1973:162), for instance, treats embedded verb forms as “non-finite”. Ross (1995), on the other hand, makes a

distinction between indicative verb forms (that include the finite/non-finite dichotomy established in the

present study) and atemporal verb forms (that correspond to the subjunctive).

7.1.2.1 Finite, non-finite and subjunctive forms A verb occurs in its finite form (i) when it is in matrix position – it thus refers to a past or
present event (realis) – (ii) it is not preceded by any verbal prefix, e.g., amo- ‘will’, pa- ‘causative’ and (iii) if it does not follow any conjunction, e.g., la ‘and’ or mani ‘then’.
A verb occurs in its non-finite form (i) when it is preceded by any verbal prefix, e.g., amo‘will’, pa- ‘causative’, even if it occurs in matrix position – it can refer to a realis or irrealis situation – or (ii) if it does follow a conjunction, e.g., la ‘and’ or mani ‘then’.
A verb occurs in its subjunctive form (i) when it appears in embedded position as V2, (ii) in imperative sentences, (iii) in conditional/hypothetical clauses.

7.1.2.1.1 Finite marking of dynamic/stative verbs Dynamic verbs are marked by o-, om-, m- and Ø- in their finite forms. Examples were given
above in (7.1a-d). Nearly all stative verbs are marked by ma- in their finite form. Examples were provided in (7.2a-b).

7.1.2.1.2 Non-finite marking of dynamic/stative verbs Dynamic verbs marked by o-, om-and Ø- are unmarked in their finite forms. Dynamic verbs
that are marked by m- alternate with k- (only one such verb collected so far, cf. maava’i~kaava’i ‘come’) or p- (all the other verbs):

7.1.2.2.5 Nominalization Mantauran exhibits different skins of nominalization that were discussed in Chapter 6 (cf. §
6.3). Most nominalization processes (except perhaps gerund) induces a non-finite verb form. Three paradigms (subjective nominalization, locative nominalization and clausal nominalization) are given below to illustrate this point.

7.1.2.2.6 The conjunctions la ‘and’ and mani ‘then’ The conjunction la ‘and’ can coordinate two nouns, two verbs or two clauses (cf. § 9.3). The
verb that follows la always appears in its non-finite form.

7.1.2.3 Constructions that induce a subjunctive verb form As mentioned above, the subjunctive form is induced when (i) when a verb appears in

7.2 Valency-changing derivations
There are at least four morphological operations that induce a valency change: (i) dynamicization or stativization of a verb, (ii) passivization, (iii) causativization, (iv) anti-causativization, (v) reflexivity and (vi) reciprocity. Dynamicization and causativization represent valence-increasing devices while stativization, passivization, anti-causativization, reflexivity and reciprocity are valence-decreasing operations.
7.2.1 Dynamicization and stativization

A few verbs can be prefixed by both the dynamic verbal prefix o- and the stative verbal prefix ma-. In these instances, verbs marked by o- are usually transitive, those marked by ma- are intransitive:

(7.43) a. o-dhalrese ‘squeeze, knead’
b. o-solate ‘write’ c. o-kahici ‘mix’
d. o-kilisi ‘tighten’ e. o-lrotoko ‘break’ f. o-kane ‘eat’ g. o-ngoto’o ‘cut’ h. o-vecake ‘break in two’

~ ma-dhalrese ‘soft and tender, malleable,

squeezed’

~ ma-solate

‘(be) printed’

~ ma-kahici ‘(be) mixed together

(e.g., thread)’

~ ma-kilisi

‘(be) tightened’

~ ma-lrotoko ‘(be) broken’

~ ma-kane

‘(be) eaten’

~ ma-ngoto’o ‘(be) cut, short’

Another way to dynamicize a verb is to prefix to- to a stative verb base (cf. also § 4.7). Compare:

(7.45) a. b. c. d.

ma-takolra ma-taadhi’i ma-dhao ma-si’i

e. ma-toalrai ‘(be) big’

~ to-toalrai

‘make big’

The dynamicity of verbs prefixed by to- is particularly flagrant in view of the two reciprocal constructions ma’a- [+stative verb] vs. ma(a)- [+dynamic verb]:

(7.46) ma’a-ka-takolra ‘be bad to each other’ ~ maa-to-takolra ‘do sthg bad to each other’

(7.47) a. ma’a-ka-takolra

‘Dhipolo and Takanao are in bad terms.’

Rec:Dyn.Fin-make-bad Dhipolo and Takanao

‘Dhipolo and Takanao do bad things to each other.’

7.2.2 The active/passive voice dichotomy In most Formosan languages, two major syntactic devices – the morphological marking on
the verb and/or the noun – fulfill the grammatical coding of the subject: (i) The semantic role of the NP (agent, theme/patient, locative, instrument) selected as subject
is morphologically marked on the verb by means of an affix. Two main constructions are found. In the first, the agent is viewed as the focus of the clause (A(gent) F(ocus) construction). In the second, an NP other than the agent can function as subject (N(on)-Agent F(ocus) construction).127
(ii) The syntactic role of each NP argument is usually determined by a preceding case marker. In Tsou, for instance, case markers are obligatory (see Tung et al. 1964, Zeitoun 1992, 2000, 2005, Szakos 1994). In Wulai Atayal, on the other hand, full lexical NPs are usually not marked for case (see Huang 1993).
Mantauran differs from the Formosan languages in a number of respects. Some of these morpho-syntactic variations characterize the Rukai dialects as a linguistic group, while others are only found in Mantauran.
(i) Like the other Rukai dialects, Mantauran lacks the focus system commonly found in the other Formosan languages. Instead, it is characterized by an active/passive voice distinction, morphologically marked by the contrast o- and ’i-:

127 Among others, see Blust (2002) for an overview of the notion of ‘focus’/‘voice’ in Austronesian languages, and in Formosan languages in particular and Ross and Teng (2005) for a reinterpretation of the so-called focus system in Puyuma.

(i) With the exception of ’i, there is no pre-nominal case marker in Mantauran (cf. § 8.2). The present section focuses on the active/passive voice in Mantauran, further analyzed and illustrated in section 7.2.2.2. In section 7.2.2.1, I first deal with the morpho-syntactic discrepancies that are found between Mantauran and the other Rukai dialects.

7.2.2.1 Discrepancies between Mantauran and the other Rukai dialects There are at least three major variations between Mantauran and the other Rukai dialects: (i)
the morpho-syntactic opacity of o- and ’i-; (ii) the absence of a non-agentive passive; (iii) the passive-like interpretation yielded by verb-object agreement.
The two prefixes o- and ’i- have become portmanteau morphemes (cf. § 3.1.5) and the interaction between voice and modality is now rather opaque because of the various sound changes Mantauran has undergone: o- and ’i- can be shown to historically derive from the Proto-Rukai morphemes *w-a-129 and *ky-a-, whereby PR *w- indicated the active voice, in contrast to *kiwhich marked the (agentive) passive (see Zeitoun 1995, 2003, forthcoming a-b). The prefix aspecified mood, i.e., realis. The bimorphemic prefixes w-a- adjoined to dynamic verbs while ky-acould attach to both dynamic and stative verbs.

128 As explained in section 3.1.5, I do not think that the notion of “active” voice is primary in Mantauran Rukai. 129 Different analyses have been proposed, on the synchronic and diachronic levels. Li (1973:193) believes that in Tanan Rukai the active/passive voice dichotomy “is marked by the absence (active) or presence (passive) of the verbal prefix ki-” and treats wa- as a ‘past tense’ marker. Ross (1995:746) suggests that “the auxiliary [wa] was apparently downgraded from its status as main verb to that of mere adverb, and its subordinate verb instead became the main verb. As a result pronouns were no longer cliticized to the auxiliary, and the auxiliary itself, now no more than a tense/aspect marking particle, became cliticized to the verb. Thus Rukai wa ‘past’ is derived from the non-AC form of the Pan auxiliary *ua (AC pivot *m-ua) ‘past’, or as main verb ‘come’, reflected in the past auxiliaries Atayal ua-l, Sediq wa-da, Tsou o/m-o [...]”. Starosta (1995) proposes quite a similar development. I won’t go into further details here, but if wa- was regarded as a past tense marker, then we could not account for the occurrence of a- (and not wa-) in both passive and nominalized constructions in the Rukai dialects (other than Mantauran). Besides, verbs marked by w-a- (in Tana, Budai, Labuan and Tona)/o- (in Mantauran) do not only refer to the past but also to the present, the past/present [i.e., realis] interpretation depending on the co-occurrence of other constituents in the sentence.

380

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

In Mantauran, the prefix o- carries over various semantic and grammatical information, among others the dynamic/finite/realis/active voice status of the verb; ’i- is semantically less complex in that it only indicates that a verb is passive/realis.
Mantauran also differs from the other Rukai dialects in that it does not exhibit an “agentless” passive. In agentless passive constructions (as opposed to agentive passive constructions), the agent is covert. This dichotomy is expressed by the distinction between ky- vs. kw- in Budai, Labuan and Tanan,130 and by ky- vs. ’y- in Tona.

*(na coaw).

‘They have already been roasted.’

Mantauran differs from the other Rukai dialects (and the Formosan languages as a whole) in that it has developed an object-verb agreement, that will be discussed in more details in Chapter 8 (cf. § 8.2). Suffice it to say here that in many cases, this verb-object agreement leads to a passive interpretation, though the verb is marked as “active”, for instance:

130 Kuo’s (1979) analysis differs slightly from mine. He distinguishes three passives in Budai Rukai, an “ordinary passive” marked by ky-, an “adversative passive” marked by kw- and an “adjectival passive” marked by ni- (which I analyze as objective nominalization). Li (1973) only introduces one passive in Tanan Rukai, cf. ky-.

Lit.: ‘Father ate my whole banana/all my bananas on me.’

This phenomena explains perhaps why passive is not extremely productive in Mantauran. It can be easily elicited, but is found rarely in texts.
In the following two sections, I focus on the occurrence of the passive ’i- with dynamic and stative verbs and on the interaction between passive and mood.

7.2.2.2 Occurrence of the passive with dynamic and stative verbs Both dynamic and stative verbs can undergo passivization if they subcategorize two
arguments, an agent and a patient. Paradigmatic lists of dynamic and stative verbs are given below that illustrate this point. As demonstrated in section 7.1, the passive prefix ’i- attaches to a dynamic verb root, and to a stative verb stem.

7.2.3 Causative

Dixon (2000:78) identifies “five mechanisms for marking a causative – morphological, two verbs in one predicate, periphrastic, lexical and exchanging auxiliaries.”
Mantauran exhibits three of these mechanisms, morphological, periphrastic and lexical, the first of which is, by far, the most productive.

386

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

On the morphological level, Mantauran displays three causative morphemes, pa-, pi- and po(cf. Blust (2003) for a reconstruction of these three prefixes in PAN), which occur in complementary distribution: morphological causatives are formed through the prefixation of pa- to verb bases; the two prefixes pi- and po- only attach to certain nouns, the former referring to ‘locative causation’, the latter to ‘movement causation’.

Mantauran also exhibits a series of “reciprocal causatives”, cf. apaa- [+dynamic verb] vs. apa’a- [+stative verb]:

On the syntactic level, though the verb o-poa ‘make, do, put’ occurs in a serial verb construction (either in initial or in embedded position), it exhibits the characteristics of a periphrastic causative ‘make…do sthg’. This causative function is becoming opaque, though, because of the grammaticalization of o-poa as a supporting/auxiliary verb (see the discussion in section 4.4.1).

Taotao

‘I introduced Dhipolo to Taotao.’ (Lit: ‘I made Dhipolo and Taotao meet.’)

On the lexical level, one pair of lexemes was identified:

(7.61) a. Stative/Intransitive Finite Non-finite ma-’ete ka-’ete ‘die’

Dynamic/Transitive/Causative

Finite

Non-finite

mate’ete

the major contrast between these two forms lying in the notion of stativity/dynamicity (and not so much one of transitivity) as reflected in their non-finite forms.

Dixon (2000:60) reports, based on Nedjalkov, Otaina and Xolodovic (1995:67), that in Nivkh, a causative can form in two ways, through direct or indirect causation. He reproduces the schema given in Nedjalkov et al. (idid) in a symmetrical array. Such a schematic representation can also account for certain Mantauran verbs, such as: mo-kavole ‘go out’. A distributional paradigm of verbs taking the causatives pa-, pi- and po- is given in (7.75).

7.2.4 Anticausative

This section deals very briefly with the anticausative construction, whereby “a verb form [denotes] an involuntary dynamic event, i.e., an event which lacks a volitional agent” (Ross, 2004a:1). Puyuma has been reported as a language exhibiting an anticausative construction, with the occurrence of the prefix mu- on a verb that downgrades the syntactic function of the agent to a peripheral argument position. In a typical transitive sentence such as (7.82a), the agent is marked as genitive; it represents a core argument. In an anticausative clause such as (7.82b), it is marked as oblique.

Teng (Forthcoming) accounts for the distinctions between the movement prefix m-u- ‘to(ward)’ and the anticautive prefix mu- as follows:
(i) the movement prefix m-u- attaches to nouns referring to space and to deictic expressions to form denominal verbs; the anticausative mu- attaches to verbal roots (e.g., ba’iT burn, puwar ‘escape’, dupa’ ‘step, trample’, bu’uT ‘stop’)
(ii) denominal verbs (marked by m-u-) are verbs of motion; anticausative verbs (marked by mu-) imply a “passive” meaning
(iii) verbs of motion (marked by m-u-) subcategorize for an agentive subject while anticausative verbs (marked by mu-) subcategorize for a patientive subject

Mantauran exhibits also a construction that can be equated as ‘anticausative’. The verb is marked by mo-; the patientive subject is usually marked as nominative (less frequently as oblique). mocan attach to any type of verb (dynamic, stative or denominal verbs).

7.2.6 Reciprocals

There are at least four reciprocal prefixes in Mantauran Rukai: ma-Ca- (~pa-Ca-), ma(a)-, ma’a- (~pa/a-) and ma’a-pa- (~pa/a-pa-), (cf. also the two reciprocal causative prefixes discussed in section 7.2.3.3).
Besides marking reciprocity, these morphemes also encode two other pieces of information: the stativity/dynamicity and the finiteness/non-finiteness of the verb to which they attach. As shown below, these prefixes are verb-class sensitive (though there exist a few exception); the m~p alternation corresponds to the finite~non-finite dichotomy mentioned in section 7.1. The pluractionality of participants is rendered possible through the full reduplication (as defined in section 7.2.7) of the verbal/nominal root. The term ‘reciprocal’ is used as a cover term to refer to a reciprocal or a collective situation (reciprocity expressed on verbs) or a “converse” relationship (reciprocity marked on nouns).

7.2.6.1 ma-Ca- (~pa-Ca-) + dynamic verbs ma-Ca- (~pa-Ca-), whereby Ca- refers to the reduplication of the first consonant followed by
the vowel a, attaches to dynamic verbs, e.g., ma-ra-raa’e ‘snatch from each other’ ~ ma-ra-ra-raa’e ‘snatch from one another’ . This form seems to be now rather quite unproductive in Mantauran.

7.2.6.2 ma(a)- (~pa(a)-) + dynamic verbs The prefixes maa-(~paa-) and ma-(~pa-) attach to dynamic verbs. maa- always prefixes to
non-reduplicated verb roots while ma- only appears on reduplicated verbs roots.

With kin terms, a reciprocal/converse relationship can be expressed through the prefixation of ma’a- or la-ma’a- to the base. Note that ma’a- is the same prefix that occurs on stative verbs but ka- never appears on nouns. As mentioned in section 6.1.6, prefixed by ma’a- (or by pa’a- in its non-finite form), a noun can function as predicate. This predicate can occur in sentence-initial position as the main verb, or embedded to another verb. Marked by la-ma’a- or pa’a- (the sequence pa’a-+bound kin root must be followed by a genitive pronoun), the derived reciprocal noun can only function as an argument.

7.2.6.4 ma’a-pa- (~pa’a-pa-) + dynamic verbs The fourth reciprocal prefix, ma’a-pa- (~pa’a-pa-) represents the combination of the stative

For reasons unknown, ma’a- is followed by po- rather than pa- in ma’a-po-soalopo/*ma’a-pa-soalopo ‘offer a tribute to each other’ (< so- ‘offer tribute to a chief’, alopo ‘hunt’).

7.3 Imperative

The imperative is used to express a command, whereby the hearer is asked or required to do something. It is usually expressed through the suffixation of -a to the verb base, in Mantauran as in

134 As shown in Zeitoun (2002) and Teng (Forthcoming), this construction also occurs in Paiwan and in Puyuma.

404

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

the other Rukai dialects (cf. Li 1973 and 1997). Besides a discussion on this imperative form, the present section also briefly introduces “polite” or “mild requests” (as opposed to “strong” requests), exhortatives, and negative imperatives.
7.3.1 The imperative suffix -a

The imperative is marked through the prefixation of a- to the base, the verb occurring in its subjunctive form (cf. § 7.1.1.3 and 71.3).135 The subject (referring to a second person singular or plural) is zero-marked.

d. Ø-omikace ‘open one’s eyes’ omikac-a!

‘Open your eyes!’

Li (1973:218) claims that in Tanan, “imperatives occur only with nonstative verbs”. This statement does not hold in Mantauran Rukai, as shown in the following paradigm.

(7.103) (Affirmative) Imperative stative verbs ma-raveravere ‘happy’ ma-rimoro ‘forget’ ma-lrakase ‘(be) lazy, dislike’ ma-’amadhe ‘dislike, hate’ ma-dhalame ‘like, love’

ma-raveraver-a! ‘Be happy!’ ma-rimor-a! ‘Forget (it)!’ ma-lrakas-a! ‘Dislike (it/him/her)!’ ma-’amadh-a! ‘Hate (it/him/her)!’ ma-dhalam-a! ‘Like/love (it/him/her)!’

135 Though the terminology differs, Li (1973:218) notes also that “there is a close connection between infinitives and imperatives in many languages, and Rukai is but one of many languages that manifest such a phenomenon.”

405

Elizabeth Zeitoun

Nonetheless, some verbs need to be first dynamicized (through the prefixation of to- to the base) or causativized (usually through the prefixation of pa-) to occur in the imperative:

(7.104) a. to-dhao-a! produce-many-Imp ‘Make more!’

vs. ma-dhao-a! Stat.Subj-many-Imp ‘More!’

b. pa-ka-ke’eceng-a! produce-many-Imp ‘Make (it) strong!’

vs. ma-ke’eceng-a! Stat.Subj-strong-Imp ‘Be strong!’

c. pa-ka-ea-a-iae

kamosia!

Caus-Stat.NFin-one-Imp-1S.Obl sweet

‘Give me one sweet!’

When two verbs occur in a sequential order, the first takes the imperative suffix and the second is marked as subjunctive. The only exception to this rule is the occurrence of imia ‘come’ that requires the second verb to occur also in the imperative form. Compare:

(7.105) a. m-o-a Dyn.Subj-go-Imp ‘Go eat!’

kone! Dyn.Subj:eat

b. imia come:Imp ‘Come (to) eat!’

kon-a! Dyn.Subj:eat-Imp

b’.*imia come:Imp ‘Come (to) eat!’

kone! Dyn.Subj:eat

7.3.2 “Mild” vs. “strong” requests

A “mild” request is expressed through the occurrence of -nga on the verb marked as imperative.

406

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

(7.106) a. o-kane

‘eat’

maava’i

‘come’

maavanao ‘bathe’

b. ma-raveravere ‘happy’

kon-a-nga! maava’i-a-nga! maavanalr-a-nga! ma-raveraver-a-nga!

‘Eat, please!’ ‘Come, please!’ ‘Bathe, please!’ ‘Be happy, please!’

A “strong” request is express through the occurrence of the modal kai ‘may, must, should’ preceding the verb marked as imperative.

(7.107) a. o-kane maava’i maavanao

‘eat’ ‘come’ ‘bathe’

kai kon-a! kai maava’i-a! kai maavanalr-a!

‘(You should) eat!’ ‘(You should) come!’ ‘(You should) bathe!’

b. ma-raveravere ‘happy’ kai ma-raveraver-a! ‘(You should) be happy!’

7.3.3 Hortative

The hortative does not require the verb to occur in the imperative. It is expressed through the occurrence of ita ‘1PI.Top’ followed by a non-finite verb or ta- being prefix on the verb base.

(7.108) a. o-kane om-oa maavanao

‘eat’ ‘go’ ‘bathe’

ita kane/ta-kane! ita oa/ta-oa! ita paavanao/ta-paavanao!

‘Let’s eat!’ ‘Let’s go!’ ‘Let’s bathe!’

b. ma-raveravere ‘happy’ ita ka-raveravere/ta-ka-raveravere! ‘Let’s be happy!’

7.3.4 Negative imperative

Negative imperative is rendered through the nominalization of the verb: a-…-ae attaches to dynamic verb roots, and …-ae to stative verb stems (as well as denominal verbs and causativized verbs). The marking of the second person (singular or plural) is compulsory.

(7.109) Negative imperative dynamic verbs

7.4 Modal and aspectual system
Tense is traditionally defined as a deictic category, in that it grammaticalizes the temporal relationsip between the time at which an event (E) takes place and speech time (ST) or any other reference time (RT) (see Comrie 1986, and Chung and Timberlake 1985). Languages may exhibit a tripartite tense system in which past contrasts with present and future, or a bipartite system in which future is distinguished from non-future. As pointed out by Chung and Timberlake (1985:206), “the different temporal locations of an event – past, present, and future – are inherently correlated with difference in mood and aspect. An event that will occur after the speech moment is nonfactual and potential. Hence there is a correlation between future tense and nonfactual potential modd and, by implication, between non-future tense and actual mood.”
I believe that Mantauran has not grammaticalized the notion of tense. Like most other Formosan languages (see Zeitoun et al. 1996), it exhibits a basic distinction between realis and

408

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

irrealis. Past/present (i.e., realis) and irrealis interpretations are expressed through morphological or lexical means, i.e., they usually depend on the occurrence of (i) an aspectual (realis) or modal (irrealis) affix or (ii) a temporal adjunct (realis/irrealis).
7.4.1 Marking of realis and its interaction with aspect

As mentioned above, there is no overt distinction of past vs. present. Thus, a verb marked by o- (om-, m-, Ø-), ’i- or ma- refers to a past or present situation if the temporal frame of an utterance is left undetermined.

(7.112) a. o-kelrakelrange-lra-ine Dyn.Fin-beat-1S.Nom-3S.Obl ‘I beat (pres./past) your child.’

ana lalake-’o. that child-2S.Gen

b. maavanao-lrao. Dyn.Fin-bathe-1S.Nom ‘I bathe(d).’

c. ’i-ange’ange-lrao. Pass-Dyn.NFin:hurt-1S.Nom ‘I am/was hurt.’

d. malavahe-lra-imia’e. Stat.Fin-envy-1S.Nom-2S.Obl ‘I envy you.’

The temporal frame of a clause/sentence can be marked on the morphological level or the lexical level.
Morphologically, the prefix -nga ‘already’ serves to mark the perfective, as opposed to -na ‘still’ that indicates imperfectivity:

(7.113) a. o-kelrakelrange-nga-lra-ine

ana lalake-’o.

Dyn.Fin-beat-already-1S.Nom-3S.Obl that child-2S.Gen

‘I have beaten your child.’

b. maavanao-nga-lrao. Dyn.Fin:bathe-already-1S.Nom ‘I have bathed already.’

409

Elizabeth Zeitoun

c. ’i-ange’ange-nga-lrao. Pass-Dyn.NFin:hurt-already-1S.Nom ‘I have been hurt.’

d. ma-lavahe-nga-lra-imia’e. Stat.Fin-envy-already-1S.Nom-2S.Obl ‘I have envied you.’

(7.114) a. o-kelrakelrange-na-lra-ine Dyn.Fin-beat-still-1S.Nom-3S.Obl ‘I am still beating your child.’

ana lalake-’o. that child-2S.Gen

b. maavanao-na-lrao. Dyn.Fin-bathe-still-1S.Nom ‘I am still bathing.’

c. ’i-ange’ange-na-lrao. Pass-Dyn.NFin:hurt-still-1S.Nom ‘I am still hurt.’

d. malavahe-na-lra-imia’e. Stat.Fin-envy-still-1S.Nom-2S.Obl ‘I still envy you.’

Completion can also be marked by the prefix maka- ‘finish’ or the occurrence of a subordinate when-clause:

(7.115) a. maka-kane Dyn.Fin:finish-Dyn.NFin:eat ‘Taotao has finished eating.’

taotao. Taotao

b. a-paavanao-li,

o-’apece-lrao.

ClsNmz-Dyn.NFin:bathe-1S.Gen Dyn.Fin-sleep-1S.Nom

‘When I had bathed, I (went to) sleep.’

On the lexical level, it can be rendered by o-lepenge ‘finish’:

410

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

(7.116) a. o-lrepenge kone Dyn.Fin-finish Dyn.Subj:eat ‘Taotao has finished eating.’

taotao. Taotao

An imperfective interpretation – reference to the past or the present depends entirely on the context – can be rendered through the prefixation of naa- or kama-/kapa- ‘continuously’ or by the reduplication of the verb stem (repetitive/habitual or continuous/progressive action136):

(7.117) a. naa-kane-ni

taotao.

7.4.2 Marking of irrealis

As mentioned above, the marking of irrealis can be marked on the morphological level through affixation, or on the lexical level through the occurrence of temporal adjuncts or conditional and counterfactual clauses that frame a situation as unrealized.
The “future” is marked through the prefixation of amo- ‘will’ to the verb root/stem:

(7.120) a. lo ki-sialalra-ni,

amo-kelrakelrange-lra-ine

The prefixation of ni- to the verb – ni- attaches to any type of verb, i.e., dynamic/stative, active/passive verb – yields a counterfactual meaning.

7.4.3 Summary
It has been shown that Mantauran (as many other Formosan languages) makes a distinction between realis and irrealis. In the realis, there is no overt distinction between past and present, but the temporal frame of a clause/sentence can be marked through morphological or lexical means. In the realis, mood closely interacts with aspect. In the irrealis, there is a distinction between an event that will happen in the future, and one that should have happened but did not take place.
7.5 Negation
There are four different types of negators in Mantauran: (i) -ka negates an event or a situation (predicative negation), ki- has to do with modality (modal negation), (iii) a-…-ae forms the imperative negation and o-kaodho negates the existence of a referent (existential negation).
-ka attaches to any type of verb (including nominal predicates) – the verb is usually in its finite form, unless it appears with affixes – and must be followed by a genitive pronoun.137 To negate a clause, -ka is usually cross-referenced by another negator ka that occur before or after the negated verb (and usually before nominal arguments)138. I follow Yeh et al.’s (1998) analysis in

137 In very few examples, the negator -ka is followed by an oblique pronoun, as in:

(i) omiki-ka-imia’e

lalake valrovalro?

exist-Neg-2S.Obl

child

young woman

‘Do you have (grown up) daughter(s)?’

(ii) m-okela-ka-ine

ka dhamare-ni to-alake

Dyn.Fin-reach-Neg-3S.Obl Neg month-3S.Gen produce-child

pa-kovokovo-ng-ine.

Caus-Dyn.NFin:incubate-already-3S.Obl

‘The child was born premature so he was put in an incubator.’

138 Compare the grammality of the following two examples:

(i) ma-dhalame-ka-li

ka kone

Stat.Fin-like/love-Neg-1S.Gen Neg Dyn.Subj:eat

‘I do not like eating bananas.’

positing that this second ka constitutes part of the negation. The main reason for such a claim is
that if the sequence V-ka-ProGen is not preceded or followed by ka, the utterance is understood as interrogative,139 not declarative. Compare the following pairs of examples:

(7.128) a. o-’enao-ka-’o

c’. ma-dhalame-ka-li Stat.Fin-like/love-Neg-1S.Gen ‘I do not like to eat bananas.’

ka kone Neg Dyn.Subj:eat

velevele? banana

139 In interrogative sentences, if -ka is preposed in initial position, the occurrence of a second ka before the

predicate is compulsory:

(i) i-ka-’o

ka kane-nga

velevele-’o?

‘Are you Mantauran? No, I am not.’

ki- attaches to the verb root and the sequence ki-V is usually followed by a nominative pronoun (unless it is part of an interrogative, conditional or nominalized clause). ki- usually expresses deontic modality.

The circumfix (a-)…-ae forms negative imperative verbs. The circumfixed verb must be followed by a 2nd person genitive pronoun, -’o ‘2S.Gen’ or -nomi ‘2P.Gen’. A short paradigm was

7.6 Plurality and pluractionality
I make a distinction between ‘plurality’ and pluractionality140 despite their morphological overlap. The former refers to (i) the plural marking on a nominal argument, and (ii) number agreement on stative verbs, i.e., stative verbs – whether or not denominal verbs – must agree with their subjects in number. The latter is used to refer to a ‘multiplicity’ or ‘plurality’ of participants. Both dynamic and stative verbs can be marked for pluractionality. I have accounted for the marking of plurality on common and non-common nouns in section 6.1.4. In this section, I will focus on the distinction between the marking of plurality on verbs and that of pluractionality.
Plurality on denominal verbs co-indexing with a common noun referring human participant is expressed through the prefixation of a- to the base. Plural marking is compulsory (for details, see section 8.1).

(7.135) a. ilrae

’a valrovalro-lrao.

1S.Top Top young woman-1S.Nom

‘As for me, I am a young woman.’

b. iname ’a a-valrovalro-nai/*valrovalro-nai. 1PE.Top Top plur-young woman-1PE.Nom ‘As for us, we are young women.’

140 This term is taken from Newman (1990) though he uses it in a different manner to refer to the “plurality or multiplicity of the verb’s action” (pp. 53-54).

that

Cls-Stat.NFin-plur-young woman-1PE.Gen

‘When we were young women....’

Plurality on stative verbs referring to a non-human referent is expressed through the reduplication of the base. Plural marking is here again obligatory.

(7.137) a. ma-voti’i

dhona

Stat.Fin-blind that

‘That cat is blind.’

dhona

Stat.Fin-Red-blind/Stat.Fin-blind that

‘All the cats are blind.’

kapa-ngiao-nga. all-cat-Sup

Pluractionality can be expressed through the same devices, that is: (i) the prefixation of a- on a stative verb or a denominal verb referring to a common human participant; in that case, the occurrence of a- on the verb quantifies the subject (cf. also § 7.2.10.2).

A few notes are in order: 1) Both dynamic and stative verbs can be reduplicated, but the reduplication of the base yields a repetitive/continuous or intensifying meaning, e.g., makini-kana-kan-ae ‘they all keep on eating’, makini-ka-takolra-kolr-ae ‘they are all very bad’. 2) Denominal verbs must be marked for plurality if circumfixed by makini-…-ae ‘all’, thus *makini-ka-savar-ae (in opposition to makini-ka-a-sava-savar-ae) is ungrammatical. 3) Stative verbs (including denominal verbs) marked by makini-…-ae are equivalent to those prefixed by ma-a- ‘Stat-plur’.

7.8.2 Comparatives

There are at least three types of comparatives in Mantauran: ‘more than (before)’, ‘more and more’, ‘more than (Y)’, which are realized differently on the morpho-syntactic level.

7.8.2.1 ‘more than (before)’ The first type of comparatives refer to one (and only one) referent with respect to what used to be,
e.g., ‘She feels better (than before)’, ‘It is whiter (than before)’ and is expressed by the prefixation of ’ako-…-nga141 to the verb, for instance:

(7.158) a. ’ako-ka-taadhi’i-nga

dhipolo.

more-Stat.NFin-good-Sup

Dhipolo

i. ‘Dhipolo is better than before.’ (implied, ‘she is recovering from illness’)

ii. ‘Dhipolo is more beautiful than before.’

b. ’ako-ka-takolra-nga

takanao.

more-Stat.NFin-bad-Sup

Takanao

‘Takanao is worse than before.’

141 ’ako- exhibits an homophonous morpheme that means ‘barely’: (i) a. ’ako-kane-lrao. barely-Dyn.NFin:eat-1S.Nom ‘I barely eat.’
≅ b. ma’ati-kane-lrao. a little-Dyn.NFin:eat-1S.Nom ‘I eat a little.’

7.8.2.2 ‘more and more’ The second construction refers to a situation where something happens ‘more and more’, e.g., ‘She
is more and more beautiful’, ‘It is more and more white’. It is marked by the circumfixation of the complex affix k<in>a-…-ae to the verb, e.g.,

7.8.3 Superlatives

Superlatives are expressed by the addition of the suffix -nga to the verb, which may or not undergo reduplication:

b. ma-lrii-lrihili-nga-lrao. Stat.Fin-Red-clever-Sup-1S.Nom ‘I am the cleverest.’

b. o-lrihi-lriho’o-nga-lrao. Dyn.Fin-Red:know-Sup-1S.Nom ‘I am the most intelligent’
In passing, let’s mention another prefix mati-, which, though it does not express the superlative, expresses that something or someone is “completely, well…”, for instance:
(7.170) a. mati-ka-lrihili-lrao. very-Stat.NFin-clever-1S.Nom ‘I am very clever.’

142 This example can also be interpreted as: ‘I know already.’

Chapter 8 Syntax of simple sentences

This chapter deals with the syntax of simple sentences. The structure of basic clauses is first investigated, with a distinction made between verbal vs. nominal sentences.

8.1 Basic clause structure
Mantauran patterns like most of the Formosan languages in that two kinds of clausal constructions must be distinguished: the first is verbal, the second is nominal. In both constructions, the predicate – either verbal or nominal – usually occurs clause-initially, i.e., it functions as the head of clause:

(8.1) a.

om-oa

tamatama

ketekete

Dyn.Fin-go middle-aged man Dyn.Subj:cut

‘The middle-aged man went to cut a flower.’

’aelrenge. flower

b. lalake-li

taotao.

child-1S.Gen Taotao

‘Taotao is my child.’

A comparison of (8.1a-b) and (8.2a-b) shows, however, that a noun phrase can only function as a predicate in a nominal/equational clause, whereas a verb phrase may constitute in itself a complete clause/sentence, i.e., there is no ‘dummy’ subject as in English and noun phrases are often deleted in topic chains (8.3).

(8.2) a.

(o-)ketekete-nga! (Dyn.Fin-)cut-already. ‘(I/you/(s)he cut (it)!’

b. lalake-li. child-1S.Gen ‘my child.’

439

Elizabeth Zeitoun

(8.3) mani oa-nga

cengele Ø mani polra

dhona’i

Dyn.NFin:go-already Dyn.Subj:see then

Dyn.Subj:touch that

lalake-li”

mani ia

tovi

Ø

Ouch Stat.Fin-die-already child-1S.Gen then Dyn.NFin:so Dyn.Subj:cry

mani dhaace

’ilap-idhe

dhona’i votolro’o-dha Ø.

then

Dyn.Fin:leave Dyn.Subj:look for-3S.Obl that

body-3S.Gen

‘Then they [father and son] went to see and they touched the game. It was cold. ‘Ouch!’ ‘My

child is dead’ he [the father] said crying and they left and they went to look for his body.’

Despite this difference, there is a considerable overlap in terms of structure between verbal and nominal clauses.

8.1.1 A comparison of verbal vs. nominal clauses/sentences

The morpho-syntactic distinctions between nouns and verbs were discussed in section 5.1. In this section, the similarities and dissimilarities between verbal and nominal clauses are reviewed.

8.1.1.1 Similarities between verbal and nominal clauses/sentences Similarities between verbal and nominal clauses include (i) the order of nominal/pronominal
arguments after and before the (verbal/nominal) predicate, (ii) the negation of verbal and nominal clauses and (iii) number agreement.

8.1.1.1.1 Remarks on word order 8.1.1.1.1.1 Order of full lexical NPs in post-verbal position
The order of full lexical NPs is free in post-verbal position:

(8.4) a.

o-kane

velevele tamatama.

Dyn.Fin-eat banana middle-aged man

‘The middle-aged man is eating/ate a banana.’

b. o-kane

tamatama

velevele.

Dyn.Fin-eat middle-aged man banana

‘The middle-aged man is eating/ate a banana.’

440

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

though (8.4a) can be uttered as an answer to (8.5). This indicates that in terms of discourse, the NP which occurs in sentence-final position is topical and that the relative position of lexical arguments is largely determined by pragmatic factors.

(8.5) kana-ni

pi’a-ni

tamatama?

what-3S.Gen Dyn.NFin:do-3S.Gen middle-aged man

‘What is/was the middle-aged man doing?’

Nominal clauses are usually composed of two nouns/noun phrases, e.g.:

(8.6) a.

dhipolo

ana.

Dhipolo

that

‘That/she is Dhipolo.’

b. vanidho

lalake-ni.

student

child-3S.Gen

‘His/her child is a student.’

Word order is also free after the nominal predicate. Compare:

(8.7) a.

ana’i a-lraikis-ae-ni

ka’ange taotao.

that

ObjNmz-Dyn.NFin:fishhook-LocNmz fish

Taotao

‘That is the fish that Taotao fished.’

= b.

ana’i a-lraikis-ae-ni

taotao

that

ObjNmz-Dyn.NFin:fishhook-LocNmz Taotao

‘That is the fish that Taotao fished.’

ka’ange. fish

= c. ana’i taotao a-lraikis-ae-ni

ka’ange.

that

Taotao ObjNmz-Dyn.NFin:fishhook-LocNmz fish

‘That is the fish that Taotao fished.’

Of course, one major distinction between verbal and nominal clauses is that while the re-ordering of the verb and the nominal arguments in a verbal clause may lead to a less grammatical (or totally ungrammatical) sentence, the re-ordering of the noun phrases in a nominal clause does not affect its grammaticality or meaning.

8.1.1.1.1.2 Order of pronouns in post-verbal position The order of pronouns after a verbal or nominal predicate is fixed. In verbal sentences, the subject always precedes the non-subject. In terms of pronominal
coding, nominative or genitive pronouns always precede oblique pronouns. A pronoun is marked as nominative in affirmative sentences but as genitive in negative sentences.143 Nominative and genitive pronouns refer to (i) the agent/experiencer in active clauses and to (ii) the patient in passive clauses. Oblique pronouns refer to (i) the patient in active clauses and to (ii) the agent/experiencer in active clauses.

b. ’i-tipitipi-lra-imia’e. Pass-Dyn.NFin:beat-1S.Nom-2S.Obl ‘I am/was beaten by you.’

143 Thus nominative and genitive pronouns never co-occur simultaneously.

If a nominal sentence is composed of a noun and a (nominative) pronoun, the order is fixed: N(P)-ProNom. (8.10) a. ’elrenge-lrao.
Elrenge-1S.Nom ‘I am Elrenge.’
b. * lrao-’elrenge. 1S.Nom-Elrenge
If two pronouns co-occur, the genitive pronoun always precedes the oblique pronoun:
(8.11) a. lalake-l-imia’e. child-1S.Gen-2S.Obl ‘You are my child.’
a’. lalake-ka-l-imia’e. child-Neg-1S.Gen-2S.Obl ‘You are not my child.’
b. ina-’-iae. mother-2S.Gen-1S.Obl ‘I am your mother.’
b’. ina-ka-’-iae. mother-Neg-2S.Gen-1S.Obl ‘I am not your mother.’
8.1.1.1.1.3 Order of full lexical NPs in pre-verbal/topic position The occurrence of full lexical NPs in clause-initial position is more restricted. As in the other
Rukai dialects, e.g., Tanan (Li, 1973:71), only the agent or more specifically the subject of the clause – usually followed by the topic marker ’a – can be raised in initial position. Thus, while (8.12a) is a well-formed sentence, (8.12b) is semantically anomalous.

In a nominal clause, the main distinction between the NP occurring after or before the nominal predicate resides in the use of ’i and ’a: ’i precedes post-nominal predicate NPs, while ’a follows pre-nominal predicate NPs functioning as topics. Their occurrence in a sentence is not obligatory, sometimes blurring the distinction between the nominal predicate and the subject.

8.1.1.1.1.4 Order of pronouns in pre-verbal/topic position Only topic pronouns can occur in clause-initial position, no matter whether the clause is
nominal or verbal. Topic pronouns145 are usually cross-referenced on the verb with a nominative

145 In Maga Rukai, a prefix i- (Maga) occurs before personal and demonstrative pronouns as well as before

case markers. The prefix i- is found on Mantauran personal pronouns, as the above examples demonstrate but

cannot appear before demonstrative or nouns. Compare the grammaticality of the following examples:

8.1.1.1.1.5 Summary To summarize briefly, in both types of clauses (i.e., verbal vs. nominal clauses), the verb or
the nominal predicate functions as the head of the clause. Word order is rather similar in these two types of clauses, with nominal arguments occurring generally after the verb/nominal predicate. The ordering of full lexical NPs is free; that of pronouns is fixed. Only agents (that is subjects) or definite objects can be preposed in initial position as topics. This can be schematically represented as follows:

(8.17) Nominal clause

A. Post-nominal predicate word order

a. N(P)Pred

(’i) N(P)

b. N(P)Pred-ProNom

or

(the occurrence of ’i is optional) N(P)Pred-ProGen-ProObl

B. Pre-nominal predicate word order

8.1.1.1.2 Predicative negation Huang (1995:162-163) shows that in Mayrinax Atayal, verbal and nominal clauses are

8.1.1.1.3 Subject-predicate agreement Subject-predicate agreement is found in both nominal and verbal clauses, though not all
nominal or verbal clauses allow overt verbal cross-referencing.147 Certain nominal and verbal predicates agree in plurality with their plural/quantified subject:

(8.22) a. ’avai-lrao. female-1S.Nom ‘I am a woman.’

a’. *a’ivivai-lrao. plur:Red:female-1S.Nom

b. a’ivivai-nai. plur:Red:female-1PE.Nom ‘We are women.’

b’.* ’avai-nai. female-1PE.Nom

147 Number agreement (of nominative arguments) is found in other Formosan languages, e.g., Tsou and

Paiwan (see Tang 2004), but is always triggered by the occurrence of a “human” participant. Number

agreement can be marked on the verb or on the noun (phrase). It is marked on the verb and the noun in

Mantauran, but only on the noun in Tsou, where the occurrence of a (numeral/non-numeral) quantifier

induces a plural subject:

(i) Tsou

a. mo

tuyo ’o ’o-’oko-si/*oko-si.

AF.Real three Nom Red-child-3S.Gen/child-3S.Gen

‘He had three children.’ (Zeitoun, 2000a:242)

b. mo

tuyo ’e kuyai.

AF.Real three Nom car

‘We have three cars.’ (Chang, 2001:6)

Kroeger (1993:24) mentions that “Tagalog verbs and adjectival predicates may optionally be marked

for plural number when the nominative argument of the clause is plural.” Most of the examples he proposes

also refer to a human participant.

8.1.1.2 Dissimilarities between verbal and nominal clauses/sentences Dissimilarities between verbal and nominal clauses include (i) the modification by toramoro
of verbs (but not of nominal predicates), (ii) the negation of verbs (but not of nouns) by the modal negator ki-. These two criteria were proposed as tests to contrast verbs and nouns in section 5.1.1. They can also be used to show that verbal clauses differ from nominal clauses.

450

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

toramoro can occur before – it is followed by the ligature ka – or after verb (no ligature between the verb and toramoro) but cannot can neither precedes or follow a nominal predicate.

8.1.2 Verbal clause types

Verbal clauses can be divided into: (i) ambient clauses, (ii) intransitive clauses, (iii) transitive clauses and (iv) ditransitive clauses. The distinction between intransitive and transitive or ditransitive clause is usually unmarked on the morphological level on the verb, although the cross-referencing of oblique arguments on the verb may increase transitivity (cf. § 8.4).

Gerundive constructions (discussed in section 6.3.2) are very similar in terms of structure from verbal clauses. The main distinction resides in the occurrence of a nominative argument in (affirmative) verbal clauses and that of a genitive argument in gerundive clauses.

8.1.3 Nominal clause types

There is no copula in Mantauran, and thus nominal clauses are formed through the juxtaposition of two NPs. The predicate noun might be a typically bare noun – the clause can be defined as “classificational”) or be preceded by a demonstrative and form a noun phrase, in which case the clause is “identificational” (cf. Wang 2004, Reid and Liao 2004).

8.2 Structure of the verb phrase
This section deals the structure of the verb phrase. A verb can be followed by two pronouns at most, the first is always in the nominative or genitive and the second always in the oblique. A reverse order is impossible:
(8.36) a. ma-’amadhe-lra-imia’e. Stat.Fin-dislike-1S.Nom-2S.Obl ‘I dislike you.’
a’.* ma-’amadhe-imia’e-lrao. Stat.Fin-dislike-2S.Obl-1S.Nom
b. ma-’amadhe-ka-l-imia’e. Stat.Fin-dislike-1S.Gen-2S.Obl ‘I dislike you.’
b’.* ma-’amadhe-ka-imia’e-li. Stat.Fin-dislike-2S.Obl-1S.Gen
Within the verb, -na ‘still’ and -nga ‘already’ always precede pronouns and/or the negator -ka and attach immediately the verb:
(8.37) a. o-kane-nga-lrao. Dyn.Fin-eat-already-1S.Nom ‘I have already eaten.’
a’. *o-kane-lrao-nga. Dyn.Fin-eat-1S.Nom-already
b. o-kane-na-ka-li. Dyn.Fin-eat-still-Neg-1S.Gen ‘I have not eaten yet.’

454

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

b’. *o-kane-ka-na-li. Dyn.Fin-eat-Neg-still -1S.Gen

Different prefixes can precede a verb, but some occur nearest to the root than others, e.g., the stative (non-finite) prefix ka-, cf. pa-ka-V ‘Caus-Stat.NFin’ (and not *ka-pa-V), ma’a-ka-V ‘Rec-Stat.NFin’ (and not *ka-ma’a-V), ki-ka-V ‘Neg-Stat.NFin’ (and not *ka-ki-V) etc…

8.3 Structure of the noun phrase

This section examines in more detail the structure of the noun phrase in Mantauran. Simple noun phrases are composed of a head noun (derived or underived) and a demonstrative. The demonstrative always precedes the head noun.

(8.38) a. dhona’i lroolai

that

child

‘that child’

b. ana

mairange

that

sweet potato

‘that/those sweet potatoes’

c. ’ina’i ta-sola-solat-ae

that

LocNmz-Red-Dyn.NFin:study-LocNmz

‘this school’

Two (pro)nouns with the same referent may occur side by side, whereby none is the modifier of the other:

(8.39) a.

[iname a’ivivai]

o-dholro-ka-nai

ka m-oa

1PE.Top plur:Red:female Dyn.Fin-can-Neg-1PE.Gen Neg Dyn.Subj-go

sakovo.

men’s house

‘As for us girls, we could not go to the men’s house.’

b. [inome ’oponoho] ma-dhao

pelehe’e-nomi.

2PE.Top Mantauran Stat.Fin-many taboo-2P.Gen

‘As for you Mantauran, you have many taboos.’

4 55

Elizabeth Zeitoun

c. ma-kocingai [’oponoho vaha]. Stat.Fin-difficult Mantauran language ‘The Mantauran language is difficult.’

More complex noun phrases may include modifying elements or constitute compounds. Two nominal complements can be distinguished: the first is verbal, and the second is nominal. Verbal modifiers (no matter whether verbs are dynamic verbs, stative verbs or numerals) are actually nominalized constituents,148 e.g.:

(8.40) a.

ma-’amadhe-lra-ine

[dhona’i

Stat.Fin-dislike-1S.Nom-3S.Obl that

ta’olro]M lroolaiH.]

dog

child

‘I dislike the child that beat the dog.’

[ta-kelrakelrange SubjNmz-Dyn.NFin:beat

b. o-kane-nga-nai

Dyn.Fin-eat-already-1PE.Nom

[ana

[a-amec-ae-nomi]M

mairangeH.]

that

ObjNmz-Dyn.NFin:bring-ObjNmz-2P.Gen sweet potato

‘We have already eaten the sweet potatoes you brought.’

c. ma-’adhaili [’ina’i ta-oa-(a)e-nai]M

Stat.Fin-far this

LocNmz-Dyn.NFin:go-LocNmz-1PE.Gen

ta-sola-solat-aeH.] LocNmz-Red-Dyn.NFin:study-LocNmz

‘The school where we go is far.’

The word order within the noun phrase is relatively free, as the following pair of examples illustrate:

(8.41) a.

[...’ina’i [ta-ovalrisi-nga]H

a-olrolaiH] ka

this

SubjNmz-Dyn.NFin:change-Sup plur-child

Neg

o-lriho’o-ka-i

ka ’oponoho vaha.

Dyn.Fin-know-Neg-3S.Gen Neg Mantauran language

‘…as for the young generation of children, they do not know (to speak) the Mantauran

language.’

148 I have found no criteria to distinguish nominalization from relativization, and believe that relativization is inexistent in Mantauran Rukai.

456

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

b. ceela [’ina’i look:Imp this

la-a-lake-naiH

[ta-ovalrisi-nga]M...]

child-Red-child-1PE.Gen SubjNmz-Dyn.NFin:change-Sup

‘Look at the young generation of children…’

Nominal complements are usually composed of a possessor modifying a noun (phrase). As Mantauran is a head-marking language – syntactic relations are marked on the modifiee – a genitive pronoun is attached on the head noun.

(8.42) a. talropongo-ni dhipolo hat-3S.Gen Dhipolo ‘Dhipolo’s hat’

b. la-a-lake-lini

taotao

child-plur-child-3P.Gen Taotao

‘the children of Taotao and Elrenge’

la ’elrenge and Elrenge

c. ’oponoho

vaha-nai

Mantauran language-1PE.Gen

‘Our Mantauran language’

d. vila’a-ni

dha’ane

beside-3S.Gen house

‘beside the house’

e. ta-ve’ek-ae LocNmz-pig-LocNmz ‘inside the pigpen’

’adhingi-ni inside-3S.Gen

Verbal and nominal complements can co-occur within the same noun phrase:

(8.43)

dhona’i ta-ka-dho’a

a-’ilap-ae-ni

that

SubjNmz-Stat.NFin-two ObjNmz-Dyn.NFin:look for-ObjNmz-3S.Gen

ta’olro-ni

dhipolo

dog-3S.Gen Dhipolo

‘those two small dogs that Dhipolo looked for’

Compounds, which are introduced in section 3.2.3, also form complex NPs.

4 57

Elizabeth Zeitoun

(8.44) a. ovale kipingi body hair clothes ‘pullover’

b. vanidho kipingi student clothes ‘uniform’

Compounds and nominal complements are rather difficult to distinguish. In both constructions, the ordering of the two nouns can be inverted. The only test that seems to distinguish compounding from nominal complementation is the occurrence of a genitive pronoun on the head noun which co-refers with the possessor in nominal complements:

(8.45) a. taotao Taotao ‘Taotao’s clothes’

kipingi-ni clothes-3S.Gen

= b. kipingi-ni

taotao

clothes-3S.Gen Taotao

‘Taotao’s clothes’

c. ovale body hair ‘pull over’

kipingi clothes

= d. kipingi clothes ‘pullover’

ovale body hair

(8.46) a. ana

ka-oca-(a)e

that

genuine-person-genuine

‘the clothes of that aborigine’

kipingi-ni clothes-3S.Gen

≠ b. ana

ka-oca-(a)e

‘that/those traditional clothes’

8.4 Coding of grammatical relations
In this section, the coding and behavioral properties of subjects and objects in active (cf. § 8.4.1) and passive (cf. § 8.4.2) sentences are examined in more details. In section 8.4.3, I show that Mantauran is an accusative language and discuss the viability of the notion of “subject” in this dialect. Section 8.4.4 deals with instances of “split intransitivity”.
8.4.1 Coding and behavioral properties of subjects and objects in active sentences

8.4.1.1 Covert/overt morphological marking of subjects and objects Full lexical nouns in subject position are unmarked for case in Mantauran, no matter whether
they refer to a human or non-human participant.

(8.48) a.

o-cengele

ta-ka-dho’a

ta-ka-’ete

Dyn.Fin-see SubjNmz-Stat.Fin-two SubjNmz-Stat.NFin-dead

ana tamatama.

that middle-aged man

‘The middle-aged man saw two dead dogs.’

ta’olro dog

b. o-langai-nga

taotao

Dyn.Fin-buy-already Taotao

‘Taotao has bought a house.’

dha’ane. house

c. o-ka’ace

ta’olro ’olra’a.

Dyn.Fin-bite dog

snake

i. ‘The dog bit(es) the snake.’

ii. ‘The snake bit(es) the dog.’

459

Elizabeth Zeitoun

As shown in (8.48c), an ambiguous interpretation may result if two potential agents occur in postverbal position. This ambiguity is raised if (i) the agent is preceded by ’i or if (ii) it occurs in pre-verbal position as a topic.

(8.49) a.

o-ka’ace

’i ta’olro

Dyn.Fin-bite

dog

i. ‘The dog bit(es) the snake.’

ii. *‘The snake bit(es) the dog.’

’olra’a. snake

a’. o-ka’ace

ta’olro ’i

Dyn.Fin-bite dog

i. *‘The dog bit(es) the snake.’

ii. ‘The snake bit(es) the dog.’

’olra’a. snake

b. (dhona) ta’olro ’a o-ka’ace

(that) dog

Top Dyn.Fin-bite

‘As for that dog, it bit(es) the snake.’

’olra’a. snake

b’. (dhona) ’olra’a o-ka’ace

ta’olro.

(that) snake Dyn.Fin-bite dog

‘As for that snake, it bit(es) the dog.’

While non-human objects are also unmarked (see the examples given above), human objects are marked through the cliticization of -ine on the noun or on the verb.

(8.50) a. o-langai-nga

dha’ane taotao-ine.

Dyn.Fin-buy-already

house Taotao-Obl

‘Someone bought a house for Taotao.’

b. o-langai-ng-ine

dha’ane taotao.

Dyn.Fin-buy-already-3S.Obl house Taotao

‘Someone bought a house for Taotao.’

A few notes are in order. 1) the marking of human objects cannot simultaneously occur on the noun and on the verb:

(8.50) c. * o-langai-ng-ine Dyn.Fin-buy-already-3S.Obl

dha’ane taotao-ine. house Taotao-Obl

460

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

2) in a serial verb construction, verbal marking occurs once (on either verb) but not simultaneously on each verb:

(8.51) a. dhipolo ’a pasopalr-ine ’ilape

apoto

Dhipolo Top help-3S.Obl Dyn.Subj:look for stone

‘As for Dhipolo, she helped Taotao looking for (the) stones.’

taotao. Taotao

b. dhipolo ’a pasopalra

’ilap-ine

apoto

Dhipolo Top help

Dyn.Subj:look for-3S.Obl stone

‘As for Dhipolo, she helped Taotao looking for (the) stones.’

taotao. Taotao

c. * dhipolo ’a pasopalr-ine ’ilap-ine

apoto

Dhipolo Top help-3S.Obl Dyn.Subj:look for-3S.Obl stone

taotao. Taotao

3) the marking of oblique arguments is sensitive to the categorical nature of the “object”: it is obligatory if the object NP refers to a human but optional if only indirectly related to a human.

(8.52) a. takanao ’a o-tipitip-ine

taotao.

Takanao Top Dyn.Fin-beat-3S.Obl Taotao

‘As for Takanao, he beat(s) Taotao.’

b. * takanao ’a o-tipitipi-Ø Takanao Top Dyn.Fin-beat-Ø ‘As for Takanao, he beat(s) Taotao.’

taotao. Taotao

(8.53) a. dhona’i ’aolai ’a (o-)’ilape-Ø

apoto-ni.

that

male Top Dyn.Fin-look for-Ø stone-3S.Gen

‘As for that boy, he is looking for his stones.’

b. dhona’i ’aolai ’a (o-)’ilap-ine

that

male Top Dyn.Fin-look for-3S.Obl

‘As for that boy, he is looking for his stones.’

apoto-ni.149 stone-3S.Gen

4) the marking/non-marking of the oblique argument on the verb might result in different interpretations:
149 Some younger informants (e.g., Lan Gui-ying) found this sentence ungrammatical, but it was accepted by the late Lü Yu-zhi.

4 61

Elizabeth Zeitoun

(8.54) a. o-kane-nga-Ø

tamatama

Dyn.Fin-eat-already

middle-aged man

‘The middle-aged man ate a/his banana.’

velevele/velevele-ni. banana/banana-3S.Gen

b. * o-kane-ng-ine

*‘The banana ate the middle-aged man.’

velevele. banana

tamatama

Dyn.Fin-eat-already-3S.Obl middle-aged man

‘Someone ate the banana of the middle-aged man.’

velevele-ni. banana-3S.Gen

5) if two potential agents occur in the sentence, the utterance will be interpreted ambiguously if the clitic -ine occurs on the verb, because the marking of the object on the verb is not cross-referenced on the noun. No such ambiguity arises if the clitic -ine occurs on the noun, as only non-subjects/oblique arguments are marked.

(8.55) a.

ma-dhalam-ine Stat.Fin-like/love-3S.Obl i. ‘Taotao likes/loves Dhipolo.’ ii. ‘Dhipolo likes/loves Taotao.’

taotao Taotao

‘Dhipolo likes/loves Taotao.’

ii. *‘Taotao likes/loves Dhipolo.’

dhipolo. Dhipolo

As in the case of subjects, if the clitic -ine occurs on the verb and the potential agent is preceded by ’i or occurs in initial position, no such ambiguity arises:

462

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

b’. dhipolo ’a ma-dhalam-inej Dhipolo Top Stat.Fin-like/love-3S.Obl ‘Dhipolo likes/loves Taotao.’

taotaoj. Taotao

6) the cliticization of -ine on the noun is rare and subject to various restrictions that are enumerated below:
(i) If two nouns are coordinated, the clitic can only occur on the verb; it cannot appear on each noun, as in Tona Rukai, for instance:

(8.57) a. o-langai-ng-ilinej

dha’ane [taotao

Dyn.Fin-buy-already-3P.Obl house Taotao

‘Someone bought a house for Taotao and Dhipolo.’

la dhipolo]j. and Dhipolo

b. * o-langai-nga Dyn.Fin-buy-already-3P.Obl

dha’ane taotao-ine house Taotao-Obl

la dhipol-ine. and Dhipolo-Obl

(ii) If the noun is a complex NP, the clitic only occurs on the verb, not on the noun:

(8.58) a.

o-kane-ng-ine

(taotao [velevele-ni) tamatama].

Dyn.Fin-eat-already-3S.Obl Taotao banana-3S.Gen middle-aged man

i. ‘Taotao ate the banana of the middle-aged man.’

ii. ‘The middle-aged man ate Taotao’s banana.’

b. * o-kane-nga

[taotao-ine

Dyn.Fin-eat-already Taotao-Obl

velevele-ni] tamatama. banana-3S.Gen middle-aged man

c. * o-kane-nga

taotao [velevele-ni tamatama-ine].

Dyn.Fin-eat-already Taotao banana-3S.Gen middle-aged man-Obl

(iii) The clitic is invariable when it occurs on the noun. When it occurs on the verb, there is an agreement in visibility (cf. -ine vs. -idhe) and plurality (cf. -iline vs. -ilidhe) between the verb and the NP marked as oblique:

(8.59) a. ma-dhalame

taotao

Stat.Fin-like/love

Taotao

‘Taotao likes/loves Dhipolo.’

dhipol-ine. Dhipolo-Obl

b. * ma-dhalame Stat.Fin-like/love

taotao dhipol-idhe. Taotao Dhipolo-Obl

[taotao la takanao]i dhipoloj.

Stat.Fin-like/love-3S.Obl Taotao and Takanao Dhipolo

‘Taotao and Takanao like/love Dhipolo.’

6) the third person oblique pronouns -ine/-idhe/-iline/-ilidhe can occur on the first verb, even if they co-refer with an argument of the second clause (cf. § 9.1):

(8.62) o-lriho’o-lra-ine

m-okela-nga

Dyn.Fin-know-1S.Nom-3S.Obl Dyn.Subj-reach-already

‘I know that the woman has arrived.’

m-ia Dyn.Subj-so

ana ’avai. that woman

464

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

8.4.1.2 Syntactic functions, semantic roles and semantic properties Mantauran makes a distinction between dynamic and stative verbs. In active clauses, the
agent is always the subject of the clause if the verb is dynamic.150 If the verb is stative, the subject might be an agent or an experiencer:

(8.63) a. o-’ongolo

vavaa titina.

Dyn.Fin-drink wine

middle-aged woman

‘The middle-aged woman drinks/drank wine.’

b. ma-’amadh-ine

dhipolo titina.

Stat.Fin-dislike-3S.Obl Dhipolo middle-aged woman

‘The middle-aged woman dislikes Dhipolo.

150 Examples such as those proposed in Payne (1997:131), e.g., The key opened the door and The door opened, whereby the subject is either the instrument or the patient (as opposed to I opened the door with the key) are highly marked in Mantauran. Though they can be elicited, they are felt unnatural, if not ungrammatical:

(i) a. to’araki-lrao saosi

titina. middle-aged woman

There is an unrestricted neutralization in non-subject position: the non-subject is an oblique (core) argument. If the oblique NP refers to a human participant, it must be marked through the occurrence of an oblique pronoun on the verb, whatever the semantic role (patient, beneficiary, goal, locative) or the syntactic function (direct object, indirect object or oblique) of the NP.

In terms of semantic properties, subjects (of active sentences) are characterized not only by a higher degree of agency, but also of volitionality and control. Subjects of dynamic verbs are thus

466

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

[+agent, +volitional, +control]; subjects of stative verbs are marked as [±agent, ±volitional, ±control]. Oblique NPs, on the other hand, are neither agentive nor volitional and they do not have any control of the action being performed. They can be defined as [-agent, -volitional, -control]. This distinction is reflected in the following pair of examples:

(8.65) a. o-kane-nga-Ø

The above examples show that while there is no overt morphological distinction in Mantauran between intransitive and transitive clauses, syntactically, an intransitive verb can become transitive by means of the cliticization of a co-referential oblique pronoun on the verb.

8.4.1.3 Summary The behavioral properties of subjects and objects in Mantauran are summarized in a tabular
form:

8.4.2 In passive sentences

The passive voice exhibits a mirror image of the active voice with the functions of S and O reversed. The subject is the agent/controller in the active voice. It is the patient/non-controller in the passive voice. The same is true for the object, which becomes the agent of the sentence. What has been said in the above section about case marking, verbal agreement and word order remains true and unchanged:

8.4.3 Mantauran as an accusative language and the validity of the notion of subject While most Formosan languages have been characterized as being ergative languages (cf.
Starosta 1988, Huang 1993, Liao 2004, Wang, 2004, Ross and Teng 2005 among others) or exhibit split ergative characteristics (cf. Chang 1997, Liao 2002), Mantauran can be viewed as an accusative language, in that the single argument (S) of an intransitive sentence corresponds to the A(gent) of a transitive sentence.

(8.68) a. o-lralrame Dyn.Fin-run ‘That child runs/ran.’

ana lroolai. that child

b’. ma-dhalam-ine

taotao ’i dhipolo.

Stat.Fin-like/love-3S.Obl Taotao

‘Dhipolo likes/loves Taotao.’

Van Valin and LaPolla (1997) and Ross (2004b), among others, have shown that grammatical relations are not found universally and that they exist only in languages where “the behavioral patterns […] give evidence of a syntactic relation independent of semantic and pragmatic relations” (Van Valin and LaPolla, 1997:274).
A number of evidence show that subjects are not reducible to semantic roles and that the notion of subject is viable in Mantauran.
First, as shown above, usually only the subject can be raised in initial position.

(8.69)

ana lroolai o-kane

velevele.

that child Dyn.Fin-eat banana

‘As for that child, he eats/ate a banana.’

Second, there is a subject-verb agreement in number if the verb is a stative verb and the subject is quantified or in the plural form.

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

If there is no overt subject in the second clause, then the subject is understood as the same as in the first clause (coordination reduction). If the subject is overtly marked (through the presence of a demonstrative pronoun), then the sentence is ambiguous: the subject of the second clause might refer to either Taotao or Takanao.
Fourth, Van Valin and LaPolla (1997:260) show that in English, “a semantic argument appearing in two conjoined active-voice transitive clauses can be represented by a zero pronoun in the second clause only if it is the actor in both clauses”. They provide the following examples:

(8.72) Van Valin and LaPolla (1997:260) a. The mani went downhill and proi saw the dog. b. * The dogi went downhill and saw the man proi. c. The dogi went downhill and proi was seen by the man.

The same is true in Mantauran, as the following examples illustrate:

(8.73) a.

m-o-lraodho

ana ocaoi mani

Dyn.Fin-to-down(wards) that person then

ta-ka-eaea

‘The man went downhill and then proi saw one dog.’

mani then

’i-cengele

ana ocao

__i.

Pass-Dyn.NFin:see that person

‘The dog went downhill and then proi was seen by the man.’

Fifth, if two potential actors occur in the second clause, the occurrence of -ine on the verb in the second clause obligatorily refers to the oblique argument representing the subject of the first sentence:

8.4.4 Split intransitivity

It has been shown in different places of this grammar that Mantauran makes a distinction between dynamic and stative verbs (see Chapter 7). For a number of stative verbs – these are rather limited – the (sole) argument can/must be marked as oblique, not nominative.151 As mentioned in Saillard for Maga Rukai, which shares the same pattern, the nominal argument (i.e., the theme) “is understood to have been caused to be in this state by an unexpressed agent: what is emphasized is not the present state, but rather the fact that a process has taken place, by which the argument came to experience the given state.” Unlike Maga Rukai, this split marking is not just for a 1st person participant, i.e., any pronoun can fill the nominative/oblique slot.

8.5 Existential, possessive and locative clauses

This section deals with existential, possessive and locative clauses and is largely based on the typological study that were conducted in the late 1990’s and resulted in two publications, cf. Zeitoun et al. (1999) and Zeitoun (2000a).
These three types of clauses are examined together, because it has been shown that even though existential and possessive constructions may differ from locative construction syntactically or semantically, they are locative in nature. Freeze (1992:554), for instance, states that formal differences among the three kinds of locative predications cross-linguistically, are quite restricted and highly predictable. This is best explained by the hypothesis that they share the same underlying structure, a hypothesis that accounts naturally for languages in which all members of the locative paradigm are identical in structure, as well as languages in which the existential and ‘have’ forms, as in There is a book on the bench and Lupe has a book are alike, but contrast with the predicate locative, as in The book is on the bench. It is usually assumed that existential and locative constructions differ in terms of: (i) subject selection and (ii) word order, two parameters that are interrelated. In terms of subject selection, it is usually admitted that if the theme is definite, it becomes the subject of the sentence which is given a locative interpretation. If the theme is indefinite, the prepositional phrase (locative) is the subject yielding an existential sentence. In terms of word order, Freeze (1991:2) shows that in verb-initial languages, the theme precedes the locative phrase if indefinite, but appears in sentence-final position if definite. He proposes the following schema to represent this complementary relationship (subject in boldface):

(8.79) Cop Loc

Theme (PL) ↔ Cop Theme Loc (EX)

+definite

-definite

Section 8.4.1 probes into the grammatical structure of existential, possessive and locative clauses while examining the syntactic functions of the nominal arguments and providing a short discussion on word order. In section 8.4.2, two types of have-constructions (glossed as: ‘Y’s X exists’ and ‘X exists at Y’s place’) are further investigated.
8.5.1 Affirmative and negatiave existential, possessive and locative clauses

In Mantauran, the same verb, cf. om-iki ‘exist’ occurs in affirmative existential, possessive and locative constructions.

‘I have money.’ (Lit.: ‘My money exists.’)

c. om-iki

latadhe titina.

Dyn.Fin-exist outside middle-aged woman

‘The middle-aged woman is outside.’

In their negative counterparts, negative existential and possessive clauses are headed by the verb o-kaodho, while in locative sentences, the morpheme -ka is used to negate om-iki.

(8.81) a. o-kaodho

vila’a dha’ane ’angato.

Dyn.Fin-not exist beside house tree

‘There is a tree beside the house.’

ka latadhe

‘The middle-aged woman is outside.’

titina. middle-aged woman

In locative constructions, o-kaodho can be substituted for om-iki-ka-(ProGen) but this substitution is highly restricted: it is mostly allowed in statements that are answers given to questions concerning the location of a referent. If okaodho appears in other contexts, it must be interpreted differently (i.e., referring to the passing away of s.o.).

d. o-kaodho

ana tamatama.

Dyn.Fin-not exist that middle-aged man

‘The middle-aged man (has) passed away.’ (Lit.: ‘The middle-aged man does not exist.’)

The use of a different negative verb in existential/possessive and locative clauses is determined by semantic factors, and more specifically because o-kaodho negates the existence of an element while -ka negates the occurrence of an event.
Contrary to what Freeze demonstrates, in Mantauran – as in many other Formosan languages – the “definiteness effect” does no play any role in the selection of a nominal argument (the theme or the locative phrase) as subject in existential vs. locative constructions. The subject is unmarked in Mantauran and in all the sentences given above, the theme is always the subject. Word order is also quite free, as shown in the following pairs of examples:

(8.83) a. om-iki

vila’a dha’ane ’angato.

‘There is a tree beside the house.’

8.5.1.2 Two possessive clauses Mantauran exhibits two possessive clauses. In the first (‘Y’s X exits’), the possessor is
indicated through a genitive pronoun that occurs on the head noun (i.e., the possessed element), the ordering between the two nouns, i.e., the possessor and the possessed, being rather free.

(8.84) a.

om-iki

paiso-ni.

Dyn.Fin-exist money-3S.Gen

‘S/he has money.’ (Lit.: ‘His/her money exists.’ [implied: it is somewhere, in the bank

or in his pocket])

b. om-iki

paiso-ni

taotao.

Dyn.Fin-exist money-3S.Gen Taotao

‘Taotao has money.’ (Lit.: ‘Taotao’s money exists.’ [same implication])

taotao

paiso-ni.

Dyn.Fin-exist Taotao

money-3S.Gen

‘Taotao has money.’ (Lit.: ‘Taotao’s money exists.’ [same implication])

In the second structure (‘X exists at Y’s place’), the possessor is marked by the oblique case. Though unmarked for case, the theme (that is the possessed) must be treated as the subject of the sentence. This claim is based on co-reference restrictions, illustrated in the examples that follow, which show that the oblique pronoun occurring on the verb does not co-refer with the possessed entity.

(8.85) a.

om-ik-iae

[paiso.]Nom

Dyn.Fin-exist-3S.Obl money-3S.Gen Taotao

‘S/he has Taotao’s money.’ (Lit.: ‘Taotao’s money exists to him/at his place.’)

These two possessive clauses differ semantically and structurally, as briefly shown below. The first structure ‘Y’s X exists’ refers to the existence of the possessed entity. The second structure, ‘X exists at Y’s place’ indicates, on the other hand, inalienable or inherent possession. It can be treated as equivalent to ‘Y has X’ found in other languages, e.g., Saisiyat (see Zeitoun 2000a). The first structure ‘Y’s X exists’ is existential in nature, while the second parallels the locative construction. This claim illustrated by a comparison of the following examples:

8.6 Interrogative sentences
Two types of question words, yes-no questions and content questions, are examined in this section. Whenever necessary, answers are also provided for the sake of comparison. The indefinite usage of interrogative words is dealt with in section 8.6.3.
8.6.1 Yes-No questions

There are two main constructions to form yes-no questions, represented schematically in (8.88) and further illustrated in examples that follow. Both are used productively, but variation in meaning, if any, has not been worked out.
In the first construction, the nominal or verbal predicate is followed by the negator -ka and a genitive pronoun. The second construction is introduced by the nominalized verb aika- (from om-iki ‘exist, be at’) followed by a genitive pronoun and by the negator ka. Answers to both constructions are identical.

8.6.2 Content questions Different content questions can be distinguished, cf. who? (§ 8.6.2.1), whom? (§ 8.6.2.2),
with whom? (§ 8.6.2.3), whose (§ 8.6.2.4), what (§ 8.6.2.5), what’s your name (§ 8.6.2.6), how much, how many? (§ 8.6.2.7), how? (§ 8.6.2.8), why (§ 8.6.2.9), where (§ 8.6.2.10) and when (§ 8.6.2.11). As mentioned in section 5.8, most of the interrogative words (except kani ‘why?’) represent derived nominals functioning as (nominal) predicates.

8.6.2.1 Who? The word for who?/whom?/whose? is aanga-. The etymology of this word is unknown.
When followed only by a pronoun or a demonstrative pronoun, aanga- glosses as ‘who?’. If followed by a verb, the meaning of aanga- depends on the form of the predicate that follows it. aanga- can be translated as ‘who?’ when it is followed by a verb having undergone subjective nominalization. The realis is unmarked. The irrealis is marked by amo-. Negation is indicated through the prefixation of ki- to the base.

8.6.2.8 ‘How?’ Where are three different words for ‘how’. The first, expressed by amokoa, refers to a
degree/quality, ‘how (fast/good/cold)?’. The interrogative word is followd by a verb having undergone manner nominalization. The second and the third occur in complementary distribution, and express a means. apokoa refers to realis, pikoa to irrealis. The verbs that follow apokoa and pikoa are marked differently. After apokoa, the verb undergoes clausal nominalization; following pikoa, the verb is introduced by lo ‘if’ and marked as subjunctive.

8.6.2.11 ‘When?’ There are two main constructions to ask ‘when?’. The first makes use of two interrogative
words, lo idhae ‘when (irealis)’ vs. idhae ‘when (realis)’ that occur as temporal adjuncts (as counterparts of the non-interrogative temporal words lo ’idhae ‘tomorrow’ and ’idhae ‘yesterday’). The main verb is marked as a gerund. There is a counterpart to lo idhae (but such a counterpart has not been found for idhae), whereby a nominalized word kala’omae- ‘when’153 occurs in initial position followed by a temporal/hypothetical clause introduced by lo ‘if’.

153 The main distinction between lo idhae ‘when’ and kala’omae-dha/-ni ‘when’ lies in the fact that while the former can only refer to an irrealis situation, the latter can also refer to an habitual situation. For instance:

Chapter 9 Syntax of complex sentences

This chapter deals with the syntax of complex sentences. I hereby follow Huang’s (1997) classification, that is examine (i) sentential complementation (§ 9.1), (ii) subordination (§ 9.2), and (iii) coordination (§ 9.3).
9.1 Sentential complementation
Sentential complementation can be divided into four different structures: (i) serial verb constructions, (ii) pivotal constructions, (iii) cognition constructions and (iv) utterance constructions. The first two refer to the serialization of two (or more) verbs, which share a common argument. In a serial verb construction, the shared argument is the subject; in a pivotal construction, the shared argument plays a dual role: it serves as the object of the first verb and the subject of the second. Cognition constructions are constituted of a verb (e.g., see, know, remember, forget etc.) followed by another clause. Utterance constructions are made up of a verb of saying preceded or followed by a direct-quote complement.
9.1.1 Serial verb constructions

In Mantauran, two or more verbs (no matter whether they are dynamic, stative or denominal verbs) can be serialized without the occurrence of any ligature between them. For instance:

(9.1) a.

om-oa-nga-lrao Dyn.Fin-go-already-1S.Nom ‘I went to see my mother.’

cengel-ine

iinae.

Dyn.Subj:see-3S.Obl own mother

b. ma-lrakase-lrao Stat.Fin-lazy/dislike-1S.Nom ‘I dislike to eat banana.’

kone

velevele.

Dyn.Subj:eat banana

c. poveelai-lra-ine lightly-1S.Nom-2S.Obl ‘I beat him lightly.’

kelrakelrange. Dyn.Subj:beat

mani ka-lrotoko.

make-a little-1S.Nom Dyn.Subj:chop that tree/brushwood then Stat.NFin:break

‘I cut that tree/brushwood a little and then it broke.’

e. to’aken-a

voa’-ine

correctly/tidily-Imp Dyn.Subj:give-3S.Obl

‘Give the money to Dhipolo correctly!’

f. tila!

ta-siraovo.

leave:Imp 1PI.Nom-Dyn.NFin:go Dyn.Subj:watch SubjNmz-Dyn.NFin:dance

‘Leave! Let’s go and watch (those who) dance.’

g. mani alr-iname

’i a-olrolai sorovo

then

Dyn.NFin:take-1PE.Obl

‘Then, (the Japanese) gathered us, the children, and took us to the police station.’

h. mani dhaace

’i a’olalai

m-oa

then

Dyn.NFin:go

plur:Red:male Dyn.Subj-go

Dyn.NFin:make-Impers.Nom

Caus-Dyn.NFin:wrap

Dyn.Subj:eat

‘Then the men would go fishing and (we) would (mix) the fish (they had caught) with

(glutinous cakes) and eat them.’

A few notes are in order. 1) The two (or more) verbs occurring in a serial verb construction are usually in the active voice. Though they are not found in the corpus, verbs in the passive form occurring in the first, second or both position can be elicited. They represent marked constructions.

(9.2) a.

om-oa-lrao

’i-ra’opo

Dyn.Fin-go-1S.Nom Pass-Dyn.NFin:make injection

‘I went to be given an injection and be operated.’

’i-vorovoro. Pass-Dyn.NFin:operate

514

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

b. ’i-alra-iae

ana lroolai

Pass-Dyn.NFin-take-1S.Obl that child

‘The child was taken by me to be bathed.’

’i-paavanao. Pass-Dyn.NFin:bathe

2) The first verb may either occur in its finite form or in its non-finite form if it follows mani ‘then’ (or omi ‘like that’). The following verbs all occur in their subjunctive form (see § 7.2 for a discussion on verb alternations). Compare the grammaticality of the following pair of examples:

(9.3) a.

ma-lrakase-lrao Stat.Fin-lazy/dislike-1S.Nom ‘I dislike to eat banana.’

kone

velevele.

Dyn.Subj:eat banana

b. * ma-lrakase-lrao Stat.Fin-lazy/dislike-1S.Nom

kane

velevele.

Dyn.Subj:eat banana

3) The first verb attracts the nominative pronoun as well as the aspectual suffixes -na ‘still’, -nga ‘already’.

(9.4) a.

’ako-sisa’i-lrao speak-a little-1S.Nom ‘I speak in a low voice.’

’aovaovaha. speak

b. * ’ako-sisa’i speak-a little

’aovaovaha-lrao. speak-1S.Nom

(9.5) a.

o-dholro-na-ka-li Dyn.Fin-can-still-Neg-1S.Gen ‘I still cannot walk.’

dhoadhaace. Dyn.Subj:walk

b. * o-dholro-ka-li Dyn.Fin-can-Neg-1S.Gen

dhoadaace-na. Dyn.Subj:walk-still

4) Only the first verb can be negated. The second verb never is, unless it belongs to a different clause (the meaning is then slightly different):

(9.6) a.

om-iki-ka-i

latadhe takanao kone

Dyn.Fin-be at-Neg-3S.Gen outside Takanao Dyn.Subj:eat

‘Takanao is not eating a banana outside.’

velevele. banana

5 15

Elizabeth Zeitoun

b. * om-iki

latadhe takanao kone-ka-i

velevele.

Dyn.Fin-be at outside Takanao Dyn.Subj:eat-Neg-3S.Gen banana

≠ c. om-iki

latadhe takanao, o-kane-ka-i

ka velevele.

Dyn.Fin-be at outside Takanao Dyn.Fin-eat-Neg-3S.Gen Neg banana

‘Takanao is outside. He is not eating a banana.’

5) There is no restriction on the reduplication of the second verb to express habituality, for instance:

(9.7) a.

mani dhapele-nai

to-ka’a-ka’ange

then

Dyn.NFin:fish by poisoning-1PE.Nom produce-Red-fish

lroikiikisi…

Dyn.Subj:Red:fishhook

Then we would go fishing…

b. …m-oa

dhakerale ’ena-’enao…

…Dyn.Fin-go river

Dyn.Subj:Red-wash (clothes)

‘…(we) would go to the river to wash clothes…’

6) The oblique pronoun can occur on the first or the second verb, but not on both simultaneously:

(9.8) a.

om-oa-nga-lrao Dyn.Fin-go-already-1S.Nom ‘I went to see my mother.’

cengel-ine

iinae.

Dyn.Subj:see-3S.Obl own mother

b. om-oa-nga-lra-ine

cengele

iinae.

Dyn.Fin-go-already-1S.Nom-3S.Obl Dyn.Subj:see own mother

‘I went to see my mother.’

c. * om-oa-nga-lra-ine

cengel-ine

iinae.

Dyn.Fin-go-already-1S.Nom-3S.Obl Dyn.Subj:see-3S.Obl own mother

7) The relations expressed by serial verbs include phase (e.g., inception, termination), purpose, manner, frequency, comitativity,154 but exclude consecutive or simultaneous temporal relations. In that
154 Verbs of propositional attitude such as ’aico’ono ‘remember, recall’, marimoro ‘forget’, napi’ee ‘regret’ also occur in serial verb constructions, e.g.:

9.1.2 Pivotal verb constructions

Pivotal verb constructions are quite identical to serial verb constructions, but differ in terms of the argument sharing. In pivotal verb construction, the shared argument functions as the subject of the first verb but the object of the second. Pivotal constructions are actually rather rare in Mantauran, in contrast with serial verb constructions which are extremely productive.

9.1.3 Cognition constructions

Cognition constructions are composed of a verb of perception, e.g., o-cengele ‘see’, or knowledge, e.g., o-lriho’o ‘know’ followed by another clause. This construction differs from the serial/pivotal verb construction in that the second verb can appear as (i) a full verb or as (ii) a nominalized verb (either

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

referring to a past or habitual event). The verb o-cengele (but not o-lriho’o) can also take a verbal complement. In that latter case, the second verb occurs in its subjunctive form and cannot be cliticized with any pronoun.

When the verb of the second clause occurs in its finite form, the subject of that verb can be raised in the first clause. A co-referent pronoun – there is none for third person participants – appears in the second clause:

If the nominal arguments of the second verbal clause are full lexical nouns, they can be raised before the verb if they represent the subject of the (second) clause:

Even if it is definite, an object cannot be raised in the first clause, as in affirmative sentences:

9.1.4 Utterance constructions

Mantauran makes use of a conjunction mani ‘then’ followed by the non-finite form of the verb of saying, cf. ia ‘so’ (from om-ia ‘so’) to introduce a direct quote complement.

9.2 Subordination
In this section, different adverbial clauses subsumed under the term “subordination”156 are examined. They include temporal, hypothetical and counterfactual clauses (§ 9.2.1), concessive clauses (§ 9.2.2), causal and reason clauses (§ 9.2.3).
Thompson and Longacre (1985) define adverbial clauses as clauses which modify a verb phrase or

156 Lehman (1988:182) defines subordination as follows: “If syntagms (clauses) X and Y are in a relation of clause linkage, then X is subordinate to Y iff X and Y form an endocentric construction Z with Y as head.”

525

Elizabeth Zeitoun

a sentence through the following means: (i) a subordinating morpheme, which may or may not have a lexical content, occurs clause-initially, (ii) a special verb form (e.g., the verb is in the infinitive), (iii) word order variations (i.e., different position of the predicate; precedence of the adverbial clause, its position being usually determined by its role in linking the main clause which it modifies in the preceding discourse).
9.2.1 Temporal, hypothetical and counterfactual clauses
Temporal, hypothetical and counterfactual clauses share a number of morphological, syntactic and semantic similarities. They are examined in turn below.
9.2.1.1 Temporal clauses: ‘before’, ‘when’ and ‘after’ Temporal clauses include three main types of temporal relations: anteriority (before-clauses),
concomittance (when-clauses) and posteriority (after clauses). These three types of temporal relations are expressed through the same morpho-syntactic device: the nominalization of the adverbial clause. What differs is:
(i) the occurrence of the negator ki- to indicate anteriority (i.e., ‘when … had not…’), (ii) the occurrence of the prefix maka- ‘finish’ or a verb o-lrepenge ‘finish’ to express posteriority (i.e., ‘when…had finished…’). (iii) concomittance only refers to a past event; aspect can be marked in the subordinate
and/or main clause(s).157 Temporal clauses usually occur in sentence initial position. They can be followed by a main clause without anything, or followed by the topic marker ’a or the conjunction mani ‘then’.

9.2.1.4 Summary It has been shown that: temporal, hypothetical and counterfactual clauses share
morpho-syntactic and semantic similarities: On the morpho-syntactic level, they usually occur sentence initially and they are nominalized
sentences. On the semantic levels, Mantauran (as many other Formosan languages) makes a distinction between (past) temporal clauses and habitual temporal clauses/hypothetical clauses, that is between “factual” vs. “non-factual” clauses.
Lehman (1988) proposes six syntactic and semantic parameters viewed as a continuum to make a distinction between subordinate and juxtaposed clauses:
(i) the “hierarchical downgrading of the subordinate clause”, i.e., the degree of affectedness of the adverbial clause
(ii) the “syntactic level of the subordinate clause”, that is the degree of syntactic tightness with respect to the main clause.
(iii) the “desententialization of the subordinate clause”, i.e., the degree to which a clause is expanded or reduced through the elimination of tense/aspect/mood or the elimination of subject-verb agreement.
(iv) the “grammaticalization of the main verb”, the subordinate verb becoming the main verb
(v) the “interlacing of the two clauses” yielding NP deletion, or the occurrence of a zero pronoun in pronominal co-reference
(vi) the “explicitness of linking”, that is the non-occurrence/non-occurrence of a subordinating morpheme.

532

A Grammar of Mantauran (Rukai)

Though the relation between temporal, hypothetical and counterfactual clauses to the main clause is rather tight – these three types of clauses undergo syntactic nominalization – there is no deletion of co-referential pronouns and aspect is marked on both clauses if necessary.
9.2.2 Concessive clauses

In terms of structure and word order, concessive clauses resemble temporal/hypothetical and counterfactual clauses in that: (i) they usually occur in initial position and (ii) they are nominalized clauses. The subordinate verb is circumfixed by ni-…-a, while the verb occurring in the main clause is usually marked as realis:

9.2.3 Causal clauses

Clausal clauses include clauses introduced by alaka-ProGen160 ‘because’ (the occurrence of the genitive pronoun is obligatory) and to’a-tolorae ‘so’ (< to’a- ‘use’ + tolor-ae ‘reason’/’atoloro ‘so’. Both types of clauses occur before or after the main clause.

9.3 Coordination

la coordinates both nominal161 and verbal phrases (the verb that follows la is in its non-finite form):

(9.34) Nominal coordination: N(P) la N(P) a. ma-’amadh-iline ’i dhipolo taotao Stat.Fin-dislike-3P.Obl Dhipolo Taotao ‘Dhipolo dislikes Taotao and Takanao.’

Caus-from-3P.Obl Takanao and Elrenge Dyn.Subj:buy book

161 Nominal arguments can also be juxtoposed, without la, cf.:

b. makana’arale ’i dhipolo

‘Dhipolo is tall and slim.’

la ka-rilai. and Stat.NFin-slim

la also coordinates numerals (cf. § 5.10), as in:

Dyn.Fin-a number of-tens-one-tens-already-1PE.Nom and Stat.NFin-four

LocNmz-Red-Dyn.NFin:study-LocNmz-1PE.Gen

‘When we students were fourteen or fifteen, we would stop studying.’

The coordination of two clauses is usually done through the occurrence of mani ‘then’. While our late informant Lü Yu-zhi would also use la ‘and’, younger informants prefer omi ‘like that’ (cf. § 4.4.2).
