1. INTRODUCTION
This paper is a tentative statement of the basic grammatical features of the Maia language. Maia is a Papuan language belonging to the Kaukombaran language family, Pihom stock, Madang-Adelbert Range sub-phylum of the Trans-New Guinea phylum, and is located in the Almami district of the Bogia sub-district of the Madang Province of Papua New Guinea. Although Maia is a Papuan language, it has borrowed a number of features from Austronesian languages.
Maia speakers are historically from an inland area beginning about 18 kilometers off the North Coast road, but some have more recently migrated to villages situated along the coast. These coastal villages are about 160 kilometers northwest of Madang town. They start from near Dugumor plantation going to near Keloua or Bom plantation. The other (more numerous) inland villages are located to the south of this area. The farthest villages are located south of the Guam river. People generally live in villages of 100-200 people, although some people have moved to smaller hamlets in recent years. Maia speakers number about 4,500 living in 22 villages.
There are two main dialects of Maia. The Main Dialect is spoken by about three quarters of the total population. These people live in the villages of Wagedav, Turupav, Urumarav, Ratagav, Dumudum, Gurube #1, Gurube #2, Turutapa, Pariakanam, Gum, Sabero, Siriar, Widaro, Milalimuda, Wanuru, Dalua, Rara, and Buanavav. The Southern Dialect makes up the remaining one quarter of Maia speakers, and these people live in the villages of Yakiba, Sanavat, Dogodogo, and Mugumat #2 (While Mugumat #1 is in the same census district, it is outside the language group.). Geographically, the villages of the Southern Dialect are situated near the language boundary and are influenced by languages of the adjoining Josephstaal stock. While within the Main Dialect there are a couple of dialect variations between certain villages, these variations are predictable and phonological in nature. Readers can easily adjust the pronunciation according to their own way of speaking. A survey has indicated that all of the villages in the Main Dialect are (so far) quite happy to have the translation written according to the Wagedav dialect where we are allocated.
Initially, the work on the Maia language was begun in 1984 as part of a multi-language project. Jean May and Eunice Loeweke (and later Linda Weisenburger) had served as the SIL advisors to teams of PNG-BTA national translators from four Kaukombaran languages. At that time the project was centered on the coast in Simbine, a Maiani-speaking village. However, due to a number of complexities, the multi-language project was finally terminated in 1994. In 1995, I teamed up with Linda Weisenburger with a view to re-starting the work among the Maia speaking people, since it seemed to be the most viable of the four projects. This called for a re-allocation into a Maia speaking area.
This data presented in this paper is based on texts and elicited materials from Maia speakers originating from Wagedav village. Also, since some of the New Testament books had already been translated by Maia national translators, and checked by SIL consultants, these were included as well. As stated above, the bulk of the texts were collected from 1984-1994, but more recently, in 1997-1998, other stories have been recorded and transcribed, plus a Writer’s Workshop held in June 1998 produced a good collection of stories. The material for this analysis amounts to 700+ kilobytes, out of which 100+ kilobytes are unelicited texts.
The author is grateful for the work of her predecessors Jean May and Eunice Loeweke. Jean May’s initial phonological analysis was especially helpful. Thanks also to Catherine Easton who, more recently, did further work on the phonology and has made some revisions to the earlier analysis. The work under Section 2 Phonological and Orthographic Notes was done in collaboration with Easton and was taken from her forthcoming Maia Phonology Essentials paper. I am indebted to my co-worker, Linda Weisenburger, who collected a large part of the data for this grammatical analysis, and kept me encouraged throughout the tedious and untold hours of research and writing of this paper, and also helped with some of the editing. My very special thanks go to Liisa Järvinen, Eileen Gasaway and Paul Heineman for their invaluable consultant help. Eileen and Paul provided some advice in the initial stages, and Liisa has edited and advised me throughout the final stages of the paper. Besides her general knowledge of linguistics, Liisa’s ability in identifying some of the features that Maia has borrowed from Austronesian languages, plus her experience in and knowledge of the related Mauwake language has been especially insightful. BTA associates, Jacob Muain Lakia, Morris Lolomir, and Mebul Kuawaya, also provided many insights, texts and explanations of texts, and were responsible for the New Testament books were translated at the time of this writing. Certain young people from Wagedav and Turupav villages have also faithfully helped with back translating texts into Tok Pisin. While Paul Waira and Peter Kuwuk Munaira did a lot of the work, others

helped as well. Thanks also is due to all the other unnamed Maia people who have so willingly and patiently told their stories, answered our many questions, and supported us with their friendship. Finally, and above all, I thank God for his enablement to bring this paper to completion.

2.2 Morphophonemic Notes
2.2.1 Vowel Deletion – Verbs
When two vowels are juxtaposed at a morpheme boundary within a verb, the vowel to the left of the boundary is deleted.

inE - idç inø - idç /inidç/
‘he will sleep’

bumElaBa - ini bumElaBø - ini /bumelaBini/

nimE - a nimø - a /nima/
‘he is eating’

malip - a - iç malip - ø - iç
/malipiç/
‘I will work’

2.2.1.1 Degemination

When two like vowels occur across a morpheme boundary, one is deleted.

/tEtEa/ ‘he told a story’

idum - a - a idum - ø - a
/iduma/ ‘he stole’

Both vowel deletion and degemination will sometimes apply to the same form, with vowel deletion occurring first.

2.2.2 Vowel Harmony
2.2.2.1 Verb suffix boundaries
At the boundary between two verb suffixes, the vowel immediately preceding the boundary takes the form of the following vowel. Vowel harmony also occurs at the boundary between a verb root ending with the vowel /E/ and the following vowel on the first suffix. However, verb roots ending with the vowel /a/ remain unaffected by the following vowel.

2.2.2.2 Demonstrative Pronouns + ra
Vowel harmony also occurs when the demonstrative pronouns are followed by the clitic -ra. The vowel // preceding the morpheme boundary takes the form of the vowel of the enclitic -ra. These appear to be irregular forms as the enclitic -ra does not lead to vowel harmony in any other situation.

2.2.3 Consonant Deletion
When the initial consonants of the clitics -gat, -di, -no and -waka occur contiguously with any other consonant at a morpheme boundary, the initial consonant of the clitic is deleted.

2.2.4 Inalienably Possessed Nouns
There are a number of nouns which are inalienably possessed: body parts, kinship terms and position nouns. The prefix on the noun refers to the possessor of the noun. For 1st and 2nd person, singular and plural differentiated by stress. The following is a list of the prefixes used.

Person Prefix
ini-
u»i»ni-
»wi-

Example –dia ‘skin’

1st person singular 2nd person singular
3rd person singular 1st person plural 2nd person plural

/i»dia/ /ni»dia/
/u»dia/ /»idia/ /»nidia/

3rd person plural /»widia/

<idia> <nidia>
<udia> <iidia> <niidia>
<widia>

‘my skin’
‘your (sg) skin’ ‘his/her skin’
‘our skin’
‘your (pl) skin’ ‘their skin’

This pattern is regular except when the noun stem begins in a vowel. The stress patterns are instrumental in explaining the morphophonemic processes. Consequently I have added the feature [+/- stress] to the equations.

3. CLITICS

Clitics are grammatical forms which function on the phrase or higher level but are phonologically bound to a word. They occur postpositionally and serve to mark different syntactic, pragmatic, or semantic roles within a higher level structure. While a clitic may have a basic meaning, it may also have more than one semantic realization or grammatical function. The clitics and their various functions are summarized and discussed below:

CLITIC =(w)aka =(g)at =yag =mate =ga =ra =(n)o =(d)i =git =ma =na

FUNCTION Limitation Marker Comitative Marker Collective Marker Manner Marker Specific Locative Marker Non-Specific Locative Marker Topic Marker Contrast Marker Contrafactual Marker Emphatic Marker Attention Marker

ABBREVIATION LIM COM COLL MN LOC1 LOC2 TP CT CFT EM ATN

3.1 The Limitation Marker: (w)aka
The limitation clitic, =(w)aka, is glossed in the data as LIM. Relationally, this clitic may have a broad or a narrow orientation. It may relate to words or phrases which modify the sentence as a whole, or it may relate to words which only modify the predicate (forming manner or degree adverbs), or it may only relate to a particular element in the clause—either a core or peripheral element.
There is some discrepancy between the use of the forms =waka or =aka. Most of the time the form =aka follows a consonant. However, we have noted at least one exception, tutum=waka ‘stick=LIM’. Most of the discrepancies exist following vowels. Often there seems to simply be a variation between speakers. There may be a pronunciation change taking place in the language. For example, a number of times we’ve noted both forms:

kani=waka katu=waka ane=waka dogo=waka yo=waka yana=waka

or kani=aka or katu=aka or ane=aka or dogo=aka or yo=aka or yan=aka

= ‘big=LIM’ = ‘enough/able=LIM’ = ‘say=LIM’ = ‘straight=LIM’ = ‘1s=LIM’ = ‘long=LIM’

However, at other times, the form seems to be more firmly fixed. We will need to study this more, and will perhaps need to note in the lexicon which words take what forms.

‘one=LIM’ ‘3s-before=LIM’ ‘do=MN=LIM’ ‘nothing=LIM’ ‘3p-INTP=CT=LIM’

The clitic, =(w)aka, is used to express the following functions:

3.1.1 Expressing a Restriction in Focus
When affixed to noun or adverbial phrases or embedded clauses, =(w)aka functions semantically somewhat like certain English adverbs which are used for emphasizing, focusing or intensifying purposes. As stated above, the semantic restriction indicated by this clitic may be very narrow or very wide in its scope depending on the context. The meaning must be inferred by the listener/reader. Some of the adverbs in English which give some idea of the range of meaning in this context would include: just, only, alone, simply, particularly, especially, exclusively, exactly, precisely, totally, completely, entirely, absolutely.

3.1.2 Forming Derived Manner Words
Derived adverbs may be formed, carrying the semantic notion of manner, when the restrictive marker is affixed to adjectives or nouns, or to the manner word (nemate ‘do=MN’) or certain time words to form sentence adverbials.

3.1.3 As a Temporal Clause Marker: Overlap / Immediate Succession
As a clause marker, the clitic =(w)aka may either indicate a restriction in temporal overlap, or temporal succession, depending on the aspect of the verbs being related.
In medial clauses, =(w)aka is suffixed to the medial verb inflectional markers, as in (10), (11), (12), (13). Following final clauses, =(w)aka may be suffixed to the different subject switch-reference marker ‘=(d)i’, as in (14), (15).

 When the first clause contains a medial verb marked by –game ‘SIM’, it indicates an emphasized span of time during which the action of the second clause occurred, (10), (11).
10) ...buge-game=waka ine +avi-a. ...sit -SIM =LIM sleep+go-RL.3s ‘...while he was still sitting, he went sound asleep.’
11) Yo yo-nor av me+da sane-game=waka, yo=no saki-a+ni-so-mo... 1s 1s-INTP village NEG+AD2 put-SIM=LIM 1s=TP talk-VR1+2s-give-RL.1s/3p ‘When I still hadn’t left home yet, I told you...”

 When the first clause contains a medial verb marked by –sa ‘SEQ’, it indicates an action which is immediately followed by the action of the second clause, (12).

12) Wari lavaya-s=aka

ta min-a ... DIR throw.out-RL.3s
‘Having just looked at Jesus, (immediately) the boy’s body shook and it threw him on the ground.’

 When the first clause is marked by a finite verb with an imperfective aspect, it indicates that the action of the first clause had just started, when the action of the second clause occurred, (14), (15). Cf. (14) with (16) without a limitation marker.

14) Nanam buade-g-a di=waka nabo tekek-ana.

3.2 The Comitative Marker: (g)at
The comitative clitic =(g)at expresses association which generally comes under the meaning of ‘together with’. It is also used to form derived adverbs and nouns, and to express coordinate NP relations.

3.2.1 Expressing an Association
There is a range of ideas showing different types of association which can be expressed by using the comitative marker =(g)at:

 The idea of accompaniment means to be associated with, or to be in the presence or company of something or somebody.

18) ... o=gat ig-ame u -nabase-g -ido. ... 3s-COM be-SIM 3s-help -IPF-IR.3s
‘...he/she will be with him and will help him.’

Adam-TP 3s-INTP woman Eve=COM sleep-RL.3s

‘Adam slept with his wife Eve.’

 The ideas of instrument, means, and material are used to express an association between the actor and the accompanying medium that the actor uses to perform an action.
20) ...muado muakit=at uvin=aka bade-g -a. ...man knife =COM quick=LIM cut -IPF-RL.3s ‘...a man usually cuts it quickly with a knife.’

pelek+ano-mo.

3p=TP custom bad PL PROX=COM fill+say-RL.1s/3p

‘They are filled with these bad ways.’

 Used with noun phrases expressing time, the idea is that of an existing quality of state.

25) inav inavat

‘day/time’ ‘always’

26) inav kosov inav kosovat

‘every time’ ‘all the time’

27) unau unaugat

28) uruwa uruwagat

‘morning’ ‘in/during the morning’

29) kam kam=at

‘year’ ‘in/during the year’

30) Sarere uruwa=gat

Dugumor avia-mi...

Saturday morning=COM Dugumor go-RL.1p

‘On Saturday morning, we went to Dugumor...’

 A noun phrase plus the clitic =(g)at also expresses the idea of having or possessing something.
31) Kawulia wat kani arop=at. Kawulia pig big three=COM ‘Kawulia has three big pigs.’

August 2010

3.2.2 Forming a Derived Noun
The clitic =(g)at may be used to coin new nouns from existing nouns. To coin a new noun, an existing noun is used, which is in some way conceived to possess a particular characteristic or quality of state (literally or figuratively) related to the new form. The existing noun, when combined with =(g)at, results in the new derived form. For example the word muata ‘custom’ when suffixed with =(g)at results in the word “teacher”. For other examples see under Section 4.1.4 Noun Derivation.

3.2.3 Forming a Derived Adverb
Temporal sentence adverbials have been derived from certain adjectives by the addition of the comitative marker =(g)at. Only two forms have been noted thus far in the data.
The adjective toromo ‘new’ becomes toromo=gat meaning ‘first’ or ‘a time sequence characterized by newness/prematurity.’ Or, when used the adjective upam ‘small’ forming the word upam=at, it means ‘during childhood’ or ‘the time frame characterized by smallness (i.e. childhood)’.
32) Toromo=gat=o i-nor nada nanav nauve-sa wi-nad-arav. new=COM=TP 1p-INTP child food dish.up-SEQ 3p-give.food-IR.1p ‘Firstly, we will dish up food and give it to our children.’
33) Yo-nor upam=at, kasiwar me nage-game, anuv u-da... 1s-INTP small=COM cassowary NEG look-SIM, time 3s-AD2 ‘(When) I was small, and had not seen a cassowary, one day...’ or, ‘When I had smallness, and had not seen a cassowary, one day...’

3.2.4 Indicating Coordinate NP Relations
For the uses of =(g)at in coordinate NPs, see Section 6.1.4.1 Coordinate Noun Phrases.

3.3 The Collective Marker: yag
The clitic =yag marks the Noun Phrase for plurality in a collective/group sense. Whenever the head noun cannot be marked, for example, because it isn’t there or because of some other reason (such as on a possessive form, etc.), the clitic then ‘jumps’ to the finite verb of the clause, occurring as the final element. Medial verb forms cannot take the collective marker. On the finite verb, the marker refers to the collective subject when occurring on an intransitive verb, the collective object when occurring on a transitive verb, or the collective indirect object when occurring on a di-transitive verb.

34) Di muado nada toromo=yag ono=na=di yo-do-mo... DS man child youth=COLL D1=ATN=CT 1s-tell-RL.1s/3p ...
‘And the boy’s youth (group) told me...’

‘...he told them all those things (collectively).’

(Di-transitive—indirect objects as a group)

For a fuller treatment of noun phrase plurality, see 6.1.2.

3.4 The Manner Marker: mate

The manner marker basically indicates similarity. It is limited in its distribution, but has several uses. It only occurs on the proximal or distal-1 demonstratives, on the 3rd person singular pronoun, or on the verb nema ‘do/cause/make’ meaning ‘do.like(something)’. The latter is used when forming Adverbial Phrases/Clauses of similarity or comparison. The stem nema + =mate elides the left-most repeated syllable becoming ne=mate ‘do=MN’. The marker is used to indicate: (1) a way or method ; (2) classification, i.e., a kind/type/sort ; (3) similitude; or, (4) an illustration/exemplifcation.

o=mate ovo=mate ono=mate ne=mate

3s=MN PROX=MN D1=MN do=MN

These manner words may function as: a noun (indicating a type/sort of something), a manner adverb modifying the verb, or, sentence initially, as a back-referencing sentence adverbial (i.e., Nemate ‘do=MN’ or Ne=mate=waka ‘do=MN=LIM’), or they may be used to mark an embedded manner phrase/clause (simile). Or, ne=mate ‘do=MN’ and ige+nemate ‘be+do=MN’ may be used as verbs with all the normal medial or finite verb inflections. I have no examples of igemate having any inflection. I have seen =mate marked with a medial verb inflection only once when used on a pronoun, as in (45).1 The use of =mate with a verb root, or with verb inflection needs more study.
The words ige=mate ‘be=MN’ and ige+ne=mate ‘be+do=MN’ also form the indefinite manner adverbs meaning ‘how’. (See 5.2.3.3) These same two words are used to form interrogative words of manner (e.g. how/what). See under Interrogative Words, section 5.4.3.

3.5 The Specific Location Marker: ga
The specific location enclitic ‘=ga’ may occur on a NP, a nominalized clause, a relative clause, or on time or location words.
3.5.1 Semantic Relationships Expressed by =ga
Glossed as LOC1 in the data, =ga primarily expresses a static position relating to a specific place or time. It is also used to express other secondary kinds of semantic relationships, such as manner, origin , rank, etc. These are mostly derivable from the basic meaning of location, but the specific senses depend on the context. Below are some of the senses which =ga may represent:

3.6 The Non-Specific Location Marker: ra
The non-specific location enclitic ‘=ra’ may occur on time or location words, on noun phrasess, or on embedded clauses. It is glossed in the data as LOC2. When relating to a place, it primarily indicates a generalized, non-specific or non-stationary place, an approximate location, or a place that is not exactly known. It may also indicate motion towards a place, or movement within a general area. When relating to time, it indicates an approximate time. It is also used in combination with other words to indicate extended senses of meaning.

3.6.1 Semantic Relationships Expressed by =ra on Phrase Level

1. Indicates a general, non-specified place (i.e. around and about a place)—may express uncertainty or an abstract location.

78) muanigo=ra now/today=LOC2 ‘(sometime) today’

3. =ra + katu+nane Indicates motion from or to a given boundary; i.e., as far as, or until reaching (a place).
79) Bogia av kani=ra katu+na-t-a.... Bogia village big=LOC2 enough/able+say-CAU2-RL.3s ‘He went as far as the town of Bogia...’

kuvik=ra2

duwa=ga

‘on the sixth day’ (lit. on the five plus one day)’

3.6.2 As a Temporal Clause Marker: Sequential Priority
The non-specific locative marker, =ra, acts as a subordinating conjunction pointing out that the event(s) indicated by the previous clause(s) is both necessary (in the speaker’s mind) and prior to the event(s) indicated by the following clause(s). The logical or physical priority of the first event over the second is essential to the point that the second clause may be deleted if the event of the second clause is obvious by implication, as in (83). This clitic may be appended to the Same Subject and Different Subject sentence boundary particles, or to a medial verb following the medial verb suffix.

81) Ino-mo,

waiam-ø-a

di=ra

‘They slept, and after it became daylight, they buried him.’

‘All right, I will go to Jerusalem, and after I give them the money, I will prepare myself to go to Spain.’

2 When used to add another number(s) to the basic five numbers, kuvik + the clitic =ra means something like ‘to the other side’. This idea comes from counting from one to five on the left hand, then crossing to the other side (so to speak) to add more numbers by counting on the right hand.

3.7 The Topic Marker: (n)o
3.7.1 Use within a Clause
The Topic Marker =(n)o marks given/referential information. Dik defines Topic as “the entity ‘about’ which the predication predicates something in the given setting.” (1981:19) The constituent marked as Topic most often coincides with the Subject of the clause, however this is not always the case, see example (85). It is also quite possible to have more than one topic per clause (86). The ‘givenness’ of the constituents not only comes from contextual information, but also includes general knowledge or situational information assumed to be given information by the speaker. The Topic marker is both phonologically and semantically close to the distal-1 demonstrative ono. The consonant deletion rule (see section 2.2.3) applies when this clitic is used.
84) Yo-nor awun winim=o Dasti. 1s=INTP dog name=TP Dasti ‘My dog’s name is Dasti.’
85) Anam=ga=no, muga idum-arav muata me+da malip-ø-iwe. later=LOC1=TP bird steal-NOM custom NEG+AD2 work-VR1-IR.2p ‘From now on, you must not make the practice of stealing chickens. ’
86) Inav ono=ga=no ida=no me+da muanigo ig-a ovo ne=mate, weie. day/time D1=LOC1=TP earth=TP NEG+AD2 now be-RL.3s PROX do=MN, no At that time, the earth was not like it is today, no.
More examples of the Topic are found in Section 7.4 on Topic-Comment Clauses.
3.7.2 Conditional/Temporal use of the Topic Marker
The Topic Marker is not only used to mark structures within the clause, it is also used to mark a whole clause or sentence as both ‘given’ and subordinate, indicating a contingency of condition or time. The meaning of =(n)o is similar to the conditional (irrealis) or temporal (realis) if and when subordinate conjunctions in English. It may be appended to a final verb, or to the switch reference markers bada or di.
87) ...40=aka muado lov+lov u-ved-io bada=no, av kani ono me+da ...40=LIM man RDUP+good 3s-see-IR.1s SS=TP village big D1 NEG+AD2
lamua-t-io." bad-CAU1-IR.1s ‘If I see just 40 good men, I will not destroy the town.’

28

August 2010

3.8 The Contrast Marker: (d)i
The clitic =(d)i marks contrastive information in a clause. It has a morphophonemic change to =i following a consonant. Thus far, it has been noted to occur on subject and direct object NPs, and on directional phrases.

88) Di muado ono o-nor nanum=i av=ga

89) O-nor=aka muado ono muat=i uma-tat-a. 3s-INTP=LIM man D1 snake=CT die-CAU1-RL.3s

90) No=no ta kenai=di av-inek+an-ini di=no yo=no 2s=TP DIR left=CT go-DES.s+say-IR.2s DS=TP 1s=TP
‘If you want to go to the left, I’ll go to the right.

wabona=di avio... right=CT go-IR.1s

The different subject switch reference marker is also (d)i. (Section 5.5.4.2)

3.9 The Contrafactual Marker: git
The clitic =git marks a clause as being contrary to the facts stated in a clause. A contrafactual clause expresses what didn’t happen or couldn’t happen.
The Contrafactual Marker often marks the main clause of a contrafactual conditional sentence, as in (91).

91) Sanda ono muayagasa-g-ito, ono 300.00 kina nanam+u-munuv tava=git,

bada

‘If they had been selling the perfume, it would have gotten money (worth) 300.00 kina, and that money could have been given to the poor.’

To express that something or somebody was capable of being or doing something in a particular way, but, in fact, it was clearly not the case, the adverb katu “enough/able” is used preceding the predicate, plus the contrafactual clitic =git is used on the final verb of a clause.

92) Ma-ne=mate=waka, wi-nor nada maia bu badaka u-dogo=waka lovavan onor=aka E-do=MN=LIM 3p-INTP child PL AD1 all 3s-straight-LIM very.good INTS=LIM

3.10 The Emphatic Marker: ma
The occurrence of the Emphatic Marker =ma has been observed only on: (1) personal names, (2) personal pronouns, or (3) the Proximal and Distal-1 demonstratives, and (4) in combination with the Topic marker =no, i.e. =no=ma (3.12.1.6) and =ma=no (3.12.1.7). It marks a given person or a particular situation as having an extra measure of prominence in the current clause. At this point, it is not clear whether it gives some particular kind of prominence.

3.10.1 Relating Coordinate Personal Names
When giving equal prominence to two named people in a given situation, the marker =ma is placed on both names. Besides giving the two participants a heightened prominence, =ma concurrently expresses a coordinate relationship. This is similar to the coordinating function of the Comitative clitic =(g)at, except that =ma is used only to coordinate personal names.
93) Di Abram=ma Neo=ma bu nanum wi=tavo-mo. DS Abram=EM Nahor=EM AD1 woman 3p-get-RL.1s/3p ‘Abram and Nahor each got a wife.’
94) Ega=ma Ismael=ma wi-raitbeso-mo. Hagar=EM Ishmael=EM 3p-send.away-RL.1s/3p ‘They sent both Hagar and Ishmael away.’

3.10.2 Indicating the Associates of a Named Addressee
Occasionally =ma is used following a single name or personal pronoun. For example, when a person’s name is being called out to gain their attention, and when the caller attaches =ma to the end of that name, the Addressee, then, includes not only the named or prominent one, but also all those unidentified people who happen to be in association with that person at the time. Or, when more than one person is being referred to, a pronoun marked by =ma refers to them together.
95) Mela=ma! Irebue-re! Mela=EM Come-IMP.PF.p ‘Mela (and all those with you)! Come!’

‘And in the sky, he put the sun, moon and stars. It is those which will give light to the earth.’

3.11 The Attention Marker: na
The clitic =na is a pragmatic marker used as a kind of attention activator. It occurs at the end of a clause or following a sentence boundary marker to alert the reader or hearer that the preceding statement is the one that is leading up to a thematically important assertion in the discourse. It says in effect, “Attention! Something significant is about to be said,” thus raising the expectation level of the reader/listener. However, it is not necessary to include =na with every part of the story’s thematic progression. It is simply used as the speaker deems necessary. In speaking, there is no extra phonological stress placed on this clitic; the stress remains level with the preceding syllable.
Used in combination with other clitics, =na may also be used to mark NPs (e.g. =na=di).
There is also an interjection word, na, used as an attention-getting device. This word is usually shouted to gain someone’s attention before speaking to them.

3.12 Clitic Combinations with Discourse Functions
The combinations of clitics which function on the discourse level are are follows:

=(d)i=no =na=di =na=di=no =na=di=waka =ma=di =(n)o=ma =ma=no

Contrast Marker + Topic Marker Attention Marker + Contrast Marker Attention Marker + Contrast Marker + Topic Marker Attention Marker + Contrast Marker + Limitation Marker Emphatic Marker + Contrast Marker Topic Marker + Emphatic Marker Emphatic Marker + Topic Marker

These are discussed below, but more study needs to be done at the discourse level to get a better understanding of how these function.

3.12.1.1 Contrast + Topic: (d)i +no The markers =di plus =no indicate a Topic that is also in Contrast with something else.

101) Muado badaka amar avia-mo ono, u-da=di=no

weie lov. no good
‘Of all the people that went to the sago, even one did not return to the village, absolutely not.’

3.12.1.2 Attention + Contrast: na+di
When used in combination as =na=di, and when attached to a NP, =na functions anaphorically in a discourse to call attention to the fact that the NP under consideration is, not only contrastive in the current clause, but is, in fact, the same particular topic which was previously talked about. The distance of the earlier mention of the referent to the current clause may be very close, i.e., in the previous sentence, or it may be located several sentences prior to the current clause. It occurs on the demonstratives (which mark the NP as definite).
102) Yo-nor emuar ono=na=di u-nau mene-sa... 1s-INTP friend D1=ATN=CT 3s-earlier shoot-SEQ ‘That friend of mine [i.e. that particular one that I mentioned earlier in the story] shot first...’

I have also noted this clitic combination occurring on two other words, the interrogative word ige ‘where’ and the noun wabo ‘hand’. When contrasting the unmarked words with the cliticized ones, the above clitic combination

32

August 2010

(i.e., =na=di) seems to also have the idea of a particular ‘given’ in contrast with any other ‘given’. These need further study.

 ige  ige=na ‘be=ATN’
 ige=na=di ‘be=ATN=CT’

= ‘be (where/wherever/whatever)’ = ‘perhaps’ (=na in this case, seems to lend the idea
of tenuousness) = ‘a particular place/time in contrast with any other’

 wabo

= ‘hand’

 wabo=na ‘hand=ATN’

= ‘right’ (a particular hand)

 wabo=na=di ‘hand=ATN=CT’ = ‘the right-hand side’

 tipi  tipi=na  tipi=na=di

= how many/how much = when (in particular) = What time is it? (when, in contrast with any other time)

3.12.1.3 Attention + Contrast + Topic: na+di+no
The markers =na=di=no indicate that a particular previously mentioned Topic is the very same as the current topic under consideration, and that it is contrasted with something else.

4. MAJOR WORD CLASSES
4.1 Nouns
Nouns are words which are used to refer to people and things. Nouns function as the head of a NP. Nouns are not marked for number, gender or case. Case marking and (some) number marking occurs on the Noun Phrase level.
Nouns are divided into two main sub-classes according to their morphology: (1) inalienably possessed nouns, and (2) alienably possessed nouns. The class of alienably possessed nouns may be further subdivided into common and proper nouns.

4.1.1 Inalienably Possessed Nouns
Inalienably possessed nouns are semantically grouped into body parts, kinship terms and position nouns, plus a few other special nouns (some of which are in some way related to the above categories). It is a closed class. Inalienably possessed noun stems require a person/number prefix which almost always agrees in person and number with the possessor. When a generic word is needed, it is prefixed with the 3s form.
There are two terms each for the words ‘father’ and ‘mother’, ‘grandfather’ and ‘grandmother’, and ‘grandchild’—one a term of reference and the other a term of address. The terms of address do not require a posessor prefix, while the terms of reference always require the possessor prefix.

4.1.1.1 Kinship Nouns (See Appendix 1 for a fuller list)

-buae ‘father’ -namo ‘mother’

i-buae 1s-father
i-namo 1s-mother

ni-buae 2s-father
ni-namo 2s-mother

u-buae 3s-father
u-namo 3s-mother

ii-buae 1p-father
ii-namo 1p-mother

nii-buae 2p-father
nii-namo 2p-mother

wi-buae 3p-father
wi-namo 3p-mother

Terms of address—

Abuae Nana Dat Damuke Maib

‘Father’ ‘Mother’ ‘Grandfather’ ‘Grandmother’ ‘Grandchild’

The kinship terms for ‘husband’ and ‘wife’, or ‘son’ and ‘daughter’ are not inalienable, as they are the same as ‘man’ and ‘woman’, or ‘boy’ and ‘girl’, respectively.

4.1.1.2 Body Parts (See Appendix 2 for a fuller list)

-muda ‘eye’ -munuv ‘heart’

i-muda 1s-eye
i-munuv 1s-heart

ni-muda 2s-eye
ni-munuv 2s-heart

u-muda 3s-eye
u-munuv 3s-heart

ii-muda 1p-eye
ii-munuv 1p-heart

nii-muda 2p-eye
nii-munuv 2p-heart

wi-muda 3p-eye
wi-munuv 3p-heart

36

August 2010

4.1.1.3 Position Nouns The position nouns, which are inalienably a part of something else, are as follows:

-parar -ram -moto -gama -gamado -ko -gasiri -pur -tono

‘the top of (something)’ [means ‘over’ or ‘on’] ‘the middle of (something/somebody)’ ‘the proximity of (i.e., near to something/somebody)’ ‘the inside of (something/somebody)’ ‘the midst of (among something/somebody)’ ‘the middle of (something/somebody)’ ‘the side of (something/somebody)’ ‘the back of (something/somebody)’ ‘(do something bad) on.top of (someting).’

118) Muado kuvik

padire-sa u-tono

sukulo-go-mo.

man some/other get.up-SEQ 3s-on.top.of spit-IMP-RL.1s/3p

‘Some men got up and were spitting on him.’

119) Yag=o ida u-podav

‘The water that was underneath the ground came up and watered the top of the ground.’

120) Wi=no dawa u-moto

ono=ga ida daeve-sa bowa-mo.

3p=TP house 3s-nearness.of D1=LOC1 ground dig-SEQ bury-RL.1s/3p

‘They dug the ground there close to the house and buried him.’

121) Dawa om ir-a bada u-gama

utuve-sa buge-g-a.

house high climb.up SS 3s-the.inside.of enter-SEQ sit.down-IPF-RL.3s

‘He climbed up the high house and entered the inside of it and was sitting down.

122) Yo=no anam u-pur

puetevo-mo.

1s=TP later 3s-the.back.of run-RL.1s/3p

‘I, afterward, ran behind him.’

4.1.1.4 Others
Other nouns have both a generic form, having no prefix, and a form used as a term of reference, requiring the person prefix.

Generic Term (no prefix): 123) anim ‘name’ 124) taval ‘offering’ 125) todom ‘portion’

Term of reference (prefix required):

ni-nim i-taval u-todom

‘2s-name’ ‘1s-offering’ ‘3s-portion’

(your name) (my offering) (his portion)

August 2010

37

126) kanav ‘mark’ 127) nisia ‘footfall’ 128) nayav ‘footprint’ 129) muira ‘boy’ 130) iribuav ‘girl’

i-kanav u-nisia ni-nayav i-muira w-iribuav

‘3p-mark’ ‘3s-footfall’ ‘2s-footprint’ ‘1s-boy’ ‘3p-girl’

(their mark/characteristic) (his footfall, i.e. the sound of it) (your footprint) (my brother)—not blood kinship (my sister)—not blood kinship

Another noun in this category always requires the possessor prefix. While not technically a body part, it is used in relation to the body parts, and generically for other things as well, e.g. corn kernels, flour with yeast.

131) ni-subum

‘3s-swelling’ (your swelling)

(Note: There is also an alienably possessed noun, subum, without the prefix, but the meaning is ‘slit.gong’. )

As noted above, the person/number prefix on inalienably possessed nouns almost always agrees in person and number with the possessor. However, one exception to this has been noted thus far. On the noun -bom meaning ‘fear of (something/somebody)’, the prefix agrees in person and number with the causer of the fear.

132) o-bom

‘3s-fear’ (fear of him/her)

4.1.2 Alienably Possessed Nouns
4.1.2.1 Common Nouns Common nouns semantically include people or things which are either countable or uncountable, single or
collective, abstract or concrete, animate or inanimate, etc.

pat ‘stone’ idi ‘banana’ wat ‘pig’

ruwu ninara imar

‘enemy’ ‘local.spirit’ ‘assembly’

bubulo etek yag

‘illness’ ‘deceit’ ‘water’

Only a slight distinction between countable and uncountable nouns may be made through the choice of modifier used in the noun phrase. For example, with countable nouns the modifier kani may mean “big” in size, but with uncountable nouns kani may mean “big” in quantity, “big” in degree, etc. However, when speaking of the quantity of a countable noun, a quantifier such as kumu ‘several’ would be used, or volume + quantity, the quantifier kani+kani ‘RDUP+big’ is used to indicate that the quantity of the large body of water is plural. A frozen form of kumu modified by kani is also used—i.e. kumukani ‘many’—with countable nouns. The context may determine whether a noun is countable or uncountable. Only the third person singular form of a verb is used with uncountable nouns, (133).

(size) (size) (size or importance fig.) (quantity) (quantity) (quantity--countable) (volume/quantity—countable)
(volume--uncountable) (quantity) (degree) (degree of intensity) (quantity or degree)

133) U-rukuv kani-di yag kani apua+yas-a. 3s-darkness big-CT water big cover+completely-RL.3s
‘A big darkness completely covered the big water.’

4.1.2.2 Proper Nouns
Proper nouns include specific “person” names (i.e., humans, pets, spirits,etc.) or place names. They can be, but are not normally pluralized or possessed, or otherwise modified.

Wagedav Sikem Kaudiga Dasti Wadidabua

village name woman’s name man’s name dog’s name river name

4.1.3 Temporal Nouns
Maia has borrowed clock times, the words awa ‘hour’ and wik ‘week’, the names of the seven week-days, and the names of the twelve months of the year from Tok Pisin. Other time categories and words are:

TIME PERIODS: TIMES OF THE DAY:

anuv inav alev kam barat
waiama uruwa sisir unaro kerek gener

‘time/day’ ‘time/day’ ‘month/moon’ ‘year’ ‘year’
‘dawn, day-break’ ‘morning’ ‘daytime, mid-day’ ‘afternoon’ ‘dusk, evening’ ‘night’

4.1.4 Noun Derivation
4.1.4.1 Derivational Clitic: (g)at Some nouns may be derived from other nouns by the addition of the comitative clitic =(g)at.

134) u-kum 3s-head
‘head’

u-kum=at 3s-head=COM
‘leader’

135) muata custom
‘custom’

muata=gat custom=COM
teacher

136) umuani salt
‘salt’

umuani=gat salt=COM
councillor

4.1.4.2 Nominalised Verbs Nouns may be derived from verb roots by the addition of the nominalizing suffix -arav. The nominalizing
suffix is identical to the 1p Irrealis final verb inflection -arav.
137) Yo-nor awun o-wag nag-arav=o... 1s-INTP dog 3s-leg look-NOM=TP ‘the look of my dog’s legs...’
138) Yag u-vis-arav ono bada+nan-a... water 3s-wash-NOM D1 finish+say-RL.3s ‘(He) finished the baptism...’ [lit. the water-washing]
139) ...i-rabe wadib-arav ono lamua, ... ...1-DU argue-NOM D1 bad ‘The arguing of the two of us is bad, ...’
140) ...bada wamun uv-arav ono gete-game nanav=o ipua+ipua+sano-go-mo. ...SS pot boil-NOM D1 wait-SIM food=TP RDUP+peel+put-IPF-RL.1s/3p ‘...while they await the pot’s boiling, they peel the food and set it aside.’
141) ...umu=gat posonan-arav ono parar+an-a. ...bow=COM shoot.arrow-NOM D1 knowledge+say-RL.3s ‘He knew arrow-shooting with a bow.’

There are a few verbs that have been been nominalized by what appears to be an abbreviated form of the nominalizing suffix, -arav becoming -av. These are frozen forms.

 ume  ine  naume
 nime

= die = sleep = cry
= eat

 umav = death

 inav

= day/time

 naumav = cryer (cf. nada naumarav ono meaning ‘the crying of the child’)

 nimav = eater (as in mek+nimav = an unweaned child—lit. ‘breast/milk-eater’)—

cf. the nominalised verb nimarav ‘eating’.

4.1.4.3 Noun Compounding
4.1.4.3.1 Reduplication Nouns may be partially or completely reduplicated. So far, I have observed three meanings indicated by the
reduplication.

1. The reduplication may signify plurality with the parts being considered individually.

142) kuvik3 other.side
‘other.side’

kuvik kuvik RDUP+other.side
‘each side’

2. The reduplication may indicate a diminutive form.

143) dawa house
‘house’

dawa + dawa RDUP+house
‘small house’

3. The reduplication may indicate a derived adverb form.

144) riwaro nothing
‘nothing’ (N)

riwi+riwaro RDUP+nothing
‘aimlessly’ (ADV)

4.1.4.3.2 Coordinate Compounds
Maia has a few coordinate compound nouns where the two conjuncts have equal status. Clitics can only be attached to the final noun.

muado nanum muado nanumat u-buae u-namo uvav ikav Vovol Koiam aba okok aba siwar

man + woman man + woman=COM 3s-father + 3s-mother=TP fire + tobacco wind + light place + area place + sky

= people = with the people = 3s-parents = smoke = Holy Spirit = everywhere = the sky

Siwar ‘sky/opening’ never occurs without aba ‘place’, i.e., aba siwar ‘sky/heavens’

3 There is also a non-numeral quantifier 5.3.2 and an indefinite pronoun 5.4.4, kuvik, having a somewhat different meaning.

August 2010

41

4.1.4.3.3 N+N Compounds
The construction with a noun premodifying the head noun is an extremely productive feature of the Maia noun phrase. Some of these closely related combinations have become compound words or are well on their way to becoming compounds. When used as below, the first noun is never post-modified, and clitics can only attach to the second noun.

ida+wag ivor+wag kakape+yag milal salel nanam umunuv u-kum usala umu muado u-ram muado

land + canoe sea + canoe bee + water clearing + shelter tree + 3s-heart 3s-head + dry branch bow + man 3s-middle + man

= car = ship = honey = open house [Pidgin: hauswin] = money (also: nanam umado/ nanam wiv) = firstborn = policeman = priest

4.2 Verbs
4.2.1 Verb Stems
The verb stem types in Maia are: 1. The Simple Verb Stem (consisting of a single root morpheme). 2. The Compound Verb Stem (consisting of two root morphemes—either two different morphemes or a reduplicated morpheme). 3. The Derived Verb Stems (as a result of derivational processes)

4.2.2 Verb Transitivity
Final verbs are classed according to transitivity—i.e., whether transitive or intransitive. Transitive verbs take two arguments, a subject and an object; intransitive verbs do not take an object. The transitivity of the transitive verbs in Maia may be a scalar rather than a discrete property. If so, the verbs higher in transitivity would require the person/number object prefix with all the persons; with verbs lower in transitivity, the 3s object marking is often zero. Another possible analysis is that the animacy of the object determines the presence or absence of the 3rd person object marking, see 4.2.3.3.8 This requires more study.

4.2.2.1 Transitive Verbs
The object of a transitive verb is the recipient of the action, i.e., either the direct or indirect object, depending on the verb. It is marked by a person/number prefix immediately preceding the verb root.
Highly transitive verbs found thus far are:

-de -ese -miase -nabase -nade -sora -supe

‘-tell’ ‘-give’ ‘-follow’ ‘-help’ ‘-feed’ ‘-come.to’ ‘-bring’

147) Muado ono-na-di wi-nor muata u-mias-a. man D1-ATN-CT 3p-INTP custom 3s-follow-RL.3s
‘That man followed their custom.’ [prefix = direct object]

In most transitive verbs the 3rd person singular object prefix is normally a null element. In addition. the 3rd plural prefix is null when refering to inanimate objects.

148) U-muda ø-baim-a. 3s-eye 3s-close-RL.3s
‘He closed his eye.’

149) Muania ono ø -bes-a

151) Muakit arop ø -bese-g-a. knife three hold-IMP-3s ‘He/she is holding three knives.’

4.2.2.2 Intransitive Verbs Intransitive verbs are those which cannot take an object. Intransitive verbs often encode motion or uncontrolled
states or processes.
152) ...dumag avia-mi. ...hunting go-RL.1p ‘we went hunting.’

154) Set=i arime-sa muado-n-a. Seth=CT grow.up-SEQ man-VR2-RL.3s
‘Seth grew up and became a man.’

4.2.3 Verb Morphology
Verbs can be derived from other parts of speech 4.2.3.1.1 - 4.2.3.1.2 ; or, from other verbs through suffixes 4.2.3.1.4 - 4.2.3.1.3 ; or, reduplication. New verbs can also be made by compounding,
Maia verbs occur in medial and final forms according to their suffixation. Final verbs are fully inflected for person, number, and mood, (4.2.3.3.3). Medial verbs are marked with a medial verb suffix only. They have no other inflection, (4.2.3.3.2).

4.2.3.1 Verb Derivation
4.2.3.1.1 Derived Active Verbs A number of active verbs, either transitive or intransitive, may be derived from other parts of speech (mostly
nouns) by the verbalizing suffixes -a or -e. These are glossed as VR1 in the examples.

155) imar assembly ‘a meeting’

imar-a-go-mo assembly-VR1-IPF-1s/3p ‘they were meeting’

(intransitive)

156) wadib argument
‘an argument’

wadib-e-ge-me

(intransitive)

argument-VR1-IPF-RL.2p

‘you were arguing’

157) saki talk
‘a talk /a speech’

saki-a talk-VR1
‘talk / speak’

(intransitive)

158) iwi number
‘a number’

iwi-e count-VR1
‘count (something)’

(transitive)

There are a couple of examples of a derived verbs being formed from the adverb ov ‘here’, however the use of this verb is restricted to a serial verb phrases with the verbs de ‘tell’ or (n)ane ‘say’, see 6.2.3.1.2 Generic ‘Demonstrational’ Phrases. The derived form ova never occurs alone as a verb. It looks as though this form may have its origin in a quoted speech clause, which has been grammaticized into a verb form. In its original form, ov was probably the object of the speech clause.

4.2.3.1.2 Derived Stative Verbs
Stative verbs may be formed when the verbalizer -(n)a (glossed as VR2) is suffixed to certain nouns or adjectives. This verbalizer has most likely arisen from the intransitive verb (n)ane ‘say’ and has become a frozen form. These verbs denote a state or attribute, being reported with the knowledge/assumption that this current state resulted from a change of state (conceived of as not being under the control of an agent).
There is at least one example of -ga (also glossed VR2) as a verbalizer, (164). It’s possible other examples exist using this form, but the data is insufficient to prove it.
Stative verbs are also formed by an adjunct verb phrase construction consisting of a noun or adjective plus the verb (n)ane ‘say.’ For more on this, see Section 6.2.3.1.1 The Generic ‘Report’ Phrase.
The choice of whether to use the abbreviated derivational suffix -na with a noun or adjective, or the verb nane ‘say’ in an Adjunct+Verb Phrase construction, is not predictable, being lexically determined.

4.2.3.1.3 Derived Causative Verbs
Causative verbs may be formed from existing verbs by the addition of causative suffixes. These morphemes are suffixed to the verb stems to increase the valency of the verbs. Positionally, they occur immediately following the verb root and preceding the distributive suffix. There are four classes of causative transitivizers. The choice of class is unpredictable. There is no apparent phonological, grammatical or semantic pattern for choosing one class over another; they seem to be lexically determined. The four classes are as follows:

Class I Class II Class III Class IV

-tate -te -rate -de

(glossed as CAU1) (glossed as CAU2) (glossed as CAU3) (glossed as CAU4)

Class I causatives, glossed as CAU1, are used frequently. There is quite a bit of unpredictable morphophonemic variation at the initial boundary of this morpheme. Sometimes there is no change at all (166),

45

sometimes the final vowel of the simple stem conforms to the first vowel of the causative (167), and sometimes the final vowel of the simple stem drops off in the causative form (168). And again, the derived process verbalizer may completely drop off after an adjective when the causative is attached (169); sometimes it only partially drops off (170). Each form is lexically determined; occasionally a form varies from speaker to speaker.

pepe-na unknown-VR2
‘forget’ [intr]

pepe-n-tate unknown-VR2-CAU1
‘cause to forget’ [tr]

The Class II causative, -te (glossed as CAU2), is also one of the more frequently used causatives. It, too, has unpredictable morphology at its initial boundary. Some speakers have indicated that the Class II causative -te is simply an abbreviated form of the Class I causative -tate. Since we haven’t been able to prove that, it remains Class II.

The verb (n)ane ‘say’ is reduced to (n)a in a causative construction. Therefore, the causative form of (n)ane is (n)ate ‘cause to say’, which only occurs in a serial form. This pattern is fairly regular. An exception is example (175) where the regular form is semantically unfeasible, and an irregular form creates a new word. A couple of other exceptions were noted where both the regular form and the Class I -tate form were acceptable, having the same meaning , see example (178). In the two examples of verbs formed from body parts (176), (177), only the causative form is semantically feasible.

178) kuarak+ane hang.up+say
‘be hung up’

kuarak+a-te hang.up+say-CAU2
‘cause to be hung up’

kuarak-tate hang.up-CAU1
‘cause to be hung up’

The Class III causative -rate (glossed as CAU3) occurs on fewer verbs.

179) wakan difficult
‘difficult’

wakan-a difficult-VR2
be/become.difficult

wakan-rate difficult-CAU3
‘make something difficult’

180) dedega be.afraid
‘be.afraid’

dedeg-rate afraid-CAU3
‘frighten.somebody’

The Class IV causative, -de (glossed CAU4), occurs occasionally. It seems to have arisen from the Class I transitive verb -de ‘say’ which has since grammaticized into a causative suffix, example (181). As a verb, de normally requires an object prefix, but this has dropped out in the grammatization process. Sometimes a change in the causative class indicates a semantic change, see example (182).

4.2.3.1.4 Derived Distributive Verbs
The distributive derivational morpheme, -lava , forms a verb of manner and refers to a repeated event that applies to a different entity each time, e.g., u-vede-lava ‘he looked around at them (meaning individually, i.e., one at a time).’
The distributive morpheme is optional and occurs following the causative derivational suffix (if present) and preceding the inflectional suffixes. With an Intransitive Verb, the referent is the Subject (185); with a Transitive Verb, the referent is the Patient, (183), (184), and with a Ditransitive Verb, the referent is the Recipient, (186).

4.2.3.1.5 Reduplication
Verb roots may be partially or completely reduplicated. Verb reduplication broadly indicates an augmented action which may include a greater, more massive, more intensified or very often a repetitive form of the action. Or, it may carry a figurative meaning as in example (189).
The common morphological tendencies are: (1) reduplication of the initial syllable, or (2) in the case of serial constructions, full reduplication of the initial root of a serial verb phrase.

Reduplication of the initial syllable only:
187) bua+buade ‘RDUP+break’ ‘break up (into different groups, pieces, etc.)’

188) gu+gubue RDUP+fold ‘repeatedly fold’ (bend, or break down into pieces)
189) ir+ire RDUP+go.up ‘To compete or try to out-do another person (e.g. gaining one-upmanship); to put yourself forward, etc. [a fig. meaning]
Full reduplication of the initial root of a serial verb:
190) nanav=o ipua+ipua+sano-go-mo food=TP RDUP+peel+put-IPF-1s/3p ‘they peeled food (repeatedly, massively)’
191) ø -pak+pak+a-to-mo 3s-RDUP+hit+say-CAU2-RL.1s/3p ‘they beat him (i.e., hit repeatedly)’
192) pirik+pirik+a-t-ido RDUP+turn+say+CAU2-IR.3s ‘he will roll (it)’

Inherently repeated actions: Some words indicate inherently repeated actions. An unreduplicated form does not exist.

4.2.3.2 Verb Compounding
Compound verbs consist of two independent verbs which function semantically as a single verb. While resembling and originating from serial verb constructions, compound verbs have become phonologically one word—i.e., having one stress and one intonation. Maia speakers perceive them as one word, and don’t seem to recognize the two parts. Like serial verbs, these compound verbs consist of a stripped down verb root with no suffixation allowed, followed by a second verb which carries the full inflection. Only the first verb root is allowed to take an object prefix, and negation must precede the whole compound.
One set of compound verbs begins with the verb root ta ‘get/take’, followed by an intransitive motion verb. As ta requires an object, it transitivizes the verb phrase, giving it a causative meaning. (In the normal causative construction, the causative marker occurs as a derivational suffix.) On these ta compound verbs, the 3rd person singular object prefixation is always a Ø morpheme.

193) ø-ta+gad-a 3s-get+come.down-RL.3s ‘he/she lowered it’
194) ø-ta+ilik-a 3s-get+come.up-RL.3s ‘he/she produced it’

wi-ta+ilik-a 3p-get+come.up-RL.3s
‘he/she produced them’

Another compound verb begins with the transitive verb root wa ‘shoot (something)’ and is followed by the transitivized verb pirik+a+te (turn+say+CAU2) ‘turn (something)’. The combined meaning of wa+pirikate is ‘to roll something over.’

4.2.3.3 Verb Inflection
4.2.3.3.1 Object Prefixes
Prefixes occur on transitive verbs which agree in person and number with the object.
See Section 5.4.1.2 Pronoun Prefixes for a list of these, and Section 4.2.2 Verb Transitivity for information on co-occurrence restrictions.
The animacy level of the object seems to determine whether the 3rd person object marking on the verb is zero (ø), or, is marked by u ‘3s’ or wi ‘3p’. For example, with the verb nime ‘eat’, the 3rd person prefix is normally zero when the object is food(s) (i.e., - animate). However, when speaking about lions eating live people (i.e., + animate), the 3p prefix was required. In another example, with the verb malipa ‘work’: in most cases the 3s object is marked as zero, as in (195) and (196), because the object is inanimate. But, in cases where the object is a human, spirit or animal (i.e., + animate), it must be marked with u ‘3s’ or with wi ‘3p’. And, if the object is a phrase like maiamaia badaka ‘all things’ and is known to include animate things, the 3rd person prefix is also used. For plural animate objects, however, often it doesn’t seem to matter whether the singular or plural person marker is used, as in (197), (198). We’ve noticed this irregularity time and time again. This animacy restriction would mean that semantically some verbs would never have an animate object (e.g. daeve ‘dig’) so, would always be marked with a zero prefix.
However, not all examples in the data consistently follow this pattern, so more investigation needs to be done on this.

4.2.3.3.2 Medial Verbs The elements of the medial verb are positioned as follows:

+/- Object Pronoun Prefix +/- VERB STEM +/- Medial Verb Inflection

Medial verbs are dependent verbs. They normally occur only in the non-final clause in sentences (see section 8.1.1.4.1.1 entitled The Mental Speech + Result Clauses for a permissible exception to this normal pattern). Medial verbs in Maia may be identified by the presence of the medial linking suffixes –sa or -game immediately following the verb stem, and by the absence of the portmanteau mood/person/number inflections which are found only on the finite verb.

Since the medial verb specifications for mood/person/number are drawn from the nearest following finite verb

the same subject in both verbs is always assumed. The two medial verb suffixes also encode a temporal relationship

between the medial and the final clause: -sa assumes a relationship of temporal succession;

-game assumes a

relationship of temporal overlap.

In the area of temporal overlap, unlike other verbs, the medial verb form of ige ‘to be’, makes a lexical distinction between the habitual and continuous aspects. The habitual form, ige-game, describes a situation which is viewed as a charateristic feature of a whole time period, e.g., He was (habitually/characteristically) a good man; while the continuous form, ig-ame ‘be-SIM’, describes a situation viewed internally in its duration in time, e.g. He was sick (for a week).

Clitics indicating a temporal or conditional relationship may occur post-positionally to -sa and -game. These are: =(w)aka; =ra ; and, =no. (See under Section 3 entitled CLITICS for more information).

4.2.3.3.3 Finite Verbs The Maia verb inflection shows Austronesian influence in that Mood and Aspect are marked rather than tense.
The closest language studied so far, Mauwake, has three tenses and hardly any realis-irrealis distinction.4 But, unlike the Austronesian languages, Maia uses only suffixes and not prefixes for the mood/number markings.
The positional arrangement of the finite verb in the realis and irrealis moods is as follows:
+/- Object Pronoun Prefix + VERB STEM + Aspect -ø /-g /-s + Mood/Subject/Number
Finite verbs are independent and occur in the final clause of a sentence, but they can also occur in non-final clauses. Finite verbs consist of a verb root or stem, plus inflectional suffixes. The person and number of the object is marked by prefixation. As stated above, transitive verbs differ in their requirement concerning the object prefix (4.2.2).
The types of regular inflectional suffixation found on the finite verb is represented in the following diagram:

4.2.3.3.4 Realis Mood
The realis mood indicates a realized action, process or state. It is divided into three aspects: the perfective, imperfective, and prospective. The perfective aspect is left unmarked [ø], the imperfective aspect is marked by the suffix [-gV], and the prospective aspect is marked by [-sV]. The aspect marker is followed by a portmanteau suffix signaling the realis mood and the person and number of the subject. At the initial boundary of the portmanteau suffix, morphophonemic changes often occur. See Section 2.2 for information on the morphophonemic rules.
4.2.3.3.4.1 Realis Perfective Aspect
The unmarked perfective aspect indicates a view of a given (actual) situation as being a single, complete event. The whole action is viewed from the outside with no explicit reference to the various temporal phases that make up the complete event. (Comrie 1976: 16-24) Semantically the realis perfective aspect encodes the idea of + past.

4.2.3.3.4.2 Realis Imperfective Aspect
The realis-imperfective aspect indicates a view giving ‘explicit reference to the internal temporal structure’ of a given situation. (Comrie 1976:24) The inside of the situation is exposed so that the speaker views the successive temporal phases occurring within it. Concerning imperfectivity, Comrie also has this to say: ‘In traditional grammars of many languages with a category covering the whole of imperfectivity, the impression is given that the general area of imperfectivity must be subdivided into two quite distinct concepts of habituality and continuousness. Thus one is told that the imperfective form expresses either a habitual situation or a situation viewed in its duration...this approach fails to recognise that these various subdivisions do in fact join together to form a single unified concept, as is suggested by the large number of languages that have a single category to express imperfectivity as a whole, irrespective of such subdivisions as habituality and continuousness.’ (1976:26)
In Maia, too, the imperfective aspect of the finite verb combines the semantic values of habituality and continuousness into a single, unified concept. Both habituality and continuousness describe a situation which involves an extended period of time and is viewed from within the situation. As stated above, the morpheme [-gV] marks the imperfective aspect, which is followed by a portmanteau marker indicating both the realis mood and person and number of the subject. The imperfective morpheme may be related to the verb ige ‘be’ which is used very often for the continuous aspect across languages.

4.2.3.3.4.3 Realis Prospective Aspect
The Realis Prospective Aspect5 indicates a present state in relation to some future action, and semantically implies imminence and certainty. It is, therefore, realis from the speaker’s perspective. Some approximate English correlates to the prospective aspect are the expressions: to be going to, to be about to, or to be on the point of doing something.
The morpheme marking this aspect is normally [-sV] except for 3s which is always marked by [-su]:

4.2.3.3.5 The Irrealis Mood
The irrealis mood indicates an unrealized action, process or state. Semantically, it encodes the idea of future and other modal concepts such as necessity, importance, permission, condition, etc. ‘Any future event is potential rather than actual...,’ and ‘In practice many languages do not distinguish between future tense and potential (irrealis) mood.’ (Chung & Timberlake 1985: 243) In Maia, the irrealis mood is divided into the perfective and the imperfective aspects.
4.2.3.3.5.1 Irrealis Perfective Aspect
The Irrealis Perfective Aspect indicates events which the speaker views as potentially possible, but does not presume to be certain as to their future fulfillment.
The unmarked [ø] perfective aspect indicates a view of a potential situation as being a single, complete event
and is viewed from the outside with no reference to the phases that make up the event. (Comrie 1976: 16-24) Because the fulfullment of the situation is potential and therefore uncertain, there are several degrees of possibility that it may or may not be fulfilled. The irrealis perfective encodes the English ideas of must, should/shall, will or may (i.e., expectation).

211) Yag sek ta-sa irebu-ito. Water a.little get-SEQ come-IR.3p
‘They will get a little water and come.’

4.2.3.3.5.2 Irrealis Imperfective Aspect
Like the realis imperfective above, the potential imperfective also has an internal and extended view of a situation with the combined concepts of habituality and continuousness. However, the situation is potential and not presumed to be actual. And there are, again, several degrees of possibility depending on the attitude of the speaker. As stated above, the morpheme [-gV] marks the realis-imperfective aspect (vowel deletion rule applies), which is followed by a portmanteau marker indicating both the irrealis mood, and person and number of the subject.

212) Wae nanav gete-g-ini

di=na mam u-nau lov+an-ido di=na

garden food wait-IPF-IR.2s DS=ATN taro 3s-earlier good+say-IR.3s DS=ATN

mam suv-ini. taro pull-IR.2s
‘You must await the garden food, and the taro will be ready first, and you can pull the taro.’

4.2.3.3.6 The Imperative Mood
Finite verbs in the Imperative mood lack the normal affixation of the Realis and Irrealis moods. The Imperative Mood markers in Maia signal both an aspect distinction and a singular or plural number distinction. The aspect distinction is between perfective (singular or plural) and imperfective (singular or plural). The Imperative form in Maia is only a 2nd person form.

Perfective Aspect: Singular : -(r)uk = IMP.PF.s Bug-uk! = (You) Sit down! Avia-ruk = (You) Go! Nag-uk! = (You) look!

Plural: -re = IMP.PF.p Buge-re! = (You [pl.] ) sit down! Avia-re = (You [pl.] ) go! Nage-re!= (You [pl.] ) look!

55

Often the singular perfective forms are shortened when it is obvious to whom the command is directed. For example, aviaruk “(you) go” is shortened to aviar, irebuk is shortened to ireb, and naguk is shortened to nag.

Imperfective Aspect:

Singular

[ -goki = IMP.IPF.s ]

Bugegoki. = (You) keep on sitting down.

Aviagoki. = (You) keep on going.

Nagogoki. = (You) keep on looking.

Plural [ -geke = IMP.IPF.p ] Bugegeke = (You [pl.] ) keep on sitting down. Aviageke = (You [pl.] ) keep on going. Nagegeke = (You [pl.] ) keep on looking.

4.2.3.3.7 The Desiderative Mood
Finite verbs in the Desiderative mood also lack the normal finite affixation. They only signal a singular or plural number distinction in the first person. For information on reporting the desires/intentions of others (i.e., in the 2nd and 3rd person) see Section 6.2.2.5.1 The Desiderative ‘Report’ Serial Verb Phrase.
The first person singular is marked by -inek and the first person plural is marked by -inok. Verbs marked in the desiderative mood indicate a personal desire or intention on the part of an actor/s to perform an action. Desiderative clauses are either assertive or manipulative in nature, depending on which form is used.
The first person singular form expresses the speaker’s desire.

213) Gamavi, yag sek=aka es-uk

i lus-inek!

RCS water a.little=LIM give-IMP.PF.s DS drink-DES.s

‘Please, give me a little water ; I want to drink!’

The plural form takes on a hortatory meaning, expressing the desire of the speaker which includes the
addressee(s). It is a form of suggestion, even a rather strong suggestion, to urge someone to do something along with the speaker (i.e., let’s do something...), as opposed to the more forceful 2nd person Imperative form There is no 1st person in the Imperative form in Maia.

214) Ne=mate sak+u-s-a

di ig-ame padir-a bada o-nor u-yamun

do=MN talk+3s-give-RL.3s DS be-SIM get.up-RL.3s SS 3s-INTP 3s-younger.sibling

sak+u-s-a,

‘Ireb

talk+3s-give-RL.3s Come.IMP DS bush go-DES.p

‘Hei spoke to him like that and hej stayed for a while and got up, after that, hej spoke to hisj younger brother, ‘Come, let’s go to the bush’ (lit. I want us to go to the bush.’)

4.2.3.3.8 Person Marking
Maia distinguishes the 1st, 2nd and 3rd person in singular and plural. There is no gender distinction, nor is there inclusive/exclusive distinction in the lst person plural form.

56

August 2010

215) Wat=o yo=di ø-tavø-io. pig=TP 1s=CT 3s-get-IR.1s ‘The pig, I will get it.
216) Maia ruva-g-ia? what search.for-IMP-RL.2s ‘What are you looking for?
217) Yo=no nae=di yo-mare-de-me. 1s=TP 2p=CT 1s-deceit-CAU4-RL.2p ‘To me, you (plural) lied.’
218) I-nor awun maia=di wat kani onor ono dibo-mo. 1p-INTP dog PL=CT pig big INTS2 D1 chase-RL.1s/3p ‘Our dogs chased the/that very big pig.’
219) Nanam maia buase+ni-s-ito. tree PL cut+2p-give-IR.3p ‘They will cut trees for you.’

Occasionally we see a change of marking in the third person (singular or plural) form, so that, in some cases,
the person and number of the subject does not agree with the person and number marked on the final verb inflection (220), or else the subject is unidentified, being culturally understood (221). In these cases, an irregular 3rd person
subject (singular or plural) is marked on the verb to express a more generic or unidentified subject.

220) ...muado da=no=di me+da yo parar+an-ito

nane-sa.

...man AD2=TP=CT NEG+AD2 1s knowledge+say-IR.3p say-SEQ

‘...thinking, one person (they) will not know me.’ [indefinite & non-referential subject]

221) Di wae malip-ø-a=yag

bada muanigo nanav=at igi-mi.

DS garden work-VR1-RL.3s=COLL SS now/today food=COM be-RL.1p

‘And the gardens were worked (collectively), and now we have food.’

or, ‘And (the group) worked the garden, and now we have food.’

[Note: In the first clause of (221), 3s is used to refer generically to an unidentified group. This group is not mentioned at all elsewhere in the story ; it is culturally understood. Following the first clause, the same-subject switch reference marker bada is used, since the 1p marking of the second finite verb is referentially the same as the collective group.]

4.3 Adjectives
While nouns and adjectives are quite similar in Maia, there seems to be enough grammatical evidence to posit a separate lexical class for adjectives. Morphologically, nouns and adjectives basically look alike. They are both uninflected, except that (+human) nouns can take the collective person suffix =yag, whereas adjectives cannot.
Syntactically only nouns occur as the head of a NP; adjectives do not. The cases in which adjectives seem to be functioning as a head noun are cases of ellipsis in which the head noun can be recovered from the text or by some other definite referential means. Both nouns and adjectives may be pre-modified by the diminisher word sek=aka

August 2010

57

‘little=LIM’, however, preceding an adjective, the diminisher modifies only the head of the phrase, while preceding a noun, it modifies the complete NP.
Still, there are times when the distinction between a noun and an adjective is fuzzy. A number of words may be used as either depending on their syntactic position in the clause. For example ubi may be used as the head of a NP meaning ‘weight’, or ubi may be used as the head of an Adjective Phrase meaning ‘heavy’. Likewise, yana may be a noun meaning ‘length’, or an adjective meaning ‘long’; or, toromo may be a noun meaning ‘youth’ or and an adjective meaning ‘young’. In such cases, the word is given different word class entries in the lexicon. Both nouns and adjectives may become verbalized when occurring in the predicate position. See 4.2.3.1.2 Derived Stative Verbs.
Adjectives occur as the head of an Adjective Phrase.
Adjectives form an open lexical class. There seem to be two classes of adjectives.

4.3.1 Class I Adjectives
Class I adjectives have no affixation. Below is a representative list of adjectives which are opposites:

kani isav gigir lov wene katok ubi

‘big’ ‘hot’ ‘black’ ‘good’ ‘sharp’ ‘wild’ ‘heavy’

/ upam / dilak / waiya / lamua / ubu / nebav / vavatal

‘small’ ‘cold’ ‘white’ ‘bad’ ‘dull’ ‘tame’ ‘light.weight’

These adjectives, as well as other adjectives without antonyms, may also form their opposite meanings by simply negating the positive form of the word, (224).
The word upam ‘small’ has a diminuitive suffix -ikol which changes the word to ‘very small’ or ‘tiny’ (223). It is the only word which takes this suffix.

222) Av upam iwo nag-uk. Village small D2L look-IMP.PF.s
‘Look at that small village over there.’

223) Ono av upam-ikol o-nor, ono+nane lov=aka ig-io." D1 village small-DIM 3s-INTS D1+say well be-IR.1s
‘That’s a very small village so I will be safe.’

224) ...nat me upam gad-a. ...rain NEG small come.down-RL.3s ‘It rained hard.’ (lit. A not small rain came down.)
4.3.2 Class II Adjectives
There is a small group of adjectives that look like inalienably possessed nouns prefixed in the 3rd person. However, the prefix never changes no matter what the person and number of the head noun is. And, this prefix always drops off whenever the adjective is used as a verbalized predicate adjective (227).6

6 This prefix has also been observed on one noun u-rukuv ‘darkness’ and on the time words u-naro ‘afternoon’ and u-nau ‘before’. U-nau ‘before’ is one word which has been observed to occur both with or without the prefix. These words, too, drop the prefix when verbalized. The only other prefixes in Maia are person/number prefixes on the inalienably possessed nouns, object prefixes on verbs, and an emphatic prefix on personal pronouns.

58

August 2010

The use of this particular prefix is of Austronesian origin. In Austronesian languages adjectives of this type are quite common.

u-dogo u-gugum u-kabu u-kiav u-koro u-kuali u-matin u-muili u-nait u-puari u-suwa

‘3s-straight’ ‘3s-thick’ ‘3s-short’ ‘3s-old (inanimate)’ ‘3s-dry’ ‘3s-dirty’ ‘3s-soft/gentle/quiet’ ‘3s-clean’ ‘3s-tabooed’ ‘3s-hard/tough’ ‘3s-white’

225) nanam u-kabu tree 3s-short
‘short tree’

226) ... nabu i e nanam u-dogo lov+lov ono buase-sa... ...bamboo Q or tree 3s-straight RDUP+good D1 cut-SEQ
‘...cut some very straight bamboo or trees and...’

227) Di=na

u-wabo surud-a

di dogo-n-a.

DS=ATN 3s-hand put.forth-RL.3s DS be.straight-VR2-RL.3s

‘‘And he put forth his hand and it became straight.’’

4.3.3 Colour Adjectives
Maia recognizes 5 colour groups:

waiya / usuwa gigir koborum kedat giligelum

‘white, silver (i.e. any shiny/metallic colour)’ ‘black’ ‘green’ ‘red, reddish brown’ ‘yellow, gold, dark orange’

Variations of these basic colours may be described in various ways. For example, a true red will be described as kedat onor, meaning ‘very red’, while pink may be described as me kedat onor ‘not very red’. The word kales ‘light (colour)’ modifies the colour word by lessening or varying the normal colour meaning in some way. For example, kedat kales is ‘light red’ and giligelum kales is used to describe ‘orange’. In some colour words, a reduplicated form serves to diminish, rather than intensify, the meaning of the basic colour. The reduplicated forms are as follows:

waiya+waiya gigi+gigir kobo+koborum kede+kedat

‘less than white, i.e., off-white’ ‘less than black, e.g., dark grey, brown’ ‘less than green, i.e., light green’ ‘less than red, e.g., pink’

August 2010

59

Another borrowed word is also used to describe colour:

aligam

yellow (borrowed word)7

The colours vere ‘blonde’ and bemu ‘brown’ and tawur ‘ashes’ (i.e. grey, or a mixture of black and white) are used to describe human or animal hair. The reduplicated form of tawur (i.e. tawur+tawur) means ‘less than grey’ or ‘light grey’.

4.3.4 Reduplication of Adjectives
Adjective roots may be partially or completely reduplicated. The reduplication may indicate augmentation, plurality, or diminishment, depending on the word being reduplicated. Partially reduplicated words follow different patterns depending on the CV pattern of the root or stem.

Augmentation:
228) yana long ‘long’

yana+yana RDUP+long
‘very long’

229) lov good
‘good’

lov+lov RDUP+good
‘very good’

230) isav hot
‘hot’

isav+isav RDUP+hot
‘very hot’

Plurality:
231) nanam kani tree big ‘big tree’
232) eger kind ‘kind’ / ‘type’

nanam kani+kani tree RDUP+big ‘big trees’
eger+eger RDUP+kind ‘several kinds’

233) upam small
‘small’

up+upam RDUP+small
‘small (pl.)’

This partially reduplicated form with a VCVC pattern drops the final VC on the first part of the reduplicated form.

7 In Mauwake ligam means ‘turmeric’ (a yellow root used for seasoning), and also ‘yellow’.

60

August 2010

234) u-koduwa 3s-short
‘short’

u-ko+koduwa 3s-RDUP+short
‘short (pl.)’

This partially reduplicated form retains the person prefix u- on the first form but drops it on the second, reduplicating only the first syllable of the root.

Diminuation:
235) isav hot ‘hot’

is+isav RDUP+hot
‘not very hot’ / ‘warm’

This follows the same pattern as (233) above.

236) dilak cold
‘cold’

dili+dilak RDUP+cold
‘not very cold’

A word with a CVCVC pattern drops the final VC on the first part of the reduplicated word, plus changes the final vowel in the first part to conform to the following vowel in the second part of the reduplicated form.

Inherent reduplication –
Some words are inherently reduplicated. The unreduplicated form is non-existent. For example, boroboro which means ‘torn up’ or ‘ragged’.

4.3.5 Comparison of Adjectives
Adjectives may be compared (showing a differential relationship) by using two or more juxtaposed adjectival Topic-Comment clauses.
237) Garuk koduwa. Mela yana. Nora yana o-nor. Garuk short Mela long Nora long 3s-INTS ‘Garuk is short. Mela is tall. Nora is very tall.’
Another way to express differential contrast is by using the verb raraide ‘surpass’.
238) Wedem=o alev koiam ono raraide-sa... sun=TP moon light D1 surpass-SEQ ‘The sun surpasses the light of the moon...’

5. MINOR WORD CLASSES

5.1 5.2 Adverbs
Adverbs occur either as the sole element or as the head of an Adverbial Phrase.
5.2.1 Temporal Adverbs
5.2.1.1 Simple Temporal Adverbs The Simple Temporal Adverbs include:

PRESENT TIME: RELATIVE TIME:
FREQUENCY:

muanigo muanigobav
migara bigima uru yoto anam unau wanamuda
kosov

‘today/now’ ‘just now’
‘tomorrow’ ‘the day after tomorrow’ ‘yesterday’ ‘the day before yesterday’ ‘later/after’ ‘earlier/before/long ago’ ‘another time’
‘always’

Some time adverbs must occur alone. They cannot occur in temporal phrases. The suffix -bav adds immediacy to muanigo ‘today/now’. This is the only word that uses –bav.
239) Yo=no muanigo uruwa irebue-sa... 1s=TP now/today morning come-SEQ... ‘I came this morning...’ (lit. I came now morning...)
240) Yo-nor emuar ono=na=di u-nau mene-sa di yo=no anam meneso-mo. 1s-INTP friend D1=ATN=CT 3s-earlier shoot-SEQ DS 1s=TP later shoot-RL.1s/3p ‘That friend of mine shot it first and I shot it afterwards.’
241) ...kosov yo=no nimo-go-mo. ...always 1s=TP eat-IPF-RL.1s/3p ‘...I always ate it.’

62

August 2010

5.2.1.2 Recurrence Adverbs
umuda means ‘recurring repeatedly/again’ only when followed by a number word + CAU2 suffix (e.g., umuda aropte ‘three times repeatedly’ or ‘the third time over’). The reduplicated form, i.e., umuda+umuda means ‘again and again.’

242) ...umud+umuda=no ata

lelaso-go-mo.

...RDUP+RCUR=TP coconut grate-IPF-RL.1s/3p

‘...again and again, they grate the coconut.’

To indicate the exact number of times something happens, Maia uses a numeral word affixed by the causative verb affix -te. This number word may occur with or without the recurrence word umuda.

243) iner-te two-CAU2
‘two times’

umuda arop-te RCUR three-CAU2
‘three times repeatedly’

5.2.2 Locative Adverbs
5.2.2.1 Derived Specific Location Adverb The following specific location words are derived from the basic demonstrative pronouns (see 5.4.2). They are
composed of a demonstrative pronoun plus a specific locational clitic =ga. These adverbs are not modifiable.

ovo=ga “PROX=LOC1” ono=ga “D1=LOC1”

ito=ga “D2U=LOC1” iwo=ga “D2L=LOC1” imo=ga “D2D=LOC1”

244) Ovo=ga

maia ta-g-ia?

PROX=LOC1 what get-IPF-RL.2s

‘What are you doing here?’

245) Ono=ga ig-omo. D1=LOC1 be-RL.1s/3p
‘They were there.’

246) O=no u-muda=no nambis imo=ga ruv-a ... 3s=TP 3s-eye=TP beach.BW D2D=LOC1 search.for-RL.3s
‘His eyes looked way down there to the coast.’

247) Tereter yabar ito=ga

avi-a.

Tereter bush D2U=LOC1 go-RL.3s

‘He went up there to Tereter bush.’

August 2010

63

5.2.2.2 Derived Non-Specific Location Adverbs
The vowel harmony rule applies when =ra is appended to the demonstrative pronouns, forming the non-specific location words. These adverbs are not modifiable.

ova=ra “PROX=LOC2” ona=ra “D1=LOC2”

ita=ra “D2U=LOC2” iwa=ra “D2L=LOC2” ima=ra “D2D=LOC2”

248) Di yo=no tete=no ova=ra

bada.

DS 1s=TP story=TP PROX=LOC2 finished

‘And my story is finished here.’

249) ...di awun maia=di ona=ra sinam-tato-mo. ...DS dog PL=CT D1=LOC2 stand-CAU2-RL.1s/3p
‘...and the dogs stood him up there.’

250) No=no n-ewer=at

n-abav=at

sikula iwa=ra

mina-sa

2s=TP 2s-in.law=COM 2s-older.brother=COM net D2L=LOC2 throw.out-SEQ

nawar wi-dib-iwe. fish 3p-chase-RL.2p
‘You, your in-law and older brother, throw out the net over there and round up the fish.’

5.2.3 Manner Adverbs
The semantic role of manner may be expressed by manner adverbs or Adverbial Phrases. These modify the action of the clause or sentence.

5.2.3.1 Nonderived Manner Adverb
Only one nonderived manner word (rakrak ‘crossly’) has been noted in the texts thus far. Most manner words are derived forms.

251) Me+da

rakrak no*-de-re.

NEG+AD2 crossly 2s*-tell-IMP.PF.p

‘Don’t tell him/her crossly.’

5.2.3.2 Derived Manner Adverbs The adverbial notion of manner is most often expressed by a noun, adjective, time word, or manner word
marked by the the limitation clitic =(w)aka. For more details see Section 3.1.2 Forming Derived Manner Words.
252) Bafalo yok ono sivar me lov=aka buadil-a. buffalo yoke D1 rope NEG good=LIM fasten-RL.3s ‘He did not fasten the rope of the buffalo yoke well.’

64

August 2010

Noun reduplication may also indicate a derived manner word. For example, the word riwaro means ‘nothingness’ or ‘nothing’ depending on whether it’s used as a noun or an adjective, but when reduplicated as riwiriwaro the function changes to an adverb meaning ‘aimlessly’ (as discussed in 4.1.4.3.1).

5.2.3.3 Indefinite Manner Adverb
The indefinite manner adverb ige+nemate ‘how’ [lit. be+do=MN] is the same form as the question word for ‘how’.

253) Di ono=ma ige+ne=mate napar eger+eger wi-nor anim ta-lava-mo

ono.

DS D1=EM be+do=MN animal RDUP+kind 3p-INTP name get-DIST-RL.1s/3p D1

‘And this is how the kinds of animals got their names.’

5.2.4 Additive Adverbs
5.2.4.1 Additive 1: bu
An additive word bu [glossed as AD1] roughly correlates to the English too, also, likewise. It is used when one proposition or consideration is being added to another—the two related ideas not necessarily being in the same sentence, see example (254). The additive bu never occurs at the beginning of a clause or sentence.
When bu is present in both of the related instances, the ideas are being considered separately and constrastively, but both are equally affirmed, as in example (256). When bu is only on the second of two related ideas, the second is being considered as additional information which may be equally affirmed with the information of the previous consideration (255), (257).
The particle bu may be followed by the emphatic clitic =ma (e.g. buma) when the speaker or writer wishes bu ‘also’ to have a stronger emphasis.

254) Di kalagid rabam ono=na=di Sodom=at Gomora=gat maiamaia da nanav maia DS king four D1=ATN=CT Sodom=COM Gomorrah=COM things AD2 food PL

‘She asked them like that, and her child told her, “I finished eating.” And her husband also said, “I, too, have finished eating.”’

5.2.4.2 Additive 2: da
The additive ‘da’ [glossed as AD2] can function as an adverb to mark a connection between a previous related or parallel constituent and the current one. It always immediately precedes the constituent that is in focus. However, it seems that one must infer from the context as to whether the meaning relates to a current time in addition to a previous one, i.e., meaning ‘one more time’ /’again’—or, whether it is simply focusing on a constituent that is parallel to a previously mentioned constituent.

258) Di muat ono da yag=ra

‘Also later, he made Eve as well using Adam’s bone.’ [*not, he made Eve again]

The word da ‘AD2’ is also used as a non-numeral quantifier, (5.3.2) ; and as an indefinite pronoun, (5.4.4), and as a coordinating conjunction, (5.5.1.1.1).

5.2.5 Modal Adverbs
5.2.5.1 Expressing Possibility or Uncertainty The notion of possibility or uncertainty is expressed by the word igena “perhaps”. It is possible that this

5.3 Quantifiers
5.3.1 Numeral Quantifiers
Maia numerals have a mathematical base of five (based on the hand). The numerals originally included:

duwa iner arop rabam igur

‘one’ ‘two’ ‘three’ ‘four’ ‘five’

262) O=no nada iner ig-a. 3s=TP child two be-RL.3s ‘She has two children.’
263) Yo=no kapopor arop nago-mo. 1s=TP butterfly three look-RL.1s/3p ‘I saw three butterflies.’

Combinations of the five numerals are added together to indicate the range of numbers up to ten, e.g. ‘igur kuvikra iner’ (i.e., ‘five plus two’) meaning ‘seven’. Nowadays, the Maia people have become used to the Pidgin/English numbering system and normally use this system with specific numbers past ten, and quite often with numbers past five.

264) Muga nada up+upam igur kuvik=ra

rabam.

Birdchild RDUP+small five other.side=LOC2 four

‘The chicken has nine little chicks.’

Numerals can be fully or partially reduplicated. The complete reduplication of numbers indicate a plurality with each numbered referent being considered separately as a unit. When the referent is one, the meaning is each one. When the referent is two, the meaning is two by two , etc.

265) duwa one ‘one’
266) iner two ‘two’

duwa+duwa RDUP+one ‘each one’ / ‘one by one’
iner+iner RDUP+two ‘two by two’

In this example, the partial reduplication of two indicates twice the size, amount, etc.

267) in+iner RDUP+two
‘double’

There are two other ways of counting which are used only for counting yams and sago. These are also based on five, but the five numbers are actually multiples of four (i.e. 1x4 to 5x4). The word isiv is a counting word used only for counting yams, and the word wanam is a counting word used only for counting sago.
Yams:

isiv duwa isiv iner isiv arop isiv rabam isiv igur

1= 4 2= 8 3 = 12 4 = 16 5 = 20

yams in a group yams in a group yams in a group yams in a group yams in a group

Sago is counted only after it has been placed inside a length of bamboo.

wanam duwa 1 = 4 wanam iner 2 = 8 wanam arop 3 = 12 wanam rabam 4 = 16 wanam igur 5 = 20

pieces of bamboo filled with sago “ ““ “ “ “ “ ““ “ “ “ “ ““ “ “ “ “ ““ “ “ “

5.3.2 Non-Numeral Quantifiers
Non-numeral quantifiers are a very small class of words used to indicate non-precise amounts of what the nouns which they modify refer to. They include the following:

u-da 1 ( da=no) kuvik/kivik badaka sek kumu kumukani maia
268) Yag sek water a.little ‘a little water’

3s-AD2 (AD2=TP) (meaning ‘a/one / another’) some/other all / every little (in volume, duration, extent etc.) a number of / several many PLURALIZER

u-da 3s-AD2

273) inor

awun maia

5.4 Pronouns
5.4.1 Personal Pronouns
5.4.1.1 Free Personal Pronouns The free personal pronouns are used as subjects (276), as appositional pronouns along with object prefixes
(277), and as possessive pronouns (278).

The person pronouns may be made emphatic by addition of the emphatic pronoun prefix ma-.8 In English, the equivalent “ma- pronouns” would simply receive a phonological stress-focus to make them emphatic. There is also an emphatic clitic =ma.

5.4.1.2 Pronoun Prefixes The person/number pronoun prefixes are as follows:

1s i- / yo2s ni- / no3s u- / o-/ ø

1p i- / [ii-] 2p ni- / [nii-] 3p wi-

Pronoun prefixes occur on transitive verbs to mark the object. They also form Intensified pronouns, Dual pronouns, Dative pronouns, Reflexive/Reciprocal object pronouns, and Number/Count pronouns when prefixed to the relevant morphemes. They also occur on inalienably possessed nouns to mark the possessor, and on position nouns (0). And, the 3s prefix occurs on class II adjectives (4.3.2), plus on a few serialized verb expressions which have become a compound form.

8 It was only recently discovered that the emphatic prefix can also occur on nouns.

With the singular prefixes, it seems that the choice of which alternative form to use is lexically determined. While there are some clear morphophonemic variations, there is no apparent grammatical or semantic pattern for choosing, for example, i- over yo-. More study of the phonology needs to be done in this area.
The 3s object marking is either u-/o- or zero, depending on how high the transitivity is (see 4.2.2.1).
Stress is normally on the second syllable. But, whenever a 1st or 2nd person plural is used, it is the prefix or first syllable that receives the primary stress. Whenever there is ambiguity and in order to clearly differentiate between first and second person singular and plural, the people have chosen to write the stressed plural prefix with a double vowel. In cases where there is no ambiguity, the single vowel is used.
There are a few other irregularities between person and number in the use of these prefixes. With a few words, the 3p prefix is used for 3s, e.g., the word winim can mean either ‘his name’ or ‘their names’. With a few verbs, the 2s is also used as the 3s form, e.g., with the verb de ‘say to’, the 2s prefix no- is most often used as 3s. In such cases, the correct meaning must be inferred by the context. In the examples, these irregular forms with non-default meanings are marked with an asterisk immediately following the prefix.

5.4.1.2.1 Prefixed Intensified Pronouns
Intensified Pronouns are formed by the morpheme -nor (glossed INTP) which is obligatorily marked by the pronoun prefixes.

1s-INTP 2s-INTP 3s-INTP

yo-nor no-nor
o-nor

1p-INTP 2p-INTP 3p-INTP

i-nor ni-nor wi-nor

Since intensification seems to be the pervasive meaning of this suffix, it is glossed accordingly for the purpose of consistency. Sub-categorically, -nor is used in three different ways:

1. Marking a POSSESSIVE relationship when followed by a possessed noun.

282) Yo-nor awun wi*-nim=o Dasti. 1s-INTP dog 3p*-name=TP Dasti
‘My dog’s name is Dasti.’

283) Di o-nor umu muado

maia wi-muayagas-a ...

DS 3s-INTP bow + man(soldier) PL 3p-send-RL.3s ...

‘And he sent his soldiers ...’

2. Used alone or following a proper name to make clear or to EMPHASIZE who is being referred to. In this function, it is only used as the Subject.

284) Yo-nor upam=at.... 1s-INTP small=COM
‘When I myself was small...’

3. When marked with the limitation clitic =(w)aka, these pronouns are used in an EXCLUSIVE sense to emphasize that someone was alone or did something without any help or interference from anyone else.

287) I=no Ii-buae=no God o-nor=aka ig-a ... 1p=TP 1p-father=TP God 3s-INTP=LIM be-RL.3s
‘Our Father is God alone...’

In addition to these meanings, the third person singular form of the intensified pronouns has a couple of specialized functions: (1) onor is used as an intensifier word in an Intensifier Phrase (see under Adjective Phrase, Section 6.1.1.4), and onor suffixed with the limitation clitic =waka (i.e., onoraka) is used as an adversative conjunct (see Section 5.5.1.1.3).

5.4.1.2.2 Prefixed Dual Pronouns
Dual pronouns are formed by the morpheme –rabe (glossed DU) which is obligatorily marked by the plural pronoun prefixes. Since there is no ambiguity in number (dual being a type of plural), the prefixes are spelled with a single vowel. The dual pronouns are:

1-DU 2-DU 3-DU

i-rabe ni-rabe wi-rabe

we two / the two of us you two / the two of you they two / the two of them

288) Di i-rabe wat ono unabo gaide-sa ta-sa av

‘God sent Adam and Eve away from the garden of Eden and they came up outside.’

5.4.1.2.3 Prefixed Dative Pronouns
Dative pronouns are formed by the dative pronoun root -sibe (glossed DAT) which is obligatorily marked by the pronoun prefixes. The 3s:DAT form changes to -sube to conform to the -u of the 3s person marker. The dative pronouns indicate the semantic roles of source or possessor, correlating in meaning with the English prepositions from or of. Dative pronouns are used for possessor only when the possessor is not coreferential with the subject of the clause. It always occurs immediately preceding the verb. A pronoun with a similar function is also found in Mauwake, a related language. (Järvinen, 1991:71-3)

5.4.1.2.4 Prefixed Reflexive/Reciprocal Pronouns
Reflexive/Reciprocal pronouns are formed by the Reflexive/Reciprocal pronoun morpheme -mu (glossed REFL) which is obligatorily marked by the pronoun prefixes.

1s-REFL 2s-REFL 3s-REFL

i-mu ni-mu u-mu

To distinguish the Reflexive from the Reciprocal meaning, an intensified pronoun is used together with the reflexive pronouns.
296) Yo-nor i-mu warupo-mo. 1s-INTP 1s-REFL hit-RL.1s/3p ‘I hit myself’ (or, ‘I myself hit myself.’)

5.4.1.2.5 Prefixed Number/Count Pronouns
Number/count pronouns are formed by the Number/count pronoun root mi (glossed NUM) which is obligatorily marked by the plural pronoun prefixes. They are always used in conjunction with a number for referring to more than one person or thing.

1-NUM 2-NUM 3-NUM

i-mi (+ number) ni-mi (+ number) wi-mi (+ number)

298) ni-mi arop 2p-NUM three ‘you three’
299) ni-mi kumukani 2p-NUM many ‘you many’

5.4.2 Demonstrative Pronouns
The demonstratives point out relative proximity or distance from the speaker. The proximal pronoun is composed of ov ‘here’ plus the topic marker (n)o and the distal-1 pronoun is composed of the 3rd singular free pronoun plus the topic marker (n)o. These two are frozen forms. An extra marker must be added to actually mark it as the topic (e.g. ovo=no, ono=no). The referential ‘pointing’ of the demonstratives labelled ‘level’ in the table below is not just confined to a spatial perception. They are also associated with cataphoric and anaphoric reference to participants in a discourse.
The following demonstratives may be used as a pronoun topic in a Topic-Comment clause or as demonstrative modifier in a NP. They may also be used to form locative adverbs when marked with the locative clitics, =ga or =ra (see sections 3.5 and 3.6). The proximal and distal-1 demonstrative pronouns may also be prefixed with the emphatic pronoun prefix ma- (see section 5.4.1 under Personal Pronouns):

The demonstrative ono ‘Distal-1’ is used on the clause level as a relative marker to mark the end of a relative clause, (7.6).
5.4.3 Interrogative Pronouns
Interrogative pronouns occupy the same position that the information being sought would normally occupy in a declarative sentence. In an interrogative sentence, there is a rising-falling intonation on the interrogative pronoun and level or falling intonation on the final verb.
The following are the interrogative words used in Maia with their meanings (in some cases, both their literal and interrogative meanings):

yao maia tipi tipina ige (lit. ‘be’)

= who = what = how much / how many = when / what time = where

When ige ‘be’ is used as an interrogative expression, the locative clitics or manner affix may be added to modify the meaning.

ige=ga (lit. ‘be’=LOC1) ige=ra (lit. ‘be’=LOC2) ige=mate (lit. ‘be’=MN)

= where (specifically) = whereabouts = how/what

A couple of the interrogative expressions are compound words.

5.5 Conjunctions
Maia conjunctions can be coordinate or subordinate, occurring either as free forms or as structurally dependent postpositional forms.
5.5.1 Coordinating Conjunctions
5.5.1.1 Free Coordinating Conjunctions All of the free coordinating conjunctions may be used to conjoin both phrases, clauses and sentences.

5.5.1.1.1 Additive Conjunction: da
The adverb da ‘AD2’ (refer to 5.2.4.2 ) may also be used as a coordinating conjunction. As a conjunction, the basic meaning is similar to ‘and’, ‘also’, ‘furthermore’, ‘in addition’. It may also indicate a parallel, or it may be used as a weak adversative conjunction (e.g. ‘and/but’). The focus of da may be narrow as in noun phrase coordination, or it may be much broader linking whole clauses or sentences, or even paragraphs.
It is used in the following ways:

11 The word maia is used in three ways: (1) as the non-numeral ‘PLURAL’ quantifier word (glossed ‘PL’), (2) as the interrogative word ‘what’, and (3) as the indefinite pronoun ‘what’.
12 In the other interlinearized examples, maia+maia is written as a compound form, maiamaia, and is glossed as ‘things’.

1. Linking NPs while, at the same time, marking the head of each NP as being considered as a separate or unequal entity, as in: [X da Y da Z] or [ X=(g)at da Y=(g)at ]. (For examples of these see under Section 6.1.4.1.) It may also join two separate coordinate NPs into another coordinate NP as diagramed below:

...tame=COM wild=COM AD2 RDUP+small=COM RDUP+big=COM

‘tame and wild as well as small and large’

2. Conjoining the last NP item in a coordinated NP list.

Ripa muado Daniel avia-mi. Ripa man Daniel go-RL.1p ‘I, my husband Kaudiga, my older sister Ripa, the village chief Kawulia, Ripa’s husband Daniel went.’

3. Conjoining clauses or sentences that have a semantically related, but possibly a new, topic.

334) Mamudia wae=ra

4. At the discourse level, it introduces a flashback to a previous time or a parallel situation.
5.5.1.1.2 Alternative Conjunctions 5.5.1.1.2.1 The Alternative Conjunction: e
The conjunction e (glossed as ‘or’) indicates an alternative. The first alternate element is, normally, but not always, marked with the polar question suffix -i and is joined to the next alternate element by the free alternative conjunction e ‘or’.
336) God=i me+da nim-iwe i e bes-iwe ii-d-a. God=CT NEG+AD2 eat-IR.2p Q or hold-IR.2p 1p-tell-RL.3s ‘God told us that you must not eat it or touch it.’
5.5.1.1.2.2 The Parallel Negative Alternative Conjunction: meda . . . meda ‘Meda’ and ‘meda’ are used preceding two parallel negative clauses—to show their parallel ‘neither...nor’
nature. In this structure, the verb still needs negation marking even if meda in itself is already negative.
337) Me+da muado nanum=at nanum u-da me sos-ini ; me+da nanum NEG+AD2 man woman=COM woman 3s-AD2 NEG pull-IR.2p NEG+AD2 woman

5.5.1.1.3 Adversative Conjunction: onoraka The adversative conjunction onoraka consists of the 3s Intensified Pronoun, o-nor, plus the limitation marker
=(w)aka. It is used to conjoin both clauses and sentences.

‘Now your name is not Abram, but Abraham...’

5.5.1.2 Bound Coordinating Conjunctions
The bound coordinating conjunctions are used on the NP level. They include: (1) the comitative clitic =gat ‘COM’ (Refer primarily to section 6.1.4.1 Coordinate Noun Phrases; also mentioned in 3.2.4); and, (2) the emphatic clitic =ma ‘EM’ (see Section 3.10.1 under The Emphatic Marker ‘ma’).

5.5.2 Subordinating Conjunctions
5.5.2.1 Free Subordinating Conjunctions The free subordinating conjunctions are used to conjoin both clauses and sentences.

5.5.2.1.1 Cause-Effect and Reason-Result
See section 8.2.1.2 for information on the linking adverbial speech ‘mini-clause’ Me[da] Maia+nane ‘NEG[AD2] + what+say’/ ‘not saying why’ (i.e., ‘because’). And, see section 8.2.1.3 for information on the linking adverbial speech ‘mini-clause’ Ono+nane ‘That+say’ (i.e., ‘therefore’/ ‘saying that’).

5.5.2.1.2 Negative Purpose
The word dano ‘AD2=TP’ or the compound ma+u-da ‘something+3s-AD2’ is used as a conjunction to relate contingent actions and/or events expressing an implied negative motivation or purpose. These conjunctions join clauses and sentences.
A contingency relationship exists between 1) a present action motivated by negative feelings (e.g., fear) and 2) a future (yet unrealised) action or event. The implied reason of the first clause is to prevent (or prepare someone for) the possible fulfillment of the latter action or event. In other words, the present action is contingent on the possibility of the future action or event being fulfilled. Therefore, clauses beginning with dano or ma uda use verbs in the irrealis mood. Approximate English correlates are: for fear (that) ... ; in case ... ; lest ; in order that...not ; If not... ; it wouldn’t be good if...

See also section 8.2.1.4 for Negative Purpose clauses.

5.5.2.2 Bound Subordinate Conjunctions
The bound subordinate conjunctions are used to conjoin both clauses and sentences. They include: =aka ‘LIM’, =ra ‘LOC2’, =no ‘TP’, and =git ‘CFT’. Used as a conjunctive device, =aka ‘LIM’ is discussed in section 3.1.3, =ra ‘LOC2’ in section 3.6.2, =no ‘TP’ in section 3.7.2 ; and, =git ‘CFT’ in section 3.9—with examples.

5.5.3 Conjunctions Indicating a Change in Topic
5.5.3.1 ega
Ega means “okay”, “all right” in the conjunction sense of the words. This conjunction is rarely used in narrative texts; instead, it is mostly used in logical arguments and indicates a logical progression.
In a social situation, it indicates that the speaker wants to end one activity and move on to the next. For example, in a village social situation, a number of people were gathered on our verandah to have their sores bandaged. When I finished with one person, a lady taught me to say, “ega uda...” as she gestured to the next person. In this situation, it meant something like “okay, next...”
The following example is about part of a ritual a father was instructing his son through to help him become a successful hunter of bandicoots.

342) Ega, maiamaia ovo ige+ne=mate ii-munuv utat-arav. Alright things PROX be+do=MN 1p-heart think-RL.1p

‘...He gave it to me, and told me, “Suck on its nose like a breast,” and I sucked on its nose. Then he told me, “Okay, it [i.e., the ritual] is finished.”’

5.5.3.2 aria
Aria is another discourse marker meaning something like “all right” or “okay”. It is used sentence initially as a common way to indicate the beginning of a new episode in a narrative, or to mark a change of theme. Aria is also a leave-taking device in a social situation. It’s a polite way to bid farewell and urge the person onward as he/she is about to leave.

5.5.4 Switch-Reference Markers
The words ‘bada’ and ‘di’ occur following a finite verb only. Both markers signal a continuity between two clauses—indicating that the previously asserted clause is now given/presupposed information and the clause following the boundary contains newly asserted information. They also mark whether or not the subject of the previous clause is identical to or different (in person and number) from the subject of the following clause.
Each of these markers may be followed by certain subordinating clitics or by the adverbial conjunction da ‘AD2’. If there are no conjunctions present, the specific semantic relationship between clauses must be inferred from the context. The temporal relationships may be interpreted differently between bada and di. A sequential relationship may sometimes imply a result as well.
When the switch-reference markers have a subordinating clitic attached, they are written clause finally. Otherwise, they are normally written clause initially.

5.5.4.1 Same Subject: bada
Bada [glossed SS] indicates subject person/number coreferentiality between two clauses, as in (345). However, an exception is the case of an ‘experience’ construction, (346) and (347), where the focus is off the grammatical subject and is on the state of an experiencer (see Section 8.6 ‘Experience Clauses’). Since the subject is an inanimate/impersonal one, thus low in topical status, it is ignored. The undergoer/object, then, becomes the participant which is tracked as being coreferential with the subject of the previous verb.
Aspectually, bada arises from a verb root meaning ‘finish’, and, therefore, marks the first clause as having a completive aspect. The temporal relationship between the two clauses is always one of sequence, and may sometimes imply a result as well (compare with the sequential medial verb, 4.2.3.3.2).
Bada may be marked by the subordinate conjunction =no ‘TP’ (3.7) , =ra ‘LOC2’ (3.6.2), and =git ‘CFT’ (3.9), but never by =(w)aka ‘LIM’. One would logically assume that *bada=ka ‘SS=LIM’ (if it indeed existed), would mark a same-subject relationship between two clauses in which the action of the first clause is immediately followed by an action in the second clause. However, this is not the case. Immediate temporal succession by the same subject is always handled by the medial verb suffix –sa ‘SEQ’ or –sa=ka ‘SEQ=LIM’, the latter of which marks an even greater immediacy in the succession of events. In fact, it seems that it is this immediacy in timing which determines whether a choice of a final clause followed by bada is used (being less immediate), or whether the medial (and more immediate) suffix –sa is used. If the timing is unclear, either choice seems acceptable.

DS 3p-heart perceive-IPF-RL.1s/3p SS shame 3p-shoot-IPF-RL.3s

‘Theya perceive their thinking and (theya) feel ashamed.’ (lit. ‘and shameb shoots thema.’)

5.5.4.2 Different Subject: di
Di [glossed as DS ] marks a lack of coreferentiality in the subject person and number between two clauses. Di is actually the same as the Contrastive Topic marker, di, except that it functions on the clause level as a switchreference marker. For this reason, I am calling it by a different name when used in this way. As with bada (Section 4.1.1 above), there is an exception in the switch-reference marking in the case of the so-called ‘experience’ clauses. See the following examples:

348) Di koiam ono nag-a bada u-munuv wavil-ø-a

di saki-ø-a, "…

DS light D1 look-RL.3s SS 3s-heart grease-VR2-RL.3s DS talk-VR1-RL.3s

‘He looked at the light and he (lit. his heart) was grease (lit. pleased) and he said, “…”’

The subject of the first verb ‘naga’ is different (literally/grammatically) from the subject of the second verb ‘wavila’, but because the latter is an inanimate/impersonal one, it is low in topical status, and therefore ignored as being non-coreferential. The second clause, then, is marked with the Same Subject switch reference marker bada, tracking the subject of the first clause as being coreferential with the object of the second clause. However, in reference to the verb of the third clause, the inanimate subject of the second clause remains the one against which the subject of the third verb “sakia” is tracked for coreference. Since the animate subject of the third verb is not coreferential with the inanimate/impersonal subject of the second clause, the third clause is marked as having a different subject. According to Foley, an exception like this in switch–reference marking is common for this type of construction in many Papuan languages. (1986: 190-191)
There is morphophonemic variation in this particle. Di occurs following a vowel and i following a consonant (350).
The temporal relationship could be interpreted as either a sequence (and perhaps result) following a perfective verb, as in (349). Or, when di occurs following the be-verb ige or following an imperfective verb, a relationship of temporal overlap (either partial or complete) is indicated.
As with bada (above), di may be marked with the bound subordinate conjunctions =no’TP’ (3.7), =ra ‘LOC2’ (3.6.2 ), =git ‘CFT’ (3.9). But, unlike bada, di may also be marked with the limitation marker =waka to mark a temporal relationship of immediate overlap.

5.6 Directional Preposition
The directional preposition, ta (glossed ‘DIR’), expresses a direction moving/pointing toward a location. This is the only preposition in Maia and is probably a borrowing of the Austronesian locative preposition ‘ta’. (Ross 1988: 104-106)

5.7 Negators
There are two negators in Maia: (1) me [or, meda] , and (2) weie.
5.7.1 The Negator ‘me[da]’
The negator me[da] is both a constituent and a clause negator. At this point in our studies, it is not clear what the difference in meaning is between me and meda and why one form is used instead of the other. In independent clauses the words are interchangable. In discourse, the same speaker uses both forms in close proximity, and when checking some stories, language helpers made changes from one form to the other to make it sound correct. So, there is a difference in meaning, though not very clear to me. I’m assuming that meda is actually a compound form of me ‘NEG’ + da ‘AD2’, and is perhaps used in discourse when referring to a negative but semantically similar topic (see this similar function when ‘da’ is used as the Additive Conjunction, in section 5.5.1.1.1). More study needs to be done on the discourse level. In interlinearized texts we gloss it as two separate morphemes forming a compound.

1. Clausal Negator: me[da] precedes the VP and the whole predication is in its scope.

weie lov. no INTS ‘Of all the men that went for sago, even one didn’t return to the village, absolutely none.’

2. Constituent Negator: me[da] precedes the constituent within its scope (other than the VP).
365) ...wi me+da Yuda muado+nanum... ...3p NEG+AD2 Juda man+woman(people) ‘....those non-Jewish people...’

366) Yo=no nanav me u-vin=aka

nim-io.

1s=TP food NEG 3s-quick=LIM eat-IR.1s

‘I will not eat quickly. (meaning “not in a hurry”— i.e., “I’ll eat slowly”)

367) Bafalo yok ono sivar me lov=aka buadil-a

di patak+an-a.

buffalo yoke D1 rope NEG good=LIM fasten-RL.3s DS lift.up+say-RL.3s

‘He did not fasten the rope of the buffalo yoke well, (so) it lifted up.’

(not well = it was fastened poorly)

3. Conjunction: Forming a Coordinate or a Subordinate conjunction.

August 2010

87

 Coordinate: ‘Meda ... meda’ are used preceding two parallel negative clauses to show their parallel ‘neither...nor’ nature. See under Section 5.5.1.1.2.2, example (337). In this case, me has never been observed to function as an alternative to me[da] possibly because of the coordination.

 Subordinate: Me (or meda) can precede the question word, maianane ‘why’, to form its counterpart, me maianane or meda maianane ‘because’—a subordinate conjunction. See under Section 8.2.1.2 Cause for examples.

4. Pragmatics: A positive statement can be emphasized by placing it following its negated counterpart.

368) ...muat me upam, kani lamua ono... ...snake NEG small big INTS D1
‘...this really huge snake... (lit., this not small, terribly large snake)’

369) Napar me upam, napar sawa kani. animal NEG small animal wallaby big
‘It was not a small animal; the wallaby was big!’

370) Yo-nor awun o-wag nag-arav=o me+da yana kani, o-nor o-wag=at 1s-INTP dog 3s-leg look-NOM=TP NEG+AD2 long big 3s-INTP 3-leg=COM

3s-arm=COM=TP 3s-RDUP+short

‘The look of my dog’s legs are not very long; his legs and arms are short!’

At times, the scope of the negator (me) may cross the clause boundaries marked by the switch reference markers bada and di, or by the clause boundaries marked by the medial verb markers –sa ‘SEQ’ and –game ‘SIM’. Often, the additional negator tag clause (weie) at the end of a sentence confirms that the sentence is negated even if the verb of the second clause is not marked by me[da].

In the following examples, the scope of negation is extended to two VPs. These sentences have an implied cause + effect relationship. It may be that if or since the first clause (the cause) is negative, the effect is also negative. Or, perhaps the scope is extendable because the subject of the second clause is related to some element in the first clause as indicated below.

374) ...tabum=aka me ø-warup-ito di um-ido. ...body=LIM NEG 3s-hit-IR.3p DS die-IR.3s

In the following example, the scope of the negator is only on the first verb. The negator + the verb in the imperfective.3s has an implied relationship of ‘still not’. In other words, the event of the first verb had still not occurred even up to the time of the action of the second. The subject of the second clause is unrelated to any element in the first clause, unlike the preceding examples.

5.7.2 The Negator ‘weie’
The uses of the negator, weie ‘no’, are summarized with examples below:
1. As a negative response to deny that something is true, is happening, or is the case (379); similarly, used as a negative response to a polar question (380); or, as a negative response refusing to comply with a request or command made by another person (381). It is also used to refute the presupposition in a question (382).

379) Migara av-ido. tomorrow go-IR.3s

5.8 Interjections

A! E-ei! Na! Sa-a!
Sanae! Ya!

an expression of feeling— with a range of uses, somewhat like ‘oh’ in English. an expression of surprise, joy. an attention-getting device. an expression of displeasure—often to children, pigs, dogs, etc. who are doing something they shouldn’t be doing in the eyes of the speaker; shows a low opinion of something. an expression of amazement, e.g. Wow! shouted when someone is doing something wrong, meaning something like ‘hey, stop that!’ Very similar to sa! (above).

5.9 Borrowed Words
Maia speakers have borrowed a number of words from English and Tok Pisin, mostly nouns and numerals. There are also a few Biblical nouns which originated from Greek (e.g. denarius) or Hebrew (e.g. manna) or Aramaic which a have been used in translated Maia New Testament portions. Phonetic changes are sometimes made and these nouns take the normal noun marking. For example, in a text the word “prophet” might be written propeto

92

August 2010

(prophet=TP). Occasionally verbs are borrowed, with Maia prefixes and suffixes added to carry the proper inflections. This is mostly done in spoken form (for convenience) rather than in written form.

6. PHRASES
6.1 Noun Phrases
6.1.1 The General Noun Phrase Structure
The surface structure elements of the General Noun Phrase are ordered as follows:
+/- PossP +/- QualP + HEAD +/- AdjP +/- QuanP +/- Det

A NP may consist of a head noun only, or a head noun and its modifiers. The head noun may be pre-modified or post-modified, or both. When a noun is post-modified, any clitics would be suffixed to the last modifier. In natural speech, the NP usually occurs with a Head alone, or with one or two modifiers or quantifiers. Long NPs are unnatural.
398) wat kani iner ono pig big two D1 ‘The two large pigs.’

Occasionally the head noun may be elided from the NP. In such cases the head noun can always be recovered from the context.
399) ø kani lamua ono ø big bad D1 ‘the very big (one)’

6.1.1.1 The Head of the NP
The Head of a NP may consist of a common or proper noun, a nominalized verb, a personal pronoun, or an indefinite pronoun. The common noun is the least restricted as to what modifiers or qualifiers can occur with it. The indefinite pronoun cannot have any modifiers or qualifiers.

400) muado kani ono man big D1
‘that/the big man’

401) saki dogo-t-arav

ono

talk straight-CAU1-NOM D1

‘the talk-straightening’

402) U-da=no nanam+u-mado

ruv-a.

3s-AD2=TP tree + 3s-body(money) look.for-3s

‘One looked for money’

August 2010

93

403) Di wi ono ne=mate parar+ano-mo:... DS 3p D1 do=MN knowledge+say-
‘And they have knowledge like so: ...’

6.1.1.2 The Qualifying Phrase
An optional Qualifying Phrase is the closest pre-modifier of the Head Noun. It may consist of a NP (usually just a single noun), a nominalized clause functioning as a close-knit pre-modifier, or a relativized finite clause.

404) malip work

muado man

‘workman’

405) nada muira upam ono child boy small D1
‘the small boy child’s

406) nanam+umunuv

tav-arav muado

tree+3s-heart(money) get-NOM man

‘the tax collector’ (lit. the money-getting man)

407) Yo yo-nor emuar=at dumag avia-mi tete ono tete-a-so-mo. 1s 1s-INTP friend=COM hunting go-RL.1p story D1 story-VR1-PROS-IR.1s/3p
‘I’m about to tell the story of going hunting with my friend.’ [lit.] I’m about to tell the ‘I went hunting with my friend’ story.

408) ...yo=di maia+nane maiamaia ne=mato-mo ono otowanam saki-a+ni-es-io. ...1s=CT what+say things do=MN-RL.1s/3p D1 source talk-VR1+2p-give-IR.1s ‘...I will tell you the basis for why I am doing these things).’ [lit.] I will tell you the ‘why I am doing these things’ basis.

6.1.1.3 The Possessive Phrase An optional Possessive Phrase may also pre-modify the Head Noun. It occurs immediately preceding the
Qualifying Phrase. The Possessive Phrase may consist of a general NP (409)-(411), an intensified pronoun (412), or a general NP followed by an intensified pronoun (413). When the NP refers to a group of people and the 3rd person plural pronoun obligatorily precedes the noun, that pronoun can take the possessive marking (414).
409) muado ono nanum man D1 woman ‘that man’s wife’
410) Ripa muado Ripa man ‘Ripa’s husband’

94

411) wi Isip malip muado 3p Egypt work man ‘the Egyptians’ work man’
412) yo-nor awun 1s-INTP dog ‘my dog’
413) muado ono o-nor nanum man D1 3s-INTP woman ‘that man’s wife’
414) wi-nor Israel wi-bisibis=yag 3p-INTP Israel 3p-ancestors=COLL ‘Israel’s ancestors’
415) wi Israel wi-nor wi-bisibis=yag 3p Israel 3p-INTP 3p-ancestors=COLL ‘Israel’s ancestors’

Inalienably possessed nouns are already obligatorily prefixed for possessor, but may also be modified by an optional PossP.
416) i-namo 1s-mother ‘my mother’
417) Yo-nor i-namo 1s-INTP 1s-mother ‘my mother’

6.1.1.4 The Adjective Phrase
An optional Adjective Phrase may occur as a post-modifier immediately following the Head Noun. A Modifying Relative Clause (419) may also occur in this position.

418) nanam u-dogo lov+lov ono tree 3s-straight RDUP+good D1
‘those very straight trees’

419) ...yag wabuar=ga ig-a

ono lak+at-a.

...water mouth=LOC1 be-RL.3s D1 spill-CAU3-RL.3s

‘It dumped out the water that was in its mouth.’

Adjective Phrases may also function as a predicate in a Topic-Comment clause. For details on this function see Section 7.4.1 Adjectival Comments: Descriptive Clauses.

August 2010

95

The elements in the Adjective Phrase are ordered as follows:

+/- DIMINISHER + ADJECTIVE +/- INTENSIFIER PHRASE

Only the Adjective Head is obligatory; all other constituents are optional. The Head may be pre-modified by the diminisher sekaka, meaning ‘a.little=LIM’, which functions as a degree word of low intensity, thus diminishing the quality of the adjective.
The AdjP Head is followed by an Intensifier Phrase. The formula for the Intensifier Phrase is as follows:

+/- INTS 1

+/- INTS 2

Of the two intensifier positions either one or both can be filled:

 The first position may be filled with a subclass of Adjectives: • lov ‘good’ (to signify an intense degree of a positive quality), • lamua ‘bad’ (to signify an intense degree of a negative quality), • kani ‘big’ (to signify an intense degree of any quality, either positive or negative).
 The second intensifier position is filled by the intensified pronoun o-nor ‘3s-INTP’.

The Diminisher and the Intensifier Phrase are mutually exclusive in their occurrence.

420) sek=aka lamua a.little=LIM bad
‘rather bad’

421) wager o-nor strong 3s-INTP
‘very strong’

422) kani lamua big bad
‘huge’ / ‘awfully big’

423) merek kani happy big
‘extremely happy’

424) me+da yana kani NEG+AD2 long big
‘not very long’

The Adjective Phrase may occur recursively; however, no more than two recursions have been observed in the texts. When there is recursion, the AdjP always consists of only the Adjective Head. The ordering of recursive

96

August 2010

adjective heads is normally colour first, then quality, then size. More study needs to be done on this, especially to determine which words can be used in the “quality” position. However, it is rare to find more than a couple of adjectives within a NP. Example (426) is stretching the limit of naturalness.
425) wat gigir upam iner pig black small two ‘two small black pigs’
426) ida wag usuwa toromo kani ono ground canoe white new big D1 ‘that big new white vehicle’
6.1.1.5 The Quantifier Phrase The Quantifier Phrase functions as a NP post-modifier. Its position is immediately following the AdjP in the
general noun phrase. Quantifiers include both numerals and non-numerals (see Section 5.3).
The Quantifier Phrase is made up of a quantifier word plus the intensified pronoun o-nor ‘3s-INTP’. The intensifier is optional and is infrequent since it is semantically impossible to intensify most quantifiers. In fact, only one quantifier in the data takes the intensifier, i.e. the word kumukani ‘many’.
+ QUANTIFIER +/- INTS2

427) maiamaia lov+lov

kumukani o-nor

things RDUP+good many

3s-INTP

‘very many good things’

6.1.1.6 The Determiner The Determiner is a demonstrative pronoun (see Demonstrative Pronouns, 5.4.2) which may occur as the last
post-modifier in a general NP. Demonstratives indicate that the identity of the noun is referentially accessible— either from the preceding discourse, through the speech situation, or through general cultural knowledge. Among the modifiers in the NP, the Determiner has the widest distribution; it can occur with any type of Head except the Indefinite pronoun, (400) - (403) .
428) wat kani o-nor ono pig big 3s-INTP D1 ‘that very big pig’
429) Tereter yabar ito Tereter bush D2U ‘that Tereter bush (way up there)’
430) umuda maia iwo mountain PL D2L ‘those mountains way over there’

August 2010

97

6.1.2 Noun Phrase Plurality
Number is a characteristic of a Noun Phrase, and in Maia it can be coded in a variety of ways. The number of a subject or object NP in a clause is normally identified by a person and number affix on the finite verb. In addition, collective plurality may be marked by the suffix =yag meaning ‘together/as a group’on a (+human) head of a NP, or in some cases, as the final affix on a finite verb (see Section 3.3 for details). And, distributive plurality is marked by the distributive affix –lava on finite verbs (see Section 4.2.3.1.4).

431) Dawa yana kani ovo ø-malip-a-mo. house long big PROX 3s-work-VR1-RL.3s
‘They made this very tall house.’

432) Wino katu

maiamaia lov+lov

ø-malip-ø-ito=yag.

3p=TP enough/able things RDUP+good 3s-work-VR1-IR.3p=COLL

‘They will be able to do good things.’

433) Yesus=i nada up+upam wi-lov+a-t-a. Jesus=CT child RDUP+small 3p-good+say-CAU2-RL.3s
‘Jesus blessed the little children.’

Noun Phrases may be pluralized by a plural quantifier word in the Quantifier Phrase position of the general NP. See Section 6.1.1.5 The Quantifier Phrase.
All personal pronouns show the person and number, so NP plurality would be shown by any plural pronoun as Head of a NP.
Pluralization in reference to a people group, may also occur by the addition of a plural personal pronoun in an Appositional NP (See Section 6.1.3.2.1 under Pronouns in an Appositional Phrase).
In some cases plurality may also be marked by the reduplication of certain nouns and adjectives. See sections 4.1.4.3.1 and 4.3.4.

6.1.3 Complex Noun Phrases
6.1.3.1 Copied Noun Phrase
A Copied Noun Phrase is composed of a general NP followed by a pronoun or emphatic pronoun functioning as a copy of the preceding NP. The Pronoun Copy sometimes terminates a NP when the head noun is thematically prominent.

434) Muado u-da wi*-nim=o Adam, ma-o=di God saki puaraka-t+u-s-a Man 3s-AD2 3p*-name=TP Adam E-3s=CT God talk push.out-CAU1+3s-give-RL.3s ‘A man named Adam, he disobeyed God’s talk’
6.1.3.1.1 Dual Summarizing Pronoun A dual pronoun may summarize the referents. Sometimes only one referent is actually named in a noun phrase
while the other is implied and alluded to by the use of the summarizing dual pronoun.

435) I=no i-rabe=no Krais malip muado=waka. 1p=TP 1p-DU=TP Christ work man=LIM ‘We, both of us, are simply Christ’s workmen.’
436) wi=no wi-rabe... 3p=TP 3p-DU ‘they, both of them’ / ‘they, the two of them’
437) yo, yo-nor emuar ono, i-rabe ... 1s 1s-INTP friend D1 1p-DU ‘I and my friend, the two of us ...’
438) Yapet i-rabe ... Yapet 1p-DU ‘Yapet (and I), the two of us...’

6.1.3.2 Appositional Noun Phrase
An Appositional Noun Phrase is composed of two juxtaposed NPs in which the nouns of both NPs refer to the same referent. The second of the NPs is the apposition. The first of the NPs may also be a pronoun.

6.1.3.2.1 Pronouns in an Appositional Phrase A personal pronoun can replace the first one of the noun phrases in an Appositional NP. The person and
number marked on the verb affixation of the clause is consistent with the pronoun.
442) Yo Pol=i... 1s Pol=CT ‘I, Paul,...’
When speaking of a people group (e.g. of a region, country or any other specified group of people as a whole), the specified group occurs appositionally to a plural form of the free personal pronouns i, nae, or wi. The plural pronouns function to both pluralize the following NP head and to add the idea of a people group.

‘you present-day men’ (or, you men of today)’

When referring to a whole group of people without specifically naming the place/nationality, both pluralizers may be used. The plural pronoun forms refer to the people as a whole group—i.e., the group of people being spoken of including the speaker (i ‘we’), the group being spoken to by the speaker (nae ‘you’ pl.), or the group being spoken of excluding the speaker (wi ‘they’). The pluralizer maia pluralizes the more specific place or category of people being related (by juxtaposition) to the whole people group.

6.1.4 Conjoined Noun Phrase Types
6.1.4.1 Coordinate Noun Phrases
The co-ordinate NP describes two (or more) participants in a NP sharing together in a single event. NPs may be conjoined in these four ways: (1) by the NP accompaniment clitic =(g)at ; and/or (2) by the conjoining conjunction da ; (3) by juxtaposition, followed by a summarizing dual pronoun, (4) or, by the Emphatic Marker =ma (See Section 3.10.1 for examples).
The clitic =(g)at can only conjoin two noun phrases, and may occur on either one NP (marking the entire NP) or on both NPs. The free conjunction da ‘AD2’ may occur between the noun phrases already conjoined by =gat.

1. [ X=(g)at + Y=(g)at ]
When occurring simultaneously on both NPs, =(g)at indicates that the participants are being considered together in the event, and that there is an equal relationship between the two NPs.

449) o-nor muado=gat o-nor nada=gat dibo-mo. 3s-INTP man=COM 3s-INTP child=COM chase-RL.1s/3p

The idea of distribution is indicated by coordinating two identical nouns with =(g)at, (452), (453). Used in the same way with time words, the meaning carries the idea of ‘continuously/regularly without change’, (454), (455). However, when used with a verb of motion, the idea of sequence is added – as in, ‘from place to place’, (456).

6.2 Verb Phrases
The VP in Maia may consist of a finite verb word, a medial verb word, serial verbs, a compound verb, or an adjunct + verb word.
There are three main types of verb phrases in Maia depending on the composition of the VP. They are as follows: (1) The Simple Verb Phrase, (2) The Serial Verbs, and (3) The Adjunct + Verb Phrase.

6.2.1 The Simple Verb Phrase
The simple verb phrase consists of a nucleus of one verb.

6.2.2 The Serial Verbs
A serial verb consists of two or more verbs in a series, each being part of a single overall event. The individual verbs in the phrase can be used separately with their own individual meanings, but when juxtaposed in a series, function together as a single event. Each verb in the series maintains its own phonological stress. Since the term “serial” already indicates the phrasal quality and since “serial verb” is a well-established term, the phrases in this group are called “serial verbs” rather than “serial verb phrases”.
The bondedness of two serial verbs may be contrasted with two coordinate clauses, which are more loosely joined, on the one hand, or with compound verbs, which are much more tightly joined, on the other. On a continuum, serial verbs occupy the middle area between the two extremes. See also under Verb Compounding, Section 4.2.3.2).
In a serial verb, the pre-final verbs in the series are not inflected for aspect or subject person and number; they are stripped down to their stems. The only affixation permitted on a prefinal verb is an object prefix which normally occurs on the initial verb. There are a couple of serial verbs in which a prefix occurs on both verbs; however, the second prefix is a ‘frozen’ form, holding no meaning at all in the phrase, and only ever using the 3s form in this position. It is present because the verb -miase ‘follow’ is a Class I transitive verb and always requires an object prefix.

bese+u-miase wivede+u-miase

hold + follow it see + follow

look after (hold responsibility for) control over them

In serial verbs, only the last verb in the series is inflected. This verb carries the appropriate inflection for either a medial or a finite verb, depending on whether or not the serial construction occurs in a non-final or final clause. If occurring in a medial clause, the serial verbs refer to the following final verb for their full inflection.
Five different types of serial verb phrases have been identified according to their function: (1) The General Serial Verb Phrase; (2) The Intensified Serial Verb Phrase ; (3) The Aspectual Serial Verb Phrase ; (4) The Dative Serial Verb Phrase; (5) The Demonstrational Serial Verb Phrase, and (6) The Conative Serial Verb Phrase.

6.2.2.1 General Serial Verb
The General Serial Verb encodes a single, but complex, event, with both verbs in the series sharing the same subject. Up to four serial verbs in succession have been noted, however the first one or two verbs generally carries the main meaning, while the verbs beyond the first two generally show other functions such as aspect, increased valency, or intensification. Most often only two verbs occur in a series. In this case, often the meaning is a composite of the individual verbs in order to describe the event in a more specific or accurate way. Often the second verb describes the manner in which an action is done, as in the following examples:

The verb mina ‘throw.out’ carries the idea of ‘in a manner of separation’:

475) buade+mina 476) surume+mina 477) warupe+mina

cut+throw out push+throw out hit+throw out

‘cut off’ ‘push aside’ ‘sprinkle/ fling out’

The verb walea ‘walk’ carries the idea of ‘here and there’; ‘about’

478) mina+walea

throw+walk

‘throw around’

479) sose+walea

pull+walk

‘crawl, slide around’

The verb kokate ‘firmly.fix’ lends the idea of something done tightly.

480) baime+kokate

close+ firmly.fix ‘close something securely’

481) demate+kokate

unite+firmly fix ‘cause to be firmly or tightly united/packed/plastered’

The verb sane ‘put/leave’ has the idea of purposeful abandonment.

482) u-vede+sane

3s-see+leave/put

‘ignore it’

483) mina+sane

throw out+put/leave

‘drop, set aside, put aside, abandon’

The intensifier verb verede ‘VINTS’ adds intensification to the meaning of the preceding verb(s). We’ve seen this word used as an independent verb only once, and it seems to be becoming obsolete. It means something like ‘pierce’, but I will gloss it as VINTS because of its present function. Verede may be partially reduplicated, i.e. vere-verede, to further intensify the meaning of the serial verb with which it occurs.

484) Yo=no i-munuv lovana+vered-a. 1s=TP 1s-heart be.good+VINTS-RL.3s ‘I am very happy. (lit. My heart is very good.)’
485) ...ma ono=na=di nii-nabase+vered-a. ...thing D1=ATN=CT 2p-help+VINTS-RL.3s ‘...that thing really helped you.’

To express an increasing degree of intensification, a clause chaining structure is used, consisting of a medial verb plus a final serial verb using the same verb stem in both.

486) ...vovol=o lamua-na-sa lamua-na+vered-a... ...wind=TP bad-VR2-SEQ bad-VR2+VINTS-RL.3s

6.2.2.2 Aspectual Serial Verb
Serial verbs are sometimes used to add an aspect distinction to another verb. A verb chosen from an open set of verbs is modified by a following closed set of aspectual verbs to form an aspectual serial verb construction. This lexical indication of aspect conforms to Foley’s statement regarding aspect as an ‘inner operator’ with the function of delimiting the predicate: ‘Inner operators in Papuan languages (and elsewhere as well) tend to be indicated lexically, most commonly by specialized uses of verb-stems in serial constructions.’ (1986: 143)

6.2.2.2.1 Continuous Aspect
Maia uses two verbs of motion, avia ‘go/continue’ and irebue ‘come/continue’ to signal a continuous or extended aspect in a serial verb phrase. Irebue ‘come/continue’ is especially used when referring to the time of a past situation/event that continually moves ahead towards a present or future time.

492) ...sane+avia-g-a ...put+go-IPF-RL.3s

ulakin buse-sa mina+avi-a.

Man something seed gather-SEQ throw.out=go-RL.3s

‘A man gathered up seed and scattered it (continuously).’

6.2.2.2.2 Completive Aspect The verb yase ‘complete’ is used to indicate a completed aspect.
495) ...av avia+yasi-mi. ...village go-complete-RL.1p ‘...we went all the way to the village.’

6.2.2.2.3 Reduplicated Iterative Aspect
The Reduplicated Iterative Aspect is encoded by a fully reduplicated motion verb (e.g. avia ‘go’, walea ‘walk’, etc.) repeated in a series. The number of times the verb is reduplicated is pragmatically determined (usually 2 or 3 times) depending on how much the speaker wants to emphasize the degree of repetitiveness in anticipation of a change in the iterative nature of the action. The action of the verb may be almost continuous with only very short intervals between the actions, or the action may involve longer intervals. The reduplicated verb may be a medial verb which has dropped its normal medial verb marking –sa (normally being followed by a finite verb), or, it may

be a fully inflected finite verb. Often the Iterative Aspect Phrase is combined with the Continuous Aspect Phrase (above), as in (499), (500).

‘They chased it here and there and here and there until they came right near me.

6.2.2.3 Valency Increasing Serial Verb
The Valency Increasing Serial construction indicates a change in the valency on the first verb in the series. To increase the valency of certain verbs by one additional argument, the generic verb ese ‘give’ is placed following the main verb(s). The word ‘give’ carries an obligatory object prefix which identifies the additional argument of the verb.
In this serial construction, the normal meaning of ese ‘give’ is semantically bleached. The meaning and function of ese correlates closely with the English prepositions for, to, and of, relating to the ideas of a beneficiary, i.e., relating to the benefit of someone (or, in some cases, to the detriment of someone), a recipient, or owner, etc. According to Foley, ‘This realization of English prepositions is very widespread among Papuan languages.’ (1986: 114).

‘...we cut the garden trees for him/of his.’

6.2.2.4 Conative Serial Verb
Maia conforms to Foley’s statement that ‘the conative modality (the actor tries to perform an action) is almost universally signalled in Papuan languages with a serial verb construction involving the verb stem ‘see’.’ (1986: 152) In Maia, the construction consists of a verb stem which is followed by a medial or final form of the verb nage ‘look’/’see’.

6.2.2.5 “Report” Serial Verbs with (n)ane
6.2.2.5.1 Desiderative Serial Verb
A Desiderative ‘Report’ Serial Verb is indicated by a verb marked in the desiderative mode followed by the speech verb (n)ane ‘say’. This serial verb denotes a reported desire/intention—with the reporter assuming/knowing that the desire/intention resulted from a change of state, e.g. a thought that had arisen in the mind. (See also 6.2.3.1.1 The Generic ‘Report’ Phrase.)

6.2.2.5.2 Purpose Serial Verb
A Purpose ‘Report’ Serial Verb is indicated by a verb nominalised with –arav, and followed by the speech verb nane ‘say’. As above, this serial verb is used to report that which the reporter knows/assumes to have become a Purpose/Goal in the mind(s) of one or more characters in the text. (See also 6.2.3.1.1 The Generic ‘Report’ Phrase.)

6.2.3 The Adjunct + Verb Phrases
6.2.3.1 Verb Phrases with Generic Verbs
The Generic Verb Phrase consists of a nominal adjunct plus a generic verb. While the generic verbs are largely devoid of their normal meaning, they carry the verbal inflections for the phrase and have other grammatical functions.
Three generic verbs are used to form the Generic Verb Phrases: 1. nane ‘say’ verb 2. de ‘tell’ verb 3. wa ‘shoot’ verbs

6.2.3.1.1 Generic ‘Report’ Phrase: (n)ane ‘say’
The Generic ‘Report’ Phrase is formed by a noun or adjective followed by the generic verb nane ‘say’. This generic verb functions as a stative verbalizer, and is used to report an uncontrolled fact, condition or situation which has come up and is purported to be a reality based on what is assumed/known by the reporter. This particular structure is the most common and most productive of all the adjunct verb phrase constructions.

6.2.3.1.2 Generic ‘Demonstrational’ Phrases
The Generic ‘Demonstrational’ Phrase consists of a locational adverb ov ‘here’ + the intransitive verbalizer a , followed by the the generic/intransitive ‘report’ verb nane ‘say’, or it may also be followed by the transitive verb de meaning ‘tell’. Used with the intransitive ‘report’ verb, the phrase is used to express the stative idea of being a show or demonstration of something in general or being noticeable. Used with the transitive ‘tell’ verb, this phrase is used to express the dynamic concept of showing something to somebody in particular.

1. Ov-a+nane (being a show, a sign, or demonstration of something in general)

513) Inav, kam, da aba

lov i e lamua usaruv ono ov-a+nane-g-ito.

‘He took the woman and went and showed her to the man.’

6.2.3.1.3 Generic ‘Causative’ Phrase: wa ‘shoot’ In this structure, the adjunct is the object of the clause and the inanimate cause is the subject. The object prefix
marks the recipient of the action. In the English translation, the grammatical relations are different.
517) ...u-muda sina wi-w-ido. ...3s-eye shame 3p-shoot-IR.3s ‘...he will shame them.’ / [lit.] ‘...his eye will shoot shame to them.’

6.2.3.1.4 Generic ‘Experiential’ Phrase:

wa ‘shoot’

This Generic ‘Experiential’ Phrase expresses an experience which is not under the control of the experiencer. This structure conforms to Foley’s description of adjunct-plus-verb constructions in which ‘the adjunct is an inanimate cause functioning as the actor. [These constructions] ‘are very common in expressing uncontrolled states or events in Papuan languages...’ (1986: 122) The verb wa ‘shoot’ is used as the generic verb in this type of phrase.

6.3 Adverbial Phrases
Adverbial Phrases function as a periphery in a clause. They include Temporal, Locative, Directional, Manner, and Comitative Phrases.

6.3.1 Temporal Phrase
Temporal Phrases may consist of a temporal adverb, a NP which has a temporal noun as head, or a NP+clitic(s). Also, some temporal nouns may combine with each other or with a time adverbial to make the resulting time phrase more specific. For the use of the clitics =ga ‘LOC1’, =ra ‘LOC2’, =gat ‘COM’ in temporal phrases see Section 3 entitled CLITICS.

7. CLAUSES
A clause is a syntactic unit which is smaller than a sentence, but larger than a phrase. It consists of one predication. A finite clause may occur alone as a simple sentence. While, in longer sentences, it may occur in other positions too, it usually has to occur sentence finally. The verb of a finite clause is fully inflected for person,

August 2010

115

number and mood. Medial clauses occur sentence medially and are marked with a medial verb marker. See section 4.2.3 and following for detailed information on verbal morphology.
The normal order of the core constituents is SOV. A minimal clause consists of a verb. The subject, and object of a transitive clause, are not always marked by a NP in a clause, as the person and number of these core arguments are marked on the finite verb.
Based on the number and type of core arguments required by the predicate in the clause, clauses are categorized as intransitive, transitive, di-transitive, or topic-comment clauses.
7.1 Intransitive Clauses
7.1.1 General Intransitive Clauses
Intransitive clauses have an intransitive verb. The subject is the only core element. Only the verb is obligatory. Since the subject is marked on the verb, like the oblique elements, the subject NP is optional. Oblique elements normally occur before the verb, however they may be fronted for topicalization. Temporals are often fronted. The verb is normally the final element in the clause.

7.1.2 Intransitive ‘Experience’ Clauses: Adjunct + Generic Verb
Intransitive predicates may be formed by using either an adjunct + the verb (n)ane ‘say’ or an adjunct + the stative verbalizer (n)a ‘VR2’.
Semantically, the subject has the role of experiencer. According to Foley (1986:127) this type of adjunct + generic verb structure is commonly found among Papuan languages to compensate for a lack of verb stems. It is a very productive feature of the Maia language.

7.2 Transitive Clauses
7.2.1 General Transitive Clauses
Transitive clauses, in addition to the subject, involve another argument, i.e. the object of the clause. The object of a transitive clause is marked by an object person-number prefix on the verb, and by an optional NP.
Verbs in the 3rd person singular often omit the object prefix, and it seems that ø is becoming the main marker for 3s objects. (See 4.2.2.1)
Only the verb is obligatory in a transitive clause. The subject and object NPs are optional since they are marked by person-number affixation on the verb. The object normally occurs between the subject and the verb. However, it may be occasionally fronted for topicalization, (576). If the object is fronted, the subject NP is marked by the contrastive topic clitic. Oblique elements may occur before or after the subject, and before or after the object.

7.2.2 Transitive ‘Experience’ Clauses
While transitive ‘experience’ clauses are syntactically active, they are semantically stative. They consist of a nominal functioning as an inanimate/impersonal subject, an animate object (which experiences a state or event), and a transitive verb whose lexical meaning has been bleached.
The subject is either a NP or is simply marked on the verb, always as a 3rd person singular (since it is impersonal). In these clauses, the focus is off the subject and is on the state of an experiencer. The obligatory predicate is an adjunct adjective/noun + verb stem, wa ‘shoot’ or ta ‘get’.

7.2.2.1 Experience Clauses with wa ‘shoot’
An experience clause with wa ‘shoot’ is an impersonal syntactically transitive construction which describes an uncontrolled experience. The experiencer may be marked by a NP or simply prefixed on the verb. The 3rd person singular prefix is always a null element on this verb.

7.2.2.2 Experience Clauses with ta ‘get’
The verb ta ‘get’ is sometimes used in various ways as in ‘have’ or ‘be’ or ‘feel’. The subject is the conscious experiencer and may be overtly present in the clause or simply marked on the person/number suffix of the verb. The inalienably possessed noun -bom ‘fear of (somebody)’ carries an obligatory object pronoun prefix indicating the causer of the fear experienced by the subject.

7.3 Ditransitive Clauses
7.3.1 General Ditransitive Clauses
Ditransitive Clauses involve someone in addition to the people or things that are the subject and direct object of the clause. This third participant, i.e., the Indirect Object, is a beneficiary, recipient, or possessor of the direct object. Both objects normally occur between the subject and a ditransitive verb or serial verb phrase construction involving the ditransitive verb ese “give”. In ditransitive clauses, the ditransitive verb or serial verb phrase is obligatory. The person and number of the indirect object is prefixed on the ditransitive verb or on the final ese verb in the serial verb phrase. The direct object, which may be found prefixed to the first verb root of the serial verb phrase, is most often marked by zero in the 3rd person singular; however, it is occasionally marked. Below, the indirect object prefix is underlined.
594) ...nanav i-nado-mo . ...food 1s-give.food-RL.1s/3p ‘...they gave food to me.’
595) Bada+nan+u-s-a. finish+say+3s-give-RL.3s ‘He finished it for him.’
596) Wi muata lov ono u-miase+wi-es-ini. 3p custom good D1 3s-follow+3p-give-IR.2s ‘You must follow that good custom of theirs.’ (or, ‘You must follow their good custom.’)

The normal unfocused order of the core elements is as follows:

+/- Subject +/- Indirect Object

+/- Direct Object

+ VERB dit / Verbtr + ese

The two object positions may be switched; when the direct object becomes the Topic, it precedes the indirect object. Compare these examples:

IO
597) Kunia Kunia

7.3.2 Ditransitive ‘Experience’ Clause: ese ‘give’
Ese ‘give’ is used in an impersonal syntactically ditransitive construction which describes an uncontrolled experience. This ditransitive ‘experience’ clause consists of a nominal functioning as an inanimate/impersonal subject and an experiencer as object that is consciously in a state or undergoing change. The impersonal/inanimate subject may be marked by a NP or simply suffixed on the finite verb. The experiencer may be marked by a NP or simply prefixed on the verb.

7.4 Topic-Comment Clauses
A Topic-Comment clause contains an obligatory Topic/Subject and an obligatory Comment/Predicate. The Topic is that part of the clause about which the predicate makes a statement. The Comment is that part of the clause which states some type of information concerning the condition or state of the Topic. Syntactically, the comment may be an AdjP, a NP, an AdvP, or a relative clause.

August 2010

123

In a Topic-Comment clause, the presence of the copula ige ‘be’ depends on the modality or tense13 meaning of the clause, or on the semantic function of clause. When it is present, the subject NP is optional since the person/number of the subject is marked on the verb. However, when the copula is not present, a subject NP must be present.
In all the examples below the comment is underlined.
7.4.1 Adjectival Comments: Descriptive Clauses
Adjectival (descriptive) clauses are always verbless in the realis mode having a present tense meaning. The copula is optional in the realis mode having a past tense meaning. However, clauses denoting a past tense require the addition of a time word in those cases where the past tense needs to be clearly identified. Often, however, the past tense is understood by the context. In the irrealis mode (including the future tense meaning), the copula is obligatory.
Realis with present tense meaning (- copula): 605) Wat kani. pig big ‘The pig is big.’
Realis with past tense meaning ( +/ - copula): 606) U-nau wat upam (ig-a) 3s-earlier pig small (be-RL.3s) ‘Earlier the pig was small.’
Irrealis ( + copula): 607) Anam, wat kani ig-ido. later pig big be-IR.3s ‘Later, the pig will be big.’
7.4.2 Nominal Comments
Nominal Topic-Comment Clauses consist of Identity and Possessive clauses. These clause types are structurally similar.
7.4.2.1 Identity Like adjectival (descriptive) comments, identity comments are always verbless in the realis mode with a present
tense meaning. The copula is optional in the realis mode with a past tense meaning, and requires the addition of a time word only in cases where the past tense may not be understood by the context. In the irrealis mode (which includes the future tense meaning), the copula is obligatory.
Present tense meaning (- copula):

13 The ‘tense’ is used semantically here, as there is no morphological tense marking in Maia. The tense distinctions are handled by mood and aspect marking.

7.4.2.2.2 Possession of General Knowledge
In Topic-Comment clauses are used to express the possession of general knowledge as a present reality. The copula is optional.
When clearly distinguishing the present or past tense meanings (realis mode), or the future tense meaning (irrealis mode), a clause with the serial verb form of parar+ane ‘knowledge+say’ is used instead of a TopicComment clause.
See 7.4.3.1.3 for expressing the possession of specialized knowledge.

7.4.3 Oblique Comments
Oblique comments consist of an optional subject, and an obligatory oblique comment. The presence of the copula (ige) varies with the type of clause and is discussed with each one listed below. Oblique comments include Comitative and Manner Comments.
7.4.3.1 Comitative Comments A Comitative Comment may express one of four types of association: (1) accompaniment, meaning to be
physically or spiritually present with something or someone at a particular time; (2) the idea of physically having/possessing something, and (3) the idea of having/possessing a specialized knowledge.
The comitative clitic =(g)at identifies this type of comment (see also 3.2).

7.4.3.1.1 Accompaniment When expressing accompaniment, the presence of the copula (ige) is obligatory.

625) Paul=o o-nor nanum=at ig-a. Paul=TP 3s-INTP woman=COM be-RL.3s

Barnabas=TP 3s-older.brother=COLL two=COM be-3s

‘Barnabas is with his two older siblings.’ [cf. (631) ]

It also includes the idea of containing something. See also 7.4.2.2.1 above.

628) Yawid ovo=no Mela u-gugud=at ig-a. book PROX=TP Mela 3s-image=COM be-RL.3s

629) Botel=o yag=at

ig-a.

bottle=TP water=COM be-RL.3s

‘The bottle contains water.’

7.4.3.1.2 Physical Possession
When expressing a physical possession, the copula is absent in the realis mode, including both the present and past tense meanings. In the irrealis mode (including the future tense meaning), physical possession must be expressed by a nominal, rather than oblique, comment, 7.4.2.2.1.

‘The look of them (i.e. creatures) that walk about, have different faces.’

7.4.3.1.3 Possession of Specialized Intellectual Property
This Oblique Comment is different from the Nominal Comment above ( 7.4.2.2.2) which also expresses the possession of knowledge. This comitative form speaks of possessing a much more specialized knowledge that few people in the Maia culture have14 or knowledge that is considered to be the exclusive intellectual property of a person or group, (639). This form cannot be used to indicate having knowledge which is fairly general in nature, as shown in (638). In this type of clause, the copula (ige) is optional.

‘I have knowledge of the man’s name.’ (ungrammatical)

14 For example, in our village only two or three men are marked as specialists for butchering pigs. Likewise, only one man is in charge of leading the traditional ‘sing-sing’ dances and he specializes in knowing all the traditional songs and teaching them to others. This specialized knowledge is kept in this family line and is passed on down to the eldest son.

7.4.3.2 Manner Comments
In Manner Comments, the copula (ige) is optional in the realis (present and past tense meanings), depending on the need to clarify the meaning of the tense. In the irrealis (including the future tense meaning), the copula is obligatory.

Present and Past tense meanings (+/- copula):

7.5 Complement Clauses
7.5.1 Knowledge Complement Clauses
7.5.1.1 Knowledge as a Present Reality
A state of ‘having’ or ‘being in possession’ of knowledge is expressed by the non-verbal predicate parar ‘knowledge’ in a nominal Topic-Comment clause of possession. This structure views the state of ‘having knowledge’ as a present reality (rather than viewing it as having become or being in the process of becoming a reality). The ‘parar’ predicate is immediately followed by a complement clause quoting object of the knowledge.
The Topic is obligatory with one exception: when simply giving a reply to a question without stating the content, a subject marking in the 1st person is not required. For example, the reply to a question may be “Me parar” (glossed as ‘NEG knowledge’), and is clearly understood as “I don’t know”.

+ TOPIC

+ NOMINAL COMMENT parar ‘knowledge’

645) Yo parar migara wat warup-arav. 1s knowledge tomorrow pig hit-IR.1p
‘I know tomorrow we will kill a pig.’ or, [lit.] ‘I have knowledge, “tomorrow we will kill a pig.”’

Another way to indirectly express the state of being knowledgeable (or not) is by simply embedding a nominalized clause (expressing the content of the knowledge) within the NP Comment of a Topic-Comment clause. Since a NP has the potential for several layers of embedding, the content of the possessed knowledge may be easily included in the NP. The object of parar, in the example below, is a NP with an embedded nominalized clause premodifying the Head.

7.5.1.2 Reported Knowledge
A Generic ‘Report’ Phrase, formed by the noun parar ‘knowledge’ verbalized by the speech verb (n)ane ‘say’, is used to give a report (re one’s self or someone else) of having come to a point of being knowledgeable about something, the reality of which is based on some type of evidence or assumed evidence. (Also: refer back to 6.2.3.1 Verb Phrases with Generic Verbs)
There are two formulas for declaring or reporting knowledge or assumed knowledge. The first, follows an +/S+V+O pattern:

+/- S

+ VP (parar+ane ‘know+say’)

+ COMPLEMENT CLAUSE as Direct Object

649) Muanigo parar+ano-mo,

‘Now I know, you follow God’s voice.’ Or,

[lit.] ‘Now I have become knowledgeable, “you follow God’s voice.”’

In a second structure, a complement clause is embedded as a direct object preceding the ‘parar+ane’ serial VP. The embedded clause is marked by the relative marker ono ‘D1’. This clause follows the typical +/-S+O+V pattern.

+/- S

+ COMPLEMENT CLAUSE + ono as Direct Object

7.5.2 Non-Finite Complement Clauses
The nominalized ‘-arav’ clause may function as a subject or object, or it may semantically encode a purpose/goal within another clause. In addition, it may serve as a constituent of a NP (see under section 6.1 Noun Phrases).

7.5.2.1 The -arav Clause as Subject or Object:

7.5.2.2 The -arav Clause: Expressing/Reporting a Purpose/Goal: The nominalised –arav clause may semantically encode a purpose/goal within another clause or sentence.
This uninflected nominalized verb form is used only when the finite verb form of the matrix clause is in the 1st person, to express a personal purpose or goal. The marker ono ‘D1’ may or may not be present. (More study needs to be done to determine under what circumstances it is required, or not.)

 Reporting a Purpose/Goal —
When the nominalized verb is further marked by the nane(sa) or ane(sa) verb meaning ‘say’ to form a Serial VP, it is used to report a purpose or goal, or an assumed purpose or goal, which is thought to be in someone’s mind. (See also: 8.1.1.4.1.1 for further discussion on the nane(sa) verb form.)

7.5.3 Finite Complement Clauses
Finite complement clauses can function as the topic of a Topic-Comment clause, or as subject of a clause, or as the object of verbs of cognition, perception, and utterance. For examples of ‘utterance’ complement clauses see 8.2.3 Indirect Speech.

7.6 Relative Clauses
A relative clause modifies a nominal head, helping to identify the entity that the head noun refers to, or providing more information about it. There are three main types of relative clauses in Maia, classed according to their position in relation to the head noun. They are: (1) the Internally Headed Relative Clause, (2) the Prenominal Relative Clause, (3) the Headless Relative Clause, (4) the Locative Relative Clause, and (5) the Temporal Relative Clause. Most constituents can be relativized, including subjects, direct objects, indirect objects, oblique arguments, possessors, and comparatives.

7.6.1 Internally-Headed Relative Clauses
The Internally-Headed Relative Clause normally includes the noun it modifies internally within the RC. In this type of RC, the antecedent noun is left unexpressed. The predicate of this RC is a finite verb and is immediately followed by the relative marker ono ‘D1’. When occurring in the sentence initial position, this structure is similar to the conditional/temporal clause, see 8.2.1.1. Internally-Headed Relative Clauses can be either restrictive, thus limiting the HN (666), or non-restrictive, giving additional information about the HN (665). In the latter case the HN is marked with a topic marker.
In the examples below, the head noun and relative marker are marked with a double underline; the RC is marked with a single underline.

Subject as Internal HN:

665) [Yo-nor muado=no uru

uruwa=gat yabar avi-a ono ] me+da mueke-a.

1s-INTP man=TP yesterday morning=COM bush go-RL.3s D1 NEG+AD2 return

‘‘My husband, who went to the bush yesterday morning, did not return.’ (non-restrictive)

666) Yo [ u-nau Kaukambar=ga wake kani ig-a ono] tete-a-so-mo. 1s 3s-earlier Kaukambar=LOC1 crocodile big be-RL.3s D1 story-VR1-PROS-IR.1s/3p
‘‘I’m about to tell (about) the big crocodile that was at Kaukambar earlier.’ (restrictive)

Direct Object as Internal HN:

667) ...[yag wabuar=ga ig-a

ono] ø-lak+at-a.

...water mouth=LOC1 be-RL.3s D1 3s-spill-CAU3-RL.3s

‘It dumped out the water that was in its mouth.’ / or, in isolation could be interpreted ‘(Given) that the water was in its/his mouth, he dumped it out.’

Indirect Object as Internal HN:

668) [Saimon Yesus=i wi*-nim u-da u-s-a

‘People whose bad behaviour dishonors the name of God, God is able to forgive them.’ or, ‘God is able to forgive people whose bad behaviour dishonours the name of God.’

Oblique as Internal Head:

670) [aba

avia-sa wale-inek+an-a

[place/time go-SEQ walk-DES.s+say-RL.3s D1 ] 3s-INTP woman story+3s-give-RL.3s

‘The place to which he wanted to go and walk, he told to his wife.’ or, ‘He told his wife about the place where he wanted to go and walk to.’

Object of Comparison as Internal Head:
671) [nanam wiv kani+kani nibuata wiv ne=mate ono] ta-sa ... [tree leaf RDUP+big breadfruit leaf do=MN D1 get=SEQ ‘(They) got big leaves which were like the leaves of the breadfruit (tree)?

7.6.2 Prenominal Relative Clauses
The Prenominal Relative Clause functions like a Qualifying Phrase. It may be marked by the relative marker ono ‘D1’, or it may directly precede the HN. The verb of the Prenominal RC may either be a nominalized –arav verb, or a finite verb form.
In the examples, the Prenominal Relative Clause is marked by a single underline and the antecedent NP is double underlined.

672) U-da=no inav=at

7.6.3 Headless Relative Clauses
A Headless Relative Clause has an understood HN which it modifies. This would usually occur when the head noun is a pronoun. The person marking on the verb in the RC shows the person and number of the missing HN.

675) Di u-naro,

[wae nanam ø-buasi-mi ono ] nanav ii-nado-mo ...

DS 3s-afternoon [garden tree 3s-cut-RL.1p D1 ] food 1p-give.food-RL.1s/3p

‘In the afternoon, they fed us, [who had cut the garden trees], ...’ (HN not present within RC)

7.6.4 Locative Relative Clauses
A locative relative clause has an understood locative position which can be marked by a HN, or be headless (676). In this type of RC, relative marker is affixed with a locative clitic, either =ga ‘LOC1’or =ra ‘LOC2’. (See Section 3.5 and 3.6) Whenever Direction is understood to be the HN, the RC is marked by the direction word ta, normally preceding the whole RC, but sometimes preceding the relative marker as well. (See also Section 6.3.3 Directional Phrase).

Positional Relative Clause:
676) 'Kelem, i=no muga idum-inok+ane-sa avia-mi bada true 1p=TP bird steal-DES.p+say-SEQ go-RL.1p SS

muga ine-g-a

‘True, we planned to steal the chickens and we went and came up (to where) the chickens roost.’

7.6.5 Temporal Relative Clauses
A temporal relative clause has an understood temporal which may be used as a time adverbial in the same way as the realis conditional clauses, see also 8.2.1.1. This temporal can be marked by a HN (679), or it can be headless (678).

678) wedem=o av u-ram=ra ilik-a

8. SENTENCES
Sentences are independent constructions ranking above the clause in the grammatical hierarchy. A sentence may consist of a single clause, or of two or more clauses joined by coordination or subordination. Clause coordination includes: (1) a clause chaining construction, with medial and final verbs, and (2) co-ranking independent structures—explicitly related by a conjunction or implicitly related by simple juxtaposition. Clause subordination includes a clause in a hypotactic (unequally ranked) relationship with another clause. Clause(s) which are embedded within another clause are described in 7.5 Complement Clauses, and 7.6 Relative Clauses.

8.1 Sentence Structure
A sentence is made up of one or more clauses, plus an optional theme and/or an optional tail. The structure is represented by the following formula:

+/- THEME

+ CLAUSE n

+/- TAIL

The theme precedes the core elements, giving information about the circumstances surrounding the predicate and identifying this as relatively more important than the other elements in the given setting. The tail is either an after-thought, a negation (which is emphatic and negates the whole clause), the question marker –i (which changes a statement to a polar question), or a negative alternative question.

8.1.1 Coordinate Structures
Coordinate structures consist of two or more independent clauses in an equal relationship and related to one another by means of: (1) the Additive adverbial da used as a conjunction, (2) the Adversative conjunction onor=aka ‘3s-INTP=LIM’/‘but’/‘however’, (3) an Alternative structure, (4) a Clause Chaining Structure, (5) a Switch Reference Structure, or (6) juxtaposition.

8.1.1.1 Additive
The additive adverbial da ‘AD2’ is used as a conjunction to join clauses into a type of parallel sentence. Da is somewhat similar to and in English, but more restricted in its usage. See also under 5.2.4 Additive Adverbs, and 5.5.1.1.1 Additive Conjunction: da.

684) Wowoi irebu-a

da Pita bu irebu-a.

Wowoi come-RL.3s AD2 Peter AD1 come-RL.3s

‘Wowoi came and Pita too came.’

8.1.1.2 Adversative
An adversative relationship existing between binary lexical oppositions is encoded by final clauses/sentences conjoined by onoraka ‘but, however’. This conjunction is formed by a combination of the 3rd person singular intensified pronoun o-nor plus the limitation marker, =aka.
The notions of frustrated expectation and exception also encode as adversative sentences. However, a frustrated expectation in which only the expectation and the fact that it didn’t occur as expected is encoded as a contra-expectation negative tag clause. (See 5.7.2 The Negator ‘Weie’, #2).

8.1.1.3 Alternative Alternation may be explicitly indicated by disjunction or implied by juxtaposition.
8.1.1.3.1 Alternative Conjunction Final clauses are conjoined by the alternative conjunction e ‘or’. The alternate possibilities normally take the
form of a question, with the first alternative often being marked by the polar question marker i.

‘Don’t you have eyes, say? Or, don’t you have ears? Say?’

8.1.1.3.2 Positive/Negative Alternation
In this type of alternation, there are only two possible implied alternatives—positive or negative. Both possibilities make use of the same predicate. The structure consists of a positive polar question clause followed by an optional alternative conjunction, plus a juxtaposed negative tag clause.

8.1.1.3.3 Parallel Negative Alternation
Refer back to 5.5.1.1.2.2 ‘Parallel Negative Alternative Conjunction: meda...meda’ for an example of this type of coordinate structure. To date, there is only one example of this structure in the data.

8.1.1.4 Clause Chaining Structures
Clause chaining structures consist of one or more clauses ending in a medial verb form, followed by a final clause ending in a finite verb form. Medial forms presuppose the same subject as is marked on the final clause of the chain. See also section 4.2.3.3.2 “Medial Verb Inflection”.

8.1.1.4.1 Sequential
The medial verb suffixation –sa expresses a temporal sequence of the events. While it is more common to see only two clauses chained in this way, it is not uncommon to see three or four. And, occasionally even more have been noted, as in (693), though this is much less common. In the examples below, the medial verbs are marked with a single underline and the finite verbs are double underlined.

8.1.1.4.1.1 Mental Speech + Result
A Clause Chaining Structure using the medially marked speech verb (n)ane ‘say’ expresses a sequential relationship between a mental speech act (quoted directly, or indirectly, in reference to a situation or topic), and, the action occurring as a result of that speech act. Semantically, the quoted mental speech may encode: (1) a purpose, or (2) a field of reference.

8.1.1.4.1.1.1 Purpose
The ‘purpose’ mental speech clause consists of an obligatory speech quotation as the direct object, with the verb occurring in either an irrealis finite form or a non-finite form. The non-finite form expresses a more generalized purpose, since no person or number is marked on the verb (698). The embedded quotation clause is then followed by the bare generic/intransitive verb root (n)ane ‘say’ (695), or the same medially marked verb (n)ane-sa ‘say-SEQ’ (697). It seems most likely that this bare verb root, (n)ane, has simply dropped the medial verb ending, since it shares the same subject as is in the final verb form of the Result Clause. Since this ‘Mental Speech’ direct object is a kind of nominalized clause, often the demonstrative ono ‘D1’ marks the end of this embedded clause (i.e., preceding the speech verb nane or nanesa). Maia speakers prefer to write the demonstative ono + the medial verb nane(sa) as a single word, i.e. ononane(sa).
Chronologically, the medial ‘Purpose’ speech act precedes the action expressed in the finite Result Clause. Syntactically, however, it is quite appropriate to use this medial clause either in the normal medial position (694), or in the final clause position (695). This seems to be the only time this switch in order is allowed.
In the examples below, the expressed PURPOSE is marked by a double underline, and the RESULT clause by a single underline.

8.1.1.4.1.1.2 Field of Reference
As above, a mental quotation occurs as the direct object of the speech verb nane ‘say’ (or the same medially marked nane-sa ‘say-SEQ’). Only this time, the object quotation is a NP (instead of a clause) and encodes a field of reference. This mental field of reference is also followed by a result clause.
Syntactically, medial clauses expressing a field of reference always follow the normal sequential order for medial verbs, i.e., (1) the medial ‘field of reference clause’, followed by (2) the final ‘result’ clause.

8.1.1.4.2 Simultaneous
To show overlap between clauses having the same subject, the simultaneous (imperfective) medial verb form =game ‘SIM’ must be used. This clause serves as the background against which the other clause occurs. The overlap between the two clauses may be partial or complete, depending on the aspect marked on the verb of the following finite clause. Partial overlap is indicated when the verb of the finite clause is marked by the perfective aspect. Complete overlap is indicated when it is marked by the imperfective aspect. Also, the time of the overlap may be restricted by use of the limitation clitic =(w)aka. Refer back to section 3.1.3 for examples of restricted temporal overlap.

8.1.1.5 Switch-Reference Structures
The switch-reference markers bada ‘SS’ and di ‘DS’ mark the boundary between two clauses15. A clause boundary marked with the same subject marker bada always relates sequential actions. Clause boundaries marked with the different subject marker di may show a temporal relationship of partial overlap, complete overlap, or temporal succession, depending on the aspect marked on the verbs of the related clauses.

8.1.1.5.1 Temporal Overlap
Temporal overlap between clauses is marked by the imperfective aspect and by the different subject marker =(d)i ‘DS’. When the meaning of the finite verb is continuousness (rather than habituality), it indicates that the first clause is the context or background for the event of the following one.
The medial verb marked by -game ‘SIM’ is also used to indicate closely related events occurring simultaneously, see 8.1.1.4.2 above.

Partial Overlap:
Partial overlap is shown when the verb of clause1 is marked in the imperfective aspect [-gV] and the verb of clause2 is marked in the perfective aspect [ø]:

8.1.1.5.2 Temporal Succession To mark that two events occurred sequentially, the finite verb of the first clause may either be marked with an
imperfective aspect marker (but only in cases where the meaning indicates habituality), or, with a perfective aspect marker. The medial verb marked by -sa ‘SEQ’ is also used to indicate closely related events occurring in succession, see 8.1.1.4.1 .
Perfective Sequential Succession: Sequential succession is shown when the finite verb of clause1 is marked in the perfective aspect [ø] and the
finite verb of clause2 is also marked in the perfective [ø]:

Sequential Priority: An event may be marked as having sequential priority over another event. This is marked in two ways. One
way is by marking the first clause with the LOC2 clitic =ra, or by marking the first clause with the word duwa ‘one’ following a realis clause. See also section 3.6.2 for more examples.

8.2 Subordinate Relationships and Structures
Subordinate structures include adverbial clauses indicating a number of semantic relationships.
8.2.1 Adverbial Clauses
Adverbial Clauses indicate temporal, conditional, purpose, or various causative relationships.
8.2.1.1 Conditional Conditional clauses are divided into realis, irrealis, and contrafactual types. A contingency relationship exists between Clause 1 (expressing a given or assumed circumstance or situation),
and Clause 2 (whose fulfillment is contingent on the fulfillment of the events of the previous clause). The topic marker =(n)o is normally used to mark the first clause. Refer back to 3.7.2 for conditional/temporal clauses. The demonstrative ono ‘D1’ can also be used to mark the conditional protasis, (720), (724).
8.2.1.1.1 Realis Conditional / Temporal A Realis Conditional/Temporal Clause indicates an event that really happened. It is marked in the realis mood,
and may be compared to the English dependent temporal clause marked by when. Realis conditional clauses are marked by the topic marker =(n)o or by ono ‘D1’ indicating that it is the background clause on which the following clause is dependent for its fulfillment. See also Section 7.6.5 Headless Temporal Relative Clauses.

weie lov. no good ‘Of all the men who went to the sago, even one did not return to the village.’

8.2.1.1.2 Irrealis Conditional
Irrealis Conditional Clauses express events that will happen or might happen, but haven’t really happened yet. Verbs in both protasis and apodosis are marked in the irrealis mood, and may include events that are truly expected to happen or totally hypothetical situations. There is no marking to distinguish the degree of expectability. It is simple inferred by the context. While irrealis conditional clause may not always be marked by the topic marker =(n)o or ono ‘D1’, it can be, and marking it makes it clear to the addressee that it is a conditional/temporal clause.

‘(Given that/ if) you people would be sitting outside the house, you must not enter the inside of the house and get things.’

8.2.1.1.3 Contrafactual Conditional
The action in a sentence marked as ‘Contrafactual’ didn’t happen as stated because the condition of the previous clause was also not fulfilled. The conditional clause is optionally marked by the topic marker, =(n)o or ono ‘D1’, and the main clause is marked by the contrafactual marker =git. See also section 3.9 entitled The Contrafactual Marker: =git.

‘If it hadn’t rained yesterday, we could have been at work.’

8.2.1.2 Cause
An adverbial speech clause conjoins an EFFECT clause and a CAUSE clause in a hypotactic relationship. In this structure, the EFFECT clause always precedes the CAUSE. The CAUSE clause is used to explain why a preceding EFFECT statement is true.
The interrogative maia ‘what’, plus the verb stem nane ‘say’ (nane marking the field of reference) is combined as maia + nane (i.e., ‘about what?’) to form the interrogative why. With the addition of the negator me, i.e., me + maianane, the meaning becomes ‘why not’ or ‘because.’ This back-referencing adverbial ‘mini-clause’ (Thompson & Longacre, 1985:227-228), has been reduced and stylized to function as a conjunction. Occasionally, the previous final verb of the reported speech is repeated as well, as in example (728). This conjunction is written me(da) maianane, with maia+nane being compounded as a single word.

Refer back to section 8.1.1.4.1.1.1 (Expressing Purpose/Goal) for information about ono+nane ‘D1+say’ following a verb in the irrealis mode.

8.2.1.3 Result
Result relationships are marked by the demonstrative ono ‘that’ plus the verb stem nane ‘say’, and is written as a single word, i.e. ononane. English equivalents would be so, so that or therefore. As with the effect/cause conjunction above, this form, too, involves a back-referencing “mini-clause” which has been reduced and stylized to function as a conjunction.
In addition to the ono+nane conjunction, other similar “mini-clause’ forms are used as linking devices. For example, the proximal demonstrative ovo+nane ‘PROX+say’/ ‘therefore’, or the verb roots which carry the manner derivational suffix =mate ‘MN’, as in ne=mate ‘do=MN’/‘do.like.that’ and ige+ne=mate ‘be+do=MN’/‘how’—all may precede the verb root nane ‘say’ (e.g., Nemate nane,…; Ige-nemate nane,…; Ononane nane,…), and all refer back to the previous reason clause(s), (733) and (734).

8.2.2 Direct Speech
Both the Quotation and Report Clauses may be any type of finite clause or sentence—imperative, desiderative, interrogative, or declarative.
The verb roots used in speech structures are:

 nane  saki-a  -de
 nudase  toga  vase

‘say/think/wonder’ —intransitive verb root (no addressee mentioned) ‘talk-VR1’— to include an addressee, must be serialised with ese ‘give’ ‘-tell ’— transitive (obligatory person/number prefix marking the
addressee) ‘ask’ ‘ask.2’
‘call (to somebody)’—(as a transitive, the person/number prefix marks the addressee)

Direct Speech takes the deictic perspective of the original speaker; that is, the quotation is presented just as it might have been uttered. Direct Quotation is a prevalent way of reporting speech in Maia.
There are two types of Direct Speech structures:
In the first structure, a Report Clause may introduce the direct quotation, and a Report Verb Phrase may close the quotation. Either one or both may be present, though only one is necessary. As in other clauses, the only obligatory element in the Introductory Report Clause is the verb. In the data, the closing Report VP most often consists of the verb only, or else an optional manner word (marked by =mate) meaning ‘like that’, plus the speech verb. If both a direct and indirect object overtly occur in the Introductory Report Clause, the indirect object precedes the direct object. However, in the natural texts, normally only one or the other occurs. The subject and indirect object (if present) are always marked on the finite verb inflection. In the examples below, the main clause is the REPORT CLAUSE (marked by a double underline) and the other clause is the DIRECT QUOTATION (marked by a single underline).

INTRODUCTORY REPORT CLAUSE (S) (IO) (manner) + V medial or final

To emphasize that a quotation is using the exact words of the speaker, the manner verb stem ne=mate ‘do=MN’, plus the limitation clitic =waka may be used.

Sometimes the introductory report clause is preceded by a medial clause (i.e., forming a clause chaining structure) using a medial speech verb, in addition to the finite speech verb) to show the manner of speech. Two verbs which are always used in this way are:

 gave  wadibe

‘shout’ ‘argue’

The speech verb vase ‘call’ is also very often used as a medial speech verb of manner, although it has also been noted in natural texts as the finite speech verb of an introductory report clause as well.

The second Direct Speech structure follows the normal (S)OV pattern—with the closing verb being either a medial or final verb. The Direct Quotation clause is embedded in the clause as the Direct Object. This ‘Direct Quotation’ object is not marked by a relative marker. It takes the closing report clause, but does not normally take an introductory report clause preceding the quotation.

8.2.3 Indirect Speech
Indirect Speech quotes in Maia are coded as object complement clauses. (see also 7.5.3 The Finite Complement Clause) They follow the typical (S)-O-V pattern, closing with a speech verb. The quote clause is always marked by the relative marker ono ‘D1’. When referencing the tense and person, the verbs in the quote reflect the deictic perspective of the reporter.
The SPEECH VERB is marked by a double underline and the embedded INDIRECT QUOTE CLAUSE is marked by a single underline.

(SUBJECT)

INDIRECT QUOTE + ono ‘D1’ as Object Complement Clause

+ SPEECH VERB

8.2.4 Desire or Will as Speech (Direct or Indirect)
The basic pattern for expressing desire/will is similar to the first Direct Speech structure discussed above, with slight variations in what is allowable. In the Introductory Report Clause, only the verb muayaga ‘desire’ is used. This is followed by a direct or indirect quotation sentence as the direct object. And, in the data, when a closing report verb is present, only the verb (n)ane ‘say’ is used.

8.3 Speech Acts and Illocutionary Force
8.3.1 Declarative
Declarative or statement sentences are used to convey information about the world—including what is real (realis), or what is less than real (irrealis). They are assertions about events, actions, states or processes. Final statement clauses end with a falling intonational contour.

753) Inavu-da, i-buae +i-namo yabar

avia-mi.

bush/jungle=LOC2 animal 3p-look.for-IR.1p

‘In the bush, we will look for animals.’

154

August 2010

8.3.2 Imperative
8.3.2.1 Direct Command
Imperative sentences encode a high degree of manipulative force rather than an assertion. The goal of the speaker is to elicit some kind of action or response on the part of the addressee. A final imperative verb is indicated by suffixation in the imperative mood, or it may occur in an abbreviated root form only. The intonation is generally level, but may be spoken with more force on the stressed syllable and an increase in volume. Refer back to section 5.2.3.5.3.

755) Sa nag-uk!

Abuae=no dogo wa-g-a.

INTJ look-IMP.PF.s father=TP eel shoot-IPF-RL.3s

‘Hey look! Father is shooting an eel.’

756) Irebue-sa i-nabase-sa napar kani warupe-re. come-SEQ 1s-help-SEQ animal big hit-IMP.PF.p
‘Come, help me kill (the) big animal.’

8.3.2.2 Reporting a Command
The reported command is used in a narrative to command an addressee to report a command to someone else. The first clause is a finite speech clause in the irrealis mood, followed by a clause that contains the expected action. That verb is also in the irrealis mood.

757) Nago-mo di ne=mate yo-d-a,

'Avia-sa ni-buae sak-u-s-ini

look-RL.1s/3p DS do=MN 1s-tell-RL.3s go-SEQ 2s-father talk+3s-give-IR.2s

758) Me+da sak+u-s-ini

NEG+AD2 talk+3s-give-IR.2s DS come-SEQ shoot-IR.3s

‘You must not tell him and he will come and shoot it.’ (or, ‘You must not tell him to come and shoot it.’)

8.3.3 Desiderative
Refer back to 4.2.3.3.7 for information on verbs marked in the Desiderative mood.
Verbs in the Desiderative mood also may be followed by the verb (n)ane ‘say’ to form a Desiderative Serial Verb. Refer back to section 6.2.2.5.1 for information on this topic.

759) Nav tav-inek+an-a. betelnut get-DES.s+say-RL.3s
‘He wanted to get betelnut.’

760) Kelem, i=no muga idum-inok+ane-sa avia-mi. True 1p=TP bird steal-DES.p+say-SEQ go-RL.1p
‘True, we wanted to steal chickens and we went.’

8.3.4 Interrogative
Interrogative sentences express a desire to elicit information. There are two types of questions in Maia: (1) content questions, requesting content information, and (2) polar questions, requesting an affirmative or negative response.

8.3.4.1 Content questions
Content questions are marked by interrogative pro-words which occur in the same clause position as the element it would be replacing in a declarative clause. For example in (761) , the approximate locational interrogative ige=ra ‘where=LOC2’ occupies the same position in the question clause as the location word in the declarative response clause:

761) Nae=no kusirov=o ige=ra buase-me? Kaumuili sob ukuelek=ra

buasi-mi.

2p=TP ton.tree=TP be=LOC2 cut-RL.2p Kaumuili creek head.water=LOC2 cut-RL.1p

‘Whereabouts did you (pl.)cut the ton (tree)?’ We cut it at the head of Kamuili creek.

762) I=no nanav maia=no ige=ga kolokat-arav. 1p=TP food PL=TP be=LOC1 prepare-IR.1p
‘Where shall we prepare the food?”

763) No=no maia+nane ne=mate yo-nudase-g-ia? 2s=TP what+say do=MN 1s-ask-IPF-2s
‘Why are you asking me like that?’

8.3.4.2 Polar questions
Polar questions are marked by the polar question marker i following the final verb of a clause. There is also a rise in the intonation contour. The order of the core clause constituents remain SOV.
A negative alternative to this question may be formed when the negative word weie ‘no’ is appended to a polar question. See under section 5.7.2 The Negator ‘weie’ for examples of this form.

764) Di no*-d-a,

"Abuae, sa no=no nana=no um-a di

9. MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS
9.1 Gestures
 Clicking the thumb-nail upward on the front teeth = surprise Situation: When a man heard Linda or Jean speak some Maia for the first time at Asarumba a number of years ago.
 Quick succession of pats on the chest = happiness Situation: When we gave our village headman a pair of reading glasses for his very own.
 Raising the eye-brows = an affirmative answer  Sound made by putting the tongue in front of the alveolar ridge and pulling in air, and
often accompanied by wagging the head back and forth = to show that you are listening with sympathy, compassion, etc.  Scratching the back of the head = indicates (slight) embarrassment.  Turning (right) hand around from the wrist = indicates a negative answer or command.

9.2 Responses and Conventions
Some typical responses and conventions are as follows:

Ole. Weie. Me parar. Igido! Yono igido. Au! Igena. Lov.

Yes. No. / None. / Nothing. (I) don’t know. Forget it! I don’t want to. What? (i.e., ‘Say that again. I didn’t hear you.’) Perhaps. Good./ Thank you.

Gamavi. Excuse me./ Sorry./Please./ Isn’t it nice! (Used in many contexts to show politeness/graciousness/sympathy/empathy.)

Ooo’

An expression of positive acknowledgement—to a call, a greeting, leave-taking, agreeing with a statement/question, etc. Starts with lower pitch, goes up with rising intonation, ends in glottal stop.

Nogo

An expression, attached either at the beginning or the end of a question sentence. (1) used to elicit a response, and, (2) used regularly with rhetorical questions. Rhetorical questions may be used to signal disagreement, disapproval, negative surprise, rebuke, etc.

Greeting: O gamavi. Irebuia.

“Oh, how nice, you’ve come.”

August 2010

157

Leaving: “Aviasomo.”/ “Aviagomo” “I’m about to go.” / “I’m going.” Response: “O gamavi. Aria, aviar.” “Oh, sorry. Okay, you go.”

The following are recent conventions adopted from English and Tok Pisin:

Uruwa! / Uruwa lov! Unaro! / Unaro lov! Gener! / Gener lov!

Morning!/ Good Morning! Afternoon! / Good Afternoon! Night! / Good Night!

9.3.5 Emotive Expressions
9.3.5.1 Emotions of the -munuv ‘heart’
The inalienably possessed noun, -munuv ‘heart’, not only literally refers to the physical organ in the body that pumps blood, but, as in English, figuratively refers to the inner self, or mental, emotional, and cognitive activity inside a person; it is that hidden part of a person’s life that represents the true character of the person. e.g., the attitudes, awareness, motives, the person’s will, thoughts, desires, concerns, emotions, feelings, etc. There are many figurative expressions relating to the -munuv. Below are a few examples of these expressions.

u-munuv wavil-ø-a 3s-heart grease-VR2-RL.3s

‘he/she was pleased’

u-munuv lov+an-a 3s-heart good+say-RL.3s
